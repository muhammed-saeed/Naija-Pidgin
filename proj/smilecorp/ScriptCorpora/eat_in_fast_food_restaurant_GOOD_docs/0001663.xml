Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date. This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world&apos;s population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year&apos;s end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts. We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

Of love and delight. 

Old Shaker Hymn
Favorite of Dr. Isabelle Moser 
 

    I was a physically tough,
happy-go-lucky fellow until I reached my late thirties. Then I began to experience
more and more off days when I did not feel quite right. I thought I possessed an
iron constitution. Although I grew a big food garden and ate mostly&quot;vegetablitarian&quot;I thought I could eat anything with impunity. I had been fond of drinking beer with
my friends while nibbling on salty snacks or heavy foods late into the night. And
until my health began to weaken I could still get up the next morning after several
homebrewed beers, feeling good, and would put in a solid day&apos;s work.
    When my health began to slip I went looking for a cure. Up
to that time the only use I&apos;d had for doctors was to fix a few traumatic injuries.
The only preventative health care I concerned myself with was to take a multivitamin
pill during those rare spells when I felt a bit run down and to eat lots of vegetables.
So I&apos;d not learned much about alternative health care.
    Naturally, my first stop was a local general practitioner/MD.
He gave me his usual half-hour get-acquainted checkout and opined that there almost
certainly was nothing wrong with me. I suspect I had the good fortune to encounter
an honest doctor, because he also said if it were my wish he could send me around
for numerous tests but most likely these would not reveal anything either. More than
likely, all that was wrong was that I was approaching 40; with the onset of middle
age I would naturally have more aches and pains. &apos;Take some aspirin and get used
to it,&apos; was his advice. &apos;It&apos;ll only get worse.&apos;
    Not satisfied with his dismal prognosis I asked an energetic
old guy I knew named Paul, an &apos;80-something homesteader who was renowned for his
organic garden and his good health. Paul referred me to his doctor, Isabelle Moser,
who at that time was running the Great Oaks School of Health, a residential and out-patient
spa nearby at Creswell, Oregon.
    Dr. Moser had very different methods of analysis than the
medicos, was warmly personal and seemed very safe to talk to. She looked me over,
did some strange magical thing she called muscle testing and concluded that I still
had a very strong constitution. If I would eliminate certain&quot;bad&quot;foods
from my diet, eliminate some generally healthful foods that, unfortunately, I was
allergic to, if I would reduce my alcohol intake greatly and take some food supplements,
then gradually my symptoms would abate. With the persistent application of a little
self-discipline over several months, maybe six months, I could feel really well again
almost all the time and would probably continue that way for many years to come.
This was good news, though the need to apply personal responsibility toward the solution
of my problem seemed a little sobering.
    But I could also see that Dr. Moser was obviously not telling
me something. So I gently pressed her for the rest. A little shyly, reluctantly,
as though she were used to being rebuffed for making such suggestions, Isabelle asked
me if I had ever heard of fasting? &apos;Yes,&apos; I said.&quot;I had. Once when I was about
twenty and staying at a farm in Missouri, during a bad flu I actually did fast, mainly
because I was too sick to take anything but water for nearly one week.&apos;
    &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;I demanded.
    &quot;If you would fast, you will start feeling really good
as soon as the fast is over.&quot;she said.
    &quot;Fast? How long?&quot;
    &quot;Some have fasted for a month or even longer,&quot;she said. Then she observed my crestfallen expression and added,&quot;Even a couple
of weeks would make an enormous difference.&quot;
    It just so happened that I was in between set-up stages for
a new mail-order business I was starting and right then I did have a couple of weeks
when I was virtually free of responsibility. I could also face the idea of not eating
for a couple of weeks.&quot;Okay!&quot;I said somewhat impulsively.&quot;I could
fast for two weeks. If I start right now maybe even three weeks, depending on how
my schedule works out.&quot;
    So in short order I was given several small books about fasting
to read at home and was mentally preparing myself for several weeks of severe privation,
my only sustenance to be water and herb tea without sweetener. And then came the
clinker.
    &quot;Have you ever heard of colonics?&quot;she asked sweetly.
    &quot;Yes. Weird practice, akin to anal sex or something?&quot;
    &quot;Not at all,&quot;she responded.&quot;Colonics are
essential during fasting or you will have spells when you&apos;ll feel terrible. Only
colonics make water fasting comfortable and safe.&quot;
    Then followed some explanation about bowel cleansing (and
another little book to take home) and soon I was agreeing to get my body over to
her place for a colonic every two or three days during the fasting period, the first
colonic scheduled for the next afternoon. I&apos;ll spare you a detailed description of
my first fast with colonics; you&apos;ll read about others shortly. In the end I withstood
the boredom of water fasting for 17 days. During the fast I had about 7 colonics.
I ended up feeling great, much trimmer, with an enormous rebirth of energy. And when
I resumed eating it turned out to be slightly easier to control my dietary habits
and appetites.
    Thus began my practice of an annual health-building water
fast. Once a year, at whatever season it seemed propitious, I&apos;d set aside a couple
of weeks to heal my body. While fasting I&apos;d slowly drive myself over to Great Oaks
School for colonics every other day. By the end of my third annual fast in 1981,
Isabelle and I had become great friends. About this same time Isabelle&apos;s relationship
with her first husband, Douglas Moser, had disintegrated. Some months later, Isabelle
and I became partners. And then we married.
    My regular fasts continued through 1984, by which time I
had recovered my fundamental organic vigor and had retrained my dietary habits. About
1983 Isabelle and I also began using Life Extension megavitamins as a therapy against
the aging process. Feeling so much better I began to find the incredibly boring weeks
of prophylactic fasting too difficult to motivate myself to do, and I stopped. Since
that time I fast only when acutely ill. Generally less than one week on water handles
any non-optimum health condition I&apos;ve had since &apos;84. I am only 54 years old as I
write these words, so I hope it will be many, many years before I find myself in
the position where I have to fast for an extended period to deal with a serious or
life-threatening condition.
    I am a kind of person the Spanish call autodidactico, meaning that I prefer to teach myself. I had already learned the fine art of self-employment
and general small-business practice that way, as well as radio and electronic theory,
typography and graphic design, the garden seed business, horticulture, and agronomy.
When Isabelle moved in with me she also brought most of Great Oak&apos;s extensive library,
including very hard to obtain copies of the works of the early hygienic doctors.
Naturally I studied her books intensely.
    Isabelle also brought her medical practice into our house.
At first it was only a few loyal local clients who continued to consult with her
on an out-patient basis, but after a few years, the demands for residential care
from people who were seriously and sometimes life-threateningly sick grew irresistibly,
and I found myself sharing our family house with a parade of really sick people.
True, I was not their doctor, but because her residential clients became temporary
parts of our family, I helped support and encourage our residents through their fasting
process. I&apos;m a natural teacher (and how-to-do-it writer), so I found myself explaining
many aspects of hygienic medicine to Isabelle&apos;s clients, while having a first-hand
opportunity to observe for myself the healing process at work. Thus it was that I
became the doctor&apos;s assistant and came to practice second-hand hygienic medicine.
    In 1994, when Isabelle had reached the age of 54, she began
to think about passing on her life&apos;s accumulation of healing wisdom by writing a
book. She had no experience at writing for the popular market, her only major writing
being a Ph.D. dissertation. I on the other hand had published seven books about vegetable
gardening. And I grasped the essentials of her wisdom as well as any non-practitioner
could. So we took a summer off and rented a house in rural Costa Rica, where I helped
Isabelle put down her thoughts on a cheap word-processing typewriter. When we returned
to the States, I fired-up my&quot;big-mac&quot;and composed this manuscript into
a rough book format that was given to some of her clients to get what is trendily
called these days,&quot;feedback.&quot;
    But before we could completely finish her book, Isabelle
became dangerously ill and after a long, painful struggle with abdominal cancer,
she died. After I resurfaced from the worst of my grief and loss, I decided to finish
her book. Fortunately, the manuscript needed little more than polishing. I am telling
the reader these things because many ghost-written books end up having little direct
connection with the originator of the thoughts. Not so in this case. And unlike many
ghost writers, I had a long and loving apprenticeship with the author. At every step
of our colaboration on this book I have made every effort to communicate Isabelle&apos;s
viewpoints in the way she would speak, not my own. Dr. Isabelle Moser was for many
years my dearest friend. I have worked on this book to help her pass her understanding
on.
    Many people consider death to be a complete invalidation
of a healing arts practitioner. I don&apos;t. Coping with her own dicey health had been
a major motivator for Isabelle&apos;s interest in healing others. She will tell you more
about it in the chapters to come. Isabelle had been fending off cancer since its
first blow up when she was 26 years old. I view that 30 plus years of defeating Death
as a great success rather than consider her ultimate defeat as a failure.
    Isabelle Moser was born in 1940 and died in 1996. I think
the greatest accomplishment of her 56 years was to meld virtually all available knowledge
about health and healing into a workable and most importantly, a simple model that
allowed her to have amazing success. Her&quot;system&quot;is simple enough that
even a generally well-educated non-medico like me can grasp it. And use it without
consulting a doctor every time a symptom appears.
    Finally, I should mention that over the years since this
book was written I have discovered contains some significant errors of anatomical
or psysiological detail. Most of these happened because the book was written&quot;off
the top of Isabelle&apos;s head,&quot;without any reference materials at hand, not even
an anatomy text. I have not fixed these goofs as I am not even qualified to find
them all. Thus, when the reader reads such as &apos;the pancreas secreates enzymes into
the stomach,&apos; (actually and correctly, the duodenum) I hope they will understand
and not invalidate the entire book.
 
 Chapter One 
 How I Became a Hygienist 
 
 

From The Hygienic Dictionary 

 Doctors. [1] In the matter of disease and healing, the people
have been treated as serfs. The doctor is a dictator who knows it all, and the people
are stupid, dumb, driven cattle, fit for nothing except to be herded together, bucked
and gagged when necessary to force medical opinion down their throats or under their
skins. I found that professional dignity was more often pomposity, sordid bigotry
and gilded ignorance. The average physician is a fear-monger, if he is anything.
He goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may scare to death. Dr. John.
H. Tilden, Impaired Health: Its Cause and Cure, Vol. 1, 1921. [2] Today we are
not only in the Nuclear Age but also the Antibiotic Age. Unhappily, too, this is
the Dark Age of Medicine--an age in which many of my colleagues, when confronted
with a patient, consult a volume which rivals the Manhattan telephone directory in
size. This book contains the names of thousands upon thousands of drugs used to alleviate
the distressing symptoms of a host of diseased states of the body. The doctor then
decides which pink or purple or baby-blue pill to prescribe for the patient. This
is not, in my opinion, the practice of medicine. Far too many of these new&quot;miracle&quot;drugs are introduced with fanfare and then reveled as lethal in character, to be
silently discarded for newer and more powerful drugs. Dr. Henry Bieler: Food is
Your Best Medicine; 1965. 
 

    I have two reasons for writing this book. One, to help educate
the general public about the virtues of natural medicine. The second, to encourage
the next generation of natural healers. Especially the second because it is not easy
to become a natural hygienist; there is no school or college or licensing board.
    Most AMA-affiliated physicians follow predictable career
paths, straight well-marked roads, climbing through apprenticeships in established
institutions to high financial rewards and social status. Practitioners of natural
medicine are not awarded equally high status, rarely do we become wealthy, and often,
naturopaths arrive at their profession rather late in life after following the tangled
web of their own inner light. So I think it is worth a few pages to explain how I
came to practice a dangerous profession and why I have accepted the daily risks of
police prosecution and civil liability without possibility of insurance.
    Sometimes it seems to me that I began this lifetime powerfully
predisposed to heal others. So, just for childhood warm-ups I was born into a family
that would be much in need of my help. As I&apos;ve always disliked an easy win, to make
rendering that help even more difficult, I decided to be the youngest child, with
two older brothers.
    A pair of big, capable brothers might have guided and shielded
me. But my life did not work out that way. The younger of my two brothers, three
years ahead of me, was born with many health problems. He was weak, small, always
ill, and in need of protection from other children, who are generally rough and cruel.
My father abandoned our family shortly after I was born; it fell to my mother to
work to help support us. Before I was adolescent my older brother left home to pursue
a career in the Canadian Air Force.
    Though I was the youngest, I was by far the healthiest. Consequently,
I had to pretty much raise myself while my single mother struggled to earn a living
in rural western Canada. This circumstance probably reinforced my constitutional
predilection for independent thought and action. Early on I started to protect my&quot;little&quot;brother, making sure the local bullies didn&apos;t take advantage of
him. I learned to fight big boys and win. I also helped him acquire simple skills,
ones that most kids grasp without difficulty, such as swimming, bike riding, tree
climbing, etc.
    And though not yet adolescent, I had to function as a responsible
adult in our household. Stressed by anger over her situation and the difficulties
of earning our living as a country school teacher (usually in remote one-room schools),
my mother&apos;s health deteriorated rapidly. As she steadily lost energy and became less
able to take care of the home, I took over more and more of the cleaning, cooking,
and learned how to manage her--a person who feels terrible but must work to survive.
    During school hours my mother was able to present a positive
attitude, and was truly a gifted teacher. However, she had a personality quirk. She
obstinately preferred to help the most able students become even more able, but she
had little desire to help those with marginal mentalities. This predilection got
her into no end of trouble with local school boards; inevitably it seemed the District
Chairman would have a stupid, badly-behaved child that my mother refused to cater
to. Several times we had to move in the middle of the school year when she was dismissed
without notice for&quot;insubordination.&quot;This would inevitably happen on the
frigid Canadian Prairies during mid-winter.
    At night, exhausted by the day&apos;s efforts, my mother&apos;s positiveness
dissipated and she allowed her mind to drift into negative thoughts, complaining
endlessly about my irresponsible father and about how much she disliked him for treating
her so badly. These emotions and their irresponsible expression were very difficult
for me to deal with as a child, but it taught me to work on diverting someone&apos;s negative
thoughts, and to avoid getting dragged into them myself, skills I had to use continually
much later on when I began to manage mentally and physically ill clients on a residential
basis.
    My own personal health problems had their genesis long before
my own birth. Our diet was awful, with very little fresh fruit or vegetables. We
normally had canned, evaporated milk, though there were a few rare times when raw
milk and free-range fertile farm eggs were available from neighbors. Most of my foods
were heavily salted or sugared, and we ate a great deal of fat in the form of lard.
My mother had little money but she had no idea that some of the most nutritious foods
are also the least expensive.
    It is no surprise to me that considering her nutrient-poor,
fat-laden diet and stressful life, my mother eventually developed severe gall bladder
problems. Her degeneration caused progressively more and more severe pain until she
had a cholecystectomy. The gallbladder&apos;s profound deterioration had damaged her liver
as well, seeming to her surgeon to require the removal of half her liver. After this
surgical insult she had to stop working and never regained her health. Fortunately,
by this time all her children were independent.
    I had still more to overcome. My eldest brother had a nervous
breakdown while working on the DEW Line (he was posted on the Arctic Circle watching
radar screens for a possible incoming attack from Russia). I believe his collapse
actually began with our childhood nutrition. While in the Arctic all his foods came
from cans. He also was working long hours in extremely cramped quarters with no leave
for months in a row, never going outside because of the cold, or having the benefit
of natural daylight.
    When he was still in the acute stage of his illness (I was
still a teenager myself) I went to the hospital where my bother was being held, and
talked the attending psychiatrist into immediately discharging him into my care.
The physician also agreed to refrain from giving him electroshock therapy, a commonly
used treatment for mental conditions in Canadian hospitals at that time. Somehow
I knew the treatment they were using was wrong.
    I brought my brother home still on heavy doses of thorazine.
The side effects of this drug were so severe he could barely exist: blurred vision,
clenched jaw, trembling hands, and restless feet that could not be kept still. These
are common problems with the older generation of psycho tropic medications, generally
controlled to some extent with still other drugs like cogentin (which he was taking
too).
    My brother steadily reduced his tranquilizers until he was
able to think and do a few things. On his own he started taking a lot of B vitamins
and eating whole grains. I do not know exactly why he did this, but I believe he
was following his intuition. (I personally did not know enough to suggest a natural
approach at that time.) In any case after three months on vitamins and an improved
diet he no long needed any medication, and was delighted to be free of their side
effects. He remained somewhat emotionally fragile for a few more months but he soon
returned to work, and has had no mental trouble from that time to this day. This
was the beginning of my interest in mental illness, and my first exposure to the
limitations of &apos;modern&apos; psychiatry.
    I always preferred self-discipline to being directed by others.
So I took every advantage of having a teacher for a mother and studied at home instead
of being bored silly in a classroom. In Canada of that era you didn&apos;t have to go
to high school to enter university, you only had to pass the written government entrance
exams. At age 16, never having spent a single day in high school, I passed the university
entrance exams with a grade of 97 percent. At that point in my life I really wanted
to go to medical school and become a doctor, but I didn&apos;t have the financial backing
to embark on such a long and costly course of study, so I settled on a four year
nursing course at the University of Alberta, with all my expenses paid in exchange
for work at the university teaching hospital.
    At the start of my nurses training I was intensely curious
about everything in the hospital: birth, death, surgery, illness, etc. I found most
births to be joyful, at least when everything came out all right. Most people died
very alone in the hospital, terrified if they were conscious, and all seemed totally
unprepared for death, emotionally or spiritually. None of the hospital staff wanted
to be with a dying person except me; most hospital staff were unable to confront
death any more bravely than those who were dying. So I made it a point of being at
the death bed. The doctors and nurses found it extremely unpleasant to have to deal
with the preparation of the dead body for the morgue; this chore usually fell to
me also. I did not mind dead bodies. They certainly did not mind me!
    I had the most difficulty accepting surgery. There were times
when surgery was clearly a life saving intervention, particularly when the person
had incurred a traumatic injury, but there were many other cases when, though the
knife was the treatment of choice, the results were disastrous.
    Whenever I think of surgery, my recollections always go to
a man with cancer of the larynx. At that time the University of Alberta had the most
respected surgeons and cancer specialists in the country. To treat cancer they invariably
did surgery, plus radiation and chemotherapy to eradicate all traces of cancerous
tissue in the body, but they seemed to forget there also was a human being residing
in that very same cancerous body. This particularly unfortunate man came into our
hospital as a whole human being, though sick with cancer. He could still speak, eat,
swallow, and looked normal. But after surgery he had no larynx, nor esophagus, nor
tongue, and no lower jaw.
    The head surgeon, who, by the way, was considered to be a
virtual god amongst gods, came back from the operating room smiling from ear to ear,
announcing proudly that he had &apos;got all the cancer&apos;. But when I saw the result I
thought he&apos;d done a butcher&apos;s job. The victim couldn&apos;t speak at all, nor eat except
through a tube, and he looked grotesque. Worst, he had lost all will to live. I thought
the man would have been much better off to keep his body parts as long as he could,
and die a whole person able to speak, eating if he felt like it, being with friends
and family without inspiring a gasp of horror.
    I was sure there must be better ways of dealing with degenerative
conditions such as cancer, but I had no idea what they might be or how to find out.
There was no literature on medical alternatives in the university library, and no
one in the medical school ever hinted at the possibility except when the doctors
took jabs at chiropractors. Since no one else viewed the situation as I did I started
to think I might be in the wrong profession.
    It also bothered me that patients were not respected, were
not people; they were considered a&quot;case&quot;or a&quot;condition.&quot;I
was frequently reprimanded for wasting time talking to patients, trying to get acquainted.
The only place in the hospital where human contact was acceptable was the psychiatric
ward. So I enjoyed the rotation to psychiatry for that reason, and decided that I
would like to make psychiatry or psychology my specialty.
    By the time I finished nursing school, it was clear that
the hospital was not for me. I especially didn&apos;t like its rigid hierarchical system,
where all bowed down to the doctors. The very first week in school we were taught
that when entering a elevator, make sure that the doctor entered first, then the
intern, then the charge nurse. Followed by, in declining order of status: graduate
nurses, third year nurses, second year nurses, first year nurses, then nursing aids,
then orderlies, then ward clerks, and only then, the cleaning staff. No matter what
the doctor said, the nurse was supposed to do it immediately without question--a
very military sort of organization.
    Nursing school wasn&apos;t all bad. I learned how to take care
of all kinds of people with every variety of illness. I demonstrated for myself that
simple nursing care could support a struggling body through its natural healing process.
But the doctor-gods tended to belittle and denigrate nurses. No wonder--so much of
nursing care consists of unpleasant chores like bed baths, giving enemas and dealing
with other bodily functions.
    I also studied the state-of-the-art science concerning every
conceivable medical condition, its symptoms, and treatment. At the university hospital
nurses were required to take the same pre-med courses as the doctors--including anatomy,
physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. Consequently, I think it is essential
for holistic healers to first ground themselves in the basic sciences of the body&apos;s
physiological systems. There is also much valuable data in standard medical texts
about the digestion, assimilation, and elimination. To really understand illness,
the alternative practitioner must be fully aware of the proper functioning of the
cardiovascular/pulmonary system, the autonomic and voluntary nervous system, the
endocrine system, plus the mechanics and detailed nomenclature of the skeleton, muscles,
tendons and ligaments. Also it is helpful to know the conventional medical models
for treating various disorders, because they do appear to work well for some people,
and should not be totally invalidated simply on the basis of one&apos;s philosophical
or religious viewpoints.
    Many otherwise well-meaning holistic practitioners, lacking
an honest grounding in science, sometimes express their understanding of the human
body in non-scientific, metaphysical terms that can seem absurd to the well-instructed.
I am not denying here that there is a spiritual aspect to health and illness; I believe
there are energy flows in and around the body that can effect physiological functioning.
I am only suggesting that to discuss illness without hard science is like calling
oneself a abstract artist because the painter has no ability to even do a simple,
accurate representational drawing of a human figure.
    Though hospital life had already become distasteful to me
I was young and poor when I graduated. So after nursing school I buckled down and
worked just long enough to save enough money to obtain a masters degree in Clinical
Psychology from the University of British Columbia. Then I started working at Riverview
Hospital in Vancouver, B.C., doing diagnostic testing, and group therapy, mostly
with psychotic people. At Riverview I had a three-year-long opportunity to observe
the results of conventional psychiatric treatment.
    The first thing I noticed was the &apos;revolving door&apos; phenomena.
That is, people go out, and then they&apos;re back in, over and over again, demonstrating
that standard treatment--drugs, electroshock and group therapy--had been ineffective.
Worse, the treatments given at Riverside were dangerous, often with long term side
effects that were more damaging than the disease being treated. It felt like nursing
school all over again; in the core of my being I somehow knew there was a better
way, a more effective way of helping people to regain their mental health. Feeling
like an outsider, I started investigating the hospital&apos;s nooks and crannies. Much
to my surprise, in a back ward, one not open to the public, I noticed a number of
people with bright purple skins.
    I asked the staff about this and every one of the psychiatrists
denied these patients existed. This outright and widely-agreed-upon lie really raised
my curiosity. Finally after pouring through the journals in the hospital library
I found an article describing psycho tropic-drug-induced disruptions of melanin (the
dark skin pigment). Thorazine, a commonly used psychiatric drug, when taken in high
doses over a long period of time would do this. Excess melanin eventually was deposited
in vital organs such as the heart and the liver, causing death.
    I found it especially upsetting to see patients receive electroshock
treatments. These violent, physician-induced traumas did seem to disrupt dysfunctional
thought patterns such as an impulse to commit suicide, but afterwards the victim
couldn&apos;t remember huge parts of their life or even recall who they were. Like many
other dangerous medical treatments, electroshock can save life but it can also take
life away by obliterating identity.
    According the Hippocratic Oath, the first criteria of a treatment
is that it should do no harm. Once again I found myself trapped in a system that
made me feel severe protest. Yet none of these specialists or university professors,
or academic libraries had any information about alternatives. Worse, none of these
mind-doctor-gods were even looking for better treatments.
    Though unpleasant and profoundly disappointing, my experience
as a mental hospital psychologist was, like being in nursing school, also very valuable.
Not only did I learn how to diagnose, and evaluate the severity of mental illness
and assess the dangerousness of the mentally ill, I learned to understand them, to
feel comfortable with them, and found that I was never afraid of them. Fearlessness
is a huge advantage. The mentally ill seem to have a heightened ability to spot fear
in others. If they sense that you are afraid they frequently enjoy terrorizing you.
When psychotic people know you feel comfortable with them, and probably understand
a great deal of what they are experiencing, when they know that you can and intend
to control them, they experience a huge sense of relief. I could always get mentally
ill people to tell me what was really going on in their heads when no one else could
get them to communicate.
    A few years later I married an American and became the Mental
Health Coordinator for Whatcom County, the northwestern corner of Washington State.
I handled all the legal proceedings in the county for mentally ill people. After
treatment in the state mental hospital I supervised their reentry into the community,
and attempted to provide some follow up. This work further confirmed my conclusions
that in most cases the mentally ill weren&apos;t helped by conventional treatment. Most
of them rapidly became social problems after discharge. It seemed the mental hospital&apos;s
only ethically defensible function was incarceration--providing temporary relief
for the family and community from the mentally ill person&apos;s destructiveness.
    I did see a few people recover in the mental health system.
Inevitably these were young, and had not yet become institutionalized, a term describing
someone who comes to like being in the hospital because confinement feels safe. Hospitalization
can mean three square meals and a bed. It frequently means an opportunity to have
a sex life (many female inmates are highly promiscuous). Many psychotics are also
criminal; the hospital seems far better to them than jail. Many chronically mentally
ill are also experts at manipulating the system. When homeless, they deliberately
get hospitalized for some outrageous deed just before winter. They then&quot;recover&quot;when the fine weather of spring returns.
    After a year as Mental Health Co-ordinator, I had enough
of the&quot;system&quot;and decided that it was as good a time as any to return
to school for a Ph.D., this time at University. of Oregon where I studied clinical
and counseling psychology and gerontology. While in graduate school I became pregnant
and had my first child. Not surprisingly, this experience profoundly changed my consciousness.
I realized that it had perhaps been all right for me to be somewhat irresponsible
about my own nutrition and health, but that it was not okay to inflict poor nutrition
on my unborn child. At that time I was addicted to salty, deep-fat fried corn chips
and a diet pop. I thought I had to have these so-called foods every day. I tended
to eat for taste, in other words, what I liked, not necessarily what would give me
the best nutrition. I was also eating a lot of what most people would consider healthy
food: meat, cheese, milk, whole grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruits.
    My constitution had seemed strong and vital enough through
my twenties to allow this level of dietary irresponsibility. During my early 20s
I had even recovered from a breast cancer by sheer will power. (I will discuss this
later.) So before my pregnancy I had not questioned my eating habits.
    As my body changed and adapted itself to it&apos;s new purpose
I began visiting the libraries and voraciously read everything obtainable under the
topic of nutrition--all the texts, current magazines, nutritional journals, and health
newsletters. My childhood habit of self-directed study paid off. I discovered alternative
health magazines like Let&apos;s Live, Prevention, Organic Gardening, and Best Ways, and
promptly obtained every back issue since they were first published. Along the way
I ran into articles by Linus Pauling on vitamin C, and sent away for all of his books,
one of these was co-authored with David Hawkins, called The Orthomolecular Approach
to Mental Disorders.
    This book had a profound effect on me. I instantly recognized
that it was Truth with a capital&quot;T&quot;, although the orthomolecular approach
was clearly in opposition to the established medical model and contradicted everything
I had ever learned as a student or professional. Here at last was the exciting alternative
approach to treating mental disorders I had so long sought. I filed this information
away, waiting for an opportunity to use it. And I began to study all the references
in The Orthomolecular Approach to Mental Disorders dealing with correcting the perceptual
functioning of psychotic people using natural substances.
    In the course of delving through libraries and book stores,
I also came across the Mokelumne Hill Publishing Company (now defunct). This obscure
publisher reprinted many unusual and generally crudely reproduced out-of-print books
about raw foods diets, hygienic medicine, fruitarianism, fasting, breathairianism,
plus some works discussing spiritual aspects of living that were far more esoteric
than I had ever thought existed. I decided that weird or not, I might as well find
out everything potentially useful. So I spent a lot of money ordering their books.
Some of Mokelumne Hill&apos;s material really expanded my thoughts. Though much of it
seemed totally outrageous, in every book there usually was one line, one paragraph,
or if I was lucky one whole chapter that rang true for me.
    Recognizing capital&quot;T&quot;Truth when one sees it
is one of the most important abilities a person can have. Unfortunately, every aspect
of our mass educational system attempts to invalidate this skill. Students are repeatedly
told that derivation from recognized authority and/or the scientific method are the
only valid means to assess the validity of data. But there is another parallel method
to determine the truth or falsehood of information: Knowing. We Know by the simple
method of looking at something and recognizing its correctness. It is a spiritual
ability. I believe we all have it. But in my case, I never lost the ability to Know
because I almost never attended school.
    Thus it is that I am absolutely certain How and When to Be
Your Own Doctor will be recognized as Truth by some of my readers and rejected as
unscientific, unsubstantiated, or anecdotal information by others. I accept this
limitation on my ability to teach. If what you read in the following pages seems
True for you, great! If it doesn&apos;t, there is little or nothing I could do to further
convince.
    I return now to the time of my first pregnancy. In the face
of all these new Truths I was discovering concerning health and nutrition, I made
immediate changes in my diet. I severely reduced my animal protein intake and limited
cooked food in general. I began taking vitamin and mineral supplements. I also choose
a highly atypical Ph.D. dissertation topic,&quot;The Orthomolecular Treatment of
Mental Disorders.&quot;This fifty cent word, orthomolecular, basically means readjusting
the body chemistry by providing unusually large amounts of specific nutrient substances
normally found in the human body (vitamins and minerals). Orthomolecular therapy
for mental disorders is supported by good diet, by removal of allergy-producing substances,
by control of hypoglycemia, plus counseling, and provision of a therapeutic environment.
    My proposed dissertation topic met with nothing but opposition.
The professors on my doctoral committee had never heard of the word orthomolecular,
and all of them were certain it wasn&apos;t an accepted, traditional area of research.
Research in academia is supposed to be based on the works of a previous researchers
who arrived at hypothesis based on data obtained by strictly following scientific
methodology.&quot;Scientific&quot;data requires control groups, matched populations,
statistical analysis, etc. In my case there was no previous work my dissertation
committee would accept, because the available data did not originate from a medical
school or psychology department they recognized.
    Due to a lot of determination and perseverance I finally
did succeed in getting my thesis accepted, and triumphed over my doctoral committee.
And I graduated with a dual Ph.D. in both counseling psychology and gerontology.
My ambition was to establish the orthomolecular approach on the west coast. At that
time I knew of only two clinics in the world actively using nutritional therapy.
One was in New York and the other, was a Russian experimental fasting program for
schizophrenics. Doctors Hoffer and Osmond had used orthomolecular therapy in a Canadian
mental hospital as early as 1950, but they had both gone on to other things.
    The newly graduated Dr. Isabelle Moser, Ph.D. was at this
point actually an unemployed mother, renting an old, end-of-the-road, far-in-the-country
farmhouse; by then I had two small daughters. I strongly preferred to take care of
my own children instead of turning them over to a baby sitter. My location and my
children made it difficult for me to work any place but at home. So naturally, I
made my family home into a hospital for psychotic individuals. I started out with
one resident patient at a time, using no psychiatric drugs. I had very good results
and learned a tremendous amount with each client, because each one was different
and each was my first of each type.
    With any psychotic residing in your home it is foolhardy
to become inattentive even for one hour, including what are normally considered sleeping
hours. I have found the most profoundly ill mentally ill person still to be very
crafty and aware even though they may appear to be unconscious or nonresponsive.
Psychotics are also generally very intuitive, using faculties most of us use very
little or not at all. For example one of my first patients, Christine, believed that
I was trying to electrocute her. Though she would not talk, she repeatedly drew pictures
depicting this. She had, quite logically within her own reality, decided to kill
me with a butcher knife in self-defense before I succeeded in killing her. I had
to disarm Christine several times, hide all the household knives, change my sleeping
spot frequently, and generally stay sufficiently awake at night to respond to slight,
creaky sounds that could indicate the approach of stealthily placed small bare feet.
    With orthomolecular treatment Christine improved but also
became more difficult to live with as she got better. For example, when she came
out of catatonic-like immobility, she became extremely promiscuous, and was determined
to sleep with my husband. In fact she kept crawling into bed with him with no clothes
on. Either we had to forcefully remove her or the bed would be handed over to her--without
a resident man. Christine then decided (logically) that I was an obstacle to her
sex life, and once more set out to kill me. This stage also passed, eventually and
Christine got tolerably well.
    Christine&apos;s healing process is quite typical and demonstrates
why orthomolecular treatment is not popular. As a psychotic genuinely improves, their
aberrated behavior often becomes more aggressive initially and thus, harder to control.
It seems far more convenient for all concerned to suppress psychotic behavior with
stupefying drugs. A drugged person can be controlled when they&apos;re in a sort of perpetual
sedation but then, they never get genuinely well, either.
    Another early patient, Elizabeth, gave me a particularly
valuable lesson, one that changed the direction of my career away from curing insanity
and toward regular medicine. Elizabeth was a catatonic schizophrenic who did not
speak or move, except for some waxy posturing. She had to be fed, dressed and pottied.
Elizabeth was a pretty little brunette who got through a couple of years of college
and then spent several years in a state mental hospital. She had recently run away
from a hospital, and had been found wandering aimlessly or standing rigidly, apparently
staring fixedly at nothing. The emergency mental health facility in a small city
nearby called me up and asked if I would take her. I said I would, and drove into
town to pick her up. I found Elizabeth in someone&apos;s back yard staring at a bush.
It took me three hours to persuade her to get in my car, but that effort turned out
to be the easiest part of the next months.
    Elizabeth would do nothing for herself, including going to
the bathroom. I managed to get some nutrition into her, and change her clothes, but
that was about all I could do. Eventually she wore me down; I drifted off for an
hour&apos;s nap instead of watching her all night. Elizabeth slipped away in the autumn
darkness and vanished. Needless to say, when daylight came I desperately searched
the buildings, the yard, gardens, woods, and even the nearby river. I called in a
missing person report and the police looked as well. We stopped searching after a
week because there just wasn&apos;t any place else to look. Then, into my kitchen, right
in front of our round eyes and gaping mouths, walked a smiling, pleasant, talkative
young woman who was quite sane.
    She said,&quot;Hello I&apos;m Elizabeth! I&apos;m sorry I was such
a hassle last week, and thank you for trying to take care of me so well. I was too
sick to know any better.&quot;She said she had gone out our back door the week before
and crawled under a pile of fallen leaves on the ground in our back yard with a black
tarp over them. We had looked under the tarp at least fifty times during the days
past, but never thought to look under the leaves as well.
    This amazing occurrence made my head go bong to say the least;
it was obvious that Elizabeth had not been &apos;schizophrenic&apos; because of her genetics,
nor because of stress, nor malnutrition, nor hypoglycemia, nor because of any of
the causes of mental illness I had previously learned to identify and rectify, but
because of food allergies. Elizabeth was spontaneously cured because she&apos;d had nothing
to eat for a week. The composting pile of leaves hiding her had produced enough heat
to keep her warm at night and the heap contained sufficient moisture to keep her
from getting too dehydrated. She looked wonderful, with clear shiny blue eyes, clear
skin with good color, though she was slightly slimmer than when I had last seen her.
    I then administered Coca&apos;s Pulse Test (see the Appendix)
and quickly discovered Elizabeth was wildly intolerant to wheat and dairy products.
Following the well known health gurus of that time like Adelle Davis, I had self-righteously
been feeding her home-made whole wheat bread from hand-ground Organic wheat, and
home-made cultured yogurt from our own organically-fed goats. But by doing this I
had only maintained her insanity. Elizabeth was an intelligent young woman, and once
she understood what was causing her problems, she had no trouble completely eliminating
certain foods from her diet. She shuddered at the thought that had she not come to
my place and discovered the problem, she would probably have died on the back ward
of some institution for the chronically mentally ill.
    As for me, I will always be grateful to her for opening my
eyes and mind a little wider. Elizabeth&apos;s case showed me why Russian schizophrenics
put on a 30 day water fast had such a high recovery rate. I also remembered all the
esoteric books I had read extolling the benefits of fasting. I also remembered two
occasions during my own youth when I had eaten little or nothing for approximately
a month each without realizing that I was&quot;fasting.&quot;And doing this had
done me nothing but good.
    Once when I was thirteen my mother sent my&quot;little&quot;brother and I to a residential fundamentalist bible school. I did not want to go
there, although my brother did; he had decided he wanted to be a evangelical minister.
I hated bible school because I was allowed absolutely no independence of action.
We were required to attend church services three times a day during the week, and
five services on Sunday. As I became more and more unhappy, I ate less and less;
in short order I wasn&apos;t eating at all. The school administration became concerned
after I had dropped about 30 pounds in two months, notified my mother and sent me
home. I returned to at-home schooling. I also resumed eating.
    I fasted one other time for about a month when I was 21.
It happened because I had nothing to do while visiting my mother before returning
to University except help with housework and prepare meals. The food available in
the backwoods of central B.C. didn&apos;t appeal to me because it was mostly canned vegetables,
canned milk, canned moose meat and bear meat stews with lots of gravy and greasy
potatoes. I decided to pass on it altogether. I remember rather enjoying that time
as a fine rest and I left feeling very good ready to take on the world full force
ahead. At that time I didn&apos;t know there was such a thing as fasting, it just happened
that way.
    After Elizabeth went on her way, I decided to experimentally
fast myself. I consumed only water for two weeks. But I must have had counter intentions
to this fast because I found myself frequently having dreams about sugared plums,
and egg omelets, etc. And I didn&apos;t end up feeling much better after this fast was
over (although I didn&apos;t feel any worse either), because I foolishly broke the fast
with one of my dream omelets. And I knew better! Every book I&apos;d ever read on fasting
stated how important it is to break a fast gradually, eating only easy-to-digest
foods for days or weeks before resuming one&apos;s regular diet.
    From this experiment I painfully learned how important it
is to break a fast properly. Those eggs just didn&apos;t feel right, like I had an indigestible
stone in my belly. I felt very tired after the omelet, not energized one bit by the
food. I immediately cut back my intake to raw fruits and vegetables while the eggs
cleared out of my system. After a few days on raw food I felt okay, but I never did
regain the shine I had achieved just before I resumed eating.
    This is one of the many fine things about fasting, it allows
you to get in much better communication with your own body, so that you can hear
it when it objects to something you&apos;re putting in it or doing to it. It is not easy
to acquire this degree of sensitivity to your body unless you remove all food for
a sufficiently long period; this allows the body to get a word in edgewise that we
are willing and able to listen to. Even when we do hear the body protesting, we frequently
decide to turn a deaf ear, at least until the body starts producing severe pain or
some other symptom that we can&apos;t ignore.
    Within a few years after Elizabeth&apos;s cure I had handily repaired
quite a few mentally ill people in a harmless way no one had heard of; many new people
were knocking at my door wanting to be admitted to my drug free, home-based treatment
program. So many in fact that my ability to accommodate them was overwhelmed. I decided
that it was necessary to move to a larger facility and we bought an old, somewhat
run-down estate that I called Great Oaks School of Health because of the magnificent
oak trees growing in the front yard.
    At Great Oaks initially I continued working with psychotics,
employing fasting as a tool, especially in those cases with obvious food allergies
as identified by Coca&apos;s Pulse Test, because it only takes five days for a fasting
body to eliminate all traces of an allergic food substance and return to normal functioning.
If the person was so severely hypoglycemic that they were unable to tolerate a water
fast, an elimination diet (to be described in detail later) was employed, while stringently
avoiding all foods usually found to be allergy producing.
    I also decided that if I was going to employ fasting as my
primary medicine, it was important for me to have a more intense personal experience
with it, because in the process of reviewing the literature on fasting I saw that
there were many different approaches, each one staunchly defended by highly partisan
advocates. For example, the capital&quot;N&quot;Natural, capital&quot;H&quot;Hygienists, such a Herbert Shelton, aggressively assert that only a pure water fast
can be called a fast. Sheltonites contend that juice fasting as advocated by Paavo
Airola, for example, is not a fast but rather a modified diet without the benefits
of real fasting. Colon cleansing was another area of profound disagreement among
the authorities. Shelton strongly insisted that enemas and colonics should not be
employed; the juice advocates tend to strongly recommend intestinal cleansing.
    To be able to intelligently take a position in this maze
of conflict I decided to first try every system on myself. It seems to me that if
I can be said to really own anything in this life it is my own body, and I have the
absolute right to experiment with it as long as I&apos;m not irresponsible about important
things such as care of my kids. I also feel strongly that it was unethical to ask
anyone to do anything that I was not willing or able to do myself. Just imagine what
would happen if all medical doctors applied this principal in their practice of medicine,
if all surgeons did it too!
    I set out to do a complete and fully rigorous water fast
according to the Natural Hygiene model--only pure water and bed rest (with no colon
cleansing) until hunger returns, something the hygienists all assured me would happen
when the body had completed its detoxification process. The only aspect of a hygienic
fast I could not fulfill properly was the bed rest part; unfortunately I was in sole
charge of a busy holistic treatment center (and two little girls); there were things
I had to do, though I did my chores and duties at a very slow pace with many rest
periods.
    I water fasted for 42 days dropping from 135 pounds to 85
pounds on a 5&apos; 7&quot;frame. At the end I looked like a Nazi concentration camp
victim. I tended to hide when people came to the door, because the sight of all my
bones scared them to death. Despite my assurances visitors assumed I was trying to
commit suicide. In any case I persevered, watching my body change, observing my emotions,
my mental functioning, and my spiritual awareness. I thought, if Moses could fast
for 42 days so can I, even though the average length of a full water fast to skeletal
weight for a person that is not overweight is more in the order of 30 days. I broke
the fast with small amounts of carrot juice diluted 50/50 with water and stayed on
that regimen for two more weeks.
    After I resumed eating solid food it took six weeks to regain
enough strength to be able to run the same distance in the same time I had before
fasting, and it took me about six months to regain my previous weight. My eyes and
skin had become exceptionally clear, and some damaged areas of my body such as my
twice-broken shoulder had undergone considerable healing. I ate far smaller meals
after the fast, but food was so much more efficiently absorbed that I got a lot more
miles to the gallon from what I did eat. I also became more aware when my body did
not want me to eat something. After the fast, if I ignored my body&apos;s protest and
persisted, it would immediately create some unpleasant sensation that quickly persuaded
me to curb my appetite.
    I later experimented with other approaches to fasting, with
juice fasts, with colon cleansing, and began to establish my own eclectic approach
to fasting and detoxification, using different types of programs for different conditions
and adjusting for psychological tolerances. I&apos;ll have a lot more to say about fasting.
    After my own rigorous fasting experience I felt capable of
supervising extended fasts on very ill or very overweight people. Great Oaks was
gradually shifting from being a place that mentally ill people came to regain their
sanity to being a spa where anyone who wanted to improve their health could come
for a few days, some weeks or even a few months. It had been my observation from
the beginning that the mentally ill people in my program also improved remarkably
in physical health; it was obvious that my method was good for anyone. Even people
with good health could feel better.
    By this time I&apos;d also had enough of psychotic people anyway,
and longed for sane, responsible company.
    So people started to come to Great Oaks School of Health
to rest up from a demanding job, to drop some excess weight, and generally to eliminate
the adverse effects of destructive living and eating habits. I also began to get
cancer patients, ranging from those who had just been diagnosed and did not wish
to go the AMA-approved medical route of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, to
those with well-advanced cancer who had been sent home to die after receiving all
of the above treatments and were now ready to give alternative therapies a try since
they expected to die anyway. I also had a few people who were beyond help because
their vital organs had been so badly damaged that they knew they were dying, and
they wanted to die in peace without medical intervention, in a supportive hospice
cared for by people who could confront death.
    Great Oaks School was intentionally named a&quot;school&quot;of health partially to deflect the attentions of the AMA. It is, after all, entirely
legal to teach about how to maintain health, about how to prevent illness, and how
to go about making yourself well once you were sick. Education could not be called&quot;practicing medicine without a license.&quot;Great Oaks was also structured
as a school because I wanted to both learn and teach. Toward this end we started
putting out a holistic health newsletter and offering classes and seminars to the
public on various aspects of holistic health. From the early 1970s through the early
1980s I invited a succession of holistic specialists to reside at GOSH, or to teach
at Great Oaks while living elsewhere. These teachers not only provided a service
to the community, but they all became my teachers as well. I apprenticed myself to
each one in turn.
    There came and went a steady parade of alternative practitioners
of the healing arts and assorted forms of metapsychology: acupuncturists, acupressurists,
reflexologists, polarity therapists, massage therapists, postural integrationists,
Rolfers, Feldenkries therapists, neurolinguistic programmers, biokinesiologists,
iridologists, psychic healers, laying on of handsers, past life readers, crystal
therapists, toning therapists in the person of Patricia Sun, color therapy with lamps
and different colored lenses a la Stanley Bourroughs, Bach Flower therapists, aroma
therapists, herbalists, homeopaths, Tai Chi classes, yoga classes, Arica classes,
Guergieff and Ouspensky fourth-way study groups, EST workshops, Zen Meditation classes.
Refugee Lamas from Tibet gave lectures on The Book of the Dead and led meditation
and chanting sessions, and we held communication classes using Scientology techniques.
There were anatomy and physiology classes, classes on nutrition and the orthomolecular
approach to treating mental disorders (given by me of course); there were chiropractors
teaching adjustment techniques, even first aid classes. And we even had a few medical
doctors of the alternative ilk who were interested in life style changes as an approach
to maintaining health.
    Classes were also offered on colon health including herbs,
clays, enemas, and colonics. So many of my client at Great Oaks were demanding colonics
in conjunction with their cleansing programs, that I took time out to go to Indio,
Calif. to take a course in colon therapy from a chiropractor, and purchase a state
of the art colonic machine featuring all the gauges, electric water solenoids and
stainless steel knobs one could ask for.
    During this period almost all alternative therapists and
their specialties were very interesting to me, but I found that most of the approaches
they advocated did not suit my personality. For example, I think that acupuncture
is a very useful tool, but I personally did not want to use needles. Similarly I
thought that Rolfing was a very effective tool but I did not enjoy administering
that much pain, although a significant number of the clients really wanted pain.
Some of the techniques appealed to me in the beginning, and I used them frequently
with good results but over time I decided to abandon them, mostly because of a desire
to simplify and lighten up my bag of tricks.
    Because of my enthusiasm and successes Great Oaks kept on
growing. Originally the estate served as both the offices of the Holt Adoption Agency
and the Holt family mansion. The Holt family had consisted of Harry and Bertha Holt,
six of their biological children, and eight adopted Korean orphans. For this reason
the ten thousand square foot two story house had large common rooms, and lots and
lots of bedrooms. It was ideal for housing spa clients and my own family. The adjoining
Holt Adoption Agency office building was also very large with a multitude of rooms.
It became living space for those helpers and hangers-on we came to refer to as&quot;community
members.&quot;My first husband added even more to the physical plant constructing
a large, rustic gym and workshop.
    Many&quot;alternative&quot;people visited and then begged
to stay on with room and board provided in exchange for their work. A few of these
people made a significant contribution such as cooking, child care, gardening, tending
the ever-ravenous wood-fired boiler we used to keep the huge concrete mansion heated,
or doing general cleaning. But the majority of the &apos;work exchangers&apos; did not really
understand what work really was, or didn&apos;t have sufficient ethical presence to uphold
the principle of fair exchange, which is basically giving something of equal value
for getting something of value and, perhaps more importantly, giving in exchange
what is needed and asked for.
    I also found that community members, once in residence, were
very difficult to dislodge. My healing services were supporting far too much dead
wood. This was basically my own fault, my own poor management.
    Still, I learned a great deal from all of this waste. First
of all it is not a genuine service to another human being to give them something
for nothing. If a fair exchange is expected and received, positive ethical behavior
is strengthened, allowing the individual to maintain their self-respect. I also came
to realize what an important factor conducting one&apos;s life ethically is in the individual
healing process. Those patients who were out exchange in their relationships with
others in one or more areas of their life frequently did not get well until they
changed these behaviors.
    Toward the end of 1982, after providing a decade of services
to a great many clients, many of these in critical condition, I reached to point
where I was physically, mentally, and spiritually drained. I needed a vacation desperately
but no one, including my first husband, could run Great Oaks in my absence much less
cover the heavy mortgage. So I decided to sell it. This decision stunned the community
members and shocked the clientele who had become dependent on my services. I also
got a divorce at this time. In fact I went through quite a dramatic life change in
many areas--true to pattern, a classic mid-life crisis. All I kept from these years
was my two daughters, my life experiences, and far too many books from the enormous
Great Oaks library.
    These changes were however, necessary for my survival. Any
person who works with, yes, lives on a day-to-day basis with sick people and who
is constantly giving or outflowing must take time out to refill their vessel so that
they can give again. Failure to do this can result in a serious loss of health, or
death. Most healers are empathic people who feel other peoples&apos; pains and stresses
and sometimes have difficulty determining exactly what is their own personal &apos;baggage&apos;
and what belongs to the clients. This is especially difficult when the therapy involves
a lot of &apos;hands on&apos; techniques.
    After leaving Great Oaks it took me a couple of years to
rest up enough to want to resume practicing again. This time, instead of creating
a substantial institution, Steve, my second husband and my best friend, built a tiny
office next to our family home. I had a guest room that I would use for occasional
residential patients. Usually these were people I had known from Great Oaks days
or were people I particularly liked and wanted to help through a life crisis.
    At the time I am writing this book over ten years have passed
since I sold Great Oaks. I continue to have an active outpatient practice, preferring
to protect the privacy of my home and family life since I was remarried by limiting
inpatients to a special few who required more intensive care, and then, only one
at a time, and then, with long spells without a resident.


 Chapter Two 
 The Nature and Cause of Disease 


 From The Hygienic Dictionary 

 Toxemia. [1]&quot;Toxemia is the basic cause of all
so-called diseases. In the process of tissue-building (metabolism), there is cell-building
(anabolism) and cell destruction (catabolism). The broken-down tissue is toxic. In
the healthy body (when nerve energy is normal), this toxic material is eliminated
from the blood as fast as it is evolved. But when nerve energy is dissipated from
any cause (such as physical or mental excitement or bad habits) the body becomes
weakened or enervated. When the body is enervated, elimination is checked. This,
in turn, results in a retention of toxins in the blood--the condition which we speak
of as toxemia. This state produces a crisis which is nothing more than heroic or
extraordinary efforts by the body to eliminate waste or toxin from the blood. It
is this crisis which we term disease. Such accumulation of toxin when once established,
will continue until nerve energy has been restored to normal by removing the cause.
So-called disease is nature&apos;s effort to eliminate toxin from the blood. All so-called
diseases are crises of toxemia.&quot; John H. Tilden, M.D., Toxemia Explained. [2] Toxins are divided into two groups; namely exogenous, those formed in the alimentary
canal from fermentation and decomposition following imperfect or faulty digestion.
If the fermentation is of vegetables or fruit, the toxins are irritating, stimulating
and enervating, but not so dangerous or destructive to organic life as putrefaction,
which is a fermentation set up in nitrogenous matter--protein-bearing foods, but
particularly animal foods. Endogenous toxins are autogenerated. They are the waste
products of metabolism. Dr. John. H. Tilden, Impaired Health: Its Cause and Cure,
1921. 
 


    Suppose a fast-growing
city is having traffic jams.&quot;We don&apos;t like it!&quot;protest the voters.&quot;Why are these problems happening?&quot;asks the city council, trying to look like
they are doing something about it.
    Experts then proffer answers.&quot;Because there are too
many cars,&quot;says the Get A Horse Society. The auto makers suggest it is because
there are uncoordinated traffic lights and because almost all the businesses send
their employees home at the same time. Easy to fix! And no reason whatsoever to limit
the number of cars. The asphalt industry suggests it is because the size and amount
of roads is inadequate.
    What do we do then? Tax cars severely until few can afford
them? Legislate opening and closing hours of businesses to stagger to&apos;ing and fro&apos;ing?
Hire a smarter municipal highway engineer to synchronize the traffic lights? Build
larger and more efficient streets? Demand that auto companies make cars smaller so
more can fit the existing roads? Tax gasoline prohibitively, pass out and give away
free bicycles in virtually unlimited quantities while simultaneously building mass
rail systems? What? Which?
    When we settle on a solution we have simultaneously chosen
what we consider the real, underlying cause of the problem. If our chosen reason
was the real reason. then our solution results in a real cure. If we picked wrongly,
our attempt at solution may result in no cure, or create a worse situation than we
had before.
    The American Medical Association style of medicine (a philosophy
I will henceforth call allopathic) has a model that explains the causes of illness.
It suggests that anyone who is sick is a victim. Either they were attacked by a&quot;bad&quot;organism--virus, bacteria, yeast, pollen, cancer cell, etc.--or they have a&quot;bad&quot;organ--liver, kidney, gall bladder, even brain. Or, the victim may also have been
cursed by bad genes. In any case, the cause of the disease is not the person and
the person is neither responsible for creating their own complaint nor is the victim
capable of making it go away. This institutionalized irresponsibility seems useful
for both parties to the illness, doctor and patient. The patient is not required
to do anything about their complaint except pay (a lot) and obediently follow the
instructions of the doctor, submitting unquestioningly to their drugs and surgeries.
The physician then acquires a role of being considered vital to the survival of others
and thus obtains great status, prestige, authority, and financial remuneration.
    Perhaps because the sick person is seen to have been victimized,
and it is logically impossible to consider a victimizer as anything but something
evil, the physician&apos;s cure is often violent, confrontational. Powerful poisons are
used to rejigger body chemistry or to arrest the multiplication of disease bacteria
or to suppress symptoms; if it is possible to sustain life without them,&quot;bad,&quot;poorly-functioning organs are cut out.
    I&apos;ve had a lot of trouble with the medical profession. Over
the years doctors have made attempts to put me in jail and keep me in fear. But they
never stopped me. When I&apos;ve had a client die there has been an almost inevitable
coroner&apos;s investigation, complete with detectives and the sheriff. Fortunately, I
practice in rural Oregon, where the local people have a deeply-held belief in individual
liberty and where the authorities know they would have had a very hard time finding
a jury to convict me. Had I chosen to practice with a high profile and had I located
Great Oaks School of Health in a major market area where the physicians were able
to charge top dollar, I probably would have spent years behind bars as did other
heroes of my profession such as Linda Hazzard and Royal Lee.
    So I have acquired an uncomplimentary attitude about medical
doctors, a viewpoint I am going to share with you ungently, despite the fact that
doing so will alienate some of my readers. But I do so because most Americans are
entirely enthralled by doctors, and this doctor-god worship kills a lot of them.
    However, before I get started on the medicos, let me state
that one area exists where I do have fundamental admiration for allopathic medicine.
This is its handling of trauma. I agree that a body can become the genuine victim
of fast moving bullets. It can be innocently cut, smashed, burned, crushed and broken.
Trauma are not diseases and modern medicine has become quite skilled at putting traumatized
bodies back together. Genetic abnormality may be another undesirable physical condition
that is beyond the purview of natural medicine. However, the expression of contra-survival
genetics can often be controlled by nutrition. And the expression of poor genetics
often results from poor nutrition, and thus is similar to a degenerative disease
condition, and thus is well within the scope of natural medicine.
    Today&apos;s suffering American public is firmly in the AMA&apos;s
grip. People have been effectively prevented from learning much about medical alternatives,
have been virtually brainwashed by clever media management that portrays other medical
models as dangerous and/or ineffective. Legislation influenced by the allopathic
doctors&apos; union, the American Medical Association, severely limits or prohibits the
practice of holistic health. People are repeatedly directed by those with authority
to an allopathic doctor whenever they have a health problem, question or confusion.
Other types of healers are considered to be at best harmless as long as they confine
themselves to minor complaints; at worst, when naturopaths, hygienists, or homeopaths
seek to treat serious disease conditions they are called quacks, accused of unlicensed
practice of medicine and if they persist or develop a broad, successful, high-profile
and (this is the very worst) profitable practice, they are frequently jailed.
    Even licensed MDs are crushed by the authorities if they
offer non-standard treatments. So when anyone seeks an alternative health approach
it is usually because their complaint has already failed to vanish after consulting
a whole series of allopathic doctors. This highly unfortunate kind of sufferer not
only has a degenerative condition to rectify, they may have been further damaged
by harsh medical treatments and additionally, they have a considerable amount of
brainwashing to overcome.
    The AMA has succeeded at making their influence over information
and media so pervasive that most people do not even realize that the doctors&apos; union
is the source of their medical outlook. Whenever an American complains of some malady,
a concerned and honestly caring friend will demand to know have they yet consulted
a medical doctor. Failure to do so on one&apos;s own behalf is considered highly irresponsible.
Concerned relatives of seriously ill adults who decline standard medical therapy
may, with a great show of self-righteousness, have the sick person judged mentally
incompetent so that treatment can be forced upon them. When a parent fails to seek
standard medical treatment for their child, the adult may well be found guilty of
criminal negligence, raising the interesting issue of who&quot;owns&quot;the child,
the parents or the State.
    It is perfectly acceptable to die while under conventional
medical care. Happens all the time, in fact. But holistic alternatives are represented
as stupidly risky, especially for serious conditions such as cancer. People with
cancer see no choice but to do chemotherapy, radiation, and radical surgery because
this is the current allopathic medical approach. On some level people may know that
these remedies are highly dangerous but they have been told by their attending oncologist
that violent therapies are their only hope of survival, however poor that may be.
If a cancer victim doesn&apos;t proceed immediately with such treatment their official
prognosis becomes worse by the hour. Such scare tactics are common amongst the medical
profession, and they leave the recipient so terrified that they meekly and obediently
give up all self-determinism, sign the liability waiver, and submit, no questions
asked. Many then die after suffering intensely from the therapy, long before the
so-called disease could have actually caused their demise. I will later offer alternative
and frequently successful (but not guaranteed) approaches to treating cancer that
do not require the earliest-possible detection, surgery or poisons.
    If holistic practitioners were to apply painful treatments
like allopaths use, ones with such poor statistical outcomes like allopaths use,
there would most certainly be witch hunts and all such irresponsible, greedy quacks
would be safely imprisoned. I find it highly ironic that for at least the past twenty
five hundred years the basic principle of good medicine has been that the treatment
must first do no harm. This is such an obvious truism that even the AMA doctors pledge
to do the same thing when they take the Hippocratic Oath. Yet virtually every action
taken by the allopath is a conscious compromise between the potential harm of the
therapy and its potential benefit.
    In absolute contrast, if a person dies while on a natural
hygiene program, they died because their end was inevitable no matter what therapy
was attempted. Almost certainly receiving hygienic therapy contributed to making
their last days far more comfortable and relatively freer of pain without using opiates.
I have personally taken on clients sent home to die after they had suffered everything
the doctors could do to them, told they had only a few days, weeks, or months to
live. Some of these clients survived as a result of hygienic programs even at that
late date. And some didn&apos;t. The amazing thing was that any of them survived at all,
because the best time to begin a hygienic program is as early in the degenerative
process as possible, not after the body has been drastically weakened by invasive
and toxic treatments. Later on, I&apos;ll tell you about some of these cases.
    Something I consider especially ironic is that when the patient
of a medical doctor dies, it is inevitably thought that the blessed doctor did all
that could be done; rarely is any blame laid. If the physician was especially careless
or stupid, their fault can only result in a civil suit, covered by malpractice insurance.
But let a holistic practitioner treat a sick person and have that person follow any
of their suggestions or take any natural remedies and have that person die or worsen
and it instantly becomes the natural doctor&apos;s fault. Great blame is placed and the
practitioner faces inquests, grand juries, manslaughter charges, jail time and civil
suits that can&apos;t be insured against.
    Allopathic medicine rarely makes a connection between the
real causes of a degenerative or infectious disease and its cure. The causes are
usually considered mysterious: we don&apos;t know why the pancreas is acting up, etc.
The sick are sympathized with as victims who did nothing to contribute to their condition.
The cure is a highly technical battle against the illness, whose weapons are defined
in Latin and far beyond the understanding of a layperson.
    Hygienic medicine presents an opposite view. To the naturopath,
illness is not a perplexing and mysterious occurrence over which you have no control
or understanding. The causes of disease are clear and simple, the sick person is
rarely a victim of circumstance and the cure is obvious and within the competence
of a moderately intelligent sick person themselves to understand and help administer.
In natural medicine, disease is a part of living that you are responsible for, and
quite capable of handling.
    Asserting that the sick are pitiable victims is financially
beneficial to doctors. It makes medical intervention seem a vital necessity for every
ache and pain. It makes the sick become dependent. I&apos;m not implying that most doctors
knowingly are conniving extortionists. Actually most medical doctors are genuinely
well-intentioned. I&apos;ve also noticed that most medical doctors are at heart very timid
individuals who consider that possession of a MD degree and license proves that they
are very important, proves them to be highly intelligent, even makes them fully qualified
to pontificate on many subjects not related to medicine at all.
    Doctors obtain an enormous sense of self-importance at medical
school, where they proudly endured the high pressure weeding out of any free spirit
unwilling to grind away into the night for seven or more years. Anyone incapable
of absorbing and regurgitating huge amounts of rote information; anyone with a disrespectful
or irreverent attitude toward the senior doctor-gods who arrogantly serve as med
school professors, anyone like this was eliminated with especial rapidity. When the
thoroughly submissive, homogenized survivors are finally licensed, they assume the
status of junior doctor-gods.
    But becoming an official medical deity doesn&apos;t permit one
to create their own methods. No no, the AMA&apos;s professional oversight and control
system makes continued possession of the license to practice (and the high income
that usually comes with it) entirely dependent on continued conformity to what is
defined by the AMA as&quot;correct practice.&quot;Any doctor who innovates beyond
strict limits or uses non-standard treatments is in real danger of losing their livelihood
and status.
    Not only are licensed graduates of AMA-sanctioned medical
schools kept on a very tight leash, doctors of other persuasions who use other methods
to heal the sick or help them heal themselves are persecuted and prosecuted. Extension
of the AMA&apos;s control through regulatory law and police power is justified in the
name of preventing quackery and making sure the ignorant and gullible public receives
only scientifically proven effective medical care.
    Those on the other side of the fence view the AMA&apos;s oppression
as an effective way to make sure the public has no real choices but to use union
doctors, pay their high fees and suffer greatly by misunderstanding of the true cause
of disease and its proper cure. If there are any actual villains responsible for
this suppressive tragedy some of them are to be found in the inner core of the AMA,
officials who may perhaps fully and consciously comprehend the suppressive system
they promulgate.
    Hygienists usually inform the patient quite clearly and directly
that the practitioner has no ability to heal them or cure their condition and that
no doctor of any type actually is able to heal. Only the body can heal itself, something
it is eager and usually very able to do if only given the chance. One pithy old saying
among hygienists goes,&quot;if the body can&apos;t heal itself, nothing can heal it.&quot;The primary job of the hygienic practitioner is to reeducate the patient by conducting
them through their first natural healing process. If this is done well the sick person
learns how to get out of their own body&apos;s way and permit its native healing power
to manifest. Unless later the victim of severe traumatic injury, never again will
that person need obscenely expensive medical procedures. Hygienists rarely make six
figure incomes from regular, repeat business.
    This aspect of hygienic medicine makes it different than
almost all the others, even most other holistic methods. Hygiene is the only system
that does not interpose the assumed healing power of a doctor between the patient
and wellness. When I was younger and less experienced I thought that the main reason
traditional medical practice did not stress the body&apos;s own healing power and represented
the doctor as a necessary intervention was for profit. But after practicing for over
twenty years I now understand that the last thing most people want to hear is that
their own habits, especially their eating patterns and food choices, are responsible
for their disease and that their cure is to only be accomplished through dietary
reform, which means unremittingly applied self-discipline.
    One of the hardest things to ask of a person is to change
a habit. The reason that AMA doctors have most of the patients is they&apos;re giving
the patients exactly what they want, which is to be allowed to continue in their
unconscious irresponsibility.

 The Cause Of Disease 
    Ever since natural medicine arose in opposition to the violence
of so-called scientific medicine, every book on the subject of hygiene, once it gets
past its obligatory introductions and warm ups, must address The Cause of Disease.
This is a required step because we see the cause of disease and its consequent cure
in a very different manner than the allopath. Instead of many causes, we see one
basic reason why. Instead of many unrelated cures, we have basically one approach
to fix all ills that can be fixed.
    A beautiful fifty cent word that means a system for explaining
something is paradigm, pronounced para-dime. I am fond of this word because it admits
the possibility of many differing yet equally true explanations for the same reality.
Of all available paradigms, Natural Hygiene suits me best and has been the one I&apos;ve
used for most of my career.
    The Natural Hygienist&apos;s paradigm for the cause of both degenerative
and infectious disease is called the Theory of Toxemia, or&quot;self-poisoning.&quot;
    Before explaining this theory it will help many readers if
I digress a brief moment about the nature and validity of alternative paradigms.
Not too many decades ago, scientists thought that reality was a singular, real, perpetual--that
Natural Law existed much as a tree or a rock existed. In physics, for example, the
mechanics of Newton were considered capital&quot;T&quot;True, the only possible
paradigm. Any other view, not being True, was False. There was capital&quot;N&quot;natural capital&quot;L&quot;law.
    More recently, great uncertainty has entered science; it
has become indisputable that a theory or explanation of reality is only true only
to the degree it seems to work; conflicting or various explanations can all work,
all can be&quot;true.&quot;At least, this uncertainty has overtaken the hard, physical
sciences. It has not yet done so with medicine. The AMA is convinced (or is working
hard to convince everyone else) that its paradigm, the allopathic approach, is Truth,
is scientific, and therefore, anything else is Falsehood, is irresponsibility, is
a crime against the sick.
    But the actual worth or truth of any paradigm is found not
in its&quot;reality,&quot;but in its utility. Does an explanation or theory allow
a person to manipulate experience and create a desired outcome. To the extent a paradigm
does that, it can be considered valuable. Judged by this standard, the Theory of
Toxemia must be far truer than the hodgepodge of psuedoscience taught in medical
schools. Keep that in mind the next time some officious medical doctor disdainfully
informs you that Theory of Toxemia was disproven in 1927 by Doctors Jeckel and Hyde.

 Why People Get Sick 
    This is the Theory of Toxemia. A healthy body struggles continually
to purify itself of poisons that are inevitably produced while going about its business
of digesting food, moving about, and repairing itself. The body is a marvelous creation,
a carbon, oxygen combustion machine, constantly burning fuel, disposing of the waste
products of combustion, and constantly rebuilding tissue by replacing worn out, dead
cells with new, fresh ones. Every seven years virtually every cell in the body is
replaced, some types of cells having a faster turnover rate than others, which means
that over a seven year period several hundred pounds of dead cells must be digested
(autolyzed) and eliminated. All by itself this would be a lot of waste disposal for
the body to handle. Added to that waste load are numerous mild poisons created during
proper digestion. And added to that can be an enormous burden of waste products created
as the body&apos;s attempts to digest the indigestible, or those tasty items I&apos;ve heard
called&quot;fun food.&quot;Add to that burden the ruinous effects of just plain
overeating.
    The waste products of digestion, of indigestion, of cellular
breakdown and the general metabolism are all poisonous to one degree or another.
Another word for this is toxic. If these toxins were allowed to remain and accumulate
in the body, it would poison itself and die in agony. So the body has a processing
system to eliminate toxins. And when that system does break down the body does die
in agony, as from liver or kidney failure.
    The organs of detoxification remove things from the body&apos;s
system, but these two vital organs should not be confused with what hygienists call
the secondary organs of elimination, such as the large intestine, lungs, bladder
and the skin, because none of these other eliminatory organs are supposed to purify
the body of toxins. But when the body is faced with toxemia, the secondary organs
of elimination are frequently pressed into this duty and the consequences are the
symptoms we call illness.
    The lungs are supposed to eliminate only carbon dioxide gas;
not self-generated toxic substances. The large intestine is supposed to pass only
insoluble food solids (and some nasty stuff dumped into the small intestine by the
liver). Skin eliminates in the form of sweat (which contains mineral salts) to cool
the body, but the skin is not supposed to move toxins outside the system. But when
toxins are flowed out through secondary organs of elimination these areas become
inflamed, irritated, weakened. The results can be skin irritations, sinusitis or
a whole host of other&quot;itises&quot;depending on the area involved, bacterial
or viral infections, asthma. When excess toxemia is deposited instead of eliminated,
the results can be arthritis if toxins are stored in joints, rheumatism if in muscle
tissues, cysts and benign tumors. And if toxins weaken the body&apos;s immune response,
cancer.
    The liver and the kidneys, the two heroic organs of detoxification,
are the most important ones; these jointly act as filters to purify the blood. Hygienists
pay a lot of attention to these organs, the liver especially.
    In an ideal world, the liver and kidneys would keep up with
their job for 80 years or more before even beginning to tire. In this ideal world,
the food would of course, be very nutritious and free of pesticide residues, the
air and water would be pure, people would not denature their food and turn it into
junk. In this perfect world everyone would get moderate exercise into old age, and
live virtually without stress. In this utopian vision, the average healthy productive
life span would approach a century, entirely without using food supplements or vitamins.
In this world doctors would have next to no work other than repairing traumatic injuries,
because everyone would be healthy. But this is not the way it is.
    In our less-than-ideal world virtually everything we eat
is denatured, processed, fried, salted, sweetened, preserved; thus more stress is
placed on the liver and kidneys than nature designed them to handle. Except for a
few highly fortunate individuals blessed with an incredible genetic endowment that
permits them to live to age 99 on moose meat, well-larded white flour biscuits, coffee
with evaporated milk and sugar, brandy and cigarettes (we&apos;ve all heard of someone
like this), most peoples&apos; liver and kidneys begin to break down prematurely. Thus
doctoring has become a financially rewarding profession.
    Most people overburden their organs of elimination by eating
whatever they feel like eating whenever they feel like it. Or, they irresponsibly
eat whatever is served to them by a mother, wife, institution or cook because doing
so is easy or expected. Eating is a very habitual and unconscious activity; frequently
we continue to eat as adults whatever our mother fed us as a child. I consider it
unsurprising that when people develop the very same disease conditions as their parents.
they wrongly assume the cause is genetic inheritance, when actually it was just because
they were putting their feet under the same table as their parents.
    Toxemia also comes about from following the wrongheaded recommendations
of allopathic-inspired nutritional texts and licensed dietitians. For example, people
believe they should eat one food from each of the four so-called basic food groups
at each meal, thinking they are doing the right thing for their health by having
four colors of food on every plate, when they really aren&apos;t. What they have actually
done is force their bodies to attempt the digestion of indigestible food combinations,
and the resulting indigestion creates massive doses of toxins. I&apos;ll have a lot more
to say about that later when I discuss the art of food combining.


 Table 1: The Actual Food Groups* Starches Proteins Fats Sugars Watery Vegetables bread meats butter honey zucchini potatoes eggs oils fruit green beans noodles fish lard sugar tomatoes manioc/yuca most nuts nuts molassas peppers baked goods dry beans avocado malt syrup eggplant grains nut butters   maple syrup radish winter squash split peas   dried fruit rutabaga parsnips lentils   melons turnips sweet potatoes soybeans   carrot juice Brussels sprouts yams tofu   beet juice celery taro root tempeh     cauliflower plantains wheat grass juice     broccoli beets &quot;green&quot;drinks     okra   spirulina     lettuce   algae     endive   yeast     cabbage   dairy     carrots 

 * Standard dietitians divide our foods into four basic food groups
and recommend the ridiculous practice of mixing them at every meal. This guarantees
indigestion and lots of business for the medical profession. This chart illustrates
the actual food groups. It is usually a poor practice to mix different foods from
one group with those from another. 


 The Digestive Process 
    After we have eaten our four-color meal--often we do this
in a hurry, without much chewing, under a lot of stress, or in the presence of negative
emotions--we give no thought to what becomes of our food once it has been swallowed.
We have been led to assume that anything put in the mouth automatically gets digested
flawlessly, is efficiently absorbed into the body where it nourishes our cells, with
the waste products being eliminated completely by the large intestine. This vision
of efficiency may exist in the best cases but for most there is many a slip between
the table and the toilet. Most bodies are not optimally efficient at performing all
the required functions, especially after years of poor living habits, stress, fatigue,
and aging. To the Natural Hygienist, most disease begins and ends with our food;
most of our healing efforts are focused on improving the process of digestion.
    Digestion means chemically changing the foods we eat into
substances that can pass into the blood stream and circulate through the body where
nutrition is used for bodily functions. Our bodies use nutritional substances for
fuel, for repair and rebuilding, and to conduct an incredibly complex biochemistry.
Scientists are still busily engaged in trying to understand the chemical mysteries
of our bodies. But as bewildering as the chemistry of life is, the chemistry of digestion
itself is actually a relatively simple process, and one doctors have had a fairly
good understanding of for many decades.
    Though relatively straightforward, a lot can and does go
wrong with digestion. The body breaks down foods with a series of different enzymes
that are mixed with food at various points as it passes from mouth to stomach to
small intestine. An enzyme is a large, complex molecule that has the ability to chemically
change other large, complex molecules without being changed itself. Digestive enzymes
perform relatively simple functions--breaking large molecules into smaller parts
that can dissolve in water.
    Digestion starts in the mouth when food is mixed with ptyalin,
an enzyme secreted by the salivary glands. Pylatin converts insoluble starches into
simple sugars. If the digestion of starchy foods is impaired, the body is less able
to extract the energy contained in our foods, while far worse from the point of view
of the genesis of diseases, undigested starches pass through the stomach and into
the gut where they ferment and thereby create an additional toxic burden for the
liver to process. And fermenting starches also create gas.
    As we chew our food it gets mixed with saliva; as we continue
to chew the starches in the food are converted into sugar. There is a very simple
experiment you can conduct to prove to yourself how this works. Get a plain piece
of bread, no jam, no butter, plain, and without swallowing it or allowing much of
it to pass down the throat, begin to chew it until it seems to literally dissolve.
Pylatin works fast in our mouths so you may be surprised at how sweet the taste gets.
As important as chewing is, I have only run into about one client in a hundred that
actually makes an effort to consciously chew their food.
    Horace Fletcher, whose name has become synonymous with the
importance of chewing food well (Fletcherizing), ran an experiment on a military
population in Canada. He required half his experimental group to chew thoroughly,
and the other half to gulp things down as usual,. His study reports significant improvement
in the overall health and performance of the group that persistently chewed. Fletcher&apos;s
report recommended that every mouthful be chewed 50 times for half a minute before
being swallowed. Try it, you might be very surprised at what a beneficial effect
such a simple change in your approach to eating can make. Not only will you have
less intestinal gas, if overweight you will probably find yourself getting smaller
because your blood sugar will elevate quicker as you are eating and thus your sense
of hunger will go away sooner. If you are very thin and have difficulty gaining weight
you may find that the pounds go on easier because chewing well makes your body more
capable of actually assimilating the calories you are consuming.
    A logical conclusion from this data is that anything that
would prevent or reduce chewing would be unhealthful. For example, food eaten when
too hot tends to be gulped down. The same tends to happen when food is seasoned with
fresh Jalapeño or habaneo peppers. People with poor teeth should blend or mash
starchy foods and then gum them thoroughly to mix them with saliva. Keep in mind
that even so-called protein foods such as beans often contain large quantities of
starches and the starch portion of protein foods is also digested in the mouth.
    Once the food is in the stomach, it is mixed with hydrochloric
acid, secreted by the stomach itself, and pepsin, an enzyme. Together these break
proteins down into water-soluble amino acids. To accomplish this the stomach muscles
agitate the food continuously, somewhat like a washing machine. This extended churning
forms a kind of ball in the stomach called a bolis.
    Many things can and frequently do go wrong at this stage
of the digestive process. First, the stomach&apos;s very acid environment inactivates
pylatin, so any starch not converted to sugar in the mouth does not get properly
processed thereafter. And the most dangerous misdigetion comes from the sad fact
that cooked proteins are relatively indigestible no matter how strong the constitution,
no matter how concentrated the stomach acid or how many enzymes present. It is quite
understandable to me that people do not wish to accept this fact. After all, cooked
proteins are so delicious, especially cooked red meats and the harder, more flavorful
fishes.
    To appreciate this, consider how those enzymes that digest
proteins work. A protein molecule is a large, complex string of amino acids, each
linked to the next in a specific order. Suppose there are only six amino acids: 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So a particular (imaginary) protein could be structured: 1, 4,
4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, etc. Thus you should see that by combining
a limited number of amino acids there can be a virtually infinite number of proteins.
    But proteins are rarely water soluble. As I said a few paragraphs
back, digestion consists of rendering insoluble foods into water-soluble substances
so they can pass into the blood stream and be used by the body&apos;s chemistry. To make
them soluble, enzymes break down the proteins, separating the individual amino acids
one from the other, because amino acids are soluble. Enzymes that digest proteins
work as though they are mirror images of a particular amino acid. They fit against
a particular amino acid like a key fits into a lock. Then they break the bonds holding
that amino acid to others in the protein chain, and then, what I find so miraculous
about this process, the enzyme is capable of finding yet another amino acid to free,
and then yet another.
    So with sufficient churning in an acid environment, with
enough time (a few hours), and enough enzymes, all the recently eaten proteins are
decomposed into amino acids and these amino acids pass into the blood where the body
recombines them into structures it wants to make. And we have health. But when protein
chains are heated, the protein structures are altered into physical shapes that the
enzymes can&apos;t&quot;latch&quot;on to. The perfect example of this is when an egg
is fried. The eggwhite is albumen, a kind of protein. When it is heated, it shrivels
up and gets hard. While raw and liquid, it is easily digestable. When cooked, largely
indigestable.
    Stress also inhibits the churning action in the stomach so
that otherwise digestible foods may not be mixed efficiently with digestive enzymes.
For all these reasons, undigested proteins may pass into the gut.
    Along with undigested starches. When starches convert best
to sugars under the alkaline conditions found in the mouth. Once they pass into the
acid stomach starch digestion is not as efficient. If starches reach the small intestine
they are fermented by yeasts. The products of starch fermentation are only mildly
toxic. The gases produced by yeast fermentations usually don&apos;t smell particularly
bad; bodies that regularly contain starch fermentation usually don&apos;t smell particularly
bad either. In otherwise healthy people it can take many years of exposure to starch
fermentation toxins to produce a life-threatening disease.
    But undigested proteins aren&apos;t fermented by yeasts, they
putrefy in the gut (are attacked by anaerobic bacteria). Many of the waste products
of anaerobic putrefaction are highly toxic and evil smelling; when these toxins are
absorbed through the small or large intestines they are very irritating to the mucous
membranes, frequently contributing to or causing cancer of the colon. Protein putrefaction
may even cause psychotic symptoms in some individuals. Meat eaters often have a very
unpleasant body odor even when they are not releasing intestinal gasses.
    Adding a heavy toxic burden from misdigested foods to the
normal toxic load a body already has to handle creates a myriad of unpleasant symptoms,
and greatly shortens life. But misdigestion also carries with it a double whammy;
fermenting and/or putrefying foods immediately interfere with the functioning of
another vital organ--the large intestine--and cause constipation.
    Most people don&apos;t know what the word constipation really
means. Not being able to move one&apos;s bowels is only the most elementary type of constipation.
A more accurate definition of constipation is&quot;the retention of waste products
in the large intestine beyond the time that is conducive to health.&quot;Properly
digested food is not sticky and exits the large intestine quickly. But improperly
digested food (or indigestible food) gradually coats the large intestine, making
an ever-thicker lining that interferes with the intestine&apos;s functioning. Far worse,
this coating steadily putrefies, creating additional highly-potent toxins. Lining
the colon with undigested food can be compared to the mineral deposits filling in
the inside of an old water pipe, gradually choking off the flow. In the colon, this
deposit can become rock-hard, just like water pipe scale.
    Since the large intestine is also an organ that removes moisture
and water-soluble minerals from the food and moves them into the blood stream, when
the large intestine is lined with putrefying undigested food waste, the toxins of
this putrefaction are also steadily moved into the bloodstream and place an even
greater burden on the liver and kidneys, accelerating their breakdown, accelerating
the aging process and contributing to a lot of interesting and unpleasant symptoms
that keep doctors busy and financially solvent. I&apos;ll have quite a bit more to say
about colon cleansing later.

 The Progress Of Disease: Irritation, Enervation, Toxemia 
    Disease routinely lies at the end of a three-part chain that
goes: irritation or sub-clinical malnutrition, enervation, toxemia. Irritations are
something the person does to themselves or something that happens around them. Stresses,
in other words.
    Mental stressors include strong negative emotional states
such as anger, fear, resentment, hopelessness, etc. Behind most diseases it is common
to find a problematic mind churning in profound confusion, one generated by a character
that avoids responsibility. There may also be job stress or ongoing hostile relationships,
often within the family.
    Indigestible foods and misdigestion are also stressful irritations,
as are mild recreational poisons such as&quot;soft&quot;drugs, tobacco and alcohol.
Opiates are somewhat more toxifying, primarily because they paralyze the gut and
induce profound constipation. Stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines are the most
damaging recreational drugs ; these are highly toxic and rapidly shorten life.
    Repeated irritations and/or malnutrition eventually produce
enervation. The old-time hygienists defined enervation as a lack of or decline in
an unmeasurable phenomena,&quot;nerve energy.&quot;They viewed the functioning
of vital organs as being controlled by or driven by nerve force, sometimes called
life force orélan vital. Whatever this vital force actually is, it can be observed
and subjectively measured by comparing one person with another. Some people are full
of it and literally sparkle with overflowing energy. Beings like this make everyone
around them feel good because they somehow momentarily give energy to those endowed
with less. Others possess very little and dully plod through life.
    As vital force drops, the overall efficiency of all the body&apos;s
organs correspondingly decline. The pancreas creates less digestive enzymes; the
thymus secretes less of its vital hormones that mobilize the immune system; the pituitary
makes less growth hormone so the overall repair and rebuilding of cells and tissues
slows correspondingly; and so forth. It does not really matter if there is or is
not something called nerve energy that can or cannot be measured in a laboratory.
Vital force is observable to many people. However, it is measurable by laboratory
test that after repeated irritation the overall functioning of the essential organs
and glands does deteriorate.
    Enervation may develop so gradually that it progresses below
the level of awareness of the person, or times of increased enervation can be experienced
as a complaint--as a lack of energy, as tiredness, as difficulties digesting, as
a new inability to handle a previously-tolerated insult like alcohol.
    Long-term consumption of poor-quality food causes enervation.
The body is a carbon/oxygen engine designed to run efficiently only on highly nutritious
food and this aspect of human genetic programming cannot be changed significantly
by adaptation. Given enough generations a human gene pool can adapt to extracting
its nutrition from a different group of foods. For example, a group of isolated Fijians
currently enjoying long healthy lives eating a diet of seafoods and tropical root
crops could suddenly be moved to the highlands of Switzerland and forced to eat the
local fare or starve. But most of the Fijians would not have systems adept at making
those enzymes necessary to digest cows milk. So the transplanted Fijians would experience
many generations of poorer health and shorter life spans until their genes had been
selected for adaptation to the new dietary. Ultimately their descendants could become
uniformly healthy on rye bread and dairy products just like the highland Swiss were.
    However, modern industrial farming and processing of foodstuffs
significantly contributes to mass, widespread enervation in two ways. Humans will
probably adjust to the first; the second will, I&apos;m sure, prove insurmountable. First,
industrially processed foods are a recent invention and our bodies have not yet adapted
to digesting them. In a few more generations humans might be able to accomplish that
and public health could improve on factory food. In the meanwhile, the health of
humans has declined. Industrially farmed foods have also been lowered in nutritional
content compared to what food could be. I gravely doubt if any biological organism
can ever adapt to an overall dietary that contains significantly lowered levels of
nutrition. I will explain this more fully in the chapter on diet.

 Secondary Eliminations Are Disease 
    However the exact form the chain from irritation or malnutrition
to enervation progresses, the ultimate result is an increased level of toxemia, placing
an eliminatory burden on the liver and kidneys in excess of their ability. Eventually
these organs begin to weaken. Decline of liver and/or kidney function threatens the
stability and purity of blood chemistry. Rather than risk complete incapacitation
or death from self-poisoning, the overloaded, toxic body, guided by its genetic predisposition
and the nature of the toxins (what was eaten, in what state of stress), cleverly
channels surplus toxins into its first line of defense--alternative or secondary
elimination systems.
    Most non-life-threatening yet highly annoying disease conditions
originate as secondary eliminations. For example, the skin was designed to sweat,
elimination of fluids. Toxemia is often pushed out the sweat glands and is recognized
as an unpleasant body odor. A healthy, non-toxic body smells sweet and pleasant (like
a newborn baby&apos;s body) even after exercise when it has been sweating heavily. Other
skin-like organs such as the sinus tissues, were designed to secrete small amounts
of mucus for lubrication. The lungs eliminate used air and the tissues are lubricated
with mucus-like secretions too. These secretions are types of eliminations, but are
not intended for the elimination of toxins. When toxins are discharged in mucus through
tissues not designed to handle them, the tissues themselves become irritated, inflamed,
weakened and thus much more subject to bacterial or viral infection. Despite this
danger, not eliminating surplus toxins carries with it the greater penalty of serious
disability or death. Because of this liability, the body, in its wisdom, initially
chooses secondary elimination routes as far from vital tissues and organs as possible.
Almost inevitably the skin or skin-like mucus membranes such as the sinuses, or lung
tissues become the first line of defense.
    Thus the average person&apos;s disease history begins with colds,
flu, sinusitis, bronchitis, chronic cough, asthma, rashes, acne, eczema, psoriasis.
If these secondary eliminations are suppressed with drugs (either from the medical
doctor or with over the counter remedies), if the eating or lifestyle habits that
created the toxemia are not changed, or if the toxic load increases beyond the limits
of this technique, the body then begins to store toxins in fat or muscle tissues
or the joint cavities, overburdens the kidneys, creates cysts, fibroids, and benign
tumors to store those toxins. If toxic overload continues over a longer time the
body will eventually have to permit damages to vital tissues, and life-threatening
conditions develop.
    Hygienic doctors always stress that disease is remedial effort.
Illness comes from the body&apos;s best attempt to lighten its toxic load without immediately
threatening its survival. The body always does the very best it can to remedy toxemia
given its circumstances, and it should be commended for these efforts regardless
of how uncomfortable they might be to the person inhabiting the body. Symptoms of
secondary elimination are actually a positive thing because they are the body&apos;s efforts
to lessen a dangerously toxic condition. Secondary eliminations shouldn&apos;t be treated
immediately with a drug to suppress the process. If you squelch the bodies best and
least-life-threatening method to eliminate toxins, the body will ultimately have
to resort to another more dangerous though probably less immediately uncomfortable
channel.
    The conventional medical model does not view disease this
way and sees the symptoms of secondary elimination as the disease itself. So the
conventional doctor takes steps to halt the body&apos;s remedial efforts, thus stopping
the undesirable symptom and then, the symptom gone, proclaims the patient cured.
Actually, the disease is the cure.
    A common pattern of symptom suppression under the contemporary
medical model is this progression: treat colds with antihistamines until the body
gets influenza; suppress a flu repeatedly with antibiotics and eventually you get
pneumonia. Or, suppress eczema with cortisone ointment repeatedly, and eventually
you develop kidney disease. Or, suppress asthma with bronkiodialators and eventually
you need cortisone to suppress it. Continue treating asthma with steroids and you
destroy the adrenals; now the body has become allergic to virtually everything.
    The presence of toxins in an organ of secondary elimination
is frequently the cause of infection. Sinuses and lungs, inflamed by secondary eliminations,
are attacked by viruses or bacteria; infectious diseases of the skin result from
pushing toxins out of the skin. More generalized infections also result from toxemia;
in this case the immune system has become compromised and the body is overwhelmed
by an organism that it normally should be able to resist easily. The wise cure of
infections is not to use antibiotics to suppress the bacteria while simultaneously
whipping the immune system; most people, including most medical doctors, do not realize
that antibiotics also goose the immune system into super efforts. But when one chooses
to whip a tired horse, eventually the exhausted animal collapses and cannot rise
again no matter how vigorously it is beaten. The wise cure is to detoxify the body,
a step that simultaneously eliminates secondary eliminations and rebuilds the immune
system.
    The wise way to deal with the body&apos;s eliminative efforts
is to accept that disease is an opportunity to pay the piper for past indiscretions.
You should go to bed, rest, and drink nothing but water or dilute juice until the
condition has passed. This allows the body to conserve its vital energy, direct this
energy toward healing the disordered body part, and catch up on its waste disposal.
In this way you can help your body, be in harmony with its efforts instead of working
against it which is what most people do.
    Please forgive another semi-political polemic here, but in
my practice I have often been amazed to hear my clients complain that they have not
the time nor the ability to be patient with their body, to rest it through an illness
because they have a job they can&apos;t afford to miss or responsibilities they can&apos;t
put down. This is a sad commentary on the supposed wealth and prosperity of the United
States. In our country most people are enslaved by their debts, incurred because
they had been enthralled by the illusion of happiness secured by the possession of
material things. Debt slaves believe they cannot miss a week of work. People who
feel they can&apos;t afford to be sick think they can afford to live on pills. So people
push through their symptoms by sheer grit for years on end, and keep that up until
their exhausted horse of a body breaks down totally and they find themselves in the
hospital running up bills to the tune of several thousand dollars a day. But these
very same people do not think they can afford the loss of a few hundred dollars of
current income undertaking some virtually harmless preventative maintenance on their
bodies.
    Given half a chance the body will throw off toxic overburdens
and cleanse itself. And once the body has been cleansed of toxemia, disagreeable
symptoms usually cease. This means that to make relatively mild but unwanted symptoms
lessen and ultimately stop it is merely necessary to temporarily cut back food intake,
eating only what does not cause toxemia. These foods I classify as cleansing, such
as raw fruits and vegetables and their juices. If the symptoms are extreme, are perceived
as overwhelming or are actually life-threatening, detoxification can be speeded up
by dropping back to only dilute raw juices or vegetable broth made only from greens,
without eating the solids. In the most extreme cases hygienists use their most powerful
medicine: a long fast on herb teas, or just water. I will have a lot to say about
fasting, later.
    When acutely ill, the most important thing to do is to just
get out of the body&apos;s way, and let it heal itself. In our ignorance we are usually
our own worst enemy in this regard. We have been very successfully conditioned to
think that all symptoms are bad. But I know from experience that people can and do
learn a new way of viewing the body, an understanding that puts them at cause over
their own body. It allows you to be empowered in one more area of life instead of
being dependent and at the mercy of other peoples decisions about your body.
    Finally, and this is why natural medicine is doubly unpopular,
to prevent the recurrence of toxemia and acute disease states, person must discover
what they are doing wrong and change their life. Often as not this means elimination
of the person&apos;s favorite (indigestible) foods and/or (stress-producing) bad habits.
Naturally, I will have a lot more to say about this later, too.


 Chapter Three 
 Fasting 


 From The Hygienic Dictionary 

 Cure. [1] There is no&quot;cure&quot;for disease;
fasting is not a cure. Fasting facilitates natural healing processes. Foods do not
cure. Until we have discarded our faith in cures, there can be no intelligent approach
to the problems presented by suffering and no proper use of foods by those who are
ill. Herbert Shelton, The Hygienic System, v. 3, Fasting and Sunbathing. [2]
All cure starts from within out and from the head down and in reverse order as the
symptoms have appeared. Hering&quot;s Law of Cure. [3] Life is made up of
crises. The individual establishes a standard of health peculiarly his own, which
must vary from all other standards as greatly as his personality varies from others.
The individual standard may be such as to favor the development of indigestion, catarrh,
gout, rheumatic and glandular inflammations, tubercular developments, congestions,
sluggish secretions and excretions, or inhibitions of various functions, both mental
and physical, wherever the environmental or habit strain is greater than usual. The
standard of resistance may be opposed so strenuously by habits and unusual physical
agencies--that the body breaks down under the strain. This is a crisis. Appetite fails,
discomfort or pain forces rest, and, as a result of physiological rest (fasting)
and physical rest (rest from daily work and habits), a readjustment takes place,
and the patient is&quot;cured.&quot;This is what the profession and the people
call a cure, and it is for the time being--until an unusual enervation is brought
on from accident or dissipation; then another crisis. These crises are the ordinary
sickness of all communities--all catalogued diseases. When the cold is gone or the
hay-fever fully relieved, it does not mean the patient is cured. Indeed, he is as
much diseased as before he suffered the attack--the crisis--and he never will be cured
until the habits of life that keep up toxin poisoning are corrected. To recover from
a crisis is not a cure; the tendency is back to the individual standard; hence all
crises are self-limited, unless nature by maltreatment is prevented from reacting.
All so-called healing systems ride to glory on the backs of self-limited crises,
and the self-deluded doctors and their credulous clients, believe, when the crises
are past, that a cure has been wrought, whereas the real truth is that the treatment
may have delayed reaction. This is largely true of anything that has been done except
rest. A cure consists in changing the manner of living to such a rational standard
that full resistance and a balanced metabolism is established. I suppose it is not
quite human to expect those of a standardized school of healing to give utterance
to discovered truth which, if accepted by the people, would rob them of the glory
of being curers of disease. Indeed, nature, and nature only, cures; and as for crises,
they come and go, whether or not there is a doctor or healer within a thousand miles. Dr. John.H. Tilden, Impaired Health: Its Cause and Cure, 1921. 


    The accelerated healing process that occurs during fasting
can scarcely be believed by a person who has not fasted. No matter how gifted the
writer, the experiential reality of fasting cannot be communicated. The great novelist
Upton Sinclair wrote a book about fasting and it failed to convince the multitudes.
But once a person has fasted long enough to be certain of what their own body can
do to fix itself, they acquire a degree of independence little known today. Many
of those experienced with fasting no longer dread being without health insurance
and feel far less need for a doctor or of having a regular checkup. They know with
certainty that if something degenerates in their body, their own body can fix it
by itself.
    Like Upton Sinclair and many others who largely failed before
me, I am going to try to convince you of the virtues of fasting by urging you to
try fasting yourself. If you will but try you will be changed for the better for
the rest of your life. If you do not try, you will never Know.
    To prompt your first step on this health-freedom road, I
ask you to please carefully consider the importance of this fact: the body&quot;s
routine energy budget includes a very large allocation for the daily digestion and
assimilation of the food you eat. You may find my estimate surprising, but about
one-third of a fairly sedentary person&quot;s entire energy consumption goes into
food processing. Other uses for the body&quot;s energy include the creation or rebuilding
of tissues, detoxification, moving (walking, running, etc.), talking, producing hormones,
etc. Digestion is one aspect of the body&quot;s efforts that we can readily control,
it is the key to having or losing health.

 The Effort Of Digestion 
    Digestion is a huge, unappreciated task, unappreciated because
few of us are aware of its happening in the same way we are aware of making efforts
to use our voluntary muscles when working or exercising. Digestion begins in the
mouth with thorough chewing. If you don&quot;t think chewing is effort, try making
coleslaw in your own mouth. Chew up at least half a big head of cabbage and three
big carrots that have not been shredded. Grind each bit until it liquefies and has
been thoroughly mixed with saliva. I guarantee that if you even finish the chore
your jaw will be tired and you will have lost all desire to eat anything else, especially
if it requires chewing.
    Making the saliva you just used while chewing the cabbage
is by itself, a huge and unappreciated chemical effort.
    Once in the stomach, chewed food has to be churned in order
to mix it with hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and other digestive enzymes. Manufacturing
these enzymes is also considerable work! Churning is even harder work than chewing
but normally, people are unaware of its happening. While the stomach is churning
(like a washing machine) a large portion of the blood supply is redirected from the
muscles in the extremities to the stomach and intestines to aid in this process.
Anyone who has tried to go for a run, or take part in any other strenuous physical
activity immediately after a large meal feels like a slug and wonders why they just
can&quot;t make their legs move the way they usually do. So, to assist the body while
it is digesting, it is wise to take a siesta as los Latinos do instead of expecting
the blood to be two places at once like los norteamericanos.
    After the stomach is through churning, the partially digested
food is moved into the small intestine where it is mixed with more pancreatin secreted
by the pancreas, and with bile from the gall bladder. Pancreatin further solubilizes
proteins. Bile aids in the digestion of fatty foods. Manufacturing bile and pancreatic
enzymes is also a lot of effort. Only after the carbohydrates (starches and sugars),
proteins and fats have been broken down into simpler water soluble food units such
as simple sugars, amino acids and fatty acids, can the body pass these nutrients
into the blood thorough the little projections in the small intestines called villi.
    The leftovers, elements of the food that can&quot;t be solubilized
plus some remaining liquids, are passed into the large intestine. There, water and
the vital mineral salts dissolved in that water, are extracted and absorbed into
the blood stream through thin permeable membranes. Mucous is also secreted in the
large intestine to facilitate passage of the dryish remains. This is an effort. (Intestinal
mucous can become a route of secondary elimination, especially during fasting. While
fasting, it is essential to take steps to expel toxic mucous in the colon before
the poisons are re adsorbed.) The final residue, now called fecal matter, is squeezed
along the length of the large intestines and passes out the rectum.
    If all the digestive processes have been efficient there
now are an abundance of soluble nutrients for the blood stream to distribute to hungry
cells throughout the body. It is important to understand the process at least on
the level of oversimplification just presented in order to begin to understand better
how health is lost or regained through eating, digestion, and elimination. And most
importantly, through not eating.

 How Fasting Heals 
    Its an old hygienic maxim that the doctor does not heal,
the medicines do not heal, only the body heals itself. If the body can&quot;t heal
then nothing can heal it. The body always knows best what it needs and what to do.
    But healing means repairing damaged organs and tissues and
this takes energy, while a sick body is already enervated, weakened and not coping
with its current stressors. If the sick person could but somehow increase the body&quot;s
energy resources sufficiently, then a slowly healing body could heal faster while
a worsening one, or one that was failing or one that was not getting better might
heal.
    Fasting does just that. To whatever degree food intake is
reduced the body&quot;s digestive workload is proportionately reduced and it will
naturally, and far more intelligently than any physician could order, redirect energy
to wherever it decides that energy is most needed. A fasting body begins accessing
nutritional reserves (vitamins and minerals) previously stored in the tissues and
starts converting body fat into sugar for energy fuel. During a time of water fasting,
sustaining the body&quot;s entire energy and nutritional needs from reserves and
fat does require a small effort, but far less effort than eating. I would guess a
fasting body used about five percent of its normal daily energy budget on nutritional
concerns rather than the 33 percent it needs to process new food. Thus, water fasting
puts something like 28 percent more energy at the body&quot;s disposal. This is true
even though the water faster may feel weak, energyless.
    I would worry if sick or toxic fasters did not complain about
their weakness. They should expect to feel energyless. In fact, the more internal
healing and detoxification the body requires, the tireder the faster feels because
the body is very hard at work internally. A great deal of the body&quot;s energy
will go toward boosting the immune system if the problem is an infection. Liberated
energy can also be used for healing damaged parts, rebuilding failing organs, for
breaking down and eliminating deposits of toxic materials. Only after most of the
healing has occurred does a faster begin to feel energetic again. Don&quot;t expect
to feel anything but tired and weak.
    The only exception to this would be a person who has already
significantly detoxified and healed their body by previous fasting, or the rare soul
that has gone from birth through adulthood enjoying extraordinarily good nutrition
and without experiencing the stressors of improper digestion. When one experienced
faster I know finds himself getting&quot;run down&quot;or catching a cold, he quits
eating until he feels really well. Instead of feeling weak as most fasters do, as
each of the first four or five days of water fasting pass, he experiences a resurgence
of more and more energy. On the first fasting day he would usually feel rotten, which
was why he started fasting in the first place. On the second fasting day he&quot;d
feel more alert and catch up on his paper work. By his third day on only water he
would be out doing hard physical chores like cutting the grass, splitting wood or
weeding his vegetable garden. Day four would also be an energetic one, but if the
fast extended beyond that, lowering blood sugar would begin to make him tired and
he&quot;d feel forced to begin laying down.
    After a day of water fasting the average person&quot;s blood
sugar level naturally drops; making a faster feel somewhat tired and&quot;spacey,&quot;so a typical faster usually begins to spend much more time resting, further reducing
the amount of energy being expended on moving the body around, serendipitously redirecting
even more of the body&quot;s energy budget toward healing. By the end of five or
six days on water, I estimate that from 40 to 50 percent of the body&quot;s available
energy is being used for healing, repair and detoxification.
    The amount of work that a fasting body&quot;s own healing
energy can do and what it feels like to be there when it is happening is incredible.
But you can&quot;t know it if you haven&quot;t felt it. So hardly anyone in our present
culture knows.
    As I mentioned in the first chapter, at Great Oaks School
I apprenticed myself to the traveling masters of virtually every system of natural
healing that existed during the &apos;70s. I observed every one of them at work and tried
most of them on my clients. After all that I can say with experience that I am not
aware of any other healing tool that can be so effective as the fast.

Essentials of a Successful, Safe Fast 
 1. Fast in a bright airy room, with exceptionally good ventilation, because fasters
 not only need a lot of fresh air; their bodies give off powerfully offensive odors. 2. Sun bathe if possible in warm climates for 10 to 20 minutes in the morning
 before the sun gets too strong. 3. Scrub/massage the skin with a dry brush, stroking toward the heart, followed
 by a warm water shower two to four times a day to assist the skin in eliminating
 toxins. If you are too weak to do this, have an assisted bed bath. 4. Have two enemas daily for the first week of a fast and then once daily until
 the fast is terminated. 5. Insure a harmonious environment with supportive people or else fast alone
 if you are experienced. Avoid well-meaning interference or anxious criticism at all
 cost. The faster becomes hypersensitive to others&quot;emotions. 6. Rest profoundly except for a short walk of about 200 yards morning and night. 7. Drink water! At least three quarts every day. Do not allow yourself to become
 dehydrated! 8. Control yourself! Break a long fast on diluted non-sweet fruit juice such
 as grapefruit juice, sipped a teaspoon at a time, no more than eight ounces at a
 time no oftener than every 2 or 3 hours. The second day you eat, add small quantities
 of fresh juicy fruit to the same amount of juice you took the day before no oftener
 than every 3 hours. By small quantities I mean half an apple or the equivalent. On
 the third day of eating, add small quantities of vegetable juice and juicy vegetables
 such as tomatoes and cucumbers. Control yourself! The second week after eating resumed add complex vegetable
 salads plus more complex fruit salads. Do not mix fruit and vegetables at meals.
 The third week add raw nuts and seeds no more than 1/2 ounce three times daily. Add
 1/4 avocado daily. Fourth week increase to 3 ounces of raw soaked nuts and seeds
 daily and 1/2 avocado daily. Cooked grains may also be added, along with steamed
 vegetables and vegetable soups.
 

 The Prime Rules Of Fasting 
    Another truism of natural hygiene is that we dig our own
graves with our teeth. It is sad but true that almost all eat too much quantity of
too little quality. Dietary excesses are the main cause of death in North America.
Fasting balances these excesses. If people were to eat a perfect diet and not overeat,
fasting would rarely be necessary.
    There are two essential rules of fasting. If these rules
are ignored or broken, fasting itself can be life threatening. But if the rules are
followed, fasting presents far less risk than any other important medical procedure
with a far greater likelihood of a positive outcome. And let me stress here, there
is no medical procedure without risk. Life itself is fraught with risk, it is a one-way
ticket from birth to death, with no certainty as to when the end of the line will
be reached. But in my opinion, when handling degenerative illness and infections,
natural hygiene and fasting usually offer the best hope of healing with the least
possible risk.
    The first vital concern is the duration of the fast. Two
eliminatory processes go on simultaneously while fasting. One is the dissolving and
elimination of the excess, toxic or dysfunctional deposits in the body, and second
process, the gradual exhaustion of the body&quot;s stored nutritional reserves. The
fasting body first consumes those parts of the body that are unhealthy; eventually
these are all gone. Simultaneously the body uses up stored fat and other reserve
nutritional elements. A well-fed reasonably healthy body usually has enough stored
nutrition to fast for quite a bit longer than it takes to&quot;clean house.&quot;
    While house cleaning is going on the body uses its reserves
to rebuild organs and rejuvenate itself. Rebuilding starts out very slowly but the
repairs increase at an ever-accelerating rate. The&quot;overhaul&quot;can last
only until the body has no more reserves. Because several weeks of fasting must pass
by before the&quot;overhaul&quot;gets going full speed, it is wise to continue
fasting as long as possible so as to benefit from as much rejuvenation as possible.
    It is best not to end the fast before all toxic or dysfunctional
deposits are eliminated, or before the infection is overcome, or before the cause
for complaint has been healed. The fast must be ended when most of the body&quot;s
essential-to-life stored nutritional reserves are exhausted. If the fast goes beyond
this point, starvation begins. Then, fasting-induced organic damage can occur, and
death can follow, usually several weeks later. Almost anyone not immediately close
to death has enough stored nutrition to water fast for ten days to two weeks. Most
reasonably healthy people have sufficient reserves to water fast for a month. Later
I will explain how a faster can somewhat resupply their nutritional reserves while
continuing to fast, and thus safely extend the fasting period.
    The second essential concern has to do with adjusting the
intensity of the fast. Some individuals are so toxic that the waste products released
during a fast are too strong, too concentrated or too poisonous for the organs of
elimination to handle safely, or to be handled within the willingness of the faster
to tolerate the discomforts that toxic releases generate. The highly-toxic faster
may even experience life-threatening symptoms such as violent asthma attacks. This
kind of faster has almost certainly been dangerously ill before the fast began. Others,
though not dangerously sick prior to fasting, may be nearly as toxic and though not
in danger of death, they may not be willing to tolerate the degree of discomfort
fasting can trigger. For this reason I recommend that if at all possible, before
undertaking a fast the person eat mostly raw foods for two months and clean up all
addictions. This will give the body a chance to detoxify significantly before the
water fast is started, and will make water fasting much more comfortable. Seriously,
dangerously ill people should only fast with experienced guidance, so the rapidity
of their detoxification process may be adjusted to a lower level if necessary.
    A fast of only one week can accomplish a significant amount
of healing. Slight healing does occur on shorter fasts, but it is much more difficult
to see or feel the results. Many people experience rapid relief from acute headache
pain or digestive distress such as gas attacks, mild gallbladder pain, stomach aches,
etc., after only one day&quot;s abstention from food. In one week of fasting a person
can relieve more dangerous conditions such as arthritic pain, rheumatism, kidney
pain, and many symptoms associated with allergic reactions,. But even more fasting
time is generally needed for the body to completely heal serious diseases. That&quot;s
because eliminating life-threatening problems usually involve rebuilding organs that
aren&quot;t functioning too well. Major rebuilding begins only after major detoxification
has been accomplished, and this takes time.
    Yes, even lost organ function can be partially or completely
restored by fasting. Aging and age-related degeneration is progressive, diminishing
organ functioning. Organs that make digestive enzymes secrete less enzymes. The degenerated
immune system loses the ability to mobilize as effectively when the body is attacked.
Liver and kidney efficiency declines. The adrenals tire, becoming incapable of dumping
massive amounts of stress-handling hormones or of repeating that effort time after
time without considerable rest in between. The consequences of these inter-dependent
deterioration&quot;s is a cascade of deterioration that contributes to even more
rapid deterioration&quot;s. The name for this cascading process is aging. Its inevitable
result--death.
    Fasting can, to a degree, reverse aging. Because fasting
improves organ functioning, it can slow down aging.
    Fasters are often surprised that intensified healing can
be uncomfortable. They have been programmed by our culture and by allopathic doctors
to think that if they are doing the right thing for their bodies they should feel
better immediately. I wish it weren&quot;t so, but most people have to pay the piper
for their dietary indiscretions and other errors in living. There will be aches and
minor pains and uncomfortable sensations. More about that later. A rare faster does
feel immediately better, and continues to feel ever better by the day, and even has
incredible energy while eating nothing, but the majority of us folks just have to
tough it out, keeping in mind that the way out is the way through. It is important
to remind yourself at times that even with some discomfort and considering the inconvenience
of fasting that you are getting off easy--one month of self-denial pays for those
years of indulgence and buys a regenerated body.

 Length Of The Fast 
    How long should a person fast? In cases where there are serious
complaints to remedy but where there are no life threatening disease conditions,
a good rule of thumb is to fast on water for one complete day (24 hours) for each
year that the person has lived. If you are 30 years old, it will take 30 consecutive
days of fasting to restore complete health. However, thirty fasting days, done a
few days here and a few there won&quot;t equal a month of steady fasting; the body
accomplishes enormously more in 7 or l4 days of consecutive fasting, than 7 or 14
days of fasting accumulated sporadically, such as one day a week. This is not to
say that regular short fasts are not useful medicine. Periodic day-long fasts have
been incorporated into many religious traditions, and for good reason; it gives the
body one day a week to rest, to be free of digestive obligations, and to catch up
on garbage disposal. I heartily recommend it. But it takes many years of unfailingly
regular brief fasting to equal the benefits of one, intensive experience.
    Fasting on water much longer than fifteen consecutive days
may be dangerous for the very sick, (unless under experienced supervision) or too
intense for those who are not motivated by severe illness to withstand the discomfort
and boredom. However, it is possible to finish a healing process initiated by one
long water fast by repeating the fast later. My husband&quot;s healing is a good
example of this. His health began to noticeably decline about age 38 and he started
fasting. He fasted on water 14 to 18 days at a time, once a year, for five consecutive
years before most of his complaints and problems entirely vanished.
    The longest fast I ever supervised was a 90 day water fast
on an extraordinarily obese woman, who at 5&quot;2&quot;weighed close to 400 pounds.
She was a Mormon; generally members of the LDS Church eat a healthier diet than most
Americans, but her&quot;s included far too much of what I call&quot;healthfood junkfood,&quot;in the form of whole grain cakes and cookies, lots of granola made with lots of honey,
oil, and dried fruit, lots of honey heaped atop heavily buttered whole grain bread.
(I will explain more about the trap of healthfood junkfood later on.) A whole foods
relatively meatless diet is far superior to its refined white flour, white sugar
and white grease (lard) counterpart, but it still produced a serious heath problem
in just 30 years of life. Like many women, she expressed love-for-family in the kitchen
by serving too-much too-tasty food. The Mormons have a very strong family orientation
and this lady was no exception, but she was insecure and unhappy in her marriage
and sought consolation in food, eaten far in excess of what her body needed.
    On her 90 day water fast she lost about 150 pounds, but was
still grossly overweight when the fast ended. Toward the end it became clear that
it was unrealistic to try to shrink this woman any closer to normal body weight because
to her, fat represented an invaluable insulation or buffer that she was not prepared
to give up. As the weight melted away on the fast and she was able to actually feel
the outline of a hip bone her neurosis became more and more apparent, and the ability
to feel a part of her skeleton was so upsetting to her that her choice was between
life threatening obesity and pervasive anxiety.
    Her weight was still excessive but the solace of eating was
even more important. This woman needed intensive counseling not more fasting. Unfortunately,
at the end she choose to remain obese. Fat was much less frightening to her than
confronting her emotions and fears. The positive side was that after the fast she
was able to maintain her weight at 225 instead of 375 which was an enormous relief
to her exhausted heart.
    Another client I fasted for 90 days was a 6&quot;1&quot;tall, chronic schizophrenic man who weighed in at 400 pounds. He was so big he could
barely get through my front door, and mine was an extraordinarily wide door in what
had been an upper-class mansion. This man, now in his mid twenties, had spent his
last seven years in a mental institution before his parents decided to give him one
last chance by sending to Great Oaks School. The state mental hospitals at that time
provided the mentally ill with cigarettes, coffee, and lots of sugary treats, but
none of these substances were part of my treatment program so he had a lot of immediate
withdrawal to go through. The quickest and easiest way to get him through it was
to put him on a water fast after a few days of preparation on raw food.
    This was not an easily managed case! He was wildly psychotic,
on heavy doses of chloropromazine, with many bizarre behaviors. Besides talking to
himself continuously in gibberish, he collected bugs, moss, sticks, piles or dirt,
and switched to smoking oak leaves instead of cigarettes. He was such a fire hazard
that I had to move him to a downstairs room with concrete floor. Even in the basement
he was a fire hazard with his smoking and piles of sticks and other inflammables
next to his bed, but all of this debris was his&quot;precious.&quot;I knew that
I was in for trouble if I disturbed his precious, but the insects and dirt piles
seemed to be expanding exponentially.
    One day the dirt exceeded my tolerance level. To make a long
story short he caught me in the act of cleaning up his precious. Was he furious!
All 350 pounds of him! (By this time he had lost 50 pounds.) He barreled into me,
fists flying, and knocked me into the pipes next to the furnace and seemed ready
to really teach me what was what. I prefer to avoid fights, but if they are inevitable,
I can really get into the spirit of the thing. I&quot;d had lots of childhood practice
defending myself because I was an incurable tomboy who loved to wrestle; I could
usually pin big boys who considered themselves tough. So I began using my fists and
what little martial arts training I had to good use. After I hurt him a bit he realized
that I was not going to be easily intimidated, and that in fact he was in danger
of getting seriously damaged. So he called a truce before either of us were badly
beaten up. He had only a few bruises and welts, nothing serious.
    After that he refrained from collecting things inside the
building (he continued to collect outside). This compromise was fine with me, and
the incident allowed me to maintain the authority I needed to bully him into co-operating
with the program: taking his vitamins, and sticking to his fast until he finally
reached 200 pounds. After 90 days on water he actually looked quite handsome, he
no longer smoked, he was off psychotropic medication, and his behaviors were within
an acceptable range as long as your expectations were not too high.
    He was well enough to live outside a hospital and also clear-headed
enough to know that if he let too many people know how well he really was, he might
have to give up his mental disability pension and actually become responsible for
himself. No way, Jose! This fellow knew a good thing when he saw it. So he continued
to pull bizarre stunts just often enough in front of the right audience to keep his
disability checks coming in, while managing to act sane enough to be allowed to live
comfortably at home instead of in the hospital. By keeping to my program he could
stay off mind-numbing psychotropic medication if he kept up his megavitamins and
minerals. This compromise was tolerable from his point of view, because there were
no side effects like he experienced from his tranquilizers.
    It is very rare for a mentally ill person who has spent more
than a few months in a mental hospital to ever usefully return to society because
they find&quot;mental illness&quot;too rewarding.

 My Own 56 Day Long Fast 
    Fasters go through a lot of different emotional states, these
can get intense and do change quite rapidly. The physical body, too, will manifest
transitory conditions. Some can be quite uncomfortable. But, I don&quot;t want to
leave the reader with the impression that fasting is inevitably painful. So I will
now recount my own longest fast in detail.
    When I did my own 42 day water fast followed by two weeks
on carrot juice diluted 50/50 with water, which really amounted to 56 consecutive
days, my predominant sensation for the first three days was a desire to eat that
was mostly a mental condition, and a lot of rumbling and growling from my stomach.
This is not real hunger, just the sounds the stomach likes to make when it is shrinking.
After all, this organ is accustomed to being filled at regular intervals, and then,
all of a sudden, it gets nothing, so naturally the stomach wants to know what is
going on. Once it realizes it is on temporary vacation, the stomach wisely decides
to reduce itself to a size suitable for a retired organ. And it shuts up. This process
usually takes three to five days and for most people, no further&quot;hunger pangs&quot;are felt until the fast is over.
    Real hunger comes only when the body is actually starving.
The intense discomforts many people experience upon missing a meal are frequently
interpreted as hunger but they aren&quot;t. What is actually happening is that their
highly toxic bodies are taking the opportunity presented by having missed a meal
or two to begin to cleanse. The toxins being released and processed make assorted
unpleasant symptoms such as headaches and inability to think clearly. These symptoms
can be instantly eliminated by the intake of a bit of food, bringing the detox to
a screeching halt.
    Two weeks into the fast I experienced sharp abdominal pains
that felt like I imagine appendicitis feels, which compelled me toward the nearest
toilet in a state of great urgency where I productively busied myself for about half
an hour. As I mentioned earlier, I was experimentally adhering to a rigid type of
fast of the sort recommended by Dr. Herbert Shelton, a famous advocate of the Natural
Hygiene school. Shelton was such a powerful writer and personality that there still
exists a Natural Hygiene Society that keeps his books in print and maintains his
library. The words&quot;Natural Hygiene&quot;are almost owned by the society like
a trademark and they object when anyone describes themselves as a hygienist and then
advocates any practice that Dr. Shelton did not approve of.
    Per Dr. Shelton, I was going to fast from the time hunger
left until the time it returned and I was not going to use any form of colon cleansing.
Shelton strongly opposed bowel cleansing so I did no enemas nor colonics, nor herbs,
nor clays, nor psyllium seed designed to clean the bowel, etc. Obviously at day 14
the bowel said, enough is enough of this crap, and initiated a goods house cleaning
session. When I saw what was eliminated I was horrified to think that I had left
that stuff in there for two weeks. I then started to wonder if the Sheltonites were
mistaken about this aspect of fasting. Nonetheless, I persevered on the same regimen
because my hunger had not returned, my tongue was still thickly coated with foul-smelling,
foul-tasting mucus and I still had some fat on my feet that had not been metabolized.
    Shelton said that cleansing is not complete until a skeletal
condition is reached--that is, absolutely no fat reserves are left. Up until that
time I did not even know that I had fat on my feet, but much to my surprise, as the
weeks went on, not only did my breasts disappear except for a couple of land marks
well-known to my babies, but my ribs and hip bones became positively dangerous to
passersby, and my shoes would not stay on my feet. This was not all that surprising
because I went from 135 pounds down to 85 on a 5&quot;7&quot;frame with substantial
bone structure.
    Toward the end of the fast my eyes became brighter and clearer
blue, my skin took on a good texture, my breath finally became sweet, my tongue cleared
up and became pink, my mind was clear, and my spiritual awareness and sensitivity
was heightened. In other words, I was no longer a walking hulk of stored-up toxemia.
I also felt quite weak and had to rest for ten minutes out every hour in horizontal
position. (I should have rested much more.) I also required very little sleep, although
it felt good to just lie quietly and rest, being aware of what was going on in various
parts of my body.
    During the last few weeks on water I became very attentive
to my right shoulder. Two separate times in the past, while flying head first over
the handlebars of my bicycle I had broken my shoulder with considerable tearing of
ligaments and tendons. At night when I was totally still I felt a whole crew of pixies
and brownies with picks and shovels at work in the joint doing major repair work.
This activity was not entirely comfortable, but I knew it was constructive work,
not destructive, so I joined the work crew with my mind&quot;s eye and helped the
work along.
    It seemed my visualizations actually did help. Ever since,
I&quot;ve had the fasters I supervised use creative imagery or write affirmations
to help their bodies heal. There are lots of books on this subject. I&quot;ve found
that the techniques work far better on a faster than when a person is eating normally.
    After breaking the fast it took me six weeks to regain enough
strength that I could run my usual distance in my regular time; it took me six months
to regain my full 135 pound weight because I was very careful to break the fast slowly
and correctly. Coming off water with two weeks on dilute carrot juice I then added
small portions of raw food such as apples, raw vegetables, sprouts, vegetable juices,
and finally in the fourth week after I began drinking dilute carrot juice, I added
seven daily well-chewed almonds to my rebuilding diet. Much later I increased to
14 almonds, but that was the maximum amount of such highly concentrated fare my body
wanted digest at one time for over one year. I found I got a lot more miles to the
gallon out of the food that I did eat, and did not crave recreational foods. Overall
I was very pleased with my educational fast, it had taught me a great deal.
    If I had undertaken such a lengthy fast at a time when I
was actually ill, and therefore had felt forced into it, my experience could have
been different. A positive mental attitude is an essential part of the healing process
so fasting should not be undertaken in a negative, protesting mental state. The mind
is so powerful that fear or the resistance fear generates can override the healing
capacity of the body. For that reason I always recommend that people who consider
themselves to be healthy, who have no serious complaints, but who are interested
in water fasting, should limit themselves to ten consecutive days or so, certainly
never more than 14. Few healthy people, even those with a deep interest in the process,
can find enough personal motivation to overcome the extreme boredom of water fasting
for longer than that. Healthy people usually begin protesting severely after about
two weeks. If there is any one vital rule of fasting, one never should fast over
strong, personal protest. Anytime you&quot;re fasting and you really desire to quit,
you probably should. Unless, of course, you are critically ill. Then you may have
no choice--its fast or die.

 Common Fasting Complaints And Discomforts 
    The most frequently heard complaints of fasters are headaches,
dry, cracked lips, dizziness, blurred vision with black spots that float, skin rashes,
and weakness in the first few days plus what they think is intense hunger. The dizziness
and weakness are really real, and are due to increased levels of toxins circulating
in the blood and from unavoidably low blood sugar which is a natural consequence
of the cessation of eating. The blood sugar does reestablish a new equilibrium in
the second and third week of the fast and then, the dizziness may cease, but still,
it is important to expect dizziness at the beginning.
    It always takes more time for the blood to reach the head
on a fast because everything has slowed down, including the rate of the heart beat,
so blood pressure probably has dropped as well. If you stand up very quickly you
may faint. I repetitively instruct all of my clients to stand up very slowly, moving
from a lying to a sitting position, pausing there for ten or twenty seconds, and
then rising slowly from a sitting to a standing position. They are told that at the
first sign of dizziness they must immediately put their head between their knees
so that the head is lower than the heart, or squat/sit down on the floor, I once
had a faster who forgot to obey my frequent warnings. About two weeks into a long
fast, she got up rapidly from the toilet and felt dizzy. The obvious thing to do
was to sit back down on the toilet or lie down on the bath rug on the floor, but
no, she decided that because she was dizzy she should rush back to her bed in the
adjoining room. She made it as far as the bathroom door and fainted, out cold, putting
a deep grove into the drywall with her pretty nose on the way down. We then had to
make an unscheduled visit to a nose specialist, who calmly put a tape-wrapped spoon
inside her bent-over nose and pried it back to dead center. This was not much fun
for either of us; it is well worthwhile preventing such complications.
    Other common complaints during the fast include coldness,
due to low blood sugar as well as a consequence of weight loss and slowed circulation
due to lessened physical activity. People also dislike inactivity which seems excruciatingly
boring, and some are upset by weight loss itself. Coldness is best handled with lots
of clothes, bedding, hot water bottles or hot pads, and warm baths. Great Oaks School
of Health was in Oregon, where the endlessly rainy winters are chilly and the concrete
building never seemed to get really warm. I used to dream of moving my fasters to
a tropical climate where I could also get the best, ripest fruits to wean them back
on to food.
    If the fast goes on for more than a week or ten days, many
people complain of back discomfort, usually caused by over-worked kidneys. This passes.
Hot baths or hot water bottles provide some relief. Drinking more fluids may also
help a bit. Nausea is fairly common too, due to toxic discharges from the gall bladder.
Drinking lots of water or herbal tea dilutes toxic bile in the stomach and makes
it more tolerable.
    Very few fasters sleep well and for some reason they expect
to, certainly fasters hope to, because they think that if they sleep all night they
will better survive one more deadly dull day in a state of relative unconsciousness.
They find out much to their displeasure that very little sleep is required on a fast
because the body is at rest already. Many fasters sleep only two to four hours but
doze frequently and require a great deal of rest. Being mentally prepared for this
change of habit is the best handling. Generalized low-grade aches and pains in the
area of the diseased organs or body parts are common and can often be alleviated
with hot water bottles, warm but not hot bath water and massage. If this type of
discomfort exists, it usually lessens with each passing day until it disappears altogether.
    Many fasters complain that their vision is blurred, and that
they are unable to concentrate. These are really major inconveniences because then
fasters can&quot;t read or even pay close attention to video-taped movies, and if
they can&quot;t divert themselves some fasters think they will go stir crazy. They
are so addicted to a hectic schedule of doingness, and/or being entertained that
they just can&quot;t stand just being with themselves, forced to confront and deal
with the sensations of their own body, forced to face their own thoughts, to confront
their own emotions, many of which are negative. People who are fasting release a
lot of mental/emotional garbage at the same time as they let go of old physical garbage.
Usually the psychological stuff contributed greatly to their illness and just like
the physical garbage and degenerated organs, it all needs to be processed.
    One of the most distressing experiences that happen occasionally
is hair loss. Deprived of adequate nutrition, the follicles can not keep growing
hair, and the existing hair dies. However, the follicles themselves do not die and
once the fast has ended and sufficient nutrition is forthcoming, hair will regrow
as well or better than before.
    There are also complaints that occur after the fast has been
broken. Post-fast cravings, even after only two weeks of deprivation, are to be expected.
These may take the form of desires for sweet, sour, salt, or a specific food dreamed
of while fasting, like chocolate fudge sundays or just plain toast. Food cravings
must be controlled at all costs because if acted upon, each indulgence chips away
the health gains of the previous weeks. A single indulgence can be remedied by a
day of restricting the diet to juice or raw food. After the repair, the person feels
as good as they did when the fast ended. Repeated indulgences will require another
extended bout of fasting to repair. It is far better to learn self-control.

 The Healing Crisis And Retracing 
    Certain unpleasant somatics that occur while fasting (or
while on a healing diet) may not be dangerous or&quot;bad.&quot;Two types, the
healing crisis, and retracing, are almost inevitable. A well-educated faster should
welcome these discomforts when they happen. The healing crisis (but not retracing)
also occurs on a healing diet.
    The healing crisis can seem a big surprise to a faster who
has been progressing wonderfully. Suddenly, usually after a few days of noticeably
increased well-being, they suddenly experience a set of severe symptoms and feel
just awful. This is not a setback, not something to be upset or disappointed about,
but a healing crisis, actually a positive sign
    Healing crises always occur after a period of marked improvement.
As the vital force builds up during the healing process, the body decides it now
has obtained enough energy to throw off some accumulated toxins, and forcefully pushes
them out through a typical and usually previously used route of secondary elimination,
such as the nose, lungs, stomach, intestines, skin, or perhaps produces a flu-like
experience with fever chills, sweat, aches and pains, etc. Though unpleasant, this
experience is to be encouraged; the body has merely accelerated its elimination process.
Do not attempt to suppress any of these symptoms, don&quot;t even try to moderate
fever, which is the body&quot;s effective way to burn out a virus or bacteria infection,
unless it is a dangerously high fever (over 102°Fahrenheit). Fever can be lowered
without drugs by putting the person into a cool/cold bath, or using cold towel wraps
and cold water sponge baths. The good news is that healing crises usually do not
last long, and when they are past you feel better than you did before the crisis.
    Asthmatics seem to have the worst crises. I have had asthmatics
bring up a quart of obnoxious mucous from their lungs every night for weeks. They
have stayed awake all night for three nights continuously coughing and choking on
the material that was being eliminated. After that clearing-out process they were
able to breath much more freely. Likewise I have had people who have had sinusitis
have nothing but non-stop pussy discharge from their sinuses for three weeks. Some
of this would run down the throat and cause nausea. All I could say to encourage
the sufferer was that it needed to come out and to please stand aside and let the
body work its magic. These fasters were not grateful until the sinus problem that
had plagued them since childhood disappeared.
    The interesting thing about healing crises are that the symptoms
produced retrace earlier complaints; they are almost never something entirely unknown
to the patient. Usually they are old, familiar somatics, often complaints that haven&quot;t
bothered the faster for many years. The reason the symptom is familiar but is not
currently a problem is because as the body degenerates it loses vital force; with
less vital force it loses the ability to create such acute detoxification episodes
in non-life-threatening secondary elimination routes. The degenerated body makes
less violent efforts to cleanse, efforts that aren&quot;t as uncomfortable. The negative
side of this is that instead of creating acute discomfort in peripheral systems,
the toxemia goes to more vital organs where it hastens the formation of life-threatening
conditions.
    There is a very normal and typical progress for each person&quot;s
fatal illness. Their ultimate disease starts out in childhood or adolescence as acute
inflammations of skin-like organs, viral or bacterial infections of the same. Then,
as vital force weakens, secondary eliminations are shifted to more vital organs.
Allergies or colds stop happening so frequently; the person becomes rheumatic, arthritic
or experience weakness in joints, tendons, ligaments, or to have back pains, or to
have digestive upsets. These new symptoms are more constant but usually less acute.
Ultimately, vital organs begin to malfunction, and serious disease develop. But a
hygienist sees the beginning of fatal diseases such as cancer in adolescent infections
and allergies.
    Retracing is generally seen only on water fasts, not on extended
cleansing diets. The body begins to repair itself by healing conditions in the reverse
order to that which they occurred originally. This means that the body would first
direct healing toward the lungs if the most recently serious illness was an attack
of pneumonia six months previously. In this case you would expect to quickly and
intensely experience a mini-case of pneumonia while the body eliminates residues
in the lungs that were not completely discharged at the time. Next the body might
take you through a period of depression that you had experienced five years in the
past. The faster may be profoundly depressed for a few days and come out of it feeling
much better. You could then reexperience sensation-states like those caused by recreational
drugs you had playfully experimented with ten years previously along with the&quot;trippiness&quot;if it were a hallucinogen, speediness if it was &apos;speed&quot;or the dopiness if it
was heroin. Retracing further, the faster might then experience something similar
to a raging attack of tonsillitis which you vaguely remember having when you were
five years old, but fortunately this time it passes in three days (or maybe six hours),
instead of three weeks. This is retracing.
    Please do not be surprised or alarmed if it happens to you
on a fast, and immediately throw out the baby with the bath water thinking that you
are doing the wrong thing because all those old illnesses are coming back to haunt
you. It is the body&quot;s magnificent healing effort working on your behalf, and
for doing it your body deserves lots of&quot;well done&quot;,&quot;good body&quot;thoughts rather than gnashing of teeth and thinking what did I do to deserve this.
The body won&quot;t tell you what you did to deserve this, but it knows and is trying
its darndest to undo it.

 The Unrelenting Boredom Of Fasting 
    Then there&quot;s the unrelenting boredom of fasting. Most
people have been media junkies since they were kids; the only way they believe they
can survive another day of fasting is by diverting their minds with TV. This is far
from ideal because often the emotions of a faster are like an open wound and when
they resonate with the emotions portrayed on most TV shows, the faster gets into
some very unpleasant states that interfere with healing. And the emotions many movies
prompt people to sympathetically generate are powerful ones, often highly negative,
and contrary to healing. Especially unhelpful are the adrenaline rushes in action
movies. But if TV is the best a faster can do, it is far better that someone fast
with television programming filling their minds than to not fast at all. I keep a
library of positive VHS tapes for these addicts--comedies, stories of heroic over-comings,
depiction&quot;s of humans at their best.
    Boredom is probably the most limiting factor to fasting a
long time. That is because boredom is progressive, it gets worse with each slowly-passing
day. But concurrently, the rate of healing is accelerating with each slowly-passing
day. Every day the faster gets through does them considerably more good than the
previous day. However, fasters rarely are motivated enough to overcome boredom for
more than two weeks or so, unless they started the fast to solve a very serious or
life-threatening condition. For this reason, basically well people should not expect
to be able to fast for more than a couple of weeks every six months or year, no matter
how much good a longer fast might do.

 Exercise While Fasting 
    The issue of how much activity is called for on a fast is
controversial. Natural Hygienists in the Herbert Shelton tradition insist that all
fasters absolutely must have complete bed rest, with no books, no TV, no visitors,
no enemas, no exercise, no music, and of course no food, not even a cup of herb tea.
In my many years of conducting people through fasts, I have yet to meet an individual
that could mentally tolerate this degree of nothingness. It is too drastic a withdrawal
from all the stimulation people are used to in the twentieth century. I still don&quot;t
know how Shelton managed to make his patients do it, but my guess is that he must
have been a very intimidating guy. Shelton was a body builder of some renown in his
day. I bet Shelton&quot;s patients kept a few books and magazines under their mattress
and only took them out when he wasn&quot;t looking. If I had tried to enforced this
type of sensory deprivation, I know my patients would have grabbed their clothes
and run, vowing never to fast again. I think it is most important that people fast,
and that they feel so good about the experience that they want to do it again, and
talk all their sick friends into doing the same thing.
    In contrast to enforced inactivity, Russian researchers who
supervised schizophrenics on 30 day water fasts insisted that they walk for three
hours every day, without stopping. I would like to have been there to see how they
managed to enforce that. I suspect some patients cheated. I lived with schizophrenics
enough years to know that it is very difficult to get them to do anything that they
don&quot;t want to do, and very few of them are into exercise, especially when fasting.
    In my experience both of these approaches to activity during
the fast are extremes. The correct activity level should be arrived at on an individual
basis. I have had clients who walked six miles a day during an extended water fast,
but they were not feeling very sick when they started the fast, and they were also
physically fit. In contrast I have had people on extended fasts who were unable to
walk for exercise, or so weak they were unable to even walk to the bathroom, but
these people were critically ill when they started fasting, and desperately needed
to conserve what little vital force they had for healing.
    Most people who are not critically ill need to walk at least
200 yards twice a day, with assistance if necessary, if only to move the lymph through
the system. The lymphatic system is a network of ducts and nodes which are distributed
throughout the body, with high concentrations of nodes in the neck, chest, arm pits,
and groin. Its job is to carry waste products from the extremities to the center
of the body where they can be eliminated. The blood is circulated through the arteries
and veins in the body by the contractions of the heart, but the lymphatic system
does not have a pump. Lymphatic fluid is moved by the contractions of the muscles,
primarily those of the arms and legs. If the faster is too weak to move, massage
and assisted movements are essential.
    Lymph nodes are also a part of our immune system and produce
white blood cells to help control invading organisms. When the lymph is overloaded
with waste products the ducts and nodes swell, and until the source of the local
irritation is removed, are incapable of handling further debris. If left in this
condition for years they become so hard they feel like rocks under the skin. Lumps
in the armpits or the groin are prime sites for the future development of a cancer.
Fasting, massage, and poultices will often soften overloaded lymph nodes and coax
them back into operation.
    The Stages Of Fasting
    The best way to understand what happens when we fast is to
break up the process into six stages: preparation for the fast, loss of hunger, acidosis,
normalization, healing, and breaking the fast.
    A person that has consumed the typical American diet most
of their life and whose life is not in immediate danger would be very wise to gently
prepare their body for the fast. Two weeks would be a minimum amount of time, and
if the prospective faster wants an easier time of it, they should allow a month or
even two for preliminary housecleaning During this time, eliminate all meat, fish,
dairy products, eggs, coffee, black tea, salt, sugar, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes,
and greasy foods. This de-addiction will make the process of fasting much more pleasant,
and is strongly recommended. However, eliminating all these harmful substances is
withdrawal from addictive substances and will not be easy for most. I have more to
say about this later when I talk about allergies and addictions.
    The second stage, psychological hunger, usually is felt as
an intense desire for food. This passes within three or four days of not eating anything.
Psychological hunger usually begins with the first missed meal. If the faster seems
to be losing their resolve, I have them drink unlimited quantities of good-tasting
herb teas, (sweetened --only if absolutely necessary--with nutrisweet). Salt-free broths
made from meatless instant powder (obtainable at the health food store) can also
fend off the desire to eat until the stage of hunger has passed.
    Acidosis, the third stage, usually begins a couple of days
after the last meal and lasts about one week. During acidosis the body vigorously
throws off acid waste products. Most people starting a fast begin with an overly
acid blood pH from the typical American diet that contains a predominance of acid-forming
foods. Switching over to burning fat for fuel triggers the release of even more acidic
substances. Acidosis is usually accompanied by fatigue, blurred vision, and possibly
dizziness. The breath smells very bad, the tongue is coated with bad-tasting dryish
mucus, and the urine may be concentrated and foul unless a good deal of water is
taken daily. Two to three quarts a day is a reasonable amount.
    Mild states of acidosis are a common occurrence. While sleeping
after the last meal of the day is digested bodies normally work very hard trying
to detoxify from yesterday&quot;s abuses. So people routinely awaken in a state of
acidosis. Their tongue is coated, their breath foul and they feel poorly. They end
their brief overnight fast with breakfast, bringing the detoxification process to
a screeching halt and feel much better. Many people think they awaken hungry and
don&quot;t feel well until they eat. They confuse acidosis with hunger when most
have never experienced real hunger in their entire lives. If you typically awaken
in acidosis, you are being given a strong sign by your body that it would like to
continue fasting far beyond breakfast. In fact, it probably would enjoy fasting long
beyond the end of acidosis.
    Most fasters feel much more comfortable by the end of the
first seven to ten days, when they enter the normalization phase; here the acidic
blood chemistry is gradually corrected. This sets the stage for serious healing of
body tissues and organs. Normalization may take one or two more weeks depending on
how badly the body was out of balance. As the blood chemistry steadily approaches
perfection, the faster usually feels an increasing sense of well-being, broken by
short spells of discomfort that are usually healing crises or retracings.
    The next stage, accelerated healing, can take one or many
weeks more, again depending on how badly the body has been damaged. Healing proceeds
rapidly after the blood chemistry has been stabilized, the person is usually in a
state of profound rest and the maximum amount of vital force can be directed toward
repair and regeneration of tissues. This is a miraculous time when tumors are metabolized
as food for the body, when arthritic deposits dissolve, when scar tissues tend to
disappear, when damaged organs regain lost function (if they can). Seriously ill
people who never fast long enough to get into this stage (usually it takes about
ten days to two weeks of water fasting to seriously begin healing) never find out
what fasting can really do for them.
    Breaking the fast is equally or more important a stage than
the fast itself. It is the most dangerous time in the entire fast. If you stop fasting
prematurely, that is, before the body has completed detoxification and healing, expect
the body to reject food when you try to make it eat, even if you introduce foods
very gradually. The faster, the spiritual being running the body, may have become
bored and want some action, but the faster&quot;s body hasn&quot;t finished. The
body wants to continue healing.
    By rejection, I mean that food may not digest, may feel like
a stone in your stomach, make you feel terrible. If that happens and if, despite
that clear signal you refuse to return to fasting, you should go on a juice diet,
take as little as possible, sip it slowly (almost chew it) and stay on juice until
you find yourself digesting it easily. Then and only then, reintroduce a little solid
raw food like a green salad.
    Weaning yourself back on to food should last just as long
as the fast. Your first tentative meals should be dilute, raw juices. After several
days of slowly building up to solid raw fruit, small amounts of raw vegetable foods
should be added. If it has been a long fast, say over three weeks, this reintroduction
should be done gingerly over a few weeks. If this stage is poorly managed or ignored
you may become acutely ill, and for someone who started fasting while dangerously
ill, loss of self control and impulsive eating could prove fatal. Even for those
fasting to cure non-life-threatening illnesses it is pointless to go through the
effort and discipline of a long fast without carefully establishing a correct diet
after the fast ends, or the effort will have largely been wasted.


 Foods For Monodiet, Juice or Broth Fasting g zucchini, garlic, onion, green beans, kale, celery, beet greens and root, cabbage,
 carrot, wheat grass juice, alfalfa juice, barley green juice, parsley juice, lemon/lime
 juice, grapefruit juice, apples (not juice, too sweet), diluted orange juice, diluted
 grape juice 




 Less-Rigorous-Than-Water Fasts 
    There are gradations of fasting measures ranging from rigorous
to relatively casual. Water fasting is the most rapid and effective one. Other methods
have been created by grasping the underlying truth of fasting, namely whenever the
digestive effort can be reduced, by whatever degree, whenever the formation of the
toxins of misdigestion can be reduced or prevented, to that extent the body can divert
energy to the healing process. Thus comes about assorted famous and sometimes notorious
monodiet semi-fasts like the grape cure where the faster eats only grapes for a month
or so, or the lemon cure, where the juice of one or more lemons is added to water
and nothing else is consumed for weeks on end. Here I should also mention the&quot;lemon
juice/cayenne pepper/maple syrup cure,&quot;the various green drink cures using
spirulina, chlorella, barley green or wheat grass, and the famous Bieler broths--vegetable
soups made of overcooked green beans or zucchini.
    I do not believe that monodiets work because of some magical
property of a particular food used. They work because they are semi-fasts and may
be extremely useful, especially for those individuals who can not or will not tolerate
a water fast.
    The best foods for monodiet fasting are the easiest ones
digest: juices of raw fruits and nonstarchy vegetables with all solids strained out.
Strained mineral broths made of long-simmered non-starchy vegetables (the best of
them made of leafy green vegetables) fall in the same category. So if you are highly
partial to the flavor of grapes or lemons or cayenne and (highly diluted) maple syrup,
a long fast on one of these would do you a world of good, just not quite as much
good as the same amount of time spent on water alone. If you select something more&quot;solid&quot;for a long monodiet fast, like pureed zucchini, it is essential
that you not overeat. Dr. Bieler gave his fasting patients only one pint of zucchini
soup three or four times a day. The way to evaluate how much to eat is by how much
weight you are losing. When fasting, you must lose weight! And the faster the better.
    Pure absolute water fasting while not taking any vitamins
or other nutritional supplementation has a very limited maximum duration, perhaps
45 days. The key concept here is nutritional reserves. Body fat is stored, surplus
energy fuel. But energy alone cannot keep a body going. It needs much more than fuel
to rebuild and repair and maintain its systems. So the body in its wisdom also stores
up vitamins and minerals and other essential substances in and in-between all its
cells. Bodies that have been very well nourished for a long time have very large
reserves; poorly nourished ones may have very little set aside for a rainy day. And
it is almost a truism that a sick person has, for quite some time, been a poorly
nourished one. With low nutritional reserves. This fact alone can make it difficult
for a sick person to water fast for enough time to completely heal their damaged
organs and other systems.
    Obese people have fat reserves sufficient to provide energy
for long periods, but rarely can any body, no matter how complete its nutrition was
for years previously, contain sufficient nutritional reserves to support a water
fast of over six weeks. To water fast the very obese down to normal weight can take
months but to make this possible, rather diverse and concentrated nutrition containing
few calories must be given. It is possible to fast even a very slim a person for
quite a bit longer than a month when their body is receiving easily assimilable vitamins
and minerals and small amounts of sugars or other simple carbohydrates.
    I estimate that fasting on raw juices and mineral broths
will result in healing at 25 to 75 percent of the efficiency of water fasting, depending
on the amount of nutrition taken and the amount the juices or broths are diluted.
But juice fasting can permit healing to go on several times longer than water might.
    Fasting on dilute juice and broth can also save the life
of someone whose organs of elimination are insufficiently strong to withstand the
work load created by water fasting. In this sense, juices can be regarded as similar
to the moderators in a nuclear reactor, slowing the process down so it won&quot;t
destroy the container. On a fast of undiluted juice, the healing power drops considerably,
but a person on this regimen, if not sick, is usually capable of working.
    Duration of juice fasts can vary greatly. Most of the time
there is no need to continue fasting after the symptoms causing concern have been
eliminated, and this could happen as quickly as one week or take as long as 60 days
if the person is very obese. Fasters also lose their motivation once the complaint
has vanished. But feeling better is no certain indication that the need to fast has
ended. This points up one of the liabilities of juice fasting; the person is already
eating, their digestive system never shut down and consequently, it is much easier
for them to resume eating. The thing to keep in mind is that if the symptoms return,
the fast was not long enough or the diet was not properly reformed after the fast.
    During a long fast on water or dilute juice, if the body
has used up all of it&quot;s reserves and/or the body has reached skeletal condition,
and the condition or symptoms being addressed persists the fast should be ended,
the person should go on a raw food healing diet. If three to six months on raw food
don&quot;t solve the complaint then another spell of water or dilute juice fasting
should be attempted. Most fasters are incapable of persisting until the body reserves
have been used up because social conditioning is telling them their emaciated-looking
body must be dying when it is actually far from death, but return of true hunger
is the critical indicator that must not be ignored. True hunger is not what most
people think of when they think they are hungry. Few Americans have ever experienced
true hunger. It is not a rumbling in the stomach or a set of uncomfortable sensations
(caused by the beginning of detoxification) you know will go away after eating. True
hunger is an animal, instinctual feeling in the back of one&quot;s throat (not in
the stomach) that demands you eat something, anything, even grass or shoe leather.
    Seriously ill people inevitably start the cleansing process
with a pre-existing and serious mineral deficiencies. I say inevitably because they
likely would not have become ill had they been properly nourished. Sick fasters may
be wise to take in minerals from thin vegetable broths or vitamin-like supplements
in order to prevent uncomfortable deficiency states. For example calcium or magnesium
deficiencies can make water fasters experience unpleasant symptoms such as hand tremors,
stiff muscles, cramps in the hands, feet, and legs, and difficulty relaxing. I want
to stress here that fasting itself does not create deficiencies. But a person already
deficient in minerals should watch for these symptoms and take steps to remedy the
deficiencies if necessary.

 Raw Food Healing Diets 
    Next in declining order of healing effectiveness is what
I call a raw food healing diet or cleansing diet. It consists of those very same
watery fruits and nonstarchy vegetables one juices or makes into vegetable broths,
but eaten whole and raw. Heating food does two harmful things: it destroys many vitamins,
enzymes and other nutritional elements and it makes many foods much harder to digest.
So no cooked vegetables or fruits are allowed because to maintain health on this
limited regimen it is essential that every possible vitamin and enzyme present in
the food be available for digestion. Even though still raw, no starchy or fatty vegetables
or fruits are allowed that contain concentrated calories like potatoes, winter squash,
avocados, sweet potatoes, fresh raw corn, dates, figs, raisins, or bananas. And naturally,
no salad dressings containing vegetable oils or (raw) ground seeds are allowed. Nor
are raw grains or other raw concentrated energy sources.
    When a person starts this diet they will at first experience
considerable weight loss because it is difficult to extract a large number of calories
from these foods (though I have seen people actually gain weight on a pure melon
diet, so much sugar do these fruits have, and well-chewed watermelon seeds are very
nourishing). Eating even large quantities of only raw fruit and raw non-starchy vegetables
results in a slow but steady healing process about 10 to 20 percent as rapid as water
fasting.
    A raw food cleansing diet has several huge advantages. It
is possible to maintain this regimen and regularly do non-strenuous work for many
months, even a year or more without experiencing massive weight loss and, more important
to some people, without suffering the extremes of low blood sugar, weakness and loss
of ability to concentrate that happen when water fasting. Someone on a raw food cleanse
will have periods of lowered energy and strong cravings for more concentrated foods,
but if they have the self-discipline to not break their cleansing process they can
accomplish a great deal of healing while still maintaining more or less normal (though
slower paced) life activities. However, almost no one on this diet is able to sustain
an extremely active life-style involving hard physical labor or competitive sports.
And from the very beginning someone on a raw food cleanse must be willing and able
to lie down and rest any time they feel tired or unable to face their responsibilities.
Otherwise they will inevitably succumb to the mental certainty that their feelings
of exhaustion or overwhelm can be immediately solved by eating some concentrated
food to&quot;give them energy.&quot;Such low-energy states will, however, pass
quickly after a brief nap or rest.
    Something else gradually happens to a body when on such a
diet. Do you recall that I mentioned that after my own long fast I began to get more&quot;mileage&quot;out of my food. A cleansed, healed body becomes far more efficient
at digestion and assimilation; a body that is kept on a raw food cleansing diet will
initially lose weight rapidly, but eventually weight loss slows to virtually nothing
and then stabilizes. However, long-term raw fooders are usually thin as toothpicks.
    Once starchy vegetables like potatoes or winter squash, raw
or cooked, or any cereals, raw or cooked, are added to a cleansing diet, the detoxification
and healing virtually ceases and it becomes very easy to maintain or even gain weight,
particularly if larger quantities of more concentrated foods like seeds and nuts
are eaten. Though this diet has ceased to be cleansing, few if any toxins from misdigestion
will be produced and health is easy to maintain.
    &quot;Raw fooders&quot;are usually people who have healed
themselves of a serious diseases and ever after continue to maintain themselves on
unfired food, almost as a matter of religious belief. They have become convinced
that eating only raw, unfired food is the key to extraordinarily long life and supreme
good health. When raw fooders wish to perform hard physical work or strenuous exercise,
they&quot;ll consume raw nuts and some raw grains such as finely-ground oats soaked
overnight in warm water or deliciously sweet&quot;Essene bread,&quot;made from
slightly sprouted wheat that is then ground wet, made into cakes, and sun baked at
temperatures below about 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Essene bread can be purchased in
some health food stores. However, little or no healing or detoxification can happen
once concentrated energy sources are added to the diet, even raw ones.
    During my days at Great Oaks School I was a raw fooder for
some years, though I found it very difficult to maintain body heat on raw food during
chilly, rainy Oregon winters and eventually struck a personal compromise where I
ate about half my diet raw and the rest fired. I have listed some books by raw fooders
in the Bibliography. Joe Alexander&quot;s is the most fun.

 Complete Recovery Of The Seriously Ill 
    Its a virtual certainty that to fully recover, a seriously
ill person will have to significantly rebuild numerous organs. They have a hard choice:
to accept a life of misery, one that the medical doctors with drugs and surgery may
be able to prolong into an interminable hell on earth, or, spend several years working
on really healing their body, rotating between water fasting, juice or broth fasting,
extended periods on a cleansing raw food diet, and periods of no-cleansing on a more
complete diet that includes moderate amounts of cooked vegetables and small quantities
of cooked cereals. And even after recovery someone who was quite ill may have to
live the rest of their life on a rather restricted regimen.
    It is unrealistic to expect one fast to fix everything. The
body will heal as much as it can in the allotted time, but if a dangerous illness
has not been fully remedied by the first intense fast, a raw food diet must be followed
for three to six months until weight has been regained, nutritional reserves have
been rebuilt and it is safe to undertake another extended fast. More than two water
or juice fasts a year of thirty continuous days are not recommended nor should they
be necessary unless the life is in imminent danger and there is no other option.
    The story of Jake&quot;s catastrophic illness and almost-cure
is a good example of this type of program. Jake was from back East. He phoned me
because he had read a health magazine article I had written, his weak voice faintly
describing a desperate condition. He was in a wheelchair unable to walk, unable to
control his legs or arms very well, was unable to control his bladder and required
a catheter. He had poor bowel control, had not the strength to talk much or loudly
and most frightening to him, he was steadily losing weight although he was eating
large amounts of cooked vegetables and grains. Jake had wasted away to 90 pounds
at 5&quot;10&quot;and looked pathetic when I first saw him wheeled off an airplane
at my local airport.
    Jake had seen a lot of medical doctors and had variously
been diagnosed as having chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic (whatever that is) meningitis,
and multiple sclerosis. He had been treated by virtually every medical expert and
many famous alternative practitioners, utilizing a host of old and new techniques,
all to no avail. He had even tried intravenous chelation therapy and colonics. It
had also been suggested that he enter a hospital for the treatment of eating disorders
and/or see a psychiatrist. He had tried to gain admittance to a number of holistic
fasting institutions back east, but they all refused him because they considered
the risk was too high to fast a person at such a low body weight. But I had previously
fasted emaciated people like Jake, and there was something I liked about his telephone
presence. Perhaps this is why I foolishly decided I knew better than the other experts.
    People commonly waste away and die while eating large amounts
of food. Obviously they are unable to digest or assimilate nutrients or they wouldn&quot;t
be wasting. Eating further increases their toxic burden from undigested meals, further
worsening their already failing organs. The real solution is to stop feeding them
altogether so that their digestive functions can heal. In Jake&quot;s case, his body&quot;s
nutritional reserves had already become sadly depleted due to poor absorption over
such an extended period, so I could not fast him on water. I immediately put Jake
on a rich mineral broth prepared from everything left alive in our garden at the
end of winter--leaves of kale, endive plants, whole huge splitting Savoy cabbages,
garlic, huge leeks including their green tops, the whole stew fortified with sea
weed. It did not matter too much what vegetables I used as long as there were lots
of leafy greens containing lots of chlorophyll (where the most concentrated mineral
nutrition is located).
    Jake was given colonics every day, but had to be carried
to the colonic table because he could not support his own weight. Whoever had given
him colonics previously had not accomplished much for I must say that Jake had the
most foul smelling discharges that I had ever encountered in administering over 6,000
colonics over many years. It was as if his body was literally rotting from the inside
out.
    After 30 days on mineral broth Jake, who really did weigh
90 pounds when he arrived, was only down to 85! When a person already close to skeletal
weight starts fasting, to conserve vital tissue the body goes rapidly into a state
of profound rest so it uses very little energy, thus it loses very little weight
each day. This degree of resting also helps heal abnormal body parts earlier. After
one month on mineral broth Jake began to show signs of mineral deficiencies in the
form of a fine tremor of the hands, and cramps in the feet, so I put him on mineral
supplements too.
    Jake was in my house for a long time. At the end of the second
month on broth he started two weeks on raw carrot juice with a lot of chlorophyll
added from sources such as algae (spirulina), wheat grass juice, alfalfa, etc.. This
was followed by two more weeks on small quantities of raw fruits and vegetables,
and then followed by two weeks with added steamed vegetables, and finally, he achieved
a diet which included small amounts of grain, cooked legumes and raw nuts, plus the
fruits and vegetables previously mentioned. Jake health steadily improved. He gained
control of his bladder, bowels, speech, hands, and legs. He began to exercise in
the living room on a stationary bike, and walked slowly up and down our long driveway,
picking daffodils in the beautiful spring weather.
    Sadly, though I could help his body to heal it was next to
impossible to stem the tides of Jake&quot;s appetites or to pleasantly withstand
his tantrums when he was denied; he always wanted more in terms of quantity, more
in terms of variety, and at more frequent intervals. Though his organs had healed
significantly, his digestive capacity was not nearly as large as he remembered himself
enjoying before he got sick. And never would be. Jake was not happy about the dietary
restrictions necessary for him to retain his newly attained health, and unwilling
to stay within the limits of his digestive system&quot;s ability to process foods.
He had gained weight and was back up to 120 pounds. It was time for him to go home
before I lost my good humor.
    Jake left with a lot of&quot;good lucks&quot;and stern
admonitions to stick to his stringent diet and supplement program. It was a big moment
for Jake. He had arrived in a wheelchair three months before. Now he walked unaided
to the airplane, something he had not been able to do for two years.
    Back at home Jake had no one courageous enough to set limits
for him. His immediate family and every one of his brow beaten associates were compelled
to give him everything that he wanted. So his appetite and lack of personal discipline
got the better of him. He started eating lots of dates and figs. These had been eliminated
from his diet because he was unable to process foods which such a high sugar content.
He also ate larger and larger quantities of grains, nuts and avocados, although I
had warned him of specific quantity limits on rich foods. Most sadly, he returned
to enjoying spaghetti with lots of cheese grated on top. Within months of leaving
my care his paralysis and weakness returned, except that unfortunately for him, he
still retained the ability to assimilate food and maintain his body weight. Ironically,
the only ultimate benefit of his fasting with me was to permit him to suffer a far
longer existence in a wheelchair without wasting away and escaping into death.
    I would be failing my readers if I did not explain why Jake
became ill in the first place. Jake had started what grew to become a very successful
chain of spaghetti restaurants with a unique noodles and sauces made to his own formula.
He ate a lot of his own spaghetti over the years, and had been reared in a good Italian
family with lots of other kinds of rich food. Jake had a reputation for being able
to outeat everybody in terms of quantity and in the amount of time spent eating.
In childhood, this ability had made his Italian mother very happy because it showed
appreciation for her great culinary skill.
    Secondly, Jake the adult was still at his core, Jake the
spoiled brat child, with a bad, unregulated temper. He was in the habit of dumping
his temper on other people whether they needed a helping of his angry emotions or
not. A lot of people in his employ and in his extended family tiptoed around Jake,
always careful of triggering his wrath. At my place as Jake began to get well he
began to use his increased energy and much stronger voice to demonstrate his poor
character. At meal times Jake would bang the table with a fork hard enough to leave
dents in the wood table top while yelling for more, complaining loudly about the
lack of rich sauces and other culinary delights he craved. This was a character problem
that Jake could not seem to overcome, even with a lot of intervention from the local
minister on his behalf and my counseling. Jake was a Catholic who went to church
regularly, but acted like a Christian only while he was in church. On some level
Jake knew that he was not treating others fairly, but he would not change his habitual
responses. His negative thoughts and actions interfered with his digestive capacity
to the extent that his gluttonous eating habits produced illness, a vegetative paralyzing
illness, but not death. To me this seems almost a form of karmic justice.
    It is common for people who have been very ill for extended
periods of time to realize what a wonderful gift life is and arrive at a willingness
to do almost anything to have a second chance at doing &apos;life&quot;right. Some succeed
with their second chance and some don&quot;t. If they don&quot;t succeed in changing
their life and relationships, they frequently relapse.
    Luigi Cornaro&quot;s left the world his story of sickness
and rejuvenation. His little book may be the world&quot;s first alternative healing
text. It is a classic example of the value of abstentousness. Had Jake taken this
story to heart he would have totally recovered. Cornaro was a sixteenth century Venetian
nobleman. He, like Jake the spaghetti baron, was near death at the young age of forty.
(Jake was also in his early 40s when he broke down.) Cornaro&quot;s many doctors
were unable to cure him. Finally he saw a doctor who understood the principles of
natural healing. This wise physician determined that this illness was caused by a
mismatch between Cornaro&quot;s limited digestive capacity and the excessive amount
of food he was eating. So Cornaro was put on a diet of only 12 ounces of solid food
and fourteen ounces of liquid a day. Any twelve ounces of any solids he wanted and
any fourteen ounces of liquid. It could be meat and wine, salad or orange juice,
no matter.
    Cornaro soon regained his health and he continued to follow
the diet until the age of 78. His health was so outstanding during this period that
people who were much younger in terms of years were unable to keep up with him. At
78 his friends, worried about how thin he was (doesn&quot;t it always seem that it
is your so-called friends who always ruin a natural cure) persuaded him to increase
his daily ration by two ounces a day. His delicate and weak digestive system, which
had operated perfectly for many years, was unable to deal with the additional two
ounces, and he became very ill after a very short period of over eating.
    Worse, his recent indulgence had even further damaged the
organs of digestion and to survive Cornaro had to cut his daily ration to eight ounces
of solid food and eleven of liquids. On this reduced dietary he again regained his
health and lived to be 100. Cornaro wrote four books on the value of abstinence or&quot;sober living&quot;as he called it, writing the last and perhaps the most interesting
at 96 years of age. Had my patient Jake been able to confine his food intake to the
level of his body&quot;s ability to digest, he might still be walking and enjoying
life. But try as I might I could not make him understand. Perhaps he enjoys doing
penance in his wheel chair more than he would enjoy health and life.

University of Minnesota Press. 


 Starvation 
    It is true that ethical medical doctors use the least-risky
procedure they are allowed to use. But this does not mean there are no risks to allopathic
treatment. The medical doctor justifies taking the risks by saying that the risk/reward
ratio is the best possible. Any sick person is already at risk. Life comes with only
one guarantee: that none of us gets out of it alive.
    Compared to the risks of allopathic medicine, fasting is
a far safer method of treating disease. The oft-repeated scare stories medical doctors
and their allies circulate about fasting are not true, and it is important to remember
that none of these people portraying fasting as evil and dangerous have ever fasted
themselves--I&quot;ll put money on that one. Or, on the slim possibility that someone
telling fasting horror stories did actually not eat for 24 hours (probably because
some accident or acute illness prevented them), they had a terrible experience because
they didn&quot;t understand the process, were highly toxic, and were scared to death
the whole time.
    Or worse yet they fasted for a short period with an&quot;open
mind&quot;--a very dangerous state in which to approach anything new. I have found
through considerable experience with people professing to have open minds that the
expression&quot;I&quot;m open minded&quot;usually means that someone has already
made up their mind and new data just passes straight through their open mind--in one
ear and out the other. Or sometimes, the phrase&quot;open mind&quot;means a person
that does not believe any information has reality and is entirely unable to make
up their mind.
    The most commonly leveled criticism of fasting is that in
its efforts to survive self-imposed starvation the body metabolizes vital tissue,
not just fat, and therefore, fasting is damaging, potentially fatally damaging. People
who tell you this will also tell you that fasters have destroyed their heart muscle
or ruined their nervous system permanently. But this kind of damage happen only when
a person starves to death or starves to a point very close to death, not when someone
fasts.
    There is a huge difference between fasting and starvation.
Someone starving is usually eating, but eating poorly and inadequately, eating scraps
of whatever is available such as sugar, white flour, rancid grease, shoe leather,
or even dirt. Frequently a starving person is forced to exercise a great deal as
they struggle to survive and additionally is highly apprehensive. Or someone starving
to death is confined to a small space, may become severely dehydrated too and is
in terror. Fear is very damaging to the digestive process, and to the body in general;
fear speeds up the destruction of vital tissue. People starve when trekking vast
distances through wastelands without food to eat, they starved in concentration camps,
buried in mind disasters, they starve during famines and starve while being tortured
in prisons.
    Until water fasting goes on past the point where all fatty
tissues and all abnormal deposits have been burned for fuel and recycled for the
nutritional elements they contain, vital muscle tissues and organs are not consumed.
And as long as the body contains sufficient nutritional reserves, vital organs and
essential tissues are rebuilt and maintained. In fact the body has a great deal of
intelligence that we don&quot;t give it credit for. It knows exactly which cells
are essential to survival, which ones are not. The body knows which cells are abnormal
deposits, and it goes to work to metabolize them first. For example, the body recognizes
arthritic deposits, cysts, fibroids, and tumors as offensive parts of the landscape,
and obligingly uses them for foods in preference to anything else. A starving (not
fasting) body also knows precisely in what order of priority body cells should be
metabolized to minimize risk of death or permanent disability.
    After a starving body has reached skeletal condition, or
where some small amount of fat remains but nutritional reserves (vitamins and minerals)
are exhausted and there is insufficient nourishment forthcoming, the body begins
to consume nutrient-rich muscle and organ tissue in a last-ditch effort to stay alive.
Under these dire circumstances, the least essential muscles and organs from the standpoint
of survival are metabolized first. For example, muscles in the arms and legs would
be consumed early in the process, the heart muscle used only toward the very end.
The very last part of the body to be metabolized when one is starving and as has
come very close to death would be the brain and the nervous system.
    Starvation begins where fasting ends, which is when real
hunger begins. If the return of hunger is ignored whenever it takes place, whether
it is in 30, 60, or 90 days depending upon body weight and type of fast, at that
point exactly, not a day before, starvation begins very slowly. Usually it takes
a considerable period of time after that before death occurs. It is important to
note that this discussion applies only to the abstention from food, not water. Death
takes place very quickly in the absence of water.
    The chart on the previous page shows numerically the phenomenal
ability of the body to protect the most essential tissues of the body right up to
the time of death. If a person fasted for 30 days, the average time it takes for
the return of hunger in a person that is not overweight, and then ignored the return
of hunger, and continued to abstain from food--if the person could avoid forced exercise,
keep warm, and had enough hydration, it could take as much as an additional 20 to
60 days to die of starvation! At death the body would have experienced losses of
40 to 60 percent of its starting body weight. (Ancel Keys et al, 1950) A emaciated
person can not afford to lose nearly as much weight as an obese person, and death
under conditions of starvation will occur earlier. In all cases of starvation the
brain, nerves, heart, lungs, kidneys and liver remain largely intact and functional
to the very end. During a fast, it is almost impossible to damage essential organs,
unless of course the person creates the damage by fears about the process, or by
internalizing the fears of others. If those fears are present, the fast should not
be attempted.

 Weight Loss By Fasting 
    Loss of weight indicates, almost guarantees, that detoxification
and healing is occurring. I can&quot;t stress this too much. Of all the things I
find my patients seem to misunderstand or forget after being told, it is that they
can&quot;t heal in a rapid manner without getting smaller. This reality is especially
hard for the family and friends of someone who is fasting, who will say,&quot;you&quot;re
looking terrible dear, so thin. Your skin is hanging on your bones. You&quot;re not
eating enough protein or nutrient food to be healthy and you must eat more or you&quot;re
going to develop serious deficiencies. You don&quot;t have any energy, you must be
getting sicker. You&quot;re doing the wrong thing, obviously. You have less energy
and look worse every day. Go and see a doctor before it is too late.&quot;To succeed
with friends like this, a faster has to be a mighty self-determined person with a
powerful ability to disagree with others.
    Medical personnel claim that rapid weight loss often causes
dangerous deficiencies; these deficiencies force the person to overeat and regain
even more weight afterward. This is largely untrue, though there is one true aspect
to it: a fasted, detoxified body becomes a much more efficient digester and assimilator,
extracting a lot more nutrition from the same amount food is used to eat. If, after
extended fasting a person returns to eating the same number of calories as they did
before; they will gain weight even more rapidly than before they stated fasting.
When fasting for weight loss, the only way to keep the weight off is to greatly reform
the diet; to go on, and stay on, a diet made up largely of non-starchy, watery fruits
and vegetables, limited quantities of cooked food, and very limited amounts of highly
concentrated food sources like cereals and cooked legumes. Unless, of course, after
fasting, one&quot;s lifestyle involves much very hard physical labor or exercise.
I&quot;ve had a few obese fasters become quite angry with me for this reason; they
hoped to get thin through fasting and after the fast, to resume overeating with complete
irresponsibility as before, without weight gain.
    People also fear weight loss during fasting because they
fear becoming anorexic or bulimic. They won&quot;t! A person who abstains from eating
for the purpose of improving their health, in order to prevent or treat illness,
or even one who fasts for weight loss will not develop an eating disorder. Eating
disorders mean eating compulsively because of a distorted body image. Anorexics and
bulimics have obsessions with the thinner-is-better school of thought. The anorexic
looks at their emaciated frame in the mirror and thinks they are fat! This is the
distorted perception of a very insecure person badly in need of therapy. A bulimic,
on the other hand stuffs themselves, usually with bad food, and then purges it by
vomiting, or with laxatives. Anorexics and bulimics are not accelerating the healing
potential of their bodies; these are life threatening conditions. Fasters are genuinely
trying to enhance their survival potential.
    Occasionally a neurotic individual with a pre-existing eating
disorder will become obsessed with fasting and colon cleansing as a justification
to legitimize their compulsion. During my career while monitoring hundreds of fasters,
I&quot;ve known two of these. I discourage them from fasting or colon cleansing,
and refuse to assist them, because they carry the practices to absurd extremes, and
contribute to bad press about natural medicine by ending up in the emergency ward
of a hospital with an intravenous feeding tube in their arm.

 Cases Beyond The Remedy Of Fasting 
    Occasionally, very ill people have a liver that has become
so degenerated it cannot sustain the burden of detoxification. This organ is as vital
to survival as the brain, heart and lungs. We can get along with only one kidney,
we can live with no spleen, with no gallbladder, with only small parts of the stomach
and intestines, but we can not survive without a liver for more than a day or so.
The liver is the most active organ in the body during detoxification. To reach an
understanding of detoxification, it helps to know just what the liver does for us
on an ongoing basis.
    The liver is a powerful chemical filter where blood is refined
and purified. The liver passes this cleansed blood out through the superior vena
cava, directly to the heart. The blood is then pumped into general and systemic circulation,
where it reaches all parts of the body, delivering nutrition and oxygen at a cellular
level. On its return flow, a large proportion of the depleted blood is collected
by the gastric, splenic and superior and inferior mesenteric veins that converge
to form the large portal vein which enters the liver. Thus a massive flow of waste
from all the cells of the body is constantly flowing into the liver. The huge hepatic
artery also enters the liver to supply oxygen and nutrients with which to sustain
the liver cells themselves.
    The liver is constantly at work refining the blood. It is
synthesizing, purifying, renovating, washing, filtering, separating, and detoxifying.
It works day and night without stopping. Many toxins are broken down by enzymes and
their component parts are efficiently reused in various parts of the body. Some impurities
are filtered out and held back from the general circulation. These debris are collected
and stored in the gall bladder, which is a little sack appended to the liver. After
a meal, the contents of the gall bladder (bile) are discharged into the duodenum,
the upper part of the small intestine just beyond the stomach. This bile also contains
digestive enzymes produced by the liver that permit the breakdown of fatty foods
in the small intestine.
    Sometimes a large flow of bile finds its way into the stomach
by pressure or is sucked into the stomach by vomiting. Excessive biliary secretion
and excretion can also result from overeating, which overcrowds the area. Sometimes
colonics or massage can also stimulate a massive flow of bile. Extremely bitter and
irritating, when bile gets into the stomach the person either vomits or wishes they
could. And after vomiting and experiencing the taste of bile, wishes they hadn&quot;t.
    When no food at all enters the system, the blood keeps right
on passing through the liver/filter just as it does when we are eating. When the
liver does not have to take care of toxins generated by the current food intake,
each passage through the liver results in a cleaner blood stream, with the debris
decreasing in quantity, viscosity, and toxicity, until the blood becomes normalized.
During fasting, debris from the gall bladder still pass through the small intestine
and into the large intestine. However, if the bowels do not move the toxins in the
bile are readsorbed into the blood stream and get recirculated in an endless loop.
This toxic recycling makes a faster feel just terrible, like they had a flu or worse!
    The bowels rarely move while fasting. During fasting only
enemas or colonics permit elimination from the large intestine. If done effectively
and frequently, enemas will greatly add to the well being and comfort of the faster.
Many times when a faster seems to be retracing or experiencing a sudden onset of
acute discomfort or symptoms, these can be almost immediately relieved by an enema
or colonic.
    A person with major liver degeneration inevitably dies, with
or without fasting, with or without traditional medicine. Significantly impaired
kidney function can also bring about this same result. Mercifully, death while fasting
is usually accomplished relatively free of pain, clear of mind and with dignity.
That often can not be said of death in a hospital. There are much worse experiences
than death.
    Fasting is not a cure-all. There are some conditions that
are beyond the ability of the body to heal. Ultimately, old age gets us all.
    Dr. Linda Hazzard, one of the greats of natural hygiene,
who practiced Osteopathic medicine in the 1920s, had a useful way of categorizing
conditions that respond well to fasting. These she labeled&quot;acute conditions,&quot;and&quot;chronic degenerative conditions.&quot;A third classification,&quot;chronic
conditions with organic damage,&quot;does not respond to fasting. Acute conditions,
are usually inflammations or infections with irritated tissue, with swelling, redness,
and often copious secretions of mucous and pus, such as colds, flu, a first time
case of pneumonia, inflamed joints as in the early stages of arthritis, etc. These
acute conditions usually remedy in one to three weeks of fasting. Acute conditions
are excellent candidates for self-doctoring. Chronic degenerative conditions are
more serious and the patient usually requires supervision. These include conditions
such as cancer, aids, chronic arthritis, chronic pneumonia, emphysema and asthma.
Chronic degenerative conditions usually respond within a month to three months of
fasting. The fasting should be broken up into two or three sessions if the condition
has not been relieved in one stint of supervised fasting. Each successive fast will
produce some improvement and if a light, largely raw-food diet is adhered to between
fasts the patient should not worsen and should be fairly comfortable between fastings.
    If there has been major functional damage to an organ as
a result of any of these degenerative conditions, healing will not be complete, or
may be impossible. By organic damage, I mean that a vital part of the body has ceased
to function due to some degenerative process, injury, or surgery--so badly damaged
that the cells that make up the organ can not be replaced.
    I once had a twenty five year old man come to my spa to die
in peace because he had been through enough diagnostic procedures in three hospitals
to know that his liver was beyond repair. He had been working on an apple farm in
between terms at university when he was poisoned several times with insecticide from
an aerial spray on the whole orchard. He absorbed so much insecticide that his liver
incurred massive organic damage.
    When he came to me his body had reached the point where it
was incapable of digesting, and because of lack of liver function, it was incapable
of healing while fasting, a condition in which death is a certainty. He was a Buddhist,
did not fear death and did not want to be kept alive in agony or in prolonged unconsciousness
by any extraordinary means, nor did he want to die with tubes in every orifice. I
was honored to be a supportive participant in his passing. He died fasting, in peace,
and without pain, with a clear mind that allowed him to consciously prepare for the
experience. He was not in a state of denial or fear, and made no frantic attempts
to escape the inevitable. He went quietly into that still dark night with a tranquil
demeanor and a slight smile.
    Fortunately, in my many years of practice I had the pleasure
of seeing the majority of the people totally regain their health or at least greatly
improve it by means of the fasting and healing diets. Many cancer patients watched
with amazement as their tumors disappeared before their eyes, many arthritics regained
their function, serious skin conditions such as psoriasis disappeared, mental conditions
improved, addictions vanished, fatigue was replaced by energy, and fat dissolved
revealing the hidden sculpture beneath. I will talk more about procedures and the
particular reasons bodies develop specific conditions in later chapters.

 Social/Cultural/Psychological Obstacles To Fasting 
    Numerous attitudes make it difficult to fast or to provide
moral support to friends or loved ones that are fasting. Many people harbor fears
of losing weight because they think that if times were really tough, if there was
a famine or they became ill and lost a lot of weight they would have no reserves
and would certainly perish. These people have no idea how much fat can be concealed
on an even skinny body, nor of how slowly a skinny body loses weight while fasting.
Substantial fat reserves are helpful as heat-retaining insulation in those rare accidents
when someone is dropped into a cold ocean and must survive until the rescue boat
arrives. Being fat might keep a person alive longer who is lost in the wilderness
awaiting rescue with no supplies, no means of procuring food, and no means of keeping
warm. On the other hand, fat people would have a far harder time walking out of the
wilderness. And extensive fat deposits are merely fuel and do not contain extensive
nutritional reserves. An obese person fasting without significant nutritional supplementation
would begin starving long before they became really skinny. On the balance, carrying
excess weight is a far greater liability than any potential prosurvival aspects it
might have.
    There are other attitudes associated with weight loss that
make it difficult for people to fast. People hold rather stereotypical notions about
what constitutes an attractive person; usually it involves having some meat on ones
bones. Hollywood and Hugh Hefner have both influenced the masses to think that women
should have hourglass figures with large, upthrust, firm breasts. Since breasts are
almost all useless fatty tissue supporting some milk-producing glands that do not
give a breast much volume except when engorged, most women fasters loose a good percentage
of their breast mass. If the fast is extensive, there should also develop an impressive
showing of ribs and hip bones; these are not soft and cuddly. Husbands, lovers, parents,
and friends frequently point out that you don&quot;t look good this way and exhort
you to put on weight. Most people think pleasantly plump is healthy.
    Skinny men, especially those who had lost a lot of weight
during an illness, are pressured by associates to put on weight to prove that they
are healthy. I had a client who was formerly a college varsity football player. Before
his illness he had lifted weights and looked like a hunk. His family and friends
liked to see him that way and justifiably so. Then he got seriously ill. On a long
extended healing diet he lost a significant amount of weight and seemed down right
skinny, causing all who knew him well and cared about him to tempt him with all kinds
of scrumptious delicacies from the best of kitchens. But this case was like Luigi
Cornaro, a man who never again could look like a hunk. His&quot;friends&quot;made
an absolutely necessary change in life style and appearance far more difficult than
it was already. My client was torn between a desire to please others, and a desire
to regain and retain his health. This problem a sick person doesn&quot;t need.
    If you have the independence to consider following an alternative
medical program in a culture that highly values conformity and agreement, you are
also going to have to defend your own course of self-determined action based on the
best available data that you have. But fasters are usually in fragile emotional condition,
so I advise my clients who are subjected to this kind of pressure to beg their friends
and associates to refrain from saying anything if they can&quot;t support the course
of action you have chosen. After this, if friends or relatives are still incapable
of saying nothing (even non-verbally), it is important to exclude them from your
life until you have accomplished your health goals, have regained some weight and
have returned to eating a maintenance diet, rather than getting skinnier on a healing
one.
    The very worst aspect of our culture&quot;s eating programming
is that people have been wrongfully taught that when ill they must eat to keep up
their strength. Inherent in this recommendation is an unstated belief that when the
body is weakened by a disease state, the weakness can somehow be overcome with food,
and that the body needs this food to kill the virus, bacteria, or invading yeast,
and uses the protein to heal or rebuild tissue. Sadly, the exact opposite is the
case. Disease organisms feed and multiply on the toxic waste products of misdigestion,
and the body is unable to digest well when it is weak or ill.
    There&quot;s an old saying about this: &apos;feed a cold, starve
a fever.&quot;Most people think this saying means you should eat when you have a
cold. What the saying really means is if you feed a cold then you will soon have
to starve a fever. Protein foods especially are not digested by a diseased body,
and as mentioned before, the waste products of protein indigestion are especially
poisonous. That is all the body needs when it is already down, another load of poison
which it can&quot;t eliminate due to weakness and enervation.
    Weight loss is usually associated with illness, as it should
be! In times of acute illness an otherwise healthy body loses its appetite for food
because it is prosurvival to stop eating. It is very hard to coax a sick animal to
eat. Their bodies, not controlled by a mind full of complex learned responses and
false ideas, automatically know that fasting is nature&quot;s method of healing.
Contrary to popular understanding, digestion, assimilation, and elimination require
the expenditure of considerable energy. This fact may contradict the reader&quot;s
experience because everyone has become tired when they have worked a long time without
eating, and then experienced the lift after eating. But an ill body cannot digest
efficiently so instead of providing energy extracted from foods, the body is further
burdened by yet another load of toxic material produced by fermented and putrefied
food. This adds insult to injury in a sick body that is already drowning in its own
garbage.
    Worse, during illness most available vital force is already
redirected into healing; it is not available for digestion. It is important to allow
a sick body to proceed with healing and not to obstruct the process with unnecessary
digestion or suppress the symptoms (which actually are the healing efforts) with
drugs. If you have an acute illness, and you stop all food intake except for pure
water and herb teas, and perhaps some vegetable broth, or dilute non-sweet juice,
you have relieved your body of an immense effort. Instead of digesting, the body
goes to work on catching up on healing. The body can and will almost inevitably heal
itself if the sick person will have faith in it, cooperate with the body&quot;s efforts
by allowing the symptoms of healing to exist, reduce or eliminate the intake of food
to allow the body to marshal its energies, maintain a positive mental attitude and
otherwise stay out of the way.
    Many people intensely dread missing even one meal. These
folks usually are and have been so toxic that their bodies had been stashing uneliminated
toxins in their fat for years. They are usually so addicted to caffeine, cigarettes,
alcohol, and so forth, that when they had fasted, even briefly, their bodies were
forced to dip into highly-polluted fat reserves while simultaneously the body begins
withdrawal. People like this who try to fast experience highly unpleasant symptoms
including headache, irritability, inability to think or concentrate, blurred vision,
profound fatigue, aches, etc. Most of these symptoms come from low blood sugar, but
combined with the toxins being released from fat and combined with going through
multiple addictive withdrawals, the discomforts are more than most people are willing
to tolerate. Fasting on juice is much more realistic for cases like this. It is little
wonder that when a hygienist suggests a fast to improve health, this type of case
asserts positively that fasting is quite impossible, they have tried it, it is absolutely
terrible and know that they can&quot;t do it.
    This rejection is partly due to a cultural expectation (one
reinforced by western medicine) that all unpleasant symptoms should be avoided or
suppressed. To voluntarily experience unpleasant sensations such as those mentioned
above is more than the ordinary timid person will subject themselves to, even in
order to regain health. They will allow surgery, drugs with violent and dangerous
side effects, painful and invasive testing procedures and radiation--all unpleasant
and sometimes extremely uncomfortable. These therapies are accepted because someone
else with authority is doing it to them. And, they have been told that it they don&quot;t
submit they will not ever feel better and probably will die in the near future. Also
people think that they have no alternative, that the expert in front of them knows
what is best, so they feel relieved to have been relieved of the responsibility for
their own condition and its treatment.

 Preventative Fasting 
    During the years it takes for a body to degenerate enough
to prompt a fast, the body has been storing up large quantities of unprocessed toxins
in the cells, tissues, fat deposits, and organs. The body in its wisdom will always
choose to temporarily deposit overwhelming amounts of toxins somewhere harmless rather
than permit the blood supply to become polluted or to use secondary elimination routes.
A body will use times when the liver is less burdened to eliminate these stored toxic
debris. The hygienists&quot;paradigm asserts that the manifestation of symptoms
or illness are all by themselves, absolute, unassailable proof that further storage
of toxic wastes in the cells, tissues, fat deposits, and organs is not possible and
that an effort toward elimination is absolutely necessary. Thus the first time a
person fasts a great quantity of toxins will normally be released. Being the resident
of a body when this is happening can be quite uncomfortable. For this reason alone,
preventative fasting is a very wise idea.
    Before the body becomes critically ill, clean up your reserve
fuel supply (fat deposits) by burning off some accumulated fat that is rich in toxic
deposits and then replace it with clean, non-toxic fat that you will make while eating
sensibly. If you had but fasted prophylactically as a preventative or health-creating
measure before you became seriously ill, the initial detoxification of your body
could have been accomplished far more comfortably, while you were healthy, while
your vital force was high and while your body otherwise more able to deal with detoxification.
    Each time you fast, even if it is only one day, you allow
your body to go through a partial detox, and each time it becomes easier and more
comfortable than the last time. The body learns how to fast. Each time you fast it,
your body slips into a cleansing mode more quickly, and each time you fast you lighten
the load of stored toxins. Perhaps you have already eliminated the caffeine your
body had stored, which frequently causes severe headaches on withdrawal, not to mention
fatigue. It certainly helps to have this behind you before you go on to the elimination
of other irritating substances. Many people have gone through alcohol or tobacco
withdrawal, and understand that it is very unpleasant, and also that it must be done
in the pursuit of health. Why not withdraw from the rest of the irritating and debilitating
substances we take into our system on an ongoing basis, and why not grit your way
through the eliminative process, withdraw, from food addictions such as sugar or
salt, and from foods that you may be allergic to like wheat, dairy products or eggs.
    It is very wise to invest in your own insurance plan by systematically
detoxifying while you are still healthy. Plan it into your life, when it is convenient,
such as once a week on Sunday, or even once a month on a quiet day. Take a few days
of vacation, go to a warm, beautiful place and devote part or all of it to cleansing.
Treat yourself by taking an annual trip to Hawaii, fasting at a hotel on the beach--do
whatever it takes to motivate yourself. And consider this: vacations are enormously
cheaper when you stay out of restaurants.
    If you have accustomed your body to 24 hour fasts, then you
can work on 48 hour fasts, and over time work up to 72 hour fasts, all on a continuum.
You may find it becoming increasingly comfortable, perhaps even pleasant, something
you look forward to. Fasting a relatively detoxified body feels good, and people
eventually really get into the clean, light, clear headed, perhaps spiritually aware
state that goes along with it.
    By contrast, fasting when you are sick is much more difficult
because your vitality or vital force is very low, you already have no energy, and
probably have unpleasant symptoms that must be dealt with at the same time. There
may be the added stress of being forced into a cleanse because you are too nauseous
to eat. Most people let their health go until they are forced into dealing with it;
they are too busy living, so why bother.
    The truth is that our body does age, and over time becomes
less able to deal with insults; the accumulated effect of insults and aging eventually
leads most of us to some serious degenerative illness. Normally this begins happening
around age 50 if not sooner. Some of us that were gifted with good genes or what
I call&quot;a good start&quot;may have reached the age of 60 or 75 or even 90 without
serious illness, but those people are few and far between. Why not tip the scales
in your favor by preventing or staving off health problems with systematic detoxification
at your own convenience.
    Climb into the drivers seat and start to take control and
gain confidence in your own ability to deal with your body, your own health, and
your own life. When it gets right down to the bottom line, there is really only one
thing in the world that is really yours, and that is your life. Take control and
start managing it. The reward will be a more qualitative life.


 Chapter Four 
 Colon Cleansing 


 From The Hygienic Dictionary 
 
 Autointoxication. [1] the accumulations on the bowel wall become a breeding
ground for unhealthy bacterial life forms. The heavy mucus coating in the colon thickens
and becomes a host for putrefaction. The blood capillaries to the colon begin to
pick up the toxins, poisons and noxious debris as it seeps through the bowel wall.
All tissues and organs of the body are now taking on toxic substances. Here is the
beginning of true autointoxication on a physiological level. Bernard Jensen, Tissue
Cleansing Through Bowel Management. [2] All maladies are due to the lack of certain
food principles, such as mineral salts or vitamins, or to the absence of the normal
defenses of the body, such as the natural protective flora. When this occurs, toxic
bacteria invade the lower alimentary canal, and the poisons thus generated pollute
the bloodstream and gradually deteriorate and destroy every tissue, gland and organ
of the body. Sir Arbuthnot Lane. [3] The common cause of gastro-intestinal
indigestion is enervation and overeating When food is not digested, it becomes a
poison. Dr. John.H. Tilden, Impaired Health: Its Cause and Cure, 1921. [4] a clogging
up of the large intestine by a building up (on) the bowel wall to such an extent
that feces can hardly pass through. autointoxication is a direct result of intestinal
constipation. Faulty nutrition is a major underlying factor in constipation. The
frequency or quantity of fecal elimination is not an indication of the lack of constipation
in the bowel. Bernard Jensen, Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management. 


    I am not a true believer in any single healing method or
system. I find much truth in many schools and use a wide variety of techniques. The
word for my inclination is eclectic.
    The most effective medicine in my arsenal is water fasting
followed closely in potency by other, less rigorous detoxifying diets. Colon cleansing
ranks next in healing power. In fact it is difficult to separate colon cleansing
from fasting because detoxification programs should always be accompanied by colon
cleansing. Further down the scale of efficatiousness comes dietary reform to eliminate
allergic reactions and to present the body with foods it is capable of digesting
without creating toxemia. Last, and usually least in effectiveness in my arsenal,
are orthotropic substances (in the form of little pills and capsules) commonly known
as vitamins or food supplements.
    Interestingly, acceptance of these methods by my clients
runs in exact opposition to their effectiveness. People prefer taking vitamins because
they seem like the allopaths&apos; pills, taking pills demands little or no responsibility
for change. The least popular prescription I can write is a monodiet of water for
several weeks or a month. Yet this is my most powerful medicine.
    It is possible to resolve many health complaints without
fasting, simply by cleansing the colon and regaining normal lower bowel function.
Colonics take little personal effort and are much easier to get people to accept
than fasting. So I can fully understand how perfectly honest and ethical naturopaths
have developed obsessions with colon cleansing. Some healers have loudly and repeatedly
(and wrongly) proclaimed that constipation is the sole cause of disease, and thus,
the only real cure for any illness is colon cleansing.
    Even though it is possible to have a lot of successes with
the simple (though unpleasant to administer) technique of colon cleansing, degenerated
lower bowels are the only cause of disease. I prefer to use bowel cleansing as an
adjunct to more complete healing programs. However, old classics of hygiene and even
a few new books strongly make the case for colonics. Some of these books are entirely
one-sided, single-cause single-cure approaches, and sound convincing to the layperson.
For this reason, I think I should take a few paragraphs and explain why some otherwise
well-intentioned health professionals have overly-advocated colonics (and other practices
as well).

 Most Diseases Cure Themselves 
    If you ask any honest medical doctor how they cure diseases,
they will tell you that most acute disease conditions and a smaller, though significant
percentage (probably a majority) of chronic disease conditions are self-limiting
and will, given time, get better all by themselves. So for most complaints, the honest
allopathic doctor sees their job as giving comfort and easing the severity of the
symptoms until a cure happens.
    This same scenario, when viewed from a hygienist&apos;s perspective,
is that almost all acute and many chronic conditions are simply the body&apos;s attempt
to handle a crisis of toxemia. For two reasons the current crisis will probably go
away by itself. The positive reason is that the toxic overload will be resolved:
the person changes their dietary habits or the stressor that temporarily lowered
their vital force and produced enervation is removed, then digestion improves and
the level of self-generated toxins is reduced. The negative reason for a complaint
to&quot;cure&quot;itself is that the suffering person&apos;s vital force drops below
the level that the symptom can be manifested and the complaint goes away because
a new, more serious disease is developing.
    I view this second possibility as highly undesirable because
strong, healthy bodies possessing a high degree of vital force are able to eliminate
toxins rather violently, frequently producing very uncomfortable symptoms that are
not life-threatening. However, as the vital force drops, the body changes its routes
of secondary elimination and begins using more centrally located vital organs and
systems to dispose of toxemia. This degeneration producing less unpleasant symptoms,
but in the long run, damages essential organs and moves the person closer to their
final disease.
    A young vigorous body possessing a large degree of vital
force will almost always route surplus toxins through skin tissues and skin-like
mucus membranes, producing repeated bouts of sinusitis, or asthma, or colds, or a
combination of all these. Each acute manifestation will&quot;cure&quot;itself by
itself eventually. But eventually the body&apos;s vital force can no longer create these
aggressive cleansing phenomena and the toxemia begins to go deeper. When the allopathic
doctor gets a patient complaining of sinusitis, they know they will eventually get
a cure. The&quot;cure&quot;however, might well be a case of arthritis.
    This unfortunate reality tends to make young, idealistic
physicians become rather disillusioned about treating degenerative conditions because
the end result of all their efforts is, in the end, death anyway. The best they can
do is to alleviate suffering and to a degree, prolong life. The worst they can do
is to prolong suffering.
    Thus, the physicians main job is to get the patient to be
patient, to wait until the body corrects itself and stops manifesting the undesired
symptom. Thus comes the prime rule of all humane medicine: first of all, do no harm!
If the doctor simply refrains from making the body worse, it will probably get better
by itself. But the patient, rarely resigned to quiet suffering, comes in demanding
fast relief, demanding a cure. In fact, if the patient were resigned to quiet suffering
they would not consult a doctor. So if the doctor wants to keep this patient and
make a living they must do something. If that something the doctor must do does little
or no harm and better yet, can also alleviate the symptoms, the doctor is practicing
good medicine and will have a very high cure rate and be financially successful if
they have a good bedside manner. This kind of doctor may be allopathic and/or&quot;natural,&quot;may use herbs or practice homeopathy.
    The story of Dr. Jennings, a very successful and famous or
infamous (depending on your viewpoint) physician, who practiced in Connecticut in
the early 1800s exemplifies this type of approach.
    Dr. Jennings had his own unique medicines. Their composition
was of his own devising, and were absolutely secret. He had pills and colored bitter
drops of various sorts that were compounded himself in his own pharmacy. Dr. Jennings&apos;
patients generally recovered and had few or no complications. This must be viewed
in contrast to the practices of his fellow doctors of that era, whose black bags
were full of mercury and arsenic and strychnine, whose practices included obligatory
bleeding. These techniques and medicines&quot;worked&quot;by poisoning the body
or by reducing its blood supply and thus lowering its vital force, ending the body&apos;s
ability to manifest the undesirable symptom. If the poor patient survived being victimized
by their own physician, they were tough enough to survive both their disease and
the doctor&apos;s cure. Typically, the sick had many, lengthy complications, long illnesses,
and many&quot;setbacks&quot;requiring many visits, earning the physician a great
living.
    Dr. Jennings operated differently. He would prescribe one
or two secret medicines from his black bag and instruct the patient to stay in bed,
get lots of rest, drink lots of water, eat little and lightly, and continue taking
the medicine until they were well. His cure rate was phenomenal. Demand they might,
but Dr. Jennings would never reveal what was in his pills and vials. Finally at the
end of his career, to instruct his fellow man, Dr. Jennings confessed. His pills
were made from flour dough, various bitter but harmless herbal substances, and a
little sugar. His red and green and black tinctures, prescribed five or ten drips
at a time mixed in a glass of water several times daily, were only water and alcohol,
some colorant and something bitter tasting, but harmless. Placebos in other words.
    Upon confessing, Dr. Jennings had to run for his life. I
believe he ended up retiring on the western frontier, in Indiana. Some of his former
patients were extremely angry because they had paid good money, top dollar for&quot;real&quot;medicines, but were given only flour and water. The fact that they got better didn&apos;t
seem to count.
    If the physicians curative procedure suppresses the symptom
and/or lowers the vital force with toxic drugs or surgery, (either result will often
as not end the complaint) the allopathic doctor is practicing bad medicine. This
doctor too will have a high cure rate and a good business (if they have an effective
bedside manner) because their drugs really do make the current symptoms vanish very
rapidly. Additionally, their practice harmonizes with a common but vicious dramatization
of many people which goes: when a body is malfunctioning, it is a bad body and needs
to be punished. So lets punish it with poisons and if that don&apos;t work, lets really
punish it by cutting out the offending part.
    However, if the physician can do something that will do no
harm but raises the vital force and/or lowers the level of toxemia, this doctor will
have a genuine cure rate higher than either of the two techniques. Why does raising
the vital force help? Because it reduces enervation, improves the digestion, lowers
the creation of new toxins and improves the function of the organs of elimination,
also reducing the toxic overload that is causing the complaint.
    Techniques that temporarily and quickly raise the vital force
include homeopathy, chiropractic, vitamin therapy, massage, acupuncture and acupressure
and many more spiritually oriented practices. Healers who use these approaches and
have a good bedside manner can have a very good business, they can have an especially-profitable
practice if they do nothing to lower the level of toxemia being currently generated.
Their patients do experience prompt relief but must repeatedly take the remedy. This
makes for satisfied customers and a repeat business.
    The best approach of all focuses on reducing the self-generated
level of toxemia, cleansing to remove deposits of old toxemia, rebuilding the organs
of elimination and digestion to prevent the formation of new toxemia, and then, to
alleviate the current symptoms and make it easier for the patient to be patient while
their body heals, the healer raises artificially and temporarily the vital force
with vitamins, massage, acupressure, etc. This wise and benevolent physician is going
to have the highest cure rate among those wise patients who will accept the prescription,
but will not make as much money because the patients permanently get better and no
longer need a physician. There&apos;s not nearly as much repeat business.
    Colonics are one of the best types of medicine. They clean
up deposits of old toxemia (though there are sure to be other deposits in the body&apos;s
tissues colonics do not touch). Colon cleansing reduces the formation of new toxemia
from putrefying fecal matter (but dietary reform is necessary to maximize this benefit).
Most noticeable to the patient, a colonic immediately alleviates current symptoms
by almost instantly reducing the current toxic load. A well-done enema or colonic
is such a powerful technique that a single one will often make a severe headache
vanish, make an onsetting cold go away, end a bout of sinusitis, end an asthmatic
attack, reduce the pain of acute arthritic inflammation, reduce or stop an allergic
reaction. Enemas are also thrifty: they are self-administered and can prevent most
doctor&apos;s visits seeking relief for acute conditions.
    Diseases of the colon itself, including chronic constipation,
colitis, diverteculitis, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome, and mucous colitis,
are often cured solely by an intensive series of several dozen colonics given close
together. Contrary to popular belief, many people think that if they have dysentery
or other forms of loose stools that a colonic is the last thing they need. Surprisingly,
a series of colonics will eliminate many of these conditions as well. People with
chronic diarrhea or loose stools are usually very badly constipated. This may seem
a contradiction in terms but it will be explained shortly.
    A century ago there was much less scientific data about the
functioning of the human body. Then it was easy for a hygienically-oriented physician
to come to believe that colonics were the single best medicine available. The doctor
practicing nothing but colonics will have a very high rate of cure and a lot of very
satisfied clients. Most importantly, this medicine will have done no harm.

 The Repugnant Bowel 
    I don&apos;t know why, but people of our culture have a deep-seated
reluctance to relate to the colon or it&apos;s functions. People don&apos;t want to think about
the colon or personally get involved with it by giving themselves enemas or colonics.
They become deeply embarrassed at having someone else do it for them. People are
also shy about farts, and most Americans have a hard time not smiling or reacting
in some way when someone in their presence breaks wind, although the polite amongst
us pretend that we didn&apos;t notice. Comedians usually succeed in getting a laugh out
of an audience when they come up with a fart or make reference to some other bowel
function. People don&apos;t react the same way to urinary functions or discharges, although
these also may have an unpleasant odor and originate from the same&quot;private&quot;area.
 
    When I first mention to clients that they need a minimum
of 12 colonics or many more enemas than 12 during a fasting or cleansing program
they are inevitably shocked. To most it seems that no one in their right mind would
recommend such a treatment, and that I must certainly be motivated by greed or some
kind of a psychological quirk. Then I routinely show them reproductions of X-rays
of the large intestine showing obvious loss of normal structure and function resulting
from a combination of constipation, the effects of gravity, poor abdominal muscle
tone, emotional stress, and poor diet. In the average colon more than 50% of the
hastrum (muscles that impel fecal matter through the organ) are dysfunctional due
to loss of tone caused by impaction of fecal matter and/or constriction of the large
intestine secondary to stress (holding muscular tension in the abdominal area) and
straining during bowel movement. 
 A typical diseased colon 
 
    The average person also has a prolapsed (sagging) transverse
colon, and a distorted misplaced ascending and descending colon. I took a course
in colon therapy before purchasing my first colonic machine. The chiropractor teaching
the class required all of his patients scheduled for colonics to take a barium enema
followed by an X-ray of their large intestine prior to having colonics and then make
subsequent X-rays after each series of 12 colonics. Most of his patients experienced
so much immediate relief they voluntarily took at least four complete series, or
48 colonics, before their X-rays began to look normal in terms of structure. It also
took about the same number, 48 colonics, for the patients to notice a significant
improvement in the function of the colon. In reviewing over 10,000 X-rays taken at
his clinic prior to starting colonics, the chiropractor had seen only two normal
colon X-rays and these were from farm boys who grew up eating simple foods from the
garden and doing lots of hard work.
    The X-rays showed that it took a minimum of 12 colon treatments
to bring about a minimal but observable change in the structure of the colon in the
desired direction, and for the patient to begin to notice that bowel function was
improving, plus the fact that they started to feel better. 
 
 A Healthy Colon 
 


    From my point of view the most amazing part of this whole
experience was that the chiropractor did not recommend any dietary changes whatsoever.
His patients were achieving great success from colonics alone. I had thought dietary
changes would be necessary to avoid having the same dismal bowel condition return.
I still think colonics are far more effective if people are on a cleansing diet too.
However, I was delighted to see the potential for helping people through colonics.
    For me, the most interesting part of this colonic school
was that I personally was required to have my own barium enema and X-ray. I was privately
certain that mine would look normal, because after all, I had been on a raw food
diet for six years, and done considerable amount of fasting, all of which was reputed
to repair a civilized colon. Much to my surprise my colon looked just as mangled
and dysfunctional as everyone else&apos;s&apos;, only somewhat worse because it had a loop
in the descending colon similar to a cursive letter&quot;e&quot;which doctors call
a volvulus. Surgeons like to cut volvululii out because they frequently cause bowel
obstructions. It seemed quite unfair. All those other people with lousy looking colons
had been eating the average American diet their whole life, but I had been so &apos;pure!&apos;
    On further reflection I remembered that I had a tendency
toward constipation all through my childhood and young adulthood, and that during
my two pregnancies the pressure of the fetus on an already constipated bowel had
made it worse resulting in the distorted structure seen in the X-ray. This experience
made it very clear that fasting, cleansing diets, and corrected diet would not reverse
damage already done. Proper diet and fasting would however, prevent the condition
of the colon from getting any worse than it already was.
    I then realized that I had just purchased the very tool I
needed to correct my own colon, and I was eager to get home to get started on it.
I had previously thought that I was just going to use this machine for my patients,
because they had been asking for this kind of an adjunct to my services for some
time. I ended up giving myself over a hundred colonics at the rate of three a week
over many months. I then out of curiosity had another barium enema and X-ray to validate
my results. Sure enough the picture showed a colon that looked far more &apos;normal&apos;
with no vulvulus. That little&quot;e&quot;had disappeared.

 What Is Constipation? 
    Most people think they are not constipated because they have
a bowel movement almost every day, accomplished without straining. I have even had
clients tell me that they have a bowel movement once a week, and they are quite certain
that they are not constipated. The most surprising thing to novice fasters is that
repeated enemas or colonics during fasting begins to release many pounds of undeniably
real, old, caked fecal matter and/or huge mucus strings. The first-time faster can
hardly believe these were present. These old fecal deposits do not come out the first
time one has enemas or necessarily the fifth time. And all of them will not be removed
by the tenth enema. But over the course of extended fasting or a long spell of light
raw food eating with repeated daily enemas, amazing changes do begin to occur. It
seems that no one who has eaten a civilized diet has escaped the formation of caked
deposits lining the colon&apos;s walls, interfering with its function. This material does
not respond to laxatives or casually administered enemas.
    Anyone who has not actually seen (and smelled) what comes
out of an&quot;average&quot;apparently healthy person during colonics will really
believe it could happen or can accurately imagine it. Often there are dark black
lumpy strings, lumps, or gravel, evil smelling discs shaped like sculpted hemispheres
similar to the pockets lining the wall of the colon itself. These discs are rock-hard
and may come out looking like long black braids. There may also be long tangled strings
of gray/brown mucous, sheets and flakes of mucous, and worse yet, an occasional worm
(tape worm) or many smaller ones. Once confronted however, it is not hard to imagine
how these fecal rocks and other obnoxious debris interfere with the proper function
of the colon. They make the colon&apos;s wall rigid and interfere with peristalsis thus
leading to further problems with constipation, and interfere with adsorption of nutrients.
    Our modern diet is by its&quot;de-&quot;nature, very constipating.
In the trenches of the First World War, cheese was given the name &apos;chokem ass&apos; because
the soldiers eating this as a part of their daily ration developed severe constipation.
Eaten by itself or with other whole foods, moderate amounts of cheese may not produce
health problems in people who are capable of digesting dairy products. But cheese
when combined with white flour becomes especially constipating. White bread or most
white-flour crackers contain a lot of gluten, a very sticky wheat protein that makes
the bread bind together and raise well. But white flour is lacking the bran, where
most of the fiber is located. And many other processed foods are missing their fiber.
    In an earlier chapter I briefly showed how digestion works
by following food from the mouth to the large intestine. To fully grasp why becoming
constipated is almost a certainty in our civilization a few more details are required.
Food leaving the small intestine is called chyme, a semi-liquid mixture of fiber,
undigested bits, indigestible bits, and the remains of digestive enzymes. Chyme is
propelled through the large intestine by muscular contractions. The large intestine
operates on what I dub the&quot;chew chew train&quot;principle, where the most
recent meal you ate enters the large intestine as the caboose (the last car of a
train) and helps to push out the train engine (the car at the front that toots),
which in a healthy colon should represent the meal eaten perhaps twelve hours earlier.
The muscles in the colon only contract when they are stretched, so it is the volume
of the fecal matter stretching the large intestine that triggers the muscles to push
the waste material along toward the rectum and anus.
    Eating food lacking fiber greatly reduces the volume of the
chyme and slows peristalsis. But moving through fast or slow, the colon still keeps
on doing another of its jobs, which is to transfer the water in the chime back into
the bloodstream, reducing dehydration. So the longer chime remains in the colon,
the dryer and harder and stickier it gets. That&apos;s why once arrived at the&quot;end
of the tracks&quot;fecal matter should be evacuated in a timely manner before it
gets to dry and too hard to be moved easily. Some constipated people do have a bowel
movement every day but are evacuating the meal eaten many days or even a week previously.
    Most hygienists believe that when the colon becomes lined
with hardened fecal matter it is permanently and by the very definition of the word
itself, constipated. This type of constipation is not perceived as an uncomfortable
or overly full feeling or a desire to have a bowel movement that won&apos;t pass. But
it has insidious effects. Usually constipation delays transit time, increasing the
adsorption of toxins generated from misdigestion of food; by coating and locking
up significant portions of colon it also reduces the adsorption of certain minerals
and electrolytes.
    Sometimes, extremely constipated people have almost constant
runny bowels because the colon has become so thickly and impenetrably lined with
old fecal matter that it no longer removes much moisture. This condition is often
misinterpreted as diarrhea. The large intestine&apos;s most important task is to transfer
water-soluble minerals from digested food to the blood. When a significant part of
the colon&apos;s surface becomes coated with impermeable dried rigid fecal matter or mucus
it can no longer assimilate effectively and the body begins to experience partial
mineral starvation in the presence of plenty. It is my observation from dozens of
cases that when the colon has been effectively cleansed the person has a tendency
to gain weight while eating amounts of food that before only maintained body weight,
while people who could not gain weight or who were wasting away despite eating heavily
begin to gain. And problems like soft fingernails, bone loss around teeth or porous
bones tend to improve.

 The Development Of My Own Constipation 
    The history of my own constipation, though it especially
relates to a very rustic childhood, is typical of many people. I was also raised
on a very constipating diet which consisted largely of processed cheese and crackers.
Mine was accelerated by shyness, amplified by lack of comfortable facilities.
    I spent my early years on the Canadian prairies, where everybody
had an outhouse. The fancy modern versions are frequently seen on construction sites.
These are chemical toilets, quiet different than the ones I was raised with because
somebody or something mysteriously comes along, empties them and installs toilet
paper. The ones I&apos;m familiar with quickly developed a bad-smelling steaming mound
in the center--or it was winter when the outhouse was so cold that everything froze
almost before it hit the ground in the hole below. (And my rear end seemed to almost
freeze to the seat!) The toilet paper was usually an out of season issue of Eatons
mail order catalogue with crisp glossy paper. Perhaps it is a peculiarity of the
north country, but at night there are always monsters lurking along the path to the
outhouse, and darkness comes early and stays late.
    When nature called and it was daylight, and there was no
blizzard outside, the outhouse received a visit from me. If on the other hand, when
it was dark (we had no electricity), and there was a cold wind creating huge banks
of snow, I would &apos;just skip it,&apos; because the alternative--an indoor chamber pot,
white enamel with a lid--was worse. This potty had to be used more or less publicly
because the bedrooms were shared and there was no indoor bathroom. I was always very
modest about my private parts and private functions, and potty&apos;s were only used in
emergencies, and usually with considerable embarrassment. No one ever explained to
me that it was not good for me to retain fecal matter, and I never thought about
it unless my movements became so hard that it was painful to eliminate.
    Later in life, I continued this pattern of putting off bowel
movements, even though outhouses and potties were a thing of the past. As a young
adult I could always think of something more interesting to do than sitting on a
pot, besides it was messy and sometimes accompanied by embarrassing sound effects
which were definitely not romantic if I was in the company of a young man. During
two pregnancies the tendency to constipation was aggravated by the weight of the
fetus resting on an already sluggish bowel, and the discomfort of straining to pass
my first hard bowel movement after childbirth with a torn perineum I won&apos;t forget.

 Rapid Relief From Colon Cleansing 
    During fasting the liver is hard at work processing toxins
released from fat and other body deposits. The liver still dumps its wastes into
the intestines through the bile duct. While eating normally, bile, which contains
highly toxic substances, is passed through the intestines and is eliminated before
too much is reabsorbed. (It is the bile that usually makes the fecal matter so dark
in color.) However, reduction of food bulk reduces or completely eliminates peristalsis,
thus allowing intestinal contents to sit for extended periods. And the toxins in
the bile are readsorbed, forming a continuous loop, further burdening the liver.
    The mucus membranes lining the colon constantly secrete lubricants
to ease fecal matter through smoothly. This secretion does not stop during fasting;
in fact, it may increase because intestinal mucus often becomes a secondary route
of elimination. Allowed to remain in the bowel, toxic mucus is an irritant while
the toxins in it may be reabsorbed, forming yet another closed loop and further burdening
the liver.
    Daily enemas or colonics administered during fasting or while
on cleansing diets effectively remove old fecal material stored in the colon and
immediately ease the livers load, immediately relieve discomfort by allowing the
liver&apos;s efforts to further detoxify the blood, and speed healing. Fasters cleansing
on juice or raw food should administer two or three enemas in short succession every
day for the first three days to get a good start on the cleansing process, and then
every other day or at very minimum, every few days. Enemas or colonics should also
be taken whenever symptoms become uncomfortable, regardless of whether you have already
cleaned the colon that day or not. Once the faster has experienced the relief from
symptoms that usually comes from an enema they become more than willing to repeat
this mildly unpleasant experience.
    Occasionally enemas, by filling the colon and making it press
on the liver, induce discharges of highly toxic bile that may cause temporary nausea.
Despite the induced nausea it is still far better to continue with colonics because
of the great relief experienced after the treatment. If nausea exists or persists
during colon cleansing, consider trying slight modifications such as less or no massage
of the colon in the area of the gall bladder (abdominal area close to the bottom
of the right rib cage), and putting slightly less water in the colon when filling
it up. It also helps to make sure that the stomach is empty of any fluid for one
hour prior to the colonic. Resume drinking after the colonic sessions is completed.
If you are one of these rare people who &apos;toss their bile&apos;, just keep a plastic bucket
handy and some water to rinse out the mouth after, and carry on as usual.

 Enemas Versus Colonics 
    People frequently wonder what is the difference between a
colonic and an enema.
    First of all enemas are a lot cheaper because you give them
to yourself; an enema bag usually costs about ten dollars, is available at any large
drug store, and is indefinitely reusable. Colonics cost anywhere from 30 to 75 dollars
a session.
    Chiropractors and naturopaths who offer this service hire
a colonic technician that may or may not be a skilled operator. It is a good idea
to find a person who has a very agreeable and professional manner, who can make you
feel at ease since relaxation is very important. It is also beneficial to have a
colonic therapist who massages the abdomen and foot reflexes appropriately during
the session.
    Enemas and colonics can accomplish exactly the same beneficial
work. But colonics accomplish more improvement in less time than enemas for several
reasons. During a colonic from 30 to 50 gallons of water are flushed through the
large intestines, usually in a repetitive series of fill-ups followed by flushing
with a continuous flow of water. This efficiency cannot even be approached with an
enema. But by repeating the enema three times in close succession a satisfactory
cleanse can be achieved. Persisted with long enough, enemas will clean the colon
every bit as well as a colonic machine can.
    Enemas given at home take a lot less time than traveling
to receive a colonics at someone&apos;s clinic, and can be done entirely at you own convenience--a
great advantage when fasting because you can save your energy for internal healing.
But colonics are more appropriate for some. There are fasters who are unable to give
themselves an enema either because their arms are too short and their body is too
long and they lack flexibility, or because of a physical handicap or they can&apos;t confront
their colon, so they let someone else do it. Some don&apos;t have the motivation to give
themselves a little discomfort but are comfortable with someone else doing it to
them. Some very sick people are too weak to cleanse their own colon, so they should
find someone to assist them with an at-home enema or have someone take them to a
colonic therapist.
    Few people these days have any idea how to properly give
themselves an enema. The practice has been discredited by traditional medical doctors
as slightly dangerous, perhaps addictive and a sign of psychological weirdness. Yet
Northamericans on their civilized, low fiber, poorly combined diets suffer widely
from constipation. One proof of this is the fact that chemical laxatives, with their
own set of dangers and liabilities, occupy many feet of drug store shelf space and
are widely advertised. Is the medical profession&apos;s disapproval of the enema related
to the fact that once the initial purchase of an enema bag has been made there are
no further expenses for laxatives? Or perhaps it might be that once a person discovers
they can cure a headache, stop a cold dead in its tracks with an enema, they aren&apos;t
visiting the M.D.s so often.
    The enema has also been wrongly accused of causing a gradual
loss of colon muscle tone, eventually preventing bowel movements without the stimulation
of an enema, leading finally to flaccidity and enlargement of the lower bowel. This
actually can happen; when it does occur it is the result of frequent administration
of small amounts of water (fleet enemas) for the purpose of stimulating a normal
bowel movement. The result is constant stretching of the rectum without sufficient
fluid to enter the descending colon. A completely opposite, highly positive effect
comes from properly administered enemas while cleansing.
    The difference between helpful and potentially harmful enemas
lies in the amount of water injected and the frequency of use. Using a cup or two
of water to induce a bowel movement may eventually cause dependency, will not strengthen
the colon and may after years of this practice, result in distention and enlargement
of the rectum or sigmoid colon. However, a completely empty average-sized colon has
the capacity of about a gallon of water. When increasingly larger enemas are administered
until the colon is nearly emptied of fecal matter and the injection of close to a
gallon of water is achieved, beneficial exercise and an increase in overall muscle
tone are the results.
    Correctly given, enemas (and especially colonics) serve as
strengthening exercises for the colon. This long tubular muscle is repeatedly and
completely filled with water, inducing it to vigorously exercise while evacuating
itself multiple times. The result is a great increase in muscle tone, acceleration
of peristalsis and eventually, after several dozens of repetitions, a considerable
reduction of transit time. Well-done enemas work the colon somewhat less effectively
and do not improve muscle tone quite as much as colonics.
    Injecting an entire gallon of water with an enema bag is
very impractical when a person is eating normally. But on a light cleansing diet
or while fasting the amount of new material passing into the colon is small or negligible.
During the first few days of fasting if two or three enemas are administered each
day in immediate succession the colon is soon completely emptied of recently eaten
food and it becomes progressively easier to introduce larger amounts of water. Within
a few days of this regimen, injecting half a gallon or more of water is easy and
painless.
    Probably for psychological reasons, some peoples&apos; colons
allow water to be injected one time but then&quot;freeze up&quot;and resist successive
enemas. For this reason better results are often obtained by having one enema, waiting
a half hour, another enema, wait a half hour, and have a final enema.
    A colonic machine in the hands of an expert operator can
administer the equivalent of six or seven big enemas in less than one hour, and do
this without undue discomfort or effort from the person receiving the colonic. However,
the AMA has suppressed the use of colonics; they are illegal to administer in many
states. Where colonics are legal, the chiropractors now consider this practice messy
and not very profitable compared to manipulations. So it is not easy to find a skilled
and willing colonic technician.
    Anyone who plans to give themselves therapeutic enemas while
fasting would be well advised to first seek out a colonic therapist and receive two
or three colonics delivered one day apart while eating lightly and then immediately
begin the fast. Three colonics given on three successive days of a light, raw food
diet are sufficient to empty all recently eaten food even from a very constipated,
distended and bloated colon, while acquainting a person with their own bowel. Having
an empty colon is actually a pleasant and to most people a thoroughly novel experience.
A few well-delivered colonics can quickly accustom a person to the sensations accompanying
the enema and demonstrate the effect to be achieved by oneself with an enema bag,
something not quickly discoverable any other way.

 How To Give Yourself An Enema 
    Enemas have been medically out of favor for a long time.
Most people have never had one. So here are simple directions to self-administer
an effective enema series.
    The enema bag you select is important. It must hold at least
two quarts and be rapidly refillable. The best American-made brand is made of rubber
with about five feet of rubber hose ending in one of two different white hard plastic
insertion tips. The bag is designed for either enemas or vaginal douches. It hangs
from a detachable plastic&quot;S&quot;hook. When filled to the brim it holds exactly
one-half gallon. The maker of this bag offers another model that costs about a dollar
more and also functions as a hot water bottle. A good comforter it may make, but
the dual purpose construction makes the bag very awkward to rapidly refill. I recommend
the inexpensive model.
    The plastic insertion tips vary somewhat. The straight tubular
tip is intended for enemas; the flared vaginal douche tip can be useful for enemas
too, in that it somewhat restrains unintentional expulsion of the nozzle while filling
the colon. However, its four small holes do not allow a very rapid rate of flow.
    To give yourself an enema, completely fill the bag with tepid
water that does not exceed body temperature. The rectum is surprisingly sensitive
to heat and you will flinch at temperatures only a degree or two higher than 98 Fahrenheit.
Cooler water is no problem; some find the cold stimulating and invigorating. Fasters
having difficulty staying warm should be wary of cold water enemas. These can drop
core body temperature below the point of comfort.
    Make sure the flow clamp on the tube is tightly shut and
located a few inches up the tube from the nozzle. Hang the filled bag from a clothes
or towel hook, shower nozzle, curtain rod, or other convenient spot about four to
five feet above the bathroom floor or tub bottom. The higher the bag the greater
the water pressure and speed of filling. But too much pressure can also be uncomfortable.
You may have to experiment a bit with this.
    Various body positions are possible for filling the colon.
None is correct or necessarily more effective than another. Experiment and find the
one you prefer. Some fill their colon kneeling and bending forward in the bathtub
or shower because there will likely be small dribbles of water leaking from around
the nozzle. Usually these leaks do not contain fecal matter. Others prefer to use
the bathroom floor. For the bony, a little padding in the form of a folded towel
under knees and elbows may make the process more comfortable. You may kneel and bend
over while placing your elbows or hands on the floor, reach behind yourself and insert
the nozzle. You may also lie on your back or on your side. Some think the left side
is preferable because the colon attaches to the rectum on the left side of the body,
ascends up the left side of the abdomen to a line almost as high as the solar plexus,
then transverses the body to the right side where it descends again on the right
almost to the groin. The small intestine attaches to the colon near its lower-right
extremity. In fact these are the correct names given for the parts of the colon:
Ascending, Descending and Transverse Colon along with the Sigmoid Colon or Rectum
at the exit end.
    As you become more expert at filling your colon with water
you will begin to become aware of its location by the weight, pressure and sometimes
temperature of the water you&apos;re injecting. You will come to know how much of the
colon has been filled by feel. You will also become aware of peristalsis as the water
is evacuated vigorously and discover that sensations from a colon hard at work, though
a bit uncomfortable, are not necessarily pain.
    Insertion of the nozzle is sometimes eased with a little
lubricant. A bit of soap or KY jelly is commonly used. If the nozzle can be inserted
without lubricant it will have less tendency to slip out. However, do not tear or
damage the anus by avoiding necessary lubrication. After insertion, grip the clamp
with one hand and open it. The flow rate can be controlled with this clamp. Keeping
a hand on the clamp also prevents the nozzle from being expelled.
    Water will begin flowing into the colon. Your goal is to
empty the entire bag into the colon before sensations of pressure or urgency to evacuate
the water force you to remove the nozzle and head for the toilet. Relaxation of mind
and body helps achieve this. You are very unlikely to achieve a half-gallon fill
up on the first attempt. If painful pressure is experienced try closing the clamp
for a moment to allow the water to begin working its way around the obstacle. Or,
next time try hanging the bag lower, reducing its height above the body and thus
lowering the water pressure. Or, try opening the clamp only partially. Or, try panting
hard, so as to make the abdomen move rapidly in and out, sort of shaking the colon.
This last technique is particularly good to get the water past a blockage of intestinal
gas.
    It is especially important for Americans, whose culture does
not teach one to be tolerant of discomfort, to keep in mind that pain is the body&apos;s
warning that actual damage is being done to tissues. Enemas can do no damage and
pose no risk except to that rare individual with weak spots in the colon&apos;s wall from
cancers. When an enema is momentarily perceived unpleasantly, the correct name for
the experience is a sensation, not pain. You may have to work at increasing your
tolerance for unpleasant sensations or it will take you a long time to achieve the
goal of totally filling the colon with water. Be brave! And relax. A wise philosopher
once said that it is a rough Universe in which only the tigers survive--and sometimes
they have a hard time.
    Eventually it will be time to remove the nozzle and evacuate
the water. Either a blockage (usually fecal matter, an air bubble, or a tight &apos;U&apos;
turn in the colon, usually at either the splenetic, or hepatic flexures located right
below the rib cage) will prevent further inflow (undesirable) or else the bag will
completely empty (good!) or the sensation of bursting will no longer be tolerable.
Go sit on the toilet and wait until all the water has passed. Then refill the bag
and repeat the process. Each time you fill the colon it will allow more water to
enter more easily with less unpleasantness. Fasters and cleansers should make at
least three attempts at a complete fill-up each time they do an enema session.
    Water and juice fasters will find that after the first few
enemas, it will become very easy to inject the entire half-gallon of water. That
is because there is little or no chime entering the colon. After a few days the entire
colon will seem (this is incorrect) to be empty except when it is filled with water.
This is the point to learn an advanced self-administered enema technique. An average
colon empty of new food will usually hold about one gallon of water. That is average.
A small colon might only hold 3/4 gallon, a large one might accept a gallon and a
half, or even more. You&apos;ll need to learn to simultaneously refill the bag while injecting
water, so as to achieve a complete irrigation of the whole colon. There are several
possible methods. You might try placing a pitcher or half-gallon mason jar of tepid
water next to the bag and after the bag has emptied the first time, stand up while
holding the tube in the anus, refill the bag and then lie down again and continue
filling. You might have an assistant do this for you. You might try hanging the bag
from the shower head and direct a slow, continuous dribble of lukewarm water from
the shower into the bag while you kneel or lie relaxed in the tub. This way the bag
will never empty and you stop filling only when you feel fullness and pressure all
the way back to the beginning of the ascending colon. Of course, hanging from a slowly
running shower head the bag will probably overflow and you will get splashed and
so will the bathroom floor when your wet body moves rapidly from the tub to the toilet.
I&apos;ve imagined making an enema bag from a two gallon plastic bucket with a small plastic
hose barb glued into a hole drilled in the bottom or lower edge. If I were in the
business of manufacturing enema bags I&apos;d make them hold at least one gallon.
    A word of caution to those folks who have a pattern of overdoing
it, or tend to think that more is better. This is not true when it comes to colon
cleansing. Do not make more than three attempts to fill and clean the colon with
an enema bag. Usually the colon begins to protest and won&apos;t accept any more fill-ups.
When having colonics on a colonic machine it is a good idea to continue until the
water comes back reasonably clear for that session. It is not a good idea for a faster
to have colonics that last more than three-quarters of an hour to an hour maximum,
or it will be too tiring. Even non-fasters find colonics tiring. After all, the colon
is basically a big muscle that has become very lazy on a low-fiber diet.
    I&apos;ve personally administered over five thousand colonics,
taught several dozen fasters to self-administer their own and stood by while they
gave themselves one until they were quite expert. In all that experience I&apos;ve only
seen one person have a seriously bad result. This was a suicidally depressed water
faster that I (mistakenly) allowed to administer their own colonics with my machine.
This person not only took daily colonics, but allowed water to flow through their
colon for as long as two hours at a time. Perhaps they were trying to wash out their
mind? After several weeks of this extreme excess, the faster became highly confused
and disoriented due to a severe electrolyte imbalance. They had to be taken off water
fasting immediately and recovered their mental clarity in a few days. The loss of
blood electrolytes happened because during colonics there occurs a sort of low-grade
very slow reverse osmosis.

 Curing With Enemas 
    It is not wise to continue regular colonics or enemas once
a detoxification program has been completed and you have returned to a maintenance
diet. The body should be allowed its regular functioning.
    But because enemas immediately lower the toxic load on the
liver, I do recommend people use them for prevention of an acute illness (you feel
like you are coming down with something), and for the treatment of acute illnesses
such as a cold. I also like to take one if I have been away traveling for extended
periods, eating carelessly. But do not fall into a pattern of bingeing on bad food,
and then trying to get rid of it through colonics or laxative. This is bulimia, the
eating disorder discussed earlier.
    The Sheltonite capital&quot;N&quot;Natural capital&quot;H&quot;Hygienists do not recommend any colon cleansing, ever!. They think that the colon
will spontaneously cleanse itself on a long water fast, but my experience learned
from monitoring hundreds of fasters is that it doesn&apos;t really. Herbert Shelton also
considered colon cleansing enervating and therefore undesirable. Colon cleansing
does use the faster&apos;s energy but on the balance, colon cleansing saves more work
on the part of an overburdened liver than it uses up.


 Chapter Five 
 Diet and Nutrition 


 From The Hygienic Dictionary

 Food . [1] Life is a tragedy of nutrition. In food
lies 99.99% of the causes of all diseases and imperfect health of any kind. Prof.
Arnold Ehret, Mucusless Diet Healing System. [2] But elimination will never heal
perfectly just so long as you fail to discontinue the supply of inside waste caused
by eating and&quot;wrong&quot;eating. You may clean and continue to clean indefinitely,
but never with complete results up to a perfect cleanliness, as long as the intake
of wrong or even too much right foods, is not stopped. Prof. Arnold Ehret, Mucusless
Diet Healing System. [3] Cooked food favors bacterial, or organized, ferment
preponderance, because cooking kills the unorganized and organized ferments, and
both are needed to carry on the body&apos;s digestion. Raw foods--fruits and vegetables--favor
unorganized ferment digestion, because these foods carry vitamins, which are unorganized
ferments--enzymes. Dr. John.H. Tilden, Impaired Health: Its Cause and Cure, 1921. 




    Recently, my younger (adult) daughter asked my advice choosing
between a root canal or having a bridge made. This led to a discussion of her eating
habits in general. Defending her currently less-than-optimum diet against my gentle
criticism, she threw me a tough riposte.&quot;Why,&quot;she asked, when I was raised
so perfectly as a child,&quot;when I ate only Organic food until I was ten and old
enough to make you send me to public school where I could eat those lousy school
lunches&quot;(her unfeeling, heartless mother home-schooled her),&quot;why even
at that young age, (before she spent her adolescent rebellion eating junk food) why
at that point did I still have a mouthful of cavities?&quot;And she did. At age
ten my daughter needed about ten fillings.
    This beautiful daughter of a practicing naturopath had received
what, at the time, I considered virtually perfect nutrition. She suckled hugely at
her mother&apos;s abundant breast until age two. During this time her mother ate a natural
foods diet. After weaning my daughter got only whole grains, a little fresh goat&apos;s
milk from my goat, fruits and lots of Organic vegetables. I started my spa when my
daughter was about five years old and from that point she was, like it or not, a
raw fooder. And all that raw food was Organic and much of it from Great Oaks School&apos;s
huge vegetable garden.
    For my daughter to develop cavities on this diet is reminiscent
of Woody Allen&apos;s joke in his movie&quot;Sleeper.&quot;Do you recall this one, made
about 1973? The plot is a take off on Rip Van Winkle. Woody goes into the hospital
for minor surgery. Unexpectedly he expires on the operating table and his body is
frozen in hopes that someday he can be revived. One hundred and fifty years later
he is revived.
    The priceless scene I always think of takes place in his
hospital room immediately after he comes to consciousness. The doctor in charge of
his case is explaining to Woody what has happened. Woody refuses to believe he died
and was frozen, asserting that the whole story is a put on. Woody insists that the
&apos;doctor&apos; is clearly an actor hired by his friends! It absolutely can&apos;t be the year
2123. &apos;Oh, but it really is 2123,&apos; insists the doctor. &apos;And it is no put on by his
friends; all his friends are long dead; Woody knows no one at all in 2123 and had
better prepare himself to start a new life.&apos;
    Woody still insists it is a put on.&quot;I had a healthfood
store,&quot;he says,&quot;and all my friends ate brown rice. They can&apos;t be dead!&quot;
    And my perfectly nourished daughter couldn&apos;t have developed
cavities! But she did. And if she cheated on her perfect diet, bad food could not
have amounted to more than two percent of her total caloric intake from birth to
age ten. I was a responsible mom and I made sure she ate right! Now my daughter was
demanding to know why she had tooth decay. Fortunately, I now know the answer. The
answer is rather complex, but I can give a simplified explanation.

 The Confusions About Diets and Foods 
    Like my daughter, many people of all ages are muddled about
the relationship between health and diet. Their confusions have created a profitable
market for health-related information. And equally, their confusions have been created
by books, magazine articles, and TV news features. This avalanche of data is highly
contradictory. In fact, one reason I found it hard to make myself write my own book
is that I wondered if my book too would become just another part of the confusion.
    Few people are willing to tolerate very much uncertainty.
Rather than live with the discomfort of not knowing why, they will create an explanation
or find some answer, any answer, and then ever after, assert its rightness like a
shipwrecked person clings to a floating spar in a storm. This is how I explain the
genesis of many contemporary food religions.
    Appropriately new agey and spiritual, Macrobiotics teaches
the way to perfect health is to eat like a Japanese whole foods vegetarian--the endless
staple being brown rice, some cooked vegetables and seaweeds, meanwhile balancing
the&quot;yin&quot;and&quot;yang&quot;of the foods. And Macrobiotics works great
for a lot of people. But not all people. Because there&apos;s next to nothing raw in the
Macrobiotic diet and some people are allergic to rice, or can get allergic to rice
on that diet.
    Linda Clark&apos;s Diet for a Small Planet also has hundreds of
thousands of dedicated followers. This system balances the proportions of essential
amino acids at every, single meal and is vegetarian. This diet also works and really
helps some people, but not as well as Macrobiotics in my opinion because obsessed
with protein, Clark&apos;s diet contains too many hard-to-digest soy products and makes
poor food combinations from the point of digestive capacity.
    Then there are the raw fooders. Most of them are raw, Organic
fooders who go so far as to eat only unfired, unground cereals that have been soaked
in warm water (at less than 115 degrees or you&apos;ll kill the enzymes) for many hours
to soften the seeds up and start them sprouting. This diet works and really helps
a lot of people. Raw organic foodism is especially good for&quot;holy joes,&quot;a sort of better-than-everyone-else person who enjoys great self-righteousness by
owning this system. But raw fooding does not help all people nor solve all diseases
because raw food irritates the digestive tracts of some people and in northern climates
it is hard to maintain body heat on this diet because it is difficult to consume
enough concentrated vegetable food in a raw state. And some raw fooders eat far too
much fruit. I&apos;ve seen them lose their teeth because of fruit&apos;s low mineral content,
high sugar level and constant fruit acids in their mouths.
    Then there are vegetarians of various varieties including
vegans (vegetarians that will not eat dairy products and eggs), and then, there are
their exact opposites, Atkins dieters focusing on protein and eating lots of meat.
There&apos;s the Adelle Davis school, people eating whole grains, handfuls of vitamins,
lots of dairy and brewers yeast and wheat germ, and even raw liver. Then there&apos;s
the Organic school. These folks will eat anything in any combination, just so long
as it is organically produced, including organically raised beef, chicken, lamb,
eggs, rabbit, wild meats, milk and diary products, natural sea salt in large quantities
and of course, organically grown fruits, vegetables grains and nuts. And what is&quot;Organic?&quot;The word means food raised in compliance with a set of rules
contrived by a certification bureaucracy. When carefully analyzed, the somewhat illogical
rules are not all that different in spirit than the rules of kashsruth or kosher.
And the Organic certification bureaucrats aren&apos;t all that different than the rabbis
who certify food as being kosher, either.
    There are now millions of frightened Americans who, following
the advice of mainstream Authority, have eliminated red meat from their diets and
greatly reduced what they (mistakenly) understand as high-cholesterol foods.
    All these diets work too--or some--and all demonstrate some
of the truth.
    The only area concerning health that contains more confusion
and contradictory data than diet is vitamins. What a rats nest that is!

 The Fundamental Principle 
    If you are a true believer in any of the above food religions,
I expect that you will find my views unsettling. But what I consider&quot;good diet&quot;results from my clinical work with thousands of cases. It is what has worked with
those cases. My eclectic views incorporate bits and pieces of all the above. In my
own case, I started out by following the Organic school, and I was once a raw food
vegetarian who ate nothing but raw food for six years. I also ate Macrobiotic for
about one year until I became violently allergic to rice.
    I have arrived at a point where I understand that each person&apos;s
biochemistry is unique and each must work out their own diet to suit their life goals,
life style, genetic predisposition and current state of health. There is no single,
one, all-encompassing, correct diet. But, there is a single, basic, underlying Principle
of Nutrition that is universally true. In its most simplified form, the basic equation
of human health goes: Health = Nutrition / Calories. The equation falls far short
of explaining the origin of each individuals diseases or how to cure diseases but
Health = Nutrition / Calories does show the general path toward healthful eating
and proper medicine.
    All animals have the exact same dietary problem: finding
enough nutrition to build and maintain their bodies within the limits of their digestive
capacity. Rarely in nature (except for predatory carnivores) is there any significant
restriction on the number of calories or serious limitation of the amount of low-nutrition
foods available to eat. There&apos;s rarely any shortage of natural junk food on Earth.
Except for domesticated house pets, animals are sensible enough to prefer the most
nutritional fare available and tend to shun empty calories unless they are starving.
    But humans are perverse, not sensible. Deciding on the basis
of artificially-created flavors, preferring incipid textures, we seem to prefer junk
food and become slaves to our food addictions. For example, in tropical countries
there is a widely grown root crop, called in various places: tapioca, tavioca, manioc,
or yuca. This interesting plant produces the greatest tonnage of edible, digestible,
pleasant-tasting calories per acre compared to any other food crop I know. Manioc
might seem the answer to human starvation because it will grow abundantly on tropical
soils so infertile and/or so droughty that no other food crop will succeed there.
Manioc will do this because it needs virtually nothing from the soil to construct
itself with. And consequently, manioc puts next to nothing nourishing into its edible
parts. The bland-tasting root is virtually pure starch, a simple carbohydrate not
much different than pure corn starch. Plants construct starches from carbon dioxide
gas obtained the air and hydrogen obtained from water. There is no shortage ever
of carbon from CO2 in the air and rarely a shortage of hydrogen from water. When
the highly digestible starch in manioc is chewed, digestive enzymes readily convert
it into sugar. Nutritionally there is virtually no difference between eating manioc
and eating white sugar. Both are entirely empty calories.
    If you made a scale from ideal to worst regarding the ratio
of nutrition to calories, white sugar, manioc and most fats are at the extreme undesirable
end. Frankly I don&apos;t know which single food might lie at the extreme positive end
of the scale. Close to perfect might be certain leafy green vegetables that can be
eaten raw. When they are grown on extremely fertile soil, some greens develop 20
or more percent completely digestible balanced protein with ideal ratios of all the
essential amino acids, lots of vitamins, tons of minerals, all sorts of enzymes and
other nutritional elements--and very few calories. You could continually fill your
stomach to bursting with raw leafy greens and still have a hard time sustaining your
body weight if that was all you ate. Maybe Popeye the Sailorman was right about eating
spinach.
    For the moment, lets ignore individual genetic inabilities
to digest specific foods and also ignore the effects stress and enervation can have
on our ability to extract nutrition out of the food we are eating. Without those
factors to consider, it is correct to say that, to the extent one&apos;s diet contains
the maximum potential amount of nutrition relative to the number of calories you
are eating, to that extent a person will be healthy. To the extent the diet is degraded
from that ideal, to that extent, disease will develop. Think about it!

 Lessons From Nutritional Anthropology 
    The next logical pair of questions are: how healthy could
good nutrition make people be, and, how much deviation from ideal nutrition could
we allow ourselves before serious disease appears? Luckily, earlier in this century
we could observe living answers to those questions (before the evidence disappeared).
The answers are: we could be amazingly healthy, and, if we wish to enjoy excellent
health we can afford to cut ourselves surprisingly little slack.
    Prior to the Second World War there were several dozen sizable
groups of extraordinarily healthy humans remaining on Earth. Today, their descendants
are still in the same remote places, are speaking the same languages and possess
more or less the same cultures. Only today they&apos;re watching satellite TV. wearing
jeans, drinking colas--and their superior health has evaporated.
    During the early part of this century, at the same era vitamins
and other basic aspects of nutrition were being discovered, a few farsighted medical
explorers sought out these hard-to-reach places with their legendarily healthy peoples
to see what caused the legendary well-being they&apos;d heard of. Enough evidence was
collected and analyzed to derive some very valid principles.
    First lets dismiss some apparently logical but incorrect
explanations for the unusually good health of these isolated peoples. It wasn&apos;t racial,
genetic superiority. There were extraordinarily healthy blacks, browns, Orientals,
Amerinds, Caucasians. It wasn&apos;t living at high altitude; some lived at sea level.
It wasn&apos;t temperate climates, some lived in the tropics, some in the tropics at sea
level, a type of location generally thought to be quite unhealthful. It wasn&apos;t a
small collection of genetically superior individuals, because when these peoples
left their isolated locale and moved to the city, they rapidly began to lose their
health. And it wasn&apos;t genetics because when a young couple from the isolated healthy
village moved to town, their children born in town were as unhealthy as all the other
kids.
    And what do I mean by genuinely healthy? Well, imagine a
remote village or a mountain valley or a far island settlement very difficult to
get to, where there lived a thousand or perhaps ten thousand people. Rarely fewer,
rarely more. Among that small population there were no medical doctors and no dentists,
no drugs, no vaccinations, no antibiotics. Usually the isolation carried with it
illiteracy and precluded contact with or awareness of modern science, so there was
little or no notion of public hygiene. And this was before the era of antibiotics.
Yet these unprotected, undoctored, unvaccinated peoples did not suffer and die from
bacterial infections; and the women did not have to give birth to 13 children to
get 2.4 to survive to breeding age--almost all the children made it through the gauntlet
of childhood diseases. There was also virtually no degenerative disease like heart
attacks, hardening of the arteries, senility, cancer, arthritis. There were few if
any birth defects. In fact, there probably weren&apos;t any aspirin in the entire place.
Oh, and there was very little mortality during childbirth, as little or less than
we have today with all our hospitals. And the people uniformly had virtually perfect
teeth and kept them all till death, but did not have toothbrushes nor any notion
of dental hygiene. Nor did they have dentists or physicians. (Price, 1970)
    And in those fortunate places the most common causes of death
were accident (trauma) and old age. The typical life span was long into the 70s and
in some places quite a bit longer. One fabled place, Hunza, was renowned for having
an extraordinarily high percentage of vigorous and active people over 100 years old.
    I hope I&apos;ve made you curious.&quot;How could this be?&quot;you&apos;re asking. Well, here&apos;s why. First, everyone of those groups lived in places
so entirely remote, so inaccessible that they were of necessity, virtually self-sufficient.
They hardly traded at all with the outside world, and certainly they did not trade
for bulky, hard-to-transport bulk foodstuffs. Virtually everything they ate was produced
by themselves. If they were an agricultural people, naturally, everything they ate
was natural: organic, whole, unsprayed and fertilized with what ever local materials
seemed to produce enhanced plant growth. And, if they were agricultural, they lived
on a soil body that possessed highly superior natural fertility. If not an agricultural
people they lived by the sea and made a large portion of their diets sea foods. If
their soil had not been extraordinarily fertile, these groups would not have enjoyed
superior health and would have conformed to the currently widely-believed notion
that before the modern era, people&apos;s lives were brutish, unhealthful, and short.
    What is common between meat-eating Eskimos, isolated highland
Swiss living on rye bread, milk and cheese; isolated Scottish island Celts with a
dietary of oat porridge, kale and sea foods; highland central Africans (Malawi) eating
sorghum, millet tropical root crops and all sorts of garden vegetables, plus a little
meat and dairy; Fijians living on small islands in the humid tropics at sea level
eating sea foods and garden vegetables. What they had in common was that their foods
were all were at the extreme positive end of the Health = Nutrition / Calories scale.
The agriculturists were on very fertile soil that grew extraordinarily nutrient-rich
food, the sea food gatherers were obtaining their tucker from the place where all
the fertility that ever was in the soil had washed out of the land had been transported--sea
foods are also extraordinarily nutrient rich.
    The group with the very best soil and consequently, the best
health of all were, by lucky accident, the Hunza. I say&quot;lucky&quot;and&quot;accident&quot;because the Hunza and their resource base unknowingly developed an agricultural system
that produced the most nutritious food that is possible to grow. The Hunza lived
on what has been called super food. There are a lot of interesting books about the
Hunza, some deserving of careful study. (Wrench, 1938; Rodale, 1949)

 Finding Your Ideal Dietary 
    Anyone that is genuinely interested in having the best possible
health should make their own study of the titles listed in the bibliography in the
back of this book. After you do, award yourself a BS nutrition. I draw certain conclusions
from this body of data. I think they help a person sort out the massive confusion
that exists today about proper diet.
    First principle: Homo Sapiens clearly can posses extreme
health while eating very different dietary regimens. There is no one right diet for
humans.
    Before the industrial era almost everyone on Earth ate what
was produced locally. Their dietary choices were pretty much restricted to those
foods that were well adapted and productive in their region. Some places grew rye,
others wheat, others millet, others rice. Some places supported cows, others goats,
others had few on no domesticated animals. Some places produced a lot of fruits and
vegetables. Others, did not. Whatever the local dietary, during thousands of years
of eating that dietary natural selection prevailed; most babies that were allergic
to or not able to thrive on the available dietary, died quickly. Probably of childhood
bacterial infections. The result of this weeding out process was a population closely
adapted to the available dietary of a particular locale.
    This has interesting implications for Americans, most of
whose ancestors immigrated from somewhere else; many of our ancestors also&quot;hybridized&quot;or crossed with immigrants from elsewhere. Trying to discover what dietary substances
your particular genetic endowment is adapted to can be difficult and confusing. If
both your parents were Italian and they were more or less pure Italian going way
back, you might start out trying to eat wheat, olives, garlic, fava beans, grapes,
figs, cow dairy. If pure German, try rye bread, cow dairy, apples, cabbage family
vegetables. If Scottish, try oats, mutton, fish, sheep dairy and cabbage family vegetables.
If Jewish, try goat dairy, wheat, olives and citrus. And certainly all the above
ethnic derivations will thrive on many kinds of vegetables. Afro-Americans, especially
dark-complexioned ones little mixed with Europeans, might do well to avoid wheat
and instead, try sorghum, millet or tropical root crops like sweet potatoes, yams
and taro.
    Making it even more difficult for an individual to discover
their optimum diet is the existence of genetic-based allergies and worse, developed
allergies. Later in this chapter I will explain how a body can develop an allergy
to a food that is probably irreversible. A weakened organ can also prevent digestion
of a food or food group.
    One more thing about adaptation to dietaries. Pre-industrial
humans could only be extraordinarily healthy on the dietary they were adapted to
if and only if that dietary also was extraordinarily high in nutrients. Few places
on earth have naturally rich soil. Food grown on poor soil is poor in nutrition;
that grown on rich soil is high in nutrition. People do not realize that the charts
and tables in the backs of health books like Adelle Davis&apos;s Lets Cook It Right, are
not really true. They are statistics. It is vital to keep in mind the old saying,&quot;there are lies, there are damned lies, and then there are statistics. The best
way to lie is with statistics.&quot;
    Statistical tables of the nutrient content of foods were
developed by averaging numerous samples of food from various soils and regions. These
tables basically lie because they do not show the range of possibility between the
different samples. A chart may state authoritatively that 100 grams of broccoli contains
so many milligrams of calcium. What it does not say is that some broccoli samples
contain only half that amount or even less, while other broccoli contains two or
three times that amount. Since calcium is a vital nutrient hard to come by in digestible
form, the high calcium broccoli is far better food than the low calcium sample. But
both samples of broccoli appear and taste more or less alike. Both could even be
organically grown. Yet one sample has a very positive ratio of nutrition to calories,
the other is lousy food. (Schuphan, 1965) Here&apos;s another example I hope will really
dent the certainties the Linda Clarkites. Potatoes can range in protein from eight
to eleven percent, depending on the soil that produced them and if they were or were
not irrigated. Grown dry (very low yielding) on semiarid soils, potatoes can be a
high-protein staff of life. Heavily irrigated and fertilized so as to produce bulk
yield instead of nutrition, they&apos;ll produce two or three times the tonnage, but at
8 percent protein instead of 11 percent. Not only does the protein content drop just
as much as yield is boosted, the amino acid ratios change markedly, the content of
scarce nutritional minerals drops massively, and the caloric content increases. In
short, subsisting on irrigated commercially-grown potatoes, or on those grown on
relatively infertile soils receiving abundant rainfall will make you fat and sick.
They&apos;re a lot like manioc.
    Here&apos;s another. Wheat can range from 7 to 19 percent protein.
Before the industrial era ruined most wheat by turning it into white flour, wheat-eating
peoples from regions where the cereal naturally contains abundant protein tended
to be tall, healthy and long-lived. Wheat-eating humans from regions that produce
low protein grain tended to be small, sickly and short-lived. (McCarrison, 1921,
1936, 1982; Albrecht, 1975)
    Even cows have to pay attention to where their grass is coming
from. Some green grass is over 15 percent protein and contains lots of calcium, phosphorus
and magnesium to build strong bodies. Other equally or even better looking green
grass contains only six or seven percent protein and contains little calcium, phosphorus
or magnesium. Cows forced to eat only this poor type of grass can literally starve
to death with full bellies. And they have a hard time breeding successfully. The
reason for the difference: different soil fertility profiles. (Albrecht, 1975)
    When people ate local, those living on fertile soils or getting
a significant portion of their diet from the sea and who because of physical isolation
from industrial foods did not make a practice of eating empty calories tended to
live a long time and be very healthy. But those unfortunates on poor soils or with
unwise cultural life-styles tended to be short-lived, diseased, small, weak, have
bad teeth, and etc. The lesson here is that Homo Sapiens can adapt to many different
dietaries, but like any other animal, the one thing we can&apos;t adapt to is a dietary
deficient in nutrition.
    So here&apos;s another&quot;statistic&quot;to reconsider. Most
people believe that due to modern medical wonders, we live longer than we used to.
Actually, that depends. Compared to badly nourished populations of a century ago,
yes! We do. Chemical medicine keeps sickly, poorly nourished people going a lot longer
(though one wonders about the quality of their dreary existences.) I hypothesize
that before the time most farmers purchased and baked with white flour and sold their
whole, unground wheat, many rural Americans (the ones on good soil, not all parts
of North America have rich soil) eating from their own self-sufficient farms, lived
as long or even longer than we do today. You also have to wonder who benefits from
promulgating this mistaken belief about longevity. Who gets rich when we are sick?
And what huge economic interests are getting rich helping make us sick?


 The Human Comedy I know most of my readers have been heavily indoctrinated about food and think they
 already know the truth about dietetics. I also know that so much information (and
 misinformation) is coming out about diet that most of my readers are massively confused
 about the subject. These are two powerful reasons many readers will look with disbelief
 at what this chapter has to say and take no action on my data, even to prove me wrong.
    Let me warn you. There is a deep-seated human tendency to
 put off taking responsibilities, beautifully demonstrated by this old joke.
    A 14 year old boy was discovered masturbating by his father,
 who said,&quot;son, you shouldn&apos;t do that! If you keep it up you&apos;ll eventually go
 blind!&quot;`&quot;But father, came the boy&apos;s quick reply.&quot;It feels good.
 How about if I don&apos;t quit until I need to wear glasses?&quot; 



 The Organic Versus Chemical Feud 
    Now, regrettably, and at great personal risk to my reputation,
I must try to puncture the very favorite belief of food religionists, the doctrine
that organically grown food is as nutritious as food can possibly be, Like Woody
Allen&apos;s brown-rice-eating friends, people think if you eat Organic foods, you will
inevitably live a very long time and be very healthy. Actually, the Organic vs. chemical
feud is in many ways false. Many (not all) samples of organically grown food are
as low or lower in nutrition as foods raised with chemical fertilizers. Conversely,
wisely using chemical fertilizers (not pesticides) can greatly increase the nutritional
value of food. Judiciously used Organic fertilizing substances can also do that as
well or better. And in either case, using chemical fertilizers or so-called organic
fertilizers, to maximize nutrition the humus content of the soil must be maintained.
But, raising soil organic matter levels too high can result in a massive reduction
in the nutritional content of the food being grown--a very frequent mistake on the
part of Organic devotees. In other words, growing nutrition is a science, and is
not a matter of religion.
    The food I fed to my daughter in childhood, though Organic
according to Rodale and the certification bureaucrats, though providing this organic
food to my family and clients gave me a feeling of self-righteousness, was not grown
with an understanding of the nutritional consequences of electing to use one particular
Organic fertilizing substance over another. So we and a lot of regional Organic market
gardeners near us that we bought from, were raising food that was far from ideally
nutritious. At least though, our food was free of pesticide residues.
    The real dichotomy in food is not&quot;chemical&quot;fertilizer
versus&quot;Organic,&quot;It is between industrial food and quality food. What
I mean by industrial food is that which is raised with the intention of maximizing
profit or yield. There is no contradiction between raising food that the&quot;rabbis&quot;running Organic certification bureaucracies would deem perfectly&quot;kosher&quot;and raising that same food to make the most possible money or the biggest harvest.
When a farmer grows for money, they want to produce the largest number of bushels,
crates, tons, bales per acre. Their criteria for success is primarily unit volume.
Many gardeners think the same way. To maximize bulk yield they build soil fertility
in a certain direction (organically or chemically) and choose varieties that produce
greater bulk. However, nature is ironic in this respect. The most nutritious food
is always lower yielding. The very soil management practices that maximize production
simultaneously reduce nutrition.
    The real problem we are having about our health is not that
there are residues of pesticides in our food. The real problem is that there are
only residues of nutrition left in our foods. Until our culture comes to understand
this and realizes that the health costs of accepting less than optimum food far exceeds
the profits made by growing bulk, it will not be possible to frequently find the
ultimate of food quality in the marketplace, organically grown or not. It will not
be possible to find food that is labeled or identified according to its real nutritional
value. The best I can say about Organic food these days is that it probably is no
less nutritious than chemically-grown food while at least it is free of pesticide
residues.

 The Poor Start 
    For this reason it makes sense to take vitamins and food
supplements, to be discussed in the next chapter. And because our food supply, Organic
or&quot;conventional,&quot;is far from optimum, if a person wants to be and remain
healthy and have a life span that approaches their genetic potential (and that potential,
it seems, approaches or exceeds a century), it is essential that empty calories are
rigorously avoided.
    An accurate and quick-to-respond indicator of how well we
are doing in terms of getting enough nutrition is the state of our teeth. One famous
dentally-oriented nutritional doctor, Melvin Page, suggested that as long as overall
nutrition was at least 75 percent of perfection, the body chemistry could support
healthy teeth and gums until death. By healthy here Page means free of cavities,
no bone loss around the teeth (no wobblers), no long-in-the-teeth mouths from receding
gums, no gum diseases at all. But when empty calories or devitalized foods or misdigestion
cuts our nutrient intake we begin experiencing tooth decay, gum disease and bone
loss in the jaw. How are your teeth?
    I suppose you could say that I have a food religion, but
mine is to eat so that the equation Nutrition = Health / Calories is strongly in
my favor.
    Back to my daughter&apos;s teeth. Yes, I innocently fed her less
than ideally nutritious food, but at that time I couldn&apos;t buy ideal food even had
I known what I wanted, nor did I have any scientific idea of how to produce ideal
food, nor actually, could I have done so on the impoverished, leached-out clay soil
at Great Oaks School even had I known how. The Organic doctrine says that you can
build a Garden of &apos;Eatin with large quantities of compost until any old clay pit
or gravel heap produces highly nutritious food. This idea is not really true. Sadly,
what is true about organic matter in soil is that when it is increased very much
above the natural level one finds in untilled soil in the climate you&apos;re working
with, the nutritional content of the food begins to drop markedly. I know this assertion
is shocking and perhaps threatening to those who believe in the Organic system; I
am sorry.
    But there is another reason my daughter&apos;s teeth were not
perfect, probably could not have been perfect no matter what we fed her, and why
she will probably have at least some health problems as she ages no matter how perfectly
she may choose to eat from here on. My daughters had what Dr. G.T. Wrench called&quot;a poor start.&quot;Not as poor as it could have been by any means, but certainly
less than ideal.
    You see, the father has very little to do with the health
of the child, unless he happens to carry some particularly undesirable gene. It is
the mother who has the job of constructing the fetus out of prepartum nourishment
and her own body&apos;s nutritional reserves. The female body knows from trillenia of
instinctual experience that adequate nutrition from the current food supply during
pregnancy can not always be assured, so the female body stores up very large quantities
of minerals and vitamins and enzymes against that very possibility. When forming
a fetus these reserves are drawn down and depleted. It is virtually impossible during
the pregnancy itself for a mother to extract sufficient nutrition from current food
to build a totally healthy fetus, no matter how nourishing the food she is eating
may be. Thus a mother-to-be needs to be spending her entire childhood and her adolescence
(and have adequate time between babies), building and rebuilding her reserves.
    A mother-to-be also started out at her own birth with a vitally
important stock of nutritional reserves, reserves put there during her own fetal
development. If that&quot;start&quot;was less than ideal, the mother-to-be (as
fetus) got&quot;pinched&quot;and nutritionally shortchanged in certain, predictable
ways. Even minor mineral fetal deficiencies degrade the bone structure: the fetus
knows it needs nutritional reserves more than it needs to have a full-sized jaw bone
or a wide pelvic girdle, and when deprived of maximum fetal nourishment, these non-vital
bones become somewhat smaller. Permanently. If mineral deficiencies continue into
infancy and childhood, these same bones continue to be shortchanged, and the child
ends up with a very narrow face, a jaw bone far too small to hold all the teeth,
and in women, a small oven that may have trouble baking babies. More importantly,
those nutrient reserves earmarked especially for making babies are also deficient.
So a deficient mother not only shows certain structural evidence of physiological
degeneration, but she makes deficient babies. A deficient female baby at birth is
unlikely to completely overcome her bad start before she herself has children.
    So with females, the quality of a whole lifetime&apos;s nutrition,
and the life-nutrition of her mother (and of her mother&apos;s mother as well) has a great
deal to do with the outcome of a pregnancy. The sins of the mother can really be
visited unto the third and fourth generation.
    This reality was powerfully demonstrated in the 1920s by
a medical doctor, Francis Pottenger. He was not gifted with a good bedside manner.
Rather than struggling with an unsuccessful clinical practice, Dr. Pottenger decided
to make his living running a medical testing laboratory in Pasadena, California.
Dr. Pottenger earned his daily bread performing a rather simple task, assaying the
potency of adrenal hormone extracts. At that time, adrenaline, a useful drug to temporarily
rescue people close to death, was extracted from the adrenal glands of animals. However,
the potency of these crude extracts varied greatly. Being a very powerful drug, it
was essential to measure exactly how strong your extract was so its dosage could
be controlled.
    Quantitative organic chemistry was rather crude in those
days. Instead of assaying in a test tube, Dr. Pottenger kept several big cages full
of cats that he had adrenalectomized. Without their own adrenals, the cats could
not live more than a short time By finding out how much extract was required to keep
the cats from failing, he could measure the strength of the particular batch.
    Dr. Pottenger&apos;s cats were economically valuable so he made
every effort to keep them healthy, something that proved to be disappointingly difficult.
He kept his cats clean, in airy, bright quarters, fed them to the very best of his
ability on pasteurized whole milk, slaughterhouse meat and organs (cats in the wild
eat organ meats first and there are valuable vitamins and other substances in organ
meats that don&apos;t exist in muscle tissue). The meat was carefully cooked to eliminate
any parasites, and the diet was supplemented with cod liver oil. However, try as
he might, Pottenger&apos;s cats were sickly, lived short and had to be frequently replaced.
Usually they bred poorly and died young of bacterial infections, there being no antibiotics
in the 1920s. I imagine Dr. Pottenger was constantly visiting the animal shelter
and perhaps even paid quarters out the back door to a steady stream of young boys
who brought him cats in burlap sacks from who knows where, no questions asked.
    Dr. Pottenger&apos;s assays must have been accurate, for his business
grew and grew. Eventually he needed more cats than he had cages to house, so he built
a big, roofed, on-the-ground pen outdoors. Because he was overworked, he was less
careful about the feeding of these extra animals. They got the same pasteurized milk
and cod-liver oil, but he did not bother to cook their slaughterhouse meat. Then,
a small miracle happened. This poorly cared for cage of cats fed on uncooked meat
became much healthier than the others, suffering far fewer bacterial infections or
other health problems. Then another miracle happened. Dr. Pottenger began to meditate
on the first miracle.
    It occurred to him that cats in the wild did not cook their
food; perhaps cats had a digestive system that couldn&apos;t process or assimilate much
out of cooked food. Perhaps the problem he had been having was not because the cats
were without adrenal glands but because they were without sustenance, suffering a
sort of slow starvation in the midst of plenty. So Dr. Pottenger set up some cat
feeding experiments.
    There were four possible combinations of his regimen: raw
meat and unpasteurized milk; raw meat and pasteurized milk; cooked meat and raw milk;
cooked meat and pasteurized milk, this last one being what he had been feeding all
along. So he divided his cats into four groups and fed each group differently. The
first results of Pottenger&apos;s experiments were revealed quickly though the most valuable
results took longer to see. The cats on raw meat and raw milk did best. The ones
on raw meat and pasteurized milk did okay but not as well. The ones on cooked meat
and raw milk did even less well and those on all cooked food continued to do as poorly
as ever.
    Clearly, cats can&apos;t digest cooked food; all animals do better
fed on what they can digest. A lot of people have taken Pottenger&apos;s data and mistakenly
concluded that humans also should eat only raw food. This idea is debatable. However,
the most important result of the cat experiments took years to reveal itself and
is not paid much attention to, probably because its implications are very depressing.
Dr. Pottenger continued his experiments for several generations. It was the transgenerational
changes that showed the most valuable lesson. Over several generations, the cats
on all raw foods began to alter their appearance. Their faces got wider, their pelvic
girdles broader, bones solider, teeth better. They began to breed very successfully.
    After quite a few generations, the healthiest group, the
one on all raw foods, seemed to have improved as much as it could. So Dr. Pottenger
took some of these cats and began feeding them only cooked food to study the process
of nutritional degeneration. After three&quot;de&quot;generations on cooked fodder
the group had deteriorated so much that the animals could barely breed. Their faces
had become narrow, their teeth crooked, their pelvic girdles narrow, their bones
and body structure very small, and their dispositions poor. Mothers wouldn&apos;t nurse
their young and sometimes became cannibalistic. They no longer lived very long.
    Before the degenerating group completely lost the ability
to breed, Pottenger began to again feed them all raw food. It took four generations
on a perfect, raw food diet before some perfect appearing individuals showed up in
the group. It takes longer to repair the damage than it does to cause it and it takes
generations of unflagging persistence.
    I think much the same process has happened to humans in this
century. With the invention of the roller mill and the consequent degradation of
our daily bread to white flour; with the birth of industrial farming and the generalized
lowering of the nutritional content of all of our crops; our overall ratio of nutrition
to calories worsened. Then it worsened again because we began to have industrial
food manufacturing and national brand prepared food marketing systems; we began subsisting
on devitalized, processed foods. The result has been an even greater worsening of
our ratio of nutrition to calories.
    And just like Pottenger&apos;s cats, we civilized humans in so-called
advanced countries are losing the ability to breed, our willingness (or the energy)
to mother our young; we&apos;re losing our good humor in the same way Pottenger&apos;s degenerated
cats became bad tempered. As a group we feel so poorly that we desperately need to
feel better fast, and what better way to do that than with drugs. Is it any wonder
that the United States, the country furthest down the road of industrial food degeneration,
spends 14 percent of its gross domestic product on medical services. Any wonder that
so many babies are born by Cesarean, any wonder that so many of our children have
crooked teeth needing an orthodontist? The most depressing aspect of this comes into
view when considering that Pottenger&apos;s cats took four generations on perfect food
to repair most of the nutritional damage.
    In the specific case of my daughter, I know somethings about
the nutritional history of her maternal ancestors. My daughter&apos;s grandmother grew
up on a Saskatchewan farm. Though they certainly grew their own rich wheat on virgin
semi-arid prairie soil, I&apos;m sure the family bought white flour at the store for daily
use. Still, there was a garden and a cow producing raw milk and free-range fertile
eggs and chicken and other animals. There probably were lots of canned vegetables
in winter, canned but still highly nutritious because of the fertility of their prairie
garden. My mother consequently had perfect teeth until the Great Depression forced
her to live for too many years on lard and white bread.
    During this time of severe malnutrition she had her three
babies. The first one got the best of her nutritional reserves. The second, born
after the worst of the malnutrition, was very small and weak and had a hard time
growing up. Fortunately for me, for a few years before I (the last child) was born,
the worst of the economic times had past and the family had been living on a farm.
There were vegetables and fresh raw milk and fruit. My mother had two good years
to rebuild her nutritional reserves. But&quot;Grannybell&quot;did not managed to
replace enough. Shortly after I was born my mother lost every one of her teeth all
at once. The bone just disappeared around them.
    Thus, I was born deficient. And my childhood and adolescent
nutrition was poor too: soda crackers, pasteurized processed artificial cheese, evaporated
milk from cans, hotdogs and canned beans, hotdogs and cabbage. It wasn&apos;t until I
was pregnant with my first baby that I started to straighten up my diet. I continued
eating very well after my first daughter, so my youngest daughter had another three
years of good diet to draw on. Thus both my own daughters got a somewhat better start
than I had had.
    My teeth were not as good as my mother&apos;s had been before
those years of malnutrition took them all. Instead of perfect straight undecayed
teeth like a healthy farm girl should have, mine were somewhat crowded, with numerous
cavities. My jaw bone had not received enough minerals to develop to its full size.
My pelvic girdle also was smaller than my mother&apos;s was. I had had a poor start.
    My daughters did better. The older one (the first child typically
gets the best of the nutritional reserves) has such a wide jaw that there are small
spaces between her teeth. My second daughter has only one crooked tooth, she has
wider, more solid hips, stronger bones and a broader face than I do. If my younger
daughter will but from this point in her life, eat perfectly and choose her food
wisely to responsibly avoid empty calories and maximize her ratio of nutrition to
calories, her daughter (if she gives us granddaughters as her older sister already
has done) may exhibit the perfect physiology that her genes carry.
    Along the lines of helping you avoid empty calories I will
give you some information about various common foods that most people don&apos;t know
and that most books about food and health don&apos;t tell, or misunderstand.

 Butter, Margarine and Fats in General. 
    Recently, enormous propaganda has been generated against
eating butter. Its been smeared in the health magazines as a saturated animal fat,
one containing that evil substance, cholesterol. Many people are now avoiding it
and instead, using margarine.


 Composition of Oils   Saturated Monosaturated Unsaturated Butter 66% 30% 4% Coconut Oil 87% 6% 2% Cottonseed Oil 26% 18% 52% Olive Oil 13% 74% 8% Palm Oil 49% 37% 9% Soybean Oil 14% 24% 58% Sunflower Oil 4% 8% 83% Safflower Oil 3% 5% 87% Sesame Oil 5% 9% 80% Peanut Oil 6% 12% 76% Corn Oil 3% 7% 84% 



    This is a major and serious misunderstanding. First of all,
margarine is almost indigestible, chemically very much like shortening--an artificially
saturated or hydrogenated vegetable fat. Hydrogenated fats can&apos;t be properly broken
down by the body&apos;s digestive enzymes, adding to the body&apos;s toxic load. Margarine,
being a chemically-treated vegetable oil with artificial yellow color and artificial
flavorings to make it seem like butter, also releases free radicals in the body that
accelerate aging. So, to avoid the dangers of eating cholesterol-containing butter,
people eat something far worse for them!
    There are severe inconsistencies with the entire&quot;cholesterol-is-evil&quot;theory. Ethnic groups like the Danes, who eat enormous quantities of cholesterol-containing
foods, have little circulatory disease. Actually, the liver itself produces cholesterol;
it&apos;s presence in the blood is an important part of the body chemistry. Cholesterol
only becomes a problem because of deranged body chemistry due to the kind of overall
malnutrition Americans usually experience on their junk food diets. Avoiding cholesterol
in foods does little good, but eating a low-fat, low-sugar, complex-carbohydrate
(whole foods) diet high in minerals does lower blood cholesterol enormously.
    Actually, high quality fresh (not rancid) butter in moderate
quantities is about the finest fat a person could eat. But high quality butter is
almost unobtainable. First of all, it has to be raw, made from unpasteurized cream.
Second, butter can contain very high levels of fat-soluble vitamins, but doesn&apos;t
have to. Vitamin-rich butter&apos;s color is naturally bright yellow, almost orange. This
color does not come from a test tube. Pale yellow butter as is found in the commercial
trade was probably almost white before it was artificially tinted. Butter from grass-pastured
cows naturally changes from yellow-orange to white and back again through the year
as the seasons change. Spring grass, growing in the most intense sunlight of the
year contains very high levels of chlorophyll and vitamins. Cows eating this grass
put high levels of vitamins A and D into their cream, evidenced by the orange color
of vitamin A. By July, natural butter has degraded to medium-yellow in color. By
August, it is pale yellow. Industrial dairy cows fed exclusively on hay or artificial,
processed feeds (lacking in these vitamins), produce butterfat that is almost white.
    I prefer to obtain my butter from a neighbor who has several
dairy cows grazing on fertile bottom land pasture. We always freeze a year&apos;s supply
in late spring when butter is at its best. Interestingly, that is also the time of
year when my neighbor gets the most production from her cows and is most willing
to part with 25 pounds of extra butter.
    In general, fats are poor foods that should be avoided. Their
ratio of nutrition to calories is absolutely the worst of all food types, except
perhaps for pure white sugar, which is all calories and absolutely no nutrition (this
is also true for other forms of sugar. Honey, too, contains almost no nutrition.).
Gram for gram, fats contain many more calories than do sugars or starches. Yet gram
for gram, fats contain virtually no nutrition except for small quantities of essential
fatty acids.
    The perverse reason people like to eat fats is that they
are very hard to digest and greatly slow the digestive action of the stomach. Another
way of saying that is that they have a very high satiety value. Fats make a person
feel full for a long time because their presence in the stomach makes it churn and
churn and churn. Fats coat proteins and starches and delay their digestion, often
causing them to begin fermenting (starches) or putrefying (proteins) in the digestive
tract.
    The best fats contain high levels of monosaturated vegetable
oils that have never been exposed to heat or chemicals--like virgin olive oil. Use
small quantities of olive oil for salad dressing. Monosaturated fats also have far
less tendency to go rancid than any other type. Vegetable oils with high proportions
of unsaturated fats, the kind that all the authorities push because they contain
no cholesterol, go rancid rapidly upon very brief exposure to air. The danger here
is that rancidity in vegetable oil is virtually unnoticeable. Rancid animal fat on
the other hand, smells&quot;off.&quot;Eating rancid oil is a sure-fire way to accelerate
aging, invite degenerative conditions in general, and enhance the likelihood of cancer.
I recommend that you use only high-quality virgin olive oil, the only generally-available
fat that is largely monosaturated. (Pearson and Shaw, 1983)
    When you buy vegetable oil, even olive oil, get small bottles
so you use them up before the oil has much time being exposed to air (as you use
the oil air fills the bottle) or, if you buy olive oil in a large can to save money,
immediately upon opening it, transfer the oil to pint jars filled to the very brim
to exclude virtually all air, and seal the jars securely. In either case, keep now-opened,
in-use small bottles of oil in the refrigerator because rancidity is simply the combination
of oil with oxygen from the air and this chemical reaction is accelerated at warmer
temperatures and slowed greatly at cold ones.
    Chemical reactions typically double in speed with every 10
degrees C. increase in temperature. So oil goes rancid about six times faster at
normal room temperature than it does in the fridge. If you&apos;ll think about the implications
of this data you&apos;ll see there are two powerful reasons not to fry food. One, the
food is coated with oil and gains in satiety value at the expense of becoming relatively
indigestible and productive of toxemia. Secondly, if frying occurs at 150 degrees
Centigrade and normal room temperature is 20 degrees Centigrade, then oil goes rancid
2 to the 13th power faster in the frying pan, or about 8,200 times faster. Heating
oil for only ten minutes in a hot skillet induces as much rancidity as about 6 weeks
of sitting open and exposed to air at room temperature. Think about that the next
time you&apos;re tempted to eat something from a fast food restaurant where the hot fat
in the deep fryer has been reacting with oxygen all day, or even for several days.
    Back to butter, where we started. If you must have something
traditionally northern European on your bread, you are far better off to use butter,
not margarine. However, Mediterranean peoples traditionally dip their bread in high-quality
extra-virgin olive oil that smells and tastes like olives. Its delicious, why not
try it. But best yet, put low-sugar fruit preserves on your toast or develop a taste
for dry toast. Probably the finest use for butter is melted over steamed vegetables.
This way only small quantities are needed and the fat goes on something that is otherwise
very easy to digest so its presence will not produce as many toxins in the digestive
tract.

 Milk, Meat, And Other Protein Foods 
    Speaking of butter, how about milk? The dairy lobby is very
powerful in North America. Its political clout and campaign contributions have the
governments of both the United States and especially that of Canada eating out of
its hand (literally), providing the dairy industry with price supports. Because of
these price supports, in Canada cheese costs half again more than it does in the
United States. The dairy lobby is also very cozy with the medical profession so licensed
nutritionists constantly bombard us with&quot;drink milk&quot;and&quot;cheese
is good for you&quot;propaganda.
    And people naturally like dairy foods. They taste good and
are fat-rich with a high satiety value. Dairy makes you feel full for a long time.
Dairy is also high in protein; protein is hard to digest and this too keeps one feeling
full for a long time. But many people, especially those from cultures who traditionally
(genetically) didn&apos;t have dairy cows, particularly Africans, Asians and Jews, just
do not produce the enzymes necessary to digest cows milk. Some individuals belonging
to these groups can digest goats milk. Some can&apos;t digest any kind except human breast
milk. And some can digest fermented milk products like yogurt and kiefer. Whenever
one eats a protein food that is not fully digestible, it putrefies in the digestive
tract, with all the bad consequences previously described.
    But no one, absolutely no one can fully digest pasteurized
cows milk, which is what most people use because they have been made to fear cow-transmitted
diseases and/or they are forced to use pasteurized dairy products by health authorities.
I suspect drinking pasteurized milk or eating cheese made from pasteurized milk is
one of the reasons so many people develop allergic reactions to milk. Yet many states
do not allow unpasteurized dairy to be sold, even privately between neighbors. To
explain all this, I first have to explain a bit more about protein digestion in general
and then talk about allergies and how they can be created.
    Proteins are long, complex molecules, intricate chains whose
individual links are amino acids. Proteins are the very stuff of life. All living
protoplasm, animal or plant, is largely composed of proteins. There are virtually
an infinite number of different proteins but all are composed of the same few dozen
amino acids hooked together in highly variable patterns. Amino acids themselves are
highly complex organic molecules too. The human body custom-assembles all its proteins
from amino acids derived from digesting protein foods, and can also manufacture small
quantities of certain of its own amino acids to order, but there are eight amino
acids it cannot make and these are for that reason called essential amino acids.
Essential amino acids must be contained in the food we eat. .
    Few proteins are water soluble. When we eat proteins the
digestive apparatus must first break them down into their water-soluble components,
amino acids, so these can pass into the blood and then be reassembled into the various
proteins the body uses. The body has an interesting mechanism to digest proteins;
it uses enzymes. An enzyme is like the key for a lock. It is a complex molecule that
latches to a protein molecule and then breaks it apart into amino acids. Then the
enzyme finds yet another protein molecule to free. Enzymes are efficient, reusable
many many times.
    Enzymes that digest proteins are effective only in the very
acid environment of the stomach, are manufactured by the pancreas and are released
when protein foods are present. The stomach then releases hydrochloric acid and churns
away like a washing machine, mixing the enzymes and the acid with the proteins until
everything has digested.
    So far so good. That&apos;s how its supposed to be. But. Dr. Henry
Bieler, who wrote Food Is Your Best Medicine, came up with the finest metaphor I
know of to explain how protein digestion goes wrong. He compared all proteins to
the white of an egg (which is actually a form of protein). When raw and liquid, the
long chains of albumen (egg white) proteins are in their natural form. However, cook
the egg and the egg white both solidifies and becomes smaller. What has happened
is that the protein chains have shriveled and literally tied themselves into knots.
Once this happens, pancreatic enzymes no longer fit and cannot separate all the amino
acids. Cooked proteins may churn and churn and churn in the presence of acid and
pancreatic enzymes but they will not digest completely. Part becomes water soluble;
part does not.
    But, indigestible protein is still subject to an undesirable
form of consumption in the gut. Various bacteria make their home in our airless,
warm intestines. Some of these live on protein. In the process of consuming undigested
proteins, they release highly toxic substances. They poison us.
    What is true of the white of an egg is also true of flesh
foods and dairy. Raw meat and raw fish are actually easily digestible foods and if
not wrongly combined will not produce toxemia in a person that still has a strong
pancreas. However, eating raw meat and fish can be a dicey proposition, both for
reasons of cultural sensibility (people think it is disgusting) and because there
may be living parasites in uncooked flesh that can attack, sicken and even kill people.
It has been argued that a healthy stomach containing its proper degree of acidity
provides an impenetrable barrier to parasites. Perhaps. But how many of us are that
healthy these days? Cooked flesh and fish seems more delicious to our refined, civilized
sensibilities, but are a poor food.
    In my household we have no moral objection to eating meat.
We do have an ethical objection in that meat eating does not contribute to our health.
But still, we do eat it. A few times a year, for traditional celebrations we may
invite the children over and cook a turkey. A few times for Thanksgiving when the
children were going through their holier-than-thou vegetarian stage, I purchased
the largest, thickest porterhouse steak I could find at the natural meat store and
ate it medium-rare, with relish. It was delicious. It made me feel full for hours
and hours and hours. I stayed flat on the couch and groggily worked on digesting
it all evening. After that I&apos;d had enough of meat to last for six months.
    When milk is pasteurized, the proteins in it are also altered
in structure. Not so severely as egg white is altered by cooking because pasteurization
happens at a lower temperature. But altered none the less. And made less digestible.
Pasteurizing also makes milk calcium far less assimilable. That&apos;s ironic because
so many people are drinking milk because they fear they need more calcium to avoid
osteoporosis and to give their children good teeth. What pasteurized milk actually
does to their children is make them calcium deficient and makes the children toxic,
provoking many colds, ear infections, sinusitis, inflammations of the tonsils and
lung infections, and, induces an allergy to milk in the children.

 The Development Of Allergies 
    There are three ways a body can become allergic. (1) It can
have a genetic predisposition for a specific allergy to start with. (2) It can be
repeatedly exposed to an irritating substance such as pollen when, at the same time,
the body&apos;s mechanism for dealing with irritations is weakened. Generally weak adrenals
causes this because the adrenal&apos;s job is to produce hormones that reduce inflammation.
Once the irritating substance succeeds at producing a significant inflammation, a
secondary reaction may be set up, called an allergy. Once established, an allergy
is very hard to get rid of.
    (3) in a way very similar to the second, but instead of being
irritated by an external substance, it is irritated by repeatedly failing to properly,
fully digest something. Pasteurized milk for example, basically impossible to completely
digest even in its low-fat form, often sets up an allergy that applies to other forms
of cows milk, even raw, unpasteurized cows milk or yogurt. Eating too much white
flour can eventually set off a wheat allergy. My husband developed a severe allergy
to barley after drinking too much home-brewed beer; he also became highly intolerant
to alcohol. Now he has allergic reactions to both alcohol and barley. And gets far
sicker from drinking beer (two separate allergies) than from wheat beer, hard liquor
or wine (only one allergy).
    Eating too much of any single food, or repeatedly eating
too much of an otherwise very good food at one time, can eventually overwhelm the
body&apos;s ability to digest it fully. Then, the finest whole food products may set up
an allergic reaction. Worse, this allergic reaction itself subsequently prevents
proper digestion even when only moderate quantities are eaten.
    An allergy may not be recognized as an allergy because it
may not manifest as the instant skin rash or stuffy nose or swollen glands or sticky
eyes. that people usually think of when they think&quot;allergic reaction.&quot;Food allergies can cause many kinds of symptoms, from sinusitis to psychosis, from
asthma to arthritis, from hyperactivity to depression, insomnia to narcolepsy--and
commonly the symptoms don&apos;t manifest immediately after eating. Frequently, allergic
reactions are so low grade as to be unnoticeable and may not produce an observable
condition until many years of their grinding down the vital force has passed. When
the condition finally appears it is hard to associate it with some food that has
been consumed for years, apparently with impunity.
    Thus it is that many North Americans have developed allergies
to wheat, dairy, soy products (because many soy foods are very hard to digest), corn
and eggs. These are such common, widespread, frequently found allergies that anyone
considering a dietary cause of their complaints might just cut all these foods out
of the diet for a few weeks just to see what happens. And individuals may be allergic
to anything from broccoli to bacon, strawberries to bean sprouts. Unraveling food
allergies sometimes requires the deductions of a Sherlock Holmes.
    However, food allergies are very easy to cure if you can
get the suffered to take the medicine. Inevitably, allergic reactions vanish in about
five days of abstinence. Anyone with sufficient self-discipline to water fast for
five days can cure themselves of all food allergies at one step. Then, by a controlled,
gradual reintroduction of foods, they can discover which individual items cause trouble.
See Coca&apos;s Pulse Test in the Appendix where you&apos;ll find step-by-step instructions
for allergy testing that are less rigorous, not requiring a preliminary fast.

 Flour, And Other Matters Relating To Seeds 
    One of the largest degradations to human health was caused
by the roller mill. This apparently profitable machine permitted the miller to efficiently
separate wheat flour into three components: bran, germ and endosperm. Since bread
made without bran and germ is lighter and appears more&quot;upper class&quot;it
became instantly popular. Flour without germ and bran also had an industrial application--it
could be stored virtually forever without being infested by insects because white
flour does not contain enough nutrition to support life. Most health conscious people
are aware that white flour products won&apos;t support healthful human life either.
    Essentially, white flour&apos;s effect on humans is another demonstration
of Health = Nutrition / Calories. When the bran and germ are discarded, remaining
are the calories and much of the protein, lacking are many vitamins and minerals
and other vital nutritional substances.
    Whole wheat bread has been called the staff of life. In ages
past, healthy cultures have made bread the predominant staple in their diet. Does
that mean you can just go to the bakery and buy whole grain bread, or go to the healthfood
store and buy organically grown whole wheat flour, bake your own, and be as healthy
as the ancients? Sorry, the answer is almost certainly no. There are pitfalls, many
of them, waiting for the unwary.
    White flour has one other advantage over whole wheat flour.
It not only remains free of insect infestation, it doesn&apos;t become stale (meaning
rancid). In the wheat germ (where the embryo resides) there is considerable oil,
containing among other things, about the best natural source of vitamin E. This oil
is highly unsaturated and once the seed is ground the oil goes rancid in a matter
of days. Whole wheat flour kept on the unrefrigerated shelf of the store is almost
certainly rancid. A lot of its other vitamin content has been oxidized too. If the
wheat flour had flowed directly from the grinder into an airtight sack and from there
directly to the freezer, if it had been flash frozen and kept extremely cold, it
might have a storage life of some months. Of course that was not the case. Maybe
you&apos;re lucky and your healthfood store is one of the very few that has its own small-scale
flour mill and grinds daily. Probably not.
    How about your baker&apos;s whole wheat bread? Where does the
baker get flour? From the wholesaler&apos;s or distributor&apos;s warehouse! In fifty pound
kraftpaper sacks! How much time had elapsed from milling to wholesaler to baker to
baking? The answer has to be in the order of magnitude of weeks. And it might be
months. Was the flour stored frozen? Or airtight? Of course not.
    If you want bread made from freshly ground flour you are
almost certainly have to grind and bake it yourself. Is it worth the trouble? You
bet. Once you&apos;ve tasted real bread you&apos;ll instantly see by comparison what stale,
rancid whole wheat flour tastes like. Freshly ground flour makes bread that can be
the staff of life and can enormously upgrade your health--if the wheat you use is
any good.
    But before we talk about wheat quality, a more few words
of warning. If you think wheat goes rancid rapidly, rye is even worse. Rye flour
goes bad so fast that when you buy it in the store it usually is the rye equivalent
of white wheat flour. The germ has been removed. The bag may not say so. But it probably
has. If you are going to make rye breads, even more reason to grind your own. Corn
meal from the grocery store has usually been degerminated too. If it hasn&apos;t been,
the oil in the seed&apos;s germ has probably gone rancid.
    Grinding flour at home is easy these days. There is an abundance
of at-home milling products and no shortage of hype about them. You&apos;ll find staunch
advocates of stone mills. These produce the finest-textured flour, but are costly.
The sales pitch is that stones grind at low temperature and do not damage the oils
(remember the development of rancidity is a function of temperature) or the vitamins,
which are also destroyed at high temperature. This assertion is half true. If you
are going to store your flour it is far better to grind it cool. However, if you
are, as we do, going to immediately bake your flour, what difference does it make
if it gets a little warm before baking. That only accelerates the action of the yeast.
    On the negative side, stone mills grind slowly and are very
fussy about which grains they will grind. If the cereal is a bit moist or if the
seed being ground is a little bit oily, the mill becomes instantly blocked.
    Steel burr mills grind fast and coarsely and are inexpensive.
Coarse flour makes heavy bread. The metal grinding faces tend to wear out and have
to be replaced occasionally--if they can be replaced. Breads on the heavy side are
still delicious; for many years I made bread with an inexpensive steel burr mill
attachment that came with my juicer.
    Some steel burr mills will also grind oily seed like sesame
and sunflower. However, oily seeds can be ground far more easily half-a-cup at a
time in a little inexpensive electric spice/coffee mill, the sort with a single fast-spinning
propeller.
    I currently think the best compromise are hammermills. The
grain dribbles into a chamber full of fast-spinning teeth that literally pound the
grain into powder. Since air flows through with the grain the flour is not heated
very much. This type of mill is small, very fast, intermediate in price between steel
mills and stone mill, lasts a long time, but when grinding, sounds like a Boeing
747 about to take off. It is essential to wear hearing protectors when using it.
    Awareness of bread quality is growing. One excellent new
U.S. business, called Great Harvest Bakery is a fast-growing national franchise chain.
They bake and sell only whole grain breads; all their wheat flour is freshly ground
daily on the premises in the back. Unfortunately, as of the writing of this book,
they do not grind their rye flour but bring it in sacks. I can&apos;t recommend their
rye breads. The founder of Great Harvest is a knowledgeable buyer who fully understands
my next topic, which is that wheat is not wheat.
    There are great differences between hard bread wheats; being
organically grown is no cure all for making good or nutritious bread. Great Harvest
understands this and uses top quality grain that is also Organic.
    When I first stated making my own bread from my own at-home-ground
flour I was puzzled by variations in the dough. Sometimes the bread rose well and
was spongy after baking like I wanted it to be. Sometimes it kneaded stickily and
ended up flat and crumbly like a cake. Since I had done everything the same way except
that I may have bought my wheat berries from different healthfood stores, I began
to investigate the subject of wheat quality.
    The element in the cereal that forms the rubbery sponge in
risen bread so it doesn&apos;t crumble and rises high without collapsing, is gluten. The
word glue derives from gluten. The gluten content of various wheats varies. Bread
bakers use&quot;hard wheat&quot;because of its high gluten content. Gluten is a
protein and gluten comprises most of the protein in bread wheat; the protein content
and the gluten content are almost identical.
    Try this. Ask your healthfood store buyer or owner what the
protein content is of the hard red wheat seeds they&apos;re selling. You&apos;ll almost certainly
get a puzzled look and your answer will almost certainly be,&quot;we have Organic
and conventional.&quot;Demand that the store buyer ask this question of their distributor/wholesaler
and then report back to you. If the distributor deigns to answer, the answer will
be the same--I sell Organic or conventional hard red wheat. Period. When I got these
non-answers I looked further and discovered that hard bread wheats run from about
12 percent protein to about 19 percent and this difference has everything to do with
the soil fertility (and to an extent the amount of rainfall during the season), and
almost nothing to do with Organic or conventional.
    This difference also has everything to do with how your dough
behaves and how your bread comes out. And how well your bread nourishes you. Thirteen
percent wheat will not make a decent loaf--fourteen percent is generally considered
#2 quality and comprises the bulk of cheap bread grain. When you hear in the financial
news that a bushel of wheat is selling for a certain price, they mean #2. Bakers
compete for higher protein lots and pay far higher prices for more protein.
    We prefer our bread about 25% rye, but rye contains no gluten
at all. Mix any rye flour into fourteen percent wheat flour and the dough becomes
very heavy, won&apos;t rise, and after baking, crumbles. So I kept looking for better
grain and finally discovered a knowledgeable lady that sold flour mills and who also
was a serious baker herself. She had located a source of quality wheat with an assayed
protein content and sold it by the 50 pound sack. When I asked her if her wheat was
Organic she said it was either sixteen or seventeen percent protein depending on
whether you wanted hard red spring wheat or hard white spring wheat. Organic or conventional?
I persisted. No, she said. High protein!
    So, I said to myself, since protein content is a function
of soil fertility and since my body needs protein, I figured I am better off eating
the best quality wheat, pesticide/herbicide residues (if there are any) be damned.
Think about it! The difference between seventeen percent and fourteen percent protein
is about 25 percent. That percentage difference is the key threshold of nutritional
deficiency that makes teeth fall out. We can&apos;t afford to accept 25% degradations
in our nutritional quality in something that we eat every day and that forms the
very basis of our dietary.
    Please understand here that I am not saying that high protein
wheats can&apos;t be grown organically. They certainly can. The founder of Great Harvest
Bakery performs a valuable service locating and securing high-protein lots of organically
grown wheats for his outlets. But often as not Organic products are no more nourishing
than those grown with chemicals. Until the buyers at Organic whole food wholesalers
get better educated about grain, obtaining one&apos;s personal milling stock from them
will be a dicey proposition.
    Sometimes Organic cereal can be far worse than conventional.
To make a cereal Organic is a negative definition; if it hasn&apos;t had chemicals, then
its Organic. Grain is one of the few foods that will still produce economic yields
of low quality seed on extremely infertile soil or when half-smothered in weeds because
herbicides weren&apos;t used for reasons of ideological purity. Vegetables will hardly
produce anything under those conditions; carelessly grown fruits and vegetables are
inevitably small, misshapen, unmarketable. But seed cleaning equipment can remove
the contamination of weed seeds in cereal grains (at a cost.)
    The price the farmer receives for Organic cereal grain is
much higher, so it is possible to accept rather low yields or expend more money for
cleaning out high levels of weed seeds from the field-run harvest, and still make
a good profit. A lousy Organic cereal crop like this might even make a higher profit
because the farmer has been spared the expense of fertilization, of rotation, of
weed control. I remember once I bought a sack of Organic whole oats that were the
smallest, most shriveled, bitterest oats I&apos;ve ever tried to eat. We ended up throwing
out that tiny, light (lacking density) seed in favor of using the&quot;conventional&quot;whole oats that were plump, heavy and sweet.
    Wheat is not the only cereal that is damaged by industrial
milling. So are oats. Most consumers have never seen whole oats; they look very much
like wheat berries. But rolled oats become rancid and stale on the shelf much like
wheat flour on the shelf.
    Another pitfall about using whole grains is that to be nutritious
they must still be fresh enough to sprout vigorously. A seed is a package of food
surrounding an embryo. The living embryo is waiting for the right conditions (temperature
and moisture) to begin sprouting. Sprouting means the embryo begins eating up stored
food and making a plant out of it. All foods are damaged by exposure to oxygen, so
to protect the embryo&apos;s food supply, the seed is surrounded by a virtually airtight
seed coat that permits only enough oxygen to enter for the embryo&apos;s respiration (yes,
seed breaths slowly). Often the embryo is located at the edge of the seed and has
its own air intake port. When the seed coat is removed or damaged, the innards are
exposed to air and begin deteriorating rapidly. In the case of oats, especially rapidly,
because oats are the only grass-based cereal that contains large quantities of oil--five
percent oil, more or less. That&apos;s why oats&quot;stick to your ribs.&quot;Rolled
oats become stale and lose their flavor (and nutritional content) and perhaps become
rancid very rapidly. So we make porridge from whole oat groats that we coarsely grind
to grits (steel-cut oats) in an electric seed/spice mill just before cooking.
    It is not easy to cook oat grits. They take a lot longer
than rolled oats and if not done exactly to the recipe I&apos;m about to give you, will
almost inevitably stick to the pot badly and may also froth over and mess the stove.
Here&apos;s how to cook them. Coarsely grind (like corn meal) your whole oats until you
have one cup of oat grits. Bring exactly four cups of water (no salt) to a very hard
boil at your highest heat. You may add a handful of raisins. Light or turn on a second,
small-sized burner on the stove and set it as low as possible. Into the fast boiling
water, slowly pour the ground oats, stirring continuously. Take about 30 seconds
to pour it all or you&apos;ll make clumps. Keep on the high heat until the water again
boils vigorously. Suddenly, the mixture will begin rising in the pot and will try
to pour all over the stove. This means it is all at boiling temperature again. Quickly
move the pot to the low burner; that instantly stops the frothing. Then cover. Let
the porridge cook for 30 minutes, stirring once or twice to prevent sticking. Then,
keeping it covered, turn off the heat. They can be eaten at this point but I think
it is better to let the oats finish soaking on the stove for at least two to four
hours. Then reheat in a double boiler, or warm in a microwave.
    We usually start a pot of oats at bedtime for the next morning.
See why people prefer the convenience of using rolled oats? But once you&apos;ve eaten
oats made right, you&apos;ll never prefer the flavor of rolled oats again. And if the
human body has any natural method of assaying nutritional content, it is flavor.
    Nutritionally, millet is almost the same story as oats. Millet
seed is protected by a very hard hull. Cooking unhulled millet is almost impossible.
After hours of boiling the small round seeds will still be hard and the hulls remain
entirely indigestible. Worse, the half-round hulls (they split eventually) stick
in your teeth. But prehulled millet, sitting in the sack for weeks and months, loses
a lot of nutrition and tastes very second-rate compared to freshly-hulled millet.
It is possible to buy unhulled millet, usually by special order from the health food
distributor--if you&apos;ll take a whole sack. Millet can be hulled at home in small batches.
Here&apos;s how we figured out how to do it. There probably are better ways.
    Using a cheap steel-burr flour mill, set the burrs just far
enough apart that the seed is ground to grits, but not flour. This pops the hulls
loose. An old mill with worn-out burrs works great for this job. Then you have to
get some hand seed cleaning screens just large enough to pass the grits but not pass
the hulls (most of them). Window screen or other hardware cloths won&apos;t work. Seed
cleaning screens come in increments of 1/128 inch; we use a 6/64&quot;round screen.
Other batches of millet might work better with a screen one step larger or smaller.
It will take you a little ingenuity to find hand-held screens. They&apos;re used by seed
companies and farmers to clean small batches of seed for inspection and are usually
about one square foot in size with a quality wooden frame. Larger frames made of
the same screening material are used in big seed cleaning machines. (The hulls could
also be winnowed out by repeatedly pouring the grit/hulls mixture back and forth
between two buckets in a gentle breeze.)
    After you&apos;ve screened out most of the hulls, the rest will
rinse out, floating off as you wash the grain prior to cooking. We never hull more
than enough millet for two or three meals and keep the uncooked (unwashed) millet
in the freezer in an airtight jar. It is interesting how people will accept poor
nutrition and its consequent sickness as the price of convenience.
    If you eat much buckwheat you should also figure out how
to hull (sometimes called groating) it yourself. Someone should write a thorough
book on the home milling of cereals. And perhaps sell the equipment by mail. Probably
would be a good little homestead business.
    Something else you need to keep in mind about seed. Even
though the embryo&apos;s food supply is protected by the seed coat, it still slowly deteriorates,
steadily oxidizing and losing nutritional value. Eventually old seed looses the ability
to sprout. The decline in germination ability matches a decline in nutritional quality.
Any seed you are going to use for eating should possess the ability to sprout, strongly
and rapidly. (After you&apos;ve comparatively sprouted a few grain samples, you&apos;ll know
what I mean by this.) Fortunately, cereal grains usually sprout well for quite a
few years after harvest if they have been stored cool and dry. Eating dead or near-dead
seeds will help move you closer to the same condition yourself.
    Finally, one more warning about buying store bread. Salt-free
bread tastes&quot;funny&quot;to most people. It bakes fine, salt is not necessary
to the leavening process, but no bakery could stay in business without salting their
bread. The standard level of salt is two percent by weight. That is quite a lot!
Two percent equals one teaspoonful per pound. I&apos;ll have more to say about the evils
of salt later on.
    I imagine some of my readers are feeling a little overwhelmed
by all these warnings and&quot;bewares ofs,&quot;and intricacies. They are used
to taking no responsibility for securing their own food supply quality and have come
to expect the&quot;system&quot;to protect them. I believe it is not because of
lack of government intervention, but because of government intervention itself, our
food system is very perverse. Until our mass consciousness changes, if you wish to
make yourself and your family truly healthy, you are going to have to take charge
and become quite a discriminating shopper. Unconscious consumers are on a rapid road
to the total unconsciousness of death.
    And again, let me remind you here that this one small book
cannot contain everything you should know. The bibliography at the end of should
become your guide to earning your post-graduate education in nutritional health.

 Freshness Of Fruits And Vegetables 
    Most people do not realize the crucial importance of freshness
when it comes to produce. In the same way that seeds gradually die, fruits and vegetables
go through a similar process as their nutritional content gradually oxidizes or is
broken down by the vegetables own enzymes, but vegetables lose nutrition hundreds
of times more rapidly than cereals. Produce was recently part of a living plant.
It was connected to the vascular system of a plant and with few exceptions, is not
intended by nature to remain intact after being cut. A lettuce or a zucchini was
entirely alive at the moment of harvest, but from that point, its cells begin to
die. Even if it is not yet attacked by bacteria, molds and fungi, its own internal
enzymes have begun breaking down its own substances.
    Vegetables, especially leafy vegetables, are far more critical
in this respect than most ripe fruits. All, however, deteriorate much like radioactive
material; they have a sort of half-life. The mineral content is stable, but in respect
to the vitamins and enzymes and other complex organic components, each time period
or&quot;half life&quot;results in the loss of half the nutrition. Suppose a lettuce
has a half life of 48 hours, two days after harvest only 50 percent of the original
nutrition remains. After two more days, half the remaining half is gone and only
25 percent is left. After two more days half of that 25 percent is lost. Thus six
days after harvest and a lettuce contains only bout 12 percent of its original nutrition.
A two day half-life is only hypothetical. Those types of produce I classify as very
perishable probably do have a half-life of from 36 to 48 hours. Moderately perishable
produce has a half life of about 72 hours; durable types of produce have half lives
of 96 hours or longer.


 Vegetable Storage Potential Very Perishable Moderately Perishable Durable lettuce zucchini apple spinach eggplant squash Chinese cabbage sweet peppers oranges kale broccoli cabbage endive cauliflower carrot peaches apricots lemons parsley   beets 


    
    The half life of produce can be lengthened by lowering its
temperature. For that reason, sophisticated produce growers usually use hydrocooling.
This process dumps a just-cut vegetable into icy water within minutes of being harvested,
lowering core temperature to a few degrees above freezing almost immediately. When
cut vegetables are crated up at field temperatures, and stacks of those crates are
put in a cooler, it can take the inside of the stack 24 hours, or longer, to become
chilled. Home gardeners should also practice hydrocooling. Fill your sink with cold
water and wash/soak your harvest until it is thoroughly chilled before draining and
refrigerating it. Or, harvest your garden early in the morning when temperatures
are lowest.
    Still, when you buy produce in the store it may have been
sitting at room temperature for hours or possibly days.
    The bottom line here: fresh is equally as important as unsprayed
or organically grown!

 The Real Truth About Salt And Sugar 
    First, let me remind certain food religionists: salt is salt
is salt is salt and sugar is sugar is sugar. There are no good forms of salt and
no good forms of sugar. Salt from a mine and salt from the sea both have the same
harmful effect; white sugar, natural brown sugar, honey, molasses, corn syrup, maple
syrup, whatever sweet have you. All are sugars and all have the similar harmful effects.
I know of no harmless salt substitute that really tastes salty. Nutrisweet is basically
harmless to most people and can be used as a very satisfactory replacement for sugars.
(A few people are unable to tolerate nutrisweet, causing the anti-chemicalists to
circulate much anti-nutrisweet propaganda, but you should carefully consider this
thought before dismissing nutrisweet--there is almost no food substance that some
people are not allergic to or unable to digest. The fact that nutrisweet is made
in a chemical vat and the fact that some cannot handle nutrisweet does not make it&quot;of the devil.&quot;
    And its not all black and white with the other items either.
Sea salt does have certain redeeming qualities not found in mined salt and under
certain very special conditions, eating small quantities of salt may be acceptable.
Similarly, some forms of sugar are not quite as harmful as other forms, though all
are harmful.
    The primary health problem caused by table salt is not that
it contributes to high blood pressure in people with poor kidneys, though it does
that. It is not that eating salt ruins the kidneys; salt probably does not do that.
The real problem with salt is that sodium chloride is an adrenal stimulant, triggering
the release of adrenal hormones, especially natural steroids that resist inflammation.
When these hormones are at high levels in the blood, the person often feels very
good, has a sense of well-being. Thus salt is a drug! And like many drugs of its
type, salt is a habituating drug. However, we are so used to whipping our adrenals
with salt that we don&apos;t notice it. What we do notice is that we think we like the
taste of salted food and consider that food tastes flat without it. But take away
a person&apos;s salt shaker and they become very uncomfortable. That&apos;s because the addict
isn&apos;t getting their regular dose.
    What&apos;s wrong with repetitive adrenal whipping is that adrenal
fortitude is variable; many people&apos;s adrenals eventually fail to respond to the prod
of salt and the body begins to suffer from a lack of adrenal hormones. Often those
inheriting weak adrenals manifest semi-failure in childhood. The consequence is that
ordinary, irritating substances begin causing severe irritation. The person becomes
allergic to pollen, dust, foods, animal danders, etc. We see asthma, hay fever, sinusitis,
etc. Though one can then discover specific allergens and try to remove them from
the environment or diet, often this case can be solved far more easily by complete
withdrawal from all salt. This rests the adrenals and they may recover their full
function; almost certainly their function will improve. The asthma, allergies and
etc., gradually vanish.
    Most of us don&apos;t need to eat salt as a nutrient. There&apos;s
enough sodium in one dill pickle to run a human body for a year. There&apos;s enough natural
sodium in many types of vegetables to supply normal needs without using table salt.
Perhaps athletes or other hard working people in the tropics eating deficient food
grown on leached-out depleted soils, people that sweat buckets day after day may
need a little extra sodium. Perhaps. Not having practiced in the humid tropics myself,
I have no definitive answer about this.
    Unfortunately, the average American is entirely addicted
to salt and thinks food tastes lousy without it. To please the average consumer,
almost all prepared foods contain far too much salt for someone suffering from exhausted
adrenals. Interestingly, Canadians do not like their foods nearly as salty as Americans,
and prepared foods like soups and the like in cans and packages that look just like
the ones in American supermarkets (though with French on the back panel) have to
be reformulated for our northern neighbors. I&apos;ve observed that Canadians are generally
healthier than Americans in many respects.
    We would all be far better off consuming no salt at all.
Those with allergies or asthma should completely eliminate it for a month or two
and discover if that simple step doesn&apos;t pretty much cure them. The trouble is that
bakery bread is routinely two percent salt by weight. Cheese is equally salted or
even more so. Canned and frozen prepared food products are all heavily salted. Restaurant
meals are always highly salted in the kitchen. If you want to avoid salt you almost
have to prepare everything yourself, bake your own bread, abstain from cheese (though
there are unsalted cheeses but even I don&apos;t like the flavor of these), and abstain
from restaurants. My family has managed to eliminate all salt from our own kitchen
except for that in cheese, and we eat cheese rather moderately.
    Sugar is a high-caloric non-food with enormous liabilities.
First, from the viewpoint of the universal formula for health, no form of non-artificial
sweetener carries enough nutrients with it to justify the number of calories it contains,
not even malt extract. White refined sugar contains absolutely no nutrients at all;
the&quot;good&quot;or&quot;natural&quot;sweets also carry so little nutrition
as to be next to useless. Sweets are so far over on the bad end of the Health = Nutrition
/ Calories scale that for this reason alone they should be avoided.
    However, healthy people can usually afford a small amount
of sin; why not make it sweets? In small quantity, sugars are probably the easiest
indiscretion to digest and the least damaging to the organ systems. Although, speaking
of sin, as Edgar Guest, the peoples&apos; poet, once so wisely quipped, (and my husband
agrees)&quot;Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.&quot;Sugar is a powerful drug!
People who abuse sweets set up a cycle of addiction that can be very hard to break.
It starts when the body tries to regulate blood sugar. Kicked up to high levels by
eating sugar, the pancreas releases insulin. But that is not the end of the chain
reaction. Insulin regulates blood sugar levels but also raises brain levels of an
amino acid called tryptophan. Tryptophan is the raw material the brain uses to manufacture
a neurotransmitter called serotonin. And serotonin plays a huge role in regulating
mood. Higher brain levels of serotonin create a feeling of well-being. Eating sugar
gives a person a chemical jolt of happiness. Heavy hits of high-glycemic index starch
foods are also rapidly converted to sugar. So don&apos;t give your kids sweets! Or huge
servings of starch to mellow them out. It is wise not to start out life a happiness
addict with a severe weight problem.
    Now that the chemistry of sugar addiction is understood,
there currently is a movement afoot to cast the obese as helpless victims of serotonin
imbalances and to&quot;treat&quot;them with the same kinds of serotonin-increasing
happy drugs (like Prozac) that are becoming so popular with the psychiatric set.
This promises to be a multiple billion dollar business that will capture all the
money currently flowing into other dieting systems and bring it right back to the
AMA/drug company/FDA nexus. The pitch is that when serotonin levels are upped, the
desire to eat drops and so is weight. This approach is popular with the obese because
it requires no personal responsibility other than taking a pill that really does
make them feel happy. However, the same benefit can be had by strict adherence to
a low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. Eventually, the brain chemistry rebalances itself
and serotonin levels stabilize.

    Remember, the pancreas has another major service to perform
for the body: secreting digestive enzymes to aid in the digestion of proteins. When
the diet contains either too much protein or too much sugar and/or high-glycemic
index starch foods, the overworked pancreas begins to be less and less efficient
at maintaining both of these functions.
    Sometimes a stressed-out pancreas gets overactive and does
too good a job lowering the blood sugar, producing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is
generally accompanied by unpleasant symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, blurred
vision, irritability, confusion, headache, etc. This condition is typically alleviated
by yet another hit of sugar which builds an addiction not only to sugar, but to food
in general. If the hypoglycemic then keeps on eating sugar to relieve the symptoms
of sugar ingestion, eventually the pancreas becomes exhausted, producing an insulin
deficiency, called diabetes. Medical doctors treat diabetes with insulin supplements
either oral or intramuscular plus a careful diet with very low and measured amounts
of sugar and starch for the remainder of the persons inevitably shortened and far
less pleasant life. However, sometimes diabetes can be controlled with diet alone,
though medical doctors have not had nearly as much success with this approach as
talented naturopaths. Sometimes, long fasting can regenerate a pancreas. It is far
better to avoid creating this disease!
    The dietary management of hypoglycemia requires that not
only refined but also unrefined sugars and starches with a high glycemic index be
removed from the diet. (The glycemic index measures the ease with which the starch
is converted into glucose in the body, and estimates the amount of insulin needed
to balance it out.) This means no sugar, no honey, no white flour, no whole grains
sweetened with honey, no sweet fruits such as watermelons, bananas, raisins, dates
or figs. Potatoes are too readily converted into sugar. Jerusalem artichokes are
a good substitute.
    People with hypoglycemia can often control their symptoms
with frequent small meals containing vegetable protein every two hours. When a non-sweet
fruit is eaten such as an apple, it should be eaten with some almonds or other nut
or seed that slows the absorption of fruit sugar. Hypoglycemics can improve their
condition with vitamins and food supplements. See the next chapter.
    Allergies to foods and environmental irritants are frequently
triggered by low blood sugar. Mental conditions are also triggered by low blood sugar
levels, frequently contributing to or causing a cycle of acting out behavior accompanied
by destruction of property and interpersonal violence, as well as psychosis and bouts
of depression. It is not possible to easily deal with the resulting behavior problems
unless the hypoglycemia is controlled. Unfortunately most institutions such as mental
hospitals and jails serve large amounts of sugar and starch and usually caffeinated
beverages, with a high availability of soda pop, candy, and cigarettes at concessions.
If the diet were drastically improved, the drugs given to control behavior in mental
hospitals would be much more effective at a lower dose, or unnecessary.
    The insulin-cycle overworked pancreas may eventually not
be able to secrete enough enzymes to allow for the efficient digestion of foods high
in protein. As stated earlier, poor protein digestion leads to a highly toxic condition
from putrefied protein in the intestines. This condition is alleviated by eliminating
animal proteins from the diet and taking digestive aids such as pancreatin pills
with meals to assist in the digestion of vegetable proteins.

 Food Combining And&quot;Healthfood Junkfood.&quot; 
    This brings us to a topic I call healthfood junkfood. Many
people improve their diet, eliminating meat and chemicalized food in favor of whole
grains and organically grown foods, but they then proceed to make these otherwise
good foods into virtual junkfood by preparing them incorrectly. In my travels, I&apos;ve
noticed this same thing happens everywhere on Earth. What should be health-producing
dietaries are ruined by frying, salting and sugaring.
    Healthfood junkfoods include organically grown potato chips
deep fried in cold pressed organic unsaturated canola oil (made rancid by frying)
sprinkled with natural sea salt; organically grown oat and nut granola roasted with
cold-pressed unsaturated oil (made rancid by roasting) hideously sweetened with honey;
carrot cake made with rancid whole wheat flour, cold pressed unsaturated oil (made
rancid by baking), honey, and cream cheese (salted); whole wheat cookies (stale,
rancid flour) sweetened with honey, made with vegetable oil baked at high heat (rancid);
whole wheat pizza vegetarian style with lots of soy cheese; whole wheat pizza vegan
style with lots of real raw milk cheese; organically grown corn chips deep fried
in cold pressed vegetable oil with or without natural sea salt, yogurts made from
powdered milk without an active culture of beneficial bacteria and covered with highly
sugared fruits, etc. These foods may well represent an improvement over the average
American diet, but they still are not healthy foods, and should never be used in
a diet for a sick person. Nor are they worthy of a person attempting to maximize
health.
    The problem with healthfood junkfoods is not their major
ingredients, but how they were combined and processed and adulterated. Remember,
fats, animal or vegetable, subjected to high heat become indigestible and toxic and
make anything they&apos;re cooked with indigestible; salt is a toxic drug; cheese, hard
enough to digest as it is, when raised to high temperatures as it is when making
pizza, becomes virtually indigestible and cheese inevitably contains a lot of butterfat
which, though saturated animal fat, when raised to high temperatures, still becomes
slightly rancid. And all these foods represent indigestible combinations.
    My clients almost never believe me when I first explain the
idea of food combining. They think if it goes in one end, comes out the other, and
they don&apos;t feel any unpleasant symptoms in between, then it was digested. But bad
food combinations have a cumulative degenerative effect over a long period of time.
When the symptoms arrive the victim never associates the food combination with the
symptom because it seems to them that they&apos;ve always been eating the food.
    Mainstream nutritionists have brainwashed the public into
thinking that we should have a representative serving from each of the&quot;four
basic food groups&quot;at each and every meal, plus a beverage and a desert. Or,
as my husband Steve is fond of quipping, a&quot;balanced meal&quot;has four colors
on every plate: something red, something green, something white and something yellow.
But the balanced meal is a gastronomic catastrophe that can only be processed by
the very young with high digestive vitality, the exceptionally vital of any age,
people with cast iron stomachs which usually refers to their good heredity, and those
who are very physically active.
    Few seem to realize that each type of food requires specific
and different digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and intestine. Carbohydrates,
fats, proteins--each requires differing acid or alkaline environments in order to
be digested. Proteins require an acid environment. Starch digestion requires an alkaline
environment. When foods in complex combinations are presented to the stomach all
together, like a meal with meat, potatoes, gravy, vegetables, bread, butter, a glass
of milk, plus a starchy sweet desert, followed by coffee or tea, the stomach, pancreas,
liver and small intestine are overwhelmed, resulting in the fermentation of the sugars
and starches, and the putrefaction of the proteins, and poor digestion of the whole.
It is little wonder that most people feel so tired after a large meal and need several
cups of strong coffee to be able to even get up from the table. They have just presented
their digestive tract with an immensely difficult and for some an impossible task.
    For the most efficient digestion, the body should be presented
with one simple food at a time, the one bowl concept, easily achieved by adherence
to the old saying,&quot;one food at a meal is the ideal.&quot;An example of this
approach would be eating fruits for breakfast, a plain cereal grain for lunch, and
vegetables for supper. If you can&apos;t eat quite that simply, then proper food combining
rules should be followed to minimize digestive difficulty, maximize the adsorption
of nutrients from your food, and reduce or eliminate the formation of toxemia, and
of course foul gas.
    In general, fruit should be eaten alone unless you happen
to be hypoglycemic or diabetic in which case fruit should be eaten with small quantities
of a vegetable protein such as nuts, or yogurt and/or cheese if able to digest dairy.
Starches should be eaten with vegetables, which means that a well combined meal would
include a grain such as rice, millet, buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa, corn, wheat, rye,
oats, spelt, potatoes, or starchy winter squash combined with raw or cooked vegetables.
Protein foods such as meat, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, split peas, should be combined
with vegetables, raw or cooked. But protein should never be combined with starches.
The most popular North American snacks and meals always have a starch/protein combination,
for example: meat and potatoes, hamburger in a bun, hot dog with bun, burrito with
meat or cheese, meat sandwiches, etc. It is little wonder that intestinal gas is
accepted as normal, and that over time these hard to digest combinations eventually
cause health problems that demand attention.
    Another sure fire way to ruin any food, including the very
best available is to eat in the presence of negative emotions generated by yourself
or others. Negative emotions include fear, anger, frustration, envy, resentment,
etc. The digestive tract is immediately responsive to stress and or negative thoughts.
It becomes paralyzed in negative emotional states; any foods eaten are poorly digested,
causing toxemia.
    It is natural for a person who has lost a loved one or suffered
a great loss of any kind to lose their appetite for a period of time. This reaction
is pro-survival, because while grieving, the body is griped by powerful negative
emotions. There are people who, under stress or when experiencing a loss, eat ravenously
in an attempt to comfort themselves. If this goes on for long the person can expect
to create a serious illness of some kind.
    Individual sensitivity to this type of overeating is dependent
upon genetics and personality and who is generating the negative emotions. Self generated
negative emotions are very difficult to avoid. If you are unable to change your own
emotional tone or that of others around you, then it is important to eat very lightly,
eat only easily digested foods such as raw fruits and vegetables, raw juices, steamed
vegetables, and small servings of whole grains, nuts and seeds.

 Diets To Heal The Critically Ill 
    A critically ill person is someone who could expire at any
moment; therapeutic interventions are racing against death. Can the body repair itself
enough before some essential function ceases altogether? If there already exists
too much damage to vital organs the person will die. If there remains sufficient
organ function to support life, enough vital force to power those functions, and
a will to live, the body may heal itself if helped by the correct therapeutic approach.
But the therapy does not do the healing; the body does that by itself--if it can.
This reality is also true of allopathic medicine.
    I believe fasting is the therapy that almost invariably gives
a critically ill person their very best chance of recovery. If a patient dies while
fasting they almost certainly would have died anyway, and if death comes while fasting,
it will be more comfortable, with less pain, and with more mental clarity.
    Critically ill people may have, among other things, any of
the following diagnoses: advanced cancer, advanced aids, heart failure, very high
blood pressure, kidney failure, advanced liver disease, advanced emphysema, pneumonia
or other catastrophic infections, especially those that seem unresponsive to antibiotics,
strokes, emboli, sclerotic vessels as found in arteriosclerosis, severe nerve degeneration
interfering with nerve transmission to vital organs.
    Treating the critically ill does not have to be an all or
nothing, ideological choice between holistic medicine and AMA style medicine. It
is important for the critically ill and their families to know that if they use standard
medical treatment such as drugs or surgery, these measures can and should be combined
with natural healing methods. It is always desirable to quit all addicting substances,
start a whole foods diet, (as light as possible), and add meganutrition (supplements)
to the medical doctor&apos;s treatments. Few medical doctors are so arrogantly partisan
as to assert that natural measures will do any harm as long as the MD is still allowed
to prescribe as they please.
    Holistic support will not only lessen the side effects of
the medical treatments but will speed up healing and often reduce the required dose
of prescribed drugs. I have had several clients with cancer who chose to have surgery,
radiation and chemotherapy, but stayed on a raw food diet and took high doses of
supplements throughout the treatment. These people amazed the attending physician
by feeling good with little if any fatigue, no hair loss, or flu symptoms. The same
can be true of other conditions.

 Food In The Order Of Digestive Difficulty 
    Individual digestive weaknesses and allergies are not taken
into account in this list.
 Hard To Digest: Meat, fish, chicken, eggs (if cooked), all legumes including
 soy products, peanuts and peanut butter, beans, split peas, lentils, chick peas,
 dairy products such as cheese, milk, butter milk, nuts and seeds and their butters.

 Intermediate: all grains--quinoa, amaranth, millet, spelt, rye, wheat,
 oats, barley.

 Fairly Easy: Brussels sprouts, green beans, green peas, broccoli, cauliflower,
 raw cultured milk products, asparagus, cabbage, sprouts especially bean sprouts,
 kale, other leafy greens.

 Very Easy: fruits, vegetable juices, fruit juices, broth (clear).

 No Effort: herb tea, water.

    Ethyl always comes to my mind when I think of how much
healing power can still be left in a dying body. She (accompanied by her husband
for support) came to Great Oaks School with terminal cancer, heart failure, advanced
diabetes, extreme weakness, and complete inability to digest. Any food ingested just
came back up immediately. Ethyl had large tumors taking over the breast, sticking
out from her skull, and protruding from her body in general. The largest was the
one in the left breast which was the size of a big man&apos;s fist.
    She did have one crucial thing going for her, Ethyl was a
feisty Irish red head who still had a will to live, and a reason to do so. She and
her husband, who had just retired, had dreamed their whole life of touring the US
and Canada in their own RV the minute he retired. The time had finally arrived but
Ethyl was too ill to support her own weight (only 90 pounds) and to top it off was
blind from diabetic retinopathy. The doctors had done everything they could to her,
and now judged her too weak to withstand any more surgery (she had already had her
right breast removed). Radiation or chemotherapy were also considered impossible
due to heart failure. They sent Ethyl home to die, giving her a few days to a month
at most.
    Any sensible hygienist trying to stay out of jail would have
refused to take on this type of case because it was a cancer case where death was
likely. Treatment of this highly lucrative disease is considered the AMA&apos;s exclusive
franchise, even when the medical doctors have given up after having done everything
to a body the family can pay for or owe for. Whenever a person dies under the care
of any person who is not a licensed M.D. there must be an autopsy and a criminal
investigation in search of negligence. If the person dies under the care of an M.D.
the sheriff&apos;s assumption is that the doctor most assuredly did everything he could
and should have done and death was inevitable. By accepting Ethyl I had a reasonable
likelihood of ending up in trouble; but being foolish, brave and (stupidly) feeling
relatively immune to such consequences (I was under 40 at the time), it seemed important
to try to help her. So, undaunted by the task, regardless of the outcome, I proceeded
logically, one step at a time. Today, with more experience and a modest net worth
I wouldn&apos;t want to have to defend in a lawsuit, and at age 55. possessing no spare
five to ten years to give to the State to&quot;pay&quot;for my bravery, I would
probably refuse such a case. Fortunately I have not been confronted with this problem
lately.
    Since Ethyl was unable to digest anything given by mouth,
she was fed rectally with wheat grass juice implants three times a day. She was carried
to the colonic table for a daily colonic. Wheat grass and clay poultices were applied
to her tumors three times a day. She received an acupressure massage and reflexology
treatments during the day, plus a lot of tender loving care. This program continued
for a month during which the tumors were being reabsorbed by the body, including
the large, extremely hard tumor sticking out the flesh of the right breast.
    Ethyl complained of severe pain as the large tumor in her
breast shrank. While it had been getting larger and pressing ever harder on all the
nerves, she had little or no sensation, but as it shrank, the nerves were reactivated.
Most people think that a growing tumor would cause more pain than a shrinking one.
Often the opposite is true. Pain can be a good sign that the body is winning, an
indicator to proceed.
    By the second month, Ethyl, gradually gaining strength, was
able to take wheat grass and carrot juice orally, and gradually eased into raw foods,
mostly sprouts and leafy greens such as sunflower and buckwheat greens grown in trays.
She started to walk with assistance up and down the halls, no longer experiencing
the intense pain formerly caused by a failing heart, and most surprising of all,
her eyesight returned, at first seeing only outlines, and then details.
    The third month Ethyl enlarged her food intake to include
raw foods as well as the carrot and wheat grass juice and sprouts, plus vitamin and
mineral supplements to help support her immune system and the healing process. All
the tumors had been reabsorbed by her body and were no longer visible, her heart
was able to support normal activity such as walking, and nonstrenuous household chores,
and her diabetes had corrected itself to the point that she no longer required insulin
and was able to control her blood sugar with diet.
    Her husband was then instructed in her maintenance and they
went home to continue the program. The last I heard from them they had made two lengthy
trips around the US in their RV and were enjoying their retirement together after
all.
    My treatment worked because the most important factor in
the healing of the critically ill person is not give them more nourishment than their
body is able to process. The moment the digestive capacity of the sick person is
exceeded, the condition will be exacerbated and in a critically illness, the person
is likely to die. If the body still has sufficient organ integrity and vital force
to heal itself, it will do so only if given the least possible nourishment that will
support life--provided no essential organs are hopelessly damaged. If the liver and
kidneys are functional, and the person has done some previous dietary improvement
and/or cleansing, success is likely, especially if the person wants to live.
    A person in critical condition does not have time to ease
into fasting by first spending a month or two on a raw foods diet. This means that
the person who is taking care of the critically ill person must be experienced enough
to adjust the intensity of the body&apos;s healing efforts and accurately assess the ability
of the person to process toxic waste products clamoring for removal so the ailing
body is not drowned in it&apos;s own poisons. It is often necessary to use clear vegetable
broth, vegetable and wheat grass juices, and fruits juices, or whole sprouts to slow
down the cleansing gradient and sometimes, to resupply the tissue&apos;s exhausted nutritional
reserves.
    I wish all cases of critical illness had such a positive
outcome as Ethyl&apos;s, but unfortunately they don&apos;t. I had Marge on the same program
at the same time. She also had cancerous tumors all over her body and had similarly
been sent home to die. In some ways Marge&apos;s body was a more likely candidate for
survival than Ethyl&apos;s. Marge did not have heart failure or diabetes and was still
able on arrival to at least take small amount of water orally and walk to the bathroom.
Put on a similar program, her tumors also shrunk and were reabsorbed and she too
went home.
    But Marge did not really have a strong reason to live. Although
her husband was by her side throughout the treatment program, Marge was deeply upset
because she was estranged from one of her sons who she had not seen for over 10 years.
When she went home from Great Oaks, the son finally consented to see his mother,
went to the effort of trying to work things out with her, and finally confessed that
under it all he still loved her.
    At that point Marge died in peace. She had accomplished the
last thing she wanted to take care of and her will to live did not extend beyond
that point. Had she died several months earlier as predicted by the medical profession,
Marge would have been unable to resolve this relationship. This was what Marge&apos;s
life was pivoting on at the end. I was glad to assist her in doing what she needed
to do. Her husband and other family members found it difficult to understand, and
they were hurt that Marge did not wish to continue her life with them.

 Diet For The Chronically Ill. 
    The chronically ill person has a long-term degenerative condition
that is not immediately life threatening. This condition usually causes more-or-less
continuous symptoms that are painful, perhaps unsightly, and ultimately will be disabling
or eventually capable of causing death. To qualify as&quot;chronic&quot;the symptoms
must have been present a minimum of six months, with no relief in sight. People with
these conditions have usually sought medical assistance, frequently have had surgery,
and have taken and probably are taking numerous prescription drugs.
    Some examples of chronic conditions are: arthritis, rheumatism,
diabetes, early onset of cancer and aids, asthma, colitis, diverticulitis, irritable
bowel syndrome, some mental disorders, arterial deposit diseases, most of the itises
(inflammations).
    Before fasting, the chronically ill often do have time to
prepare the way with limited dietary reform, and frequently begin to feel relief
quite quickly. Before actually fasting they should limit their diet to raw foods
and eliminate all toxic foods like alcohol, coffee, tea, salt, sugar and recreational
drugs for two months if they have been following a typical American diet.
    If the chronically ill had been following a vegetarian diet,
perhaps a diet including with eggs and dairy, if they had been using no addicting
substances, then one month on raw foods is sufficient preparation for fasting. If
the person had water or juice fasted for at least a week or two within the last two
years, and followed a healthy diet since that time, one or two weeks on raw foods
should be a sufficient runway.
    During preparation for a fast, I never recommend that a chronically
ill person quit taking prescription medicines because doing so can seriously disrupt
their homeostasis. However, if their symptoms lessen or vanish during the pre-fasting
clean up, the person might try tapering off medications.
    The length and type of fast chosen to resolve a chronic illness
depends largely on available time, finances, availability of support people, work
responsibilities, and mental toughness. If you are one of those fortunate people
&apos;rich&apos; enough to give their health first priority, long water fasting is ideal. If
on the other hand you can&apos;t afford to stop working, have no one to take care of you
and assist with some household chores, and/or you are not mentally tough enough to
deal with self-denial, compromise is necessary.
    Ideally the chronically ill person would fast for an extended
period under supervision until their symptoms were gone or greatly improved, with
a fall-back plan to repeat the whole process again in three to six months if necessary.
If you are not able to do that, the next best program is to fast for a short period,
like one or two weeks, with a plan to repeat the process as often as possible until
you are healed.
    I have had clients with potentially life-threatening conditions
such as obesity with incipient heart failure, or who came to me with cancer, that
were unable to stop work for financial reasons, or who could not afford a residential
fasting program, or who felt confident in their own ability to deal with detoxification
in their own home. These people have fasted successfully at home, coming to see me
once a week. Almost inevitably, successful at-home fasters had already done a lot
of research on self healing, believed in it, and had the personal discipline to carry
it out properly, including breaking the fast properly without overeating.


 Foods To Heal Chronic Illness Sprouts Baby Greens Salad Juices Fruit alfalfa sunflower lettuce beet grapefruit radish buckwheat celery celery lemon bean zucchini zucchini lime lime clover kale kale orange orange fenugreek endive radish parsley apple wheat   tomato tomato raspberries cabbage   cabbage cabbage blueberries     carrot carrot grapes     spinach apple peaches     parsley grapefruit apricots     sweet pepper lemon strawberry 



    Fruits should be watery and lower in sugar. Some examples
of poor fruit choices would be pineapple, ripe mango, bananas, dates, raisins, figs.
Fruits should not be combined with vegetables.
    Vegetables should not be starchy, packed-full of energy.
Poor vegetable choices would be potato, parsnip, turnip, corn, sweet potato, yam,
beet, winter squash. Sprouts and baby greens are vegetables and may be included in
salads.
    Juices should not be extremely sweet. Apple, orange, beet
and carrot juice should be diluted with 50% water. Fruit juices should not be mixed
with vegetable juices or with vegetables at the same meal.
    Salads should include no fruit. Salad dressings should be
lemon or lime juice, very small quantities of olive oil, and herbs. No salt, soy
sauce nor black pepper. Cayenne can be okay for some.
    I have also helped chronically ill people that were not mentally
prepared to water fast, but were able to face the long-term self-control and deprivation
of a raw food cleansing diet that included careful food combining. These people also
regained their health, but it took them a year at minimum, and once well they had
to remain on a diet tailor-made to their digestive capacity for the rest of their
life, usually along with food supplements.
    Jim was such a case. He was 55 years old, very obese, had
dangerously high blood pressure poorly controlled with medication, and was going
into congestive heart failure. He was on digitalis and several other heart medications
plus diuretics, but in no way was his condition under control. He had severe edema
in the feet and legs with pitting, and fluid retention in the abdominal region caused
a huge paunch that was solid to the touch not soft and squishy like fatty tissue.
    Jim had dreamed of having his own homestead with an Organic
garden, now he had these things but was too sick to enjoy them or work in his garden
without severe heart pain and shortness of breath. Jim had retired early in order
to enjoy many years without the stresses of work, and he was alarmed to realize that
he was unlikely to survive a year.
    The day Jim came to see me the first time I would have classified
his condition as critically ill because his life was in immediate danger; but he
responded so quickly to his detox program that he was very soon out of danger and
would be more accurately described as a chronically ill person. Jim was not prepared
to water fast. He was attached to having his food and he was aware that at his extreme
weight he was going to have stay on a dietary program for a long, long time. He also
wanted to choose a gradient that he could manage by himself at home with little assistance
from his wife. He had been on a typical American diet with meat, coffee, etc., so
that in spite of his dangerous condition it did not seem wise to me to add the heavy
eliminatory burden of a water fast to a body that was already overwhelmed with fluids
and waste products.
    Jim immediately went on a raw food cleansing diet, with no
concentrated foods like nuts, seeds, or avocados, and with one day each week fasting
on vegetable juice and broth. He did enemas daily even though it wasn&apos;t his favorite
thing. In one month he had lost 30 pounds, his eyes had started to sparkle, and his
complexion was rosy. The swelling had disappeared from his feet and legs, and he
had to buy new pants.
    Starting the second month he gradually withdrew from prescription
medications. From the beginning I had put Jim on a program of nutritional supplements
including protomorphogens (see chapter on vitamins and food supplements) to help
the body repair it&apos;s heart and the kidneys. In only four months he had returned his
body to glowing health, and looked great for his age, though he was still overweight.
At the end of one year he had returned to a normal weight for his height, and only
cheated on the diet a couple of times when attending a social event, and then it
was only a baked potato with no dressing.
    He was probably going to have many qualitative years working
his garden and living out his dreams. The local intensive care ward lost a lot of
money when they failed to get Jim.

 Diet For The Acutely Ill 
    The acutely ill person experiences occasional attacks of
distressing symptoms, usually after indiscretions in living or emotional upsets.
They have a cold, or a flu, or sinusitis, or a first bout of pneumonia, or a spring
allergy attack. The intense symptoms knock them flat and force them to bed for a
few days or a week. If they are sick more often than that, they are moving toward
the chronically ill category.
    People who are acutely ill should stop eating to whatever
extent that they are able until the symptoms are gone. During an acute illness, the
appetites is probably pretty dull anyway, so why not give a brief fast on water or
fruit juice a try.
    Most acute conditions are short in duration, usually not
lasting more than a week. Allergy attacks, some types of flu, and a first bout of
pneumonia may well last for three weeks or a month. The general rule is to eat as
little as possible until the symptoms have passed, self-administer colon cleansing,
even if you have a horror of such things, and take vitamin supplements, including
megadoses of Vitamin C, bioflavinoids, and zinc. (See the chapter on vitamins.) Those
having a little experience with natural medicine make teas of echinacea, fenugreek
seeds and red clover and quit eating. Eating as little as possible can mean only
water and herb teas, only vegetable broth, only vegetable juice or non-sweet fruit
juice, even only cleansing raw foods. If you eat more than this you have not relieved
your system of enough digestive effort.
    After your symptoms are gone it is very important to change
your life-style and improve your diet so that you aren&apos;t so toxic and don&apos;t have
to experience an acute illness several times a year when your body is forced to try
an energetic detox.

 Diet For A Healthy Person 
    I doubt that it is possible to be totally healthy in the
twentieth century. Doctors Alsleben and Shute in their book How to Survive the New
Health Catastrophes state that in-depth laboratory testing of the population at large
demonstrated four universally present pathological conditions: heavy metal poisoning,
arteriosclerosis, sub-clinical infections, and vitamin/mineral deficiencies. Those
of us who consider ourselves healthy, including young people, are not really healthy,
and at the very least would benefit from nutritional supplementation. In fact the
odds against most people receiving adequate vitamin and mineral nutrition without
supplements are very poor as demonstrated by the following chart.
