 Perception Defined: 
 Perception is the process by which people
 select, organize, and interpret sensory stimulation into a
 meaningful and coherent picture of the world. 
 
 Perception and Culture: 
 
 Perception is culturally determined. People see the world based on their
 cultural background. Our perception of the world is connected to
 our beliefs, values, attitudes, and world view 
 
 The Perception Process 
 
 Selection : The perception
 process begins when the observer selects what aspects of the
 environment will be perceived. 
 
 1. motives: we are more likely to pay
 attention to stimuli when it helps us meet a need. For example,
 when you are hungry you notice every fast food restaurant for
 miles. 

 2. expectations: we are more likely to pay
 attention to stimuli that supports our beliefs and previous
 perceptions. For example, if you meet someone that you dont
 like, you will continue to look for reasons to not like him/her. 

 3. repetition: we are more likely to pay
 attention to stimuli that occurs again and again, such as a
 dripping faucet. 

 4. contrast or change: we are more likely to
 pay attention to stimuli that is changing. For example, you are
 more likely to notice a friends hair after he/she has it cut. 
 
 Test your selection process
 now:
Read the sentence in the box below: 
 
 
FINISHED FILES ARE THE RESULT OF YEARS OF
 SCIENTIFIC STUDY COMBINED WITH
THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS. 
 
 Now count the F&apos;s in that
 sentence. Count them only once.
When you&apos;re done, type in your answer and 
 
 
 Organization : This stage of
 the process refers to the human need to place what we 

 perceive into a whole to which the thing
 perceived seems to belong. Go to the perception activity to see
 how you organize images. 
 
 1. Prototypes represent the most
 typical or ideal example of a particular group of people,
 places, objects, activities, relationships, or events. For
 example, most people have a prototype for what a typical college
 professor looks like: 

 

 2. Stereotypes occur when we
 categorize people based on easily identifiable traits, such as
 race, gender, or age, and then we make attributions about their
 group membership. 

 3. Scripts are a sequence of
 behaviors that we have for how we and others should act in
 particular situations. For example, when we greet someone it is
 polite to say&quot;How are you?&quot;A polite response is&quot;I am fine, thank you.&quot; 
 
 Interpretation : The third
 stage of the process is where people assign meaning to what they
 have observed. 
 
 1. Attribution Theory: attributions are
 explanations for why things happen or people act the way they
 do. 

 2. A self-serving bias occurs when we take
 excessive personal credit for our successes and assume someone
 or something else is responsible when for our poor performances. 

 3. A fundamental attribution error occurs
 when we overestimate the internal causes and underestimate the
 external causes of others undesirable behaviors or when we
 overestimate the external causes and underestimate the internal
 causes of our undesirable behaviors.
