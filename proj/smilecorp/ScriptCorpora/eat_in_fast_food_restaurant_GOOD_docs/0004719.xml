PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION. I/O 
Si?*- 

So great a favourite has my brother&apos;s book, &quot; Standard 
Methods,&quot; been in the past that no apology need be made 
for this fifth edition. 

As, however, it has proved necessary to greatly revise 
the work, some explanation is due to those who may feel 
disappointed in not securing the same set of methods which 
have been heretofore in circulation. 

It has long been known even to my brother in his 
life-time that many superior methods might have been 
chosen, but alterations have been postponed time after time 
for the sake of uniformity ; in fact, the book has been viewed, 
latterly, more as a text book for the learner than as an 
authority on the point of what should constitute a sound 
method. 

This state of affairs could not continue, of course, and 
now a systematic attempt has been made to bring all into 
line with the advanced thought of the day ; the new pur- 
chaser, therefore, will find it is trusted that he is now 
buying the book of the future, and not of the past. 

Three special efforts have been made : first, to insert 
only such even-bell methods as produce the lead-ends of 
Plain-Bob in the plain course when of that character ; 
secondly, to reject, as far as possible, all Minor Methods 
turning up &apos;65 at back-stroke ; and lastly, to supply Seven 
Surprise Minor Methods of as true a Surprise character as 
repeated researches point to as possible. 

Dealing with the first point : Endeavours were made 
200 years ago, for correct lead-ends, a notable one being 
the alteration of &quot; College Bob V.,&quot; of 1677, to &quot; Westminster,&quot; 

788130 



in 1702 ; the only alteration necessary to bring the 
figures into correct form being the substitution of third&apos;s 
place for fifth&apos;s, with the treble behind. But, alas, no sustained 
endeavour followed, and even such a careful observer as my 
brother seems to have contented himself by the addition 
of marks of admiration, in his note-books, to those methods 
which had the desired lead-endsprobably the matter was 
not ripe in his day for the advance now demanded by the 
leading members of our Central Council. One more example 
of careless lead-ends may be interesting : When Cambridge 
Surprise Major first appeared in print in 1766, its lead-ends 
were irregular, and it was left for the &quot; Clavis&quot; in 1788, to 
put the matter right, and to hand it down to us in good 
order. 

The second point : The avoidance of Minor Methods 
with &apos;65 at back-stroke : This is intimately although 
not entirely connected with correct lead-ends. There is a 
tendency to think that ordinary methods with correct lead- 
ends are so far safe that the &apos;65s at back-stroke may be left 
to take care of themselves, but it is not so, for London Treble 
Bob Minor had correct lead-ends, and yet it turned up six 
&apos;65s at back-stroke in the 720. But the worst and greatest 
offender is our old favourite &quot; Duke of York,&quot; for not only 
did it transgress with its irregular lead-ends, but, out of the 
twenty-four possible, it produced eighteen of these discordant 
&apos;65s at back-stroke ; in fact, the only correct &apos;56s are those 
at the three part-ends, where the conductor positively 
&quot; calls &quot; these bells to behave properly at the full lead and 
dodge, which close the division ! It is foreign to our imme- 
diate purpose to allude here to the mistaken custom that 
many six- bell companies have in the North, of ringing without 
the open lead at hand, but we cannot pass without claiming 



for the county, which loves the &apos;&apos; Duke of York,&quot; that it is 
distinctly a musical part of our country, hence possibly its 
six-bell ringers have dropped the open-leads to improve 
the music of bad methods ! If so, the endeavour to banish 
&apos;65s at back should do good in this direction. The mathe- 
matical music of our bells demands punctuation to bring out 
its rhythm, and all to the contrary is monotonous, and 
unworthy of the Art in the opinion of every writer that has 
touched upon the subject. 

The third aim of the work, viz., the selection of seven 
genuine Surprise Minor Methods, has been a difficult one, 
for it necessitated much analytical investigation to gain a 
true understanding of the points that constitute a Surprise 
Method. Even some experts who correctly hold that treble bob 
behaviour at the cross-sections, viz., where the treble passes 
from one dodging place to another, at once destroys all 
claim to the title of Surprise (as witness the general agree- 
ment as to Coventry, erroneously, with many others, dubbed 
Surprise in the &quot; Clams &quot;) seem to think lightly of treble 
bob work introduced at the two greatest cross-sections of all, 
viz., when the treble leads and lies ! No such loose notions 
have been allowed to creep in here, and every extreme posi- 
tion of the treble, fore and aft, has been treated after the 
manner of Cambridge and London Surprise, that is to say, 
with correct internal places. An important advance in 
method building and composition might be termed a 
&quot; Triumph,&quot; when it cannot be classed as a Surprise. 

Cambridge, London, York, and Beverley, all behave 
perfectly in the matter of their &apos;65s at back, but, alas, Carlisle, 
Chester, and Canterbury assert their Surprise disabilities, 
and turn up &apos;65 twice in a part, or six times in a 720. Having 
spent a considerable amount of time in experimenting as to 



the possibility or otherwise of avoiding these blemishes, 
the Author&apos;s old friends, Messrs. Penning and Pitstow were 
written to, asking whether they could throw any further 
light on the subject. Curiously, my brother had, it appears, 
corresponded with them on this same point when busy with 
the matter that now forms page 71 fifth edition of 
&quot; Ropesight.&quot; Their very instructive reply if put into 
short language stands substantially thus : Even if with 
correct lead-ends, you have a method that still insists upon 
sending the tenors behind, in the plain course, in an order 
unknown in the plain course of Bob Minor, look out for 
squalls ! With this terse way of summing up and with 
many thanks for it the question may be left for the reader&apos;s 
further examination. A word of caution may assist those 
seeking for true daylight in Surprise matters : Canterbury 
Surprise differs from what was previously known as Canter- 
bury Bob ; the difference may be slight, but there it is, and 
it prevents &quot; stagnation &quot; behind. 

I have to thank Sir Arthur Heywood for his permis- 
sion to make extracts from his book on &quot; Duffield.&quot; This 
method is a very musical one, and should be kept alive, 
especially by ten and twelve bell towers where the tenor 
is not too heavy to turn in. To Mr. John Carter my thanks 
are also due for letters and explanations, for I could not 
make headway with his new principle at first sight. That 
all is now quite plain is my hope. 

It is, we fear, quite impossible to have escaped all errors 
in such a difficult revision as this, and we need hardly say 
how grateful we shall be to anyone pointing out any im- 
provements for the next edition, and, alas, any inconsistences, 
if such there be, that may have slipped in.

CHAP. I. THE PLAIN BOB METHOD. 

(Dates from Stedman&apos;s time.&quot;, 



THE underlying principle of this is plain hunting, except when 
the treble leads ; the bell then turned from the lead makes 
second&apos;s place, and the others dodge. Plain Bob, though 
primarily an &quot; even bell &quot; method, is adaptable to odd num- 
bers ; in these cases, when the treble leads, the bell behind, 
having no one to dodge with, lies four blows there. 

Plain Bob is best rung by noticing where each bell passes 
the treble, and learning the relative order in which the 
variations from plain hunting follow one another, as below. 

Beginners requiring further explanations are referred to 
Snowdon&apos;s &quot; Ropesight.&quot; 

All numbers on the left of the rules refer to the different 
leads first lead, second lead, and so on ; and the duty 
appearing in the same line relatively corresponds.

Standard Methods. 



As a bob causes an alteration in the work of the bells in 
front only, the following table of these alterations will serve 
for this and any other number of bells : 

A bob alters the work of the bells thus : 

A bell, that would have made second&apos;s place, runs out quick. 
A bell, that would have dodged in 3-4 down, runs in quick. 
A bell, that would have dodged in 3-4 up, makes fourth&apos;s place 
and goes down to lead again, and is said to &quot; make the bob.&quot; 

BOB MINOR ; Diagram page 2. 

Duty of each bell, after making second&apos;s place. 

1. Turn the treble from behind . . Dodge in 3-4 down. 

2. Pass the treble in 4-5 Dodge in 5-6 down, after lying full. 

3. Pass the treble in 3-4 Dodge in 5-0 up, before lying full. 

4. Pass the treble in 2-3 Dodge in 3-4 up. 

5. Treble turns you from the lead, Make second&apos;s place, and lead again. 

On six bells another alteration, in addition to the Bob, 
is required. This is called a &quot; Single,&quot; and is made by the 
bells in second&apos;s, third&apos;s, and fourth&apos;s places, lying still. As 
the bells above fourth&apos;s place are not altered by a Single, 
the three following rules embrace the different duties, of the 
bells concerned in such a call, on any number of bells : 

The duty of the Bells at a Single. 

A bell, turned from the lead by the treble, makes second&apos;s place, 
and leads again, as at a plain lead. 

A bell, that would have dodged in 3-4 up, makes fourth&apos;s place, 
and goes down to lead again, thus doing &quot; the bob work of the single.&quot; 

A bell, that turned the treble from behind, and would have 
dodged in 3-4 down, makes third&apos;s place, and then hunts up again, 
and is said to &quot; make the single.&quot; 

Examples of a &quot;bob, and single, follow the plain course 
diagram.

* These are now considered irregular, but they are quite justifiable as a step, 
for tlie beginner, between Minor and Major. Grandsire Doubles and Triples are 
undoubtedly much more musical than the Doubles and Triples of Plain Bob, and 
that alone should settle the question. En. 



CHAP. 11. THE GRANDSIRE METHOD. 

(Datt jrmii Siedman&apos;* time.&apos; 



IN this the treble has a plain hunting path, and so likewise 
have all the bells, except when the treble is at the lead. The 
bell turned from the lead by the treble makes third&apos;s place, 
and the others, behind, dodge. 

The peculiarity of the method is that one bell, namely, 
that which courses after the treble, is not interrupted in its 
work either by the place-making or dodging, but continues 
to hunt up and down after the treble. This bell (the second 
in the plain course) is said to be &quot; in the hunt with the treble&quot; 
or, more briefly, &quot; in the hunt.&quot; The bell making the third&apos;s 
place at each lead-end is said to be &quot; before ; &quot; and the bells 
behind are said to dodge in 4-5 up, 4-5 down, and so on. 

Like Plain Bob, it is rung by the course method, and by 
observing in which place each bell, after leaving the lead, 
passes the treble. 

Grandsire commences on five bells, and although 
primarily an odd-bell method, may be rung on even numbers. 
In giving the rules for ringing the method, as, in the plain 
course, the second is in the hunt, the duty will be commeix&lt;&lt;{ 
from the position of a bell after making third&apos;s place. In 



Grandsire Doubles. 



Grandsire, on account of the bell in the hunt, a plain course 
consists of one treble lead less than usual in other methods. 

GRANDSIRE DOUBLES ; Diagram page 1. 

Duty of each bell, after making third&apos;s place. 

1. Pass the treble in 3-4 Dodge in 4-5 down, after lying full. 

2. -Pass the treble in 2-3 Dodge in 4-5 up, before lying full. 

3. ^-Treble turns you from the lead, Make third&apos;s place, and lead again. 

With regard to the practical ringing of Grandsire, a 
beginner should remember, in coming down after each lead- 
end, the following important directions : 

When making third&apos;s place, the last blow in third&apos;s will be over 
the treble. 

After dodging in 4-5 down, the first bell to take, on the way down, 
is the treble. 

After dodging in 4-5 up, the last blow of the whole pull behind 
will be over the treble. 

After taking the treble, either in going up or down, the next blow 
will be over the bell in the hunt. 

If, when out of the tower, a beginner will carefully study 
these directions, and afterwards pay attention to them when 
ringing, it is obvious that, in the plain course of Grandsire 
Doubles, as he will know when to strike over the treble, and 
the bell in the hunt (the second), there remain the move- 
ments of two bells only which he need specially watch. 

To facilitate reference to the figures in the foregoing and 
following remarks, plain, bob, and single leads are given 
over-leaf.&lt;5 Standard Methods. 



A bob in Grandsirc requires a third&apos;s place to be made 
before the &quot;treble has fully led, in addition to the ordinary 
third&apos;s place when the treble has done leading. Two third&apos;s 
places are thus made at a bob, and the bells making these 
third&apos;s places are, respectively, said to make the &quot; first 
third&apos;s &quot; and &quot; last third&apos;s.&quot;* The first third&apos;s compels the 
bells then behind to dodge ; and, that, in the places previous 
to those in which they would have so done had no call been 
made ; and the last third&apos;s causes them to repeat this dodge. 
At a bob, therefore, the bells behind make a double dodge, 
and commence such dodging a whole pull earlier than they 
would otherwise have done. (*See foot note, page 14.)

An ordinary Grandsire single is made by the bells in 
second&apos;s and third&apos;s places lying still ; that is, the bell that 
the&apos;treble turns from the lead makes second&apos;s place, and the 

UK 

bell that makes first third&apos;s also makes last third&apos;s thus 
striking four blows in third&apos;s place. The bells behind make a 
double dodge, as at a bob, and commence dodging a whole 
pull earlier than at a plain lead. 

Both at a bob and a single, the bell in the hunt has its 
plain hunting course stopped, and is compelled, further, to 



Grandsire Doubles. 



make a double dodge in 4-5 down, and take its place amongst 
the other &quot; inside &quot; bells ; it is then said to &quot; come out of 
the hunt&quot; The ringer who makes the first third&apos;s at a bob, 
or the second&apos;s place at a single, must remember that his bell 
then &quot; goes into the hunt&quot; A bob therefore alters the duty 
of every bell, with the exception of the one that makes last 
third&apos;s. The following rules for making a bob in Grandsire 
Doubles should therefore be committed to memory. 

A bob alters the work of the bells thus : 

(a) A bell, in the hunt makes a double dodge in 4-5 down, and 
comes out of the hunt. 

(6) A bell, that would have dodged in 4-5 down, makes a double 
dodge in 4-5 up, with the bell that comes out of the hunt. 

(c) A bell, that would have dodged in 4-5 up, makes first third&apos;s, 
that is, &quot; makes the bob,&quot; goes down to lead, and becomes the bell 
in the hunt. 

At a single the work of every bell is altered, two doing 
duty as at a bob. 

A single alters the work of the bells thus~? 

(a) A bell in the hunt &quot; comes out,&quot; as at a bob. 

(b) A bell due to dodge in 4-5 down behaves as at a bob. 

(c) A bell, that would have dodged in 4-5 up, strikes four blows 
in third&apos;s place, does &quot; the bob work of a single,&quot; and goes down 
to lead. 

(d) A bell turned from the lead by the treble, and that would 
have made third&apos;s place, makes second&apos;s place, leads again, and be- 
comes the bell in the hunt, and is said to &quot; make the single.&quot; 

Besides learning these rules, each beginner should 
observe, from the figures, where he will first strike over the 
treble after completing the work at a bob, or a single. He 
will thus see that the bells in 4-5 continue dodging until

separated by the treble, and he will also learn how to make 
other useful notes for his guidance when ringing. Each one 
should also make himself acquainted with the work he will do 
at the lead following a bob, or a single lead, whether such be 
a plain, bob, or single lead.

In ringing Grandsire on even numbers, a bell lies four 

blows behind at each plain lead. At a bob, or single, the bell 

that would have dodged in 4-5 down, lies six blows behind, 

as in the following examples taken from the first lead :

A bob alters the work of bells thus : 
A bell, in the hunt, makes a double dodge in 4-5 down, and leaves 

the hunt. 

A bell, due to dodge in 4-5 down, makes a double dodge in 6-7 down. 
A bell, due to dodge in 6-7 down, makes a double dodge in 6-7 up. 
A bell, due to dodge in 6-7 up, makes a double&apos; dodge in 4-5 up. 
A bell, due to dodge in 4-5 up, makes first third&apos;s, and enters the hunt. 




10 Standard Methods. 



At an ordinary single, a bell, turned from the lead by the 
treble, makes second&apos;s place, and, leading again, becomes the 
bsll in the hunt ; a bell making first third&apos;s, also makes 
second third&apos;s, and leads again ; whilst the pairs behind make 
a double dodge. 

Besides this ordinary single there is another which is 
sometimes used in Grandsire Triples. In this, which is known 
as a &quot; Holt&apos;s Single.&quot; the bells in fourth&apos;s, fifth&apos;s, sixth&apos;s, 
and seventh&apos;s places lie still. The singles are used in Holt&apos;s 
six-part and ten-part peals, and as these are often rung it 
may prove useful to have examples. I therefore give them 
as they usually occur, namely, one at the end of the first 
half -peal, and the other at the coming round.

CHAP. III. THE TREBLE BOB SYSTEM. 

OXFORD, dales from 1677 ; AND KENT, from 1788. 

TREBLE BOB is not well adapted for practice on a less number 
than six. The simplest, or primary methods, on which the 
system is founded, are known as Oxford, and Kent ; and as 
they are so frequently practised I shall here explain them 

* Snowdon&apos;s &quot;Grandsire&quot; should be consulted by those desiring further 
information. ED. 



12 Standard Methods. 



both. Before, however, proceeding to lay down rules for 
ringing them, I must call attention to, the zig-zag hunting 
course of the treble, peculiar to all Treble Bob methods. 

This, although perfectly uniform in each treble lead, is 
totally different from the straight hunting course in Plain 
Bob, and Grandsire, and it is therefore the first thing with 
which a ringer has to make himself acquainted. 

Reference to any of the Treble Bob Minor diagrams 
(pages 6 to 21), will show that the treble dodges in each place 
in its progress up and down. Thus, after leading the whole 
pull (or, in fewer words, leading full), the treble strikes one 
blow in second&apos;s place, and, dodging back, strikes another 
blow at the lead. It then hunts up into fourth&apos;s, and dodges 
back into third&apos;s ; hunts up behind, and, striking one blow 
there, dodges back into fifth&apos;s, and then lies full. After this 
it strikes one blow in fifth&apos;s, and dodges back into sixth&apos;s ; 
then hunts down into third&apos;s, and dodges back into fourth&apos;s ; 
then hunts down to the lead, and, striking one blow there, 
dodges back into second&apos;s place, and then leads full. 

The technical way of expressing this is as follows : The 
treble is said to dodge on the lead after leading full ; to dodge in 
the middle going up ; to dodge behind before lying full ; and, 
similarly, on the way down, to dodge behind after lying full ; 
to dodge in the middle going down ; and to dodge on the 
lead before leading full. 

On any number of bells, above six, the intermediate 
dodgings are known by the different places in which they 
occur ; thus on eight bells, the. terms &quot; dodging in 3-4,&quot; and 
&quot; dodging in 5-6,&quot; up, or down, as the case may be, are used. 



Oxford, and Kent, Treble Bob. 13 



Every beginner, before he attempts Treble Bob, should 
learn to count the places into which he will fall, on the way 
from the lead to the back, and down again, and thus thoroughly 
acquaint himself with what is called a &quot; Treble Bob hunt.&quot; 

Since the treble strikes two blows in each place, it follows 
that a treble lead contains twice the number of changes to be 
found in a plain hunt lead on the same number of bells. 

In each treble lead of Oxford, and Kent, as well as in 
many other variations, there is one bell which has a special 
path. If the first lead of the diagram of Oxford, or Kent, be 
referred to, it will be seen that the second bell, after dodging 
with the treble, leads full, and makes second&apos;s place, alter- 
nately, until the treble returns to the lead. This bell is called 
the &quot; slow hunt,&quot; and is said to be &quot; in the hunt,&quot; or, more 
appropriately, as there is no hunting, &quot; in the slow.&quot; 

In the methods under notice, the working of the slow 
bell prevents others dodging on the lead, nevertheless, with 
this exception, and those caused by the place-making (which 
will be explained hereafter), the &quot; inside bells &quot; work in a 
similar way to the treble, and are then said to be doing 
oridnary &quot; Treble Bob work.&quot; 

The place-making, and the complications arising thereout, 
give the different degrees of intricacy to the various Treble 
Bob methods. 

OXFORD TREBLE BOB MINOR ; Diagram page 6. 

The simplicity of this method is due to the fact that 

places are made only when the treble is dodging on the lead 

before and after leading full. At these times the bells in 

the middle, instead of dodging, make, respectively, third&apos;s,

and fourth&apos;s places. The annexed changes represent the 
place-making at the end of the first treble lead 425163 
of Oxford T. B. Minor. The places made when 2 4 1 5 3 6 

the treble dodges, before leading full, are called 2 l 4 3 n f&gt;123465 
&quot; first third&apos;s&quot; and &quot; first fourth&apos;s&quot; and those 2 1 3 4 r&gt;&lt;&gt;made when the treble dodges, after leading full, 124365 
are called &quot; last third&apos;s&quot; and &quot; last fourth&apos;s&quot;* 142635 

This place-making reverses the direction in which 

1 4 6 2 S 5 

the bells are coursing ; that is, the bell that, in 412653 
hunting up, makes fourth&apos;s place, then goes down 421563 
again to the lead ; and, vice versa, the bell that, in 
going down, makes third&apos;s place, goes up again behind. 

By referring to the diagram the path of the second bell 
in a plain course may be examined and its duty carefully 
studied. The ringer of this bell, on going off, strikes one 
blow at the lead, and dodges back into second&apos;s place ; in 
other words, he dodges with the treble. He then, alternately, 
leads full, and makes second&apos;s place, until the treble returns 
to him ; he then dodges with her, and so completes the slow 
work. On leaving the slow work he makes fourth&apos;s place 
(last fourth&apos;s) and returns to the lead. He leads full, and 
then hunts up in the ordinary Treble Bob manner. After 
this he hunts down into third&apos;s, but here the ordinary Treble 
Bob work is broken by his being compelled the treble being 
at the lead to make third&apos;s place (first third&apos;s), and to hunt 
up behind. During the next two leads he does the ordinary , 
work of an inside bell in Treble Bob. This continues until 
he enters upon the fifth lead, and finds the treble in front 

* &quot; First,&quot; and &quot; last,&quot; as here used, refer to the work then beint,&apos; done by the 
treble in front, and not to the whole lead. 



Oxford Treble Bob Minor. 15 



when he reaches third&apos;s place (for this position of the treble 
he will have been prepared by noticing that he had previously 
passed her in 4-5), hence he is compelled to make this third&apos;s 
place (second third&apos;s) and return behind. He then does 
ordinary work until he leads full. Now he will pass the 
treble in 2-3, make fourth&apos;s place (first fourth&apos;s), and go 
down to lead, where he will dodge with the treble, and again 
take up the slow work. 

With regard to the course method for Oxford, it will be 
seen, by the diagram, that, after a bell has been in the slow, 
the other leads of the plain course may be divided, thus : 

In the opening of the lead, after doing the slow work, you 
make last fourth&apos;s and down, and, at the close, make first 
third&apos;s and up ; this may be termed a &apos;&apos; place-making lead.&quot; 
During the next two leads the ordinary Treble Bob work is 
unbroken, but the following (the fifth) is another place- 
making lead ; that is, at the opening, last third&apos;s, and, at the 
close, first fourth&apos;s are made ; after which you again take 
up the slow work, 

In the two intermediate leads (between the place-making 
leads) each ringer should notice that, in the first of them, he 
dodges with the treble in the middle, going up, and (in con- 
sequence of his work behind being the same as that of the 
treble in front) in the second of them, he again dodges with 
her in the middle on his way down. By observing how the 
work thus progresses a ringer gains confidence, and, after 
dodging with the treble as last mentioned on his way 
down, will be prepared to again meet her on his way up in 
4-5 ; and on going down again he will, as the diagram has 



16 Standard Metliods. 



proved, enter a place-making lead, and make third&apos;s place, 
etc. The foregoing directions may be condensed thus : 

Rules for the course method in Oxford T. B. Minor. 
1. Slow work. 

2. Last fourth&apos;s and down ; and later, first third&apos;s and up. 
3. Dodge, with the treble, in the middle, going up. 
4. Dodge, with the treble, in the middle, coming down ; and, on the 

way up, pass the treble in 4-5. 
5. Last third&apos;s and up ; and later, first fourth&apos;s, and into the slow. 

Although at first it may appear that the dodges in Treble 
Bob require special quickness of sight, this is not actually 
the case, because the selection of the bell to follow, is more 
easily made than in plain methods, as will now be shown. 

It will be seen that, when dodging, a bell strikes twice 
over another. Take for example, the treble in 3-4 going up 
in the first lead (diagram p. 6) The first blow in fourth&apos;s 
is over the sixth, the dodging blow into third&apos;s is over the last 
of the two bells below (the bell in the slow), and the next 
blow in fourth&apos;s is again over the sixth. When the treble is 
going behind, the work is still easier, because two blows are 
struck twice over the same two bells ; for example, the treble 
strikes her blows in fifth&apos;s, and sixth&apos;s, over the fifth, and 
fourth, and then dodges back over the fifth, and again follows 
the fourth. This applies to all the different dodging places 
and to all the bells, with the exception of certain alterations 
when the places are being made ; the bells behind at these 
points will then find that they strike over different bells when 
they strike their two blows in fifth&apos;s. 

When making fourth&apos;s place each bell strikes two con- 
secutive blows over the one making third&apos;s. When making 
third&apos;s place each learner should know which of the blows must 



Oxford Treble Bob Minor. 17 



be over the treble. My meaning is this : When the third&apos;s 
places are made, the treble and another are in front ; and 
when the first third&apos;s is made the treble is leading at hand, and 
dodging into second&apos;s place at back-stroke. The ringer who 
makes the first third&apos;s, should, therefore, guided by this 
knowledge, first strike after the other bell, and then after the 
treble. In like manner, when making last third&apos;s, he will, 
first, strike after the treble, and then after the other bell. 

A learner should, by a careful study of the path of a bell, 
be able to count each place into which he will fall throughout 
a course, before he attempts to ring it. Oxford is, however, 
so simple that if anyone forgets his exact place, in the course, 
he may always put himself right by remembering, on going 
into 3-4, that if the treble be in front he must make a place 
instead of dodging, and then retrace his steps. 

A bob (diagram p. 6) is made thus : The bell that 
makes the first third&apos;s then makes fourth&apos;s place and also 
the last third&apos;s, and hunts up. The bells behind make a 
double dodge in addition to the ordinary one. 

A bob does not alter the bells entering or leaving the 
slow work. The bell that &quot; makes the bob &quot; (the one that 
makes third&apos;s, fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s) has its work thrown on 
two leads ; that is, it omits the two &quot; intermediate leads,&quot; 
and therefore, at the end of the lead thus opened, it makes 
first fourth&apos;s and takes up the slow work. The bells behind, 
which makes the double dodge in addition to the ordinary one, 
have their work retarded a lead ; that is, during the next 
lead they repeat the work of the previous one. 

The proper time to call &quot; bob &quot; is when the treble strikes 
its first blow at the lead. The bell that has lain full behind 
can then count three dodging blows back into sixth&apos;s, and the 



18 Standard Methods. 

bell that has yet to lie full can count three into fifth&apos;s. Those 
behind should notice that the three blows struck into fifth&apos;s 
are, in turn, over the other &quot; inside &quot; bells. 

KENT TREBLE BOB MINOR ; Diagram page 7. 
The foregoing explanation of Oxford applies almost 
exactly to Kent. The only difference between the two is in 
the place-making. As before, places are made 

when the treble is dodging in front, but instead of 

231540 
one place being made by each of the bells in 3-4, 213456 

two are made, and the bells continue coursing in 123465 
their previous paths. Thus, as will be seen v in the 

annexed figures, when the treble dodges at the 142035 

lead before leading full, &quot; first third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s &quot; 412653 

are made by the bell hunting up, and &quot; first fourth&apos;s 146235 
and third&apos;s &quot; by the bell hunting down. When 

ft u J. Z 9 

the treble dodges after leading full &quot; last third&apos;s and 645132 
fourth&apos;s&quot; and &quot;last fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s&quot; are made. 

There is another point in which the place-making differs 
from Oxford, which must be carefully borne in mind. In 
Oxford the places are made at hand-and-back strokes, whereas 
in Kent they occur at back-and-hand. As the place-making, 
however, occurs at the same points in the plain course, the 
rules for Oxford are very easily adapted to Kent. 

Rules for the course method in Kent T. B. Minor. 

1. Slow work. 

2. Last third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s and up ; and first third&apos;s and 

fourth&apos;s and up. 

3. Dodge, with the treble, in the middle, going up. 
4. Dodge, with the treble, in the middle coming down ; and, on 

the way up, pass the treble in 4-5. 
5. Last fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s and down ; and first fourth&apos;s and 

third&apos;s and down into the slow work. 



Oxford, and Kent T. B. Minor, and Major. 19 

A bob (diagram p. 7) is made thus : The bell that 
makes the first third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s, then makes last fourth&apos;s 
and third&apos;s, and goes down to lead. This bell, therefore, 
strikes four consecutive blows in fourth&apos;s. The bells behind 
make a double dodge in addition to the ordinary one. 

A bob does not affect the bells entering, or leaving, the 
slow work, and the alterations caused in the work of the 
others, in the next lead, are, respectively, similar to those in 
Oxford. Ringers behind at a bob should remember that two 
of the blows struck in fifth&apos;s are over the same bell. 

TREBLE BOB MAJOR. 
OXFORD; Diagram pages 28-29. KENT; Diagram pages 30-31 . 

The only difference between Minor and Major in these 
two variations is the additional dodging place. Instead of 
having to dodge only in the middle, each bell has now 
additional dodges, in 3-4, and 5-6, on the way up, and down. 
In Major the place-making, as in Minor, is confined to 3-4 ; 
and it also occurs in the leads before and after that of the 
slow work. Two additional &quot; intermediate leads,&quot; in which 
the bells do ordinary Treble Bob work, make up the seven 
leads which are contained in a plain course. The duty in 
Major is, thus, to one who can ring Minor, very easily learnt, 
and the practical rope-sight soon acquired. 

Bobs (see diagrams) are made in each method, respectively, 
in the same way as in Minor ; the bells in 5-6 and 7-8 each 
dodging twice in addition to the ordinary dodge. 

Care must be taken, as in Minor, when in 5-6, either at a 
plain, or a Bob lead, to observe when place-making is going 
on in 3-4, so as to select the right bells to strike after for the 
blows in fifth&apos;s place. 



CHAP. IV. STHDMAN&apos;S PRINCIPLE. 



THIS is founded on the two different peals, or &quot;sixes&quot; that 
can be rung on three bells. These sixes, which are given 
below, with their hand-and-back strokes bracketed, should 
therefore be carefully studied. It will then be seen that, in 
the first, the bells lead full at hand-and-back, and, in the 
latter, at back-and-hand ; that is, the ringers &quot; come to lead 
at hand &quot; and &quot; come to lead at back-stroke.&quot; This leading is 
also known as &quot; leading full, right&quot; and &quot;&apos; leading full, wrong&quot;

Stedman&apos;s principle consists in the three bells in front 
ringing first one and then the other of these peals, whilst those 
above thirds are employing themselves in, what may be 
termed, a double dodging hunt, extending from 4-5, up, to 
the back, and down again to 4-5. It should be rung on odd 
numbers, as the bells behind then dodge, in pairs, in 4-5, 
6-7, and so on. Each time that the three bells in front com- 
plete a six, one of them leaves the front and, going up, enters 
the &quot; double dodging hunt,&quot; whilst die bell that has just 
completed the hunt comes down and joins the bells in front. 
In this way the bells are passed down into, and passed up 
out of, the sixes, and different changes are produced. 

The point, at which one six ends, and the next begins, 
forms the parting of the sixes ; and at these two changes the 
bell_behind lies full, wrong (back-and-hand). 



8tedman&gt;s Doubles. 



STEDMAN&apos;S DOUBLES ; Diagram page 40. 

(Dates from Stedman&apos;s time.) 

In pricking or ringing this system one naturally inquires 
how one should begin, and which six should be taken first. 

These questions Steadman settled, in a manner easily 
remembered, by making the &quot;go off &quot; similar to that of 
Grandsire. If the first three changes of Stedman&apos;s Doubles 
be compared with those of Grandsire (diagram, p. 1) they will 
be found to be the same. But on comparing the front bells 
with the &quot; go off &quot; of the sixes given on the previous page, 
headed &quot; quick &quot; and &quot; slow,&quot; no complete similarity will be 
found with either ; hence it may be inferred that a commence- 
ment has not been made with the first change of either six. 
If now it is noted that Stedman allowed the treble to run 
straight out into fourth&apos;s at the third change, it is plainly 
seen that this bell has just left a completed six. This is 
confirmed by noticing that, in this same change, the fourth 
bell enters into a new six. Hence a parting of the sixes has 
occurred between the second and third changes. It only 
remains, therefore, to discover whether the first and second 
changes form the end of a quick or a slow six. One way of 
doing this is by noticing the full leads, whether hand-and- 
back, as in a quick six, or back-and-hand, as in a slow one. 
Now all Grandsire ringers know that they bring their bells 
to lead at hand, hence the first and second changes of Sted- 
man&apos;s &quot; go off &quot; are the fifth and sixth of a quick six. 

We may now seeing that the treble has gone up into 
the double-dodging hunt, and the fourth has come down 
therefrom, giving us 32415 proceed to prick a slow six,

taking 324 as representing 132, the first change in the previous 
example. The result of this, together with the double 
dodging behind, gives us 34251, as the last change of this 
slow six. We are now, therefore, at another parting of the 
sixes, and, as the last was a slow six, this must be a quick 
one. We are compelled to pass the second out and let the 
fifth in, and also to change the bells at the lead, so that a 
whole pull right may be led ; this, therefore gives us 43521 as 
the opening of the quick six. If we now take 435 as represent- 
ing 213, the first change of the foregoing quick six example, 
and complete the six, as well as the double dodging, we 
shall get 34512 as the quick six end. If we now continue 
to prick slow and quick sixes, alternately, we shall find that 
at the fourth change after the tenth six end (counting the 
second change as the first six end) the bells come into rounds. 
This, then, is the plain course of Stedman&apos;s Doubles. 

An examination of the work of the bells behind shows 
that a bell, after leaving the sixes, dodges twice on the way 
up and then lies full, wrong (back-and-hand), after which it 
dodges twice on the way down and again enters the sixes. 

Now notice the paths of the two bells that first enter 
the sixes ; the first of these, the fourth, remains therein during 
five sixes ; whilst the next, the fifth, comes out again at once. 
A further inspection shows that this rapid work falls to the 
lot of the fourth the next time it enters the sixes ; and also 
that the fifth, at its next turn, stays in five sixes. A still 
further examination shows that in this plain course each bell, 
including the treble, has a path, which, if we take the fourth 
as an example, can be expressed thus, for Doubles : 



Stedmari&apos;s Doubles. 23 



In front, five sixes. 
Behind, two sixes. 
In front, one six. 
Behind, two sixes. 

It may be noted that, when the fourth is behind, at the 
plain course end, it only gets a chance of working in four 
changes ; the missing two, to complete the six, will be found 
in the &quot; go off.&quot; 

Noting that the work done by a bell behind is the same 
on both occasions, it becomes necessary to learn the paths in 
which bells work when in the sixes. In connection with 
these, and the different sixes, there are certain technical 
terms which I will first explain. When a six, such as the 
first complete one in the plain course, has a bell that goes in 
and stays in, it is called &quot; a slow six&quot; The bell that thus 
enters the sixes is said to &quot; go in slow&quot; and the work it does, 
during the five sixes in which it is in front, is called the 
&quot; slow work.&quot; On leaving the sixes it is said to &quot; come out 
slow.&quot; When a bell, such as the fifth in the second six, goes 
into the six, hunts straight down to lead, and then hunts up 
and passes out of the six, it is said to &quot; go in quick,&quot; and the 
&quot; come out quick,&quot; and the six (every alternate one) in which 
this occurs is called a &quot; quick six.&quot; 

If the path of a bell in the slow work be examined it 
will be seen that, after the middle of the third six, the work 
is merely reversed. Now this is noteworthy, and calls atten- 
tion to the fact that certain parts of the slow work are rela- 
tively alike. These portions are usually described thus : 

First whole turn. 

First half turn. 

Last half turn. 

Last whole turn.

Standard Methods. 



The skeleton diagram in which the hand-and-back 
strokes are coupled by the small brackets on the right shows 
the different portions of the work to which these name* 
refer. In learning this work care must be taken also to 
note at which stroke the different blows at the lead are 
struck, and how the third&apos;s are made, whether right or wrong. 

When a bell comes in slow 
it makes third&apos;s, right (hand-and 
back), works down and leads full, 



wrong (back-and-hand), permits First whole turn&lt;another bell to snap, and leads 

full, right ; this is called the 

&quot; first whole turn.&quot; Working up, 

making third&apos;s wrong ; working 

down, and snapping at hand, is F &apos; ret half turn 

comprised hi the &quot; first half turn&quot; 

This same again, with the third&quot; 

right, and the snap at back, is 

the &quot; last half turn&quot; Working up, I*** half turn 

making third&apos;s wrong ; working 

down and leading full, right ; 

permitting a snap, and leading

leave the sixes.

bells are reversed, another course, with another single, 
will complete the peal. 

In all Stedman ringing the mode of making bobs or 
singles is such that the work of the bells in the sixes is not 
interfered with ; in other words, the calls are always &quot; made &apos; r 
by the bells behind. 

At a single in Stedman&apos;s Doubles (diagram p. 40) the 
bell that comes out behind, after striking an odd blow there, 
makes fourth place, right, strikes another blow behind, and 
goes in again. Tke bell that has lain full, wrong, at the 
parting of the sixes, strikes an odd blow in fourth&apos;s, lies full 
right, strikes another blow in fourth&apos;s, and then lies full again, 
wrong, at the parting of the sixes, after which it commences 
to dodge in 4-5 down.* 

At a single the two bells behind, in this way, change 
places with one another. It must, therefore, be remembered 
on again entering the sixes that their work is reversed ; that 
is, if a bell has come out quick, it will go in quick, instead of r 
as usual, going in slow ; or, if out slow, then in slow. 

In dealing with Stedman&apos;s Triples instructions are given 
for ascertaining how a bell has to go in ; and as these 
explanations apply, partially, to Stedman on any number of 
bells, they should be here referred to (p. 27, etc.). 

* As certain of my readers may visit towers in which Stedman&apos;s 
Doubles are rung with a different single to the one I have just explained, 
I would here observe that several writers have fallen into error in their 
descriptions of the single on this number of bells. Although two bell* 
are reversed by the single they explain, it is not done in the customary 
and most symmetrical manner.

STEDMAN&apos;S TRIPLES ; Diagram p. 23. 
This method on seven differs from that on five by having 
two more dodging places. Thus, after double dodging in 
4-5-up, each bell double dodges in 6-7 up, lies full, wrong, 
double dodges in 6-7 and 4-5 down, and then goes in, quick, 
or slow, as required. As the work in the sixes is exactly the 
same as in Doubles, my previous explanations stand good. 

Bobs and singles in Stedman&apos;s Triples are made thus :

At a bob, the bell that has double dodged in 4-5 up 
makes fifth&apos;s place (wrong) at the parting of the sixes, and 
then double dodges in 4-5 down (this bell is said to make 
the bob) ; the bells behind continue dodging here through 
another six ; in other words, the five bells, in front, work as 
at a parting of the sixes in Doubles, whilst the two behind 
continue their dodging, and make in all five dodges. 

At a single, the five bells, in front, work the same as at a 
bob ; but, of the two behind, one lies the whole pull as if no 
call had been made, whilst the other bell, namely, the one 
that has double dodged in 6-7 down, makes sixth&apos;s place, and 
then double dodges in 6-7 up, previous to again lying full. 



Stedman&apos;s Triples. 27 



When a bell is undisturbed in its work behind, in other 
words, if a bell leaves the sixes, and hunts up and down the 
double dodging places, without a call being made, it re-enters 
the sjxes (quick or slow) in the contrary way to that in which 
it came out. If, however, calls are made, this re-entry may 
be altered, or not, according to circumstances, which we shall 
now set out. 

First, it must be distinctly understood that in Stedman 
ringing, on any number of bells, it is the three hindermost 
only that are disturbed by a call ; therefore, these only need 
their positions and work examining. 

Neither a bob nor a single upsets the contrariwise re- 
entry of the bell that makes fifth&apos;s place ; if such came out 
quick it will go in slow, and, vice versa, if out slow, then in 
quick. The reason for this will be clear to anyone who will 
notice that its work is altered by two sixes being missed out. 
Concerning the bells that have been dodging behind, and are 
forced to continue dodging ; as these are delayed there for 
an entire six, it follows that if, in the usual course, one of 
them would have again entered the sixes as a slow bell, it 
will, now, not enter until the following six, which will, of 
course, be a quick one ; and vice versa. Hence bells kept 
behind during a bob, or during any uneven number of con- 
secutive bobs, instead of going in contrariwise as usual, will 
re-enter the same way they came out. When, however, two 
successive or any even number of successive bobs are called, 
the bells behind go in contrariwise as usual. 

At a single, one bell lies the usual whole pull behind, 
and therefore goes in contrariwise. The bell that makes 
the sixth place continues behind during two extra sixes, and, 



28 Standard Method*. 



therefore, also goes in contrariwise ; and the bell making fifths 
(in bob fashion) goes in contrariwise. Hence a single causes 
no alteration in the quick and slow work, all re-enter the 
sixes in the usual way, that is, contrariwise. 

The foregoing rules necessitate a ringer&apos;s remembering 
how he came out quick or slow. When three successive 
bobs are called, it is probable that any one unacquainted 
with the composition of the touch, or peal, may be in doubt 
as to whether two, three, or four have been called. I will, 
therefore, explain means by which a ringer may assure 
himself, before entering the sixes, whether he has to go in 
quick or slow. These aids require a ringer to carefully watch 
his course bell. 

In ringing Stedman, especially on the higher numbers, 
the use of the course bell becomes a necessity, in order to find 
the bells to strike over when in the double dodging. Your 
course bell is that in the next higher dodging place, on the 
way up, and consequently in the next lower dodging place on 
the way down. Each bell, therefore, is preceded by its 
course bell on the way up, dodging behind with it previous to 
lying full, and is preceded by it on the way down. Therefore 
when any bell goes into 4-5 down, its course bell enters the 
sixes. 

Observe the bells behind in the first six in the plain 
course of triples ; they are the fifth and the seventh, and the 
latter is the course bell of the former. When the fifth dodges 
in 4-5 down, the seventh enters the sixes, and, going in slow, 
strikes two blows in third&apos;s place. The fifth, therefore, 
strikes its first blow in fourth&apos;s place over the seventh, and is 
therefore assured that his course bell has gone in slow ; 



Stedman&apos;s Triples. 29 



because, had it gone in quick, it would have struck in 
second&apos;s place when he first struck in fourth&apos;s. At the end 
of the six he (the ringer of the fifth bell) will, therefore, have 
to go in quick. Of this he will be still further assured when 
he strikes his last blow in fourth&apos;s, by its not being over his 
oourse bell, as it would have been were it coming out quick. 
The following rules are therefore to be depended on : 

If your first blow in fourth&apos;s place be over your course bell, it has 
gone in slow, and you will therefore go in quick. 

If you do not strike the first blow in fourth&apos;s place over your 
oourse bell, it has gone in quick, and you will therefore go in slow. 

The foregoing rules apply to the observation of the course 
bell at the earliest point for ascertaining how it has gone in. 
If, however, you are careless, and fail to notice the com- 
mencement of the six, you must watch your course bell at 
the six end, for : 

If you do not strike over your course bell for the last blow in 
fourth&apos;s, it is in slow, and you must go in quick. 

If you do so strike it, it is coming out quick, and you therefore 
go in slow. 

.In order to strike well, especially when ringing a heavy 
bell, it is necessary to know how you are to go in before com- 
pleting the last dodge in 4-5. For this reason I recommend 
each one to assure himself at the beginnitig of the six how he 
has to go in, allowing the six end to further confirm it, and in 
no case to leave the matter in doubt to the last blow. 

I would also draw attention to the fact that, when 
dodging in 4-5 up, or down, the three blows struck in fourth&apos;s 
place are over the three front bells respectively. In dodging 
in 4-5 down, this knowledge is of much advantage in connec- 
tion with the course bell observations. 

The foregoing course bell observations are applicable at 



30 Standard Method*. 



all times ; but each ringer must note when and where his 
course bell is altered by a call, and then carefully select his 
new one ; for instance, the bell that makes the bob courses 
down after the one with which she was dodging in 4-5 out 
when the call was given ; and this bob-making bell becomes 
the course bell of the one kept dodging behind after lying. 

In concluding these observations on Stedman&apos;s Principle, 
I may say that too much time can hardly be spent in the 
examination of a course in this method. Numerous observa- 
tions may be found which, in ringing, will prove of great 
assistance. A learner can thus study the different positions 
which the bells in the slow work occupy, and the relation that 
their work bears to his own, at any given point. He will thus 
learn to notice the partings of the sixes, and will further know 
whether the bell then coming in should be a quick or slow 
one. By this means he may save a peal if, when the time 
comes, he can speak with confidence and accuracy. 

With a view to directing a learner&apos;s observations into a 
systematic channel, the following diagrams have been drawn 
up : In this first, you are supposed to be ringing the bell 
marked X, and to have for your course bell one marked Q. 
The diagram begins with the six in while you are dodging 
in 4-5 down, and it is taken for granted that you here know 
that, if you at once strike over your course bell, it has gone 
in slow. However, as you do not thus strike her you are 
assured that you have to go in slow, and at once make ob- 
servations accordingly, remembering that you will meet her 
coming out at the six end. All quick bells are represented by Q. 

The description of each line of these diagrams is given 
(as far as possible), side by side. 



Stedman&apos;s Triples. 31 



Being now in 4-5, your first blow B A Q X 

in fourth&apos;s is over a slow bell marked A, B Q A X 

(doing its last whole turn), whilst your next Q B A X 

in fourth&apos;s is over another slow bell B Q A B X 

(which is doing its first half turn), and A Q B X 

your last over your quick course bell Q A B Q X

take A (about to make his &quot; thirds and out &quot;) A X B 

and dismiss him from your mind, and X A B 

then lead full, wrong, looking out for X B A

lead full right. This opens a quick six, ~X B Q A 

and ends your first whole turn. X Q B 

Q, a quick bell, now leads and B Q X B 

follows (in quick-six-end style) whilst you Q B X

from B, and complete your first half turn. x B C Q

which you made your &quot; thirds and out,&quot; first Q C D X 

C and then D, and this ends your dealings C Q D X 

with the bells in front. C D Q X 



32 Standard Method*. 



In looking over this diagram there is much for a learner 
to note. For instance, you make five third&apos;s places ; one as 
you enter, one as you leave, and one in the exact centre of 
your slow work, and these three, falling in slow sixes, are 
made right (that is hand-and-back) ; the other two fall in 
the intermediate quick sixes, and therefore come wrong (back- 
and-hand). Quick bells lead full in quick sixes, of course, 
and therefore lead right, and their leads are preceded and 
followed by full leads, right, by bells doing whole-turn work. 
The slow sixes begin and end with snaps, and all other leads 
are full, wrong. 

It is, again, worth while noticing with what regularity 
(leads excepted) you work with the others in front ; for 
instance, A and B are struck in 4-5 down : again, over 
A and B third&apos;s are made ; A is then taken and B allowed 
to snap, and so you get through your first whole turn. The 
quick six is got through by taking, twice, the quick bell 
and B (Q&amp;B and Q&amp;B), and this brings you to the end of 
your first hah* turn. Your last half turn (or, in other words, 
the work of your central six, which is a slow one), may be 
summed up thus : Take B and C, twice ( B&amp;C and B&amp;C), 
C being the new slow bell. The quick six commencing your 
last whole turn may be put this : Take C and Q twice 
(C&amp;Q and C&amp;Q) ; afterwards let C snap, and take D (the 
last of the slow bells), make third&apos;s over C and D, and again 
strike C and D when dodging in 4-5 out. 

Referring to the four snap leads ; the first snapped from 
you is by a bell B doing its last half turn ; the second, snapped 
by you is from the same bell now doing its last whole turn ; 
the third, snapped by you, when doing your last half turn, 



Stedman&apos;s Triples. 33 



is from a bell C doing its first whole turn ; and the fourth 
and last, snapped from you when doing your last whole 
turn, is by the same bell C now doing its first half turn. 
Thus you give and take from B, and then take and give to C. 

In this second diagram, which begins and ends with the 
double dodging in 4-5, you are supposed to be ringing the bell 
marked Q, and to have been coursing B down. 

If, in stepping down into 4-5, you immediately strike 
over your course bell, you know that he has gone in slow, 
and that you will htve to go in quick. 

Here you do so strike her ; hence your dealings with the 
bells in front are as follows :

34 Standard Methods. 



the first after leaving them is over another slow bell S. Now, 
the first S may be taken as &quot; sandwiched &quot; between A and A, 
with outside crusts formed by the course bell B and B. The 
second S is likewise &quot; sandwiched,&quot; but between the course 
bell B and B, with the outsides formed by A and A. It is as 
well to distinguish your course bell as your course bell, and 
to think of A as standing for another. Then the whole of 
your work lies with your course bell and another, with the 
exception only of the slow bells you allow to pass out and in. 

There is another observation, for the introduction of 
\ hich an apology is almost necessary, as it is undoubtedly 
one which should never be used except as a last resource, 
since no one using it can strike well. It is this : On going 
into the sixes, and when striking your first blow (in third&apos;s) 
notice the two bells, say B and A in front (see previous dia- 
grams). Having struck over the last of these two, say A, 
you proceed regardless of consequences to strike your 
next blow over the other bell, B. If B proves to have been 
leading full, your second blow will have been in second&apos;s 
place (or an apology for it), and you are a quick bell. If, 
however, whilst striking after B you find yourself kept back 
in third&apos;s, by A stepping in front of B, you are a slow bell. 

One more remark before closing this chapter. If ever, 
in dodging in 4-5 up, after leaving the sixes, you meet with 
a wavering companion whose face tells you he is in doubt, 
direct him into the sixes in the same way you passed through 
them. This hint is often most opportune, more especially if 
the bells are having a rough time of it in front ; it is easily 
given, and a glance at the diagram will fix it on your mind. 

(For further information see &quot; Stedman &quot; of this Series.) 



CHAP. V. PLAIN METHODS ON FIVE BELLS. 



Diagram page 1. 

IN the following methods the treble has a plain hunting 
course. Before attempting to learn the duty of a bell, the 
different points at which places are made should be con- 
sidered. I shall therefore first call attention to the place- 
making, and then specify the details of the duty. The reader 
must understand that I shall not treat the whole pulls at the 
lead, or at the back, as places. For the sake of brevity, I 
shall use the words &quot; lead &quot; and &quot; lie&quot; instead of lead a whole 
pull, or lie a whole pull behind ; and when &quot; snaps &quot; (single 
&quot; run-a-way &quot; blows) occur, I shall specially mention them. 

ST. SIMON&apos;S DOUBLES. 

(Dates from Stedman&apos;s time, substantially, as &quot; Church 
Doubles&quot;) 

When the treble is above third&apos;s, or behind, as it is 
called (in other words, after the treble hunts up from third&apos;s 
place, until it returns there, on the way down), third&apos;s places 
are made ; when the treble leads, second&apos;s place is made. 

The two third&apos;s places that are made, when the treble is 
behind, cause the bells in front to make a double dodge. 
When the treble leads, the bells work as in Plain Bob. Each 
bell, after leaving the lead, does not return there until it has 
completed the intermediate duty of the course. This is 
expressed by saying that the duty is &quot; continuous.&quot; In these 
cases it is best to learn the duty in a single lesson, thus : 
St. Simon&apos;s Doubles. Duty of a bell after making second&apos;s place . 

Lead and double dodge after ; and dodge in 3-4 up. 

Lie ; third&apos;s and up to lie four blows ; third&apos;s and up to lie. 

Dodge in 3-4 down ; double dodge before leading ; and make 
second&apos;s place. 



36 Standard Methods. 



This lesson may be shortened if the work at the lead be 
treated as a distinct part. Suppose we class it as &quot; work at 
the lead &quot; ; we can then learn the duty of a bell after leaving 
the lead, and end the lesson with &quot; work at the lead,&quot; which 
latter would run thus : Double dodge before leading, second&apos;s 
place, lead and double dodge after. 

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place, instead of second&apos;s place, 
is made. The work of the bell that lies four blows behind is 
not altered ; that of the others is altered as follows :

NEW DOUBLES. 

(Dates from Stedman&apos;s time.) 

The place-making is the same as in St. Simon&apos;s Doubles 
when the treble is behind, but third&apos;s places are also made 
when the treble is in front, as well as second&apos;s place. The 
duty may be learnt in one continuous lesson as before. 

The work is front is exactly the same at St. Simon&apos;s. 
On leaving this you make third&apos;s place, instead of dodging in 
3-4. On arriving at the back you &quot; snap &quot; there, at hand 
stroke, and make another third&apos;s place. You then hunt up 
and lie, wrong (back-and-hand stroke) ; lie, right ; and again 
lie, wrong ; permitting snaps between. The treble then turns 
you from behind and you make third&apos;s place, returning to 
snap another blow behind, this time at back stroke. Another

third&apos;s place is made, in hunting down to lead, where you 
take up the front work. This duty may be tabulated thus : 

New Doubles. Duty of a bell after leaving the work in front. 

Third&apos;s place, snap behind at hand, third&apos;s place and up. 

Lie, wrong ; lie, right ; and lie, wrong (permitting snaps between). 

Third&apos;s place, snap behind at back-stroke, third&apos;s place, and down 
to the work in front. 

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place, instead of second&apos;s place, 
is made ; the work of the bell behind is not altered ; that of 
the others is altered as follows : 

New Doubles. A Bob alters the work of the bells thus : 

A bell, that has just snapped at back-stroke, makes fourth&apos;s 
place, snaps at hand and commences the work behind again. 

A bell, that would have made second&apos;s place, makes third&apos;s 
place, and commences the work iii front again. 

A bell, that has just made third&apos;s after completing the work in 
front, goes down again, and takes up the remainder of the front works 

STEDMAN&apos;S SLOW COURSE.* 

(First given in the &quot; Clavis&quot; 1788, in Minor form ; adapted 
to Doubles by Shipway, 1816). 

In this the bells make places when the treble is behind 
them. For this reason, when hunting up, the path of each 
bell, after passing the treble, is always a plain hunt until the 
treble is again taken on the way down. Two third&apos;s places 
are made when the treble is behind ; and, when she is lying- 
there, second&apos;s place is also made. This causes the work of 
a bell in front (see the first lead) to be the reverse of that 
behind in New Doubles. The duty is not continuous. Each 
bell arrives twice at the lead, and on each occasion does

irregular. 



Stantlnnl Methods. 



diflferent work ; and twice at the back, when, however, the 
same work is done. The different work in front may be 
classed as the &quot; long &quot; and &quot; short &quot; work ; and as these are 
separated by the &quot; work behind&quot; the whole may be tabulated 
thus : 

Long work in front. Lead, right ; lead, wrong ; lead, right 
(l&gt;ermitting snaps between) ; and hunt up. 

Work behind. Lie ; third&apos;s place ; lie and down. 

Short work in front. Snap at hand ; make second&apos;s place, wrong ; 
miap at back ; and hunt up. 

This work may now be summarised, so as to give the 
duty in a course as follows : 

Stedman&apos;s Slow Course. Duty of a bell after turning the treble 
from the lead. 

Long work in front, first work behind. 
Short work in front, second work behind. 

It is always easy to tell on arriving at the front which 
work has to be done ; because it is only when a bell turns the 
treble from the lead that the long work has to be done. 

Bob. Unfortunately a bob has to be made 21453 
in a very &quot; lop-sided &quot; way ; first third&apos;s only, 
as annexed, is made ; the bell that has just com- 41523 
pleted the long duty in front remains unaltered ; 45132 
the others are altered as follows : 

Stedmari&apos;s Slow Course. A bob alters the work of the bells thus : 

A bell, that lias done the short work in front, makes third&apos;s and 
goes down to the long work in front. 

A bell, that is finishing the first work behind, instead of lying, 
dodges in 4-5, and then commences the second work behind. 

A bell, that has just completed the second duty behind, dodges 
in 4-5, and hunts down to the short work in front. 



Cartels Principle. 39 



CARTER&apos;S PRINCIPLE. 
DOUBLES, ON CARTER&apos;S PRINCIPLE. (Diagram page 41) t 

The introduction of another diagram for five-bell ringers, 
which Mr. John Carter worked out in 1893, calls for no apology, 
as it is sure to be appreciated by those for whom it is intended, 
namely, the experts. 

It will, perhaps, not prove quite as difficult as it looks : 
for, if the diagram be examined, the points marked (*) will 
be seen to be centres, round which the paths of the bells 
reverse themselves. 

The duty in Doubles may be described thus : 

Front work. 

First whole-turn, at the back. 

Snapping work, in the order of, Front, Back, and Front. 

Second whole-turn, at the back. 

The front work comprises a dodge behind in 4-5, a quick 
run in, a double dodge on the lead, three full leads separated 
by two snaps, another double dodge, and a quick run out 
to the dodge behind in 4-5. 

In proceeding to a snap, and in retiring from one, whether 
at the lead or at the back, a third&apos;s place is invariably made. 

If these specified points be studied, and then carefully 
connected in the learner&apos;s mind by aid of the diagram, a 
plain course should present no difficulty with five good men. 

Single. Two bells change places at a single, namely : 

(a) The bell that (after its snapping work) has done its whole- 
turn behind, proceeds to make fourth&apos;s place, and goes behind again 
for another whole-turn, previous to recommencing its snapping work. 

(6) The bell that, after its front work, has run out quick, lies 
full, and runs in quick again to the front. 

Triples. In triples, etc., Bobs and Singles are made 
by the three bells behind, as in Stedman, across the lines 



40 Standard Methods. 



of division, be they &quot; Fours &quot; or &quot; Eights.&quot; The five-bell 
work in front remains the same, except so far as it is cut in 
two by bells going out to, and coming in from, the dodging 
work in 6-7. A few rows of Triples are annexed to make this 
plain. If the diagram of Doubles be examined with Triples 
in view, it will be seen that (1) the two paths set out in the 
two columns are both shown commenicng and ending with a 
whole pull behind, and (2) that this whole pull is situated 
across a dividing line ; hence, here, in triples, etc., on two 
occasions a bell leaves the five bell work, and for 1234567 
two divisions (for triples) joins in dodging 2143657 

work behind. For example : 1246375 

. . . 1423657 
A bell that is running out, quick, dodges in 4-o 

(as in Doubles), and, passing out, triple dodges in 6-7 ; 

lies, and makes a solitary dodge after. It then dodges 1462735 

in 4-5 down and makes fifth&apos;s (a remant of the whole- 1647253 

turn behind in Doubles), and, as it is now about to 6142735 

take up its snapping work, it also makes third&apos;s on the 1624753 

way down to snap at the lead. 6127435 

Alternately, when the same, or any other, bell 1672453 

leaves the snapping work, it makes fifth&apos;s, dodges in 6174286 

4-5, and dodges (once) in 6-7, before lying ; after which 6712453 

it makes a triple dodge, goes down into 4-5, where it 7621543 

dodges, and runs in quick to begin the front work again. 6725134 

At first it might appear difficult to know 6271543 

2675134 
whether to go down for front-work or for snap- 

62573 14 

ping- work, but the uneven dodging behind settles G 5 2 3 ~ 4 l 

this ; and it ought not to be difficult for the bell 5627314 

that is lying behind to keep the new comer right, 6572341 
and so on. Bobs and singles will, of course, 

o o o 7 * 1 

increase the necessity of those behind keeping n r, 3 2 7 1 4 
a sharp look-out, but what else does the keen 5367241 
ringer relish ? 3576421 



Plain Methods on Six Bells. 41 

Mr. Carter points out that what is here termed the 
snapping-work might equally be called the back-slow, as the 
bulk of the work is really at the back, the bell in question 
merely slipping down on two occasions &quot; to see that the 
front work is all right.&quot; This is happily expressed, as trouble 
will certainly occur if a proper reception be not extended to 
the visitor ! 



CHAP. VI PLAIN METHODS ON SIX BELLS. 



BEFORE proceeding to detailed descriptions, it is necessary to 
make a few remarks on the way in which the bobs and singles 
are made in these examples, as in some cases the mode of 
making the single hitherto adopted is open to objection. 

In Double Court, for instance (diagram p. 3), at a plain 
lead sixth&apos;s place, and at a bob lead fourth&apos;s place, is made. 
Now Stedman, in his Campanalogia, published in 1677, and 
all subsequent writers, shew the singles to be made by the 
bells lying still in second&apos;s, third&apos;s, and sixth&apos;s places ; the 
object being, I suppose, to have the singles at the half-peal 
ends, without reversing the tenors. This plan, however, 
necessitates the making of two places such as have no 
counterpart at either plain or bob leads. My opinion is that 
two of the places made should be those made at plain and bob 
leads, leaving one new place only to be arranged. Thus one 
bell will make a plain lead place, one a bob place, and one 
the place between these two, leaving the two others unaltered 
in their plain lead work. In Double Court, therefore, as 



42 Standard Methods. 



sixth&apos;s place is made at a plain lead, and fourth&apos;s place at a 
bob, I shew the single to be made in fourth&apos;s, fifth&apos;s, and 
sixth&apos;s places ; and in this way I have also treated College 
Single (diagram p. 4). Of course, in peals, in these methods, 
it will be necessary to have the singles at some place other 
than the half -peal ends, so that the tenors may not be 
reversed. 

ST. CLEMENT&apos;S BOB Diagram p. 2 (Appears in 1702, 
except that fourth&apos;s place, instead of second&apos;s, UXLS made, the 
resulting lead-ends being irregular). 

In this method third&apos;s places are made whenever the 
treble is above that place ; whilst, when she is at the lead, 
second&apos;s place is made, and the other bells dodge as in Plain 
Bob ; in fact, the method would seem to be an extension of 
St. Simon&apos;s Doubles. 

St. Clement&apos;s. Duty of each bell after making second&apos;s place. 

1. Lead, triple dodge after, and dodge in 3-4 up. 

2. Lie, third&apos;s, pass treble in 3-4, and dodge behind (before lying). 

3. Lie, third&apos;s, pass treble in 4-5, lie and dodge after. 

4. Third&apos;s, pass treble in 5-6, lie, dodge in 3-4 down, and make 

5. triple dodge before leading. 

Bob. The Bob is that of Bob Minor, the alterations of 
duty being as follows : 

The bell that would have dodged in 3-4 out, makes fourth&apos;s, 
and goes down again to the triple dodge. 

The bell that would have made second&apos;s runs out quick ; after- 
wards making third&apos;s, and passing the treble in 3-4. 

The bell that would have dodged in 3-4 down, runs in quick, 
and leads, prior to its triple dodge. 



Double Court. 43 



Single. The Single is that of Bob Minor. At a single, 
second&apos;s place is made as at a plain lead ; fourth&apos;s place, 
as at a bob ; and third&apos;s place is made by the bell that would 
otherwise have dodged in 3-4 down, after which it returns 
behind, and begins the third&apos;s places again. 

DOUBLE COURT : Diagram page 3. 

(Dates from Stedman&apos;s time.) 

In this, third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s places are made, before the 
treble leads ; and fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s places, after it has led. 
A bell, after making either set of places, continues in the 
direction in which it was previously hunting. 

Special attention must be directed to the work of the 
bells which come to the front, or go behind, between the 
visits of the treble. This work, both in front and behind, is 
confined to three bells. One bell, turning the treble away, 
leads and then dodges ; one dodges both before and after 
leading ; and the other dodges and then leads, being turned 
away by the treble. In a similar manner three bells work 
behind. Were it necessary to describe the different parts of 
the work, I should refer to the bells which dodge both before 
and after leading, and lying, as those doing the &quot; full work &quot; ; 
but the work to be done in front and behind, can be so 
readily ascertained by observing the treble, that further 
terms are needless. For instance, if, on going down to lead, 
you do not turn the treble away, you dodge and then lead, after 
which, if the treble does not turn you away, you make another 
dodge ; in other words, always dodge before and after leading, 
if the treble does not prevent you. By observing the treble 
behind in the same way the duty there may be ascertained. 



44 Standard Methods. 



After obtaining a thorough knowledge of the work in 
front, and behind, the remaining duty in the course, which 
consists of the place-making, will be found very simple. 
Except when place making, each bell hunts straight up and 
down. The bells turned from the lead, or from behind, by the 
treble, are those which have to make the places. Thus, if the 
treble turns you from the front, you make fourth&apos;s, and 
third&apos;s, on the way up ; and if the treble turns you from 
behind, you make third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s on the way down. 
This method is in fact so simple that each can ascertain his 
work as the ringing proceeds ; I shall not therefore give any 
rules for the order in which the different duties occur, as 
these are clearly shown by the diagram. 

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place, instead of sixth&apos;s place, 
is made ; the bells in front (the place-making bells) work as 
at a plain lead ; and the bells behind make a triple (three- 
pull) dodge, that is, they dodge until the treble comes up 
and separates them. The alterations may be summarised 
thus : 

A bell, that has just completed the full work in front (and that 
passes the treble in 2-3), makes fourth&apos;s place, and goes down again. 

A bell, that turns the treble from behind, makes a triple dodge 
after lying. 

A bell, that passes the treble in 4-5, makes a triple dodge before 
lying. 

Single (see page 41). At a single, fourth&apos;s, fifth&apos;s, and 
sixth&apos;s places are made. The bell that turns the treble from 
behind lies and dodges ; makes fifth&apos;s place ; and then dodges 
and lies again. This bell is turned from behind by the treble, 
and consequently becomes a place-making bell. 



Double Oxford. 45 



DOUBLE OXFORD ; Diagram page 3. 

(Dates from Stedman&apos;s time.) 

The places made are the same as in Double Court, Avith 
the addition of second&apos;s and fifth&apos;s, made respectively when 
the treble leads, and lies. These additional places compel a 
bell to complete the work in front, or behind, at one visit ; 
that is, each bell on coming to the front, or on going behind, 
makes a triple dodge ; leads, or lies ; makes second&apos;s, or 
fifth&apos;s place, as the case may be ; then leads, or lies, and then 
makes another triple dodge. The other places are made by 
.the bells as they pass to and from the lead. Thus, on the 
way up, fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s are made, and on the way down, 
third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s ; each bell also dodges in 3-4, both before 
and after making these places. The work, which is con- 
tinuous, can therefore be classified thus : 

Double Oxford. Duty of each bell in a plain course. 

Work in front. Place-making going up. 
Work behind. Place-making coming down. 

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place, instead of second&apos;s, is 
made ; the bells behind (those making the triple dodge) work 
as at a plain lead ; the others are altered as follows : 

A bell, that has just completed the work in front, makes fourth&apos;s 
place, at once, and then hunts down and begins the work in front 
again. 

A bell, that would have made second&apos;s place, runs out, makes 
fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s, and so on, up to the back. 

A bell, after making fourth&apos;s, on the way down, runs in, turns 
the treble from the lead, and completes the remainder of the work in 
front. 



46 Standard Methods. 



Single. At a single, second&apos;s, third&apos;s, and fourth&apos;s places 
are made. The bell that has just made fourth&apos;s place on the 
way down, makes third&apos;s place ; then fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s 
places, and so on, up to the back. 



COLLEGE SINGLE REVERSE ; Diagram page 4. 
(Dates from Stedmari&apos;s time, substantially, as College, Little Bob). 

The principle of this method consists in each one making 
third&apos;s place, on his way down, when the treble is above 
him. This causes you, when in front, to make a triple dodge 
after, or before, leading. It is practically St. Clements&apos; Bob, 
with sixth&apos;s place made when the treble leads, instead of 
second&apos;s. 

The simplest way to learn the work is by noticing that, 
if, in hunting down, you meet the treble when she is above 
third&apos;s, you make third&apos;s place and return behind. The bell 
that cuts the treble in 3-2 makes a triple dodge, before leading, 
and the bell that turns the treble from the lead makes a 
triple dodge after leading. 

Bob. A bob is made, as in Double Court, by making 
fourth&apos;s instead of sixth&apos;s place. 

The bell that has left the front, with a triple dodge, makes fourth&apos;s 
place, and goes down to another triple dodge. 

The bell that passes the treble in 3-4 (after third&apos;s) dodges before 
lying. 

The bell that passes the treble in 4-5 (after third&apos;s) dodges after 
lying- 



Canterbury Pleasure. 47 



Single. At a single the &quot; bob bell &quot; does not deviate 
from its work. The bell that passes the treble in 4-5 makes 
fifth&apos;s place (that is &quot; makes the single &quot;), and returns behind. 
The bell that passes the treble in 3-4 behaves as at a plain 
lead, that is, lies behind. 

CANTERBURY PLEASURE ; Diagram page 4. 

In this method, which is believed to be a comparatively 
modern one, &quot; Imperial &quot; places are made when the treble 
is behind by the working bells passing through third&apos;s 
and fourth&apos;s. At the treble&apos;s lead sixth&apos;s place is made, 
and fifth&apos;s when she lies behind. 

Duty of a bell after its work behind with the treble. 

1. Lead, third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s, wrong, on the way out, and lie. 
2. Cut the treble in 3-2, and lead and dodge, pass her in 3-4, 

and lie. 
3. Cut the treble in 4-3 and dodge before leading, passing her 

in 2-3 on the way out. 
4. After lying, make third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s (wrong), lead, and 

pass the treble in 2-3. 
5. Make fifth&apos;s between your whole pulls behind. 

Bob. The bob is made as in Double Court. 

The bell that passes the treble in 2-3 makes the bob, that is, 
makes fourth&apos;s, and returns to lead and dodge. 

The bells that, respectively, pass the treble in 4-5 and 3-4 dodge 
behind after and be/ore lying. 

Single. The bell that &quot; makes the single &quot; is that 
which makes the places on the way out, and lies, she then 
makes fifth&apos;s, lies, and again makes the places on the way 
down. 



48 Standard Methods. 



DOUBLE BOB ; Diagram page 5. 

(Dates from Stedman&apos;s time.) 

In this, fifth&apos;s place is made when the treble lies, as well 
as second&apos;s place when she leads. Besides the usual Plain 
Bob work, there is, therefore, dodging in 1-2, and 3-4, when 
the treble is behind. 

The simplest way to learn this method will be to take 
the extra duty in the order in which it occurs after the 
ordinary Plain Bob work when the treble is at the lead. 
It may be tabulated thus, in two columns : 

Double Bob. Duty of each bell in a plain course. 
1-2. Second&apos;s place . . . .Dodge in 3-4 up. 
4-5. Dodge in 5-6 down . . Dodge before leading. 
2-3. Dodge in 3-4 up .... Make fifth&apos;s place. 
5-6. Dodge in 3-4 down . . Dodge after leading. 
3-4. Dodge in 5-6 up .... Dodge in 3-4 down. 

In these rules no mention is made of the ordinary detail 
duty, which, however, must be thoroughly understood. For 
instance, after passing the treble in 2-3, you dodge in 3-4 up, 
and lie ; the treble then turns you from behind, so you make 
fifth&apos;s place, and go behind again. This causes you to pass 
the treble in 5-6 ; and makes you dodge in 3-4 down ; and 
so on. 

Bobs and Singles. The bobs and singles are made when 
the treble leads, and are the same as those in Plain Bob. 



CHAP. VII TREBLE BOB METHODS OX 
SIX BELLS. 

NOTES ON OLD OXFORD AND OTHER TREBLE BOB METHODS. 

As the beginner is now leaving behind him the grand 
simplicity of Oxford and Kent, it cannot but be instructive 
to survey one or two of the main features of the place-making 
of the next seven peals, some of which, for intricacy, run the 
Surprise methods a very near race. 

College. Exercise, p. 11, has a leading feature that re- 
quires a bell leaving either the front or the back, except 
when the treble is in the middle to make the far and near 
places with a dodge inserted between them, which may be 
shortly set out thus : &quot; far (dodge) near &quot; after which 
the bell goes forward. 

Westminster, p. 10, has a somewhat similar feature, 
for, on leaving the slow, &quot; far (dodge) near &quot; opens the 
place-making, linked together with &quot; far (dodge treble) 
near,&quot; with an added dodge, after which the bell goes for- 
ward. On the way to the front this work is, of course, taken 
in a reverse order, which, whilst calling for attention, is not 
difficult, especially if it be remembered that the added dodge 
comes first. 

Tulip, p. 12, demands a simple re-arrangement, viz. : 
&quot;far near (dodge treble) &quot; and forward ; and, reversely, 
on the way down (dodge treble) far near. 

Old Oxford, and College Bob IV., pp. 8 and 9, both have 
a bell that runs out of the slow into a 3-4 dodge with the 
treble, so we get &quot; (dodge treble) -far- near,&quot;&amp;&apos; ; (dodge)- 
far &quot; and (back to the) &quot; near &quot; front. And, later &apos; ; far- 
(dodge)-near,&quot;&amp;&quot; far- (dodge treble),&quot; and (back to the) 
&quot; near &quot; front (slow work). 



60 Standard Methods. 



Southivark, p. 13, has a place -that may be remembered 
as &quot; (dodge treble)-fourth&apos;s &quot; ; and this, on the way down, 
becomes &quot; fourth&apos;s- (dodge treble).&quot; 

Kentish Delight, p, 14, has a place that may be written 
thus : &quot; third&apos;s- (dodge treble),&quot; and on the way down 
&quot; (dodge treble) -third&apos;s.&quot; 

The best possible plan for obtaining a full grasp of 
these, and other places whether solitary or linked together 
is to study and trace the various places on the diagrams, 
in their relationship to the treble&apos;s path, and thus get a 
full knowledge of the obstructions places which compel 
you to take the work in any particular order, and, further, 
learn why you reverse that order on other occasions. The 
double stars (**) inserted in the &quot; Duty of a Bell,&quot; denote, 
in all cases, the central turning-point where the path of 
the bell reverses itself. 

If a learner will but study the places in which, and by 
which, he has to steer his course, he will soon discover a 
pathway infinitely superior to any mere string of words, 
however accurate they may be, and however valuable to the 
beginner. 

The first five methods have all their whole-pulls in 
&quot;right&quot; order (hand-and-back), but in Southwark and 
Kentish Delight especially in the latter there will be 
found a good sprinkling of whole pulls &quot; wrong.&quot; 

OLD OXFORD TREBLE BOB (Modernised). 
The first half lead of this dates back to 1677, when it 
was known as Oxford Triple Bob ; and as Woodbine it was 
a familiar friend in the old edition of this work. The lead- 
ends, however, proved themselves irregular, and to secure

those of Plain Bob, fifth&apos;s place is now made with the treble 
behind, and second&apos;s with her in front. 

The &quot; go off &quot; places are those of Oxford, followed by 
another fourth&apos;s (Delight) place in the next rows ; the com- 
bined effect being curious : The fifth&apos;s place forces a triple 
dodge in the middle, as well as a dodge at the lead, which 
latter divides the slow work between two bells. &quot; The fourth&apos;s 
(Delight) place compels together with second&apos;s at the treble 
lead a seven pull dodge behind, and as the fifth&apos;s place 
detains a bell behind, the duty of a bell is &quot; continuous.&quot; 

Old Oxford. Duly of a bell in a plain course.

reverse order, and lie next the treble. 

Bob. At a bob fourth&apos;s place is made instead of second&apos;s : 

The (treble -dodged) place-making bell continues to make far- 
near-far, etc., until the treble rejoins it. 

The bell that has commenced the slow makes fourth&apos;s and down 
see Column II. for its after proceedings. 

The bell that has passed the treble in 2-3 makes fourth&apos;s, and 
down into the slow. 

COLLEGE BOB, IV., dates from 1677. 

The &quot; go off,&quot; the fourth&apos;s (Delight) place, and the 

first eight rows, are the same as Old Oxford ; but when the 

treble dodges behind adjacent third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s are made. 

Again, we have second&apos;s, and fifth&apos;s, next the treble. As the

alterations in the place- making are produced when the 
treble is behind, it will not be surprising to note that the 
columns of this and the last diagram are the same at the 
head and foot.

Hob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place, instead of second&apos;s, is

just described. 

WESTMINSTER BOB ; Diagram page 10. 
The first half of the treble lead dates from 1677, as 
College Bob V.; but fifth&apos;s was then made, and an irregular 
lead-end resulted. In 1702, third&apos;s place, with the treble 
behind, was introduced, and Plain- bob lead-ends were then 
secured. It is noteworthy that here, from Stedman&apos;s time, 
is handed down to us a method which has places made not 
only at the usual treble-bob places, but also at the cross- 
sections, as the treble passes through 2-3 and 4-5, as well as 
when she leads and lies, and some critics, short-sighted 
historically, have innocently imagined that this full array 
of places constitutes a &apos;&quot; Surprise Peal &quot; ! Space is too 
valuable to waste on arguments, especially when it is well

known that not until nearly 100 years after did the word 
&quot; Surprise &quot; appear in connection with a method in any 
printed book, and then only with such a fine example as Cam- 
bridge, which, being a genuine Surprise, may be taken as a 
standard.! 

The &quot;go off &quot; and the first seven rows are the same as 
Old Oxford, but the three central third&apos;s places (namely 
those when the treble, and the bells that work with her, lie 
behind) quite alter the aspect of the work, which again 
provides a &quot; continuous &quot; path.

i Webtuiiustei&apos;, notwithstanding its complete nunibei: of places, excludes 
itself from tl;e &quot; Surprise &quot; family by its excellence as an example of &quot; Stagnation 
Bob,&quot; a term coined by the Editor to express a method, full of places, peculiar to 
the early days of change-ringing. In these pairs of bells remained too long in one 
locality and blocked the way; too long in front, too long in the middle, or too 
long behind. . It will be noticed, in thi^ connection, tbat in Westminster a bell 
requires the whole plain course in which to cross and re-cross, whereas in Cain- 
bridge Surprise we have six paths across, as in Oxford ; and in Ijondon Surprise 
as many as eight such journeys across are made. It is the multiplicity of places, 
and the mode of arranging them, so that they neither block the pa,ths of the activo 
bells nor produce irregular leads, that constitutes a &quot; Surprise&quot; example mero 
places (internal, of course) alone will not accomplish the object. 



54 Standard Mettiods. 

COLLEGE EXERCISE; Diagram page II. 
This, which dates from 1702, was given in the former 
editions. In it adjacent third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s are made, when 
the treble dodges both at the front and back. When the 
treble leads, and lies, second&apos;s and fifth&apos;s, respectively, are 
made, and the bells then behind, or before, make a triple 
dodge. Except when the treble is met there, any bell going 
into the middle makes the far place, dodges, and makes the 
near, and hunts straight on ; the dodge with the treble and 
the place-making being now divided. The &quot; go off &quot; and the 
first nine rows are &quot; Oxford,&quot; and it is interesting to note 
how the absence of the fourth&apos;s (Delight) places frees the 
method of the multiple dodging behind, to which the ancients 
seem to have been so much attached. Meeting the treble in 
3-4 forms a connecting link between the sets of triple dodges. 

College Exercise. Duty of a bell in a plain course. 

1. Make one slow second&apos;s, lead&amp;triple dodge as in C.B., 
IV. dodge treble 3-4, and triple dodge before lying:

5. Dodge treble in 3-4, and take up the other half of the slow, 
in the reverse order, lying next the treble. 

Bob. At a bob, the bell left behind by the treble makes 
&quot; far-ncar-far &quot; places (third&apos;s, fourth&apos;s, and third&apos;s), whilst 
the bells in front run in and out as at a Bob in Old Oxford.

TULIP (Modernised) ; Diagram page 12. 

The first half lead is exactly that known in 1702, but 
here, when the treble lies, a bell is made to lead full, which 
brings up regular lead-ends, without interfering with the 
quick runs for which the method is famous. 

The places at the &quot; go off &quot; are third&apos;s and sixth&apos;s, and 
ordinary treble bob work follows as far as the treble&apos;s 
cross-section in 4-5 ; here a third&apos;s (Delight) place is made, 
and fourth&apos;s at the treble&apos;s dodgings behind. The eight 
positions, where a beginner may wonder whether he dodges 
first or last, will in a great measure settle themselves if he 
will remember that there is a dodge behind at the treble&apos;s 
lead (as well as a neighbouring one in 3-4), with two con- 
secutive whole pulls behind on each side of it. And, again, 
that before and after the treble&apos;s dodging lead there are the 
usual two consecutive full leads, as well as three consecutive 
full leads in the middle of the treble lead. These the learner 
should fully master on the diagram.

places. A bell leaving the slow runs out quick to lie and

dodge, whilst the bell that passes the treble in 4-5 (to dodge 
and lie) proceeds to run in quick, and takes up the deserted 
slow work. 

SOUTH WARK ; Diagram page 13. 

The above name has been selected by the Editor because 
the method, which is taken from a Report by the Central 
Council, bases itself on London Surprise, and so deserves 
a London title. The first seven rows, and, of course, the 
corresponding close of the treble lead, embrace London 
places, and, what is more, produce the self -same rows in the 
self -same order. Indeed, the similarity is so grrat that the 
student will do well to analyse for himself the effect of the 
place-making between the treble&apos;s 4-5 intersections. 

At the &quot; go off &quot; third&apos;s and sixth&apos;s, wrong, are made 
by these bells lying still, and in the next two rows the places 
are again the same. Then an overlapping fourth&apos;s (Delight) 
place is at once made ; and so on, as usual, until the treble&apos;s 
4-5 intersection, when the London Surprise place is omitted 
in third&apos;s, and appears at the lead, in ordinary treble bob 
style. Again, features in common with London, are third&apos;s, 
with the treble behind, and second&apos;s, with her at the lead.

Bob. The bell left doing &quot; treble work&amp;5,6,6,&quot; makes 
fourth&apos;s and out ; the bell leaving the slow makes third&apos;s

snapped previously comes down and makes third&apos;s, and 
enters the slow. 

KENTISH DELIGHT. Diagram r page 14. 
As this has Kent&apos;s &quot; go off,&quot; the Editor, who is again 
indebted to a Report of the Central Council, has given it 
the above name. Although the first seven lines are row for 
row the same as Kent, and as simple, therefore, as can be, 
the central portion of the lead is practically &quot; surprise &quot; 
work, and therefore makes a fitting close to this collection 
of simpler Minor-Methods. The quantity of wrong-handed 
pulls increases its difficulty, and any beginner who has 
mastered it need have no fear of the Surprise Methods. With 
the exception of fifth&apos;s with the treble behind, the third&apos;s 
(Delight) places, and the slow second&apos;s, all places, proper, are 
&quot; wrong &quot; handed. 

Kentish Delight. Duty of a bell in a plain course.

makes two extra dodges after the work behind ; whilst 
the bell previously dodging the treble in the middle 
makes two extra dodges before her work behind. 



CHAP. VIII. SURPRISE MINOR METHODS. 

A few words of introduction cannot be out of place 
here if addressed to the beginner, as for the first time as 
we believe a set of seven genuine Surprise methods has been 
brought together for the use of the would-be experts. 

LONDON&apos;S Place-making. The beginner should first 
turn to the &quot; place-making &quot; of London, p. 16, noting that 
the term is applied to the places which are linked together 
with the treble. Here, a bell about to meet the treble in 
the middle (whether from the front or the back), makes 
the near place, dodges with the treble, and makes the far 
place, which may be shortly written thus : &quot; near-(dodge 
treble)-far.&quot; Moreover, he will find that these very places 
occur in Chester, and Canterbury ; and, indeed, that this 
piece of London is to be found in all seven examples, with 
additions, which we shall now point out. 

Portions tagged on to LONDON&apos;S Place-making. Turning 
to York and Beverley, pp. 17 and 18, &quot; third&apos;s&amp;dodge &quot; 
is added when a bell is going out ; whilst on the way down 
the added piece is taken first, thus &quot; dodge&amp;third&apos;s.&quot; 
The reverse order on the way down is not hard to remem- 
ber if we note that the added dodge takes place at the treble&apos;s 
lead. 



Surprise Methods on Six Bells. 59 

Portions prefixed to LONDON&apos;S Place-making. If we 
turn to Carlisle, p. 19, it will be seen that when a bell has 
just left the front &quot; (dodge) -fourth&apos;s &quot; commences the place- 
making ; whilst on the way down this addition takes the 
form of &quot; fourth&apos;s- (dodge),&quot; the added dodge taking place 
in both cases when the treble is lying behind. 

Portions prefixed and tagged on to LONDON&apos;S Place-making. 
An examination of Cambridge, p. 15, shows that the piece 
prefixed in Carlisle is exactly that prefixed here when a bell 
is going up ; moreover, the piece tagged on is the same, so 
that, in whichever direction a bell is proceeding, the places 
become &quot; (dodge) -far- near- (dodge treble) -far-near- (dodge).&quot; 
Cambridge, therefore, the oldest Surprise method, seems to 
have gathered together the different varieties of the coming 
places, and used them from the very outset as a whole. 

The &quot; wrong &quot; places should be analysed by the student : 
they are not set out here as their enumeration might confuse 
the situation, but they should be carefully studied and 
mastered on the diagram. 

CAMBRIDGE SURPRISE MINOR ; Diagram page 15. 

This is the first Surprise peal ever printed ; it appeared 
in 1753 in the fourth edition of the J.D.&amp;C.M. Campanalogia, 
and is worthy of great attention. There is here an entire 
absence of the &quot; stagnation bob &quot; element, the bells no 
longer locked in pairs moving in and out, from front to back, 
in a manner that is both a wonder and a &quot; surprise &quot; ; 
especially when compared with Westminster, which has the 
same complete number of places. Westminster lead-ends 
date from 1702, but its places come down from Stedman&apos;s 
time. 



60 Standard Method*. 



In regard to the places : In the half lead, third&apos;s and 
fourth&apos;s, in consecutive steps, are made twice by the same 
bell ; with sixth&apos;s in the &quot; go off &quot; pair of rows. Add fifth&apos;s 
and second&apos;s, respectively, with the treble behind and before, 
and you have all that call for attention, as the slow-second&apos;s 
is always in evidence. In speaking of places in a Surprise 
Method, all places, proper, are internal ones, although for 
purposes of description we may have to speak of sixth&apos;s 
(as above), although it is not a place, being part of the hunting 
course.

5. Treble work&amp;5-6 ; in quick ; take up slow work, in reverse 
order, and lie next the treble. 

Bob. At a bob the place-making bell makes fourth&apos;s ; 
and the two bells in front run in and out quick. 

LONDON SURPRISE MINOR ; Diagram page 1C. 

(Taken from the ci Claris&quot; 1788). 

Here the ki go off &quot; makes, with rounds, third&apos;s and 
sixth&apos;s ; after which third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s, in overlapping 
steps, are made twice, one&quot; bell appearing in each pair of 
places : this in the half lead. Regarding the full lead, fourth&apos;s 
and second&apos;s, respectively, are made with the treble behind 
and before. It is important to notice the characteristic 
feature of four consecutive full leads, and four consecutive 



Surprise Methods on Six Bells. 61 



fourth&apos;s, with the treble behind ; and the four consecutive 
bells that lie behind when she is in front, accompanied by 
four consecutive bells in third&apos;s. As nearly all whole pulls 
are &quot; wrong,&quot; it may be well for the learner to search out 
those that are &quot; right.&quot; Those in harmony with the treble 
are amongst these, of course ; the others worthy of notice 
are two third&apos;s, and two fourth&apos;s, which should be found 
on the diagram.

(Taken from the &quot; Clavis&quot; 1788). 

This is Cambridge, exactly, for the first eight rows, and, 
of course, for the corresponding rows at the end of the lead : 
the six rows, when the treble is behind, being London, place 
for place. This the learner should verify.

This, for the first ten rows, and, of course, for the cor-

are made with the treble behind and before ; with two 
curiously introduced consecutive third&apos;s with the treble 
behind, which makes a characteristic middle portion. It 
was pieced together by the Editor when experimenting, 
with a view to secure unblemished Surprise methods, and 
was given the name of Beverley as the sister Minster of York, 
whose foundation speaking figuratively it is built upon. 
In all probability it is an old friend, nevertheless.

Surprise Methods on Six Bells. 63 

Bob. The treble-dodged place-making bell falls in 
fourth&apos;s place at the treble&apos;s lead ; whilst the bells in front 
run in and out quick. 

CARLISLE SURPRISE MINOR ; Diagram page 19. 
(Taken from the &quot; Clavis&quot; 1788.) 

The &quot; go off &quot; of this (which is like London, except that 
third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s are made) is common also to Chester and 
Canterbury, all three methods having their first eight rows 
alike. Fifth&apos;s and second&apos;s, respectively, with the treble behind 
and before, are made, and a comparison with Cambridge 
will show the middle with the treble behind to be the same 
place for place. A peculiarity in the third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s, 
which occur twice in the half lead, is that one bell appears 
in three of these places. 

The similarity of the first eight rows of these three 
methods (which, it will be noticed, all turn up &apos;63 at back 
stroke twice in the first six rows.) link them together, and, 
unfortunately, they each produce &apos;65 at back stroke, twice 
in each part, and therefore not less than six times in the 
720. When, however, the cramped positions, which are 
demanded in a method before it is admitted to be a Surprise 
example, are taken into account, there is reason to be thank- 
ful that we get four perfect examples with every one of the 
twenty-four &apos;65 at hand-stroke. It is easy to avoid the &apos;65 
at part-ends and the like, but it is seemingly impossible to 
do so at all the internal positions. 



64 Standard Methods. 



Carlisle Surprise Minor. Duty of a bell in a plain course. 

1. After a slow second&apos;s&amp;treble work as in Cambridge; run 
out quick (treble 4-5) to 6,5,6 ; and down to third&apos;s (part of 
tliird&apos;s-fourth&apos;s-third&apos;s) ; 

2. Complete fourth&apos;s-third&apos;s (cut treble in 3-2), lead&amp;dodge ; 
places, dodge-far-near-(dodge treble)-far, and 6,5,&lt;k 

3. Treble work linked to treble work, *fifths,* treble work 
linked to treble work&amp;5,6 ; 

4. Places, near-(dodge treble)-far, near-(dodge), and dodge before 
leading ; (treble in 2-3), third&apos;s-fourth&apos;s-third&apos;s ; 

5. Out to 6,5,6 ; in quick to take up the slow, in reverse order, 
as in Cambridge, and lie next the treble. 

Bob. A bell passing the treble in 2-3 makes, as in 
Kent&apos;s bob, third&apos;s, double-fourth&apos;s, third&apos;s, and in ; the bells 
in front making thirds in running in and out these are the 
bells doing &quot; 6,5,6 &quot; work. 

CHESTER SURPRISE MINOR ; Diagram page 20. 
(Taken from the &quot; Clavis&quot; 1788.) 

After what has been said under Carlisle, we need only 
refer to the middle portion, where the treble is behind 
fifth&apos;s (and second&apos;s), being again the same. An examina- 
tion will show that it is the same as Beverley. 

Chester Surprise. Duty of a bell in a plain course. 

1. After a slow second&apos;s, with snap (as in London), make fourth&apos;s- 
third&apos;s-fourth&apos;s ; (treble in 4-5) 6,5,6 ; and down to third&apos;s- 
fourth&apos;s-third&apos;s : 

2. Complete third&apos;s-fourth&apos;s-third&apos;s ; (cut treble in 3-2) ; whole 
turn&amp;double dodge; London places, near-(dodge treble)-

CHAP. IX. METHODS ON EIGHT BELLS. 

DUFFIELD ; Diagram page 25. 

This useful method, produced in 1886 by Sir Arthur 
Heywood, Bart., is adaptable to 8, 10, or 12 bells. 

The plain course of Major consists of eight similar sixes, 
the whole being so simple that it would appear possible 
after a careful analysis of the diagram to take a rope and 
steer oneself through a plain course. 

The first row of a six is a back-stroke, so the &quot; go off &quot; 
falls in with the second row of a six. The whole pulls at the 
lead and back are &quot; right,&quot; and so are the internal places, 
so the learner is not unduly bothered at the outset. 

Double dodging, both at the front and back, is the 
inflexible rule ; and whether you start from the front or 
back, you make the far place in the central four-bell work, 
retrace your steps through three bells to the near place, 
and then restart on your journey through five bells, and 
take up the far double dodging ; you then lead, or lie, as the 
case may be, and make another double dodge, after which 
you recommence your four-bell work in the other direction, 
and complete the plain course with the other double dodging 
work, as shown in the diagram. Being a perfect double 
method, the work on the way down is an exact reversal of 
that on the way up. The terms &quot; first third&apos;s &quot; and &quot; last 
third&apos;s &quot; are used to express the order in which a ringer 
makes these places. 

Bob. At a bob (and the same at a single) the bell that 
is about to leave the four- bell work and go behind, makes 
sixth&apos;s, and recommences the four-bell work ; the others 
behave exactly as in Stedman. Whatever the number of 



Methods on Eight Bells. 67 



bells, a call only affects the last three, and it may be here 
noted that, in extending the method from 8 to 10 and 12 
bells, Stedman-work behind is strictly followed both at the 
plain six-ends, and at those that have calls. 

The coloured lines on the diagram have been specially 
arranged to impress on the eye what Sir Arthur has expressed 
in so many words. The reader is supposed to be ringing 
the tenor, which is shown by the thick red line throughout 
the plain course : your &quot; course-bell &quot; is under the thick 
blue line, namely the sixth : your &quot; after-bell &quot; (which is. 
that which courses after you) is shown by the thin blue line 
through the seventh ; whilst your &quot; Double-bell &quot; is shown 
by the thin red line through the treble. 

Your Double-bell. If the plain course be examined, 
the thick and thin red lines will be seen to be tracing sym- 
metrical but exactly opposite paths. Thus a ringer, knowing 
his Double, knows exactly at any moment what that bell 
should be doing. You pass her in 4-5, both up and down, 
and can consequently watch her movements. A call does 
not affect your mutual relationship whilst you are in the 
four- bell work, but if one be made as you are going down 
to lead, and a clash occur, you know that your double should 
be the bob-making bell, and you can help her through. 

Your Course-bell. This is an important aid. You always 
dodge her first on reaching the back or front, so if, unfortu- 
nately, you forget your position, you can, when you come 
into, say, third&apos;s, notice whether she is in the dodging, and 
if so, join her if not, turn away again. &quot; In short, never 
leave the four- bell work until you see your course-bell in the 
dodging,&quot; tersely says Sir Arthur. &quot; The only exception is 



68 Standard Methods. 



when she is called to make a bob, and turns back again. 
There are three positions in which a call will alter your 
course-bell, but these we must leave the reader to analyse 
for himself, and, in doing so, notice also how to recognise 
his new one. 

Your &quot; After-bell&quot; The knowledge of where to strike 
over her is very useful. You pass her, for instance, in 5-6, 
when making last sixth&apos;s, and cut her in 4-3 when about to 
make last third&apos;s. You also dodge in front and behind with her 
after dodging with your course-bell. In the four-bell work 
your course-bell is with you in the first six, and your after- 
bell during the last. 

&quot; To those who possess the power of keeping others 
straight, the following hints will prove of service : When 
in the dodging, if anyone tries to join you at the first dodge, 
send him away to the opposite dodging ; if at the second 
dodge, tell him to make the far (last) place, and come back 
again ; if it is directly a bob is called you being behind 
and making the first of the extra dodges tell him to go 
down and make first third&apos;s, as he is the bob-making bell.&quot; 
Notice also that the last (back-stroke) blow of first third&apos;s, 
or first sixth&apos;s, is made at the same time as the last dodge 
of the bells in front and behind : the last third&apos;s and last 
s xth&apos;s being made a whole pull previously. &quot; I may say,&quot;- 
quoting the author &quot; that in &apos; Duffield &apos; it will be found 
next to impossible to ring with certainty without watching 
the course-bell and the double-bell.&quot; 

For nearly every remark here gleaned we are indebted to 
Sir Arthur Heywood&apos;s Treatise on &quot; The Duffield Method&quot; 
unfortunately now out of print. 



Methods on Eight Bells. 69 



DOUBLE NORWICH COURT ; Diagram page 26. 

(The half had dates from Stedmarfs time, when fifth&apos;s 
was made with the treble behind, and fourth&apos;s with her in 
front, irregular lead ends resulting. It was then termed College 
Bob Major, and the present arrangement first appeared in 
print in the &quot; Clavis&quot; as Norwich Court Bob). 

This is undoubtedly the most musical of all the plain 
methods, here given, on eight bells, and is at least equal, if 
not superior, to any other Major method. Considering this, 
and bearing in mind that it is seldom practised on account 
of its supposed complexity, I here give a fuller description 
of the duty than would otherwise have been necessary. 

Fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s places are made, by one bell, as the 
treble passes through 3-4 up ; and sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s, by 
another, as the treble passes through 5-6 up. Fifth&apos;s and 
sixth&apos;s, and third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s are also made as the treble 
hunts down. This place-making creates dodges in 3-4 and 
5-6 at certain intervals, and invariably causes each bell to 
make a double dodge both before, and after, leading and 
lying, except when the treble intervenes. 

Let us examine the work of the bells before and behind, 
commencing with the work at the lead. Between each 
of the different leads of the treble three bells are in front ; 
of these, one, that turns the treble away, leads, and double 
dodges after ; and is said to do &quot; first work in front.&apos;&quot;* The 
bell that comes in, and double dodges with this first- work 
bell, leads, and afterwards makes another double dodge ; and 
is said to do &quot; full work in front.&quot; The next (the last of the 
three) makes a double dodge with this full work bell, leads, 
* Meaning first work of the whole lead. 



70 Standard Methods. 

and is then turned away by the treble ; and thus does &quot; last 
work in front.&quot; In the same way three bells work behind ; 
one does &quot; first work behind&quot; another &apos;&apos; full work behind&quot; and 
the last &quot; last work behind&quot; Thus, whenever you come to lead, 
or go behind, unless you turn the treble away you make a 
double dodge, lead, or lie, as the case may be, and, unless the 
treble turns you away, afterwards make another double 
dodge. 

When the bells leave the front, it will be seen that (in 
the first lead) one bell dodges in 3-4 and 5-6 up ; and (in the 
fifth lead), when leaving the back, dodges in 5-6 and 3-4 down, 
This work is, respectively, the duty of bells after finishing 
first work, in front, and behind. 

If the other bells, leaving the front, be examined, it will 
be seen that one bell hunts up into 5-6, where it dodges, 
makes sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s places, and then hunts up. Another 
bell hunts up to fourth&apos;s, makes fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s, dodges 
in 3-4, and then hunts up behind. Concerning these &quot; place- 
making bells&quot; it should be noted that one dodges before, and 
the other after, making the places ; but neither of them dodge 
in the intermediate places, on their way to, or from, their 
place-making positions. In other words, the bell that hunts 
up to make the places in 5-6, although it makes a dodge in 
5-6 before making these places, does not dodge in 3-4 on its 
way up to 5-6 ; nor does it dodge in 5-6 after making the 
places. The other bell, which does not dodge before making 
the places in 3-4 up, dodges after making them ; but does not 
dodge in 5-6 on its way behind. 

In the same way, of the place-making bells from behind, 
one runs straight down into 3-4, where it dodges, makes 



Methods on Eight Bells. 71 



third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s places, and goes straight to the lead ; 
the other makes fifth&apos;s and sixth&apos;s places, dodges in 5-6, 
and goes straight down. 

The places made from the front, and back, may be 
known as the &quot; far &quot; and &quot; near &quot; places, according to their 
relationship to the respective starting points. From the front, 
the places in 5-6 would be the far, and those in 3-4 the near 
places ; from behind, the 3-4 would be the far, and the 5-6 
the near, places. The bells that do full work, in front, and 
behind, proceed to make the far places, and those that do 
last work in front and behind, make the near places. The 
far places begin, and the near places end, with a dodge. 
These facts can easily be remembered by noticing that 
bells that have done full work in front, and behind, leave those 
positions with a dodge ; and begin the place-making with a 
dodge ; those that have done last work in front, and behind, 
leave those positions without dodging, and commence the 
place-making without dodging. 

The work of bells from the front and back may be sum- 
marised thus : 

After first work, in front, dodge in 3-4, and 5-6, up. 
After full work, in front, make the far places, 
After last work, in front, make the near places. 

After first work, behind, dodge in 5-6, and 3-4, down. 
After full work, behind, make the far places. 
After last work, behind, make the near places. 

Although the plain-course duty does not occur in the 
above order, the table shows the similarity of the work from 
the front and back. I advise my readers to question them- 
selves until they can decide, when leaving the front, and 
back, what duty they have to perform. 



72 Standard Methods. 



The following is another way of considering this duty. 
The bell that does the first work (before and behind) makes 
no places, but merely dodges ; the bell that does full work 
goes as far as it can without making the places, that is, it 
makes the far places ; the bell that does last duty at once 
makes the near places. 

The order in which the different duties actually occur, as 
shown below, should now be learnt. 

Double Norwich Court. Duty of each bell in a plain course. 

First work in front. Last work behind. 

Full work in front. 

First work behind. Last work in front. 
Full work behind. 

It will be seen that the first work (front and back) is 
followed by the last work in the opposite position ; and the 
last work is always followed by the full work. A great variety 
of observations as to the order of the duties may be made ;

for instance, if you leave the place-making with a dodge, your 
work, whether in front or behind, begins with dodging. I 
shall, however, leave further observations to the ingenuity of 
my readers, and proceed to consider the calls. 

Bob. At a bob, sixth&apos;s place is made ; this causes the 
bells behind to continue dodging (a five-pull dodge in all) 
until separated by the treble ; the bells below sixth&apos;s place 
are unaltered ; the others are altered as follows : 

A bell, that dodged in 3-4 and 5-6 up, makes sixth&apos;s place, and 
then dodges in o-G and 3-4 down. 

A bell, that has completed the first work behind, makes an addi- 
tional three-pull dodge there, and becomes the bell that has done 
full work behind. 

A bell, that would have done the full work behind, makes a five- 
pull dodge, lies, and becomes the bell that has done the last work 
behind. 

Single. At a single, one bell does full work behind, as at 
a plain lead ; another makes sixth&apos;s place, as at bob ; the bell 
that has done first work behind makes seventh&apos;s place, and 
then begins the last work behind. 

DOUBLE OXFORD ; Diagram page 27. 

(It will be noticed that the first half lead is, row for row, 
Double Norwich ; and the. Minor, we know, dates from 1677). 

In this, as in Double Norwich Court, third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s, 
and fifth&apos;s and sixth&apos;s places, are made, when the treble is 
passing through these positions on her way up and down. 
In Double Oxford, however, second&apos;s and seventh&apos;s places, 
respectively, are also made when the treble leads and lies. 
Bells are thus retained before, and behind, until they have 
completed all their duty there. The whole duty, which is 
continuous, is easily learnt therefore in one lesson. 



74 Standard Method*. 



On coming to the lead each bell makes a five-pull dodge, 
leads, makes second&apos;s place, leads, and then makes another 
five-pull dodge. Work similar to this also occurs behind. 
On leaving the front, each bell dodges in 3-4, makes fourth&apos;s 
and third&apos;s places, and then makes a three-pull dodge in 3-4 ; 
after this it passes into 5-6, where it begins with a three-pull 
dodge, makes sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s places, dodges in 5-6, and 
then goes up to the work behind. Similar work occurs on the 
way down from behind. 

It will be seen that the three-pull dodges, in 3-4 and 5-6, 
follow one another ; that is, after leaving the front and back, 
a three-pull dodge takes place after the place-making, and 
then another such dodge immediately precedes the next place- 
making ; thus the three-pull dodges may be said to occur 
together. 

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place instead of second&apos;s, is 
made ; the work of the bells in 5-6, and 7-8, is not altered ; 
that of the others is altered thus : 

A bell, that has just left the work in front, makes fourth&apos;s place 
(instead of dodging in 3-4), and goes down to the work in front again. 

A bell that would have made second&apos;s place, runs out, makes 
fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s, dodges three times in 3-4, and goes up to the 
three-pull dodge, etc., in 5-6. 

A bell, that has made the places in 3-4 down, runs straight in 
(instead of dodging in 3-4) and takes up the remainder of the work in 
front. 

Single. At a single, one bell makes second&apos;s place, as at 
a plain lead ; another makes fourth&apos;s, as at a bob ; and the 
bell that has made third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s places on the way 
down, makes third&apos;s place ; and then fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s, 
etc., on the way up. 



CHAP. X. 
TREBLE BOB METHODS ON EIGHT BELLS. 

ALBION TREBLE BOB MAJOR ; Diagram pages 32-33. 

This fine example of an Imperial Method first appeared 
in Hubbard, 1845, where it is placed to the credit of Hugh 
Wright, of Leeds, Yorkshire, the author of that work adding : 
&quot;It is the most even and regular of any Treble Bob method 
extant, inasmuch as any peal of Bob Major, with bobs only, 
and tenors together, may be applied to it.&quot; The number of 
changes would then, of course, be doubled. Hubbard further 
points out that every alternate pair of the changes in ques- 
tion will be found to constitute the familiar rows of Bob 
Major. 

It will be noticed that whenever a bell comes to lead, or 
goes behind, &quot; treble work &quot; is expected of it ; and, at the 
treble&apos;s full work, in front, the sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s (and fifth&apos;s 
and sixth&apos;s) places are repeated by the same bell, causing 
a triple dodge in 3-4, with extra dodges behind, before, and 
after &quot; treble- work.&quot; A bell gives a full lead when the 
treble lies behind, and when that bell is in front second&apos;s 
place is made. Imperial places are made throughout : in 
5-6 when the treble is before, and in 3-4 when she is behind. 

Bob. At a bob fourth&apos;s (instead of second&apos;s) is made 
by the bell that having passed the treble in 2-3 would 
have joined in a triple dodge in 3-4. The bells in front run 
in and out ; that is the bell left behind by the treble and 
(after sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s) due to join the triple dodge in 3-4, 
dodges once, and goes in ; whilst the bell that leaves the 
slow dodges once in 3-4, makes fifth&apos;s and sixth&apos;s, and goes 
before the treble to the back. 



76 Standard Methods. 

In the following table, regular work is supposed to be 
understood : 

Albion T. B. Major. Duty of a bell in a plain course. 

1. On leaving the slow, make third&apos;s and fourth&apos;s ; and sixth&apos;s 
and fifth&apos;s on t.he way down to the triple dodge in 3-4. - 

2. Complete this last ; third&apos;s&amp;fourth&apos;s out, pass the treble 
in 6-7 ; and sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s, twice over, going down. 

3. Complete this repetition ; make third&apos;s&amp;fourth&apos;s before 
dodging the treble in 5-6 out, and dodge twice (extra) after. 

4. Make all four places, both on the way down and on the way 
up, with two extra dodges before the work behind. 

5. After dodging treble in 5-6 down, make fourth&apos;s&amp;third&apos;s, 

and after dodging treble in 3-4 out, make fifth&apos;s and sixth&apos;s, 
twice over. 

6. Cut treble in 7-6 down, and make fourth&apos;s&amp;third&apos;s, pass 
treble in 2-3, and triple dodge in 3-4. 

7. Complete this ;&amp;make fifth&apos;s&amp;sixth&apos;s ; on the way down 
fourth&apos;s and third&apos;s ; and lie next the treble. 

Except at the bob, and otherwise at the treble leads, 
all (internal) places are made &quot; wrong.&quot; 

SUPERLATIVE SURPRISE ; Diagram pages 34-5. 

(First appeared in the &quot; Clams&quot; the authors referring to 
it as &quot; an original composition of OUR OWN.&quot;) 

ALTHOUGH undoubtedly the most musical of the Treble Bob 
methods here&apos;given, there is nothing very complicated about 
it. Should it ever be generally practised, the full merits of 
its musical properties will doubtless be properly appreciated. 

The diagram shows each bell three times in front, and 
three times behind, in the plain course. If the work of the 
bells, in front and behind, be examined, it will be seen that 



Treble, Bob Methods on Eight Bells. 77 



each (the treble permitting) makes a double dodge both 
before and after leading and lying, except when such a dodge 
is extended to five pulls. If these five-pull dodges are noted 
as the exceptions, then double dodging becomes the rule. 

When the treble leads and lies, second&apos;s and seventh&apos;s 
places, respectively, are made ; this, therefore, keeps the same 
bells before and behind, and their work, therefore, may be 
described as &quot; work with treble in front&quot; and &quot; work with treble 
behind.&quot; This work is similar, whether before, or behind ; 
the work with the&apos; treble in front running thus : double 
dodge, lead, dodge treble, second&apos;s place, dodge treble, lead, 
and double dodge. The work with the treble behind is rela- 
tively the same, seventh&apos;s being made instead of second&apos;s 
place. 

A very critical examination of the place-making, which 
occurs in 3-4, and 5-6, is necessary. Take that in the first 
lead of the diagram. It will be seen that, on arriving in 5-6, 
a dodge is made, followed by sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s, a dodge then 
takes place with the treble, sixth&apos;s and fifth&apos;s are again made, 
and another dodge follows. Up to this point the work in 5-6, 
before and after dodging with the treble, may be said to be 
symmetrical ; that is, the dodges and places made, before 
and after dodging with the treble, are equal.* At this point 
a sixth&apos;s place, and another dodge, is required to complete 
the place-making in 5-6. An examination of the place- 
making in 3-4 in the fifth lead shows that that work is also 



* In Cambridge Surprise, the place-making consists merely of 
what is here termed, the symmetrical work, and it may therefore be 
advantageously studied here, as the additional place-making will then 
be more easily understood. 



78 Standard Methods. 



symmetrical as far as the third dodge, when an extra third&apos;s 
place, and another dodge is added. If, however, the place- 
making in 3-4 in the third lead, and 5-6 in the seventh, be 
examined, it will be seen that a dodge in 3-4 and a third&apos;s 
place, and a dodge in 5-6 and a sixth&apos;s place, have to be 
made before the remainder of the work is found symmetrical 
on each side of the treble&apos;s dodge. To distinguish these 
additions, a custom has been introduced of calling them the 
&quot; odd &quot; places ; thus, in the first lead, the &quot; odd sixth&apos;s &quot; 
occurs last, that is, after the symmetrical work ; in the 
seventh lead, the &quot; odd sixth&apos;s &quot; occurs first, i.e., before the 
the other place-making. In the same way, in the third lead, 
we have &quot; odd third&apos;s first,&quot; and in the fifth lead &quot; odd third&apos;s 
last.&quot; The place-making duty must be thoroughly learnt, 
so that, knowing whether odd sixth&apos;s or third&apos;s comes first, 
or last, each ringer may &quot; count &quot; his blows, and so leave the 
place-making position correctly. If this be done the last 
dodge will show him in which direction he has to proceed, 
whether up or down. 

The places to be made, from the front and back, are 
those farthest away in each case ; and it will be seen that, 
afterwards, each bell returns to its starting-point. Thus, on 
leaving the front, the places to be made are those in 5-6, 
after which you return again to the front. It is evident,&apos; 
therefore, that before you fall into one of the place-making 
positions, you pass through a dodging place, and, on your 
return from place-making you again pass through the same 
dodging place. Now, the question arises, do you dodge at 
cither of these times ? Examine the first lead of the diagram. 
On the way to make the places in 5-6, the second bell do&lt;L&lt;- 



Treble Bob Methods on Eight Bells. 79 



in 3-4 up ; but, on the way down again, the dodge in 3-4 is 
omitted. In the third lead, the dodge in 5-6, on the way 
down to make the places in 3-4, is omitted ; but, in hunting 
up, this dodge is made. A simple rule, however, &apos;is at hand. 
If the &quot; odd place &quot; be made first you omit the dodge on the way 
to it ; if, however, the odd place be made last, you dodge on 
the way to the place-making position, but come straight away 
from it. 

Having now considered (1) the work with the treble in 
front, and behind, and also (2) the place-making positions, 
there only remains to examine (3) the intermediate work 
between these latter positions. This work is that between 
the place-making in 5-6 in the first, and that in 3-4 in the 
third lead ; and between the place-making in the fifth and 
seventh leads. 

In leaving the place-making in the first lead, odd sixth&apos;s 
being made last, the dodge in 3-4 is omitted. Now the work 
from the point at which the bell shown in the diagram comes 
to lead, until it leaves the back to make the &quot; odd-third&apos;s- 
first-places &quot; in the third lead, is the intermediate work. It 
runs thus : double dodge before leading, and five-pull dodge 
after ; run straight out ; five-pull dodge before lying, and 
double-dodge after. The intermediate work in the fifth and 
sixth leads is simply the reverse, as the first five-pull dodge 
is made after lying, and you run straight down to the five- 
pull dodge before leading. 

It will be seen that the five-pull dodges follow one 
another, being separated only by a &quot; run through.&quot; In other 
words, if you leave the work in front with a five-pull dodge, 



80 Standard Methods. 



you run straight up and begin the work behind with a five- 
pull dodge, and vice versa. 

The whole duty in a plain course is summarised below. 
Each ringer must make himself perfectly familiar with the 
details of all the work included in, and connected with, these 
shortened headings.

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place, instead of second&apos;s, is 
made ; the bells above fourth&apos;s are not altered ; the others 
are altered as follows : 

A bell, that made &quot; odd third&apos;s first,&quot; makes fourth&apos;s place, and 
takes up the work of the bell making &quot; odd third&apos;s last.&quot; 

A bell, that would have made second&apos;s place, runs straight up 
into 5-6, where it dodges, and hunts up to work with the treble behind. 

A bell, that has been with the treble behind, and has dodged 
in 5-6 down (and was about to make &quot; odd third&apos;s last &quot;) runs straight 
through 3-4 and takes up the remainder of the work with the treble 
in front.

(First found in this correct (Major) form in the &quot;Clavis&quot;). 

Although this method has only been practised by 
advanced companies, it will not prove to be particularly 
intricate, as the place-making is simple and regular. The 
work requiring most study is that into which each bell falls 
before and after making the different sets of places. 

When the treble leads, and lies, second&apos;s and seventh&apos;s 
places, respectively, are made. This keeps the same l&gt;ells 



Treble Bob Methods on Eight Bells. 81 

before, and behind, and causes them to do &quot; full work in front &quot; 
and &quot; full work behind.&quot; The bell that comes down to the full 
work in front, dodges before and after leading ; and its work 
so far, being similar to the treble&apos;s at the lead, may be called 
&quot; treble work&quot; After doing this &quot; treble work &quot; such a bell 
makes second&apos;s place, leads, dodges with the treble, makes 
second&apos;s place (over the treble), and repeats the work in 
reverse order. This work may, therefore, be learnt thus : 

Full work in front. 

Treble work, second&apos;s, lead. 

Dodge treble, second&apos;s place, dodge treble. 
Lead, second&apos;s, treble work. 

The corresponding full work behind is even more simple, 
as it consists of a double dodge before lying, after which the 
treble comes up and has to be dodged with, seventh&apos;s place is 
then made, and the work repeated in reverse order. This 
work may, therefore, be learnt thus : 

Full work behind. 
Double dodge, lie, and dodge with the treble. 

Seventh&apos;s place. 
Dodge with the treble, lie, and double dodge. 

An examination of the place-making positions in 5-6 and 
3-4 up, and in 3-4 and 5-6 down, shows that the work in each 
of these positions is similar ; that is, you begin with a dodge, 
make two places, dodge with the treble, then make the same 
two places and finish with a dodge, after which you continue 
coursing in your previous path. The bell in the diagram 
first makes the place in 5-6 up, and then (in the next lead) 
those in 3-4 up ; after this it does the full work behind, and 
then makes the places in 3-4 and in 5-6 down. 

F 



82 Standard Method*. 



The intermediate work connecting these sets of places 
requires a little attention. This duty consists in doing 
&quot; treble work &quot; behind, or before, hunting straight across, 
and then doing treble work before, or behind. The duty as it 
occurs in the second and third leads may be set out and 
learnt thus : 

Intermediate work connecting the place-making. 

/Treble work behind, i 

Places in 5-6 up. &apos; Run straight across &apos; Places in 3-4 up. 
| Treble work in front. ) 

This work connecting the places must be so learnt as to 
require no further setting out in the plain course duty. Each 
ringer must therefore remember that when the duty runs 

thus : 

Places in 5-6 up, etc. Places in 3-4 up. 

he has this connecting work to insert to complete the whole. 

Each bell, after making the sets of places, in 5-6 and 3-4 
up, does the full work behind ; after which the places in 3-4 
down are made, and the intermediate work (in reverse order) 
connects them to those that follow in 5-6 down. 

It now only remains to learn the other class of inter- 
mediate work which (1) falls between the full work in front 
and the place-making in 5-6 up ; and (2) that which falls 
between the place-making in 5-6 down and the full work in 
front. The simplest way is to consider it as based on dodging 
in each place, with&gt;treble work &quot; in front and behind ; and 
then to observe the omissions and additions that have to be 
made. These latter, after the work in front, run thus : 
Omit the dodge in 5-6, but make a double dodge behind. 
Omit the dodge in 3-4, and before leading. This may be 
tabulated and learnt thus : 



Treble Bob Methods on Eight Bells. 83 



(1) Intermediate duty after full work in front. 

Omit 5-6. Double dodge behind. 
Omit 3-4, and before. 

Similarly the reverse duty between the place- making 
and the full work in front may be learnt thus : 

(2) Intermediate duty after place-making in 5-6 down. 

Omit after, and 3-4. 
Double dodge after. Omit 5-6. 

When the details of all the work, and their relative 
positions, have been carefully studied, the duty of the plain 
course may be stated as follows : 

Cambridge Surprise. Duty of each bell in a plain course. 

Leave full work in front. 

Intermediate duty. 
Places in 5-6 up, etc. Places in 3-4 up. 

Full work behind. 

Places in 3-4 down, etc. Places in 5-6 down. 
Intermediate duty. 
Full work in front. 

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s place, instead of second&apos;s, is 
made ; the bells above fourth&apos;s place are not altered. The 
others are altered as follows : 

A bell, that has made the places in 3-4 up, makes fourth&apos;s, and 
then makes the places in 3-4 down, and thus omits the full work 
behind. 

A bell, that would have made second&apos;s place, runs straight up 
into 5-6, dodges there, and goes up to the full work behind. . 

A bell, that has just completed the full work behind, and is on 
its way to the place-making in 3-4 down, omits the dodge in 3-4, runs 
straight in, and takes up the remainder of the full work in front.

LONDON SURPRISE ; Diagram pages 38-9. 
(From the &quot; Claris.&quot;) 

This is, without doubt, an extremely complicated method, 
a peal in which requires great practice. The conventional 
way to master the method is to learn the work of a bell in 
each lead of the plain course. Although not practically 
acquainted with the method, it would seem to be a better 
plan to learn the work after (1) meeting the treble on one&apos;s 
way up, and (2) after crossing her path on the way down, as 
this divides the duty into a series of short lessons. 

In tabulating these lessons the work with the treble in 
front is classed as work in front. The term treble work has been 
previously described. The snaps, which are all double, 
except those at the lead, have their respective strokes set out 
in each case. Amongst the positions which should be traced 
on the diagram are four wrong third&apos;s places and four wrong 
pulls behind when the treble is before all other whole pulls 
behind being right ; and also four wrong sixth&apos;s, and eight 
wrong leads, when she is behind. There are also three right 
fifth&apos;s when she is behind (or nearly so), one being central, 
with one before and another after dodging with her in 5-6. 
Fourth&apos;s, and third&apos;s, right, are made before and after dodging 
with the treble in 3-4, both up and down ; and four fourth&apos;s 
wrong, are also made, i.e., two when she is working through 
5-6 up, and two when she is working through 5-6 down. 
In the third lead of the diagram the Stedman whole pulls 
fall in last-whole-turn style, and in the fifth lead in first- 
whole-turn style. In learning the duty it should be noted 
that the central lead of the diagram is symmetrical, and that 



Treble Bob Methods on Eight Bells. 85 



the first half of the course repeats itself in a reverse order 
very plainly visible. 

The figures in the table in brackets denote the lead 
then entered upon. 

Concise duty, after leaving the full work in front : 

(1) Fourth&apos;s ; lead ; fifth&apos;s. 

Dodge treble 5-6 up 8, 7, 8 ; third&apos;s : (2) 6, 5, 6. 
Cut treble 5-4 down Fourth&apos;s ; lead ; sixth&apos;s. 
Pass treble 6-7 up Treble work behind&amp;7, 8, 8 : (3) third&apos;s. 
Cut treble 3-2 down Whole turn ; sixth&apos;s. 
Dodge treble 7-8 up Treble work ; 5, 6, 5 ; lie : (4) fourth&apos;s. 
Dodge treble 3-4 down Third&apos;s ; lead ; fifth&apos;s ; lead ; third&apos;s. 
Dodge treble 3-4 vip Fourth&apos;s ; lie : (5) 5, 6, 5 ; treble work. 
Dodge treble 7-8 down Sixth&apos;s ; whole turn. 
Pass treble 2-3 up Third&apos;s ; (6) 8, 8, 7&amp;treble work. 
Cut treble 7-6 down Sixth&apos;s ; lead ; fourth&apos;s. 
Pass treble 4-5 up 6, 5, 6 ; third&apos;s ; (7) 8. 7, 8. 
Dodge treble 5-6 down Fifth&apos;s ; lead ; fourth&apos;s, and full work in 

front. 

Bob. At a bob, fourth&apos;s instead of second&apos;s is made ; 
the bells above being unaltered. The others are altered thus : 

A bell, that completed the full work in front during the previous 
lead (and has just dodged the treble in 5-6 up), after striking 8, 7, 8, 
hunts down and makes fourth&apos;s ; hunts up behind, strikes 8, 7, 8, 
dodges the treble in 5-6 down, and then goes down to the intermediate 
and full work in front. The work of this bell is therefore thrown back 
two leads. 

A bell, doing full work in front, instead of making second&apos;s place 
makes third&apos;s place, strikes 6, 5, 6, and has its work advanced a lead. 

A bell, that passed the treble in 4-5 up, after striking 6, 5, 6, 
and making third&apos;s place, takes up the remainder of the full work in 
front, and thus has its work advanced a lead.

If each of the foregoing parts be twice repeated the bells 
will come round at the half-peal end. If a single is called at 
the first half-peal end, and the whole repeated, the 720 
changes will be produced. 

In Plain Bob, St. Clement&apos;s, Double Oxford, and Double 
Bob, if the singles are called at the half-peal ends the tenors 
will not be reversed. If the single in Double Court is called 
at the first lead-end, in College Single at the ninth, and in 



88 



Standard Methods. 



Canterbury pleasure at the second lead-end, in one of the 
parts of the first half- peal, the tenors will not be reversed ; 
the second single must of course be called in the corresponding 
part in the second half of the peal. In the Grandsire example 
a single may be substituted for a bob at the third lead-end 
(see *) in one part of each half- peal, without disturbing the 
tenors. 

The foregoing peals are called by the observation of the 
fifth and sixth bells. In the methods in which the bells 
behind are undisturbed by the bobs, the tenor is called when 
behind without the fifth ; the singles have then to be called 
when these two bells are behind. In methods in which the 
two bells in front are not altered, the bobs have to be called 
when the tenor is in second&apos;s or third&apos;s place at the lead-end 
without the fifth in the other of these positions ; the singles 
have then to be called at a lead-end when the tenors are in 
front.

In the methods in which the bells going into and coming 
out of the slow (or the work in front) are undisturbed by the 
bobs, the peals are called by the observation of the tenor in 
and out without the fifth. In the methods in which the bells 
behind are the ones not altered by the&apos;bobs, the tenor is 
called when behind withoiit the fifth.
