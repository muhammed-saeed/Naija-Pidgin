 End Motor Oil Changes Forever and Get 500,000 Miles Out of Your Car&apos;s Engine -- Minimum Gary North
 
April 11, 2012
I keep coming back to this story every five years or so. New subscribers have not read about it. Old-time subscribers forget.
The secret is the Frantz oil filter. It uses a roll of toilet paper as the filter.
&quot;An oil filter that uses toilet paper. What a joke!&quot;
It is not a joke. But the universal customer response is initially something like this.
The toilet paper filters out everything larger than half a micron . This removes virtually all metal particles. The oil stays clean physically 100% of the time. There is no grit to wear out metal parts.
Toilet paper also removes water, thereby reducing all acid creation to zero: no water -- no acid. The oil is pure chemically.
Oil does not wear out. It just gets dirty. A roll of toilet paper keeps oil clean all of the time.
Change the toilet paper once every 5,000 miles, add a quart of oil to replace the oil absorbed by the used roll, and your engine&apos;s oil stays clean. The engine will not wear out for 500,000 miles. The car&apos;s body will wear out first.
The oil is always clean. It does not go from clean to dirty in between oil changes, as it does with a normal oil filter.
 Note: the best toilet paper to use is the cheap commercial kind: 500 two-ply sheets. The standard &quot;soft&quot; kinds have 350 sheets: less paper, more air, and higher profits for the manufacturers. Scott 1000 also works. 
Back in the 1960s, there was a rival product to the Frantz called the Motor Guard. I used one of these units on my 1956 VW from 1965 until I sold the car in 1971. It worked as advertised.
Later, I switched to a Frantz. I changed my oil three times in 125,000 miles on my 1972 Toyota Corolla. A decade later, I had a mechanic strip the engine to see what shape it was in. He said that every part was within original factory specifications. He had been a skeptic. After he did the test, he wrote an article for my newsletter, Remnant Review , praising it.
You can still buy a Frantz here: http://www.frantzoil.com/home.html .
You must pay a mechanic to install it or install it yourself.
A competing product is sold by the Amsoil company , although it doesn&apos;t use toilet paper for the filter. You buy Amsoil filter rolls. It works just fine.
These are by-pass filters . They are added into your existing oil filtration system, which will no longer have anything to filter.
Here is a good reason why you probably won&apos;t buy a Frantz or an Amsoil by-pass filter: engines today fill most of the the space under the hood. There is little room for one of these by-pass filters. I wish there were.


 A HUGE MARKETING PROBLEM 
The Frantz has never really caught on. There are reasons for this.
First, there was too much resistance to the claim of the original manufacturer: End Oil Changes . It seems impossible -- too good to be true.
Second, there are endless rumors about how the toilet paper can shred and ruin your engine. This is a so-called urban myth. Oil-drenched toilet paper does not shred. Also, for advertising purposes only, the units have a fine mesh screen to prevent this.
Third, there are rumors about how independent testing organizations have disproved the manufacturer&apos;s claim. No such tests have been conducted.
But, most important of all, there is not enough price mark-up in the units to provide a decent full-time living for salesmen.
Sales resistance is too high. Would-be customers hear about ending oil changes, and they turn off. &quot;Impossible. If that were true, the auto manufacturers would install these filters.&quot; On the contrary, auto manufacturers would fight such filters as expensive additions to install and (worse) likely to triple or quadruple the life of an engine. Auto manufacturers want to increase auto sales, not reduce them.
Local auto dealers make a nice income through oil changes. Auto companies void their warranties unless you get the oil changed on schedule and keep a record of these changes. So, the by-pass filters have not sold well ever since long warranties were introduced by manufacturers.
The other marketing problem is that there are no repeat sales. The user can remove the filter canister from his car before he sells it. He then installs it on the new car if there is room under the hood.
It can be used for some purposes.


 INBOARD MOTORBOAT ENGINES 
It is a huge hassle to change the oil on an inboard motor boat. You must lift the engine out of the boat to drain the oil. This is expensive. So, a Frantz or Amsoil bypass filter is ideal. You install it and never have to change the oil again. But not many people own an inboard motor boat. The market is tiny.


 CLASSIC CARS 
Classic cars are cars with lots of space under the hood. They are cars that were built before the new fuel emission standards. For them, then as now, a Frantz filter is great. The engines will last for decades. The owners keep the cars&apos; bodies in good shape. (This good old boy didn&apos;t bother.)
 


 TRACTORS 
Most tractors have no problem with lack of hood space. A Frantz is ideal for a tractor.
In the old days, you could buy multi-filter Frantz systems stacked vertically. These were used by diesel truck fleets. I have not seen a photo of one for decades.


 DIESEL FUEL 
We hear stories of people who get a fuel tank installed in the trunk of their diesel cars. Then they fill it with used vegetable oil that they get for free at some local fast food restaurant. Some of these people manage fast food restaurants. The car runs fine on this alternative fuel if the oil is clean. So, the smart ones install a Frantz on the fuel line. This cleans the fuel perfectly. They never buy diesel at the pump again. A few owners may start their cars with normal diesel and run it for five minutes until the engine is warmed up. Then they flip a switch, and the vegetable fuel kicks in. They fill up at the pump every few years.


 MOTOR GUARD 
The Motor Guard was a great oil filter, but the firm failed. It was bought by a new firm, which switched to to an air filter. It looks just the same from the outside. You can buy one for
