89,357 Views - The hillarious but highly Rocking Greenhouse Effect Videos from their &quot;Final band meeting&quot; Of November 1 99 2 at El Segundo California&apos;s Jet City Sound Studio have been spliced into other G.e clips. Four Songs were shot that night; Three Versions of &quot;White Black Thang&apos;, Search and Destroy, Two Versions (Or more) of the Beatles cover version of &quot;Please Please me&quot;, ...and ofcourse several for the somewhat uptemp G.e. Rocker &quot;Manipulation&quot;. Clark Hagins calls the Video for &quot;Manipulation&quot; his favourite; &quot;We look like we&apos;re havin&apos; fun there,..we look silly but one can tell that when we played live - We Rocked,..and we rocked hard,...we were a weird unusual band,..to say the least.&quot; Greenhouse Effect exploded in notoriety in 2007 with some of Google Videos Most watched clips World Wide; &quot;Our drummer died in 1 99 9 in a bizarre Gardening accident (Laughs)&quot; says Clark Haggins. Ofcourse Hagins is only kidding as he is referring to hillarious Danish Drummer Palle Carlson , the Denmark Drummer who resembles Spinal Tap&apos;s first percussionist in old 1965 black and white clips. &quot;Greenhouse Effect was a World sensation for quite a long time,..we attracted alot of attention and 50,000 Twitter Followers,...I never wanted all the internet fun to end,...but I do see things now finally slowing down in 2010&quot; says Clark Hagins. &quot;We only get about two Million looks a day now,...thats pathetic compared to the kind of business we used to do in 2008.&quot; - There are ofcourse no plans for Rock&apos;s most watched band to reassemble any time soon and Hagins sees the 1 99 2 demise of the band as just another bizarre mistake from his life&apos;s journey; &quot;We were around for like 7 years,...Me and Flipper (Phil Keegan Guitarist) had planned to be the biggest Rock Stars in the musical universe - but it never happened,... ,...until I was like 50 years old (Laughs) &quot; says Haggins. &quot;We watched all those music industry bands like Nirvana and Green Day hit it big while we did things like work in cubes and clean Pools,..its just a damn shame&quot; says Higgins. Hagins says that the tired band eventually grew &apos;into futility&apos; by late 92&apos; ; &quot;We had all these Great songs and a great live show but we made enemies with all of the biggest wigs in Hollyweird ...there was no way I was ever gonna kiss their arsses - I would clean Swimming Pools before I would do that (Laughs).&quot; Hagins calls the Video for &quot;Manipulation&quot; the absolute Last Hurrah for G.E. ; &quot;The End of the video is hella fucking cool - it looks like Ted is trying to fuck me in the ass and then Palle just picks his nose,.. its pure Lame Rock n roll the way you love it,..it&apos;s fuckin&apos; hella cool &quot; ================== 148,037 Views - &quot;Ripping Reason&quot; Comes roaring Out of the speakers with sheer Psychedelic Power !! This Track Sounds so Great in this &apos;other&apos; version - A 1 99 2 &quot;Remix&quot; by sound studio engineer Bill Krodel in El Segundo California with Clark Hagins. &quot;Ripping Reason&quot; is a personal favorite of mine&quot; says Higgins. &quot;I was trying to make it a &apos;hit&apos; I remember,...sorta like &quot;Brandy&quot; but it is so much &apos;more&apos; !! It&apos;s not really a hit so-to-speak ,...its just a flat out Good solid song - A Great piece of Songwriting,...and it sounds Great At Jango Radio !! &apos;Ripping&apos; was recorded in the frantic final days of G.e. and it doesn&apos;t rely on gimmicks like punk speed or guitar solos to get by,...it drudges along in pure melody to near abstract rock perfection and brilliance !!! The confused and tortured lyrics make this track a real winner in cyberspace - and a somewhat &apos;unusual&apos; song for the always quirky G.e. !!!!!!!!! =============== Irie Bob. This 1 99 2 Track is a real Winner for Greenhouse Effect Music Online and in particular at Youtube and GoogleVideo.Com &quot;I started SuperNetCelebrities.Com with Homestead Web hosting who I found through Michael Savage&apos;s Website -...to help bands get exposure&quot; says Clark Hagins in 2008. &quot;Its my goal to make sure that Great bands like Los Angeles&apos;s Batlord get seen more,....and man, do I ever get them seen - ALOT&quot;. IRIE BOB IS THE Pixies-Like 60&apos;s Stooges Like track that appears as the second song on the 1 99 5 &quot;Fountain Weird CD&quot; available at itunes and CD Baby. &quot;The Song was originally entitled &apos;Yuri-Bawb&apos; says Clark Higgins; &quot;But when I suddenly saw the Red CD out of the boxes that day - In October of 1 99 4 from Rainbow Records in Los Angeles - ,...I was horrified to see that they called the Song &quot;Irie Bob&quot;,..I just laughed in horror because the CD was all printed and all done !! And it seemed to be promoting all that 420 Marijuana culture cliche crap,....&apos;Something I personally never wanted any part of in my life,....but now after 17 years,..the name has stuck,...and sometimes people email me,..thinking that I am this pot-head,..because I wrote Irie Bob by G.e. !!! (Laughs) - IRIE BOB Has become a cult classic of G.e. lore what with it&apos;s annoying repetition, distorted bassline, fuzzy guitars (Which Haggins feel need to be turned up more in the final mix), and meandering lyrics and singing which yappily tell the story of a guy who &quot;has been too apathetic,...and thus finally &apos;approached Gold thats gleaming&quot;....all in a 4/4 beat of some of Hagins&apos; best dance beat drumming. This 1 99 2 pop emo song would certainly influence the likes of Beck, Weezer, and others; &quot;When &apos;Irie&apos; was all done and recorded, I just loved the whole &apos;feel&apos; of this little tune,..it was so built around it&apos;s beat and chorus,....Recording Engineer Bill Krodel did an incredible great job at Jet City Sound Studios in El Segundo,....I played all the instruments on this thing myself ,..except then, I got Billy to come in and add these keyboards,..which today - turn out to be the &apos;key&apos; as to why this song is so killer !! I would direct Billy on which sound to implement on the synth,....all the keyboards were always my call with G.e. - though there are many in the South Bay today who try to say that Billy did everything for me,...thats NOT true at all,...Bill Krodel let bands do their own thang,...though he did put in alot of input,...I always had the final calls,...the silly 1960&apos;s keyboards here were entirely my doing,....I dreamed up all my songs,...my songs are good ,..not because of alcohol or drugs like many in the South Bay try to say,...they are good songs simply because I am creative,..and I have been since i was four years old when I drew all those &apos;paintings&apos; at 251,...&quot; Irie Bob, Like all G.e. material Would be rejected by the Program directors at KROQ back in it&apos;s day; &quot;Well,..I would painstakenly try to set up appointments with KROQ Radio Fm programming way back then and they would just say that my songs suck,....I would give them all my tapes,...and nothing would happen,...I would follow up and call back but it was pointless,...thats just the way it is in music industry - even way back then in 1 99 2 and 94&apos;,....you simply &apos;had&apos; to have some kind of major label affiliation in order to achieve FM Airplay,...so thus, songs like IRIE BOB and BRANDY,....NEVER saw their potential back in their day,....I couldn&apos;t do it all alone,....nevermind the fact that I had all the shit goin&apos; on with Bam Magazine and all. Today, IRIE BOB has racked up Great &apos;views&apos; numbers at Google, Mefeedia, and other websites as it is simply one of cyberspace&apos;s catchyest little secrets. - Originally Recorded September - November 1 99 2 and Appears as part of the 1 99 2 &quot;Big Teen Dollar$&quot; album cd. Produced By Clark Hagins and Bill Krodel. Greenhouse Effect Photos - ?µe???? ???s??? Rock s?????t?µa &quot;fa???µe?? t?? ?e?µ???p???&quot; t?a???d?a.Description1 99 ,403 Views - ?µe???? ???s??? Rock s?????t?µa &quot;fa???µe?? t?? ?e?µ???p???&quot; t?a???d?a. - &quot;Misogynistia&quot; is the Great Song that is heard thousands of times a day in 2007 for G.e. - This August 1 99 2 Song was recorded right around the same day as &quot;Five Years&quot; (Which sounds nothing like Miso) and the epic classic &quot;Addicted&quot;. These Songs would compile the September 1 99 2 &quot;Big Teen Dollar$&quot; CD that Clark Hagins Would issue through Massachusett&apos;s Label &quot;Rock City Records&apos; as well as on sale locally in Redondo Beach at Goboy Records and Mark Theodore&apos;s Alternative Groove Store in Hermosa Beach. &quot;BIG TEEN DOLLAR$&quot; Would be recorded in Early September 92&apos; with Sound Recording Engineer Of the South Bay Bill Krodel at Jet City Sound Studio in El Segundo Ca. &quot;BTD&quot; Would be a cultural and Lyrical triumph for Haggins as he belittled and attacked Music industry Standard Barers from Kurt Cobain to Henry Rollins to Sammy Hagar to Def Leppard and Bon Jovi too; &quot;BTD&quot; is definitely one of my favorite songs ,..just for how silly and retardedly angry and ironic it is&quot; says Hagins. &quot;Misogynistia is like the anti-dote to BTD,...IT IS just like such a cheesey confused song from 1973 by the Who or Chicago ,..or maybe 80&apos;s-like Duran,...the Song is so serious where-as BTD is absolutely toungue n cheek and DEFINITELY &apos;NOT&apos; !!&quot;......&quot;Writing Sarcastic funny songs from &quot;Star&quot; to &quot;Ben is dead&quot; to &quot;Hey Negrita&quot; in early 91&apos; had prepared me for some of my ultimate Songwriter moments,...and these would be among my final recordings as I had run out of money by late 92&quot; Says Higgins - &quot;Waiting 4 Your Love 2 Fail!&quot; explodes with brutal anger, punk speed, angry passion, technical guitar and drumming and plenty of Angst from the World&apos;s Most watched band; Redondo Beach California&apos;s Powerful Greenhouse Efect !!!!! Guitarist Phil Keegan (Dr. Phil) blazes a revolutionary hard rock guitar path here that no other band after the Mighty G.e. could quite copy or capture (Nevermind keep up with !!) .... Clark Hagins pours every ounce of his tortured angry soul into the chilling lyrics and bassist Rick Carmody hangs on for the ride !! - &quot;So Much Better&quot; or Simply &quot;Better&quot; is an &apos;ahead of it&apos;s time&apos; G.e. Song From November 1 99 2 that would also effectively function as quite possibly the last ever idea that Greenhouse Effect and Clark Hagins would ever record. &quot;The Bam Magazine Scandal devestated our band, ruined my concerts, and shook our group&apos;s confidence to the core,...Our bassist Rick Carmody left and soon joined up with the South Bay Redondo Beach Punk band &apos;The One Handed Readers&apos; says Clark Higgins in January 2010 from his offices in San Diego&apos;s &quot;North County&apos; where today he is a full-time Swimming Pool cleaner,...a job that Hagins says &apos;pays the bills&apos; in the household with just him and his wife; &quot;My life is nothing today,...People say that back in the 90&apos;s I shoulda been a huge Star,...after G.e. flamed out,...I turned more and more to alcohol and by 95&apos;,...I felt my life was technically &quot;Over&quot; up there in Bel Air ,..where I was a Professional Landscaper,...people and other organized bands would still call me, wondering if G.e. was ever coming back,..or if I was ever gonna start throwing concerts again,...but I couldn&apos;t get my psyche into it,...in 96&apos;..i took my Swimming Pool cleaning job with A To Z Pool and Spa in Torrance Ca,..when I moved back down there to the South Bay, ..thats when I knew music for me was over,...I tried to get some people into my shit or to help me but no one would,..nobody cared,...I financed the Rock Opera &quot;White Suburban Liar$&quot; all by myself in 95&apos;,...&apos;put it on sale at GoBoy in Redondo,...but I was 30 years old and not in an active playing band,..man, ..it was over,...I couldn&apos;t do it without Carmody,..atleast I knew I had to have him there&quot;. - Today, Greenhouse Effect explode on the internet (and at itunes) with their old tracks like 1 99 1&apos;s &quot;Brandy&quot; but Hagins calls the scene of music today &quot;al most pointless&quot;. &quot;You got bands like Green Day and Foo Fighters and all their songs sound the same,..they are completely boring people who have never suffered or been picked on in their lives,...they are robotic and their music reflects this,...Dave Grohl is like some jock on a football team,...that guy is &apos;NOT&apos; Rock n roll at all,..yet today, he passes for like as if he is Great like Pete Townshend and the Who or Zeppelin or something,...its disgusting,..People today are so fucking stupid and addicted to drugs and video games,...they don&apos;t know shit about fucking piss ass nothing !! Music sucks now,..and thats all there is to it,..I think Rap music is pathetic....People hear my music,..and suddenly, they hear a trully fucked up person who is &apos;really authentically&apos; fucked up,...thats why I work with a large World audience,...people will never understand what i went through as a child,....but when you hear Greenhouse Effect music,...you suddenly hear it all crystal clear !! I&apos;m a Great drummer and a great guitarist who &apos;got that way&apos; because I had no friends,...I had nothing else to do,...I didn&apos;t fucking learn shit in a book like Dave Grohl,....that guy is not the last of 8 kids,...fuck that guy,..he doesn&apos;t know shit about shit !!&quot; Hagins says that his number one goal and desire would be to see Barack Obama impeached from Office; &quot;If me and my music can play a small part in getting Democrats un-elected,..and getting people out there to &apos;learn&apos; about rightwing politics,..and to stop voting for these assholes,..then that is Great and more power to &apos;THAT&apos;,...DEMOCRATS ARE ELITEST TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO RAISE TAXES AND STEAL YER MONEY,...I&apos;m not saying Republicans are all that much better or different,...but they are definitely the lesser of two evils,.....I think that drugs are one of the most serious evils of our Western culture,...We need tougher laws to stop people from using them,...People get high on weed and then they simply naturally are gonna vote for evils and snobs like Your typical Democrat type person,...&apos;when I hear some fucker in a suit and tie say that he wants to &apos;help&apos; people out there,...well, to me,...that is an immediate code RED FLAG word for he wants to &apos;rule&apos; and be bigger, more important, and better - &apos;OVER&apos; the people,...!! Because he is an insecure piece of shit !! Used car salesman,..and ,..like some Leo mother-fucker,...he naturally knows how to get over on people,....I DON&apos;T WANT ANYONE FUCKING HELPING ME,....I HELP MYSELF THANK YOU !!&quot; Hagins says that people need to get &apos;properly educated&apos; and learn to stop voting for socialist minded individuals at all cost. &quot;I practically virtually feel that we need to &quot;Outlaw&quot; people from saying that they are running for office because &apos;they want to help people - FUCK THAT,...THEY TAKE THE POWER AND CREATIVITY &apos;AWAY&apos; from the individual - thats what they are really trying to do - period - THEY ARE TYRANTS IN SUITS !!&quot; ============================ In September 2009, Greenhouse Effect achieved a very important personal goal for Los Angeles Top Musician Clark Hagins. The Goal you ask ?? 10,000 Twitter Followers. &quot;We got our 10,000th Twitter follower at One of our many Twitter accounts, but in reality, We really have over 63,000 Followers because we have like 33 different accounts,...its hard work&quot; says Hagins. The pressure is always on Haggins because he is probobly Los Angeles&apos;s &quot; Most seen&quot; musician along with his other bandmates Bassist Rick Carmody and others as his band is always loaded at the very tops of all search engines with the Net&apos;s Top tracks of indie music from &quot;Brandy&quot; to the classic &quot;22nd Street&quot; and &quot;Coke Snortin&apos; Love Boyz&quot;. &quot;We get seen alot - way more than any other band,...its attracted the attention of several Cable TV Networks,..among them Halogen and others,...People want us to go do a brand new album but I am now nearly 50 years old and I am a swimming Pool cleaner kinda stuck in &apos;that&apos; life,..I doubt seriously today that I could pull off another song like &quot;Brandy&quot; in the studio although I am very intrigued by this new idea for &quot;The Famous on TV&quot;,...thats this new track I&apos;ve been fuckin&apos; around with...&quot; Hagins says that the Potential for the Halogen Tv Show could produce a windfall of itunes mp3 music sales for G.e. that the band badly needs; &quot;Well,..My wife and I ,..we watch alot of Halogen Tv here with our new Cable Company Time Warner Cable in San Diego&apos;s North County,..I could really improve their Tv network,..it needs to be more gritty and hip and there is nothing more hip online with people than G.e.&quot; 10,000 Twitter Followers isn&apos;t a small thing in an era where some of Mtv&apos;s biggest Hip Hop artists only have 900 or so; &quot;We are a big band online,...we are like this huge phenomenon where websites and businesses fight to link and exchange with us or just be word associated with us,...you know yer big when even porn wants to be near you&quot; says Hagins. &quot;I&apos;ve been tryin&apos; to convince Halogen Tv to let me do it all my way and let me be 100% completely in charge of my project,...They will get big ratings if they listen to me&quot; says Higgins. - Guitarist Clark Haggins Blogs about his band&apos;s ability to get &apos;heard&apos; on the Web and the importance of Jango Internet Radio and other Web Radios such as Pandora. &quot;The key to something Like Jango.Radio or Last.Fm, Pandora, and all these is ya gotta have good songs first and fore most ,.....if yer Songs suck, then its really not gonna matter what you do. You gotta have a good recording too. If you have a song or a demo that sounds like a piece of shit,...then Jango and alot of these are probobly not gonna wanna play it,...and even if they did,...a potential new &quot;Fan&quot; or Twitter follower is probobly gonna wanna change the channel,..just like a TV....&quot; - For many consecutive years, the Greenhouse Effect Song &quot;Brandy&quot; (and other songs of theirs) have been able to fight their way to the tops of search engines and into constant rotation at Jango and Pandora. &quot;Our Song sells itself,...because it&apos;s a great song,..we got lucky there when we wrote that one,...alot of people say that it doesn&apos;t even sound like a typical Greenhouse Effect Song,...but then again,..what does ??&quot; says Hagins. &quot;I would recommend at Jango, if yer an artist there,...don&apos;t let people just &apos;play&apos; yer song at yer profile,..instead rather,..let them &quot;add&quot; it,...that way , you will get into more playlists and stations,..you will become &apos;preferred&apos; more,...it will add up to ALOT of Airplay&quot; Hagins and the band&apos;s Management Team say that &quot;Brandy&quot; is responsible for &quot;about 75%&quot; of G.e&apos;s success in cyberspace. &quot;We are known primarily for one song,...but we got other good tunes,..its not like we&apos;re a complete one hit wonder on here,...When people see me in the street, they always comment on Brandy but some have said it&apos;s really not our best Song in reality,..but it &apos;is&apos; the one that the web seems to like and that Jango and Pandora seem to &apos;use&apos; to get listeners to their network sites,....I would advise bands to stick firmly with just one indie radio site,...Jango is the biggest and the best,..it is sorta like a version of Myspace or Youtube in it&apos;s own rite,...Pandora forces you to &apos;mail them&apos; a cd and as we all in bands know - &apos;that&apos; is a big hassel,....at Jango,...you just upload songs,..its easy,...its sorta like i-sound or Sound.cloud ,..or one of those,...all of those millions of little &apos;indie&apos; so called web radio sites are sorta a waste of time,....yer better off just sticking at Jango,...if you get into a zillion different little sites - and i mean places like Echoboost,..well,..if you got alot&apos;a money sittin&apos; around to burn ,...then maybe,...but i think it&apos;s more likely that you&apos;ll just go insane at night,....just get yer band onto Jango Radio,...and stick with one -&apos;that&apos; one !!&quot; Haggins says that Last.FM has in recent years become kind of a hassel. &quot;I used to love LAST.FM but they mix bands profiles together and they do some weird shit,..i admit that i rarely go there really anymore,...there and Pandora&quot;... - Hagins says that if You are an indie band that the odds of getting on to a Real Fm dial Radio Station like KROQ FM or KLOS FM In Los Angeles are at best slim to none. &quot;Alot of those so called &apos;real&apos; radio stations are just shills for the Record Labels , lawyers, and Hollywood,..theres alot of shady shit goin&apos; on where there are back room &apos;pay offs and payola&apos; no better than back in the 60&apos;s,...I&apos;m sorry but thats just the way it is and reality.....it would be great if you can manage to get your band played on them,...but you probobly gotta be on some major label or lndie label that gets big cred and respect,...but i would say that a good band that likes it&apos;s own independent sound and image would have to adapt and change too much,....and that can be a bad thing,...all in the name of airplay,..its not worth it ,...but....theres really Great good news though now !! - These days in 2009 and 2010, the ratings for real FM Dial Radios have really fallen,...infact many of them are struggling to stay afloat and are going off the air too ... ,..EVERYDAY,.....THE REALITY IS now, more people listen to Jango Radio than they do listen to a station like say KROQ FM,....ALOT of new bands are really gettin&apos; discovered and getting their sound &apos;out-there&quot;,....I would say that technically, its probobly more important to have a hit song at Jango than at KLOS, POWER 106, or Kroq FM,....because now, nobody is listening to those three anymore,...not nearly as much anyway,...the web has taken over,..as a vehicle,...plus things like Talk Radio on the AM DIAL in people&apos;s cars - Stuff Like Michael Savage and Hannity,....nevermind the fact that alot of today&apos;s pop music sucks,..I mean just watch the Grammys if ya don&apos;t believe me,...it all sounds the same and it&apos;s boring,...things like Rap music have been a God-send to guys like me,...people get sick of Rap and they listen to Songs like Brandy by Greenhouse Effect - So it all works out well&quot; ---------- &quot;22nd Street&quot; is the Soaring classic from G.e&apos;s 1 99 1 epic cd &quot;Going Legit&quot; which was an album Simply recorded by Haggins and Bassist Rick Carmody alone in the studio; &quot;They Shoulda just signed me long ago&quot; says Hagins &quot;Now,..I&apos;m one pissed off hombre,......I won&apos;t stop until i take over EVERYTHING,.....I see my Google Stats n shit at Webilizers,...I get big plays,...it gives me alotta fuckin&apos; confidence,....I know I got good shit&quot; - Rock City Productions Pro Management SuperNetCelebrities.Com ============== &quot;Big TEEN Dollar$&quot; is the Hillariously ironic Song and anthem from August 1 99 2 that Clark Hagins wrote over the long hot 92&apos; summer while mowing lawns &quot;up in Bel Air&quot; and &quot;talking to himself&quot; for inspiration and &quot;coaching&quot;; &quot;Bel Air was a very beautiful place,...I worked for this wealthy Arab at Owlwood Estates - thats where Tony Curtis and Sony and Cher once lived,....and Jane Mansfield lived next door at the big &quot;Pink House&quot; on Carolwood,...at the time, Englebert Humperdink lived there next door,....and Marylin Monroe once lived in our Dog House,..where we kept the German sheperds,...Molly, Marko, and Midnight,....Some people suggested that her ghost was in there (Laughs),....I remember those beautiful hot Beverly Hills afternoons and drinking my 40 of beer....I don&apos;t drink now though,..i&apos;m 45 years old,...&quot; - Backing Vocals ; Jeff Crisfield, Bill Krodel, Mark Nathanson - Remainder; Clark Hagins. Idea for Song conceived in Redondo Beach at 251. Lyrics @ www.LyricsMode.Com - SuperNetCelebrities.Com ===================== Hagins admits that websites Like Blip Tv allow Over-self indulgent bloggers like himself to fully &apos;create&apos; their own arenas and that unlimited blogging spaces are a Heaven ; &quot;Vimeo and BlipTV are awesome incredible things,....I can really vent my spleen thoroughly,...and ofcourse many people read,..and thats the goal,...to get them reading,..then they go to my other sites, ..or Youtubes,...and then they go to itunes,..and they buy,....the bottom line is they get interested in me and my music,...and they get to read alot,...it gets them more intelligent,...its way MORE educational than a video game,....Video games are something that Democrats cooked up so you will just sit there and be a moron and smoke pot and be a fucking idiot,....and thats how people like Barack Obama and other Democrats get voters,...they create their own pool of morons THAT THEY CAN EASILY CONTROL,.....I would prefer to get the intelligent, more informed votes of hard working American people ,...People like electricians and or Swimming Pool People,...they tend to be way more informed and intelligent because alot of them listen to Dr. Michael Savage in their trucks during the day as they work - Him and Mark Levin talk radio too.&quot; - &quot;Wilson Phillips&quot; comes barrelling out of the Speakers as a heavy Black Sabbath like G.e. Anthem of hard rock. &quot;Ted told me on the phone one day about 1 99 5 that he thought that &apos;newer G.e.&apos; wasn&apos;t as heavy and was too &quot;Happy&quot;,...man,...I guess he was referring to stuff like &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;Irie Bob&quot;..., i just fuckin&apos; laughed at that shit,...I think Ted just started to smoke too much pot and it fried his head !! Clark Hagins blogs that his &apos;ideas&apos; for society and his ability to &apos;copy and re-paste entire blogs elsewhere&apos; is as important as the music itself ; &quot;Shit like Tubemogul can be awesome,....Everybody knows that I don&apos;t do all this writin&apos; shit so much for the music,..infact, I really don&apos;t even give a rat&apos;s ass about the music so much as I care about getting my politics and society philosophies across to the general public,.....Greenhouse Effect was always about being political,....We were good irish boys who went to church and who had fears,....but then others in the world would come and try to corrupt us,...and try to make us be like everybody else - to conform,....I say ; fuck that,....I keep the same shit that I was at 16 and 23 today still at 44; I am an old fashioned conservative - what-ever that means,....I&apos;m against abortion and Gay marriage and legalizing or promoting lame drugs that I know destroy great minds,...you can write better shit whilst sober !! I listen to Michael Savage,...and if people don&apos;t like it,..then what the fuck,...they can suck my cock&quot; - Tags - tagcloud, asher roth, politics, lil wayne, eminem, asher roth, susan, mel gibson, brandy, wayne gretzky, kroq most played, paramore, muse, radiohead, tom delonge, weezer, pork, hole tour, hip hop, bmo, brandy, lmfao, sky blu fox, cnn, smokey robinson, michael savage radio ------------ ============ The exciting Greenhouse Effect are the New &quot;Nirvana&quot; of the internet for these times of the new millineum of 2008, 09, and 2010 !! Great Songs that evoke melody of the 1960&apos;s and bands like the Mersey Beats to the Sounds of the 70&apos;s and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer to Zeppelin !! High Melody is always G.e&apos;s aim !! This little Redondo Beach three piece band has spread their music all around the World like no other band in History !!

 Touched!

In the 1980s, Jean Baudrillard, an obtuse but occasionally lucid postmodernist, wrote a book called America in which he noted some eerie goings-on. “This is a culture,” he wrote with alarm, “which sets up specialized institutes so that people’s bodies can come together and touch.” I remembered Baudrillard’s remark as I toured the Touch Research Institute in Miami, with its goal of eradicating strife and sickness globally.

In the 1980s, Jean Baudrillard, an obtuse but occasionally lucid postmodernist, wrote a book called America in which he noted some eerie goings-on. “This is a culture,” he wrote with alarm, “which sets up specialized institutes so that people’s bodies can come together and touch.” I remembered Baudrillard’s remark as I toured the Touch Research Institute in Miami, with its goal of eradicating strife and sickness globally.

For an organization that intends to save the world through massage, its facilities are small. Headquartered in a building on the University of Miami’s School of Medicine campus, the Institute occupies a single tiny office crammed with mazy grey cubicles. I went there for a tour. Tiffany Field, the head of the Institute, greeted me at the door wearing a lab coat and a warm smile. She looked to be in her 50s, but wouldn’t disclose her age. She had long brown hair down her back, deeply tanned skin, and thick racetracks of eyeliner around her eyes.

The Touch Research Institute was founded in 1 99 2 on the whimsy of the CEO of Johnson&amp;Johnson, Jim Burke. At the time, he sat on the board of 30 other corporations, a feat worthy of titans like JP Morgan and John Rockefeller. But he was no heartless, top-hatted capitalist. In fact, he had a bizarre and heartwarming utopian vision: to “cure the world of war and disease” through touch.

Jim Burke approached Field while she was working at the University of Miami. With a Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from the University of Massachusetts, Field had pioneered early research into the potentially vital effect of a mother’s touch on the growth of infants. Burke was impressed by those studies and decided to entrust his utopian project with Field. He gave her a grant of $250,000. In collaboration with faculty at the University of Miami and Duke’s School of Medicine, Field turned the money into the Touch Research Institute. Further funding came through the National Institute of Health, which donates hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to the Institute annually.

The Touch Research Institute claims that massage therapy is a palliative for al most all bodily ailments. To demonstrate this healing power, Field handed me over to her assistant for a free massage. Soft-spoken and gentle, the assistant had just returned from a wedding in Mexico at the height of swine flu. She led me through a hall, past “Cytogenetic” laboratories unrelated to the Institute, into a darkened, disused boardroom. She directed me to undress to my boxers and lay down on a massage table.

Swine flu carrier or not, she was an effective masseuse. In the last few minutes I drifted into a magical, half-awake, nirvana-like state. I left the Touch Research Institute with looser muscles and a bounce in my step. I felt like I was prancing on the moon. But I had been underwhelmed by the Institute’s office, and learnt little about their underlying research. It appeared to me that two doctors were running a massage parlor out of a shady boardroom. And the effect of the massage wore off in no time, as the stresses of the day reclaimed me. Could these fleeting, pleasant feelings substantially boost the immune system in HIV patients or prevent premature birth in pregnant woman? The Touch Research Institute says so.

Undermining its credibility, the Institute has embraced the whole dubious gamut of alternative medicine. On its website, it has compiled studies — conducted both by the Institute and other researchers — on massage therapy, music therapy, aromatherapy, acupuncture, Tai Chi, and Yoga. They invariably point to the same conclusion: that these methods are medicine. One study conducted by Tiffany Field claims that the brain chemistry of teenage girls is improved by rock music.

Another study concluded, in a blizzard of scientific jargon, that listening to Mozart can reduce skin allergies to latex. Asked about that study, James Randi flatly called it “bullshit.” “Unless it was done double-blind,” he said, “we have nothing to work with.” The Mozart experiment wasn’t done double-blind, but it did include a control group that listened to Beethoven. Quirkily, in the world of music therapy, Mozart’s music is presumed to have healing power, whereas Beethovens’s music (and the music of all the Romantic composers after him) is considered a placebo.

Field is particularly interested in the smell of lavender, which her studies in aromatherapy show has a certain je-ne-sais-quoi . “I don’t know what it is about lavender, but it relaxes you, it lowers your heart rate, it brings your brain waves in a direction of higher alertness,” she says. Stephen Macknik, a neuroscientist at the Barrow Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, one of the largest neuroscience hospitals in the world, is skeptical. “I study olfaction and I’m not aware of any credible evidence to suggest aromatherapy improves cognitive function whatsoever.” When pressed, Field concurs. “It has no proven health benefits,” she admits, a little sadly, on the phone.

For all their work in alternative medicine, Field and her team have focused mainly on massage therapy. Since 1 99 2, the Institute has corralled groups of patients at hospitals on the UM campus and experimented on them with massage. Often enough, the studies come to the banal conclusion that massage lowers stress. That’s a statement of the obvious, but it’s nothing to sniff at: Stress is caused primarily by a hormone called cortisol, which is known to fetter the immune system and “do damage to the body and brain,” as Macknik confirms. So relieving stress could strengthen the immune system and the body as a whole.

If all of Field’s studies are to be believed, however, massage therapy helps with just about anything and everything, starting alphabetically with aggression, Alzheimer’s, anorexia, anxiety, arthritis, asthma, ADHD, autism, behavioral problems in preschoolers, blood pressure, breast cancer, bulimia, burn victims, cancer, carpal tunnel syndrome, celebral palsy, chronic fatigue symptom, cocaine exposure in infants, cognition (learning), cystic fibrosis, depression, diabetes, down syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, HIV, hypertension, job stress, labor pain, leukemia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, preterm birth, posttraumatic stress, premenstrual syndrome, sexual abuse coping, sleep, spinal cord injuries, organ transplants, and even voice disorders.

That litany could well be a bill of goods, but Field emphasizes that massage is a complementary treatment and not a cure. Macknik, the neuroscientist at the Barrow Institute, reviewed some of their studies and said, “It looks like these are real — the only problem is that a lot of them aren’t double blind, which is what I want to see if I’m to redirect my research in their direction. These are what we call preliminary studies, which need to be redone double-blind.”

Field protests that double-blind studies are impossible in massage therapy. “We can only approximate double-blindness by having two different pressure massages — light pressure, which we know to be ineffective, and moderate pressure massage. The groups don’t know which one is effective or which treatment they’re getting. Light pressure massage is as close to a placebo as you get in any kind of live therapy.” It’s a reasonable argument. She further contends, “The only possible studies you can do with double-blind are drug studies, where the pills are the same color and you don’t know that one’s a placebo and one’s not.”

A skeptical, licensed massage therapist in Miami, who asked not to be quoted by name, cast doubt on the distinction between moderate and light pressure massage — a distinction that is the crux of most of the Institute’s research. “You can’t standardize a massage,” he said. He points out that there are numberless varieties of the practice. The standard Western model was promulgated in the 1800s by a Swedish gymnastics instructor and physiologist, Pehr Henrik Ling, who derived what we know as the Swedish Massage from ancient Chinese texts. Adding to that, there are dozens or hundreds of permutations of massage in Asia and across the world. Massages vary individually too. The outcome of a massage depends on the particular strokes employed, the skill of the massage therapist, and the psychology of the patient. The variables pile up. If massage therapy can’t be standardized, then is it viable as an across-the-board medical treatment? Maybe not.

But Tiffany Field and her colleagues at the Touch Research Institute would insist otherwise. The fact is, they purport, that massage therapy can prevent premature birth in pregnant women — and not just reduce it, but eliminate it altogether. “We found that the pregnancy massage lowers cortisol levels and thereby prevents prematurity completely,” Field states matter-of-factly. (Conversely, in ancient China a specialized form of massage was used to induce abortions.) Massage therapy, she says, can also stimulate growth and activity in babies born prematurely: “With moderate pressure massage, we increased premature babies weight gain by 47% and lowered their hospital stay by 6 days and the hospital costs by 10,000 dollars.” TRI has gotten plenty of press attention for those claims.

In 2006, the Touch Research Institute showed up in a Today Show segment on handholding. A couple was interviewed about their paw clutching habits and Field was brought on camera to intone that hand-holding is both romantic and good for your health. Touching, she said in a familiar refrain, applies pressure to the skin, which slows down the heart rate and relieves stress.

It was a strange segment. Why did America need reminding that holding hands is nice? Perhaps it’s that the country has lost touch with itself, so to speak. An American can go months or years without touching another person. Accidental touches in public are avoided strenuously; there seem to be few things more awkward than inadvertently brushing a person’s leg or foot under a restaurant table, for fear it will be interpreted sexually. Litigation, sexual harassment codes, and paranoia about pedophilia have cut down on touch. As Tiffany Field mentions in her book, Touch , in some preschools teachers are banned from giving hugs to students. Technology has also dried up intimacy. So much communication nowadays takes place on networks, leading Baudrillard, the Frenchman, to write: “Interface or interaction… has replaced face-to-face contact and action in America.”

America is neurotic about and deprived of touch. So, in a perverse twist, touch ends up being administered to the population by utopian institutes, bankrolled by the government and the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. The Touch Research Institute in Miami is by far the least ridiculous of these outfits: at Harvard, touch researchers have investigated chakras and “energy fields” and touted the power of Reiki, a Japanese alternative medicine that clinical studies and trials have debunked again and again.

Is massage therapy a legitimate medical science, though? The idea shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand. Hippocrates mandated, “The physician must be experienced in many things, but assuredly in rubbing.” But that was 493 BC. Medical science has come a long way since then. The Touch Research Institute has floated some interesting ideas worthy of further investigation, but their findings are much too mixed up with hogwash about the magic of Mozart and lavender odor. As for war and disease, those banes aren’t going away with more backrubs.
 
 A Mistake, Not a Model -- By: Andrew C. McCarthy

 A fter last Friday night’s bad-news dump about the end of DOJ’s witch hunt against Bush-administration lawyers, you might have thought it impossible for our attorney general to outdo himself. But the redoubtable Eric Holder was right back at it on Monday. He convened a press conference to depict a botched investigation as a model for future counterterrorism and to proclaim this purported triumph as a vindication of the civilian justice system against accusations that had never been made.

The occasion for this bizarre performance was the guilty plea of Najibullah Zazi, entered in Brooklyn federal court. You may recall Zazi as the al-Qaeda-trained would-be bomber who targeted New York City last year on the anniversary of 9/11. (See here and here .) The case should have been a great coup for law enforcement. Alas, investigators interviewed an untrustworthy source, who promptly alerted Zazi that he was under surveillance. Zazi folded up the plot and skipped town. The other players -- and there were several -- vanished before agents could identify them. Zazi was finally arrested after refusing to give up his co-jihadists despite several days of questioning. That is, the government was left with a case against Zazi alone, having failed to identify, much less round up, the other terrorists.

Zazi has now, six months later, pleaded guilty. This is a good thing, and Holder was right to celebrate it. Hopefully, it will mean we can now compel the terrorist to tell us what he knows about the other terrorists -- although one recalls that when the Justice Department tried to compel convicted terrorist Sami al-Arian to tell us what he knows about other terrorists, Yale law student Rashad Hussain complained that al-Arian was being persecuted -- a ft er which the president first hired Hussain as a top staffer and then promoted him to be the administration’s envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference.

In any event, the positive development of Zazi’s guilty plea does not transform the case into a model. To the contrary, it remains a screw-up.



Don’t get me wrong here. The civilian justice system hardly has the market cornered on screw-ups. There are plenty of them in the military justice system, too -- just as there are in intelligence-gathering efforts, and in all human endeavors. Any prosecutor who tells you he’s never screwed up either is lying or was not good enough to be trusted with a challenging case. In a fast-moving investigation, it is always a tough call whether to approach a shady source: Will he break the case wide open, or will he destroy it? Here, investigators rolled the dice and it came up snake-eyes. It was a forgivable bad call -- we’d much rather see our officials make aggressive mistakes than be caught asleep at the switch. But it was still a mistake.

But while the mistake does not condemn the civilian justice system, neither does the guilty plea establish anything conclusive about the effectiveness of the system. Even less does it demonstrate the system’s overall effectiveness against international terrorism.

If I were of a mind to demagogue the matter, as Holder seems determined to do, I suppose I could argue that, because law-enforcement tactics cost us the chance to identify potential terrorists, the Zazi episode shows it is foolhardy to rely on law enforcement. That, however, wouldn’t be true. The FBI did its usual stellar job. It wasn’t the bureau’s fault that another agency jumped the gun. If that hadn’t happened, the Feebs could very well have nabbed seven or eight terrorists red-handed. Next time, it’ll be done right, they’ll have better luck, and no one will be cheering louder than I.

And here is where Holder truly grates. Evidently, it is not enough for him to put the best face on a botched case, as any attorney general would do. He can’t just say, with the right mix of pride and humility, “Hey, it wasn’t pretty, but we stopped the bombing from happening, and now, with this plea, we have a better chance of catching the terrorists who got away six months ago.” No, he can’t help himself: Not only is the screw-up to be understood as law enforcement at its finest, Holder spins the episode, in the words of the Associated Press, to “rebut Republican critics who have said the Democratic administration should try such suspects before military tribunals rather than through civilian courts.” “To take this tool out of our hands” and “to denigrate this tool,” the attorney general declared, “flies in the face of facts and is more about politics than it is about facts.”

When the most political attorney general in history accuses others of playing politics, you know he is projecting his own flaws. After a year, that’s what we’ve come to expect. Al most as depressing, though, is that there’s no subtlety in Holder’s politicking. It’s transparently asinine.

Nobody is “trying to take this tool out of our hands.” Nobody is saying terrorism cases should never be tried in the civilian courts. The point of Bush counterterrorism was to correct the ineffective Clinton model, which treated international terrorism only as a crime, to be handled as such in all cases. It grossly oversimplifies the matter to say that the pre-9/11 error was to prosecute terrorism cases in civilian court. Rather, the error lay in (a) believing that we were dealing with mere crimes rather than a war, (b) therefore believing that all facets of terrorism, including atrocious acts of war, were fit for civilian prosecution, and (c) concluding that we could deter our enemies and protect our citizens with nothing more than civilian prosecution.

It does not “denigrate this tool” to acknowledge that civilian prosecution cannot be the point of the counterterrorism spear. That civilian prosecution should have a subordinate role does not mean it has an unimportant role. It is crucial. Nor does providing alternatives to civilian prosecution denigrate the Justice Department. Before the Obama administration pulled the plug on military commissions, Justice Department lawyers were making invaluable contributions to military-court proceedings. If we were to design a new system for addressing national-security cases, the Justice Department would be front and center in its creation and its operation. This is about learning from our past and designing the optimal approach. It is not about “denigrating” a “tool” that usually, but not always, works quite well.

In fact, we should want lots of terrorism cases -- indeed, most terrorism cases -- to be tried in civilian courts. The idea, though, is that these should be the cases that break up terrorist cells and plots before they materialize into mass-murder attacks. You can’t have a strategy that prevents massacres unless you aggressively use the civilian courts and the very strong Clinton-era anti-terrorism statutes to prosecute early-stage conspiracies like the Zazi episode. (Although it’s also worth noting that, if Zazi had been designated an enemy combatant and interrogated, we could have had the beans he is now spilling six months ago.) You must also exploit the same laws to hound people who provide material support to terrorist organizations -- although, speaking of denigrating an important tool, the attorney general neglects to mention that President Obama is undermining the material-support laws by pandering to Islamist activists who grouse about crackdowns on Muslim “charitable” giving.

No one ever said such cases should not be tried in civilian court. Moreover, no one is saying that terrorism cases involving jihadist cells radicalized in the United States don’t belong in civilian court -- at least presumptively. While those cells are usually inspired by al-Qaeda and its ideology, they are not actually affiliated with the terror network. That means they can be prosecuted in civilian court without risking disclosures of classified information about al-Qaeda that should be avoided during wartime.

The dispute here primarily involves alien enemy combatants affiliated with al-Qaeda who are captured in the act of carrying out, or after carrying out, acts of war against the United States. They are war criminals and should be treated as such. That means trial by the military commissions authorized by Congress, unless and until we come up with something better. And when such operatives are captured in the United States, they should be designated as enemy combatants and interrogated -- without the obstructions of defense lawyers and complications of plea bargaining -- until we are confident we don’t need them anymore. At that point, a decision can be made about whether they should be referred for a military or a civilian trial.

To grasp the perversity of cloaking the most atrocious alien war criminals in the majesty of the Bill of Rights -- to understand that doing so rewards the very targeting of civilians that international humanitarian law seeks to discourage -- is not to oppose all, or even most , civilian terrorism prosecutions. Coming to grips with reality does not disparage the dedicated efforts, day in and day out, of Justice Department prosecutors, FBI agents, and other federal and state police. Many of us were supporting that work, and doing it, while Mr. Holder was helping terrorists get pardons, accusing the United States of war crimes, and working at a firm that volunteered to serve our nation’s enemies free of charge.

Our goal must be to recognize what civilian justice can’t accomplish -- how’s that 1 99 8 indictment of Osama bin Laden working out? -- while fully appreciating what it must accomplish if we are to remain secure. That will give us the right policy. We won’t get there by pretending that mistakes are models and portraying law enforcement’s friends as law enforcement’s foes.

With blatant disregard for the first amendment, Republicans&apos; intolerance of US secularism means things are turning ugly

If you&apos;re part of secular America – that is, if you&apos;re an atheist, an agnostic, a religious liberal or even a mainstream believer who thinks religion should be kept out of politics and vice-versa – then you should be very afraid of what the Republican party has in store for you in 2012.

No news there, you might say. The Republicans, as we all know, have been in thrall to the Christian right since the Reagan era . But there&apos;s something new, something more intolerant, something truly ugly in the works. And if you don&apos;t believe me, let&apos;s start with Tim Pawlenty, unassuming governor of Minnesota in his day job, fire-breathing Christian warrior and aspiring presidential candidate in his spare time.

&quot;I want to share with you four ideas that I think should carry us forward,&quot; Pawlenty said on Friday at the annual gathering of the Conservative Political Action Committee , or CPAC. After invoking &quot;basic constitutional principle and basic common sense,&quot; he continued:

 
&quot;The first one is this: God&apos;s in charge. God is in charge ... In the Declaration of Independence it says we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. It doesn&apos;t say we&apos;re endowed by Washington, DC, or endowed by the bureaucrats or endowed by state government. It&apos;s by our creator that we are given these rights.&quot;
 
Never mind Pawlenty&apos;s fundamental and no doubt deliberate misreading of the founders&apos; intent. (Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, is well-known for having cut up a Bible to remove all supernatural references to Jesus.) How, in practice, does Pawlenty envision &quot;God&apos;s in charge&quot; as a governing principle?

Pawlenty didn&apos;t say. But he oozed mild-mannered hatred for anyone who doesn&apos;t share his beliefs. In a bizarre closing in which he invoked the civil war general (and future president) Ulysses S Grant as some sort of rough-around-the-edges, proto-Tea Party role model, Pawlenty trashed anyone who attended &quot;Ivy League schools&quot; or who go to &quot;chablis-drinking, brie-eating parties in San Francisco&quot;. (You can watch Pawlenty&apos;s address at CSPAN.org , starting at the 1:38:30 mark.) It sounded like a parody of Pat Buchanan&apos;s famous 1 99 2 &quot;culture war&quot; speech . Except that Pawlenty is one of the Republicans&apos; two most plausible candidates for president in 2012.

The other would be former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who fell far short of the prize in 2008, but whose legendary self-discipline has put him in a strong position for 2012.

The trouble is that Romney has already declared war on secular America. In December 2007, you may recall, he delivered a speech in which he defended his Mormon religion at a time when he was under assault from evangelical Christians. It was, in many respects, a sensible plea for religious tolerance.

Except that Romney called for tolerance only among believers, explicitly omitting non-believers. &quot;Any believer in religious freedom, any person who has knelt in prayer to the Almighty, has a friend and ally in me,&quot; Romney said. &quot;And so it is for hundreds of millions of our countrymen: we do not insist on a single strain of religion – rather, we welcome our nation&apos;s symphony of faith.&quot;

As New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote the next day , &quot;Romney described a community yesterday. Observant Catholics, Baptists, Methodists, Jews and Muslims are inside that community. The nonobservant are not. There was not even a perfunctory sentence showing respect for the nonreligious.&quot; Brooks – a conservative, though a secular one – warned that Romney was calling for &quot;a culture war without end&quot;.

Romney and Pawlenty are the early front-runners for the Republican presidential nomination, and it&apos;s a good thing: the most frequently mentioned potential fringe candidates are even worse. If you have not seen Sarah Palin asking God to build a natural-gas pipeline in Alaska, well, do yourself a favour right now (see also her recent speech at the Tea Party convention ). Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, personifies the Christian right in its purest form. &quot;I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ,&quot; Huckabee said in 1 99 8 . There is no reason to think he&apos;s changed his mind.

(I realise that I am leaving out Ron Paul right after he won the CPAC straw poll . As best as I can tell, Paul actually does believe in a secular government. But Paul is a libertarian who&apos;s entirely out of step with the Republican party, regardless of how adept he is at mobilising his devoted followers to pack events like straw polls. He was unable to establish himself as a serious candidate in 2008 , and there&apos;s no reason to think he&apos;ll do any better in 2012.)

Barack Obama, in his inaugural address , said that &quot;our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus – and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth.&quot;

It is that simple, inclusive vision that we&apos;re in danger of losing if Romney or Pawlenty – or, God help us (so to speak), Palin or Huckabee – is elected president in 2012. In truth, the founders made it clear in the first amendment that we need not just freedom of religion, but freedom from religion, especially given that 79% of Americans believe in miracles .

&quot;While we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess, and to observe, the religion which we believe to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to them whose minds have not yielded to the evidence which has convinced us,&quot; wrote James Madison .

In contrast to Madison, the Republicans propose a theocracy of believers. It is an assault not just on anyone who isn&apos;t one of them, but on the American idea, and on liberal democracies everywhere.

Sherri Shepherd, co-host on &quot;The View&quot; and author of &quot;Permission Slips: Every Woman&apos;s Guide to Giving Herself a Break&quot;, discusses how her mother&apos;s death at 41, and her own diagnosis with diabetes , alt
 Embed Code:  Transcript:  
 Todd Hartley: 
Did you know that if your mother, father, sister or brother has heart disease or diabetes your risk of developing diabetes goes way, way up? Well Sherri Shepherd from the hit morning show “The View”, well she knows all about how family history affects diabetes , but she had to find out the hard way. You see, Sherri’s mom passed away at a young age, the young age of 41 and because the apple doesn’t fall far from the diabetic family tree, Sherri grew up and eventually became a diabetic.

To share her story and lessons learned, “The View” Sherri Shepherd joins me right now on EmpowHER. Hi, Sherri.

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Hi, how are you Todd? Good to talk to you.

 Todd Hartley: 
Sherri, it’s an honor to talk with you. Your big discussion topic in my family, my mom every morning, while having breakfast, watches “The View” and it’s a real treat to get to talk with you. Can you talk with me about your oldest memories that surround diabetes ?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Oh wow! My oldest memories of diabetes is people in my family who were diabetic who have, I had an aunt that was blind, I knew people on the block who had had amputations but, knowing that it’s, even still with them having diabetes and in my family we didn’t call it diabetes , we called it “the sugar” and knowing that they had “the sugar,” they would still come up to the table and get, you know, sweet potatoes and pies and cakes, and macaroni and cheese and we just thought it was normal. We just went, “Oh, you know, they got ‘the sugar’,” and eventually somebody would get an amputation or you know, like in my mother’s case at 41, passed away, you know, and nobody really did anything about it. We just went on life as normal.

 Todd Hartley: 
I have an unbelievable sweet tooth craving and the only way that I can keep it under control is that if I just let it know who’s boss. In your book, “Permission Slips: Every Woman’s Guide to Giving Herself a Break,” it’s really, really funny. Great read. You wrote, “Diabetes was the only thing that kept me sane for a while. I was experiencing stress that brought me to my knees and prayer and agony nearly everyday. In fact, if I didn’t have diabetes I would weigh al most 400 pounds right now.”

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Yeah.

 Todd Hartley: 
Can you talk with me about how diabetes , you know, in a bizarre way, as it may sound, how diabetes kept you sane?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
You know why? Because having diabetes every single day I have to make a choice and look at what I am putting in my mouth because everything that I put in my mouth affects my body, and if I did not have diabetes as a safeguard, because I also write in my book that everybody from my church always wants to go and go. I am going to pray that god takes it away, and I say, “No, please don’t pray that. Diabetes is something that really helps me keep eating healthy food. Diabetes is something that keeps me exercising.” So I say that to say if I didn’t have it, I probably would be going to a fast food restaurant ordering a number six super size right now.

 Todd Hartley: 
Sure.

 Sherri Shepherd: 
But I know that because I have diabetes it’s so important for me to eat right and maintain a healthy lifestyle because I got a little boy who is four years old, who looks at me and he expects his mother have some sense, you know? And he doesn’t know anything about diabetes . He just knows he wants his mommy to hug him, feed him and put him to bed at night.

 Todd Hartley: 
Yeah, that’s a big responsibility. You also wrote in your book that “diabetes forced me to see food as fuel, which is no fun.” How is food and exercise decisions changed how you take care of your health?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Well, I tell you what. You know, one of the things I used to eat before I got the diagnosis of diabetes was, I don’t know how you are as a man, but, you know women, we are very emotional and when I went through anything emotional, a big bowl of pasta and a fork was all I needed to get through the night. That was my, you know, thing that would put me in a euphoric state.

As a diabetic you don’t need to be in a euphoric state and I would eat stuff to just make me feel good but I realized that I had to let that kind of stuff go because I didn’t feel good afterwards. My blood sugar level was through the roof after eating a bowl of pasta and so I had to give up, you know, certain things like that and it was a bummer, you know, when you are used to eating certain foods. It was a real big bummer and that’s why I was just really excited because I found a product, which is Dreamfields pasta, and I found that that pasta had five grams of digestible carbs and it had five grams of fiber and I am very leery about eating pasta because as a diabetic, you really have to look at your carb content. You have to look at your sugar content, and people would try to say, “Oh Sherri, eat the whole wheat pasta”, and I don’t know about you; whole wheat pasta tastes like cardboard.

 Todd Hartley: 
It sure does and the recyclable cardboard, I mean not even the good stuff.

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Not even the good stuff so if you like, if you don’t mind putting marinara over some corrugated boxes, you know, God bless you, and so I haven’t had pasta, which is one of my favorites, for a few years and I tried this pasta from Dreamfields. I was a little leery. I pricked my finger and, you know, took my blood sugar level before I started. It was okay. I ate it. Two hours later I pricked my finger again and I saw that my blood sugar level had gone up slightly but it wasn’t all over the place, which is what pasta tends to do because it has a lot of carbs. So I was very excited that I could eat this moderately, you know, in moderation with the salad and I could still do what I needed to do. That it was so good that my son likes it. I could make it for him and we could do our bonding moment over some pasta.

 Todd Hartley: 
You know if your son likes it, if your son can give it a permission slip, right? And your son knows its okay and cool to eat, and it’s good for you, then by all means enjoy it, right?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Absolutely, because, you know, you don’t want to be forced to say, “I can’t eat anything.” You want to find things that and you want to eat it in moderation. So for me, pasta is a big deal. I love pasta. I love, you know, lasagna, so when I found this pasta from Dreamfields that, you know, had the five digestible carbs and didn’t raise my blood sugar and make it go all over the place I said, “Oh my goodness, this is great.”

So, you know, like I said, I eat in moderation and they have a really wonderful website called http://www.diabetesfriendsforever.com , and I tell people, “If you don’t know if you have diabetes or you do have diabetes , this is a great website because it’s very interactive and it tells you,” you know it gives you different tips everyday to maintain your healthy lifestyle, it gives you the signs of what to look for if you think you might be diabetic. So it’s really wonderful working with Dreamfields.

 Todd Hartley: 
You know, it sounds like it’s a lot more effective than praying that God takes it away for you. It’s a lot more proactive and food options is so huge. In your book you talk about god slays Pinkberry and can I read this little part, which I just think is a real gem?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Yes.

 Todd Hartley: 
You wrote – “I knew I was,” and this is about Pinkberry, “I knew I was killing myself and one day I made an announcement on “The View” that I had to stop. Yet right after the show I headed to Pinkberry and I was about 20 feet from the store when God spoke loud and clear and God said, ‘No more Pinkberry,’ and I never heard God thunder before. I have read about such trembling in the Bible, right? But in all conversations I had with God over the years he never made me cower, but as I approached the little yogurt shop, God thundered, ‘No more Pinkberry,’ and this was not the loving advice of the New Testament God. No, this was the fearsome booming command of an Old Testament God. This was the God that drowned every creature on earth save the passengers on Noah’s boat. This was the God who killed every first born Egyptian boy on Passover and this God, well he wanted me to stay the heck out of Pinkberry.”

Talk to me about the food cravings and the Pinkberry addiction and how you really, you know, without God really thundering down, how you take charge?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Wow! That’s so funny. I like that part like I got to get that girl’s book. Pinkberry is a yogurt place. I think they have it out west and you know, you think when you hear yogurt that, oh it’s not ice cream, it’s not Häagen-Dazs® so I can eat as much of it as I want.

 Todd Hartley: 
Right, it’s good for me.

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Yeah, exactly. I had gotten fooled into thinking that, and I would go to this Pinkberry yogurt and I’d get a large Pinkberry yogurt, it’s about 33 grams of carbs and 33 grams of sugar. So that’s all you should have in a day, especially if you are diabetic. I would have three of those. I’d have it when it opens, I’d get it for lunch, and I’d get it right before it closed at 10 o’clock. So you’d go, I am eating 99 grams of sugar and 99 grams of carbs every single day and every single day I am killing myself, you know, but I kept thinking, “Oh it’s yogurt so it’s great,” and I just wouldn’t stop because I got addicted to it.

 Todd Hartley: 
It’s a crack berry.

 Sherri Shepherd: 
It was my crack berry. I couldn’t, because I knew, “You can’t have a cheesecake Sherri, you can’t have Häagen-Dazs®, but you can have yogurt.” So I would neglect to look at the sugar content and slowly I was, my energy level was going down. I couldn’t, I’m sitting at the table doing hot topics; my mental clarity wasn’t together, you know, and I had friends that said, “You’ve got to stop,” but it’s like, I had started and I couldn’t stop and so, the way I said, you know, normally, if somebody says, “God said this to me,” I’d go, “Hmm, you better run,” but for me, I think God had to really shake me by the shoulders. “Stay away,” and it scared me so bad. Look, I have been two and a half years sober from Pinkberry.

 Todd Hartley: 
Congratulations!

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Thank you. I am a person that literally went in there for three for, times a day and sometimes I would get two of them, so I would get more than 100 grams of sugar and carbs. So, I am doing it and not to say that’s not, it’s a great place and I am not saying don’t go to Pinkberry, but if you can, do everything in moderation.

 Todd Hartley: 
Yeah, and if God speaks to you, definitely stay away.

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Yes, if he speaks to you to go, “No more,” than you need to stay away. You need to stop but that’s what that was for. Thanks for reading my passages.

 Todd Hartley: 
Oh it’s so good. It’s just a piece of gold right there. Now every morning my mom, just like women all over the country, she watches “The View” while eating breakfast and probably women like my mom need a little tip on how to talk to their doctor about diabetes . Do you have any guidance for them?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Well I’d say don’t be afraid. I think a lot of people don’t, we’re not proactive in taking charge of our health because we are afraid, and it’s not something you have to be afraid of. It’s quite the opposite. If you find out you can do something about it because a lot of people find out that they are pre-diabetic, which is, it means you are not diabetic, which means you can make the changes before you go over to that, you know, before they give you that diagnosis so if you are proactive you can find out what’s going on.

If you find out you have, it then you can make those changes so that you can live longer and you don’t want to get to the place where, you know what, the signs and symptoms are so bad that all of a sudden now they are talking to you about your foot. You can’t feel your fingers and your toes and now they are talking about amputations, or you got, you know, you’re al most inline for a stroke . So do it before it gets that far and I would say, get a support system around yourself. Get friends who will help you eat healthy. Get a team of doctors because they want to help you. This is something where it’s like, every 20 seconds somebody is diagnosed with diabetes . It’s expensive. It’s expensive health wise. If you can just be proactive, you don’t have to go through all of that stuff.

 Todd Hartley: 
Yeah, you know, you and I, I think have something in common – we both have a tremendous support group around us. Dreamfields health carb pasta is putting together just a wonderful campaign that I’d like to talk with you about. It’s Dreamfields Diabetes Friends Forever campaign where listeners can nominate a diabetes friend who has helped them love and understand, even manage and live with their diabetes . Can we talk about that for a second?

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Absolutely, it’s so wonderful, this campaign, it’s called Diabetes Friends Forever, and if you go on to the Dreamfields pasta website, it’s http://www.diabetesfriendsforever.com , and along with the tips on just healthy living and eating and exercise tips, they have a wonderful contest going because, you know, sometimes it’s those people that don’t get the thanks who help us along and who help us stay strong and, you know, who will say to me, like my DFF, we call them DFF, which is Diabetes Friends Forever. So my DFF goes, “Sherri, put that box of M&amp;Ms down, you know, you don’t need that,” and I love that they love me enough to say that to me and this is a way you can just say thank you to them, just to nominate them and say thank you to them and if they win the contest, Dreamfields pasta will give them a lot of prizes, but if you are anything like me, I love thank yous, I love hugs and kisses, but give me some money. So one of the prizes is cash and in today’s, you know, what we are going through today everybody needs some cash.

 Todd Hartley: 
Yeah, you are so right. Well she is my DFF; she is Sherri Shepherd from the hit morning show “The View”, the author of “Permission Slips: Every Woman’s Guide to Giving Herself a Break.” If you haven’t read it, it’s a great read – fun, easy, short fun stories and if you’d like to nominate a special diabetes friend just go to http://www.diabetesfriendsforever.com and click on the entry form.

Sherri Shepherd, thank you for helping us improve health and change lives.

 Sherri Shepherd: 
Thank you so much.

 Even More Than You Realize, Goldman&apos;s Role In Subprime Mirrored Its Role In The .Com Bubble

 (This guest post originally appeared at the author&apos;s blog ) 

So I was reading this article on Bloomberg titled Secret AIG Document Shows Goldman Sachs Minted Most Toxic CDOs . In the article is this gem: 

 The document Issa made public cuts to the heart of the controversy over the September 2008 AIG rescue by identifying specific securities, known as collateralized-debt obligations, that had been insured with the company. The banks holding the credit-default swaps, a type of derivative, collected collateral as the insurer was downgraded and the CDOs tumbled in value. 

 The public can now see for the first time how poorly the securities performed, with losses exceeding 75 percent of their notional value in some cases. Compounding this, the document and Bloomberg data demonstrate that the banks that bought the swaps from AIG are most ly the same firms that underwrote the CDOs in the first place. 

 I thought to myself … Self, you’ve read this article before! It goes on to tell us how, in the midst of a bubble, Goldman was the largest underwriter of toxic crap that fell a ton, leaving a disaster in its wake. That sounded all too familiar. 

 Well, I may not be able to remember what I had for lunch, but there are some things that I just can’t forget. Even though it’s been nearly a decade, this article from June 2000 ( before the bear market even got going full force) was so profound, that I copied it and pasted it in Word. Good thing, because Bloomberg doesn’t seem to have it on their web site anymore. It’s an article about the last bubble – the internet bubble — and, you guessed it, Goldman was in the middle of it. Here’s the key section: 

 Goldman’s Record 

 Well, consider the following factoid, mined from the Internet database of Hoover’s Inc., which itself went public last July and began trading at $24 and now sells for around $7.50: If you bought one share, at the first trade in the aftermarket, for every Internet IPO that Goldman Sachs has managed since its underwriting of Yahoo! Inc. in April 1 99 6 — some 60 deals in all — you’d have done spectacularly well in less than half a dozen of them (Yahoo, RealNetworks Inc., eBay Inc., DoubleClick Inc.) and you’d at least have come out ahead, so far, in maybe 15 more. 

 As for the rest — about 40 stocks in all — you’d have done so poorly that your entire portfolio would now be down about 8 percent. You’d have been better off leaving the money in a coffee can in the kitchen. 

Read the whole thing below. It’s unbelievably scary how much the housing bubble mirrored the internet bubble. And you ended up with the exact same result as far as the market was concerned. The only difference was that a lot more people had their wealth tied to homes than they did to stocks in 2000. So the fall in housing had a much greater impact on the economy.

One other thing, let this be a lesson to anyone who thinks they have an edge in the market. Whether you’re an individual or a professional math whiz like the geeks at AIG, you’re up against people like this everyday. Their sole goal at work is to legally make money. If that source of money happens to be you, too bad for you.

That means, you have to be better prepared than them. You have to be able to answer, “What is it that the counterparty to my trade knows that makes them want to take a position opposite mine? What do they know that I don’t?” If you can’t answer those questions accurately, then don’t trade. Otherwise, you’ll end up just like the guy who can’t count to six .

– Don

P.S. – I hope Bloomberg doesn’t mind me posting this 10-year-old article, as I couldn’t find a copy on their web site.

Salon.com Typifies Demise of `Content’ IPOs:
 By Christopher Byron Weston, Connecticut, June 20, 2000 (Bloomberg) – 
When the history of the great dot-com investment bubble of 1 99 6-2000 is finally written, surely a few select comments will be heard from some quarter or other regarding the role that Wall Street has played in this game. It’s called How to Fleece the Public and Get Away With It.

This week we’ll drop by for one of our characteristically unwelcome visits with one of the more vivid — and easily grasped — examples of that fleecing: The initial public offering of Salon.com Inc., the San Francisco-based Webzine. This desperately struggling company perfectly encapsulates the failed promise and doubtful future of an entire generation of IPOs in the dot-com “content” space.

These are companies that never should have been taken public in the first place but were dumped on the public anyway. The senseless business theory that lured in the gullible: That advertising alone could support “content” marketing on the Web — this when, in many cases, the advertising and marketing costs of the content companies themselves were greater than the total advertising revenue collected from others.

Worst of all, it was the IPO proceeds from one company that became the ad revenue of the next company — a kind of Wall Street financed merry-go-round in which dot-com startups became little more than a capital transfer mechanism from Wall Street to Madison Avenue. It was all dependent in the end on the continuing flow of funds from the new issue market — a flow that was destined to end sooner or later, and now has done just that.

 Role of Underwriters 

The bad guys in this tale?

Fee-obsessed underwriters who couldn’t say no to seven- and eight-digit commissions, and thereupon set the merry-go-round whirling to create a market for deals that had crash and burn tattooed all over them. The stupidos they preyed upon? Anyone who failed to read — and heed — the exculpatory warnings that came emblazoned across every prospectus: Caution, this deal is going to blow up in your face.

In case you might not be familiar with it, Salon.com is one of the best, most imaginatively written “magazines” on the Web. It routinely publishes such writers as Camille Paglia, my colleague Joe Conason, Garrison Keillor, and many others. The trouble is — this editorially excellent content site for culture and political commentary hasn’t been able to make a dime of profit from Day One, and it’s hard to see how it ever will. The operation’s costs are too high, its revenue is too low, and demand for what it offers the public is simply too limited.

Anyone could have seen these limitations from the moment Salon.com began in business — which is why I wrote over a year ago that the company’s finances were unworkable and that investing in the business would be no different from simply throwing one’s money away.

 Glory Days 

But common sense — and simple arithmetic — didn’t stop Salon.com’s underwriter, W.R. Hambrecht&amp;Co. – from taking the company public in a much-watched IPO, exactly one year ago tomorrow, on June 22, 1 99 9, at $10.50 a share. For a brief and glorious moment a few days later, Salon.com touched an intraday high of $15.12, giving Salon.com a market value of $162 million, as all involved congratulated each other on their collective financial genius … while leaving for another day the annoying problem of what to do when the $24.9 million in IPO proceeds ran out.

And now, al most 12 months later? Well, a lot has happened. All of it was inevitable and easily foreseen, and for Salon.com it all spells disaster. For starters, the entire dot-com sector has crashed and shows no signs of reviving. Meanwhile, the IPO window has slammed shut, and venture capital fund managers have taken their phones off the hook and gone to work in the garden (or maybe to hang themselves). And in the middle of all this, the folks at Salon.com look to be running out of money.

 Falling Down  

In the process, the company’s stock has plunged to as low as $1.25 Friday — a decline of 92 percent from its high, and down 88 percent from its offering price. As of Monday, with its stock trading around $1.30 a share, Salon.com had a value of about $15 million, meaning that the company now faces the threat of de- listing from the Nasdaq National Market for failure to meet minimum tangible assets, net revenue, and market cap standards. The way things are going, the company may soon not even qualify for a Nasdaq SmallCap listing and could wind up being bounced to the OTC Bulletin Board market.

So it’s not surprising that, in a desperate bid to stay in business, Salon.com announced on June 7 that it was firing 9 percent of its staff, while trimming projected spending by 20 percent.

Considering that most of the 13 people being axed are editorial employees, and that the high quality of its editorial content is the only thing Salon.com has going for itself, well, we need not dwell at length on the apparent business acumen of the knuckleheads who are running the company — other perhaps than to suggest that the shareholders would evidently have been better served if the suits in charge had decided to let themselves go instead.

 Roundup of Firings  

Salon.com is hardly the only dot-com now handing out pink slips. In the last month, more than 30 different Internet operations — al most all of them in the business of trying to deliver news, entertainment or other such “content” to consumers — have fired at least 3,500 employees altogether. In some cases, the people let go represented only a handful of the company’s employees; in several cases, they’ve been everyone on the payroll because the companies have gone out of business.

The one thing al most all these companies have in common is the confused, “we’ll figure this out as we go along” nature of their business plans and strategies for actually making money.

Yet Wall Street financed them anyway, and the reason is hardly mysterious: For every dollar raised in an IPO, the underwriter typically gets seven to eight cents.

When Goldman, Sachs&amp;Co. raised $100 million in an IPO for the bizarre iVillage Inc. 15 months ago, $8.4 million went to Goldman and the other underwriters before iVillage ever saw a dime. As for anyone who bought shares at the first trade in the after-market (for $95.88 each) and hung on to them since, why, those luckless souls have seen 94 percent their money disappear.

But you’d better believe the underwriters still have their $8.4 million.

 Goldman’s Record 

How bad has this exploitation of the public been, really?

Well, consider the following factoid, mined from the Internet database of Hoover’s Inc., which itself went public last July and began trading at $24 and now sells for around $7.50: If you bought one share, at the first trade in the aftermarket, for every Internet IPO that Goldman Sachs has managed since its underwriting of Yahoo! Inc. in April 1 99 6 — some 60 deals in all — you’d have done spectacularly well in less than half a dozen of them (Yahoo, RealNetworks Inc., eBay Inc., DoubleClick Inc.) and you’d at least have come out ahead, so far, in maybe 15 more. 

As for the rest — about 40 stocks in all — you’d have done so poorly that your entire portfolio would now be down about 8 percent. You’d have been better off leaving the money in a coffee can in the kitchen.

 What Investors Got 

Instead, if you bought the IPOs of Goldman — the premier underwriter in the business today — you’d be the proud owner of dozens upon dozens of total disasters. Your stock in eToys Inc. would be worth 7 percent of what you paid for it. So would your stock in PlanetRx.com Inc. and InsWeb Corp. You’d have taken a 75 percent haircut on your Webvan Group Inc. stock, on your 1-800- FLOWERS.com Inc., on your NetZero Inc., your Agency.com Inc., your E-Loan Inc., and on and on and on.

And if that’s how you’d have done with the best underwriter in the game, imagine how you’d have fared with any of the rest.

As for Salon.com, the company’s latest financial filings tell it all. In the three months ended March 31, Salon.com’s revenue was $2.6 million, which is triple the year-earlier period — but the base is so low (barely $900,000 in the 1 99 9 quarter) that the magnitude of the increase is al most meaningless. Far more important is the fact that, based on the pattern of the previous quarters, roughly 17 percent of the company’s revenue probably wasn’t cash at all but so-called barter deals (I’ll run your ad for free if you’ll run mine on the same basis — and we’ll both call it revenue).

 Real Revenue 

Take the barter revenue out of the picture, and Salon.com’s actual cash revenue in the quarter was probably only about $2.16 million. During the quarter, production and editorial costs ($2.4 million) alone ate up all that and more. If the company had done absolutely nothing else during the quarter except turn on the lights and pay its monthly rent, payroll and utilities bills ($795,000), it would have been in an impossible hole, spending $1.48 for every dollar of revenue.

But on top of that came another $3.56 million of advertising and marketing costs, net of barter — the budget-busting expense that Salon.com and indeed al most all Web companies have had to incur to promote themselves to the consuming public. Put that into the equation, and Salon spent about $3 for every dollar of revenue.

Is it any wonder that in the January-March quarter the company’s balance sheet cash and investments dropped from just under $24 million to just under $18 million? After all, the company was spending al most $9 million to take in barely $2 million in revenue.

 Money Running Out 

With the company’s own underwriter, San Francisco-based W.R. Hambrecht, now cutting its revenue estimate for the fiscal year ending next March by 30 percent, to $14.3 million — and with at least 17 percent of the net result likely still to be non-cash barter, the company could easily end the year with actual cash revenue below $12 million. Against that, Hambrecht is projecting $33 million of cash costs, meaning a cash shortfall of $21 million. With only $18 million of cash on hand to cover it, the company looks set to be stone-broke within five quarters — and that includes the savings from the June 7 cuts.

To drag out the inevitable, there will doubtless be more firings, and more cutbacks, until the quality of the Salon.com editorial product is so ravaged that no one will want to read it anymore.

So, why, we may ask, was this business started in the first place? So that a group of talented writers and commentators could perform like barking seals for a year or two, while an obscure San Francisco underwriting shop bagged $1.3 million in underwriting fees even as their own clients got hosed? This is the New Paradigm? If so, you can have it.

It is open season on climate scientists, but such hand-wringing has allowed the creeping rehabilitation of climate scepticism

So the case is closed. The release of private emails between climate scientists at the University of East Anglia that show malpractice and conspiracy have had their effect. Public acceptance of the reality of global warming has dipped, politicians are retreating and changes to how science is done and scientists behave are required.

I do not accept this. I believe this seductively simple narrative is based on ignorance, scientific illiteracy and hypocrisy. Worse, it is dangerous and will erode the very public confidence it seeks to restore.

This is perhaps not a common view right now. In newsrooms up and down the country, scandal and hand-wringing are afoot and it is open season on climate science and climate scientists.

 Inquiries are under way and if scientists are found guilty of misconduct they should be sacked. If scientific results change as a result, then the corresponding academic papers should be corrected or withdrawn. But if this sorry affair is remembered in a year or so for anything other than yet another attempt to smear the people involved, only then will I accept its significance.

Take the influence on public opinion. A recent BBC poll revealed the number of Britons who believe in climate change has dropped from 44% to 31% since November. A Guardian editorial blamed this on events at East Anglia , a link that was reinforced in a news story. But the poll results do not show this. In fact, they show the opposite. Yes, the decline in overall acceptance is clear, but the pollsters also asked whether respondents had seen media reports of flaws and weaknesses in climate science. Some 57% said yes, and these people were questioned further: have these reports made you more or less convinced of the risks of climate change. Al most three-quarters, 73%, said it made no difference. And while 11% said, yes, the controversies had made them less concerned about the risks, 16% said the reports of flaws and weaknesses had made them even more concerned.

The evidence shows that the battle for hearts and minds in the fight against climate change has been strengthened, not weakened, by the East Anglia affair. It is a bizarre finding and I make no attempt to explain it, only to point out the dangers of rushing to see desired results in a series of data, or a simple narrative in a complicated picture. There is a process that society has developed to avoid such confirmation bias. It is called science.

The headline reduction in acceptance of global warming, incidentally, seems more likely down to the record-breaking cold winter, which 83% of people said they were aware of. The other 17% are clearly made of strong stuff.

When news of the East Anglia emails broke in November , it was a phrase that climate scientists had used a &quot;trick&quot; to &quot;hide the decline&quot; that got most people excited. Media reports, including in this newspaper, reported that climate sceptics believed they had found a smoking gun that proved scientists who worked on global warming were up to no good, and by extension that the problem was exaggerated or a falsehood. This was the &quot;WMD-in-45 minutes&quot; claim that drove the email story around the world and earned it the drearily predictable &quot;climategate&quot; tag. It was also total nonsense . The decline was not in recorded global temperatures, as was sometimes said, but in temperatures inferred from a series of tree rings over the last few decades. The trick is to ignore the obviously faulty information. This statistical technique has its critics, and it raises questions about why the decline occurs and whether earlier data can be relied on, but these questions have been openly addressed by scientists for years. The issue appears in text books and even has its own, rather more pedestrian, name — the divergence problem .

The misrepresentation and lies spread over the divergence problem (and see how the controversy drains from the issue when we call it that) is now widely understood, but the stink it created lingers. Even its collapse was problematic, for it created a vacuum into which a string of other accusations rushed.

To their credit, many discussions of these other issues now try to make clear they do nothing to question the basic science of global warming. But, to many people who do not follow this closely, how can accusations of poor behaviour by climate scientists do anything but?

Chief among these is a claim that a 1 99 0 paper on land surface temperature rise is flawed . Worse, the scientist involved, Phil Jones, the head of the university&apos;s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) concealed these flaws. The climate science community has responded to the allegations with a barely concerned shrug of the shoulders. Are they complacent? Closing ranks?

At the heart of the issue are the locations of weather stations in developing China, which provided data for the study. Jones and his colleague Wei-Chyung Wang cannot produce records to verify some locations, and this rightly raises questions. Jones admits it is not best practice . Wang has already been investigated and cleared of misconduct by his university.

Why is this important? Because critics say if the stations have been moved then this invalidates statements in the 1 99 0 paper, and raises questions about subsequent studies that base their conclusions on its findings.

What have they done about it? Nature, the journal that published the 1 99 0 paper, says it has looked into the issue and is happy with the explanation offered by the scientists, but will look again and correct if necessary, it just needs someone to send them specific evidence of a problem. Al most three years after Jones published all the location data he had for the stations on the internet, Nature has yet to receive any such complaint.

 Peer review is also under the spotlight . The process by which scientists judge each others work as fit for publication has always been where objective science dashes on the rocks of subjective human opinion, but the emails are alleged to show much worse — censorship, exclusion of critics and deliberate attempts to steer the process to keep away unfavourable results.

Take the last first. Keith Briffa, deputy head of the CRU, is accused of initiating an attempt to have a paper rejected because of an email to a scientist who was reviewing the paper that said: &quot;Confidentially I now need a hard and if required extensive case for rejecting [an unnamed paper] – to support Dave Stahle&apos;s and really as soon as you can. Please.&quot; Briffa says there was no such attempt, and that he was reminding an overdue referee that he needed the report urgently, which the referee had already indicated would be negative.

In another example, Jones supposedly unfairly rejected a paper that questioned his own results, despite the censored paper offering no supporting method, data or analysis. The peer review system is far from perfect, but it has always been pretty good at keeping out papers that offer no method, data or analysis to support their conclusions.

To view peer review, and the behaviour of working scientists, only through the prism of these private emails, and then diagnose fault and demand change is naive and misguided. It brings to mind the people of the planet Krikkit in Douglas Adams&apos; Hitchhikers Guide series, who, on penetrating a dust cloud shielding their world and witnessing the extent of the universe for the first time, immediately declare war on it, muttering that &quot;it will have to go&quot;.

For if peer review is flawed, and it is, then scientists know there is enough slack in the system that such flaws rarely matter. Good papers may bounce from journal to journal, but generally find a home. Bad papers, even those published in good journals, wither on the vine. Fraudulent, or just plain wrong, papers get caught, often when competitors cannot reproduce the reported results.

And if there is bias in peer review, which there is, then it affects all sides. Last year, the high-profile journal Geophysical Research Letters (GRL) published a paper co-authored by Richard Lindzen, a climate expert at MIT and possibly the world&apos;s last climate sceptic with serious credentials in the field. The study claimed to show climate models underestimate the amount of heat that escapes from the Earth but, after publication, was taken to pieces by other climate scientists. Some have criticised GRL for even publishing the paper , and claim it got an easy ride because its publisher, the American Geophysical Union, allows authors to suggest a list of friendly reviewers. The AGU, rightly, has not revealed the referees or their comments — and the wheels of science grind on.

It is true the East Anglia emails suggest that Jones and other scientists did not enter the brave new world of open data and Freedom of Information requests with gusto. In fact, they fought it tooth and nail . Any failure to comply with the regulations should be punished, but equally we should not forget the context in which many of these emails were sent. This is a saga that goes back years, to a time before the current widespread political and media concern about climate change. Back to when Al Gore was not a Nobel prize winning campaigner, but a politician blamed for wrecking the Kyoto protocol, and to a time when well-funded climate sceptics faked scientific papers, hijacked debate and routinely spread disinformation about scientists and their work, in far greater numbers than we see now. Climate scientists, left to fight this pretty much alone, were seriously angry with those who they saw as engaged in a systematic effort to undermine their profession.

Yes, some emails are intemperate and unprofessional even. But what exactly are we accusing those involved of? An instruction to delete emails, which were not deleted. A boast, which was not followed through, to keep shoddy papers from the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A desire to hide behind, apparently legitimate in many cases, technical excuses not to hand over their data to people who they perceived as opponents who refused to play by the rules.

Just as every journalist was squirming in their seat and grateful it was Andrew Gilligan&apos;s and not their notebook under such scrutiny in the Hutton review of the David Kelly affair, so biologists, physicists, civil servants, doctors, in fact those in every profession should consider how their reputation would survive if years of private correspondence were filleted for dirt and handed over to critics. This is the broad illumination with which we must judge the behaviour of those involved in the East Anglia affair, not the narrow spotlight of spite and double standards.

It is clear that &quot;climategate&quot; has been a public relations disaster for science and scientists. That is unfair in my view, but things could get worse, and this is where the flawed simple narrative takes a dangerous turn.

A common response to scrutiny of the emails has been to praise the fairness of the scrutineers, an eagerness to see the scientists, so long the good guys, get a kicking in the name of open debate. But it has also encouraged a creeping rehabilitation of climate scepticism. False balance has been restored to the force.

The genuine issues raised by the emails, such as Freedom of Information requests and data sharing, should be debated in public. But such debates are unlikely to stay on these legitimate grounds. There is a reason why the fight between East Anglia and critics over data access rumbled in the specialist press for years without troubling the bulletins or newstands. It&apos;s pretty dull. The reasons why the data were not shared? Now there is a story, as long as it involves conspiracy and dodgy dealings, and that it raises doubts about the science of global warming. What do you mean it doesn&apos;t? Didn&apos;t you hear, they used a trick to hide the decline.

 [details] [close] received 2 years ago  published 2 years ago  lang: en   Free energy will promulgate a forward leap in human progress akin to the discovery of fire. It will bring the dawn of an entirely new civilization -- one based on freedom and abundance. -Sterling Allan Of course, when Sterling Allan talks about free energy, he&apos;s talking about natural energy from sources like wind and solar, not the violating-the-laws-of-thermodynamics type of energy. 
There is, of course, no such thing as truly free energy, or energy that we can take out of nothing and use for something, which is why perpetual motion machines not only don&apos;t work, but are physically impossible . (Although it is amusing to try to get as close as possible.)

But as many of you have noted about dark energy, there is a non-zero amount of energy that seems to be inherent to space itself. As the Universe expands, it appears to create more space, and hence, more energy.
 
Now, the energy density is tiny. So tiny that we didn&apos;t even discover the existence of dark energy until 1 99 8, and if you were to compare it to the energy stored in, say, the mass of a human body, you would have to spread a human being out over the entire inner solar system (to fill a sphere the size of the orbit of Mars ) just to get the same density as dark energy, which is about two protons per cubic meter.
 
Now, while energy is ill-defined in general relativity, we understand energy and momentum well enough (as well as more complicated properties of metric spaces, which I will not go into) to know that dark energy should have the following properties based on our current observations:

 It should have a constant energy density everywhere in space. It should be impossible to add to or take away from that energy density. That energy density should also remain constant throughout time. 
However, a recent paper has come out on the arXiv (and was discussed over on Cosmic Variance earlier today) that seeks to test that first assumption: is dark energy a constant everywhere in space? 
Using a hypothetical improvement on a technique called atom interferometry (illustration above), they are proposing that changes in dark energy density could lead to changes in atomic motions, and could hypothetically exert a force on atoms.

Now, there are all sorts of reasons to believe that dark energy doesn&apos;t exert a force on atoms. Namely, the following big ones:

 Dark energy, as far as we can tell, affects the expansion of space and nothing else , meaning it shouldn&apos;t exert a force on atoms. You can only exert a force (whether you&apos;re dark energy or not) if your field changes from point-to-point. On the other hand, dark energy is observed to be a constant everywhere in space. 
But, it isn&apos;t like we have a better proposal out there to try to perform some laboratory test on dark energy. Does it couple to matter? We don&apos;t think so, but we haven&apos;t tested it sufficiently to know for sure. Is it a constant everywhere in space? We think so, but we don&apos;t know if it clumps (even a little) around masses like the Earth or the Sun.
There is so much we don&apos;t understand about dark energy, and how the Universe&apos;s expansion on the largest scales relates back to what we can observe in a laboratory on Earth that this is possibly the most exciting prospect to come out concerning dark energy all year! 
 
So do I think this is likely to produce anything new? No, probably not. There are many good reasons to believe that we know what we&apos;re talking about, but that doesn&apos;t really matter. What matters is that -- in order to know anything for sure -- we need to do the experiment . This idea deserves to get a little bit of a buzz, if for no other reason than we need to throw ideas around about dark energy , and be open to the notion that what we&apos;re seeing is so bizarre it could really turn our view of the Universe on its head.
 
But there still isn&apos;t any truly free energy out there, not even if dark energy does change from point-to-point. Which is too bad... because if there was some, I could then move to phase 3 . I&apos;ll keep dreaming.

If you have strong nerves, you should look what has happened with once fine popular science magazine, Scientific American . The most recent four months have shown everyone that the IPCC has distorted the available evidence in order to claim that the climate change is going to be - or already is - scary.

Well, there&apos;s one magazine that has the balls to tell you that the IPCC is actually too conservative:
 Despite Climategate, IPPC Most ly Underestimates Climate Change 
 Yes, to give you an additional hint about their competency, they put &quot;IPPC&quot; instead of &quot;IPCC&quot; in the title.

The article claims that the warming and sea level trends predicted by the IPCC in 1 99 0, 1 99 5, 2000 were exceeded in reality. Well, that&apos;s surely a bizarre statement given the fact that the trend since 2001 has been cooling and there has been no statistically significant global warming since 1 99 5, as Phil Jones recently admitted, while the IPCC has surely predicted a statistically significant global warming for the last 15 years. The story about the sea level rise is similar.

So you may ask: how did they justify such a strange claim? Well, they wouldn&apos;t find any sane person - and not even any climate scientist - who would say such a thing (perhaps James Hansen could also do the job, but his lack of sanity is already too well-known a fact). But they find the predetermined conclusions to be so important that the writers found it appropriate or necessary to quote a guy from the Harvard Medical School!

To make things worse, his name is James McCarthy - at least it wasn&apos;t Joseph McCarthy. ;-)

Well, if you look at the affiliation, you will learn that the Harvard Medical School has its own center for &quot;health and the global environment&quot;. In the recent years, the AGW cancer has become so widespread that separate units (or tumors) of global warming alarmism are growing - and are being funded - even in the medical schools.

Needless to say, not only McCarthy&apos;s propositions are manifest lies, but as his page shows, he also has no qualifications to make statements about this physical science. Since 1982 for 20 years, he&apos;s been the director of a museum of comparative biology, and he has been member of most bureaucratic bodies trying to justify the carbon regulation policies with the plankton.

By the way, the oceans are doing very well and will be doing just fine even if significant warming would take place, see e.g. a new finding by folks at the Penn State University about the diversity of coral reefs advertised by One India a few days ago.

The psychological health of British troops returning from the frontline is being neglected

Last week in the United States an army sergeant was accused of waterboarding his own four-year-old daughter after she refused to recite her ABCs. This story emerged as the Guardian reported that during a time of critical stress for military hospitals, there was little concrete information about soldiers&apos; mental health.

This difficulty of collecting statistics about post-traumatic stress disorder – the likely cause of such dysfunctional behaviour as waterboarding your own daughter – is a critical deficit in addressing the human impacts of the long wars that the UK is currently engaged in.

While stories of soldiers surviving horrific physical injuries and recovering from the loss of limbs attract most attention, we must not forgot the far more subtle but equally devastating impacts that war wreaks on soldiers&apos; minds. Perhaps controversially, I believe that those who have engaged in acts close to or constituting torture must be at the front of the line when it comes to treatment when they return to civilian life.

To do otherwise would be compounding failures already made. In his history of soldiers and psychiatrists , Ben Shephard identified a &quot;reoccurring cycle within war neuroses&quot; with the problem &quot;first denied, then exaggerated, then understood, and finally, forgotten&quot;. The mental strains of fighting counterinsurgency wars, where every object or person represents a potential deadly threat, are clearly not yet fully understood.

It is within these conflicts that torture abuses have occurred. Whether torture was institutional in nature is highly contested but it seems from the evidence of individual cases such as Binyam Mohamed and Baha Mousa, and more systemic failings such as Abu Ghraib and Bagram airbase, that the problem goes beyond a few &quot;bad apples&quot; operating off the grid.

Simon Jenkins recognised the &quot;banality of evil&quot; as being responsible for these abuses when he wrote that &quot;even the nicest people go to the bad when caught up in ill-conceived, illegal or unjust wars&quot;. In 2008, in a repeat of the infamous Milgram test , US researchers found that people were still willing to inflict pain on each other if told to by authority figures.

In his moral history of the 20th century, Jonathan Glover explained how &quot;military training has to make people do things which they would not do in civilian life&quot;, eroding &quot;civilian identity and values&quot;. Any return to normal life therefore involves making the difficult transition back from combatant to civilian.

Today&apos;s wars &quot;among the people&quot; make the experiences endured by soldiers that much more complex and therefore that transition that much harder.

Joanna Bourne wrote in her Intimate History of Killing that combatants insist on forming emotional relationships not only with their comrades but with the enemy.

Stockholm syndrome describes the seemingly bizarre phenomenon where hostages begin to identify with and grow sympathetic to their captor. Less well known is Lima syndrome where abductors develop sympathy for their hostages. It was named after events at the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru, when in 1 99 6 hundreds of people attending a party were held hostage by militants. Days later, the abductors had set free most of the hostages, including the most valuable ones, supposedly due to sympathy forged with their detainees.

The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture is a UK-based charity dedicated solely to the treatment of torture survivors. On its website it describes the idea that torture only has lasting effects for the victim as a myth, stating that torture has a &quot;metastasising effect on the lives of any of those who it touches – including the perpetrators … the effects of torture can last a lifetime. In addition to post traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia, torture survivors can end up avoiding interacting with other people and distancing themselves from the outside world.&quot;

As our understanding of the complexities of the mental injuries of war increases so does our responsibility to care for those affected. As Operation Moshtarak continues, the likelihood of British casualties increases. Back in the UK there are expectations that we have the systems in place to care for those who are wounded in action. While higher payouts for wounded British troops is a welcome move, PTSD needs to be treated as an injury and it needs to be taken far more seriously, with those who have been at the forefront of the darker side of our wars given the highest priority.

Tax breaks and avoidance schemes for the wealthy should end now. We might get a fairer society as a result

In praise of paying tax. Now there&apos;s a controversial idea in a country like the UK that is in thrall to the tax avoidance industry, as we explore on pages 48-49.

Millions of us have little or no choice about our tax affairs as the money is deducted through PAYE, but many companies and wealthy individuals view tax as discretionary expenditure. They threaten to relieve us of their presence at the merest suggestion they might not be granted the tax breaks they crave, and finding ways legally to wriggle out of paying is big business.

The idea that tax breaks for the wealthy and for businesses were a way to stimulate growth was a key tenet of the economic liberalism of the Thatcher/Reagan years. But instead of having the trickle-down benefits intended, it resulted in pandering to the City&apos;s desire for ever-lower taxes while generating little in return for the rest of us.

Any tax system reflects the priorities of society. The architecture of ours was shaped around attracting non-domiciled financiers and Russian oligarchs, luring the rich from other nations and encouraging them to settle here. Encouraging investment in say, energy and transport infrastructure came lower down the list of priorities, as did help for entrepreneurs. So while the non-doms flooded to London, chunks of our electricity and nuclear power industries, as one example, have been sold off to the French state: pensioners in Paris will benefit when someone turns on their lights in Peterborough.

Before its election in 1 99 7, the incoming Labour government took huge pains to establish its low-tax credentials. That was understandable at the time, but led to all manner of contortions to avoid raising the basic headline rate of income tax. It was coupled with a bizarre reluctance to challenge benefits for the super-wealthy, including non-dom status and privileges allowing private equity barons to pay a lower rate than their cleaners.

Rather than concentrating on making the UK competitive at wealth-generating activities, the emphasis has been on tax competition, leaving us at the mercy of the rootless rich. The swallowing of the City&apos;s low-tax mantra has another, more basic flaw, which is the erroneous idea financial services should be seen as an engine of wealth generation in its own right; in a functioning economy, banks are meant merely to serve the productive sector.

It is no wonder that politicians from both major parties find it so difficult to have an honest discussion about the inevitable fiscal tightening we face. Paying more tax is seen as philosophically unacceptable, and that has made it al most impossible to talk sensibly about the taxation of bankers&apos; bonuses, or about how to recoup some of the costs of the bailout from those responsible for the crisis, instead of parking the whole burden on the little people on PAYE. Any sentient being knows taxes will have to go up, but politicians are not allowed to say so.

Paying tax has terrible PR. But it is actually a good thing to pay the right amount of tax. It is also a good thing when the economic substance of a taxpayer&apos;s affairs reflects the picture they have painted to the Revenue and not some sham structure.

The contempt for taxpaying of the past few decades has gone hand in hand with greater inequality, strained public services and an unthinking faith in the market, ideas that are now discredited. As we head towards an election, it&apos;s time for a new way of thinking.

Leslie Kenton has written dozens of books on health and beauty. But she struggled for four years to produce a searing memoir about how her father – jazz musician Stan Kenton – sexually abused her as a child

Recently arrived from her home in New Zealand, ­ Les­lie Kenton sits in what was once her local cafe in London&apos;s Primrose Hill (she has a flat round the corner) and demurely sips mineral water. For someone who must be extremely jet-lagged, the 68-year-old looks unaccountably radiant. But then there is something uncommonly rarefied about this woman with 35 books on health, beauty and spirituality to her name.

An elegant, silvery-blond Grace Kelly lookalike, she lost her original Californian ­accent long ago in favour of something not too far removed from the Queen&apos;s English and speaks as orn­ately as she writes: in great flowing para­graphs that frequently dip into new age-y philosophy and mysticism. An award-winning writer and broadcaster, she is about to publish a memoir that is likely to stick a firework under her public image and send it career­ing up into the sky.

With the provocative title Love ­Affair, the book reveals that her relation­ship with her father, Stan Kenton , the late jazz legend, was every bit as illicit as many friends and family members later admitted they had suspected all along. The band-leader pianist, an alcoholic said to be haunted by his own talent, raped his daughter for the first time when she was 11 years old. This continued over the next two years, but the way Kenton writes about it suggests that, to her, the ­relationship was an intense, ­mutually ­passionate one, with her as his ­confidante, his soul mate. The book&apos;s unflinching honesty in this ­matter makes it a compelling, if frequently ­unsettling read, but her website trailer for it strikes a bizarre ly inappropriate note. A montage of old footage of Leslie and Stan frolicking together set against a jazz soundtrack, it appears to treat the subject of incest with a heady romantic glamour. Why?

&quot;I do not go out to glamorise the subject, no,&quot; Kenton says. &quot;Of course not. But did you not feel, from reading the book, that ours was indeed a love affair? Appropriate or inappropriate, the whole thing about our relationship was that while it was on one side forged in lies and deceit – and, yes, in horror, too – the other was forged in ecstatic wonderment. We shared every­thing: music, the wind, the sea. My father was a tortured man, but he felt free to be who he was around me in a way he couldn&apos;t with anybody else, and certainly not with my mother. Tell me, how many love affairs do you know like that?&quot;

While the book may well be labelled a misery memoir, that ever-growing genre that suggests we are all, in some ways, walking wounded, Kenton comes across as anything but a victim, and insists she bears her father – to whom the book is dedicated &quot;with all my love&quot; – no ill will.

&quot;I was angry with him, for sure, but I never hated him. And in fact, for the past 15 or 20 years [Stan Kenton died in 1979], I have thought of him as much a victim as I was myself.&quot;

This is because, she explains, of a complicated bloodline that rendered her paternal grandmother, Stella, a woman of monstrous proportions, and her father before that. The shocking sadism Stella exacted upon a nine-year-old Leslie is necessarily edited in the book, she says, &quot;because the full story is too gruesome&quot;. In other words, while Stan did indeed behave terribly towards his daughter, he didn&apos;t mean to. It wasn&apos;t his fault.

&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I do not believe there are good guys and bad guys like there are in the movies,&quot; she says. &quot;You know, human beings in certain circumstances will do certain things. It doesn&apos;t mean they are crazy. It just means that they are split up inside, their shards don&apos;t come together properly, they never experience wholeness.&quot;

To ease the guilt that would never be fully assuaged, Stan drank himself into oblivion while his career foundered. By the time his daughter had reached puberty, he no longer took her to bed, newly fearful of her sexuality. And she buried the experience so deeply within her subconscious that it was only later, in 1967, after a medical trial in London with LSD, that she ­remembered precisely what he had done to her ­between the ages of 11 and 13.

Until his death, Kenton ­remained unquestioningly loyal to the man she continued to adore. After his second marriage soured, she chose to support his attempts to get sole custody of his new son and daughter, albeit before she regained her memories of the abuse. &quot;Did he repeat the same patterns with them?&quot; she says. &quot;I believe not.&quot; That said, she admits that several members of his family did go on to suffer in ways she would rather not go into in order to respect their privacy.

&quot;How did I myself escape from b­eing destroyed?&quot; she wonders. &quot;I ­really don&apos;t know. I guess I should have ended up alcoholic or suicidal, but I didn&apos;t. I&apos;m clearly blessed.&quot;

At 18, she got pregnant. It was, she says, the best thing that could have happened to her. &quot;When I had Branton,&quot; she says of her son, &quot;I realised that pure love exists. And that I was saved.&quot;

Shortly afterwards, Kenton moved from California to Paris, and then to London, in pursuit of a career that was rapidly taking off. She would go on to become beauty editor at Harpers&amp;Queen magazine, a consultant to the Green party, an early proponent of ­nutritional detoxing and founder of the Origins range of cosmetics. The Los ­Angeles Times proclaimed her the &quot;Dalai lama of the beauty business&quot;.

In her private life, meanwhile, she had a succession of relationships. Though many single ­parents ­frequently report that finding new partners is ­difficult when you have children, Kenton had no such ­problems. Men were for ever falling over her. She has four children by four different men – Branton, 50, an ­entrepreneur; Susannah, 46, an actor and writer; Jesse, 44, a plastic surgeon, and Aaron, 28, a film-maker.

In the book, she claims she found it difficult to find true romantic love. Not any more, she doesn&apos;t. &quot;Oh, I did find love again. Did I ever!&quot; she beams, before adding that she is single now. &quot; But one of the ­ironies of my life is that the men I loved most were not the fathers of my children. Isn&apos;t that curious?&quot;

When she embarked upon Love ­Affair, she confidently expected to knock it off in six months, if only ­because for someone with three dozen books to her credit, sitting down and writing poses few challenges. But this one proved different. &quot;It brought me to my knees,&quot; she says. During its ­tortured genesis, she became haplessly accident-prone, badly damaging a knee and a hip, and also breaking her back. At no point, however, did she interpret any of this as a sign that Love Affair was perhaps one book that should ­remain unwritten. &quot;Oh no, these ­accidents absolutely were meant to be, you know? My soul was calling me. And so I locked ­myself into my house and didn&apos;t come out again until I&apos;d finished, four years later.&quot;

Kenton hasn&apos;t had an accident since, although the process exhausted her. &quot;It did, but then we are all a living ­matrix of energy, aren&apos;t we? I think each one of us chooses to become a ­human ­because being human is just about the most exciting thing we can be. It&apos;s a challenge, and it frequently feels like an impossible one, but you learn so much just by going through it.&quot;

She smiles. &quot;If you are an intelligent person, and I like to think I am, then your life can be very much ruled by your mind. The mind serves the very deepest levels of our being, yes, but it should not necessarily rule our lives.&quot;

What should do so, she says, is the gut, and it is upon that instinct that she herself operates. &quot;When you are able to truly connect with the gut, then – wow, basically. I love watching people find that out for themselves. It&apos;s like walking into a garden and seeing flowers you have never seen before. It&apos;s breathtaking. It turns me on.&quot;

A few months ago, when the book was finally completed, her four grown-up children, who had always been fully supportive of her decision to write it, threw her a wrap party in celebration.

&quot;My daughter did a prayer circle for it, and everybody had something ­really nice to say.&quot; Her eyes glisten with tears. &quot;It was lovely, but then they are lovely. You know, it really is my children that saved me, and I always knew – instinctively, from the gut – that I would be a good mother to them. And I have been. I am a better parent than I am anything else, I think.&quot;

Hey everybody. I&apos;m back from Mardi Gras but still nursing a pretty wicked four-day hangover. So this&apos;ll be a quick hits edition.

 The old ladies who stole our beers: Okay, so it&apos;s our first night at Mardi Gras. We&apos;re hanging at Razoo and stockpiling beers because everything is 3-for-1. Because doing anything more than double-fisting is probably overdoing it, we sat our beers on this little ledge next to us...shortly after which two older ladies sat down next to that ledge. One of them had their hand right next to our beers, and I considered moving them because I don&apos;t like letting strangers near my alcohol. Alas, I didn&apos;t trust my gut, and a few minutes later, the women got up and bolted out of the bar. That&apos;s when we realized two of our beers were missing.

Seriously, ladies, there was a 3-for-1 special going on. The beers would have cost you a couple dollars. Hell, I would have given you the two bucks if you&apos;d have asked me.

Sadly, this was not the only time we paid the price for leaving our beers unattended.

 Whoever drugged me and Statbuster: Okay, so now it&apos;s the second day of our trip, and we&apos;re chilling on the balcony of Cat&apos;s Meow, throwing beads and loving life. Statbuster and I kind of balanced our hurricanes on this railing so we could scope for, you know, the right kind of people to give our beads to. I always drink a little faster than my friends, so I downed my hurricane pretty quickly. Then I started to feel funny and decided to head back to our hotel to change shirts. The last thing I remember is stepping onto the street...

...then I woke up four hours later.

Statbuster also blacked out for exactly four hours. And we hadn&apos;t even had much to drink that day. It was bizarre . Like skipping a chapter on a DVD. Mind you, Statbuster and I have done a lot of drinking over the years, both together and seperately, and neither of us have every blacked out before, let alone simultaneously for the exact same amount of time. I have no idea who did it, or how they did, or why they did it. But fortunately for me, I made it back to the room on my own (although I can&apos;t remember how), and our buddy Bill -- who wasn&apos;t drinking due to an ugly hangover -- got Statbuster back to the hotel. So, you know, we didn&apos;t get mugged or raped or anything.

The moral of this story: never, ever, ever lose sight of your drink when you&apos;re out in a public place, no matter how much fun you&apos;re having or how safe you think you are.

 The Los Angeles Clippers: After last night&apos;s 110-92 home loss to the Hawks, the Clips winless in the five games since Mike Dunleavy had his coaching duties revoked. I&apos;m waiting for somebody to set up a billboard in L.A. with a picture of Dunleavy that says, &quot;Miss Me Yet?&quot;

Funny how Marcus Camby gets traded and the Clippers immediately give up 70 points in the paint. Let&apos;s face it, they are who...well...you know.

 The Sacramento Kings: Yeeeeah...getting outscored 42-16 in the second quarter and falling behind by 30 points in the first half will lead to ugly losses like the Paupers 130-98 road thumping by the Warriors. For his part, Tyreke Evans was blaming the trade deadline:

&quot;I think that&apos;s the reason why played the way we did, players worrying about being traded and not knowing what&apos;s going on before the trade deadline,&quot; Evans said. &quot;Maybe whatever happens we can get through it and just try to play the way we&apos;ve been playing.&quot;

Try to play the way you&apos;ve been playing? Dude, you&apos;re 18-36 and have lost 22 of the your last 27 games! I really don&apos;t think playing the way you&apos;ve been playing is the right answer. But hey, I&apos;m sure dealing for a former NBA scoring champ could fix everything...

 Stephen Curry, quote machine: This is what the rookie had to say about his team playing sans Monta Ellis: &quot;We play different, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s better. We pass the ball, everybody is spreading the floor and the ball movement is always there. Last time we played at home we had the same kind of game. Monta is a great player. I guess when he&apos;s out, everyone has to step up and move the ball for us to be successful.&quot;

Unless my ability to read between the lines was drugged out of me at Mardi Gras, I think Curry just busted on Moped for not passing the rock enough.

 The Phoenix Suns: The good news: Amar&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;e Stoudemire -- who finished with 30 points and 16 boards -- isn&apos;t letting the trade rumors get to him. The bad news: the Suns committed 19 TOs -- thanks to a career-high 7 steals by Jason Kidd -- and were held under 100 for only the seventh time this season. I&apos;m sure you can guess what that means.

 Amar&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;e Stoudemire, quote machine: Regarding his big game: &quot;I felt great. I came out with a lot of intensity from the start. I wanted to set the tone early, both offensively and defensively.&quot; In related news, the Suns gave up 107 points and finished with one of their lowest point totals of the season.

 The Milwaukee Bucks: Going into their home game against the Rockets, this was a battle of two teams dealing with trade rumors. The Bucks lost a couple journeymen/expiring contracts in exchange for John Salmons, while Houston had been working on various deals involving Tracy McGrady before ultimately shipping him to Sacramento for Kevin Martin. Based how the Rockets whupped the homeboys 127- 99 , I guess it&apos;s safe to say the possibility of losing (read that: getting rid of) Knee-Mac is what you&apos;d call a happy distraction. Although I have no idea why they&apos;d let go of my boy Carl Landry.

As for Houston&apos;s trading chops, I think Basketbawful reader Hellshocked summed it up nicely: &quot;The Houston-Sacto trade makes no sense to me from the Rockets side. They gave up Carl Landry, their heart and soul this season, along with a 22 million expiring contract for Kevin Martin, who won&apos;t be able to help them all that much this season? The only explanation I can come up with is that they are banking on Yao to come back 100% and not get injured again, but even if that happens they now have a glaring hole at either power forward or backup power forward. They would have been better off making the trade with NY or Chicago for expiring contracts and cap relief, imo.&quot;

 The New York Knicks: Not only did they whiff on their bid to obtain Knee-Mac&apos;s expiring deal, they choked up a 15-point lead at home to a Bulls team that was missing two of its top six rotations players: Joakim Noah (plantar faciitis) and John Salmons (traded to the Bucks). But the best part was how their defense allowed Brad Miller to explode in the third quarter. Miller canned a triple, converted three-point plays on multiple possessions by first beating David Lee on a drive and then faking him out of his shoes with an up-and-under move, hit a running 8-footer while fading away and then threw a full-court pass to Kirk Hinrich for a cherry-picking layup.

The Bulls, who have no inside presence and rely most ly on jumpers, scored 70 points in the paint. Nice defense, Knicks. At least it looks like you&apos;re going to get Eddie House from the Celtics. Oh, and Brian Cardinal. That should turn your season around. And there&apos;s always next ye...

...oh, wait. The Crabs traded for Antawn Jamison, pretty much sealing the deal for King Crab staying in Cleveland. Sorry &apos;bout that.

 Ball. 
 Update! I love this submission from Basketbawful reader winnetou: &quot;Maybe I&apos;m reading this the wrong way, but as quoted on TrueHoop, Frank Isola of the New York Daily News wrote: &apos;Nate Robinson&apos;s locker inside Madison Square Garden was vacant except for a name plate, a small Vaseline jar and a pair of socks.&apos;&quot;

 The New Orleans Hornets: Man, that 54-36 shooting percentage discrepancy really killed.

 The New Jersey Nyets: Wow! With Dwyane Wade out (strained calf), it looked like the Nyets were going to pull off the unthinkable: A second consecutive win, which would have knocked them way off course in their bid for all-time infamy. Then they missed 11 of their last 12 shots as the Heat rallied to win 87-84.

Whew!

Said Keyon Dooling: &quot;There haven&apos;t been many games where (we) walked away thinking you should have won that game. This is one of those games we should have won.&quot; You know, Keyon, being 5-48 means never getting to say stuff like that. Oh, wait, that&apos;s right. You&apos;re 5-49 now. My bad.

By the way, Basketbawful reader Jan N. assures me this is not Photoshopped in any way. Link .

 Ball. 
 The Minnesota Timberwolves: Okay, so let me get this straight. The Wizards Generals Bullets were without Gilbert Arenas (suspended), Caron Butler (traded) and Antawn Jamison (also traded). Those are only three of their top three players heading into this season. But they still beat the Timberpoops 108- 99 ? Whoa. Fail.

Said Kurt Rambis: &quot;This is very similar to our lack of effort -- guys not doing the right things, not getting the stops, not having the defensive pressure. All of that was very similar.&quot; I know, right?! Who&apos;s coaching these guys, anyway?? Oh. Right.

By the way, then Minnesota sent Brian Cardinal to New York for Darko Milicic, I seriously wondered whether they had re-hired Kevin McHale to handle the negotiations.

 Antawn Jamison, bitterness machine: Regarding the Washington fans who will never again get to not root for him: &quot;You know I love them more than they love me.&quot;

 The Detroit Pistons: Remember back when they established the notion that you could shut down Dwight Howard by &quot;taking his legs away&quot; ? That seems like a long time ago. Hell, al most like it never even happened in the first place. The Pumaman finished with 33 points and 17 rebounds as the Magic clobbered the Pistons 116-91.

Said Ben Wallace: &quot;Dwight did his thing. We just couldn&apos;t stop him.&quot;

By the way, I love all the tough talk from the Magic after the game. Apparently, they think that whacking Ben Gordon in the face and roughing up Jonas Jerebko means they&apos;re all tough now.

Said Matt Barnes: &quot;Early in the season, teams were trying to out tough us and out punk us and stuff like that. I can slowly see it changing. It&apos;s just a thing -- we&apos;re not going to be dirty, but we&apos;re not going to be pushed around. And I think we&apos;re changing that.&quot;

Added Howard: &quot;When there&apos;s times on the court when you got to be physical like that, guys don&apos;t back down on any challenge. That&apos;s what we have to do. We can&apos;t back down from anybody.&quot;

Yeah, okay. When you guys start picking on teams your own size, we&apos;ll talk about physical play.

 The Indiana Pacers: Apparently, guarding a gimpy Tony Parker (28 points) and blocking out Tim Duncan (26 rebounds, 11 offensive) wasn&apos;t part of Indy&apos;s game plan. And neither was winning. Mind you, Duncan was freaking 4-for-23 and the Spurs shot 35 percent as a team. And the Pacers still lost.

Said Jim O&apos;Brien: &quot;If you would have told me we would hold them to 35 percent shooting, I would think we had a chance.&quot;

Added Troy Murphy: &quot;This isn&apos;t the way we would have liked it to end tonight.&quot; Well, no shit.

 Southeast Missouri State Can you imagine letting a freshman drill a sit-down three-pointer from nearly half-court right at the shot clock buzzer? These guys can.


 Lacktion report: Even as Chris adjusts to life without Sacto&apos;s Blue-Light Special, he still hits us with a shot of lacktion:

 Spurs-Pacers: Antonio McDyess negated two boards in 7 minutes flat with 2 bricks, 2 fouls, and a giveaway for a 3:2 Voskuhl. DeJuan Blair also ventured into Voskuhl territory by countering a pair of field goals and a rebound in 10:21 with five fouls and two turnovers for a 7:5 ratio of recidivism.

Solomon Jones divided up his 7:21 stint between minor productivity (with a block) and mediocrity (with two fouls and a brick) in a 2:0 Voskuhl effort.

 Pistons-Magic: Charlie Villanueva is earning $7 million a year (approximately $85K a game - al most twice as much as Cedric &quot;Lacktion&quot; Jackson&apos;s ENTIRE salary!), which no doubt reflects well on Joe &quot;We Traded Chauncey For Cancer&quot; Dumars, don&apos;t it? Well, how about this for a statline from the real-life wealth accruer: one foul and one missed shot for a +2 suck differential in 3:16? (In non-lacktive news, Jameer Nelson had 14 points and 9 assists for a Calvin Murphy.)

 Grizzlies-Raptors: DeMarre Carroll turned a spade or two into a celebratory 4.3 trillion (4:19)!

 Rockets-Bucks: Dan Gadzuric earned one board in 5:54, but bricked thricely and took two fouls for a 2:1 Voskuhl.

 Kings-Warriors: Sergio Rodriguez fouled once and missed a shot from the Paramount Theatre for a +2 in 2:12.

Stories such as the Michael Howard UFO report are entertaining – but the MoD archives sadly explode the &apos;X-Files&apos; myths

There&apos;s an old saying that the best place to hide a book is in a library. The latest Ministry of Defence UFO files released to the National Archives contain more than 6,000 pages of documentation, so if there was a memo somewhere in there saying the MoD had a crashed spaceship hidden away in an RAF hangar somewhere, it might not be found.

Before I start all manner of conspiracy theories with that remark, however, I should say that there is no such memo and no such spaceship – and I say that as someone who spent three years of my 21-year MoD career working on this issue.

This is the fifth batch of UFO files to be made available and is part of an ongoing three-year programme to release the entire archive. The decision to release the files was taken in 2007, to deal with the administrative burden of responding to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act. At one time, MoD was receiving more FOI requests on UFOs than on any other subject.

The newly released files cover the period 1 99 4 to 2000. It&apos;s interesting to note that the cult TV series The X-Files was at the height of its popularity at this time. Might this have influenced people making UFO reports?

I&apos;m sceptical about the link between science fiction and UFO sightings. While the popularity of The X-Files might make some people speculate about aliens and government cover-ups, there&apos;s no evidence to suggest that sci-fi films and TV shows influence people&apos;s perceptions of anything strange that they see. Given the current stratospheric popularity of the blockbuster movie Avatar, if people were being influenced by sci-fi in the way suggested, we&apos;d be inundated with reports of people seeing blue aliens. We&apos;re not!

So, how do the MoD&apos;s real-life Mulders and Scullys compare to their fictional counterparts? Having done the job myself, from 1 99 1 to 1 99 4, I&apos;m sorry to have to report that it&apos;s not quite as glamorous as people might suspect. There&apos;s no running around dark warehouses with guns and torches. It&apos;s more a case of asking colleagues in the RAF to check the radar tapes and writing polite letters back to members of the public, stating that most UFOs turn out to be misidentifications of ordinary objects and phenomena.

For those with the patience to wade through 6,000 pages of documents, it&apos;s a mixed bag. There&apos;s a great deal of mundane correspondence between the MoD and the public, together with a vast number of UFO sightings which are clearly aircraft lights, satellites or meteors. But there is some more interesting material.

As well as today&apos;s news story regarding the sighting of a large, triangular &quot;humming&quot; object in the sky above Michael Howard&apos;s Folkestone home ,, other examples include the UFO seen by a police officer over the ground of Chelsea FC , and the air traffic controller at Prestwick who tracked an uncorrelated target on radar, travelling at phenomenal speed. Most disturbing, however, is the incident that occurred on 6 January 1 99 5, when a Boeing 737 on approach to Manchester airport nearly collided with a delta-shaped UFO . The pilot and first officer both witnessed this and made an official report. Neither the MoD nor the Civil Aviation Authority could find any explanation.

As one reads the files, one can sense the MoD&apos;s growing irritation with the subject – an irritation that arguably culminated on 1 December 2009 when the MoD finally disengaged altogether and announced that they would no longer be investigating UFO sightings reported by the public. Some of the files are entitled &quot;persistent correspondent&quot;. This is a coded way of saying &quot;this person is becoming a nuisance&quot;. As will be seen in future file releases – the last files won&apos;t be released until 2011 – this frustration boiled over when the Freedom of Information Act came fully into force.

Another sign of the MoD&apos;s &quot;corporate irritation&quot; with the subject is revealed in the response to somebody who claimed to have been kidnapped by aliens (it&apos;s not just UFOs; these real-life X-Files include material on other mysteries such as alien abductions and crop circles). The person concerned had written to ask about MoD policy on alien abductions and pointed out that if the experience was real, the MoD was failing to maintain the territorial integrity of UK airspace – a core defence mission. After explaining the MoD&apos;s role with respect to UFOs, the somewhat sniffy response stated: &quot;Abduction is a criminal offence and as such is a matter for the civil police.&quot;

This conjures up the bizarre thought of a flying saucer landed on the side of a road, with a bemused constable leaning through the entrance hatch saying, &quot;Excuse me sir, have you any idea how fast you were going?&quot;

 Team USA&apos;s Big Wednesday: Six Medals, Three Golds

VANCOUVER, British Columbia — The U.S. Olympic team came into the day with high expectations and surpassed those lofty goals, marking their best day ever in Winter Games history with six medals – half of them gold.

The six medals were the most in one day by the U.S. at a Winter Olympics, topping the five earned Feb. 20, 2002, in Salt Lake City.

The big names justified the hype, and then some: Lindsey, Shani and Shaun won in convincing fashion. And their less-heralded counterparts were just as impressive.

Lindsey Vonn won the women&apos;s downhill days after she feared a painful shin injury might knock her out of the games, as the sport&apos;s most dominant skier finally got that elusive Olympic medal. And teammate Julia Mancuso, who won gold in the giant slalom in 2006 but had been hindered by injuries ever since, was a surprise silver medalist.

&quot;This is everything I&apos;ve wanted and hoped for,&quot; Vonn said.

Shani Davis and Shaun White became the third and fourth American men to win an event in back-to-back games.

With a sizzling final lap, Davis became the first speedskater to win the men&apos;s 1,000 meters twice. Chad Hedrick, who took home three medals at the 2006 games, earned an unlikely bronze in an event he doesn&apos;t consider his strength.

Having already clinched victory with a big score in his first run, White thrilled the crowd by capping his second run with his signature trick, the risky 3 1/2 twists and two flips of the Double McTwist 1260. Scotty Lago took bronze to give the United States multiple medals on the halfpipe for the last three Olympics.

___

WOMEN&apos;S DOWNHILL

Since getting hurt in practice two weeks ago, Vonn spent more time with Austrian curd cheese smeared on her shin than being on the slopes. Several weather delays bought her time and kept her competition from getting too comfortable on this course.

She kicked out of the gate strong, building a quick lead and building on it. Just when it seemed she might lose control, she regained her form and kept charging toward the finish. A small bump just before the finish cost her a few ticks, but she still wound up winning by 0.56 seconds.

&quot;I fought the whole way down,&quot; she said. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a perfect run. I attacked, and I made it down.&quot;

Maria Riesch of Germany, Vonn&apos;s best friend and usual rival of late, finished eighth.

The course was tough, as evidenced by all the crashes. Swedish standout Anja Paerson went down hard, and another competitor had to be airlifted out. Yet another crashed across the finish line and disappeared under a logo of a skier; in trying to get up, she stuck out one ski, making for a bizarre image.

The only times Americans took gold and silver in an Alpine race both happened at the 1984 Sarajevo Games, with brothers Phil and Steve Mahre going 1-2 in the slalom and Debbie Armstrong and Christin Cooper doing so in giant slalom.

Vonn will be favored in two more races. It remains to be seen how much this event took out of her – or if it&apos;s the start of a Phelps-like domination.

&quot;I have what I want, and I&apos;ll just keep fighting every day,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s definitely a huge relief that I finally did it.&quot;

___

SPEEDSKATING

Shani Davis didn&apos;t come close to a medal in his first two events at these Olympics, but he came through in the 1,000, an event in which he holds the world record. With an impressive final kick, he edged South Korea&apos;s Mo Tae-bum, who won the 500 and whose early pace Davis struggled to match.

Davis even shared the podium with Chad Hedrick again after the other American hopeful took the bronze. Davis and Hedrick had a nasty feud at the 2006 Turin Games, but both appeared in good spirits after Wednesday&apos;s race. Davis and Hedrick finished second and third in the 1,500 in Turin.

&quot;When you&apos;re a world champion or an Olympic champion, you get this little thing on your back called a target,&quot; Davis said. &quot;To go out there and win the 1,000 meters twice is truly amazing.&quot;

___

SNOWBOARDING

Shaun White&apos;s final run was a formality. At times, his entire event seemed like one.

White secured the win on his first run without trying the signature trick. He scored 48.4 points to Finland&apos;s Peetu Piiroinen&apos;s 45.0.

&quot;I just felt like I didn&apos;t come all the way to Vancouver not to pull out the big guns,&quot; White said.

The American men and women have taken 12 of the 21 halfpipe medals awarded since the sport came to the Olympics in 1 99 8.

___

SHORT TRACK

Apolo Anton Ohno easily advanced through the preliminaries of the 1,000, staying on course to surpass Bonnie Blair as the most decorated U.S. Winter Olympian.

Ohno, who won his sixth Olympic medal in the 1,500 Saturday, was third most of the way. Then, in the closing laps, he moved up to second before using a smooth inside move to take the lead over China&apos;s Liang Wenhao.

From there, Ohno cruised to the finish line well ahead of the others to advance to the semifinals later Wednesday.

Ohno also joined J.R. Celski, Simon Cho and Travis Jayner in qualifying for the 5,000 relay final on Saturday.

Wang Meng of China easily won her second consecutive gold medal in the women&apos;s 500 meters. She led all the way after surviving a restart and a false start in the four-woman final.

Wang cruised home well ahead of Canada&apos;s Marianne St-Gelais, who took silver. Arianna Fontana of Italy earned the bronze.

___

MEN&apos;S HOCKEY

With an assist on Finland&apos;s opening goal in a 5-1 victory over Belarus, Teemu Selanne matched the record for most career points in the Olympics.

Selanne has 20 goals and 16 assists in five Olympics. Also with 36: Valeri Kharlamov of Russia, Vlastimil Bubnik of the former Czechoslovakia and Harry Watson of Canada.

There were initial concerns Selanne would not be able to play because of surgery last month for a broken jaw. He returned Feb. 1 and played seven games for Anaheim.

Defending champion Sweden shook off a slow start as Mattias Ohlund and Loui Eriksson scored in the second period to help beat Germany 2-0.

The Swedes did not have a shot on net until midway through the scoreless first period in their Vancouver Games opener.

And in the night&apos;s final game, Jaromir Jagr, out of the NHL for two years and now a role player rather than one of hockey&apos;s big names, scored a goal and set up another late in the second period and the Czech Republic repeated its 2006 Olympic hockey victory over rival Slovakia by winning 3-1.

___

WOMEN&apos;S HOCKEY

So much for Canada&apos;s first real test.

Meghan Agosta had three goals and two assists, Hayley Wickenheiser became the leading goal-scorer in Olympic history, and Canada routed the toughest opponent in its preliminary-round group, beating Sweden 13-1.

Wickenheiser got her 16th Olympic goal among her five points as the Canadians cruised into the semifinals with three victories by a combined 41-2.

Stefanie Marty and Sara Benz scored 43 seconds apart midway through the third period, and Switzerland scored four times in the final 9 1/2 minutes of a 5-2 victory over Slovakia.

___

CROSS-COUNTRY

A mile-long sprint came down to a few inches, with Russia&apos;s Nikita Kriukov getting the front of his ski across the finish line just ahead of countryman Alexander Panzhinskiy in the men&apos;s individual classic cross-country sprint race. A photo finish was needed to determine the winner.

In the women&apos;s individual sprint, Norway&apos;s Marit Bjoergen pulled away at the end for her first gold medal after winning two silvers at previous Olympics and a bronze in the 10K race Monday.

Pre-race favorite Petra Majdic of Slovenia hurt her ribs in a training crash early Wednesday, but managed to salvage a bronze. She collapsed immediately after crossing the finish line.

___

LUGE

Austrian brothers Andreas and Wolfgang Linger won their second straight gold medal in doubles luge.

The Lingers completed their two runs in 1 minute, 22.705 seconds. Andris and Juris Sics of Latvia finished in 1:22.969 and won silver, and Germany&apos;s Patric Leitner and Alexander Resch took bronze with a time of 1:23.404.

It was just the second time a doubles team won in consecutive Olympics. Germany&apos;s Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn did it in 1976 and 1980.

___

CURLING

The U.S. women fell to 0-2, losing to Germany when skip Debbie McCormick&apos;s squad couldn&apos;t make up a two-point deficit in the final end.

The men fell to 0-3 with a 7-6 loss to Switzerland.

___

OLYMPIC CAULDRON

Want an unobstructed picture of the Olympic cauldron? Not a problem any more.

Organizers of the Vancouver Games opened a viewing ramp Wednesday to bring visitors closer to the Olympic cauldron. A chain-link fence around the flame also was moved closer, with a 6-inch-wide strip cut into it for people taking pictures from ground level.

Olympic organizers initially drew criticism for making the flame inaccessible to the public. It was one of a series of glitches that have marred the opening days of the Winter Games.

___

DEFENDING THE GAMES

The head of the Vancouver Olympics isn&apos;t so fond of talk about these being the Glitch Games.

Despite mechanical failures ranging from the cauldron at the opening ceremony to an ice-resurfacing machine, ticket cancellations, weather woes and more, VANOC CEO John Furlong says the problems are being fixed and the games are inspiring euphoria across the country.

He also acknowledged, &quot;When we make mistakes, we have to fix them,&quot; such as opening access to the cauldron.

___

TV RATINGS

The gold for U.S. TV viewership on Tuesday night went to &quot;American Idol.&quot;

Fox&apos;s talent show was watched by 23.6 million viewers, far ahead of the 19.7 million viewers for the Olympics coverage.

Once &quot;Idol&quot; ended, Olympic viewership grew to 20.3 million.

Just NBC&apos;s luck, Tuesday was the first day of the Vancouver Olympics that an American did not win a medal.

 If you’re a journalist , chances are you’ve had some pretty low moments in the last few years, as your industry has imploded all around you. But, in your darkest hours, you were always able to console yourself with one thought: At least I’m not Tucker Carlson.

Just consider his bad run. It started in October 2004, when Jon Stewart went on CNN’s “Crossfire,” co-hosted by Carlson, and accused the show of “hurting America,” while making fun of Carlson’s trademark bow tie and calling him a “dick”--all to the laughter and applause of the studio audience. A few months later, Carlson left CNN and “Crossfire” was canceled. He resurfaced on msnbc, where, now sans bow tie, he hosted his own show; but the new neckwear didn’t seem to make a difference, and, after three time slots (late night, late afternoon, and early evening) and two names (“The Situation With Tucker Carlson” and “Tucker”), his program was canceled before it reached its third birthday. Adding insult to injury, according to Carlson, the entourages of two of “Tucker”’s final guests, Marion Barry and Al Sharpton, made off with the champagne that he had ordered to commemorate the last show. 

But there may have been no lower moment for Carlson than the one he experienced in September 2006, when he became a contestant on the reality-TV show “Dancing With the Stars.” His friends and colleagues begged him not to do the show. It’s career suicide , they told him. You run the risk of becoming another Jerry Springer . But Carlson ignored their advice, and, in the weeks leading up to the show, he practiced four hours a day with his professional dance partner--only taking a break to go to Lebanon to cover the Israel-Hezbollah war. And then, after all that, Carlson lasted only one episode--becoming the first contestant to be eliminated, five episodes before Springer himself was cut from the show. 

 More than three years later, Carlson is still defending his “Dancing With the Stars” turn, if not his dancing ability. “Oh, I loved it,” he insists, professing that his recent trajectory has not bothered him in the slightest. “I never take the long view on my own career. I don’t even know that I have a career or have ever had one--and I’m not sure I would ever want one.&quot;

It’s a Tuesday morning in mid-January, and he’s sitting in his office at his new professional home, a D.C.-based website called The Daily Caller , which, at that moment, is just a little more than 24 hours old. The brainchild of Carlson and his old Trinity College roommate, a former Dick Cheney aide named Neil Patel, The Daily Caller boasts 21 employees, $3 million in financing from a conservative businessman, and, according to Carlson, the straightforward mission of publishing “stories that add to the sum total of known facts about politics and government.” 

If that sounds like a fairly traditional journalistic enterprise, it is. And that’s because Carlson is, at heart, a fairly traditional journalist--and an excellent one at that. It may be hard to remember now, staring back through the thick haze of cable-news smackdowns, but, before Carlson embarked on a TV career--and, at various points, even during that TV career--he was a great writer and reporter. His 1 99 9 profile of George W. Bush for Tina Brown’s short-lived Talk painted a portrait of the then-Texas governor--stubborn, profane, callow--that should have told voters everything they needed to know about why he would be such a terrible president. The piece he wrote for Esquire about traveling to Africa with Sharpton, Cornel West, and other civil rights activists was at once viciously hilarious and bracingly humane, like David Foster Wallace’s or Michael Lewis’s best reportage. At The Weekly Standard , where he worked for much of the 1 99 0s, he was one of the rare writers less consumed with scoring political points than producing quality journalism. 

Which is what was so painful about Carlson’s recent travails--if not for him, then for those who admired his writing and reporting. Indeed, the very qualities that made him such a good print journalist are what made him such a lousy TV one. Although he is undoubtedly a conservative, his conservatism is of the libertarian (and therefore frequently unpredictable) variety. This has often led him to be out of sync with more lockstep conservative commentators--whether on the Iraq war (which, after initially supporting, he turned against one year after the invasion) or gay marriage (which he favors). And his al most preternaturally good nature was often no match for the paranoia and bombast of other cable-news talkers. In a medium that rewards extreme opinions and partisan allegiances, Carlson was an increasingly bad fit.

Worst of all, Carlson’s TV career prevented him from doing the sort of journalism he does so well. “You either can’t travel because you’re tied to a show, or, when you do travel, you’re accompanied by a huge entourage of people and a lot of gear,” he says. “The process of making TV requires you to be in one place and plan every movement.”

Thankfully, those days are over. Carlson is keeping a foot in the TV world, with a contract to serve as a commentator on Fox News (the network that, back when he was working at CNN, he deemed “a mean, sick group of people”). But his primary job will be as editor of The Daily Caller , which he envisions becoming a right-leaning Huffington Post . To that end, he has striven for a mix of articles, ranging from blanket coverage of Scott Brown’s election in Massachusetts to a Golden Globe fashion report written by notorious Republican dirty-trickster (and notorious dandy) Roger Stone. Most promising, Carlson intends to use the site for long-form writing of his own. 

His one feature-length effort so far, an investigation into the third alleged White House gate-crasher, Carlos Allen, reminded him of why he got into journalism in the first place. “I interviewed a lot of people. I was talking to a friend of mine who said, ‘Oh, you’ve got to talk to this guy,’ so I called him and he said, ‘Come over to my house,’ and I went over to his house, and it was a completely bizarre scene. It was totally off-the-record, so I can’t quite describe it, but he had a very unconventional living situation, let me just put it that way, and I spent a couple hours in the guy’s bedroom. It was so interesting. The point is, I really miss that.”

In a speech he gave at last year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Carlson pleaded with conservative journalists to forsake punditry in favor of reporting and, taking The New York Times as a model, “to go out there and find what is happening ... not just interpret things they hear in the mainstream media, but gather news themselves.” Although that plea was met with a chorus of boos, Carlson holds out hope that conservatives will come around to his point of view--and that he won’t have to compromise his site’s standards too much to lure readers. Sitting in his office as he chomps on a piece of Nicorette, he confesses his biggest fear: “You could wind up with a page only about porn, executions, and Sarah Palin every day.”

 &quot;Waah, I hate that NBC is tape-delaying the Olympics. I&apos;m just going to find out the results online, and not watch the primetime coverage.&quot; Liar. NBC and the Vancouver games are doing historically well.

NBC is listening to your complaints. They hear that it&apos;s ridiculous for an Olympiad that takes place on our continent to not be shown live. They know in this age where every website has photos and results up, hours before NBC&apos;s coverage, it&apos;s annoying to have to wait to actually see the event.

They&apos;re listening to you, and they don&apos;t care.

Why would they? From the television ratings so far, there&apos;s absolutely no incentive to change things. Every single primetime broadcast thus far has outperformed even the highest rated night from 2006.

Trumpets a press release:
 
The 26.4 million average viewers for the first five nights of the Vancouver Games is the most for a non-U.S. Winter Olympics since the tabloid-fueled 1 99 4 Lillehammer Games (38.1 million). The 26.4 million is nearly five million more and 22 percent higher than the average viewership of the first five nights from Torino in 2006 (21.6 million).
 
They&apos;re averaging 14.5/24 per night so far, meaning a full quarter of televisions in use have been tuned to NBC. Even more bizarre ly, the games are doing their best in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, the places where the tape delay makes the least sense.

&quot;Not going to watch events on tape,&quot; my ass. You&apos;re all tuning in regardless, because, let&apos;s face it, the Olympics make for great TV. It&apos;s less about knowing who wins than actually seeing it happen. Bitch and moan all you want about NBC&apos;s absurd policies, but the one thing that could change it for the future — a lack of viewers — just isn&apos;t happening.

There is hope, though. Last night, NBC didn&apos;t even win the evening. From 8-10, American Idol outdrew the Olympics by four million viewers. So if you really want to send a message, tune in tonight to find out who else made it to the top 24.

Previously in Incorruptible …

Until recently, Max Damage headed the FBI’s most wanted list. Then mankind’s premier defender, the Plutonian, went berserk and blew up the FBI.

After weeks of disappearance, Max has resurfaced, apparently having rededicated his life to superheroism. Max’s sidekick, the severely underage Jailbait, is -- to put it mildly -- unhappy with this bizarre decision. Max’s former enemy, police lieutenant Louis Armadale, is skeptical of Max’s new path. Together, the three have followed a trail of violence to the hidden lab of David Orjean (mockingly known as “Dr. Origin”), where ordinary people (terrified of Plutonian) are paying huge money in hopes of being granted superpowers…

 Incorruptible is quickly becoming one of my favorite comics and the majority of the credit goes to Mark Waid . He has consistently been one of the best writers in the medium for over a decade and he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Issue 3 really showcases Waid’s ability to have fun with the characters without being over the top or campy in his dialogue [...]

 Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle: &quot;Coming out of the break, the offense fell apart again, coming up empty through the final four minutes of a 104-95 loss to the Utah Jazz at Toyota Center on Tuesday. And with the frustration painfully obvious, the Rockets seemed to be looking eagerly for reinforcements. Help could be on the way. While the Knicks shored up their offer to get Tracy McGrady, with rookie Jordan Hill the Rockets primary target, the Bulls have offered forward Tyrus Thomas and center Brad Miller, with the teams negotiating a third piece to come close enough to match McGrady’s $22.46 million contract. The Bulls could offer guards John Salmons or Kirk Hinrich, or the expiring contract of Jerome James. A person with knowledge of the talks said there are ongoing discussions with other teams, that no decisions have been reached about preferences so far and that a decision is unlikely until closer to Thursday’s 2 p.m. deadline. The Rockets, however, left little doubt why they would want help, as the increasingly fragile offense crumbled down the stretch.&quot; Michael Lee of The Washington Post: &quot;Josh Howard, a seventh-year veteran and former all-star, had spent his entire career in Dallas, helping them reach the 2006 NBA Finals and finish with a league-best 67 wins the following season. But his career has fallen on hard times the past two seasons, through injuries and some bizarre off-court incidents. He is averaging 12.5 points per game, his lowest total since his rookie season, and a career-low 40.1 percent shooting after having ankle surgery last summer. &apos;Sometimes you outgrow things and it&apos;s time to move on,&apos; Howard said. &apos;The Mavs are trying to make a push. I know it wasn&apos;t my fault that I got traded. I did everything I could in my ability to help them win. I guess it was time to part ways.&apos; The Wizards have a team option on Howard&apos;s $11.8 million salary next season. He was asked about leaving a perennial playoff contender and joining a team that has underachieved and is next-to-last in the Eastern Conference. &apos;Dallas is a great organization, taught me a lot,&apos; he said. &apos;Being able to go to the playoffs all my years was a blessing, but what I learned down there, I&apos;ll bring up here and hopefully make a positive turnaround. It was a good thing to be spoiled by the Mavs, being able to make it to the playoffs, but we can make a strong push to get that eighth spot or even the seventh spot. I&apos;m coming here with a positive attitude, trying to play hard and get us to the playoffs.&apos; &quot; Berry Tramel of The Oklahoman: &quot;Thunder-Mavericks is the NBA’s version of a May-December romance. Young Thunder. Old Mavs. The Thunder is all fresh legs and summer-camp exuberance. More pimples than a Brady Bunch marathon. The belief that all things are possible. The Mavs are all guile and toughness and wisdom. The knowledge that you’d better win now, for who knows what tomorrow brings. Youth won 99 -86 Tuesday night at the Ford Center, for the reasons you’d expect. The baby Boomers’ defense dogged Dallas and their offense exhausted the Mavs. If you can’t beat ’em, run ’em. Maybe that recipe won’t work in April, should these neighbors meet in what would be a historic playoff series for Oklahoma City. But it worked wonders Tuesday night in a post-All Star showdown that announced to the NBA that the only place these stunningly good Thunders plan to go in the Western Conference playoff race is up.&quot; Tim Cowlishaw of The Dallas Morning News: &quot;The problem with the Mavericks&apos; trade that sent Josh Howard, Drew Gooden, Quinton Ross and James Singleton to Washington isn&apos;t that it was made. It had to be done, given Josh Howard&apos;s 40 percent shooting and his unreliable status. The problem is the lack of time for Rick Carlisle and the Mavericks to do much with it. All that Butler, Haywood (seven points, six rebounds in 15 minutes) and DeShawn Stevenson had in order to ready for this game was one shootaround. The Mavericks host Phoenix tonight, go to Orlando Friday and then have the Miami Heat back in Dallas on Saturday. Tuesday night was the start of 30 games in 58 days for Dallas. So it&apos;s not like Carlisle has any three-hour practice sessions lined up to help incorporate the newest Mavericks into the team.&quot; Joe Freeman of The Oregonian: &quot;The box score will reveal a lopsided Trail Blazers victory. ESPN&apos;s &apos;SportsCenter&apos; will probably show highlights of Rudy Fernandez alley-oop layups, Martell Webster three-pointers and LaMarcus Aldridge jumpers. But hidden beneath the highs of a 109-87 win over the reeling Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday night at the Rose Garden is a potentially devastating blow to the Blazers&apos; playoff hopes. All-Star Brandon Roy, who has been plagued by a nagging strained right hamstring since Jan.2, acknowledged that he is concerned the rest of his season is in jeopardy. &apos;I ... turned to LaMarcus (during the game) and he was like, &apos;So what do you do next?&apos; Roy said. &apos;I was like, &apos;I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t know where to go.&apos; &apos; Roughly an hour before tipoff, Roy walked off the Rose Garden floor after warming up and said he would not play Tuesday night. But 30 minutes later, after a nudge from coach Nate McMillan, Roy decided to give it a go for the first time in 12 games. It did not go well.&quot; Geoff Calkins of The Commercial-Appeal: &quot;Translation: The Grizzlies are really not that good. Yes, the Zach Randolph trade has turned out brilliantly for the team. Yes, O.J. Mayo, Rudy Gay and Gasol have all matured. But the selection of Hasheem Thabeet was a disaster that could haunt the franchise for years, the bench can&apos;t be counted on, and no team should be able to make a playoff run with just four guys who can play. The Grizzlies need more guys. The question is whether they&apos;ll go out and get them by Thursday, whether owner Mike Heisley will allow general manager Chris Wallace the flexibility to make a move. So far, it doesn&apos;t look good. Heisley has indicated he doesn&apos;t want the team to take on a player whose contract extends past this year. That essentially dooms the enterprise. It&apos;s also wildly short-sighted for a franchise that is still building for the future. Why spend valuable assets to get a player who won&apos;t help long term? And don&apos;t say the Grizzlies need the flexibility to sign Gay this offseason. They could add a contract or two and still match any offer to Gay. They might not want to, but they certainly could.&quot; Sam Amick of The Sacramento Bee: &quot;After sitting for nearly the first six minutes of the fourth quarter, Kevin Martin approached the scorer&apos;s table to check in. But a Jason Thompson putback layup had just cut the Celtics&apos; lead to two and the unit that also included Tyreke Evans, Beno Udrih, Spencer Hawes, and Casspi had scored five consecutive points. So Martin, kneeling and waiting to enter, decided to return to the bench. By the time it was over, the player once deemed such a core piece of the organization&apos;s future had played 15 seconds of the final period. With the trade deadline approaching Thursday, it certainly raised a curious question about his status within the organization. While sources continue to report that the Kings aren&apos;t motivated to trade him, the task of actually utilizing him and receiving consistent production remains a challenging one. He finished with 11 points, four rebounds and four assists.&quot; Michael Cunningham of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: &quot;My editor sent me a note today with a question: &apos;Why AREN’T the Hawks in the Amare Stoudemire chase?&apos; So I stopped staring out at my balcony view of Marina del Rey long enough to collect my thoughts on the matter. Tough gig. I know it’s the kind of question Hawks fans have, too. They look at their team’s holes, hear about all the big deals going down (or being talked about) in the league and wish the Hawks would get in on Stoudemire or some other stud. So I will attempt to answer my boss’s question and yours without boring or confusing you: 1. The Suns are looking to shed salary and the Hawks have no large expiring contracts to match up with Amare’s $16.4 million salary other than Joe Johnson’s $15 million. 2. The Hawks aren’t willing to deal J.J. or other core players with value (Smoove, Jamal and Horford) and haven’t received interest in players they might be willing to part with. 3. Hawks ownership, which still must maintain flexibility for its efforts to re-sign Johnson this summer, isn’t inclined to take on future salary. Part of the reason the Suns are looking to deal Stodemire is his $17.7 million player option for next season. Even if Stoudemire doesn’t invoke the option, he’ll be looking to re-sign for a long-term deal.&quot; Perry A. Farrell of the Detroit Free Press: &quot;A left ankle sprain and a strained right groin have slowed Ben Gordon, causing him to miss 19 games. In Tuesday&apos;s victory over Minnesota, shot 4-for-11 for eight points, dropping his season average to 15.5, his field goal percentage to 42.2% and his three-point shooting to 31.1% -- lower than his career numbers of 43.7% and 41.5%. When asked if it bothered him that he hadn&apos;t been 100% during the season, he said: &apos;The most frustrating thing is the losing; that&apos;s the biggest thing. If I came out and played great the whole season and we were losing, it wouldn&apos;t mean anything. There are a lot of things that went into that. Guys had injuries and things like that. I&apos;m looking forward to these next 31 games and going out there and playing like myself and helping us win some games.&apos; &quot; John Jackson of the Chicago Sun-Times: &quot;Barring a new development, there doesn&apos;t appear to be an All-Star on the trading block other than Amare Stoudemire, and there has been no indication the Bulls and Phoenix Suns have talked. So if the Bulls make a deal, it appears it will involve dumping Tyrus Thomas or dumping the salaries of Kirk Hinrich or John Salmons. Basically, management&apos;s decision comes down to this: Does it create as much salary cap as possible this summer, even if it means sacrificing this summer and missing the playoffs? Or, does it see how far this team can go this season, let the young players gain valuable experience with another playoff appearance and worry about the summer after the season? There are strong arguments on both sides. We&apos;ll find out management&apos;s thinking Thursday when the deadline passes at 2 p.m.&quot; Josh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel: &quot;Coach Stan Van Gundy was asked an interesting question following practice today. He was asked whether the Magic have the personnel to get past the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have beaten the Magic twice in two games this season. &apos;I don’t think we have a real matchup problem,&apos; Van Gundy said. &apos;I think we can put certain lineups out there. Any team in the playoffs is going to have areas where they create problems for you no matter what you do with your roster. Hopefully, and I think we do, you’re going to create problems for other teams and you’re going to have to find ways, I guess, to exploit your advantage more than they can exploit theirs. But you’re never going to play a team where they don’t have an advantage somewhere.&apos; The Cavaliers reportedly want to make an upgrade at power forward, either by acquiring Amar’e Stoudemire from Phoenix, Antawn Jamison from Washington or Troy Murphy from Indiana.&quot; Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News: &quot;With that flurry of offseason embellishments, consensus around the league was that the Spurs had done the most of any team to improve their chances of challenging the Los Angeles Lakers for NBA pre-eminence. Eight months later, the same Spurs team that won the offseason is 30-21 after the All-Star break, currently sitting seventh in the Western Conference, and spinning its wheels just to gain traction in one of the most tightly contested playoff races in memory. &apos;Bottom line is, we just haven&apos;t jelled as a group to date,&apos; coach Gregg Popovich said. &apos;We haven&apos;t developed a trust, a communication, a camaraderie on the court. That&apos;s rather strange for us.&apos; As the Spurs and other teams around the NBA have learned, when it comes to the math of offseason additions, there&apos;s no accounting for chemistry.&quot; Ethan J. Skolnick of South Florida Sun-Sentinel: &quot;This time, Michael Beasley got permission. Friday night, the second-year Miami Heat power forward removed his knee brace during the Rookie Challenge in Dallas, then put it back on after Heat President Pat Riley relayed his disapproval through sophomore coach Patrick Ewing. Beasley wore it throughout Monday&apos;s practice, but learned Tuesday morning from team doctors that he wouldn&apos;t need it against the Philadelphia 76ers. Beasley injured his right knee on Jan. 27 against the Toronto Raptors and, after missing two games, returned to average 12.3 points and 6.7 rebounds in six games while wearing the brace. &apos;I got used to it,&apos; Beasley said. &apos;I still don&apos;t like it, but it was on, and there was nothing I could do about it.&apos; Now that it&apos;s off? No big deal. &apos;Knee brace, neck brace, I just want to get up there and run up and down,&apos; Beasley said.&quot; Bob Cooney and Phil Jasner of the Philadelphia Daily News: &quot;As he had hoped, Sixers center Sam Dalembert was able to revisit earthquake-ravaged Haiti during the All-Star break. Dalembert, a Haitian native, left Friday and returned Saturday. Though there has been some improvement since his visit the first week after the Jan. 12 quake, Dalembert is still saddened by what he saw. &apos;It&apos;s kind of crazy,&apos; he said before last night&apos;s game. &apos;Some organizations have storage full of tents and things like that, and we went places where there were 6,000 people without tents. I talked to a group of them, and they were telling me stories, their frustrations ... It&apos;s tough. We talked to another group and managed to get some tents, at least. It&apos;s going to be raining the whole week; rainy season is coming. But at least if they have a tent it&apos;ll be much better.&apos; Since the earthquake, Dalembert has spent most of his waking hours trying to do all he can for the place he called home for his first 14 years of life. It has, no doubt, been draining on the 6-11 center.&quot;

Try to save nature center

Re &quot;Effie Yeaw Nature Center may be felled by budget ax&quot; (Page B1, Feb. 12): Thank you, Sam Stanton, for reporting about the Effie Yeaw Nature Center being exposed to closure with very little advance notice to the public.

It&apos;s an outrage to think the county parks administration would spring this on the supervisors without showing anything but absolute determination to make the center a priority, along with adequate funding for park rangers.

The center is a national model for outdoor education and habitat preservation in an urban area, already operating on a minuscule budget. The county can gouge Effie Yeaw for operating expenses and repairs, then imply it&apos;s too expensive to keep open in a recession. Where is the leadership from county parks on this matter? Do they really want to erase one of the most distinctive attractions in the Sacramento area and destroy the vision of one of this country&apos;s finest educators?

I urge everyone to contact their county supervisor and investigate ways to pledge support for more time and resources to preserve this center&apos;s mission.

Easy to find all the facts



Re &quot;CalPERS needs to be honest,&quot; (Editorials, Feb. 7): You state that the CalPERS Web site is dishonest about the amount of the average retirees&apos; pensions and most ly rely on a single example to support your position to refute a statement by the CalPERS board president.

I believe that you are referring to the &quot;Facts at a Glance&quot; report prepared each month by CalPERS. It has always been my understanding that this document is intended to be a general compilation and readers are invited to call CalPERS with questions and comments. If The Bee had asked, you would find there is a great deal of additional information that CalPERS would provide that could be insightful.

If The Bee had obtained a copy of the CalPERS actuarial report for the state and schools (which is produced every year and is distributed to the Legislature and governor), under the tab Summary of Participant Data there is a host of tables that detail the number of state and school employees (both safety and non-safety) by length of service and age, in addition to other useful data. If you compare one year&apos;s report with previous years, it is possible to get a pretty good idea of the facts surrounding the pension issue.

Health care is government role

Re &quot;Government presumes too much&quot; (Letters, Feb. 10): It appears that some health reform naysayers do not recognize the responsibility of Congress to tax and spend in support of the general welfare.

Letter writer John Paul does not remember that the U.S. Supreme Court in two 1937 decisions (Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548 and Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619, upheld the legality of the 1935 Social Security Act, based on the &quot;tax and welfare&quot; clauses in the Constitution (Article I, Sec. 8); the need for unemployment insurance and old age insurance benefits were recognized by Congress as national problems requiring national solutions.

Currently, the lack of access to health care for 47 million, out-of-control health care cost inflation, and unscrupulous practices in the for-profit health insurance industry are national problems that require national solutions.

The &quot;individual mandate&quot; gives people a choice; the commerce clause in our Constitution permits taxes to cover the loss due to those who elect not to participate in the &quot;individual mandate&quot; for health insurance.

If they join the insurance risk pool, they do not have to pay the tax. If they do not join the risk pool, they raise the cost for others in the insurance pool; they are required to pay the tax so the insurance pool can recoup some of the loss.

It is not a transfer of value from one group to another group; rather, it is a tax to cover one&apos;s responsibility in the risk pool. When those who do not buy insurance get sick, they rely on the emergency room, their family or friends or community clinics. The cost of their care is transferred to others; see for example, the U.S. Supreme Court holding in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942).

Law favors insurance profits

Re &quot;Dems hammer health care hikes,&quot; (Business, Feb. 12): When Sen. Harry Reid bemoans that &quot;greedy insurance companies&quot; place more value in profit than people, he speaks with expertise.

And why not? Federal law allows Medigap insurance providers to make between 25 percent and 35 percent gross profit. Don&apos;t believe that? Check out Chapter 8, page 10 of the Medicare Handbook for 2010.

That&apos;s right, federal law allows it. Harry Reid knows that, but pretends otherwise. By comparison, Exxon makes about 12 percent gross profit. Bank of America about the same. CVS drugstores make half that.

I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;m tired of: politicians who sniff the wind, then bluster about deplorable behavior and pretend they have no connection or responsibility for how the issue became bad. C&apos;mon Harry, just admit you helped drive the public wagon into a ditch. It&apos;s right there in the statutes you helped pass.

– D.W. Collum, Folsom

Make Congress buy insurance

Re &quot;Dems hammer health care hikes,&quot; (Business, Feb. 12): To make health care affordability a level playing field for all Americans, I feel that House and Senate representatives should become independent contractors for the government and work as 10 99 tax-exempt employees. They shall be compensated by receiving commission on the viability and quality of legislation passed.

They further should have to purchase their own health care by negotiating with providers like Anthem Blue Cross and others to experience the horror and dismay of denial, rejection and exploitation.

I know for a fact that many of our country&apos;s decision-makers wouldn&apos;t have access to a policy because of pre-existing conditions. This plan indeed will get bipartisan cooperation to regulate the atrocity of spiraling health care abuse by insurers.

Abolish the Assembly



Re &quot;Nominee battle turns bizarre &quot; (Page A1, Feb. 12):

As potholes widen, people starve on the streets and the budget deficit expands, one must wonder about state government. With the census and redistricting approaching, the obvious priority of both parties is to save their jobs.

As has been mentioned before, the sensible thing would be to abolish the post of lieutenant governor. Maybe back in the days of wooden ships and iron horses it was necessary, but not in this century.

A further step in returning the government to the people would be to abolish the Assembly. As much as most people will not admit it, the people are overrepresented.

Just think – a leaner, more accountable government that actually might do something and at less expense.

That&apos;s why I am &quot;decline-to-state,&quot; as I do not feel represented by either party, particularly in these economic times.

If there’s one wow app that I show people on my iPhone, it is definitely Sleep Cycle by Lexware Labs. Sleep Cycle is a gently alarm that wakes you during the optimum time of your sleep cycle so you feel rested. We most ly use it to analyze how we slept. You set the time that you want to wake up and place your iPhone in the corner of your bed (in airplane mode to avoid radiation). It will wake you sometime during the half hour before your alarm time.

 

The first night I used it was on my birthday, what a geeky present to give myself! At $. 99 you can’t go wrong. This was my first graph.

 

It looked like the classic textbook pattern of alternating deep sleep and REM sleep. Very cool, but did it pick up Doug’s movements as well? I can feel our queen bed move when he does, so we had to do some more research. First we tested the kids. I snuck into Adam’s room and got his cycle.

 

According to the Sleep Cycle examples , a long period of deep sleep like that usually indicates that the iPhone is having trouble detecting movement. But I happen to know for a fact that Adam sleeps like a log. And here was proof.

The next night Dova slept with me in my bed (long history of musical beds in our family). She is a bit lighter, so I was afraid that the iPhone wouldn’t pick up her movements. But right at 7am, she started kicking me for a good hour. It certainly picked that up fine. So we have two kids that slept like logs.

 

Now Doug always claims that he is a light sleeper so he is always needing extra sleep. I never really understood this until I saw his graph.

 

Holy smokes, he hardly gets any deep sleep at all! Al most all his graphs look this way. So he must be disturbing my sleep and my sleep cycle graph thrashing about like that. But the very next night, I put it back on my side. I was really exhausted and was expecting to sleep well.

 

Aha! Even with the thrasher next to me, I can sleep like a log and the iPhone ignores him! And since we had been using the app for a few weeks, there was no issue with phone placement.

I ran across this BBC article that suggests that sleeping together in the same bed may cause mental impairment the next day, especially for men.
 When men spend the night with a bed mate their sleep is disturbed, whether they make love or not, and this impairs their mental ability the next day. Dr. Neil Stanley also said that “Historically, we have never been meant to sleep in the same bed as each other. It is a bizarre thing to do.” I totally disagree. Back in the Little House on the Prairie Days, you HAD to sleep together to stay warm. Animals sleep together and so do humans. I hate to sleep without Doug or one of the kids (with both kids, I get kicked and whacked in the head too much).

We haven’t gone so far as to check Doug’s sleep without me (I always have my phone with my when I’m away for business trips), but at least I have proof that I can sleep like a log even next to the thrasher. 

You can get Sleep Cycle for a mere $. 99 on iTunes here . I know you’re dying to try it!

 Robel Teklemariam , 35, puts on his shorts and, of course, the shades. His skis are made out of an improvised beam of steel supported by a pair of small wheels, but the joy is the same. Rolling down the streets of Addis - Abeba , Ethiopia, our Olympian is preparing himself for the Vancouver Games. 

 Our friend Robel is the sole representative of the state of Ethiopia, where temperatures average between minimal values of 9ºC and maximal values of 28ºC. 

 Like anyother skier goes through the slope, before practise, Robel also analyzes the streets carefully before rolling them down. After all, you don&apos;t want to get either run over by a car or run into some donkey standing in the middle of the street. 

&quot;I think this street is perfect and it does not have a lot of traffic, either,&quot; reports the Olympian to a Portuguese journalist. &quot;Doing this type of training so close to the opening of the Games is not ideal. Obviously it is much better to be on the snow. The only thing good about training here, in Ethiopia, is that the 2700m of altitude gives you good conditioning.&quot;

 You might be wondering, how did this Ethiopian who lives in the dusty and hot city of Addis - Ababa  come to the idea of participating in the Winter Olympics? 

 Well, as a child Teklemariam spent some time in New York, where he had one of his rare encounters wi th snow, but his Olympic wish was aroused many years later, when in 1 99 8 he watched the famous Kenyan skiers from the Nagano Games. In 2006, he realized his dream by participating in the 2006 edition of the Winter Olympics. He ranked No. 84 among 100 competitors. 

 Teklemariam is not the only Olympian hailing from a country where Winter Sports are practically non-existent. 

 The Portuguese Olympian Danny Silva, born in New Jersey, came to Portugal at the age of 14, but he only made his comeback to cross-country skiing many years later, already as a full-grown adult. 

 Silva carries out his practice under temperatures that can rise up to more than 40ºC in the Alentejo , one of the driest regions in Europe. Like Teklemariam , he practices on skis sustained by rollerblades —day in and day out. Occasionally he gets to the slopes in Northern Portugal, but their conditions aren&apos;t enough for an Olympian. 

This Olympian also made his debut in 2006 with a rank of 94 out of 100 participants in cross-country-skiing. As of now, he is only the eight Portuguese citizen who participated in the Winter Olympics.

 Unlike Silva, the Kenyan Philip Boit , who was expecting to finish his career in Nordic skiing wi th his third trip to the Olympics, saw his appeal turned down by the International Ski Federation since he did not fulfill the demanded requisites: 500 points or being among the 50 best athletes in the international competitions. 

 Boit opted for not leaving his family. Therefore, he trained on a regular basis wi th his rolling skis down the dirt tracks under 25ºC temperatures in Eldoret . Whenever it is possible, this Olympian goes to Northern Finland, although the financial and visa limitations cause him a lot of headaches. 

Sponsoring?

&quot;Last year I sold five of my cows in order to raise money to train in Finland.&quot; Now his dream is fading away.

With the establishment of the entry requirements, under the &quot;Eddy The Eagle rule,&quot; these poor athletes have been &quot;banned&quot; from the Winter Olympics. 

Who is Eddie the Eagle?

Eddie &quot;The Eagle&quot; Edwards, the British Ski &quot;Dropper,&quot; as an Italian sportswriter nicknamed him, was the main attraction of the 1988 Olympic Games in Calgary.

The man behind the legend, Michael Edwards, would jump from the ramp, screaming for dear life, and then fall like a dead weight.

However, his big glasses, his tremendous sense of humour, and his big heart made him a fan-favorite, although he ended dead last in all the competitions he went through.

Eddie got to visit many Talk Shows and he was featured in many commercials—a tabloid even payed him €50.000 for his story.

 Most recently, he has participated in the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the 1988 Olympic Games in Calgary, and he was also one of the torchbearers for the 2010 Games held in Vancouver.

 It is precisely these artists that the IFS wants to take out of the Olympic stage, and it is against this precise tyranny that Teklemarian will fight as he makes his debut in the Vancouver Games, thus realizing a dream which began some 13.000km away, under the impeccable African sun.

 [details] [close] received 2 years ago  published 2 years ago  lang: en   Author:  Meenakshi Ganguly Summary:  Nepal’s path to development remains hostage to the lack of accountability over human-rights violations during the country’s civil war, says Meenakshi Ganguly. 
I met Purna Bahadur Sunuwar in early March 2004. It was two weeks after his 15-year-old daughter Maina had been abducted by soldiers from their home in the Kavre district of Nepal, east of the capital Kathmandu. As we sat in his mud house and he told his story, Purna could not hold back tears. He was clear that the army had acted out of vengeance.

Al most three weeks earlier, on 12 February, government troops had killed Maina’s cousin Reena Rasaili, alleging that she was a Maoist insurgent in the civil war that had torn the country since 1 99 6. Maina’s mother, Devi Sunuwar, was at Reena&apos;s house that night. She found the courage to speak to the media and human-rights activists, telling them that her niece had been raped and murdered by the security forces.

The army was quick to retaliate. Nepali soldiers arrived at the Sunuwar family home on 17 February, looking for Devi. They found only her husband and daughter there. They seized Maina, and told Purna Bahadur to come to the local Panchkhal army camp the next day with his wife, saying: &quot;If you come tomorrow, we will know you are innocent, and if you don&apos;t come we&apos;ll know you are guilty.&quot;

The family complied with this threatening order, and arrived at the camp the next day accompanied by local-government officials. But officers at Panchkal denied any knowledge of Maina, telling the family that no one was detained there. The family then visited numerous government offices, but without making success. It was at this time that I visited the Sunuwars’ home. &quot;Nobody has told us so far where our daughter is&quot;, her father lamented.

Maina’s unexplained disappearance is but one symbol of the widespread violations perpetrated by the army during Nepal’s decade-long civil war that claimed 13,000 lives before it was ended with a “ comprehensive peace agreement ” in November 2006. Many families are, like that of Purna Bahadur Sunuwar, waiting for justice.

 The block 

The transition from war to peace and a political settlement in Nepal has been difficult. Even the election in April 2008 of a new constituent-assembly charged with drafting a new constitution - which was won by the Maoists’ political party and led to the establishment of a coalition government - has not been able to resolve the country’s deep-rooted differences (see Michael Hutt ed., Himalayan People&apos;s War: Nepal&apos;s Maoist Rebellion [Indiana University Press, 2004]).

An important outstanding issue has been the integration of the combatants of the (Maoist) People’s Liberation Army into the regular army. There is some progress here after four years of dispute since the 2006 agreement, with a start to the discharging of former child soldiers who had remained attached to the Maoist army and been held in cantonments. Now they can get on with rebuilding their lives.

Beyond this process there remains doubt over whether Nepal’s leading political forces - the Maoists, other political parties, and the army - are willing to take the hard decisions needed to rebuild the country, or whether they will plunge Nepal back into crisis and possibly another round of conflict. Nepal’s friends and allies abroad must decide whether and how to press these forces to act in a constructive spirit.

Nepal’s political evolution since the peace deal underscores the need for action. Many Nepalis hoped that the government formed after the April 2008 elections would usher in a new era, breaking the feudalism of a discredited and discarded monarchy and setting the country on a path of development to alleviate some of Asia’s most entrenched poverty (see Prashant Jha, “ Nepal’s Maoist landslide ”, 16 April 2008).

Instead, the various political parties descended into vicious wrangling for power and position. The needs of governance have been made hostage to a standoff between the two real power-holders: the Maoists (who quit the government in May 2009) and the army. One consequence of this gridlock is a failure to address the serious human-rights abuses committed by both sides during the conflict. The power-games in Kathmandu leave justice and accounting for past atrocities in limbo.

In these circumstances, the family of Maina Sunuwar is symbolic of the thwarting of the hopes of 2006 by political calculation, uncertainty and lack of will.

 The process 

Two months after Maina Sunuwar disappeared in February 2004, a message from the Nepali army headquarters in Kathmandu informed her mother that Maina had been killed and that her clothes and other materials things had been sent to the police. In March 2005, diplomatic pressure led the army to form a board of inquiry charged with investigating Maina’s fate. The board heard testimony from thirteen people, including army officers; it concluded that after being subject to repeated near-drowning and electric-shocks, she had died in custody the day that she was taken from the family home. In fact, when Maina’s family arrived at the army camp looking for her, she had already been buried there. 

The board recommended that a court-martial be convened to try three officers for Maina’s death . This, one of the few human-rights cases to go to trial, opened in September 2005. But it ended in a travesty of justice, for the officers were found guilty only to the lesser charges of using inappropriate interrogation techniques and of disposing of Maina’s body improperly. The sentence of six months in prison proved no punishment, since they had already spent that period confined to barracks during investigations and were as a result set free.

The Nepali armed forces have repeatedly claimed that their own military-justice system can best prosecute “internal” wrongdoers. The fact that the process, including court-martial proceedings, is closed to the public always cast doubt on these claims. The Maina Sunuwar case was clinching evidence that the system failed to deliver justice. 

Maina’s family, outraged by the farcical outcome, filed a complaint with the civilian police against the three military officers - and named another, Captain Niranjan Basnet, who had been present when Maina was taken. In March 2007, the United Nations office of the high commissioner for human rights helped the police exhume Maina’s body. The supreme court then issued an order that Maina’s case should be investigated within three months. In January 2008, the public prosecutor in Kavre district filed murder charges against the four army officers (including Basnet). But none of the four was arrested, and they failed to appear for trial.

In September 2009, the district court ordered the army to suspend Basnet, who had since been promoted to major, and asked army headquarters to submit all the files containing the statements recorded during the military court of inquiry. The army has to date refused to comply; it contends that, despite the supreme-court’s ruling, civilian courts do not have jurisdiction over military personnel.

A further bizarre aspect of this case is that even while the murder charges were pending against Niranjan Basnet, he was sent on a UN peacekeeping mission to Chad. In December 2009, when the UN discovered that the major had been charged with involvement in Maina’s torture and murder, he was shipped back to Nepal and placed by the army in military custody - though the army still refuses to produce him for trial (see “ Nepal: Hand Over Murder Suspect to Police ”, Human Rights Watch , 14 December 2009).

 The wait 

This unresolved situation places a particular responsibility on those countries - Britain, the United States and India - which played a significant role in bringing the conflict in Nepal to an end, and which had halted military assistance to Kathmandu out of concern over human-rights violations. These countries, like the Nepali people themselves, would like to see the country embark on a path toward development. But it cannot be right that support for development comes at the cost of accountability.

India has already resumed partial military assistance to the Nepali army, and Washington is engaged in discussion on the same issue (see Manjushree Thapa, “ India in its Nepali backyard ”, 2 May 2008).

. The British army’s chief-of-staff, General David Richards , visited Nepal in February 2010 and stated there that his government would review its military aid to Nepal. He also urged the government to address allegations of human-rights abuses, including the case of Maina Sunuwar, only to be rebuffed by Nepal’s defence minister Bidhya Bhandari; the minister said that human-rights activists were making “unnecessary accusations” and that the three soldiers found guilty in the Maina case by the army’s internal court “had already been punished” (see Phanindra Dahal, “ Bhandari defends army over rights violation ”, Kathmandu Post , 9 February 2010).

Nepal’s government and army have consistently failed to investigate, prosecute and punish soldiers who committed serious violations of human rights. This is reason enough for influential countries to be careful in their dealings with the authorities in Kathmandu - and to continue to seek justice for Maina Sunuwar.

Purna Bahadur Sunuwar, Maina’s father, died heartbroken in October 2009. Maina’s mother is still waiting. Maina’s remains are in a forensic laboratory, her last rites are yet to be performed. Her killers remain free.

 Scorsese eyes new fare for Taxi Driver

Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are said to be planning a remake of the seminal 1976 film, with Lars von Trier as a new collaborator

In what is surely the most bizarre rumour to emerge from this year&apos;s Berlin film festival, it is whispered that Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are preparing a remake of Taxi Driver, their 1970s tale of a man who stood up, saw clearly and shaved his hair into a mohawk. Only this time, it transpires, they may have a fresh passenger on board – Lars von Trier could be riding shotgun.

Copenhagen film magazine Ekko reports that Scorsese is currently discussing the possibility of a rebooted Taxi Driver with the Danish director in tow. It remains to be seen whether this will be a remake or a sequel, or so much hot air of the kind that has a tendency to swirl around the mischievous Von Trier. Speaking to the magazine, Peter Aalbæk, Von Trier&apos;s producing partner at Zentropa studios, would &quot;neither confirm nor deny&quot; the rumour, but said that an announcement would be made shortly.

De Niro starred in eight films by Scorsese, beginning with Mean Streets in 1973 and continuing through to 1 99 5&apos;s Casino. Speaking at the Berlin film festival this weekend, the director admitted that they had plans to renew their collaboration, hinting at a return to the crime stories that forged their respective reputations. &quot;Bob De Niro and I are talking about something that has to do with that world,&quot; Scorsese said. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt about that. We&apos;re working on something like that. But it&apos;s from the vantage point of older men looking back. None of this running around stuff.&quot;

Shot back in 1976, the original Taxi Driver charted the downward spiral of Travis Bickle, a New York cabbie turned gun-toting vigilante. The film was hailed by critics as a bleak satire on the cult of celebrity and the role of the American loner. The film ends with Bickle being celebrated by the press as a have-a-go-hero after he rescues a child prostitute from the clutches of her pimp.

The idea of a Taxi Driver sequel was first floated a few years ago by Paul Schrader, who wrote the original script . &quot;I was talking with Martin Scorsese about doing a sequel to Taxi Driver, where [Bickle] is older,&quot; Schrader told the New York Post.

Scorsese is in Berlin to promote his latest film, Shutter Island , a thriller based on the bestselling book by Dennis Lehane. Von Trier&apos;s previous picture, Antichrist , was one of the most controversial releases of last year, sparking a smattering of boos when it debuted at the Cannes film festival. He is currently reported to be in pre-production on the science-fiction drama Melancholia .

Films by Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese may be the headline-grabbers at the festival this year, but the real gems, such as Banksy&apos;s new creation, are to be found elsewhere

The star of this year&apos;s 60th anniversary Berlin film festival was crowned in his (inevitable) absence: Banksy, the British street artist, situationist, anarchist and all-round genius presented us with his movie Exit Through the Gift Shop . The man himself only appeared in darkness, with his voice distorted. This was both tricksy self-portrait and cheeky docu-scam, satirising contemporary art craziness.

Blanked-out tongue somewhere in his pixellated cheek, Banksy tells us the story of his supposed relationship with a hyperactive French videographer, one Thierry Guetta, who has, it seems, been following him around – Boswell to Banksy&apos;s Johnson. A few years back, allegedly encouraged by Banksy this man apparently suddenly stopped being an amateur cameraman and suddenly turned into a self-taught street artist called Mr Brainwash, flogging his suspiciously accomplished Warhol-Banksy knockoffs in LA for tens of thousands of dollars. And these works do exist; you can buy them – which is more than you can say for the creations of Nat Tate, that mysterious individual playfully chronicled by William Boyd in 1 99 8. Though little known to the common herd, &quot;Mr Brainwash&quot; may come to be accepted as an important artist, the way Andrew and Imogen Quest became revered socialites in Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Vile Bodies. Anyway, Mr Brainwash is one of Banksy&apos;s most enjoyable creations.

Exit Through the Gift Shop is an entertaining guide to Banksy&apos;s exploits, which are endlessly gripping and hilarious. He has gloriously mocked Israel&apos;s West Bank wall with his graffiti; he has ripped a London phone box in half and he has apparently fabricated boxfuls of £10 notes with Princess Diana&apos;s face on them, so realistic that they could get him imprisoned for forgery. Is it true? Is the story itself a forgery? Or is the point that Banksy&apos;s art inhales the spirit of forgery, making free with established images, brand currencies and the emblems of power? Who knows? Banksy&apos;s film is an enjoyable stunt: not quite Man On Wire, but Man Completely Wired .

On a more serious note, the festival gave us the colossal premiere of the restored Metropolis by Fritz Lang , returning in its complete form – after lost footage was discovered two years ago in Buenos Aires – to the city where it was first unveiled in 1927. The new two-and-a-half hour Metropolis was performed with a live orchestral accompaniment, and the rediscovered segments were obvious for being fizzier and grainier than the rest, as if viewed through heavy rain. Fritz Lang&apos;s bizarre sci-fi dystopian fairytale noir now looks bigger, madder, absurder and more fascinating than ever. Its story of a city serviced by underground slaves is even more satirically relevant in 2010, as we witness the disintegration of the urban fantasy of Dubai, built on credit and globalised labour. Metropolis is a bad-trip premonition of the 20th-century&apos;s ideologies of class and race, and the &quot;stadium&quot; scenes of super-fit patrician sportsmen running really do look like something by Leni Riefenstahl, who has a tiny resemblance to Lang&apos;s heroine Maria. Maria, of course, fervently expects the appearance of a messianic Mediator who will save this corrupt city-state, a Mediator she calls &quot;Mittler&quot;. Did Germany&apos;s collective unconscious mis-hear that name?

The festival&apos;s official opening film was a surprisingly low-key choice, but still outstanding: Apart Together , by the Chinese director and former Golden Bear winner Wang Quan&apos;an. Berlin is a festival which loves its stars and red-carpet glamour, and the decision to open with this quiet, heartfelt movie from a relatively little-known name, rather than the headline-grabbers such as Roman Polanski&apos;s The Ghost Writer and Martin Scorsese&apos;s Shutter Island which were also on the bill, was criticised in the German press here .

But in my view, Berlin could not have got off to a better start than with this outstanding movie: a wonderfully gentle, intimate, wonderfully composed family drama that, like Hirokazu Kore-eda&apos;s Japanese film Still Walking , might contribute to a new world cinema trend: neo-Ozu.

Ling Feng plays Lui Yangsheng, a former soldier in the Kuomintang, who was exiled as a young man to Taiwan, forced to leave behind the woman he loved and their baby. He remarried, but now as a very old widower, Lui returns to Shanghai to make contact with his lost love Qiao Yue (Lisa Lu), who herself married long ago and is now a grandmother. His re-appearance causes excitement and then astonishment and outrage in Qiao Yue&apos;s family when it becomes clear that this stranger has never stopped loving her, and now wishes to take her back with him to Taiwan, offering up to the family his (modest) savings and pension. Everyone is disturbed, except, it seems, for Qiao Yue&apos;s husband – a terrific performance from Xu Caigen – who remains heart-rendingly friendly and polite to the stranger, apparently on the grounds that his wife once loved him. But is there something more complex, more enigmatic going on in this man&apos;s heart and mind? A trio of outstanding performances makes this film one of the gems of the festival.

Sadly, the only way was down after this, with the awful Howl , by Rob Epstein, a documentarist much admired for his 1984 non-fiction film about Harvey Milk. James Franco plays Ginsberg, apparently chatting to an off-camera interviewer at the very moment that his publisher, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, was fighting a censorship battle in court: Jon &quot;Mad Men&quot; Hamm plays the goodie defending attorney and David Strathairn plays the baddie prosecutor. We get toe-curlingly embarrassing &quot;animated&quot; sequences – which I can only describe as a sexed-up version of the twee cartoons that used to accompany prog tracks on the BBC&apos;s Old Grey Whistle Test – supposedly dramatising the passionate swirl of Ginsberg&apos;s poetry. This is endlessly, boringly, declaimed and re-declaimed. Reams of stuff re-appear. Sometimes we see Franco doing the declaiming, at a live reading, to an irritating collection of nodding, smiling and generally appreciative cap-wearing hipsters, who made me long for the re-introduction of national service. The film is quite extraordinarily repetitive and dull, with no real insight into Ginsberg&apos;s life, sexuality or writing.

The festival&apos;s new German cinema sidebar offered Renn, Wenn Du Kannst or Run, If You Can , by Dietrich Brüggemann: a serio-comic twentysomething relationship picture, starring Robert Gwisdek as Ben, a young man who has been confined to using a wheelchair following an incident which is not fully revealed until the last act. He is smart, acid, cynical, secretly despairing, having fallen in love with a woman that he has whimsically encouraged his long-suffering volunteer carer to chat up. There are shrewd, painful insights here about the relationships possible, and perhaps not possible, between disabled and non-disabled people. But I felt that a small, sharp, real film had got lost inside a bigger, more unfocused heart-tugging comedy.

Thomas Vinterberg, the Danish Dogme veteran, had a new film at Berlin: Submarino was the story of two brothers who were traumatised as boys by a neglectful and alcoholic mother, a formative agony which lays the foundation for a tragic adulthood on both. The movie is presented in dramatic-diptych form, passing from the story of one brother to the other: it was heartfelt and engaging, well acted and put across with power. Like Susanne Bier&apos;s Danish film Brothers, this could well find itself being remade by Hollywood .

The New Romanian Wave saw another new and important contributor emerge in Berlin. If I Want to Whistle, I Whistle , by the first-time film-maker Florin Serban, is set in a grim youth prison, where Silviu – a great performance from 19-year-old George Pistereanu – has only five days to go before release. Yet he is tipped over the edge by an unexpected visit from his kid brother, a crisis which results in violence and a gripping hostage situation. Berlin is sometimes accused of being low-key compared with Cannes and Venice – but there are some powerful, valuable films.

A publication that proposes to &quot;explore the history, culture, arts, politics and society of California&quot; is taking on quite a challenge, but that&apos;s the goal of a quarterly now accepting submissions from &quot;creative voices&quot; – writers, photographers and artists.

 Boom: A Journal of California, scheduled to debut next February, will focus on &quot;informed, critical perspectives about the past, present and future of the state.&quot; Creativity and &quot;unusual formats&quot; are encouraged.

Boom will be published by the University of California Press and co-edited by two UC Davis professors. Carolyn de la Peña teaches American studies and directs the UC Davis Humanities Institute; Louis Warren teaches history.

&quot;We think it&apos;s the right time to bring (to the forefront) some different perspectives about issues we&apos;re facing in California,&quot; de la Peña said on the phone.

&quot;We&apos;re especially interested in (written-word and visual) stories that connect specific places and issues with larger concerns. For example, if you wrote a piece about a festival in your town, you would need to show how it&apos;s raising an issue about California as a whole and the challenges we face.&quot;

Ruled by the world&apos;s last military junta, Burma is shunned by both governments and tourists. Yet its people are crying out for contact. So what&apos;s the ethical traveller to do?

On the boat to Mandalay the same thoughts kept turning in my mind. The red orb of a full moon ­appeared, casting streaks of gold across the placid water of the Irrawaddy river, but even this beauty failed to displace the questions that haunted our two-week stay earlier this month. Why were we in Burma? Was our trip giving comfort to the country&apos;s military dictatorship, by common consent one of the world&apos;s worst regimes?

Burma never has been a popular destination, and after the bloody ­suppression of the monks&apos; protests in September 2007 and the government&apos;s delay in helping hundreds of thousands who lost everything in Cyclone Nargis the following May, the tourist trickle al most dried up. Only 47,161 people came from Europe last year, mainly from France and Germany, making Burma the country least visited by ­British people anywhere in Asia (with the exception of North Korea).

So was our party of visitors wrong to buck the trend? Not if you go by the number of people who eagerly ­approached us to practise their English and, after a tentative start, wanted to say what they thought of their rulers. &quot;They&apos;re mad,&quot; one driver told us as he steered his creaking banger past a crush of Chinese bicycles and motorbikes, the commonest form of transport on Burma&apos;s rutted roads.

In decades of reporting I have ­generally stuck to journalism&apos;s rule number one: don&apos;t quote taxi drivers. But in a few places (Manhattan, Havana, and now Burma) you meet such a ­variety of characters forced to earn a living behind the wheel that their opinions offer a broad range of views. This driver had trained as a computer engineer before serving in a Burmese embassy in a western country. &quot;Life is not improving here,&quot; he said. &quot; Most people don&apos;t like the government. We have no legislative body. We have no democracy.&quot; (Apologies for breaking journalism&apos;s rule number two: don&apos;t use anonymous quotes if they are ­pejorative. In Burma, critical sources deserve protection.)

Another driver was making political comments within five minutes of our hiring him from Rangoon airport into town. Asked if it was our first trip to Burma, I said yes, and then added, &quot;I see you call it Burma.&quot; &quot;Burma good name, Myanmar new name,&quot; he replied mischievously. When we ­inquired what the attractive gardens were behind locked gates on the left, &quot;That was the university. Now closed,&quot; he commented. &quot;Because of the ­demonstrations, when we had ­demonstrations. They moved all the universities out of Rangoon. Now it&apos;s quiet,&quot; he added, before smiling ­sarcastically: &quot;Good idea.&quot;

An intelligence officer, I wondered fleetingly, working at the airport to test arriving foreigners? If so, he wasn&apos;t much of an expert, since his only ­question, apart from whether it was our first trip, was where we came from. The one good thing he found to say of the ­regime was that it had ­allowed English to be taught again in primary schools. &quot;For a time they stopped it. The army doesn&apos;t like ­English but now it&apos;s OK again.&quot; That certainly seemed to be true. ­Rangoon&apos;s main shopping street is brimming with cramped ­bookshops, full of English grammar and vocabulary manuals. Similar titles were laid out on the ­pavements alongside food stalls and fruit-drink stands.

In contrast to Thailand, where ­linguistic communication is a struggle and faces in public transport are blank and unwelcoming, Burmese friendliness is a delight. Burma is multi-ethnic and, until the military coup of 1962, was open to the world. For decades its elite spoke good English and even today most people in Rangoon and Mandalay have a smattering. Keenness for contact with foreigners is strong, for its own sake and as resistance to enforced isolation.

Of course, some friendliness is ­commercially driven. Vendors with bright smiles and the chat-up line &quot;Where are you from?&quot; can turn into leeches at some sites. But genuine ­curiosity is more common. In the hour before sunset, when tourists routinely climb the thousand or more steps to Mandalay Hill, young monks emerge to engage in conversation, especially delighted to meet someone who speaks &quot;real English&quot;.

The regime itself uses English for a few publications. Who buys them is hard to say, except perhaps the diplomatic community. They offer a dreary diet of ministerial visits to new hydro­electric projects, with the one benefit of reminding you that Burma is the last country in the world ruled by a military junta: the minister for ­information is a brigadier-general; the minister for construction is a major-general. More bizarre ly, so too is the minister for culture.

One copy of the government-owned newspaper New Light of Myanmar that I picked up showed the ministers of culture of Cambodia, Laos, Burma and Vietnam at a recent conference. In full military dress and medals, Burma&apos;s minister looked eccentric beside his three conventionally suited counterparts.

The junta wants to shed its anachronistic image. Elections announced for this year are ­intended to give the regime a civilian face, of a sort anyway. The new constitution provides for a presidential system with 14 regional governments. Sizeable blocks of seats will be reserved for the army, and the commander-in-chief will have extraordinary powers. Aung San Suu Kyi, the icon of the opposition ­National League for Democracy – which won the last elections in 1 99 0 but was prevented from taking office – is of course still under house arrest. But even if she were not, this new consti­tution bars her from standing for ­president. The poll will be tightly ­controlled in other ways and opposition groups are unlikely to have much room to campaign, ­although election regu­lations have not yet been finalised.

While people&apos;s willingness to give foreigners their opinions was the biggest surprise of our trip, the amount of access people have to dissenting views also ran counter to our preconceived picture. The BBC&apos;s Burmese radio ­service is widely heard. An Oslo-based exile TV station, the Democratic Voice of Burma, can be picked up by satellites that are easily available. Rangoon and Mandalay have numerous internet ­cafes, which are invariably full. When I clicked on the BBC website in Burmese it came up promptly.

To resist this, the regime makes the feeblest of propaganda efforts. For a flavour, take the instructions that ­appear under the bizarre headline The People&apos;s Desire in newspapers and on occasional roadside hoardings: 1. Oppose those relying on External ­Elements, acting as stooges, holding negative views; 2. Oppose those trying to jeopardise the stability of the state and national progress; 3. Oppose foreign nations interfering in the internal affairs of the state; 4. Crush all internal and external destructive elements as the common enemy.

The fourth of these points encapsulates the junta&apos;s preferred strategy for handling criticism – repression. The country has around 2,100 political ­prisoners, including many of the monks who led the 2007 street protests from Rangoon&apos;s majestic Shwedagon ­Pagoda. Dozens were shot and killed during those protests, and public ­assembly is still severely restricted. The authorities are so determined to prevent crowds gathering that they have even fenced off a corner of the vast concourse, full of minor temples and Buddha statues, that surrounds the Shwedagon&apos;s golden stupa in Rangoon. This corner contains a monument to student demonstrators killed by the British in 1920, and the regime wants no parallels drawn or flowers placed in memory of more recent deaths.

Britain&apos;s long occupation

For British visitors, the monument is a useful reminder of Britain&apos;s long occupation of Burma, the most graphic account of which can be found in George Orwell&apos;s Burmese Days, a ­fictionalised memoir of the odious colleagues he worked with as an imperial policeman in northern Burma in the 1920s. The book is certainly an essential text if you want to understand the racism, brutality and violence which the ­British empire entailed, and another key text for any visitor to Burma is ­Amitav Ghosh&apos;s epic, The Glass Palace, covering three generations of two ­Burmese and Indian families. One of its most powerful sections covers the dilemma confronting Burmese nationalists during the second world war – whether to support the Japanese against the British Raj, or defend the very empire they had long sought to overthrow. The most prominent leader to face this agonising choice was Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s father, General Aung San, who first joined the Japanese but came back to the British side.
One morning in Rangoon we tracked down his house, a rambling wooden building with delicately carved gables on a hillock in a northern suburb. It has long been closed to Burmese but, according to the guidebooks, foreigners could wander in and admire family photographs, some showing the young Aung San Suu Kyi. Not any more. &quot;Only on 19 July,&quot; a gardener told us through the locked railings. That is the anniversary of the day Aung San, by then Burma&apos;s prime minister, was murdered by a political rival on the eve of independence.

Where there are faint signs of hope for Burma is in the aid field. Thanks to an international boycott, Burma receives less help than any other country in the world. This is one reason for the catastrophic rates of infant mortality and child malnutrition. But in recent months western governments have started to think again, since the denial of assistance hits only Burma&apos;s poorest. Foreign donors are stepping up develop­ment aid on top of the ­emergency grants supplied after Cyclone Nargis, which left an estimated 140,000 dead or missing.

The junta&apos;s initial reaction to the ­cyclone was to refuse international help. It carried on with a refer­endum on the new ­constitution, as though Nargis had not happened. This further blackened its image. But under pressure from governments in the Association of South-Eastern Asian Nations (Asean), the junta changed its line and inter­national aid agency officials now say the regime has been working well with the UN and Asean in agreeing programmes, priorities and relief projects, and allowing donor money to reach people. ­Foreign aid workers get permits to ­enter the ­affected areas in the ­Irrawaddy delta. Big western non-­governmental ­organisations such as Oxfam and Save the Children are well-established in Burma, with a network of local staff.

As tourists, we were allowed to spend a day in Twante, one cyclone-­affected area about 20 miles out of Rangoon. A driver whom we found ­independently invited us home to lunch where his wife and other women relatives were feeding two dozen monks, a gesture the family makes about twice a year, he said. The temples played a key role in collecting clothes, food and money for cyclone victims. Private companies funded the rebuilding of many houses and schools.

After the disaster, Burmese students and other young people poured into the area to help. Some were so moved that they later set up aid projects and small NGOs without government ­obstruction, we were told. As a result, according to a western aid worker who travels regularly to Burma, Cyclone Nargis has resulted in a broadening of independent civil society activity.

Suspend travel bans

Optimists argue that the institutional changes enshrined in the new consti­tution will also enlarge the space for progress. There may be a clampdown in advance of the poll, one observer said, but the fact that Burma will have legislative bodies at national and local levels for the first time in more than a generation gives scope for wider ­debate. The International Crisis Group, which often reflects the views of the liberal wing of the western diplomatic elite, takes a similar line. &quot;Even assuming that the intention of the regime is to consolidate military rule rather than begin a transition away from it, such processes often lead in unexpected ­directions,&quot; it wrote in an analysis of the pre-election scene.
The group suggests western governments suspend their travel bans on junta members, resume normal contact and push the message that political prisoners must be released and election campaigning be allowed to go ahead freely. The Obama administration has also announced a shift in US policy on Burma towards engagement rather than isolation, though without ­specifying any concrete steps.

According to articles on the online opposition website Irrawaddy, Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s party, the National League for Democracy, is involved in a tough internal debate over whether to take part in the elections. It might back certain candidates even if, as is ­assumed, it is barred from competing in its own right. Taking part would ­allow the party&apos;s supporters to revive their networks and contacts.

Meanwhile, the western investment boycott has left the field open to Chinese companies. They are especially visible in Mandalay, which has a large mall called the Great Wall Shopping Centre. &quot;People respect the Chinese – they think they&apos;re cleverer than Burmese,&quot; said a young man who studied briefly in ­another Asean country. &quot;They don&apos;t like Indians because Indians were the main agents of the British occupation. But the Chinese are taking over. They&apos;re close to the regime. Each side helps the other. It&apos;s like a mafia,&quot; he added.

Back, then, to the nagging question: should we have toured a country with so bad a regime and such little prospect of improvement? This young man had no doubt. &quot;Bring in tourists who can spread the word from the outside world and also tell people in their own countries about Burma,&quot; he said.

In Britain, the Burma Campaign UK criticises tourism and investment and publishes a &quot;dirty list&quot; of firms that do business with Burma. This includes travel companies as well as the Lonely Planet guidebooks. The campaign&apos;s website contains a December 2002 quote from Aung San Suu Kyi: &quot;We have not yet come to the point where we encourage people to come to Burma as tourists.&quot;

Two other exile lobbies, Voices for Burma and Free Burma Coalition, which used to support a tourism boycott now take the opposite view. Voices for Burma also enlists Aung San Suu Kyi, though its sourcing is flimsy. Its website says: &quot;According to a close acquaintance, not yet identified but reportedly from her party, the National League of ­Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been quoted as saying that travel to her country can now be encouraged, provided arrangements are made through private organisations. She now believes that tourism might be beneficial, should the result of the visit draw attention to the oppression of the people by the military junta.&quot;

While favouring engagement, Voices for Burma and the Free Burma Coalition urge tourists to do as much as possible to help private Burmese citizens and not put money in the government&apos;s pocket, and in fact it is possible to do so now as a tourist. Some fees, such as the entrance ticket for the ruined city of Bagan, the visa charge and airport departure tax, cannot be escaped. But in 2003 the government dropped the requirement that every tourist change $200 at an official exchange place. ­Instead of going on a package or using a UK- or Bangkok-based tour company that inevitably has contacts with the Burmese government, visitors can travel on their own by picking one of the many family-owned Burmese travel agents that work from tiny ­offices in Rangoon. You make your ­arrangements either on the spot or by email in advance. There are also ­numerous family-owned guesthouses and restaurants and thousands of ­private souvenir-makers and sellers. Thanks to the web, details of how to plan your trip are readily available.

The big decision is whether to go at all. No one should imagine tourism is automatically going to make Burma a better place. But can anyone credibly argue the tourism boycott has made it better either?

 --Jeff VanderMeer 
 Nobody ever gets over their first camel.
 --Bryher 
I love lists and am wary of them. They are a being that is half parlor game, half manifesto. And half a few other things, too, including whatever&apos;s in the dumpster outside my friend Maury&apos;s apartment in Detroit. (My arithmetic skills are impressive, I know. And I don&apos;t have a friend name Maury. I&apos;m not sure I even know anybody who lives in Detroit.)

The years 2000-2009 were important ones in my life as a reader, though, and I would like to memorialize them with something. I could spend the next decade making lists of books from the previous decade, but I&apos;ve probably got better things to do. Instead, here&apos;s a list of books that come to mind this morning, Saturday, 13 February 2010, when I think about the previous ten years. I&apos;ll most ly, though not exclusively, stick to fiction here, because I read tons of nonfiction but in a very different way from fiction. Some links are to my reviews or notes about the books, though in cases of books I haven&apos;t written about or haven&apos;t written about online, I&apos;ve included a link to The Book Depository , unless I knew of a better source of information.

Here&apos;s the list:


 

 Far Away  by Caryl Churchill (2000). It&apos;s a tough choice between Far Away and A Number , but Far Away  got to me first, and though I had enjoyed and admired and even loved some of Churchill&apos;s earlier work, Far Away  was the one that made me a devoted fan. Few plays are as visionary and bold and yet simple in their expression; it&apos;s like a single raindrop that contains a universe. 
 Light Action in the Caribbean  by Barry Lopez (2000). When I went to the Bread Loaf Writer&apos;s Conference in the summer of 2000, Barry Lopez was my workshop leader, and he was the perfect person for me to encounter at that particular moment in my life.  Light Action  is not a perfect collection, by any means -- there are a couple real clunkers in it -- but it contains a number of haunting and beautiful stories as well as at least one masterpiece: &quot; The Mappist&quot; . Yes, it&apos;s very Borgesian, but it&apos;s Borges via Lopez, and that&apos;s a heavenly match to me. 
 Pastoralia by George Saunders (2000). What a great way for the 2000s to begin! This book is the  Saunders collection for me, which is not to say the others are bad (they&apos;re not), but that this one contains pretty much the full range of his wonders, from the hilarious and monstrous title story to &quot;Sea Oak&quot; to &quot;Winky&quot; to the utterly perfect final story, &quot;The Falls&quot;. 
 The Stories of Paul Bowles  (2001). The first nearly-complete collection of stories by one of the writers closest to my heart. 
 Homebody/Kabul  by Tony Kushner (2001, etc.). Various versions of this play exist, and they&apos;re all breathtaking. I read it when it was first published by Theatre Communications Group, then saw one of the revised texts performed by Steppenwolf in 2003. It was always astounding, and seems to me Kushner&apos;s greatest accomplishment so far, and one of the greatest of all American plays. 
 Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Marriage by Alice Munro (2001). Choosing one Munro collection is tough, and there&apos;s plenty I love about her others of the decade, especially Runaway  (which includes one of my favorite stories of the decade, &quot;Silence&quot;), but Hateship, Friendship...  was the book that sealed the deal for me, that made me go back and read as much Munro as I could get my hands on, and that has kept me a passionate fan ever since. I don&apos;t know of many writers, past or present, who so subtly and effectively capture the lineaments of memory and consciousness, the drifting borderlands between dream and experience. 
 Topdog/Underdog by Suzan-Lori Parks (2001). It was a year of great plays with dichotomous titles. Parks has not, for me, ever exceeded the brilliance of the plays collected in The America Play: And Other Works , but Topdog  is a great distillation of many of her concerns and motifs. 
 The Goat, or, Who Is Sylvia? by Edward Albee (2002). Yes, it al most counts as minor Albee, but minor Albee is still better than major al most anybody else, and it rises above being minor by encapsulating so much of the absurd tragicomedy that is American bourgeois existence -- especially all of our assumptions about family, love, and sex. I was lucky enough to see it in its first run in New York, and it was one of the highlights of theatre-going for me during the decade. 
 

 Things That Never Happen  by M. John Harrison (2002). I could perhaps justify putting Harrison&apos;s  Anima  on this list, for though its two novels were not published during the past decade, the experience of reading them together in Anima is different from reading them separately. But Harrison&apos;s short stories are as good as, if not better than, the best of his novels, and Things That Never Happened gives us a view of his full range as a writer. It&apos;s a devastating collection -- or, rather, corruscating is perhaps the best term. Some of these stories are among the best of the last fifty years or so in English, I believe. 
 The Reservoir by Donna Stonecipher (2002). I didn&apos;t read nearly enough poetry during the 2000s, but this collection is one of the ones I cherished. I can&apos;t describe it -- get a copy, read it, and you&apos;ll understand. These poems are magic. 
 

 Hitchcock&apos;s Films Revisited  by Robin Wood (2002). I would have included this book on the list even if  Robin Wood  hadn&apos;t died recently, but his death makes it feel all the more necessary here. When I first encountered it about a year ago, it changed the way I saw Hitchcock&apos;s movies. More importantly, though, I think it&apos;s an extraordinary mix of autobiography and analysis -- were I teaching a graduate course on autobiography and/or memoir, I&apos;d include it alongside Delany&apos;s  The Motion of Light in Water  -- very different books, with different purposes, but united in challenging us to perceive the world in complex ways, and to recognize the complexities of representing those perceptions in texts. 
 

 Women Writing Africa vols. 1-IV  (2003-2008). Published by The Feminist Press, this is the most impressive series of anthologies I saw during the decade. When I think of the work that went into these books, and how much they make available to us now, and how many gaps and blind spots and holes and injustices they fill, cover, and recover -- when I think of what is here, it honestly brings tears to my eyes. I am grateful that my university library has all four volumes; I wish I could give copies to every library in the world. 

 
 Elizabeth Costello  by J.M. Coetzee (2003). Here&apos;s another book I hope to write more about eventually, though I&apos;ve written about some of  Coetzee&apos;s recent work  (in addition to his  earlier   books ).  Elizabeth Costello , though, is one I&apos;ve wanted to build up to, the one that of all his post- Disgrace  books remains most vivid and challenging in my memory, perhaps because it&apos;s the most unresolveable book of them, the most open in its structure, the most beguiling. 
 Shattered Sonnets Love Cards and Other Off and Back Handed Importunities  by Olena Kalytiak Davis (2003). Nobody, but nobody, writes poems like Olena Kalytiak Davis. (Which means nobody I&apos;ve read writes poems like Olena Kalytiak Davis. Maybe there are hordes out there, but if so, they&apos;re invisible to me.) The twists and turns of her syntax and rhythms are beautiful, funny, bizarre , disconcerting. Sometimes, they seem like mad, manic ravings.  Most of the time, they seem like words chiseled from the core of whatever it is that makes the Earth spin around, leaving no reader unmov&apos;d and reader unshaken . 
 The Pillowman by Martin McDonagh (2003). These days, McDonagh may be best known as the writer-director of In Bruges , but that film, accomplished and entertaining as it is, does not give a full sense of McDonagh&apos;s talents, though it does show how well he mixes the comedic and the horrifying.  The Pillowman  seems to me one of his most mature plays, and one of the most mature plays about violence and society that I know of from the 2000s. 
 Chekhov: A Life in Letters , edited and translated by Rosamund Bartlett (2004). Bartlett&apos;s biography of Chekhov is also well worth reading, as is her selection of his stories, but it is this book that I keep near my desk at all times, a book that has become battered and dog-eared in the years since I bought it. It is a book I could happily recommend to any serious writer or reader, and often have. 
 The Anchor Book of New American Short Stories  edited by Ben Marcus (2004). The single best anthology of contemporary American fiction that I know. It introduced me to many writers I now follow closely, and it is one of the most ecumenical anthologies I&apos;ve ever seen. That ecumenicalism can in some ways make it feel like a grab bag, but I also think it demonstrates forcefully and vividly how the environment of U.S. short fiction came to be what it was over the last ten years. I also love the book because it&apos;s such a great antidote to all the boring collections of American short fiction that constantly reprint the same set of writers and stories and have a debilitatingly narrow view of what fiction is and can be. 
 Lenz  by Georg Büchner, trans. by Richard Sieburth (1835/2005). An essential text in a beautiful edition. 
 Chekhov: The Complete Plays , trans. by Laurence Senelick (2005). Chekhov is one of my personal gods, and having all of his dramatic writings, including variations, well annotated and translated is al most too much for me to contemplate. Thankfully, I don&apos;t have to contemplate it, I just have to take this book down off the shelf. It is, for me, one of the most essential publications of the decade. 
 

 Mister Boots  by Carol Emshwiller (2005). I admire all of Carol Emshwiller&apos;s work, and love in particular her collection  The Start of the End of It All .  Mister Boots  is the one novel of hers that I enjoy as fully as her best short fiction, which means it is a book I revere. 
 Never Let Me Go  by Kazuo Ishiguro (2005). I&apos;ve used this novel in classes a few times, and every time I read it I grow more impressed with all Ishiguro managed to pack into it -- and pack into it so efficiently, so subtly. I stand by all the defenses I made of it in my original review, and now would only make them more forcefully. 
 

 Magic for Beginners  by Kelly Link (2005). If somebody proclaimed Kelly Link the great American short story writer of the first decade of the 21st century, I wouldn&apos;t disagree. (I don&apos;t believe any one writer should be proclaimed such a thing, though.) Her other books are all marvelous, too, but  Magic for Beginners  is the one that contains the two stories that made me realize just how good Kelly&apos;s writing could be: &quot;Lull&quot; and  &quot;Stone Animals&quot; . The consistency of her stories is also impressive -- I&apos;ve never read one that didn&apos;t in some way or another interest or challenge me, even if some of them feel more slight than others. There are very few other writers, even ones I adore, about whom I can say the same. 
 The People of Paper  by Salvador Plascencia (2005). Oh, how I love this book! I wrote plenty about it in my original review, and it remains for me the model of metafiction-that&apos;s-more-than-metafiction. It is one of those novels of which I am in awe. 
 

 The Glamour  by Christopher Priest (1984/1 99 6/2005). This one blew my mind. What more is there to say? 
 Octavian Nothing, vol. 1  by M.T. Anderson (2006). This should be the new generation&apos;s  Johnny Tremain . If I could make every U.S. citizen read it, I would. Heck, every citizen of the world. Have you read it? No? Well, do it now before the coming of the revolution, because once I&apos;m Emperor of the World, you either read it or I have you locked in a deep, dark, dank cellar. And you wouldn&apos;t like that. 
 About Writing  by Samuel R. Delany (2006). I wrote my master&apos;s thesis on Delany, and so it would be unconscionable for me not to include a Delany title on this list, though my thesis focused  most ly  on his work up through  Dhalgren . I&apos;m very fond of  Dark Reflections , too, and intend one of these days to reread it and write more extensively and thoughtfully about it than I have. But  About Writing  seems to me a tremendously important book, a fine introduction to Delany&apos;s critical ideas and a challenging goad to any writer. It&apos;s a book about writing and thinking and living. Reading it at this point for me is like hanging out with an old friend -- the sort of friend who often disagrees with you and is willing to argue that disagreement and share ideas in a fun, serious, friendly, stubborn, and exhilarating way. 
 Skinny Dipping in the Lake of the Dead by Alan DeNiro (2006). This is one of those collections that grows more impressive every time I open it. When I first read it, I was already familiar with many of the stories it contained, having been excited by Alan&apos;s work from early in the decade, but seeing the stories all together in some ways short-circuited and overwhelmed my ability to appreciate their artistry. Time has also proved how unique these stories are -- there are so few people doing anything like this. On a superficial reading, we would note some similarities to folks like Aimee Bender and Kelly Link and even George Saunders, but I think they&apos;re up to something different. What I think they&apos;re up to changes every time I look at the book, but the more time I spend with it, the more different from other books it seems to be. And that makes it very special, indeed. 
 The Empire of Ice Cream  by Jeffrey Ford (2006). Choosing one of Jeff Ford&apos;s collections over another is tough and in some ways wrong -- Ford is nearly as consistent in the quality and power of his fiction as Kelly Link, though they&apos;re very different writers. But  The Empire of Ice Cream  is the book that made me believe this guy&apos;s among the greats, even though I can hear him right now laughing at such an appellation. (&quot;Oh come on, Cheney,&quot; he says, &quot;you know that&apos;s bullshit!&quot;) &quot;The Annals of Eelin-Ok&quot;, &quot;Botch Town&quot;, &quot;The Empire of Ice Cream&quot;, &quot;Boatman&apos;s Holiday&quot; -- each different from the others and each an extraordinary example of what short fiction can achieve. I&apos;ve been meaning for years to write a long essay about all three collections, and need to do so soon before Jeff publishes another and adds to my burden. His work deserves to be known far beyond its current readership. 
 Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology  edited by James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel (2006). Sure, if I were putting together an anthology of &quot;slipstream&quot; stories, it would be different from this one, and I would probably resist the term &quot;slipstream&quot; altogether. Nonetheless, this anthology is full of stories that have been important to me as both a writer and a person, and few other single books sum up so much of what I was most interested in during the decade. 
 
 Daughters of the Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the 20th Century  edited by Justine Larbalestier (2006). There were many wonderful anthologies published in the last decade, but I particularly love this one because its selections are so thoughtful and because it works brilliantly as a book -- it&apos;s not just a good collection of stories or a collection of good stories (some of the stories are primarily of historical interest and can only really be called &quot;good&quot; in that sense), but is, instead, a magnificent collection of stories and arguments. It a book that reaches far beyond its own covers and encourages readers to dig deeper themselves. 
 James Tiptree, Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon  by Julie Phillips (2006). The biography of the decade for me, not just because it tells the story of a writer I admire, but because it is about so much more than just that writer -- it is, in many ways, a book about the 20th century, about all the rifts and riots, and especially about gender and sexuality, writing and expectations. (If  Her Smoke Rose Up Forever  had been published in this decade instead of, originally, 1 99 0, that book would be here, too.) 
 Where Do We Live and Other Plays by Christopher Shinn (2006). Chris Shinn and I spent a couple of years together in college, and I&apos;ve followed his work ever since. This collection includes Four , the play that justifiably brought him to the world&apos;s attention, and Where Do We Live , one of the best 9/11-associated works I&apos;ve read.  Dying City , not included here, was shortlisted for the Pulitzer, and one of these days I fully expect Chris will win that award, but this collection includes the early work, most of which I saw in their first New York productions, and so they are part of what define the decade for me.
 
 Shriek: An Afterword  by Jeff VanderMeer (2006). I haven&apos;t written nearly as much about Jeff VanderMeer&apos;s work as its importance to me perhaps requires -- I&apos;ve expended thousands of words on vastly less fascinating works than his. Part of this is friendship: for various neurotic reasons, I find it hard to read the fiction of people I know well, never mind write about it. I also tend to feel that, for similarly neurotic reasons, I often misread the fiction of people I know well more disastrously than I misread everything else. There&apos;s lots of Jeff&apos;s fiction I would list among the best of the decade for me ( &quot;Secret Life&quot;  and  The Situation  in particular), but if I have to choose one, it&apos;s his novel  Shriek: An Afterword , which is so rich and complex and affecting that I am always at a loss of words about it. Thankfully,  Steve Shaviro has written brilliantly about it , so I can continue to be tongue-tied and just point people to those words instead. Or just the book itself, because that&apos;s all you really need. 
 One for Sorrow  by Christopher Barzak (2007). The most personal of my personal selections here. I read this book in manuscript, and I vividly remember exactly where I sat when reading the first pages. It was a complex and in some ways difficult time of life, a time of immense tectonic shifts in my situation and being, and this novel is tied to all the good and exhilarating parts of that time, which is amusing to me in retrospect, given how melancholy the novel is on the whole. I&apos;m wary of ever visiting Youngstown, Ohio, because the image of it in my mind from reading  One for Sorrow  is so strong that the reality would prove, I fear, too thin. 
 The Savage Detectives  by Roberto Bolaño (1 99 8/2007). I was tempted to include  Last Evenings on Earth  on this list, because it&apos;s one of my all-time favorite short story collections and thus easily one of my favorites of the decade, but I decided on  Savage Detectives  instead because it&apos;s the desert island book: forced to choose one  Bolaño  to take with me to a desert island, this would be it, a vast and fascinating book that shifts and changes and evades grasp on every reading. I haven&apos;t read  2666  yet, saving it for later savoring, so perhaps that will invade my desert island and blow its sibling to Kingdoms Came&amp;Saw&amp;Conquered, but that will be in the current decade, not the past one. (By the way, if I&apos;m ever stranded on a desert island, I don&apos;t want a novel. I want a  survival manual .) 
 
 Oh Pure and Radiant Heart  by Lydia Millet (2007). This was my first encounter with Lydia Millet&apos;s fiction, and so it stands tall in my memory. It&apos;s a messier book than some of her others, but I love it for that. Very few books with an explicit social-political purpose at their core appeal to me, but this one gets the balance right, and without the social-political core it would be a shallower creation, clever and amusing and not much more. It is much, much more. 
 
 


 Spaceman Blues  by Brian Francis Slattery (2007). Yes, Slattery&apos;s second novel,  Liberation  is more accomplished, but  Spaceman Blues  was the one that blew me away -- I knew nothing about the writer and nothing about the book, and so it caught me unprepared for its marvels. By  Liberation , I had me some expectations (which it lived up to and sometimes exceeded). I may never reread  Spaceman Blues  because I don&apos;t want to go back to it with expectations that can&apos;t be met; it&apos;s one of those books where I am fond of the memory and don&apos;t want to sully it with new memories. That first time was a perfect reading experience. 
 Grasses of a Thousand Colors by Wallace Shawn (2008). I prefer some of Shawn&apos;s earlier plays, but this is the only one of the decade, and therefore must be on this list, because he is one of the great playwrights of our time.  Grasses  is a profoundly strange play, an erotic apocalypse, a dissertation on humanity and nature and food and sex. There&apos;s nothing out there like it except some of his other plays. 
 
 Orpheus in the Bronx by Reginald Shepherd (2008). I reviewed this fine collection of essays for Rain Taxi , and will post that review here soon. But for now, I&apos;ll give you the first paragraph:
 It&apos;s not difficult to trace the source of all the magic in Reginald Shepherd&apos;s first collection of essays—the author&apos;s sensitivity to the fruitful borderlands between aesthetics and politics—but pinning down each wondrous effect emanating from that source might take a while. This is a book rich with ideas and implications, a book that provokes and dazzles and sings. 


 The New Weird  edited by Ann&amp;Jeff VanderMeer (2008). Yes, Mr. V is already on this list with his novel Shriek, but I could not possibly let a representation of my experience of the decade escape without including one of the anthologies he and Ann put together during that time. 2002&apos;s  Leviathan 3  is also an extraordinary and worthwhile anthology, but The New Weird sums up and analyzes some of the forces that allowed the decade to be as interesting as it was, and so when I think of the decade, The New Weird comes to mind even more than Leviathan 3. 
 
 The Letters of Samuel Beckett, 1929-1940  (2009). You probably have to be a Beckett fanatic to appreciate this book, but I&apos;m a Beckett fanatic (I was tempted to include the  Grove set  of his works on this list, in fact, but it felt like cheating). In the decade that saw the demise of the personal letter, replaced for most people by email and Facebook and all that jazz, it&apos;s particularly rewarding to read such witty, knowledgeable, bizarre , informative, and beautiful letters as these. The scholarly apparatus is sometimes overwhelming, but also deeply welcome. And it&apos;s a book that&apos;s been reviewed by  J.M. Coetzee  and Gabriel Josipovici , so how could I not love it? 
 
 
 The City and The City by China Miéville (2009). Perhaps because of how it defied my expectations of what a &quot;China Miéville novel&quot; should be, this one was a gobsmacker. It filled, too, some hole in my desires for novels -- in some way or another, it was a book I&apos;d been waiting for. Much of this can be explained by China&apos;s own explanation of his feelings about crime novels, which I read with that wonderful emotion no single word defines, but which comes whenever you read something you&apos;ve thought, inchoately but naggingly, and then encountered in someone else&apos;s efficient and better-developed expression. Which is not to say I think of The City and The City as a &quot;crime novel&quot;, whatever that is, but rather as a novel that is about, among other things, some tendencies that might be found in books some people are perhaps inclined to think of as &quot;crime novels&quot;. I didn&apos;t mind what other folks saw as flaws in the book because those qualities were extraneous to my experience of it: to me, it was as much essay as fiction, as much meditation as text, and it was an essay I could embrace and a meditation I was happy to get lost in for a while, a walk through territory unfamiliar but nonetheless agreeable (though not comforting, no, not that at all). I look on The City and The City now with the fondness I&apos;d have for a family member or a limb. A distant cousin or an extra limb, perhaps, but nonetheless: with fondness.

 My Vocabulary Did This to Me: The Collected Poetry of Jack Spicer (2009). I discussed this book in my Strange Horizons column about Philip K. Dick and Jack Spicer, and I&apos;ve said a few time that it&apos;s one of the best collections of contemporary poetry I know. It seems a fitting last book for this list, too -- a collection of things from the 20th century that were so ahead of their time most of us weren&apos;t really ready to receive them until we&apos;d gotten into the 21st. Though I haven&apos;t been reading much poetry in the last few years, and my poetry reading during the 2000s has been too slim, I keep returning to this book again and again.

About to head to a vicious area of Baghdad, they decided the difference would be them. Fifteen months later, the soldiers returned home forever changed.

All that changed with the death of their mother... Told in the alternating voices of the four siblings, their poignant, harrowing story of un­breakable bonds unfolds with ferocious emotion. Despite the Welch children’s wrenching loss and subsequent separation, they retained the resilience and humor that both their mother and father endowed them with - growing up as lost souls, taking disastrous turns along the way, but eventually coming out right side up...&quot; - www.randomhouse.com.

There they inhabit an elaborate cave shelter, bathe in a nearby creek, store perishables at the water’s edge, use a makeshift septic system, tend a garden, even keep a library of sorts. Once a week, they go to the city to buy groceries and otherwise merge with the civilized world. But one small mistake allows a backcountry jogger to discover them, which derails their entire existence, ultimately provoking a deeper flight.
Inspired by a true story and told through the startlingly sincere voice of a young narrator, Caroline, Peter Rock&apos;s My Abandonment is a riveting journey into life at the margins...&quot; - Amazon.

In this profound and moving memoir, Small, an award-winning children&apos;s book illustrator, uses his drawings to depict the consciousness of a young boy. The story starts when the narrator is six years old and follows him into adulthood, with most of the story spent during his early adolescence. The youngest member of a silent and unhappy family, David is subjected to repeated x-rays to monitor sinus problems. When he develops cancer as a result of this procedure, he is operated on without being told what is wrong with him. The operation results in the loss of his voice, cutting him off even further from the world around him. Small&apos;s black and white pen and ink drawings are endlessly perceptive as they portray the layering of dream and imagination onto the real-life experiences of the young boy.... Small tells his story with haunting subtlety and power.&quot; - Publishers Weekly.

Emma Laurence rounds up the least romantic deals on offer this Valentine&apos;s Day. Can you top a three-course dinner at Ikea for £6.95 or nipple tassels from Poundland?

Going out

A Valentine&apos;s dinner date is rarely what it&apos;s cracked up to be . More often than not, you&apos;ll end up in a restaurant you&apos;d never have chosen yourself (because your favourites were all booked up months ago), eating food you don&apos;t really like (only the best set menu for you), and bashing elbows with the couples seated either side of you (well, you said you wanted intimate).

Still, if your heart&apos;s set on a slap-up meal, where better than your local Ikea , the land of Swedish meatballs and marital squabbles? You can tuck in to a three-course set menu for just £6.95 and pick up a bunch of freshly cut flowers on your way out - a snip at £1. 99 . Or choose from two for one whoppers at Burger King, a two-course Toby carvery for £5, or a free &apos;sundae best&apos; ice cream with any main meal at Harvester, all courtesy of Toptable .

Fancy a pint down the local instead? JD Wetherspoon is luring couples in with its £14. 99 &apos;two steaks and a bottle of wine&apos; deal , while the Trafford Arms in Norwich is hosting its 17th annual Valentine&apos;s beer festival . No? We thought not.

The dining with a difference award goes to the terraces at Fulham FC, where you can settle in with a jumbo hot dog and enjoy a live FA Cup match at the same time. Fulham v Notts County kicks off at 3pm, tickets £15 .

Staying in

Perhaps cosying up on the sofa is more your cup of tea. The £8 Morrisons banquet promises you a starter, main, side and dessert of your choice, not forgetting the obligatory bottle of plonk. For an extra £2 you can upgrade to the Sainsbury&apos;s version , which includes all of the above plus a six-pack of that well-known aphrodisiac, J20. M&amp;S; puts the price of love at £20 , which will buy you the usual three courses plus a bottle of fizz and a red rose (just the one, mind you).

If a meal deal feels a little contrived, you could always treat your loved one to a takeaway, just like Ant McPartlin , who took his wife literally when she quipped she&apos;d be happy with fish and chips. If you&apos;re anywhere near Wadebridge, you can take home an Indian meal from the Raj restaurant - voted the most romantic takeaway in Cornwall.

On the box

You may be disappointed to learn that Hugh Grant does not make a single appearance in the TV listings this Valentine&apos;s Day.

In absence of the standard seasonal fare, Setanta, Sky Sports and ESPN have masterminded a whopping eight-match football marathon , kicking off with Rangers and Hibs at 1.30pm. It should wrap up just in time for you to catch The St Valentine&apos;s Day Massacre on Sky Movies Classics at 10pm - the ultimate Valentine&apos;s Day movie.

Over on Film 24 you can enjoy a whole 24 hours of Valentine-themed movies , including such classic titles as My First Wedding, I Love You Too and A Touch of Love. They obviously forgot to include Pass the Sick Bag.

Outside the box

If you prefer to get your action outdoors, the Frock Stock and Barrel Shooting School in Essex is hosting a romantic Valentine&apos;s clay pigeon shoot for beginners , £ 99 per couple.

If that doesn&apos;t get your pulse racing, there&apos;s always the Lovers Leap tandem bungee jump . For £97, you and your partner can take the ultimate leap of faith in London, Manchester, Brighton or Sheffield and enjoy a complimentary half bottle of champagne once you&apos;re back on solid ground. Yes, that&apos;s half a bottle of champagne in return for throwing yourselves off a bridge with nothing between you and certain death but a giant rubber band.

Scarier still, there&apos;s the anti-Valentine&apos;s vampire party at Penderels bar in London, £5, where you&apos;re invited to come dressed for &quot;your own fangtastic funeral&quot;. Not for the faint-hearted.

Cheap and meaningful

We know it&apos;s not supposed to be about the money - Ben Affleck&apos;s gift to J-Lo of a $105,000 diamond-encrusted toilet seat was recently voted the least romantic gesture of all time. But have you ever heard the phrase &apos;Say it with doughnuts&apos;? Us neither. Nonetheless, Krispy Kreme has created a delightful heart-shaped doughnut that you can enjoy with your beloved for just £1.35.

If you&apos;re in the capital this weekend, you can capture your love with an HMV-branded photograph at the Love Shack on Oxford Street . You can even choose a special music-themed message to accompany your mugshot - hits include You&apos;re The One That I Want, Love Will Tear Us Apart or Marry Me.

Forget hiring a pod on the London Eye and allow yourself to be whisked to the National Theatre for a free open-air screening of The Apartment at 6pm. Not only will your date not have to open their wallet, they&apos;ll also get to watch your teeth chatter and your lips turn blue you as you sit outside in the freezing cold ... Mmm, romantic.

No doubt you&apos;ll be in need of warming up afterwards, but don&apos;t go getting any ideas. Coffee Republic is offering a free Bacio chocolate each with the purchase of any two hot drinks - the foil-wrapped alternative to a kiss.

It&apos;s the thought that counts

In need of further inspiration? Sainsbury&apos;s has come up with the perfect pairing this Valentine&apos;s weekend - a bottle of Gallo rosé plus a Terry&apos;s Chocolate Orange for the special price of £5. Or, if you want the bubbles but can&apos;t stretch to the real thing, Asda is on to a winner with its Champers Bubbly Bath , £1 - &quot;a celebration in every bath&quot;.

A book is a thoughtful alternative to the usual hearts and flowers, but Shag Yourself Slim - otherwise known as Two Massive Insults For The Price Of One - probably isn&apos;t going to top the list of things you&apos;d like from your partner on Valentine&apos;s Day. Amazon has sold out, but if you really want to, you can get your hands on a copy here . Meanwhile, the British Lung Foundation has produced an equally timely leaflet on sex and breathlessness , designed to help those living with a lung condition to &quot;blow kisses all night&quot;.

There are plenty more ideas online. Iwantoneofthose.com is perfect for the gift that says exactly the opposite of what you want to hear. Anyone for a gold-plated Rolo ? It comes in pink, gold and silver and starts from £39. 99 - a pricey alternative to chocolate, but at least it gets you out of having to actually hand over your last one. Equally brilliant is the diamond keyring : proposal-free and only £9. 99 . No, darling, you really shouldn&apos;t have.

 Valentinesgifts.co.uk comes a close second with its impressive range of seasonal suggestions. Our favourite is the luxury double Slanket , £45, which will keep you and your partner snug on the sofa and comes in a suitably romantic shade of ruby red. Elsewhere on the site, Jack (think beanstalk) the Bad Taste Bear , £10. 99 , must be seen to be believed.

&apos;Sexy&apos; lingerie is always a safe bet to show the love of your life what you really think of her and, bizarre ly, Amazon is a good place to start . Their Peekaboo lace bodystocking and Jade strappy PVC number are certain to make an impression. Left it to the last minute? We&apos;ve heard Poundland are stocking heart-shaped nipple tassels for, you guessed it, £1, but hurry - they&apos;re sure to be a sell-out.

 What was your worst Valentine&apos;s gift, date or experience? Let us know in the comments section below.

We should have seen boxing&apos;s biggest upset in Tokyo 20 years ago coming

The unpredictability of sport: it&apos;s what drags us back every time, encouraging us to believe we will see drama, excitement, an injection of a thrill that might not be so obvious in our own lives, day to day.

Twenty years ago this week in Tokyo, James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas gave the world all the drama and excitement it could handle when he knocked out Mike Tyson in the 10th round of a fight that has come to be regarded as the biggest upset in the history of boxing. But how much of a shock was it really?

It shocked nearly everyone at the time: the fight writers, the lone Las Vegas bookmaker who&apos;d made Douglas a 42-1 shot, the promoter Don King... and it seemed, plainly, to shock the hitherto invincible Tyson.

Douglas said he always expected to win; that&apos;s true only if you believe in hope as an expression of unshakeable conviction – which is a dubious premise. Douglas hoped with all his heart he could win. I doubt how much he believed it. While the bookies might have been underestimating the chances of the skilled if diffident heavyweight, Buster was still a locked-down underdog.

Buster was busted, his wife had just left him, the people around him didn&apos;t think he had a prayer. Then, three weeks before the fight, his mother died from a heart attack. These were real tragedies – rather than the prospect of a sporting one in the ring – that inspired Douglas, a sensitive man unsuited to his profession, to give the very best he could on the biggest night of his life. It was sport, again, providing a stage for heroism, which is why many fighters fight.

But Tyson was 37-0 with 33 stoppages. How did he lose to this likeable, 29-year-old sacrificial lamb of a man?

What was not so apparent then but became clear in the tumult that followed was the fact that Mike was also suffering away from the ring. He was critically underdone, physically and mentally.

In the hours before the fight, on 11 February 1 99 0, Tyson sat in his hotel room, watching martial arts on TV, listening to his flunkies, as he had done all his life. He was also wrestling with a perpetual fondness for indiscriminate sex, whiskey and other stimulants.

His life had for some time been a rolling catastrophe. His wife had publicly humiliated him on national television then left him. Cus D&apos;Amato, his muse, had died. Don King was his master. The psychological traumas of his childhood that had lain dormant for years now gathered again to drain his resolve. Only two fights previously, Frank Bruno had rocked his head in the first round, only to fold in five. &quot;Iron Mike&quot;, as he was marketed, was there for the taking, sooner or later.

Tyson was told to believe he was the &quot;baddest man on the planet&quot;. He was not. He was, as Mickey Duff once memorably remarked, the biggest and best bully on the planet. And his self-loathing unravelled to expose the great lie as Douglas recovered from a withering uppercut and knockdown in the eighth to batter the champion into one of boxing&apos;s most ignominious falls, in rounds nine and 10.

Tyson has left us with many images: from terrifying to vulnerable. But none matches for pathos the picture of his groping for his mouthguard on the canvas in the final seconds of his first reign, his eyes glazed, his powerful body electrocuted into baby-like clumsiness.

In truth, then, this was not so much a classic upset as an accidental collision of two lives, two fighters with their own burdens, handling them in entirely different ways. It was an aberration.

Douglas would surrender the title meekly to Evander Holyfield eight months later and be remembered as a curiosity rather than a great champion – much as James J Braddock, the original &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; would be remembered after beating Max Baer to win the title in 1936, then losing it to Joe Louis in his first defence two years later. Braddock went on to make good money in the construction business.

Twenty years on from Tokyo, Tyson recycles his legend on the celebrity dinner circuit (largely in the UK), Holyfield, accused this week of assaulting his third wife, reaches still for one last crack at glory in the ring, and Douglas, just like Braddock, settles down to make some money in property, in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. He might just have turned out the most contented of them all.

Say It Ain&apos;t So, Amir, Roy, Bernard, Ricky, Johnny

Amir Khan wants to defend his WBA light-welterweight title against Paulie Malignaggi at Madison Square Garden on 15 May. You can bet Malignaggi wants it too, because, although he&apos;s got more ambition than is healthy for a fighter with no punch, he&apos;s game, slick and he knows how to sell a fight, especially in his home town.

But this is a sham. Khan will knock Malignaggi out inside five rounds. Maybe earlier. You can get 9-1 from Skybet about that happening, so rush to your bank now. I&apos;ve got to say I&apos;ve never rated Paulie, a nice guy who reminds me of my teenage self shadowboxing in front of the mirror when I thought I was Ali but, weirdly, wasn&apos;t. That&apos;s the Magic Man. An illusion.

The word put out – and accepted without question nearly everywhere – was that Juan Manuel Márquez&apos;s trainer, Nachos Berenstein, reckoned his 36-year-old fighter wasn&apos;t ready for Khan because of the tough 12 rounds he endured against Floyd Mayweather Jr – nearly five months ago. Right.

Márquez doesn&apos;t want to fight Khan because he knows he risks a beating from the younger, faster, stronger champion. He wants to fight the older, slower, bigger, shot Ricky Hatton. And that is what&apos;s going to happen.

Then Khan is going to fight Hatton in Manchester in September and everybody will make lots of money.

This is boxing at its most cynical. Those critics of Khan&apos;s who say he&apos;s a paper champion now have ammunition. He should be fighting the dangerous mandatory challenger, Marcos Maidana – or Márquez, at least.

In fact, instead of Hatton, the domestic challenger I&apos;d love to see Khan fight is Kevin Mitchell, whose maturing talent is on show at Wembley tomorrow night, when he defends his WBO inter-continental lightweight title against Ignacio Mendoza, who ought not be as dangerous as his Colombian compatriot Breidis Prescott, whom Mitchell mastered so brilliantly over 12 rounds to win the title in November.

Breidis kayoed Khan in 52 seconds, Mitchell did a total number on Prescott, Mitchell (although a division lighter) should fight Khan.

But the business doesn&apos;t work like that. Maidana is happy to take step-aside money from Khan, and bide his time. In the context of this crazy sport, who could blame him? Khan-Malignaggi makes about as much sense as Roy Jones Jr and Bernard Hopkins going it at again, finally, when they should be putting their feet up.

The most bizarre rumour I&apos;ve heard in a while was in Australia recently, when connections of their Contenders winner, a tough former rugby league player called Garth Wood, were putting it about that Hatton has offered them a fight this year in Macau. Surely not. Although Wood fights at super-middleweight (probably Ricky&apos;s current poundage), he&apos;s had only eight fights, winning seven, mainly against guys who can&apos;t box, and been knocked out once. He is, as they say in Australia, dreamin&apos;.

Ricky was out there on holiday over Christmas, stopping off to see Andy Murray at the Australian Open. Perhaps the sun, or the Fosters, got to him.

Finally, Johnny Tapia says he is making a comeback at 42. Pray for him.

 Polanski In Switzerland, His Film In Berlin 
 [ Filmmaking ] ( Fest21.com blogs )
 In what has to be one of the most bizarre red carpet scenarios in many a moon, the Berlinale is bracing for the buzz storm surrounding the world premiere of THE GHOST WRITER, the latest film from director Roman Polanski. And while the stars of the film, Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan will officiously walk the red carpet at the Berlinale Palast this evening, the film&apos;s celebrated director remains under house arrest in his ski villa in Switzerland.

In what has to be one of the most bizarre red carpet scenarios in many a moon, the Berlinale is bracing for the buzz storm surrounding the world premiere of THE GHOST WRITER , the latest film from director Roman Polanski. And while the stars of the film,  Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan will officiously walk the red carpet at the Berlinale Palast  this evening, the film&apos;s celebrated director remains under house arrest in his ski villa in Switzerland.

Of course, this is not the first time that a film&apos;s director could not come to Berlin to celebrate the premiere of his/her film. However, it may be the first time that a director was barred from leaving his house under threat of arrest if he was to decide to make a quick getaway to the Festival festivities. One can only imagine the mix of emotions that is coursing through the veins of Monsieur Polanski , as he awaits word on whether he will be forcibly extradited to the United States to be charged with evading incarceration for his admitted statutory rape of a 15-year-old in Los Angeles over 30 years ago.

 While Polanski became synonymous with the &quot;dark side&quot; of Hollywood, both for the rape conviction and the brutal murder of his wife Sharon Tate in 1969 by the cultish Manson Family, the director&apos;s reputation has undergone a marked improvement in recent years, following his triumphant win of a Best Director Oscar for the 2002 Holocaust drama THE PIANIST . The film reminded the public of Polanski&apos;s own traumatic childhood as a Holocaust survivor whose mother died in Auschwitz.

There is a real danger that THE GHOST WRITER  will be overshadowed by its own offstage drama in Berlin, where Polanski will, of course, be conspicuous by his absence. Dieter Kosslick , the Berlinale director, lobbied publicly for Polanski&apos;s release, joining a celebrity roster that includes Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Whoopi Goldberg, Tilda Swinton, Chris Rock, Pedro Almodóvar and Monica Bellucci . Even the victim in the case, Samantha Geimer , publicly forgave the veteran director after he came to a private financial settlement with her in 1 99 3. However, after decades of apparent disinterest while Polanski never strayed far from his Paris home, it seems the California justice system has finally decided to go after Polanski with a vengeance.


 THE GHOST WRITER is adapted by the best-selling author Robert Harris from his own 2007 novel. Harris is a former political journalist and who fell out bitterly with the British government, mainly over his support for US and Israeli military action. In the film, Ewan McGrgor stars as a hack biographer hired by a suave but secretive British prime minister ( Pierce Brosnan channeling Tony Blair ) who is struggling to finish his memoirs in US exile while facing possible extradition back to Europe on war crimes charges. This timely theme was given an unexpected publicity boost last week when the real Blair made his defiant appearance at the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war in London.

 THE GHOST WRITER , which is already receiving superb reviews from the trade publications who have apparently seen an advanced copy of the film, might have a similarly positive effect on Polanski&apos;s public image. However, if fate goes against him, this could conceivably prove to be Polanski’s final film.

 DSM-5: The Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis 
Publication of the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in May 2013 will mark one the most anticipated events in the mental health field. As part of the development process, the preliminary draft revisions to the current diagnostic criteria for psychiatric diagnoses are now available for public review and comment. We thank you for your interest in DSM-5 and hope that you use this opportunity not only to learn more about the proposed changes in DSM-5, but also about its history, its impact, and its developers. Please continue to check this site for updates to criteria and for more information about the development process.
 Areas of particular interest are:

 Gender Identity Disorders 
 302.6 Gender Identity Disorder in Children 
 302.85 Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents or Adults 
 302.6 Gender Identity Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 

 Paraphillias 
 302.3 Transvestic Fetishism 

More after the jump...

Taking it from the top...
 302.6 Gender Identity Disorder in Children 

 The Good: 

 A. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months duration, as manifested by at least 6* of the following indicators (including A1): [2, 3, 4]

1. a strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that he or she is the other gender [5] At last! The requirement that a child be deemed TS only if they think they&apos;re of a different sex from the one they have been assigned! Mere cross-gendered behaviour is not enough. I&apos;m not sure of the duration being reduced to only 6 months though. The rationale is this: However, there is no clear empirical literature supporting this particular period (e.g., 3 months vs. 6 months or 6 months vs. 12 months). There was, however, consensus among the group that a lower-bound duration of 6 months would be unlikely to yield false positives. I would have put the bar higher - out of sheer conservatism. In this case, I must grudgingly bow to the consensus. I&apos;d like some empirical evidence though, especially from the Dutch group that have a 100.00 batting average on diagnosis.

 The Bad: 
 Subtypes
With a disorder of sex development
Without a disorder of sex development Being Intersexed is no longer a &quot;defence&quot; against the charge of being &quot;mentally ill&quot;. Exactly what various IS groups have been afraid of with the classification of Transsexuality as being effectively an Intersex condition.

So now children who were surgically mutilated surgically assigned a sex of convenience are now not merely &quot;disordered&quot; (rather than &quot;different&quot;) due to their biology, but suffer a &quot;psychiatric illness&quot; should they dare to object to an incorrect assignation.

It&apos;s as .. perverse... as reacting to a situation where, because broken arms are mis-classified as a &quot;mental illness&quot;, and research shows that broken legs have a similar etiology (ie a physical fracture of the skeleton), that broken legs should now be classed as a mental rather than a physical condition too.

Whisky Tango Foxtrot Interrogative.

 The Ugly: 

The references - nothing, absolutely nothing, by Swaab, or Gooren, or Diamond, or... anyone at all writing anything on neuro-anatomy.

Harry Benjamin, back in 1966, wrote: Many psychologists, particularly analysts, have little biological background and training. Some seem actually contemptuous of biological facts and persistently overstate psychological data, so much so that a distorted, one-sided picture of the problem under consideration results.
Psychiatrists with biological orientation strongly disagree and even decry the exclusive psychoanalytic interpretations. But their voice is heard too rarely.&quot; Never has this been more obviously illustrated than here. Anything which might contradict Money&apos;s debunked theories of psychosexual neutrality at birth has been... ignored. Just plain not referenced, either to confirm of refute.

Moreover, in the references, amidst a number of journals with one, sometimes two citations, there&apos;s reference after reference to the &quot; Archives of Sexual Behaviour &quot;, of which many on the panel are editors, and where the editors contribute much of the content. Calling it a &quot;Vanity Press&quot; publication would be most unjust and very inaccurate. It is however... monocultural. Incestuous. That can happen in any specialised area and is often inevitable. But it&apos;s not inevitable here, it appears to be the consequence of many of the people on the DSM-V revision panel (in this area) being part of this clique. Calling it a clique is harsh, but I&apos;m afraid to say no other word fits. And the chair of the section revision committee, Ken Zucker, is an editor of this publication.

Moving right along...

 302.85 Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents or Adults 

 The Good 

Not so much what has been included, as what hasn&apos;t been. Nothing about paraphilias, nothing about mis-directed sexual drives. The renaming to &quot;Gender Incongruence&quot; is also good. The &quot;Exit Clause&quot; better. The change also makes it possible for individuals who have successfully transitioned to “lose” the diagnosis after satisfactory treatment. This resolves the problem that, in the DSM-IV-TR, there was a lack of an “exit clause,” meaning that individuals once diagnosed with GID will always be considered to have the diagnosis, regardless of whether they have transitioned and are psychosocially adjusted in the identified gender role (Winters, 2008). The diagnosis will also be applicable to transitioned individuals who have regrets, because they did not feel like the other gender after all. For instance, a natal male living in the female role and having regrets experiences an incongruence between the “newly assigned” female gender and the experienced/expressed (still or again male) gender. This recognises that Gender Incongruence is something experienced by some no matter what situation they&apos;re in. The Gender Binary fits most people well, as does the Sex Binary. But it fits some not at all. Just as some are Bi-Gendered, able to function with adequate (if not good) facility in either Gender role, some unfortunates can&apos;t fit in either.

I don&apos;t like to think about them. I should, but I find their situation too distressing. I also wonder if this can be called a psychiatric condition, or one induced by a sick and overly-rigid society, composed of people like me. People who fit in, and don&apos;t understand people who don&apos;t.

 The Bad 

The criteria have been considerably relaxed. Now no distinction is made between the Transsexual - those for whom physical change of the body, the sex, is a matter of life-and-death (literally), and those who are merely gender variant. Sex and gender are completely conflated, biology and social construct inextricably mixed.

Now while some of what we normally think of as &quot;cross-gendered&quot; behaviour is actually cross-sexed, a matter if neurology.... most isn&apos;t. It&apos;s a matter of convention, a social construction if you will. I&apos;ve had to &quot;fight the good fight&quot; to point out that it&apos;s not 100% social construction, that male and female brains differ in significant ways. But there&apos;s a practical issue here: merely Transgendered people do not require bodily correction. Transsexuals do.

Now while it may be that more Transgendered behaviour than we think has a physiological causation - I think it probably does - I&apos;d be flabbergasted if it all did. Worse though, the conflation of the two might encourage Transgendered people into seeking body modification when it&apos;s highly undesirable, inducing a medical condition where none existed. Even worse, causing Transsexual people to be denied life-saving treatment as &quot;Gender is just a social construct&quot;. That&apos;s a very popular notion with many &quot;Gender Studies&quot; Departments, but is contradicted by the facts - unless you believe in psycho-sexual neutrality at birth, and ignore neuro-anatomy. Which is what they&apos;ve done.

 The Ugly 

Many of the Ugly bits are the same as for the previous diagnosis. But there&apos;s this, which I think shows some insight. These are smart people. Although the DSM-IV diagnosis of GID encompasses more than transsexualism, it is still often used as an equivalent to transsexualism (Sohn&amp;Bosinski, 2007). For instance, a man can meet the two core criteria if he only believes he has the typical feelings of a woman and does not feel at ease with the male gender role. The same holds for a woman who just frequently passes as a man (e.g., in terms of first name, clothing, and/or haircut) and does not feel comfortable living as a conventional woman. Someone having a GID diagnosis based on these subcriteria clearly differs from a person who identifies completely with the other gender, can only relax when permanently living in the other gender role, has a strong aversion against the sex characteristics of his/her body, and wants to adjust his/her body as much as technically possible in the direction of the desired sex. Those who are distressed by having problems with just one of the two criteria (e.g., feeling uncomfortable living as a conventional man or woman) will have a GIDNOS diagnosis. This is highly confusing for clinicians. It perpetuates the search for the “true transsexual” only, in order to identify the right candidates for hormone and surgical treatment instead of facilitating clinicians to assess the type and severity of any type of GI and offer appropriate treatment. Furthermore, in the DSM-IV, gender identity and gender role were described as a dichotomy (either male or female) rather than a multi-category concept or spectrum (Bockting, 2008; Bornstein, 1 99 4; Ekins&amp;King, 2006; Lev, 2007; R?n, 2002). The current formulation makes more explicit that a conceptualization of GI acknowledging the wide variation of conditions will make it less likely that only one type of treatment is connected to the diagnosis. So far so good. I think that identifying the &quot;true transsexual&quot; is no bad thing though, as long as you have good criteria, and you define &quot;true transsexual&quot; as someone requiring hormonal and surgical intervention. I hate the phrase, as it inevitably leads to all sorts of elitist cliquishness, who are the &quot;cool kids&quot;, the &quot;real McCoys&quot; vs the &quot;wannabes&quot;.

At the moment we have an unholy conflation of sex and gender, illustrated by the confusion in the diagnostic criteria:
 1. a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or, in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics) [13, 16]

2. a strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or, in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics) [17]

3. a strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender It&apos;s got nothing to do with gender. Now it may be, as in my own case, that after transition I found that I was far, far more feminine in many ways than I&apos;d thought. But I&apos;m still a Geek Girl, a Tomboy, and while I fit in exactly with these gals , they&apos;re not exactly gender-typical in some ways.

It&apos;s about sex. Not sexual orientation. Not about who you want to go to bed with , but who you want to go to bed as .

You know, on various blogs I&apos;ve been accused (at the best) of &quot;sitting on the fence&quot;. Of being a &quot;TG Activist&quot;, of engaging in Gender Politics to the detriment of the &quot;cool kids&quot;. I haven&apos;t blogged about that as I don&apos;t consider it important. I&apos;m not actually interested in the least in &quot;gender politics&quot; and certainly not activism purveying some obscure technical doctrine. Human Rights, now those I&apos;m interested in. But that&apos;s separate from the Science of Sex and Gender, my main interest. Just the facts ma&apos;am. So it&apos;s ironic that here I am, criticising a group for doing what I&apos;ve been (inaccurately) accused of myself. But I digress.

I&apos;d re-write that as follows: 1. a marked incongruence between one’s neurological sex (as measured by tests of smell, hearing, MRI patterns) and somatic primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or, in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics) [13, 16]

2. a strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s somatic sex (or, in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics) [17]

3. a strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other sex Neither Gender nor sexual orientation come into it - but one or the other will often be involved as well, depending on how much of the brain is cross-sexed, and which parts.

If we don&apos;t simplify and clarify like that, we have this kind of thing Taking the above regarding the avoidance of male-female dichotomies into account, in the new formulation, the focus is on the discrepancy between experienced/expressed gender (which can be either male, female, in-between or otherwise) and assigned gender (in most societies male or female) rather than cross-gender identification and same-gender aversion (Cohen-Kettenis&amp;Pf?fflin, 2009). Assigned gender???? Bafflegab.

Some &quot;gendered behaviour&quot;, that which is a constant across all societies through time and space, is sexed behaviour, and while there&apos;s overlap, and few if anyone wholly stereotypical, it&apos;s as physically defined as height or genital shape. Both of which have overlap, and many who don&apos;t fit in either male or female stereotype, not completely. But most of &quot;gendered behaviour&quot; has at best a tenuous connection with biology, and often none whatsoever.

Let&apos;s look at the rest of the diagnostic criteria: 4. a strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

5. a strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)

6. a strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender) I&apos;d not qualify for anything other than 1) and 6) when pre-op. I didn&apos;t want to be a woman - I just was one. Now that the body&apos;s been fixed.... I rather like it, and rather like a lot of the stereotypical gender stuff too. Not all though: some doesn&apos;t fit. I&apos;m arrogant enough to say that it doesn&apos;t have to.

 302.6 Gender Identity Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 

Not Finished yet. But now that Intersexed people are included in the other diagnoses, it will have to be changed. The DSM-IV-TR version has:
 This category is included for coding disorders in gender identity that are not classifiable as a specific Gender Identity Disorder. Examples include

1. Intersex conditions (e.g., partial androgen insensitivity syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and accompanying gender dysphoria

2. Transient, stress-related cross-dressing behavior

3. Persistent preoccupation with castration or penectomy without a desire to acquire the sex characteristics of the other sex Basically, nothing to do with any of the rest, a grab-bag of bizarre behaviour associated with other conditions.

 302.3 Transvestic Fetishism 

Here&apos;s the total list of all of the references used in this section.

See previous remarks about monoculture and intellectual incest. Did I mention that Dr (PhD not MD or of Psychiatry) Blanchard is on the working-group in charge of writing this section of the DSM? IIRC he actually heads it...

I know it&apos;s a &quot;work in progress&quot;, but still... This approach leaves intact the distinction between normative and non-normative sexual behavior, which could be important to researchers, but without automatically labeling non-normative sexual behavior as psychopathological. It also eliminates certain logical absurdities in the DSM-IV-TR. In that version, for example, a man cannot be classified as a transvestite—however much he cross-dresses and however sexually exciting that is to him—unless he is unhappy about this activity or impaired by it. Now while I&apos;ll never understand male sexuality.... I thought that we were trying to make a diagnostic manual for mental illnesses here. So while I can understand having a definition of non-normative behaviours that may be signs of a mental illness - such as an aversion to eating rotted chicken embryos in the shell in the Phillipines, or a desire on the part of a woman to vote in Saudi - I don&apos;t think any of them qualify as a mental illness, any more than &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; with &quot;democratic idealism&quot; qualified in the late and unlamented Soviet Union. Whether they cause distress or not.

OK, I think transvestites are weird. But some would say that I&apos;m weird too. Not so much for being Intersexed (many don&apos;t know that, I don&apos;t tell everyone), but for being a Rocket Scientist and sometime Naval Combat System Architect who&apos;s doing a PhD in Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computation. THAT some men find weird in a chick - weird and threatening.

Michael Naughton, director of the Innocence Network UK, replies to claims the Criminal Cases Review Commission is a &apos;champion of justice&apos;

David Jessel, a Commissioner and senior spokesperson at the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) recently argued that it is &quot;a dangerous lie&quot; that &quot;the CCRC couldn&apos;t care less about innocence&quot;; that innocence projects students investigating alleged wrongful convictions &quot;are being encouraged to see the CCRC as the enemy of justice rather than its champion&quot;; and that &quot;to consider the safety of a conviction provides a sterner test for the system and a more useful one for the innocent individual than any test for factual innocence alone ever could.&quot;

To show just how misleading this self-representation of the CCRC as &quot;champion of justice&quot; is, we need only to look at what the CCRC does in real applications.

In 2005, the University of Bristol Innocence Project commenced its investigation of the case of Neil Hurley, convicted in 1 99 4 and given a life sentence for the murder of Sharon Pritchard, who was bludgeoned to death and left naked in a playing field near her home in Croeserw, near Maesteg, south Wales.

Despite the lack of any direct or physical evidence linking Hurley to the crime, South Wales police saw him as an obvious suspect as he was on bail for charges of alleged threats of violence towards Sharon Pritchard, his former partner, related to their acrimonious split and access to their two children - an allegation he continues to deny.

In 1 99 7, Hurley made an application to the CCRC on the main grounds that several witnesses who gave evidence against him at trial subsequently claimed that they were coerced by officers from South Wales police into making false statements against him.

In addition, Hurley&apos;s application to the CCRC alleged that two other suspects, one of whom ended up as a prosecution witness, may not have been sufficiently investigated by the police. Sharon Pritchard was found in a muddy playing field and the two suspects had allegedly returned home in the early hours of the morning that the murder took place with their clothing covered in blood and mud. Hurley also claimed that the owner of a neighbouring pub may be able to provide an alibi for him at the crucial time when Sharon Pritchard was murdered.

In 2000, the CCRC issued a statement of reasons not to refer Hurley&apos;s conviction back to the court of appeal by explaining the safety of his conviction in law, notwithstanding the possibility that Hurley may, in fact, be innocent.

The CCRC argued that the fact that some witnesses retracted their statements while others did not was not significant enough to render the conviction unsafe in law and so it could not refer his case back to the court of appeal; it argued that the question of other suspects who may not have been investigated properly was addressed in court and heard by the jury who decided to convict anyway; and, it argued that it was aware of a long history of incidents between Hurley and Sharon Pritchard and that during their investigation the police received numerous calls highlighting such history.

In short, Hurley&apos;s application didn&apos;t meet the CCRC&apos;s interpretation of its referral criteria that is determined by its governing statute: the CCRC can only refer convictions back to the appeal courts if it is felt that there is a &quot;real possibility&quot; that the conviction will not be upheld.

This binds the CCRC to the criteria of the appeal courts, putting it in the role of second-guessing what the appeal courts may make of a referral, and preventing independent investigations into applications like Hurley&apos;s to determine whether applicants could be actually innocent. As it clearly states on the CCRC&apos;s website, the CCRC &quot;do not consider innocence or guilt, but whether there is new evidence or argument that may cast doubt on the safety of an original decision.&quot;

Despite this, David Jessel claims that CCRC staff desire to &quot;open a new file in the hope that some new and decisive nugget of truth will come to light&quot;, which lends support to the idea that the CCRC are concerned with truth and with assisting innocent victims of wrongful conviction.

It would be bizarre to claim that the CCRC would not want to refer cases in which evidence of innocence existed. The problem is that new evidence of innocence is unlikely to fall readily from the pages of applications from alleged innocent victims of wrongful convictions who have been convicted in criminal trials and have already lost in appeal. If it was so easy, they wouldn&apos;t have been convicted in the first place and we wouldn&apos;t need a body such as the CCRC to investigate alleged wrongful convictions at the post-appeal stage.

It is in this context that the CCRC&apos;s review of Hurley&apos;s case lays bare the real failure of the safety in law approach to alleged wrongful convictions at the post-appeal stage, as opposed to an approach to investigating claims of wrongful convictions that places the pursuit of truth and the possibility of innocence and exoneration at its core.

Claims of innocence at the post-appeal stage may be valid and require full investigations akin to public inquiries that take the possibility of innocence seriously. Such investigations must step outside of the strict confines of the procedural dictates of the criminal appeals system, which involves searching the masses of unused evidence and exploring scientific techniques that may settle the claim of innocence one way or the other, regardless of whether it constitutes new evidence or was or could have been available at the time of the original trial or whether a jury has heard evidence of innocence and chosen not to believe it – defence lawyers can make mistakes and juries can get it wrong as successful appeals against criminal conviction bear testimony.

Investigations that seek the truth of claims of innocence at the post-appeal stage must operate entirely in the interests of justice: if innocent people are wrongly convicted the guilty remain at liberty to commit more crimes. Investigations that take the possibility of innocence seriously operate equally in the interests of the alleged innocent victim of wrongful conviction and in the interests of victims of crime for whom justice is not served by the wrongful conviction of an innocent. At the same time, if alleged innocent victims of wrongful conviction are found to be guilty, victims of crime and wider society know that the correct person has been brought to justice.

 Most tellingly, the CCRC&apos;s restricted review of Hurley&apos;s application failed to consider the obvious possibility of DNA testing that could potentially exonerate him and possibly even lead to the conviction of the real murderer of Sharon Pritchard. This is all the more surprising for a body that is claimed would &quot;move heaven and earth&quot; to assist potentially innocent victims as more than 120 exhibits were recovered from the crime scene, the victim and Hurley himself that potentially contain biological samples and have yet to be subjected to any form of DNA testing at all.

When thinking about how to assess the CCRC we must remember that it was set up as a supposedly independent public body in response to a widespread public crisis of confidence in the entire criminal justice system that was induced by notorious cases such as the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six . The CCRC replaced C3 Division, the previous system of post-appeal review, that was discredited for not being proactive and the failure of successive home secretaries that were then empowered to refer potentially meritorious cases of alleged innocent victims back to the appeal courts.

The way that the CCRC reviewed Hurley&apos;s application bears all the hallmarks of its predecessor, throwing into sharp relief the limits of its own review processes, and even calling into question the legitimacy of the CCRC experiment altogether.

This is because the failures of the way that the CCRC reviews applications are not unique to the case of Neil Hurley, who represents just one of many other alleged innocent victims of wrongful conviction whose cases were refused a referral by the CCRC and are being investigated by the growing number of Innocence Network UK (INUK) member innocence projects. As with any relatively new venture, there is an inevitable lag between the cases being investigated and them reaching the stage of Hurley&apos;s case when the failures of the CCRC become so apparent. One thing is certain, however, the cases of alleged innocent victims of wrongful conviction do not go away and as time goes on a growing number of cases like Hurley&apos;s will reveal the flaws in the CCRC statutory foundations as it becomes an increasingly untenable post-appeal review body.

CCRC staff may want to see themselves or want others to see them as &quot;champions of justice&quot;, but the reality is that the way that it is remitted to review applications means that it is barred by statute from conducting the kind of investigations that can get to the truth of an claim of innocence.

Al most 13 years on from his first application, Hurley remains languishing in prison three years past his tariff date, the date that he could have been released on parole, when the means of validating his claim of innocence are still waiting to be pursued.

It is a matter of public concern that the DNA tests that can prove whether Hurley is innocent or guilty could have been commissioned by the CCRC when he made his first application in 1 99 7.

It is, perhaps, indicative of the fundamental failures of the CCRC&apos;s method of review that it required the efforts of innocence project students working on a pro bono basis to unearth the potential of DNA testing in Hurley&apos;s case.

The University of Bristol Innocence Project is currently engaged in a dialogue with the CCRC regarding a second application for Hurley based on the DNA assessment that it commissioned.

Until recently, Max Damage headed the FBI&apos;s most wanted list. Then mankind&apos;s premier defender, the Plutonian, went berserk and blew up the FBI.

Something happened in the moment of Plutonian&apos;s transformation, something Max isn&apos;t talking about yet...but it was a transformative moment for Max, as well. After weeks of disappearance, Max has resurfaced, apparently having rededicated his life to superheroism. Max&apos;s sidekick, the severely underage Jailbait, is -- to put it mildly -- unhappy with his bizarre decision. Max&apos;s former enemy, police lieutenant Louis Armadale, is skeptical of Max&apos;s new path...but he&apos;s willing to listen, eager to find out just what set this former supercriminal on his new path...

The second issue of Incorruptible continues to give us more information on Max Damage, revealing more on his super power through a clever shaving scene with him and Jailbait that I really enjoyed. Speaking of Jailbait, I find her parts (no pun intended) hilarious and whenever she comes on-panel I light up with excitement [...]

In his State of the Union address, President Obama claimed that the U.S. had basically ignored the situation in Afghanistan during the 1 99 0s. But as Michael Rubin shows in a disturbing article in Commentary, Obama&apos;s account, as is so often the case when the president dabbles in history, is not correct. Rather, beginning in 1 99 5, before the Taliban had even taken control of Kabul, the Clinton administration began a policy of engagement, a policy that persisted throughout the remainder of Clinton&apos;s presidency.

The history of that policy provides an object lesson in the folly of that staple of modern left-liberal foreign policy, and especially the foreign policy of President Obama -- diplomacy as a substitute for meaningful action against our sworn enemies.

According to Rubin, our government&apos;s courtship of the Taliban began after U.S. diplomats reported that this band of fanatical Islamist radicals liked the U.S. and wanted to improve its image. At around the same time, Osama bin Laden was expelled from Sudan and relocated in eastern Afghanistan, where he was embraced by the Taliban. In response, a U.S. diplomat urged the Taliban to stop sheltering bin Laden.

But rather than backing up this message with any threat of robust action, the administration advised the Taliban that it wished to have frequent meetings in Kabul. This signaled that the Taliban could satisfy the U.S. through talk about expelling bin Laden, as opposed to actual expulsion.

And this is what happened via a bizarre dance that lasted for years. As Rubin reports, the Taliban denied the presence of any terrorists in Afghanistan, while arguing that it could be more helpful in dealing with such terrorists as might find their way into the country if the U.S. would provide it with funding.

Despite the transparent bad faith of this position, the State Department, now headed by Madeleine Albright, continued to negotiate regularly with the Taliban. For its part, the Taliban, in Rubin&apos;s words, continued to &quot;stonewall on terrorism, while dangling just enough hope to keep diplomats calling and forestall punitive strategies.&quot;

In early 1 99 7, the U.S. asked that the Taliban allow a U.S. team to visit the sites of terrorist camps to confirm that activity had ceased. This was a silly request because, as Rubin points out, our satellite monitoring provided more accurate information about the status of terrorist camps than any guided tour could. Nonetheless, arranging for such tours became the focus of our diplomatic efforts.

The Taliban initially agreed to visits, but stalled for months and then rescinded the offer. Meanwhile, bin Laden was plotting his attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Again, the U.S. ignored the Taliban&apos;s blatant bad faith. After striking out on camp visits, our focus returned to the expulsion of bin Laden. The Taliban&apos;s response was that, though it strongly disapproved of bin Laden, it could not expel him because he had been invited to Afghanistan, albeit by the Taliban&apos;s enemies. Under these circumstances, it would violate Afghan culture to turn him away.

This position, laughable though it is, caused the State Department to back down. As Rubin explains, &quot;when American diplomats face a conflict between national security and cultural relativism, they usually defer to the latter.&quot; Moreover, the State Department was so locked into its policy of engagement that any excuse the Taliban offered for refusing to turn on bin Laden was likely to be accepted.

So the U.S. backed off. Its stated rationale was that &quot;not to engage the Taliban. . .will most likely leave them only more isolated, possibly more dangerous, and certainly more susceptible to those wishing to direct Taliban energies beyond Afghanistan.&quot; This type of logic should sound familiar. It is what passes for deep thinking at Foggy Bottom and other liberal enclaves.

To maintain its charade, the Taliban promised not to permit terrorists to use Afghanistan as a base of operations and claimed that bin Laden been muzzled. Both assurances were false. Far from muzzling bin Laden, the Taliban permitted ABC News to interview him. And ten weeks later, al Qaeda suicide bombers attacked our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

The U.S. responded by bombing a terrorist camp in Afghanistan. Mullah Omar responded by denying that bin Laden had planned the attacks and stating, albeit petulantly, that he was open to dialogue. Despite the demonstrable futility of engagement, Albright agreed to more talks.

In the ensuing round of diplomacy, the administration supplied the Taliban with evidence of bin Laden&apos;s culpability in the embassy attacks. But a Taliban court proceeded to find bin Laden not guilty of any involvement. Later, when al Qaeda operatives from Pakistan hijacked an Indian Airlines plane and diverted it to Afghanistan, the Taliban re-supplied them with weapons.

None of these developments, or indeed the absence of any gain from more than four years of engagement, caused the Clinton administration to change course. It continued to reject a self-help approach to dealing with bin Laden, nixing a CIA plan to assassinate the terrorist mastermind. On 9/11, several thousand Americans paid with their lives for Clinton&apos;s criminally misguided approach to al Qaeda and the Taliban.

The lessons of this failed history of engaging the Taliban are also lost on President Obama who, as noted above, misrepresents that history. Indeed, Obama&apos;s public statements show him to be a more vociferous advocate of diplomacy for its own sake than Bill Clinton ever was.

Moreover, Obama proclaimed in his State of the Union address that he intends to engage &quot;those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens.&quot; Richard Holbrooke, Obama&apos;s envoy to Afghanistan, has handpicked a team for that purpose. The team includes the architect of the failed pre-9/11 policy, then Assistant Secretary of State Robin Rafel.

No doubt, she and her fellow diplomats will unerringly identify the members of the peace-loving, human rights respecting wing of the Taliban.

With its precipitous pistes, awesome après-ski and killer cakes, Austria has something for everyone – even those who can&apos;t stand skiing

Hardcore skiers go to Switzerland, groups of mates go to France, the budget-conscious go to Bulgaria or Andorra... so who goes to Austria? Those of us clever enough to realise that the picturesque villages offer wide, quiet runs, fantastic après ski, and a warm, traditional welcome. Oh, and fantastic home-made cakes. Tempted? There are plenty of booking options still available this season, but if you&apos;re not sure which village is for you, here are our top 10 Austrian village resorts, and who they would suit best.  Prost !

1. For beginners – Westendorf 

If you&apos;re a group of first-timers and don&apos;t want crowds and busy pistes, the charming resort of Westendorf is a great bet. The nursery slope has a chairlift (thus avoiding the humiliating falling-of-the-drag-lift moment) and is right in the heart of the village, while the gondola goes up to lovely wide blue runs that are rarely busy. It&apos;s a quiet resort, but there are a couple of lively après ski bars (the Moskito does fine cocktails) and there&apos;s a real sense of a normal Austrian life going on alongside the ski season.

• Igluski.com (020 8544 7191); has a week at the Hotel Schermer from £896 half-board, including flights and transfers on 6 March

2. For mixed-age families – Filzmoos 

For groups with young children who need family hotels and older teens who need a bit of life, it can be hard to find a suitable resort. Filzmoos fits the bill: excellent nursery slopes in the resort, a good snowboard school, and family-friendly après ski bars with enough life to keep the older kids happy but not rolling back for supper completely plastered. The village itself is picturebook-pretty, with a clutch of historic wooden chalets, and there&apos;s a fabulous toboggan run that is floodlit at night.

• Igluski (as before) has a week at the Alpenkrone from £406, half-board, including flights and transfers from 13 March

3. For silver skiers – Oberau 

One of the Tyrol&apos;s quieter resorts, Oberau has just a smattering of hotels, a couple of small shops and a village bar. This is a resort for pottering, gliding down gentle blues, perhaps a morning of cross country, and a lot of lazy afternoons drinking hot chocolate and eating cake. The bigger resort of Niederau has more facilities and slopes and is a short bus ride away, but the joy of Oberau is the feeling of escape and the slow pace of life. It&apos;s also blessed with one of the most welcoming hotels in the Alps, the Gasthof Kellerwirt, run by the irrepressible Hans: charming, slightly bonkers and known to cycle down the pistes on night-skiing evenings.

• Inghams (as before) has a week at the Kellerwirt from £4 99 pp half-board, including flights and transfers from 20 February to 13 March.

4. For groups – St Anton 

To call St Anton a village may be stretching things, but despite its size and party reputation, the centre still has a traditional Tyrolean feel, with pretty wooden chalets, shops and bars stretching along the pedestrianised main street. The skiing is excellent, with a huge number of pistes; a lift pass in St Anton gives access to the whole Arlberg area, including Lech, Zurs and Stuben. But the resort is equally famous for its après ski, with legendary bars such as the Krazy Kangaruh. Perfect for a ski-hard, party-hard week – you&apos;ll need another holiday to recover when you get home.

• Neilson (0844 879 8155; neilson.co.uk ) has a week at the Hotel Alpenhof from 6 March from £1204pp half-board, including flights and transfers

5. For lovers – Alpbach 

A repeated winner of the award for Tyrol&apos;s prettiest village, Alpbach is ridiculously picturesque: a clutch of flower-decked wooden chalets that hold luxurious hotels, a few timber-fronted cafes and bars, and stunning mountain scenery. Piste-wise, it&apos;s really for beginners, as there are only two slopes in the village; there&apos;s a bigger choice of runs at Inneralpbach, a short bus ride away. But this is a resort for those bent on romance: a sleigh ride through the woods, fondue evenings in traditional wooden inns – the Roosmoos at Inneralpbach is particularly lovely – and walks through the snowy countryside over the more than 20km of prepared trails.

• Crystal (0871 231 5659; crystalski.co.uk ) has a week at the Alphof from £489pp half-board, including flights and transfers on 27 February

6. For experienced skiers – Galtur 

High up in the Silvretta mountains, Galtur and its neighbouring resort of Ischgl offer snowsure pistes and some of the most adventurous, challenging runs in Austria. The &quot;Alp Trida&quot; run is a fantastic valley route to the duty-free enclave of Sauman in Switzerland, and there is a good number of challenging blacks and long touring routes. The village of Galtur is lovely, with wooden chalets surrounding a baroque church and a few cosy Alpine bars and restaurants. Ischgl – bigger, brasher and ideal for a big night out – is just 15 minutes away by bus.

• Crystal (as above) has a week at the Alpenhotel Tyrol from £435pp half-board, including flights and transfers on 6 February.

7. For partygoers – Mayrhofen 

For those who still think Austria is something of a backwater for skiing, the sprawling village of Mayrhofen sets out to prove them wrong. Each April, it hosts the Snowbombing festival , Europe&apos;s biggest music festival to be held in the ski season. In 2010 it will run from 5-10 April, and acts confirmed so far include Fatboy Slim, Friendly Fires and – slightly bizarre ly – De La Soul. The skiing isn&apos;t bad, either, with two plateaux – the Penken and the Ahorn – offering great runs, as well as a bus link to the huge Zillertal ski area.

• Neilson (as before) has as week at the Mayrhofen Guest House, £458 half-board including flights and transfers from £458 from March 6

8. For young families – Ellmau 

Ellmau is ideal for those with younger children who are keen to get some serious skiing in while the kids are in ski school or kindergarten. There&apos;s an excellent crèche in the village and wide nursery slopes close to the centre. But there&apos;s also direct access from the village to over 250km of piste, meaning parents can ski to their hearts&apos; content and still be back to meet the kids at lunchtime. There&apos;s a good variety of bars and restaurants, but the nearby resort of Soll is where the real partying takes place, leaving Ellmau blissfully peaceful.

• First Choice (0871 664 0130; firstchoice-ski.co.uk ) has as week in the Landhof Apartments from £429 from 6 March

9. For Glam – Lech 

A favourite of both Princess Di and Bridget Jones (it featured in the second movie), Lech is an atmospheric, elegant village where strains of Frank Sinatra drift out from the alfresco après ski bars in the afternoon. Long blue and red runs swoop down into the village, dotted with picturesque mountain huts offering rum-laced hot chocolates and stunning views. Bag a deckchair outside one of the restaurants in Oberlech at the top of the chairlift, or hop on the bus for the ten-minute jaunt to Zurs, Austria&apos;s most exclusive resort, where the inhabitants are all too busy swigging Bolly to take advantage of the lovely blue runs down the mountain – meaning they&apos;re al most always deserted.

• Crystal (as above) has a week&apos;s B&amp;B; at the Chalet Hilde from £765 including flights and transfers

10. For non-skiers – Igls 

It&apos;s a perennial problem: one partner skis, the other can&apos;t stand it. Igls presents an ideal solution: it&apos;s just a tram ride away from the beautiful city of Innsbruck, where there&apos;s plenty of shopping and sightseeing and not a piste in sight. There are lots of cleared footpaths for crisp wintery strolls, and the Panorama restaurant at the top of the Patscherkofel is easily accessible by gondola, without having to strap on as much as a ski boot.

• Inghams (as before) has a week at the Bon Alpina Hotel, from £564, half-board including flights and transfers on 6 March

Climate emails suggest Phil Jones may have attempted to cover up flawed temperature data

 In a unique experiment, The Guardian has published online the full manuscript of its major investigation into the climate science emails stolen from the University of East Anglia, which revealed apparent attempts to cover up flawed data; moves to prevent access to climate data; and to keep research from climate sceptics out of the scientific literature. 

 As well as including new information about the emails, we will allow web users to annotate the manuscript to help us in our aim of creating the definitive account of the controversy. This is an attempt at a collaborative route to getting at the truth. 

 We hope to approach that complete account by harnessing the expertise of people with a special knowledge of, or information about, the emails. We would like the protagonists on all sides of the debate to be involved, as well as people with expertise about the events and the science being described or more generally about the ethics of science. The only conditions are the comments abide by our community guidelines and add to the total knowledge or understanding of the events. 

 The annotations - and the real name of the commenter - will be added to the manuscript, initially in private. The most insightful comments will then be added to a public version of the manuscript. We hope the process will be a form of peer review. If you have a contribution to make, please email climate.emails@guardian.co.uk . 

 The anonymous commenting facility under each article will also be switched on so that anyone can contribute to the debate. 
 
It is difficult to imagine a more bizarre academic dispute. Where exactly are 42 weather monitoring stations in remote parts of rural China?

But the argument over the weather stations, and how it affects an important set of data on global warming, has led to accusations of scientific fraud and may yet result in a significant revision of a scientific paper that is still cited by the UN&apos;s top climate science body.

It also further calls into question the integrity of the scientist at the centre of the scandal over hacked climate emails, the director of the University of East Anglia&apos;s Climatic Research Unit (CRU), Dr Phil Jones. The emails suggest that he helped to cover up flaws in temperature data from China that underpinned his research on the strength of recent global warming.

The Guardian has learned that crucial data obtained by American scientists from Chinese collaborators cannot be verified because documents containing them no longer exist. And what data is available suggests that the findings are fundamentally flawed.

Jones and his Chinese-American colleague Wei-Chyung Wang, of the University at Albany in New York, are being accused of scientific fraud by an independent British researcher over the contents of a research paper back in 1 99 0.

That paper, which was published in the prestigious journal Nature , claimed to answer an important question in climate change science: how much of the warming seen in recent decades is due to the local effects of spreading cities, rather than global warming?

It is well-known that the concrete, bricks and asphalt of urban areas absorb more heat than the countryside. They result in cities being warmer than the countryside, especially at night.

So the question is whether rising mercury is simply a result of thermometers once in the countryside gradually finding themselves in expanding urban areas.

The pair, with four fellow researchers, concluded that the urban influence was negligible. Some of their most compelling evidence came from a study of temperature data from eastern China, a region urbanising fast even then.

The paper became a key reference source for the conclusions of succeeding reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – including a chapter in the 2007 one co-authored by Jones. It said that globally &quot; the urbanisation influence … is, at most , an order of magnitude less than the warming seen on a century timescale &quot;. In other words, it is tiny.

But many climate sceptics did not believe the claim. They were convinced that the urban effect was much bigger, even though it might not change the overall story of global warming too much. After all, two-thirds of the planet is covered by ocean, and the oceans are warming, too.

But when Jones turned down requests from them to reveal details about the location of the 84 Chinese weather stations used in the study, arguing that it would be &quot;unduly burdensome&quot;, they concluded that he was covering up the error.

And when, in 2007, Jones finally released what location data he had, British amateur climate analyst and former City banker Doug Keenan accused Jones and Wang of fraud.

He pointed out that the data showed that 49 of the Chinese meteorological stations had no histories of their location or other details. These mysterious stations included 40 of the 42 rural stations. Of the rest, 18 had certainly been moved during the story period, perhaps invalidating their data.

Keenan told the Guardian: &quot;The worst case was a station that moved five times over a distance of 41 kilometres&quot;; hence, for those stations, the claim made in the paper that &quot;there were &apos;few if any changes&apos; to locations is a fabrication&quot;. He demanded that Jones retract his claims about the Chinese data.

The emails, which first emerged online in November last year following a hack of the university&apos;s computer systems that is being investigated by police, reveal that Jones was hurt, angry and uncertain about the allegations. &quot; It is all malicious … I seem to be a marked man now ,&quot; he wrote in April 2007.

 Another email from him said : &quot;My problem is I don&apos;t know the best course of action … I know I&apos;m on the right side and honest, but I seem to be telling myself this more often recently!&quot;

An American colleague, and frequent contributor to the leaked emails, Professor Michael Mann at Pennsylvania State University, advised him : &quot;This crowd of charlatans … look for one little thing they can say is wrong, and thus generalise that the science is entirely compromised. The last thing you want to do is help them by feeding the fire. Best thing is to ignore them completely.&quot;

Another colleague, Kevin Trenberth at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, urged a fightback . &quot;The response should try to somehow label these guys and [sic] lazy and incompetent and unable to do the huge amount of work it takes to construct such a database.&quot;

In August 2007, Keenan submitted a formal complaint about Wang to his employers. The university launched an inquiry. Reporting in May 2008, it found &quot; no evidence of the alleged fabrication of results &quot; and exonerated him. But it did not publish its detailed findings, and refused to give a copy to Keenan.

By then, Keenan had published his charges in Energy&amp;Environment , a peer-reviewed journal edited by a Hull University geographer, Dr Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen.

The paper was largely ignored at the time, but Guardian investigations of the hacked emails now reveal that there was concern among Jones&apos;s colleagues about Wang&apos;s missing data — and the apparent efforts by Jones and Wang over several years to cover this up.

Those concerns were most cogently expressed to Jones by his ex-boss, and former head of the CRU, Dr Tom Wigley. In August 2007, Wigley warned Jones by email : &quot;It seems to me that Keenan has a valid point. The statements in the papers that he quotes seem to be incorrect statements, and that someone (W-C W at the very least) must have known at the time that they were incorrect.&quot;

Wigley was concerned partly because he had been director of the CRU when the original paper was published in 1 99 0. As he told Jones later, in 2009: &quot; The buck should eventually stop with me .&quot;

 Wigley put to Jones the allegations made by the sceptics . &quot;Wang had been claiming the existence of such exonerating documents for nearly a year, but he has not been able to produce them. Additionally, there was a report published in 1 99 1 (with a second version in 1 99 7) explicitly stating that no such documents exist.&quot;

This is believed to be a report from the US department of energy, which obtained the original Chinese temperature data.

Wang&apos;s defence to the university inquiry says that he had got the Chinese temperature data from a Chinese colleague, although she is not an author on the 1 99 0 Nature paper.

Wang&apos;s defence explains that the colleague had lost her notes on many station locations during a series of office moves. Nonetheless, &quot;based on her recollections&quot;, she could provide information on 41 of the 49 stations.

In all, that meant that no fewer than 51 of the 84 stations had been moved during the 30-year study period, 25 had not moved, and eight she could not recollect.

Wang, however, maintained to the university that the 1 99 0 paper&apos;s claim that &quot;the stations were selected on the basis of station history: we chose those with few, if any, changes in instrumentation, location or observation times.&quot; The inquiry apparently agreed.

Wigley, in his May 2009 email to Jones , said of Wang: &quot;I have always thought W-C W was a rather sloppy scientist. I would …not be surprised if he screwed up here … Were you taking W-C W on trust? Why, why, why did you and W-C W not simply say this right at the start? Perhaps it&apos;s not too late.&quot; There is no evidence of any doubts being raised over Wang&apos;s previous work.

Jones told the Guardian he was not able to comment on the allegations. Wang said: &quot;I have been exonerated by my university on all the charges. When we started on the paper we had all the station location details in order to identify our network, but we cannot find them any more. Some of the location changes were probably only a few metres, and where they were more we corrected for them.&quot;

The story has a startling postscript. In 2008, Jones prepared a paper for the Journal of Geophysical Research re-examining temperatures in eastern China. It found that, far from being negligible, the urban heat phenomenon was responsible for 40% of the warming seen in eastern China between 1951 and 2004.

This does not flatly contradict Jones&apos;s 1 99 0 paper. The timeframe for the new analysis is different. But it raises serious new questions about one of the most widely referenced papers on global warming, and about the IPCC&apos;s reliance on its conclusions.

It is important to keep this in perspective, however. This dramatic revision of the estimated impact of urbanisation on temperatures in China does not change the global picture of temperature trends. There is plenty of evidence of global warming, not least from oceans far from urban influences. A review of recent studies published online in December by David Parker of the Met Office concludes that, even allowing for Jones&apos;s new data, &quot; global near-surface temperature trends have not been greatly affected by urban warming trends .&quot;

Keenan accepts that his allegations do not on their own change the global picture. But he told the Guardian: &quot;My interest in all this arises from concern about research integrity, rather than about global warming per se. Jones knew there were serious problems with the Chinese research, yet continued to rely upon the research in his work, including allowing it to be cited in the IPCC report.&quot;

Jones on Hughes

One of Jones&apos;s earliest detractors was Warwick Hughes. Today Hughes, describes himself as a freelance earth scientist from Perth in Australia, and calls global warming a &quot;fraudulent notion&quot;. Back in 1 99 1, he was working for the Tasman Institute, a now defunct free-market thinktank based in Melbourne. He analysed a study of temperature trends in the southern hemisphere published by Jones five years before, and claimed that virtually all the warming found by Jones was a result of growing urban influences. Later, he investigated Jones&apos;s South African and Siberian data, claiming of the latter that &quot;cities are the source of the apparent warming, which is not apparent at nearby small town or rural stations.&quot;

The leaked emails reveal a civilised correspondence in 2000 between Hughes and Jones. Jones admitted that Hughes had seemingly found significant &quot;anomalies&quot; in his published data and asking for more details about what he had uncovered. But in 2004, when Hughes asked Jones for monthly temperature data from 3,000 weather stations described on the CRU website as &quot;the foundation of Dr Jones&apos; published papers&quot;, relations soured. After six months of delay, Jones told Hughes in February 2005 that some of the data was confidential but &quot;even if WMO [the World Meteorological Organization] agrees, we will still not pass on the data. We have 25 or so years invested in the work. Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?&quot;

This was at least honest. In emails to his colleagues, Jones often said confidentiality agreements were a useful excuse. As he told Wigley in January 2005 : &quot;Data is covered by all the agreements we sign with people, so I will be hiding behind them.&quot; But for Hughes, he didn&apos;t bother with the pretence. The statement is damaging nonetheless, because the entire purpose of scientific replication is to try to find something wrong with existing data and theories. That is how science advances.

 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - the film version of legendary journalist Hunter S. Thompson´s novel. If Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas isn&apos;t checked off your list of classic must-see movies, Vienna Café will help you sort this out on Thursday! Johnny Depp styled to the point of impossibility of recognition, an immensely decadent ride through Las Vegas casinos and hotel rooms, one of the most vivid depictions of a psychedelic drug rush and in the same time a crucial part of journalistic history. Legendary reporter Hunter S. Thompson made the journey that became a book that became a movie...
Thompson´s book Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream is one of his key works, rooted in autobiographical incidents. The novel first appeared as a two-part series in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, was printed as a book in 1972, and adapted into a film of the same name in 1 99 8 starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro.

You will see Johhny Depp as you&apos;ve never seen him before - this is surely one of the movies that shows how broad his acting skill is and if you thought he could never ever be anything than gorgeous, well, you&apos;re wrong. Both the novel and the filmed version:

 revolves around journalist Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, as they arrive in 1970s Las Vegas to report on the Mint 400 motorcycle race. However, they soon abandon their work and begin experimenting with a variety of recreational drugs, such as LSD, cocaine, alcohol, mescaline, and cannabis. This leads to a series of bizarre hallucinogenic trips, during which they destroy hotel rooms, wreck cars, and have visions of anthropomorphic desert animals, all the while ruminating on the decline of American culture. 
The main interpretation of Thompson´s work is that it shows his experience of and showdown with the hippie movement and its convulsive attempt to remain as a contrast to conservatism and the soulless search of wealth in a USA who´s illusions had been ravaged by the Vietnam war.

Thompson later referred to the novel as &quot;a failed experiment in the gonzo journalism &quot; he practiced, which was based on William Faulkner&apos;s idea that &quot;the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism, and the best journalists have always known this&quot;. Thompson&apos;s journalistic style blended the techniques of fictional story-telling and journalism.

The man who put the story under his creative wings and made this excellent movie out of it is former Monty Python member Terry Gilliam . Gilliam is currently in the spotlight for his latest film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and at the moment working on The Man Who Killed Don Quixote , in which we might pair with Johnny Depp once again...??? 

The Vienna Café screening of this reckless ride will be in English with Chinese subtitles.

It was a bizarre subplot to a $40 million Ponzi ring in Folsom: four people dressed in bulletproof vests and posing as federal agents in an unsuccessful effort to retrieve money on behalf of investors.

Three of the four have pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Sacramento in connection with the misguided strong-arm operation, federal prosecutors said Monday.

The fourth defendant, Michael David Sanders of Fair Oaks, has pleaded innocent. Sanders, a Navy veteran and motivational speaker, is accused of leading the strong-arm effort.

Prosecutors said the foursome walked into a Folsom office last March and confronted three men associated with an alleged $40 million Ponzi scheme. The four were equipped with bulletproof vests, handcuffs, badges and earpieces. His lawyer has said the leader of the effort, Sanders, was carrying a stun gun.

Pacing around the room, they announced they worked for the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission and demand that the three men wire the exact sum of $378,300.16 to an account at an area credit union.

The group didn&apos;t wire the money, although prosecutors have said the four appeared to be genuinely working on behalf of people who had lost money investing with Equity Investment Management and Trading Inc. of Folsom.

A couple of days after the confrontation, federal officials shut down Equity Investment.

Pleading guilty in the strong-arm scheme were Craig Anderson, 39, of Chicago, who admitted to a felony conspiracy to impersonate an officer; Sean Smartt, 41, of Sacramento, and Cassandra Moore, 26, of Beverly Hills. Smartt and Moore pleaded to misdemeanor charges of unlawfully possessing false documents.

Smartt and Moore could get up to one year each in prison; Anderson faces up to five years. The three will be sentenced in late April.

The alleged leader of the strong-arm plot, Sanders, has been described by Equity Investment victims as a good Samaritan who had been working on their behalf for several months before the confrontation last March.

Sanders won plaudits from Sacramento police for crusading against drug dealers while managing an apartment complex on Mack Road in the 1 99 0s.

He is scheduled to go to trial March 1 in U.S. District Court.

Two men have been charged in connection with the actual Ponzi scheme.

Anthony Vassallo of Folsom and Kenneth Kenitzer of Pleasanton were charged with defrauding some 150 customers by promising 36 percent annual investment returns. Prosecutors said Equity Investment squandered most of the money on bad deals.

Vassallo has pleaded innocent. Kenitzer agreed to plead guilty last October, although the formal plea won&apos;t come until Friday, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin Taylor.

The tough political strategist is taking on his biggest challenge yet: coaching Gordon Brown for TV election debates

 Age: 57.

 Appearance: Earnest, grizzled New York pollster and political strategist.

 And what is he? An earnest, grizzled New York pollster and political strategist.

 Claim to fame: Getting President Obama elected.

 What&apos;s he up to now? He is about to take on his toughest challenge.

 Preparing Sarah Palin for her presidential bid in 2012? Harder.

 Making Nick Clegg interesting? That would be a killer, but this is worse.

 You&apos;d better break it to me . . . Coaching Gordon Brown for the televised ­election debates.

 Jeeeeeeez! Nightmare. The jowls, that halibut-like movement with the jaw, the bizarre pronunciation, where do you start? Happily, that is Mr Benenson&apos;s problem, not ours.

 Does he have the skills to do it? I quote from the website of the Benenson Strategy Group, the company he co-founded in 2000: &quot;He has helped guide corporate clients through some of the most notable communication challenges in the past decade . . . He was the lead strategic researcher for Procter&amp;Gamble&apos;s launch of Olestra, the fat substitute.&quot;

 Sounds perfect preparation for steering us to our political future: Don&apos;t get heavy on me. This is Pass notes, not the Political Quarterly.

 What else do we know about him? Used to work as a political journalist for the New York Daily News; was communications director for New York governor Mario Cuomo&apos;s 1 99 4 campaign (don&apos;t tell Gordon, in case he throws something, but Cuomo lost in a landslide); was a vice-president at the New York ad agency FCB.

 Key objectives: Making sure Brown does not cry, grin or mention boom and bust.

 Not to be confused with: The other 486 political strategists who claim to have been instrumental in getting Obama elected.

 Do say: &quot;Great news that the Labour party is gearing up to fight this election with proper metrics and a slick communications team.&quot;

 Don&apos;t say: &quot;Remind me. Who was Clement Attlee&apos;s spin doctor?&quot;
