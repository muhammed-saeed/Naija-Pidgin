 On-campus eatery: Cathedral 

What’s not to love about the Cathedral? There’s Chick-fil-A next to a sushi vendor if you need to grab a quick bite to eat between classes.

 Editors’ Pick: Market Central 

 Bar food: Hemingway’s Cafe 

Students flock to the narrow confines of Hem’s to feast on Cardiac Stix, inhale a few Cloggin’ Fries and drink some beer. Well, lots and lots of beer.

 Editors’ Pick: Mad Mex 

 Dessert: Razzy Fresh 

With locations on Forbes Avenue, Craig Street and Murray Avenue, it’s a little-known fact that you’re never more than 18 feet away from a Razzy Fresh frozen yogurt parlor. Impress your friends with a half-peanut butter, half-taro cup topped with Cap’n Crunch — or you can just opt for vanilla.
