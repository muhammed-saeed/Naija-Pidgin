Pasta recipe sauce white
 
 Carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta recipe. Its name comes from carbone, which is Italian for coal, and many believe the dish derives its name because it was popular among charcoal makers working in the Apennine Mountains. Most people believe, however, that the dish is called carbonara simply because of the black, freshly milled pepper that is used.The original recipe from the Italian region of Lazio uses eggs, garlic, parmigiano reggiano, pecorino romano, guanciale (unsmoked pig cheeks), black pepper and extra virgin olive oil. Cream is not an ingredient in this recipe, and it is not generally used with pasta in central Italy. While guanciale is the most authentic and traditional meat used in carbonara, pancetta is an acceptable substitute, as is any unsmoked bacon. American-style smoked bacon may also be used, though its heavy smoky flavor can overwhelm the equally important flavors of egg, pepper, cheese, and oil; it should be regarded as a last resort if guanciale or pancetta is not available. The original recipe does not call for a heavily saucy pasta; the eggs and cheese need only to form a coating on the noodles, with pieces of pancetta scattered throughout.The Italian-American recipe commonly referred to as carbonara is made from cream, eggs, parmesan cheese (sometimes with pecorino romano cheese), and pancetta (or some other type of bacon). Some American recipes add salt, pepper (white or black), and/or garlic to taste; with peas added for color. This preparation is saucier than the Italian version, and has more in common with a cream sauce such as that incorporated into Fettuccine Alfredo.In both versions of the recipe, the eggs are added to the sauce raw, and cook with the heat of the pasta itself.The Italian-American carbonara can occasionally be served with mushrooms cooked in with it. Origin and historyLike most traditional recipes, the origins of the dish are obscure, and there are many legends about it. As the name is derived from the Italian word for coal, some believe that the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian charcoal workers. Others say that it was originally made over charcoal grills. Still others suggest that it is so named because the specks of bacon and pepper in the pasta look like bits of charcoal. It has even been suggested that it was created by the Carbonari (&quot;charcoalmen&quot;), an Italian secret society.The dish was obscure before the Second World War, and it is not present in Ada Boni&apos;s classic book La Cucina Romana, which was published in 1927. It is thought to have originated in the hills outside Rome, not in the city itself. Its popularity began after the Second World War, when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by troops from the United States. It also became popular among American troops stationed in Italy; upon their return home, they popularized spaghetti alla carbonara (spaghetti with carbonara sauce) in North America.
