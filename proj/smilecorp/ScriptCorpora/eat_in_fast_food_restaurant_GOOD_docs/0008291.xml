 Restaurant Franchise Opportunity for sale in Arizona and

 A Rich Past Behind Us: An Even 
 Richer Destination Ahead 
From humble beginnings in Eugene, Oregon, the TacoTime 
 Restaurant Chain has risen to dominate its position today as 
 the quality leader in the Mexican Quick Service Restaurant 
 franchise industry.
 
There are QSR restaurant franchise chains that are bigger, 
 but the guest knows whose food is the best. All of our 
 products are made with the freshest most wholesome 
 ingredients available. And our menu offers the guest a real 
 choice, from vegetarian items to our unique line of Crisp 
 Burritos. This has been the key to our success for more than 
 four decades now.

TacoTime goes beyond mere claims to quality, it&apos;s a promise 
 to our guests. A promise we proudly display in our 
 restaurants.

 Our Guests Can&apos;t Wait For Us to Grow 
The TacoTime Mexican QSR franchising chain has incredible 
 growth potential, which we are aggressively pursuing. In 
 many of our existing markets people are clamoring for more 
 TacoTime restaurants.

There are also undeveloped areas that are lacking the 
 high-quality, affordable Mexican food flavors provided by 
 TacoTime. And today, with Mexican Food the fastest growing 
 segment in the Quick Service Restaurant franchise industry, 
 TacoTime is an established brand positioned as the 
 taste-quality leader for the 21st century. With more than 
 300 restaurants worldwide and more than 40 years of 
 experience, we look forward with excitement to solid growth 
 of the TacoTime restaurant system in the coming decade.

 With a menu like ours, too bad you have to ever get full 
No other Mexican fast food restaurant has a menu as varied 
 and delicious as ours. From our signature Crisp Burritos to 
 our unbeatable Casita Burrito, you&apos;ll find fresh 
 ingredients made withhomemade care. Even our side items are 
 something special, like our Stuffed Mexi-Fries, which we 
 cook to order, hot and irresistible. We also have unmatched 
 alternative items, like our huge Veggie Burrito. Plus, our 
 dedication to new products means our menu is always 
 improving. Our Chicken and Black Bean Burrito reinvents our 
 delicious burrito flavor. Guests have certainly come to 
 expect that the best only gets better at TacoTime. Who are 
 we to tell them differently?

 Franchise with Us 
As one of the fastest growing franchising and marketing 
 companies in North America, Taco Time Restaurants are owned

 nutritious eating. They include Frullati Cafe, Surf City 
 Squeeze, Ranch 1, Samurai Sam&apos;s, 
 Rollerz and Taco Time - all of which deliver strong unit 
 economics, people-pleasing menus and operational ease. 
 Kahala is also offering co-branded opportunities to both 
 existing franchisees as well as new prospects.
