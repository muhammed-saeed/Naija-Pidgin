 3. Cultural Exchange: Palma de Mallorca and Madrid 
By Annie Whittaker

Early September marks the long awaited return of Dirk Nowitzki to international basketball competition. The final rounds of the EuroBasket tournament in Madrid, Spain portend intense battles for the German National team; as the host country is a heavy favorite to win. With an Olympic berth on the line, spectators are sure to witness some fierce title competition.

Basketball wont be the only part of a great time in Spain. Palma de Mallorca and Madrid are fantastic places for those who are traveling to watch the games in person. Germanys team will start competition in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands.

You can expect typically Mediterranean weather here; in September its hot and dry with cooling sea breezes providing some heat relief. The residents of Palma enjoy the highest standard of living in Spain due to its highly sought after beaches. This popularity means lots of tourists, so things can get a bit crowded. But youll find many sights to see in Palma other than beaches. The Gothic cathedral, La Se u, took almost 400 years to build and overlooks the nearby Parc de la Mar . The relics of the Banys Arabs, dating back to the 10th century, give a small glimpse into the Moorish influences in the area. The Castell de Bellver , built in the 14th century, is the best place to take in views of the entire countryside. While youre there, be sure to visit the history and art museum within the castle grounds.

After a fantastic (and victorious) visit to Mallorca, the next stop for Team Germany and fans will be Madrid. Expect the night life to be as hot as the weather! Young Madrilenos are known to party and dance all nightand then go directly to work. Of course Dirk and company will need to avoid participating in this tradition until after the tournament. Perhaps the evening festivities are the reason for another famous activity (or non-activity) in Madridthe siesta . When visiting Madrid plan ahead for eating or sight seeing between basketball games. Many of the local shops will shut down from 2 until 4 p.m., and then they will re-open for a couple of hours.

The people in Madrid have a relaxed attitude about much of life. Residents are generally friendly and talkative. Dinner is usually latearound 8, 9, or even 10 p.m. Speaking of dinnerany visit to Madrid requires indulging in the local cuisine. You simply should not miss the specialties of paella , seafood, and tortillas. Tortilla de patata is a heavenly potato pancake, and dont forget the gazpacho or lentil soup with chorizo .

Places to see in Madrid are as varied as the types of architecture. Youll find famous buildings and museums, as well as parks and monuments. Madrid has a rich history with multi-cultural influences including the Celts, Moors, Romans, French, and others.

 
 Beautiful parks and varied architecture make Madrid a beautiful place to visit. 

Valley of the Fallen, a memorial site to 40,000 soldiers who died in the Spanish Civil War, is a reminder of the tumultuous past of Madrid. A massive cross rests above a mountain top with a basilica and mosaic vault directly underneath.

 
 A huge cross marks the memorial at the Valley of the Fallen. 

The world famous Museo del Prado features the works of artists such as Velazquez, Goya, Rubens, Picasso, Raphael, Botticelli, Rembrandt, Titian, and many other master artists.

Madrid is home to sporting events other than the EuroBasket tournament. It claims the largest bull fighting arena in Spain: Las Ventas. Real Madrid , one of the worlds most successful football (soccer) teams, also calls Madrid its home.

For fans who enjoy shopping as much as basketball (shopping can be a sport!), the cobblestone streets reserved for pedestrians only offer relaxed window shopping opportunities. For adventurous shoppers, visit the flea market, El Rasto , on Sunday mornings. Madrid is also a place to find beautiful parks for strolling, listening to street musicians, or taking a siesta!

 
 Stroll along cobblestone streets in Madrid. 

The extensive public transit system is a great way to get around Madridto see the sights and get to the games. Fans making the trip to Spain will have the opportunity to experience world class basketball and cheer for Dirk and Team Germany. Between games youll find endless opportunities for adventure. The lucky fans who will be attending the EuroBasket Championship are in for the trip of a lifetimethe combination of a great place to visit and the best basketball in Europe. Its is enough to make the rest of us jealous!

 4. An American in Dirksland, Part IV: Wrzburg 
By Linda Greenwell

If you visit Germany, you certainly want to include Dirks home town in your itinerary. Wrzburg is conveniently located at the northern end of the Romantic Road, a modern highway following an ancient Roman route that merchants traveled during the Middle Ages. Wrzburg is a Bavarian city, but its just a few hours from any place in Germany.

Youll see it appear from the highway as a cluster of red rooftops dotting the hillsides. And like so many German towns, church steeples rise above homes and businesses. Wrzburg is a city of churches. Predominantly Catholic, you will find beautiful examples of every major architectural style and period. The history of the church in Wrzburg revolves around the citys patron saint, Saint Kilian. Kilian was a missionary bishop from Ireland who came with a priest, Coloman, and a deacon, Totnan. Kilian converted the reigning Franconian, Duke Gozbert, and many of his followers to Christianity. Kilian and his two fellow missionaries were martyred, allegedly at the command of the Dukes wife, on 8 July 689. Today, St. Kilians statue stands with other well known saints along the Alte Mainbrcke . The city cathedral bears his name, and his relics are buried below iton the place of his martyrdom.

 
Sankt-Kilians-Dom stands on the place of his martyrdom. 

The Dom today is completely reconstructed following its destruction late in World War II. When you enter, you will see a visual representation of the Bible from the vestibule with its wrought iron Garden of Eden, to the menorah at the beginning of the nave, to the crucifix hanging at the center of the crossing, and on to the Second Coming at the apse. If you are fortunate enough to be in the courtyard when the Dom bells begin to ring, you will be treated to a soul-stirring call to worship that reverberates from your eardrums all the way to your toes.

 
 The reconstructed Dom gives a visual representation of the Bible. 

 Der Residenz 
 
 Walk just a few blocks east of the Dom to Der Residenz , the palace of the prince bishop. 

Built from 1720-1744, the Residence combines the plans of renowned architect Balthasar Neumann with L. v. Hildebrandt of Vienna and M. von Welsch of Mainz. Inside you will see a stunning entry staircase; the worlds largest ceiling fresco by the Venetian, Tiepolo; stuccowork by Bossi; and room after room of rich Rococo dcor. Outside, you will find the beautiful court garden with sculptures, putties, wrought iron gates and manicured plantings surrounding the water basin.


 
Der Residenz has its own chapel with frescoes by Byss and altar paintings by Tiepolo. 

 Festung Marienberg 
 
 Saint Kilian (right) stands with a golden sword on the Alte Mainbrcke as the prince bishops castle overlooks the Main.

Across the Alte Mainbrcke on the west side of the Main the Festung Marienberg keeps watch over Wrzburg. This magnificent castle dates back to the fortified retreat of the Hallstadt period in 1000 B.C. The foundations of the current fortress date to about 1200 A.D.

Today the castle houses two museums. The Mainfrnkisches Museum in the armory wing displays Franconian artwork from a prehistoric collection to world famous sculptures by Tilman Riemenschneider. The Frstembaumuseum in the princes wing depicts 1200 years of Wrzburg history culminating with a three-dimensional city plan that shows the destruction caused by Allied bombing raids and subsequent fires on March 16 and 22-24, 1945. Today the city is beautifully restored.


 
 Like the palace across the river, Festung Marienberg has its own chapel. 

From its hillside above the river, the castle has beautiful views in all directions. To the east, it looks across the river toward the heart of Wrzburg. Vineyards climb the slopes in multiple directions. To the south, it faces another hillside of varied architectures, including the striking onion domes of the Kppele .


 
Die Kppele is a pilgrimage church built by Neumann in 1748. 

In addition to the centuries of history, art, and architecture, Wrzburg is a great place to have fun. Like the other regions weve visited, Wrzburg celebrates special occasions with city festivals. In May the Himmelfahrt holiday (Ascension Day) started with church services and swung right into a Musikfest. All over the cityfrom the Marktplatz to Festung Marienberg , bands dressed in native costumes played tunes old and new. The food vendors set up near umbrella tables and chairs, and not even a little spring rain could dampen the spirits of the entertainers or the entertained.


 
 A band member waits for his time to play in der Marktplatz.


 
 Bands also played in the castle during the Musikfest.

What else might you do in Wrzburg? Shop at the local Marktplatz (outdoor flower and vegetable stands and lots of shops and stores). Stop in at the local gummi candy store and choose your favorite size and flavor. Take a leisurely trip up and down the river or stop off at a riverside Biergarten for some local refreshment.


 
 Tour boats docked near the Alte Kranen offer trips up and down the Main. 

Churches, vineyards, history, art, architecture, a major university, the lab where Wilhelm Conrad Rntgen discovered the x-ray, a castle, a palace, great food, and friendly peopleWrzburg has some of everything thats wunderbar about visiting Germany.

 3. EuroBasket 2007 
By Annie Whittaker

Now that the 2006-07 NBA season is a distant memory, many fans are going through DWS (Dirk withdrawal syndrome). But have no fear, that affliction may be short lived because the FIBA EuroBasket (European Championship) is approaching.

FIBA is the international governing body of basketball. The FIBA EuroBasket tournament occurs every 2 years. This year the championships will be held in Spain, September 3-16, 2007. The tournament begins as four groups of four teams compete in a round-robin tournament. The teams now scheduled to compete are Greece, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Croatia, Latvia, Portugal, Germany, Lithuania, Turkey, Czech Republic, France, Slovenia, Italy, Poland. One spot remains for a team to be determined in a tournament later this summer.

Germanys team qualified to play in this years EuroBasket when they took the Silver medal in 2005. During that tournament, held in Serbia and Montenegro, Germany lost to Greece in the finals. The German and Greek teams were both surprise entrants into the final, having defeated heavier favorites to get there. The final score was 78-62 with Greece winning the Gold medal. Dirk had 23 points and 9 rebounds in this spectacular contest. He was the top scorer of the tournament with a 26.1 point per game average. He also earned MVP honors. (See the September and October 2005 newsletters for more details on EuroBasket 2005.) 

The EuroBasket Championship is a qualifying tournament for the FIBA World Championships, which are held every 4 years. The champion team wins the Naismith Trophy, named for James Naismith who invented basketball. Dirk Nowitzki is 9th on the all-time highest scoring average list for the World Championships. In Indianapolis in 2002, the German team won the bronze medal, their 1st ever medal in the World Championships. Dirk was the top scorer, made the all tournament team, and was declared the tournament MVP as well.

 
 Courtesy of EuroBasket archives 

In 2006, Japan hosted the World Championship, and Germany lost in the quarterfinals; however, Dirk claimed third place on the FIBA Europe 2006 Player of the Year list. The next World Championship will be held in Turkey in 2010. Turkeys team will qualify automatically for the tournament because they are the hosts. The 2008 Olympic Champion also will receive an automatic berth. Other teams will earn a spot through continental qualifying tournaments (such as the EuroBasket, Americas Championship, etc.).

NBA fans will find other familiar players competing in the FIBA competitions. Players like Yao-Ming, Pau Gasol, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobli, and Andrei Kirilenko are only a handful of the NBA stars who have helped lead their countries in world competition. Heres an interesting factoid for Dallas Mavericks fans: Shawn Bradley was a member of the German National Team in 2002. Having been born in Landstuhl Germany, he was eligible to play for either Germany or the U.S.

EuroBasket 2007 is not only important to determine the European Champion, but will also determine who qualifies to play in the 2008 Olympics in China. Twelve teams will compete in the Olympic Mens Basketball Championship. The host country has an automatic berth into the tournament. The 2006 FIBA World Champion, Spain, has also qualified to compete. After that, seven spots will go to: the Africa Zone Champion, the Americas Zone Champion and Runner-up, the Asia Zone Champion, the Europe Zone Champion and Runner-up, and the Oceania Zone Champion. The remaining three qualifiers will come from the 2008 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament to be held July 7-13, 2008 at a site not yet announced.

For fans who prefer to sit in the stands (and who wouldnt?!), the zone competition for the Americas will be held Aug 22-Sept 2, 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tickets for both the American and European tournaments are available now. Go to www.FIBAAmericas.com For EuroBasket, go to www.eurobasket2007.org. In Palma de Mallorca Spain, Germany begins play Sept. 3rd against the Czech Republic at 18:00 and again at 20:30 vs. Turkey. This is two weeks of world class basketball, all day, every day! Its a gym rats dream! As more information becomes available, television and web cast schedules will appear on various websites, including 41fan.net.

With so much riding on tournament success in Spain this year, a great deal of weight is being placed on the shoulders of Team Germany and their star, Dirk Nowitzki. According to the website of EuroBasket 2007; like no other team at EuroBasket 2007, Germany will rely on one player. But coach Dirk Bauermann is just happy hes got Dirk Nowitzki on his side. Much of the coachs decisions will be based on how to best utilize his other players skills to best fit around the Dallas Mavericks star Without a doubt, Germany will only go as far as Nowitzki takes them. Nowitzki will need the help of his supporting cast if Germany is (to) replicate their success from 2005 and take a step furth(er) at EuroBasket 2007. This could be one of final runs for this group of German players. Nowitzki is now [29] years old and has said he would like to retire from the National Team after the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Surely, in what could be his last Eurobasket, Nowitzki and Co. will be motivated to go out with a bang. Lets all hope the latter part is true, but it is much too early to be using the R word regarding Dirkin any context!

The FIBA regional championships last only for a few weeks this summer; but until the NBA season resumes in the fall, they will give a shot in the arm to those who are suffering from extreme DWS. Good luck to Dirk and the German team on their fast approaching title endeavor!

 4. An American in Dirksland: Pt. III, Nordrhein-Westfalen 
By Linda Greenwell

Last month we went south of Frankfurt to the rolling hills of Baden-Wrttemberg. This month well head north, visit a Schlo or two along the Rhine, and discover some wonderful towns in Nordrhein-Westfalen. Lets get started.

 Along the Rhein 
Head west out of Frankfurt on the A60 (A indicates an autobahn) and pick an interesting little town along the Rhine River. If you chose Ingelheim-Nord, you can drive right up to a ferry dock at the river. If youre hungry, leave the car in a designated parking area nearby and walk west along a pretty path to the Strandbad-Gaststtte. It isnt much to look at from the outside, but inside youll find good food, friendly people, and an eating area on the front porch that looks right out on the river. After a leisurely walk back to the dock, get the car and take the ferry across to the other side. While youre waiting to drive onto the ferry, look for an ice cream (Eis) vendor in a small trailer beside the ferry landing. He sells some of the best ice cream cones you can imagine! I had a double decker that included chocolate hazelnut. Sigh Nutella-flavored ice cream! Its right up there with pistachio-almost on my all-time best list!

The ferry will drop you off at across the river at Oestrich-Winkel, where you can head northwest to the nearest castle. Schlo after Schlo will appear on the horizon, and its well worth stopping here and there to admire the architecture and the vineyards.

 
 Schlo Johannisberg has a beautiful view of its vineyards stretching to the Rhein. 

 On to Nordrhein-Westfalen: First stop--Gescher 
Grab an autobahn with an odd number (just like in the U.S., the odd numbers run north and south and the even numbers run east and west) and head north. We took the A3, which runs past the town of Dierdorf, thought to be the home of my ancestors. As the hills flatten out into rolling farmland, youll pass the exits for Bonn (the capital of West Germany prior to reunification), Cologne (Kln), and Dsseldorf. On the north side of Essen, switch to the A31 and keep going north. Just off exit 33 is a great little town called Gescher. Here in the heart of Westfalen youll find an amazing mixture of towns, factories, and farms called Mnsterland, from its regional capital, Mnster. Best of all, you will discover some of the cultural activities that make each area of Germany so special.

In Gescher we stayed in a small hotel on the edge of town. Its the kind of place where the neighbors gather in the evening for dinner or at least Bier and conversation. You get wonderful service in these small, family-owned hotels. Youll enjoy it even more if you can speak just a little bit of German.

 
 You get a neighborhood atmosphere with personal service in small hotels. 

Gescher is the home of a bell factory that makes bells for people and places all over the world. Church bells, ship bells, cow bells, and sleigh bellsThe Glocken Museen displays centuries of craftsmanship.

 
 At the Glocken Museen, you can carry a rubber mallet to ring the bells as you tour the museum. 

 Mnster 
A short drive or a pleasant train ride east will bring you to Mnster, another historically significant city built on the Aa River. The name Mnster evolved from the monastery (&quot;monasterium&quot;) built by Frisian Liudger, a missionary sent to the region by Charlemagne in the late 8th Century. The Anabaptist rebellion occurred here during the Protestant Reformation, and the Thirty Years War ended here with the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.

Mnster is also home to the Bundeswehr with the German-Dutch Corps and British military units in and around the area. It was a major military headquarters for the German Wehrmacht during World War II, which resulted in heavy Allied bombings that destroyed most of the city. Like other cities and towns throughout Europe, the people restored and rebuilt the city to its pre-war splendor.

To learn more, take the Old City tour that leaves from City Hall (das Rathaus) . They offer tours in German or English.

 
 Die Clemenskirche (St. Clements Church) is a beautiful representation of the Baroque period (built in 1745-53). It displays a Bavarian color scheme unusual in Westphalia.

 Stadtkirche St. Lamberti (City Church, St. Lambert) is one of the best late Gothic style churches in Westphalen. One the outside you will still see the cages used to display the tortured bodies of the Anabaptists. But on the inside, you will find a fabulous clock that presents a re-enactment of the Nativity every day at noon. Angels blow trumpets and ring bells. Mary and Joseph accept gifts from the wise men, and hymns play as the characters move.

 
 Wise men bring their gifts to the Christ child every day at 12:00. 

 City Festivals 
Throughout Westphalen (and even on a side trip across the border to Winterswijk in The Netherlands), we enjoyed a variety of city festivals. In Gescher we went out early to the edge of town where a local shooting club was preparing for their annual Schtzenfest. The day begins with each of the riflemen lining up to receive their instructions. After they are sworn to their appropriate duties, the mounted guard and the band lead them by age groups on a parade through town to pick up the reigning king. Once they return to the grounds, the festival begins. At the end of the day, the one who successfully drops the wooden bird becomes the new king. He and his designated queen host the rest of the men and their wives for a grand celebration of dining and dancing.

 
 Mounted guards and the band lead the Schtzenfest members to escort the king. 

Mnster hosts their annual spring Stadt Fest in May with street vendors, musicians, and plenty of food. Mnster has about 280,000 inhabitants and nearly 600,000 registered bicycles. Riders have their own traveling lanes and a multi-story bicycle parking garage.

 
 Mnsters Stadt Fest has everything from a one-man band

 
to street vendors

 
and lots of bicycles 

These are just a few of the highlights of the wonderful people and places of Nordrhein-Westfalen. We havent even touched on the wild horses, or windmills, or the industrial towns of the Ruhrgebiet. Youll just have to see it one day for yourself.

Next month well put the wrap on this tour with a couple days in Dirks hometown: Wrzburg! See you then.

 3. Mavericks off-season activities 
Although itâ€˜s seemed awfully quiet on the Mavericks front to us as fans, lots of big and little things are going on behind the scenes. We know Dirk has been down under and enjoying some time at the beach. Here are some other tidbits:

-- Erick Dampier had surgery to repair the tear in his rotator cuff and get his shoulder back to 100%. Mark Cuban also had surgery to replace his left hip.

-- Devean George opted out of his contract to check out the free agent market, but has agreed to a new contract with the Mavs.

-- Mavs officials negotiated a new contract with Jerry Stackhouses agent.

Signing day is Wednesday, 11 July 2007.

 
 Pops hopes to renew his contract with the Mavs. 

-- Both Pops Mensah-Bonsu and J.J. Berea are on the bubble. In August the Mavericks must decide whether to exercise their options for a second year.

-- Sam Vincent left Averys coaching staff to become head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats.

-- Del Harris retired from active coaching, but will be available as a consultant for as long as he and the Mavericks are interested in tapping into his expertise.

-- Paul Westphal joins Averys coaching staff. Westphal has been broadcasting the past few years. Previously, he coached at Pepperdine University and the Phoenix Suns and Seattle SuperSonics.

-- Donnie Nelson was named the second best basketball operations leader in the NBA by a national magazine.

Donnie Nelson and the Mavs staff are working the phones daily for other free agents who might be a good fit at the right price. Among those on their wish list is Charlotte Bobcat, Gerald Wallace. Wallace also appears on several other teams lists of desired free agents, but his price tag would probably require a sign and trade deal for the Mavs. Free agent center, P.J. Brown, is another possibility. The Mavs are awaiting his return from vacation and a decision on whether he will retire or return for another NBA season.

The Mavericks drafted three players in the NBA draft. With the first of their second round picks (#34), they chose Nick Fazekas , out of the University of Nevada. Nick has Dirk-like characteristics as a 611 power forward who shoots well facing the basket. During the 2006-07 NCAA season only two players averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds per game. One was #2 pick, Kevin Durant of Texas. The other was Nick Fazekas. He was named Player of the Year three of his four years in college for the Western Athletic Conference.

Nick shot nearly 85% from the free throw line and almost 57% from the field. He is one of only six players in the NCAA to score 2,000 points, pull down 1,000 rebounds, shoot 50% from the field and 80% from the foul line. Hes in pretty good company. The others are Rick Barry, Larry Bird, Bill Bradley, Christian Laettner, and Keith Van Horn.

Dallas also drafted at #50 and #60. With the 50th pick, they drafted 65 guard, Renaldas Seibutis , a Lithuanian who will likely remain another season in Europe. He has played for Olympiakos and Maroussi in the Greek A-1 league.

The Mavs traded their 60th pick, Milovan Rakovic, a center from Serbia, plus cash considerations to Orlando for the rights to Reyshawn Terry (chosen 44th). Reyshawn is a 68 forward from North Carolina who can shoot threes and block shots. He also pleased the coaching staff with his court awareness and ability to defend.

Now weâ€˜re in Summer League play in Las Vegas, July 6-15. The Rocky Mountain Revue League will follow in Salt Lake City, Utah July 13-20.

 
 Mo Ager will use the Summer League games to get ready for the season. 

The Mavericks summer league roster includes four current Mavericks, all three draft picks, and a variety of newcomers:
-- Mo Ager G Michigan State
-- Eddie Basden G North Carolina-Charlotte
-- Brandon Bass F LSU
-- J.J. Barea G Northeastern
-- Warren Carter F Illinois
-- Gana Diop C Oak Hill Academy H.S.
-- Leonardo Dos Santos F Brazil
-- Nick Fazekas F Nevada (drafted #34)
-- Caleb Green F Oral Roberts
-- Jamon Gordon G Virginia Tech
-- Pops Mensah-Bonsu F George Washington
-- Jared Newson G Tennessee-Martin
-- Renaldas Seibutis G Lithuania (drafted #50)

The team debuted 2 July with a 105-100 victory against the Chinese National Team in an exhibition game at SMUs Moody Coliseum in Dallas. Pops Mensah-Bonsu gave a crowd-pleasing performance on both ends of the floorespecially his defense and offensive rebounds. He was also the leading scorer with 24 points and 10 reboundseight of them on the offensive end. He even got a highlight moment in the second quarter by rejecting Yi Jianlians shot.

 4. Mighty good essen und trinken ! 
Youre in Germany! Do you really want to eat at some American fast food chain? Of course not! (Yes, they have them there too.) We stayed at hotels that offer a complementary breakfast ( Frhstck ) included in the room rate. In Tuttlingen the buffet offered a traditional German breakfast plus scrambled eggs, bacon, and link sausages for visiting Americans. The traditional German breakfast includes a platter of three or four types of cold cuts and cheese, wonderful crusty rolls ( Brtchen ) and whole grain breads, a variety of Marmalade including Johannesbeere (black current), Erdbeere (strawberry), or other fruits, or (yum-sigh-groan-with-pleasure)Nutella. (Leave it to the Europeans to come up with a chocolate nougat sandwich for breakfast! Im hooked!) Youll often see yogurt. And you may see hard-boiled eggs served in egg cups with little spoons. Remove the top of the shell and eat the egg with the spoon. You will also find a small selection of cold cereals, coffee, tea, Orange Safte (orange juice), and in some places, a specialty coffee machine that dispenses hot frothy things. Then we have Brezeln ! If you like American soft pretzels, you have to try these!

Where families can gather at midday, the main meal of the day is Mittagessen . The restaurants will serve a main meal for either Mittagessen or Abendessen , so you can choose the traditional German way or have a larger meal in the evening.

 
We were fortunate to arrive just as Weispargel (white asparagus) and Erdbeere (strawberries) were in season. Nearly every menu had specialty dishes with Spargel . Spargel Suppe (soup), Spargel with Schnitzel , Spargel with Wrst , Spargel with cheese sauce. Yum!

It would difficult to visit Germany without sampling the Wein and the Bier . We saw large and small vineyards in each region we visited, but many excellent German wines never make it out of the country.. Red, white, dry, or sweet, you will find local wines for every connoisseurs taste.

 
 Vineyards produce some excellent local wine in and around Wrzburg. 

Beer comes in various colors and flavors as well. Each region has its own specialties, and they serve each type of beer in its designated size and style of glass. Some of the primary categories of beer include
-- Pils the clearest and lightest in color
-- Weibier a light-colored beer often called Hefeweizen or yeast wheat beer
-- Dunkelbier dark beer
-- Malzbeer made with more malt
-- Altbier literally old beer, a darker, lager-type beer
-- Klsch A Pils-style beer brewed only in or near Cologne
-- Radler a good choice for light drinkers, since it is part Pils and part lemonade

For non-alcoholic beverages, you will find a variety of fruit juices and soft drinkswe even found Dr Pepper in some of the convenience stores at gas stations. A favorite German soft drink is called Spezi (pronounced speh-tzi ). It comes ready made under several brands, or you can fix it yourself by combining Coke with orange soda (or as the locals say, Cola und Fanta). For water drinkers, youll have no problem. We drank tap water in the hotel rooms and filled a plastic bottle to take with us each day. When you order water at a restaurant the server will bring a glass bottle of sparkling mineral water, which he or she will pour into a wine glass for you.

Whether you order beer or a soft drink, you will always get exactly the amount you paid for. Youll know because the glasses have fill marks on them and the drinks come chilled but without ice. Note that free refills are not included in the price of your drinkeven in a fast food restaurant with a self-serve dispenser. Seconds and free refills are available only at complementary breakfast buffets in the hotels.

If you have the opportunity, try Quark with your Erdbeere . Its a rich creamy concoction of white curd cheese (made from buttermilk) whipped with milk and sugar. Add some fresh strawberries (or cherries and currents, or even chocolate sprinkles), and you have a mouth-watering Nachtisch (dessert), or a mid-afternoon snack, or a TV snack, or . Hmm. I wonder how Quark would be for Frhstck ?


 5. An American in Dirksland, Part II: Baden Wrttemberg 

 
Germany has 16 states called Lnder (meaning countries). Historically Germany has always consisted of various alliances between individual kingdoms or duchies. Some of the current Lnder are city states, such as Berlin and Hamburg. Others, like Bayern (Bavaria) were originally independent countries.

Baden Wrttemberg formed in 1952 when Baden, Hohenzollen, and Wrttemberg in the southwestern part of Germany became a single entity. Here you will find the Black Forest, the source of the Danube (Donau), the Rhine (Rhein), rolling country rising to the foothills of the Alps, and Lake Constance (Bodensee), Europes second-largest lake.

 
 The Danube makes its debut in Baden Wrttemberg. 

This is a Land of great beauty, small towns, respected universities (including Tbingen, Freiburg, and Heidelberg), and significant manufacturing. More than 40% of Germanys manufacturing employees work in Baden Wrttemberg. Perhaps youve heard of some of their products: Mercedes, Porsche. (Both automobile manufacturers are based in Stuttgart.) Youve probably been touched by others as well.

 
If youve loved a stuffed animal made by Steiff, it all started in Giengen.

In Tuttlingen, a town of about 35,000 people, manufacturing firms create two-thirds of the surgical instruments used throughout the world.

 
 Tuttlingen as seen from its Medieval castle, the Honberg 

Here are some must-see locations in Baden Wrttemberg.

 Der Schwarzwald 
 
The Black Forest is a land of towering pines, rolling hills, switch-back roads, and beautiful villages. It has the highest elevations in Baden Wrttemberg for great skiing and hiking trails. (Feldberg is the highest, at 1233 meters or 4035 feet) Its also the home of the cuckoo clock.

 
Visit the Uhren Museen (Clock Museum) in Furtwangen for the complete history of German clock making. In addition to cuckoo clocks, youll see everything from a stone-weighted pendulum to an atomic clock.

 Insel Mainau 
 
Nestled in the arms of the Bodenee (Lake Constance) is an island of flowers and butterflies. Mainau is a beautiful estate developed by the late Lennart Bernadotte, a former Prince of Sweden. His wife and children run the Lennart Bernodotte Foundation and its management company. And, this garden island practices and teaches environmental responsibility.

 
It has an amazing array of formal and informal gardens, including imported Giant Sequoia trees, cactus gardens, and thousands of flowerssome especially for kids.

 
You can also enter the tropical Smetterlingshaus where the butterflies are as beautiful as the flowers.

 Stuttgart 
Stuttgart is another must-see destination for those who love cars, enjoy history in the automobile era, have a friend who loves cars, have ever ridden in a car. You get the picture. Both Mercedes and Porsche have museums and limited factory tours.

From the design of the building to its in-house dealership, the Mercedes Museum is amazing. Once you purchase your ticket, you receive an audio guide, which is an electronic device a little larger than an iPod that you hang around your neck. (You get to keep the Mercedes lanyard when you turn it back in.) The device interacts by RF or Bluetooth technology to describe any of the exhibits youre visiting. You may choose a German-speaking guide, or one that speaks to you in English.

 
Next you enter an ultramodern elevator and whisk to the top floor. From there, you follow the curved contours of the building to wind your way down through seven floors and 160 exhibits. Along the walls between levels you can read about the decade(s) depicted and see the interplay of Daimler/Benz vehicles with human history since1886. Through world wars to the Beatles, Lady Diana, the Pope, and modern racing. Its all here.


 
And once you get to the bottom floor with the race cars, be sure to buy a ticket for the simulator. Wrap your fingers around the steering wheel and tear across a century of motor speedways with bumps, jolts, flying turns, and near misses.

Now you have just a teaser for the variety of things to see and do in Baden Wrttemberg. Next month well head north and check out more great places to visit.

 1. Fans of the Month: Wrzburg TGW Turngemeinde 10 and Under Basketball Team with Coach Simon Wagner 

 

Our fans of the month are the Club TGW Turngemeinde Wrzburg Basketball Team (10 years and younger) of Dirkâ€˜s hometown They are very proud of Dirk and canâ€˜t wait for him to come for their annual basketball camp this summer.

If you would like to be Fan of the Month, send your photo to FanOfTheMonth@41fan.net

 2. Dirks Calendar 
Dirk has been backpacking in the backcountry of Australia and enjoying the beaches in Tahiti this month. He remains officially on vacation for the remainder of June.

 3. The 2006-2007 Mavericks in Perspective 

The 2007 NBA Finals is set to tip off, but the last Mavs game sure seems like a long time ago. Given a little distance to set our perspective, lets take a look at the 2006-2007 roller coaster ride we took with our boys in blue.

Way back in October we greeted seven new additions to the team: Devean George, Austin Croshere, Anthony Johnson, Greg Bucker, Maurice Ager, Jose Juan Barea, and Pops Mensah-Bonsu. It took a while for Coach Johnson and the staff to sort through all the possible combinations (J.J. Barea wasnt even in the photo roster of the first batch of Tipoff programs for the regular season because he had to work his way past three other contenders for the final roster spot.) Add some minor injuries and illnesses, and the camp and pre-season games were a little ragged. Despite a few bumps and rattles, the Mavericks train chugged to the top of the first big hill about four games into the season. Then, in Phoenix, everything started rolling.

 
 2007 gave the Mavs two All Stars. 

Along the way we lost D.J. Mbenga to knee surgery and Anthony Johnson to the Hawks. But we didnt lose much else through November, December, January, and February. The ride got a little slower in March, and ground its way around some tight corners in April. Then it coasted to a halt a bit short of the goal in May. We started with great expectations. And we had a marvelous ride. Although we were disappointed that it ended too soon, Dirk brought one more sweet victory when the NBA rewarded him a second term on the First Team All NBA roster and his first NBA Most Valuable Player award.

So lets take a look at some of the thrills we enjoyed during this MVP season.

Best record in Mavericks franchise history: 67-15 (Sixth best in NBA history)
Home record of 36-5
Winning streaks of 12, 13, 17, and 9

First All-Star appearance for Josh Howard
Sixth consecutive All Star appearance for Dirk (Mavericks franchise record)
First Maverick since Jason Kidd (1996) to start an NBA All Star game

 4. An American in Dirksland: Part. I, Getting there is half the fun 

 Things to do; places to go; people to see. 

Between now and the start of the Mavericks preseason, well look at Dirks summer activities and Germanys bid to make the 2008 Olympics; and well also take a look at Dirkslandumm, Deutschland through this Americans eyes. To those German fans whose regions we werent able to visit on this trip. I sincerely hope I have a next time to see more. To those who helped me plan this trip and showed us such gracious hospitalityHerzlichen Dank! Ihr seid die Besten!

 Planning the trip 
Nothing beats having a native to help guide your planning, but with or without local assistance, you can do a lot of research on the Internet to help prepare the way. Here are some of my suggestions:

1. Decide where you want to go
Dont try to do everything in one trip (unless youre planning to spend at least a month there). Choose your must-see area(s) and book a room that you can use as your base for day trips. This will minimize time spent packing, unpacking, and dragging your luggage with you every day. It also gives you an opportunity to meet people and learn about the local customs and activities. Our must-see areas covered the western half of the country, so we stayed three nights in Tuttlingen, two nights in Wrzburg, three nights in Gescher, and our final night near the Frankfurt airport.

2. Decide how you want to travel
Fly to the airport nearest your intended area. Frankfurt has direct flights from Dallas and other major cities in the U.S. or around the world. It is centrally located north to south, and just west of central going east and west. However, if we had been staying only in Bavaria and Baden-Wrttemburg, I might have flown into Zurich instead.

 Planes 
Consider your travel time and luggage situation. The direct flight from Dallas to Frankfurt is 9.5 hours, with a Frankfurt to Dallas time slightly longer than 10 hoursassuming no delays. If you book early, you can fly the direct flights for the same price as you would pay later for flights with stops and potential plane changes. Remember that beyond the extended travel time for you, every connecting flight is one more time the baggage handlers have to unload and reload your luggagehopefully to the right airplane.

 Trains 
Decide before you go how you want to travel in Germany. German trains run just about everywhere. You can buy an ICE rail pass online for the number of days you will need to travel. Print it on your own printer, and its good for the entire trip. Check it out at www.deutschebahn.de. The local trains and trams are also pretty easy to figure out. Each station has a ticket machine similar to an automated teller. You choose your destination, one-way or round trip ticket, and the number and type of riders (bicycles and dogs must also have tickets). Enter the stated codes and the machine will display the cost. Then you pay, and it prints your ticket(s).

 
 You can get nearly anywhere by train or tram. 

 Automobiles 
If you prefer to drive, you can also book your reservation online. Note that in Germany many people drive cars with a standard transmission. If you want an automatic transmission, you will probably need to reserve a larger car. A navigation system may also be a good idea. We had problems with ours in some of the rural areas, but it worked well in and around the larger cities.

Since we were visiting mostly smaller towns and wanted to see the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) we decided to rent a car rather than purchase a rail pass. We drove a five-passenger M class (station wagon) with a diesel automatic. You buy fuel by the liter in Europe, so remember that it takes 3.785 liters to make a gallon. Diesel is cheaper than gasoline (benzin), but once you multiply the cost in Euros by the conversion rate to dollars, youre paying roughly $6 or more per gallon of fuel. (And weve been complaining about $3 a gallon!)

 If you drive. 
Although your U.S. drivers license is acceptable, you can get an international drivers license from AAA in the United States. You will need two passport size photos and $15. You can mail in your application or get it while you wait at the local AAA office. (Check for other fees or restrictions if you are not a member.) Check the Internet for driving laws and road signs before you go. One helpful site is here: http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/driving.html. You should note that Germany uses cameras on the highways and at stop lights to catch speeders and those who run red lights. Tickets come later by mail.

It is illegal to pass on the righteven on a multi-lane highway. And you must always drive in the furthest available right-hand lane on the autobahn except when you are passing.

The autobahns have speed limits for trucks (80 KPH) and posted speeds near towns or in construction areas. In open areas, the suggested speed limit is 130 KPH, but cars may travel at whatever speed the driver believes is safe to drive. This makes passing interesting when you pull into the left lane to go around a truck and discover a car that barely registered in your rear-view mirror is now on your bumper with his lights flashing. A truck attempting to pass another truck is rather entertaining, if youre not in a hurry to get someplace.

 
 The milesumm, kilometersgo by in a blur at 130 KPH. 

 Drinking and driving 
Germany has no tolerance for those who drink and drive. Beer and wine are plentiful, and the drinking age is 16; but you should choose a designated driver. Blood alcohol levels above 0.5 milligrams per liter will cost you stiff fines and your driving privileges.

 Parking 
Park your car only in designated areas. Many small towns will have a Parkscheinautomat for street parking. This is a type of automated teller located at one point along the block. Its good for all designated parking spaces on that block. You insert the appropriate coins for the time you intend to park. The teller will print a ticket that indicates the time your ticket will expire. You put the ticket on your cars dashboard.

Parking lots and garages also have automated tellers. As in the U.S., you will receive a ticket when you enter the lot or garage. Be sure to take the ticket with you, because near the door or walking entrance you will find another teller machine. When you insert the ticket, it tells you the charge. Once you have inserted the appropriate amount, it returns your validated ticket. The validated ticket will raise the barrier arm when you insert it at the exit.

 Hotels 
You can find hotel chains in major cities, but we chose to stay in smaller towns and local establishments. Ask the forum members for advice in their local areas or use an Internet review site like tripadvisor.com if youre uncertain about taking a chance. Unlike American hotels, you will incur a fee if you cancel your reservation. These may range up to 80-100% of the room rate. We reserved the Frankfurt room through Expedia, which charged our credit card on the day we booked. But I booked the others online through their own websites. In Tuttlingen and Gescher, I requested the reservations by email.

Read the room descriptions carefully, especially if you choose a smaller hotel. A single room is an Einzelzimmer. A double room is a Doppelzimmer. Often the double rooms will be two single beds put together, so you have the equivalent of what Americans know as a king-sized bed.. Each person has an individual Decke or blanket that is quilted material inside a sheet-type cover. Youll have a fitted bottom sheet, an oversize, fluffy pillow, and your Decke rather than the double sheets and blanket you would normally find in the U.S. Very comfy!

 
 Unfold your Decke and snuggle in for guten schlaf! 

You will also want to check the room description for a shower (Dusche) or bathtub (Bad), and WC. The hotel staff will replace any towels you leave on the floor, but in the spirit of conservation you can just hang them back on the towel racks and use them again the next day. Youll generally receive a bath mat, bath towels, and hand towels, but not the wash cloths were accustomed to in America. If thats a big deal for you, take a couple along.

Your room description may also list things like Kabel- or Sat-TV, W-LAN, Telefon, Minibar, and other fixtures. Check for a hairdryer too, if you dont have a voltage converter strong enough to handle the wattage of your personal blow dryer. And speaking of voltage converters. You will probably want to recharge your cell phone, computer, or camera battery. Germany has recessed receptacles, which means you will need a converter with an extended plug. I bought one at RadioShack before we left. We also saw some at the Frankfurt airport.

 
 Get a power converter with an extended plug. 

Well, youre all set to decide where to go, how to get there, and where to stay. Next month well talk about some cool places to visit and great German food and beverages. Sigh. So much to do; so little time!

 1. Fan of the Month: Sue Patterson 

 
This months Fan of the Month is Sue Patterson of Fort Worth, Texas (second from the right), shown here with her family on a hiking trip in Germany.

Sue tells us, I have been a Dirk (and Mavs) fan for quite a long time! I never miss a game. I have two jobs, so I tape the games and watch them in segments. I enjoyed basketball as a teenager; and when my son became interested, we began to watch the NBA together. [His] friends came to our house to play basketball in our driveway, then to eat and watch the game. I made many taco dinners as we cheered the Mavs to victory!

I have always loved Dirk. He is a great basketball player and so much fun to watch! I especially like his attitude on and off the court. He sets a great example for young people today! He must be a very nice person, and I appreciate that his parents raised him to be strong, but humble. Dirkâ€˜s effort and vision to win have inspired me to work toward several of my dreams again.

If you would like to be Fan of the Month, send your photo to FanOfTheMonth@41fan.net

 2. Dirks Calendar 
At publication time, we had no information on public appearances for the remainder of May.

 3. The Beat Goes On 
From the end of the season through the playoffs weve seen a lot of local and national media discussing the Mavericks. We may or may not agree with their assessments of our team. Nonetheless, we understand that their jobs are to gain ratings or sell newspapers and magazines while they bring us their versions of the news.

If you want the most reliable media information about the Mavericks, look for the beat writer who covers the team. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, that would be Eddie Sefko for the Dallas Morning News or Art Garcia of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . In the midst of a crazy playoff environment, Eddie Sefko was kind enough to share some of his insights on the Mavs.

Eddie has been covering the Dallas Mavericks for the past five seasons. He came to Dallas following 21 seasons at the Houston Chronicle , 11 of them covering the Rockets.

The beat writers, along with other credentialed media, have access to the Mavericks (coach and players) at designated times after practices and before and after games. Heres a typical scenario for Eddie as he prepares his articles for the next days newspaper.

 
 After they finish practice, coaches and players will talk to the media. 

On practice days, I try to have an idea about what to write before I get to practice and develop the theme during interviews after the workout. Usually, Iâ€˜m done with that by 1 or 2 in the afternoon and, after a late lunch, I usually start writing and hopefully finish by 6 p.m.

On a game day, I go to the morning shoot around to gather some notes and quotes that may be usable in the following dayâ€˜s paper. Iâ€˜ll go back home between the practice and the game, get back to the arena around 5 p.m. and spend the time from 6 p.m. to 6:45 talking to coaches and players in the locker room. Covering the game is hectic. [He writes the article as the game progresses.] Home games end at about 10 p.m. I usually have to be done with my story by 10:45. Often, I donâ€˜t get back from the locker room after interviews until 10:30 p.m. If need be, I can rewrite, although I try to limit those situations.

Covering the team is nearly a 24/7 assignment during the season. Each days story covers about 15 column inches, which means 500-600 words. Eddie will also write a second story of odds and ends that dont fit in the main story. This will include brief tidbits about individual players or events, injuries, and news of interest. These run an additional 350 to 400 words. Thats 850 to 1000 words a daythe equivalent of a 5-6 page double-spaced composition for school.

Although the team has periodic days off, he usually writes every day during the season.
From time to time he will write an off-day story or send another staff writer on a road trip to get a few days off.

Traveling used to be the most fun part of the job, Eddie says. Now itâ€˜s the biggest headache. Current security requirements, among other changes, make it more difficult to travel than earlier in his reporting career. Usually he travels alone and makes all his own reservations. He and Art Garcia are the only writers who are with the team on the road. They fly commercial flights and, due to budget restrictions, rarely stay at the teamâ€˜s hotel.

Despite the grind and the travel trials, covering the team gives Eddie an opportunity to get to know the players in ways that the general media or those outside the Mavs organization rarely could. He shared this as one of his favorite experiences with Dirk.

This season, we got a too-much-information interview with [Dirk] in Denver when he detailed his stomach virus in graphic detail. You find out at times like those that Dirk has a terrific sense of humor and doesnâ€˜t mind spilling his guts, in more ways than one.

In five seasons with the team, Eddie has had the opportunity to see some significant changes in Dirk. No matter what you hear or read from other sources, these are the observations of someone who sees the Mavericks from media day in October to the final playoff game. Here is Eddies analysis, exclusively for our 41fan readers.

 
 Dirk has grown more comfortable talking to the media 

Dirkâ€˜s game obviously has gotten better, but to me the biggest change is that heâ€˜s learned to be a leader. Not always with words, mind you. But sometimes he didnâ€˜t have the touch that leaders need in the past. Now, I think he knows when and how to assert himself with teammates. Heâ€˜s also become much more comfortable in dealing with the media, although I think he still has some room for growth in that area. Heâ€˜s so funny and has such a good personality that if he just lightens up a little bit, he will have the media eating out of the palm of his hand. Some of us are close to doing that already.

Eddies advice to Dirk is appropriate for all of us. Lighten up. Soon were going to have a few days off from Mavs basketball. But it wont be long. The beat goes on.

 4. Business 1010: Thats Entertainment 
Use whatever adjectives you like: Shocking! Embarrassing! Even disappointing, frustrating, or sad will do. We all hoped and expected to watch the Mavericks play deep into June.

Before game 6 even ended the media jumped immediately into what Randy Galloway calls over-reaction mode and blasted the Mavericks. Of course, Dirk caught the forward edge of the explosion. Beyond that, many stated that the amazing regular season becomes meaningless with the historic collapse.

Over-reaction indeed. While no one can discount the economic benefits of a successful team playing deep into June, the business of professional sports is entertainment. Sports teams are entertainment with the highest degree of drama. Its live action. No one knows the outcome. It may be loosely scripted, but its a living, changing script. Its competitive. And its interactive. The fans in the arena believe they can help will their team to victory and often work nearly as hard as the players to make it happen. Do you enjoy game shows? Do you vote for your favorites on American Idol or Dancing with the Stars ? Even TV entertainment believes in interactive programming because the audience loves being able to actively cheer for their favorites and influence who wins. On TV or in person, we love rooting for the good guys and the underdogs. We love a night outor a night in. We record games the way we do our favorite shows. But we also stay up too late or get up too early to watch games live.

Ive been privileged to have Mavericks season tickets for the past two years. Co-workers talked me out of a few of them this year, but I saw four pre-season games, 34 regular season games, and three playoff games in the American Airlines Center. I went home disappointed seven of those 41 times, but I was entertained every time. Yes, I saved a lot more money than expected on this years playoffs tickets. But did I get my moneys worth? Every penny! Mavs basketball is great drama. Its great fun. Its entertainment.

For now, well grieve for a while, And then well look forward to next season. So lets lighten up and wrap up this season with a few reminders of how well Dirk and the team entertained us this year.

 
 Now and then Dirk played the 5 spot

 
He also enjoyed some action at the point.

 
And he spent a little too much time affronted by a Warrior at the 4. 

When all is said and done.

 
 Our MVP lets the media spin their stories any way they want,

but at 41fan.net, we know that

 
Dirk rocks!

 2. Dirks Calendar 
Friday, 20 April at 7 pm CDT: Listen to www.espn1033.com or come on out to the SpeedZone for the Jason Terry Show!

Other than joining the JET for his radio show, April is all about basketball for Dirk. Hell have minimal outside activities as the Mavericks close out the regular season and begin round one of the playoffs.

 3. Running for the Prize 
 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. 
1 Corinthians 9:23-25

Wasnt it just November the other day? And we were all worried about the 0-4 start? Here we are in April with just a few games remaining before the playoffs begin. Season ticket holders should already have their tickets in hand. And single game tickets are on sale (or werebefore they immediately sold out).

 
 The playoffs are just days away 

Now the Mavericks have come from their worst start to their best-ever season. Lets take a look at some of their accomplishments:

Coach Avery Johnson collected his first 100 victories faster than any coach in NBA history with a victory over Denver on 31 December. His 100-31 record eclipsed Red Auerbach, who needed 135 games to reach 100 victories.

This seasons Mavericks earned their best record through the first fifty games: 41-9. This is the eighth-best record in NBA history.

Dallas has set franchise records for
- Most wins in a regular season: 63 and counting
- Double-digit winning streaks: 12, 13, and 17 (and almost a fourth as the Mavs made it to 9 games before the heartbreaking loss to Phoenix.
- Lowest score by an opponent: 65 points by Minnesota on 27 February. The previous low was 68, which the Mavs have done three times.
- First perfect month: February, when they won 10 games sandwiched around the All Star break. The last team to go undefeated with 10 or more games in a month was the 1996 Spurs, who went 16-0 for March.
- First 6-0 road trip: Ten teams have completed a perfect six-game road trip, but the Mavs are the first since the Kings and Jazz during the 2000-2001 season.
- Most appearances in an All Star Game: Dirk for his sixth consecutive year

This year marks the first All Star appearance for Josh Howard

The Mavs have the first MVP in a D-League All Star Game: Pops Mensah-Bonsu

The Mavericks can tie or beat the mark for best record in the second game of back-to-backs. The Mavs won 11 straight, dropped 1, and have since improved to 13-1. A win with the season finale would take the lead. The history of NBA teams with excellent records in back-to-back play includes four other teamseach of whom went on to win the NBA championship:
1995-96 Bulls 21-2
1999-00 Lakers 20-2
1982-83 Sixers 23-3
1996-97 Bulls 19-3

League honors this year include
Western Conference Coach of the Month for February: Avery Johnson
Western Conference Player of the Month for February: Dirk Nowitzki
Western Conference Player of the Week
- Dirk Nowitzki: November 20
- Josh Howard: December 26
- Josh Howard: January 2
- Dirk Nowitzki: January 16

The Mavs lost their first two home games in November, but have won 34 of the last 36 at the American Airlines Center. They blew past their previous franchise home winning streak (16, set last season) to win 23 straight home games.

Dirk scored his 15,000th career point in the opening shot against the Knicks on 30 March. Only Rolando Blackman has more in the Mavericks history book with 16,643. Jerry Stackhouse also topped 15,000 this season (accumulated with four NBA teams.)

 
 Dirk surpassed 15,000 career points on 30 March against the Knicks 

Dirk has collected 41 double doubles (so far), topping his 35 during all of last season.

And while were looking at Dirktistics.

Dirk leads the Mavericks in points with 24.7 per game (13th in the league)
Dirk leads the Mavericks in rebounds with 9.1 per game (21st in the league)
Dirk is 4th in the NBA in efficiency with a rating of 27.1
Dirk is 2nd in NBA efficiency per 48 minutes, with a rating of 35.87 in 74 games. (Yao Ming is first at 35.98 through 43 games.)
Dirks 41 double doubles is good for 7th in the league.
Dirk is also 7th in the NBA in points + rebounds + assists average with 37.2

 
 Will Dirk be the MVP? Well know soon. 

Its been an amazing year. And the best is still to come.

The Mavs have wrapped up their third Division Championship. (They won their first and second division titles in 1987 and 2003.) But the prize is still ahead.

Coach Johnson tells the media regularly that the NBA is a marathon, not a sprint. The regular season is almost over. And on 21 April, the Mavericks will get their second wind to run for the prize.

 1. Fan of the Month: 
 
 Dominic the Dominator and Dirk 

This months fan of the month is 6 year-old Dominic St. Leon of Plano, Texas.

Heres what his mom said about Dominics meeting with Dirk:
&quot;My son will be 7 in August and is one of Dirks biggest fans. We were fortunate enough to be able to meet Dirk at a special event. After the event was over, Dirk was extremely nice to stay for a few minutes and take photos with some of the fans. Dominic, all of 311 (1.3m), walked right up to his idol and asked if they could take a picture together, Dirk was so thoughtful and kind not to deny my son his dream. He was so nice to my son and left a positive impression on him that will last for years. Once Dominic saw that Dirk had cut his hair, he wanted his doneso we did, right after the event. Dirk was awesome. My son plays basketball in Plano and has been nicknamed the Dominator. He tries to do jump shots like Dirk; he rebounds, and he blocks out the opponents. He loves to shoot on our hoop at home, and he commentates on his games. Of course he is always Dirk.&quot;

 3. When You Wish. 
Its been a tough season so far for the 5th grade YMCA Panthers. But February 21st, things started looking upway up! Thats when they got the chance to interview a tall blond with a buzz cut who could really make a difference for them at center.

Thanks to the Make-A-Wish organization, the Panthers and their parents, coaches, and a few siblings spent an hour with Dirk that they will never forget. First they joined their hero in the locker room where they could ask him anything they wanted to know.

 
 Dirk listens to the Panthers questions 

Panther: What video games do you play?
Dirk: Im not really big on video games.

Panther: How tall were you in 5th grade?
Dirk: How old am I in 5th grade?

Panther: Is it hard to dunk?
Dirk: Not at my size.

Panther: What size shoe do you wear?
Dirk: These are 15

Panther: Could you play with us on Saturday?
Dirk: What time is the game?

Panther: When we go to shoot around, can you do a slam dunk?
Dirk: Ill see what I can do

Panther: (drawing a circle in the air) Can you do a three.
Dirk: A 360? I cant do all that. I dont have any hops.

Panther: Did you like going to the All Star Game?
Dirk: I liked it!

Panther: How much do you get paid?
Dirk: (laughs)

Panther: Why did you cut your hair?
Dirk: Because I felt like it.

Dirk: Who is the top scorer on your team?
Panther: Mason
Dirk: Ill take Mason one-on-one.

 
 Dirk signs jerseys, balls, photos. 

Next Dirk signed balls, jerseys, caps, photos, and anything else the boys had brought, while smiling parents and a dozen cameras captured these special moments. Once he had signed everything, Dirk took the team on a quick tour of the Mavs weight and game rooms, and then sent them down the stairs to the practice court.

For the next 30 minutes the Panthers and a few of their older brothers shared the Mavericks practice court with its biggest star. First Dirk led them in a game of knockout. Looks of fevered intensity accompanied their shots and scrambles for reboundsparticularly on the faces of those who found themselves shooting in front of Dirk.

 
 All eyes are on the ball when Dirk shoots 

Next Dirk named himself captain of the blue team and picked a captain for the silver team. They chose their sides and began a half-court make-it, take-it scrimmage. With an expert passer feeding the blue team, they quickly took the lead. But the silver squad threatened a comeback, and Dirk schooled the young team on the importance of defense. The blue team captain grabbed rebounds, trapped the ball handlers, and swatted shots that drew plenty of oohs and aahs from the parents and the players themselves. And yes, he showed them a few of those previously requested dunks.

Following the scrimmage, Dirk and the boys had some group photos at center court. Dirk also signed and presented a pair of game-worn shoes to one of the team members. Then they lined up for one more game of knockout. Gana Diop appeared on the catwalk above the court; so with the teams encouragement, Dirk invited him to join their game. All too soon Dirk won (again), and it was time to go.

An hour with their favorite NBA superstar: It was a wish-come-true for the Panthers.

 4. A Week in the Life of an NBA Superstar 
Dirk doesnt talk much about his off-court activities. Youll rarely even see him on those NBA Cares commercials. But he does a lot of work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and other charities. He responds to wishes and visits children in every NBA cityfitting them in as the Mavs schedule allows.

As fans, it looks to us like the Mavericks have lots of free time. After all, they just practice for a couple hours on off days and have an hour shoot around followed by about three hours on the court game days, right? Well, not exactly. In addition to his real job and his charity events, Dirk finds his schedule packed with public service announcements, media interviews, and Mavericks promotional activities.

Heres a look at a week in the life of Dirk Nowitzki.

Dirk will tell you he hates the media; but he loves his fans, and he loves kids. Most of all, he loves basketball. And he understands that part of his stardom means talking with the media, signing his name thousands of times, and occasionally playing a pick-up game with a dozen 10- and 11-year olds. The great ones talk about giving back. Dirk gives back day after day with grace, patience, and humor. Its all part of what makes him an NBA Superstar.

 3. 2007 NBA All Stars 
 
 Courtesy nba.com 

What does Dirk have that no other Maverick has? Well, for one thingan invitation to Las Vegas for the 2007 All Star Game. Dirk accepted this honor live on TNTs broadcast February 1st, while expressing his disappointment that Josh Howard was not also on the list.

This is Dirks sixth invitation to an All Star gamethe most of any Maverick. His previous appearances were
 2002 in Philadelphia, where he scored 12 points in 24 minutes with 8 rebounds and 3 assists.
 2003 in Atlanta, where he played 16 minutes and had 9 points with 1 rebound and 1 assist
 2004 in Los Angeles, where he scored 2 points and had 1 assist and 2 steals in 13 minutes
 2005 in Denver, where he played 21 minutes, scored 10 points, pulled down 7 rebounds, had 2 assists, 4 steals, and 4 blocked shots.
 2006 in Houston, where he scored 10 points in 16 minutes with 6 rebounds. Dirk also won the Foot Locker Three-Point Shootout in this, his third appearance. (He finished second in 2000 and third in 2001.)

 
 Its Dirkfor 3! 

In 2007, Dirk will defend his three-point championship on Saturday night. (Look for Jason Terry to join him for another shot at the Three-Point Shootout.) On Sunday, Dirk will come off the bench for the West team in the All Star game, and during the rest of the All Star break he will have a variety of special events and appearances plus some special time with his family and friends.

Josh Howard will also be spending some quality time with his familyparticularly his son, born January 31st, unless Commissioner Stern names him as a replacement for either Yao Ming or Carlos Boozer. Both are injured and unable to play.

(Editorâ€˜s note, 9 February: Commissioner Stern named Josh Howard and Carmelo Anthony as injury reserves.)

So what does it mean when the best team in the NBA has only one All Star? Well, as one of our forum members stated, Thats good for the MVP race. Steve has two other All Stars. Dirk has none.

 4. More than halfway 
We know Coach Johnson likes to divide the season into 20 game segments. So here is a look at some of the highlights:

First 20 games: 14 wins; 6 losses
Next 20 games: 18 wins; 2 losses
Third 20 games: 6 wins; 1 loss (through 31 January)

This 38-9 record ties for the best start in the history of the franchise. It also puts the Mavs on the top of the NBA leader board.

What else have Dirk and the Mavs accomplished so far?

Dirk and Josh have both been named Western Conference Player of the Week twice this season, with Josh taking back-to-back honors the last two weeks of December. Dirk picked up his second honor for the week of Jan. 8-14.

The Mavericks have run off winning streaks of 12 and 13 games (franchise record is 14 to begin the 2002-2003 season).

The Mavs have played back-to-back games 10 times so far this seasonwith a perfect 10-0 record on the second games.

Austin Croshere, getting 24 minutes in the Seattle game, pumped in a career high 34 points on 11 for 14 shooting (yep, four deuces, seven three-pointers and a perfect 5 for 5 from the line).

Dirk has gathered up 29 double doubles and barely missed his first triple double. He has had a streak of seven 20 and 10 games in November, followed by a streak of eight 20 and 10 games. Tack on some 30 point nights, and hes averaging 25.1 points per game with 9.5 rebounds. He also has four games with at least 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists. That leads the league so far this year. (Kobe and LeBron have three each.) And, as usual, Dirks efficiency rating is very high27.7. Thats good enough for third in the league.

 
 Dirk grabs a rebound against the Kings during one of his 30/10/5 games 

Dallas is shooting a league-leading 81.6% from the free-throw line as well. Weve seen how important that can be in the nail-biter games.

Were just barely past halfway through the regular season. Its early yetconsidering that once theyve played the eight preseason games and 82 regular season games, one team must win another 16 of 28 possible games to get to the ultimate prize. But the Mavs have shown that they can lead from tip to buzzer. They can come back from double-digit deficits. They can nail down the defense in the fourth quarter to hang on. They can win in tough venues like Orlando, and L.A., in Phoenix, and San Antonio, and Miami. And usually, when one guy is off his game, anotheror a couple others step up.

 
 Defense is so important that the Mavs have added it to their warm up drills 

Were halfway through the season, and its been very entertaining so far. Lets go, Mavs!

 3. The December Review 
Coach Johnson evaluates the season in sets of 20 games. With 31 games in the books as of 1 January 2007, that puts us slightly more than halfway into the second quarter of the 2006-07 NBA season. So how are we doing?

As a team, Dallas ranks 14th in the league on overall offense and 11th on defense. Not bad, but as Avery says, were a work in progress. On the other hand, through our first 31 games, we have the Best Record in the NBA at 24 and 7!

Avery Johnson entered the record books as the fastest coach to win 100 games. Avery reached that milestone with a record of 100-31. The former leader was the legendary Celtics coach, Red Auerbach, who gained 100 wins with 35 losses.

And, for you trivia fans, how many other teams in the history of the NBA have run off two double-digit win streaks within 31 games?

 Dirk stats as of 1 January 2007: 
Fourteenth (14) in the league in points per game with 23.2
Sixth (6) in the league with 18 double doubles
Sixteenth (16) in rebounds with 9.4 per game
Fifth (5) in efficiency rating at 25.9
Thirty-fourth (34) in free-throw percentage with 89.9. (This stat is even more impressive when you realize that he made 204 of 227 attemptsthe 10th most trips to the line so far this season and the best average among those 10 players.)
Forty-second (42) in minutes played per game at 35.7
Twelfth (12) in Points/Rebounds/Assists with a 35.7 average
Western Conference Player of the Week for November 13-19

 
 Dirk leaps into a wide-open three 

 Other Mavs in the top 50 rankings. 
Erick Dampier is 4th in field goal percentage at 65.9
Damp is 35th with 1.23 blocks per game
He is 42nd in double doubles with 5

Josh Howard is 27th in 3 point percentage at 43.3
Josh is 34th in efficiency rating with 20.0
He is 38th in steals per game with 1.26
He is 40th in points/rebounds/assists with an average of 27.4
Josh was named Western Conference Player of the Week for December 18-24 and again for December 25-31.

Jason Terry is 31st in assists with 4.8 per game
The JET is 28th in 3 point percentage at and 43.0

Devin Harris is tied for 48th in steals per game with 1.19
Devin is 41st in assists with 4.2

Devean George is 45th in three-point percentage with 40.3
Diop is 24th in blocks with 1.48 per game
Austin Croshere and D.J. Mbenga are perfect at the free throw line with 5/5 and 4/4 respectively

 4. 2007: The Year of the Mavs? 
The NBA season still has a long way to go, but the Mavericks are working to make 2007 their best year ever. And what is Dirk doing personally to prepare for the ultimate goal?

 I never really look at personal goals in this league. I always want to accomplish team goals. I never go into the season saying, I want to be an All Star [or] I want to do this and this. I want to help my team win. Some nights that might be scoring. Some nights that might be getting 15 rebounds when your shots not there. I think over all its just more of what Ive been doing over the last couple years, and thats playing an all around game and helping my team hopefully not fall short again. 

Happy 2007 to Dirk fans and Mavericks fans all over the world. Lets help make it the Year of the Mavs!

 5. From Dlmen to Dallas Part II by Kirsten Bcker

Auf Deutsch (keine Fotos) klick hier 

 From Dlmen to Dallas 
After five weeks in Dallas, my conclusion is clear: Dallas is my favorite big city! Why would a small town girl say she likes a big city? Its simple: many nice people and many beautiful things to discover.

Even though as a country bumpkin I have always disliked multistory buildings, I like those in downtown Dallas because of their varied architecture. I recommend stopping at a corner to have a look around. The mixture of old and young is fascinating. The combination of the different styles and heights makes Dallas a treasure. In Germany such a composition of old and modern buildings at close quarters is hardly possible due to building regulations.

 
 The 106 year old Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe sits in the shadow of modern skyscrapers 

I could walk through Dallas Downtown for hours and would never become bored. I love the sculptures and parks that you discover only on foot. You can find nice parks, fountains, or sculptures in unexpected places.

Thanks to the straight streets, you will rarely lose your way. I had bought a city map, but I used it only on the day we visited the underground tunnels. These tunnels connect different buildings in downtown Dallas. In some you can find shops, taverns, and fast food restaurants. It was exciting not to know where I would return to earth. Once we returned to ground level in the Bank of America, Dallas tallest skyscraper!

 
 The underground tunnels connect downtown buildings including the Bank of America Tower and Fountain Place. 

Nearby, the West End places are cosy traditional. There you will find taverns and restaurants. Those who like to go out in the evenings will have fun there.

Even for those uninterested in art, I recommend the Dallas Museum of Art and Nasher Sculpture Center in the Dallas Arts District. You can reach downtown from the outlying districts using DART, the public transportation system. Compared to Germany, the price of transportation is very cheap. I dont know any German big city where you can use public transportation for only 2 EUR a day.

The friendliness of the people surprised me. When I asked for the way, everyone helped me kindly. You are addressed immediately when you enter a clothing store. The personnel have a lot of knowledge and find solutions for any problem. I have never found trousers that pleased and fit me that fast and uncomplicated. And compare the prices! Shopping brings joy (but consider the customs regulations)!

In Dallas you find most clothing stores in malls in the outlying districts rather than in the city center. I especially liked the Galleria and the Northpark Center. The Galleria has a skating rink in the center of the mall. The Northpark Center is built in a square with marble walls, different water fountains in the corners, and flowers and sculptures throughout the interior.

If you like flowers, garden plants, and sculptures, dont miss the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens. You will find everything from classical garden plants to sculpture gardens to herb gardens. And the Dallas Zoo is a must for everyone who likes animals. The enclosures are adapted to the natural environment of the animals.

No one should leave Texas without visiting Six Flags over Texas. I love rollercoasters, and if I feel comfortable with the safety precautions, they can do nearly anything to me. I would have never thought that a rollercoaster could frighten me. The Titan, the Texas Giant, and Batman were totally fun, but SupermanTower of Power was horror! If you want to experience a great ride, you should go there. Also, dont miss the bike tour with Spongebob. And if you have some money left, I recommend buying a Fast Pass to go to the head of the line.

During my stay in Dallas, the State Fair of Texas took place. The German translationn Kirmes or Jahrmarkt describes this gigantic event in no way. Beside the well-known rollercoaster and food traders, you can find large exhibitions about ranches and cars, a variety of shows, and lots of animals. Fair Park also has several museums, a park, and the Cotton Bowl Stadium.

I also experienced the American Halloween. I still prefer our traditional Aeppelkenn Poppaepelken and connect costumes to Mardi Gras, but Halloween in America is something different than in Germany. Americans celebrate Halloween with more planned activities and decorations.

 
 Pumpkins and fall flowers form Halloween decorations at the Dallas Arboretum 

Visitors to America cannot ignore the different cuisines. I personally was overwhelmed by the variety in the Wal-Mart. Compared to Germany; fruits are quite expensive, while chips and sweets are comparatively cheap. I ate cookies, brownies, and fast food a lot and tried everything (and discovered some new crazes). Nevertheless, during my five week vacation I didnt gain a pound. Perhaps it was the fat-free milk? Dont go to America on a diet, because the cookies, brownies, and other specialities (look at the ice creams) are worth ignoring the calories.

I want to say thanks to my friend Maren, who convinced me to make the trip and made it possible. Yes, Dallas is my favourite big city, and I look forward to visiting again soon.

 2. Dirkâ€˜s December Events 

14 December: Mavs Christmas party at Gameworks.

 3. November Highlights 
No matter how you slice it, Dirk and the Mavericks are off to a terrific start for the 2006-07 season. Oh sure, they had the four-game issue while they were still sorting out the new guys and gently working the returning players back into the games. But take a look at these statistics:

Through the runaway victory over the Kings on December 1, the Mavericks were 12 and 4better than their record to this point in 2005-06, when they were 11 and 5.

They have the second highest point differential in the league, scoring an average of 99.5 points per game while they held their opponents to 94.56a differential of +4.93 (San Antonio is first with 98.06 against 92.25 for a differential of +5.81.)

Theyre rebounding at a differential of +5.37 over their opponentsonly Utah and Cleveland are better.

Despite his early exit during the Toronto game and a couple other low-scoring games, Dirk leads the Mavericks overall and in several individual categories. He is first in
Minutes per game: 35.6
Free throw percentage: 92.4
Rebounds: 9.8 per game (Damp is second with 8.8)
Points per game: 24
Double doubles: 11 in his first 16 games. (He missed getting number 12 by one rebound against the Hornets.)

No wonder Dirk won his sixth Western Conference Player of the Week honor on November 20!

 
 Dirk springs into the 2006-07 season. 

Its great to be leading the Southwest Division of the Western Conference, but we are only a month into the new season. So now well see if December brings another dozen wins to put under the tree. Lets go, Mavs!

 4. From Dlmen to Dallas 
About a year ago, Kirsten Bcker of Dlmen, Germany found a friend in Dallas through the forum of 41fan.net. At her new friends urging, Kirsten decided to spend her vacation visiting Dallas. Next month shell tell you about Big D itself, and this month, you will see Mavericks events and the American Airlines Center through her eyes.

My first visit to the AAC took place on 10/08/06 for the Fan Jam. I did not have special expectations. Nevertheless, at first I was disappointed at how small the building looked from the outside. I thought the AAC was only slightly larger than our large gym at school. Since I was there early, I had the opportunity to walk around the building once and to have a look from all sides. It is not really small, but for me it was a miracle how so many people would fit in this building.

 
 The AAC (center with white roof) looks small in the shadow of the new Victory complex 

The front with the red brick and white/beige limestone is beautiful. The architecture plays with the contrast of straight lines and curves, and in the afternoon sun the building lights up. If you arrive early enough, you can see the players driving into the underground parking. Coming from Downtown, you cross a square with shining stars in the floor and water fountains that squirt up. Unfortunately, because of a construction area, I could never see it live. But just looking down at it from the AAC lets you suspect how it might look. Although the building is only six years old, it seems to me to be like one of those reconditioned industrial halls that you occasionally find in the German Ruhr district. For me, that gives it its own charm. If you leave the AAC after a game by train from the Victory Station you will have an unforgettable view of the illuminated AAC.

 
 The AAC in late afternoon 

Like in Germany each event at the AAC requires a security check at the entrances. But the personnel were substantially friendlier than in Germanylike everyone in the USA!

Once inside the building I immediately went to the big hall and had to sit down because of the height and depth. I dont know how deep they dug the building underground, but the outside gives you no concept of the size and capacity on the inside. I was so overwhelmed by its internal size that I could hardly follow the program. However, those few minutes I could follow the game were enough to make it clear that the players had great fun on the court. That definitely gave me a good feeling as a fan!

During much of the Fan Jam scrimmage game I was standing in line to get a cheeseburger basket, but now I am a proud owner of a Mavs souvenir cup. I can probably recommend the food at the AAC, despite its high prices. But get your food earlybefore the game; otherwise the ticket for the game is not worth the money.

After the scrimmage, some players threw their autographed shoes into the crowd. Dirk threw his shoe into my section, but I couldnt grab it because it was three rows low. I usually dont hunt for autographs, so for me it wasnt that bad (I hope Dirk wouldnt be mad at me); but I would have liked to have it for my friend, Maren. Purposefully, Dirk threw his last shoe to a little boy. He and his mom went crazy.

The seats in the AAC are arranged very well. Even in the highest rows you can see the whole court. In my opinion it makes hardly any difference whether you sit at the sideline or behind the basket. Even lower priced tickets are worth the money in any case! Do not hesitate to buy upper level tickets, unless you have a problem with heights! At the season opener a little boy in our row definitely had no head for heights. I felt sorry for him. Fortunately height is no problem for me. Because of the distance to the court you can hardly recognize all the players immediately. Due to the many new faces, I was thankful for the players list handed out at the entrance.

The Plexiglas safety railing was too low for my German feeling. The clear material makes it possible to look over the whole court. But when I stood next to the railing I felt a little weird because it didnt even reach to my hip. But that may be connected with my personal security needs.

 
 Even the top seats are good, but not for the faint-hearted 

For every fan the fan shop is surely a must. I was in the fan shop in the AAC as well as in the fan shop in the Northpark Center. Both shops have their own charm. The fan shop in the AAC offers a large selection of jerseys, T-Shirts, and other clothing. If you want a jersey or T-shirt, you should check the AAC shop. The fan shop in the Northpark Center has more little things such as magnets and bracelets that I didnt find in the AAC shop. In any case I recommend visiting both fan shops (because the Northpark Center is very beautiful and worth a visit itself).

For hardcore Mavs fans and AAC visitors it may sound simple, but I didnt know that there is a very nice restaurant on the lower level where you can look into the practice gym. Before they begin serving dinner or during and after the game, you can enter without charge. While dinner is served, you must be dining to enter. Imagine comfortably enjoying dinner (the buffet seems to be delicious) and watching the players. Being able to watch them on the practice court brought me much closer to the players than I had experienced in Germany so far. It makes you feel like you are almost a part of it!

In the walkways around the hall, escalators and elevators will take you to the different levels of the arena. When you want to go all the way to the top you use two long escalators. If you belong to the rich or lucky who have one of those private boxes, then its not so far; but you have to search for your escalator. The first time I was a little bit confused, but after we walked the public part of the AAC I was always successful in finding what I searched for.

Before the game you can walk around in the lower levels. First of all you can go there for autographs. I wouldnt have gone there at the season opener because too many people stood there. But at one of the preseason games I got a great place at the players entrance and got three autographs without feeling like an autograph hunter. I liked that very much. The fact you can walk around the lower levels before the game was fascinating because I havent known it from Germany. While attending a game in Hamburg I wanted to go talk to my friends who sat in another section. No chance! You can look nice and promise to be back at your seat at the beginning of the third quarter, but the attendants wont allow it.

Above the boxes in the ACC is a ring of illuminated advertising. During breaks and timeouts, they show advertising. During the game you can read what you should shout (Defense or Lets go Mavs) or how you should be: rowdy, proud and loud. When you sit in the lower levels you might not recognize the illuminated advertising, but from the upper levels you see it very well. Over the court there is a big screen showing the currents scores or similar messages as on the illuminated advertising. Occasionally there are some videos and funny cartoons with the players, coaches, and Mark Cuban. You shouldnt miss them. Interviews with the new players are shown before the game.

The most important thing in the AAC is definitely the atmosphere. The first surprise was the national anthem. I knew that in the U.S. Americans put their hands on their heartsbut no one sings a note. I felt sorry for the singer or musician. The national anthem is a special ceremony; however, everyone, in my opinion, stands alone. In Germany everyone sings loud whether he knows the words or not. Therefore everyone knows directly how strong the fan support will be. The tradition of the U.S. Americans opens new possibilities for the musical interpretation of the anthem (for example an individual saxophone). I always found it special to get a moment of silence prior to the game. I also liked having one of the players come out to the court and thank the fans for their support. Everyone had his own way and spoke his own wordsnot from a prepared text. That gives you a very good feeling as a fan.

During the game many persons and groups encourage the fans to be rowdy, proud and loud. One is the Mavs Hoop Troop, or like I called them initially, the Dr Pepper people (their shirts show the Dr Pepper emblem). Before the game they throw small balls in the crowd and you may try to throw them back into a small basket fastened on the back of one guy. The guy can adapt the height of the basket. During game breaks they shoot T-shirts in the crowd that come up amazingly farall the way to the top rows. Before a preseason game I had the opportunity to talk to them briefly. They tried to convince me that Josh Howard is my favorite player, instead of Dirk. They had a lot of arguments, but my German accent was sufficient to get me absolution as a real Dirk-Fan.

 
 The Dr Pepper Hoop Troop catches the ball from a fan in the stands. 

Then there are the Mavs Dancers and the ManiAACs. These two groups form the artistic range of the internal entertainment. The Mavs Dancers are young, beautiful women. However during the preseason games, I noticed that they did the same step routine to different songs. Surely I cant do it better, but for me they soon became uninteresting. The ManiAAcs have their own area under the boxes. Unfortunately I saw them dancing only once. I liked them very much. But at every game, they did a good job to get the fans roaring Lets go Mavs. They also have their own moves during free throws.

 
 Mavs Dancers and ManiAACs entertain the fans during a timeout. 

The musical part of the entertainment clusters along one of the corners of the AAC. A big mixer controls the sound, and a computer plays the music and sound effects. In the short side beside it the ManiAACs and the Drum Line have their spots. My absolute favorite part of the music is the drum line. The drummers are very good. Who doesnt feel the beat is cold as ice.

And dont forget Champ and Mavs Man! I usually dont like mascots so much, but both pulled me in. Next time I will try to get their autographs. In the breaks they sometimes shoot some shirts in the crowd in the upper levels, which provides a lot of excitement. When Mavs Man dunked from the trampoline, I was concerned about him and inspired when he hit the basket after jumping through a poster. But I like the mascots best when they walk on the court as big blown-up balloons. They do silly things and frighten those who sit in the front rows. At those times I became a child again and hopped enthusiastically on my seat. I assume in the costumes its a hard job, but theyre definitely cool!

 
 Inflatable Mavs Man delights the pregame fans. 

During the half-time break they have a show that changes each game. The Xtreme bikers of the season opener were very good, and other games have dogs that catch Frisbees, acrobats, and other novelty acts.

Now you see, there is a lot to discover in the AAC. Even games without dirk wouldnt become boring. I was a Dirk fan, when I came to Dallas; now I am a Mavs Fan (from the distance). I recommend going to the AAC to everybody who has the opportunity. It doesnt have to be one of the top games to have a cool game night with a lot of fun. Experience the friendliness of the personnel and all the fans; go early to get yourself something to drink and to eat; enjoy the program and the game!

 5. Frohe Weihnachten 
Dallas experienced its annual winter storm on 30 November this year. That was a little earlier than usual, but our flurries of ice and snow brought out the winter coats, so its beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

The holiday season in the U.S. begins early every year. Many people decorate for Halloween, then Thanksgiving, and by the end of November, you will see festive lights, yard displays, and Christmas trees all over town.

Some of Americas favorite Christmas traditions arrived in America with German immigrants. If you light candles in an advent wreath, you have an Adventskranz. 

Does Santa Claus deliver to your house? Santa is Saint Nicholas, who fills good German childrens shoes or boots (rather than stockings) with candy and treats. In Germany, Saint Nicholas comes on 6 December, which gives him a little more time to visit good children in the U.S. on Christmas Eve.

 
 In the U.S., stockings are hung by the chimney with care. 

Some American children enjoy another German traditionthe Advent Calendar. From December 1-24, children count down the days to Christmas by opening a numbered door each day to find a chocolate or other treat.

 
 Open a door each day for a sweet Advent treat. 

Do you sing Silent Night? Here are two verses with the original and the English words:

 Stille Nacht: 
Words: Joseph Mohr (1792-1848)
Music: Franz Gruber (1787-1863)

Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht, (Silent night, holy night,)
Alles schlft, einsam wacht (All is calm, all is bright.)
Nur das traute, hochheilige Paar, (Round yon infant)
Holder Knabe im lockigen Haar (Tender and mild)
Schlaf in himmlischer Ruh, (Sleep in heavenly peace.)
Schlaf in himmlischer Ruh. (Sleep in heavenly peace.)

Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht, (Silent night, holy night,)
Gottes Sohn, o wie lacht (Son of God, loves pure light.)
Lieb aus deinem gttlichen Mund, (Radiant beams from thy holy face)
Da uns schlgt die rettende Stund, (With the dawn of redeeming grace.)
Christ, in Deiner Geburt, (Jesus, Lord at thy birth.)
Christ, in Deiner Geburt! (Jesus, Lord at they birth.)

The tradition of the Christmas tree ( der Tannenbaum , also called der Christbaum or der Weihnachtsbaum ) comes from Germany. Christmas trees first appeared in German homes in the early 1600s, decorated with paper roses, fruit, nuts, ornaments, candies, and eventually candles.

 
 German immigrants brought their tradition of decorated Christmas trees to America. 

 Dirks Christmas 
Dirk has been celebrating Christmas in the United States now for eight years. What are his favorite traditions from growing up, and what is he looking forward to for Christmas 2006?

We celebrate it a little differently. We have Christmas Eve. Its a big thing. We would get up in the morning excited already, but we couldnt go in the main living room because thats where the tree is. We couldnt see the tree before, with all the gifts underneath it. Then at night we would eat; it really doesnt matter what. At eight or nine we would open up the presents and just hang out with the family. And then on the 25th, we would have a huge family dinner with everybodycousins and aunts, grandmothers and grandfatherswhoever was available.

Since a couple years now, my family has been coming over, visiting here. Sometimes we celebrate on the 25th, sometimes the 24th; it kind of depends on what the [game] schedule is.

We try to do the same things, exchange a couple gifts, but I dont think its all about the gifts now. Now that were older its more about the value of the time you spend together, the stories you share from when we were young. Every time theyre funny, obviously. We have a new member at Christmas this year with [Dirks one-year old nephew] Lenny. Hes starting to walk now, so its going to be exciting to have him here.

My parents will be here the 22nd. Silke and Roli a little earlier. Well get a tree, and Ill let them do all their decorating. And then Ill play basketball.

Yes, its beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

 3. 2006 Preseason Wrap Up 
Wasnt it just the other day the Mavericks were headed to Denton to begin training camp? Now the preseason is behind us and another exciting season stretches ahead. As we get ready to root the Mavs on to another Championship run, lets wrap up the preseason and see what weve learned.

 Good news: 
Avery, Dirk, Josh, and JET all have signed new contracts or extensions (along with D.J. and the new guys).
Del Harris is back as Averys top assistant. Joe Prunty also returns, along with Sam Vincent, who led the Ft. Worth Flyers to last years D-League Championship game.
Several of our new players come with extensive playoff experienceincluding trips to the finals (Devean George, Austin Croshere, and Anthony Johnson).
We have lots of options at guard with Jason Terry, Devin Harris, Anthony Johnson, and Maurice Ager, plus our swingmenStack, Josh, Buckner, and George.
We have Austin Croshere and Pops Mensah-Bonsu behind Dirk (and our swingmen).
The 5 position looks strong with D.J. and Gana trading minutes with Damp, who is coming off a very strong preseason camp (despite falling on his hip during a practice).
We are a smart, tight, talented team who can play small ball, tall ball, inside and outside, offense and defense, transition and half court. (And youve probably read about the fines for missing questions on the playbook tests.)

Despite keeping the core of last years team together, Avery and the rest of the coaching staff had quite a few new players to evaluate last month. This years line up includes new veterans: Austin Croshere, Anthony Johnson, and Devean George; rookies: Maurice Ager and Pops Mensah-Bonsu; and four free agents vying for the number 15 roster spot: Jose Juan Barea, Darius Washington, Ndudi Ebi, and Pat Carroll.

With Dirk resting after having played with the German National Team during the World Championships, and a variety of (hopefully minor) injuries requiring extra care for several of the other players, the Mavericks didnt put all 15 players in uniform for any of the eight preseason games. That gave the coaches opportunities to see the new guys in action. Pat Carroll and Darius Washington made early exits, leaving the final roster position open for J.J. Barea or Ndudi Ebi. In the end, Barea got the nod. J.J. takes the floor with an energy level reminiscent of Darrell Armstrong. He averaged 18 minutes in the seven games he played (DNP against San Antonio) with 3.3 assists per game, 16 total rebounds, and a 93.8 free throw percentage. Of the returning core team, only DeSagana Diop played in all eight games, joined by rookie Maurice Ager and veteran forward, Austin Croshere.

 
 Dirk offers encouragement during a timeout against the Rockets. 

The Mavs were 2 and 2 at home and 1 and 3 on the road. Interestingly, the one road win came against Cleveland in Pittsburgh, Mark Cubans hometown. The Cavs were the home team, but the Mavs came away with an 83-81 victory. Dirk led all scorers with 17 points in 30 minutes of play. LeBron followed with 14 points in his 27 minutes on the court.

The Mavericks most exciting home preseason game came against the Washington Wizards. With five and a half minutes to go, we had Maurice Ager, J.J. Barea, Ndudi Ebi, Austin Croshere, and D.J. Mbenga on the floor. Down by 13, the Mavs went on a phenomenal 17-1 run. With Barea at the point, good passes, driving layups, jumpers, hook shots, and free throws came from everyone in a white uniform. In a rare preseason occurrence, the fans got to their feet, clapped, shouted, and urged the Mavs on to the 93-90 victory. The rest of the guys in white were also on their feet in front of the Mavs bench.

 
 Dirk shows a little of his own wizardry. 

Whats ahead for the defending 2005-06 Western Conference Champions? Well, its a long road to April. The media and the fans have high hopes and great expectations. Players and coaches are memorizing the playbook, working hard in practice, and getting ready for another great season. The team and the fans are hungry! The 2006-2007 NBA season is underway!

 4. Off and Running 

Posters and blinking pompoms in the seats: Check
Fireworks shooting from giant basketballs during the Mavs introductions. Check
Marv Albert and Steve Kerr courtside to call the TV coverage. Check.
We picked up right where we left off last June.

Parking was terrible, and the tipoff was early, so many of the fans arrived fashionably late. But the Mavericks opened the season with some incredible shooting and the intensity that always seems to accompany a game against the Spurs.

 
 The Mavs and Spurs tip off their 2006-2007 season. 

And, if you werent a die-hard Mavs fan, you would have found it to be a very entertaining game all the way to the end. Nearly everyone contributed. The Mavs had four players in double figures. Anthony Johnson and Austin Croshere made their debuts as Mavs. On the Spurs side, Duncan was a little off his standard, but Tony Parker showed no signs of the reported ankle sprain; Ginobili was his usual darting, scoring self; Horry and Bowen and Finley were prowling the perimeter.

Oberto got the starting call against Dirk. The Spurs also tried to stop Dirk with Francisco Elson (acquired from Denver), Tony Parker (Tony Parker?) and some double teams from Tim Duncan.

 
 How many NBA players does it take to get a rebound? 

No matter who or how many tried to guard him, Dirk got things rolling with his first double-double of the season. He pulled down 11 rebounds and scored 21 points in 35 minutes of play. He shot 9 for 20 from the field (two for four from behind the arc) and added another point from the free throw line. Excuse me? you say. He had ONE free throw? Well, no. He had two free throws and made one of them. When is the last time Dirk had more personal fouls (five) than trips to the line?

 
 Oberto gives Tony his Dirk-defending responsibilities. 

Those fouls hurt our cause in the final quarter. Although Austin Croshere had a terrific debut in a Mavs uniform (12 points in 15:28 minutes with two of three from 3-point range and five of nine overall), having Dirk, JET, and Devin on the bench with five fouls each cost us a lot of offense during that six and a half minute stretch where the scoreboard seemed frozen at 75.

 
 Dirk demonstrates the latest weapon for rebound wars: four arms! 

In the end, our free throws may have been the difference. San Antonio scored 25 in 37 attempts. We went to the line only 16 times and made 10. Six points. Hmmm. It was a tough loss for a winnable game, but the Mavs are back. The 2006-2007 season is off and running.

Laura is our October Fan of the Month. She is 6 years old and lives in Georgsmarienhutte in Germany. She plays basketball and is &quot;...the greatest Dirk Nowitzki fan in Germany.&quot; She even sleeps in her Nowitzki Mavsgear!

For her first day of school, her father prepared a very cool Dirk Nowitzki &quot;Schultute&quot; for her with a basketball backboard on its top. (A Schultute is a large cornet of cardboard filled with sweets and little presents given to children in Germany on their first day at school.) Her father said &quot;I think this is the only Dirk Nowitzki-Schultute on the world.&quot;

 3. Get Ready for the New Season! 
On 26 September, the Mavericks hosted 200 women of all ages for its sixth annual NBA 101 for Women. On 30 September - 1 October, the players underwent the most extensive physicals in the NBA. New Dancers and ManiAACs are on the squads, singers and instrumentalists have auditioned for the National Anthem, the media got its first chance to grill coaches and players 2 October, and the 2006-07 Mavs Preseason Camp is underway at the University of North Texas.

 
 Devin and Gana pull the winning tickets at NBA 101 for Women 

If you compare NBA camp to something like baseballs six-week Spring Training, it seems very short. After all, camp is only three days, followed by a fourth day shoot around and scrimmage for the UNT students and faculty. Then the Mavs will play another scrimmage in their annual Blue and White game during the Fan Jam on 8 October. Barely more than a week after they begin camp, the first preseason game tips off in Oklahoma City. How can they be ready to play so quickly?

The reason that they can have such a short preparation is that they really never stop. Many of the younger players played summer league ball through the third week of July. And younger players and some veterans were back in Dallas working with the Mavericks staff (Conditioning Coach, Robert Hackett and Head Trainer, Casey Smith) beginning 8 August. Others continued to work out at their home towns, and Dirk spent his summer with Holger and the German National Team.

The players dont come to camp to get into shape. When they begin camp, theyâ€˜re ready to work with Avery and the coaching staff on this years playbook, and they want to start building chemistry with this years new roster players. So what must they be able to do when camp begins?

Coach Hackett has a series of tests they must pass before they can play. One of the tests is the shuttle run. Each player must run the length of the court 10 times within a prescribed time. For centers, its usually 60 seconds. If the player is a good runner, its faster: D.J. Mbenga must complete it in 57 seconds. For forwards, the time to beat is 58 seconds. And the smaller, faster guards must average no more than 56 seconds. Again, the speedy guys have lower marks. Josh, JT, and Devin must beat 54 seconds. They complete the shuttle run, rest two minutes, and run it again. The average of both runs must beat the target time, or they must run it againevery day until they pass.

They also do vertical jumps and back vertical jumps to test leg strength, a bench press test for upper body strength, and an agility test to check ability to accelerate, decelerate, and change direction. The agility test determines which players are most capable of dropping into a double team and quickly getting back across the court to their regular positions.

Basketball is a high energy sport filled with bursts of speed and constant activity. Therefore the players must come to camp physically fit and work hard to maintain their fitness no matter how many minutes they play in each game. Consequently, before camp and throughout the season they train for endurance. For example, a rotation of leg exercises may consist of 40 leg presses, 40 bear squats, 40 squats, 40 jumps, 40 leg extensions, and 40 leg curls. Thats one set. With his high minutes in most games, Dirk may do one set of each rotation two days a week. Players with low or no minutes will do multiple sets four days a week in addition to running.

 
 Averys recipe for Victory 

So, the guys are back. Theyve added some bigger, stronger, wider, longer, new, and experienced players to our Western Conference Champion core team. Theyve got new chairs in their locker room, new basketballs on the court, a new perspective, and a new chance at bringing home the OBrien Trophy. Lets get it started!

 4. A Day in the Life....&quot; 
On Media Day, the Mavericks host reporters, photographers, interviewers, and video crews from all the local print newspapers, radio, and television stations. The national media come as well. Walking through the lower level of the American Airlines Center means rubbing elbows with recognizable names and faces. But be careful not to trip as youâ€˜re stepping through a miniature forest of camera tripods facing backdrops of all sizes and shapes in black, white, silver, blue, and green.

 
 Dirk on the set for some future TV video 

For the Mavs, Media Day is an opportunity to showcase the new team and build some excitement for the coming season. For the media and the marketing department, its a chance to set up stations where they can get photographs, interviews, and video that will appear throughout the year on hundreds of posters, programs, advertisements, billboards, videos, endorsements, community service announcements, and arena videos like the Avery Bunch or Taco Bueno.

Dirk, not surprisingly, has a list with more stations than any other player on the team. So for more than three hours, he moves from station to station inside the practice court, and from room to room to room in the lower levels of the AAC. His stops include photographs, videos, promos, a press conference, and several one-on-one videotaped interviews.

 
 Dirk and Tiffany check his station list 

The moment he comes down the locker room stairs, the atmosphere in the gym changes. People greet him and welcome him back as the Mavs Manager of Player Relations directs him to each place on her full-page list. Those he knows get smiles and various forms of handshakes or hugs. These encounters are brief, but never rushed. At every station he quickly finds his spot and centers his attention on the instructions for each pose. When theyâ€˜re finished, he thanks the crew and moves on through the crowd. Everyone has a comment or a question for him.

How was your summer?
 Short! 

You look thinner.
 Yeah, I lost about five pounds. 

From across the gym, Jason Terry yells, Here comes the German stud! and everyone laughs.

 
 JT, Dirk, and Josh form a formidable trio for this years Mavs 

At video stops, Dirk listens carefully to instructions, immediately clarifying anything thatâ€˜s unclear, hits his marks and says his lines. Much like his free throw percentage, he completes at least 90% of them on the first try.

During the press conference and interviews, he fields several variations of the same questions. Each time, Dirk gives the question his full consideration, answering it as though it were the first time anyone has ever asked.

 
 Dirk holds his first 2006-07 season press conference 

And what about some answers to a few one-of-a-kind questions?

Dirks first dunk.
 It was in the back yard when I was about 14 or 15. I ran up to tell my parents. They acted excited, but I dont really think they thought it was that big. 

Could being on the cover of NBA Live be a jinx?
 Well, Dwyane Wade was on the cover last year, and he won the Championship. 

How about his feelings toward Nellie?
 Not too many coaches will let a seven footer dribble up the court and shoot from anywhere. 

On his experience last summer playing in China.
 The Chinese were amazing. They knew all my stats. They really knew a lot about basketball. And they treated me like a rock star every time I walked through the hotel. 

Do you ever get used to that?
 No! 

As the day wears on, Dirk strikes both silly and serious poses, teases his team mates between sessions, puts on a headset and joins a live segment for a radio show, and hits his lines every time. Along the way, he stops to greet a young teenage boy, talks to him for a minute or two, and leaves him speechless with a trademark Dirk head ruffle as he moves on.

 
 Dirk and Mark: Looking forward to another run for the ring. 

Dirk is on for the media for more than three hours, stopping only when its too late to do anything more before dressing for Averys team dinner. Hes nowhere near crossing off every stop on his list of stations. He will tell you he hates this part of the job. But he is gracious, cooperative, and intent on getting it right. He may prefer game days to media days, but he brings the same work ethicand the same star powerto both.

Its just another day in the life of Dirk Nowitzki.

 2. FIBA and NBA rules 

 Is it time for the NBA and FIBA to adopt the same rules? 

On the pitch, soccer is Fuball is futbol. Wherever you play at the professional level, every side plays by FIFA rules. Im not quite sure how Mr. Naismiths original 13 rules evolved into both FIBA and the NBA, but the 2006 World Championships show fundamental differences between international basketball and NBA basketball. Here are a few of the big ones.

 The Court 
First, we have the differences on the court itself. The NBA court is 94 feet long and 50 feet wide (28.65 x 15.24 meters). The FIBA court is 91 feet, 10 inches by 49 feet, 2.5 inches or 28 x 15 meters. The FIBA court is a couple feet shortermostly a factor of conversion between feet and meters.

The lane is significantly different from FIBA to NBA. Rather than the 16 foot (4.88 m) width of the NBA rectangle, FIBA creates a trapezoid that is 12 feet wide (3.6 m) at the free throw line and angles out to 19 feet 8.25 inches (6 m) at the baseline. Gives a new perspective to the low post game, huh?

And finally, the FIBA three-point arc is 20 feet 6.25 inches (6.25 m) while the NBA arc is 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) until it parallels the baselines at 22 feet (6.7 m).

 

 FIBA 

 

 NBA 

 The Time 

FIBA plays four quarters, each 10 minutes long. NBA plays four quarters, each 12 minutes long. Overtime is five minutes in both. Calling a time out is quite different. In FIBA, each team has one time out per quarter in the first, second, and third quarter, with an extra one in the fourth quarter (two total), and one per overtime period. The coach calls all time-outs through the scorers table, and each must last 60 seconds. (No phantom TOs by Josh Howard could happen under FIBA rules.) Timeouts do not accumulate. If the coach doesnt call one, the team loses the timeout for that quarter.

The NBA has six timeouts per regulation time plus three for each overtime period Regular timeouts are 60 seconds in duration, except for the first two timeouts in each period and the extra mandatory timeouts in the second and fourth quarters, which are 100 seconds. (Think TV commercials.) Each team has one 20-second timeout per half. During the final two minutes of regulation, each team can use a maximum of one 60-second and one 20-second timeout. Effective the coming season, no time outs will carry over into overtime.

 Fouls 

FIBA rules allow five fouls (personal plus technical) before disqualification. Any contact with a player, whether during play or while the ball is dead, is a personal foul. In the NBA, players may receive six personal fouls or two technical fouls before disqualification, and fouls during a dead ball period are technical fouls. Under FIBA rules you will see more zone defense and less contact during man-to-man defense.
Under FIBA rules, the penalty (two shots) occurs on any team foul after the fourth of each quarter (i.e. on the fifth) unless the foul is an offensive foul. Overtime is an extension of the fourth quarter. Team fouls include all personal fouls and technical fouls called against a player.
In the NBA, the penalty begins on the fifth team foul in each quarter (or the fourth in OT), or on the second foul in the last two minutes, if that comes first. Team fouls include personal fouls by defensive players and any loose ball fouls. Offensive fouls and technical fouls are not counted as team fouls.

 Goaltending 

In FIBA, once the ball touches the rim, it is open season. Any player may swipe the ball off the rim or tap it in. In the NBA, as long as the ball is inside the cylinder above the rim, no player may touch it. If a defensive player touches it, it becomes a basket for the offensive team. If the offensive player touches it, no points are awarded and possession transfers to the defensive team.

These are a few of the biggest differences between NBA and international play. With many international players coming to the NBA, we have to wonder how much better the game would become for fans and players alike if both organizations adopted the same rules. Maybe its time for us to generate a grassroots campaign to petition both FIBA and NBA officials to get together and create one set of rules.

 3. Mavs Moves 

Mavs training camp is less than a month away, and it wont be long before they tip it off against the Spurs in the November home opener. While we wait for the team to prepare for another great season, lets get ourselves prepared for the team were going to see.

Maurice was a second team All Big Ten guard as a senior, averaging 19.3 points. He also brings a perimeter scoring threat, having made 202 long shots during his four year collegiate career. He brings a strong transition game plus the ability to slash to the basket or shoot from downtown. During the 2006 summer league, Maurice averaged 16.9 points with 43 percent shooting.

Austin Croshere
Forward: 610 (2,08) 235 lbs (106,6). Traded from Indiana for Marquis Daniels.

Swingman: 64 (1,93) 210 lbs (93,0) Signed as a free agent from Denver.
The Mavericks drafted Buckner in the second round of the 1998 NBA draft and played three seasons for the Mavericks. He spent two seasons in Philadelphia, and played the past two with Denver. His career stats include a 46.5% field goal average, with 35% from behind the arc, and 74.7% from the free-throw line.

Coach Sam Vincent
Coach Vincent takes Rolando Blackmans spot as Ro moves into a front office job with the Mavs. Last year, Coach Vincent was the head coach of the NBDL Fort Worth Flyers and led them to the leagues best record and the runner-up spot in the championship game. He was a seven-year NBA player and has an NBA Championship with the Celtics.

 Whos hoping to make the roster 
The Mavericks have invited four free agents to training camp next month to try to fill the one remaining roster spot:

Ndudi Ebi is a 22 year old, 69 forward who played last year for Fort Worth in the National Developmental League. In 2003, Ebi was a high school player drafted 23rd by Minnesota.

Pat Carroll is a 23 year old swingman, 65 (1,96) who is the younger brother of Charlottes Matt Carroll.

Darius Washington is 20 years old, a 62 (1,88) guard who started two years for the University of Memphis

Juan Jose Barea, 22 years old, is a 60 (1,83) guard who scored 2,290 career points for Northeastern and has played for Puerto Rico at the Global Games.

 Whats changed 
 The ball: 
For the first time in 35 years, the NBA will change the official game ball. The Spalding ball has a new design with two interlocking cross-shaped panels and a new microfiber composite material replacing the former eight oblong panels and leather material. The league believes the new design will improve the grip, manage moisture, and eliminate the need for a break-in period. The ball has been through extensive testing in labs and on the court. Each team has used the ball in practices. The ball also appeared in the NBA Development League and during activities of the NBA All-Star 2006 last February in Houston. Commissioner Stern calls it, the best basketball in the world. Dirk calls it sticky.

 The playoff seeding 
Beginning in 2006-07, the top four seeds of the playoffs will go to the three division winners in each conference and the team with the next best record. All four teams will seed by their regular season win-loss records. How might that have looked this year?

1 San Antonio (63/19) vs. 8 Sacramento (44/38)
2 Dallas (60/22) vs. 7 LA Lakers (45/37)
3 Phoenix (54/28) vs. 6 LA Clippers (47/35)
4 Denver (44/38) vs. 5 Memphis (49/33)

 The playoff rosters 
Playoff teams may use their entire 15-man roster, designating 12 players for each game as they do during the regular season.

 The timeouts 
For the coming year, the final two minutes of a game will have a maximum of one 60-second timeout and one 20-second timeout. An overtime period will have two 60-second timeouts plus a 20. No timeouts can carry over from the second half into an overtime.

 Cultural Exchange: JapanHosts of the 2006 FIBA World Championships 

Japan hosts the 2006 World Championships 19 August through 3 September. Four cities will see the preliminary rounds, including Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka; Sendai City, Miyagi; Sapporo City, Hokkaido; and Hiroshima City, Hiroshima. Following the preliminaries, the sweet sixteen, quarters, semis, and finals will take place in Saitama City, Saitama.

Saitama City is the capital of the Saitama Prefecture. It formed in 2001 with the unification of three former cities and is a strategic crossroads for eastern Japan. It is the ninth largest city in Japan, with 1.18 million people. The city has built its philosophy on working together to conserve nature and treasure children.

For things to do between games, youll find that Saitama City is home to the John Lennon Museum. Wander through its nine exhibit zones for videos, information, and memorabilia about the musician, artist, and peace activist. Many items on display come from Yoko Onos private collection.

Then, when the basketball games begin, you will enjoy the action in a very special venue.

 

 Saitama Super Arena 

Saitama City has one of the most innovative arenas in the world. The Saitama Super Arena mechanically transforms into a variety of layouts and seating arrangements to enable it to comfortably handle trade fairs, small concerts or shows, and large athletic events. It can also simultaneously handle a live event with adjacent warm up courts or community areas. Depending on the configuration, the arena can accommodate 12,500 to 37,000 people.

For the World Championships, the format will seat between 19,000 and 22,500.

 Hiroshima 
To earn its trip to Saitama, the German team begins its quest to the World Championship in Hiroshima. More than 1.1 million people live and work in this principal city of the Chugoku-Shikoku region. Hiroshima traces its origins to Tensho 17 (1589 A.D.), when Terumoto Mori began building a castle at the mouth of the Ota River. Hiroshimaâ€˜s location in the midst of the Chugoku Mountain Range, six rivers, and the Seto Inland Sea links the city and its people closely to nature. Hiroshima is often called the City of Water. It is a major manufacturing city and home of the Mazda Motor Company. If you own a Mazda MX-5/Miata, RX-8, or CX-7, chances are good that it was built in Hiroshima.

Since its destruction by the first atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima has devoted itself to becoming a city of peace at every levelamong people, between people and nature, and through international relations. That is exactly what it will be doing during the next few weekswelcoming people and teams from around the world to enjoy this beautiful city and cheer their national basketball teams to victory.

 2. The Dirk Nowitzki Foundation: A mission to help provide education, health, and well-being to children around the world 

The Dirk Nowitzki Foundation (DNF) was founded in October 2001 for the purpose of helping children. Annually since its inception, DNF has donated toward organizations serving children in the United States, Europe, and Africa. Each year the Board of Directors meets in December to review applicants and worthy organizations.

 2003 
Beneficiaries of DNF grants include a major grant in 2003 to the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation to help fund the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa.

 

 Dirk contributes toward the Mutombo Hospital 

 2004 
The Foundation made three major grants. The recipients included the Make A Wish Foundation, which grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions; the Childrens Cancer Fund for research to fight this deadly disease; and the Rise School of Dallas to sponsor their benefit run. The Rise School of Dallas is a special school for developmentally challenged toddlers with disabilities such as Down Syndrome. The not-for-profit school uses proven methods developed by the University of Alabama to help children develop intellectually and socially.

 2005 
The Dirk Nowitzki Foundation granted three more major awards. Once again, DNF supported the Childrens Cancer Fund and the Make A Wish Foundation. A new recipient for 2005 was Vogel Alcove, a childcare facility for the homeless created by the Dallas Jewish Coalition for the Homeless. The Vogel Alcove provides free childcare for more than 100 homeless children each day.

 More support 
In addition to these charities, the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation supports Brot&amp;Bcher (Bread and Books), an organization that provides funding for teachers and food in third-world countries, along with any necessary housing for the students or the teachers.

Dirk gets personally involved in many of the organizations he sponsors. He donates autographed game-worn shoes to Operation Sneaker to auction for funds that benefit third world nations. He serves as a spokesman for the Red Disk Shoe Campaign to raise funds for the Childrens Cancer Fund.
Every time Dirk makes a three-point basket, he and Bobs Steak and Chop House (a restaurant in Dallas) match funds for Jonathans Place. Jonathans Place is a licensed foster group home in Texas that provides emergency residential care services to abused, abandoned, and neglected children.

 Dirks time contributions 
For Dirk, Its not just giving money. Both at home and on the road, Dirk grants wishes to seriously ill children for the Make A Wish Foundation. Dirk prefers to meet with these children without media coverage. He also makes private visits to children at Scottish Rite Hospital and Childrens Medical Center in Dallas.
After the 9/11 attacks, the majority of charitable contributions went to organizations assisting the families and recovery efforts in New York and Washington, D.C. As a result, the donations to the North Texas Food Bank declined. Dirk and Michael Finley teamed up to support the local needy, and Dirk has continued to lead the effort since Mike headed south to San Antonio last year. In this program, Dirk and other Mavericks donate their time to cook and serve at local homeless shelters and sponsor donations to the North Texas Food Bank.
Other children in North Texas also benefit from Dirks desire to help children learn and grow. Several times each school year, he and other Mavericks players visit local schools in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to promote reading challenges in the Fight for Literacy. From speaking at school assemblies, to high-fiving the participants at Mavericks summer Hoop Camps, to reading with a child in his lap, you will find Dirk working with children.
You can help Dirk in his mission to provide education, health, and well-being to children around the world by donating to the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation or by purchasing the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation Calendar. New, autographed, limited edition calendars are available each year. The Dirk Nowitzki Foundation is a 501(c)3 organization. All donations are tax deductible, and 100% of your donations go to charity.

You can also contribute to DNF by purchasing merchandise from the 41 shop at http://www.41shop.net/. A portion of each purchase benefits the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation.

 3. Season Review 

 

 We made it to the Finals! 

The 2005-06 season was almost everything the team and the fans could have dreamed or imagined. We may still be reeling from the results of those last four games, but we should also take a look at some of the accomplishments of this incredible team.

The 2005-06 Mavericks entered the preseason as a team the media picked no better than fifth in the Western Conference. They ran off a 6-2 preseason stringlosing only to the L.A. Clippers. The regular season began 1 November in Phoenix, where the Mavs avenged their 2005 playoff losses by roaring back from 17 down in the fourth quarter to take the game to overtime. The Mavericks prevailed in the second OT with a 111-108 victory. Dirk scored 28 points and grabbed 15 rebounds.

San Antonio came to town for the first home game of the season, and the Mavs gave them a foreshadowing of things to come as well. With 34 points from Dirk, the Mavericks beat their big brother Spurs 103-84.

Detroit was the next contender to feel the Mavericks power. The Pistons hummed into Dallas with an 8-0 record. They left on the wrong end of 119-82 final score.

The Mavericks won 10 or more games in November, December, January, and February. Along they way, they put together a string of 13 consecutive victories (one short of the franchise record set in 2002). The victims of the win number 13? The Miami Heat, who suffered their worst loss of the season at 112-76.

February also brought the All Star weekend. Although Dirk was the only Mavs player in the All Star Game, Avery coached the West team. Del Harris coached the victorious West Sophomore team, with Devin Harris on the roster. Jason Terry and Dirk represented the Mavericks in the three-point shooting contest.

March brought a tough schedule, but the sixth consecutive season of at least 50 victories. The Mavs notched number 50 at the expense of LeBron James and the Cavaliers.

In April, the Mavs evened their record against the Spurs with a crucial win in San Antonio. DeSagana Diop made the first three-pointer of his NBA career in the fourth quarter of the final game to keep the Mavericks streak alive at 610 consecutive games with at least one three-point goal.

After starting all of the previous 81 games, Dirk sat out the final game of the season to rest and to receive the award for the FIBA European Player of the Year.

Avery added Coach of the Year honors to his April 05 and January 06 Western Conference Coach of the Month awards. And despite 17 different starting lineups and 199 man games missed because of injuries or suspensions, the Mavericks tied their franchise season record with 60 victories against 22 defeats.

 The Playoffs 
During the post season, the Mavericks added these honors:
- First ever sweep in a seven-game series (First Round against the Grizzlies)
- First ever series win against the San Antonio Spurs (Second Round)
- First ever Western Conference Championship
- First ever trip to the NBA Finals
- Two 4-point plays in a single game (the seventh and eighth four-point plays in NBA history)

 Honors and Nowitz-tistics 
Lets look at some of Dirks individual accomplishments:
- Fifth consecutive All Star appearance (2002-2006)
- First Three-point Championship
- All NBA First Team (second consecutive year; six-time All NBA total)
- Third in voting for League MVP
- 205 made free throws in the playoffs (previous record holder was Michael Jordan with 183)
- Most points in a playoff game (50 against Phoenix in game 4)
- One of only three players in NBA history to average at least 26 points and at least 90% success from the free throw line (Rick Barry and Larry Bird)
- One of only five players to average at least 25 points and 10 rebounds per game throughout the playoffs (Bob Petit, Elgin Baylor, Shaquille ONeal, Hakeem Olajuwon)

 Regular season 
- Fourth in the NBA in free throw percentage: 90.1%
- Sixth in efficiency: 27.4 (Efficiency = games played, minutes played, points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks)
- Seventh in points per game: 26.6
- Seventh in average of points + rebounds + assists: 38.3
- Eighth in double doubles: 35 (10 or more points and 10 or more rebounds in the same game)

 Playoffs 
- 620 points (average 27 per game)
- 268 rebounds (11.7 per game)
- 67 assists (2.9 per game)
- Second in efficiency rating at 30.35 (Elton Brand first with 30.75 over 12 games)
- First in double doubles with 14 in 23 games

 

 Heartfelt thanks to Dirk and all the Mavs for a great season! 

Despite the last four games, 2005-2006 was an incredible season for the Dallas Mavericks and their fans. Now, we have Maurice Ager in the fold, Jason Terry and D.J. Mbenga ready to sign new contracts, and contract extensions waiting for Josh Howard and Dirk. Well soon see where the free agents land. Next its the World Championships in Japan. And then, before we know it, October will roll around again and well be ready for another great season of Mavericks basketball.

 2. Western Conference Champions 

 

 Its a beautiful day for a Championship 

 Round 2: The Semifinals 

Due to the playoff seeding rules for 2006, the Mavericks moved into what many thought would be the faux conference finals in the second round. Ultimately, it didnt matter to the Mavs when they faced the defending champions; everyone knew the road to the finals went through San Antonio.

And what a series it was! Filled with analogies of two heavy weight fighters slugging it out night after night, The Mavericks and the Spurs gave us a series with more drama than even TNT could have scripted.

It all started in the Hill Country with a game Dallas all but stole. Bowens bear-hug defense held Dirk to 20 points and 14 rebounds (to Duncans 31/13), but the Spurs took the lead with 2:14 left to play and pulled out the 87-85 victory.

In Game 2, the Mavericks came out flexing their muscles and showing their speed. Five Mavs scored in double figures, with Josh Howard pouring in 27 to lead the way. Dirk added 21, Stackhouse had 19, and Devin Harris provided the speedy secret ingredient for victory with 20 points of his own. The result: Mavs 113, Spurs 91.


 

 Dirk plans his move 

Game 3 brought the series to Dallas. And Devin brought his speed again. Devin out-Parkered Parker for 24 points and the deflection that sent Ginobili scrambling after a ball that rolled out of bounds with 2.5 seconds to play. And Dirk? Well, he had 15 rebounds and 27 points on 9 shots, with 21 of 24 free throws. This was the game where he severely rolled his ankle stepping on Duncans foot, but gamely continued, nailing the resulting free throws as Duncan fouled out, along with the game winning free throws with 7.9 seconds on the clock. Mavs 104, Spurs 103.

Game 4 provided another nail biter. Jason Terry lit up the court for 32, and Devin and Stack added 18 and 26 of their own. Dirk, vowing that the only way he would not play was if he lost the injured leg, had treatments throughout the night and off day, then proceeded to put up 28 points in a thriller that had the record crowd at maximum decibels. Michael Finley nearly silenced the fans with a 3-pointer to take the lead with 15 seconds left, but 7 seconds later Dirk tied the score with 2 clutch free throws. And then the Mavs brought home the victory in overtime: 123-118.

Game 5 gave the Mavericks their first chance to close out the series. It was not to be. Game 5the punch game. Despite Dirks 31 points and 10 rebounds. Despite Marquis and Stackhouses poster dunks. Despite every effort the Mavs put on the floor, this night the Spurs played like champs and kept the series alive with 98 points to the Mavericks 97.

Game 6 seemed like a lock for Dallas to wrap it up in front of their home crowd. But then came the suspension. The fans were rowdy, proud, and plenty loud at the AAC, with the entire courtside front row sporting Jason Terry jerseys. Dirk finally outscored Duncan (26 with 21 rebounds to Duncans 24 and 8), but Ginobili had a huge night to lead the Spurs to the 91-86 victory over Dallas.

Game 7 brought all the drama to its climax as the series returned to San Antonio. With the barges dragging inflated effigies of Mark Cuban down the San Antonio River and a re-energized JET back on the runway, Dallas came to play. Dirk had his biggest game yet. (Sprained ankle? What sprained ankle?) Avery tweaked the game plan one more time, and the Mavericks got it going early. They finished the first quarter up 37-27 shooting 83%. The second quarter ended with the Mavs up 64-50. The Spurs made a run in the third quarter and brought it back to 84-78. Then San Antonio pulled ahead near the end of regulation. Dirk tied the game at 104 by converting an and-1 with 21.6 seconds to play. Then, fittingly, game 7 went to overtime. Diop put the Mavericks up for good with his dunk at 3:32. Finley cut the lead to 4 with a free throw at 22.7 seconds, but JET and Dirk closed it out with two free throws each for the 119-111 victory and their first series win over the Spurs in franchise history.

 The Western Conference Finals 

After two seven-game series, Phoenix will be tired. Thats what everyone thought. But after the bump and grind series against the Spurs, who knew that the Mavericks had to shift into warp speed to keep up with the Suns?

Game 1 brought another barn burner, but in the end it was the Mavs who got burned. Thirty-two fast-break points by the Suns and a 27 and 16 night for the official MVP capped a 34 point performance by Boris Diaw. Josh Howard hit the deck after only six minutes of play and didnt return. It was lights out for Dallas as game 1 went to the Suns 121-118.

And then came game 2. Josh, having undergone his own round-the-clock treatment regimen, roared back with a playoff high 29 points. Dirk (with David Hasselhoff in the house to enjoy a little Dirk-inspired return to popularity) displayed the entire repertoire. He jumped, he drove, he sang (and scored) at the lineall to the tune of 30 points and 14 rebounds. And the Mavericks controlled the tempo to even the series with a 105-98 victory.

Game 3Phoenix. The Mavericks cast big shadows in this game as they controlled the tempo, the boards, the lane, and the perimeter. The Suns made a brief run in the second quarter and led at the half 52-47, but the Mavs would return to shut them down. Dallas held Phoenix to 4 fast break points and a mere 36 total points in the second half. Meanwhile, Dirk collected his 50th rebound of the series (17 in this game) and scored 28 points. Josh and Jason came up big for the Mavericks as well, and the Boys in Blue ran away with a 95-88 victory.

Game 4 saw the miraculous return of Raja Bell from his calf strain. And that was just the lift the Suns needed to give the Mavericks an ugly payback for game 3. Dirk disappeared. Barbosa scored as many as Dirk and Terry combined, and Josh went down in a frightening heap of bent left ankle that caused a collective gasp all over the Metroplex. What more can you say? The Suns 106. The Mavericks 86.

So back they came for game 5 in Big D. And speaking of Big D, did Avery really tell him that Someone over there has your MVP trophy, and you need to go take it back!? Wow! The Dallas MVP came to play. He hung up 50 points from anywhere he wanted jump shotscheck; lay upscheck; dunkscheck; free throwscheck; 3-pointerscheck. In fact, lets have 5 of those. Ohhey, how about a tip in? Check. Add 12 rebounds, just for good measure. And yes, Josh, Jason, Jerry, and Gana had their moments too. The Suns hung around through three quarters, but at the endSuns 101, Mavericks 117.

Game 6 returned to Phoenix, where the Suns hoped to make a final home stand that would turn it into a 1-game series for game 7. The Mavericks had other ideas. True, the Suns came out strong and led 29-14 after the first quarter and 51-39 at the half. But at the end of the third, Dallas had pulled back to a four-point deficit at 66-62. And then Jason Terry turned on the afterburners. Following a scoreless first half, the JET fired up 17 points. Dirk added 24 (with 17 rebounds). Howard and Stackhouse provided 20 and 19. And the defense clamped down tighter and tighterallowing only 42 Suns points in the entire second half. The Mavericks won their third series on the road and returned to Dallas with their first Western Conference Championship.

And now, two first timers square off in the NBA Finals.
Twelve wins in the books, four to go.
Lets go, Mavs!

 3. Summer school with Holger 

After the season. After the playoffs. After some rest, relaxation, and vacation time, Dirk will head home to Wrzburg for his annual personal training with Holger Geschwindner. Together they will spend time in the gym working to bring Dirk to the top of his game. Holger sees the complete player as mastering seven levels.

Year by year under Holgers tutelage, weve seen Dirk add to his repertoire. Where is he now on the scale of one to seven? Holger sees him in early level six. Obviously, in the Geschwindner plan, even the top players can continue to develop their game deep into their careers.

So after this incredible season, whats left for Dirk to accomplish? Here are the primary elements he will work on this summer:

1. Defense
2. Dribbling
3. Jumping
4. Getting physical

 Defense 
Dirk freely admits that defense is probably the weakest part of his game. Certainly weve seen major changes in his D under Averys system. And Holger plans some defensive fundamentals for this summer as well. Because of the differences between the international game and the NBA, defense wasnt as much of a priority in their original training regimen.

In international play, the teams defend the basket rather than hacking the ball handler. As in soccer or handball, you are much more likely to see the defending team run back and camp out around the basket waiting for the offense to come to them. That naturally leads to an offensive emphasis on shooting. The best shooters can pull up and fire over the defense rather than driving to the basket and getting whacked, hacked, and attacked as they attempt a lay up.

How should a player match up one-on-one? Holger says, If you look at the ball, you cant play defense. You cannot focus on the ball. Its a natural habit you have to get rid of. Watching the ball allows the ball handler to pump fake or manipulate the defender into moving before the shooter intends to put the ball up. To defend correctly, you should watch the ball-handlers center of gravitythe center of his chest. Where the center of gravity goes, the player goes. You cant fake that! This will help you continue to stay in proper defensive position between the shooter and the basket.

Dirks defensive practice will include improving lateral movement, general physical education, vertical leaps, and strength.

 Dribbling 
The traditional NBA big man rarely puts the ball on the floor. In fact, how often have you thought to yourself, Dont dribblejust shoot! when you saw a traditional center or power forward do more than a quick escape dribble? Dirk already breaks that mold when he occasionally pulls down a rebound and creates his own fast break. Look for more of that next year. Holger believes that as the game gets faster, big guys can dribble more and more.

 Jumping 
Holger also plans to help Dirk work on improving his jumping elevation. A seven footer should have more dunk shots, he says. And along with the dunks, youll see Dirk becoming even more aggressive on the boards. Holger cites Dennis Rodman as an example of excellent rebounding technique. He was a small guy (listed as 68, but perhaps closer to 66 (198 cm), who averaged 13 rebounds per game for his career, This includes 10 years of double digit averages, with a high of 18.7 per game in the 1991-92 season. He led the NBA in rebounds for seven consecutive seasons. What made him such a strong rebounder? He knew how to read the ball and get into position where the ball was coming down.

This coming summer, Dirk will have lots of opportunity to work on reading the ball. And considering his coachs proclivity for mathematics and physics, you can bet that he will understand the angles and spins for any possibility.

 Getting Physical 
Hard on the heels of learning to elevate for dunks and rebounds comes Dirks work on becoming more physical. Holger will help him work on getting to the basket and going for the rebounds no matter who may be in the crowd. Bruce Bowen? No problem. Carlos Boozer? Get out of the way. Get ready. Youre going to see a more aggressive, more physical #41 in Big D.

1. Fan Of The Month: Elisa Mhl
2. Playoffs - Part 1
3. See you at the gym

 1. FanOfTheMonth 

Elisa Mhl is a huge Dirk fan. She traveled all the way with her dad Michael from Wrzburg to Dallas for the season opener 2004/05 against the Kings.

If you want to become fan of the month, send your picture to FanOfTheMonth@41fan.net.

 


 2. Playoffs Part 1 

Not so very long ago, we saw Dirk rise to the occasion in Houston. What is his favorite memory from the 2006 All Star Weekend? He says, Winning the three-point contest was really special. I tried twice before and I fell short both times, so Im really happy to have won that. But the whole weekend was fun.

And did the All Star Game give him any insight on individual players he would encounter later in the season and the playoffs? Not really, he says. The All Star Game is more about having fun. Nobody really lets out his whole repertoire, but its nice to get to know some of the best players in the world on a personal level.

Its been two and a half months since the All Star Game, but Dirk is having some fun with those three pointers again, and hes showing his own extensive repertoire to some of the best players in the worldon a pretty personal level. Ask fellow All Star Pau Gasol and Sixth Man of the Year, Mike Miller.

 

 Brad Loper, Dallas Morning News 

The Memphis sweep may have been only the first of four rounds, but the Mavericks made the most of it. And Dirk led the charge.

 Game 1 
31 points
11 rebounds
3 assists
0.69 points per minute played

 Game 2 
31 points
4 rebounds
1 assist
0.83 points per minute played

 Game 3 
36 points
9 rebounds
5 assists
0.75 points per minute played

 Game 4 
27 points
7 rebounds
3 assists
0.77 points per minute played

Dirk led the team for the series in points, rebounds, and shooting percentages (48% from the floor and 90% from the free throw line).

Whos next? Will we meet our Texas rivals with All Stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan (plus former Mavs Michael Finley and Nick Van Exel)? Or will it be the Kings with Bibby, Bonzi, and Ron? Whoever it is, bring em on.

One series down. Three to go.

 Dirks Events for May 

Because of the playoffs and media interviews after each practice, Dirk has no off-court events scheduled for May.

 3. See you at the gym 

So, basketball is your life, and you want to be like Dirk.

In the United States, you can play in recreational leagues and for your school team. You might enter the local Hoop It Up tournament for a little 3-on-3 action and play American Athletic Union (AAU) ball during the off season. Between the ages of 8-18, you can attend the Mavericks Summer Hoop Camp, and your local high school coaches probably offer summer camps too. Everyone has plenty of opportunities to get on the court. Then, the top players emerge from each age groupthrough elementary school, middle school, and high school teams. Next comes the recruiting blitz for the best of the high school players to accept scholarships to the top college and university programs. With so much opportunity to play, many of these talented young players peak early. And once in a while, America produces a LeBron James.

Its different for young people living in a soccer country like Germany. There, you must decide to play basketball. So what better way to decide if you have what it takes than to get a few tips from Dirks personal coach, Holger Geschwindner? Before the Mavs opening playoff game, Holger was kind enough to share a little of his insight and his methodology for helping players become the best that they can be.

In Rattelsdorf, the gym is open nearly every day during the lunch break. Everyone is welcomeboys and girls, National Team players, and athletes from other sports as well. On a normal day, Holger might work with four to six kids per practice. What? So few? Well yes. This isnt just an open gym. This is where Holger develops a personalized system to teach dedicated basketball students and help them develop year by year.

 How does it work? 
Holger says that, ideally, young people should probably be about 15-16 when they begin a systematic plan. Heres how it works: You come to the gym and play. He will help you handle individual problems and devise a series of exercises and skill sets that build on your strengths and overcome your weaknesses. In typical Holger style, he recognizes the physics applications that develop strengths in your physical agility as you learn the techniques and fundamentals that translate into consistent success. Youll develop your mental agility as wellperhaps enhanced with ballet, or rowing, or fencing, or music.

And if you try to cut corners or always take the easy waymaybe basketball isnt really your sport after all. Lets face it, the intellectual approach and talents required for smashing a shot at a handball goalie are a little different from basketball, where Holger reminds us that big guys still have to make a sensitive shot.

Holger believes in letting the student and the parents know as early as possible whether the student is equipped for a serious future in basketball. Usually, he says, after a few weeks of his system, you will decide. And if youre better suited for another sport, hell suggest that you consider that.

But if the decision is Yes! for basketball, what are the perks? How about doing the same exercises the National Team players are doingmaybe even doing them with some of the National Team players? How about having Dirks coach help you develop your own style, using physics to calculate how you can do it best?

How does Holger feel about his role in a students development? His hands mime a watering can sprinkling a little water here, a little water there. And then a huge smile lights his face as he describes how much fun it is to see the kids grow. When they learn that the practice works, he says, they get addicted!

So if basketball is your life, imagine how great it would be to head over to the gym in Rattelsdorf at lunch time. As Holgers work and travel schedule permits, hell be there. And later this summer? You might be doing exercises with a really tall blond.

 Hints from Holger 
School comes first. Then you need only about 90 minutes of practice a day. Be prepared to have fun, work hard, follow the planand reap the rewards.


 Next month: Dirks progress through the seven levels of a complete player, and what Holger has planned for Dirks summer training.

3. Dirkâ€˜s Schedule in April
4. Destination Dallas - Game Day

 1. FanOfTheMonth 

This month our fans are Janna, Allison and Weslee. What they like most about Dirk is that &quot;He doesnâ€˜t get caught up in all theâ€˜superstarâ€˜junk&quot;.
This picture was taken the day they went to their very first Mavericks game.

If you want to become fan of the month, send your picture to FanOfTheMonth@41fan.net.

 



 2. Playoff Preview 

Were just two weeks from the season finale. With seven games to go, where do we stand?

Our remaining schedule is a tough one, but the Mavs are ready to finish strong. Here are the dates and opponents:

Friday, April 7 @ San Antonio
Saturday, April 8 v. New Orleans/Oklahoma City
Monday, April 10 @ L.A. Clippers
Wednesday, April 12 @ Golden State
Thursday, April 13 @ Phoenix
Sunday, April 16 v. Utah
Wednesday, April 19 v. L.A. Clippers

Can we still catch the Spurs for the top spot in the West? The Kings just took the Spurs down another peg. All we have to do is beat them Friday and keep on winning. So yes, we can catch the Spurs. Will it matter?

That depends. If the season ended today (April 6), these would be the first round match ups.

San Antonio v. Sacramento
Phoenix v. L.A. Lakers
Denver v. Memphis
Dallas v. L.A. Clippers

Would we prefer to play the Kings? Well, sure. During the regular season we split two games in Sacramento and blew them out the door in Dallas. But we still have two games against the Clippers before the playoffs begin. What better time to see what strategy we need to take care of a first round series?

How do we look?
Josh is back.
Keith is out.
Griffin should be back soon.
Harris is close.

But even without the waiver to pick up a 16th player, Josh Powell, DJ Mbenga, and Rawle Marshall are making good things happen while the starters get a few minutes rest during these last few games.

The Clippers are all healthy. The Mavs would need to contain Elton Brand. And veteran Sam Cassell brings lots of experience off the bench. But in a seven game series, most of the time, the better team will win.

So then we would (most likely) meet the Spurs in the second round. OK. On the road to the championship, we have to play them sometime. Second round? Conference Finals? It doesnt really matter, if the OBrien Trophy is your goal. The first seed or the fourth seed comes down to only one advantage: If the series goes seven games, the first seed gets that final home court advantage.

Should the NBA change its current seeding structure that gives the winner of each division the top three seeds? Sure. Its simple. Guarantee the division winners a spot in the playoffs. Then seed the top eight teams by their regular season record. Its fairevery team plays every other conference team the same number of times. And it rewards the teams with the best overall records, which means every game counts.

So when do we start?

April 19 Final day of the regular season
April 20 Final rosters set
April 22-23 Playoffs begin
June 8 (or possibly 6) Finals begin
So, by June 22, lets have Dirk as the League MVP and the Mavericks crowned the NBA Champions.

Stay tuned!

3 April Nike Germany photo shoot
4 April Postgame event with German exchange students
5 April NBA Unicef Public Service Announcement taping
19 April European Player of the Year presentation during the final regular season game

 4. Destination Dallas - Game Day 

So, youve made it to Dallas, checked into your hotel, and planned your route downtown to the American Airlines Center. What should you expect on game day?

 Get your tickets 
If you need to pick up your tickets, the AAC box offices (ticket windows) are on the south and northeast sides of the American Airlines Center. The South Box Office is open Monday through Saturday from 10:00 am-5: 00 pm (10:00-17:00). You may pick up tickets left at will call here. After 5:00, pick up will call tickets and all Ticketmaster tickets at the North Box Office (on the northeast side of the building) beginning two hours before game time.

 Visit the Fan Shop 
The AAC has two fan shops located on the west side of the building, in the north and south corners. Fan shops are open Monday-Saturday 10-5 and during the game.


 

 Go early and wear your Mavs gear 

 Go early 
The doors open for you to enter the AAC two hours before game time. If you want to get there early, you can find plenty of interesting things to see and do. On the west side of the building, youll find the Fan Jam van with hoop games to play and judging of the painted hopefuls for the Mavs Madness Zone. These are the fans who paint their faces (and sometimes their bodies), wear Mavs blue wigs, and come rowdy, proud, and loud to see if they will be chosen to attend the game for free.

 Go through security 
When you enter, you will show your ticket and go through the security check. Youll put your phone, keys, coins, and other metal items in the basket, open your purse or pack for the guards to check, and walk through the metal detector.

 Check out the pregame activities 
Once youre checked through, pick up a copy of the Tipoff and decide where you want to go next. Inside entries to the fan shops are at sections 103 and 110. And throughout the Plaza Level concourse, youll find interesting things to see and do. You might get a $5.00 haircut with the proceeds going to the Fallen Patriot Fund. Or bid on a framed Michael Jordon jersey at the silent auction. Have your picture taken with life size cutouts of Dirk, Josh, and Damp. Walk over the aquarium projected on the floor outside the fan shop and watch the fish scatter. (Howd they do that?) You can also make a sign, register for prizes or raffles, and have the balloon man make a balloon character for you.

If youre 21 or older, you can enter the Old #7 Club for drinks or the dinner buffet and sit at a table overlooking the Mavericks practice court. For fast food, choose any of the vendors in the concourse area. Some of these restaurants are also fundraising opportunities for local organizations like soccer or other athletic teams. The prices are higher than you would find for the same restaurant outside the AAC, but you may also be contributing to a local youth organization.

With your Mavs gear from the fan shop and maybe something to eat and drink, youre ready to find your seats. Inside the arena youll find the action has already begun. The visiting team is probably on the floor warming up, and at the opposite end some of the Mavericks and assistant coaches may also be on the main court.

 Get some autographs 
If you want to get a few autographs, go down the aisle between sections 103 and 104. Fans can wait in this section until about an hour before game time. Mavs players (and sometimes Mark Cuban) will stop to sign autographs on their way back to the locker room. Expect to see the bench players. This season the regulars included Rawle Marshall, Josh Powell, Erick Dampier or Sagana Diop, Keith Van Horn, DJ Mbenga, Pavel Podkolzin, and once in a while, Devin Harris. They will sign their photos in Tipoff , the player poster youll find at your seats, or your Mavs gear. The visiting team enters and leaves the floor between Sections 115 and 116. Some visiting players will also sign autographs after their warmup.

 Watch the big screen 
Up on the big screen, videos play continuously. Youll see the current NBA highlights, history, or team specials; the most recent Timeout with Coach Johnson , or an occasional marriage proposal. Youll also see advertising and public service announcements like NBA Cares 

Thirty minutes before game time, the Mavericks emcee, Chris Arnold, will take the microphone with the birthday and anniversary shoutout of fans celebrating that day. Hell also remind you of your job as Mavs fans in the house and introduce the pre-game locker room interview.

 Get ready for game time 
Next the Mavs Hoop Troop will entertain you with pre-game activities that often include fan participation. Before long, its time for the pre-game warmup. The music gets louder, the screens show the Mavs bouncing in the tunnel, and P.A. Announcer, Humble Billy Hays, will let you know that the JET is on the runway.

From that moment onthrough the warm ups, the National Anthem, the honorary ball kids, and the starting line ups, its non-stop lights, sound, and action. When the lights go down, the special effects come up, and the music rumbles from your toes, its time for the dancers to take the floor and the Mavs starting line up. Then youre on your feet and into the action yourself with the loudest welcome you can clap, stomp, or shout.

 Watch the gameand lots of other stuff 
Think it will calm down after tip off? Think again. Mavericks basketball is music, drum beats, clapping, chanting, and cheering with the only exceptions during our free throws. Timeouts will feature the Mavs Dancers, the ManiAACs, the Mavs Drum Line, the Mavs Madness Zone, the Sprite Zone, and the Hoop Troop with Champ and Mavs Man (and sometimes the Mavs Dancers) firing t-shirts into the crowd. (Be ready in the upper decks.) Breaks between quarters feature diaper derby baby races, fan contests, or Mavs Man and Champ with their amazing trampoline dunks. Watch the screens during the time outs for contests and games and great videos too, like Game Day, the Avery Bunch, the Diop Video, or Mavs Bloopers.

If you want to make a trip to the concourse during halftime youll have to hurry. Otherwise youll miss Frisbee dogs, or free throw contests, or the Bucket Boys, or a Vegas style novelty act.

 Bring em home to victory 
During the second half, youll need to work hard to bring the Mavs home to victory. Be ready to join Boogy Bob with his unique dance routines, or show your Dirk for MVP sign, or sing along with Thunderstruck. If you sit in either end zone, youll also have work to do waving your signs to distract the opposing team shooting free throws. No leaving before the end! You have work to do right up to the final buzzer. Stand up, cheer, clap, high five your neighbor. And when the W is officially in the books, then you can head for the doors and get your free taco coupon as you head back to the hotel after a great nights workumm entertainment.

1. Fan Of The Month: Zimmern from Beijing
2. Basketball is Jazz
3. Dirkâ€˜s Schedule in March
4. Destination Dallas

 1. FanOfTheMonth 

This month we have a fan from Beijing: Zimmern (English name) canâ€˜t wait for 2008 when Dirk will play in her home country.

If you want to become fan of the month, send your picture to FanOfTheMonth@41fan.net.

 



 2. Basketball is Jazz 

If Basketball Is Jazz, Are the Mavs Jivin?

Most serious Dirk fans understand the role that Holger Geschwindner plays in Dirks development as a basketball player. And somewhere along the line, youve probably seen Holgers Basketball Is Jazz concept. Youve probably also seen photos of Dirk playing the saxophone or guitar and heard him talk about learning to play the piano. So whats the big deal about music? Is it really a part of developing as a basketball player, or is it just that music is a totally different activity and therefore a great way to relax?

 

Music is mathematics in motion. Meter, measures, intervals, frequencies, sound waves, and harmonics are all rooted in mathematics. (Now all you language and performing arts people are groaning.)

Okay, lets try this statement: Basketball is music in motion. (Now the jocks are groaning too.) Music is a great way to develop the entire personwhether youre a math whiz, a jock, or a jack of all trades. And its an especially good way to develop the individual and team concepts so important to a championship basketball team.

Lets describe a hypothesis and see where it takes us.

 Hypothesis: Basketball Is Jazz

 Theorem 1: Jazz is a musical form birthed in the United States around the turn of the Twentieth Century.
 Correlation: Basketball is a game birthed in the United States just before the turn of the Twentieth Century.

 Theorem 2: Jazz form follows a standard system, such as AABA, where A indicates the main 8-bar theme (and its variations) with B the bridge or contrasting middle section that makes the entire piece come together.
 Correlation: Well, the ABA became part of the NBA a while back, but each game does have four 12-minute Qs with a half time break that enables the team to change anything necessary to make the entire game come together.

 Theorem 3: Jazz includes syncopationbeats occurring before or after they are expected.
 Correlation: Basketball includes syncopationthink pump fake, jab step, escape dribble.

 Theorem 4: Jazz depends on improvisationspontaneous variations on the main theme.
 Correlation: Basketball depends on spontaneous variations on the set plays.

 Theorem 5: Jazz bands differentiate themselves by their distinctive tones and performance techniques.
 Correlation: Basketball teams differentiate themselves by their distinctive players and performance techniques.

 Theorem 6: The jazz band has a rhythm section (usually piano, bass, and drums) plus a variety of other voices such as horns, vibes, guitar, and singers, any of whom can step up to solo.
 Correlation: Basketball has a starting line up (usually a center, guards, and forwards) plus a variety of other players, any of whom can step up to solo.

 Proof: Basketball is jazz.

 

Do the Mavericks have a band of talented players both in the rhythm section and coming off the bench? Oh yeah.

Would a championship be music to our ears? Oh yeah.

During the next few weeks, well see just what kind of chops our boys in blue really have. Mavericks basketball: Are you jazzed yet?

 4. Destination Dallas 

Maybe youre thinking about coming for the playoffs. Or maybe youre planning a trip to Big D next season. If so, here are a few things that might help you plan.

 How to get here: 
Dallas has a major international airport with many direct flights to and from a variety of countries. For example, coming from Germany, you can fly direct from Frankfurt to Dallas on several airlines. Fly from other major German cities with a connecting flight. Be prepared for a long flight. Travel time from Frankfurt to Dallas is about 11 hours.

 Where to stay: 
Dallas has hotels from the 1 star to 5 star categories. The least expensive way to stay if youre planning to come for at least a week is to choose a hotel that offers residence suites or studios. These rooms have kitchenettes that will allow you to minimize your meal costs by preparing your own food. You may want to eat out for your main meal, but you can stop by a local supermarket to get what you need to have breakfast, Abendessen, and snacks in your room.

 Getting around town: 
Dallas (like Texas in general) is a sprawling mass of roads and highways, and Texans love the independence of driving their own vehicles. But we do have DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit), a system of busses and trains that covers most of the Metroplex. You can ride all day for $2.25 on the trains or local busses or $4.50 for premium/express busses. The American Airlines Center has a DART Victory station for train transportation before and after games or events. The Trinity Railway Express (TRE) connects downtown Dallas with downtown Fort Worth. Along the way it stops at the CentrePort/DFW station, where an airport shuttle will drive passengers to or from the terminals at DFW International Airport.

 
 DART Victory Station at the AAC 

If your hotel is not near downtown, you can catch a taxicab or shuttle from any airport terminal. Some of the nicer hotels have free shuttles to pick you up, if you notify them of your flight information in advance.

If you decide to rent a car, the major rental agencies require a minimum age of 24/25 for the driver. Younger drivers will have significantly higher rental charges. Most companies will not rent to a driver younger than 19.

 The Customs and Immigration Thing 
Most international flights from Europe will arrive in the new Terminal D of DFW International Airport. You go from the plane to the luggage carousel, complete your paperwork, and have your passport checked and stamped. They may or may not ask you to open your luggage. Depending on the number of arriving passengers when you enter the customs and immigration area, you can expect to complete the process in 30 minutes to an hour. You then leave the secured area of the airport and enter the international arrivals area. If you have friends meeting you, they will wait for you here. If not, you are ready to head outside to find your ground transportation (taxi or shuttle).

Be sure to read your countrys regulations on customs before you leave home. You will have a limit per person (or couple) on the value of merchandise you can bring home without having to pay extra taxes or duty, and youre probably going to want to pick up some Mavs gear while youre here, plus any bargains you might find in our numerous shopping malls.

 Some Safety Tips: 
Dallas is a big city. We have lots of southern hospitality, but we also have the crime and danger zones you would expect in any large city. Follow these suggestions:
1. Know where you are and where youre going. You dont want to get lost in the wrong part of town.
2. Make it hard for burglars and pickpockets to target you.
a. Keep your money, credit cards, and other valuables out of sight. This is true both in your hotel room and on your person.
b. Keep cameras and electronic devices in your closed suitcaseout of sight.
c. Keep the curtains to your room closed when youre gone.
d. Use a fanny pack to safely carry your personal items. Keep it zipped. Use the interior front pockets of a jacket or coat rather than open side or back pockets of your clothing.
3. If the hotel has a safe, ask them to lock up your passport. Make several photocopies and carry them for identification.
4. Act like you live here. We have lots of foreign nationals here with plenty of accents; the locals expect that. But tourists can become targets.
5. When youre hitting the clubs or returning from the game after dark, walk only in areas with lots of other people. If you dont have a car, take a bus, train, or cab.
6. The legal drinking age is 21. The local police enforce underage drinking laws as well as laws for anyone who is drunk in public or driving while intoxicated. The legal blood alcohol level is less than 0.1%

 Special Tips for Younger Visitors and infrequent Travelers: 
As Paul wrote to Timothy, Donâ€˜t let anyone look down on you because you are young. If you find that the hotel doesnt have the non-smoking room you reserved, or the car rental has already rented the last compact carask for an upgrade. If you made a reservation, you deserve what you requested. If the provider has given them all out, you can request a larger room or car for the same price quoted in your reservation. If you arrive late in the day, they really may have over-booked. But they may also see an opportunity to take advantage of your youth or your inexperience and unload a less desirable room or car on an unsuspecting guest. You can also ask for a particular floor or section of the hotel farthest from noisy highways or other distractions. Be polite, but always ask to get what you requested. Dont settle for less.

Coming to Dallas for the playoffs or planning a trip for next season? Make friends with one of the Dallas folks active in the forum. Your local friend can help you choose the right hotel, arrange transportation, order tickets, help plan the best things to do while youre in town, pick you up at the airport, or maybe even invite you to stay at his or her home.

In Dallas weve got great shopping, restaurants, sports, museums, music, clubs, parks, lakes, amusement parks, theaters, and best of allDirk and the Mavericks! Start planning your trip today. The Mavs need all their fans to be rowdy, proud, and loudespecially at the American Airlines Center on game day!

Tickets: www.mavs.com or www.americanairlinescenter.com or www.ticketmaster.com

See you at the game!

 2. All Star Weekend 


 

Since 1951, the best of the NBA have come together to showcase their individual talents and play for the honor of their division and the joy of the fans. During the past two decades, this event has grown beyond the game to an All Star Weekend. NBA players learned to fly, so the league added the Slam Dunk contest in 1984. Two years later (1986), the Three-Point Shootout joined the festivities. In 1994, the league added the Rookie Challenge.

This year the All Star weekend takes place in Houston. And the weekend is packed with things to watch and ways to participate. It all begins with the Nokia NBA All Star Jam Session on Thursday, February 16, at the George R. Brown Convention Center. The Jam Session includes interactive basketball activities where you can practice your 3-pointers, drive to the hoop, and slam dunk on 10 different courts. Check out the Kids Zone for smaller kid-sized slam dunk opportunities, and check your hand and shoe sizes against NBA and WNBA players at the Measure Up area. Or listen to live bands and DJs at Club NBA.

The Jam Session also includes opportunities to see your favorite NBA and WNBA All Star players and get autographs. Or you can check out the memorabilia booths for trading cards, collectibles, and your favorite team gear.

Show your Nokia mobile phone and go straight to the front of the admission line. Youll also get admission to Center Court and Club NBA, and youll receive advance notice of celebrity appearances.

On Friday, the Fan Jam hosts the McDonalds NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, along with boys and girls invitational tournaments that continue throughout the weekend and conclude with final games on Monday.

 
The Toyota Center hosts the 2006 NBA All Star events

Meanwhile, over in the Toyota Center, the main events begin. On Friday, the rookies take on the sophomores. And the Mavericks will be well-represented. Devin Harris will play on the sophomore team, and Mavs Assistant Coach, Del Harris, will lead the second-year players in their quest to show the rookies how its done.

On Saturday, we have the All Star Saturday Night activities, including the Playstation Skills Challenge (with Steve Nash out to defend his title from 2005), the Sprite Rising Stars Slam Dunk contest, and the Footlocker Three-Point Shootout. Will the JET (Jason Terry) have an opportunity to showcase his favorite shot? Yes, and so will Dirk!

Sunday brings the big game: The All Star Game will match East against West. Again, we Mavs fans have plenty of reason to cheer. Avery Johnson will coach the West team, and Dirk will suit up for his fifth All Star appearance. (TNT announces the reserve players Thursday, February 9.) The NBA All-Star Game airs live on Sunday, February 19 on TNT, Rogers Sportsnet, and ESPN Radio at 8 p.m. EST (7 Central, Monday 0200 German time). NBA.com will also telecast the game in 212 countries and broadcast in 12 languages. Let the festivities begin!

Cultural Exchange: Houston, TX, 07 Feb. 2006 14:47
 
 Cultural Exchange: New Orleans, Louisiana (by Linda Greenwell) 

Houston, Texas is the home of the 2006 NBA All Star Game, so lets take a look at this bayou city. Houston is the largest city in Texas, with a population of more than 2.5 million people. It is the fourth largest city in the United States, following New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. It covers an area of land slightly larger than the state of New Jersey.

Houston traces its history to two brothers, J.K. and A.C. Allen. The Allen brothers were real estate promoters from New York. In August, 1836, just four months after the Texans victory at San Jacinto, they purchased 6,642 acres of land from the widow of John Austin. The unimproved land cost $9,428. Thinking big, and anticipating that Sam Houston would ride his victory over Santa Anna and the Mexican army to the presidency of the new Republic of Texas, the Allens named their new town Houston. They enlisted Gail Bordan, Jr. to survey and lay out the main streets. And with great foresight, he laid out Texas Avenue (the main east/west street) 100 feet wide.

Houston, built at the headwaters of Buffalo Bayou, owes much of its growth and success to its location as a shipping port. The port is a 25-mile-long complex of facilities just a few hoursâ€˜sailing time from the Gulf of Mexico. Think Americas Atlanta and Pacific coasts have the busiest ports? Not necessarily. Houston is the busiest port in the United States in terms of foreign tonnage, second busiest in the United States in terms of overall tonnage, and the sixth busiest port in the world.

Houston is also home to the NASA Johnson Space Center. This is the location of Mission Control for manned space flights. Although NASA flight engineers now use a newer control room, tours take visitors to the original room, which you will also see in films such as Apollo 13. What was the first word spoken from the moon? Houston.

 
Tours depict the history of mans journey to the moon

If youre looking for other entertainment in the Houston area, they have 11,000 restaurants, a concentrated theater district second only to New York, and more than 500 cultural, visual, and performing arts organizations. Oh, and dont forget professional teams representing all major sportsincluding the largest rodeo in the world.

 
The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest in the world

Houston has more than 40 colleges and universities, many of which are connected with the Texas Medical Center. This is the largest medical center in the world and treats nearly 5 million patients each year.

Houston welcomed more than 250,000 evacuees from New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. Many have chosen permanent residence in the Houston metropolitan area.

They say everythings bigger in Texas. From its original design to its current status, Houston lives up to that reputation as the biggest citynot just in Texasbut in all the southern states.

The first Fan of the Month in 2006: Rylie Lansford

If you want to become fan of the month, send your picture to FanOfTheMonth@41fan.net.

 



 2. Behind the Scenes: Lights, Camera... 

We love Basketras links to the video highlights and Zachers wonderful video mixes. Why? Because as all of you who have watched a game on the ESPN.com real time scoreboard knowwe want to see the action. So behind the scenes, a variety of video folks are working to make it happen.

When you walk into the arena at the American Airlines Center, you have lots of visuals to consider. In addition to the main action on the floor, you have 360 degrees of Daktronics ringing the entire arena, the eight-sided 25 x 49 foot (7.6 X 14.9 meters) scoreboard with four video screens, four digital (LED) message boards, and sixteen digital display boards. They are above, below, and on the sides of each main video screen, with more scoreboards and message boards on each end wall and below the Daktronics on all four sides of the arena. At any given time, you can see the live action, the on-court rosters with statistics, the score, the game and shot clocks, and quite a bit of advertising. And dont forget fun timeout videos like The Avery Bunch, scenes from Rocky, or visual cues for D-Fence!

 
Video screens, message boards and Daktronics add to the visuals inside the AAC.

Three people in a control room high above the crowd use computers to display the inside visuals. They can change the stats or switch from advertising to crowd cues like Noise! or D-Fence as they follow the script and the requests of the event director.

If youre watching on television, the crew consists of a variety of camera operators stationed behind the center section of stands as well as in the corners at floor level. The camera shots and the audio from the play-by-play and color announcers feed through that maze of cabling we discussed last month to a truck in the underground parking lot of the AAC. Each broadcasting team has its own truck. These custom-fitted semi trailers have an audio setup plus multiple video monitors and a full cast of behind-the-scenes crew. In a normal game, UPN 21 or Fox Southwest will have one trailer, with the visiting teams crew in a second. Add a national broadcast team, and youll find the crew from TNT or ABC parked beneath the arena.

 
The UPN 21 crew records Averys pregame show from the broadcast truck.

And by the way, if you are watching the game on a website with real time updates, that comes from the crew in the video control room under the stands. The people in this room, crowded with computers, monitors, and recording equipment, monitor the video recording and show those incredible blocks and oh-so-obvious (now) fouls at the request of the director. And in one corner, with lightning fingers, a technician types the play-by-play that accompanies the official game tape that will go to the NBA league office. Perhaps her work looks familiar? Another statistician is typing the description you see on the website. Maybe youll recognize something like this:
3Q 5:52 Terry hits a 3-pointer. Score: Dallas 81, Warriors 78.
5:17 Richardson fouls Nowitzki.
Nowitzki makes both shots. Score: Dallas 83, Warriors 78.

On the floor, in the stands, high above the crowd, and underneath the arena, youll find lights, cameras, and plenty of action to bring you the ultimate visual experience with Mavericks basketball.

 3. Basketball Basics, Chapter 7: The Officials 

Theyre on the road for as many as 22 days in each month of the season. They run the court for 48 minutes with no substitutions. Theyre usually the smallest people on the court. No matter what they do, someone complains. Theyre the third team in the game, and their knowledge, skill, and positioning can determine the outcome. Theyre the officials.

Every NBA game has a team of three officials. Unlike the players, their teammates change from game to game. They must learn to work with all 59 of their counterparts. Like the players, they have specific roles on the floor. Each night one will be the crew chief. They will cover the play from under the basket and both wings. To the extent they can, they will form a triangle from both sides of the court with one trailing official. Like the players, their work begins before the game begins, but it doesnt end at the final buzzer. They have no Avery Johnson, Del Harris, and Rolando Blackman pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of their game. But they are accountable for their actions. And in its own way, the NBA does have a coaching staff for its referees.

Each referee flies into the game city the night before the game (except in rare back-to-back scheduling). He or she will check the officials website for online training, information, and reviews. The website will include several recorded plays that they review and prepare to discuss. The league also requires them to complete test questions once or twice a week.

The morning of the game, the three officials will meet to discuss the plays from the website and what to expect in the game that day. They will discuss the history of the two teams previous encounters, any questionable actions or play calling from their most recent games, significant players on each team, and the strengths and weaknesses of each team in light of their probable defense against each other. Like the players, they will take an afternoon nap, and they arrive at least 75 minutes before game time to stretch, warm up, and prepare for the tip off.

The NBA also monitors all of its officials. The home team records every game and sends the recording to the league headquarters in New York. And in the stands, a Group Supervisor watches and notes every whistle (and every non-whistle), every position, and every action during the game. These four NBA group supervisors each monitor 15 individual officials and must see them in action a minimum of three games each month.

The supervisor keeps a hand-tallied account of each action. The supervisor is also an experienced official perhaps retired from NBA action. Following the game, he will sit down with the officiating crew and view the recording to discuss what they did well and where they can improve. Was the trailing official out of position? Did this call affect the flow of the game? Was this a potential make up call for an earlier questionable action? Were fouls called inconsistently depending on the player or the circumstances? If any of those things occurred, the supervisor will point them out and discuss them just like the Mavs coaching staff will discuss the players strengths and weaknesses from the same game.

We like to blame them, discredit them, and gripe about them; but NBA officials also love basketball, work hard, travel unceasingly, and try to keep the game fair for all our teams. The next game you see, take five minutes to watch the officials. It probably wont change your opinion of calls against our Mavericks, but maybe it will give you a better understanding of the third team on the court.

 4. Dirkâ€˜s scheduled appearances 

Dirks Scheduled Events:

 December 2005 

On 15 December Dirk joined Santa, several team mates, Mavs Man, and Champ to host a holiday party for more than 120 children at GameWorks. The children, sponsored by The Salvation Army, American Diabetes Association, Cook Childrens Medical Center, and Gildas Club, gave the Mavs in a new perspective on game day activities.

Check out the action here: www.nba.com/mavericks/community/mavs_holiday_party_121505.html 

On 16 December Dirk joined the Mavericks in honoring US Military troops. One game each season, the front row and floor seat ticket holders give up their tickets for the Seats for Soldiers night. This years event gave 151 soldiers courtside views, T-shirts, and opportunities to meet Dirk and other Mavericks players. The military men and women included those recovering from injuries suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan and an Army unit that had just returned from Iraq the previous Sunday.

 Coming in January 2006 

On 13 January Dirk will tape a public service announcement on behalf of childrens cancer research. Look for it soon.

On 14 January Dirk will receive a national award for his involvement in and contributions to the Make a Wish Foundation. The Foundation will present the award at halftime of the Mavericks game against New Jersey.

 2. Behind the Scenes: Letâ€˜s make some noise 

On your feet, Mavs fans, and lets welcome YOURDALLASMAVERICKS!

Hours before Mavs P.A. announcer Humble Billy Hayes welcomes the team to the court, the technical crew has been hard at work to ensure that everyone will hear a great game. So lets take a look behind the scenes to see what it takes to give the fans at the American Airlines Center that heart-thumping audio experience.

The American Airlines Center (AAC) has a massive collection of electronic capabilities. About 340 miles (547 km) of cabling snakes through the walls, floors, and ceilings to network audio/visual, telephone, and multi-band equipment. Those cables terminate in patch bays and user stations throughout the building. If you take the elevator to the topmost level of the arena, you will find a room that houses floor to ceiling racks of computers and processors that control the audio from microphone inputs to speaker arrays, to the suites and clubs, the restrooms, and the arena itself.


 
Long before tip off, the tech crew prepares for 20,000 fans to hear a great game.

Back down in the Plaza level bowl, those computers and cables link to another smaller rack of computers and processors beside the main sound console. Were you sitting in a suite with the radio tuned to Chuck Cooperstein and Brad Davis on ESPN radio? The AACs head audio engineer, or his assistant, can ensure its working properly (or override your selection and change the station)all without leaving the console.

Everything you hear live inside the arena comes through the front of house or FOH console located at the rear of section 110. Whether its Humble Billy on the P.A., a quartet singing the Star Spangled Banner, or JET and Marquis asking the fans to donate to Slam Dunk Hunger, the microphones connect through the FOH console. Do you hear the players shoes squeaking on the court? Do you hear the ball klunk against the rim or swish through the basket? Those sounds also come from strategically placed microphones patched through the FOH console.

 
The FOH console controls the audio throughout the arena.

Have you ever wondered about those funny little voices that say Uh oh! or Huh? after questionable referee whistles? Thats the Mavs music person operating the click tracks with sound effects and the music play list.

 

Do you love it when the music vibrates beneath your feet and the bass rumbles inside your chest? Look up into the rafters and check out the huge subwoofers arrayed above the scoreboard. Youll find smaller delay speakers up there as well, to help minimize the sound delay as the acoustic waves bounce from one end of the arena to the other.

During a time out you will often see the Dallas mascots, Mavs Man and Champ, call for each side of the arena to shout independently, or youll hear the alternating cheers of the Terrace level as the members of the Hoop Troup lead Lets goMavs! The American Airlines Center arena is 120 feet (36.576 meters) high from floor to ceiling. And it covers 840,000 square feet (78,038.553 square meters) more than twice the size of Reunion Arena. So it takes a lot of noise to energize the team.

The roar of the crowd combined with the drum line, the click tracks, and the music make Mavs games non-stop sound from pre-game to the final buzzer. From system design to game day execution, the audio team works hard to bring youthe fans at the American Airlines Centeran exciting and entertaining experience. Then you contribute to the success of Dirk and the guys when your cheers and clapping fuel the Mavericks energy! In other words, the sound of victory is a team effort: on the court, in the stands, and behind the scenes.


 3. Basketball Basics, Chapter 6: Head Scratcher Rules, Part I 

 Upon resumption of play, the team granted the timeout shall have the option of putting the ball into play at the 28 hash mark in the frontcourt or at the designated spot out-of-bounds. If the ball is put into play at the hash mark, the ball may be passed into either the frontcourt or backcourt. If it is passed into the backcourt, the team will receive a new 8-second count. NBA rule 5, Section g.

Isnt it interesting that a team can call a 20-second timeout following a change of possession (rebound or successful free throw or field goal) and then have the option of inbounding the ball from the frontcourt rather than the far end line? Do you suppose that rule came into effect to enhance the fan experience during nail-biter situations like we saw recently in Toronto?

Lets see, with just over a minute to play and the Mavericks down by three points, Dirk slaps at the ball as Bosh drives the lane, and Terry steals it. The Mavericks fly down the court where JET slips the ball back to Dirk for a three-pointer that ties the game at 89-all. The clock shows 53.6 seconds. The Raptors inbound and miss the shot at their end. Dirk captures the rebound and drives for another two-point basket to take the lead 91-89. The Raptors head back up the court again, streak into the paint, then zip the ball to Bonner in the corner. With his feet barely on the three-point line, Bonner launches a shot that ties the game again at 91. We have two seconds left on the clock. Dirk signals for the time out.

And now we see how the optional inbound location can make a difference in the game. The Mavs draw up a play for Dirk, and Marquis stands at the front court hash mark. As the play begins, the Mavericks recognize that the Raptors arent going to let Dirk get open, so Marquis signals for another time out. From the hash mark, those two seconds give the Mavs time to inbound, take one or two dribbles, and hopefully get off the shot.

After the timeout, they reset, again with Marquis on the hash mark. This time (thank you, Coach Del Harris), Jason curls around high screens from KVH and Dirk, and grabs the bounce pass from Marquis. JET takes two dribbles as he drives the lane, and he launches the floater from between the jump circle and the restricted area. Its good! MAVS WIN! MAVS WIN!

All because of an interesting rule that allows a front court inbound after a time out. Hmmm.

 1. FanOfTheMonth 

Maybe a subjective vote, but I just had to do it. Fan Of The Month October 2005: Lenny Marc Bosse Mayer, Dirkâ€˜s first nephew.

If you want to become fan of the month, send your picture to FanOfTheMonth@41fan.net (if you are 2 weeks or younger, please ask your parents).

 



 2. Recap of the Preseason - Letâ€˜s go 

The Mavericks finished training camp Monday, October 31, with pride in their accomplishments and eager anticipation of beginning the season. Avery Johnson completed his first camp as the Head Coach. The team has its best defensive look in years, and everyone is ready to reach for the prize.

Avery is talking about going for the Championship. Darrell Armstrong took the microphone to center court before their final preseason game to encourage the fans to bring the energyso the Mavs can bring the Larry OBrien trophy to the American Airlines Center in 2006. UPN 21 commercials for Mavericks telecasts show Dirk and Devin dancingyes thats rightdancing. Theyre ready to play.

During the 2005 preseason, the Mavs tied a club record with 6 wins against 2 losses (both to the LA Clippers). They were 3-1 both on the road and at home. Five other Western Conference teams matched their preseason record: Memphis, LA Clippers, Phoenix, LA Lakers, and Houston. Denver led all teams with a 7-1 recordrunning off seven straight wins after dropping their opener to the Hornets.

Looking for clues about the new defensive system? The Mavericks posted their best points-by-the-opponents figures this preseason as well, holding their opponents to 91.9 points per game. Offensively, the Mavs shot 46.0% from the floor and 42.1% from 3-point range. Here is a recap of the preseason game scores:

October 11 Dallas 96 Sacramento 83
October 12 Dallas 80 L.A. Clippers 95

Dirk led the team in scoring with 15.7 points per game and played in seven of the eight games. He also contributed 6.0 rebounds per game and 2.4 assists per game. He had the only preseason double/double for the Mavericksagainst Milwaukee, when he scored 25 points and collected 10 rebounds.

Josh Howard scored in double figures in six of the eight games he played, and he averaged 12.8 points in his team-high 30.6 minutes per game.

Erick Dampier missed three games with a sore right hip. He came back for the final preseason game to play 18 minutes and score 6 points with 6 rebounds and a 55% shooting percentage from the floor.

Jason Terry led the assists category with 3.6 averaged per game. He was also the second leading scorer with 12.9 PPG and went 12-23 (55.2%) from 3-point land.

Doug Christie shot 48.5% from the floor, averaged more than a steal per game, and played 148 minutes with only 8 turnovers. He continues to play limited minutes to prevent further injury to his ankle.

If Damps hip continues to improve and Dougs ankle holds up, the Mavs have only two serious injuries for Casey and Dionne to help rehabilitate. Jerry Stackhouse continues to have a swollen right knee, and Pavel Podkolzin will be out for an extended period following surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot.

The rest of the bench could be the strongest in the Division, if not the League. Devin Harris put on some exciting performances both when he subbed for Jason Terry and when both guards were on the floor. Keith Van Horn looks healthy and ready to playespecially after his super performance against the Pistons in Dallas. Marquis Daniels has been a solid contributor and is eager to prove himself after injuries kept him out of so much of last season. Darrell Armstrong always brings energy to the floor. And the newcomers look like solid additions. DeSagana Diop logged excellent minutes during Dampiers injury. And in addition to his aggressive work in the paint, Diop quickly stepped in to cool the Dirk/Arroyo controversy in the final preseason game. Josh Powell averaged 18 minutes in six games and shot 52.6% from the floor. D.J. Mbenga and newcomer, Rawle (rhymes with ball) Marshall, also expect to contribute this year.

Averys first camp is in the books, and the team wants to bring home the Championship. Get ready for an exciting season. Mavericks basketball is the best entertainment in the NBA.

 3. Behind the Scenes: The Mavericks Athletic Trainers 

As the season begins, the Mavericks have already been carefully watching Doug Christies ankle, Jerry Stackhouses knee, and Erick Dampiers hip. With almost daily practices, eight pre-season games, 82 regular season games, and the possibility of an additional 28 post-season games, only Major League Baseball plays more games than the NBA. Players want to play, and coaches want their best men on the court. Last month we saw how Robert Hackett gets the Mavericks conditioned and ready to play. This month well go behind the scenes with the trainers who keep them on the court and help them recover from injuries.

Casey Smith is the Mavs Head Athletic Trainer, with Dionne Calhoun as his assistant. These two men, along with a massage therapist and the team physicians (an internist and an orthopedist) help keep the Mavericks healthy throughout the season.

 
Dionne (left) and Casey in the training room

Casey and Dionne tape ankles before practices and games, sit on the bench during games to handle minor injuries, and oversee rehabilitation throughout the year. They take their responsibilities seriously. From October to June, they work seven days a week. Perhaps on an off day or holiday theyll come in for only a couple of hours to help a player rehab, but theyre working with the team in Dallas or on the road every day. Through the summer they will continue to work with the players. August is their month offbut only if everyone is healthy.

During the games you will see Casey and Dionne removing or covering blood during timeouts to prevent the referees from sending a player to the bench. They will treat simple wounds, jammed fingers, minor sprains, and other pokes and bruises that occur during play.

The trainers also oversee the hydrotherapy area in the Mavs locker room. The pool room has two whirlpoolseach large enough for four Mavericks. The warm plunge (103 F / 39.4C) warms up ankles and legs before the games. The cold plunge (53 F / 11.6C) cools the players after a game and slows any possible swelling.

The Mavericks have a Hydroworks 2000 pool with a treadmill in the bottom. The trainers can raise or lower the treadmill to a depth of six feet (1.8m) under water to provide the proper amount of resistance. The treadmill will move up to 8 MPH (12.8 KPH) and can be tilted. Two hydro jets can add even more resistance. Running under water reduces the stress of the players body to about of its normal weight, which makes it effective both for rehabilitating injuries and for cardiovascular conditioning.

 
Mavericks Hydrotherapy Room

Casey and Dionne can use four underwater cameras to watch the players walking or running motion. Sometimes the motion may have caused the injury, or the injury may have caused the player to adjust his motion. The cameras display on a flat-screen TV that the trainers can monitor. They can also record the sequence to show the player what hes doing and how to correct it.

The Mavericks have one of the finest locker room complexes and some of the best equipment in the NBA. And they depend on the best trainers to help them use it to stay healthy throughout the long season.

 4. Basketball Basics, Chapter 5: Offense 

On Mark Cubans Blog Mark recently wrote:
Watch the pregame of NFL games. They have talked to coaches about plays. They talk about plays. They talk about defensive strategy. They talk about what will be run in which situations. Fans do the same. It makes watching the games a lot more fun.

What do we talk about before an NBA game? Sure we talk about individual matchups. We might even talk about individual skills. But how many in the media even know that there is a play run and a defense called, with options, bailouts, and audibles on almost every single possession? And how many write or talk about them?

Has anyone ever heard after a basket, I expect the Mavs to run a thumbs down or horns side in this situation. Detroit is probably expecting them to push the ball, so watch for the Pistons to use a send 4 to the offensive boards and everyone else gets back when the ball goes up into a man to man, gold on the post, come-on first dribble on an entry pass.

Or, The Pistons always seem to run a 42 in out-of-bounds situations. They have run it 64 pct of their inbounds possessions under their own basket. Here is how it works .

Because basketball moves so quickly, we typical fans rarely notice that the players are using pre-set and carefully practiced plays. Each play has options that come into effect when the opposing team reacts in a certain way. Defender cuts off the ballhandler? Each player knows the appropriate bailout. An audible is a new play called on the court as the team reacts to the opposing teams play.

The Mavericks use horns (which refers to the hand signal Avery or the players use to call the play) for the pick and roll. (See Basketball Basics: Chapter 3 for an explanation or watch the Mavs/Rockets 2005 playoff games for a Ming/McGrady demonstration video.)

The thumbs down in Mavericks terminology refers to a play also called the NBA play or floppy. Heres how it works:
The coaches design each play for a particular shooter, with options for other shooters. In the thumbs down,
- The number 1 shooter (lets say its Dirk) moves into the paint in front of the basket.
- The number 2 shooter (Josh Howard) sets up outside the lane with Doug Christie spaced farther from the basket to set a pick.
- The point guard (Jason Terry, aka JET) brings the ball to the top of the key.
- The remaining player (DeSagana Diop) moves to the opposite side of the lane.

Dirk breaks either left or right and moves outside the pick and away from the basket.
JET moves toward the location where Dirk will arrive outside the pick and passes the ball.

If the defense cuts off access to Dirk, then Josh will break into the open space.
JET reverses direction and passes to Josh or to the open player on the weak (opposite) side (Diop).

 


The team has 24 seconds to get the ball down the floor, set up the play, use the options (or the bailout, or call an audible), and take the shot. No wonder the announcers dont have time to discuss the plays!

Remember at the end of last year when Dirk, and others, discussed the teams basketball IQ? Now you may understand more about why NBA players not only have incredible talent, they must also be smart, quick thinkers to see, analyze, and execute the play.

 2. Eurobasket 2005 Summary 

The German National Team began their run toward the European Championship with some injuries to key players and major question marks concerning their potential success. After beating Belarus and Georgia, they fell to Greece in the Supercup. They then beat Bosnia-Herzegovina, but fell to Spain. They came out of the Acropolis Tournament 0 and 3. Following another victory over Bosnia-Herzegovina, the team headed to Vrac with an unimpressive record of 4 wins and 5 losses.

But never underestimate Dirk Nowitzki when he comes to play.

Round 1
Germany 82
Italy 84 OT
Dirk scored 27 points in the opener.

Germany 84
Ukraine 58
Dirk scored 27 points in the second game.

Germany 51
Russia 50
Dirk scored 24 points in game three.

Qualifying game to move to the Quarter Finals
Germany 66
Turkey 57
Dirk scored 33 points. (Do you think anyone was going to keep him from the Quarters?)

Quarter Finals
Germany 76
Slovenia 62
Dirk scored 22 points.

Semi Finals
Germany 74
Spain 73
Dirk scored 27 points, including the game-winning basket with 3.9 seconds to play.

Greece 78
Dirk scored 23 points, led his team to the Silver medal, and earned honors as the top scorer for the tournament (average 26.1 points per game) and Tournament MVP.

Oh, and Averycheck out these defensive numbers:
Average rebounds: 10.6 per game, (tournament leading 9.3 per game defensive rebounds)
Second highest in blocked shots with an average of 1.9 per game.
Three double doubles in 7 games.

Dirks offense was obvious in the scoring. Here are the final percentages:

2 pt Field Goals 44.8%

Free Throws 88.5%

Congratulations to the entire German National Team for an incredible run and the Silver Medal. Next year (after the 2006 NBA Championship series), its on to Japan for the World Championship and another step toward the Beijing Olympics.

 3. Behind the Scenes: Getting ready to play 

Ever wonder what goes on behind the scenes at the American Airlines Center? This month well begin a new series that discovers some of the who, what, where, when, and how of the people and places that allow us to enjoy Dallas Mavericks basketball.

Basketball is a game of non-stop action. More than almost any other sport, basketball players must be in top physical condition to perform. Games may be won or lost in the final minutes based on the physical conditioning of the players on the court.

So how do the Mavericks get ready to play? Although they have no obligation to work out from the end of the season until the beginning of training camp in October, every player serious about his game will continue to work through the summer. We know Dirk takes about a month off to recover from the grueling pace of the season, and then works hard with (and without) Holger not only to improve his game, but also to stay physically fit. Most of the other Mavericks players have similar routines. Those who remain in Dallas work all summer with Robert Hackett, the Strength and Conditioning Coach.

 
Mavs Strength and Conditioning Coach: Robert Hackett

Robert is a former track and field athlete, who has 11 years experience training players in the NBA. He develops individual programs for each player to improve that players strengths and strengthen his weaknesses. During the summer, the local players worked out with Robert five days a week.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the guys reported at 8:00 am to the Mavericks locker room at the American Airlines Center. Located just upstairs from the practice court, the locker room complex covers 8,000 square feet (more than 743 square meters). It includes the lavatory facilities, fitness training room, athletic trainer facilities for taping and rehab, hydro-therapy room, and the actual locker room. The largest floor space belongs to fitness training. This room rivals any major commercial gym. It includes 48 pieces of equipment, some oversized to fit todays NBA players.

Training during the summer meant agility drills and scrimmage play on the practice court. Then the players returned to the fitness room for a round of endurance weights and/or 50-60 minutes of cardio training.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays the players met at a local university track at 7:00 am for training drills in the adjacent volleyball sand pit. Following the drills, they ran the track. Followed by more drills, and more running. And more drills, and more running.

Weight training is less about total weight and more about repetition. Players began their summer sessions with an average of 20 repetitions in each of three sets. The next session they might increase to three sets of 25 reps. Eventually they work up to three sets of 50. Thats three sets of 50 per station!

Roberts tasks become more intricate once the season begins. He devises fitness programs that help the starters stay in shape and keep the rest of the team ready to play any number of minutes in any game. A player like Dirk, who normally plays more than half the game, may follow a weight training regimen that calls for one set of 20 reps rather than three sets of 50.

Generally Coach Hackett considers 20 minutes of playing time as the defining number. Following a home game, any player who did not play 20 minutes gets to hit the practice court and run. On the road these players will work out an additional hour before or after the shoot around or go to a local fitness center.

The NBA is not won by skills alone. And Robert Hackett intends to ensure that the Mavs have the heart and the legs to match their amazing skills.


 4. Basketball Basics, Chapter 4: Defense 

Weve heard it since the day Avery Johnson became Head Coach. The Mavericks new system is all about defense. As the team begins training camp, the players are going to hear the coaches talk about defense as personal responsibility.

So what is defense in a basketball game? I mean, really, isnt it just about keeping the other guys from scoring? Or at least keeping them from scoring as much as we do?

Thats exactly what it is. And to play it properly, all the Mavs players work together to accomplish two goals: (1) protect the basket and (2) prevent the other team from taking good shots.

Basketball has two types of defensive strategies: zone and man-to-man (also called one-on-one). This year you will see the Mavericks primarily in the man-to-man defense, but lets define both types and the advantages of each.

Zone defense
Zone defense means that each player guards an area on the court and attempts to prevent any player entering that zone from scoring. Teams play three types of zone defenses.

The three-two zone has three defenders stationed across the foul circle. The other two defenders cover each side of the lane. Teams using the 3/2 zone hope to put pressure on the ball outside (before getting close to the basket) and create fast break opportunities for their own offense.

The two-three zone has two defenders across the foul circle. The other three defenders drop down near the basket. You will see teams in this zone defense when they want to protect the basket. They may have taller, slower players who are less likely to move quickly from defense to offense on a fast break.

The one-three-one zone has one player above the key, one near the basket, and three across the foul circle. Teams use this defense to trap the ball and pressure it outside the lane or at the top of the key.

Man-to-man defense
Man-to-man defense means just what you would expect. Avery will assign each player on the floor to guard a specific opposing player. The coaching staff will designate the match-ups based on size and ability. The basic concept is simple. When you guard another player, stay in a straight line between him and the basket.

But sometimes defenders get beat. In those circumstances, another player needs to come help until the primary defender can catch up again. This is called rotation. A full rotation means another player moves to pick up the player who beat his man. The remaining help-side player must then cover two players. In a partial rotation, the help-side team mate steps toward the loose player without completely leaving his own man. Hopefully this will slow him down until his own defender regains position. However, offensive players who get loose or pick up a mismatched defender may capitalize with speed, height, or strength to drive toward the basket or shoot over a smaller player.

To counteract a particularly hot shooter, the defense may double team, which means two players guard the primary shooter. This may create a dangerous situation where another offensive player will be unguarded (and therefore open to shoot). However, when executed correctly, the double team can lead to a turnover and a new offensive opportunity for the Mavericks.

 

The Mavericks goal this year is to limit every opponent to no more than 42% shooting. Hopefully your understanding of defensive strategies will help you appreciate and enjoy their efforts on both ends of the court.

 5. Training Camp 2005 

Welcome back, Mavs!
Training camp began Tuesday, October 4, 2005. Avery is hard at work with his entire coaching staff reinforcing their new system. We know it will be geared toward defense, but the General has assured the media and the fans that his system will maximize what we do well. Yes, he will expect 48 minutes of defense. But Avery is also looking for excellence on transition. With Doug Christie (former all-NBA defensive player) and DeSagana Diop added to the roster, the Mavericks hope to have tighter defensive pressure that can feed their potent offense.

The Mavs have invited three non-roster players to camp: Samo Udrih, 26, who is the older brother of San Antonios Beno Udrih; former Maverick Erick Strickland, and Kaniel Dickens. Expect Shawn Bradley to announce his retirement this month. The Mavs will probably waive Tariq Abdul-Wahad.

When the season opens, look for lots of motion. The Mavs will run, move the ball, and move without the ball more than weve seen in the past. Expect them still to go for 100+ points every game, but watch for more emphasis on the post-up game with 3s as the second choice when no one can get free inside.

Avery will also emphasize smart, hard fouls. Wasted fouls will probably earn their owners a trip to the bench.

Whats the goal? Limit the opponent to 42% shooting. This goal takes the center position on the wall of the Mavericks practice court.
