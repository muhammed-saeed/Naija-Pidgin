Cash Register Training Tutorial
 Written by Marianne Moro 
Operating a cash register is similiar to using a computer.
 
 Most stores and restaurants use an electronic cash register to record customer sales. Sharp, Casio, Royal, Samsung and other major electronic companies produce cash registers with many features, from scanners to programmable keys. Electronic registers combine adding machine utilities with liquid crystal display (LCD) screens and other computerized functions. Cashiers must memorize procedures for a number of transactions involving cash, checks, credit cards, refunds and debit cards. Once a new cashier has memorized the keyboard layout, other aspects of the job can be perfected with practice. 
 Skill level: Easy

 1 
Identify the keys on the cash register. On an electronic cash register, the numerical keys may be raised, like on a computer keyboard, or they may be flat touch pads, similar to keys on some automated teller machines. Function keys are located on both sides of the register keyboard and above the numerical keys. These keys may be rectangular or square-shaped, and are reserved for certain tasks. They may have labels such as void, tax 1, tax 2, check, subtotal, charge and cash. Other keys will correspond to items for sale in your store or restaurant.
 2 
Learn how to place the roll of receipt tape in the register. Remove the empty cardboard cylinder that held the old tape, and slip a full roll of paper on the spindle. You may have to lock the paper roll into place. Cut off excess paper so that you get a clean-edged piece. Slip the straight paper through the slot in the front of the register.
 3 
Place money in the cash register drawer. A cashier begins his work shift with a certain amount of money, called a till, in the drawer. This amount varies depending on the establishment&apos;s needs. Place the appropriate amount of twenties, tens, fives and singles in the register compartments. Then count out quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies. Cashiers may need to refill the till throughout the day.
 4 
Scan items by their universal price code (UPC) code. Some cash registers come equipped with a scanner that sends information from the preprinted label on products directly into the register&apos;s memory. The price and item description is displayed on the register&apos;s computer screen. If the register doesn&apos;t have a scanner, the cashier enters prices manually using the number and function keys.
 5 
Practice using special function keys. Cash registers are programmed for discounts, refunds and exchanges. There are keys for different payment methods, like debit and credit cards, checks and cash. For debit and credit cards, customers will swipe their cards in a debit and credit card machine, punching in their pin numbers for debit purchases. The register will then slip out a receipt. The shopper will sign the receipt. You will keep one copy and give the other to the customer.
 6 
Ask for customer identification for credit and debit card purchases. Check purchases also require identity verification.
