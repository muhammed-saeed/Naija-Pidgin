 Any ideas for sweets that I can add to a goody tray for my workers on Christmas Eve? 
 

 

I work at a fast food restaurant and would like to bring in treats to the people that volunteered to work that day. Recipes for things that are quick, easy, and inexpensive to make would be appreciated.
 
home made Choc. covered pretzels. christmas cookies. Buckeye candy. you use peanut butter,powdered sugar corn syrup mixed together,roll into balls,let set&amp;stiffen, then dip in melted choc,with a toothpick&amp;leave part of the top show so it looks like a buckeye.made a lot in Ohio.
 
rice krispie treats

Chocolate covered pretzels! just dip pretzels into melted chocolate bark......let dry then eat.......they are the best!!!!!

no bake cookies, hello dollies

oreo balls - crush a bag of oreo&apos;s, add 1 box of cream cheese. form into balls and dip them in melted white chocolate. yummy!

Tere are many great ideas on foodnetwork.com, Rachel Ray&apos;s 5 min fudge is great!! ( You can omit the currents)

I second the vote on the Rice Krispy Treats. I usually dress mine up by decorating them with chocolate, adding chopped pecans to them, etc. You could also dress them up with some squiggles of red and/or green frosting.

Another thing I do with mine is to pat them out very thin, cut that bar in half, cover one half with chocolate then top it with the other half of the bar.

I always love getting rice crispy treats during the holidays. Very easy and cheap. All you need are rice crispies cereal, a bag of marshmallows and butter. Melt it all together in a big pot, mix it up and then pour it into a baking dish to cool. Once it&apos;s cooled, you can cut them up into squares. The recipe should be on the side of the rice crispies cereal box. Yummmmm!

fudge , buckeyes, cookies, candy canes, no bake cookies, chocolate covered pretzels

Peanut Butter Fudge
1 small jar peanut butter
1 jar vanilla frosting

Mix in bowl, then microwave for 5 minutes. Stir, then pour evenly in shallow baking dish. Let cool completely, cut, and serve.

chip ham pie

Everybody loves snickerdoodles. Easy to make and a really good cookie. There is a recipe on this site.

marzipan sweets are nice but not everyone likes them, gingerbread is nice as well

Cashew Truffles

For a darker chocolate taste, use all semisweet chocolate instead of part milk chocolate. But I think a bit of milk chocolate adds a delicious depth of flavor.

INGREDIENTS:

1 cup whipping cream
2 Tbsp. whipping cream
1/4 cup butter
12 oz. semisweet chocolate, chopped
5 oz. milk chocolate, cut into chunks
1 tsp. vanilla
2 cups finely chopped cashews

PREPARATION:
In a medium saucepan, bring cream and butter to a boil. Remove pan from heat. Add chocolates and vanilla and stir until mixture is creamy and smooth. Refrigerate about 2 hours until candy is firm enough to handle easily. Form into 1&quot;balls, then roll in chopped cashews. Store in refrigerator.


Coconut Drops

This easy candy recipe tastes better than the packaged store bought kind!

INGREDIENTS:

2 cups flaked coconut
1 Tbsp. butter, softened
1 Tbsp. milk
2 cups milk chocolate chips
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

PREPARATION:
In small bowl, combine coconut, butter and milk. You may need to add more milk if necessary so mixture holds together, depending on the moisture content in the coconut. Form into 1&quot;balls and place on waxed paper. Melt chocolate chips in microwave on MEDIUM power, stirring every minute. Let cool slightly. Dip coconut balls in chocolate, place on waxed paper. Refrigerate to harden chocolate. Store tightly covered in the refrigerator. Makes about 24 candies

My favorite sweet finger foods is this...take ritz crackers and peanut butter and make a&quot;sandwich&quot;...then melt some chocolate and dip each&quot;sandwich&quot;in the chocolate and let cool on wax paper...freeze and then serve...yum!!!!!!!!!....

Cookies, Brownies?
Cup cakes, Sandwiches?

cookies is another good ine like sugar cookies and you can decorate them

I love no bake cookies
