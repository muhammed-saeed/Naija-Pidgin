		QuickBooks How to Get Up and 
 Running 

 Using QuickBooks to Manage 
 Your Restaurants Finances 

  or...If 
 You Cant Count It, You Cant Manage It! 

 By John 
 Nessel 
 President, Restaurant Resource Group 

 I often feel like a Pied Piper, 
 singing the praises of QuickBooks to every independent restaurant 
 owner and operator that I meet. I have good reasons for being so 
 unabashedly supportive of this product. As a consultant and former 
 restaurant owner and operator who has used just about every 
 accounting product on the market at one time or another; I know 
 what I am talking about! QuickBooks is inexpensive, powerful enough 
 to handle every financial task that you will face, exceptionally 
 easy to use, well known to your accountant, and far and away the 
 most popular small business accounting software in the universe 
 (this is important because you will always be able to find someone 
 to help you if you need support). I liked the product so much I even 
 wrote a book to help restaurant owners like you to take complete 
 control of the business side of their restaurant. 
 
 &quot;Im going to 
 share a little secret with you. You dont have to know much, 
 if anything, about accounting or bookkeeping to take control 
 of the finances of your restaurant. What you do need is 
 discipline, some guidance, common sense, and a real desire to 
 make your restaurant successful&quot; 
 
 Like most small 
 businesses, the typical restaurant owner/operator must wear lots of 
 different hats, usually all at the same time. Some hats fit better 
 than others. Most likely you have come into this venture with some 
 experience in one particular area of the restaurant business. 
 Perhaps its from the kitchen end as a Chef or maybe its from the 
 front of the house as a Manager. As you will learn quickly (if you 
 have not already done so), the responsibilities of running a 
 restaurant business are much more demanding than of being 
 responsible for a specific job or position within the business. In 
 my experience working with many restaurant startups, the hat that 
 is most ill fitting is that of your restaurants Financial 
 Manager. Moreover, as the saying goes: If you cant count it you 
 cant manage it . Thats why its so important to make sure that 
 implementing a well organized and easy to use accounting system 
 should be one of your highest priorities. Its equally important to 
 have that system in place well before you open the doors, as once 
 you get open you will have little or no time to focus on anything 
 other than getting through each day. 

 To get you in the 
 right frame of mind Im going to share a little secret with you. You 
 dont have to know much, if anything, about accounting or 
 bookkeeping to take control of the finances of your restaurant. What 
 you do need is discipline, some guidance, common sense, and a real 
 desire to make your restaurant successful (which means more than 
 offering great food, service, and value to your customers). I am 
 living proof having never had an accounting course, or any financial 
 training or background prior to opening any of my restaurants! 

 What 
 Version to Use? 

 QuickBooks has 
 constantly upgraded its offering with regular annual releases since 
 1999. The most current release, QuickBooks 2010 is no exception. It 
 used to be that QuickBooks had just two products in the line, the 
 Basic version (formerly just called QuickBooks) and QuickBooks Pro. 
 Well they got rid of the Basic version a few years back and there are 
 presently a variety of new product variations, called Editions, 
 including QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, QuickBooks Accountant, QuickBooks 
 On-Line Edition, and a even a version for Mac users. 
 You dont need any of these (unless of course you are a Mac user). 
 Just stick to QuickBooks Pro and you will be good to go. I should mention that QuickBooks Pro (and 
 all higher editions) offer multi-user versions that allow up to 
 five users to access the file at the same time. I do not often see 
 independent restaurants that use the multi-user version, but under 
 some circumstances this can be a very helpful feature. 

 If you are now 
 using, or have access to, a recent version of QuickBooks there is no 
 real need to upgrade. Just beware that QuickBooks has a Sunset 
 Policy. Under this policy only the most current annual version of 
 the software, plus the prior two versions, will be supported (by 
 support I mean live technical support and business services relating 
 to that version). Therefore, if you are using QuickBooks 2008 or 
 earlier I would highly recommend upgrading to the most current version so as 
 to avoid putting your financial data at risk. 

 Installation and Setup 

 Unlike most 
 software applications that can be used immediately out of the box, 
 QuickBooks (this goes for all accounting software products) requires 
 that you create a file that is configured or setup specifically 
 for your business (restaurant, in this case). This file should also 
 include all your account balances as of the date that you begin 
 using it (e.g. checking account, fixed assets, vendor payables, and 
 year-to-date income and expenses). 

 QuickBooks makes 
 this task simple with its Easy Step Interview.  The software 
 prompts you with step-by-step questions about your company, the way 
 you want to set it up, and even prompts you to enter all your 
 beginning account balances. These questions include the type of 
 business that you are in with the option to create a Chart of 
 Accounts that QuickBooks deems is appropriate for the business 
 that you select. Other questions involve the collection and payment 
 of Sales tax, use of QuickBooks Payroll, Inventory, Class, and Item 
 features, how you want to use Bill payment options, and whether you 
 will be using Cash or Accrual accounting. Context sensitive help is 
 always available throughout the interview to provide the needed 
 support to help you answer each one of these questions. 

 Lets go back to 
 the Chart of Accounts because it is truly the heart of your 
 accounting system. It defines exactly how every financial 
 transaction that occurs in your restaurant can be recorded and used 
 to help you manage your business. Unfortunately the Chart of 
 Accounts that QuickBooks utilizes for restaurants is less than 
 desirable (though Ive got to cut them some slack here as they 
 maintain a database for hundreds of business types). You should use 
 the Uniform System of Accounts for Restaurants as your guide. The Uniform Systems of 
 Accounts for Restaurants provides all restaurants with an industry 
 standard accounting classification system, one that not only will 
 allow you to make common sense of your sales and expenses, but will 
 also permit you to compare your restaurants performance against 
 industry standards. 
 
 &quot;The Chart of 
 Accounts is truly the heart of your accounting system. It 
 defines exactly how every financial transaction that occurs in 
 your restaurant can be recorded and used to help you manage 
 your business.&quot; 
 
 If you are using 
 the QuickBooks Easy Step Interview to setup your company file you 
 have two options as it relates to the Chart of Accounts: 1) select 
 the account list for Restaurants that QuickBooks recommends, or 2) 
 select the alternate option to create no accounts at the 
 current time. If you let QuickBooks create accounts, you can always 
 edit the list later (though the process will be tedious and time 
 consuming). If you choose to have no accounts setup at this time you 
 have the opportunity to either manually create your own accounts, 
 import a more appropriate chart of accounts list from another 
 restaurant file, a process that is simple so long as you have such a 
 list. The best option is importing (&quot;Restoring&quot;is the technical 
 term) a complete QuickBooks company file that has already 
 configured, one that already has an appropriate Chart of Accounts 
 (e.g. that mirrors the Uniform System of Accounts for Restaurants), 
 and perhaps other preconfigured features appropriate for restaurant 
 use. As a reward for getting this far in the article I will send 
 you this file. Just email me at and let me know which year&apos;s release you 
 are using. I will forward it to you via email. Better yet , 
 purchase my book The Restaurant Operators Complete Guide to QuickBooks 2nd Edition and get a fully configured company file with many additional features included. It will have you up and running in a few minutes. 

 Select 
 a Start Date 

 The interview 
 will also ask you to select a Start Date . This is the date 
 after which you will be recording every financial transaction that 
 occurs in your restaurant. If you are a new restaurant then this 
 choice is simple. You will start on the day that your first 
 financial transaction was made (most likely the day you opened your 
 bank account). You will record every single financial transaction 
 from that day forward. 

 If on the other 
 hand you are switching to QuickBooks from another program, or you 
 have been not using any accounting software to run the restaurant or 
 perhaps you are transitioning your accounting in-house from an 
 outside vendor, then you have a choice to make. The ideal situation 
 in this case is for your Start Date to be the first day of the new 
 year (January 1) so that you will have complete financials for the 
 entire year ahead. If you are already into the new year then going 
 back to January 1, and recording all your transactions, may or may 
 not be practical. In this case start on the first day of the current 
 month, but never mid-month, and begin recording all your 
 transactions from this point forward. 

 If you are using 
 the Easy Step Interview then QuickBooks will walk you through the 
 process of entering all the beginning account balances based on the 
 start date that you select. This process can also be performed at a 
 later date either manually or by going back to the Interview. 

 Entering and Paying 
 Your Bills 

 Entering and 
 paying your restaurants bills represents at least 80% of the total 
 time you will spend using QuickBooks, and QuickBooks is designed to 
 make this process easy. Most restaurants have established terms 
 with their vendors from Net 7 days for the small mom and pop 
 suppliers to the more typical Net 14 to Net 30 days for the larger 
 commercial vendors. In Massachusetts, our alcoholic beverage vendors 
 are on Net 60 day terms. You should therefore be entering your bills 
 at one time and paying them at a later date. This is called Accrual 
 Accounting because the expense is recognized when the product is 
 received and not the date it is paid. This has important 
 implications for your Profit and Loss Statement because you want all 
 your business expenses to precisely match the period that the 
 corresponding revenue is recorded (the date that the meals are 
 sold). If you need to pay a bill immediately upon receipt, then 
 simply use the Write Check feature to record the payment 
 (there is no need to enter the bill when you use this feature). 

 Entering a bill 
 is as easy as clicking an on-screen icon that reads Enter 
 Bills.  A graphic image of a bill appears which makes the 
 process of entering the information effortless. QuickBooks 
 remembers Vendors names so that when you start typing the name 
 the software will automatically complete it. It can even be set to 
 remember which account the bill should be coded to so that you do 
 not have to search the account list every time you enter a bill from 
 the same vendor. QuickBooks makes it easy to enter each Vendors 
 terms, and uses this information to let you know when each bill is 
 due (or how many days it is overdue!) 

 QuickBooks Vendor 
 reports are also easy to access and the two that you will use most 
 often are the Open Balance detail (shows each un-paid bill 
 sorted by vendor with the due date for each and total owed) and the Vendor Balance Detail (shows the history and running balance 
 of bills, credits and payments chronologically for each vendor). 
 Once you decide who and how much you are going to pay simply click 
 on the Pay Bills screen icon and a list of every unpaid bill 
 will appear, sorted by vendor and due date. All you need to do is 
 click on each bill you want to pay and then select the Pay&amp;Close button. This screen will also indicate the running total 
 of all the bills you select for payment to help you keep your 
 payments inline with available cash. Once you complete this task you 
 can use the software to either print your checks (recommended) or 
 write them manually and assign check numbers. I suggest you use a 
 standard three-part check (one check per sheet with two stubs, one 
 stays with the check and the other attaches to the bills that your 
 paying to make your record keeping easy). 

 Recording Daily 
 Sales and Deposits 

 QuickBooks was 
 not really designed for retail business (like a restaurant) that 
 uses a POS system or cash register to record and consolidate 
 individual sales and receipts. Fortunately, it is easily adapted to 
 do just that. There are two approaches to accomplish this task, 1) 
 use of a QuickBooks form called a Sales Receipt, or 2) making 
 a General Journal Entry.  The information entered is 
 the same whichever method you choose. 

 Use your POS 
 report to identify your daily sales totals (e.g. food, beer, wine, 
 liquor), the tax you collect, other transactions that result in 
 either more or less cash being present than your recorded sales 
 indicate (e.g. house charges, gift certificates sold or redeemed, 
 discounts, complimentary meals, cash over/short etc), and finally 
 your cash and credit card receipts. Each of these categories should 
 correspond to an account in your Chart of Accounts, and combined 
 they create a single financial entry for each day of business 
 (whether it be a Sales Receipt or Journal Entry). 

 Some restaurants 
 create unique QuickBooks accounts for depositing credit card 
 receipts, and even set them up as Current Assets rather than 
 as Bank accounts (different categories on the Balance Sheet). 
 The logic is that these payments take a few days to be processed and 
 deposited into your checking account, and should therefore be 
 technically be viewed as Receivables rather than bank deposits. 
 The balances are then transferred into the checking account when the 
 funds are actually deposited. I recommend that you treat credit 
 cards as you do cash and simply use your Checking Account for all 
 deposits. Use your common sense to know that when you look at you 
 Checking Account balance you must take into account any credit card 
 receipts that might still be in transit. By the time a vendor 
 receives and deposits a payment based on this checking account 
 balance the credit cards will have surely been deposited.

Just make sure that you record your credit card receipts exactly as 
 they will appear on your bank statement. Visa, MC and Discover totals are 
 now processed together, and deposited into your bank account in a 
 single amount for each batch. You therefore need to record the total 
 of these three as a single line item in your QuickBooks sales entry. 
 Another example involves the way in which American Express (AMEX) 
 processes its receipts. In some cases AMEX deducts the discount fee 
 (typically 3.5%) from the batch total and then deposits the amount 
 net of the discount into your account. If you do not make your 
 QuickBooks entry in a way that mirrors this you will have a hard 
 time reconciling your bank statements when they arrive. 

 Whichever method 
 you choose, Sales Receipt or Journal Entry, QuickBooks has a feature 
 that will make the process more efficient, the Memorized 
 Transaction.  It allows you to create a template that you can 
 use for each entry with all the accounts that you will be using 
 already set up, and ready for your daily dollar inputs. Not only can 
 you create a Memorized Sales Receipt or a Memorized 
 Journal Entry for your daily sales and deposits, but you can 
 also create Memorized Bills , Invoices , and even Reports for transactions or information that you use and/or 
 repeat on a regular basis. 

 Accounting for Your 
 Payroll Expenses 

 Restaurant 
 payroll, including employer paid taxes and benefits, is currently 
 the highest single expense category in the restaurant industry. For 
 this reason an accurate accounting of your monthly payroll (assuming 
 that you use monthly accounting periods) is absolutely essential. 
 The topic of restaurant payroll cannot possibly be covered in an 
 article like this. For now I will simply summarize the most 
 important issues that you need to be aware of. This will insure that 
 you handle your payroll recording in QuickBooks in a way that will 
 not only provide you with high quality accounting information, but 
 also in a way that allows you to pro-actively manage your 
 restaurants payroll expenses. 

 1)   Outsource your 
 restaurants payroll to a qualified Payroll Processing Service. While QuickBooks does have 
 robust features to process payroll I strongly urge you to hire an 
 outside vendor for this task. The cost is very reasonable and the 
 headaches and time that you will avoid are worth every last nickel 
 spent. 

 2)   Create Payroll 
 Departments to get more detail from your payroll reports. Instead of simply recording 
 your wages and salaries in one or perhaps two general categories 
 (e.g. Gross Wages or Salaries and Hourly Wages), create detailed 
 payroll accounts based on the functions that each category performs 
 in the restaurant. At a minimum create an account for Kitchen Wages, 
 Front of the House Wages and Manager Wages. From there you can 
 create sub-accounts for more detail. Remember, what you cannot count 
 you cannot manage!   

 3)   If possible process your 
 payroll twice per month (not the same as bi-weekly). Weekly or bi-weekly payroll processing 
 will typically result in monthly Profit and Loss statements with 28 
 days of payroll expenses (with 35 or 42 days in some months), but 
 will never match the number of days of income or other expenses 
 (typically 30 or 31 days). This will result in the understating or 
 overstating of your payroll expenses. Ask your payroll company to 
 process your payroll twice per month, from the 1 st to the 
 15 th and then from the 16 th to either the 30 th or 31 st .  

 4)   If you already operate 
 with weekly or bi-weekly payroll periods, then make a monthly 
 accrual entry into QuickBooks to account for the disparity between 
 the number of payroll days and days in the month. For a description of this 
 process with detailed examples read the article located on my 
 website: www.rrgconsulting.com/payroll_accrual_article   

 5)   Use a QuickBooks 
 Memorized Journal Entry to record the payroll totals summarized in 
 the Report provided by your Payroll Service. Your payroll company will provide you 
 with a detailed report that summarizes the gross wages and payroll 
 taxes and expenses that you pay as the employer. It will also 
 indicate any employee deductions or advances that are made, and 
 indicate the details as to the disbursement of all cash based on 
 your employee payroll checks as well as the combined taxes that are 
 withheld from these checks and your employer related tax expenses. 
 All this information can be combined into a single QuickBooks 
 Journal Entry that takes no more than a few minutes to make (no 
 exaggeration!). This process is made even easier if you create a 
 Memorized transaction with all the accounts setup and waiting for 
 your dollar entries.  

 There are many 
 other periodic bookkeeping tasks that you will need to make that I 
 cannot possibly cover in this article. Loan payments, inventory 
 adjustments, allocating insurance premiums evenly during the year, 
 creating customer invoices, paying your sales tax, dealing with 
 charged tips, handling employee meals, bartered services, and the 
 list goes on. The good news is that QuickBooks offers easy 
 procedures for each. In addition, QuickBooks has the easiest Bank 
 Reconciliation procedure I have seen in any comparable software 
 program. This is extremely important as paperless cash transactions 
 are occurring with increasing frequency, and you need to be able to 
 have confidence in the balance of your QuickBooks cash account. 

 Use the Restaurant 
 Operators Complete Guide to QuickBooks  to help you through 
 the maze, or seek guidance from your accountant if you have any 
 problems getting these procedures straight. Remember, all it takes 
 is discipline and common sense. The effort is not only well worth 
 it, but essential to your long-term success!
