Everyone enjoys these simple to prepare Chicken Nuggets. They don’t take very long to make—about the same time it takes to go to your nearest Fast Food Restaurant and purchase them– BUT these tasty gems are healthier, all natural and devoid of chemical preservatives. They are wonderful to serve as appetizers, or for a quick and healthy family meal. (for more cost-efficient entertaining recipes and ideas, a selection of tasty ‘mocktails’, and other recipes from a Homemade Orange Julius; Homemade Boursin cheese; Swirled Peppermint Brittle; herbal recipes and preparations; homemade holiday and hostess gift ideas; popular spice combinations –such as Mignonette, Cajun, Asian Five Spice, German Mustard, Bouquet Garni, etc–and so much more, check out the ‘ category ’ sections of betweenclosefriends.com )

Ingredients:

1 lb ground raw chicken 

2 T onion flakes 

½ tsp thyme 

1 large egg ¾ tsp salt 

½ c dry bread crumbs 

1/3 c milk

¼ c milk 

1 c dry fine bread crumbs 1 tsp paprika

1. Mix the salad dressing (or mayo) with the milk in a bowl.
