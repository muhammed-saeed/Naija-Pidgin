 I&apos;ve seen fast food workers drop entire trays of Big Mac meat on the floor, and scoop it up and keep going.

I quit that day. Made it a whole two weeks.

Haven&apos;t eaten fast food since.

 I don&apos;t like to think about it, and I hope not.
Don&apos;t special order anything I guess.

 That just makes me want to put someone in a headlock (not you). One should never mess with another person&apos;s food. That&apos;s worse than cheating to me.

 Absolutely...I never eat out because a lot of my friends have worked in catering, and when they tell me the stories...!!
Best thing to do, don&apos;t annoy the chef, or the waiter/waitress.
Alternatively,...don&apos;t eat out..

 Sure, a few. Also goes for the fanciest, my expensive restaurants, too. There are jerks everywhere regardless of their occupation.

 yes I do...which is exactly why I don&apos;t eat fast food. The level of uncleanliness of most employees alone keeps me away, but I also have experience as well. When I was 16-18 I worked in fast food and I can tell you some stories that would make you vomit. I&apos;ve seen people spit in food, put things from the sink or floor in food. I&apos;ve seen evidence of bugs, vermin and other stuff in these places. The people dirty, with filthy habits and some lifestyles that not only made them liabilities but made me question whether they should be handling anything another person eats at all!

Have things changed? Nope. It used to be when I did it you had to go get a food handlers permit and have your hands inspected and such. Just recently I went to a fast food establishment I won&apos;t say the name..we&apos;ll just call it the BK lounge...for a meeting with a client..apparently he loves the place! We got there, there was a swept up pile of garbage in the middle of the kitchen floor. People handling fries and burgers with no gloves. Some o fthem had cracked painted looooong fingernails (this used to not be allowed for chips of polish can get in food and it just nasty). One person had a weave or braids and she had no gloves on but she kept patting her head so as to scratch it and then she would scoop out fries. Most of them had shirts and pants on that looked like they had been worn for weeks without a wash and one woman even sneezed into her hands, didnt wash them and then rang up customers...my client ordered his food and asked me if I wanted anything...I declined..I told him I had no appetite!

 I worked in a pizza chain, and some drivers spit in the food of customers who never tipped. I never ate the food there even if no one tampered with it because fast food (I consider pizza to be fast food) is gross anyway.

 Yes have seen it on 60 minutes. I know a few guys were talking about this one guy at the pizza place that made pizzas and everyone that was ordered over the telephone he would take to the bathroom in back and sit his balls down in the sauce and fart on the pizzas. When I heard that I called had reported him. I did not know his name but I knew what shift and how he looked.

 Yes. I have been warned never to use the McD&apos;s next to my workplace by someone who used to work there.

 I don&apos;t know - haven&apos;t got sick from fast food so probably they hadn&apos;t but I&apos;ve no doubt that some would if they got annoyed with a customer or as a sick joke.
