Problem 11-49 Determine the force P acting on the cord which is required to maintain equilibrium of the horizontal bar CB of mass M. Hint: First show that the coordinates sA and sB are related to the constant vertical length l of the cord by the equation 5sB - sA = L. Given: M = 20 kg Solution: L = 4sB + ( sB - sA) L = 5sB - sA
 L = 5 sB - sA = 0 sA = 5sB
