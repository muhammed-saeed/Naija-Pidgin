 Great Deal M. Furlong &quot;PrairieF #2009-01-06 
 I would prefer to write this review after some time has passed, but I want to make sure I get my thoughts out here early on.

This is my third kitchen scale. I bake all my own bread at home and good baking requires weighing the ingredients rather than volume measuring.

This scale feels very light which made me nervous at first, but I&apos;ve used it for three weeks now, through a lot of baking over the holidays, and my concerns seem out of line.

This scale fits all my needs. Here is what I look for:

1. CAPACITY - AT LEAST 10 LB (this has 11 lb, or 5 kg). This is required to be able to tare out a glass bowl which can weigh near 5 lbs empty. 11 lb is still borderline when I&apos;m making bread in a 6 qt kitchenaid bowl, but I just weigh ingredients separately in another bowl if it becomes a problem.

2. PRECISION - DOWN TO 1 GRAM - Another scale I have was only good to 5 grams and, although this was probably good enough, it drove me nuts not to be able to go down to 1 gram

3. STABLE PLATFORM FOR VESSELS -- My previous scale had a platform that sat on top of a pillar and eventually came detached. After that it was a balancing act to weight anything

4. ORDINARY BATTERIES -- I liked my old scales fine, but it drove me crazy that I had to keep buying overpriced CR2032 batteries for the things. These batteries don&apos;t last long and cost too much to replace. I can&apos;t figure out why they use these &quot;button batteries&quot; rather than the more common higher capacity AAA, AA, C, D, etc cells. It&apos;s not like these scales are micro-sized. In any event A BIG BIG PLUS for this scale is that it uses standard batteries! Don&apos;t sell this point short.

5. PRICE -- $50, $30, $70 for a scale to do this is crazy. the circuitry in these things is cheap. It&apos;s not rocket science. All these scales that have &quot;features&quot; are a waste of money. This scale does what needs to be done for $20.

6. FEATURES -- Zero the scale, read negative numbers, switch between metric and English weights, tare a bowl....that&apos;s it...that&apos;s all you need. All the rest of it is a waste of money and a further chance for failure. this does what is needed and no more.

7. EASY TO READ -- big numbers. this scale is good....Not so good about this scale (and the ONLY problem I have so far) is that big bowls tend to cover the read out a little and make it hard to pick up the weight. So far it hasn&apos;t been a big deal, but it can be a slight annoyance.

BOTTOM LINE:

This scale gets 100% on items 1-6 and about 50% on item 7 for a 93% grade overall...enough for me to give it 5 out of 5 stars.

The only remaining unrated item is DURABILITY....I&apos;ll report back in a year. My old, $50 scale only lasted 3.5 years. I&apos;m betting this one goes at least that long...plus I won&apos;t be forking over for new button batteries every month and a half.

 
 Great customer service! Eric Law #2009-05-19 
 ** This review has been edited ** I now give the product 5 stars (stupidly, Amazon doesn&apos;t allow changing the rating when editing).

Originally I wrote a bad review indicating the unit eats batteries. We didn&apos;t use it frequently and every time we did, the batteries were dead.

About a day after I submitted the review, Bill from EatSmart Products emailed me indicating he had seen the review and short battery life is not typical of the product (he stated they should last ~1 year). With no prompting from me, he sent out a new scale along with some batteries to replace the ones the original scale consumed. Although it hasn&apos;t been very long, so far the batteries in the new unit are holding up well.

So as I stated above, I now give this scale a 5-star rating due not only to its good performance, but the great customer service from the manufacturer!

 EatSmart Precision Pro Digital Kitchen Scale, White 

I am no scale expert, but EatSmart has offered me a free book if I write a review of their scale, and this has prompted my review. I have only been using the scale for two weeks, but I haven&apos;t had any problems with it so far. My only nitpicks at this point are that the &quot;white&quot; color has a pinkish tone and that the buttons aren&apos;t perfectly even. Aside from these minor cosmetic issues, the scale is exactly what I expected: a functional, easy-to-use, accurate, inexpensive ($25), small, lightweight, plastic scale.

When making my scale purchase, I also considered buying the Escali Primo Digital Multifunctional Scale, Chrome . The only advantage that the Escali Scale has over the EatSmart Precision Pro Scale is that the Escali Scale has buttons that prevent food from getting into the cracks. In contrast, when using the EatSmart Scale, you have to be careful not to drop food in between the two buttons. For this reason, I put my scale in a plastic Ziploc bag (gallon size) to protect it from drippings and droppings - this keeps it clean, and it still works great! In all other respects (except for the few noted below), the two scales seem to be very similar according to the product descriptions.

In the end I decided to purchase the EatSmart Scale over the Escali Scale because I preferred the EatSmart unit options. The EatSmart Scale allows you to switch back and fourth between four different unit modes: 0000 grams, 000.00 ounces, 00.000 pounds, and 00.000 kilograms (resolution: .05 ounces/1 gram). This requires pushing the right button once for each mode (for example, start on grams, then push once to get to ounces, then again to get to pounds, then a third time for kilograms). The EatSmart scale will remember the last unit-mode you chose, so you don&apos;t have to readjust every time. If you always use pounds, just leave it on pounds. When you return the next day and turn on your scale, it will still be on pounds.

In contrast, The Escali Scale only offers three unit options: 0000 grams, 000.00 ounces, and [00 lbs + 00.0 ounces]. I prefer the EatSmart Scale because it provides pounds with decimals (00.000 lbs) - for me this is easier to deal with than [00 lbs + 00.0 ounces]. I frequently measure out meats, which are labeled in pounds with decimals (00.000 lbs) at most grocery stores. If I buy a pound of hamburger and want to divide it into three 1/3-pound portions (0.33 lbs), the EatSmart Scale makes it easy. I just measure out the 0.33 lb portions right there on the scale. With the Escali Scale, I would have to do some conversions to measure out my portions, because the Escali Scale will not measure out pounds in decimals. In some cases these conversions can be difficult without a calculator. The conversion required in this example would be:

(0.33 lbs/portion) * (16 ounces/lb) = 5.333 ounces/portion ---&gt; Possible to do without a calculator, but not ideal.

Another EatSmart feature that I have found convenient is that you do not have to use the tare button. Simply place your empty bowl or plate on the scale BEFORE turning it on, then push the left button once to turn it on. It turns on very quickly and is zeroed-out upon starting up. Then you can add your ingredients to the plate without having to wait for the scale to tare! If you would rather use the tare button, that is easy as well. Simply push the left button to turn on the scale, then place your empty plate on the scale, push the left button a second time to &quot;tare&quot; the scale, wait for the scale to zero out, and then add your food items that you want to measure.

With its three-minute automatic shut-off feature, the scale gives you plenty of time to make your measurement before turning off. I haven&apos;t had it shut off on me yet in the middle of a measurement. It also allows you to shut it off manually by pushing the button on the left twice (you have to wait for it to zero out to 00.000 before pushing it the second time - if it is at 00.003 when you go to push it the second time, it will just tare again to 00.000). The scale also seems to give its readings rather quickly - so no problems there.

IN SUMMARY: The EatSmart Scale has three battery-conscious features: generous three-minute automatic shut-off, option to turn off manually, and ability to tare without actually spending time taring! It also uses standard AAA batteries which are easily replaceable. It offers four convenient unit modes: 0000 grams, 000.00 ounces, 00.000 pounds, and 00.000 kilograms. Overall a simple and functional scale without any bugs. I&apos;m completely satisfied with my purchase - I would buy it again!

 
 I Love the EatSmart Precision Pro!!! Lisa Falcon #2009-10-26 
 I waited a couple of weeks before I wrote this so I felt it could be accurate. First, let me start bt stating we LOVE this scale!! We looked and looked at scales - researched and researched.. I was online saw this scale for $25, saw the great reviews and bought it instantly! Some of the greatest features...
Size - it is just the right size, it is flat and compact so it fits on the counter perfect.
Measurements - I love that is measures in grams, ozs.. it makes weighing very accurate. It comes with this handy little book that lists almost all foods and gives the info in th USDA Calorie Factor. At first I was puzzled - now I love it. I weigh most meat in oz. then you multiply the Cal factor by 28 (28 grams in an oz) then you have cal per oz.. it is very accurate. I did not know what 6 oz of chicken looked like..
Tare Function - this is fabulous!! You just push the on button, put your plate/paper towel whatever on top - push on/tare. It resets to zero, then measure your food..how easy is that!!
We measure EVERYTHING.. we are adjusting our diet and this scale has proved to be essential. Bottom line, it is accurate, easy to use, easy to store, has any function you would need... and at a great price!! No need to go out and spend $50 - $100 on a scale - this cannot be beat!!! Go for it - you will not be sorry. 
 outstanding product Sunny #2009-02-04 
 I use it almost every day and love it very much!
Pros:
1. accurate and precise to .05 ounce / 1 gram increments, that is important for me;
2. tare (zero) function, very convenience for cooking and baking;
3. just needs 2 AAA batteries, save money on batteries;
4. reasonable price.
No cons so far.
Highly recommended!! 
 Impressive features for the money Tom Keller #2008-12-10 
 So let me start this review by saying I think this is the perfect scale for any home chef. I have been impressed by the features that this scale has versus ones I have had in the past, especially at this price point. And as both a home chef and diabetic, I have been weighing my food fairly continually for almost 20 years and gone through my fair share of scales.

The big benefits in my mind:
1) Capacity - The scale weighs up to 11 lbs, which for a unit this size is already impressive. What really got me was the accuracy of the scale at high weights when i had a full bowl of ingredients on there. This is where my last Salter scale was very weak, and that one only went to 6 lbs.
2) Rubber Feet - On a plastic scale I cannot under state how important this one is to me. My old scale slid across my granite counter top and I lost more than one recipe to accidental spillage. Simple thing but invaluable.
3) Unit Button - The button to switch measurements is ON TOP of the scale. Prior scale I have owned had a little button underneath the scale. There was nothing more infuriating than having food on the scale and having to turn it over to switch measurement units.

The LCD display on the scale is also nicely angled so its crisp and easy to read when you stand over a counter. Compact and easy to clean. Wouldn&apos;t even think about buying another scale brand again. A+ 
 great company S. Moore #2010-01-11 
 I bought this product October 27, 2009 and unfortunately it stopped working this weekend. I called the company to see what I could do and they said that they will send me out a new one at no charge. One of the owners answered the phone. I thought that the company and the owner did great customer service. I will definetely shop with Eat Smart again!!

 
 Passable scale. Cheap electronics? dirtyvarmint #2010-05-23 
 As a kitchen scale, this item leaves a lot to be desired. Let me rephrase that: it is not a good kitchen scale. This would make an excellent scale for a junior high science lab bench; it would perform well weighing out reagents. 10 years ago that is where you would have found this scale - a lab bench.

The scale platform is quite small. Anything larger than a hamburger will not fit on the scale unless placed on a separate plate. This is not a deal-breaker, but the digital readout is quite dim and is less than an inch below the platform. Reading the digital readout with a standard-sized dinner plate on the platform thus becomes an exercise in crouching down, peering up at the readout from underneath, and shining a flashlight to try to make out what the digits say.

Had this been the only major problem with the scale, I would have given it 2 stars. However, after two months the scale became very finicky. It would not turn on, or it would turn on but the LCD display would not change. Generally this problem would go away after leaving the scale off for from several minutes to 24 hours. This scale was kept in a dry place at room temperature. This may have been a power problem, a battery problem, or both. Since the battery compartment is covered merely by a simple plastic panel and is approximately a millimeter above the countertop, I suspect that any in-kitchen spills could cause electrical damage. This was never a low battery problem. The battery life on this scale was quite decent.

The scale continued to work (mostly, for a definition of &quot;work&quot;) for a few months, experiencing an LCD/power outage about once per month, with otherwise daily use.

Finally, far less than one year following purchase, the scale ceased to work at all. It could not be turned on. Multiple sets of new batteries (to test whether the replacement set was, by chance, faulty) did nothing. After less than a year of use the scale had completely ceased to work.

We threw it out and switched to a Salter mechanical scale. It doesn&apos;t have a 10-pound capacity or 1/100th ounce accuracy and the small platform makes balancing items somewhat of a chore, but it&apos;s cheap and will last as long as the mechanical spring. I would give it (the Salter) 3 stars. 
 Great scale - Great price Walter Ervin &quot;walter #2009-01-09 
 I&apos;ve been wanting a digital scale with a tare function for quite a while, so I was more or less familiar with the features that are important to me and how well it is layed out for ease of use.
I am very happy. From the large digtal window to the tare function/off -on switch and weight window,some real thought has been put into it&apos;s design.

I had only one concern before I received it, that it was too small. I had worried unnecessarily. We are very short of counter space so small is also a major concern. It takes up very little counter space, a big plus for me.
To alleviate my fears of the scale being too small I took my largest bowl, 10&quot; and I had no problems. (It could have gone further).
My Salter 11 pound spring scale (also a very good scale in my opinion),was out so just for fun I took the last weight that was on the EatSmart and dropped it on the Salter. Although the Salter had not been zeroed in four days, it and the EatSmart were in lockstep!! That sounds good until you compare their $$$$$$ cost, features,ease of use, accuracy possible and counter space required (the Salter is a monster),EatSmart is the way to go. I&apos;m just glad Iwas ready because the EatSmart is a real value. 
 Some good points and some bad points - a mixed bag M. Goldshteyn #2009-09-29 
 Well, I&apos;ve been using my scale for some three weeks now and have a mixed opinion of it. Before I list the pros and cons, let me give you some history. I started with a gram accurate food scale from [...]. I used that scale for about a year or so and the on/off button practically stopped functioning. After getting to the point of having to use a screwdriver to turn the thing on I had had enough and bought this scale based on the wonderful reviews it had received. Now, let&apos;s get to the pros and cons as I view them. I will start with the cons and the reason I gave the product only three stars:

1) The scale has a hard time making up its mind. I use the scale in gram mode and the issue I have is as follows. I put an item on the scale, say weighing 29 g. The scale displays 29 g. But, quite often, several seconds later the display changes up or down by one gram. Now the scale reads, say 30 g. OK, fine, it took some five seconds for it to calibrate, but then, several seconds later it&apos;s back to 29 g. So, which is it, does the item way 29 grams or 30 grams? At first, I thought that maybe the item is midway between the two, say 29.5 grams. But, having an item weigh mid way should only happen one in ten times, statistically speaking, and this keeps happening constantly. The problem is further exacerbated when I tare the scale. I get a zero reading only for it to switch, several seconds later, to -1 gram or 1 gram. Since the tare button is also used to turn the scale off, I often have to press it multiple times (as in three or more) to turn off the scale, since the press that should have turned it off just tares it back to zero from the -1 or 1 &quot;misreading&quot; that it displays spontaneously right before I turn it off.

2) The tray is a pain. My previous scale came with a ten-inch diameter convex glass tray that set on top of the five inch metal (plastic?) tray that was physically attached to the scale. It was a joy to use. Now, having only a five inch tray built into the scale itself seems very limiting. At first I started using dishes, now I&apos;ve finally decided to just use the glass tray from the old scale on top of the metallic tray of this scale, to have more area for food. I often weigh food on paper towels and having a five-inch diameter tray to work with is very limiting. The problem I face now is that the ten-inch glass tray from my old scale obscures the display. Of course, this scale was clearly not designed to use the glass tray from a different scale, so it is not at fault here, but I just find the annoyance of having to read the display through that glass tray less of an annoyance than being limited to the five-inch tray that is part of this scale.

3) The scale buttons and display get very dirty very fast. I find I have to constantly clean them. Now granted, the buttons are metallic and dirt is more visible, but it&apos;s the same dang LCD display as my old scale, so why does it attract dirt so much more?

4) The scale buttons feel very flimsy. Now, I have read the reviews where people talk about using the scale for over a year without them breaking, but they just do not feel very comfortable and reliable when I press them. My old scale had a membrane keyboard, which sadly gave out after about a year, but when I pressed a button, it did not feel flimsy or wobbly.

Now, here are the pros:

1) This scale has enough capacity to weigh pretty much anything short of a watermelon. My previous scale maxed out at five pounds. This one easy hits five kilos (i.e. approx. 11 pounds) before it errors out.

2) I have the black and chrome scale, which matches my appliances well. I love the fact that the cosmetics of this scale are so customizable.

3) Gram level accuracy, once you use it, it&apos;s hard to give up.

Thank you for reading my review and please feel free to comment.
