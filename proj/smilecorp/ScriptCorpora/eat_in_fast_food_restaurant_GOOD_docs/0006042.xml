Woman pulled from car, stabbed early Sunday at fast-food chain

Lugo, 19, was being held Monday on $100,000 bail.
 
 CORPUS CHRISTI —
A 19-year-old woman told police her boyfriend dragged her from a car and stabbed her early Sunday outside a fast-food restaurant.

Officers were called about 3:40 a.m. to a woman&apos;s home to find her suffering stab wounds to her chest and hand, police said.

The woman refused medical treatment but told police she was at a fast-food chain in the 5000 block of Saratoga Boulevard when her boyfriend pulled her out of a car and attacked her with a knife.

An armed security guard intervened, pulling a gun on the man who ran, police said.

The guard chased the attacker, who threatened to stab him several times before he jumped into a waiting car at a nearby pharmacy.

The woman told police they could find the man at his home in the 1900 block of Modesto Street.

Julian T. Lugo III, 19, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault.

He was being held Monday at the Nueces County Jail on $50,000 bail on suspicion of aggravated assault family violence and $50,000 bail on suspicion of aggravated assault on a public servant.

The girl needs to rethink the type of person she dates. What makes me think this is not the first time this has happen. She won&apos;t press charges because she LOVES him. dumb chick.

However, I do feel sorry for you because no one should be hurt or stab.

Can this girl be the most beautiful girl on this earth? Could it be that at his very young age he has decided that this was the love of his life? He does not look very bright. I wonder how she looks? At the same time wth would you stab your girlfriend at 19 years old with plenty of girls in the world. My only guess is they are probably made for each other anyway.

This has nothing to do with Machismo or being Mexican. The guy is a straight convict or bully that takes clear advantage of girls and is a possible murderer in the not to distant future. Machismo is defined as being tough and showing fierceness and telling your girlfriend look I can do this better that that other guy or even you. Hitting or stabbing your girlfriend is not&quot;Machismo&quot;.

It also has to do with the mentality men have here too. Why don&apos;t the women here get themselves someone out of town. This city is full of disrectful thugs of all ages and varias races, not just the hispanics and the blacks, although they are high up there in the statistics here of abusive partners. Sorry guys, but i know what i am talking about. We&apos;ll talk later.
Just call it like it is. Women, Run away from the men in Corpus Christi. They will go after your best friend and not care a lick. Corpus Christi is Thugh Central.&quot;Sigh&quot;,&quot;Sigh&quot;

Then explain why 99% of the time that this particular crime (P-- beats up, stabs, kills, etc. girlfriend) that it is a hispanic male involved. And dont use the race card, my family includes hispanics.

I disagree. Machismo is a sick attribute of hispanic culture that needs to be trashed. Boys are turned into prissy princes who cant open a can or wipe their rears- served by women. Mamas boys who tantrum to get their way. They grow up to have bigger tantrums; and sooner or later momma cant clean their messes.

Finally, someone who posts using intelligence, instead of stereotypes. Education, and good family upbringing are key to minimizing this growing trend. I hope this punk is sentenced to 20yrs.

While I am as angry as you are about this&quot;little boy&quot;I am also ashamed as a hispanic male that women have as much emotional power over thier mates as they apparently do. This is a situation that affects the entire country. Every incident lowers GDP in a disproportionate amount compared to what this&quot;little boy&quot;was&quot;producing.&quot;Really a sad situation. Catholic Church is wasting it&apos;s power on celebrating&quot;Quinceneras;&quot;Without also having a comperable male adulthood acknowledgment.

Best comment I&apos;ve read in awhile. It&apos;s not about how much money you have, or what race you are. It&apos;s about what&apos;s going on in the home from pre school on up.

Does anybody really keep track of how many criminals are actually raised by criminals?

How many kids turn out to be thugs with parents that just look the other way and don&apos;t pay attention to what is going on in their kids lives?

Whoever dropped the charges on this offender the first time for assault on family member made a big mistake. He will continue to think he can get away with stabbing a human being to solve his problems.

So stabbing your girlfriend at 19 is considered Machismo according to your beliefs? Like someone mentioned before this guy is at the bottom feeder with a very rough upbringing. There is nothing&quot;Macho&quot;about this case!

Well a lot or the majority of crimes here are committed by hispanics but we are in South Texas after all. The majority of people that commit this type of crime come from broken families. Their parents were not around to raise them and no one cared enough to help them become better people. It is a rough life when you are only 12 years old and you don&apos;t have any one looking after you and you have to whatever it takes to eat. These are not mama&apos;s boys either. No one took care of them hence the reason why they have such disregard for laws, both ethical and social standards. Like previous posts before this one. Some of these people are even proud they are&quot;ghetto&quot;unfortunately this is going to be an ongoing trend.

Nice post, Moz. I appreciate your common sense take on issues, and what you wrote is even better than usual.

As you mentioned, my family came from humble beginnings as well. They too were hard-working people who strived to be good parents and stressed the importance of being good, law-abiding citizens. They did without in order to provide the rest of us all with every opportunity to be successful in school and to pursue higher education.

Regardless of time, place, etc., young people need positive role models who encourage and support them and who teach them right from wrong.

Thanks again for some positive words.

Breath Breath it&apos;s OK. Only wish I could make this poor sumBits laugh. The look on his face says he hasn&apos;t had a decent adult ego state conversation complete with laugter with an adult male since the last time he was arrested.

It falls on us to rectify this somehow. Unfair tho it be. As far as I can see, there is no worthier challenge for you and me.

Imagine the people who thought they were bad in high school in that time. Those who didn&apos;t reach their senior year. Most of those didn&apos;t outgrow their gangsta phase and these are the one&apos;s raising these kids. If a parent doesn&apos;t give a crap, how can these kids become a better part of our society?
