Glenn Beck: White=Racist

GLENN: Here’s the thing. I’m so sick of hearing about this race thing. Have you noticed that it is that they are not pointing out things that disagree with their thesis here. For instance, in your own personal identity do you think of yourself as a member of your race first or an American first? I’m agriculture American. You ask me do I consider myself Christian first or an American first? I’m going to say Christian first and here’s why. I say a Christian first because my Christianity, my faith actually builds my faith in this country. My faith in God actually builds the faith in our founding and our founding documents. In my faith, one of our articles of faith is obey the laws of the land. My faith makes me a stronger citizen. My race means nothing. What does your race mean? You think of,&quot;I’m a white person first.&quot;What kind of racism would that be?&quot;I’m a white person, you’re darn right. Then I’m American.&quot;4% of whites think of themselves, their race before their country. 45% of African Americans think of their race first. Americans first, 91% of whites, 46% of blacks. Do you have more in common with you do you have more in common with the people of the same class as you or with the people of the same race? Isn’t this a quintessential racist question?

Who do you have more in common with? People who are in your class or people who are in your race? Class, whites, say 79%. Blacks say 60%. Race, whites say 15%. Blacks say 36%. We shouldn’t be separated by color. You have more in common with those of the same color. Why is that?

There’s this new study out and it’s driving me because it’s you know what? There’s a whole section in this study out that says lists a bunch of statements and asks, does this make you angry. One of them should be, this poll. Does this poll make you angry? Yes! It does. It generally has bad things like companies polluting the environment, does that make you angry. Hmmm. Yeah. Athletes making million dollar salaries, does that make you angry? Hmmm. No hang on just a second. Are they black? The government raising taxes on gasoline, blah, blah, blah. Then some blatantly racist examples: A black family moving next door to where you live. A black person serving as President of the United States. Okay, these are racist. Hello. By the way, the way they present the poll is key. They talk about people having negative feelings towards blacks. If you say you don’t want to have a person living next to you that is black, then yes, you have negative feelings about blacks but are you racist? If this makes you angry: Black leaders asking the government for racial equality in the workplace. I don’t know, that kind of makes me angry. Does that make you angry? I mean, not angry but I’m like, yeah, that kind of pisses me off. Do you know why? It’s a loaded statement. The term&quot;Black leaders,&quot;who does that bring to mind? The self appointed black leaders. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton. That’s who that brings to mind. And Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton? This is the way the question reads to people. People like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton asking the government for their idea of racial equality in the workplace. Does that piss you off? It’s their idea of racial equality. If they wanted a real answer on who was racist, they could have easily worked in, you know, where did the question&quot;African Americans being treated equally in the workplace.&quot;Does it piss you off when African Americans are treated equally in the workplace? No. Of course not. But that’s not what they wanted. You had to re you had to rework and reword the question. What else shows racism? Well, they don’t give their entire formula away but look at some of the questions. Does Barack Obama’s relationship with Reverend Wright his former President show you Barack Obama would be a better President? Now, the question is broken out to whites only, 41% say it makes him a worse President, 2% say better. But all respondents, the ratio is 34:5. So two things are clear from the polling. Jeremiah Wright is viewed very negatively by almost everybody. That’s a good sign for America, the guy who says white people invented the AIDS virus to kill black people, not real popular. Jeremiah Wright is viewed slightly more negative by whites than all races but does that make them racist? Does blacks view him more positively than other races, are they racist because he says that whites invented AIDS to kill blacks. By the way, we can’t answer any of those questions because for some reason or another they didn’t break out the&quot;Blacks only&quot;category. Why not? It’s almost like the study is designed to show whites as racist. Will race influence your vote? 18% say yes. You racist. Unless you break it out. More likely to vote for him? 9. Less likely to vote for him? 9. I guess the people who just want to vote for him because he’s black and not white kind of racist kind of cancels out the person who’s white and just doesn’t want to vote for him because he’s black racist.

Do black people have too much influence? 14% say yes. But take a minute to remember the ad of McCain and all of his houses. Do you remember that? How many times do they hit McCain on how rich he is? There was a story in Drudge Report yesterday: He’s got 450,000 cars. Why did they do that? Because five and a half times as many people think rich, the rich have too much influence. And by the way, do blacks have too much influence? 14% say yes. How many of that 14% go back to the original question about Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson? Black leaders. 86% of whites feel sympathy for blacks at least occasionally, most at least moderately often. 91% feel 91% of whites feel admiration for blacks at least occasionally. The vast majority is at least moderately often. What kind of survey is this? 91% feel admiration for blacks? Have you ever thought,&quot;Gee, I admire those black people an awful lot.&quot;Have you ever thought that? I never have. I have thought, that Condoleezza Rice really is impressive. I have even thought Barack Obama, look where this guy came from. And then I thought, yeah, look where this guy came from. But look where this guy came from. He did it. I have more admiration for the job that he has done than he does. Either that or he just believes he’s the Messiah because you can’t do it but he can. But I’ve never thought, gee, I feel sorry for those blacks; gee, I have admiration for those blacks.

Then they go through a long list of attributes and ask which one describes a specific race. Now, one of the big findings this is the one you are seeing everywhere the big findings is that 13% of whites think lazy applies to blacks, extremely well or very well. Of course, among all voters it’s actually a combined 13%. So whites think lazy applies very well or extremely well by 13% to blacks, 13%. That’s whites. But the combined number is also 13%. So wait a minute here. Assuming that blacks would say zero, Hispanics must be more racist than whites. Or…Hispanics, blacks and whites all by a number of 13% think that lazy describes blacks. Which is it? I don’t know. But somebody, unless it’s perfectly balanced, is more quote/unquote racist than whites are. And by the way, nowhere in this survey did they ask how would you say whites? Would lazy describe whites? No. It’s not in there. And believe me, I’ve met my fair share of white people that are lazy. I’ve been to a fast food restaurant lately. Tried to get my order right. I’ve seen people busting their butt behind the counter, and I’ve seen people who could give a flying crap that they are at work. I don’t know which color I’ve seen more lazy people of, but I know I’ve seen a lot of lazy people. Point is, laziness like racism, not a black/white disease. It’s a human disease. That’s the way it is. But you’re not going to get that from the American media. No, no, not during the election, not before the election, probably not after the election. If he loses, definitely, definitely not after the election.

VOICE: It’s a deadly disease and it’s only getting deadlier. It’s racism. How can you tell if someone you love has racism? Symptoms include frequent use of vulgarity and racial slurs, racial profiling, making baseless accusations, showing favoritism, voting for Republicans, noticing cultural food trends, color based basketball pickup game recruiting and, according to the media, residency in West Virginia. Racism can be difficult to detect in some cases but if you suspect someone you love has this disease, consult your doctor. If you cannot afford a doctor because of racist Republican healthcare policies, simply check the skin color of the patient. If they appear to have a white tone to their skin or think Larry Byrd was the greatest player of all time, they do indeed have racism. Racism, it’s like a racist country club, only white people allowed. This message brought to you by the Damned Whitie Coalition.
