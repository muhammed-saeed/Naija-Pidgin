Description

&quot;Wow! What a super breakfast! McDonalds deluxe breakfast recipe really resembles to a traditional Southern breakfast, if we just exclude the gravy. For fast food, McDonalds breakfast recipe is really cool. I actually like the hotcakes at Mickey D&apos;s because they are so soft. The McDonalds deluxe breakfast recipes we’ve shared with you here is the best breakfast I ever made. The only trouble is, McDonalds stops serving breakfast at 10:00 am and I am never up by that time. SO...I cook recipe of McDonalds deluxe breakfast myself and make it any time I get a craving. In this McDonald breakfast recipe I specially love different flavors of syrup, so I can do that McDonalds breakfast here at home, since McDonalds only has their basic hotcakes syrup. If your kids love to go to a fast food restaurant, serve them this recipe for McDonalds breakfast and tell them this deluxe breakfast is a take-out; they&apos;ll never know the difference, except this breakfast McDonalds recipe is much more fresh and tasty!&quot;
