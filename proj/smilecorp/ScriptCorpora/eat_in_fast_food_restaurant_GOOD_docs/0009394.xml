SALT LAKE CITY—The latest in functional fashion 
comes 
in the form of pants you can eat off of.
In an apparent desire to provide a must-have function, 
Italian design company Acquacalda has created a pair of pants 
that doubles as a table—perfect for those times you 
find yourself wishing you could eat off your lap without 
committing to grease stains on your favorite pair of 
pants.
The denim harem capris have a gray flap attached to the 
front that reportedly stretches out to become a portable 
table when one sits cross-
legged.
&quot;Fashion imposes forms to whom finding a function seems a 
must,&quot; the site reads, lending itself to the notion that 
food-ready pants are more of a &quot;need&quot; than a &quot;want.&quot;
 Would you wear them? 1. Give me Pic Nic Pants or give me death. 2. I wouldn&apos;t be caught dead wearing these. Would you wear them? 1. Give me Pic Nic Pants or give me death. 2. I wouldn&apos;t be caught dead wearing these. 
&quot;Pic nic pants take advantage of the usual cross-legged 
position to become a comfortable surface useful for 
consumption of a meal outdoors,&quot; it continues.
The pants include an &quot;orientable pocket&quot; for drinks, as 
well.
The pants are real—no April Fools&apos; Day joke, here—but there&apos;s no word on how much a pair costs. And 
as of now, the idea doesn&apos;t seem to be catching on in the 
U.S.: according to an MSNBC poll, only 6 percent of 
respondents would wear the pants.
