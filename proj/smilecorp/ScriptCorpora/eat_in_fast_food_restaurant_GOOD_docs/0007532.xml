 In search of a large diameter plastic drinking straw

 Random Thoughts 

by Jean 
 
I wonder why disposable drinking straws often come in the same sizes, is there some kind of physics behind the average size width of a straw that makes it more drinkable?

I actually prefer a large or LARGER diameter disposable plastic drinking straw then the ones for sale at the retail stores.  Why?  I like things big!  Actually this topic came about after a trip the local Sam’s Club.  My brother had gotten a fruit smoothie from their concession and was sucking the hell out of the straw trying to drink his rather thick drink.

The problem with the average size diameter straws which seems to be at about 1/4″in diameter is that real fruit pieces in a fruit smoothie often get lodged in the straw.  At that point, you have a few options to consider.

Option #1–you blow out the stuck fruit and resume your sucking.

Option #2–you continue to suck hoping you can conquer the fruit bit by moving it up through the narrow opening and most likely give yourself a headache while doing it.

or Option #3–you say a few #$%$^$^ words and remove the straw and lid and gulp down your drink like the animal that you are. :lmao:

There has been in the past where I’ve gone to a fast food restaurant where their drinking straws were actually a bit wider than the norm. I can’t remember if it’s McDonalds or Wendy’s or a number of other ones. I just know that when I came across a“good”straw in my opinion, it certainly makes drinking a lot more enjoyable….and quicker too!

Could it be that fast food restaurants employ the wider diameter drinking straws so that their patrons will be able to drink their soft drinks much faster thus adding to their overall gratification of being instantly satisfied by the entire“fast food”appeal?

I’ve worked in a fast food restaurant before, my very first job as a teenager many many years ago. I’ve seen customers use two straws in their drinks, perhaps trying to drink their cups of liquid fast! I’ve done that before myself, not because I was in some kind of thirst induced hurry but because I was sharing a drink with someone, usually a child, that wanted the novelty of having their OWN straw. Then you forget which straw is yours and end up sipping out of both at the same time.

It definitely is faster to use two straws but it takes more sucking to“prime”the liquid upwards. This may be why I wonder if there’s some kind of physics involved in determining the“ideal”diameter size of the average straw. :blink:

If only someone would invent a larger diameter straw, maybe like 1/2″wide, something that would be perfect for smoothies and milkshakes. They can call it THE SMOOTHIE STRAW! I wonder how costly it would be for a straw manufacturer to change their calibrations to make a wider straw. But then, one has to ask the question of“how are straws made?”I wonder if there’s a mold template for each of the diameters of choice for the straws. I’ll have to google that later to see how they are actually made.

But for now, I just want to say that it’d be real nice to have a larger diameter drinking straw that’s cost effective, disposable, and if it’s flexible, that’s even better! Who doesn’t love a bendy straw? Multi-colors would be great as my nieces love to pick out their own color of straws to use.

For the time being, I may have to drop in at some of the local fast food restaurants to get some free straws to see if they are closer to what I’m looking for.
