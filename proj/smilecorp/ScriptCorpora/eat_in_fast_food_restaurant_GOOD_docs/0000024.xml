Fast Food - Friend or Foe?
 
 Oct 14, 2007 1 2,221 
 
Fast food - just fun, or the first step on a slippery road to dietary disaster? Imagine ... it&apos;s been a long day at work and you&apos;re too tired to think, never mind cook. Your child&apos;s too hungry to wait and too cranky to sit in a restaurant and behave well. Those golden arches or that drive through window are calling to you, promising a speed, inexpensive and just about effortless family meal.

But fast food isn&apos;t particularly good food and as you watch your toddler happily dunking greasy chips and chicken nuggets into sugary ketchup and sauce, you determine that you&apos;ll be stronger net time and resist the temptation of a fast food fix, knowing deep inside, that this is a resolution you&apos;re doomed to break.

Don&apos;t beat yourself up about his. Fast food franchises are there to answer our most basic need - to eat. And when you&apos;re an exausted working parent, you&apos;re only human for giving in from time to time. It&apos;s important that you keep your fast food meals limited though to avoid compromising your own and your family&apos;s wellbeing. Try to stick to the following guidelines:

Don&apos;t let fast food become a habit. Limit your visits to outlets to a couple of times a month at most. Make those fast food meals a special treat that you and your children can enjoy together.
Ask for nutritional information. Many fast food restaurants will provide, upon request, a nutritional breakdown of their menu items and this can be used to help you guide your selections. 
Try to be as &quot;healthy&quot; as possible. More and more fast food chains are offering &quot;lighter&quot; &quot;leaner&quot; and &quot;healthier&quot; options across their menus. Pizza is a nutritionally sound selection as is a baked potato and broccoli. Hunt around at the salad bar and as well as all those mayonnaise-drenched salads you&apos;ll probably be able to find grated carrots, chick-peas and green and leafy accompaniments to your meal. Frozen yoghurt is a good choice for dessert and why not order a carton of milk or orange guice instead of soda or a high fat milk shake. This will help make your meal a lot healthier.

Compensate at home - OK, maybe lunch wasn&apos;t nutritious, but you can provide an after-dinner extra. Snuggle up with a great book from Scruffy&apos;s Bookshop and nibble on carrot, fruit or a whole grain muffin as a treat when you get home.

Finally - don&apos;t spoil your outing by feeling too guilty. If you&apos;re not overdoing the excursions to fast food outlets, then you&apos;re not putting your children&apos;s health in danger. So hold the guilt, relax and enjoy.
