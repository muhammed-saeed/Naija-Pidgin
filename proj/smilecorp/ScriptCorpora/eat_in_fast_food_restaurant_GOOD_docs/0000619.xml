 Subject: New York.
Miss Annabell has just returned from her big trip to New York City and was having refreshments on the front porch of her daddy&apos;s mansion with her southern bell friends. She tells them the stories of her trip as they stare spellbound.
&quot;You just wouldn&apos;t believe what they have there in New York City,&quot;says Miss Annabell.&quot;They have men there who kiss other men on the lips.&quot;
Miss Annabell&apos;s friends fan themselves and say,&quot;Oh my! Oh my!&quot;
&quot;They call them homosexuals,&quot;proclaims Miss Annabell.
&quot;Oh my! Oh my,&quot;proclaim the girls as they fan themselves.
&quot;They also have women there in New York City who kiss other women on the lips!&quot;
&quot;Oh my! Oh my,&quot;exclaim the girls.&quot;What do they call them?&quot;they asked.
&quot;They call them lesbians,&quot;says Miss Annabell.
&quot;They also have men who kiss women between the legs, there in New York City,&quot;sighs Miss Annabell.
&quot;Oh my! Oh my! Oh my,&quot;exclaim the girls as the sit on the edge of their chairs and fan themselves even faster.&quot;What do they call them?&quot;they ask in unison.
Miss Annabell leans forward and says in a hush,&quot;Why when I caught my breath, I called him &apos;Precious&apos;!&quot;

A young boy comes home from school and his mother says&quot;What did you do today?
To which the boy says&quot;oh the usual, I had a math test, I got an A in Spelling and I had sex with my English teacher.&quot;
The mother, aghast, doesn&apos;t know what to say! She stems and stammers and finally angrily she says&quot;go in and tell your father what you just told me!&quot;
The boy goes into see his father and says&quot;gee mom sure is mad.&quot;The father says&quot;why?&quot;
&quot;I just told her what I did in school today. I had a math test, I got an A in spelling and I had sex with my English teacher.&quot;Well the father is beside himself with joy. He gives his son a nudge and a wink and says&quot;congratulations--you passed a milestone.&quot;I tell you what--let&apos;s go out and celebrate. We&apos;ll have some ice cream and then buy you a new bike.&quot;
To which the boy says--&quot;The ice cream sounds great, but can we hold off on the bike a few days--my ass is killing me.&quot;

 Subject: Manhole cover.
A passer-by is walking down the street and sees a man jumping up and down on a manhole cover yelling&quot;86, 86, 86&quot;.
The passer-by asks the man,&quot;Excuse me, but why are you jumping up and down on this manhole cover and yelling &apos;86, 86, 86&apos;?&quot;
The man says,&quot;Well, I can&apos;t tell you that, but if you really want to know, I can let you go under there and find out.
The passer-by thinks for a moment, then his curiosity gets the better of him, and he says,&quot;Okay.&quot;The man lifts the manhole cover, the passer-by steps into the manhole,
and the man puts the manhole cover back and starts jumping up and down on it yelling&quot;87, 87, 87&quot;...

 Subject: We can do anything...
Old Technology ... Proof
German scientists dug 50 meters down in the underground and discovered small pieces of copper. After studying these pieces for a long time, Germany announced that the ancient Germans 25,000 years ago had a nation-wide telephone network.
Naturally, the Russian government was not that easily impressed. They ordered their own scientists to dig even deeper. 100 meters down they found small pieces of glass and they soon announced that the ancient Russians 35,000 years ago already had a nation-wide fibre net.
Swedish scientists were outraged. They dug 200 meters down in the underground, but found absolutely nothing. They happily concluded that the ancient Swedes 55,000 years ago had cellular telephones.

 Subject: A honeymooning couple.
A honeymooning couple was passing through Louisiana. When they were approaching Lafayette, they started arguing about the pronunciation of the town. They argued back and forth until they got to the town, where they decided to stop for lunch.
As they stood at the counter, the man said,&quot;Before we order, could you please settle an argument for us. Would you very slowly pronounce where we are&quot;.
The guy behind the corner leaned over and said,&quot;Burrrrrrrr gerrrrrrr Kiiiiing&quot;

 Subject: An out-of-towner.
An out-of-towner drove his car into a ditch in a desolated area. Luckily, a local farmer came to help with his big strong horse named Buddy.
He hitched Buddy up to the car and yelled,&quot;Pull, Nellie, pull!&quot;Buddy didn&apos;t move.
Then the farmer hollered,&quot;Pull, Buster, pull!&quot;Buddy didn&apos;t respond.
Once more the farmer commanded,&quot;Pull, Coco, pull!&quot;Nothing.
Then the farmer nonchalantly said,&quot;Pull, Buddy, pull!&quot;And the horse easily dragged the car out of the ditch.
The motorist was most appreciative and very curious. He asked the farmer why he called his horse by the wrong name three times.
The farmer said,&quot;Oh, Buddy is blind and if he thought he was the only one pulling, he wouldn&apos;t even try!&quot;

 Subject: A guy driving.
A guy driving a Yugo pulls up at a stoplight next to a Rolls-Royce. The driver of the Yugo rolls down his window and shouts to the driver of the Rolls,&quot;Hey, buddy, that&apos;s a nice car. You got a phone in your Rolls? I&apos;ve got one in my Yugo!&quot;
The driver of Rolls looks over and says simply,&quot;Yes I have a phone.&quot;
The driver of the Yugo says,&quot;Cool! Hey, you got a fridge in there, too? I&apos;ve got a fridge in the back seat of my Yugo!&quot;
The driver of the Rolls, looking annoyed, says,&quot;Yes, I have a refrigerator.&quot;
The driver of the Yugo says,&quot;That&apos;s great, man! Hey, you got a TV in there, too? You know, I got a TV in the back seat of my Yugo!&quot;
The driver of the Rolls, looking very annoyed by now, says,&quot;Of course I have a television. A Rolls-Royce is the finest luxury car in the world!&quot;
The driver of the Yugo says,&quot;Very cool car! Hey, you got a bed in there, too? I got a bed in the back of my Yugo!&quot;
Upset that he did not have a bed, the driver of the Rolls-Royce sped away, and went straight to the dealer, where he promptly ordered that a bed be installed in the back of the Rolls.
The next morning, the driver of the Rolls picked up the car, and the bed looked superb, with satin sheets and brass trim.
It was clearly a bed fit for a Rolls Royce. So the driver of the Rolls begins searching for the Yugo, and he drove all day. Finally, late at night, he finds the Yugo parked, with all the windows fogged up from the inside.
The driver of the Rolls got out and knocked on the Yugo. When there wasn&apos;t any answer, he knocked and knocked, and eventually the owner stuck his head out, soaking wet.
&quot;I now have a bed in the back of my Rolls-Royce,&quot;the driver of the Rolls stated arrogantly.
The driver of the Yugo looked at him and said,&quot;You got me out of the shower to tell me THIS?!?!&quot;

According to our inside contacts the Japanese banking crisis shows no signs of ameliorating. If anything, it&apos;s getting worse.
Following last week&apos;s news that Origami Bank had folded, we are hearing that Sumo Bank has gone belly up and Bonsai Bank plans to cut back some of its branches. Karaoke Bank is up for sale and is (you guessed it!) going for a song.
Meanwhile, shares in Kamikaze Bank have nose-dived and 500 back office staff at Karate Bank got the chop. Analysts report that there is something fishy going on at Sushi Bank and staff there fear they may get a raw deal.

After shopping in a mall, a couple returns to find their car has been stolen. They go to the police station to make a full report.
Then, a detective drives them back to the parking lot to see if any evidence can be found at the scene of the crime. To their amazement, the car has been returned.
There is an envelope on the windshield with a note of apology and two tickets to a music concert.
The note reads,&quot;I apologize for taking your car, but my wife was having a baby and I had to hot-wire your ignition to rush her to the hospital.
Please forgive the inconvenience. Here are two tickets for tonight&apos;s concert of Garth Brooks, the country-and-western music star.&quot;
Their faith in humanity restored, the couple attend the concert and return home late. They find their house has been robbed.
Valuable goods have been taken from throughout the house, from basement to attic. And, there is a note on the door reading,&quot;Well, you still have your car.

I stopped at a fast food restaurant, intrigued by a sign which offered fat free fries.
I decided to give them a try, but I was dismayed when the clerk pulled a batch of fries from the fryer dripping with fat, and then put a bag of these fries in with my order.

 Subject: Golden wedding anniversary.
A couple was celebrating their golden wedding anniversary.
Their domestic tranquility had long been the talk of the town.
A local newspaper reporter was inquiring as to the secret of their long and happy marriage.
&quot;Well, it dates back to our honeymoon,&quot;explained the lady.
&quot;We visited the Grand Canyon and took a trip down to the bottom of the canyon by pack mule.
We hadn&apos;t gone too far when my husband&apos;s mule stumbled.
My husband quietly said &apos;That&apos;s once.&apos; We proceeded a little farther when the mule stumbled again.
Once more my husband quietly said, &apos;That&apos;s twice.&apos; We hadn&apos;t gone a half-mile when the mule stumbled a third time.
My husband took a pistol from his pocket and shot him.
I started to protest over his treatment of the mule when he looked at me and quietly said &apos;That&apos;s once.&apos;&quot;

 Subject: Grandpa.
My grandfather worked in a blacksmith shop when he was a boy, and he used to tell me, when I was a little boy myself, how he had toughened himself up so he could stand the rigors of blacksmithing.
One story was how he had developed his arm and shoulder muscles. He said he would stand outside behind the house and, with a 5 pound potato sack in each hand, extend his arms straight out to his sides and hold them there as long as he could.
After awhile he tried 10 pound potato sacks, then 50 pound potato sacks and finally he got to where he could lift a 100 pound potato sack in each hand and hold his arms straight out for more than a full minute!
Next, he started putting potatoes in the sacks.

 Subject: Networking.
Bill Gates died and, much to everyone&apos;s surprise, went to Heaven.
When he got there, he had to wait in the reception area.
Heaven&apos;s reception area was the size of Massachusetts. There were literally millions of people milling about, living in tents with nothing to do all day. Food and water were being distributed from the backs of trucks, while staffers with clipboards slowly worked their way through the crowd. Booze and drugs were being passed around. Fights were commonplace. Sanitation conditions were appalling. All in all, the scene looked like Woodstock gone metastatic.
Bill lived in a tent for three weeks until, finally, one of the staffers approached him. The staffer was a young man in his late teens, face scarred with acne. He was wearing a blue T-shirt with the words TEAM PETER emblazoned on it in large yellow lettering.
&quot;Hello,&quot;said the staffer in a bored voice that could have been the voice of any clerk in any overgrown bureaucracy.&quot;My name is Gabriel and I&apos;ll be your induction coordinator.&quot;Bill started to ask a question, but Gabriel interrupted him.&quot;No, I&apos;m not the Archangel Gabriel. I&apos;m just a guy from Philadelphia named Gabriel who died in a car wreck at the age of 17. Now give me your name, last name first, unless you were Chinese in which case it&apos;s first name first.&quot;
&quot;Gates, Bill.&quot;Gabriel started searching though the sheaf of papers on his clipboard, looking for Bill&apos;s Record of Earthly Works.
&quot;What&apos;s going on here?&quot;asked Bill.&quot;Why are all these people here? Where&apos;s Saint Peter? Where are the Pearly Gates?&quot;
Gabriel ignored the questions until he located Bill&apos;s records. Then Gabriel looked up in surprise.&quot;It says here that you were the President of a large software company. Is that right?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Well then, do the math chip-head! When this Saint Peter business started, it was an easy gig. Only a hundred or so people died every day, and Peter could handle it all by himself, no problem. But now there are over five billion people on earth. Jesus, when God said to, &apos;go forth and multiply,&apos; he didn&apos;t say &apos;like rabbits!&apos; With that large a population, ten thousand people die every hour. Over a quarter-million people a day. Do you think Peter can meet them all personally?&quot;
&quot;I guess not.&quot;
&quot;You guess right. So Peter had to franchise the operation. Now, Peter is the CEO of Team Peter Enterprises, Inc. He just sits in the corporate headquarters and sets policy. Franchisees like me handle the actual inductions.&quot;Gabriel looked though his paperwork some more, and then continued.&quot;Your paperwork seems to be in order. And with a background like yours, you&apos;ll be getting a plum job assignment.&quot;
&quot;Job assignment?&quot;
&quot;Of course. Did you expect to spend the rest of eternity sitting on your ass and drinking ambrosia? Heaven is a big operation. You have to pull your weight around here!&quot;Gabriel took out a triplicate form, had Bill signed at the bottom, and then tore out the middle copy and handed it to Bill.&quot;Take this down to induction center #23 and meet up with your occupational orientator. His name is Abraham.&quot;
Bill started to ask a question, but Gabriel interrupted him,&quot;No, he&apos;s not that Abraham.&quot;
Bill walked down a muddy trail for ten miles until he came to induction center #23. He met with Abraham after a mere six-hour wait.
&quot;Heaven is centuries behind in building its data processing infrastructure,&quot;explained Abraham.&quot;As you&apos;ve seen, we&apos;re still doing everything on paper. It takes us a week just to process new entries.&quot;
&quot;I had to wait *three* weeks,&quot;said Bill. Abraham stared at Bill angrily, and Bill realized that he&apos;d made a mistake. Even in Heaven, it&apos;s best not to contradict a bureaucrat.&quot;Well,&quot;Bill offered,&quot;maybe that Bosnia thing has you guys backed up.&quot;
Abraham&apos;s look of anger faded to mere annoyance.&quot;Your job will be to supervise Heaven&apos;s new data processing center. We&apos;re building the largest computing facility in creation. Half a million computers connected by a multi-segment fiber optic network, all running into a back-end server network with a thousand CPUs on a gigabyte channel. Fully fault tolerant. Fully distributed processing. The works.&quot;
Bill could barely contain his excitement.&quot;Wow! What a great job! This is really Heaven!&quot;
&quot;We&apos;re just finishing construction, and we&apos;ll be starting operations soon. Would you like to go see the center now?&quot;
&quot;You bet!&quot;
Abraham and Bill caught the shuttle bus and went to Heaven&apos;s new data processing center. It was a truly huge facility, a hundred times bigger than the Astrodome. Workmen were crawling all over the place, getting the miles of fiber optic cables properly installed. But the center was dominated by the computers. Half a million computers, arranged neatly row-by-row, half a million,...
.Macintoshes!!!!!
..all running Claris software! Not a PC in sight! Not a single byte of Microsoft code!
The thought of spending the rest of eternity using products that he had spent his whole life working to destroy was too much for Bill.&quot;What about PCs???&quot;he exclaimed.
&quot;What about Windows??? What about Excel??? What about Word???&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re forgetting something,&quot;said Abraham.
&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;asked Bill plaintively.
&quot;This is Heaven,&quot;explained Abraham.&quot;We need a computer system that&apos;s heavenly to use. If you want to build a data processing center based on PCs running Windows, then,...

 Subject: The Pilot.
You&apos;ve all heard of the Air Force&apos;s ultra-high-security, super-secret base in Nevada, known simply as&quot;Area 51?&quot;
Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their&quot;secret&quot;base. They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room.
The pilot&apos;s story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation.
By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn&apos;t a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying&quot;you-did-not-see-a-base&quot;briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.
The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP&apos;s surrounded the plane... only this time there were two people in the plane.
The same pilot jumped out and said,&quot;Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!&quot;

 Subject: Black-African Americans.

An airliner is traveling cross country when the pilot runs into mechanical difficulties.
The only way to keep their altitude is to get rid of some excess weight.
So he asks the stewardess to get rid of all of the baggage in the cargo hold, which she does.
She then goes back up to the cockpit to let him know that it was taken care of.
The pilot said that they still were too heavy, and if they were to make it they&apos;d have to get rid of more weight.
The stewardess told him all that was left was the passengers.
The pilot told her that they would have to get rid of some.
She was appalled,&quot;How do we decide who goes?&quot;
The pilot replied,&quot;We&apos;ll do it alphabetically!&quot;
She said,&quot;I can&apos;t do it!!&quot;
So the pilot went back to explain to the passengers what was going on, and what had to be done.
The passengers were all afraid.
&quot;Okay,&quot;said the pilot,&quot;here we go.
We&apos;ll start with &apos;A,&apos;--all African Americans off the plane.&quot;
Then he goes,&quot;&apos;B&apos;--all Blacks off the plane.&quot;
Then,&quot;&apos;C&apos;--all Coloreds off the plane.&quot;
Meanwhile there&apos;s a young boy and his father sitting in their seats who happen to be black.
The young boy looks up at his father and says,&quot;Dad, aren&apos;t we Black-African Americans?&quot;
The father replies,&quot;No, not today, son. Today we&apos;re niggers.&quot;

Imagine that each leader of the United Soviet Socialist Republic finds himself on a train in the middle of nowhere, when suddenly the tracks have come to an end. What instructions would he give to his entourage?
Lenin: Go infuse the peasants with revolutionary spirit and organize them to build new rails to carry our train forward!
Stalin: Round up the peasants, lay down their bodies before the train and we shall ride over them.
Khrushchev: Go out, tear up the tracks from behind the train, set them down in front and we shall continue our journey.
Brezhnev: Pull all the curtains in the carriage, rock back and forth and make clicking noises.
Gorbachev: We have glasnost now. Run outside and shout at the top of your lungs:&quot;There are no rails!&quot;
Yeltsin: Give the tracks, the train, and the passengers back to their original homelands!

 Subject: QUOTES From The 1950&apos;s.
Quotes You May Have Heard In The 1950&apos;s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.&quot;I&apos;ll tell you one thing, if things keep going the way they are, it&apos;s going to be impossible to buy a week&apos;s groceries for $20.&quot;
2.&quot;Have you seen the new cars coming out next year? It won&apos;t be long when $5000 will only buy a used one.&quot;
3.&quot;If cigarettes keep going up in price, I&apos;m going to quit. A quarter a pack is ridiculous.&quot;
4.&quot;Did you hear the post office is thinking about charging a dime just to mail a letter?&quot;
5.&quot;The Government is wanting to get its hands on everything. Pretty soon it&apos;s going to be impossible to run a family business or farm.&quot;
6.&quot;If they raise the hourly minimum wage to $1, nobody will be able to hire outside help at the store.&quot;
7.&quot;When I first started driving, who would have thought gas would someday cost 50 cents a gallon. Guess we&apos;d be better off leaving the car in the garage.&quot;
8.&quot;Kids today are impossible. Those duck tail hair cuts make it impossible to stay groomed. Next thing you know, boys will be wearing their hair as long as the girls.&quot;
9.&quot;Also, their music drives me wild. This &apos;Rock Around The Clock&apos; thing is nothing but racket.&quot;
10.&quot;I&apos;m afraid to send my kids to the movies any more. Ever since they let Clark Gable get by with saying &apos;damn&apos; in &apos;Gone With he Wind,&apos; it seems every movie has a &apos;hell&apos; or &apos;damn&apos; in it.&quot;
11.&quot;Also, it won&apos;t be long until couples are sleeping in the same bed in the movies. What is this world coming to?&quot;
12.&quot;Pretty soon you won&apos;t be able to buy a good 10 cent cigar.&quot;
13.&quot;I read the other day where some scientist thinks it&apos;s possible to put a man on the moon by the end of the of the century. They even have some fellows they call astronauts preparing for it down in Texas.&quot;
14.&quot;Did you see where some baseball player just signed a contract for $75,000 a year just to play ball? It wouldn&apos;t surprise me if someday they&apos;ll be making more than the president.&quot;
15.&quot;Do you suppose television will ever reach our part of the country?&quot;
16.&quot;I never thought I&apos;d see the day all our kitchen appliances would be electric. They are even making electric typewriters now.&quot;
17.&quot;It&apos;s too bad things are so tough nowadays. I see where a few married women are having to work to make ends meet.&quot;
18.&quot;It won&apos;t be long before young couples are going to have to hire someone to watch their kids so they can both work.&quot;
19.&quot;I&apos;ll tell you one thing. If my kid ever talks back to me, they won&apos;t be able to sit down for a week.&quot;
20.&quot;Did you know the new church in town is allowing women to wear pants to their service?&quot;
21.&quot;Next thing you know is, the government will start paying us not to grow crops.&quot;
22.&quot;I&apos;m just afraid the Volkswagen car is going to open the door to a whole lot of foreign business.&quot;
23.&quot;Thank goodness I won&apos;t live to see the day when the Government takes half our income in taxes. I sometimes wonder if we are electing the best people to congress.&quot;
24.&quot;Why in the world would you want to send your daughter to college. Isn&apos;t she going to get married? It would be different if she could be a doctor or a lawyer.&quot;
25.&quot;I just hate to see the young people smoking. As I tell my kids,&quot;Don&apos;t take a cigarette from ANYONE. You never know what might be in it.&quot;
26.&quot;The drive-in restaurant is convenient in nice weather, but I seriously doubt they will ever catch on.&quot;
27.&quot;There is no sense going to St. Louis or Omaha anymore for a weekend. It costs nearly $15 a night to stay in a hotel.&quot;
28.&quot;Anymore no one can afford to be sick, $35 a day in the hospital is too rich for my blood.&quot;
29.&quot;If a few idiots want to risk their necks flying across the country that&apos;s fine, but nothing will ever replace trains.&quot;
30.&quot;I don&apos;t know about you but if they raise the price of coffee to 15 cents, I&apos;ll just have to drink mine at home.&quot;
31.&quot;If they think I&apos;ll pay 50 cents for a hair cut, forget it. I&apos;ll have my wife learn to cut hair.&quot;
32.&quot;We won&apos;t be going out much anymore. Our baby sitter informed us she now wants 25 cents an hour. Kids think money grows on trees.&quot;
33.&quot;Cars which dim their lights by sensors, automatic transmissions, and who knows what else? Pretty soon they will have electric windows.&quot;
34.&quot;Unbelieveable, an outfit called Byrdseye has packaged frozen peas. Who the heck would buy frozen food?&quot;

A lawyer driving by a Texas ranch hit and killed a calf that was crossing the road. The driver went to the owner of the calf and explained what had happened. He then asked what the animal was worth.
&quot;Oh, about $200 today,&quot;said the rancher.&quot;But in six years it would have been worth $900. So $900 is what I&apos;m out.&quot;
The lawyer sat down and wrote out a check and handed it to the farmer.

But surely there is something that I could do just for you.&quot;
&quot;There is one thing.
But it&apos;s really small, and not worth your time,&quot;said the nun.

Ten were men, one was a woman.
They all decided that one person should let go, because if they didn&apos;t, the rope would break and everyone would die.
No one could decide who should go. Finally the woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children, giving in at work and not receiving anything in return.
When she finished speaking, all the men started clapping...
Never underestimate the power of a woman.

An Octogenarian who was an avid golfer moved to a new town and joined the local Country Club. He went to the Club for the first time to play but was told there wasn&apos;t anybody he could play with because they were already out on the course.
He repeated several times that he really wanted to play. Finally the Assistant Pro said he would play with him and would give him a 12-stroke handicap. The 80 year old said,&quot;I really don&apos;t need a handicap as I have been playing quite well. The only real problem I have is getting out of sand traps.&quot;
So they both set out to play and the old man did play well.
Coming onto the 18th the old man had a long drive, but it landed in one of the sand traps around the hole. Shooting from the sand trap he hit a very high ball which landed on the green and rolled into the hole!
The Pro walked over to the sand trap where his opponent was still standing. He said&quot;Nice shot, but I thought you said you have a problem getting out of sand traps?&quot;
Replied the Octogenarian,&quot;I do! Please give me a hand.&quot;

She replied in crazed anger and without hesitation,&quot;I can&apos;t throw that far!&quot;

 Subject: Inner Peace.
I am passing this on to you because it definitely worked for me. By following the simple advice I read in an article, I have finally found inner peace...
It said: &quot;The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started&quot;.
So, today I have finished one bottle of vodka, a bottle of Gin, a bottle of wine, a bottle of Schnapps, a carton of ciggies, all of my Prozac and a big box of chocolates.
Damn, ...... I feel better already!
You can pass this on to all those you think may be in need of Inner Peace...

 Subject: THE MISSING DOLLAR!
3 men go into a motel. The man behind the desk said the room is $30, so each man paid $10 and went to the room.
A while later the man behind the desk realized the room was only $25, so he sent the bellboy to the 3 guys&apos; room with $5 on the way the bellboy couldn&apos;t figure out how to split $5 evenly between 3 men, so he gave each man a $1 and kept the other $2 for himself.
This meant that the 3 men each only paid $9 for the room, which is a total of $27, add the $2 that the bellboy kept = $29.
Where is the other dollar?
Let me know if you work it out?

 Subject: Make Anybody Faint!
The man passed out in a dead faint as he came out of his front door onto the porch. Someone called 911.
When the paramedics arrived, they helped him regain consciousness and asked if he knew what caused him to faint.
&quot;It was enough to make anybody faint,&quot;he said.&quot;My son asked me for the keys to the garage, and instead of driving the car out, he came out with the lawn mower.&quot;

 Subject: Your Baby?
Amy, our daughter-in-law, was out shoping while our son Peter stayed at home with their infant son. In the supermarket checkout line, a woman behind Amy asked,&quot;How old is your baby?&quot;
&quot;Six weeks,&quot;Amy answered,&quot;but how did you know I have a baby?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot;the woman said smiling,&quot;I&apos;ve been watching you rock your grocery cart.&quot;

 Subject: Texas Trooper.
Two guys are driving through Texas when they get pulled over by a state trooper. The trooper walks up, taps on the window with his nightstick, the driver rolls down the window, and the trooper smacks him in the head with the stick.
The driver says,&quot;Why&apos;d you do that?&quot;
The trooper says,&quot;You&apos;re in Texas, son. When I pull you over, you&apos;ll have your license ready.&quot;
Driver says,&quot;I&apos;m sorry, officer, I&apos;m not from around here.&quot;
The trooper runs a check on the guy&apos;s license, and he&apos;s clean. He gives the guy his license back and walks around to the passenger side and taps on the window. The passenger rolls his window down, and the trooper smacks him with the nightstick.
The passenger says,&quot;What&apos;d you do that for?&quot;
The cop says,&quot;Just making your wishes come true.&quot;
The passenger says,&quot;Huh?&quot;
The cop says,&quot;I know that two miles down the road you&apos;re gonna say, &apos;I wish that cop would&apos;ve tried that with me!&apos;&quot;

 Subject: Bill Gates.
Bill Gates&apos; Speech to Mt. Whitney High School in Visalia, California.
Rule 1: Life is not fair-get used to it.
Rule 2: The world won&apos;t care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.
Rule 3: You will NOT make $40,000 a year right out of high school. You won&apos;t be a vice-president with a car phone until you earn both.
Rule 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.
Rule 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping- they called it opportunity.
Rule 6: If you mess up, it&apos;s not your parents&apos; fault, so don&apos;t whine about your mistakes, learn from them.
Rule 7: Before you were born, your parents weren&apos;t as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents&apos; generation, try delousing the closet in your own room.
Rule 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. In some schools they have abolished failing grades and they&apos;ll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn&apos;t bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.
Rule 9: Life is not divided into semesters. You don&apos;t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time.
Rule 10: Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.
Rule 11: Be nice to nerds. Chances are you&apos;ll end up working for one.

 Subject: The Buglar.
A man went to the Police Station wishing to speak with the burglar who had broken into his house the night before.
&quot;You&apos;ll get your chance in court,&quot;said the Desk Sergeant.
&quot;No, no, no!&quot;said the man.&quot;I want to know how he got into the house without waking my wife. I&apos;ve been trying to do that for years!&quot;

 Subject: Travel Agent.
As reported by an anonymous travel agent:
I got a call from a woman who wanted to go to Capetown. I started to explain the length of the flight and the passport information when she interrupted me with&quot;I&apos;m not trying to make you look stupid, but Cape Town is in Massachusetts.&quot;
Without trying to make her look like the stupid one, I calmly explained,&quot;Cape Cod is in Massachusetts, Capetown is in Africa.&quot;Her response... click.

 Subject: Buddy.
An out-of-towner drove his car into a ditch in a desolated area. Luckily, a local farmer came to help with his big strong horse, named Buddy. He hitched Buddy up to the car and yelled,&quot;Pull, Nellie, pull!&quot;Buddy didn&apos;t move.
Then the farmer hollered,&quot;Pull, Buster, pull!&quot;Buddy didn&apos;t respond.
Once more the farmer commanded,&quot;Pull, Coco, pull!&quot;Nothing.
Then the farmer nonchalantly said,&quot;Pull, Buddy, pull!&quot;And the horse easily dragged the car out of the ditch.
The motorist was most appreciative and very curious. He asked the farmer why he called his horse by the wrong name three times.
The farmer said,&quot;Oh, Buddy is blind and if he thought he was the only one pulling, he wouldn&apos;t even try.&quot;

 Subject: A Clean Glass?
Two men sit down in a smart restaurant and a snooty waiter comes over to take their order.
&quot;Sirs what can I get you?&quot;enquires the waiter.
&quot;A glass of orange juice,&quot;says Mr Smith.
&quot;A glass of orange juice for me too&quot;says Mr Jones,&quot;but please make sure the glass is clean.&quot;
The waiter stalks off in a disagreeable manner, and eventually comes back with two glasses of orange juice.
&quot;So,&quot;he then inquires,&quot;which one of you wanted the clean glass?&quot;
