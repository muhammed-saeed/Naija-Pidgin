Military private charged in Nanaimo restaurant heist
 CBC  –  Fri, 6 Apr, 2012 
A Canadian Forces private has been charged and a second is accused of breaking into a restaurant in Nanaimo, B.C., last Christmas and making off with a large quantity of cash.

One of the suspects, 20-year-old Pte. Cory Damian Wagner, was arrested on Wednesday in his home in Nanaimo. Wagner has been charged with break and enter, and theft over $5,000, and one count of uttering threats.

Nanaimo RCMP Const. Gary O&apos;Brien said Friday that the charges stem from a break-in at a local fast food restaurant on Dec. 24, in which a &quot;large quantity of money&quot; was taken.

O&apos;Brien said that another 20-year-old man was also taken into custody in relation to the investigation.

The second man has not been formally charged with any crime but O&apos;Brien alleged that when police arrested him on Wednesday, officers found six firearms and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition in his possession.

The second suspect &quot;did possess licences for the firearms, however, several of the firearms were not properly secured and they did not have trigger locks. None of the ammunition was properly secured,&quot; O&apos;Brien said in a written statement.

O&apos;Brien said the second man could be facing up to 13 Criminal Code charges, including two counts of careless storage of a firearm, and eight counts of possession of prohibited devices.

He could also face charges relating to the break-in, O&apos;Brien said.

Major Dan Thomas, speaking for the 39 Canadian Brigade Group, said the weapons that police found did not belong to the military.

&quot;Our weapons are very carefully controlled and stored, and issued only for things like exercises and immediately restored,&quot; Thomas said.

Thomas said the suspect facing weapons charges is a reservist member.

Thomas also said that Wagner — who is not currently facing weapons charges — had recently become a member of the regular forces.

Both suspects are in police custody and are scheduled to appear in Nanaimo provincial court on Tuesday to face the allegations.

None of the money taken from the restaurant on Christmas Eve has yet been recovered.
