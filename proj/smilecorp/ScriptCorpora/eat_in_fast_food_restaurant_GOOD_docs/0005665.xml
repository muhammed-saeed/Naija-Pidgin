1) Sonic Menu: When you click on MENU on the top of the page at the Sonic web site a small menu is displayed, when you click on the menu it is enlarged, and if you click again on a specific item full nutrition info for that item is displayed as well as suggestions for side orders.
2) Sonic’s Nutrition Calculator : This online tool lets you select a variety of menu items to create a meal. The total nutrition and caloric information is then provided to you.
