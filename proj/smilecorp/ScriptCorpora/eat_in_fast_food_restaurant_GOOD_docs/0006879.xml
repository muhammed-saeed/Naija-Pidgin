New restaurant coming to Tremont Township

MOLLEYSTOWN - A new fast food restaurant is opening soon in Tremont Township, and it is currently seeking employees.

Supervisor Larry Bender said at the board&apos;s July meeting that Burger King is taking over the building that housed Quizno&apos;s and Pizza Hut at the Ravine exit of Interstate 81. He said that he had talked to the owner and encouraged him to hire township residents.

Bender said Big Lots is also looking for employees.

In other business, it was noted that the additional speed limit signs ordered upon the advice of the state police have been installed. With these in place, Bender said the state police will now be able to fine speeders and have it &quot;stick.&quot;

The sewage problem reported at the June meeting has been solved to everyone&apos;s satisfaction. According to Bender, rain caused the resident&apos;s septic tank to fill up and overflow onto a neighboring property.

&quot;The problem was the result of the heavy rains,&quot; Bender said.

After a brief discussion, the supervisors agreed they would &quot;bite the bullet&quot; this time and pay the bill from the sewage enforcement officer. However, they also agreed that paying the bill automatically would not become the board&apos;s policy.

A flooding problem in Lorberry was also brought to the supervisors&apos; attention last month.

Resident Deb Hoke had noted that she lost various pieces of lawn equipment when her basement flooded. Water also came into her garage, damaging the garage door and swimming pool. All her efforts to keep a township storm drain open had failed, she said.

Bender said he had met with an adjuster from H.A. Thompson, the township&apos;s insurance carrier.

Hoke gave supervisors a letter she had received from her insurance company. Although they recommended she contact the Department of Environmental Protection, she said she would not be doing so.

&quot;I just want it fixed so it doesn&apos;t happen again,&quot; Hoke said. &quot;I&apos;m not here to start trouble.&quot;

Hoke thanked the supervisors for all the work they had already done in an effort to solve the problem.

In other business:

- Bender reported there had been a power surge in Lincoln on June 29. Residents lost computers, microwaves, and power strips. He noted that he understands representatives from PPL would be visiting residents.

- Chairman John Brommer reported the township had received information from DEP concerning a sewage discharge monitoring report for the Raceway truck stop. According to DEP, the facility had exceeded its permitted limits in January, February and March. One month the discharge was three times more than permitted, said Brommer.

- The board agreed that a larger dehumidifier should be purchased for the township garage since the present one must be emptied every day. According to Bender, the high level of humidity is the reason the supervisors have decided to park the trucks outside.

- The township&apos;s newest truck was picked up on July 2. It has both an automatic and a manual transmission. The total price with interest was $81,000.
