Fast Food Restaurant Play Structures a Breeding Ground for Bacteria

Most would agree that fast food isn&apos;t healthy for you, but did you know that the playgrounds at these restaurants are unhealthy for your children, as well?


Dr. Erin Carr-Jordan came to the realization that fast food play areas were horribly bad, after crawling through some of them in pursuit of her children. With that, Dr. Carr-Jordan, a professor of developmental psychology and mother of four, decide to do her own independent investigation.

Dr. Carr-Jordan spent the last few months investigating the children&apos;s play structures at more than fifty fast food restaurants. Among them were the ubiquitous McDonald&apos;s, as well as Burger King, and Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s. She isn&apos;t just looking at restaurants in Arizona, where she lives. She&apos;s combining the research with a cross-country trip. She said she&apos;s found bad conditions in rich and poor areas alike.

Carr-Jordan has been sending her swab samples to a lab. The lab found staphylococcus and other bacteria. The study isn&apos;t complete yetm, but Annissa Furr, a microbiology professor in Arizona, is working with Carr-Jordan to collect and analyze the data to hopefully spur legislators to act on the issue.

Furr noted that germs are also found at outdoor playgrounds, but added that fresh air, cold, heat, rain and the sun&apos;s UV rays can inhibit bacterial growth. However, fast food restaurant playlands are nice structures for bacteria. They are enclosed, generally warm and moist, and definitely food-rich. They &quot;keep bacteria in a very happy environment. They&apos;re in their comfort zone where they can grow.&quot;

Being located in a restaurant adds to the risk, Furr said. &quot;There is more potential for hand-to-mouth transmission,&quot; she said. &quot;You often see kids go down the slide and immediately grab some food.&quot;

Dr. Carr-Jordan has videotaped more than 50 such playlands as well as sent swabs for microbial testing. Speaking to a Los Angeles Times reporter, she said , &quot;This is bad, this is really bad. Without a doubt, this was one of the worst and definitely in the top five. There was food everywhere.&quot;

It wasn&apos;t just her opinion. An L.A. Times reporter crawled through the same McDonald&apos;s PlayPlace a few minutes later, and found filmy windows, several broken pieces of equipment, food in every compartment, sticky surfaces, other types of garbage, and trapped hair.

Last spring, Dr. Carr-Jordan followed her toddler through an Arizona McDonald&apos;s playground and was shocked by the structure, and after several calls to the restaurant manager resulted in no action, Carr-Jordan posted a video of the tainted structure on YouTube.

McDonald&apos;s spokeswoman Danya Proud, said the video caught the attention of the restaurants&apos; corporate offices. &quot;It was unacceptable, completely unacceptable. But it is not reflective of our business and our restaurants. As far as I&apos;m concerned, it was an isolated matter. And we took immediate corrective action to thoroughly sanitize the PlayPlace.&quot;

Many McDonald&apos;s restaurants, however, are independently franchised. Additionally, Carr-Jordan discovered that while some fast-food companies are happy to provide customers with their cleaning protocols (an example she gives is Chick-fil-A), representatives of Burger King, Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s and McDonald&apos;s have either indicated they don&apos;t have any such &quot;cleaning protocols&quot; or have not responded.

Watch Carr-Jordan&apos;s original video and decide if you want to continue letting your children climb through such structures.

I tried leaving what I thought what I thought to be an appropriate response. How will this problem be corrected if we are not allowed to be perfectly honest. I&apos;m sorry :-(
