The below copied report from Time.com, Tuesday, 07 September 2010, contains a shocking video entitled &quot;The Lord&apos;s Resistance Army Hunts Children in Sudan&quot;.

Click here (and wait for end of short advert) to view video and hear Ed Robbins reporting for Time.com from Western Equatoria State , southern Sudan.

Please replay the video and listen carefully to a message for everyone. The message is from a deeply traumatised Sudanese boy. The boy&apos;s name is Moses. Moses was abducted, attacked, hurt all over and stabbed with a bayonet by LRA terrorists. The terrorists forced Moses to kill a young girl. The girl was aged 7 or 8. If he did not kill the girl, they would kill him. The heart wrenching message from Moses says:

 &quot;I&apos;M ASKING EVERYONE PLEASE, PRAY TO MAKE IT END&quot; 

Replay the video again and imagine yourself as Moses. The flat deadened tone of his voice is haunting. After viewing the report for the first time yesterday and working on it today at Sudan Watch, Uganda Watch and Congo Watch, I can&apos;t get Moses out of my mind. His trauma seeped into my bones as I imagined how he must have felt, what his future holds, and how he will think and be haunted for the rest of his life. I find this report deeply distressing and disturbing. I cannot understand why so many people are powerless when it comes to stopping the LRA. How someone like Joseph Kony manages to stay alive is beyond my comprehension. The stresses and strains he has gone through in his lifetime are unimaginable. A living hell, I guess.

 LRA KILL 8 IN YAMBIO, W. EQUATORIA, S. SUDAN -
More Ugandan PDF forces to be deployed 

 

 WES Yambio: LRA Raid And Kill 8 citizens 
Report from South Sudan Analysis (SOSA) - Monday, 06 September 2010: (YAMBIO) – Ugandan Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) rebels have killed 8 people during weekend raids in Southern Sudan’s Western Equatoria state , a local official said.

Around 6 LRA fighters attacked the market village of Rii-Bodo on Saturday, killing 8 civilians, said Lexon Amozai, State Director of Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission in Western Equatoria State .

The horrifying murders come in the wake of an LRA ambush at a near-by small stream of Nahua.

On Friday the rebels launched a similar assault on the village of Gangura.

“They killed 8 people there, among them two women. There were no soldiers deployed there, so they attacked the civilians,” Mr Amozai said.

A Uganda-led coalition including Congo and South Sudan launched a joint offensive against LRA strongholds in Congo’s isolated Garamba National Park on December 14 after LRA leader Joseph Kony again failed to sign a deal to end his rebellion. However, the operation has failed to arrest Joseph Kony.

In the same weekend related attacks were carried on Sunday at James Diko and Naakiri Bomas under Bangasu payam during a final funeral of one of the LRA Victims.

Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for war crimes.

Bangasi Joseph Bakosoro, state governor of Western Equatoria state with deeply sorrow and regrets expressed his dissatisfaction for the death of 8 WES citizens of Rii-Bodo on Saturday.

In a press state ment, Col Bangasi said that, “it is painful to see such barbaric killings by the notorious LRA fighters on the innocent citizens of western Equatoria more especially as referendum gets around the corner.”

He called upon all the youth to stand up in order to provide security to the state from the marauding LRA and the state Government in collaboration with the UPDF and SPLA.

Security sources say soon the state government “will deploy forces around the payams and Bomas.”

Bakosoro assured the citizens that, “more forces of the Ugandan People Defense (UPDF) forces will be deployed around the most attacked areas of the Bomas.” 

He cautioned the forestry department to ensure that “all timber cutters are removed from the forest of the state because it makes no sense for the LRA to be killing people leaving them (timber companies) unharmed hence some might be spices of the LRA.”

Meanwhile the Minister of Local Government and Law Enforcement Agencies Colonel Wilson Sidigi said that he will ensure that support is given to the villagers’ security.

Sidigi promised that he will organize with the County Commissioners of Yambio and Nzara to encouraged the youth to stand firm as the security of the State is in the hands of every citizen of the state . - - -

 LRA Kill Eight In Yambio 
Report from SRS - Sudan Radio Service - Tuesday, 07 September 2010: (YAMBIO) – About eight people were killed in attacks allegedly perpetrated by the Lord’s Resistance Army over the weekend in outskirts of Yambio town.

The Western Equatoria state Minister of Information and Communication, Gibson Bullen Wande, spoke to SRS from Yambio on Tuesday.

[Gibson Bullen Wande]: “The LRA appeared between Gangura and a place called Baite, attacked the village and killed three people, so now we are seeing how we are going to handle it. Then on Saturday in the evening, the LRA appeared about 7 kilometers away from Yambio town in a place called Riibodoo. They came into the house of a chief with his in-laws. All of them were beaten to death and one person was abducted. So the total number of people that we have established to have been killed during the two attacks of last week has now come to eight so far.”

Gibson Bullen Wande was speaking to SRS from Yambio on Tuesday. - - -

 LRA rebels kill eight in South Sudan raid, local official says 
Report from Sudan Tribune - Tuesday, 07 September 2010
By Richard Ruati - excerpt: (YAMBIO - September 6, 2010) - The Ugandan rebels Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) has killed eight people in raids over the weekend in South Sudan’s state of Western Equatoria, a local official has said.

The LRA, which is a sectarian religious and military group from northern Uganda, has a history of committing atrocities in the region.

It began as an Acholi tribe rebel movement seeking to overthrow the Ugandan Government. What it stands for now is a matter of debate but in 2005 the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued its first five arrest warrants for LRA leader, Joseph Kony, his deputy and three of his commanders.

Around six LRA fighters attacked the market village of Rii-Bodo at about 2:00 am (local time) on Saturday, 4 August, and killed civilians, said Lexon Amozai who is the state director of the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission in Western Equatoria State . The murders took place after an LRA ambush at the nearby Nahua stream.

On Friday, the rebels launched a similar assault on the village of Gangura. &quot;They killed eight people there, among them two women. There were no soldiers deployed there, so they attacked the civilians,&quot; Amozai said.

A Uganda-led coalition including Congo and South Sudan launched a joint offensive against the LRA strongholds in Congo’s isolated Garamba National Park on December 14, after LRA leader Kony again failed to sign a peace deal. However, the operation has failed to arrest Kony.

On Sunday, August 5, related attacks were carried out in James Diko, Naakiri Bomas and during the funeral of one of the LRA victims in Bangasu. [...]

Security sources say that the state government’s deployment of &quot;forces around the payams [villages] and Bomas,” is imminent. - - -

Excerpt: Sixteen years ago, Irene Abonyo was held down to the ground and her lips and ears viciously sliced off by rebels in northern Uganda. But 70-year old Abonyo is in a forgiving mood. She attended a steamy, overcrowded town-hall meeting to see, on better terms this time, one of the world&apos;s most terrifying rebel groups, the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army (LRA). After a dialogue, she went over to shake the hand of a former LRA fighter. He held her hand, but refused to have his picture taken with the disfigured woman. &quot;I will still forgive,&quot; Abonyo explains. &quot;They are embarrassed of what they have done.&quot; Full story at: www.time.com - - -

 &quot;I&apos;M ASKING EVERYONE PLEASE, PRAY TO MAKE IT END&quot; 

Last month, Human Rights Watch said the LRA had killed more than 250 people in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo over the previous year and a half. It said nearly 700 others were kidnapped and forced to be either soldiers or sex slaves. Full story at Voice of America News, Tuesday, 07 September 2010 - LRA Kills 8 in Southern Sudan .

 Balancing Counterterrorism and Democracy in Uganda 
Report from Time.com
By Ioannis Gatsiounis in Kampala, Uganda
Tuesday, 07 September 2010. Full copy: U.S. President Barack Obama took office promising to make good governance the cornerstone of his African policy, and Uganda came to typify the shift in priorities. Repeated attempts by President Yoweri Museveni to meet with Obama were denied, apparently in response to Uganda&apos;s sluggish pace of political reform ahead of presidential elections in February. President Obama also directly challenged Museveni to lift his support for a draconian bill persecuting gays.

But just as the 9/11 attacks drew the U.S. closer to autocratic Arab regimes whose security services were needed to help fight al-Qaeda, so have the July 11 bombings of two Kampala nightspots by the Somalia-based al-Shabab militant group reminded the Obama Administration of Uganda&apos;s importance in the battle against extremism in the Horn of Africa. And that strategic interdependency challenges the U.S. democracy agenda. (See a video of the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army hunting children in Sudan.) 

&quot;Washington is now forced to do a balancing act,&quot; says Livingstone Sweanyana, executive director at the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative in Kampala. &quot;If the U.S. is going to work with Museveni on al-Shabab, the U.S. can&apos;t afford to see or treat him as an unfriendly force.&quot;

U.S. officials insist that democratic reform still figures at the top of Washington&apos;s agenda in Uganda. But as Museveni&apos;s National Resistance Movement (NRM) has used the July 11 terror attacks as a pretext to shrink the political space, Washington&apos;s critique hasn&apos;t kept pace. Three days after the bombings, parliament passed a bill enabling phone-tapping. Weeks later, nationwide demonstrations demanding an independent election commission were violently suppressed on grounds that they could be exploited by terrorists. And the media have since been banned from commenting on the twin bombings. (Can Uganda forgive the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army?) 

Following the crackdown on protests calling for an election commission, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson did say that security concerns were no justification for squelching dissent. Curiously, however, the previous day he told a reporter on the sidelines of an African Union (A.U.) summit in Kampala that Museveni had been &quot;elected openly and transparently in free and fair elections,&quot; contradicting a 2006 State Department assessment that the polls had been &quot;marred by serious irregularities.&quot; (See pictures of Uganda.) 

The about-face may be driven by growing desperation. At the same A.U. summit, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that &quot;ending the threat of al-Shabab to the world will take more than just law enforcement&quot; and that Washington was therefore going to work closely &quot;to support the African Union&apos;s [military] mission in Somalia [AMISOM].&quot; Washington is looking to boost current troop levels from 8,000 — most of them from Burundi and Uganda — to 20,000. The problem is that few member state s other than Uganda have volunteered to step up. Museveni, a former rebel leader, is reportedly prepared to mobilize that many troops on his own and has been leading calls to switch AMISOM&apos;s mandate from peacekeeping to peace enforcement.

&quot;The U.S. is depending on Uganda to play a role in Somalia to rein in extremist forces,&quot; says James Tumusiime, managing editor of the opposition-leaning Observer weekly. &quot;And in light of the attacks, the U.S. is probably beginning to think they&apos;re better off with a stable, functioning style of leadership in Uganda — someone who&apos;s not necessarily a democrat but a guy in control — rather than support change for democracy&apos;s sake.&quot;

U.S. diplomats in Kampala say much of their democracy-promotion work is low-key. One example is their success in persuading Uganda to put voter-registration lists online to allow the validation of voter identities. USAID invested around $2 million on democracy and governance programs last year, and that figure is expected to hit $10 million this year. Officials argue that security and democracy are mutually reinforcing.

But support for the key opposition demand of an independent election commission appears to be waning, says Wafula Oguttu, spokesperson for the leading opposition party Forum for Democratic Change (FDC). Recalling Washington&apos;s silence after the recent suppression of demonstrations — in which 80 people were arrested and some claimed to have been tortured — Oguttu says, &quot;The U.S. likely would have spoken out against that prior to al-Shabab.&quot; Now the opposition is anxiously awaiting U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&apos;s quarterly report on Uganda, due late this month, after Congress ordered the State Department to tightly monitor Uganda&apos;s election process. &quot;A lot of bad things have happened since May,&quot; says Oguttu, and he expects the report to reflect that fact.

The last such report, issued in May, irritated NRM leaders, but prompted no constructive action. Indeed the party&apos;s primary polls on Monday were marred by confusion and allegations of ballot-stuffing. Opposition groups hope that Washington will use its leverage as one of Uganda&apos;s leading aid donors to press for change. But they fear the U.S. lacks the resolve to press the issue, leaving Uganda&apos;s election process heavily skewed toward the ruling party.

Challenges to the legitimacy of the electoral process raise the danger of large-scale political violence, analysts warn. Last September, riots in Kampala left 17 people dead after the king of Buganda kingdom was prevented by Museveni from visiting a nearby district. (Comment on this story.)

&quot;We have shown restraint so far,&quot; says the FDC&apos;s Oguttu. But if the mechanisms for free and fair elections fail to materialize, he says, &quot;we&apos;re going to have a little bit of trouble.&quot; He predicts the youth will grow more vocal and could target the destruction of election-commission offices. Meanwhile, the opposition is mulling the option of boycotting February&apos;s elections. Whatever the case may be, he says, &quot;expect fireworks.&quot; And a new round of political turmoil, of course, is unlikely to help promote either democracy or security.

Eavesdrop on San Diego&apos;s political circles and you&apos;ll hear one named mentioned quite a bit: Nathan Fletcher.

He&apos;s said to be following the Pete Wilson playbook: Marines, state Assembly and then mayor. For now, he&apos;s an assemblyman but he&apos;s already considered a formidable challenger to become Mayor Jerry Sanders&apos; successor in 2012.

Liam Dillon sat down with Fletcher for a Q&amp;A , learning how he first got involved in the Chelsea King tragedy and opening an early window into how Fletcher would operate: He said he voted against Proposition 8 and will vote against Proposition D, the city of San Diego&apos;s sales-tax increase.

 
Join thousands of San Diegans who get the day&apos;s news in their inboxes every morning. Get the Morning Report now . 

Especially good: Sam Hodgson&apos;s photo of Fletcher. Hodgson remarked on Twitter later how the Fletcher was enough at ease to allow the photographer to get in his face.

That&apos;s quite a feat. I&apos;ve had Hodgson in my face for four years and I&apos;m still not at ease with it.

• Speaking of Hodgson getting in someone&apos;s face, he profiles a guy who actually lives in Balboa Park . Eric Williams worked in the Coast Guard&apos;s search and rescue operations in the Pacific Northwest, Caribbean and San Diego. Now he&apos;s the Girl Scout&apos;s director of property. He refers to his wife as &quot;the first lady of Balboa Park .&quot;

The connection between this week&apos;s subject and the last is one of my favorite things: A tree house. I never had one as a kid, and I still want one.

• One of the seminal figures of blues music in San Diego, Ken Schoppmeyer , has died.

• Before we jump into the week&apos;s happenings, a quick announcement from us: Our arts blog will be going live next week. We&apos;re shooting for Thursday. Here&apos;s a little on what we&apos;ll be doing. You can also sign up for our new, weekly arts email newsletter , which will start soon. Stay tuned for more.

 What We Learned This Week 

 So This Is What&apos;s Called Astro-Turfing : Follow along as a partisan talking point becomes accepted fact in a news report.

 Beware ... The Silence of the Thumbs! : More and more governments are banning the use of laptops and cell phones during hearings because of worries that they could just be used as an unscrupulous shroud . Plus: How the heck are governments going to be able to find and produce all the supposedly public information that&apos;s being created in these conversations?

 Everybody Dance Now : Oh, wait. It&apos;s C&amp;C Development. Not C&amp;C Music Factory. Whoops.

Actually, it could be hard to recognize this new developer , who is hoping to score financing help from the San Diego Housing Commission to renovate and run affordable housing for the elderly.

That&apos;s because its founders were until recently listed as executives of San Diego-based Amerland Group. They use Amerland Group e-mails. Their phone number is Amerland&apos;s. And their development portfolio is Amerland&apos;s, too.

Why does that matter? Amerland is in a whole mess of trouble after a fire in its Vallejo complex killed four people.

 The Mayor&apos;s on a Roll : We know Mayor Sanders is forced to say a lot of words about a lot of topics and gets asked a lot of questions by a lot of people. But, as our Fact Check found, he&apos;s having trouble nailing down the reform talking points as the campaign for Proposition D ramps up.

 Well That&apos;s a Mighty Mess in the Middle : Lincoln High has long struggled with the fact that it has no ordinary middle schools regularly feeding it students, making it harder for teachers across schools to offer a unified teaching plan. That problem could be compounded now that San Diego Unified&apos;s major reform push is built around strengthening the relationships between those feeder schools.

 The Beverage Collection : (Stories to read over a hot cup of joe, if you&apos;re reading this in the morning. If it&apos;s Saturday evening, you could even pour yourself a glass of red wine.)

 It&apos;s a State of Mind : By now, we&apos;ve all heard about SDSU&apos;s growing prowess as a research institute. We explain now why some researchers chose SDSU over local powerhouse UCSD (it&apos;s the ability to teach) and why State &apos;s transformation isn&apos;t complete (money and reputation). Also, in the comments, one SDSU higher-up didn&apos;t think the relationship between the two schools was made clear enough and said UCSD is a partner, not a competitor .

 First Step: Change the Name : It&apos;s called Commercial Street. It&apos;s was supposed be an industrial hub. Now it&apos;s a rather abandoned stretch of Logan Heights. It does have something going for it though: A trolley runs through it. That has city planners salivating at the chance to turn it into one of those stretches of condos, store fronts and businesses that smart growthers dig.

 A Story of Real Crime : It just didn&apos;t add up . One document had all the money going to the buyer. The other had an average of $150,000 from each sale going to the mastermind of the transactions in the form of a &quot;marketing fee.&quot; The documents were supposed to be exactly the same.

This was one of the enduring mysteries we hadn&apos;t been able to completely solve in our Staggering Swindle investigation . This week we got the answer, a rather simple one: The woman who was supposed to be the neutral third party in the condo sales, the escrow agent, created two different documents, thereby concealing the mastermind&apos;s payments from those who would&apos;ve wanted to know about them — the buyers and the lenders.

 Number of the Week : Three. That&apos;s the number of families out of 10 in San Diego that can&apos;t make ends meet .

 Quote of the Week : &quot;I&apos;ll be quite candid: like many people my views on the gay community have changed over the years,&quot; City Council candidate Lori Zapf, in an interview with the San Diego Gay&amp;Lesbian News, on her previous comments that gays shouldn&apos;t be able to serve in public office.

 Edith Wharton’s War 
 [ Right-Wing , Politics ] ( The New Republic - All Feed )
Edith Wharton is not a writer most of us probably associate with war. With the frosty, treacherous, yet bloodless drawing-room battles of Gilded Age New York, yes. With the stink and smoking gore of a trench on the Western Front, no.

Edith Wharton is not a writer most of us probably associate with war. With the frosty, treacherous, yet bloodless drawing-room battles of Gilded Age New York, yes. With the stink and smoking gore of a trench on the Western Front, no.

And yet there Wharton was in France, for the duration of World War I: working vigorously on behalf of numerous charities and relief organizations, sending dispatches from the front back to American readers, publicly and privately making the case for the United State s to join the fight. In 1917, she was awarded the French Legion of Honor for her efforts.

Having lived in Paris for long stretches since 1907, Wharton had made France her home by the time war broke out in 1914. In addition to divesting herself of her increasingly bizarre husband Teddy, Wharton left behind The Mount, their Palladian-style country house in the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts. Recently I participated in a literary festival there as a member of the panel “Channeling Edith Wharton: Writers in Wartime.” Although I grew up in Massachusetts, I had never before visited The Mount, much less channeled its original owner, who several times toured the Western Front in her Mercedes. She described her second excursion there to her friend Henry James with a jauntiness I mistrusted: “It was less high in colour than the first adventure,&amp;resulted in several disappointments, as well as in some interesting moments—indeed, once within the military zone every moment is interesting.”

 

 War—as both a general idea and also a feature of our own historical moment—seemed very far from this secluded e state in Lenox, with its elegant house and meticulous garden, its annual “coaching weekend” of horse-drawn carriages. The property’s airy beauty had the effect of intensifying a disjunction to which I cannot grow accustomed: the one between the physical settings of my own life—Central Park , the New York Public Library, the Hudson River, even West Point (martial in tone yet, as a place of learning, somehow rather peaceful)—and the imagined landscapes I carry within, volatile landscapes of a geographically distant war described to me by people fighting it.

One day my mind’s eye might be imprinted with the inhospitable “surface of some alien planet” conjured by a pilot looking for a good place to land his helicopter in the mountains of Afghanistan. The next it might be the “mud cave” depicted by a captain who lives in it with a small group of soldiers surrounded by the stench of the fires in which they must burn their own waste. During my visit to The Mount, the scene I was trying—am still trying—to piece together had only just taken place in Kandahar City, where Chris Goeke, a lieutenant I knew well, was killed when his unit was hit with small-arms, rifle, and rocket-propelled-grenade fire.

The disconnection between my external and internal worlds can occasionally prove dizzying. I wouldn’t call what I feel at such moments guilt exactly, or regret, for it isn’t that I think I should be doing something else or that I wish myself (to paraphrase Shakespeare’s Henry V) anywhere but where I am. Nor is it the case that I feel unsuited to the particular role I inhabit, as I surely would were I to find myself on a battlefield rather than in a classroom. Nevertheless, living so far behind the lines presented to my imagination requires a psychological adjustment. And I haven’t adjusted yet.

Meandering through Wharton’s house into Teddy’s sun-splashed den, across the terrace, and upstairs to the “Henry James suite,” I eventually found, as if in response to my discomfort, an exhibit on “Edith Wharton and the First World War,” which begins unprepossessingly in what was the guest bathroom. There I studied a series of placards and photos telling the story of Edith Wharton’s war.

Wharton was disgusted by American neutrality, contemptuous of Woodrow Wilson and his pacifist “apologists,” persuaded that the war was, in the words of her recent biographer, Hermione Lee, “somehow an inevitability, a product of a decaying civilization.” Wharton evidently shared a disturbing faith in war as a kind of purgative with her friend and contemporary Theodore Roosevelt even if her propagandizing zeal never reaches quite the fever pitch of Roosevelt’s own writing on the subject. Her French poilu is an uncomplicated patriot: “Wherever I go among these men of the front,” she wrote in 1915, “I have the same impression … that the absorbing undivided thought of the Defense of France lives in the heart and brain of each soldier as intensely as in the heart and brain of their chief.”

As I made my way through the exhibit and later through Fighting France , Wharton’s account of her life in wartime Paris and visits to the Western Front, I grew impatient with the romantic strains in which she was capable of discussing war. Here, she describes a column of troops viewed from her car: “Close as the men were, they seemed allegorically splendid: as if, under the arch of the sunset, we had been watching the whole French army ride straight into glory.” But she knew where they were really going.

Indeed, Wharton’s wartime experiences and attitudes seemed in so many ways the reverse of my own. She was physically close to the war yet somehow fundamentally aloof from its combatants: she refers to the wounded as “poor bandaged creatures” in her letter to James. I have watched the current war unfold from a great distance, but the soldiers I know form the core of my emotional life. The harder I tried to channel Wharton, the more frustrated I became, for her war writing is undeniably exuberant, rich with a sense of exhilaration that would seem to preclude unvarnished reflection on the chaos and destruction all around her.

Wharton was seduced by the “fabulous and epic” movements of an army on the march and by the “concentrated energy” of modern warfare. She was susceptible to jingoism and overheated paeans to sacrifice. Yet there are moments in Fighting France when her novelist’s eye for the unexpected or oblique exposes the incompleteness of that other narrative. When Wharton takes advantage not of her eyewitness proximity to the trenches but rather of the distance and off-kilter perspective that her non-combatant status and relative safety made possible, she seems able to report authentically the terror of the war.

As I read, I discovered that Wharton was on some level attempting to reproduce the disorientation she was experiencing: leaving the front, she explained in Fighting France , “is like coming down from the mountains.” Toward the end of the book I encountered a description of a picnic lunch arranged on the side of a ridge protected from an opposing German artillery battery. The passage feels frivolous until you realize how self-aware it is: “As we sat there in the grass, swept by a great mountain breeze full of the scent of thyme and myrtle, while the flutter of birds, the hum of insects, the still and busy life of the hills went on all about us in the sunshine, the pressure of the encircling line of death grew more intolerably real. It is not in the mud and jokes and every-day activities of the trenches that one most feels the damnable insanity of war; it is where it lurks like a mythical monster in scenes to which the mind has always turned for rest.”

Wharton, it turns out, was not blind to the faces of the wounded, whose experiences had had the effect of “burning them down to the bare bones of character.” Nor was she oblivious, while driving through landscapes in the “first sweet leafiness … of spring,” to “the choking air of present horror” that seemed always to wait just around the next bend. In Wharton’s attempts to articulate the sensation produced by the collision of tranquil scenes with vivid imaginings of war’s annihilating force, I discovered a version of my own war vertigo. The state of mind Wharton describes is akin to the one I experienced as a visitor to her house—one of those settings to which a mind might ordinarily turn for rest—coming face-to-face with what she called “the whole huge and oppressive and unescapable fact of the war.”

As I drove home early the next morning, my route took me over gently curving back roads through farm country and quaint New York villages. Admiring the view, accelerating occasionally to pass a poky horse trailer, I thought of what an officer had recently written to me about his experience climbing to an isolated Afghan outpost at 9,000 feet: “It is pretty country here,” he said, “if it weren’t for the war.”

 DICTIONARY CORNER 

As any fans of recent internet craze &apos;YouTube&apos; will know, affable c0ckney &apos;Arry Redknapp really doesn&apos;t like being called a wheeler-dealer . That may be because the wheeler-dealer&apos;s a wee bit sensitive over the allegations [which he disputes - Fiver Lawyers] that he cheated the public revenue or it may because his wheeler-dealer head is firmly shoved up his wheeler-dealer&apos;s hole or it may be because, in the strictest sense, he isn&apos;t a wheeler-dealer at all.

You see, no lesser a source than thefreedictionary.com defines a wheeler-dealer as someone &quot;who knows how to circumvent difficulties&quot; and in the past few weeks &apos;Arry has struggled to circumvent the smallest of difficulties from a routine away leg in Big Cup qualification to a Wigan defence so bad you can make it concede goals just by looking at it askance. &apos;Arry&apos;s latest spot of bother occurred when the club failed to sign a few forms in triplicate and complete the signing of maverick Dutch detective Rafael van der Vaart from Real Madrid before the transfer window slid shut at 6pm yesterday, Spurs eventually getting the deal officially ratified more than 21 hours later.

Not that &apos;Arry reckons it&apos;s his fault. &quot;I thought he was going to Bayern Munich for about £18m and suddenly he became an awful lot cheaper and the chairman came to me and said, &apos;Look, he&apos;s available for around about £8m&apos;. I felt we&apos;d already got a good squad, it wasn&apos;t a case of really being desperate to get anyone in. It was only when he rung me at about four o&apos;clock and told me there was an opportunity here and did I want to do something? I said, &apos;I don&apos;t really want to spend your money but if you feel you want to have a go then, well, let&apos;s push on and give it a crack and see if we can pull it off.&quot;

Hmm. Cut-price players? Signing people you don&apos;t really need? Pushing for last-minute deals? Dictionary corner proves its worth once again ...

 YES, IT&apos;S AN EARLY 1990s SOVIET POLITICAL REFERENCE. WHAT OF IT? 

The Fiver&apos;s dealings with Tony Blair have been fairly limited, it&apos;s fair to say. We&apos;ve bumped into each other at the odd Bilderburg meeting, mid owl dance, but that&apos;s about it. Certainly we&apos;ve not had a chance to dispense our worldly advice to the former PM: never buy a meat and potato pie at Gresty Road, never attempt to tickle an irate Ipswich fan in an attempt to cheer him up, and, after that unfortunate incident in Arbroath, never, ever, agree to join in with Shortbread McFiver&apos;s bi-monthly N@ked Turnstile Steeplechase.

Lord Ferg, on the other hand, has had the ear of the former prime minister more than once. In his memoirs, published today, Blair admits that Ferg &quot;was always very good value on leadership&quot;, and we can only guess at the sort of gum-chewing, watch-tapping, face-empurpling, media-snubbing advice was dished out. If the Fiver was a more politically-minded tea-time email, we&apos;d make some clever reference to the £9m wasted on Kleberson and Eric Djemba-Djemba and the state of the economy. But we&apos;re not. So we won&apos;t.

Another section of the memoir, though, does provide a little insight. The PM, during a difficult period with Gordon Brown, asked the Manchester United manager what he would do if his best player wasn&apos;t listening to instructions and was simply doing his own thing. Chuck him out of the team, was Ferg&apos;s typically calm and considered reply.

Blair clearly didn&apos;t listen, perhaps recognising the good Lord&apos;s bombastic approach to man-management wasn&apos;t exactly what was needed in the top echelons of British politics, but at least he&apos;d learned the lessons of football managers&apos; previous forays into the corridors of power. It was a mistake made by Mikhail Gorbachev, who after asking Valeriy Lobanovskiy for his thoughts on the make-up of the Politburo, inadvertently kicked off the end of the Cold War by appointing a confused Gennady Yanayev as his false No9 and insisting that Vladimir Kryuchkov, Dmitriy Yazov and Valentin Pavlov shift to the left and start pressing the opposition further up the Kremlin.

 FIVER LETTERS 

&quot;It&apos;s very good of &apos;Arry Redknapp to tell Daniel Levy &apos;I don&apos;t really want to spend your money but if you feel you want to ...&apos; That&apos;s what I like about &apos;Arry. Always careful with other people&apos;s money. Just as he was at Bournemouth, West Ham, Portsmouth and Southampton&quot; - Paul Rowland.

&quot;Re: Uefa&apos;s vuvuzela ban. Can it also please ban air-horns, trumpets and annoying brass bands. Oh, and could it start enforcing the existing ban on fireworks, flares, etc?&quot; - John Caley.

&quot;The Special Relationship (Yesterday&apos;s Fiver) should involve more of you making fun of us Yanks behind our backs than ever as we get to watch Bewildered Bob Bradley believe stiffs like Ricardo Clark and Robbie Findley are somehow worthy of spots on an international side for another four years. The Aston Villa rumours were enticing because we thought Randy Lerner had the potential to be dumb enough to hire Bradley (he does run the NFL&apos;s Cleveland Browns and has tolerated rampant underachievement), but I suppose there are plenty of credentialled managers in the wings who know how to botch starting XIs and waste subs fixing them just like Bradley did in South Africa. It would have been entertaining to see him stare at the field as if he knew what he was doing far away from our shores&quot; - Colin.

&quot;I don&apos;t know which hospital car park your correspondent was in (yesterday&apos;s Fiver) but it certainly wasn&apos;t the one at Watford General (which is of course backing on to the wrong side of Vicarage Road to spot any new arrivals, unless the new signing was planning to book a hospitality package) as the minimum charge is now £3.50. Mind, you do now get three full hours, enough time to get the thoughts of Malky on new loanee Anthony Taylor and to nip into the Harlequin for a spot of shopping&quot; - Adam Cummings.

 BITS AND BOBS 

Man Utd chief suit David Gill reckons it was still a &quot;pretty good&quot; achievement to fail to reach their target of 54,000 season ticket sales this summer. &quot;I think the bare facts are that the club is in good financial shape,&quot; he declared. With a straight face.

Peter Crouch will miss England&apos;s Euro 2012 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Switzerland due to having a knacked back for a big man.

Uefa has belatedly jumped on the bandwagon and banned vuvuzelas from all European competition. &quot;[We are] of the view that the vuvuzelas would completely change the atmosphere, drowning supporter emotions and detracting from the experience of the game,&quot; read a Uefa state ment.

And Michael Ballack will resume his duties as Germany captain when he recovers from ankle-ouch, ripping the armband off poor Pippi Lahm&apos;s wrist in the process.

Covering the Mariners in place of Geoff Baker tonight, and lots has changed since I was last here in June on what was the team&apos;s Family Day. My last memory of this press box before today was seeing Cliff Lee and his family posing for pictures along the first base line.

The focus of this season obviously changed long ago.

But it was reinforced here today when the big pre-game news was that the team&apos;s second-round pick, Marcus Littlewood , was in town to take some batting practice (that&apos;s him being interviewed in the dugout).

Littlewood, a switch-hitter who will start his Mariner career at shortstop, signed on the deadline last week for a reported $900,000.

Not that he&apos;s gotten to enjoy it yet --- he won&apos;t get any money until 30 days after his physical, which he took last week.

Littlewood took some batting practice early, then was expected to take some more in the last group of the regular session.

&quot;It&apos;s awesome,&apos;&apos; he said of hitting in a Major League park in a Major League uniform. &quot;Hopefully in a couple of years I have the same opportunity.&apos;&apos;

Littlewood spent the last few days at the Arizona Rookie League. He said after his weekend here he&apos;ll get ready for the Instructional League in September, then take the off-season to prepare for spring training.

He was the 67th overall pick in the draft and had already signed with University of San Diego, which he said complicated his decision to sign.

&quot;It was stressful for about a month coming up to the deadline,&apos;&apos; he said. &quot;It was such a relief to sign and get it over with. Every single day it was contemplating the pros and cons of both sides, school or pro ball reall. I&apos;m happy I got the chance to sign.&apos;&apos;

Littlewood said he&apos;s 6-3 and 195 --- he was the Utah state high school player of the year last spring as a senior, hitting .538 with eight homers and 27 RBI.

While he&apos;ll start at shortstop, he said he&apos;s happy to move if the team wants.

&quot;If i have to move, it&apos;s fine,&apos;&apos; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t have any problem with moving. I played every infield position, so I feel comfortable at any of those spots.&apos;&apos;

Littlewood said he didn&apos;t know if he hit any out, saying that he didn&apos;t look because
&quot;it&apos;s not what you do. You kind of hit it and go after the next one.&apos;&apos;

 IN OTHER NEWS. ... 

--- In the only real news to emerge from manager Daren Brown&apos;s pre-game meeting with the media, he said that an MRI on Michael Saunders&apos; right shoulder showed no damage and he could be back Monday. Saunders hurt his shoulder running into the wall against Texas during the last homestand. He&apos;d still been bothered by it during the last road trip so they had the MRI. &quot;There&apos;s no damage,&apos;&apos; Brown said. &quot;It will be a couple days before he&apos;s ready to go as far as throwing and swinging the bat, but we&apos;re looking at he should be ready to go on Monday, which is good news for us and frees his mind up a little bit that there&apos;s nothing wrong.&apos;&apos;

--- There&apos;s been lots of conjecture about the Mariners shutting down prized AAA pitcher Michael Pineda for the rest of the year. But word here today is that no decision has been made yet, though it could come in a couple days.

--- The Twins acquired reliever and former Mariner Brian Fuentes today from the Angels for a player to be named later (though probably not Joe Maurer ). But he won&apos;t be here until Saturday.

Finally, here&apos;s the lineup for tonight:

 Congratulations, David Macinnis Gill 

 Congratulations to David Macinnis Gill on the release of Black Hole Sun (Greenwillow, 2010). From the promotional copy:
 
Durango will take on any mission—as long as it is dangerous, impossible, and hopeless, and as long as it pays enough for him and his crew to get by.

Fortunately for Durango, he also has Mimi, a symbiotic nano-implant, to keep him on the straight and narrow, as well as a crew of loyal soldiers. Because he’s going to need everything he’s got for his latest mission—defending a rag-tag clan of helpless miners from a ravenous horde of feral cannibals and their enigmatic but brutal leader, who is hellbent on taking out the miners, and Durango along with them.

Highlighting Donna and Carmen 

 Today I&apos;d like to highlight the blogs of two local children&apos;s writers, Donna Bowman Bratton &apos;s Simply Donna and Carmen Oliver &apos;s Following My Dreams...One Word at a Time .

This week Donna considers Nonfiction vs. Creative Fiction vs. Historical Fiction and Carmen asks, Do Humorous Picture Books Need a Takeaway? 

What are they doing right? Among other things, they&apos;re reading like writers . They&apos;re asking the hard questions and studying models to find answers.

On a related note, don&apos;t miss Donna&apos;s post on the question of writers who&apos;re not yet (book) published doing school visits . Peek: &quot;To some people, it may seem like I was putting the cart before the horse in 2008, when I gave my first presentation. I didn’t have to go looking for the opportunity. My son’s elementary school teachers....&quot;

Note: The ladies are decked out here as Page 1 and Page 2 at the 2008 Awesome Austin Writer&apos;s Workshop , an informal event at my house. I probably have a more recent picture of them, but the absolute cuteness of this one dictated that I feature it instead.

As much as I enjoy taking local buses and trains, one of my favorite ways of enjoying a country leisurely is driving through the countryside, soaking in the landscape and scenery. Especially in massive countries like Australia, driving from one region to another gives a real sense of he back country. A recent driving trip in Ireland allowed me to reacquaint with that love. I’d previously written about ideal driving tour destinations , now I’m going deeper to dig out the world’s 7 most scenic drives.

1. Great Ocean Road, Australia

Weaving through the Southern Ocean coastline in Melbourne , the Great Ocean Road offers sights of the scrubby landscape, craggy coastal rock formations and the surrounding Otways rainforest. The scenic drive starts from the picnic-heaven Torquay, passing through the surfers’ paradise, Bell’s Beach, and culminates at the Twelve Apostles (pictured below) – an impressive display of limestone rock stacks rising from the tumultuous waves. If you’re planning to spend your holidays in Australia , be sure to rent a car to cruise through this incredible scenic route.

2. Milford Road, New Zealand

An essential part of NZ holidays includes the jaw-dropping scenic drive in South West New Zealand, journeying through valleys, lakes and waterfalls. Running alongside a 14-mile fjord, the drive offers views of the Tasman Sea, and the surrounding snow-peaked mountains. The route takes you through Fiordland National Park and portions of the Te Wāhipounamu World Heritage Area, one of the great wilderness areas of the southern hemisphere.

3. M8, Scotland

The mountainous and craggy landscape of Scotland is often overlooked by travelers, but the country’s diverse geography is definitely worth checking out. Mountain passes that mark the transitions between the highlands and lowlands snake past steep slopes and hilltop castles. M8 is the main motorway – its secondary roads lead to interesting spots and some have bends so sharp that will send you screaming.

4. Pacific Highway, California

Perhaps one of the world’s most photographed route, the Pacific Highway that cuts through California meanders languidly along the shoreline. Starting from San Luis Obispo, the route brings you through hairpin bends, cliffs and oak woodlands and ends at Monterey. Some of the essential stops include Morro Bay – where a volcanic rock stands 536 feet above the bay, the Hearst Castle and the Point Lobos State Reserve to catch gray whales migrating past (December through April).

5. Leh-Manali Highway, India

Those who have been to the Indian Himalayas would have passed through this hugely famous route – fame for its unworldly beauty and notorious for the dangers and harshness of the terrain. The Leh-Manali Highway is a highway in India connecting the Kashmir region to the Himalayas. It crosses some of the highest mountain passes in the world and is open only for 2 months in a year (between June and mid-September) when snow does not pose too much of a threat. Travelers who have done this by bus vouch that this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience – nowhere else offers such raw beauty.

6. Seward Highway, Alaska

The Seward Highway is a major highway in Alaska that extends 127 miles (204 km) from Seward to Anchorage. Backdropped by majestic snow-capped mountains, the highway snakes through plundering waterfalls, verdant forests and calm lakes. Watch for the rare Beluga Whales, or mooses and bears near rapids and creeks. Wildlife and nature are abundant here, so take your time to explore the area and you’ll be generously rewarded.

 

7. Grossglockner High Alpine Road, Austria

The single most breathtaking drive in Europe is the Grossglockner High Alpine Road that winds around the highest mountain in the Alps (at 3,798metres above sea level). The 4,000km journey to the Arctic passes through all types of vegetation – from green meadows to dry cornfields and the eternal ice. The highlight of the route is definitely the Hohe Tauern National Park : the highest mountain and the largest glacier in Austria.

 Proposed kindergarten cutoff date would mean some California kids start school later

Christene Santos, center, and Gabriel Roblas, left, both 4, eat snacks Monday in Regency Park Elementary&apos;s kindergarten. 
For decades, millions of Californians with children who have fall birthdays have struggled over whether to pack their 4-year-olds off to kindergarten – or hold them back because they might be too young to start school.

This week, California state legislators may the closest they&apos;ve ever come to making that decision for parents, with room for some exceptions.

A bill by Sen. Joe Simitian, a Palo Alto Democrat, would roll back the date that entering kindergartners must turn 5 from the current Dec. 2 to Sept. 1.

In 2008, a Public Policy Institute of California review of 14 studies found that students who start kindergarten at older ages perform better on math and reading tests into eighth grade.

Educators hope the change in the age limit will reduce the number of children in special education and those who are held back, as well as help close the achievement gap that divides affluent and lower-income kids.

The change also has long been discussed as a cost-saving measure at the Capitol. Former Gov. Pete Wilson drew the ire of the California Teachers Association in 1992 when he proposed delaying the start of kindergarten that year for more than 100,000 children.

The latest proposal, Senate Bill 1381, would take about $700 million in savings – the result of having 100,000 fewer students each year – and use that money to fund mandatory new &quot;transitional kindergartens.&quot;

The transitional classes would be for children whose birthdays fall between the day after the new cutoff date and Dec. 2.

The change would be phased in, rolling the cutoff date back a month each year, over a three-year period.

The California Parent Teacher Association, the Association of California School Administrators and business interests now are rallying around Simitian&apos;s bill, which could go to the Assembly for a vote this week.

The bill has already passed the Senate. But that version – which was presented as a budget-saving device as well as a good policy idea – was significantly different.

The original bill called for plowing half the savings into preschools and half back into the state &apos;s depleted general fund – a proposal strongly opposed by the state PTA and the CTA.

The proposal has since been amended to include transitional kindergartens – which keeps the savings within the K-12 system – and the bill now has no organized opposition, Simitian said.

To address concerns that $700 million wouldn&apos;t be enough to cover costs, children couldn&apos;t repeat transitional kindergarten, and small districts that might only have a handful eligible for transitional classes could put them in a combination classroom.

The transitional kindergarten is a concept some school districts have already embraced – the classes are a precursor to kindergarten.

Educators believe that they would especially benefit kids whose families can&apos;t afford preschool and who tend to enter kindergarten behind their peers.

&quot;I think people are seeing this as a rare opportunity to do something good for kids at a time when there aren&apos;t many opportunities,&quot; Simitian said.

Debbie Look, director of legislation for the state PTA, said the PTA threw its support to Simitian&apos;s bill once transitional kindergarten was included.

&quot;Our feeling was these children would not necessarily benefit from a third of a year of preschool,&quot; she said.

DeAnn Strangeland, an East Sacramento parent, has two daughters with birthdays that fall just short of the current Dec. 2 cutoff date.

In 2008, Strangeland exercised an option to hold one daughter, now 6, back from starting kindergarten.

&quot;It proved to be a good decision for us. Things came a lot easier for her,&quot; Strangeland said.

&quot;She was getting the homework,&quot; she added. &quot;You want them to feel successful. I think she was ready the year before, but I think we made the right decision.&quot;

Sacramento area kindergarten teacher Laura Bingham, who works at Regency Park Elementary School, called Simitian&apos;s bill &quot;an excellent idea.&quot;

&quot;We are required to have kindergartners reading at the end of kindergarten,&quot; Bingham said. &quot;It&apos;s a huge developmental difference for them (4-year-olds) to come in with the skills some 5-year-olds already have.&quot;

Simitian&apos;s bill would make exceptions for 4-year-olds whose parents and schools believe they are ready to begin regular kindergarten.

The California Teachers Association, which has gone from opposition to a neutral stance on the bill, would prefer that bill include the option to place 5-year-olds who seem developmentally young in transitional classes.

&quot;But we recognize there are cost pressures,&quot; said CTA legislative advocate Jennifer Baker.

She said the CTA in general likes the idea of making Sept. 1 the cutoff date.

KINDERGARTEN: HOW OLD IS OLD ENOUGH?

• Current law: Children can begin kindergarten if they turn 5 by Dec. 2. Parents can choose to hold kids back.

• Proposed law: Children could begin kindergarten if they turn 5 by Sept. 1. The change would be phased in, starting with a new cutoff date of Nov. 1 in 2012-13; Oct. 1 in 2013-14; and Sept. 1 in 2014-15 and thereafter.

School districts would offer publicly funded &quot;transitional kindergarten&quot; classes for children whose birthdays fall between new cutoff dates and Dec. 2. Some exceptions could be made for 4-year-olds whose parents and schools believe they are ready to begin regular kindergarten.

• What&apos;s next: Senate Bill 1381 is pending in the Assembly.
 
Four-year-old Abigail Castellanos naps while her classmates eat snacks Monday in Laura Bingham&apos;s kindergarten class at Sacramento&apos;s Regency Park Elementary School. Senate Bill 1381 would gradually roll back the birthday cutoff for entering kindergarten from Dec. 2 to Sept. 1.

 Forward: In order to better understand this article, perhaps you should first check out what essentially is a &quot;part one&quot; NASCAR 1996: Sponsorship, Schedules, Drivers, and Selling Racing&apos;s Soul. 

In that piece, I argue that the shift in sponsorship from a Southern brand (Winston Cigarettes) to a Northern brand (Nextel-Sprint) along with the influx of Northern drivers and the shift in scheduling from largely Southern to Northern tracks began in 1996 and started the sport&apos;s decline that continues today.

This article continues that trend with a look at the influx of Northern crew chiefs and car owners and how the loss of the single-car operation in favor of larger more corporate-run teams continued to change and ruin the sport as it continues to evolve beyond the point of recognition as the sport dies a little more each year.

 21 Northern crew chiefs, 18 Southern crew cheifs, one foreign .

 

What have we learned? Much like the driver decrease in Southern drivers, which once enjoyed a literal 2:1 advantage of Southern born to Northern, Northern crew chiefs, much like the drivers in the sport themselves, have taken over the sport and are now the majority.

Note how I placed all the New Englanders together, which I consider the worst of the plague because due to their prevalent (but not exclusive) affluence/hoity-toity culture would be less inclined to identify with the racing scene than someone from the Mid or far West.

Should we expect anything different when this demographic is that to which NASCAR is pandering and to whom it would like to see its core audience?

 2010 Totals: 16 Northern Car Owners, 12 Southern Car Owners. Once again, as a continuing but unexpected trend, Northern Car Owners have overtaken Southern Car Owners in just 14 short years. And they wonder why the sport is changing? Too much influence.

 

 Conclusions: While the North Carolina base surprisingly held their own only dropping one team, South Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, and Arkansas disappeared from the map entirely. Michigan doubled in size.

 

Doing this research taught me just how hard it is to own a team and how expensive it must be. For example, everyone knows that George Gillett bankrolls Richard Petty Motorsports even though The King is the honorary figurehead centerpiece. Tony Stewart for all his millions in endorsements and popularity, still only owns just his car of his technical two-car team.

This is done for publicity only. Why not put someone in charge who has more of a passion than a Gillette or a John Henry (Roush-Fenway Racing) when the former clearly have bigger endeavors and more pressing ventures than racing? It&apos;s just smart business.
 
Anyway, Gilette owns three of the current (but likely to reduce) RPM cars with Richard Petty owning only the A.J. Allmindinger ride. This shows just how much money it takes and how without this alliance, Petty would have long been out the door even quicker than  some believe to be the inevitable due to lack of funding and competitiveness which I hope never happens.

Also, in 1996, look at the number of family owned teams and not surprisingly, single car operations. &quot;Bodine Racing&quot; (for all intents and puposes, Marcis Auto Racing, Stavola Brothers Racing, Wood Brothers Racing, Cale Yarborough Motorsports, Bud Moore Engineering, Bobby Allison Motorsports, Butch Mock Motorsports, Junie Donlavey Racing, Darrell Waltrip Racing, Morgan-McClure Motorsports, NEMCO Motorsports, Petty Enterprises, Richard Childress Racing, Joe Gibbs Racing (1 team!), Precision Products, , and Richard Jackson Racing all ran one car and had various degrees of success.

What that means is sure, NEMCO Motorsports is still around today, but they are a non-factor. Wasn&apos;t the case in 1996 since the field was more level. What does it tell you when NASCAR&apos;s biggest names: Bud Moore, Robert Yates, Cale Yarborough, and Petty all formed their own race teams at one time and only Petty remains, albeit, just a a thread?

How many &quot;family teams&quot; run today? NEMCO, Michael Waltrip Racing, Robby Gordon Racing, Tommy Baldwin Jr. and James Finch and we all see how far that gets them. Petty can&apos;t do it on his own and is struggling. James Finch has had some success with Brad Keselowski (Talladega win) and Mike Bliss&apos; Nationwide win last year but he lost those drivers).
 
Baldwin doesn&apos;t run all races and Nemechek can&apos;t always qualify and when he does, he&apos;s 100% &quot;start and park &quot; now. Waltrip? Gibbs? They&apos;ve gone corporate and turned into monster organizations because they&apos;ve had to, to survive and compete. This is NASCAR&apos;s biggest problem. Lack of parity and the good old days of &quot;showing up to the track and racing with what you brought.&quot;

Only Hendrick Motorsports (three teams) and Robert Yates Racing (two teams) ran multiple cars. Obviously Hendrick Motorsports ascended to the top while Yates stunningly went the other way and no longer exists (at least on a relevant scale). Today we know most teams run four and this is what most fans fear: Ten 4-car teams, which waters down the product.

Then you have all the BS &quot;technical-alliance&quot; teams like Red Bull/Hendrick/Stewart-Haas, Joe Gibbs/Michael Waltrip, and Earnhardt-Ganassi/Richard Childress Racing. Its basically the same team winning, just a different name. i.e when Tony Stewart wins, he immediately thanks his &quot; satellite team&quot; Hendrick Motorsports.

Lame, but true.

A lot has changed in the fast growing, progressive sport. Once again, none of it for the better.

 A New York Times article, &quot; Plagiarism Lines Blur for Students in Digital Age ,&quot; discusses a growing concern among educators, writing tutors, and college disciplinarians: the fact that &quot;students simply do not grasp that using words they did not write is a serious misdeed.&quot; Not only does the internet make copying text easy, but it desensitizes students from the severity of plagiarism: &quot;concepts of intellectual property, copyright and originality are under assault in the unbridled exchange of online information.&quot; The result? According to some, students are getting lazy; they&apos;re not coming up with any new, creative ideas on their own; and they&apos;re becoming increasingly ignorant, not to mention apathetic, towards the virtue of authenticity and the lack of integrity associated with plagiarism.  

 Tuition fees for overseas students (living outside the EU) have risen at British universities, going above £10,000 (about $15,590) for the first time, an increase of more than 5% in the last year. British graduate programs are experiencing similar increases, putting both undergrad and graduate programs at risk for reducing their appeal to foreign students. EU undergrads in Britain will pay about £3,290 for 2010-11, while grad students will pay upwards towards £5,214, the latter a 16% increase from the previous year. Some EU institutions remain free of charge for at-home and for overseas students. But, according to the Inside Higher Ed article that covers this story, this is likely to change to in the near future.

 A LIST WHICH SHOULD INCLUDE &apos;BAD EXCUSES FOR EARLY CAPITULATIONS IN SWITZERLAND&apos; 

Post-goal music. 2 Good, 2 Bad. Shockingly-priced offalburgers. Rail replacement buses from Crewe. &quot;We&apos;ll get Jamie and Graeme&apos;s views after the break.&quot; Kuddly Ken Bates. £1,000 season tickets. The football creditors rule. Sky Sports News&apos; Yellow Ticker of Doom. The phrase: &quot;In Premier League history.&quot; Half-time cheerleaders. All unspeakably hideous things that should be no more part of football than a pizza slice should be part of a proper buffet, and a list of the damned to which, if &apos;Arry Redknapp has his way, should be added the hated Astroturf.

&quot;It&apos;s not an excuse,&quot; fibbed the Spurs manager, who left four syntheticpitchophobic players out of the starting line-up for Tottenham&apos;s 3-2 defeat to Young Boys last night, &quot;but I played on Astroturf myself and I hated every minute of it. We&apos;ve had it at QPR but we don&apos;t have it anymore in England. I don&apos;t agree with Astroturf and I don&apos;t think Astroturf should be used in a competition like this.&quot;

But it seems &apos;Arry&apos;s no likelier to see the outlawing of plastic pitches than he is to see Ledley King tapdancing up the Eiger. &quot;This is not an issue,&quot; roboted a Uefa suit. &quot;Before the match a pitch is inspected and if it does not comply with the regulations then it will not be used. Uefa&apos;s regulations state that only the final of [Big Cup] must be played on grass,&quot; he continued, before adding: &quot;Your clothes … give them to me, now.&quot;

At least Spurs get to play the second leg on the lush emerald turf of White Hart Lane, where knees are protected by the spongy top soil and the ball bounces just so, where each blade caresses the sole and each nubbin of earth smells of freshly laundered sheets. Surely now the hard part is done. &quot;After what happened it would be a mistake to say the hard part is done,&quot; said Niko Kranjcar. Ah … &quot;I think the hard part is coming for us.&quot;

 QUOTE OF THE DAY 

&quot;The fact that [Yaya] Touré has left does not mean anything because there are other team-mates who can play in his position, like [Seydou] Keita, or even Xavi or [Andrés] Iniesta&quot; - Sergio Busquets&apos;s protestations that Barcelona don&apos;t need to strengthen their midfield will come as a surprise to Arsenal fans following the Catalan club&apos;s highly dignified summer pursuit of Cesc Fábregas.

 NICOLAS THE GREAT 

The Fiver can do insouciance. Some days it leaves its hovel without an umbrella even when the weather forecast says there&apos;s a 23% chance of rain. Sometimes it arrives at 5.17pm even though it&apos;s specifically called the Fiver and not the Five-Seventeener. The truth is that this is one tea-time email that just don&apos;t give a flip about anybody else. In fact, the Fiver isn&apos;t even sure you spell insouciance &quot;insouciance&quot;, it just typed the letters out, sat back in front of the television and waited for the microwaves to wash it out to sea. And then had a quick look on spell checker.

But the Fiver can&apos;t hold a flame to Nicolas Anelka, the Gallic shrug made flesh. You may remember back in the mists of yesterday the FFF gave Nic an 18-match ban for his role in France&apos;s mutiny during the World Cup. Today, Nic had his own say: &quot;I&apos;m bitterly disappointed that the FFF has arrived at this conclusion but fully understand the decision and wish them the best of luck in the future. I&apos;m fully confident Les Bleus can prosper at Euro 20 ...&quot;

Pah! Of course he didn&apos;t. He did what he does best and lined up all 845 of his snooks in a row and c0cked them individually at the FFF. Not that he cares anyway because he&apos;s dead insouciant. &quot;[The FFF] are real clowns, these people,&quot; said Anelka, doubling up with laughter. &quot;I am doubled up with laughter.&quot; Is it just the Fiver, or has Anelka been on a steady, upward curve of likeability since he was the most reviled 17-year-old in world football?

There was more as well. &quot;For me, this whole thing with the commission is an aberration, a masquerade to make sure they don&apos;t lose face. They have punished a void, as Nicolas Anelka never existed in this pitiful and colourful affair,&quot; he said slipping into the third person, or the Phil Brown person as it&apos;s more commonly known in football circles.

The Fiver would add some analysis about who will replace Anelka in the France team at this point but it&apos;ll probably just go and sneer at some old people. Before it apologises and asks if they need any help crossing the road.

 FIVER LETTERS 

&quot;Re: yesterday&apos;s Quote of the Day. Could Ledley King&apos;s mortar and pestle knee really grind its way to a vital organ over the course of 90 minutes playing on Astroturf? I think that the &apos;Mythbusters&apos; could have a soccer special there&quot; - Edward Wellard.

&quot;While hoping Peter Andre decides to mind his own business re: Peter Crouch&apos;s alleged misdemeanours (yesterday&apos;s Bits and Bobs), how seriously can we take the relationship advice of a man who married Jordan?&quot; - Rob McEvoy.

&quot;I&apos;d like to call on the club-to-support-searching Parvez Thekkumpurath (Fiver letters passim) to support Tranmere Rovers. If I&apos;m successful in finding another fan for the club then they can act as a replacement for me and I won&apos;t feel I have to go any more. In fact, if you can start this Saturday, Parvez, I can attend my daughter&apos;s sixth birthday party guilt-free while I&apos;m deciding which club I want to support in the future. Cheers&quot; - Adam Valentine.

Send your letters to the.boss@guardian.co.uk . And if you&apos;ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver now.

 BITS AND BOBS 

Joe Cole has been found guilty of clocking 105mph in his Audi A4 on the A3 last November. The Liverpool midfielder will have to pay £600 costs, while his sentencing has been adjourned until 27 August.

Mnwhl, Lvrpl tm-mt Mrtn Skrtl wll b styng pt tl 2014 hvng sgnd hs nw cntrct.

Rounding off a busy day for Liverpool, Brad Jones&apos;s £2.3m move from Middlesbrough has also been confirmed.

Samir Nasri will miss Arsenal&apos;s opening Big Cup skirmishes after being ruled out for a month by knee-knack.

New figures show Football League clubs paid out £12.7m in fees to assorted Mr 10%s last season – a rise of £3.9m from the previous year.

Blackpool&apos;s relentless march towards a Big Cup place has continued with the acquisition of Israel international Dekel Keinan.

And Chinese Super League side Shandong Luneng have sent former captain Jiao Zhe to the reserve team, suspended his salary and fined him 30,000 yuan for beating up team-mate Zhang Chi after last weekend&apos;s 2-1 win over Chongqing. &quot;It is not as simple as kicking him out now and calling him back later,&quot; explained boss Han Gongzheng. &quot;We must give him a warning, a lesson to learn.&quot;

 STILL WANT MORE? 

If you&apos;ve ever read surreal Haruki Murakami novels or watched Inception you might understand tactics-bongo-peddler Jonathan Wilson &apos;s definition of a playmaker in The Question . If not, good luck.

 Spurs shouldn&apos;t have had to face Young Boys on a plastic pitch , reckons Paul Wilson , who paints himself into a corner by including the phrase, &quot;Call me a Luddite ...&quot;

Edgar Davids may bring creaking legs, weird goggles and bad jumpers to Selhurst Park if Crystal Palace sign him, but he&apos;ll also bring oodles of experience . And that&apos;s not a bad thing, reckons Dominic Fifield.

And praise the lord for this week&apos;s Knowledge in which John Ashdown delves into the world of god-botherering footballers who devoted themselves to religion after hanging up their boots. Amen.

 Last-Minute Summer Fun for Kids

I won’t lie to you, I’ve started my countdown for the first day of school and I’m already planning my own personal celebration for that day. At the same time, I’m aware that summer is rapidly coming to an end, and there are a few fun summer activities that we haven’t yet completed as a family.


If you also feel some pressure to achieve last-minute memories of summer fun, here are some ideas to help!


 Head to the Library 


If your kids participated in summer reading, it&apos;s time to turn in those calendars for prizes! Usually when kids turn in a completed summer reading calendar, they get to choose a free book and they receive a packet of prizes that include coupons to local businesses – a sample of ours is a coupon for a free ice cream cone at McDonald’s, a coupon for free admission to the local aquatic park , and a free lunch at a pizza place in town.


Once you dig through the prizes, schedule when you’ll go out and use them during the last couple of weeks of summer for some free fun with your kids!

 Host a Play Date 


We haven’t had nearly the amount of play dates that I had intended when the summer started. Take these last few weeks and schedule a couple with friends and their kids. The parents can use the adult conversation while the kids burn off their energy!


 Get Wet at a Splash Park 

There’s a reason why these last days of summer are called “the dog days” – it’s hot! You may want to take your play date out on the town to one of your local splash park s. Schedule the time and place with friends and take a picnic full of snacks and water. Many times there are play structures nearby that the kids can also play on, alternating between heating up and cooling down. Don’t forget to bring a comfortable chair for lounging in the shade.


 Shop for Christmas Ideas 



Hanging out in a nearby store is a nice air-conditioned break from the heat. Explain to your kids that you&apos;re not going to buy anything AT ALL, and this is an opportunity to shop for fun. Have them bring along notebook paper to write their Christmas lists, and take your own notes of what your kids like along with prices of each item. Use that list to start your Christmas shopping, hunting for the best deals!


 Head to the Fair 

In our little corner of the world, we still have a county fair as well as the State Fair before school starts. This might cost a bit of money, but it’s probably a fun break that you all need. Search around for discount admission tickets, and plan on packing food and water for the day.


 Go Camping 


Reservations for camping at State Park s are made months in advance, but often have to be let go for a variety of reasons. This means last-minute open camping spots! If you want to go camping, keep a daily tab on the State Park s you’re interested in, and nab an open spot as it becomes available. Your kids can play, ride bikes, hike and participate in the activities sponsored by the park while you relax with a good book. Pack plenty of food and water, and you’re good to go for less than $20 a night.


 A Day Trip 


No matter where you live, there are summertime hot spots to hit before school starts. For us, it&apos;s the beach and the lake. We generally aren’t able to afford an overnight stay in a hotel, so we leave fairly early in the morning and take a fun day trip. With enough food, my kids will go anywhere. Don’t forget the sand and water toys, towels, a blanket and – most important – your camera to capture these last-minute summer memories!

 In Hollywood, Obama plays pitchman 
 [ Politics ] ( 44 )
By Scott Wilson LOS ANGELES - Concluding a long day of fund raising before a Hollywood crowd, President Obama framed his legislative accomplishments Monday evening as the &quot;most progressive&quot; in generations. His appearance at the home of John Wells, executive producer of television shows such as &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;ER,&quot; showed Obama tailoring his message to his audience, which was expected to include co-hosts Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg among other entertainment industry liberals.

His appearance at the home of John Wells, executive producer of television shows such as &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;ER,&quot; showed Obama tailoring his message to his audience, which was expected to include co-hosts Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg among other entertainment industry liberals. Earlier in the day, Obama made clear to an audience in Milwaukee, Wis., that the economic progress he is working for is without ideology. Wisconsin is a swing state , however, and even Democrats who attend fundraisers there tend to be more conservative than the Hollywood brand. &quot;I hope you understand why we&apos;re here tonight,&quot; Obama told those gathered at the Wells&apos; Hancock Park home. &quot;It&apos;s not to take a picture with the president. We&apos;re here

 Starbright Northwest Passages: Juan de Fuca Strait

What a beautiful morning no fog, moderate wind, flood tide, no Point Wilson rip.

Finally sailing, warm, sunny, quiet, moving right along. Note the picture at the top of today&apos;s entry that Admiral Barb is very tense on helm duty! Decided to anchor at Jones Island State Park . Beautiful little anchorage. A little crowded, but managed a stern tie at the mouth of the bay. Fellow sailors reading this will note in the picture that we set the anchor a little short on scope. As I write this, the wind is staying up through the evening, so we&apos;ll be setting the anchor alarms tonight. Looking out the stern of the boat, we are looking across boundary pass at Saturn Island. Canada tomorrow! 
 Boston Red Sox News&amp;Notes - 8/16

The Boston Red Sox should be very happy to leave the state of Texas as it means they won&apos;t have to see Texas Rangers starter C.J. Wilson anymore. Simply put, he&apos;s owned the Red Sox in 2010.

He came into the game having beat the Red Sox twice this season and had allowed one earned run over 13.1 innings pitched. Yesterday the domination continued as Wilson allowed just four hits and a run over 7 2/3 innings. All told on the season, Wilson allowed just two runs over 21 innings good for a 0.86 ERA.

 Daisuke Matsuzaka &apos;s final line of 6 2/3 innings, seven hits, four runs allowed, two walks and eight strikeouts wasn&apos;t indicative of his performance on Sunday in the sweltering Texas heat. He continued to attack with his fastball and had excellent command and movement on it. He evn had a nasty slider going but in the end it wasn&apos;t enough as the bullpen woes plagued the Red Sox once again.

With two outs in the 7th inning and two runners on base, Manny Delcarmen came in for Dice-K. Hitters had been 0 for their last 15 against MDC but Michael Young changed all that as he took a changeup that was left out over the plate for a three-run homer that pushed the Rangers lead to 5-0.

After Wilson left with two outs in the 8th, the Red Sox rallied against Pedro Strop .

 Marco Scutaro hit a double to deep left that scored Eric Patterson and he quickly came in on a Darnell McDonald home run to cut the lead to 5-3. But in the bottom of the 8th, the bullpen ( Dustin Richardson , Michael Bowden ) allowed two more runs to pretty much eliminate any chance of a Red Sox comeback.

As I&apos;ve said before, if the Red Sox don&apos;t make the playoffs injuries will obviously be one reason why they don&apos;t make it. The other reason will be the ineffectiveness of the bullpen, particularly in middle relief. And I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll see Theo Epstein addressing this for the 2011 season but the question remains why hasn&apos;t he done anything for 2010.

The good news is that Dustin Pedroia will rejoin the Red Sox tomorrow when they return to action at Fenway Park against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Hopefully Pedroia can provide a big s park and push the Red Sox towards a spot in the 2010 postseason.

They&apos;ll need it as they trail the Tampa Bay Rays by five games in the AL Wild Card with 43 games to go.

With the Red Sox being off today, we&apos;ll be by later with the pitching matchups but for now enjoy the overnight links after the jump.

&apos;So what do you want to do with your life?&apos; Six teenage boys look to the future

Jordan Campbell, the firefighter from south London: &apos;I have always looked to a better world&apos;

People have different reasons for going off the rails but I&apos;ve always looked to a better world and, the way I see it, there&apos;s never a reason to do wrong. I was in care since I was about three weeks old, but I&apos;ve never been arrested or anything like that and people from my background usually are. I&apos;ve been around so many people like that, but I&apos;ve kept my head straight and I&apos;ve done my own thing and now I&apos;m joining the fire brigade.

I&apos;m more understanding now than when I was young. When I was young no one would explain to me the reasons for things. That&apos;s how social services are. They&apos;ll do things and they won&apos;t fill you in and then your social worker will just leave. Getting to know that you&apos;re not safe around so many people at an age like that can really mess up your head, but I&apos;ve learned to overcome myself a lot. I&apos;ve been round different types of people, good and bad.

Every school&apos;s got bullies. I didn&apos;t get bullied that badly, just childish things. I never bunked off, never, because I had no life at home. The first high school I went to closed down because it was so crap and the bad education there messed me up. There was a fight every day in the classroom, everyone had knives. My friend stabbed me in the hand as a joke and I&apos;ve still got the scar. Did I forgive him? Yeah, it&apos;s not really a big problem. People put a label on you, I&apos;ve noticed that as well, that&apos;s one thing that makes it hard to be 18. If I was in a group of 30 white people walking down Oxford Street, no one would say anything, but if I was wearing a hoodie and with 30 black people, the armed police would have stopped us before we&apos;d taken 10 steps.

I&apos;m kind of sarcastic sometimes and teachers didn&apos;t like that. There was one teacher who was gay and I&apos;d joke around with it sometimes. Once he was telling me off and in front of the whole class I said, &quot;All right, sir, I accept your apology&quot; and he was confused for a bit. I would annoy people like that on purpose. I got on with all my teachers though. The attitude at school was &quot;just turn up&quot;, but then again if you don&apos;t choose to prepare yourself for exams, teachers can&apos;t be blamed for that. Some people do need to be pushed but really it&apos;s only you that can push yourself to do well. People always have a choice in life. Some people just aren&apos;t choosing the right path. In my GCSEs I got a D in English, a D in maths, and a C in science. But I redeemed myself: I got certificates for adult English and adult numeracy and a first-aid certificate. Then I went to college.

If I could go back and do school again I&apos;d have a different attitude. I&apos;d focus more on what I wanted instead of expecting something to come forth for me. Some guys say they don&apos;t know what they want to be when they&apos;re older and they expect things just to fall in place, but it can&apos;t work like that. When I was a kid I wanted to be tall and good-looking – and it came true!

Yaw Asamoah, the optimist from Cardiff: &apos;Mum is trying to have faith in me, but it&apos;s hard for her&apos;

I was born in Ghana and my family moved to Cardiff when I was about one. I went to primary school in this country and then when I was nine I went back to Ghana to live with my dad until I was 12.

When I returned to school here I did find it quite a shock. They have a lot of resources here in Cardiff and obviously they put a lot of money into the schools. As for Ghana, you had to pay school fees in order to qualify for learning. My dad worked with the church there as a minister so I didn&apos;t have to pay anything – but I saw other kids get kicked out of school because their parents couldn&apos;t pay.

Ghana isn&apos;t a very rich country, so the kids are more motivated to do the things that they want, whereas here children have so many opportunities that they feel like they&apos;re pretty much set. At secondary school I hung around people who did work hard, and the ones that didn&apos;t I tried to avoid in case they kind of rubbed off on me. They were also the troublemakers.

Back in Ghana I felt more at home, but when I came here I felt like I had more opportunities so I can&apos;t really decide which I like more. But it doesn&apos;t matter because I want to go to Japan anyway and get a job animating – I&apos;m studying graphic design at college at the moment. God gave me the skills of creation and stuff so I can go into this animation business, and then added to that there&apos;s my passion for it. I think it&apos;s a set destiny for me so that&apos;s why I&apos;m not really worried about how difficult it is to get a job. I am a pretty optimistic guy too.

My mum is concerned about me wanting to be an animator – what with the credit crunch, she wants me to get a more secure job. She&apos;s a nurse and she wants me to be a doctor or a pharmacist – something that will pay well, that&apos;s in high demand. But the thing is, I know she means well, but that&apos;s just not for me. We do have a good relationship, but when she brings that up it saddens me a bit. It&apos;s like she&apos;s trying to have faith in me but it&apos;s hard for her. And I&apos;m trying to tell her that it will all be OK – I will find something.

Kieran Webber, the surfer from Cornwall: &apos;Unless I break my back or lose a leg, I&apos;ll surf for ever&apos;

When I was in secondary school I was a bit of an idiot. I&apos;d muck around, I used to talk all the time. I just wasn&apos;t really interested in anything in school. I found it all a bore and a joke and fully took the mick. The worst thing I probably did was skateboard through the school hall, one side to the other, when everyone was eating. I remember one teacher telling me: &quot;You&apos;re a clever lad but you just never knew how to use it&quot; and it was obviously quite annoying for them because they knew I could do well but I just had no intention in doing so. In my stupidity, I didn&apos;t revise for my GCSEs, thinking I&apos;d base it on my natural knowledge. Eventually I&apos;ve realised that life&apos;s a bit more serious than skating through a hall and answering back.

Girls are definitely better behaved. I think they mature faster, so they have a different mind-set. I&apos;ve always thought girls have been more settled with their heads down. We were sat boy/girl/boy/girl at my school because it got so bad: the girls were literally sat to break us up. It was really effective because you don&apos;t want to look like an idiot in front of a girl. If I could go back and talk to my 16-year-old self, I&apos;d say: &quot;You&apos;ve been an idiot now, you&apos;ve had your fun. Get your head down, open a few books and read and just revise, revise, revise. Trust me, mate, it&apos;s going to be better in the long run.&quot;

The moment I caught my first wave I was hooked, I just loved it from that moment. I was about 15 and I had to keep it going. The rush when you go down that wave is incredible. Plus, you look pretty good when you walk out of the sea with a board and in a wet suit. Unless I break my back or lose my leg, I&apos;ll do it for ever.

One of my teachers, Mr Wilson , is a bit of a role model, I&apos;ve looked up to him over the past year or so. He was the head of business at my school [Treviglas College] at the time, but he was also the head of Newquay Surf Academy and he said the course was perfect for me - the modules count towards a place at Plymouth University to do surf science and technology. There&apos;s elements of sport, biology, travel, marine science thrown in, all sorts of crazy stuff. You surf twice a week and that&apos;s compulsory - I was pretty happy when they said that. I never thought I could really do something through surfing, that I could really use something I love and be what I wanted to be. I would absolutely love to have my own surf shop down here, but I&apos;d put a unique twist on it and do surf tours around the UK. I&apos;ve had my eyes opened to learning about something you&apos;re interested in. Learning is the key and knowledge is the power. Now I walk out of each lesson knowing I&apos;ve learned something - I never had that at school. Treviglas was a good school but I got this idea that they wanted everyone to leave wearing a suit, and for a lot of people down here it&apos;s not what they want - they want to walk out wearing a wet suit, not an Armani suit.

Harry Thorne, the scholar from Ipswich: &apos;There&apos;s more of a negative view towards guys than girls&apos;

I&apos;m working hard, but I think I&apos;ve found the right balance between work and socialising and all the extracurricular stuff – it&apos;s taken years, but I think I&apos;ve got it. I&apos;m fairly motivated but I think that&apos;s just how I am – I always work hard when it&apos;s something that I enjoy, but I&apos;m less committed to something that I don&apos;t see a point in. I&apos;d say that teachers pay more attention to the guys in making sure they work, so in that sense, there is more of a negative view towards them. There&apos;s also an overemphasis on keeping guys in line, whereas with the girls they overlook [bad behaviour] and don&apos;t expect it from them.

I think things might have been different if I hadn&apos;t gone to a school – the way that my character is, I think that if I&apos;d been allowed more freedom, which I presume I might have got at a state school, then I don&apos;t think I would have achieved as much as I have. I work harder with compliments and respect and gaining good grades. I&apos;ve just accepted that&apos;s how I work, and that&apos;s what I strive for. Ideally I&apos;d like to go to Cambridge, but that&apos;s ideally. I am still holding out hope for the ideal ending to the school situation, as in, I think if I can get the work done, then I can achieve the Cambridge thing.

Thayyab Ahmed, the lad from Gloucestershire: &apos;If kids had more responsibility they wouldn&apos;t turn to drugs&apos;

At this age you&apos;re caught in the middle because you&apos;re not quite a kid but you&apos;re not treated as an adult, even though on paper you are one. The whole time I&apos;ve been in school I&apos;ve been waiting to leave, absolutely looking forward to the moment, but when it happened it was actually quite saddening. If I was given a choice to go back and do another year at school I&apos;d take it because as soon as you leave you realise you can&apos;t really mess about, that you&apos;re never going to be a schoolboy again. I suppose I&apos;m reluctant to grow up. But I guess everyone&apos;s got to sometime.

My parents and I differ on quite a lot of things. They&apos;re Muslim and when my dad was younger he was really driven: he moved over here from India when he was 16 and he barely spoke the language so he spent most of his youth trying to catch up with people who were born here. But I&apos;ve got quite a cushty life so I&apos;m maybe less focused than he was. When he sees me going out and messing about, he&apos;ll say &quot;you should be doing something useful&quot; because that&apos;s what he was doing at that age.

His circumstances were very different to mine so he can&apos;t really relate to me and sometimes I can&apos;t relate to him. He&apos;s a manager in an aerospace company. It sounds interesting on paper, but if you met him you&apos;d think he&apos;s quite boring. I&apos;m one of five so my mum has a kind of full-time housewife duty. I was brought up in a religious way and I do identify myself as a Muslim but I don&apos;t have the strength to do some of the things. In my mind, I&apos;ll become more religious when I get older and a bit more mature, but at this age, it&apos;s quite hard. At this age everyone&apos;s out to have a good time and things just happen spontaneously.

I&apos;m going to university in October, to do economics at Warwick, but I&apos;m not sure if I want to go yet. If I was less clever I&apos;d probably work harder: because I know I can get away with it I don&apos;t really push myself. I&apos;m one of those people who can take the textbook out a couple of weeks before the exam and learn everything then – I didn&apos;t do the hard work at school but I got the grades in the end. It was a boys&apos; grammar and boys will be boys: there was a lot of laddish behaviour.

I think people my age expect too much. In modern society everything&apos;s done for you. If kids our age had a bit more responsibility they wouldn&apos;t turn to drugs or crime. A hundred years ago boys finished school and went to work and they had a sense of responsibilty - responsibility acts as a dampener on attitudes. It&apos;s because we&apos;ve got nothing to do that we feel we have to do something to define ourselves - to do crazy things from time to time to make ourselves stand out. I&apos;ve been in trouble with the police a few times but I&apos;ve got no regrets - even stupid stuff that I&apos;ve done, I just think at least I&apos;ve done it, at least I know better now. I like learning things the hard way, that&apos;s the only way to do it. I can&apos;t stand someone else telling me not to do something. It&apos;s all about experience, good or bad, that&apos;s what life&apos;s about really. We&apos;re making it up as we go along and that&apos;s the best thing about being young.

Devon Gadsby, the drifter from Essex: &apos;I&apos;m praying for a big break&apos;

I didn&apos;t really go to school that much, I bunked off quite a lot because I thought I had better stuff to do. It&apos;s so stupid that I thought going out with my friends and sitting in the park was more important. If we had money, and found some mug stupid enough to buy it for us, then we would drink – but not a lot of the time. My parents thought I was going to school. Sometimes I&apos;d get caught and the school would tell my parents, but most of the time they didn&apos;t know. I didn&apos;t really think about what was after school. I think I&apos;d have tried to do better and go to school more, but bunking off was so easy to get away with. You&apos;d just walk out of the gate and that was it. I got four Gs at GCSE, it&apos;s really poor.

I got on with my teachers really well – on a personal level as well. But none of it interested me enough to keep me there. That&apos;s the same with jobs – if I&apos;m not interested then I&apos;m not going to do it. I don&apos;t just go to work for money. I worked at a barber&apos;s for a bit, but I felt like they were treating me like a proper cock. Now I look back and realise it was just me complaining about everything. It was just harmless banter, but I didn&apos;t take it too well, so I left.

Money&apos;s important to me but I have no idea at all how I&apos;m going to make it. I&apos;m just praying I&apos;ll have a big break or something, &apos;cos at the moment I&apos;m going round to hairdressers trying to get a job at any of them.

 At 62, Ted Nugent still firing opinions, arrows and rock &apos;n&apos; roll 
 [ Las Vegas Sun ] ( Las Vegas Sun Blogs: &apos;The Kats Report&apos; )
He is to be interviewed, but first he has some questions. “I don’t want to be rude, but are you a big dog, John?” Ted Nugent says. “Are you a writing fool?” “They call me Kats, and I am a fool, yes.” “Good! I want you to get my strange manipulation of the English language. It’s called creative license.

He is to be interviewed, but first he has some questions.

“I don’t want to be rude, but are you a big dog, John?” Ted Nugent says. “Are you a writing fool?”

“They call me Kats, and I am a fool, yes.”

“Good! I want you to get my strange manipulation of the English language. It’s called creative license. It’s like a machine-gun license, which I give out every night to the children,” Nugent says, the verbal bullets reverberating over the phone line as he relaxes at his ranch in south-central Michigan. “How tuned in are you to this royal cluster (blank) of rumors that the NRA is going to endorse Harry Reid. Are you familiar with that outrage?”

There is talk of that, I say, and have seen some coverage of it. I add, “It would not be that outrageous, because Harry Reid did help start the Clark County Shooting Park here. He was at the groundbreaking a few years ago, and also the grand opening. I saw him shoot trap out there and he’s pretty good. He helped make it happen.”

“I see,” says Nugent, who performs Saturday night at Buffalo Bill’s Star of the Dessert Arena. “It was a big moment for him. The reason I ask is, before I called, my phone rang and a big gun collector from Texas called me. He’s a guy who has donated just tons of money to the NRA, and he calls me -- and he is one of hundreds of calls asking me, ‘Nuge! What do you know about the NRA endorsing Harry Reid?!’

“So I had a direct Nevada connection before calling. But being that this is the ultimate tour of my life, Harry Reid doesn’t represent Jack Squat in my life.”

That’s where Ted Nugent is coming from. To millions of rock fans, he’s a guitar god. But to millions of Americans who are devoted to hunting with any assortment of weapons – particularly a bow and arrow – he has long been a deity of a different sort. For nearly 40 years he has been an aggressive, even obnoxious, advocate of Second Amendment rights and the practice of the primal lifestyle, where, as he says, “You have can’t grill it until you to kill it.”

Nugent doesn’t conduct many phoners these days, but he did agree to this one to help goose interest in the show at Buffalo Bill’s. Some other nuggets from “The Nuge.”:

 On his musical inspirations: “Here it is in a nutshell: The purity of my response to what Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry started was as pure as you can get. I think Billy Gibbons said, in a tribute to Bo Diddley when (Diddley) died (in 2008) was that if a newborn baby was coming out of the womb and Bo Diddley’s song was playing, it would do the gyration to the groove – you can’t not groove to that. If you are a free soul, an open and attentive soul, you cannot ignore what Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley did. I was born in a time when Les Paul had just invented the electric guitar, so it was pure and it was primal.”

 On playing Primm’s Buffalo Bill’s Star of the Desert : “If they have electricity and class-three weapons owners, I’ve probably been there. But I don’t think I’ve played there before, no. I’ve not been in that particular berg, no. But they deserve me. I hear they’ve got some real rock ’n’ roll attitudes there. They need me.”

 On his current band: “I’ve been with Mick Brown on drums and Greg Smith on bass guitar, for about six years now, these guys … there’s no words describe it, but I’ll attempt to convey the insanity of it all: I had my guitar tech, Craig Colburn, who worked with me throughout the ’60s and ’70s, right up until 1982. So he was there right up until what would be considered the peak of mayhem, when all my records were smash hits and I pretty much ran the world. He came to a show we did at this just beautiful house-of-blues-type place in Ft. Lauderdale, called the Revolution, of all names. “

“He was not ready for this. It was tighter, more ferocious than ever. We went through 2 ½ hours and he came backstage and was literally crying. He’d been out of the business, working with the Three Tenors, had had cancer, and he said it was just awesome. He said, ‘If a 25-year-old Ted Nugent showed up, you’d kick his a--.’ ”

 On being a self-described a “Commando of the Road”: At age 62, with double-knee surgery, I should probably be in some rehab right now, which according to the snuggle Mrs. Nugent gave me awhile ago, I qualify. But no, I’m defying gravity and I do celebrate in no uncertain terms a certain youthful quality. I keep going back to these state fairs and setting attendance records, and even at these wild, House of Blues-type chaos zones, I ask for the kids to take a good look at me. I’m talking, pre-teen kids. Lots of them. And I say, “My name’s Ted Nugent, and the reason this is happening, the reason this is so much fun, the reason I have so much energy is because, I am 62 years old and clean and sober.

“Write it down. And that’s what I attribute this to. I’ve taken such good care of myself.”

 On his musical inspirations: “Here it is in a nutshell: The purity of my response to what Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry started was as pure as you can get. I think Billy Gibbons said, in a tribute to Bo Diddley when (Diddley) died (in 2008) was that if a newborn baby was coming out of the womb and Bo Diddley’s song was playing, it would do the gyration to the groove – you can’t not groove to that. If you are a free soul, an open and attentive soul, you cannot ignore what Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley did. I was born in a time when Les Paul had just invented the electric guitar, so it was pure and it was primal.”

 On how playing rock ’n’ roll plays into his cultural activism: “As I continued to hone and maniacally plunge myself into finding my Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley grind -- I didn’t even know I wanted mine, theirs was the only one I was aspiring to – I realized that we’re all individuals. So in both my hyper-pursuit of the Chuck Berry-Bo Diddley licks – and I’m using those two as examples, but it’s a carpet-bomb, wallpaper state ment – I include Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, B.B. King, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam&amp;Dave, Wilson Pickett, James Brown and many others who were the godfathers of this – I had one foot in that primal scream music world, and I also had an equally intense foot in my dad’s bowhunting lifestyle.

“My dad was already a bowhunter, and I got to meet and know Fred Bear , who was the godfather of modern bowhunting. And there’s not a big chasm between that world and what inspired Bo and Chuck, and they’re talking about rugged individuality and self-sufficiency and the Declaration of Independence, that purity tat was now projected into a soundtrack …

“But I’m the only guy who thinks this way, and I’m not thinking. I’m convinced of it, beyond the shadow of a doubt.”

 On the network news special that helped change his life: “About 1974 or ’75 (Sept. 5, 1975, actually), CBS aired this special called, “The Guns of Autumn,” and Dan Rather narrated this lie after lie after manipulated imagery, condemning and demonizing my purity, my clean and sober lifestyle, my quality hunting trips with my family, in defiance of the drugs and alcohol and the puking and insanity of my so-called peers -- and I’ve never had any peers, so that’s another story. I’d just shot a beautiful muledeer buck in Colorado, and I’m watching this guy on a major network claiming that what I do is horrible. …

“It really was the Guns of Autumn when I went, ‘I’m not a rock star. I don’t want to be a rock star. I want to be a musician.’ But I know what it means to be a celebrity, and how you have that access to the media. I know what a bully pulpit is, and I have an absolute honor-bound duty to participate in this experiment in self-government. … And I was attacked for it, by people who think heroin addiction is just fine, or who think drinking and driving is OK. … In 1975 I had a bumper-crop of F-yous.”

 On the potential fallout of taking such an activist stance: “All of my business associates clamored for me to shut up. And that just made me turn up the heat.”

 On his father’s opinion of his music: “My dad hated my music – hated it!”

 On a possible reunion of the super group Damn Yankees: “We did an industry gig recently, in January. The greatest thing about Damn Yankees is that they just happen, they just spontaneously erupt. And it was just kind of, shrug your shoulders, “Jam with Tommy Shaw on Thursday? I can do that!” kind of thing. That purity is the same as mine. Those are the kind of world-class virtuosos I’ve worked with in my career, Tommy and Jack (Blades) and Michael (Cartellone). The fire is still there, but everybody is so busy, all of us. … It would have to be organic, as organic as my gut piles.”

 A New York Times article, &quot; Plagiarism Lines Blur for Students in Digital Age ,&quot; discusses a growing concern among educators, writing tutors, and college disciplinarians: the fact that &quot;students simply do not grasp that using words they did not write is a serious misdeed.&quot; Not only does the internet make copying text easy, but it desensitizes students from the severity of plagiarism: &quot;concepts of intellectual property, copyright and originality are under assault in the unbridled exchange of online information.&quot; The result? According to some, students are getting lazy; they&apos;re not coming up with any new, creative ideas on their own; and they&apos;re becoming increasingly ignorant, not to mention apathetic, towards the virtue of authenticity and the lack of integrity associated with plagiarism.  

 Tuition fees for overseas students (living outside the EU) have risen at British universities, going above £10,000 (about $15,590) for the first time, an increase of more than 5% in the last year. British graduate programs are experiencing similar increases, putting both undergrad and graduate programs at risk for reducing their appeal to foreign students. EU undergrads in Britain will pay about £3,290 for 2010-11, while grad students will pay upwards towards £5,214, the latter a 16% increase from the previous year. Some EU institutions remain free of charge for at-home and for overseas students. But, according to the Inside Higher Ed article that covers this story, this is likely to change to in the near future.

David D&apos;Alessandro of The Star-Ledger: &quot;Stop the presses, or whatever it is that you use to upload words with these days: The Commish has finally seen the light with regard to the excessive toll that international competition takes on a certain portion of our population. In his case, the revenue-producing portion. We’ve been beating this issue to death since the 2002 Worlds in Indianapolis, or after 12 guys from Team USA missed an average of 13 games in ’02-03.

 David D&apos;Alessandro of The Star-Ledger: &quot;Stop the presses, or whatever it is that you use to upload words with these days: The Commish has finally seen the light with regard to the excessive toll that international competition takes on a certain portion of our population. In his case, the revenue-producing portion. ... We’ve been beating this issue to death since the 2002 Worlds in Indianapolis, or after 12 guys from Team USA missed an average of 13 games in ’02-03. Heck, some of us were writing about it after the Barcelona party wiped out the ’92-93 season for guys like Clyde Drexler and Chris Mullin, or after the Toronto event in the summer of ’94 all but wrecked the ’94-95 seasons for Derrick Coleman, Joe Dumars, Kevin Johnson and Mark Price. But that stuff never mattered in the league’s noble pursuit of sheckles. It’s been obvious to anyone with a working brain that owners who allow their $100-million commodities to play three extra weeks in the summer are playing with fire, and only a handful of people (Mark Cuban and Sam Mitchell among them) had the guts to question the nanny state and flout Stern’s directive to shut up about the risks. Now Commish admits there is a risk. Imagine that. After 18 years of shouting people down about it. Must be getting soft.&quot; Richard Sandomir of The New York Times: &quot;When the Isiah Thomas announcement was made via news release at about 1 p.m., it had been a done deal since the night before. But it was not made known until after Garden officials held a conference call to discuss their second-quarter financial results. Clearly, no one wanted to stun any hoops-loving Wall Street analysts on the call. But the news about Thomas’s return was out in time for the stock market to react. The market, which has been through enough shocks in the last three years, fortunately did not panic. In the two hours after the news broke, Garden stock fell by 17 cents a share in trading on Nasdaq. Then it rallied to close up three cents. Maybe that boost in value will help pay Thomas’s retainer. On Monday, the stock rose 20 cents to $20.41 share -- perhaps on speculation that the N.B.A. may nullify the Garden deal because Thomas is already under contract to coach Florida International University’s basketball team. Creating a positive image in sports and corporate circles has rarely been a concern of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman and overlord of the Garden. So it was less a surprise than a disappointment that he is ushering Thomas back to the Knicks, which is now part of the publicly traded Madison Square Garden. ... It is certainly Dolan’s prerogative to hire anyone he wishes and to do the wrong thing whenever he chooses. And if his decision-making creates chaos or even the perception that he is usurping Walsh, whom he belatedly but rightly brought in to undo his and Thomas’s mess, he seems not to care.&quot; John DeShazier of The Times-Picayune: &quot;The NBA officially will release the 2010-11 regular-season schedule on Tuesday. I&apos;m a lot less interested in who the New Orleans Hornets will be playing, and when, than in who will be playing for the Hornets. As it stands, the Hornets of the upcoming season essentially will look no different than the Hornets of last season. As it stands, New Orleans&apos; hopes will rest on improved health and new offensive and defensive systems installed by first-year coach Monty Williams. Now, that&apos;s not a hopeless formula. If Chris Paul plays 75 to 80 games, as opposed to the 45 he played last season, the Hornets almost are guaranteed to win more than 37 games. If everyone else shows up dedicated and in shape and receptive to change, then we can&apos;t rightfully declare it&apos;s impossible for New Orleans to climb out of the lottery and back into the playoffs. But the odds aren&apos;t all that favorable for that combination of things to happen, either. Not with everyone else counting on some of the same things, plus roster tweaks and improvements.&quot; Michael Cunningham of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: &quot;It seems Al Horford’s comments about playing power forward caused a frenzy among my blog people. Actually, it seems any news that potentially means Marvin Williams goes to the bench gets people excited.But as far as I can tell Al’s comments reflect what I wrote last week: Larry Drew plans to use a &apos;big&apos; rotation that includes Twin (Jason Colins) and also will use Al and Zaza Pachuila together. It doesn’t mean a change in the starting lineup but rather more combinations of bigs and a deeper rotation. I can’t see how shifting Smoove to small forward would ever be a good move. I know he played the 3 as a rookie but when I talked to him about that he didn’t seem too enthusiastic about going back. Why take a guy whose forte is defending the paint away from the glass? Wasn’t that one major weakness of the switching D? And do you really think Al would be a better power forward than Smoove, or at least so much better that it’s worth it to stick Josh out on the perimeter guarding the best athletes in the league? At the very least, don’t you want to see how Marvin looks under LD before such a drastic and potentially counterproductive move is made?&quot; Lacy J. Banks of the Chicago Sun-Times: &quot;It&apos;s only fitting that Michael Jordan will present Scottie Pippen because they were the only players on all six of the Bulls&apos; championship teams during the 1990s. Many call Pippen one of greatest sidekicks in NBA history. Many also say Jordan is the primary reason Pippen won six rings and is being inducted into the Hall. But Pippen, a seven-time All-Star, made his own mark by averaging 16.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists in his 17-year career. He also was known for his smothering defense. When Jordan was inducted into the Hall last year, he surprised many when he chose David Thompson to present him. Thompson, who was Jordan&apos;s boyhood hero, starred at North Carolina State before going on to a nine-year NBA career that featured four All-Star selections. Because Pippen is only two years younger than Jordan, he can&apos;t call him a boyhood hero. But he did watch and admire Jordan while playing his last three years at Central Arkansas. Pippen actually will be honored twice Friday because he&apos;ll be inducted as a member of the United State s&apos; 1992 Olympic gold-medal-winning Dream Team, too. He was joined on that team by Jordan, Malone, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Charles Barkley, among others.&quot; Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press: &quot;This is not just about basketball. I&apos;m guessing what the Ilitches really covet is the Palace, Palace Sports&amp;Entertainment, and the possibilities of having a hammerlock on entertainment in metro Detroit. Think of it. They&apos;d have the Fox, the Masonic, Cobo, Comerica Park , the Palace, DTE Energy, Meadow Brook and whatever new arena the Wings and Pistons would play in. There&apos;s not a concert, convention, truck show or rodeo they couldn&apos;t book. They already have the guy who ran the Palace entertainment side -- Tom Wilson -- under their employ. The Ilitches are smart people. They are family-oriented. And, yes, they are sentimental -- but rarely at the cost of good business. They didn&apos;t keep Tiger Stadium alive forever. They&apos;ve parted company with popular players. I&apos;m sure Mr. Ilitch would like to see the Pistons stay in Detroit as opposed to, say, moving to Las Vegas, but he&apos;s not going to fork over $300 million or $400 million to spare a weepy good-bye. You best believe this makes business sense for the Ilitch family -- and it should. Detroit is a tough market right now, and there&apos;s not exactly a line of people dying to throw money at us. In the end, if they can get their price, the Ilitches have more synergy than a lone sports tycoon, and they have a history with the city that make fans feel assured.&quot; Bob Wojnowski of The Detroit News: &quot;Detroit. Go for it. It&apos;s the Ilitch Mantra, in the pizza business, in the sports business, in the competitive realm. So this makes perfect sense, that Mike Ilitch would announce his intention Monday to pursue a purchase of the Pistons. It&apos;s a welcomed, fascinating foray, no matter where it leads. It&apos;s also not a surprise, even though Mike and Marian Ilitch never have expressed much interest in the NBA. It would make business sense because it&apos;s the only logical way a much-needed arena will get built downtown, to house the Red Wings and Pistons. It makes emotional sense because the Pistons are in trouble and Ilitch cherishes Detroit and its history and loves to rehabilitate -- from the Wings, to the Tigers to the Foxtown area.&quot; Jody Genessy of the Deseret News: &quot;Who is the best power forward of all time? Is it the current popular choice of Tim Duncan? Perhaps Charles Barkley? One of the Kevins (McHale, Garnett or Durant)? Maybe Dirk Nowitzki or an old-timer like Bob Pettit or Elvin Hayes? Or could it be the postal carrier that would carry the vote in Louisiana and Utah? So, Mailman, are you the best ever? &apos;I don&apos;t know,&apos; Malone answered when asked the question during a recent KSL-TV interview. Malone admitted that he never even thought about those types of things during his playing days. &apos;Being the best power forward or the best player,&apos; he said, &apos;I will tell you without a doubt I never thought I was.&apos; When it came to being ready to play, however, Malone definitely believes he held that advantage.&quot; Bob Cooney of the Philadelphia Daily News: &quot;Though his profession has enabled him to travel the world, it was Willie Green&apos;s first time in Africa, and it affected him to his core. &apos;It really makes you appreciate the style of living that we are able to have in being fortunate enough to play basketball for a living,&apos; Green said. &apos;Waking up and playing basketball is our way of life, and it affords us a very good life. Being here [in Africa] so makes you appreciate the things we have, the things we love. It really brings you back to reality. Seeing the kids here, their faces and eyes light up when they see players from the NBA. Here we are, thousands of miles away from the U.S., and they are so happy to see us up close, to give us a handshake, to give us a hug. For the kids, it&apos;s a great experience for them, something they will always remember. But it&apos;s the same for us, maybe even more so. This is an experience that I, and the other players here, will certainly never forget.&apos; &quot; Dave Feschuk of the Toronto Star: &quot;The dearth of talented young referees is a problem everywhere from the pro ranks to local high schools, in basketball and other sports, and lately you can lay some blame on adults who should know better. Ron Foxcroft said 65 per cent of Hamilton’s high school referees quit after three years because they grow tired of the badgering from parents in the crowd. It’s a telling snapshot of the current climate of hyper-criticism that carries on up the ladder to the pro ranks. Never have referees been under more scrutiny. Never before have the masses displayed so little patience with the failings of human beings engaged in the difficult work of bang-bang judgment calls. &apos;The negativity weighs on our (referees),&apos; Ronnie Nunn said. What isn’t pointed out often enough is that calling an NBA game has to be one of the hardest jobs in sports. And NBA refs -- for all the examples of badly botched decisions -- do an awfully good job, considering. Every call is evaluated, after all, by in-arena observers and by video analysis. And though the results of those evaluations aren’t made public, Nunn said the best NBA refs, when they blow the whistle, get the call correct 94 to 96 per cent of the time. When they don’t blow the whistle -- when it comes to non-calls on, say, a subjective level of body contact -- Nunn said the percentage dips to the high 80s or low 90s, even if players and coaches carry on as though nobody on their team has ever committed a foul.&quot; Jeff Caplan of the ESPNDallas.com: &quot;Dallas Mavericks guard Roddy Beaubois will have surgery on Friday to place a pin his broken left foot. Beaubois, 22, is expected to miss two to three months, which all but takes him out of training camp and possibly will sideline him for the beginning of the season in late October. &apos;It&apos;s a setback, but it&apos;s not the end of the world,&apos; Mavs president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said. &apos;It could have been worse. He could be a horse.&apos; That is true. At worst, it&apos;s a disappointing way for the Mavs to end the summer and look ahead to training camp in late September. Beaubois is clearly the wild card in for the 2010-11 season. Dallas is expecting its second-year shooting guard/point-guard-in-training to deliver dynamic scoring at the rim and beyond the 3-point arc.&quot; Mike Wells of The Indianapolis Star: &quot;I recently got an email from a reader saying he didn&apos;t think it would be a good idea for Danny Granger to play for Team USA because of the possibility of getting injured and he could tire down earlier during the NBA season. I have to disagree for a couple of different reasons. Granger should have fresh legs because he&apos;s had an extended offseason for four straight years. Making the team (he&apos;s currently with the squad in New York) will be the best thing to happen to Granger. He needs to be around players that know how to win and lead. Chauncey Billups. Kevin Durant. Derrick Rose. Rajon Rondo. Russell Westbrook. Lamar Odom. All those players listed above played in the playoffs last season. Rondo, Billups and Odom have won NBA titles. Granger can learn from those guys. Durant is a good guy to learn from, too, because he can score off the dribble and from the perimeter. Granger can learn from those guys.&quot; Dave Newhouse of The Oakland Tribune: &quot;No other surname in professional sports is as repulsive. The Warriors&apos; surname, which won&apos;t ever disgrace this space, also is meaningless. It doesn&apos;t reflect a city or state , thus it has no mayor, no governor, no voting precincts, no ZIP code. A more suitable surname, and easily more palatable, would be &apos;Oakland Warriors.&apos; ... What do I think the chances are of renaming the Warriors? Not good. You see in June, two weeks before the team&apos;s sale was announced, the Warriors changed their logo and their look once again -- new uniforms, new merchandise, new home court surface logo -- complete with that same disgusting surname. I believe Lacob and Guber agreed to that logo change. Otherwise, why would the old Warriors ownership seek to upset the new Warriors owners, who might begin firing staffers right and left as soon as they walk in the door? I just don&apos;t foresee the Oakland Warriors happening. And if that&apos;s the case, I wish the new owners nothing but futility dunking on their heads.&quot; Patricia Lee of The News&amp;Observer: &quot;Before his accident -- during which he hit a ditch and flipped over his handlebars -- Rodney Rogers worked for the city of Durham as a heavy equipment operator, helped start a youth football team and coached a middle school girls basketball team. But now, the former Wake Forest basketball player must rely on others to check his ventilator, give him water and get him in and out of bed. Sunday&apos;s appearance at the S.J.G. Greater NC ProAm league&apos;s championship game marks only the second time he&apos;s been out at a community event since his accident, he said. ... Earlier this year, Rogers founded The Rodney Rogers Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Apex aimed at raising awareness of the difficulties of living with paralysis and providing medical services and relief for people who are paralyzed or in wheelchairs. &apos;This is just a way for me to stay busy and to give back to the community,&apos; he said. &apos;I&apos;m trying to help others, people that are less fortunate and who can&apos;t afford medical supplies. I just want to help them out.&apos; &quot;

 With Washington still thumbing through George Packer&apos;s article on the lunacy of the Senate (which Chris Dodd calls a &quot;ridiculous story&quot;), our federal government mustered a win today: A district court judge ruled that California&apos;s Proposition 8 violates some of our nation&apos;s most cherished principles. The Senate okayed a bill that provides state funding for teachers and Medicaid. Rather than let the bill languish over recess, Nancy Pelosi tweet ordered (tworded?) the House to reconvene next week to pass the measure -- to the collective groan of staffers with vacation plans and fundraisers with fundraising plans. We&apos;ll be back tomorrow, when the Senate is expected to confirm Elena Kagan and Gabrielle Giffords will try to squash accusations that her campaign is &quot;pathetic and stupid.&quot; This is HUFFPOST HILL for Wednesday, August 4th, 2010 :

 JUDGE RULES THAT PROP 8 IS SO GAY In a landmark ruling today, U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that the California proposition that outlawed same-sex marriage &quot; violates their due process and equal protection rights .&quot; Hooray! Looks like civil rights were able to eke out a win in a news cycle dominated by 14th Amendment repeal. http://huff.to/d318E7

Conclusion: &quot; Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license . Indeed, the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples. Because California has no interest in discriminating against gay men and lesbians, and because Proposition 8 prevents California from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide marriages on an equal basis, the court concludes that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional .&quot;

Full ruling: http://huff.to/c6CfTa

 Judge Walker has stayed entry of the judgment for six days -- we won&apos;t be seeing gay couples getting married at City Halls around California for at least a week or so. 

 White House: &quot;The President has spoken out in opposition to Proposition 8 because it is divisive and discriminatory. He will continue to promote equality for LGBT Americans.&quot; http://bit.ly/amEQZD

 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger: &quot;Today&apos;s decision is by no means California&apos;s first milestone, nor our last, on America&apos;s road to equality and freedom for all people.&quot;

 Jon Davidson of Lambda Legal: &quot;It is not only a home run, it is a grand slam.&quot; http://huff.to/d318E7

 LDS Church: &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regrets today&apos;s decision. California voters have twice been given the opportunity to vote on the definition of marriage in their state and both times have determined that marriage should be recognized as only between a man and a woman. We agree. Marriage between a man and woman is the bedrock of society.&quot;

 Matthew Shepard&apos;s mom Judy on HuffPost: &quot;The plaintiffs in this case are law-abiding, family-oriented, tax-paying citizens whose privacy was invaded, and whose dignity was affronted, by a misguided and unconstitutional law. Their victory at trial shows that our courts still play a vital role in safeguarding the rights of minorities from majorities who misunderstand them.&quot; http://huff.to/9krN7M

 APPROPRIATORS GETTING BOUNCED - The CW has long been that the well-paved road to easy reelection ran through the Appropriations Committee. But voters don&apos;t seem to be such bacon lovers anymore. Bob Bennett (R-Utah) lost his Senate bid, Rep. Todd Tiahrt, an appropriator, lost to Rep. Jerry Moran, who isn&apos;t one, in the primary for Kansas governor. Arlen Specter, of course, is a big time appropriator, as are Dem House losers Alan Mollohan (W.Va.) and Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (Mich.). They all had their own issues going on, but winning bread didn&apos;t translate into winning votes. (Thanks to trend-spotter Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense for spotting the trend.)

 A HuffPost Hill Volcker Rule Told Ya So - Remember when Fox was freaking out, saying that Goldman Sachs had figured a way around the Volcker rule&apos;s ban on prop trading? To paraphrase us at the time: &quot;B*tch, be cool.&quot; Today, CNBC reports that Goldman is giving serious consideration to spinning off its prop-trading desk because of the new restrictions.

 HOUSE TO BREAK FROM RECESS TO VOTE ON STATE AID - Speaker Pelosi today tweeted ( Ohhhhh my Goooooooddddd ) that the House would reconvene next week ( Nooooooooooooo ) to vote on the Senate&apos;s bill ( I already booked my flight to Flagstaff ) which allocates funds for municipal programs including teacher pay and Medicaid funding assistance ( I had Guster tickets ). Understanding the urgency of the situation, Washington insiders reacted with characteristic perspective and maturity ( Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh ). http://huff.to/daQRKW

 Earlier in the day, the Senate passed the bill . The vote was 61 - 38 with Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe the only two Republicans to break ranks with their party.
No word yet on exactly when the House will be voting -- or how. The House was so sure that it was done for the month that construction around the chamber&apos;s 30-year-old main voting display is already in the works. &quot;They&apos;re not going to like that, but they&apos;re going to have to come back. Who&apos;s going to have to make that call to Nancy Pelosi? I&apos;d like to hear that one,&quot; said Chris Dodd. A few hours later, she&apos;d tweeted the House back in session.

 Scott Brown, on why he voted against aid to the state s and how it raises taxes but doesn&apos;t really so QUIT MISUNDERSTANDING HIM : &quot;We can&apos;t afford it. I filed a bill, as you know, that would have fully paid for it, and wouldn&apos;t have raised taxes . Businesses are hurting and those are the folks that are creating jobs.&quot;

Reporter Leigh Ann Caldwell: &quot;Can you explain how it raises taxes?&quot;

Brown: &quot; I didn&apos;t say it raised taxes . It actually changes the tax code for businesses and puts more of a burden on them. Obviously, the way that they&apos;re going to try to tax foreign profits on corporations who do business overseas is problematic, especially in Massachusetts where we have a lot of businesses just like that.&quot;

 Google Inks Evil Deal With Verizon - Google sold out backers of net neutrality today, a betrayal that has long been predicted, given the power the search engine wields relative to blogs or non-Google-sized companies. Rather than pressing the FCC to craft regulations that would keep the Internet open, it cut a side deal with Verizon that would restrict the telecom &quot;from selectively slowing Internet content that travels over its wires, and wouldn&apos;t apply such strictures to Internet use on mobile phones,&quot; Bloomberg reports.

 HARRY REID WILL HOLD SEPTEMBER VOTE ON BUSH TAX CUTS - A clear signal that Reid believes there is political traction in letting 43&apos;s tax breaks for the wealthy expire, the majority leader&apos;s office today signaled the Senate will debate the matter shortly after the August recess. &quot; Senior Democrats had expected the controversial issue to be postponed until after the election, when a fiscal responsibility commission appointed by President Obama is due to release its recommendations ...&apos;I expect it to be on the floor in September,&apos; said Reid spokesman Jim Manley.&quot; The Hill: http://bit.ly/9LAov6

 Tim Geithner went populist with his opposition to extending the tax cuts for the wealthy during his speech at the Center for American Progress today. &quot;The most affluent 400 earners in 2007 -- who earned an average of more than $340 million dollars each that year -- paid only 17 percent of their income in tax, a lower rate than many middle class families,&quot; he said. &quot;The legacy of the crisis is millions of unemployed Americans, idled factories, a national debt swollen by eight years of deficit spending and growing income inequality.&quot; He continued: &quot;We live in one of the richest economies in the world -- but one in eight Americans is on food stamps today.&quot; 

A reminder: Yesterday Senate Republicans were treated to this video at their caucus meeting, meant to hype them up for a tax battle : http://bit.ly/butaUc

A double reminder, all the way: &quot;The Economic Freedom Act of 2010 -- introduced by Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) -- proposes deep tax cuts favoring the wealthiest in America , a reduction in regulatory oversight and the elimination of a federal tax on the e state s of millionaires, which will allow wealthy investors to escape taxes entirely on a significant portion of their income.&quot; Laura Bassett: http://huff.to/ajO4ke

 Also on tap for the fall, a measure that would eliminate &quot;secret holds&quot; in the Senate . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has backed the effort to reform the filibuster, said Wednesday that he&apos;d schedule a vote in the fall. Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Chuck Grassley, (R-Iowa), and Claire McCaskill (D- Mo.) have gathered more than 60 backers for their elimination of the secret hold. http://huff.to/aSt9gN

 CHRIS DODD TELLS FRESHMAN SENATORS TO CUT IT WITH THE PRAGMATIC IDEALISM - Chris Dodd gathered with the Democratic Senate freshman class on Tuesday night at a dinner organized by Mark Warner to persuade them to back off their push to change Senate rules when the chamber returns in January, the first opportunity there will be to do so . &quot;I made a case last night to about ten freshman senators, you know, you want to turn this into a unicameral body? What&apos;s the point of having a Senate? If the vote margins are the same as in the House, you might as well close the doors,&quot; Dodd told reporters in the Capitol. http://huff.to/aSt9gN

 Dodd on George Packer&apos;s New Yorker article about dysfunction in the Senate : &quot;These articles about &apos;the empty chamber&apos; -- what a ridiculous story . With the exception of &apos;64, &apos;65-&apos;68, it&apos;s probably been the most successful session of this Senate in 50 years. We take two issues that have been defying resolution for 60 years and get it done, dealing with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, how is that empty? Now, you know, Democrats have a conflicting message. On the one hand we&apos;re b*tching about the fact that the Republicans won&apos;t let us bring up certain matters so we can&apos;t get certain things done , so we&apos;re arguing against ourselves in a way. I mean, the fact is, yes, that&apos;s true, but in spite of that we&apos;ve gotten a great deal done.&quot;

 TOMORROW&apos;S PAPERS TODAY - The Hill : The Hill&apos;s editors and reporters sit down with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), who talks about the future of climate change legislation and the November elections. Roll Call : House Democrats should be careful what they wish for, writes Roll Call&apos;s Steven T. Dennis and Emily Pierce. After grousing for months that the Senate had failed to act on jobs legislation, House Democrats now have to cut short their summer break after the Senate finally managed to advance the legislation. Financial Times : US banks with Wall Street operations are bracing for a slump in trading profits this year after the third quarter got off to a poor start, with global economic uncertainty and Europe&apos;s sovereign debt woes leading to a slowdown in market activity in July.

SCOOP I, via Hotline&apos;s Reid Wilson - &quot; The RNC&apos;s Budget Committee as approved acquiring a $10M line of credit in order to cover the party&apos;s financial shortfall, a move committee members called essential to winning Dem-held seats this fall.&quot; http://bit.ly/dwu4QD

SCOOP I, via FT&apos;s Edward Luce - &quot; George W. Bush insisted that publication of his forthcoming memoirs, &apos;Decision Points,&apos; ...be put back until after the midterm elections , according to people close to the former president. ... According to friends of Mr Bush, he resisted plans by the publisher to launch the book in September, which is traditionally a better time to maximise sales.&quot; http://bit.ly/aTsdBO

SCOOP III, via NPR&apos;s David Gura - &quot;According to three sources, Virginia A. Seitz, a partner at Sidley Austin, has emerged as a leading candidate to head the Office of Legal Counsel, a critical job at the Department of Justice . ... The Office of Legal Counsel&apos;s chief job has been unfilled for years. During the Bush administration, it attracted international attention for approving harsh detainee interrogation tactics. President Obama had nominated Dawn Johnsen, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, for the job, but she withdrew her candidacy this year after the Senate failed to act.&quot;

 KAGAN RECIEVES ENOUGH BACKING FOR CONFIRMATION ON DAY TWO OF SENATE DEBATE, AMERICANS SOON WILL CHOKE ON SOOT AND ASH OF CRUMBLING REPUBLIC - It looks as if our fears of living in a Zabar&apos;s-infested, socialist co-op hellscape where we&apos;re forced to sing &quot;Ten Thousand Men of Harvard&quot; continuously will be realized. Howard Mortman emails: &quot; C-SPAN has confirmed that at least 61 Senators intend to vote for cloture , moving forward the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the United State s Supreme Court. Of these, only Sen. Ben Nelson (D-NE) says he then intends to oppose Ms. Kagan in the final confirmation vote, which only requires 50 Senators to approve the nomination. C-SPAN&apos;s confirmed tally for the final confirmation vote commitments now stands at 60-33. See member-by-member commitments at http://c-span.org/kagan.

 ERIC CANTOR HELPS SENATE DEMOCRATS REDUCE THE DEFICIT - From Arthur Delaney: &quot;Looking to offset the $26 billion cost of FMAP funding, Senate Democrats decided to end the Advance Earned Income Tax Credit, a cut that will save $1 billion. It happens to be the very same cut recommended last week by House Republican Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.), who this year launched YouCut, an initiative that gives Internet voters a chance to nominate the U.S. government&apos;s most wasteful spending program. But Cantor will probably not savor returning to Washington next week to vote on the Senate&apos;s measure . Says spokesman Brad Dayspring: &apos;While we welcome the Democrats&apos; embrace of the YouCut initiative, the purpose of the program is to start cutting spending, not to use the cuts that Americans want as an opportunity to increase government spending somewhere else.&apos; FUN FACT: The CBO estimates that the measure approved by the Senate today reduces the deficit by $1.371 billion.&quot;

 ONE-QUARTER OF OIL STILL IN GULF, STUDY FINDS - &quot;Federal scientists say about one-quarter of the BP oil that spilled out of its broken well remains. A new government report says nearly three-quarters of the oil - more than 152 million gallons - has either been collected at the well by BP&apos;s cap, burned, skimmed, chemically dispersed, naturally deteriorated, evaporated or dissolved .&quot; http://bit.ly/bnohRr

&quot;The vast quantities of oil and dispersants that have flooded the Gulf of Mexico are now disappearing into the water column, leading scientists to worry about the long-term toxic effects. One species of particular concern is the Gulf sturgeon , a remarkable &quot;living dinosaur&quot; of a fish that can reach 1000 pounds, and can cause serious injury with its armor-plated skin as it leaps through the air.&quot; Wonk Room: http://bit.ly/dyCUhj

 CITING A HIGHER POWER, SHARRON ANGLE ATTACKS HIGHER POWERS - A clip has emerged, dug up by Jon Ralston, of an interview with a Christian radio station in which Angle accuses President Obama and Harry Reid of blasphemy. No word on whether the president has coveted his neighbor&apos;s ox or donkey yet. &quot;And these programs that you mentioned -- that Obama has going with Reid and Pelosi pushing them forward -- are all entitlement programs built to make government our God. And that&apos;s really what&apos;s happening in this country is a violation of the First Commandment . We have become a country entrenched in idolatry, and that idolatry is the dependency upon our government. We&apos;re supposed to depend upon God for our protection and our provision and for our daily bread, not for our government.&quot; Via Greg Sargent: http://bit.ly/aG7A6W

 The Connecticut Senate race between Richard Blumenthal and Linda McMahon is heating up, if ever so slightly . A new poll from Quinnipiac finds the Nutmeg State A.G. and proud public servant during Vietnam leading former WWE executive and person who kicks dudes during in the groin Linda McMahon 50% to 40%. That is a step up for McMahon who hasn&apos;t been this close to single digits in some time. Chris Dodd chalks up the tightening to the $20-plus million McMahon has already spent -- more, he says, than he spent in all five of his races. http://bit.ly/byx3Ur

 BIKE RIDING SO MUCH MORE THAN YOUR ANNOYING FRIEND&apos;S SANCTIMONIOUS BRAGGING POINT, CANDIDATE SAYS - Denver Post on the conspiracy: &quot;Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Maes is warning voters that Denver Mayor [and candidate himself] John Hickenlooper&apos;s policies, particularly his efforts to boost bike riding, are &apos; converting Denver into a United Nations community .&apos; &apos;This is all very well-disguised, but it will be exposed,&apos; Maes told about 50 supporters who showed up at a campaign rally last week in Centennial. Maes said in a later interview that he once thought the mayor&apos;s efforts to promote cycling and other environmental initiatives were harmless and well-meaning. Now he realizes &apos;that&apos;s exactly the attitude they want you to have.&apos;&quot;

 RNC VOTES TO INVESTIGATE SOURCE OF EMBARRASSING, POLITICALLY DAMAGING LEAKS - Two suggestions -- One: http://bit.ly/anjAum and Two: http://bit.ly/M1VYB . TPM: &quot;An anonymous source in the Republican National Committee told CNN today that the committee, at its summer meeting in Kansas City, has voted to investigate the source of recent leaks to the media. The RNC has had a series of embarrassing leaks lately, some silly and some more serious : A memo from the treasurer accusing top officials of hiding the committee&apos;s debt; the departure of top fund-raisers; and weird emails, written by interns, asking foreign ambassadors to meet with Steele.&quot; http://bit.ly/a3hqlO

 Interestingly, Norm Coleman, who is rumored to be pining for Michael Steele&apos;s chairmanship, is skipping the RNC&apos;s summer meeting in Kansas City . &quot;The decision is being taken as a sign that the former U.S. senator wants to squelch rumors about a possible challenge to RNC chairman Michael Steele. Coleman, currently running the American Action Network, a group raising money for Republican candidates around the nation, has avoided questions about any ambition he may have to take over the RNC from the gaffe-prone Steele.&quot; Star Tribune: http://bit.ly/ds3ufX

In the Senate, Jeff Sessions and secret Panamanian John McCain voiced their support for a review of the 14th Amendment as some Hispanic schoolchildren in the state McCain immigrated to are apparently afraid to attend class. Mike Bloomberg sought to temper fears about the forthcoming mosque and Islamic center near Ground Zero with an impassioned speech on religious pluralism. Out in La La Land Rush Limbaugh again raised the &quot;question&quot; of President Obama&apos;s place of origin. Speaking of ferners and the power they wield, Republicans spent the day trashing New Yorker Elena Kagan. This is HUFFPOST HILL for Tuesday, August 3rd, 2010 :

 REID POSTPONES DEBATE ON ENERGY BILL UNTIL AFTER RECESS - Despite stripping the bill of its signature provisions including a cap-and-trade system, the Senate still can&apos;t muster a vote before the month-long break. Lucia Graves: &quot;Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that the Senate will postpone the vote on energy and oil spill legislation until lawmakers return from the August recess. &apos; We tried jujitsu, we tried yoga, we tried everything we could to get Republicans to come along ,&apos; said Reid. Republican gripes include lifting the $75-million liability cap on oil companies, a provision that is also opposed by oil industry allies Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Alaska).&quot; http://huff.to/czWbnF

 BANK WATERS HELPED WAS A STRAIGHT-UP ZOMBIE - OneUnited, the bank that Maxine Waters is accused of assisting to the benefit of her stock-holding husband, was dead as all dead when it got a Treasury bailout, an analysis done Professor Linus Wilson shows. To be eligible for a bailout, banks needed at least a 5% tier one capital ratio. Wilson finds that OneUnited was sitting at -1% when Treasury swooped in with $12.1 million. It has missed five straight dividend payments; if it misses one more, Treasury can appoint two new directors to the board that Waters&apos; husband once served on. &quot;Perhaps the Boston lender is too politically connected to fail,&quot; says Wilson . A question for Treasury:

 Tim Geithner will be the featured guest at a CAP webcast on the economy tomorrow from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm . The event will be moderated by John Podesta and Douglas Holtz-Eakin.

 SESSIONS JOINS CALL FOR REVIEW OF 14TH AMENDMENT - The top ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee today told reporters that &quot;we definitely should look at&quot; repealing the birthright citizenship contained in the 14th Amendment. What we have is a situation in which people fly here to have their children and then they automatically have dual citizenship...People do not believe that you should be able to break into America and then the baby becomes a citizen and then the whole family says, well, we can&apos;t go home, our child is a citizen...The Constitution is not as clear as it first appears...I continue to hear good Americans explain to me they think it makes no sense... I think hearings is a good way to do it. Let&apos;s have somebody draft an Amendment and see what it says. I think that it would be a good thing to have hearings on.&quot;

 John McCain agrees. Even though any real movement on modifying the Constitution is as dead as the Arizona senator is on the inside, the lawmaker formerly known as Maverick (and Panamanian-born) towed the line today. TPM: &quot;TPMDC asked, &apos;Do you support the Minority Leader&apos;s push for hearings into the repeal of birthright citizenship?&apos; &apos;Sure, why not?&apos; McCain said briefly. &apos;Do you support the idea itself?&apos; &apos;I support the idea of having hearings,&apos; McCain said. &apos;Do you have a problem with the 14th Amendment?&apos; another reporter asked. &apos;You&apos;re changing the constitution of the United State s,&apos; McCain said. &apos;I support the concept of holding hearings.&apos;&quot; Straight Talk! http://bit.ly/aCX0A3

 The 14th Amendment is what has allowed corporations to be treated as if they&apos;re citizens. Does the GOP really wanna start monkeying around with this one? 

 By the way, even Lou Dobbs doesn&apos;t want to end birthright citizenship: &quot;The idea that anchor babies somehow require changing the 14th amendment, I part ways with the Senators on that because I believe the 14th amendment, particularly in its due process and equal protection clauses, is so important. It lays the foundation for the entire Bill of Rights being applied to the state s.&quot; http://bit.ly/a6wDJ8

 BP BEGINS STATIC KILL PROCEDURE, GULF MIGHT NOT RESEMBLE DARTH VADER&apos;S KOI POND MUCH LONGER - &quot;The oil spill &apos;static kill&apos; attempt is officially underway, as BP seeks to plug the oil spill with mud and cement to stop flow once and for all.
PBS NewsHour tweeted that the static kill attempt began officially today around 4 p.m. EST. BP says the process will take between 33-61 hours if all goes as planned. BP has said the static kill is a chance to stop the oil spill leak without relief wells, which it previously insisted were necessary. Either way, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said relief wells would be installed at some point to ensure &apos;the well is dead.&apos; AOL News reports that this is potentially &apos;one of the final steps to permanently stopping the flow of oil.&quot; http://huff.to/bqR3Uy

What Nick Papas is reading: &quot;Wave of health reform provisions coming next month&quot; by AP&apos;s Tom Murphy: &quot;Health care reform hits another milestone next month, with new provisions that include a coverage expansion for young adults and restrictions on an insurer&apos;s ability to impose annual coverage limits or to reject children with pre-existing medical conditions .&quot;

 SENATE BEGINS DEBATE OF KAGAN NOMINATION - The Senate today started its posturing debate over wise Caucasian woman and confirmed New Yorker ( gasp ) Elena Kagan (B.A., Princeton, J.D., Gray&apos;s Papaya). The chamber is expected to vote on the former solicitor general&apos;s elevation to the high court on Thursday before it breaks for August recess.

 Judiciary&apos;s top Republican Jeff Sessions on the floor today : &quot;I believe she does not have the gifts and the qualities of mind or temperament that one must have to be a justice.&quot; Ouch.

 The Chamber of Commerce&apos;s CEO Tom Donahue thinks Elena Kagan meets the standard criteria for Supreme Court nominees...but his organization isn&apos;t weighing in on her nomination , despite endorsing every SCOTUS nominee since 1990. In May he told a gathering, &quot;At every Supreme Court nominee, we have a system through our Institute for Legal Reform where we review their qualifications. We do that, and in almost every instance, we support them. If it&apos;s the president&apos;s choice, if they&apos;re approved by the ABA and they&apos;re competent people, you know, we&apos;re pretty much inclined to support them. We do the process, however, and keep doing it for the occasion once in however many times that everybody might want to rally around that. And I will tell you the chamber hasn&apos;t finished its process, but I have no objection to her .&quot; http://bit.ly/bYCGnK

 DEMOCRATS OPT NOT TO OVERHAUL SUPERDELEGATE SYSTEM - Newsweek summarizes the Democrats&apos; dysfunctional overhaul of their dysfunctional primary system that chooses who will govern in the traditionally dysfunctional Democratic manner. &quot;[R]ecently a party committee quietly tossed out a plan to take nominating power away from the superdelegates--former presidents, current senators and Congress members, members of the Democratic National Committee, and other party luminaries such as labor leaders. The superdelegates currently have automatic seats at the convention and are free to vote for whichever presidential candidate they please...But the rules committee took a dim view of this proposal. While endorsing recommendations to dilute the superdelegates&apos; influence (mostly by increasing the number of ordinary delegates), it quietly nixed the redefinition of their voting powers at it July 10 meeting . How quietly? Enough that even some members of the change commission hadn&apos;t yet heard about it when NEWSWEEK spoke to them last week.&quot; http://bit.ly/bYCGnK

 DAILY DELANEY DOWNER - Arthur Delaney rounds up all the little cuts to the safety net over the past few months: &quot;On Wednesday, Senate Democrats hope to pass a bill that, to offset the cost of $16 billion in Medicaid assistance for state s and $10 billion to prevent teacher layoffs, will cut $6.7 billion in future food stamp funding. The cut is the latest in a series of drop-in-the-bucket efforts to avoid adding to a federal budget deficit expected to top $1.4 trillion this year. The first cuts came in May, when Democratic leaders hoping to move a broad domestic aid package in the House of Representatives bowed to deficit demands and dropped $24 billion in state Medicaid assistance and $7.7 billion in subsidies for laid-off workers to maintain their health insurance via the COBRA program.&quot; And so forth. http://huff.to/cJfM6r

 TOMORROW&apos;S PAPERS TODAY - The Hill : Molly K. Hooper on how Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) believes that Rep. Charles Rangel should lose his congressional pension if the New York Democrat is found guilty or admits to breaking ethics rules. Roll Call : John Stanton writes that Sen.

 DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT FORTHCOMING JOE BIDEN BOOK - Marc Ambinder previews an segment in the upcoming Biden bio, &quot;Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption.&quot; &quot;When President Obama began to deliberate on the path his administration would pursue in Afghanistan, Vice President Joe Biden&apos;s staff prepared a classified PowerPoint presentation for the National Security Council...When Obama announced his strategy at West Point, the Washington establishment -- always looking for winners and losers -- deemed Biden a loser. Obama surged 40,000 troops to Afghanistan. [Counterinsurgency] won. But so did &apos;SOF.&apos; [Biden&apos;s plan, Special Operations Forces]. The president endorsed both approaches. Internally, Biden was satisfied...Biden says that, going into the debate, &apos;I had an unfair advantage because I talked about this with the president more often and more regularly than anyone else.&apos; Biden knew &apos;not just by body language [but] by direction assertion that [Obama] agreed with me on [the] fundamentals of the policy.&apos;&quot; http://bit.ly/aKA02W

 The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission will have its final report published by Little, Brown and Company . The panel will present its findings to the president and Congress on December 5th.

 MIKE BLOOMBERG TALKS SENSE ABOUT APPROVED GROUND ZERO MOSQUE - For weeks now a growing chorus of commentators and politicians have expressed outrage over the proximity of the 9-11 attacks a proposed mosque and Islamic center to the World Trade Center site. After a New York City panel approved the projct, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg delivered some level-headed remarks on the decision. &quot;The attack was an act of war, and our first responders defended not only our city, but our country and our Constitution. We do not honor their lives by denying the very constitutional rights they died protecting . We honor their lives by defending those rights and the freedoms that the terrorists attacked ... Political controversies come and go, but our values and our traditions endure, and there is no neighborhood in this city that is off-limits to God&apos;s love and mercy ,&quot; he said on Governor&apos;s Island.

 While we&apos;re all on a 14th Amendment kick, the AP is reporting that some schools in Arizona are reporting lower enrollment levels, possibly related to the state &apos;s immigration law . Maybe it&apos;s just us, but if a law creates an environment that could make Dora the Explorer hesitant about learning, it might be time to reconsider. &quot;The expected number of students at two districts this year is down by more than 600, based on projections made at the end of last school year, according to The Arizona Republic. Phoenix Balsz Elementary School District took the biggest hit, with 560 fewer students than expected. The southeast Phoenix district had 2,809 students enrolled on the first day of school, but only 2,250 showed up.&quot; http://bit.ly/b9hYHz

 CHARLIE CRIST&apos;S LIEUTENANT TO ENDORSE RUBIO - In a move that may well burn the Florida governor worse than the tanning bed he sleeps in, his own lieutenant governor Jeff Kottcamp has thrown his support behind Marco Rubio . Fox News: &quot;Currently a Republican candidate for Florida attorney general, Kottcamp will make his announcement in an e-mail release on Wednesday, according to senior aide David Bishop. Kottcamp has not spoken to Crist since he left the Republican Party in April to run as an independent in the Senate race after polls showed Rubio with a wide lead in the GOP primary. Crist and Kottcamp won the ticket in November 2006 and took the oath of office in January 2007 as the 44th governor and 17th lieutenant governor, respectively.&quot; http://bit.ly/dtedo2

 In North Carolina, a new PPP survey finds Richard Burr is only leading Elaine Marshall by two points . Burr is up over Marshall 39% to 37%. PPP: &quot;The main thing that&apos;s changed since the last poll, when Burr led by 5, is that Marshall is shoring up her support from within the party. 65% of Democrats say they&apos;ll vote for her, up from 57% a month ago. Burr continues to lead because of a 44-25 advantage with independents and because with 73% Republican support his party is more unified around him than Marshall&apos;s is around her.&quot; http://bit.ly/9EsBwa

The Washington Senate race between Patty Murray and Dino Rossi is getting ugly.

 CONSTITUTIONALIST SHARRON ANGLE DOESN&apos;T REALLY GET FIRST Amendment - If sunshine is the best disinfectant, then Sharron Angle is slathering on the SPF 70. Last night on Fox news, the Nevada Senate candidate told Carl Cameron that she hoped &quot;to have the press be our friend,&quot; and voiced her disappointment that the media refuses to &quot;ask the questions we want to answer so that they report the news the way we want it to be reported.&quot; Sam Stein: http://huff.to/aRv68D

Clearly worried about Michael Bennet&apos;s prospects in the Colorado Senate primary against Andrew Romanoff, President Obama will appear in a tele-town hall this evening alongside Bennet . The event is scheduled to start at 8:00 pm Eastern.

 Romanoff Flips On Taking DSCC Money - Andrew Romanoff has surged in Colorado since highlighting that he has sworn off all PAC, and went to so far as to say he wouldn&apos;t take DSCC money, much of which comes from corporate PACS. &quot;I don&apos;t welcome the outside interference,&quot; he said, telling the Colorado State sman that DSCC money was no good here. The new position: Sure, why not? Send it over. Politico: http://politi.co/aRPXz4

 Harry Reid is up in Nevada . A Reuters/Ipsos poll has the majority leader ahead of Sharron Angle 48% to 44%. &quot;Reid led Tea Party favorite Angle 52 percent to 36 percent among registered voters, but when the likelihood of actually voting was considered, his lead slipped to just 4 percentage points, 48 percent to 44 percent, the poll showed. The poll of 600 Nevada voters July 30-August 1 also found that 74 percent believe the economy is the state &apos;s biggest problem, and 63 percent favor an immigration law like Arizona&apos;s that would enable police to check the status of people they stop.&quot; http://bit.ly/aNDWpi

 It turns out that acquiring the president&apos;s endorsement is kind of like blogging for the Huffington Post... you just have to ask . The Hill reports that several House members have cracked the code to President Obama&apos;s political good graces. &quot;[Rep. Hank] Johnson, who landed the president&apos;s backing in his primary against former DeKalb County chief Vernon Jones and DeKalb County Commissioner Connie Stokes, said he asked the White House for an endorsement and received it a couple days later...An official with Rep. Carolyn Maloney&apos;s (D-N.Y.) campaign described getting Obama&apos;s primary endorsement as a &apos;very simple process.&apos; Maloney had asked the president personally about getting his support and later her campaign manager, Matt Tepper, called the White House&apos;s political shop and asked it to sign off on a press release.&quot; http://bit.ly/a64Gf3

This gripping video (via Gawker ) depicts a group of young Russian men attempting to drive through one of the wildfires currently raging across their country. Fortunately, they survived -- though, it seems, just barely, thanks to a timely decision on the driver&apos;s part.

If you found yourself in that situation, how would you react? If unexpectedly found yourself in a life-or-death crisis and had to make a decision that would either save your life or end it, how can you ensure that you would make the right one?

That was not a rhetorical question for people in the state of Victoria, Australia, during February and March, 2009. For five weeks catastrophic brush fires swept across the state amid record-breaking temperatures and drought. Government policy held that when fire threatened a neighborhood, homeowners were to make a choice: either stay and fight to save their houses, or evacuate early. They were explicitly instructed not to wait until the flames were close. Trying to run from a wildfire is the surest way to die in it.

The choice given to the people made sense in strictly rational terms. But can people be expected to make rational decisions when they&apos;re surrounded by 1200 degree flames raging four stories high? Shortly after the Victoria fire&apos;s most lethal day, I talked to a survivor and heard his incredible story, which I included in Extreme Fear. Here&apos;s an excerpt:

EVERYONE IN Melbourne knew that Saturday, February 7 was going to be brutal. The southern summer had been a scorcher, with temperatures the previous week climbing above 110 degrees three days and a row. That day the mercury was forecast to climb even higher. Winds were strong and a long drought had left the vegetation, setting the stage for the most dangerous fire conditions ever recorded.

In Glenburn, a farming community outside the city, Victoria University professor Ian Thomas spent that Saturday listening for weather updates on the radio. As an engineer, Thomas specialized in calculating the risk of fire in buildings, so he had a healthy appreciation for the dangers of wildfire. His house and lawn were surrounded by trees on all side and abutted the eucalyptus forest of Kinglake National Park , which stretched uphill from his front yard. Each summer, fire became a real and present danger.

On this day, in particular, he was careful to check that the sprinkler system on his roof was in good working order, and that the casks of water that he had positioned around the property were full. &quot;We didn&apos;t need the forecast to tell us that it was dangerous,&quot; he says, &quot;because when you walked around on the grass, the grass was crisp under your feet, and when you walked in the bush the leaves crackled. It was obvious that everything was extremely dry.&quot;

As it turned out, the weather report was off: the maximum temperature that afternoon in Melbourne wasn&apos;t the predicted 111 degrees, but 115, the highest temperature in more than 150 years of record-keeping. The government put out a &quot;Total Fire Ban&quot; alert, which forbid not only the lighting of fires, but the use of any mechanical equipment, such as angle grinders, that could cause s park s. But all the precautions in the world would offer scant protection given that a single s park ignited anywhere in hundreds of square miles of bone-dry bush would be enough to set off a catastrophe. In the event, it didn&apos;t take long. Around 11 o&apos;clock that morning, high winds knocked down a power line that ran through pasture 25 miles to the northwest of Glenburn. Within hours, a roaring wall of flames was burning eastward.

Thomas wasn&apos;t concerned the reports of the fire that he heard over the radio. Given past experience, the outbreak was too far away to pose a danger. A few years before, a fire had started in the national park forest behind the Thomas&apos; house, and burned for a week without getting closer than half a mile.

Around 4pm, the scorching heatwave suddenly broke, as the fierce, dry northern wind swung around 180 degrees and became a cooler sea breeze. Within minutes the mercury dropped 30 degrees, to a relatively balmy 86. &quot;We started to relax,&quot; Thomas says, &quot;because we thought that things were looking pretty good. Nothing big had happened, and that it was likely that there wasn&apos;t going to be a major problem.&quot; Soon after, the power went out. Fifteen minutes later it came back on, then died again.

What the radio news broadcasts had failed to report was that the wildfire had spread all the way to the town of Kingslake, less than ten miles from the Thomas&apos; house. The new, cool breeze had fanned the flames to new intensity, and was driving the fire towards Glenburn at freight-train speeds.

The first inkling of trouble came when a couple who lived nearby, Lou and Cheryl Newstead, pulled into the driveway. They brought news that their son had just called to tell them that the fire was heading their way. As the couples talked the wind that was blowing in from the south darkened with smoke. Ash and glowing embers started dropping out of the air.

&quot;We went from not having any particular worries to having fire in our immediate vicinity very quickly,&quot; Thomas recalls. The decision point -- stay or go -- had arrived faster than anyone had anticipated. The neighbors decided to evacuate; the Thomases, to stay and defend. &quot;My thinking was that they were foolish in driving off in that situation,&quot; says Thomas. &quot;They didn&apos;t know what they were driving into.&quot;

But his own situation was scarcely better. With the power out, the fire on their door, the Thomases were cut off and entirely on their own. What they would not find out until much later was that the fire that was racing towards them had already become the deadliest single blaze in Australian history.

The wind shift two hours before had turned the Kilmore blaze&apos;s wall of flame and sent it racing to the northeast, up through a steeply sloping eucalyptus forest toward the community of Kinglake. Strong wind, steep terrain, and tinder-dry, oily eucalyptus combined to form the deadliest kind of wildfire, an incendiary chain reaction called a blowup. As heat bakes a tree past its flashpoint, its volatile gases blend with atmospheric oxygen and ignite almost instantaneously, causing the trees to explode in flame. The intensity of the energy released creates a powerful vortex of air that feeds it with fresh oxygen, sucking in cool air and spewing it upwards in a chimney that can pierce the stratosphere. The fire exploded up the ridge at speeds that topped 80 mph.

Hardest hit was a tidy neighborhood of homes along Pine Ridge Road, where a triangle of land was flanked on two sides by steep slopes. Topography that once provided fine views over the southern plain now exposed the community to being overrun by fire from two directions at once. The entire community was caught unawares. There was no time to contemplate the options.

Rob Richings, a service technician, decided to make a run for it once the windows of his house started to explode from the heat. &quot;It&apos;s against the rules, but this wasn&apos;t a normal bush fire,&quot; he later told a reporter. As it was, he managed to drive through the flames and reach safety. Many others did not. Disoriented in the smoke, cars crashed into one another on the jammed road. Flames melted tires and exploded fuel tanks. In one car, six people died together when their vehicle was consumed by flames.

Staying put was just as much a gamble. Another neighbor, Tina Wilson , decided to stay, taking her three children over to the nearby home of Paul and Karen Roland, who were holed up with their two daughters. &quot;The house has got sprinklers on the roof and we&apos;ll be fine,&quot; Wilson told her partner over the telephone. &quot;I&apos;ll call you soon.&quot; A few minutes later, Karen Roland phoned with her sister. &quot;It&apos;s too late,&quot; she yelled over the roar of the fire. &quot;We&apos;re trapped.&quot; All nine perished within the burning walls.

Within 30 minutes, the conflagration had passed over the town and moved on. By the time the fire was burning its way through to the Thomas&apos; treeline, 70 people were already dead.

Two minutes after the Thomas&apos; neighbors left their driveway in their attempt to flee Glenburn, the couple called to report that the pasture along the side of the road was on fire. Ian Thomas walked outside. The sky above the treeline was glowing orange. Here and there, falling embers were igniting spot fires. There was little time now. Already he could hear the roar of the approaching flames. Across the street, a line of trees erupted in fire. The fire leapt over the road, each tree igniting the next.

Thomas had counted on his sprinkler system to protect his house and yard from the fire, but the pump was electric, and the power lines were down. For just such a contingency, he had a gasoline-powered generator at the ready, he started it up. Within minutes, the generator&apos;s engine coughed and died. He tried in vain to restart it. His first line of defense was gone. If he and his wife were going to fight the fire, they&apos;d have to do it by hand, with buckets.

The smoke grew so thick that it was impossible to see more than a few feet. Thomas worried that he and his wife would lose contact amid the inky darkness and the deafening roar of the flames. &quot;It was like a steam train coming at you,&quot; he says. Soon the fire had surrounded the house, the flames creeping towards them over the grass like a rising tide. From a nearby house came the artillery-like whuump of a propane tank exploding.

&quot;I didn&apos;t know how things were going to pan out,&quot; Thomas says. &quot;It was obviously dangerous. It was very clear that if the house started to go up we would be in real trouble.&quot;

Thomas and his wife had committed themselves to their decision. Whether or not it was the right one, they had no way of knowing. All that was left for them to handle themselves as best they could.

With the pumps gone, they had to fight the fire by hand, plunging buckets of water into emergency cisterns by the house and then hauling them to wherever the danger was greatest.

A hundred feet of lawn ringed the house, forming a firebreak. As the flames crept forward over the grass, they shuttled out buckets of water to douse the flames before they could advance too close. Two big pines stood near the house in the front yard, and another in the back yard. If the fire reached any of them, the game would be over. It would be impossible to save the house, and if the house went up, there would be no refuge, no place to survive the heat.

The fire swept all the way around through the trees, until it was blazing around them on all four directions. The Thomases worked side by side, except for when a sudden advance somewhere else required one of them to run off to deal with the threat. A series of island-like gardens of native flora stood in the front lawn, and as the Thomases fought a rearguard action they ignited one by one into a pillar of flames. &quot;When one went up, it went up with a tremendous rush,&quot; says Thomas.

Undermined by the fire, trees began to fall. With a crack, a huge gum tree shuddered and crashed onto their driveway, blocking them in. The fire kept creeping forward, the smoking sea of charcoal inching ever inward behind a front of flame. The Thomases kept patrolling, checking their most vulnerable points, hurriedly lugging buckets of water to counter each new thrust.

Keeping continuously active helped to keep the fear at bay. &quot;We were anxious, but we were just focused on doing what we had to do,&quot; Thomas says. As time went on, their growing store of information about the fire also reduced the stressfulness of the crisis. &quot;The longer it went on, in a sense the more comfortable we got with it, because we started to feel that we&apos;d already been to some degree successful, and we stood a chance of continuing to be successful.&quot;

Finally, around 2.30am, the situation appeared to stabilize. The fire had crept to within 15 feet of the front of the house, and within a yard of the back deck, but the flames in the immediate vicinity were now out, and the carpet of burnt-out grass formed a protective barrier. All around them, the carbonized forest glowed with embers and the licking flames of remnant fires. Thomas, nauseous and unsteady from heat exhaustion, could hardly stay on his feet. Together, they collapsed and slept fitfully for three hours, keeping the blinds open so they could check for flare-ups.

The fight was not over. With the coming of the dawn, the wind began to build, whipping smoldering embers back into flame. Pockets of unburned vegetation erupted like roman candles. Thomas staggered outside to douse the most threatening flare-ups, but he was weak from the night&apos;s fight, and suffering from heat stroke. He could not take even a sip of water without throwing up. Gradually, the flare ups became less menacing, and the Thomases began to relax. Except for their house, their property had been incinerated. But they were alive.

The catastrophe of February 7, 2009, dwarfed any of Victoria&apos;s past wildfires. But it was just the beginning. A month later, the Kilmore fire would still be blazing, the fruit of a single s park in a remote hillside pasture that grew into a swath of destruction 50 miles long and 30 miles across. The fire season in Victoria would ultimately would claim 210 lives, destroy more than 2000 homes, and lay waste to a million acres of countryside.

In its way, the fires left the people of Victoria whether the &quot;stay or go&quot; policy was to blame for unnecessary deaths. Some argued that the policy should be scrapped in favor of mandatory evacuation.

Thomas disagrees. &apos;I think the policy is the right way to go,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&apos;s much more complicated than most people think it is. In risk analysis, one of the things you do is try to think of all the possible circumstances that could arise. Being afraid puts you under stress, and that makes it much more difficult to make completely rational decisions. But in the end most people have a very strong survival instinct. They find ways to deal with the situation.&quot;

 Baseball has long been considered a beer drinker&apos;s game. The River Cats and Infuze Marketing are challenging that preconception with a series of wine tastings at Raley Field.

      The events, which take place on game days, feature (semi) local wineries and catered appetizers, and part of the proceeds go to local charities.

      The second of the aptly named &quot;Wine in the Park &quot; events was held Wednesday afternoon in conjunction with the the River Cats game against the Sky Sox.

      An hour and a half before the first pitch, the gates opened for a gaggle of newly wristbanded oenophiles (I believe that &quot;gaggle&quot; is the correct term for a group of wine lovers, but &quot;murder&quot; is also acceptable). We headed en masse to the left-field arcade, where representatives from four local wineries were waiting, bottles in hand.

 All of the wineries represented that night are within a 90-minute drive from downtown Sacramento: 

       Mount Aukum is located, appropriately enough, atop Mount Aukum in southern El Dorado County, 75 minutes from downtown. They were represented by a charming father/daughter duo, the brother and niece, respectively, of head winemaker and French expat Michel Prod&apos;hon. They had five wines to taste, the most memorable being a big jammy, fruity zinfandel. Bonus points for leaving a half bottle of Syrah with me and a few fellow revellers when they were packing up.

       Chateau Routon is 15 minutes down the road from Mount Aukum and 80 minutes from downtown. Routon&apos;s winemakers are known for their port, which won first prize at the Amador County Fair. I am not much of a port guy myself, but I can say I enjoyed theirs more than most, which is to say not all that much. The wine I really enjoyed was their petite sirah, which was big but not overpowering, with just a bit of tartness. It screamed for medium-rare lamb chops.

       Nevada City -- I&apos;ll give you one guess where it is located: 70 minutes from downtown. They had two whites and two reds. The whites were blah; the reds were phenomenal. A caveat with regards to my feeling on the whites: one was a chardonnay, which is probably my least favorite varietal. The second was a sauvignon blanc, which is probably my favorite varietal when made in the Marlborough region of New Zealand. I can count on one hand the number of California sauv. blancs I&apos;ve tried that compare favorably to even the most run-of-the-mill New Zealand offering. The deck was stacked against them.

      Their reds, however were both lovely. Their cab Franc had just taken home the &quot;Best Cab Franc of California&quot; award at the California State Fair, and rightfully so. My favorite, though, was their syrah, which had just won &quot;Best Syrah&quot; at the New World International Wine Competition in Southern California.

       Pilot Peak is 20 minutes southwest of Nevada City, 80 minutes from downtown Sacramento. This may have been my overall favorite. They were represented by Lynn and Jacque Wilson , who own and operate the winery with another couple. I enjoyed all of their wines, but may have enjoyed their company even more. I &quot;tasted&quot; their &quot;Paramour,&quot; a lovely blend of grenache, syrah, petite sirah, and mourvedre, whatever that is, four or five times. It was outstanding. The wine that blew me away was their viognier. Oftentimes, I find viogniers to be cloyingly sweet. When I brought their version up to my nose, I was floored by its big, sweet and fruity aroma. I was sure it was going to be far too sweet for me, but I was dead wrong. It was fruity, certainly, but with a smooth, dry finish. Yumm. It turns out that the nose didn&apos;t know.

      The appetizers were provided by Ovations Catering. They went two for three, a .667 batting average that, were it baseball, would be a record. They had a great crudite platter, a wonderful selection of fresh-cut veggies and a really light, creamy dipping sauce. There was an outstanding mini grilled fish sandwich on crusty French baguettes. I had two of them and could have happily eaten two more. And by &quot;two&quot; I mean &quot;four to six.&quot; They were REALLY good. The third dish was an unfortunate hot dog wrapped in a flour tortilla on a toothpick with enchilada sauce. It tasted OK, but it was messy, and I didn&apos;t really get it. I would have enjoyed the hot dog far more if they&apos;d put it on the French bread with a little mustard, onion and relish. If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it.

      The event, was by all accounts, a big success. It sold out, and the left-field pavilion was packed with folks of all different ilks. If there&apos;s one thing that bridges generational gaps, it&apos;s wine. If there is another, it&apos;s baseball. Combine the two of them, and you can have an event with a 50-year age range where no one feels out of place.

      I spent some time hanging out talking Giants baseball with Kyle, who was there celebrating his 22nd birthday, a present from his girlfriend Alecia.

      I also struck up a conversation with Bill, intrigued by the &quot;nocular&quot; hanging around his neck. It had once been a pair of binoculars, but it had taken a spill at a 49er game 20 years ago and broken in half. Bill, who I&apos;d put in his late 60s, was a Niners season ticket holder from 1981-1995. He also has been on &quot;Good Day Sacramento,&quot; driving his motorized toilet, &quot;The Flusher,&quot; around the studio.

      As the game started and the tasting wound down, people took their seats in a section reserved for the Wine in the Park attendees. The section was packed at 7:30 and nearly abandoned by the seventh inning.

      A group of four hearty, and I&apos;m guessing buzzed, souls were pretty much all that was left to watch the River Cats fall 5-3 to the team from Colorado Springs. 

      Maybe baseball is more of a beer-drinking sport. But Raley Field is a fine spot for a wine tasting, whether you stick around for the game or not. 

The next Wine in the Park takes place Aug. 25 in conjunction with a game against the Fresno Grizzlies.
 
 Tis the Season to Hate thy Neighbor 
 [ Politics ] ( Booman Tribune )
The economy stinks no matter what people who earn their money from rigging the stock markets say. Unemployment is high, and throughout the land the hounds of hatred have been released by the usual suspects. And across the land we reap what they sow: From State n Island, New York: Police are investigating the attack of a 31-year-old Mexican man Friday, as a hate crime.

Unemployment is high, and throughout the land the hounds of hatred have been released by the usual suspects. And across the land we reap what they sow: From State n Island, New York: Police are investigating the attack of a 31-year-old Mexican man Friday, as a hate crime. The man was walking home after playing soccer in Faber Park when he was attacked by five young black males. The group yelled anti-Mexican slurs and hit the man several times before making off with his backpack. [...] This is the sixth bias attack in State n Island since April and the community is already furious over the repeated attacks. Yes, Tea Partiers, hatred is not confined to white people in your party. Nor is Arizona the only place Latinos have been persecuted for being -- well for being Latino. For as always in America, land of the free to gang up and beat down those who we have been taught to despise, State n Island is far from alone in this, The Long Hot Summer of Our Discontent With Those Not Like Us. Even a people in the &quot;liberal&quot; cities of the Northeast will join you and Tom Tancredo in your jihad against people who don&apos;t speak English as a first language. When the flames of hate are fanned there&apos;s no telling where the embers will fall. Like for example on the head of a poor Salvadoran immigrant living in Summit New Jersey who was beaten to death by a gang of teenagers for being -- himself, apparently: According to an eyewitness, at least a dozen young men were present last Saturday evening when Abelino Mazariego-Torres, 47, of Summit, was beaten so severely while sitting on a park bench that he died three days later without regaining consciousness. More detail on Abelino Mazariego-Torres inexplicable (except by sheer unmitigated hatred) murder can be found in this story about his funeral: It was crazy. It was violent. It was premeditated. Worse than all, it was sport. Poor Mazariego-Torres was the human pinata, there for the entertainment of a couple of cowards, and their follower-friends who wanted to record the whole thing. He was an easy target. He was not a big man and spoke limited English. Maybe he had a little to drink. Regardless, he was outnumbered. He was alone, minding his own business, in his own town. In a cellphone video, Mazariego-Torres is sitting on the bench, and a young man sits to his right. Behind him is another man. They seem to be joking, and Mazariego-Torres is totally relaxed. Then, with animalistic swiftness -- and there really is no better word -- Mazariego-Torres is suckered. His face is covered with his shirt, the young man on the bench gets up and throws a punch meant to take someones head off. There is no other way to say it. The boy reaches way back, and puts all he has into it. When some defense lawyer eventually says &quot;they didnt mean to hurt him,&quot; remember this: Anybody who has ever thrown a punch like that, or been hit with one, knows full well the intent. This is not being called a hate crime, but it should be. There was hate behind that punch. Yet, we are equal opportunity haters. Latinos and Hispanics may have been pushed front and center as the new Public Enemy No. 1 by the conservative media and blogs and viral emails, but they are not alone in being made the scapegoats for the anger and frustration of so many people in this country. From Hoboken, NJ: Keit Ngo is a man from Florida, in our area for business. But he says the attack has changed his focus entirely. He wants the person who assaulted him behind bars for a long time. [...] &quot;I got 10 staples to the back of my head,&quot; he said. The injuries are the result of a brutal, unprovoked attack on the streets of Hoboken. Witnesses say the suspect yelled racial slurs before knocking Ngo out cold. Did you think Asians are immune from hate crimes in America? Think again. Not even minorities that people don&apos;t usually associate with this type of vile and venomous hatred are safe on the streets of America from unprovoked attacks based on their race. Here&apos;s a more familiar example of hate (familiar because we have a long history in America of hating Jews) from Montgomery, Maryland where a Synagogue was vandalized with anti-semitic graffiti: Montgomery police are investigating vandalism at B&apos;nai Shalom of Olney as a hate crime after graffiti described as &quot;Nazi related&quot; was found on the exterior of the synagogue. Yes, Americans, Neo-Nazis are back and active again. Just check out Free Republic.com or Stormfront on any given day and I guarantee you&apos;ll find more than one rant against the Jews, among the many other fgroups at which the posters at those websites spill their bile. Then there&apos;s everybody&apos;s favorite people to bash -- and I mean that literally -- teh Gay. Back to State n Island [Note to my Southern readers: I don&apos;t just pick on your region when hate crimes or racism or bigotry rears its ugly head. It is happening all over America and no region is immune from the siren song of hate] for this episode of &quot;Let&apos;s Beat the Gay Out of Them&quot;: LGBT State n Islanders continue to demand justice for a gay couple who was attacked at a local fast food restaurant earlier this month. Luis and Richard Vieira were on their way home from a Manhattan bar around 2:20 a.m. on July 7 when they stopped at a White Castle on Bay Street in Stapleton. Luis Vieira told EDGE he and his partner noticed roughly 40 young black men and women walking down the street as they entered the restaurant, which is a few blocks from their home. A few minutes later, one of the three men from this group who entered the restaurant approached the couples table and shouted an anti-gay epithet. Luis Vieira responded, and the man turned around and walked towards a nearby exit. Seconds later, however, Luis Vieira felt something hit the back of his head. &quot;I [felt] a thump and thought did something fall out of the ceiling or something, and I then see this young kid starting to run out,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I got up and started to chase after them.&quot; Luis Vieira said he recognized the group he and his partner had previously seen in the street when he ran into the park ing lot. He grabbed his cell phone to call 911, but he quickly realized his partner was not inside the restaurant-and Luis Vieira soon discovered him bleeding and semiconscious in the park ing lot. &quot;I started screaming,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I ran to him; he was covered in blood.&quot; You see, Whites and Blacks do have something in common. Too many of us have been conned by the mouthpieces of malevolence to detest Lesbian, Gay, Trans-Gendered and Bi-Sexual people (yes they are &quot;people&quot; my little haters, fellow human beings just like you and me). And let&apos;s not forget the nearly lethal hate crime against &quot;liberals&quot; that was stopped just in time this past week, when a lone gunman was stopped from carrying out mass murder against the ACLU in San Francisco: A California man accused in a shootout with California Highway Patrol officers in Oakland early Sunday told officials that he traveled to San Francisco and planned to attack two nonprofit groups there &quot;to start a revolution,&quot; according to a probable cause state ment released by police. Bryon Williams, 45, a convicted felon with two prior bank robbery convictions, targeted workers at the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tides Foundation, said Oakland police Sgt. Michael Weisenberg in court documents. Officer Jeff Thomason, an Oakland police spokesman, claimed Williams targeted the two nonprofit organizations because of their political ideologies. The Tides Foundation works to advance progressive social change, according to its Web site. [...] Williams&apos; mother, Janice Williams, said to the San Francisco Chronicle that her son was angry with &quot;the way Congress was railroading through all these left-wing agenda items.&quot; Yes, Virginia, even in the Marxist State of Northern California, right wing &quot;revolutionaries&quot; plot to kill their Communist Overlords groups working for social justice and progressive political change. Gee, I wonder where this &quot;patriot&quot; got the idea that members of the ACLU and the Tides Foundation deserved to be executed because Congress passed health care and financial industry reforms? I&apos;d never heard of the Tides Foundation before this story came out? I wonder, could it have been -- Glenn Beck of Fox News? We&apos;re talking about people who say enforce the border and it is racism. We know that if they can cobble this together, they win the next election for the next 50 years. You use, infiltrate or corrupt the most powerful institute at your disposal. Well, they have the education system. They have the media. They have the capitalist system. What do you think the Tides Foundation was? They infiltrate and they saw under Ronald Reagan that capitalists were not for all of this nonsense, so they infiltrated. Now, they are using failing capitalism to destroy it. They&apos;re using the churches through social justice. The media  do I have to explain that one? This is what progressives and all power-seekers do. They find something vulnerable. They latch on to it. They exploit it for power. Shirley Sherrod was the victim of a hate crime too, but at least she didn&apos;t get her jaw broken, or her head bashed in or shot at by a suspoected Glenn Beck fanb boy because of serial defamation performance artist Andrew Breitbart&apos;s (and Fox News&apos;) desire to take down the NAACP. Still, she is a victim of mindless hate, hate that is the primary emotion that fuels the political discourse in our nation. Hate from the right: [M]ake no mistake; it is a right-wing political agenda that is successfully driving the direction of our public discourse. Shirley Sherrod was the most recent victim of an insidious right-wing propaganda campaign to prove black racism against whites exists and is supported at the highest levels of government. Her much publicized, heavily edited speech, to allegedly demonstrate Sherrod, who is black, was openly hostile toward whites is tragic on so many levels. It&apos;s tragic because her story was one of redemption. A story of how an individual whose father was murdered by a white man overcame her prejudices to do the right thing to help farmers regardless of color. [...] This is indeed a low point in American discourse. A heavily edited video, originating from an unreliable source on the Internet, goes unchecked, airs on national television, resulting in a woman being unjustly fired. I&apos;d like to point out recent of left wing nutcases and bigots who listen exclusively to Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow on MsNBC and then go on killing sprees against conservatives or Conservative Christians, just to be fair and balanced, but to be honest I can&apos;t find any examples. And no, my right wing friends, Muslim radicals like Major Nidal Malik Hasan who took his inspiration from a radical Islamic extremist and spiritual leader Anwar al-Awlaki, now hiding out in Yemen doesn&apos;t count as a &quot;liberal&quot; or a &quot;Socialist&quot; Democrat. No, this is the season for hate. An unusually hot summer. High unemployment. And right wing politicians and media figures eager to point fingers at who is to blame for all your troubles, eager it seems to pepper us with talk of who deserves your ire. And, while I can;t say for a fact that they intend to see our society devolve into violence, you have to wonder what they think they are doing when they spread around rhetoric, like this from Mr. Glenn Beck, to their listeners: But in our country&apos;s history, there is also a history, during the Wilson administration, of communist anarchists. And I know that sounds like an oxymoron. How can you have control of a giant state and want anarchy? You want anarchy in the same way that president Ahmadinejad wants chaos because chaos leads to something. [...] Tie that together with what is happening in Arizona: Intimidate and scare. What did Andy Stern say? We know where you live. We know who you are. Intimidate and scare. The Black Panthers: We&apos;re coming to 8/28. We&apos;re going to stand up. We&apos;re going to show Glenn Beck what it is. Intimidate and scare. This is the tactic. This is the new phase that we&apos;re entering in. Intimidation. They tried to do it just with SEIU during the tea party movement. That wasn&apos;t enough. They also need, I believe, a race riot. They need the race riot. Or what about this headline which Beck posted on his website back in January: &quot;Not &apos;useful&apos;? Progressives want you dead&quot; Or this from El Rushbo himself back in January: &quot;We are at war with our own president, we are at war with our own government&quot; Well, it is an election year. Fear and Hate are the principle attacks that Republican candidates make. Remember Sarah Palin in 2008? I do. And I expect our season of hate to continue for as long as the right believes it benefits them to divide Americans one from another. They have no policies or programs or new ideas to create jobs or turn our economy around. But they do have fear and hate, and a group of corporations, media outlets, bloggers and useful idiots willing to ratchet up that hate in the hopes of derailing what progress we&apos;ve seen under Obama and the Democrats. Already they have done everything they could to stop health care and financial reform, or water it down, all while scaring the gullible and their base. Some Republicans have even gone so far as to say the First Amendment doesn&apos;t necessarily protect certain religions from government restrictions because those religions are arguably just cults against which we can discriminate. Guess which one: Now, you could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult whatever you want to call it. ... Now, you know, I&apos;m all about freedom of religion. I value the First Amendment as much as I value the Second Amendment as much as I value the Tenth Amendment and on and on and on. But you cross the line when they try to start bringing Sharia Law here to the state of Tennessee -- to the United State s. We live under our Constitution and they live under our Constitution. If those remarks weren&apos;t designed to stir up hate against Muslim Americans for the benefit of the Republican candidate in question, what was the purpose they for which they were spoken in public? So, I see more and more hate crimes in our future. That&apos;s unfortunately a prediction that I&apos;m afraid will continue to come true so long as the right dominates our political discourse.

 Sixth in a series of training-camp reports. 

 CHICAGO BEARS 

 Training-camp site: Olivet Nazarene University, Bourbonnais, Ill.

 Training-camp report date: July 30.

 Key veteran arrivals: S Chris Harris, CB Tim Jennings, TE Brandon Manumaleuna, DE Julius Peppers, RB Chester Taylor.

 Key veteran departures: DE Alex Brown, RB Kevin Jones, FB Jason McKie, DE Adewale Ogunleye, OT Orlando Pace, S Kevin Payne, CB Nathan Vasher, LB Jamar Williams.

 Drafted rookies: (3) S Major Wright; (4) DE Corey Wootton; (5) CB Joshua Moore; (6) QB Dan LeFevour; (7) OT J&apos;Marcus Webb.

 Offensive overview: Make way for Mike Martz, the Bears&apos; new offensive coordinator whose résumé is highlighted by the famous &quot;Greatest Show on Turf&quot; offense he previously put together as the head coach of the Rams. Unlike his predecessor, Ron Turner, Martz prefers to use passes to set up the run, stressing an aggressive, high-risk, high-reward approach that forces opposing defenses to make constant adjustments. A key factor will be how well Martz is able to mesh with cannon-armed QB Jay Cutler, who couldn&apos;t be coming off a more disappointing season after hurling a league-leading 26 interceptions (as opposed to 27 TDs) in 2009. Early indications are that Martz and Cutler are having no problem at all staying on the same page with what both consider to be a very underrated receiving corps that included five players with 45 or more receptions last season — TE Greg Olsen (60), WR Devin Hester (57), RB Matt Forté (57), WR Earl Bennett (54) and WR Johnny Knox (45) — as well as Devin Aromashodu, one of the league&apos;s most productive receivers the last month of the &apos;09 season. In addition to Martz, fresh blood is being provided by new O-line coach Mike Tice and free-agent additions Chester Taylor, who should keep Forté a lot fresher, and TE/blocking specialist Brandon Manumaleuna.

 Defensive overview: Make way for Rod Marinelli, the former defensive line coach who becomes the Bears&apos; third defensive coordinator in as many seasons despite never before being a coordinator at any level. The defense is expected to get a big boost from DE Julius Peppers, the offseason&apos;s highest-profile free agent. Look for Marinelli to move Peppers around on the D-line to create mismatches and bolster a pass rush that improved marginally last season (35 sacks up from 28 the previous season). The Bears&apos; system remains highly discipline-oriented with an allegiance to the cover-2 concept head coach Lovie Smith was weaned on as an assistant back in the day with Tampa Bay. The Bears are hoping that both MLB Brian Urlacher, who missed almost the entire &apos;09 campaign with a dislocated right wrist, and DT Tommie Harris, who has been hindered the last couple of seasons by knee issues and off-field problems, regain their Pro Bowl form. The Bears also will need to improve significantly in passing situations after allowing seven opposing receivers to have 100-yard games last season and managing only one interception combined from their safeties.
 
Battle to watch: Strong competition will be evident at strong-side linebacker, where a pair of players who have both performed well in the past — Pisa Tinoisamoa and Nick Roach — will be battling for the starting job. Tinoisamoa, who had his &apos;09 campaign cut short by a knee injury, and Roach, who tied for the team lead in &apos;09 with 10 tackles for loss, are both undersized go-getters who run quite well, which is important in the Bears&apos; defense. 

 Injury update: Veteran C Olin Kreutz (Achilles), WR Edgar Bennett (knee) and Manumaleuna (knee) are all expected to be fully recovered from offseason surgeries in time for training camp. Tinoisamoa hardly participated in the team&apos;s OTAs but is also expected to be 100 percent in time for camp. The big-time burst Forté displayed as a rookie appears to have returned following surgery to his left knee. This is the first season in three years in which Harris isn&apos;t coming off a surgical procedure. Urlacher, meanwhile, is saying he has never felt healthier after being shut down most of last season.

 Fantasy sleeper: In the final four games last season, Aromashodu had 22 catches for 282 yards and four TDs. Multiply those numbers by four and you get 88-1,128-16 — impressive fantasy figures to say the least. Cutler loves throwing to Aromashodu, and even though Aromashodu will be competing with a large crowd of receivers for touches, he still possesses very intriguing fantasy potential.

 

 DETROIT LIONS 

 Training-camp site: Detroit Lions Training Facility, Allen Park , Mich.

 Training-camp report date: July 30.

 Key veteran arrivals: CB Dré Bly, WR Nate Burleson, QB Shaun Hill, CB Chris Houston, LB Landon Johnson, OG Rob Sims, DE Kyle Vanden Bosch, CB Jonathan Wade, CB Dante Wesley, DT Corey Williams.

 Key veteran departures: CB Phillip Buchanon, ILB Larry Foote, CB Anthony Henry, LB Ernie Sims, DE Dewayne White.

 Drafted rookies: (1) DT Ndamukong Suh, RB Jahvid Best; (3) CB Amari Spievey; (4) OT Jason Fox; (7) DE Willie Young, RS-WR Tim Toone.

 Offensive overview: The pieces are starting to fall into place for the Lions, who are attempting to surround QB Matthew Stafford with a stronger cast. Stafford flashed his toughness and arm strength and now needs to improve his accuracy and decision making. Some of the offensive additions should help him do that. The team added speed and receiving ability in the backfield with RB Jahvid Best. There is more help to draw defensive attention from WR Calvin Johnson with the additions of WR Nate Burleson and TE Tony Scheffler. And the offensive line received a little tweaking with the trade for OLG Rob Sims, who could win the starting job. Coordinator Scott Linehan always has run a vertical offense, which suits Stafford and Johnson well, but head coach Jim Schwartz also wants to be tough. That means getting more physical up front and running the ball early and late in games. They want to be the aggressors more and not have to change game plans after falling into big holes early in games.
 
Defensive overview: This group has been a mess for years now, and the brass continues to manipulate the personnel from Rod Marinelli&apos;s Tampa-2 style defenders to fit Schwartz&apos;s attacking 4-3 system, which favors more size up front. The team made three major additions up front, trading for DT Corey Williams, signing DE Kyle Vanden Bosch and drafting DT Ndamukong Suh. Although the linebackers and secondary must be sorted out, the significantly improved front four should allow for more pressure and better run defense, which will make everyone else&apos;s jobs easier. MLB DeAndre Levy and FS Louis Delmas are building-block players in the back seven, but quality starters have not been established at every other spot, with weak-side linebacker and strong safety the biggest holes right now. Still, Schwartz and GM Martin Mayhew have crafted a better roster with playmakers at all three levels.

 Battle to watch: Strong safety is an open field. Wide open. It&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess who the front-runner is now, much less who will end up with the job when the Lions head to Chicago on Sept. 12. Marquand Manuel and C.C. Brown have experience, each having started more than 50 games in the NFL, but each is coming off a sub-par season. Ko Simpson is in the mix, but he&apos;s coming back from microfracture surgery and might not be ready for camp. Daniel Bullocks and Marvin White also are possibilities. Some were surprised when Bullocks returned, having missed last season with microfracture surgery, but he appears fully healthy and could be a sleeper in this battle. Expect Mayhew to scour the wire for help, even up through the final weeks of the preseason; there was talk that the team was sniffing around disgruntled Chiefs S Jarrad Page.

 Injury update: TE Brandon Pettigrew and RB Kevin Smith are coming off torn ACLs, suffered three weeks apart last season, and could be limited at the start of camp. Each is being counted on to play a significant role, so the Lions will ease them back slowly. Smith appears to be an eyelash ahead of Pettigrew in terms of field readiness. Simpson and CB Jack Williams (knee) were limited in OTAs and might begin camp on the PUP list.

 Fantasy sleeper: Scheffler isn&apos;t considered fantasy-starter material, but he has been flashing great seam speed in OTAs like he did in Denver. With Pettigrew slowed, Scheffler has had time to establish a rapport with Stafford and could be the team&apos;s third-leading receiver behind Johnson and Burleson.

 

 GREEN BAY PACKERS 

 Training-camp site: St. Norbert College, Green Bay, Wis.

 Training-camp report date: July 30.
 
Key veteran arrivals: None.

 Key veteran departures: DE Johnny Jolly, LOLB Aaron Kampman, DE Mike Montgomery, P Jeremy Kapinos, FS Matt Giordano.
 
Drafted rookies: (1) OT Bryan Bulaga; (2) DE Mike Neal; (3) SS Morgan Burnett; (5) TE Andrew Quarless, OG Marshall Newhouse; (6) RB James Starks; (7) DE C.J. Wilson .

 Offensive overview: Coming off a season in which it set a franchise record with 461 points, the Packers&apos; multifaceted offense packs a mighty punch. Last year the unit became the first in league history to feature a 4,000-yard passer (Aaron Rodgers), a 1,200-yard rusher (Ryan Grant) and two 1,000-yard receivers (Greg Jennings and Donald Driver) in back-to-back seasons. Rodgers, who became the first quarterback in league history to pass for more than 4,000 yards in his first two years as a starter, keeps mistakes to a minimum and is excellent in third-down situations. An already well-rounded receiving corps became even more explosive with the emergence of TE Jermichael Finley, a very physically gifted player with perennial Pro Bowl potential. If there&apos;s a problem on offense, it&apos;s an offensive line that gave up a whopping 37 sacks the first half of last season. A key factor on the line will be the extent to which aging, injury-prone OTs Chad Clifton and Mark Tauscher can stay on the field.  

 Defensive overview: There&apos;s no denying that the defense&apos;s 3-4 conversion under new coordinator Dom Capers last season ended up working like a charm. In addition to ranking second overall and first against the run for the first-time ever, Green Bay&apos;s defense led the league with 30 interceptions. Capers&apos; ultimate chess piece is veteran CB Charles Woodson, who tied for a league high in &apos;09 with nine interceptions (three of which he returned for scores) and excelled at covering the opposing team&apos;s best receiver. Capers is anticipating improvement in the team&apos;s pass rush with 2009 first-round draft pick B.J. Raji taking over as the starting nose tackle and making more of an impact after an injury-plagued rookie campaign, Big things are again expected from the team&apos;s other &apos;09 first-round pick, ROLB Clay Matthews, a relentless playmaker who led the team and set a team rookie record with 10 sacks last season. As good as the defense was in &apos;09, perplexing across-the-board meltdowns in shootout losses to the Steelers in Week 15 and the Cardinals in the playoffs were hard to fathom. The defense must also overcome the indefinite suspension of DE johnny Jolly, who led the unit&apos;s D-linemen with 39 tackles last season.
 
Battle to watch: It will be worth keeping close tabs on the SS position, where incumbent Atari Bigby, who is unhappy with his contract and has yet to sign his restricted free-agent tender, could get a real run for his money from third-round rookie Morgan Burnett. Bigger and faster than Bigby, Burnett has received rave reviews so far this offseason. The big question is whether he can hit as well as Bigby, who always packs a wallop, for better or worse.

 Injury update: Continuing his intense rehabilitation for a nasty knee injury suffered in Week 11 against the Niners last season, it remains to be seen whether 35-year-old starting CB Al Harris will be able to start Week One. Harris is doing everything in his power to make it back in time for a full season, but it remains quite possible that he could start the year on the physically-unable-to-perform list. RILB Nick Barnett and WR Donald Driver have taken it easy so far this offseason after undergoing arthroscopic &quot;clean up&quot; knee surgeries, but they both should be good to go without missing much of a beat in training camp. Versatile reserve OL T.J. Lang will be very anxious to make up for lost time in training camp after missing all of the team&apos;s spring OTAs and minicamps with a fractured wrist that required surgery in April.

 Fantasy sleeper: By all accounts, WR James Jones, who remains stuck behind Jennings and Driver on the depth chart, has had an outstanding offseason up to now. With the 35-year-old Driver starting to slow down, Jones, who managed five TDs in &apos;09 despite being the fifth option, could end up being a surprising fantasy force.

 

 MINNESOTA VIKINGS 

 Training-camp site: Minnesota State University, Mankato, Minn.

 Training-camp report date: July 30.

 Key veteran arrivals: PK Rhys Lloyd, DE Mike Montgomery, CB Lito Sheppard.

 Key veteran departures: OL Artis Hicks, CB Karl Paymah, RB Chester Taylor.

 Drafted rookies: (2) CB Chris Cook, RB Toby Gerhart; (4) DE Everson Griffen; (5) OG Chris DeGeare, LB Nathan Triplett; (6) QB-WR Joe Webb; (7) TE Mickey Shuler, FB Ryan D&apos;Imperio.

 Offensive overview: The Vikings took a major jump with the addition of QB Brett Favre last season, also transforming from an Adrian Peterson-dependent team to one that could pass its way to a victory — and often did. Obviously, the hope in Minnesota is that Favre returns for another season, and though we don&apos;t yet know his plans, all signs point to yes. Under Favre&apos;s watch, WRs Sidney Rice and Percy Harvin became dangerous weapons, and the team has other strong receiving options with TE Visanthe Shiancoe and WR Bernard Berrian. The offensive line has a good pedigree and is coming off a mostly strong season, and it should hold up again as a bedrock. Peterson might not be the focus any longer, and he has fumbling issues he must curb, but the run game remains potent. The addition of rookie RB Toby Gerhart should offset the loss of Chester Taylor, even though they have different skill sets.

 Defensive overview: The run defense remained elite and the team finished with 48 sacks, and nearly all of the crucial pieces remain. MLB E.J. Henderson, the heart of the unit, is coming off his second season-ending injury in a row — this one a broken leg in December — and might not be ready to return to top form immediately. But with a standout defensive line, the Vikings should be in top form again. DEs Jared Allen and Ray Edwards (who might be ready to make a big jump) and DTs Kevin Williams and Pat Williams are as fearsome a front four as you&apos;ll find, even as Pat Williams, who turns 38 in October, approaches the twilight of his career. The secondary is a concern, with injuries and poor safety play the biggest culprits. But otherwise, this should be a very strong defense.

 Battle to watch: Tyrell Johnson hasn&apos;t emerged as the strong safety the Vikings envisioned when they drafted him in Round Two a few years back. He hasn&apos;t been awful, but there are holes in his game and he has been challenged by 2009 seventh-rounder Jamarca Sanford, who got more reps on defense late last season and was splitting time with Johnson this offseason. Sanford lacks size but not pop — he&apos;s a big hitter with good instincts and a mean streak he flashed on special teams. The Vikings are downplaying the competition here, but don&apos;t be surprised if Sanford steals some time from Johnson unless there is improvement.

 Injury update: Brad Childress has danced around Henderson&apos;s status all offseason, but the linebacker was taking part in individual drills fewer than seven months after fracturing his left femur, which is pretty remarkable. If he&apos;s not back to full health, Jasper Brinkley will take over again. Brinkley was solid last season but struggled at times in pass coverage. OLG Steve Hutchinson (shoulder surgery), CB Cedric Griffin (knee) and Pat Williams (elbow) were non-participants in OTAs, and the prognosis to return by the start of camp is good for all except Griffin, who tore the ACL in his left knee in the NFC championship game in January. He could land on the PUP list and be limited early on. Favre, should he return, is coming off ankle surgery this offseason.

 Fantasy sleeper: On a deep team with a number of established stars, there are few true sleepers. But keep an eye on Gerhart, who could earn 6-10 carries per game and have a big impact on the run game. Owners of Peterson should try to snag Gerhart late to try to protect against Peterson getting hurt.

 Diane Von Furstenberg, Prabal Gurung And Norma Kamali Talk Fashion And NYC 
 [ Huffington Post ] ( The Full Feed from HuffingtonPost.com )
&quot;Even if there were no more designers, there would always be fashion,&quot; Diane von Furstenberg uttered on Tuesday night, speaking at the New York Times&apos; TimesTalks. &quot;Even if nobody bought anything new, there would be fashion. All of a sudden, the kids would wear something the same way.&quot; Von Furstenberg, fellow designers Norma Kamali and Prabal Gurung and Fashion Week&apos;s creator Fern Mallis spoke to Times&apos; reporter Eric WIlson about the state of the industry in conjunction with this summer&apos;s Sidewa ...

&quot;Even if there were no more designers, there would always be fashion,&quot; Diane von Furstenberg uttered on Tuesday night, speaking at the New York Times &apos; TimesTalks. &quot;Even if nobody bought anything new, there would be fashion. All of a sudden, the kids would wear something the same way.&quot;

Von Furstenberg, fellow designers Norma Kamali and Prabal Gurung and Fashion Week&apos;s creator Fern Mallis spoke to Times &apos; reporter Eric WIlson about the state of the industry in conjunction with this summer&apos;s Sidewalk Catwalk launch , a fashion-meets-art installation that brings 32 differently-designed mannequins to the pedestrian mall on Broadway between Herald Square and Times Square. The three couturiers explained how they came up with their Sidewalk Catwalk creations--Gurung&apos;s serves as an homage to the late Alexander McQueen, Kamali&apos;s represents her affinity for technology, and von Furstenberg&apos;s leopard-print painted mannequin is, well, best explained by DVF herself.

&quot;Leopard print is completely timeless,&quot; von Furstenberg cooed. &quot;It was hot in the &apos;30s, in the &apos;40s, in the &apos;50s, in the &apos;60s, in the &apos;70s, all the time. And, why? Why? Because there&apos;s nothing more beautiful than a leopard, the way the print comes and moves and goes up and down and narrows.&quot; She added, &quot;There&apos;s something about a woman who feels feline. And it&apos;s kind of nice to feel feline,&quot; and quipped, &quot;I guess that&apos;s why the leopards wear it.&quot;

Von Furstenberg also reflected on the popularity of her wrap dress, sometimes made in leopard print, noting, &quot;It&apos;s a dress that always reflects the beginning of your life. It&apos;s like, &apos;Oh, I met my boyfriend,&apos; &apos;Oh, I got my first job,&apos; &apos;Oh, I just got laid.&apos;&quot;

Although the Times event quickly evolved into The Quotable Diane von Furstenberg (On It Bags: &quot;You only know a bag is it, when it&apos;s it!&quot;), Kamali and Gurung were able to get a few words in.

Kamali gave the history of her sleeping bag coat: &quot;I used to camp a lot in the &apos;70s, I would go every weekend and one night, having to go to the bathroom in the woods, it was freezing cold and I just dragged my sleeping bag with me. As I was running back, I thought I have to make a coat out of this.&quot; She shared that one season, someone ordered the wrong filler for the sleeves, causing them to be too thick to sell, so she donated them to a shelter in Minnesota.

Kamali also touched on why she doesn&apos;t show at fashion week, despite her huge success, saying &quot;We know who we are and we know what we do best. I&apos;m a background kind of person, I&apos;m better kind of not being noticed.... I want to do what I want to do, so I&apos;ve never had partners, never had investors. For me to do it, I have to find a way to do it my way.&quot;

Gurung, who informally represented the new generation designers, is virtually the poster boy of those living the fashion dream. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t have had the courage, the guts to start on something if hadn&apos;t have known these things were out there,&quot; he said, referring to the Fashion Incubator and CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund programs, two initiatives for up-and-coming designers exclusive to New York.

He&apos;s kept the city in mind as he&apos;s launched his own collection, explaining, &quot;Ninety-five percent of my collection is done in New York and five percent is done in Nepal, because the cashmere is made in Nepal. For me it&apos;s a very conscious decision to make in New York. It&apos;s been a commitment from me as a designer, as a brand and it&apos;s my way of giving back to this country that gave me this dream.&quot; He also spent a large portion of the time allotted for the Q&amp;As; assuring a concerned audience member that many young designers share his Made In New York mentality.

While the fashion world might be synonymous with NYC, it doesn&apos;t mean that it hasn&apos;t had its problems within the city. On the topic of Fashion Week&apos;s move to Lincoln Center, Von Furstenberg revealed, &quot;We would have stayed at Bryant Park , they didn&apos;t want us, and now of course they miss us.&quot; Mallis said, &quot;We were evicted.&quot; But Mallis most accurately summed up the rise of the city&apos;s fashion industry with the phrase, &quot;There&apos;s strength in numbers.&quot;

She continued, &quot;I think the American fashion industry proved that a long time ago. When I was the director of the CFDA...no one was coming to America to see American designers. It was Paris, Milan...New York was second fiddle. Once everybody worked together to show in one location it completely changed the landscape.&quot;

Note – this nine (9) member Board requires five (5) members to establish quorum and to take official Board action. Members Present – Ben Acohido, Cindy Bauer, Joeseph Francher, Jeanne Ishikawa, Silvia Koch, Mary Jane Lee, Robert Lormand, Hugh Lowery. Member Absent – Dean Harvest. Vacancies – None. Guests – Major Ken Simmons, Lt. Benjamin Ballesteros, Jr., Sgt. Vivian (Honolulu Police Department); Capt. Scott Fukumae (Honolulu Fire Department)Dave Watkins (NCTAMS), Tommy Meza (U.S. Army), Mark Takemoto (Pioneer), Kevin Chang (Office of Hawaiian Affairs);Dawn Burgener, Kristen Killian and Randy Gillespie (Lanakila Pacific), Keapoi Namakaeha and Wilfredo “Willy” Pormento (Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance), Patrick Lum (Vineyard Investments), Tammy Escorzon, William Hopper (Bethel Bible Church), Keanu Young (Office of Councilmember Donovan Dela Cruz), Thomas Young (Board of Water Supply), Mike Lyons (Chair, North Shore Neighborhood Board No. 27), , Mary Chanel-Benjamin (Neighborhood Commission Office staff). City monthly reports: Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) – Capt. Scott Fukumae reported the following information: Statistics for June 2010 – Included 1 structure, 1 wildland, 1 rubbish and 57 medical emergencies; no major or unusual incidents were reported. Fire Safety Tip – As summer approaches, the island will be at higher risk for fires due to dry vegetation and hot weather. Residents are encouraged to use caution when utilizing flame-producing devices and reminded that children under the age of 18 shall not possess fireworks, matches, and/or lighters, except under adult supervision. Questions, comments and concerns followed: 1) Relating to the Homeless – At least 95% of the homeless near the bridges have been relocated. 2) Statistics on Fireworks – Enforcement will begin on June 30, 2010 to curb illegal fireworks. Honolulu Police Department (HPD) – Lt. Benjamin Ballesteros, Jr. reported the following information: May 2010 Statistics – Included 16 burglaries, 20 unauthorized entry into motor vehicles, 33 thefts, 5 auto thefts with 8 recoveries, and 5 graffiti. Safety Tip – Citizen’s concerns and complaints are welcome anytime; however, it is best to report crime and concerns as they are occurring or being observed. Incidents may be anonymously reported; however, responding officers may enforce only ‘on-view’ violations. Violations or crimes may need complainants and witnesses to come forward to be investigated and enforced. New District HPD Officers – Introduced were Major Ken Simmons newly appointed to the Wahiawa District and Sgt. Vivian of the Community Policing Team. Questions, comments and concerns followed: 1) Seasonal Crime – Wahiawa was considered to have a low crime rate compared to other districts. There was the usual seasonal crime increase during summer and holidays. HPD usually will support those areas targeted by high crime known as ‘hot points or spots’. HPD are also busy during the months of May and June when graduation parties are held to curb the all night loud parties and drinking in residential areas. 2) Burglary Defense – HPD recommends allowing them to handle burglary events; however, if you are being overcome with force then in self defense one should forcefully defend one self against the burglar. The best defense is for the homeowner to get out of the home away from the burglar before a struggle. 3) Fireworks – HPD will cite and arrest those violating the law in public as well as park s. Board Vacant Seats – There are no vacant seats at this time. Mayor Mufi Hannemann – A report was read by Chair Acohido from the Mayor’s office: Our Lady of Sorrows Property – The City Department of Community Services have no objection if the community wishes to pursue use of the privately owned site as a homeless shelter; however, funding and security would be concerns of the property owners. Land use restriction would apply without any city role in these areas. Public Transportation at Whitmore Village – Currently, there is no budget to provide bus service; however the short range transit plan effort is reviewing bus service island-wide and certain to include Whitmore Village as part of this effort. Also, keeping in mind, the rail transit will liberate buses from the congested primary corridor to allow for more buses to be extended in areas such as Whitmore Village. Sidewalk Blocked – There were currently no obstructions on Kamehameha Highway sidewalk. Strobe Lights – According to a field check by the City Department of Transportation Services (DTS), blinking lights were never installed at Avocado/Walker Streets. Speed Bump Re-Stripping – A work order was issued for the work to be done at Walker and Avocado Streets. Wahiawa Transit Center (WTC) – There was a report that the WTC will not have public bathrooms. Questions, comments and concerns followed: 1) WTC – A private bathroom will not do the public any good if they can’t use it; the public was urged to continue asking the City to provide the WTC a public bathroom. 2) California Avenue – Depending on the weather, the project is slated to take about a year beginning in November 2010. The project entails a total resurfacing to include replacement of several layers of surface. Board of Water Supply (BWS) – Thomas Young reported the following information: - Drinking Water Standards – BWS works hard to ensure that the water served to residents meets or exceeds all federal and state safe drinking water standards and wants to reassure residents that the water served is safe to drink. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the federal law that governs the quality of drinking water in the United State s. Under the SDWA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards for drinking water quality and oversees state compliance with those standards. In Hawaii, the State Department of Health (DOH) is responsible for ensuring that all public and private drinking water suppliers comply with all laws for safe drinking water. The DOH and EPA is responsible to monitor and enforce these regulations. - BWS Water Tests – Every year BWS and DOH conducts thousands of tests on the water source and distribution systems to ensure that the water you receive is safe to drink. These tests check for more than 100 different types of contaminants, as required by the EPA. All final test results show the BWS is in full compliance with state and federal standards for safe drinking water. If the water quality tests conducted did not meet safe standards; BWS would be required by law to immediately notify impacted customers and more importantly, BWS would stop serving the water until it met all water regulations. Bottom line, our BWS water is safe to drink. - Water Treatment – BWS treats water in accordance with all federal and state drinking water regulations. Currently, the BWS treats drinking water with chlorine and in certain areas of Oahu the water is treated with granular activated carbon. - What is in the Water – Water quality test results are shared with customers in the annual water quality report or Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) as required by the EPA. The report along with an accompanying water quality information pamphlet is mailed each year to BWS customers by July 1. The CCR identifies where your water comes from, what regulated contaminants were found, how those levels compare to the standards for safe drinking water, and describes any treatment processes used. Reports are also available on BWS’s website. - Water Conservation/Leaks – It has been a dry year; consider some conservation measures; Oahu is experiencing a continued seven year drought. Residents experiencing a spike in their water bills should check for water leaks. It is suggested to shut the water valve off first and if the dial is still spinning, this means there is a water leak to repair. The BWS repair line is 748-5000. - Lake Wilson – Kahe Point only has one fire hydrant and HFD uses Lake Wilson as a backup when needed to extinguish fires in the area. - Furlough Fridays – The BWS’s Beretania Street office will be closed only one Friday a month; however, BWS is working on a staggering office schedule to keep coverage 24/7 for service. You can reach BWS at 748-5041 or log onto to the web at www.boardofwatersupply.com. Questions, comments and concerns followed: Water Filter Use – BWS reports the water it provides is safe for drinking; however, residents can opt to use filters if they choose. Pipes within residents are the responsibility of the homeowners. BWS provides charcoal chlorination filtered water for the areas of North Shore to Kunia due to agriculture land and other areas chlorinated only. About 400 BWS pump stations are annually tested. Councilmember Donovan Dela Cruz – Keanu Young reported the following information: Emergency Sirens – In order to ensure public safety, Oahu’s warning system must be operational in all areas. There has been several Council committee meeting discussions addressing the issue of the government installation, repair, and updating of Civil Defense sirens. After introducing Resolution 10-59 addressing the need; 71 sirens will be upgraded and 53 additional installations are pending for Oahu’s total of 143 of the 267 sirens needed state wide. Capital Improvements Projects (CIP) – The City hopes to start construction this fall on a 4-foot high chain link fence and concrete mowing strip for the Mililani Mauka Community Park (MMCP). Usage is high at the park because there are only two City park s in the mauka area. In the 2009 fiscal year (FY) CIP, $250,000 was appropriated to design and construct the fence at MMCP. In FY 2011, the City appropriated $140,000 to construct playground equipment at MMCP as well as $690,000 to construct basketball and tennis courts. Bill 34 – Councilmember Gary Okino has introduced Bill 34 to consider an outright ban on fireworks. The July 14, 2010 is when the City Council is due to vote on the bill. Roadways – The City Department of Facility Maintenance has completed filling much of the pot holes reported. City Council – The Council voted Lee Donohue, a 40-year veteran of HPD, to fill a vacant seat on the City Council left vacant by now Congressman Djou. Council Action – Filed was Bill 15, relating to the City Executive Operating Budget and Program for the FY 2010/11. Second Reading: Bill 16 relating to the Executive Budget and Programs for the FY 2010/11. Real Property Taxes (RPT): Resolution 10-60 lists all of the proposed rates for the various real property tax classifications. Mayor Hannemann’s budget proposed to raise non-homeowners class rates from $3.42 to $3.72 per every $1,000; these figures represent a starting point for discussion and the Council is searching for ways to reduce this increase. Questions, comments and concerns followed: 1) Bill 43 – What is Councilmember Dela Cruz’s opinion regarding this Bill; K. Young will consult with the Councilmember. 2) Bill 23 – The Bill relating to agriculture dwelling has been incorporated into Bill 24 by the City Department of Planning and Permitting Task Force; amending the Bill to propose limiting dwelling space on agriculture. A public hearing on this matter is pending. 3) Traffic Calming – Some cities on the U.S. mainland have installed a safety measure curbing speeding. This measure places a small dip in the roadway preventing vehicles from Armed forces: United State s Army – Command Sergeant Major Meza reported the following information: New Commander – Colonel Mulbury has been named the lead commander at Wheeler Air Force Base on Oahu. Re-Deployments – The Second BCT will deploy in two weeks; redeployment service will be this Thursday beginning at 10:00 a.m., June 24 at Seal Field. The 130 Unit have returned from duty and will hold their service this Friday, June 25 at 10:00 a.m. at Hamilton Field. The public is invited to greet and support our troops as they return from overseas. A gesture well deserved. July 4 Celebrations – The Schofield gates will begin allowing families onto the base for festivities celebrating our nation’s birthday at 1:00 p.m.; fireworks begin at 8:30 p.m. Proper vehicle documents and a valid driver’s license will be required to enter the base. Security – Currently, security guards for entry gate duties are being hired and certified. United State s Navy – Chief Walker reported the following information: Operation Aloha – The aloha drive is at its half way mark with about 12,000 pounds of food, 300 pounds of clothing, and $2,000 already collected; its estimated a total of 20,000 pounds of food will be donated by the end of the drive. Questions, comments and concerns followed: Wahiawa Distribution – It was suggested to consider sharing distribution support with the Wahiawa homeless community besides the Wahiawa community. Chief Walker will share this message with the committee. Residents’/community concerns: There were no current concerns. Approval of regular meeting minutes: The May 15, 2010 minutes were approved without objections. Reports: Treasurer Report – Vice-Chair Francher reported The Total Appropriated balance for the month of May 2010 was now $3,067.01. The Operating state ment reflected $39.84 for postage and printing expenses leaving a sub balance of $951.01. The Publicity state ment remained at $2,116 without expenses. And for the month of June 2010: The Total Appropriated balance was now $3,029.67. The Operating state ment reflected $37.34 for postage and printing expenses leaving a sub balance of $913.67. The Publicity state ment remained at $2,116 without expenses. Chair’s Report – Chair Acohido reported the following: Certificate of Appreciation for Mr. Fred Sol, Wahiawa District Complex – A request was pending to present F. Sol with an appreciation certificate for his services to the community. Wahiawa Bus Transit Center – The subject was discussed earlier during the meeting tonight. As noted, it’s reported the facility will not offer a public bathroom. Request Status Report of Wahiawa Wastewater Facility – A $26.5 million dollar bid was awarded to Oceanic Companies to begin improvements meeting EPA standards at the Wahiawa facility; it’s the oldest facility on Oahu. The work begins in September 2010 for the back system and in December for the front system. This work does not entail any expansion; only upgrades to the existing footprint. Committees: Dam/Waterway – Hugh Lowery reported the following information: Lake Wilson – Dole and Howard Green have agreed to repair the Ford gate in order to control the water-flow at Lake Wilson . The spillway water repairs will cost over $1 million dollars. Rainwater overflow mixed with sewage is being dumped into the lake which the State Department of Health says it’s approved as R1; however, a report was still pending from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to share with the community. A continue effort with all agencies including the North Shore area was ongoing to provide necessary answers; and in the hope that someday, fish caught at the lake can be safe for human consumption. A meeting held by the EPA was not noticed to the Wahiawa community; therefore, a report on the flooding mitigation was not available. Community input was due to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by June 30, 2010 in order to receive this status report. A May 20, 2010 report in the local Wahiawa newspaper can be helpful as it covers the history on the waterways in the North Shore and Wahiawa districts. Questions, comments and concerns followed: 1) Lake Wilson – The upper area of the lake is currently under collaboration between the City and the Army. 2) R1 Water – It was not yet known if any of the water was going to be made available to Schofield Barracks. The Army was in consultation with contractors before it can accept any of the water; excess water will be provided to the farmers in the North Shore. Transportation – Joeseph Francher reported the following information: OMPO – A regional meeting is slated for August; public input is needed regarding the survey. State Department of Transportation – Repairs to bridges on Farrington Highway are underway including the Route 93 Bridge. DTS – The City is proposing to include the Waikiki Regional Plan to tie in with the Ala Moana Plan regarding the rail project. Input for this plan is due by Friday, June 25, 2010. Presentations: Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for Bethel Bible Church (BBC) – Elder William Hopper shared the following information: Location – BBC has been meeting at 1066 Kilani Avenue since 1978; a rental facility until the YMCA placed the facility up for sale in October 2004. God answers prayers sending Realtor Peter Savio which purchased the facility and the portion now occupied by the BBC was subdivided and sold to BBC. BBC continued to worship at this facility making necessary renovations preserving the buildings. Currently, there are no immediate occupying neighbors at this corner of Koa Street and Kilani Avenue. Fronting the building is the public park and tennis courts; at the Koa Street side, is a park ing lot; at the other side is the unfinished Park side at Wahiawa building project; and at the rear, is the Hawaiian Tel park ing lot. The building is now up for sale in the unfinished condition it is in. LUC – DPP required BBC to appear before the Board presenting the community with this request for the issuance of the LUC. A short recess was called at 8:15 to 8:20 p.m. to review documents. Questions, comments and concerns followed: 1) Congregation – There were about 75 current members at BBC. 2) Updates – Contractors may offer some progress update on behalf of the church once work begins; this presentation concludes that BBC has followed DPP procedures to fulfill their permit request. Application for Zoning Change on Kilani Property – Patrick Low reported the following information: Location – Currently at the 1044 Kilani Avenue was a bakery in the apartment building zoned as B2; however, the change proposes a change to zone A2 to reflect paying the lower tax rate of $3.55 versus $12.40 which is the current rate for zone B2. Building – No additional building will be added, the current building has received a good facelift. Please reach property manager Patrick Low at 282-313 or email at patlow@vine2.com. Office of Hawaiian Affairs Traditional Cultural Property Study – Kevin Chang reported the following information: Study Meeting – The public was urged to attend the meeting slated for July 22, 2010 beginning at 6:00 p.m. at Hale O Kipa. This meeting will entail researching plantation history to preserve the value of the area both past and present. It was hopeful that many will spread the word regarding the meeting to residents with known name in the history of Wahiawa to attend and share their knowledge. Development – No development is proposed at any site considering for the study; culture locations and preserving landscape will be the focus to define those areas. Questions, comments and concerns followed: Healing Stone – The stone was a separate issue; however, it may be part of the study definition. Several Hawaiian groups were involved in the upkeep of the healing stone site before it was moved. The site was becoming somewhat of a safety issue due to many visitors driving through to visit the healing stone site. Further study was needed to actually determine the factual decedents based under international law. It was told the stone was first moved in 1920; and in 1940 it ended up at the Wahiawa gravesite that was considered now sacred. Many have testified to have felt healed after contact with the stone. It’s rumored the stone has been returned to its original birth place. Board business: Wahiawa McDonalds Remodeling – Chair Acohido reported the following information: -Building – The Company has settled on keeping a country look with just one awing on one side of the building to facilitate rain drainage. This does comply with the Wahiawa Master Plan. -Tree – The Company also has promised to keep the 100 year old plant on its property. Regional Interest Regarding Homelessness – In Collaboration with North Shore Neighborhood Board No. 27: Chair Acohido reported the Board wishes to work with the North Shore Neighborhood Board on the homeless  issue affecting the districts. Announcements: Committee of the Whole Meeting – The next meeting tentatively scheduled for Monday, July 12, 2010 at 6:30 p.m. at Wahiawa Recreation Center. Regular Board Meeting – The next meeting is Monday, July 19, 2010 at 7:00 p.m. at Wahiawa Recreation Center. Fresh Water Park – The Park can be an economic engine for the district within the next 50 years; the project hopefully can be confirmed this November 2010. Adjournment: The meeting adjourned at 8:50 p.m. Submitted by Malia Chanel-Benjamin, Neighborhood Assistant Reviewed by Chair Ben Acohido 
 Texas Recruiting News: Longhorns Looking for a Few Good Men

In the spirit of “YOU WANT ANSWERS?!!” we’ll start with the news on Malcolm Brown’s impromptu unofficial visit to Austin, which was originally reported by Recruitocosm just after the San Antonio Express-News posted it on their website. What can I say, their hamsters are faster.

Malcolm Brown rolled up to the 40 with family in tow to get a vibe for the campus as a student and not the rock star treatment of one of the top two or three running backs in the nation. An admirable sentiment to be sure. But this isn’t Mack Brown’s first courtship and considering unofficial visits are like hitting green on a roulette table, Mack wanted to get the most bang for his buck.

With 7-on-7 workouts rescheduled, the staff had a few key players on hand to meet Brown and his family as our student-athletes are often the best salesmen and recruiters the program has—particularly the ones that have bought into the program enough to sacrifice their summer nights to prepare for the season.

Guys like Garret Gilbert, Jordan Hicks, Jackson Jeffcoat, the Achos, the Browns, Aaron Williams, etc. are even better recruiters than Mack Brown in this situation, because the Brown family was looking to drill down and truly get a feel for what’s in store for Malcolm when he’s on campus.

While the Brown family was drilling down, it appears that it’s the Longhorns who’ve struck oil. Word we received from our guy is that Brown told the staff he’s coming and it could be a matter of weeks if not days before he makes it official. After that, it’s up to the Longhorns to show some semblance of a between-the-tackles running game to keep the Browns happy. But for now, it looks like the blue chip running back drought is over for Texas.

 Jermauria Rasco says, “You’re a Lousy Fucking Softball Player Jack!!” 

While the news on Brown is great, the Jermauria Rasco news seems to be less so. In talking to a guy who’d know, the talented defensive end prospect out of Shreveport Evangel has grown concerned with the Longhorn depth chart.

“With guys like Jeffcoat, Wilson , Reed, and some of the bigger linebackers that can drop down to defensive end, Rasco is worried it would take him three years or so to see significant snaps,” our source said.

Why are depth charts suddenly a concern?

“It’s not coming from the Alabama people that’s for sure,” he explained.

“Bama has a chance to land two higher rated defensive ends and they tipped their hand about how they truly feel about Jermauria by playing him off the LOS during their camp. They wanted to show him they could get him snaps early regardless of how many D ends they had. Of course that backfired because Rasco was injured and the move ended up pissing him off.”

He added, “LSU offers Rasco a chance to play right away, and Coach Miles is going to do and say everything possible to land a talent like Rasco.”

Perhaps Phillip Geiggar can diffuse the situation with a couple well placed comments planted by Muschamp. Comments that make mention of Joseph Barksdale and Russell Sheppard and the pitch Miles used on them.

In any case, the Horns certainly have some work to do.

 Predictions On How the Horns Close—“He does think better with that bat!” 

 Malcolm Brown 
 Odds of Committing 100 percent up 1% percent from last week (“I’m sexually aroused by that commander”) 

Yes, we’re that good. We told you Brown was done deal at every turn. I wish we would have had a blog when we predicted the Jeffcoat, Hicks, Westerman, and Turner commitments before anyone else. Kudos to Sailor Ripley for coming down to Rucker park and pulling me out of retirement.

But now the Brown recruitment really gets interesting. We have to validate what we’ve been selling Pappa Brown. You coffee-is-for-closers guys know all about service after the sale. The product happens to be our running game.

Just give me between 4-5 yards per carry vs. UCLA, OU, and Nebraska and Brown will sign. No jet sweeps or reverses please. Coach Saban may be as ethical as Colonel Nathan Gessep, but he’s an X’s and O’s wizard who will point out any running game issues we have. And he has Pappa Brown’s ear.

 Jermauria Rasco 
 Odds of committing: 50 percent down from 60 percent. 

Texas needs to counter punch the depth chart question with combination of innovation and manhood challenging. Something along the lines of:

“Look, we plan on playing the best players and playing them in waves. You’ll get snaps. Unless of course you don’t think you can compete with a bunch of kids we recruited who were ranked lower than you by the services. Tell us now so we can give your ship to a placekicker.”

I think Rasco comes around because Texas can sell him on being the only pure defensive end they’re taking in this class since Reed is likely going to grow out of the position at some point.

 Aaron Green 
 Odds of Committing: 20 percent, down from 40 percent last week (Maybe, if we work at it, we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination.) 

With the impending commitment of Malcolm Brown and the hyper-interest the Texas staff has in 2012 super prospect Jonathan Gray, the odds of a Green commitment are becoming more of a pipe dream. The staff loves Green’s specialty skills but with the numbers as tight as they are, it would be tough to justify taking three running backs in this class. Especially if Seferian-Jenkins and Rasco decide to come.

 Austin SeferiaJenkins 
 Odds of Committing: Still 95 percent 

ASJ has basically recruited the Longhorns and the Longhorns reciprocated only after they figured the talented tight end from the state of Washington was completely serious about the 40 Acres and not the Yellow Rose. It would be a huge coup to grab the best tight end in the nation, along with the best O-lineman, arguably the best running back, and the best one or two defensive tackles.

 Anthony Wallace 
 Odds of Committing 10 percent down from 50 percent 

The odds are down from last week mostly because there’s a feeling with my sources that the staff has moved on for some reason and it doesn’t seem to have much to do with ability.

“The numbers are super tight already, and you’d hate to take a guy who’s not going to be an every down player. Wallace is a first and second down player especially in our league. He’s a very good one, but we feel like our resources are better spent on every down guys even if they’re a tick less talented,&quot; one source told us.

Another source I talked with, more of regional guy, claims that some schools have even backed off Wallace for some reason.

“If he’s not going to Texas then you would think other schools beside Oklahoma would step up and throw their hat in the ring but that hasn’t happened. Even A&amp;M seems to have backed off. Perhaps he’s a silent to Oklahoma or perhaps he waiting for a re-offer from UT, but it doesn’t seem like he’s a priority for the Ags. I haven’t heard any off the field rumors like grades or the sort, so who knows. It’s strange.”

 David Jenkins 
 Odds of Committing 25 percent 

Jenkins is every bit the cornerback prospect that was Charles Jackson, if not better. He’s faster than Jackson and he has a much better frame to fill out into a more physical player. Jenkins currently holds a conditional offer from the Texas staff if the numbers work out. It also helps that he plays a position of need for the Longhorns.

If there’s some attrition on the 85 man roster in the coming months or if the 2011 class doesn’t fill up like the coaches think, Jenkins might be fully offered. The coaches are certainly going to watch the talented DB this season and seal the deal if and when the time is right.

 2012 Prospects to Watch 

If you want to know “Who the fuck is PFC William P. Santiago” in terms of the 2012 cock-studs of recruiting, one of our man scouts/sources has compiled the following early list of the best player in the state at each position. It’s never too early to take a look at the class of 2012. Now these cats are only going to be juniors so there will be some changes. But right now these guys are doing it the most for us.

 DE Mario Edwards, Denton Ryan 

He’s only been playing football for a couple of years so he has a lot of upside. Very good strength and athletic enough to also play receiver for Prosper. Listed anywhere from 6’2” and 6’5”, but it’s always a good rule of thumb to trust the shorter. Better than any DE in this year’s class. Transferred to Denton Ryan where he’ll get better coaching and playing time against better competition. Ryan head coach Joey Florence is a Mack Brown guy.

 S LaDarrell McNeil, Dallas Smith 

This dude’s a witch. Four year starter at safety. The film below is from his freshman year. What stands out to me is his ability to mix it up despite being a bit undersized. Remember what Royal said about pups that bite?

 Young Pup. 

 OL Curtis Riser, DeSoto 

He’s better than Marcus Hutchins and Evan Washington although Washington might have a higher ceiling. Texas will be in the mix, and we’ll stay in the mix with any Desoto player as long as Claude Mathis is the head man there: quality guy, loves Mack.

 RB Jonathan Gray, Aledo 

Son of former Tech great James Gray. He reportedly likes Texas, and his dad likes OU. Does he like Texas enough to follow Malcolm Brown?

 WR Thomas Johnson, Dallas Skyline 

Transferred to ridiculously talented Skyline in the spring after playing QB for some private school in Arlington. Smart move. He’ll make the move to receiver for Skyline this fall. May have more big time offers than any junior to be in the state .

 LB Derek David, Rockdale 

Committed to Tech. Muschamp supposedly told the Rockdale coaches that David is the best linebacker he’s ever seen at that age. There are questions about his grades that Tech fans will say is nothing but sour grapes. Has a brother currently at Blinn who has already committed to Tech as well. Rule of thumb in sports, if you have two first names you better be a BAMF.

 DT Malcolm Brown, Brenham 

Better than anyone in the state not named Desmond Jackson. We always have a shot at a Brenham kid. So does A&amp;M and increasingly so does Tech.

 QB Matt Davis, Klein Forest 

A dual threat quarterback from the Houston area. Guess who he idolizes? Yeah, so did Russell Shephard. Get ready for much gnashing of the teeth. Alabama has already offered.

 CB Justin Thomas, West Orange Stark 

Perhaps a bit of a homer pick, but Stark puts out athletes on par with anyone in the state . He’s Earl’s cousin/brother/son so Texas will of course get a look, and he’s holding offers from most of the Big 12 South. Ran a 21.76 200m at the state meet and also ran on both of WOS’s gold medal sprint relays.

They don&apos;t need to trade starting pitcher Jonathan Sanchez (whose still got a 75 percent chance of being a productive big league winner) to get outfielder Corey Hart (who&apos;d come with 50-50 odds that his offensive numbers would diminish in the move from Milwaukee&apos;s cavernous Miller Park to San Francisco&apos;s cavernous AT&amp;T Park ).

Odds are far better than 50-50 that Pablo Sandoval will find himself at the plate. So, even while fans foolishly suggest the 23-year-old third baseman be sent to the minor leagues—there&apos;s a 70 percent chance that Sandoval will bump his power numbers up and move his batting average well past the .260 mark he&apos;s hovering around now.

There&apos;s a 50 percent chance Hart would go bust in San Francisco. There&apos;s a 70 percent chance that the real Sandoval is a guy who&apos;ll produce more than he did in the first half and less frequently than he did in 2009.

So the Giants will get the extra run production they need from Sandoval without trading Sanchez. And, the guys smoking dope in the Brewers front office who said they&apos;d take Madison Bumgarner can go back to their bong. Trade Bumgarner? Yeah, sure.

The Giants would be risking losing a productive pitcher in Sanchez and create a hole in the rotation to get Hart, who would come with a 50 percent chance his production would drop. Too much risk. No deal.

Sandoval&apos;s hit his entire career. He doesn&apos;t need to have MVP numbers to help produce more runs. He&apos;s only 23 years old. Why risk a disastrous trade for Hart if the Giants can wait for Sandoval? (Fans who want Pablo traded or demoted are in the Giants Fans Hall of Shame—along with those who booed Tim Lincecum when he struggled.)

Here&apos;s a look at the odds the Giants will get what they need most from the players they have:

The starting rotation has to be strong. It&apos;s absurd to expect all five starters to be lights out at the same time. There&apos;s a 100 percent chance that the Bumgarner we&apos;ve seen will be the lefty we see through September. Barry Zito&apos;s traditionally pitched better in the second half—so, there&apos;s a 75 percent chance that he&apos;ll bounce back to his early season form. Sanchez, in San Francisco, remains a question mark that the Giants can afford to carry. Give the guy 10 starts and he&apos;ll pitch well in more than six of them—so figure there&apos;s a 60 percent chance Sanchez will carry the load.

That leaves it to Tim Lincecum and Matt Cain to make sure that one or the other is the slump-buster, the guy the opposition knows is going to hand them an almost certain loss. There&apos;s a 95 percent chance that one or the other will be pitching like a big-time ace from now until September. However, there&apos;s a 30 percent chance that one or the other will struggle.

The key for the Giants rotation will get ace-like efforts from Cain or Lincecum—consistently.

The bullpen is one area the club has to bolster in trade. The Giants need a left-hander and they&apos;ll get one for, oh, a can&apos;t-miss prospect like righthander Tim Alderson. You remember Alderson? Yeah, the guy that the Pittsburgh Pirates demoted to the Class A Florida State League on Tuesday.

Brian Wilson &apos;s a sure bet to carry his load as the closer. He&apos;ll drive the Giants nuts making things too close for comfort, but there are 95-5 odds he&apos;ll do the job every time.

The rest of the bullpen? There&apos;s a 70 percent chance that it will be the reason that the Giants fall short of the playoffs. Keep in mind, though, that set-up men like Jeremy Affeldt get it together as quickly as they lose it. Something indicates that the veteran will pitch better down the stretch than he has so far—give Affeldt a 72 percent chance of regaining his 2010 form.

The offense?

Buster Posey&apos;s provided the big-time bat the Giants needed. He is who we thought he would be. There&apos;s no chance he&apos;ll hit an extended slump and, surprise, he&apos;s hitting for the power all the nabobs who spend too much time reading minor league scouting reports said he would never display.

Aubrey Huff&apos;s a pro—even if he produces 80 percent of the offense he produced in the first half, he&apos;ll bump up the offense because Juan Uribe is back and healthy and he&apos;ll make Huff more productive.

Travis Ishikawa has found his swing and could, mercifully, be a mid-20s talent who came up through the system. Based on how he&apos;s swinging, and his professional attitude, there&apos;s an 80 percent chance that Ishikawa will significantly help produce more runs.

No new hitters needed.

The chance that Uribe and Edgar Renteria both flop with the sticks in the stretch? Oh, 10 percent chance? Anything&apos;s possible. Freddy Sanchez is a professional hitter who is certain to hit through the season like he&apos;s hit his entire career—no chance he&apos;ll fail to produce.

Pat Burrell&apos;s going to be key. He&apos;s doing for the Giants what he did for the Philadelphia Phillies—hitting the longball and striking out a lot. Like it or not, though, the odds that Burrell could revert to the guy who couldn&apos;t make contact for Tampa Bay are higher than fans want to admit. Figure there&apos;s a 60 percent chance Burrell keeps doing the job.

The offense actually might live or die with Sandoval&apos;s resurgence and lead-off hitter Andres Torres. There is about, oh, a 66 percent chance that Torres will keep hitting around .275, with some pop and flashing stolen base speed. If the 34 percent odds pay off and he flounders—Aaron Rowand will be the Giants hope.

The odds Rowand gets Giants fans off his back? (Don&apos;t laugh...the guy works at his game.) 60-40...maybe 70-30. Keep in mind, it won&apos;t take much for Rowand to improve his output.

The defense is good enough to win.

There&apos;s a 100 percent chance the Giants won&apos;t trade a current starting pitcher, so that means there&apos;s 95 percent chance they won&apos;t trade for big-time hitter.

That&apos;s not terribly bad news, though. Fans have been calling for the club to develop talent and—the 2010 playoff hopes rest on Sandoval, Posey, Lincecum, Cain, Wilson , Jonathan Sanchez, and Bumgarner.

 Why We Will Never Be Europe

As I read more and more about what the NEA is funding, I come to a sobering realization of exactly why neither that agency nor any other will ever be able to replicate the great culture ministries and Arts councils of Europe.

As I read more and more about what the NEA is funding, I come to a sobering realization of exactly why neither that agency nor any other will ever be able to replicate the great culture ministries and Arts councils of Europe. While Americans still seem ok with the idea of public money going something that is educational and/or socially useful...they&apos;ll never get beyond letting their tax dollars being used for something that is simply great art .

It seems that the real growth areas of arts funding are in &quot;outreach,&quot; &quot;arts in education,&quot; and small-community activities. These are all important in themselves and necessary to a vibrant arts culture nationwide, I agree. But when that becomes the primary activity of our public arts funding, then the definition of &quot;public arts&quot; really changes, doesn&apos;t it.

In the US, &quot;public arts&quot; is not associated with the top of the field, the height of professionalism and training--as it is in countries with a &quot;royal academy&quot; or &quot;national theatre.&quot; As with so much in our Social Darwinist economy, public funding is for losers . Be it housing, transportation, or warehouse cheese, it is only there as pity/charity for those not able to make a buck in the marketplace on their own. In this country a grant is a &quot;handout,&quot; not an award or badge of pride.

So we are told, at least.

So while our larger professional nonprofit theatres still can count on some 10-20% from federal and state agencies...it is unimaginable that we&apos;ll ever see, for instance, the Public Theatre&apos;s Shakespeare in the Park production of The Merchant of Venice with one of our nation&apos;s leading actors entirely &quot;brought to you by&quot; the National Endowment for the Arts.

And yet that&apos;s exactly how it would happen in another country. There, the presentation of the best artists doing their best work in the repertoire they&apos;re world renown for is (again) a badge of honor, an act of diplomacy, a face to the world. But if the NEA or even our local NYSCA (New York State ) provided 100% (or even 75%) of the sponsorship for, say, a Lincoln Center Theatre production of an undisputed American Classic like Streetcar or Salesman or, better yet, something a commercial producer would never do, like the complete August Wilson cycle. Just imagine the hollering from the media and politicians about &quot;waste&quot; of public funds.

Instead we have a Time Warner or a Citicorp become the virtual culture ministry and boast sole &quot;sponsorship&quot; of an event or a season. Or we perform in theaters named American Airlines or after people who would be anonymous (Laura Pels? Peter Norton?) were it not for their superfluous millions.

Why splurge public funds upon artistic efforts that can get private funding on their own? To free them from patronage. At their best the European state theaters take advantage of public subsidy to be accountable to no one. (Hence why so many of their productions piss audiences off.)

At least, that&apos;s the theory. But it&apos;s one well worth chasing. 
 WonderWorks Between Education and Entertainment

 [details] [close] received 2 years ago  published 2 years ago  lang: en   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. – With summer vacation in full swing, parents and educators are singing the praises of WonderWorks – one of Pigeon Forge&apos;s premier vacation destinations. By combining fun, completely interactive zones with science, art and physical challenges, WonderWorks is a comprehensive learning experience where visitors&apos; imaginations can run wild.

WonderWorks, is an amusement park for the mind or an easier way to describe it is as an indoor theme park that opened in 2006 and has nearly 60,000 square feet of fun for all ages. Housed in an upside down building (you have to see it to be believe it), WonderWorks appears to have been ripped from its foundation and set back down on its roof. Beneath its fascinating exterior, WonderWorks features a myriad of hands-on learning experiences, demonstrations and activities utilizing some of the most sophisticated graphic and audio presentation techniques available.

&quot;Parents want to be involved in their child&apos;s education,” said Andrea Wilson , Ph.D., the educational manager at WonderWorks. &quot;Here at WonderWorks, the kids have a great time – and they make lasting memories with their family and friends – but it also influences their educational journey for the rest of their lives. They get more value here than they do from putt-putt or go-carts. Children leave this building with knowledge they didn&apos;t have when they walked in.”

Inside WonderWorks, guests find 120 interactive adventures that are divided into separate themed zones. The &quot;Challenge Zone” includes a rock climbing wall, physical and psychological endurance competitions and even a &quot;bed of nails” to lie on. In the &quot;Space Zone,” visitors are entertained with interactive, 3-D films about outer space plus a life-size re-creation of space suit they can try on for size, a Mercury Space Capsule, and simulators that allow guests to land the Discovery Space Shuttle as it glides in from outer space.

The museum aligns with a variety of state educational standards for educators&amp;students, and all lesson plans have multiple curriculum components. Students may participate in each exhibit on-site, but classroom discussion should follow each one individually. The lessons range from studying the Scientific Method and Newton&apos;s Laws to learning about sound energy and natural disasters. Below are examples of the exhibits at WonderWorks and the lessons for each:

* Mind Ball – Two people compete to see who can relax and clear their mind the fastest. Unlike most competitive situations where the focus on winning creates an anxious, adrenaline-driven state of mind, the new Mind Ball challenge reverses the expectations of those competing. You can&apos;t win at Mind Ball by desperately focusing on winning – you only win by relaxing your mind and focusing on as little as possible. At the Mind Ball challenge, students learn how alpha and theta waves affect their brains.

* Velocity Ball – The student will throw a ball at a screen between one and three times. The student chooses one of seven famous batters, and then attempts to throw the ball where the batter would hit. The screen will tell the student the success of their pitch and the speed; next, students will analyze the collective data. This individual exhibit teaches students about gravity, Newton&apos;s Laws, muscular system, push/pull, force and motion and measuring with non-standard units. Exhibits with similar lessons include &quot;How High Can You Jump?,” &quot;Rock Climbing Wall,” and &quot;Robotic Arms.”

* Pulley Seat – The student will try to pull him/herself up on each of the three pulley seats. It&apos;s important that the teacher point out to the students that the complexity of the process is variant upon the number of pulleys. Students then discuss: why some have an easier time pulling themselves up based on size or athletic ability; how much force must be exerted to pull yourself up, etc. This exhibit teaches about: simple machines, Newton&apos;s Laws, gravity, push/pull and force and motion. &quot;Air Cannons” is an exhibit with similar significance.

* Are You a Risk Taker? – The students will answer 20 true or false questions based on personal feelings or experiences. Next, they place their hand on a sensor and it will light up a category which they fall under based on their answers. The categories for risk are high, medium and low. They write down their level of risk and later discuss the collective data as a class. This exhibit teaches students: probability and central measures of tendency such as mean, median and mode, among other lessons. Similar exhibits include &quot;Safe Crackers,” &quot;One in a Million,” and &quot;What Are the Odds?”

* Space Weight – Students will step up on the scale and write down their weights for the Earth, Moon and Mars. Weight being identified at various places helps students understand that there are different places in the sky, but also that their body does not change but their weight does. The scale not only gives pound measurements, but students can elaborate this by converting to metric units once they are back in the classroom, and a graph can be made for collective weight in each location. This exercise teaches students about objects in space, gravity, measuring with non-standard units and planets. Similar exhibits include &quot;Cosmic Discovery,” &quot;Space Information Center,” and &quot;Space Update.”

* Floor Piano – Students have the opportunity to play &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” or &quot;Hush Little Baby.” The keys on the floor piano are labeled as per their musical name. To play the song, students must correctly match the note on the piano with the note name on the page. This is an extremely difficult task because stepping on the notes is not the origination of the sound, but the sensors as to proper body placement. The Floor Piano teaches that our ears process different sounds differently, and that it is difficult to play an actual piano. Sound energy is the main educational focus. Similar activities include &quot;Sound Labs” and &quot;Roaring Lion.”

* Quake Café – Students will ride in the Earthquake Café and experience a 6.0 level earthquake which can lead to an in-class discussion about the effects of natural disasters and their affect on the ground, buildings and erosion. This exhibit teaches students about safety procedures, natural disasters, Newton&apos;s Laws, and force and motion. Comparable lessons are taught in &quot;Hurricane Hole,” and &quot;Natural Disasters.”

Many WonderWorks exhibits feature data collection cards for individuals or classes to use. In addition, there are coloring sheets for those students who may be interested. There is also a WonderWorks Test and Scavenger Hunt worksheet to quiz the students on what they learn at the museum.

Richard Van Huss, the director of federal programs for Elizabethton City Schools, said, &quot;It is rare, in this day and time, to find a learning experience that is so entertaining for children.”

From an entertainment standpoint, WonderWorks is the #1 indoor attraction in Pigeon Forge. Every evening, WonderWorks comes to life with the &quot;Hoot N&apos; Holler” Dinner Show – one of the most popular shows in the Great Smoky Mountains. For years, visitors have enjoyed a fantastic three-course dinner with their family while experiencing the 90-minute performance featuring &quot;Scraps,” whose antics leave guests rolling in the aisles with laughter.

ValueVacation tickets to WonderWorks are available in a variety of packages that meet the needs of any size family. To learn more about WonderWorks, the Hoot N&apos;Holler Dinner Show and the new Wonders of Magic show featuring Terry Evanswood, visit www.WonderWorksTN.com or call 865-868-1800.

WonderWorks operates from 9 a.m. to midnight every day. We also operate in Orlando, Fla. and will open soon in Panama City, Fla. and Myrtle Beach, S.C.

He wasn&apos;t the only Republican awkwardly clarifying his positions: Rand Paul (taking a break from reading Edward Gibbon) says he doesn&apos;t want to put his electric fence underground and Sharron Angle insists she&apos;s not a birther. Happy Independence Day to the 74% of you who actually know what it is you&apos;re celebrating (and to the other 26%, too); we&apos;ll be back on Tuesday. This is HUFFPOST HILL for Friday, July 2nd, 2010 

 BREAKING: GHANA LOSES, AFRICA OUT OF WORLD CUP - That guy from Ghana who scored the winning goal against the U.S. had a penalty kick at the very end of overtime to win. It ricocheted off the crossbar, sending the game into a penalty shootout, where Uruguay emerged 5-3. It was perhaps the most crushing way a team has been eliminated in World Cup history.

@PElliottAP: JOHANNESBURG (AP) _ South African police officers say Paris Hilton was detained for possession of marijuana.

 MICHAEL STEELE SPEAKS TRUTH, GOP UPSET - So-very-confused-man Michael Steele is facing mounting criticism for saying that the war in Afghanistan is a fool&apos;s errand that is &quot;a war of Obama&apos;s choosing.&quot; &quot;Well, if he&apos;s such a student of history,&quot; Steele said of the president at a Connecticut fundraiser last night, &quot;has he not understood that, you know, that&apos;s the one thing you don&apos;t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who&apos;s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.&quot; Video: http://huff.to/c2iQAI

 Brian Beutler points out that last December Steele called the war a conflict &quot;we have to win.&quot; http://bit.ly/d5MXxE

 Steele has since &quot;clarified&quot; that he still wants the U.S. to succeed at what &quot;everyone who&apos;s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.&quot; Reid Wilson has the nonsensical walkback: &quot;There is no question that America must win the war on terror,&quot; Steele said. &quot;During the 2008 Presidential campaign, Barack Obama made clear his belief that we should not fight in Iraq, but instead concentrate on Afghanistan. Now, as President, he has indeed shifted his focus to this region. That means this is his strategy. And, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war.&quot; http://bit.ly/apycE5

Ever the opponent of sanity, Bill Kristol weighed in on Steele&apos;s comments, calling for his resignation in a letter to the RNC chairman : &quot;Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not &apos;a war of Obama&apos;s choosing,&apos;&quot; Kristol wrote. &quot;It has been prosecuted by the United State s under Presidents Bush and Obama. Republicans have consistently supported the effort. Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your state ment &apos;puts [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party.&apos;&quot; Sam Stein: http://huff.to/9ROLLu

 MITCH MCCONNELL WILL VOTE NO ON KAGAN - While the Senate Minority Leader&apos;s opposition to Elena Kagan&apos;s Supreme Court nomination almost certainly guarantees that most of his caucus will follow suit, political observers will be closely watching his party&apos;s few remaining moderates: Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and Scott Brown. Also under the microscope will be Judiciary Committee member Lindsey Graham, who voted for Justice Sonia Sotomayor&apos;s confirmation. http://nyti.ms/bvIYTP

 Orrin Hatch will also oppose the nomination - The Utah Republican and Judiciary Committee member, to no one&apos;s surprise, announced today that he CAN&apos;T STAND Elena Kagan&apos;s totally by-the-books career trajectory. Hatch also said he WILL NOT filibuster her nomination . &quot;Over nearly 25 years, General Kagan has endorsed, and praised those who endorse, an activist judicial philosophy,&quot; a state ment from his office read. &quot;I was surprised when she encouraged us at the hearing simply to discard or ignore certain parts of her record. I am unable to do that.&quot; http://huff.to/bvs6tM

So will Lisa Murkowski . http://bit.ly/bwrr8J

 TOMORROW&apos;S PAPERS TODAY - Washington Post : George Will on how if the U.S. Senate election in Nevada becomes a referendum on incumbent Harry Reid, Sharron Angle wins. If he makes it about some of her injudicious state ments -- e.g., &quot;transition out&quot; of Social Security -- the majority leader might survive.

 GOVERNMENT VIOLENCE IN PUERTO RICO - You wouldn&apos;t know it by reading the U.S. press, but a police riot broke out in San Juan Wednesday when student protesters attempted to enter the state house to deliver a message to the legislature protesting budget cuts. The public building was closed and police lined up to defend it, wading into the crowd, swinging batons and bashing heads. Mary Kay Henry, the new head of the Service Employees International Union, is one of the few speaking out. In a state ment today she said &quot;the intimidation of citizens appear[s] to be escalating on the island and no one is immune: journalists, gay men and women, our union brothers and sisters, and activists from every field who seek to make their voices heard and improve their lives and their communities. I am certain that many members of the U.S. media and many leaders in Washington are completely unaware of the disturbing events that took place Wednesday. I pledge that the more than 2.2 million members of SEIU, many of whom live in or were born in Puerto Rico, will change this by speaking out.&quot;

 DEMS, GOP READING SAME POLL - House Democrats gathered on yesterday to discuss the results of a national survey on the deficit and manufacturing that House Republicans were passing around late last week. Digging into the survey, which was paid for by the Alliance for American Manufacturing and done by Dem Mark Mellman and GOPer Whit Ayers, hints at an answer to why people are so passionate about the deficit: It&apos;s about jobs. Asking whether Congress should address the deficit or the jobless crisis, therefore, is the wrong question. Create jobs and the deficit concern goes away. Reading into the survey, you find that people relate the deficit to indebtedness to China and indebtedness to China is a proxy for American decline and the collapse of manufacturing, a huge concern among voters. About 45% of respondents said the biggest problem is that &quot;we are too deep in debt to China,&quot; the highest-ranking concern, 58% of folks said the U.S. is no longer the strongest economy, with China being the overwhelming alternative people identified. Three-quarters had an unfavorable view of goods made in China and 83% felt the same toward companies that set up shop there. The number one objection people had to China was the $2 trillion the country holds in U.S. debt. Asked how to improve the economy, the number one solution provided by voters was to &quot;crack down on foreign countries who violate their trade agreements with us.&quot; The survey: http://bit.ly/d4gv1F

BOEHNER LOVING THE BOEHNER V. OBAMA CARD - John Boehner&apos;s out with a new video quizzing Obama on why he&apos;s not better at being president. &quot;It&apos;s another example of us using the elevated platform Obama gave us to hit back and highlight his failed leadership and failed economic policies,&quot; says his spokesman. Boehner&apos;s suggestion: Cut spending. And do more to create jobs. Okay. Video: http://bit.ly/94PDyI

 ANTIWAR FORCES STRONGER - In June, 2009, Jim McGovern put forward an amendment requiring an exit strategy from Afghanistan. It lost 138-278. The same amendment lost 162-260 last night. And Democrats supportive of the war -- Blue Dogs and other swing-district folks -- are most likely to lose in November, so that base of war resistance is sturdy. And, of course, you can add Michael Steele to its ranks. The rest of the votes: Lee&apos;s withdrawal amendment: 100-321; an anonymous amendment to strike war funding altogether: 25-376. 

 Steny Hoyer will hit the road next week to shill for House candidates in Illinois, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Iowa .

 MARK ZANDI TO CONGRESS: Quit yer deficit ditherin&apos; and send help to the unemployed! &quot;The odds that the economy will slip back into the recession are still well below even, but if Congress is unable to provide this help, those odds will rise and become uncomfortably high,&quot; said the former McCain adviser. &quot;Paying for it should not be a necessary condition for passing it.&quot; From Arthur Delaney: http://huff.to/dkJAM6

 JUNE JOB REPORT SHOWS LACKLUSTER GROWTH - The nation let out a collective :-\ today with the release of a report from the Labor Department indicating the private sector added only 83,000 new jobs last month. Compounding observers&apos; concerns were the 125,000 jobs cut by employers, driven largely by the end of 225,000 temporary Census jobs. While the unemployment rate dropped from 9.7 percent to 9.5 percent, the decline is being attributed to the 650,000 individuals who left the job market altogether . http://huff.to/aceL7E

Arthur Delaney: &quot; Today&apos;s workforce is in worse shape than it was during the big recession of the early &apos;80s , when highly-unemployed younger workers comprised a much bigger share of all workers. If today&apos;s workforce had the same age composition as it did then, the unemployment rate would have been above 10 percent every month for the past year.&quot; http://huff.to/9PgHuD

 Nancy Pelosi : &quot;Today&apos;s jobs report sends a signal that our economy continues moving forward on the road to recovery, but we still have more work to do.&quot; http://bit.ly/9Mw7Mr

 John Boehner : &quot;Positive job growth in May is an encouraging sign, but it is disappointing that nearly all of those gains are temporary, taxpayer-funded government jobs through the U.S. Census. Stagnant private sector job growth is clearly cause for concern and evidence of the struggles small businesses continue to face.&quot; http://bit.ly/cX3phk

 SHARRON ANGLE: I AM NOT A BIRTHER - Took ya long enough. From an interview with Hot Air: &quot;Earlier today, I spoke exclusively to Sharron Angle, the Republican nominee to challenge Harry Reid for the Senate seat in Nevada. In the past few days, rumors have swirled that Angle is a crypto-Birther.

 RAND PAUL: WHAT UNDERGROUND FENCE??? - Sam Stein on the Kentucky Senate candidate&apos;s pet project which, apparently, isn&apos;t his? &quot;A spokesman for Rand Paul clarified on Friday that while his campaign website has long touted a proposal to build an underground electrical fence along the border to deter immigration, the Kentucky Republican Senate candidate himself has never endorsed that specific idea ...Rather, the fence he envisions would be constructed above ground while still carrying an electric current, explained [Paul spokesman] Benton. &apos;That&apos;s a stupid word that was put in by whoever is writing for our Web site and we need to remove it,&apos; Benton said, of the &apos;underground&apos; description.&quot; http://huff.to/bmDHU9

 Last night Paul said the current state of the economy mirrors the decline of the Roman Empire . &quot;In the latter days of Rome, the economy was crumbling, the emperor ... would placate the mob with bread and circus -- food and entertainment to placate them since the economy was in shambles and dwindling around them,&quot; he said at a Kentucky Tea Party rally yesterday. &quot;Now in our country, as our economy is in shambles, they give us Cash for Clunkers and a stimulus check and they tell us to go to the mall and spend your money and everything will be OK ... That&apos;s not how you become prosperous as an individual or a country,&quot; he told the crowd of supporters.&quot; ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED??? We sure are. Elyse Siegel: http://huff.to/djY9IV

The Nashville Predators have released the roster and schedule for their 2010 Development Camp, in which prospects and recent draftees work out under the eyes of the Preds&apos; hockey operations group and gets direction on what they need to do to take their next steps as professionals.

 Last year, the final day of camp featured a scrimmage and shootout competition that entertained the hundreds of fans who turned out at Centennial Sportsplex. I highly recommend getting out of the July heat and joining us in a look at the Predators&apos; future.

Follow after the jump for all the details, including expected appearances by Blake Geoffrion , Ryan Ellis , Colin Wilson , and 2010 1st-round draft pick Austin Watson ...
From the Preds: 
The Nashville Predators will have many of their top prospects in town next week when they officially open their 2010 Developmental Camp on Tuesday, July 6 at Centennial Sportsplex at 7 a.m. with fitness testing. Players will be available to the media on Tuesday between 10 a.m.-12 p.m. at the Sportsplex as they work through testing stations. The camp continues through Sunday, July 11 with the first of four on-ice sessions coming at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, July 7.

   The purpose of the camp is to educate and direct players in their pro development and conditioning programs, and the week&apos;s events will be presided over by the Predators coaching staff. Strength and Conditioning Coach David Good will lead the scheduled training regimen, which includes a variety of dry-land activities and workouts, on-ice fundamentals work, off-ice testing and team-building activities. The players will also receive instruction on training principles such as sport-specific power and strength enhancement, flexibility and off-ice conditioning. 

Coaches and members of the Predators&apos; player development/scouting staff will be assisted by Director of Player Development Martin Gelinas, Milwaukee Admirals (AHL affiliate) head coach Lane Lambert and assistant coach Ian Herbers.

Each of the club&apos;s first or second-round selections from the past five drafts will be in attendance, including 2010 first-rounder Austin Watson and four of the other five prospects selected in last weekend&apos;s draft.

All on-ice workouts at Centennial Sportsplex are open to the public. On-ice sessions are currently scheduled for:

           Wednesday, July 7                                   10:00 a.m.-12:00 a.m.

           Thursday, July 8                                       10:00 a.m.-12:00 a.m.

           Saturday, July 10                                      10:45 a.m.-12:45 a.m.

           Sunday, July 11                                        2 p.m.-4 p.m.

The preliminary roster of attending players is below and a development camp schedule is attached. Please note that players will be available for interviews after the events/activities take place; please contact the Nashville Predators Communications Department for more information on specific events/activities. Both the schedule and roster are subject to change.

 The Idols get their first look at the tour set 

When the top 10 for American Idol’s season 9 arrived at the Palace in Auburn Hills to start tour rehearsals this past weekend, the people in charge of the production took them into the arena via one of the entrances the audience will use tonight, as the American Idols Live tour launches in Detroit, Mich.

“We were at the very back of the arena,” Tim Urban says. “We were looking dosn from as far away from the stage as you could get.”

 Lee DeWyze: ‘There’s going to be bras flying through the air’ 

The American Idols Live tour starts Thursday night in Detroit, Mich. But when the 10 Idol finalists take to the road, they’ll be on two buses — one for the four women and one for the six men.

“The girls’ bus will be much cleaner and smell a lot nicer,” claims Katie Stevens.

Lee DeWyze says he’s willing to debate that point.

 Crystal Bowersox kicks into high gear for ‘Idol Live’ 

Crystal Bowersox is pulling double duty this summer.

While performing on the “American Idols Live!” tour, which kicks off tonight at The Palace of Auburn Hills, she’ll also be recording her debut album, which will arrive around Thanksgiving.

On “Idol,” the rootsy rocker — part Janis Joplin, part Melissa Etheridge — was a favorite to win the season, right up until she lost to bashful paint salesman Lee DeWyze in the May 26 finale. But on “Idol,” even the losers are winners; and last week, Bowersox inked a recording deal with 19 Recordings/Jive Records.

 ‘American Idols Live’ comes to Grand Rapids this weekend 

GRAND RAPIDS — Casey James doesn’t take anything for granted.

The 28-year-old, who will roll through town Saturday night along with his other “American Idol” season nine Top 10 compadres, including winner Lee DeWyze, knows it can all be gone in a second, and he’s not talking about something as fleeting as fame.

Seven years ago, the Cool, Texas native was rounding a corner on his motorcycle when he realized in a flash that he was about to be killed.

 Casey James: ‘You have to amplify everything’ 

Even though the first concert of the American Idols Live tour isn’t until tonight, playing a big stage in a big hall like Michigan’s The Palace of Auburn Hills is already changing the way Casey James performs.

Seeing the show’s video introductions and watching the other performers’ rehearsals from the back of the hall really made an impression on Casey. “You try to think about how you’re going to be seen and taken from that view and use that in your performance,” he says. “I had them record my set, then I went back and watched it. You immediately start thinking about that stuff when you walk in and see it.”

 Katie Stevens looks ahead to home- state show 

Katie Stevens is eager to start the American Idols Live tour tonight.

“I can’t even picture all those seats with people in them,” she said before Wednesday night’s dress rehearsal.

But Katie’s especially excited about performing in her home state of Connecticut in a couple weeks, when the tour stops at the Mohegan Sun Arena, where she’s seen a lot of concerts from the audience perspective.

 ‘SYTYCD’ Top 9: Alex&amp;tWitch Make Hip Hop/Ballet History 

Wow. We caught up with Alex moments after his big moment and with his heart still racing he told us, “I didn’t think I could do it. I’m overwhelmed that I got that feedback…I feel like I got lucky.” And how about that standing ovation? “Crazy. Crazy. There aren’t even words to describe it. Just crazy,” he beamed.

Needless to say, tWitch was super proud of his partner. “I’ve never seen a ballet dancer do hip-hop to that magnitude,” tWitch told us post-performance. “It was just a matter of getting out of your mind and going for blood.”

tWitch too said the response was “overwhelming” and that “it was one of my favorite performances ever because it was my first time dancing with a ballet dancer and I think it was his first time dancing with a hip hop dancer so we made history for each other. He definitely held his own as a hip hop dancer. Alex has swag for days.”

 Marco Benevento: Music Is Still Secret

By: Ron Hart Marco by Michael Benevento Few musicians have defined the state of piano jazz in the 21st century quite like Marco Benevento. Whether alongside longtime partner drummer Joe Russo as the Benevento/Russo Duo, as the leader of his own trio with bassist Reed Mathis and drummer Andrew Barr or playing in such groups as Garage A Trois or, most recently, as the new member of The Slip spinoff Surprise Me Mr. Davis, this 32-year-old native of North Jersey enjoys an ample playing field by wh ...

 Marco by Michael Benevento 
Few musicians have defined the state of piano jazz in the 21st century quite like Marco Benevento . Whether alongside longtime partner drummer Joe Russo as the Benevento/Russo Duo , as the leader of his own trio with bassist Reed Mathis and drummer Andrew Barr or playing in such groups as Garage A Trois or, most recently, as the new member of The Slip spinoff Surprise Me Mr. Davis , this 32-year-old native of North Jersey enjoys an ample playing field by which to manipulate is uncanny arsenal of analog and digital keyboards.
 Between The Needles and Nightfall is Benevento&apos;s third solo album in three years, and stands tall as the finest work he has created under his own name to date. Recorded at Trout Recording in the artist&apos;s adopted home of Brooklyn, NY, Between The Needles was helmed by an ad-hoc crew of prominent studio wizards - Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Swans, Ramones, Luna), Mell Dettmer (Sunn O))), Eyvind Kang), Jesse Lauter (Low Anthem, Elvis Perkins) and Vid Cousins (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala) - each of whom helped Benevento to successfully envision his fusion of electro-enhanced major-chord jazz for baby grand piano treated by a cornucopia of guitar pick-ups, effects pedals and found toys.

Currently Benevento is in the midst of a whirlwind summer tour that includes dates with Surprise Me Mr. Davis in the Pacific Northwest, a pair of NY area gigs with Garage A Trois (as well as an appearance at this year&apos;s Outside Lands Festival), and two exciting shows for the Celebrate Brooklyn! Concert Series in Prospect Park , including playing a key role in the performance of Miles Davis&apos; 1969 voodoo classic Bitches Brew alongside such city jazz greats as James Blood Ulmer, DJ Logic, Lonnie Plaxico, Cindy Blackman and the Mike Stern Band in late June and an August date that finds his trio performing a live score to Roger Corman&apos;s 1960 horror classic The House of Usher . However, Mr. B was kind enough to take a few minutes out of his busy schedule to talk with JamBase about the making of Between The Needles and Nightfall , joining Surprise Me, covering Amy Winehouse, and skateboarding to Men At Work.

 JamBase: How does it feel to be one-fifth of a traditional rock band like Surprise Me Mr. Davis as opposed to being the leader of your own group like your trio? 

Marco Benevento: It&apos;s great. I love playing the role of being just the keyboardist in a band, trying to come up with just cool, simple parts for a song. Not having to be the leader definitely is a pretty nice relief. JamBase: How democratic is SMMD in terms of creating the music? 

Marco Benevento: Everyone pitches in and has their voices heard, but primarily Nathan [Moore] and Brad [Barr] do most of the writing.

 How long have you known the guys in The Slip? 

Man, I&apos;ve known those guys and jammed with them since &apos;95.

 Do you have a favorite memory of jamming with the Barrs prior to joining Surprise Me Mr. Davis? 

One time we were out on tour and we got stuck in a snowstorm in Flagstaff, Arizona. We got snowed in at our friend Brooke&apos;s place and we just played music in this A-frame house until the sun came up. That was in February or March of 2000. It was really fun.

 Between The Needles and Nightfall is a very big-sounding record, with a lot of major chords and huge pop melodies, particularly for the baby grand piano. What inspired you to go in this direction? 

 Benevento by Mike DiDonna 
I think just years of figuring it out; years of playing and touring and finally opening up the bottle that&apos;s been shaken up. I&apos;ve always wanted to play with a bass player and a drummer, and I always wanted to sit behind the piano and try to do more piano stuff. Over the last three years and over the last three records, I&apos;ve been getting a lot better at ProTools, working in the studio in my house, and composing, of course. It all cumulated to this point of a healthy blend of rock and jazz and big beats and quieter songs. Even Reed Mathis, the bass player, said that this was his favorite trio record that we&apos;ve made.
 What albums were you listening to at the time of recording Between The Needles and Nightfall ? 

I was listening to this record called Flow Motion by the group Can. That record I was really digging a lot. That record has a lot of songs that are built from loops. I was also listening to a lot of relentless, groove-oriented songs where it starts and you immediately like it and it has a nice tempo and you&apos;re bouncing with it and barely noticing what&apos;s going by. That was what I felt I did on a couple of the tracks on this new album. I just got into this [mindset of] &quot;let the music play&quot; and don&apos;t worry about a studio cut or worry about making it sound tight, just play it. There were a lot of free-for-alls on this record. There are a lot of newer bands like Grizzly Bear that I&apos;ve been digging lately. I&apos;m still very much tried and true with The Beatles as well. You always notice something new with The Beatles every year it seems. I&apos;m a big fan of The Black Keys; I like Dan Auerbach, the guitarist, a lot. And the guys and me, we&apos;ve been listening to a lot of Men At Work lately as well. I grew up in that timeframe. I was born in 1977, so I did a lot of skateboarding and listening to Men At Work on my Walkman while I skated. And Herbie Hancock as well; &quot;Rockit&quot; [with] that Linn drum sound always did it for me. I&apos;ve also been listening to more electronic bands lately as well, like this band called Chromeo. They&apos;re pretty cool. I like LCD Soundsystem a bit. Squarepusher blows me away, but that&apos;s sort of a given I guess. He&apos;s a big name around everybody. But I could still afford to be turned onto more electronic music, though.

 Following up on your 2009 LP of covers, Me Not Me , you chose to take on only one interpretation of someone else&apos;s work for Between The Needles and Nightfall . What made you go with Amy Winehouse&apos;s &quot;You Know I&apos;m No Good&quot;? 

I just love the tune, man; I love the soul of it. I&apos;m a big fan of a lot of the Motown stuff and Ray Charles and Wilson Pickett and Little Richard, and I feel like the song stems from that trajectory. Amy&apos;s got a great voice. I really like her voice a lot, and it lends itself to the piano really fantastically. It&apos;s really easy to play; it almost sounds like a Duke Ellington/Medeski, Martin and Wood kind of hybrid. Playing it live is a real treat, too. People really get into it.

 Of all the covers you have done over the years, which one was the most difficult one to get right? 

Well, you know, they all make me work to get it right - from the simplest ones to the hardest ones. But I&apos;d say one of the more involved covers that we play is &quot;Seems So Long Ago, Nancy&quot; by Leonard Cohen. There&apos;s a lot of changes and there&apos;s a lot of chords in it. And we play it in more of a jazz type feel where I improvise over the changes and stuff. That&apos;s the one that is still hard to this day even though we&apos;ve been playing it for like ten years.

 How did you come up with the idea of rigging your baby grand with guitar pickups? 

 Benevento by Rob Chapman 
I just had one in my house from a tour, and they sorta sucked for guitars so we never used them onstage. I had one lying around and was planning for a piano trio tour and thinking, &quot;Oh good, I could just fly and play pianos and that&apos;s it.&quot; And I thought about how all these demos that I had been making had reverb and effects on the piano and was wondering how I was going to do that for the stage. So, I stuck that guitar pickup on the inside of the piano and ran it into the amp that I have and it was that simple. Then I was like, &quot;Okay, I can put distortion pedals and all these things in between before it gets to the amp.&quot; For the last three years I&apos;ve been trying to dial that in. It&apos;s a hard thing to do. It&apos;s an acoustic instrument and it&apos;s pretty wild with loud drums right next to it. But at the same time, it&apos;s a really attractive thing. What&apos;s really nice is running the piano through tremolo, especially on this amp that I have. It&apos;s this really nice old amp that has a tremolo on it that&apos;s like buttah.
 You are going to be scoring a screening of House of Usher at the Prospect Park bandshell in Brooklyn later this summer. How are you going to go about it? 

I&apos;m going to go wherever the film takes me. I&apos;m also going to see if there are any original songs that I&apos;ve already written that could work in there and maybe even use Between The Needles and Nightfall as a soundtrack to the movie if I could. It would be pretty fun to try to dial some of that stuff into it. I&apos;ve also been writing new music for it and setting up sound effects and whatnot.

 You just performed Bitches Brew with that phenomenal supergroup in Prospect Park recently. Did you play the role of Joe Zawinul or Chick Corea? 

I actually tried to do both. There was only one keyboardist so I had to make it sound like two or three. Nevertheless, to be amongst those incredible musicians was a true honor.

 Every week, Historicist looks back at the events, places, and characters—good and bad—that have shaped Toronto into the city we know today. 
 
 Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau utters three famous words while questioned by CBC reporter Tim Ralfe three days before the enactment of the War Measures Act in October 1970. CBC Archives. 
Watch him we did...

The revelation that the Ontario government quietly invoked the Public Works Protection Act earlier this week to provide law enforcement with freer rein to question and arrest anyone venturing toward the protected zones around the G20 summit and protests has led some civilians to reflect on past instances where civil liberties were temporarily suspended in the name of public security. One of the most powerful weapons in the federal government’s arsenal was the War Measures Act, which was invoked three times (two of which were for World Wars) between 1914 and 1970. Though its final usage mostly affected Quebec in the wake of the kidnapping of British diplomat James Cross and Quebec Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte by the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) in October 1970, Toronto was not immune from arrests, debates, and protests during the October Crisis .
 
 Headline, the Globe and Mail , October 17, 1970. 
After the federal government invoked the act without parliamentary debate on October 16 , Toronto’s evening newspapers swung into multiple-edition mode. Each successive copy of that night’s Star and Telegram featured the day’s debates in Ottawa and at Queen’s Park , along with the evolving responses of local law enforcement officials. Early editorials backed parts of the act that were absolutely necessary to maintain calm and curb the FLQ and wished for a speedy revocation. While all of the papers expressed reservations about rights suspension, the Star was the most critical in its views, as it believed that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau should have gone to the House of Commons first and provided a full explanation as to why his tactics suddenly changed from strict negotiations over the release of the hostages to bringing in the act. The general reservations among local media were summed up at the end of the Globe and Mail &apos;s editorial the following day: &quot;It will be up to the government now to prove that it invoked the War Measures Act in order to eliminate a gang of terrorists and not to destroy its political enemies.&quot;

At Queen’s Park , Ontario Premier John Robarts was quickly provided with round-the-clock guard in the wake of state ments from a group of prominent Quebeckers that urged him to keep his nose out of Quebec’s affairs after he commented that the FLQ was a national concern. Robarts indicated that he had been consulted before the act was imposed and, while conceding its powers could be harmful if misused, felt full confidence in the federal government. On the opposition benches, the Liberals raised no fuss, while NDP leader Stephen Lewis felt the act was unnecessary unless Trudeau could prove that an armed insurrection was imminent and asked for daily reports on any arrests that were made in the province. Ontario Attorney General Arthur Wishart refused any comment until it was clear what, if any, responsibilities local police forces and the OPP had to enforce the emergency measures.
 
 Protesters demonstrating against the War Measures Act at Nathan Phillips Square on October 17, 1970. The Telegram , October 19, 1970. 
Civil liberties activists quickly mobilized against the act, the provisions of which allowed police to search homes without a warrant and hold suspects for up to ninety days. A group of lawyers under the banner of the Law Union organized a rally at noon on October 17 to protest the act. Around six hundred protesters showed up to listen to speakers like Clayton Ruby decry the federal government for overreacting and turning Canada into &quot;an automatic police state .&quot; More anti-act rallies and debates were in the offing...until bulletins that night reported the murder of Laporte.

The news proved an irritant to the several hundred viewers of a World War II drama on CBLT who flooded the station with angry calls. Showing little awareness of the situation at hand, some of those callers expressed their displeasure with the interruption of the movie by threatening to bomb the station. As far as we can tell, nobody was arrested for being an idiot—in this case.

Far more appropriate was the response of football fans the next day at CNE Stadium, where the sold-out crowd observed a moment of silence. Before the Argonauts and Montreal Alouettes took the field, announcer Ken Foss told the spectators that &quot;without going into any formal details, we would ask you to sing our national anthem louder than you’ve ever sung it before.&quot; The crowd respected his request then watched the Argos go on to a 16–13 victory.

Two reporters from Montreal covering the game were among the handful of people arrested by the RCMP for questioning due to suspicion of FLQ connections. Taken into custody that night was American army deserter and social worker Christopher Ewing, whose past as an army demolition expert and time spent in Montreal before moving to Toronto raised eyebrows. Ewing’s lawyers were prepared to mount a constitutional challenge, but he was released after eighteen hours.
 
 Cartoon by John Yardley-Jones , the Telegram , October 19, 1970. 
Local leaders voiced their outrage and disbelief at Laporte’s fate as flags flew at half-mast across the city. Stephen Lewis was grasping for words to express his shock. &quot;You’re not dealing with revolutionaries in a classical sense—you’re dealing with psychopaths...Pierre Laporte is dead and how now does one speak of it?&quot; Toronto Mayor William Dennison hoped that Canadians would &quot;react with determination to show the FLQ, the murderers, the anti-social groups and those who associate with them, that no country can tolerate them.&quot; In the eyes of typical Trudeau opponents, like the editorial writers of the Telegram , the Prime Minister suddenly became a leader who understood when firm, decisive action was required.

At York University, students sent telegrams to Trudeau and Quebec premier Robert Bourassa:
 We as Canadian university students wish to show our faith in a united Canada. We have confidence in the ability of the federal and Quebec governments in this crisis and wish to express our very grave concern with the action that the government was forced to take. 
A rally on October 19 to show support for the government drew two thousand York students outside the Ross building. Most of the speakers delivered praise, but some, including historian J. L. Granatstein , offered cautionary notes:
 In my memory I was the only one to oppose the government’s actions forthrightly. I cannot remember my exact words, but I suggested that the imposition of the War Measures Act was a direct attack on the civil liberties of all Canadians, that it was using a mallet to kill a flea, and that, under its terms, not only the (FLQ) terrorists but activists, hippies, Vietnam draft dodgers, and troublemakers could be arrested anywhere in Canada...I have never before or since been afraid of a crowd, never feared being torn limb from limb, but that day I was frightened. The shouts from the students that interrupted my speech were frequent and hostile; the visceral hatred of the FLQ kidnappers and murderers, and, as I interpreted it, of all Quebecois, was palpable. I was very pleased to get off that platform and into my office before I was attacked and beaten. 
Years later, Granatstein’s views toward the War Measures Act were closer with those who jeered him that day.

While there wasn’t a mass rally at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute, several of its students went to Nathan Phillips Square the same day to shout down anti–War Measures Act demonstrators from Rochdale College. Clad in school jackets, the Ryerson contingent waved flags and pictures of Trudeau while calling out points made by the Rochdalians in back-and-forth volleys that, when reading the account in the Globe and Mail , sound like an argument between primary school pupils (including cries for the Rochdalians to take a bath, names like &quot;white honky&quot; tossed around, comparisons to abortions, and debates as to time protesters spent in Quebec).

Right: The memorial service for Pierre Laporte the following day. Photo by Bruce Reed. Both pictures from the Telegram , October 20, 1970. 
The scene at Nathan Phillips Square was more solemn on October 20 when two thousand people paid their respects at a service for Laporte. Among the attendees was Betty Brown of Willowdale, who told the Telegram that &quot;I’m an old lady and I just came to pay my respects. It somehow seems more appropriate than going alone to my church.&quot; In churches around the city, services ranged from sermons to a ten-hour peace vigil at Adath Israel Synagogue in Downsview. Trustees from local school boards proposed naming a school in honour of Laporte, which came to pass when Pierre Laporte Middle School opened on Wilson Avenue three years later. York Mills Collegiate Institute created a memorial scholarship to allow up to four students go on exchange with a Quebec high school.

Over the month that the War Measures Act remained in effect, most incidents related to it in Toronto were either debates or problems with the printing and distribution of publications that included FLQ manifestos, as the Varsity discovered in early November. When the paper’s printer refused to touch one offending article, the editors replaced it with a photo of gagged man with &quot;censored&quot; written across the tape, captioned &quot;guess what folks.&quot; On a visit to Oakwood Collegiate around that time, federal Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield was confronted by a student who felt Stanfield’s initial questioning of the act hadn’t helped the country. Stanfield admitted he was a &quot;little disturbed&quot; by the depths of the lack of regard for civil rights suspended by the act. The editorial staff of the Don Mills Mirror were similarly troubled after constituents at a mid-November community meeting held by MP Robert Stanbury (Liberal, York-Scarborough) wished to have the act in effect permanently to lock up anyone they didn’t like, such as draft dodgers:
 They have apparently not considered Stanbury’s argument: that having stopped one idea at the border, where do you draw the line? They haven’t recognized that in trying to avert one threat to Canada, they themselves may be becoming an even greater threat. If they destroy freedom of speech and ideas, there won’t be much left to distinguish Canada as one of the best of the world’s democracies.

 A federal magistrate has ruled that the depositions of Mayor Mark Boughton and state Sen. Michael McLachlan as part of the Danbury 11 civil rights lawsuit will go forward.

The decision by Magistrate Donna Martinez Wednesday state s that the city did not make &quot;the requisite legal showing&quot; necessary to delay the depositions until after the fall election.

[...]

The response the plaintiffs filed late last week to the city&apos;s request for a delay state d that prior depositions in the case by federal agents indicated that Boughton &quot;put pressure&quot; on the city&apos;s police department to do something about the day laborers at Kennedy Park .

The plaintiffs also state d in their response that despite claims by Boughton that the city did not order the raid, agents said they became involved only after several requests were made by the city.

[...]

Joel Wilson , a partner with the Gibson, Dunn,&amp;Crutcher law firm that is providing pro bono services to the day laborers, said his clients were happy with the court&apos;s decision Wednesday that allows the depositions to proceed.

&quot;Our clients are gratified that the court swiftly denied the defendants motion to further delay the case and look forward to deposing Mayor Boughton and Senator McLachlan about their involvement in the events underlying this important civil rights action,&quot; Wilson said.

McLachlan is scheduled to be deposed on Friday, while Boughton&apos;s deposition is scheduled for Wednesday. 
The last of Boughton&apos;s stalling tactics have failed and close to four years, the mayor will have to testify UNDER OATH and answer for the state ments he made to the press when he state d that the city of Danbury placed NO PART in the raid (something he repeatedly claimed from the time of the arrest (Sept 2006) until it was discovered that DanburyPD drive the van that picked up the eleven day laborers (aprox. 10 months later)).

Plus: the 1966 World Cup seating crisis; Mistaken identities; and the smallest World Cup host city. Send your questions and answers to knowledge@guardian.co.uk 

 &quot;Rob Green&apos;s howler against the USA got me thinking,&quot; writes Pete Bailey. &quot;Which player has had the most error-strewn World Cup?&quot; 

Step forward the hapless Pierre Issa. The South Africa defender did not enjoy the most auspicious tournament in 1998. In the first game against France he scored two own-goals and missed his side&apos;s only clearcut chance at the other end and in Bafana Bafana&apos;s final group game against Saudi Arabia he conceded two penalties. Issa, however, protested his innocence: &quot;For the first penalty I didn&apos;t touch the Saudi and on the second our arms and legs entwined and we fell over together.&quot;

The misery didn&apos;t stop there for Issa. He joined Watford in 2001 and in one of his meagre 15 games for the club he was carried off the field on a stretcher only to be dropped by the medical team .

The South Korean goalkeeper Hong Duk-yung is another contender. Hong conceded 16 goals in two games at the 1954 tournament – a 7-0 defeat to Turkey had been preceeded by a 9-0 loss to Hungary – though quite how many of those were down to goalkeeping incompetence is open to question.

EDGE OF THEIR SEATS

 &quot;Fifa is apparently going to investigate the number of empty seats at games in South Africa,&quot; writes Sam Hale. &quot;Is this the first World Cup seating crisis?&quot; 

Not quite, no. In 1966 hundreds of tickets were sold for Row I at Roker Park , Sunderland, which was due to host matches between Italy, Chile and the Soviet Union. One eagle-eyed fan, 70-year-old William Smith, on arriving at the ground to check out his viewpoint prior to the tournament was surprised to see rows H and J, but no I.

A letter followed, as was the style at the time, and the Roker Park doyens quickly had to call the painters in to reletter the rows.

MISTAKEN IDENTITY

 &quot;The North Koreans naming a striker as their third goalkeeper got me thinking of the possibility of them attempting to sneak him on to the pitch at some stage,&quot; writes Iain Peyton. &quot;Have there been any cases of mistaken identity in previous World Cups?&quot; 

We&apos;re not aware of any such incidents on the pitch, but in 1966 the Guardian reported a case of mistaken identity elsewhere at the tournament:
 &quot;Two men from the Central Office of Information were lurking round the corridors of the Mexican team&apos;s hotel in Finsbury Park yesterday hoping to get some film of the players relaxing. Each time a swarthy-looking individual with a toothbrush moustache went by, the cameras whirred. Just in case.

&quot;After three hours of inactivity they were in a somewhat despondent state . They had got pictures of the team eating their lunch; at least they guessed it was the team as none of them spoke English. &apos;In the end,&apos; said the taller of the COI men, &apos;we went out into the street and photographed what we thought were some more players.&apos; They turned out to be Swiss tourists. 
And in 1970, with the teams playing in the opening game expected to line up in the Mexican heat for the 30-minute duration of the opening ceremony, the Soviet Union side cleverly protected their first XI by sending their reserves in to do the honours at the Azteca. 

KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE

&quot; According to my chums at Daejeon World Cup Stadium, the population of fellow host Seogwipo stands at a mere 85,000,&quot; wrote Martin Zatko during the 2002 tournament. &quot;Does this make the Jeju Island community the tiniest host town in World Cup history?&quot; 

Sadly it doesn&apos;t, Martin. As Thomas Paternoster and others point out, Seogwipo is beaten hands down by Lens, which hosted several World Cup games (including Germany v Croatia) in France 98.

As was doubtless brought up billions of times by Des Lynam and co at the time, Lens is famous for having more seats in their 40,000-capacity Stade Felix-Bollaert than residents (30,000) in the town itself.

However, Lens might itself not be the smallest; several World Cup matches in Sweden 1958 were played in the small industrial towns of Uddevalla and Sandviken. As Peter Liljenberg points out: &quot;It is difficult to find exact numbers on the population of the towns themselves, since Sweden is organised around counties. However, both Uddevalla and Sandviken county had about 40,000 inhabitants overall in 1958.

Modern statistics on Uddevalla show that about 60% of the inhabitants live in the town itself, so transposing those numbers to 1958 yields a population of about 25,000. Sandviken is a bit more dominating at 75% of the inhabitants in the county, so let&apos;s settle on Uddevalla being a likely candidate to being the smallest World Cup host town.&quot;

Daniel Wilson , meanwhile, suggests that Lugano might be the smallest-ever town to hold a World Cup finals match, as its population is currently 29,000 and &quot;would almost certainly have been lower in 1954&quot;.

It certainly was, Daniel. Paul Joyce says: &quot;I found on my bookshelves an ancient book called The Motoring Guide to Switzerland, which has no publication date but which gives the 1953 population figures for Swiss cantons. It also lists population figures for Swiss towns and villages which I assume must also come from 1953.

According to this book, Lugano had a population of 18,400 in 1953, way behind the other cities in the tournament (Basel 187,800, Bern 154,000, Geneva 154,300, Lausanne 110,800, Zurich 413,617).

&quot;In the game between Brazil and North Korea at one stage it seemed that the Koreans were about to substitute No4, Pak Nam-chol with No14, er, Pak Nam-chol,&quot; notes Jerry Forster. &quot;Have there ever been any incidents of a substituted player having exactly the same name as his replacement?&quot;

&quot;If England win the World Cup and Michael Dawson does not play in the tournament, would he be the first player to win the World Cup without being capped?&quot; ponders Danny from Belfast.

&quot;When I was a child (I&apos;m reasonably sure it was 1986) I remember hearing on the telly that a World Cup game – which might have involved Mexico – had ended with a total of 90 fouls,&quot; recalls Giovani Pisoni. &quot;That total sounds ridiculous today and I&apos;ve never heard a similar one since but I still trust my childhood memory. Is there any record of the number of fouls during World Cup games and if so, did my hopefully-not-imaginary tie actually take place.&quot;

&quot;This query has been building inside me for some time,&quot; erupts Dave Stewart. &quot;Since around France 98 my friends and I have constantly felt that England always do worse at major tournaments if the match is broadcast on ITV and when they play on BBC they normally get the result they need. This World Cup I have been spouting this nonsense again and so far my ramblings have proved correct as both games have been on ITV and if England scrape through on Wednesday the game is broadcast on BBC. Is there a difference in results between ITV vs BBC broadcasts?&quot;

 History . 
 When AIDS appeared in the early 1980s and soon became an epidemic, the entire Canadian blood supply system was affected. . Over the next years, HIV had a huge impact on the hemophilia and blood-transfused communities. With the advent of HIV testing in 1985, it was recognized that a very high percentage of those with severe hemophilia and hundreds of others receiving blood or blood products had been infected. . More than 1,100 transfused Canadians were infected by HIV, of whom 700 had hemophilia and other bleeding disorders, and 400 were transfusion recipients for other reasons (trauma, surgery, childbirth, cancer…). Between 700 and 800 of these people have passed away.
 . A much larger number of people – up to 20,000 – were infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) through blood and blood products before testing was introduced in 1990. . 
The number of people who have died from hepatitis C related liver disease caused by tainted blood is not known but could be in the thousands, and continues to rise.The tainted blood tragedy is one of the worst public health disasters that Canada has ever faced.Between October 1993 and November 1997, when the Final Report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada was published, the Krever Commission brought this tainted blood tragedy into the public eye. k It has often been said that the lessons learned in the tainted blood tragedy must not be forgotten and that the pain and suffering experienced by so many must not be in vain. The Canadian Hemophilia Society (CHS) intends to ensure that this does not happen by holding a National Commemoration of the Tainted Blood Tragedy that will salute those now silent victims. m Canadian Hemophilia Society 400-1255 University StreetMontreal, Quebec H3B 3B6 chs@hemophilia.ca m ,

 Canada&apos;s blood supply
10 years after Krever, is it safe? 
Last Updated April 27, 2007
CBC News Protester Janet Conners in Ottawa accuses the government and Canadian blood supply managers of silence and coverups during the tainted blood scandal of the 1970s and &apos;80s. The woman&apos;s husband died from AIDS contracted from a blood transfusion. (Andrew Wallace/Canadian Press) 

Blood is probably the most precious liquid on Earth. It nourishes and restores life and is shared widely within communities, countries and around the world.

Bad or tainted blood is a human disaster on a similarly vast scale, as scandals in Canada, France, Australia and Britain have shown. A decade ago, this country finally began to come to terms with the criminal tragedy of blood infected with HIV and hepatitis C, and the thousands upon thousands of innocent Canadians who contracted the diseases through blood transfusions.

In November 1997, a royal commission headed by Justice Horace Krever of the Ontario Court of Appeal roundly vilified governments and blood collection agencies for their roles in that dark episode. Criminal charges were laid and the country belatedly took extensive steps to protect the blood supply.

Independent public agencies were set up to collect and protect blood donations in Quebec and the rest of Canada. Extensive testing was introduced at every stage of the process. Politicians and victims of the scandal squared off across a minefield of compensation and liability issues, and slowly but surely the crucial central issue of ensuring a safe blood supply began.

So where do we stand now? Is Canada&apos;s blood supply safe? Is it being adequately protected from existing threats and those that might come along in future? And will we have enough blood to serve an aging population when demographics show that most blood donors are themselves aging, with younger people yet to pick up the demographic slack?

Agency focuses only on blood
CBC News put these and other questions to several key players in the blood supply system. Canadian Blood Services (CBS) is the agency set up to manage supplies outside of Quebec. Dr. Kumanan Wilson is an internist and specialist in public health at the University of Toronto. David Page is executive director of the Canadian Hemophilia Association, which represents the interests of the largest group of regular users of the blood supply system, and the community most adversely affected by the tainted blood scandal. Thousands of Canadian hemophiliacs contracted HIV, hepatitis C or both for more than a decade before the current system was created.

There seems little doubt that blood in Canada is safer and better protected now than it was in the 1970s and &apos;80s. CBS is a completely different agency from the Canadian Red Cross, which used to manage blood supplies and was roundly condemned by the Krever Commission for negligence, coverups and worse.

Unlike the Red Cross, the new blood agency has a single responsibility, managing Canada&apos;s blood supply. It collects, tests and distributes blood, and according to a spokeswoman, &quot;is responsible for a national blood supply system which assures access to a safe, secure, cost-effective, affordable and accessible supply of quality blood, blood products and … alternatives.&quot;

Page agrees that blood is far safer than it was, &quot;but you can&apos;t be 100 per cent sure. That&apos;s why you need multiple layers of screening and testing for each individual donation as well as monitoring users for adverse reactions. That&apos;s what&apos;s being done, and it&apos;s working so far.&quot;

Controversial restrictions
Just over three per cent of Canadian adults donate blood, but the country is largely self-sufficient in blood products. An exception is plasma, much of which still comes from paid U.S. donors. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press) Donating blood in Canada isn&apos;t for everyone. To keep blood supplies free of disease, various people are barred from giving blood. Fears of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacobs disease (vCJD) — the human version of mad cow disease — mean that people who&apos;ve lived in Britain, France or Western Europe at certain times aren&apos;t allowed to donate. Controversially, so are men who&apos;ve had sex with men, even once or protected, since 1977. That same fear of HIV/AIDS contamination drives other bans on people from southern African countries and places with high infection rates. Intravenous drug users and those who&apos;ve had body piercings or tattoos also face restrictions and prohibitions.

Blood users and supply managers say such measures are necessary to ensure safe blood stocks — a goal that outweighs both the discriminatory nature of bans, and the exclusion of millions of willing donors from a system that is largely self-sufficient but hardly oversupplied.

&quot;Yes, it&apos;s discrimination,&quot; says Page, &quot;because we are excluding groups of people based on research into their behaviour or profiles, but how ethical would it be to take steps that might result — again — in thousands of deaths? We have to strike a balance.&quot;

The chilling knowledge that vCJD can be spread through blood supplies has vindicated the decision to exclude past residents of Britain, according to Wilson . There is no test that can detect the human variant of mad cow disease in blood, he says, so safety is paramount.

&quot;Precautionary measures work,&quot; he says, &quot;in ensuring blood safety. We had one of the most unsafe blood supplies; now post-Krever, we&apos;re among the safest. It&apos;s an enormous success story, but we have to test and be vigilant on every front.&quot;

CBS restrictions on blood donations exclude about half of the adult population of Canada, according to most estimates. That seems a lot. But only three per cent of eligible Canadians actually donate blood, so there is substantial room to expand the pools of donors, CBS says, at little or no risk to the system.

Blood for all
Science and technology can also help expand the amount and type of blood available for transfusions and medical needs. One example is research by a CBS scientist on so-called &quot;stealth donations,&quot; where the RH negative or positive factor of blood is masked in the laboratory. That widens the pool of donated blood that a patient can receive. An American bio-technology firm has just announced that it&apos;s working on a way to render blood type irrelevant, again allowing recipients to be transfused with almost any available units of blood.

Then there&apos;s the issue of paid donations, which vexes blood supply managers and medical ethicists the world over. The source of many tainted supply problems in earlier years was blood products from paid donors in the U.S. In many cases, this included prison populations and blood clinics based in poor neighbourhoods where prostitution and drug use were rife.

Canada is still largely dependent on plasma products obtained from paid U.S. donors, but standards are far, far higher than they used to be, according to Page.

&quot;It&apos;s a big business, but it&apos;s changed since the 1980s,&quot; Page told CBC news, &quot;The system is heavily regulated and the integrity of the [blood supply] companies has improved. It&apos;s served us very well recently.&quot;

Other methods of ensuring and managing blood supply might include making hospitals pay for transfusions that are now covered directly by provincial health budgets, according to Wilson . &quot;We&apos;re finding that transfusing blood or blood products as a first response isn&apos;t always valid medically,&quot; he says, &quot;and imposing a cost for units of blood should conserve supplies for essential needs.&quot;

So far, the consensus seems to be that Canada&apos;s blood supply is largely safe and adequate. But vigilance and creative ways to keep the blood flowing are increasingly necessary. The country cannot afford the consequences of failure on either front.

 When I first found myself connected to a support forum (years ago) I met a southern belle we called MPS.

One day while in chat I asked her where she was from and said &quot;Clinton&apos;s Blood State &quot;. I didn&apos;t know what she was talking about and I asked her to explain. She proceeded to tell me about the tainted blood story in Arkansas and Clinton&apos;s connection.

At the bottom of this entry there is a little article what happened in Arkansas...........

 Excerpt 
 /
 For more than two decades, the Arkansas prison system profited from selling blood plasma from inmates infected with viral hepatitis and AIDS. Thousands of unwitting victims who received transfusions of a product called &quot;Factor 8&quot; made from this blood died as a result.

The organization, which distributed the blood in the 1980s, paid a fine of $4,000 for causing more than 1,000 Canadians to contract blood-borne HIV and as many as 20,000 to become infected with hepatitis C.

Most everyone who is infected with HCV is aware of Canada&apos;s tainted blood scandal, but if you aren&apos;t you may want to familiarize yourself with what happened to many innocent people, its heartbreaking. &apos; /&apos; Posted: October 30, 2005
By Joseph Farah Clinton blood scandal The film reveals how for more than two decades, the Arkansas prison system profited from selling blood plasma from inmates infected with viral hepatitis and AIDS. Thousands of unwitting victims who received transfusions of a product called &quot;Factor 8&quot; made from this blood died as a result. m WASHINGTON – A documentary seven years in the making tying Bill Clinton to an Arkansas prison blood scandal that spread AIDS to thousands around the world is set to screen in Hollywood next week – renewing controversy about the long-forgotten story. 
 , The film, which premieres at the prestigious American Film Institute film festival next Tuesday, reportedly uncovers fresh evidence about how thousands in Europe contracted AIDS and hepatitis through tainted blood deliberately shipped even after widespread problems were discovered in Canada where some 10,000 had already been infected. 
The documentary shows how senior figures in the state prison system altered prisoners&apos; medical records to make it look like they were not carrying the deadly diseases.
Kelly Duda 
&quot;While making this documentary, I lost several things. I lost my president, my home state , my family, many friends, and my innocence,&quot; says Duda.
 The film reveals how for more than two decades, the Arkansas prison system profited from selling blood plasma from inmates infected with viral hepatitis and AIDS. Thousands of unwitting victims who received transfusions of a product called &quot;Factor 8&quot; made from this blood died as a result. 
Duda interviews victims in Canada who contracted the diseases, state prison officials, former employees, high-ranking Arkansas politicians, and inmate donors. 
&quot;In the early days of AIDS, we at the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) were surprised that the hemophiliac community was infected so rapidly,&quot; said Dr. Donald Francis, former head of the AID Laboratory for the CDC. &quot;This shocking documentary tells why.&quot; 
Duda, who has worked with CNN, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and Associated Press Television in their coverage of the blood-scandal story, says he was followed, sued, burglarized and had his tires slashed while working on the documentary. He was also part of the team for Fuji-TV that produced &quot;The Hepatitis C Epidemic: A 15-Year Government Cover-up.&quot; The program won a George Foster Peabody Award in 2003 and was watched by more than 12 million viewers in Japan. 
He also worked as a consultant in two major class-action lawsuits in Europe and Japan where plasma from Arkansas&apos; prison system showed up. He also assisted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in its investigation of the Arkansas prison plasma sales. He has also been in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI about a possible investigation in the United State s.
&quot;Kelly Duda&apos;s film screams to be known about,&quot; says William Gazecki, producer-director of &quot;WACO: The Rules of Engagement.&quot; &quot;The blatant abuse of power, the criminal subjugation of prison inmates, and the complete absence of government oversight and accountability make for a compelling, must-see story.&quot; 
&quot;Prior to the making of &apos;Factor 8,&apos; I never considered myself an investigative journalist,&quot; says Duda. &quot;In fact, I had never written a newspaper article before in my life. I was an aspiring filmmaker who had a story thrown into his lap. Actually, it wasn&apos;t even a story at the time but a series of events that allegedly took place in my home state in the 1980s. It was a tale I didn&apos;t want to tell, but the more I looked into it, the more I found. It didn&apos;t take long before I realized that regardless of the cost and sacrifice, the story you&apos;re about to see which is a complicated one had to be told. There where quite literally lives at stake. I felt a moral responsibility, a civic duty to do something.&quot; 
 Last May, the Canadian Red Cross pleaded guilty to distributing blood tainted with HIV and hepatitis C in a health disaster that killed more than 3,000 people. 
The organization, which distributed the blood in the 1980s, paid a fine of $4,000 for causing more than 1,000 Canadians to contract blood-borne HIV and as many as 20,000 to become infected with hepatitis C. 
As part of the plea deal, Canadian Red Cross Secretary General Dr. Pierre Duplessis issued a public apology via videotape that was played in the courtroom to survivors of the victims.
As WorldNetDaily reported, Bill Clinton was at the center of a scandal in Arkansas in the 1980s involving the sale of AIDS-tainted blood to Canada, which was distributed through the Red Cross. 
As governor of Arkansas, Clinton awarded a contract to Health Management Associates to provide medical care to the state &apos;s prisoners. The president of the company was a long-time friend and political ally of Clinton and later was appointed by him to the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission. Later, he was among the senior members of Clinton&apos;s 1990 gubernatorial re-election team. 
The death toll from the tainted blood has grown since the figure of 3,000 was calculated in 1997, but recent estimates are not available, the Associated Press reported. 
Duplessis said the organization accepted responsibility for &quot;having distributed harmful products for those that rely on us for their health.&quot; 
Prosecutors dropped criminal charges, including criminal negligence and common nuisance.
The Canadian Red Cross already has paid victims $55 million in a separate fund. Along with the fine, the charity will set aside $1.2 million for scholarships for family members of victims.
The Arkansas connection to Canada&apos;s blood scandal began with a deal Health Management Associates struck with the state allowing collection and sale of prisoners&apos; blood in addition to treatment. 
Because of the exploding AIDS crisis, U.S. regulations did not permit the sale of prisoners&apos; blood within the country. 
But HMA found a willing buyer in Montreal, which brokered a deal with Connaught, a Toronto blood-fractionator, which didn&apos;t know the source of the supplies.
Sales continued until 1983, when HMA revealed that some of the plasma might be contaminated with the AIDS virus and hepatitis. The blood was also marketed overseas. 
Michael Galster, who conducted orthopedic clinics in the Arkansas prison system during the period the blood was collected, charged HMA officials knew the blood was tainted as they sold it to Canada and a half-dozen other foreign countries. He also alleged Clinton knew of the scheme and likely benefited from it financially. 
&quot;It may sound sensational, but I assure you it&apos;s true. In the process of making &apos;Factor 8,&apos; I received strange phone calls, I was followed, my house was broken into, my tires slashed, and sensitive information – including my personal notes – mysteriously appeared on the Internet,&quot; recounts Duda. &quot;I also had a gun pointed at the back of my head, there was a murder, and a key inmate informant was whisked out of state and put into isolation.&quot; 
He says when he went looking for Clinton&apos;s governor&apos;s papers to find state documents relevant to his investigation, he was told that 4,000 boxes had been hidden away in private storage and could not be found. 
&quot;When I went to the Arkansas State Health Department to request records regarding disease rates at the prison and anything about the plasma program, I was stonewalled,&quot; he said. &quot;I actually had to sue the state agency just to get access to its files that by law are supposed to be a matter of public record. When I went to the Arkansas State Police Headquarters key documents had disappeared. When complete strangers showed up out of the blue asking me what I was doing and with whom did I work for, I had to ask myself, &apos;What&apos;s going on here?
One thing is for certain, if I had a dollar for every time someone (in the past seven years I&apos;ve been investigating this story) told me to &quot;be careful!&quot; I could have paid my rent several times over.&quot; 
Duda says in 2004 he was sued shortly before &quot;FACTOR 8&quot; was to screen in Park City, Utah. A federal judge blocked the premiere. The case eventually was settled out of court but set his project back nearly two years. 
Suzi Park er, writing in Salon.com, described how the scandal unfolded: &quot;At the Cummins Unit of the Arkansas penal system during the 1980s, while President Clinton was still governor, inmates would regularly cross the prison hospital&apos;s threshold to give blood, lured by the prospect of receiving $7 a pint. The ritual was creepy to behold: Platoons of prisoners lying supine on rows of cots, waiting for the needle-wielding prisoner orderly to puncture a vein and watch the clear bags fill with blood. Administrators then sold the blood to brokers, who in turn shipped it to other state s and to Japan, Italy, Spain and Canada. Despite repeated warnings from the Food and Drug Administration, Arkansas kept its prison plasma program running until 1994 when it became the very last state to cease selling its prisoners&apos; plasma.&quot; 
While working at the White House, Linda Tripp – the former assistant to both Vincent Foster and Bernard Nussbaum – said received a phone call from someone who mentioned the &quot;tainted blood issue.&quot; The phone call came just after Foster&apos;s mysterious death. The phrase meant nothing to Tripp and when she tried to find out more from a White House computer, the database denied her access. Testifying in a Judicial Watch deposition, Tripp said, &quot;It had been alarming to me that when I tried to enter data from a caller that I was working with on a tainted blood issue, that every time I entered a word that had to do with this particular issue, it would flash up either the word &apos;encrypted&apos; or &apos;password required&apos; or something to indicate the file was locked.&quot; 
The Ottawa Citizen reported attorney Foster had defended a lawsuit against HMA, the Arkansas firm shipping tainted blood from prison inmates. http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=33137
