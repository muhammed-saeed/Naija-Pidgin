CONGRESS PASSES FINANCIAL REFORM BILL. A PROVISION OF THE BILL IS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES WITH DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD FEES.

 Included In the Finance Reform Bill is a provsion that allows the Federal Reserve Board to regulate fees associated with debit card transactions. The bill should offer releif to thousands of small businesses. Listed below are some of the provisions:

 Allows the Federal Reserve to regulate interchange rates (These are the rates the business must pay to a credit card processing company). Retailers will no longer be able to offer discounts for payment methods. 

 Please read the complete ammendment that was proposed by Senator Dick Durbin below.

  [WASHINGTON, D.C.]–Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) issued the following statement after the Senate approved his amendment to help reduce the swipe fees that small businesses pay on every credit and debit card sale by a bipartisan vote of 64-33: 
 “Wall Street reform is really about two things: holding the big banks accountable for how they operate and empowering consumers to make good financial choices. Passage of this amendment is a win for the public on both fronts. 

 Passage of this measure gives small businesses and their customers a real chance in the fight against the outrageously high“swipe fees”charged by Visa and MasterCard. It will prevent the giant credit card companies from using anti-competitive practices, allow merchants to offer discounts to their customers and restore common sense and fairness to this broken system. 

 By requiring debit card fees to be reasonable, and by cleaning up Visa’s and MasterCard’s worst abuses, small businesses and their customers will be able to keep more of their own money. Making sure small businesses can grow and prosper is vital to putting our country back on solid economic footing.” 
 

 Swipe fees are supposedly charged by Visa and MasterCard in order to cover the cost of processing a credit or debit card transaction.  However, Visa and MasterCard continue to raise swipe fees even though processing costs have decreased.  High swipe fees are yet another way that banks and credit card companies hurt small businesses by charging fees that cut into already tight profit margins.
 

 An estimated $48 billion in swipe fees were charged by credit and debit card networks in 2008–this money came out of the bottom line of small businesses and merchants across America, and 80 percent of this money went to just ten large banks.

 The New Rules
 
 There are 3 changes coming in credit and debit card processing that you should know about. Why? Because they deal with requirements by VISA and MasterCard that used to drive business owners crazy - but not any more!

The new provisions in the Dodd-Frank Consumer Protection Act should please both consumers AND business owners! This is due to the Durbin Amendment, which creates new flexibility in how a merchant accepts debit and credit cards, as well as new control over the rates they pay. Here is what has changed...

 1. New Regulators 

Much to the anger and frustration of business owners over the years, the interchange rates and fees set by VISA and MC were self-regulated. In other words, VISA and MC set their own rates and fees. Business associations such as the National Retail Federation, et al, have consistently cried &quot;foul&quot;, saying that allowing control to be left in the hands of the 2 major card associations represented a virtual monopoly.

Well not anymore!

Since signing the Dodd-Frank CP Act, (which contains Sen. Dick Durbin&apos;s Amendment) into law on July 21st this year, the Federal Reserve Board will begin regulating fees to process debit cards. If the Fed does what many in the banking industry fears they&apos;ll do, we may see a dramatic lowering in the rates merchants pay to process debit cards.

No one really knows, of course, but Bank of America estimates interchange fees may drop anywhere from 60-80%! If that happens, expect to see retailers pass on at least part of that to the consumer - making business owners and consumers BOTH happy.

The Board the Federal Reserve creates has up to 9 months from the bill&apos;s passing to decide what the new rates will be.

 2. More Fair Policies 
 
Another card association requirement which drove merchants crazy was the fees they had to pay vs. the &quot;minimum dollar value&quot; of card transactions.

Until now, merchants have been required to accept payment cards for any purchase, regardless of the amount of sale, as long as the card presented to them had a VISA or MC logo on it. This meant that many times a merchant would only break even - and sometimes even LOSE money - when the fees they were being charged for a small ticket item were higher than the margin of mark-up on the item purchased. This was especially a problem for fast food restaurant and convenience store owners, who often processed transactions of less than $10 per average ticket, yet paid fees amounting to more than what their earnings were from that same ticket.

Can you see how that was unfair? To be required to take a loss, while the bank that issued the card could earn money off of the same transaction?

The new law allows a merchant to set a minimum dollar value of $10 on each purchase made with a credit or debit card, thereby insuring they&apos;re not going to lose money on the transaction. (NOTE: The minimum cannot exceed $10)

 3. Alternative Payments 
 
Lastly, here&apos;s one more thing merchants are going to like...

A large number of merchants I&apos;ve met with have wanted for years to be able to offer their customers discounts if they would use an alternative form of payment, e.g. a check or cash.

Now, they can.

Also, they can offer a variety of discounts for the same purchase, of the same item. For example, one price if paying by check, another for cash, another for debit, and yet another for credit - if they so desire.

One caveat: While it&apos;s nice to now be able to price an item according to it&apos;s best value for the merchant, it&apos;s also wise not to have so many choices it confuses or angers their customers!

In summary, with a new board regulating rates and fees, new laws favoring merchants with minimum costs for card usage, and flexibility in pricing based on payment method, it&apos;s easy to see some new advantages for both the merchant and consumer. Which, of course, is good for everyone.
