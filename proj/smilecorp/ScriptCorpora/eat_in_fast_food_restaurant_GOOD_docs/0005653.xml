 June 14, 2012 Great Food, Fast Delivery too! by Kevin ( 1 review ) Gyro -
I ordered Hooligan&apos;s for Delivery last night via www.crimson2go.com&amp;my food arrived promptly after. I recommend the Gyro, it&apos;s best I have had in town. That place is always busy, Good Food sells itself! May 29, 2012 Must try by Joshua Vanlandingham ( 1 review ) Gyro -
Hooligan&apos;s is the only place in Tuscaloosa to get a decent gyro, if you&apos;ve never tried it you&apos;re missing out. January 2, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by WhereIsGreatFood ( 60 reviews ) Had the basic cheeseburger and fries. It was average. I would eat here again July 20, 2011 Likes it Like Sam&apos;s Deli in Homewood by handlebars ( 98 reviews ) The food is good. I&apos;ve had the sampler, the gyro, and the falafel plate. It&apos;s cooked well and tastes fine. I really like the sampler. The falafel is very good, but I like all types of falafel. The service is slow, perpetually disinterested, and inattentive. If you can get past that and understand that much of the food is cooked to order so it can take longer than fast food, you&apos;ll be fine. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful April 4, 2011 Likes it Best Mediterranean Food in T-town by Brad ( 9 reviews ) If I&apos;m in the mood for traditional Mediterranean food I come here. It reminds me of similar places in Birmingham (such as Purple Onion, and Al&apos;s Deli). The menu isn&apos;t huge, but it has all the essentials. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful May 27, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Jacob W ( 12 reviews ) Great food as always. Burgers perfectly seasoned. Gyros loaded with meat and fresh veggies. Chicken wraps are excellent. Never a bad experience at Hooli&apos;s! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful December 29, 2010 Likes it Hit or Miss by Suzanne Gibson ( 20 reviews ) It&apos;s awesome to find a Mediterranean place in Tuscaloosa, especially so close to campus. However, you have to be in the mood as the food sometimes isn&apos;t all that stellar. November 1, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Greenwave ( 53 reviews ) Very very good love the Philly steak wrap September 18, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by art.iv ( 5 reviews ) definately not a bi-product of rain Hooligan&apos;s has a heavy college crowd. the service was prompt, yet our meal was overcooked&amp;soggy. need hardended/under seasoned fries? come to Hooligans. June 23, 2009 Likes it Best fast food in T-town by Mark Griffith ( 57 reviews ) I like this place and on a nice day it is fun to sit outside and eat. Great Cheeseburgers and many Middle Eastern dishes. I really like the lentil soup. January 10, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it Meh, not so great anymore by Carol Sipek ( 87 reviews ) At one time the mediterianian food was really good. They have since slipped in quality. Disappointing. October 23, 2011 Likes it Good food by Fei Ling ( 19 reviews ) This is the only place in town I will get a cheeseburger from. Their hummus is so good. Their wraps are also really good. Mint tea is the best I&apos;ve had. September 10, 2010 Likes it Friendly and Tasty by Kristen ( 4 reviews ) Hooligan&apos;s has a very friendly staff. Several times I&apos;ve called ahead on an order and picked it up very close to closing time. They&apos;ve always treated me with nothing but respect. I try to be diverse in the things I order, but I always go back to the Sampler Platter, The Tilapia Plate (and for a non coastal city their tilapia isn&apos;t terrible), and The Philly Wrap. To address some of the comments I&apos;ve read: I&apos;ve never had hardened under seasoned fries from there. They are usually soft and dripping in seasoning. I typically don&apos;t eat fries but I love Hooligans fries. There burgers are very fresh and delicious. Getting it to go was probably a bad idea as hamburgers usually get soggy and weird. I wouldn&apos;t consider their grill dirty as I always see them cleaning it. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful November 30, 2011 Likes it Great Place for Mediterranean by Kumar ( 3 reviews ) Usually go for lunch and is pretty good with great service. During the day the owner is there and specially makes the food. The service is very friendly, prompt, and take special attention to their food. The exterior and interior decor may throw a 1st timer off but, this place is hands down the best place for Mediterranean, hummus, gyros, etc in Tuscaloosa. Over the past few years there has been more added seating which is great! April 29, 2010 Likes it MINT TEA by Misty ( 18 reviews ) I love it! I would go here just for the tea. The tabouleh is my favorite. I like to eat it by its self or mix it up with the meat from the Kafa Kabob plate. Hummus is good, gyro wrap is good, I always have friendly fast service and the price is right! June 25, 2010 Likes it BEST FOOD IN T&apos;TOWN! by Erin ( 9 reviews ) AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! Love this place! You have to go if you visit/live in Tuscaloosa. The food is amazing, from the TALAPIA PLATE (my fav!) to the gyros to the egg sandwich. There is quite a variety, so you will find what you&apos;re in the mood for at this incredible Tuscaloosa establishment! From a definite foodie, you will LOVE anything you order here! July 21, 2010 Likes it Hooligans American by Burger Nirvana ( 8 reviews ) Hooligan&apos;s is located near the strip on University Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, Given its location, it is a popular place for University of Alabama students. They gyros, salads, wraps, and burgers. I ordered the double cheeseburger, which was $4.60. The burger comes with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and pickle on a bun. The bottom bun was grilled, which was new and interesting. As a matter of disclosure, I got the burger to go, which is a violation of the rules that I established, and may justify a re-rate down the line. Because I got it to go, I am going to give it a break on the freshness scale, because a burger freshness can deteriorate rather quickly, especially when wrapped in a non-breathable foil wrapper. I suspect had I not gotten the burger to go, it would have been quite fresh. I conclude this based upon the good state of the tomato and the color of the lettuce once I unwrapped it.

I suspect had I not gotten the burger to go, it would have been quite fresh. I conclude this based upon the good state of the tomato and the color of the lettuce once I unwrapped it. I m reasonably satisfied that they serve a burger made of fresh, quality ingredients. First and foremost, the burger is big. I don&apos;t know the exact weight, but I would not be surprised if the burger consisted on two 1/3 pound patties. The patties are thick with a moderate circumference, which makes for a nice juicy burger. It is a filling sandwich at a very reasonable price, which isn&apos;t a surprise given their primary clientèle. My primary complaint about the burger is that it had just a slightly funny taste. I suspect, although I can&apos;t prove it, that it might have something to do with a slightly dirty grill. Although the taste was slightly odd, I would not classify it as off-putting. My secondary complaint about the burger is that the patties, although they appear to be hand-formed, are very tightly packed with a fine grind, which just doesn&apos;t lend itself to a great texture. A good, not great burger, at a great price. Taste: 17/25 Texture: 8/15 Freshness: 10/10 Overall: 35/50 August 15, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Jess knight ( 7 reviews ) Great food for a great price! March 13, 2011 Mobile review by w-bird ( 7 reviews ) Awesome baked potatoes bigger than your head and slathered with butter and sour cream,turkey wrap,and grilled chicken sald with homemade greek dressing are all fantastic. Can&apos;t go wrong with ANYTHING. November 1, 2010 by babasketball14 ( 1 review ) Brian Armstrong Rachel Adams English 101 7 October 2010 Hooligans (A Hungry Person&apos;s Dream) Most of the time when you see an older looking restaurant, you think to yourself, that is probably not that good. Hooligans is the exact opposite. Hooligans is known for being a customer friendly place. I&apos;ve only been a few times but I will tell you what, they were the best restaurant experiences I&apos;ve so far, while being here in Tuscaloosa. The restaurant was very clean and well taken care of. Despite the Mediterranean food demand slipping, the old worn out look, and the unhealthiness of the cheeseburger, Hooligans is a great hot spot for college students and nearby neighbors who want to enjoy a variety of food whether it is eating inside, outside, or getting it to go. Hooligans has a unique look to it. It reminds me of an old diner you see in movies because you pay at the register and sit in booths. It&apos;s kind of like a waffle house but not as big.

Hooligans is the exact opposite. Hooligans is known for being a customer friendly place. I&apos;ve only been a few times but I will tell you what, they were the best restaurant experiences I&apos;ve so far, while being here in Tuscaloosa. The restaurant was very clean and well taken care of. Despite the Mediterranean food demand slipping, the old worn out look, and the unhealthiness of the cheeseburger, Hooligans is a great hot spot for college students and nearby neighbors who want to enjoy a variety of food whether it is eating inside, outside, or getting it to go. Hooligans has a unique look to it. It reminds me of an old diner you see in movies because you pay at the register and sit in booths. It&apos;s kind of like a waffle house but not as big. Walking up to the front door, passing the tables full of people chowing down and walking under the crimson colored overhang protecting you from the sun with the overwhelming smell of all the delicious food filling your nose, you get a rush of excitement speeding your walking up to almost a jog to get in. On the inside you get a laid back feeling with a jab of college atmosphere. Being on Alabama&apos;s campus near the strip on University Boulevard, they spiced it up a little bit with Alabama sports pictures on the wall with the crimson colored booths. Once you get a spot to sit at and start checking out the menu, your eyes will open wide seeing the prices on the menu. The prices are extremely good considering how good the food is. Some major highlights on the menu that I liked were the mint sweet tea, the spicy fries, and of course the cheeseburger. The cheeseburger and fries were only $4.50, which is a really good deal to me. While I was waiting on my meal, the waiters were very nice. They were always on top of refills and asking how I was doing. They even changed the TV to what I wanted to watch. The food arrived quickly, which was good especially for a starving customer. The scent you smell walking in the door finally comes back. Although you can&apos;t get blue cheese, chili, or jalapenos on the burger it still looks godly. By the look and smell of it, if you added more stuff you would ruin it. The first bite was masterful and even looking around on the other college student&apos;s faces; you could tell they were thinking the same thing. The taste of the melted cheese, pickles, and ketchup mixed perfectly with the well seasoned taste making any other burger hard to match up against it. The spicy fries on top of that made it an unforgettable meal. The fries were crisp and had the perfect amount of spice to them. They were a perfect combination together with a TV added in. I was full and very satisfied when I left. I couldn&apos;t even handle a dessert because I was so full. On my way out all the workers were very nice and polite saying,&quot;thank you for coming and please come back,&quot;which was nice to hear. When I was walking back to my truck I asked a worker, who was serving people outside, about the Mediterranean food that they served. The guy told me,&quot;they served Kabobs, Falafel, and Humus, but after the cheeseburger became so popular the demand dropped slightly. This trip was on a weekday where it wasn&apos;t nearly as crowded as on the weekends. On game day you see a lot of Alabama fans and families taking over. With the Alabama decorations on the wall and the team colors everywhere you look, it is a great atmosphere to get you excited for the game. The TV&apos;s all have the football games on and every person you see has crimson and white on. The great thing about this place though is that whether it is on game day or the weekdays, the service is still fast and the people are still extremely nice. On my few trips to Hooligans I found the restaurant to be very clean. Starting with the outdoor patio, there is never trash left there. Like them being on top of your refills, they are the same speed cleaning up. The tables were all wiped down with no signs of crumbs or anything. The silverware was clean and so were the restrooms. All the toilets and sinks were well taken care of. The floors were clean and everything and I really enjoyed that. Being a student here at Alabama, I need to be able to eat somewhere that is close and not that much time consuming because of all the work I have to do. I wouldn&apos;t call Hooligans a fast food restaurant, but it seems that way because of how fast they work and how fast you get your food. I would categorize it somewhere in between a fast food restaurant and a nice sit down restaurant. Hooligans is very convenient to students and nearby neighbors because it&apos;s located on campus near the strip on University Boulevard. It&apos;s very easy to get to and not far at all. It&apos;s also very convenient for fans on game day. It&apos;s not far from the stadium at all and it&apos;s in the heart of the activities on game day being near the strip. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody. The atmosphere is one of a kind being here on the University of Alabama&apos;s campus. It draws a lot of students and Alabama fans on game day or weekdays to go check it out. Having all the factors like: The old worn out look, friendly staff, the all everything cheeseburger, and the ability to eat inside, outside, or get it to go and enjoy it either way makes this place very special and unforgettable.
