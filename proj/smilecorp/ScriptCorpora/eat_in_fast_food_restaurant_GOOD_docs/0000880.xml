The fact of the matter is, none of these, including fast food, should be banned. There is nothing wrong with them. The problem is with the people.

Back on topic; I worked at McDonalds for over a year. I actually wanted to kill myself whilst at work sometimes. It is unbelievable the amount of stress you feel in a job like that.

Best of luck to you. I feel your pain. 
 You&apos;re right we can&apos;t ban everything. I hope some healthy fast-food restaurants popup soon with energy, fat, sugar, vitamin declarations on each meal.

PSU : Blackwidow 850w 03-10-2008, 18:22| posts: 3,196 | Location: Central PA Every job has stress... But not every place has morons or losers. Where I work they only hire&quot;A&quot;players. It&apos;s a day long interview along with all kinds of background checks and crap like that. They call it&quot;Hire them great!&quot;Seriously, if someone gets hired who doesn&apos;t turn out to be an&quot;A&quot;player, they get canned pretty quickly. So everyone I work with works hard and does their job well.

Since you are young, UG_PL, you will have to deal with some crapy jobs. My best advice is to keep working the job you have, but look for something better. Until you find something better, it&apos;s best to continue to be employed even if you can&apos;t stand the job.

 Well, Although McDonalds is FAR from healthy, they do have easily available dietary information in all their restaurants. ~560 kCal in ONE double cheeseburger.

But they taste sooo nice...

At least your starting out at $1.15 above Texas minimum wage.

When I have a big project to get done, I&apos;ll pay laborers $10 to $12 hour if they can just show up on time and not smell like beer or weed, lol.

Look at the bright side, on July 24th, 2009 you will get a 25 cent pay raise after the minimum wage is increased to $7.25 an hour

 As a side note I&apos;d like to comment that at least here in Argentina when you get employed for the first time you need to get what is named a&quot;CUIL number&quot;which is associated to your ID number. Following that CUIL number and a few more details like the date of birth and gender, there&apos;s a government website where you can get a full history of the past and current jobs of a person, provided they were legally registered. If you get employed&quot;in black&quot;(like we say here), you don&apos;t pay taxes, your employer doesn&apos;t pay taxes and the job won&apos;t be listed. But!, you also lose your rights as an employee and your employer can fire you without warning and for whatever reason and he won&apos;t pay you any financial compensation either.

 Yeah, the minimum wage varies from state to state. California is at $8 right now which is the highest. The cost of living is higher in states like Cali&amp;New York so the state governments mandate a higher MW through legislation.

You will find stupid moronic co-workers in every job situation. Get used to it. I do agree that fast food is probably the worst environment to work in...moronic co-workers&amp;too many asshats thinking they have some sort of sense of entitlement...Its crappy fast food, for christs sake! 
 ^ I second that!! I came from that background and now I own a multimillion dollar restaurant in my hometown. I actually took it a step further and went to Culinary School with 13 years experience in the industry...just to formalize my training and receive the papers. My class was the *first* in the USA to receive Le Cordon Bleu certification - I was extremely fortunate to have gotten in when I did, &apos;cause the class behind mine paid more than double my tuition for the same degrees.

But, don&apos;t get me wrong - the fast food industry really is crap - mostly because of the politics and behind-closed-doors corporations that don&apos;t actually spend time in their kitchens...then come the employees...you know the ones - they crawl out of every gutter and crawlspace in town to come to work every morning - in fact, I get surprised (and amused) wondering just how they remembered to tie their shoes in the morning!!

I wish you well at your new job. I couldn&apos;t work in a nursing home - I tried many years ago, and I found it too hard to become detached from those who&apos;s families have discarded them for us to take care of...it was really rough for me - in fact, after a full 40 hour week, I just told my boss (good friend) to keep my paycheck and not call me back to work there. But, hopefully it will turn out better for you.

On a side note, if you can get to your local Wal-Mart, they have a brand of shoes you *need* for restaurant work...they&apos;re called TreadSafe (Shoesforcrews.com also has them, but they&apos;re more expensive and don&apos;t necessarily last longer) These &apos;TreadSafe&apos; shoes are made specifically for restaurant workers. They have a special tread on them that keeps you from slipping on watery/greasy floors, and they have special inserts in them because they know restaurant workers are on their feet all day on hard floors - they&apos;re *very* comfortable after they&apos;re broke-in.

Wow...that really takes me back - it&apos;s been over 21 years since my first restaurant job...but I can still totally relate to those feelings!
Anyway, good luck on your new job - hope it works well for you.

BTW ,I have those shoes and they are pretty good. I bought them few days ago in my Local Wal-Mart . lol

Top Chef is pretty good! There really is some good talent on there (as opposed to some of the &apos;home-chef&apos; shows on TLC/Disc/etc.

And, as for Martha Stewart - I&apos;d just as soon watch her ass a turkey like on the South Park episode about reverse-eating - than ever see her cook something ever again!!
When I was in Culinary School, every day after it was over, a bunch of classmates and I would go to my apartment and watch the Food Network so we could tear them apart. Well, one day, Martha was doing some roasted chicken...with a guest Chef (can&apos;t remember who it was now) Anyway, she cut a wog (without giblets) in half (literally a whole chicken, then cut in half) and was speaking about the tenderness of the chicken...then proceeded to pull out a tenderizing mallet and beat the CRAP out of the chicken - bones and all...all the while, the guest Chef was watching over her shoulder with this look on his face that I&apos;ll *never* forget.
Something about a shard of chicken bone in every bite and the sheer stupidity of her actions made me want her to die a horrible and painful death - maybe even Shigillosis poisoning or Ciguatera would do. - as long as the cratch dies in some horrific way.

I personally love watching anything that Chef Ramsey does - Ramsey&apos;s Kitchen Nightmares and Hell&apos;s Kitchen are great! I think to myself every time I watch one how cool it would be to be accepted to compete against asinine wannabe line cooks for a multimillion dollar restaurant in a multibillion dollar resort in Vegas - or to have Chef Ramsey visit my kitchen in my own episode of Kitchen Nightmares...I know I live it every day anyway!!

I was standing in Drive-Thru taking only money. Some black fat dude (I&apos;m not a racist person ) drivers in .I tell him nicely (and knowing that this is going to be nasty one ) Hi ,How are you? Your total is going to be $4.25 so he gives me $5.25 but at that time I did not know about the .25c so I pull the $5 and I drop .25c . And he is like&quot;Man! You drop my quarter!!&quot;I&apos;m like ...&quot;uhmmm... I&apos;m really sorry . Let me see where it dropped ,so I move my head out of the window and say&quot;its right there&quot;He is like I know ,but I can&apos;t reach!!&quot;I&apos;m thinking to my self&quot;Ohh.. boy ,Then loose some pounds and stop eating in Wendy&apos;s you dumb piece of crap!&quot;So I give him change from only $5 which was ,75c but he is like&quot;dude you should give me that quarter from your pocket!&quot;And I say to him ...&quot;I&quot;M REALLY SORRY SIR&quot;Then he looks at the quarter that lays there on the driveway and says&quot;What ever&quot;and drives off to the next window for his daily 2000 calories... 

BTW ,I did not see the quarter because it was already dark.
