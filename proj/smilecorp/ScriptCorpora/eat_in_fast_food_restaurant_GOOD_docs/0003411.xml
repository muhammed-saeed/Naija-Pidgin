		&quot;ATTENTION: Discover How to Stop Poisoning Your Dog&quot;

I almost killed my dog....TWICE!  What would you do if you found out you were unintentionally poisoning your dog?
 
Dear Dog Owner,

Just like you, I love my dogs more than anything. All I want is to keep them with me, healthy and happy, for as long as possible. Despite this, I&apos;ve almost killed my adorable, innocent babies-not once, but TWICE!

 Hi My name is Donna. Let me tell you my story.....

The first time I almost killed my dog Artemis, he was only a year old. I was still in college, living in an apartment and working part-time. Naturally, I had a limited food budget. When I went shopping for dog food, I bought the cheapest food in the store. Whatever was on sale was what went in my cart. One week, I came home with a 40-pound bag of some off-brand dog food-I don&apos;t even remember the brand name anymore.


As usual, I split open the bag and poured the food into my Tupperware bin. As usual, I dished out a bowl of it for Artemis. I noticed it was a funny color-a bright, reddish-orange. I noticed Artemis didn&apos;t seem to have much enthusiasm for it, either, but I chalked it up to him being finicky. After all, all commercial dog foods are safe and balanced, right?

After he ate his first dinner from that bag, I noticed that when he did isr“business,”it was a little more“Technicolor”than usual...in fact, it was the same fluorescent hue as the new food. The next day, I was surprised to notice my long-ago housebroken boy squatting in the corner. I scolded him, and he whimpered pitifully. Then, not 15 minutes later, there he was in the corner again-whimpering, shaking and crying in pain.

 Of Course I was Terrified! 

I took him to the vet, and they diagnosed a severe bladder/kidney infection. He was treated, and recovered....but he spent several days at the vet, and I was out $600 in vet bills. I asked the vet if the food could have been to blame...he said it wasn&apos;t likely, but I poured out the rest of it anyway and bought a different brand.

Fast-forward to 2007. When news of the Menu Foods recall broke, I thought my dogs were safe . After all, I was feeding them dry kibble, not the canned food that was originally identified as contaminated. But the recall didn&apos;t stop there. It spread to include more and more pet foods, including dry, store brand kibbles. Every morning, I would wake up and read the news. I thought the food I was feeding my pet was safe because it wasn&apos;t on the lists...until, one day, it was.
 
Thousands of pets were not so lucky !

Fortunately, even though the bag I had been feeding my baby was recalled, he didn&apos;t get sick. At that point, the contaminant had been identified as melamine, an industrial chemical that was added (on purpose!) to wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate from China. Even foods that been manufactured in the same factory as brands using the contaminated vegetable proteins were recalled due to low levels of contamination. I lucked out in that my baby hadn&apos;t gotten a bag with high levels of the stuff.

However, hundreds or even thousands of pets were not so lucky. The exact death toll will never be known for sure because most deaths were not properly investigated to confirm whether or not they were the result of the recalled food. Here&apos;s what we do know about the recall:

•More than 5300 pet food products were taken off the shelves.
•The affected ingredients included wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate from China.
•Menu Pet Foods heard the first complaints about poisoned foods in February of 2007. Also, during February of 2007, it performed its own tests that showed 1 in 6 animals fed its food died. The recall was not issued until the middle of March.


What I learned changed my life, and my dog&apos;s life, forever

After I found out I had been feeding my baby what amounts to small levels of poison, I decided to start learning more about pet food and what it contains. What I learned changed my life, and my dog&apos;s life, forever. Now, I&apos;d like to share that knowledge with you.

 
 Do you really know what you are feeding your dog? 

 Go ahead, go read the ingredient label right now.....Can you even identify half of the ingredients? 

 


We trust pet food manufacturers to sell us safe products for our babies. We rely on our veterinarians to recommend the best brands, and the stores we shop at to stock them. We have become so trusting, most of us don&apos;t even know what is in the food we are feeding our dogs . Do you know what you are really feeding your dog? Go ahead, go read the ingredient label right now.....Can you even identify half of the ingredients?

 How can you ever hope to protect your dogs from harmful food if you have no idea what you are feeding them? Pet food that&apos;s poisoned by contaminants like melamine or toxins from moldy grain is bad enough, but what&apos;s even worse is that even if you aren&apos;t feeding“contaminated”food, your commercial brand of food may be slowly harming your pet. Why is that?


Food Made From Trash?

Did you know that most commercial pet foods are made of trash...literally? It&apos;s true! Pet food companies may pretend to be concerned about pets, but that&apos;s not why they are business. They are actually in business for one reason and one reason only...to make money! Despite their fuzzy ads to the contrary, they don&apos;t care about your dog .

Your only defense is education. Get educated. Read &quot;Dog Food For Life.&quot;                                                          Buy NOW 

&quot;I was glad to finally find a book that describes what the ingredients in dog food actually are. Now that I know, yuck! I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m feeding some of that to my best friends!&quot;--Carol in Oregon

 
 Euthanized pets are shipped to rendering plants and melted down! 
 

The easiest way for pet food companies to make money is to turn meat that&apos;s not fit for human consumption into pet food. This can include animals with cancer or other diseases, animals that are already dead...even euthanized pets are shipped to rendering plants and melted down down become pet food ingredients!

Yes, you read that right...Euthanized pets are made into pet food! For example, a story published in the LA Times on January 6, 2002 described the uproar that resulted when a rendering plant that accepted the dead animals from St. Louis, Missouri animal shelters was found to supply a pet food company with rendered fats and proteins. 


Rendered pets are just the tip of the iceberg. Pet food companies use other ingredients that are downright toxic or harmful to pets.

 An industrial solvent derived from petroleum
 An artificial coloring tied to cancer of the kidneys A preservative banned from use in many other countries Another preservative, never proven safe, and implicated in cancer A synthetic form of a common vitamin linked to anemia, immune system deficiencies and liver damage 
 

 If you&apos;re going to feed commercial food, you need to know how to read the labels . My Confidential Dog Food Report will show you how. Here&apos;s what you&apos;ll learn:

Some dog food websites are content to give you a list of the brands they recommend, but I wanted to do more than that. You may have heard the saying...”If you give a man a fish, he&apos;ll eat for a day, but if you teach him to fish, he&apos;ll eat for a lifetime.”Well, I want to teach you how to fish for the best, safest dog food for your babies!

Commercial Dog Food: The Equivalent of a Lifetime of Fast Food

 Let&apos;s say you do find a bag of kibble without any harmful additives- does it really give your dog the nutrition it needs? The pet food companies would like for us to think so, wouldn&apos;t they? In fact, both pet food companies and vets alike spent much of the 2007 recall talking about how dangerous it is to cook for your dog, since only commercial diets are“complete and balanced.”

However, by its very nature, commercial dog food is extremely processed. It has to be to have a long shelf life. And most of it is made with nutritionally worthless fillers and packed with starches to make your dog feel full . It&apos;s like the equivalent of meals at a fast food restaurant. Sure, it&apos;s cheap, filling and good for a quick meal, but what would happen if you ate nothing but fast food, day in and day out, for the rest of your life?
