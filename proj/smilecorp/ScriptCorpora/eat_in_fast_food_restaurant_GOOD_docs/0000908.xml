 Made to Crave, by bestselling author Lysa TerKeurst, is a six-session video study with participant&apos;&apos;s guide that uncovers the missing link between a woman&apos;&apos;s desire to be healthy and the spiritual empowerment necessary to make it happen. Go beyond the &apos;&apos;how to&apos;&apos; and learn to find your &apos;&apos;want to&apos;&apos; on the path to healthy eating patterns and spiritual satisfaction. 
 
 From the Publisher: 
In this six-session video study, Lysa TerKeurst helps women discover the missing link between a woman&apos;s desire to be healthy and the spiritual empowerment necessary to make that happen. The reality is, we were made to crave.Craving isn&apos;t a bad thing.But we must realize God created us to crave so we&apos;d ultimately always desire more of Him in our lives. Many of us have misplaced that craving towards overindulging in physical pleasures instead of lasting spiritual satisfaction. For a woman struggling with unhealthy eating habits, Made to Crave will equip her to:*Break the &apos;I&apos;ll start again Monday cycle&apos; and start feeling good about herself today*Stop beating herself up over the numbers on the scale and make peace with the body you&apos;ve been given*Discover how your weight loss struggle isn&apos;t a curse but rather a blessing in the making*Replace justifications that lead to diet failure with empowering Go-to Scripts that lead to victory.*Eat healthy without feeling deprived* Reach your healthy weight goal while growing closer to God through the process.

Chapter One
 From Deprivation to empowerment

Welcome! 
Welcome to Session 1 of Made to Crave . You&apos;re about to embark on a spiritual adventure with great physical benefits! if this is your first time together as a group, take a moment to introduce yourselves to each other before watching the video. Then let&apos;s get started!

 Video: From Deprivation to Empowerment (20 MINUTES) 
As you watch the video, use the outline below to follow along or to take notes on anything that stands out to you.

 Notes 
God made you wonderful. (Psalm 139) Indulge: To take unrestrained pleasure in something. &quot;Dear friends, O urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which [wage] war against your soul.&quot; (1 Peter 2:11) Made to Crave is not about helping you to find your how-to ; it&apos;s about helping you find your want-to . How-to = diet programs Want-to = the spiritual and mental motivation to make lasting changes Story of the rich young man. (Matthew 19:16-26) &quot;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.&quot; (Mark 8:34) Food isn&apos;t bad, but it&apos;s a problem when it sabotages you mentally, physically, and spiritually. I had to be really honest. The thing I thought about, ran to, took comfort in, found refuge in, turned to and depended on, was food way more than it was Jesus. This is a spiritual journey that will reap wonderful physical benefits. If we can look at healthy options and make the healthy choices—and not feel deprived but instead feel empowered—everything will change. It will change us mentally, spiritually, and physically. Made to Crave will help you learn how to feel empowered rather than deprived. We were made to crave, desire, want greatly, one thing: God, not food.

3. Jesus asks us to give up being controlled by anything in life that we crave more than we crave Him, which may feel impossible to do.

 Closing Prayer 
Close your time together with prayer.

 Maximize the Impact 
Maximize the impact of this curriculum with six days of personal study between sessions, alternating every other day between reading a chapter of the Made to Crave book and then completing a Bible study on the theme of that chapter (see next page). Setting aside just twenty to thirty minutes a day for personal study will enable you to complete the book and Bible studies by the end of the six-session group experience.

 Between-Sessions Personal Bible Study
DAY 1: Read and Reflect 
Read the introduction and chapter 1 of Made to Crave . If you want to dig a little deeper, use a notepad or journal to work through the personal reflection questions at the end of the chapter. Use the space below to note any insights or questions you want to bring to the next group session.

 DAY 2: What&apos;s Really Going on Here? 
We tend to think of a craving as a weakness, something that compels us to eat something that probably isn&apos;t the healthiest choice. But what if our ability to desire—to crave—is something that could draw us closer to God? Would it change the way you think about craving?
I believe God made us to crave. Now before you think this is some sort of cruel joke by God, let me assure you that the object of our craving was never supposed to be food or other things people find themselves consumed by, such as sex or money or chasing after significance.... Yes, we were made to crave—long for, want greatly, desire eagerly and beg for—God. Only God. But Satan wants to do everything possible to replace our craving for God with something else.
 Made to Crave , pages 20-21

1. When it comes to food cravings, we tend to go for something sweet or salty, crunchy or soft, cool or warm.
How would you describe the kinds of foods you typically eat to satisfy a craving?
What is it about this kind of food that you enjoy so much? For example, is it the creaminess of ice cream melting on your tongue? Licking spicy seasoning off your fingers? The feeling of abundance represented by a whole bag or box of something?
How do you feel before, during, and after eating your craving food? Before eating, I feel ...
While I&apos;m eating, I feel ...
After eating, I feel ...
2. The Bible describes three specific tactics Satan uses to misdirect our desires and lure us away from loving God:
Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the world—the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does—comes not from the Father but from the world. (1 John 2:15-16, emphasis added)
Using the following list, think back over the last twenty-four hours or the last few days to see if you recognize how you may have been tempted in similar ways.
 Craving : meeting physical desires outside the will of God . In what ways were you tempted by unhealthy desires for things such as food, alcohol, drugs, or sex?
 Lust of the eyes : meeting material desires outside the will of God . In what ways were you tempted by excessive desires for material things—clothing, financial portfolio, appliances, vacation plans, cosmetics, home d?cor, electronics, etc.?
 Boasting : meeting needs for significance outside the will of God . In what ways were you tempted by desires to prop up your significance—perhaps by name dropping, exaggerating, feigning humility or other virtues, doing something just because you knew it would be observed by others, etc.?
In what ways was your ability to love God and love others (including yourself) impacted by your response to these temptations?
3. Read Genesis 3:6 and Matthew 4:1–11 to see how Satan used these same three tactics with eve and with Jesus. Note each temptation on the chart below.

[Eve] focused only on the object of her obsession.... Eve craved what she focused on. We consume what we think about. And what we think about can consume us if we&apos;re not careful.
 Made to Crave , page 23
4. In one sense, we could say that eve and Jesus had similar responses to their temptations—they both kept a laser-like focus on their desires. The difference between them was what they wanted most of all—what they craved. Eve&apos;s cravings displaced God and made Him secondary to her other desires; what mattered most to her was everything the forbidden fruit represented. Jesus&apos; cravings asserted God&apos;s supremacy over every other desire, even a legitimate desire for food; what mattered most to Him was the will of God. Do you see why what we crave matters so much?
Refer back to your responses to question 2. For each temptation you wrote down, how would you describe the craving—what you wanted most of all—behind the temptation?
How do you feel about this principle—that what we crave matters—when it comes to our food choices?
5. Jesus defeated every temptation—every lie from the enemy—by quoting the truth of God&apos;s Word. Truth is powerful. The more saturated we are with truth, the more powerful we&apos;ll be in resisting our temptations, whatever form they take. As you begin this healthy eating journey, here is a strengthening truth you can soak in every day:
But he said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness&quot; ... For when I am weak, then I am strong. (2 Corinthians 12:9-10)
Your weakness with food does not disqualify you from winning this battle. In fact, it may be your best qualification. You&apos;ll have to rely on God completely, and that makes you the perfect candidate for grace.
In the space provided, write a brief prayer that expresses your heart to God as you begin this Made to Crave journey. Tell Him your fears and questions, your hopes and desires, your weaknesses and needs. Ask for His grace, all sufficient for you.

 DAY 3: Read and Reflect 
Read chapter 2 of Made to Crave . If you want to dig a little deeper, use a notepad or journal to work through the personal reflection questions at the end of the chapter. Use the space below to note any insights or questions you want to bring to the next group session.

 DAY 4: Replacing My Cravings 
When we rely on something, we trust it and depend on it; we have confidence that it won&apos;t let us down. If we struggle with food, at some point we have to wrestle with a very raw question: Is it possible we love and rely on food more than we love and rely on God? 
I had to get honest enough to admit it: I relied on food more than I relied on God. I craved food more than I craved God. Food was my comfort. Food was my reward. Food was my joy. Food was what I turned to in times of stress, sadness, and even in times of happiness. Made to Crave , page 29

1. For each of the items listed below, use the space provided to rate the degree to which you rely on food to give you what you need. Use the following scale:
3 = Food is almost always the first thing I rely on. 2 = Food is frequently what I rely on. 1 = Food is occasionally what I rely on. 0 = Food is rarely what I rely on.
_____ When I need comfort _____ When I want a reward _____ When I feel joy _____ When I experience stress _____ When I feel sadness _____ When I feel happiness _____ When I experience boredom 

Pick one of the items you rated as a 3 or a 2 and circle it. Keep it in mind as you respond to the following questions.
What behaviors do you typically engage in when turning to food for that reason? For example, if you rely on food for comfort, do you secretly get takeout from a fast food restaurant and eat it in your car, sit down in front of the television with a bag of chips, curl up in your favorite chair with a pan of warm brownies and a fork?
How do you imagine your behaviors might change if you were able to turn to God at such times? What, specifically, would you do and not do instead?
What feelings arise when you consider the prospect of not relying on food at such times? (Continues...)
