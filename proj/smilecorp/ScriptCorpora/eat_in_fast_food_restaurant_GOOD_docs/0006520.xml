 Tags: DisneyPixar   Cars   Boys   Bike   Huffy   for   4099   ACPM   kohls   Best way to sell used cars I have two used cars that I want to sell since I&apos;ll be moving inter-state and they&apos;re old-ish (~11 years). One is a 2002 Honda Accord EX-L (~100k miles) and the other is a 2003 Subaru Forester (~30k miles). I imagine P2P will get me the most for the cars but it&apos;s a bit of work to prepare them to sell and the timeline is complicated, especially with two young children around. I&apos;m thinking of picking a date about 1 week before the move and dumping the cars somewhere where I can get a decent if not ideal price and switching to a rental car with car seats (will actually only need to rent 1 fortunately) instead. What do you all think of this plan? Can you make any suggestions about where I&apos;ll get the best price? I was thinking of CarMax but don&apos;t have any experience here. The nearest one is about 1 hour away so it&apos;s a bit of a pain, especially since I&apos;ll need to do the trip twice to sell both cars as there&apos;s only two drivers. I imagine the dealers are going to be a much worse deal. Any estimate for how much I&apos;ll be losing on the cars taking this shortcut? I think KBB puts both around $7k.

I am looking at 4 cylinder car (2004-2008), preferably under 80K miles. I am going to use family friend car dealer, who is going to buy a car at an auction for me (service fee $500). So, hopefully I will get a car for at least $2-3K below dealership cost. Below are the models I am considering:- Audi A4
- Lexus IS (or others in the cheaper range)
- Acura TSX
- Volvo S40 (or others in the cheaper range)
- WV Passat
- Infinity G
- BMW 3 1.Can someone please recommend from personal experiences which of these cars would require least maintenance?
2.Can someone share their experience buying cars at auctions?
3.Can someone, who financed their car through PenFed let me know if they just give you a check, so you can pay the dealer in full?I dont know much about cars, so any information is greatly appreciated.

Tags: Best   Used   Cars   for   under   8000   Refinance my cars so I can refinance my house I want to refinance my house into a conventional 30 year loan to lower my interest rate and get rid of MIP. In order to do so, I will need to pull equity out of my cars so I can get 20% equity. To do this I am planning to get auto loans from Penfed, 60 months at 2.49%. However, I am not sure the best course of action since I know a rigurous credit check will be required to refinance the house and 2 new auto loans might not look so good. Here are some specifics:Current Mortgage:
- Remaining balance: $167,000
- 5.25% FHA
- 27 years and 3 months remaining
- Pay $77 in MIP each monthHouse:
- FMV per county assessor is $167,000
- Appraised for $180,000 3 years ago when new
- Located in midwest
- Bought as new constructionAssets:
- 2 cars worth $26,000 (kbb private party sale) or $24,000 (kbb trade in value) and are both paid off
- $15,000 I have set aside as my &quot;car payments&quot; after both are paid off
- $15,000 and $5,000 (ibonds liquid in June) in emergency fundsSo in order to accomplish this refinance I guess there are 2 options:1) Refinance cars, then use $15k and auto refinance to pay down house to 80% and then refinance house
2) Use some emergency funds and $15k to pay down house to 80%. Then refinance house. Then refinance the cars to replenish emergency funds.I am thinking about getting an appraisal to determine what exactly that 80% number will be.Any tips or suggestions?Edit:
Credit Karma is in 750s and my wife&apos;s is probably similar.

I have literally looked for hours (probably wasted too much time to save a few bucks at this point) and Costco was the best deal by far.You can get a full sized SUV for $88 from Budget whereas the site is $200 even after discount codes.

-2000 Honda Accord, average 24 mpg, 195,000 miles, fair condition. Averaging $1,500 of repairs / maintenance per year for last 3 years. $3,000 value
-2000 Hyundai Accent, average 28 mg, 91,000 miles, good condition. Averaging $200 of repairs / maintenance per year for last 3 years. $1,500 valueI commute in stop and go traffic for around 100 miles per week in the Accent. No complaints.
Wife commutes on interstate 550 miles per week in the Accord. (Tried the Accent, but its safety rating is horrible and the whole car shakes doing above 64 mph).Accord is acting funny and I have a feeling another large repair may be on the horizon, since she is driving it 25,000+ miles per year. This is also our family car, and the only car big enough for trips and driving around a dog. No kids yet, but will have one in next 2 years. My hope is this Accord will run forever, but I can&apos;t justify spending another $1,000 on it.In case the Accord breaks, I want a game plan now for what type of car we will buy. We need to have a family car, but I definitely don&apos;t want to put 25k per year on a more expensive new car if we want it to last for at least 10. Financially:
-Will have $17,000 saved specifically for cars by December 2012, $35,000 by December 2013
-Have additional financing for $10,000 at 1% APR over 5 years if necessary.Current Plan:
1)Accord breaks, get wife a 2009-2012 low mileage or new elantra / civic / corolla, spending between 13k-15k. This will be smaller than an accord, but we&apos;ll make it work temporarily as a family car. Want something with great MPG highway, go 70 comfortably, SAFE, can fit a large dog cage.
2)Once a kid is on the way, get a 2011-2013 low mileage or new sonata / accord / camry, spending between 20k-22k. This will be my commuter, so needs decent city mpg.
3)Drive both of these hopefully until 200,000 miles / 10-12 yearsQuestions:
1)New cars seem to be a better deal than used everywhere I am looking (Save a couple thousand dollars, but the car already has 50,000 miles on it). Should I go with new or just need to look at lower demand used models?
2)Any specific years / models you would recommend? I&apos;m fine with the police enforcer idea, but don&apos;t like the mpg hit and most are too long to fit in my garage.
3)What would be your plan in my situation?Sorry for the long post, and thanks for any input / ideas you provide. Tags: Need   buy   cars   next   years   Austin, TX: Free 100 minutes with Car2go.

I think this is pretty damn cheap for all depreciation, repair costs, and insurance...but I&apos;d love to have something to compare it to. Of course this doesn&apos;t account for gas (since everyone drives different amounts that&apos;s pretty much impossible to compare apples to apples) but this thing got good mileage, too.

The Game:Todays game is another car game from Handmade games/cccp games that includes elements of racing against time, smashing into bandit cars and destroying road blocks. The game looks similar to most of the vehicle based games that hand made games have created, however theres no actual racing against other AI controlled vehicles this time Instead there are four scenarios covering 16 levels, which repeat with different routes on four city maps, the levels get harder as you progress:1) Patrol the Route as fast as you can, avoiding traffic. Near misses gain you a charge of Nitro Boost, but collisions will slow you down. The route is marked by green arrows.2) Extremists have blocked the cities roads with cargo containers. Destroy the cargo containers using the vehicles provides. Each vehicle has a snow plow attached to the front of the vehicle. Destroy the blokades by hitting them at weak points. Each hit earns you a charge of Nitro Boost.3) Criminals are terrifying the city by purposely crashing into random traffic. Ram the culprits until youve destroyed their vehicle. You will earn a charge of Nitro boost every time you hit the criminals vehicle.4) Hackers have gained access to the cities traffic control system and have threatened the safety of citizens cars by remotely controlling empty cars. Ram all traffic cars but avoid oncoming traffic otherwise youll lose valuable time.There are five different vehicles to choose from called the L560 (Bullet and Needle), the F400 (Phantom and Ghost), the C850 (Cheetah, the B1000 (Meteor0 and the P1200 (Photon), the latter three are locked at the start of the game. To unlock them you have to earn points by beating specific times of which there are three. Failing to qualify withn one of these times gains you no points and fails to unlock the next level.

The ad actually says the MSRP on this model was $84,015, less $14,262 discount, plus $5000 rebate. But on the site, it shows $75,250 MSRP, so I&apos;ve listed it per the website, not the Columbus Dispatch. I&apos;d bet there&apos;s similar savings at other dealerships.

We figured he cracked the oil pan and we were going to get it fixed. Since last September he totaled our Jeep (link) I figured it would be better to just fix it than to call insurance. So I finally got around to having it towed to the shop and they say the engine is &quot;locked up&quot; which I&apos;ve interpreted to mean, your car is dead. you can skip this part if you want----after he totaled the jeep we got him a beater, 94 mazda pickup. It lasted about 4 months before it started smoking and shop diagnosis was a cracked head. It had no coolant in it. So I gave him my VW beetle, decent condition but I had put over 200k miles on it. So while I don&apos;t exactly blame him, he has rendered 3 vehicles USELESS in less than a year. We ended up donating the truck, which brings me to my question.So, would insurance cover this? Is it too late to call? I don&apos;t want to pay a bunch of money to rebuild the engine and I don&apos;t know enough about cars to get the most out of them by selling for parts or anything like that. Can anyone offer me any advice? Thanks so much in advance!!

This Accord Has Expired Tags: Racers   Motorized   Multi   Launcher   Playset   with   Bonus   Cars   1299   Kidswootcom   The official &quot;Free Money for Test-Driving Cars&quot; thread I would like to alpha an Official Test-drive footstep here, because accomplishing test-drives is a acceptable antecedent of chargeless money for accomplishing nothing, and accepting all the advice in one abode would abundantly advice abounding humans who wish to participate. Unfortunately, test-drives are not offered actual generally these canicule as they acclimated to be in 2000-2001, however, if you adapt your test-drive action wisely, application all accessible names of people, cats, and dogs in your household, and aswell application all accessible home and business addresses area you can get mail, you can get a acceptable block of added money.For newbie FW-ers, here&apos;s a abrupt addition into test-drives.A test-drive is a advance active by a car architect (or sometimes a car dealer) which allows you to get some blazon of ability for advancing to a dealership and active a new car. The allowance is usually a allowance agenda to a store, or a prepaid allegation agenda (Ford, Lincoln, Mitsubishi), such as MasterCard or American Express. Sometimes (Nissan, Cadillac) they action a non-cash gifts, such as barbecue backpacks.The capital antecedent of accepting test-drive offers is award a test-drive affidavit in new car brochures, but don&apos;t bother acrimonious them up at the dealerships, because you will not acquisition annihilation inside. If you wish to get test-drive offers, you will accept to appeal brochures from car manufacturer&apos;s web-sites. So if you wish to alpha arena test-drive games, it would be a acceptable affair to alpha from. Once car manufacturers accept your address, you will alpha accepting clandestine test-drive offers, which are accessible alone for those who has already been in their commitment lists. Sometimes, you can acquisition new test-drive offers in newspapers or magazines, but those cases are actual rare.The action of demography advantage of test-drive accord is actual simple. You get a test-drive certificate, go to a dealership, and appearance it to a salesman. The salesman offers you to drive a car, and validates the affidavit usually but signing it, bushing out the dealer&apos;s code, and sometimes VIN amount of the car you were driving. Also, sometimes the salesman is declared to accord you his/her business card. Then you forward completed affidavit by fax or by mail, forth with the business agenda (if required) to the abode printed on the affidavit and patiently (no - I should say VERY PATIENTLY) delay for your allowance to access by mail. Of course, be abiding to accomplish copies of all affidavit afore sending them out. Sometimes (Cadillac) you don&apos;t accept to forward anything, because the allowance will be accustomed to you appropriate at the dealership.Important - amuse read. Actual generally the salesman will ask you upfront if you are in the bazaar for a new car. Amuse be honest, and acquaint him/her the truth. If you say that you came alone to get a gift, but are not traveling to buy a new car, they will be blessed to validate your affidavit after crumbling time on test-drive. In my claimed experience, 95% of the visits to altered dealerships appropriately concluded after accepting to test-drive cars.Even added important - aswell amuse read. Amuse understand, that test-drive offers, like abounding added types of promotions and deals getting discussed on this forum, are actual YMMV. That means, that even if two thousand fifty 5 humans in your adjacency accustomed a test-drive offer, it doesn&apos;t beggarly that you will get it too. Offers are getting beatific by car manufacturers randomly, depending on your state, city, age, antecedent history with the company, and, sometimes, the blush of your neighbor&apos;s cat. So if you accustomed a advertisement after any offer, amuse don&apos;t get mad, and of advance don&apos;t try to alarm the aggregation and appeal the offer!!! You can appeal addition brochure, sometimes it helps. If not - just canyon this action because there are others coming.
When you begin a new test-drive deal, amuse column it in the &quot;Quick summary&quot; area and don&apos;t overlook to bang this cilia so that subscribers could get alerts immediately Here are argument files with the banker codes for some brands:
