...the right way! Corporate Advocacy Program 
 Last night I stopped at Walmart with my daughter, her 3 friends, and my husband. We only had a few minutes to shop because we were going to watch a movie.

At the checkout we had a very slow and lazy checker. She was too lazy to walk around the counter to look at the barcode on a 40 lb. bag of dog food. So, my husband put it up on the counter for her.

As we were leaving, in a hurry, one of the greeters asked to see our receipt. We had already put it away and so we said sorry we are in a hurry. This big man comes out of the store and yells at us that we have to let her see the receipt. Then he follows us out into the parking lot. He is a Wal-mart manager. I told him I did not have to show it to her. He was angry and rude to me and my husband. I said if you want to see it you&apos;ll have to come to my car and check while we unload the cart. He said you don&apos;t have to show me and went back into the store.

In the meantime a crowd had gathered at the entrance and was watching us like we had stolen something. It was very humiliating. I work at a school and am well known in Opelousas. I was embarassed. I have told the door checker no before about seeing my receipt. They have been rude about it and even rolled their eyes about it but this was too much.

When I spoke to the store manager and asked that the dept. manager apologize to me the manager said that he was apologizing for him and that would be all he was willing to do. Sorry but that is not good enough for me.

If there is a lawyer out there who could tell me if I have any legal rights in this matter. I have never sued anyone in my life and I want no money, but I would love to make a point.

 You want to &quot;make a point?&quot; 

AUTHOR: Paul Pickle - Pony (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, December 21, 2003
 POSTED: Sunday, December 21, 2003 If you truly wanted to make a point, why didn&apos;t you simply SHOW YOUR RECEIPT upon request, rather than create an unnecessary SCENE?? YOU are the one and only person who caused yourself the embarrassment you encountered. What makes you so godly and special that YOU deserve to have all the rules bent in your favor? As you claim to be a well-known teacher, what would you think if one of your students so flat-out refused to do a simple thing that you asked him/her to do? You must be NUTS if you think this situation was not YOUR fault.

 You should have showed them receipt 

AUTHOR: Joey - Salem (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Wednesday, February 04, 2004
 POSTED: Wednesday, February 04, 2004 One I dont like what you said about the casher he/she must have been working all day and its not a easy job. The cashers can PICK up the 40 lb. bag of dog food for you and the fact the casher maybe did not have a screening gun to scan it. Now with the exit greeter its there JOB to check a persons receipt when a item dont have a bag.

 Do you shop Walmart often? 

AUTHOR: Amber - Cincinnati (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Wednesday, February 25, 2004
 POSTED: Wednesday, February 25, 2004 When in a hurry, you may try to make your trip go faster by preparing for the various shopping check out procedures.

Ever since my first visit to Walmart years ago I always keep my receipts handy as I walk out. It was a no-brainer way to be in a hurry at your local Wally world.

There are tons of thiefs that like to steal from Walmart and that is their second to last post of casual security. Thats how they say they keep their pretend low costs down. At the airports, you just can&apos;t walk around the metal detectors, can you?

This is just my suggestion to all Walmart shoppers: If you are in a hurry or just like convenience, keep your receipt handy. :)

 why not show the receipt? 

AUTHOR: Emily - Atkins (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Friday, February 27, 2004
 POSTED: Saturday, February 28, 2004 To be asked to show your receipt is not a sign of rudeness or disrespect, it is a policy of walmart and a cautionary action to prevent shoplifters. The only message I got out of your complaint is that you basically stole the dog food and didn&apos;t want to show your receipt to get caught. Isn&apos;t that what it sounds like? Show the stupid receipt so you can leave and go to your precious movie so the walmart employees don&apos;t have to wast their time chasing after you.

 #5 Consumer Suggestion

 You CANNOT be bullied into showing a receipt 

AUTHOR: Rosie - Pittsburgh (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Friday, April 16, 2004
 POSTED: Friday, April 16, 2004 First of all, you are not required by law to show a receipt. If you are leaving a store and they ask to see your receipt, you have the right to ask them if they are charging you with shoplifting.

You CANNOT be bullied into showing a receipt UNLESS it is clearly posted that the store reserves the right to search your belongings.

ASKING TO SEE THE RECEIPT IS THE SAME AS SEARCHING YOUR BELONGINGS. I&apos;ve taken an excerpt from a web page regarding searches:

1. Make it a point to not be cowed into consenting to the search. If they ask to inspect your purchases, ask them if they suspect you of doing anything illegal. This establishes that they do or don&apos;t have cause to stop you. Remember; once you&apos;ve paid for your purchases and they&apos;ve accepted the payment, you are carrying personal property and they have cannot search you unless they have probable cause such as evidence of shoplifting. [THIS IS IMPORTANT!]

2. If they admit that they don&apos;t have cause, tell them you don&apos;t consent to being searched and leave. If they press the issue, remind them that the Fourth Amendment guarantees your right against illegal searches. If they try to restrain you, don&apos;t fight them or put up a physical struggle. Ask to speak to the most senior manager of the store immediately.

Point out to him or her the illegality of the situation and ask if they&apos;re prepared to defend their actions in a court of law.

It irks me that these big corporations think they can get away with crap like this. Best Buy is notorious for it as well.

Don&apos;t worry about &quot;making a scene&quot;-you have the right to!!! The manager does not.

Good luck in the future-don&apos;t listen to what these people say about it being your fault.

 They Simply Don&apos;t Trust Their Employees 

AUTHOR: John - Memphis (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Saturday, April 17, 2004
 POSTED: Saturday, April 17, 2004 I first came across this tactic in the early 90s at CompUSA. Supposedly, the reason for the receipt check was to make sure you &apos;got what you paid for&apos;. Well, the problem with that is that the person checking the receipt would have to have ALL the prices of ALL the merchandise memorized so that he would know if an item was incorrectly priced. So much for that reasoning.

After I saw the same tactic being used at Sams Club I figured out the reason for the check is twofold. First, they mark the receipt so that it can&apos;t be reused. Secondly, they always give a look at the &apos;big ticket&apos; mechandise and check the price. They have to check that an employee at the register hasn&apos;t lowballed the price for an accomplice. With scanners being used these days that makes this a pretty rare happening, UNLESS they feel their inventory system may have a bad price in it, either accidentally or intentionally.

Contrary to popular propaganda it does NOT prevent shoplifting. Shoplifted items are usually placed in a persons pockets or worn. A receipt check would only thwart someone trying to shoplift a large item like a TV or refrigerator.

On a positive spin, it could prevent someone from leaving where the clerk has forgotten to give them a receipt. I&apos;d certainly appreciate that but only in that case. Actually, a nice reminder sign at the exit would suffice.

The stores figure its cheaper to have an individual do this at the exit rather than do it at each register. Fortunately, as Rosie indicated, it&apos;s strictly a VOLUNTARY requirement unless they have reserved the right to search your bags/cart. That does NOT include the right to seizure, even of a sales receipt.

A store MUST reserve the right to search before you ENTER the store. The notice cannot be posted in the store or at the exit but rather BEFORE you enter.

 #7 Consumer Suggestion

 I realy think your thoughts are wrong. 

AUTHOR: John - White (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Monday, July 12, 2004
 POSTED: Monday, July 12, 2004 First of all they are not searching your person. I have been in stores where the receipt checker found that the wrong item was rung up on the receipt. I had paid more than I should have. He escorted me to the customer service desk where they rang everything up correctly and refunded me the amount I overpaid.

Son of a gun if one of those scanners didm&apos;t make a mistake. A scratch on a barcode can ring it up wrong.

If you don&apos;t like your receipt checked then I hope that you don&apos;t belong to a warehouse store because they all do it. In these stores you don&apos;t leave without your receipt checked. What is the big deal about them checking your receipt and looking in your cart? The store hav every right to protect itself.

 DON&apos;T SHOW THEM ANYTHING !!!! I DON&quot;T !!! 

AUTHOR: Kevin - Shreveport (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Saturday, August 07, 2004
 POSTED: Saturday, August 07, 2004 You don&apos;t have to show the store employeee NOTHING! You have BOUGHT&amp;PAID FOR your merchandise, and unless they are going to accuse you of shoplifting, you don&apos;t have to show them nothing. I ran in to this once @ Wallyworld. The checker made the mistake of GRABBING MY ARM and trying to pull me back into the store, the whole time SCREAMING FOR SECURITY.... The &quot;manager on duty&quot; then prevented me from leaving the store until i was willing to show my receipt to him.

No problem... the wonders of CELL PHONES, a call by me to 911 promptly brought the police to the store. I explained to the officer what had happened, and after his comment &quot; we&apos;re a little sick of this thing with walmart taking up our time&quot; He promptly advised the store manager that If i wanted to.. He could be charged with UNLAWFUL DETENTION for preventing me from leaving the store nd the &quot; checker was given a summons ( technically arrested and promised to appear in lieu of being taken to the detemtion center ) for ASSAULT for grabbing my person and trying to pull me back intot the store. i LOVED THE ATTENTION I WAS GETTING FROM THE CROWD AND THE SCENE THE EMPLOYEES WERE CREATING.... I GOT 11 WITNESS&apos;S NAMES AND ADDRESSES FROM IT !!!! To make a long story short... WALLYWORLD settled for a nice chunk of change rather than go to court and have this whole ugly incident in the media here, as they were being fought by citizens at the time who were objecting to TWO new supercenters they was trying to get permits for to be built ( we now have 6 of these shitboxes in town )...

YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SHOW ANYTHING!!! I don&apos;t care WHAT wal mart&apos;s &quot;rules&quot; are. You do NOT work for wal mart, you have PAID for your merchandise and have passed the payment point and have obtained a receipt. IN THE WORDS OF OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERE ( THAT WERE RELAYED TO WALMART CORPORATE BY SAME ) When the item was PAID FOR at a company cash stand and a receipt was issued TITLE TO SAID ITEM PASSED TO ME... THE CUSTOMER.... Therefore it is now MINE and I don&apos;t have to let Walmart or anyone else see what&apos;s in my bag. Hell the Police who responded told the Manager HE COULDN&apos;T EVEN LOOK IN MY BAGS unless the manager was willing to charge me with shopliftng!...So I have law enforcement telling me THEY can&apos;t look in my bags for no reason and you think I HAVE to let WALMART rent a DICKs look in it for no reason???? It&apos;s still america people. Walmart Does NOt set the rules for citizens. I WALK RIGHT PAST THEM EVERYTIME THEY SAY THEY NEED TO SEE IN MY BAGS.... I HOPE THEY REPEAT THIS AGAIN...I&apos;m about due for another new car and would be happy to use WALMART&apos;S MONEY again to pay for it!!!!

STICK UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS! THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEE NOTHING YOU HAVE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR !
ENFORCE IT !

 Amen brother! 

AUTHOR: Robert - Hubert (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, August 08, 2004
 POSTED: Monday, August 09, 2004 The problem most people in this country(52% according to the 2000 election) have is they were all educated by public schools and look to someone else to help them. You people all live in the USA. Show it. When someone wants to SEARCH you and YOUR belongings, tell them NO! If they persist, call the police. You will be amazed what you were nevr taught in public school. The government cannot force you to be searched nor can the police without &quot;probable cause&quot;.

This must be PROVABLE in court in order for a Judge to issue the warrant. Having a Walmart greeter say you were rude to him/her is NOT justification in any jurisdiction for a search warrant to be issued. I have not wasted my time in Walmart since they started doing this. I find stores like Target and K-Mart sell the same stuff in CLEAN stores without any of the stupidity that goes with Wally World. I like shopping and spending MY(not the governments) money at stores that treat me like a customer, not a shoplifter who just hasn&apos;t been caught yet.

The fact that prior to my response on this, the count is 4-5 against searching unlawfully. The majority of you think it&apos;s okay to be searched by anyone for any reason. How scary.

 Let me Get this straight, A company has no rights to protect itself. 

AUTHOR: John - Whitr (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Tuesday, August 10, 2004
 POSTED: Wednesday, August 11, 2004 You would rather be an asshole and make a scene and hopefully line your own pockets than to let the store verify you paid for something?

What do you do when you pay for an item that is outside the store and a person who would help you load it wants to see verification that you paid for it before he helps you load it. Do you call 911 and try to sue the store for that too?????

Why dial 911. You caused the police to not be available for real emergencies. There was ni emergency involved so just call the police. As a taxpayer I had to pay also for your abuse of the &quot;EMERGENCY&apos; System.

It&apos;s assholes like you that drive up the costs for all of us. Sure Walmart paid you some money, but they don&apos;t pay for it. All the consumers do.

Thanks for raising my cost of living and for raising my taxes to pay for your abuse of the 911 system.

 Thank You very much ! 

AUTHOR: Kevin - Shreveport (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Wednesday, August 11, 2004
 POSTED: Wednesday, August 11, 2004 Thank you you SHEEP ! It&apos;s people like YOU who just do whatever they tell you without even thinking that has screwed the country up the way it is now. When you just follow along like a SHEEP and do what they tell you, even though they may be WRONG or may be violating your rights bestowed by the Constitution, You remember that one about &quot; illegal search&quot;??? It&apos;s no one&apos;s business what&apos;s in my bags including WALMART&apos;S!.

When you start letting corporations trample on your rights and do as they please, and you agree to follow along just to &quot; go with the flow&quot; then what good is the constitution?

WHY would you let someone nose through your PAID FOR ITEMS after they became YOUR possessions just &quot;in case&quot; you may have stolen something and put it in your bag???? You don&apos;t see a problem with this?

Maybe the fast food restaurant will search your pockets next time to see if you took too many ketchup packets for your fries???

Or maybe you&apos;ll let the people at the chinese buffet search your purse or bags to see if you smuggled a piece of chicken out when you left???

Just because a company like walmart DOESN&apos;T TRUST their employees or their customers ( yup, that&apos;s why they do that ) is not MY problem, and it shouldn&apos;t be YOURS either. Walmart should find a better way to conduct business than searching people&apos;s packages in HOPES OF FINDING something you didn&apos;t pay for.

What it is is actually &quot; GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT&quot;

Think about it...

Have a great day,
and to the SHEEP of the world....stand up for your rights !

 POSTED: Thursday, August 12, 2004 I am Amanda, the sender of the initial comment. Since then I have spoken to Jeff Smith who is a district manager for Wal-Mart. He not only told me that I do not have to show my receipt, but he also told me that he has reprimanded the workers at the Opelousas store already for being a little too zealous in this area.

He had the store manager and the assistant manager meet with me and apologize which I do feel that I deserved. I know some people have written responses alluding to the fact that I might be a theif or that I think I am better than everyone else. That is exactly the point I am trying to make. I have never stolen anything in my life, and I don&apos;t appreciate anyone treating me like a criminal. I am not better than anyone else! I just don&apos;t think anyone should be treated this way.

Wal-mart should try implementing better training and screening of their employees instead of making the customers pay for their incompetence and lack of integrity. I like Wal-mart. I shop their all the time. That&apos;s why I refused to accept this behavior. Since I made this stand, I received an apology, the asst. manager who was so rude is polite and treats me like a valued customer (we should all be valued customers. We keep their doors open and their &quot;pockets lined&quot; with money), and I enjoy my shopping experience much more. By the way, I never show them my receipt, ever. I never will!!!

 POSTED: Wednesday, August 18, 2004 You go Amanda. I am proud of people like you and Kevin showing Walmart that you do not have to be pushed around. Just glad you are not teaching my kids, but if you were I would be sure to tell them they did not have to do the homework you assigned them because they are well known and popular. As to increasing the prices by letting the workers with their accomplices that sell high item stuff for little or nothing and walk by the screeners without showing their receipts to join your bandwagon then you should be teaching economics.

Heck, Kevin is even bragging about making money the old fashion way by suing. (If he got a check from Walmart I am sure he would not mind scanning it and putting it online so we can see that he is not full of it.) I guess when he runs low on his crack cocaine then he goes to Walmart or other stores to make some pocket change.

Bet he is mad at the lady from McDonalds for suing about getting burned with the coffee, if only because he did not think of it first. As to being a Sheep I would rather be sheep than what I think he is (which if I typed it I am sure my email would be deleted). I do not know how they can search us at the airports either. I mean I have paid for my ticket, have not broken the law and should be allowed to enter the plane without the harassment of having my body searched.

Same goes for customs when I enter the country from working overseas; every now and then they want to look in my luggage. I have already gone through their metal detector and they are breaking the law by looking into my luggage. Same thing goes for these post offices that now have metal detectors. What is with that??

If they cannot trust their workers to leave their handguns at home then they should try implementing better training and screening of their employees instead of making the customers pay for their incompetence and lack of integrity instead of unlawfully searching me when I walk into the post office to check my mail.

My major problems are the schools. What right do they have to put up metal detectors to illegally check our children for weapons? What right do they have to search lockers? What right do they have to force kids to wear the same outfits to a public school?

What right do they have for sending kids to detention for not following the rules set by their liberal teachers? Hey if we keep this up we will straighten out these lowlifes that want to take away our liberties. Thanks again for being a model for the kids you teach.

 Customer service, the Constitution protects people from what the Government can do to citizens... legistlated laws protect people from what companies can do. 

AUTHOR: Darren - Neenah (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Thursday, August 19, 2004
 POSTED: Thursday, August 19, 2004 John,
You are welcome for contributing to the additional cost to the 911 system and to the cost of living. I wish I had a way to send you your 1/2 a cent that it cost you personally. Can I just send you a check?

I do have a really difficult time with the checking the receipt thingy at Wal-Mart. I have been at the checkout lane right next to the exit. They watch as I have my items rang up and put into my cart... then as I walk the 10 feet towards them on my way out the door they want to see my receipt.

If I was that slick and that cool of a thief do you think I would be trying to steal something from Wal-Mart? $10.00 worth of dog food?

Part of the problem is that so many stores have a relationship of trust between themselves and their customers. They don&apos;t assume that each customer is trying to rip them off. Therefore, it is taken as a person affront to be accused to removing something from the store that wasn&apos;t paid for.

I would imagine that people with integrity feel slighted when being accused of stealing when they are simply out doing some shopping. Asking to see the receipt is exactly that... it is saying &quot;I don&apos;t trust you and I believe that you stole something, so I am going to check the receipt to see if I am wrong.&quot; There can&apos;t be any other way to interpret it.

I shop at a huge grocery store... it is so large that I have to walk through the produce department with my bags of groceries and no one stands at the door to check receipts.

Being the 900 lb gorilla like Wal-Mart leaves a bad taste in the mouth of people. There is a narrowing of choice for the consumer and if I need to pay an extra $0.20 for a few items by going to a competitor then I do.

As for Tom... I am sorry. I just don&apos;t get the whole &quot;L&quot;iberal teacher thing. I am a 40% disabled vet who is proud to have served to protect the things that we hold dear. I am also 2 semesters away from getting my teaching license for K-8th grade with my minor in social studies.

There is no litmus test saying that I have to be &quot;L&quot;iberal to get my license. Maybe it is just that &quot;L&quot;iberals are the only ones willing to do the work for the money that the &quot;C&quot;onservative wants to pay to educate the children? You are more than welcome to take the time to go to college and spend all those additional years and cost to educate the children the way you wish to.

I just love how some people can bring up the &quot;L&quot; word in any conversation and topic.

As far as customs, many items are considered contraband or have to have duties paid on them and these do not show up on metal detectors. Metal detectors are for security. As a &quot;C&quot;onservative I am sure that you would want to make sure that the government is enforcing the ban on illegal drugs, and other types of smuggling?

You have your &quot;C&quot;onservative government that you want, yet you still attack the &quot;L&quot;iberals and blame us? We don&apos;t stay up all night looking for ways to piss you off.

Tom, that McDonalds story is so old... and so distorted by people that get their news through e-mail chain letters. To keep from looking like an automaton I would suggest that you look up that ruling and learn the real story behind it so you won&apos;t continue to embarass yourself.

Oh, and finally to everyone else.... the Constitution protects people from what the Government can do to citizens... legistlated laws protect people from what companies can do.

Thanks,

 Darren is right 

AUTHOR: Thomas - Moscow (Russian Federation)

SUBMITTED: Thursday, August 19, 2004
 POSTED: Friday, August 20, 2004 Darren,
It is very interesting how you exaggerate every thing you write.
1. You are so smart that you were able to figure out that the 911 system cost John from Georgia ½ cent, even though you are from Wisconsin. One day you will have to explain how you came up with such an accurate figure.
2. Wal-Mart&apos;s in Wisconsin must me much smaller than the ones in Texas and Louisiana, since the checkout lane and the exit are only 10 feet apart (from your letter) in Wisconsin, so I do not even know why they need a register that prints a receipt. Just give them a calculator, notepad and a pen and let them write a receipt to save money.
3. Wisconsin must also have cheaper items if you only pay $10.00 for a 40 lb bag of dog food. Must not care about your dog and buy their generic wanna be dog food. I find it amusing that such a genius as you would come to the conclusion that they stopped her for one bag of dog food, which if that is the case then I must look more honest than her because they only stop me sometimes if I have bags of food. You have to explain to me how you concluded she had one 40 lb bag of dog food because I thought we were reading the same letter. I read that she stopped a Wal-Mart to SHOP. I read that they were going to home to watch a movie for her Daughter and 3 friends which told me that she probably was buy chips, soft drinks, popcorn and such. In my world it is an oxymoron (contradictory statement) to say you are bringing four children into Wal-Mart to SHOP for only a few minutes. She stated the cashier was slow. How would she get that impression over one item but granted you can get that impression over one item. She stated that if they wanted to see the receipt that they would have to follow them while they unloaded the cart. Hmmm sounds more than items of dog food to me but you are smarter so I will submit to your opinion.
4. I do agree with you about having a problem with the checking the receipt thingy at Wal-Mart and have many times had to dig my receipt out of my pocket to show it. But then I have to decide if I want to shop at the store that makes me show my receipt since I am not actually being forced to shop there. As to there being a narrowing choice of places to shop then that is because many people support Wal-Mart and they are able to get bigger due to our money. Now they are big, we want to cry that they are a 900 lb gorilla but we are the ones that fed and are still feeding the gorilla. I personally do not have a problem going to Wal-Mart other than finding a parking spot. Kind of wish all the people complaining would not shop there so I do not have to look so hard for a parking spot.

5. The McDonald&apos;s story that I think you are referring to would be STELLA LIEBECK v. MCDONALD&apos;S CORPORATION. I know you are so smart (you proved that with the 911 equation) but YOU do not even know the final settlement. Just so YOU do not embarrass yourself, you may want to review the case. She was awarded $2.7 M for punitive damages and $200,000 for compensatory damages. Due to the jury stating that McDonald&apos;s was 80% responsible, the $200,000 was placed at $160,000. The judge reduced the punitive award to $480,000 and added the $160,000 for a total of $640,000. Before both parties could appeal the decision, McDonald&apos;s went into secret negotiations and settled with Ms. Liebeck for an undisclosed amount. You do not know if her attorney (Reed Morgan) was able to settle for more or less than the reduced amount. Sorry, I forgot you are so smart that I am sure you do know how much.
6. Before we get on your soapbox about being a 40% disabled vet let me tell you my hardship story. At 27 I was in Middle-Upper Management of a fortune 500 company. I had the Midis Touch and everyone at my level of management was 50 or older and every one in management at one level below me was 40 or older. In 1991 I was struck down with Myasthenia Gravis. (covered under the Muscular Dystrophy group. You are born with it and it decides when to strike you down.) My company was nice enough to put me on involuntary sick leave (they thought it was stress.) and later let me go. (not actually, they just did not have a opening when I got better.) I was in the Army Reserve which was activated in Mid-1991 and when they found out that I was sick they gave me an honorable discharge for 10 years of faithful service (Nice of them since I had been with them for 10 years). In Nov. 1991 the doctors put me in the hospital to keep me alive and in December 1991 when they went to put me under the knife to remove my thymus gland, I contact the Army about medical assistance and was informed that I had a Honorable Discharge not a Medical Discharge and they could not help but they were nice enough to send my records with points earned so I could get a loan to buy a house if I wanted one. I will take medicine for the rest of my life, I get tired very easy and any day I can wake up and be right back in a wheelchair so I do not mind comparing sob stories. On the bright side, I built myself back up and have been (and continue) working overseas for another Petroleum Company that does not mind my illness and I have made it back to upper management.
7. Sorry to hear that you have such a problem with the word Liberal and have become so defensive. Hey if you hate liberals so bad then get over it, they have just as much right to be on this planet as anyone else does. (maybe in China but anyway back to your concerns) Since you do not get the “L”iberal teacher thing I will explain it to you. (Good thing you are not going to try to teach High School) Amanda made reference to working for the school. She did not say she was a teacher and I doubt she is because she would have been proud to say she was a teacher at an Opelousas School. While I was growing up (being reared) my mother was a school teacher and it is an honorable profession that has become politically charged over the years because they hire people like you to teach our kids. You have made it clear that you are a liberal and that is fine but I am a Moderate actually and that is fine. When I stated that she was a model for the kids she teaches I was referring to her daughter, her daughters friends and the kids at school that learn rules are not required by her actions. When she wrote the first letter I did not respond and gave her the benefit of the doubt. I felt that if she would have been alone or just with her husband that it would have been no problem showing the receipt. But since she was with her daughter and her daughters friends she had to show them how a big shot treats a LAZY casher and greeter that is stupid enough not to recognize her in front of the children. I did not reply until her second letter bragging how she would never show the receipt again and that now she was a valued customer. What a joke. As to the school system- When I see that a 5 year old child is kicked off a bus in the middle of town because she got on the wrong bus then I have a problem. When I hear about a teacher raping a child and getting there hands slapped I have a problem. I could go on all day about the problems in the Schools but this is supposed to be about Wal-Mart. I would love to give up my job and go back to college just to educate the children the way I want to but then you would lose my tax dollars and not be able to make money teaching the way you want to. I have a better plan. I seek private schools that I agree with the way they teach and send my kids there.

8. Darren, I am glad you compared customs to being opposite of Wal-Mart. Last I heard you go through customs because you voluntarily leave the country and return. (Save the story about having to leave the country for war if that is how you are disabled. I would love to hear about it but not as a comment of not leaving the country voluntarily. This is concerning people that voluntarily travel out of country on vacation.) Some people will have to prove that they do not have contraband or items that owe duty when they arrive back in country. Right, and if you do not leave the Country you do not have to submit to that rule. Same with Wal-Mart. They have (It is not enforced for everyone but mainly people that have a few items or more.) a rule that you have to show your receipt if you shop there. If you do not shop there you do not have to pay attention to the rule. But you would rather shop there and complain about the rules. Well to help you out I can give you some hints on breaking the rules. A) Go to a Movie Theater that does not let you bring food or drink into the theater. Hey you have already paid an arm and leg for the Movie and now they expect you to give your first child for the high price popcorn and coke. Get your wife or date (not recommend for first dates or could be hazardous to your health.) to make the popcorn at home and pour it in her purse. Wear a Jacket and put two 16 ounce cokes in the pocket so you have your drinks. It is only fair because you paid to see the movie and that should be all you are forced to pay for. IT IS A STUPID RULE ANYWAY Before you say they are not going to search me or cause problems then I suggest you overfill the purse with the popcorn showing and forget the 16 oz cokes, just walk in with a 32 oz. coke from Burger King and see what happens. B) You ever want to go to a fancy restaurant but just cannot afford it. Well all you do it get your date, go to McDonald&apos;s and get a Big Mac (save money and split the big mac) and fries. Put it under your coat and enter the restaurant to be seated. Once seated order one bottle of water (they will probably charge for the water.) After you get the water order two straws (wait until after you get the water to order the straws so they do not get suspicious) and pull out your food and Bon Appetite. They should not be able to make you leave since you are paying for the table by buying the water. Who would be stupid enough to make you leave when you have ordered something off their menus? C) If you really want to save money then get a hotel room (suite preferably) that will hold 8 people. Sublet it out to 6 people for discounted rates. (I know the hotel has rules that you cannot sublet but are those rules actually fair? I mean you paid for the hotel room and if it is not an All Inclusive Resort then you are getting what you paid for without needing the hassle of Hotel Management wanting more money.) The great deal about this is that you and your wife or date (may be last date) get the hotel room for free and if you play your cards right you may make some money. Let&apos;s face it, rules are meant to be broken especially stupid rules made up by 900 lb gorillas.
9. One thing I like about you is the fact that with you going to school to be a teacher, that you are teaching me all kinds of stuff. You state “the Constitution protects people from what the Government can do to citizens” and that taught me a lot. I was stupid enough to think the Constitution was formed to set the foundation for the Executive Branch, Judicial Branch and the Legislative Branch. Then I thought they created Amendments (otherwise known as the Bill of Rights) to the Constitution to give citizens or government guidelines to assist with democracy. XIII freed slavery but most of the time it was not the government going after slaves it was bounty hunters and such. XVIII made liquor illegal and allowed the government to come after the citizens so I do not know how that amendment protected the people from the government but you are the future teacher so I am here to learn. But making statements thinking the government is coming after you will have me thinking you are a Conservative. Never mind that last comment because you more than made up for it with the statements “legislated laws protect people from what companies can do.” Sorry teacher but I have a question. Are not legislated laws there to protect citizens and companies alike??? When I hear the term Shoplifting I automatically think “Store”. So here is a law that is protecting the store (company) from what the citizen can do. Anyway thanks for helping me better understand the Constitution and Legislated Laws.

In closing I must state that I have had problems with many stores, Airlines (especially their stupid Frequent Flier Mile rules), phone companies and other companies. But I have the right (Just ask Darren from Wisconsin) to decide whether I continue to do business with these companies and support them in making a profit. I agree that Wal-Mart may not be able to force us to shop there or show our receipt but I do not mind this because many times the greeter is smiling and sometimes I see some greeters that are not able to get other companies to hire them due to age or handicap. Therefore I smile, grit my teeth and dig for my receipt.
Have a great day.

AUTHOR: Darren - Neenah (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Friday, August 20, 2004
 POSTED: Friday, August 20, 2004 John,
Focus, Focus, Focus. I am getting dizzy from the tangents and wrong turns you are making. I will try to address them... maybe not in the order you wrote... Now... follow the bouncing ball...

1) The 40lb dog food was from the original post.
2) I am sorry, do you think that 1/2 of a cent was too much? Unless I am going to get into the entire tax base for the local police force (local, country, state and fed grants) I would have to estimate it pretty low. But if it wasn&apos;t low enough then you are welcome to research for a more accurate estimate.
3) Whether it matters or now... the 10 feet was the distance between where the person was standing and the cashier that was closest to the exit... please read it much more carefully. &quot;... as I walk the 10 feet towards them on my way out the door they want to see my receipt.&quot; Inane and falls under the &quot;Who cares? Unless you are trying to use it as a means to discredit what I am saying.&quot; Also, since you are worried about particulars... it was in Colton, CA. Not Wisc.
4) Actually, I don&apos;t have a dog and I have no idea what the dog food costs. If $10 is too low then you are more than welcome to make a point of that. Can you state an amount that is high enough to make it worth stealing?
5) In number 7 you are stating that &quot;if I hate liberals so much...&quot; then you go and tell me that I am bviously a liberal... Which do you think I am?
6) I am not sure what all that about the movie theater hotel was about... I couldn&apos;t see how that was relevant to the discussion. Apples to apples please.
7) You are right about the Bill of Rights versus the Constitution. However, I was replying to people saying that they have a Constitutional right to privacy... and because something is amended to a document... I would think that it is now part of the document which is now amended. But, that is semantics. I will make sure to emphasis this when I teach. It is kind also like the whole libel versus slander thing... correcting the person doesn&apos;t take away the effect just because the person didn&apos;t use the right term. I stand corrected and will be much more precise in the future.
8) I love your ability to take a firm grasp of the inane and make that the basis of your argument. If you can&apos;t argue the point of the discussion then you go and try to attack whether it was 1/2 a cent or 2 cents or 3 cents... or the cost of a bag of dog food. Deflecting from the point and very disingenous.
9) Mentioning the laws protecting consumers was again addressed towards the point of what a store can and can&apos;t do in regards to the customer&apos;s privacy... of course there are laws protecting companies from the customer.... but that wasn&apos;t the focus of my statement and I saw no need to cover every aspect of relationships that have laws.
10) Liberal agendas in teaching. Again, I will state that there isn&apos;t a litmus test for political affiliation when you go for a teaching license. If there are so many liberals that are teaching, why do you think that is so? Since it is the family values party of the Republicans, don&apos;t you think that they would want to be part of the solution and become teachers too?
11) School policies, curriculum and standards are set by state school departments and local school boards. Teachers get to choose how they will teach within these guidelines.
12) John, I too have an illness that many are debilitated by and I have been able to continue to work onwards. Again, you missed the point that I am not some arm chair liberal that is willingly giving away all that we hold dear for some socialistic/communist reason. That liberals are quite capable of being patriots and proud of their service. This was in response to John and people like him (Ann Coulter) that equate liberals and the democratic party to traitors.
13) You are right about choice. I choose not to shop at Wal-Mart about 90%, plus or minus 20% (so you don&apos;t get stuck on the minutia). I like the way that other stores don&apos;t take a customer for granted. With customs you mentioned choice, the person needed to have his bags checked for a reason. I stated a couple of reasons. Now, you are turning it around as if I am saying that they don&apos;t have a right? I will have my bags checked at customs (I chose to leave and reenter the country) I don&apos;t choose to be considered a thief until proven innocent (thus my reluctance to shop at Wal-Mart) What part of that don&apos;t you understand?
14) A 900 lb gorilla that earns their position based on competition has earned their right to market share. Instead, they demand tax breaks and then drive down wages.
15) Thank you for doing the research for McDonalds. You proved my point. People use that case as an example of tort law being out of control. You showed exactly what I was saying. That the woman didn&apos;t get the whole amount, there was sufficient damages for an awarding of damages (you can argue that McD&apos;s paid to stop the expense of the suit or that they knew they were liable and cut their losses)... but you did prove my point. It wasn&apos;t a frivolous lawsuit that people want to try to make it.
16) I am sorry if I came off as intelligent. I should have just put everything down as a conspiracy by some political party that I am upset at. Or, questioned some other non-relevant portion to discredit everything.

Thank you for the past 20 mintues of entertainment. Ooops. Actually, it was closer to 18 1/2.

John can answer this but do you mind if I help him answer it too? As an normal “L” you seem to change wording to help your dizziness. Hard to follow a ball that has no air but here you go.

1. “The 40lb dog food was from the original post”. Post stated “SHOPPING and other things but you missed that.
2. ½ cent seemed fair to me. But I must admit that I am not smart enough to figure it out due to the fact that I do not know how long the police were detained or other circumstances.
3. I agree with you on item three. Who cares? If you are so worried about particulars then how did I become John and why did you list Darren - Neenah, Wisconsin on your letter. You are not hiding from the authorities or any special hospitals are you Darren are what ever your alias is?
4. Don&apos;t worry I do not have a dog either anymore. It could not take me going overseas 28 days at a time and dumped me. Talking about my dog not my ex.
5. LOL I know you are a Liberal I was just baiting you and it worked.
6. Did not figure you would understand the movie theater hotel issue because people like you never do. Only complain about rules you do not like.
7. Thanks for being more precise in the future.
8. Hey just glad you love what I do. I aim to please and glad I was able to help you. Unless you were being sarcastic with that remark and then may I say I resemble (not misspelled or wrong word) that remark. LOL
9. Do not worry about item 9. By the time I got to that part of the response I had realized that you generalize a lot.
10. They would love to become teachers but then we could not afford to support people like you. (No this comment is not directed a teaching more directed at you and not in a mean way.)
11. Why are we even discussing schools? I agreed to pay extra to send my children to private schools and you still get my taxes to pay for the public schools so why are we on the subject?
12. The name it Tom not John. Never said Liberals are not Patriots. Even heard a rumor that John F. Kennedy served in the military in World War II but keep that under your hat. Will not get into politics on this Wal Mart site but would be glad to discuss it on another site that is not taking time away from Amanda&apos;s logical complaint.

13. Sorry do not have time to argue this one because you obviously do not understand.
14. How did you determine it was a 900 lb gorilla. May have been 850 lbs, hmmm and now you are giving credit where credit is not due. Sorry but I had to bait you just once again. :-)
15. I am glad she did not get the whole amount or else my Big Mac&apos;s would have skyrocketed. So there was sufficient damage to give an 81 year old lady 2.9 million. Lord you are not a liberal. You make liberals look like a conservatives.

16. Trust me, do not worry about it, you did not come off as intelligent. I was just baiting you.

17. If I got you this worked up over a response then lord have mercy on you when you start teaching and the 8th graders get through with you. LOL

Well it has been real and it has been fun but it has not been real fun.

Your new best buddy since we seem to be correcting each other on the Delta site.
Have a great day,

 Just want to share my obsevations 

AUTHOR: Pat - Gilbert (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Saturday, August 21, 2004
 POSTED: Saturday, August 21, 2004 I am writing this rebuttal only to share my observations about Wal-Mart, Sam&apos;s Club, COSTCO, etc. I am not, nor ever have been an employee of any of these establishments.

The only time I have ever seen an employee at Wal-Mart want to check a receipt as a customer is exiting the store was for two reasons:

1) The security sensor alarm was activated (not the most reliable pieces of equipment, by the way), and

2) The customer was exiting with a large ticket item (such as a TV, computer, furniture, etc) that was NOT WRAPPED IN A BAG.

Never have I observed a customer having their bags checked for any other reason, and I shop there at least once a week. I agree that bags should not be checked without due cause. Even though checking the receipt for the big ticket items pushes the line, I applaud them for doing so. It seems to keep prices down, which I enjoy.

As for all the wholesale clubs, you will notice that none of your items are placed in a bag. Therefore the necessity to check the receipt as most of the items are big ticket anyway.

Don&apos;t get me wrong. I agree that what happened in the original post is wrong. Wal-Mart should better train employees to realize that if a customer refuses to show a receipt upon request, then the matter should not be pushed by the employee.

These are my observations of having shopped at Wal-Mart for the past 12 years. I&apos;m glad that their prices are so low.

My 2 cents.

 Wow.. explained store policy with a little more tact 

AUTHOR: Melanie - Hazel Green (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, August 22, 2004
 POSTED: Monday, August 23, 2004 This has gotten completely out of hand. Not only are some of you showing your complete ignorance, you are also taking one letter that only needed some constructive criticism.

Darren and *was it John or Tom*, tried have a battle with wits and both lost.

I have been in retail for a very long time, that in no point excuses a lazy cashier, but only to try to let some people see how completely rude most people are to *the lowest working class folks* in the nation.

I am also a consumer, and I dont want to be treated unfairly. Here is one point, the store manager should have taken her aside *instead of yelling at her in front of other shoppers* and explained store policy with a little more tact.

Even though I have been in management, I have kept a civil tongue in my mouth when it comes to rude customers.

She may not be required by law to show her receipt, but she could&apos;ve also shown a little more tact and tried to make a good example of herself in front of young children, her being a teacher and all.

I have been to wal-mart plenty of times and I have only been asked to show my receipt after leaving when I was buying mulch. Or if the security door rings. Yes, it is embarassing for that thing to bleat like a mad goat and everyone looking at you.

To the person who orginally started this whole mad dash, sorry you had to deal with a rude store manager, but shame on you for causing a scene that was very unnecessary.

And that, is the end of the story... Good day!!

 Improperly educated 

AUTHOR: Rosco - Buena Park (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, August 22, 2004
 POSTED: Monday, August 23, 2004 Hello.

For several years now, I&apos;ve known that people have no right to search you upon exit of their store without formally accusing you of shoplifting. This is an issue of the law in nearly every state as far as I know (I am not a lawyer). Unfortunately not everyone is interested in the laws of personal rights as a hobby.

The vast majority of employees both at Walmart and at other stores are ignorant of the law on this issue. The training for Walmart does clearly inform our door greeters what they can and cannot do according to the law, and they are supposed to act accordingly.

Not everyone is perfect - some greeters overstep their bounds and fail to respect the customer&apos;s lawful rights either through overzealousness to enforce what they see as Walmart&apos;s policy (forgetting their training), or because they are actually mistaken in thinking the law is on their side.

The manager, on the other hand, should absolutely have known better, and I wholly expect he will be reprimanded severely for having costed the company both money and bringing it bad publicity.

I agree that a scene did not need to have been made here, but sometimes a scene is what it takes to get companies to be more respectful of your rights. Perhaps now the Walmart greeter and manager training will feature this lawful right more prominantly than before as a result.

 Why wal-mart asks to see your receipt 

AUTHOR: Michelle - Regina (Canada)

SUBMITTED: Saturday, August 28, 2004
 POSTED: Sunday, August 29, 2004 Ok this is a very simple process for wal-mart. When a customer purchases some merchandise from a wal-mart location but it is not put into a bag or anything to show that it has in fact been scanned at the check-out, the cashier then highlights the item on the receipt and tells the customer that they must show their receipt to the greeter upon leaving the store. This will show the greeter that the customer has purchased the item. This is the only time that wal-mart will ever ask to see the receipt of a customers. If the dog food was somehow tagged (with a sticker or someting) then the greeter would notice this and not ask to see the receipt. It is very simple and it makes perfect sense to me. IF all your merchandise is bagged up then you are free to walk out of the store...receipt or no receipt. How does this not make sense??? Geesh, some customers just like to complain soo much. Imagine purchasing a tv from electronics or something. You wouldn&apos;t be able to fit that in a bag and if you&apos;re leaving the store with a tv in hand, just walking out, of course the greeter would be asking to see the receipt. They aren&apos;t suspicious of you but it is part of their job. That&apos;s all i have to say about this topic because i am sooo sick of hearing people complain.

 Not all Walmarts are like this 

AUTHOR: Deb - Leesburg (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, August 29, 2004
 POSTED: Monday, August 30, 2004 I live in Virginia, have been shopping at Walmart for years. Have bought large bags of dog food, cat food and even plants. Never have the employees ever put tags on them. I have even set off the alarm before, looked at the employee standing there and she waved me on because she SAW me coming from a checkout lane. Now just maybe the employees and managers here are trained better or the crime rate is lower but we have NEVER once been asked to see our receipt. I will say that the Walmart we shop at does NOT have the self checkout counters like the newer ones do closer to D.C. Since we live further out, I guess the crime rate is lower. I have been to a Walmart about 20 minutes away from us, where the crime rate is a bit higher and yes there are 3 people standing at the exits, however they DO have self checkout there. We attempted self checkout that day and refuse to go back to that store ever again just because of that thing. It does not properly weigh the contents of the bags, we had to get a manager to come override the system twice and we were there twice as long as needed. Now, when I need to go to Walmart I go to our local one and have no problems whatsoever. To the individual who posted the originial post, I am so sorry you went through what you did. I am positive that the original owner never had this in mind when he came up with the idea of Walmart!

 POSTED: Sunday, October 24, 2004 Geeeeeeeeez, it is not EVEN 5 (five) minutes out of your life to pause at the door and be courteous (some of our Mama&apos;s taught us this virtue) to the door greeter who is simply doing his/her job.

FIVE MINUTES!! Just pause, flash your receipt and off you go!! :)

I have zero problem with complying with this request/policy/procedure. As I have not stolen anything or somehow defrauded the store my concience is clear and I have no problem allowing them to see the contents of my bag if they so desire.

I dont have a paranoia about some big corporate conspiracy to take away the rights of the consumer via making us all endure unlawful search/seizure procedures at the door to our favorite mainstream retailer.

I see it for what it is; a teeny little request to check bags, which is only being asked in order that the door greeter wont get him/herself ripped out by management for not doing it.

If thats all it takes Im happy to do my part to help a fellow person out.

Theres my two cents. Have a great week!

Do you relize how busy Wal-Mart is? We cannot
watch every customer check out, so we have to
check the items at the door. All you had to do
was show him the reciet and he would have told
you to have a nice day (night) and you would have

 It can save money consumer just needs to cooperate with the retailer so that in the long run the consumer benifts with the company. 

AUTHOR: Ada - Knoxville (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Tuesday, March 22, 2005
 POSTED: Tuesday, March 22, 2005 John,

I understand that this discussion has been going on for quite some time now but I had to throw in my two cent. I used to work front end at Wal-Mart. Every now and then I would ask to see a reciept as someone was walking out the door just to check. One day a woman came up with a buggy filled to the rim with bags. I stopped her and asked for her reciept. Her response? Oh, it&apos;s at the bottom of the pile. I told her I had all day. Then she stated that she had bought this stuff back in layaway and they didn&apos;t give her a reciept. I told her she could go back to layaway and get it (Layaway purchases have a pink security tag that front door associates or cashiers remove - you don&apos;t just buy items in layaway). She turned the buggy around and headed to the back of the store.

At this time I promptly got on the phone and notified the auto department and garden department to keep an eye out for this woman because there seemed to be something wrong with the picture. The garden department informed me that they had already had her back there and when she couldn&apos;t provide a reciept she went back into the store.

We found the buggy, unattended and still full with bags, at store closing. The total for everything in the buggy was close to $400.00. That is a savings to the company and consumers. I have also witnessed a customer attempting to buggy out a computer and when asked for a reciept he simply ran.

While providing the reciept may upset you or inconvience you it doesn&apos;t take much to hold it in your hand as you leave the store. The incidents above happen on a daily basis in retail stores and sometimes the consumer just needs to cooperate with the retailer so that in the long run the consumer benifts with the company.

 Searches are still illegal 

AUTHOR: Steven - Salt Lake City (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Tuesday, April 05, 2005
 POSTED: Tuesday, April 05, 2005 No matter how you slice it, it still seems to me like an illegal search until you give your consent. They have a right to ask, and then I have a choice as to whether I should comply or not. Then everyone deals with the consequences. I shop at stores with search policies as little as possible, then I know to either be prepared to get all riled up, or I just submit like an innocent, cowering dog, waiting to be punished or rewarded by his master/owner/caretaker. I don&apos;t like that feeling, but evidently it doesn&apos;t bother some. Costco and Sam&apos;s club build the right into their membership policies and so I assume can strip/deny your membership on past behavior if you have been a nuisance in the past. Although, I really wonder if that would stand up in court? It may just be worth finding out in small claims court! As for non-membership requiring places of business, I know that they can ban customers from coming on their property. But would their banning me because I refuse to show a receipt be a legally defensible ban? One way to find out! I just wish I had the guts/time.

I do agree with you that the cashier should not worry about her pretty little self and she should drag her butt over to the dog food with the portable scanner that they have or pick it up herself and put it on the conveyor belt and scan it her damn self. However I disagree with you as to your not wanting to comply with the rules and show your receipt to the door greeter, that is their job, I mean do you actually think Wal-Mart would spend money for them to just be at the door and look cute??? Think Again... Maybe when you went to school and before becoming a teacher you rode the short school bus to school everyday or something... I agree, you are a teachers are supposed to set examples and also leadership. It&apos;s not anyone&apos;s fault at that store you were all in a hurry.

 Most stores have a Loss Prevention to catch shoplifters and door greeters to ask for receipts.

 POSTED: Tuesday, April 05, 2005 To people that have a problem with search policies, You shouldn&apos;t...

Most stores have a Loss Prevention to catch shoplifters and door greeters to ask for receipts. This is how they keep some of the costs down and pass it off to the consumers.

You would NOT believe the amount of stuff that gets stolen, and believe it or not just ine ONE DAY...

So suck it up and show your receipts. If you have nothing to worry about, then you should have no problem with it.

I am so honest, that last week I was in Wal-Mart and I got home and noticed that in all my stuff that the cashier didn&apos;t scan one of my video games that I bought. So upon my next trip to Wal-Mart I went and got the same video game off the shelf and took it with the rest of my purchases and told them what had happened. I told her she needed to just scan the game and to keep it. Even though it was in their error, everyone can make a mistake, but that loss that was corrected, I know is a small amount to Wal-Mart, but every little bit adds up.

 What &quot;rules&quot; ???? This is NOT Sam&apos;s Club 

AUTHOR: James - New York (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Wednesday, April 06, 2005
 POSTED: Wednesday, April 06, 2005 John says: &quot;However I disagree with you as to your not wanting to comply with the rules&quot;

Get a clue John, there are no rules! This is NOT Sam&apos;s Club where you agree to their T&amp;C;&apos;s of membership. This is simply a retail store and they do NOT have the right to see your receipt, they do NOT have the right to detain you, and they do NOT have the right to &quot;inspect all packages&quot;.

My advice to anyone caught in a similar situation is to immediately ask &quot;are you accusing me of shoplifting?&quot; Then inform them that unless you are allowed to leave at once, that you will be calling the police yourself - and then do it. Remember, no crime has been committed here and you cannot be held arbitrarily - even by Barney the LP Deputy.

Finally, your typical canned corporate answer fails to mention that most of the losses (4 to 1) come from employees, whom the &quot;greeters&quot; have no impact on whatsoever. So much for your rationale.

 POSTED: Wednesday, April 06, 2005 James, you are totally entirely right and I admit that to everyone that has made a posting on this section that most losses do come from &quot;INTERNAL THEFT&quot; which I believe is the terminology that your looking for since you seem to be the &quot;GOD&quot; of Loss Prevention. Since your so knowledgeable of Loss Prevention, tell everyone below my posting what the statistics of shoppers are shoplifters? DID WE SEEM TO FORGET the Winona Ryder and Shelley Morrison whom plays Rosario on Will&amp;Grace that both arrested for shoplifting?

Maybe YOU need to brush up on your L.P. Statistics dude. There is always someone out there who wants to be the rule breaker or the person that finds the loop holes to break progress and hold up everyone else. With a successful Loss Prevention team you can cut down on external theft, and internal thefts including down to employees doing a passoff of items at the register.

I also agree totally that you dont have to show them anything at the door, I will sooooooo very much admit that totally, but thats pretty much the only thing your right about. What the hell is the big deal, they arent asking you to strip down naked or asking you to empty out your pockets, or even asking you for a pint of blood.

You are just a rebellious person who likes to shake stuff up that really doesnt matter. What happens if a cashier forgets to deactiave an EAS tag at the register and the gates go off as your exiting the store? What are you going to do then??? Sue for Mental Anguishment&amp;Embarrassment??? By YOU JAMES - New York, New York; or ANYONE ELSE, your only causing a scene yourself and acting like a damn little two year old for not getting your way.

And then he cites examples of celebrities shoplifting as some sort of justification for his ridiculous arguments. OK John, fair enough.

Never mind that the 4th Amendment prevents that. It must be so per the &quot;Logic Of John&quot;.

But that&apos;s to be expected from someone who tries to elevate his shopping at WalMart by suggesting I go to some other &quot;lesser&quot; stores he names. I&apos;m not familiar with them John, but I&apos;ll gladly take your word for it. Up here we shop at Whole Foods and Saks.

Wal mart is just protecting its self. Dispite popular opinion the door greeter aint there just to give your kids a smily face sticker. But as I said, there doesnt seem to be anypoint in arguing with the trouble makers that would rather cause a scene and then point the finger at walmart.

 Cashiers lifting dog food. 

AUTHOR: C - Quakertown (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, April 24, 2005
 POSTED: Sunday, April 24, 2005 I am not going to address the legal debate surrounding greeters checking receipts, which has been talked to death. I do, however, have to say something about the alleged &quot;lazy&quot; cashier who would not pick up a bag of dog food.

A Wal-mart cashier averages around 250 customers a day. Every single one of them might potentially buy a 40lb bag of dog food, or cat litter, a stereo, a DVD player, or something otherwise awkward and heavy. You can bet a smart cashier is not going to bust her back lifting these items unless absolutely necessary. How many 40lb bags of dog food is your husband lifting every day?

Since your husband was clearly physically fit enough to lift the bag onto the belt, he should show a little common courtesy and haul his own junk. Wal-mart is mostly a self-serve retailer. You take your own crap off the shelves and carry it out to your own cars, unless you are ill, handicapped, or too weak to do so. Cashiers are not obligated to unload your carts for you.

As a cashier I once had a woman and her teenage son bring up a cart full of heavy items into my line. As I scanned and bagged the lot, they wheeled their cart around to the side of my register as if expecting me to load it for them. The teenage son stood back and leaned against the soda machine, rolling his eyes and trying to look cool. I stacked all the bags on the cart loading station next to my register, finalized the transaction and moved on to the next customer. The kid finally got the hint and started loading his mother&apos;s cart.

You can tell me which of us was lazier: the sulking kid or the cashier who had already scanned, sorted, bagged, and stacked it all. Then I&apos;ll tell you which of us had been standing for eight hours and lifting, scanning, sorting, bagging, tendering, and smiling for self-absorbed consumers who get their panties in a wad because their cashiers try to avoid breaking their backs.

 Wake up if you know anything about Wal-Mart history 

AUTHOR: L - Springdale (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Friday, April 29, 2005
 POSTED: Friday, April 29, 2005 First of all, if you know anything about Wal-Mart history, you would know that a door greeter was not origionally implemented as a theft deterant or a GUARD at the door. A door greeter was implemented by Sam Walton simply as it states, a Greeter. A door greeter was implemented to greet you, ask you how your day has been and to welcome you to Wal-Mart. Yes they now have the job of stamping your return items when you walk in the door and checking your reciepts on large ticket items and non bagged items as you walk out the door. If it was your store you would want it done to protect you also. People walk out of stores (including Wal-Mart) everyday with items that they did not pay for. This in its self raising the already high prices that keep rising in EVERY part of life on a daily basis.

The sad part about all of this is that instead of taking the five minutes to show your reciept at the door you have completely humiliated a store employee that had to do his or her job, by throwing a fit.

A door greeter is probably the lowest paid job at Wal-Mart, they are simply not paid enough to have to deal with jerks all day long, but they do. Have you ever stopped and told your cashier or door greeter to have a nice day.

A simple nice comment to them also makes their day easier. Most of all, the majority of door greeters are elderly associates working part time to supplement their income. I have enough courtesy to respect my elders. I know I dont HAVE to show my reciept, but why embarrass myself and everyone around me by throwing a fit. That solves nothing.

If you have your own children, did you teach them that temper tantrums, or to defy authority are okay? If not, then why is this behavior okay from you?

Our local Wal-mart and others that I have visited have actual Police officers at the door as the &quot;greeter&quot; during certain hours, would you tell the police officer no if he or she was to ask for your reciept.

And yes, the 911 call that is rediculous. Kind of like the lady who called 911 in regards to her &quot;Western Burger&quot; being made improperly. 911 is an EMERGENCY number, to be used in case of an EMERGENCY. Yes the use of that number improperly makes emergency personnel unavailable for those who truely need their assistance.

Furthermore, their time does cost us tax payers money. Regardless if it is a half cent or not, half cents add up over time. This is done all over our country many times aday, simply wasting our money. People complain when gas goes up a cent or two, why not complain when some jerk is raising our taxes by calling in false emergencies.

You are not forced to shop at Wal-Mart. There is plenty of other stores available to you. Most products that Wal-Mart sells are found in you other retail stores. If you dont like it, SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE. Like someone else before said, it will make the rest of us that enjoy shopping at Wal-Mart find a better parking spot and most of all a better shopping experience.

Wal-Mart started as a dream for Sam Walton. His dream grew into the largest retail operation in the world. Why condemn him for achieving his dreams. We teach our children daily to reach for the stars, to achieve their goals, and to fulfill their dreams. Yet, you condem those who do achieve them.

Sam Walton, may he rest in peace, and his wife Helen Walton are two of the nicest, most down to earth people you will ever meet. How dare any of us condemn their dreams in life.

Maybe we should all take a good look at the facts before we start judging.

If you need more info on Wal-Mart, they have websites in place to answer your questions. Take the time to look at walmartfacts.com before you judge.

SUBMITTED: Friday, April 29, 2005
 POSTED: Friday, April 29, 2005 I can&apos;t believe that the most of you cannot find something more worthwhile of cause to fight about than Walmart.

I can say that having shopped NUMEROUS times at Walmart (and contrary to one persons beliefs, I am not trailer trash). I have only EVER been asked to show a receipt when I have something large in my cart, or underneath the cart. I have NEVER had my bags searched or my person searched. But knowing Walmart, as most people who stop there do, I always carry my receipt in hand out the door. Use a little common sense, it couldn&apos;t have been that big of a shock to you.

Now, onto this policy that a company has to have IN WRITITING before you enter the store. The thing is, the do not have to have in the LARGE idiot proof letters across the front of the door. It just has to be posted. Its not their problem if you don&apos;t see it. I think you will find that in most places of business, they have one of those stickers somewhere on the door reserving the right to search your belongings.

And to me, this whole causing a scene and calling 911 is ridiculous. I don&apos;t care who you are. You know what you sound like to me? GUILTY.

 WalMart Crooks

 POSTED: Friday, April 29, 2005 &quot;L&quot; in Springfield AK.,

&quot;How dare any of us condemn their dreams in life&quot;, &quot;look at walmartfacts.com before you judge&quot;

I don&apos;t know what hole or fairlytale land you came from, but I can assure you that Wal-Mart&amp;Sam Walton (&amp;friends;) are a bunch of crooks.

I don&apos;t have to look at walmartfacts.com to say this (as I&apos;m sure that is an UNbias site, yeah right).

I worked for Wal-Mart for 3 years, they failed to pay me and many other co-workers statewide wages due (overtime,etc.).
A class action suit was filed, I had the opportuity to testify, and in Noverember 2002 at the federal courthouse in Portland Oregon a jury found Wal-Mart guilty of a state-wide &quot;practice&quot; (just short of conspiracy) to systematically under-pay / fail to pay wages to about 430 employees.

I&apos;ll also add that corporate execs, my former regional and store manager totally perjured themselves on the stand.

So, &apos;L&apos;, I can condemn Wal-Mart - and Sam Walton too (at least for when alive), the old &quot;Gee, Im the corporate executive and didnt know what my underlings were doing&quot; excuse when out with Enron.

 Poor Rebecca - came to a battle of wits unarmed 

AUTHOR: James - New York (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Saturday, April 30, 2005
 POSTED: Saturday, April 30, 2005 Rebecca - you have only proven that the only idiot here is yourself. You clearly do not understand that these signs you speak so highly of are a bluff, pure and simple. The merchants &quot;reserve the right&quot; is utter bullshit. They do NOT have that right in the first place.

Please, if you don&apos;t understand how to use the reference sites available to the legal profession, find someone who does. The facts are that time and time again the courts have upheld that the products you purchased become YOUR sole private property as soon as the funds change hands. From that point on, you have NO obligation whatsoever to show a receipt. Sorry if this disagrees with you and your &quot;idiotic&quot; signage - but the law trumps your sign everytime.

The ONLY recourse a merchant has when you ENTER the store with bags from another store is to ask you to leave if you refuse to let them search them. And that certainly seems reasonable to me.

Someone else asked if I would refuse to allow a police office to search my bags. Absolutely! But this is never going to happen. A true LEO (as opposed to the WalMart LP cop-wannabes) knows the law and knows he MUST have probable cause to detain someone. Furthermore, if he is wearing his uniform and driving his cruiser, even though he is off duty, he has opened himself up to a formal complaint to the city council. Again, as a professional, he is well aware of this as well.

You ignorant sheep just keep doing as you&apos;re told. If you are so weak as to be intimidated by the commands of a WalMart greeter, you deserve what you get.

While we are on the brainless sheeple roll here, lets dispense with the trial too. Just assume them guilty and lock them up for 5 or 10 years.
After all anyone who doesn&apos;t have a reciept -- IS A SHOP LIFTER. Doesn&apos;t the Constitution say something like that? Being guilty until being proven innocent?

Anyhow any one that inconveniences the police state (or walmart) by not doing what they are told on demand ought to be executed along with all of their immediate family. Lets just carry your illogic to its illogical and ultimate conclusion....

&gt;2. You are a guest at Wal-mart. They can refuse &gt;your entry to their store.

The sole purpose of the recipt check is to establish dominance over the customer, show who is in charge, not prevent theft or ensure that a customer has received his items. They could care less if you don&apos;t get your items.

Wal-Mart checks receipts because they can. The average dolt like Denny takes pride in the fact that he&apos;s contributing to loss prevention efforts. The truth of the matter is that consenting to this search further deteriorates your rights.

 Most people are confused. 

AUTHOR: Patrick - Gilbert (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Tuesday, December 13, 2005
 POSTED: Tuesday, December 13, 2005 It seems that most people are confused about their rights, so let me spell it out for everyone.

Once you pay for an item at the register, it becomes your personal property, whether it is placed in a bag or not. Wal-Mart (or any retailer for that matter) does not have the right to ask you for a receipt, stop you from exiting the store, or detain you in any way, even if they suspect you of shoplifting, or if the alarm at the door goes off.

LP does not have any right to touch you, or place you in custody. They can only ask that you do not leave the store, and/or accompany them back to the office. But you must comply willingly, they cannot force you.

The only exception would be places like Sam&apos;s Club/Costco, etc. where you agree to show your receipt when you signed up for club membership.

What this Wal-Mart did to the original poster is flat out wrong and illegal. This consumer&apos;s rights were violated, no doubt about it.

So, knowing what I do, here&apos;s how I handle my shopping at Wal-Mart:

1. I always check to make sure everything in my cart makes it to the belt and gets rung up and paid for.

2. I make sure I have all my bags/items before leaving the register.

3. If I have any items in my cart that are not bagged, I keep my receipt in hand until I exit the store, so that I am prepared if the door greeter wants to see it (9 out of 10 times they do not ask).

Now, are my rights being violated if they stop me and ask for my receipt? No, not if I agree to stop and show it. However, I do know that I have the right to refuse to show my receipt if I so choose. I have found that it usually only takes litterally a few seconds to show my receipt. And half the time, I gladly point out where the item is on the receipt.

This site has lots of reports about Wal-Mart. Considering the size of their corporation, that&apos;s no surprise. The more customers you have, the more complaints your going to get. Thats only logical. But consider this. Wal-Mart must be doing something right to have become the corporate giant they are today. Go to any Wal-Mart, and they are almost always crowded. Then, go to the closest K-Mart. Practically empty.

I remember when K-Mart was the leading low cost retailer. But then came Wal-Mart, and they seemed to be doing it better. So eventually people stopped going to K-Mart, and look what happened. Maybe one day someone will come along and do it better than Wal-Mart, and then Wal-Mart may be the one going bankrupt. But I don&apos;t see that happening anytime soon.

I think the biggest problem nowadays is people&apos;s attitudes. Look back to the 1950&apos;s. People were friendly and courteous, and not rude. Today, nobody seems to want to be bothered with being nice. Generally, I&apos;ve found that if you take the time to be nice to people, you will usually be treated the same. I know, there are always exceptions. I usually make a mental note and avoid that person in the future.

Be kind to your fellow man (or woman). You&apos;d be surprised at how much better you yourself will get treated.

Thanks for listening.

SUBMITTED: Tuesday, December 13, 2005
 POSTED: Tuesday, December 13, 2005 ..on shopping at a place they feel that have wronged them over and over again.

Yet there are thousands out there that know how to &quot;go on with their lives&quot; instead of think that their is a conspiracy going on at every corner, or behind their backs.

There is no gestapo like tactics on the part of walmart to make sure yOU have and leave with everything you&apos;ve bought.

How would you like to have bought and paid for a gallon of milk, and forget to collect it but the guy at the door was able to catch that on your receipt? Wouldn&apos;t you be grateful?

Walmart has these greeters for one thing, to make the CUSTOMER knows that they are aknowledge as the ENTER and LEAVE The store. This helps prevent theft.

You know what THEFT does right, Joe? It raises prices of the goods you buy. Wnat that gallon of milk to START costing you $7 instead of $3?

Sure, they can&apos;t CATCh everyone, but the simple aknowledgement is at least one way to make a &quot;thief&quot; change his mind.

I surely have walked out of Walmart without being &quot;asked&quot; to show my receipt many times over.

If Im carting out a tv set or a bulky item, I see these greeter to either get help or just so they know that Im not &quot;stealing&quot; the item.

Only people like &quot;JOE&quot; see this as a bad thing

Sorry, joe, the world odesn&apos;t revolve around your ignorant views. ITs their property and they have every right to &quot;police&quot; it as they do. If you dont like ,you can ALWAYS not shop there.

And Walmart isn&apos;t the ONLY store that practices this:
Sams Club

Target

I know a couple of people who work in lost provention. Unless they have seen you or vidoe tape you or have an actually witness, to the theif, even if the alarms go off, in our part of the USA (check your local state laws) the consumer doen not have to stop. What has happened to this country. We are giving up our freedom a little at a time. First its the receipt at the market. &quot;Well it is only kind to do this&quot;.. &quot;Its only 5 minutes out of your time&quot; That ok if you want to do it that is your right, but it is not what I might want to do. And it is well within my rights not too. The next thing our email and phones will be tapped, but in the intest of justice and protection that is ok. Well is it. What will be the next little right that we as a nation give up freely. This is our rights. We have to make sure that everyone from corport american to the government knows this. 
Again if you want to show your receipt go for it. I do on some days and other days I dont. Again that is my right.

 They Have A Right to Exercise Policy! 

AUTHOR: D. - Portland (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, February 19, 2006
 POSTED: Sunday, February 19, 2006 I&apos;ve worked in retail as a manager for years. I have dealt with a lot of theft that has cost my past former companies a lot of money. The bottom line is that these companies have a right to exercise their policy to protect their merchandise. Checking a receipt at the door is a simple and effective way to deter theft. If the embarrassed party doesn&apos;t like that policy, she should shop at another store. If the door greeter starts checking receipts only on certain customers instead of all customers then they run in to a situation involving discrimination. On the other hand...how far is a Walmart Manager going to go to make his point? Maybe the Manager could have been a little more tactful and less noticeable. Overall, my opinion is that they are both wrong in how they handle it but they both have a good point....funny how that works.

 Wal-Mart Not Entirely A &quot;Private Entity&quot; 

AUTHOR: Brian - Marlow (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Tuesday, February 21, 2006
 POSTED: Tuesday, February 21, 2006 It has been stated above that the Constitution&apos;s protection against unlawful searches and siezures applies ONLY to government agencies, and NOT to private entities. This is true, but I would like to point out one undeniable fact that has been overlooked.

If you look at the receipt that you receive from Wal-Mart then you will notice that you have been charged a certain amount of State Sales Tax for the merchandise that you have purchased. This Sales Tax collected from the consumer will later be turned over to your State Government.

This means that Wal-Mart is in fact an AGENT of your State Government, acting on its behalf as a tax collector for it. Therefore, all of your contitutional protections should apply because Wal-Mart is in fact acting as an Agent of your State Government.

When you purchase merchandise at the cash register, and money changes hands (or a credit transaction is approved) then that merchandise is YOURS, plain and simple.

Whether the alarm goes off or not, and whether the Greeter asks to see your receipt or not, you have the legal right to exit the store and enter the parking lot without any further action on your part whatsoever.

These are your rights, and they are precious.

Many before you have shed their blood and have died in battle so that you could have these inalienable rights. If you do not exercise your rights then you might lose them some day.

Where I live, if it&apos;s after 4 pm or on the weekend, the only way to get ahold of the police is by dialing 911.

 Other grocery stores exploit your receipts! 

AUTHOR: Nick - Hollywood (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Friday, March 10, 2006
 POSTED: Friday, March 10, 2006 I&apos;m noticing a disturbing difference of opinion between &quot;Rights&quot; and &quot;Pride&quot;.

What is it about people that makes them feel &quot;All American&quot; by brushing past an old or handicapped gentleman or lady who is requests to see your receipt, thus making them follow you to your car? I will NOT argue that it is your right to do so. But you really display what you are: an arrogant rude self-absorbed person who has no respect for anyone but yourself. Go ahead and wrap yourself in the Constitution - it protects a-holes and criminals too.

So please, do NOT shop at Wal-Mart. I am tired of trying to walk past you while you&apos;re having a hissy fit and threatening to call the police on my way out the door.

And for pete&apos;s sake, 911 IS for emergencies ONLY – like the LIFE and DEATH kind! Stop spreading that it&apos;s for your Wal-Mart disputes – it&apos;s for car accidents, fires and heart attacks, not a stupid petty civil rights hang-up!

Here&apos;s a tip for you receipt-mongers - shop at Albertsons and Safeway instead. Sign up for those &quot;supermarket swipe-and-save&quot; cards in a feeble attempt to match Wal-Mart&apos;s prices.

Now instead of your &quot;rights&quot; being violated, your &quot;privacy&quot; can be violated. Do a yahoo search on &quot;big brother grocery cart&quot; and you&apos;ll see what I&apos;m talking about. They track your purchases, and keep your info on a database. That in comparison pales what Wal-Mart does.

One guy in particular was sueing his doctor and the hospital because he wasn&apos;t getting better after a surgery. The lawyers for the hospital subponea&apos;d this guy&apos;s grocery card and found that he was buying junk food and vodka.

So I guess the question is: To save money would you rather:

1. Let some old lady check your receipt for 20 seconds
2. Let the store collect the information ANYWAY on a hard-drive without telling you, and thus allowing government or citizens check the third-party computer database any time they want from a “grocery store”?

I guess that&apos;s up to you. I happen to shop at Wal-Mart because of the prices, no hassles, and privacy. If all they ask is for a receipt (like many OTHER stores do), then I give it to them and I&apos;m on my way.

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.

 Gee Nick, tell that to our local police department. 

AUTHOR: Cyn - Port Orchard (U.S.A.)

 POSTED: Friday, March 10, 2006 I guess they don&apos;t realize 911 is for life and death emergencies only, because after 4:00 pm the dispatcher office is closed and we are INSTRUCTED to call 911 and state &quot;this is a non-emergency&quot;.
911 is indeed used for other things besides life-and-death emergencies. It is used for any and all after-hours police contact.
In fact, when my stolen car was recovered at 11:00 pm recently, it was a 911 operator that called ME to let me know where to go and meet the officers to pick up my car.

Obviously not a life and death emergency. Maybe you should inform the local police and local 911 operators that they are misusing the system.

SUBMITTED: Saturday, April 15, 2006
 POSTED: Saturday, April 15, 2006 Shoplifting is a crime. In the United States you are presumed innocent of all crimes until proven guilty. The burden of proof is on the accusor, not the accused. You do not have to prove your innocense. You may, but you can not be forced to. If you did not commit an act of shoplifting, let them accuse you and sit in the court room and say nothing. They must prove their case. If not, hit them in a civil trial for a false accusation. It&apos;s not about searches and seisures. It&apos;s about you not having to prove anything to anybody. Period.

 innocent untill proven guilty? 

AUTHOR: Robert - Jacksonville (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Sunday, April 16, 2006
 POSTED: Sunday, April 16, 2006 Huh? Says who? Where is that actually written?

It&apos;s not in any of the Constitutions that govern this country. There are 51 of them, and that phrase is contained in none of them. It&apos;s just a quaint notion, nothing else.

Try thinking about it.

If the police dispatcher thought you were innocent, he would not send a squad car. If the cop thought you were innocent, he would not arrest you. If the magistrate thought you were innocent, he would not arraign you. If the D.A. thought you were innocent, he would not prosecute you. If the Judge thought you were innocent, he would dismiss the case before trial.

Get it? NOBODY believes you are innocent untill proven guilty.

As for having nothing to prove, sorry...no. The WalMart belongs to WalMart. Untill you leave the store, the merchants has legal authority to do what he can to make sure he&apos;s not being stolen from. ALL WalMart does is have an old woman look at a reciept if the item doesn&apos;t have a piece of tape on it. You all just keep trying to play Matlock and think you&apos;ll be the big winner. It doesn&apos;t work that way. If you act like a thief, and a big goon(security) grabs you, you better hope the cop that shows up wants to listen to you. The cops will take the word of L.P. over yours every time.

If you act like a fool, be ready to be treated like a fool.

 Is the bag check legal? 

AUTHOR: Aafes - Viernheim (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Tuesday, April 25, 2006
 POSTED: Tuesday, April 25, 2006 Is the bag check legal? Yes, as long as the inspection is voluntary. No, if the bag check is involuntary or coerced. This is a rather fine legal distinction that is subject to misunderstanding and abuse. Basically, nothing in the law gives the merchant the right to detain a customer for the purpose of searching a shopping bag unless there is a reasonable suspicion of retail theft.

The mistake most merchants make is to hire a bag checker with the attitude of a bouncer. One who is rude and agressive and feels a sense of &quot;power&quot; over the customer or the situtation. This makes for a difficult situation from the beginning.

The bag checker has a purpose as they do aid in loss prevention, but also ensure that your purchases have been rung correctly. It is simple for a item to be overcharged on a purchase - this overcharge can be caused by a mere &quot;scratch&quot; on a barcode and a subsequent computer misread of that code.

Not only does the bag checker help catch mistakes and deter theft, but also aids in the return procedure. The special mark that is made on the receipt is a signal to the refund desk that the item passed by the door checker after being purchased. Unmarked receipts suggest that the items might be stolen or purchased at a different store. This could adversely hamper speedy refund processing.

 The law 

AUTHOR: Max - Ft Myers (U.S.A.)

SUBMITTED: Thursday, November 09, 2006
 POSTED: Thursday, November 09, 2006 I have been involved in many shoplifting prosecutions as a retailer, and this is how I understand how the law in most states handles this situation.

If a merchant has REASONABLE CAUSE to suspect that you have shoplifted, then they have a right to stop you and even to detain you until police arive.

On the other hand when a company like Walmart simple stops people on a routine basis to ensure that they have paid, this action is not enforceable. They can only see your receipt if you agree to show it to them. They have no right to stop you if you refuse to show your receipt.

But, if as you proceed out of the store, their security scanner beeps as you pass through, they then have reasonable cause to suspect shoplifting, so they have every right to stop you.

It&apos;s a lot easier just to comply, since practically everybody knows that WalMart sometimes asks to see receipts. Actually, stores have the legal right to ban you from returning to their store if you do not cooperate with their rules. In other words, they can order you not to return and then call the police for trespassing if you do come back. Discount club stores have the right to see your receipt because you agree to abide by their rules when you sign up for the &quot;club.&quot; Otherwise they can revoke your memebership.

The bottom line is that Walmart has no right to demand to see your receipt under normal circumstances. But remember that if a store security person was following you in the store and has reasonable cause to believe you are shoplifting, that changes the whole game, and you could be violating the law by refusing to cooperate.

That said, my personal opinion is that you should just show the receipt. If you don&apos;t like the policy then shop somewhere else.

 Amanda&apos;s Legal Recourse 

AUTHOR: Tham - Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)

SUBMITTED: Friday, December 14, 2007
 POSTED: Friday, December 14, 2007 And what if the shopper has indvertently lost the receipt on the way out in such a case, which is not uncommon ?

It has happened to me a few times, since the shopper, or rather the cashier in many cases (this is the case commonly in Malaysia ,where I live) just drops the receipt into the flimsy
plastic bag already packed full of shopping items, which can then easily fall out and fly off into the wind as one walks out in a
hurry, bustling amongst countless other shoppers, burdened with many other bags.

Does the burden of proof that he has paid for the items fall on the shopper then ?

Basically, demanding to see the shopper&apos;s printed receipt is idiotic and superfluous in the case of a large shopping center like Walmart. Isn&apos;t it a simple matter for their management just to check firstly, the records on the cashier&apos;s machine, and failing that, their own computerized sales database, since the whole sales checking out system is online ?

Secondly, demanding, embarrrassing and detaining the shopper can backfire on the shopping center, if it turns out to be a &quot;cry wolf&quot; case. I&apos;m not familar with the American legal system of
Torts, but under the British system, Amanda has a very good case of winning a lawsuit for firstly, slander, secondly, causing duress,
and thirdly, trespass to the person.

Keep the faith and continue to REFUSE to show your receipt. This is (or used to be) AMERICA. Since when do we have to prove we made a purchase when we&apos;re leaving the store. When you pay for your merchandise it becomes YOUR property.

I have refused to show my receipt when the greeter asks and will continue to refuse. Last week the Walmart greeter followed me into the parking lot yelling &quot;THIEF, THIEF!&quot; He was trying to get shoppers to intervene.

I too am in search of an attorney and if I don&apos;t find one I&apos;ll go it alone. I WILL take Walmart to task for their employee&apos;s actions!

Interestingly Walmart is rather difficult to sue as they take nearly every issue to trial. I say, bring it on Walmart!!!
