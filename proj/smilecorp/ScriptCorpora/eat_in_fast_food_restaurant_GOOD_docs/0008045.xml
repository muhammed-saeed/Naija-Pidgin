 DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

 [0019] Various embodiments of a patron experience management system (EMS)
 are disclosed. Some embodiments employ a dynamic repository of customer
 data to provide a personalized interface to each patron of goods or
 service providers such as F&amp;B;venues and the like, fostering greater
 loyalty and/or increased profits. For example, some of the systems
 described herein interface existing venue systems (e.g., POS systems at
 restaurants) with patrons&apos; mobile devices. The venue and/or patron may
 have accounts and associated profiles with the EMS.

 [0020] Certain EMS implementations are described herein with respect to a
 restaurant context for the purposes of illustration. However, embodiments
 of the EMS may additionally be compatible with a broad array of venue
 types including, without limitation, hotels, resorts, and other
 hospitality oriented venues, casinos or other gaming related venues, and
 sports or entertainment venues such as golf courses or theaters, or F&amp;B;venues such as bars, and the like.

 [0021] Patrons can provide profile information such as likes, dislikes,
 demographic information, etc. Moreover, in some embodiments, the
 management system may record and store information related to the patron
 over time, such as information related to the patron&apos;s purchase history.
 Venues can additionally provide profile information such available
 restaurant menu items, location information, and the like. The patron
 and/or venue profile information may be included in a database, which may
 be a relational database, an object-oriented database, a flat-file
 database, any combination of the above, or other data storage structures.
 Each profile record may be stored in one or more tables, objects or
 files. Database management applications such as creating and
 administering a database and database tables, and administering the
 creating, updating and deleting of records are common and supported by
 existing database applications such as, for example, MySQL, Microsoft
 Access, Oracle, Sybase and FoxBase. Those and other database applications
 provide extensive database management application design tools,
 simplifying the design of database management applications, and those of
 ordinary skill understand well how to use the design tools to construct
 and operate such database management applications, and also how to
 present queries to extract records associated with particular keywords or
 whose field information match specified search criteria. Thus, the
 present invention is not limited by a particular database management
 application. Using the profile information, the embodiments of the EMS
 can tailor patron venue experiences in a personalized fashion. Thus,
 patrons can influence offerings they receive. In a restaurant context, an
 example experience management system may provide the user a customized
 menu based on the venues available menu selections and based on the
 patron&apos;s likes, dislikes, previous order history, and so on. Restaurant
 customers can have streamlined access to their favorite items, for
 example. Moreover, venues can &quot;know&quot; their customers before they even
 step in the door in certain embodiments and customize offerings based on
 their preferences.

 [0022] The experience management system may further provide patrons and/or
 venues with interfaces for interacting with the system in beneficial
 ways. For example, the management system can provide the user with a
 mobile device interface, allowing the user to interact with the venue via
 the management system remotely. For example, a restaurant patron can
 place an order before entering the restaurant. The user may also be able
 to view other information related to the venue such as nutritional
 information, ingredients, pictures, video (both pre-recorded and/or
 real-time video of the current conditions), reviews, and more. Other
 interfaces may be provided. In the restaurant example, the user may be
 able to view the menu in the restaurant (e.g., on a venue provided device
 or display), at a drive-through window, or in some other manner. The
 management system may provide venues with customized interfaces as well.
 These interfaces can provide venues with a powerful tool for monitoring
 information related to patron&apos;s (e.g., patron demographic information,
 feedback, etc.).

 [0023] The experience management system of certain embodiments also employs
 location information associated with the patron to enhance the patron&apos;s
 venue experience. For example, the system can use the geolocation of the
 patron&apos;s mobile device (e.g., through GPS or other positioning
 technology) to trigger certain events or otherwise improve the patron
 venue experience. As one illustrative example, in the restaurant scenario
 described above, a patron may enter an order (e.g., over the management
 system interface on their mobile device), and the experience management
 system may notify the restaurant employees to begin preparing the order
 upon detecting that the user is within a predetermined distance of the
 restaurant.

 [0024] In the restaurant context, the EMS can provide a number of
 advantages as compared to conventional approaches. For example, patrons
 can make more efficient menu decisions using personalized menus and time
 savings can be achieved.

 [0025] In some configurations, the management system additionally allows
 users to share information with other patrons over one of the management
 system interfaces (e.g., using their mobile device). Generally, the EMS
 may be configured to restrict sharing of information among patrons to
 only those patrons who have established a &quot;friend&quot; relationship.
 Accordingly, the EMS provides a selectable option that allows one patron
 to send a request to another patron to establish a &quot;friend&quot; relationship.
 The other patron will receive the request, for example either upon his or
 her next login to the EMS and/or in an e-mail, and then may select an
 option indicating acceptance of the request. Such acceptance causes, in
 one embodiment, the patron ID of the accepting patron to be added to the
 FRIENDS table of the requesting patron and also patron ID of the
 requesting patron to be added to the FRIENDS table of the accepting
 patron. Thus, in one embodiment, a patron may share a variety of
 different types of information with other patrons with whom he or she has
 established such a &quot;friend&quot; relationship, or may access certain status
 information about such friend. For example, one patron may access the EMS
 and request a FRIENDS menu which provides status indicators for all
 patrons with whom a &quot;friend&quot; relationship has been established,
 including, for example, that a friend is &quot;logged out,&quot; &quot;at a particular
 venue,&quot; or &quot;logged in.&quot; A patron may then select a friend who is
 indicated as being &quot;at a particular venue&quot; and the EMS provides further
 options, including accessing a menu, personalized to the friend, showing
 items available for purchase at the venue being attended by the friend.
 The EMS permits the patron to buy from the friend&apos;s personalized menu an
 item that will then be provided to the friend by the venue on behalf of
 the patron, e.g. buy a friend his or her favorite drink. In this manner,
 and others, patrons may share venue experiences, and may interact and
 socialize with each other using the EMS.

 [0026] In yet other aspects, events can be organized using the EMS. For
 example, patrons and/or venues can organize events involving other
 patrons or a group of patrons. Events can be planned at EMS capable
 venues, for examples (e.g., restaurants, hotels, casinos) or other
 locations (e.g., a patron&apos;s home.) For example, the EMS can invite other
 patrons to events and organize the event according to the personalized
 EMS profile information associated with the invited patrons. For example,
 in one embodiment, the patron invites other patrons to a dinner party at
 a restaurant venue or at his or her home. The EMS 100 allows the patron
 or the venue to plan and execute the dinner party according to the
 personalized preferences of the invited patrons. The EMS also permits a
 patron to define particular groups of patrons, such that sending future
 invitations to the same group is made more efficient. In one embodiment,
 the EMS provides as an invitation-related option, a pull-down list of
 defined patron groups, allowing the patron to select, with a single
 click, a group of patrons, each of which will receive an event
 invitation. For privacy concerns, the EMS may require that other patrons
 &quot;friend&quot; a patron, before the patron is able to select other patrons to
 add them to a defined group of patrons.

 [0027] FIG. 1 illustrates an EMS 100, a patron device 102 and a venue
 computing device 104 and POS system 106 associated with a venue 108.
 These components can be interconnected by one or more networks. For
 example, the network can include the Internet, cellular networks, and the
 like. The patron can be any entity or individual interested in purchasing
 goods or services from a venue, or generally any non-venue user of the
 EMS 100. The terms &quot;patron,&quot; &quot;user&quot; and &quot;customer&quot; are used
 interchangeably herein, and are not to be interpreted as limiting. The
 venue can be any individual or entity that offers products or services,
 such as for sale, and can include, without limitation, restaurants,
 chains of restaurants, hotels, resorts, and other hospitality oriented
 venues, casinos or other gaming related venues, and sports or
 entertainment venues such as golf courses or theaters, or F&amp;B;venues such
 as bars, and the like. In some embodiments, the venue can be a user&apos;s
 home. Additionally, in some embodiments, the venue does not offer the
 products and services for sale and/or is not associated with products and
 services. For example, a venue can include a location for an event that
 is scheduled using the EMS 100 (e.g., a meal planned using the EMS 100 by
 a patron and including one or more other invited patrons), which may or
 may not involve associated products and/or services.

 [0028] As illustrated by FIG. 1, there may be more than one patron and
 associated patron device 102 and more than one venue and associated venue
 computing device 104 and POS system 106. The patron device 102 can
 generally comprise any computing device capable of providing a graphical
 display and/or network access, and in one embodiment comprises a smart
 phone such as an iPhone, Blackberry or Android. The patron device 110 may
 additionally include, without limitation, a mobile device such as another
 type of smart phone, cellphone, etc., a personal computer such as a
 laptop, notebook. webbook, or desktop, etc.

 [0029] The venue computing device 104 similarly can include generally any
 computing device capable of providing a display and/or network access,
 and in one embodiment comprises one or more personal computers located at
 the venue location. The venue computing device 104 can additionally or
 alternatively be any of the types of devices listed above with respect to
 the patron device 102, or some other type of computing device.
 Additionally, the venue computing device 104 of some embodiments is not
 physically located at the venue location, but is located at a remote
 location. The venue computing device 104 includes an administrator
 interface module 110 which allows a venue operator such as a manager or
 other employee to configure the EMS profile associated with that venue.

 [0030] The POS system 106 can generally include any type of point of sale
 system and can include any combination of hardware and software capable
 of any of the following, without limitation: accepting input relating to
 the goods or services a patron desires to purchase; accepting payment
 from users; and providing users with an interface for selecting and/or
 purchasing goods or services. For example, the POS system 106 can include
 one or more checkout terminals in one embodiment. In various
 configurations, the POS system can include other computing devices such
 as a desktop, laptop, notebook, or webbook computers, any of the other
 computing devices described herein, or any combination thereof. The POS
 system 106 can be wired, wireless, or a combination thereof.
 Additionally, the POS system 106 may be compatible with a variety of open
 or proprietary POS communication protocols. In certain embodiments, the
 POS system 106 or portions thereof are not physically located at the
 venue 108. For example, the POS system 106 is a Web-based POS system in
 some cases and can be run on generally any computing device with an
 Internet connection and supported browser.

 [0031] In an example POS system 106 configured for use in a restaurant
 context, the POS system 106 includes POS software running on one or more
 touchscreen computer terminals and wireless handheld devices. The POS
 software can print guest checks, print orders to kitchens or bars for
 preparation, process credit cards and other payment cards, and run
 reports. Wireless pagers and electronic signature capture devices may
 also be used. In a fast-food restaurant, for example, front counter
 terminals and drive through terminals and associated headsets and
 speakers can be included. A variety of POS system 106 designs are
 possible depending on the specific application, as will be recognized by
 those of skill in the art.

 [0032] The EMS 100 includes one or more EMS servers 112, such as, for
 example, web servers. The servers are in communication with an EMS
 database 114 which stores information relating to the patrons and venues,
 such as account and profile information. The EMS database may include a
 relational database, for example, and is a MySQL based database in one
 embodiment. Generally, the EMS database stores historical data and users
 preferences, enabling the delivery of a customized experience. Moreover,
 the EMS 100 and associated database 114 can generally be accessed from
 anywhere in the world; therefore, the EMS 100 allows personalized service
 regardless of the location or the venue as long as the venue is EMS
 capable. In some embodiments, a venue service 116 running on the EMS
 server 112 is in communication with one or more of the POS system 106,
 the venue computing device 104, and the patron device 102. A user service
 118 running on the EMS server 112 is in communication with the patron
 device 118.

 [0033] The venue service 116 can implement a variety of functions. For
 example, the venue service 116 generally handles and facilitates
 interactions between the EMS 100 and the POS system 106, venue computing
 device 104, and/or patron device 102. As an illustrative example, the
 venue service can allow a venue operator to access and modify the venue&apos;s
 account and associated profile information via the administrator
 interface 110. The venue service may additionally process and/or compile
 certain EMS information and provide reports to the venue operator over
 the administrator interface 110. For example, the venue service 116 may
 serve a graphical user interface to the administrator interface 110,
 viewable by the venue operator using a browser of the venue computing
 device 104. Additionally, the venue service can interact with the POS
 system 106 to receive and process purchase information, provide venue or
 patron profile information (e.g., available menu items and patron
 preferences for customized menu generation), and the like.

 [0034] In addition to providing a variety of other functions, the user
 service 118 generally handles and facilitates interactions between the
 EMS 100 and the patron device 102. For example, the EMS system 100 may
 serve an EMS client 120 to the patron device 102. A patron may initiate
 an EMS client session by launching the EMS client 120 and providing login
 information, for example. In certain embodiments, patrons may
 additionally be able to login anonymously. For example, anonymous users
 may be provided a limited subset of EMS functionality.

 [0035] After login, the EMS client 120 can provide a graphical user
 interface to the patron, allowing them to interact with the EMS 100. In
 some embodiments, the EMS 100 serves an on-line EMS portal (e.g., an EMS
 website), viewable on a web browser running on the patron device 102. In
 some embodiment, there is no separate EMS client 120 provided, and the
 patron interacts with the EMS 100 through the on-line EMS portal. The
 patron service 118 also can allow the patron to access and/or modify the
 patron&apos;s account and associated profile information over such an
 interface. As is described throughout this disclosure, the on-line portal
 and/or EMS client 120 can provide a number of functions including one or
 more of the following, without limitation: (1) a login interface; (2) a
 personalized menu interface to the patron; (3) a list of available
 venues; (4) a profile section where the patron can control account
 information and personal settings; (5) an account management interface
 for viewing order histories; (6) an interface for editing preferences.

 [0036] In some embodiments, an open EMS client 120 user session can be
 cached on the EMS server 112 to preserve the session in the event that
 the patron device 102 crashes, quits the application, goes out of
 reception, or otherwise fails. EMS client sessions can remain active for
 a predetermined period of time.

 [0037] One or more application programming interfaces (API&apos;s) may be used
 in certain embodiments. For example, API&apos;s may be used to interface the
 EMS client 120 running on the mobile device 102 with the venue service
 116, patron service 118, or some other component of the EMS 100. An API
 may additionally be used to interface the administrator interface 110,
 the POS system 106, or some other component of the venue 100 with the
 venue service 116 or some other portion of the EMS 100.

 [0038] According to certain embodiments, the EMS 100 operates with existing
 venue hardware (e.g., computing devices 104 and/or POS systems 106).
 Moreover, the patrons&apos; mobile devices 102 generally do not require
 additional hardware. As such, the EMS 100 can be integrated into existing
 infrastructure in a straightforward manner without requiring additional
 hardware, allowing for rapid, low cost industry adoption.

 [0039] In some alternative embodiments, a separate server (not shown) is
 installed at the venue location implementing certain EMS functionality.
 Such functionality may be implemented on the venue-installed server
 instead of by the EMS 100, for example. The venue-installed server may be
 in communication with the EMS 100, for example, and one or more of the
 POS system 106, existing venue computing devices 104, and/or patron
 device 104 may be connected to the separate server and communicate with
 the EMS 100 via the venue-installed server. The venue-installed server
 may include a database that stores information related to that particular
 venue such as menu information and the like.

 [0040] In certain embodiments, access to EMS 100 access is role-based and
 thus different interface and/or access levels are provided to certain
 individuals based on the role of the user that is interacting with the
 EMS 100. Although a variety of other configurations are possible, in one
 example embodiment, there are four role classes including, in descending
 order of access level: (1) Super Administrator--The Super Administrator
 has the highest level of access and can register restaurants with the
 EMS, provide system maintenance, etc. The Super Administrator may access
 the EMS 100 directly through the EMS servers 112, for example; (2) Super
 Manager--The Super Manager is provided access to global EMS statistics,
 can manage EMS access of other users, but cannot create other Super
 Managers, for example. The Super Manager may also access the EMS 100
 directly through the EMS servers 112; (3) Chain Manager--The Chain
 Manager role would only be applicable to a chain having multiple venues
 registered with the EMS 100 (e.g., a chain of fastfood restaurants). The
 Chain Manager role is generally assigned to an employee of a chain venue
 and allows the user to create and modify a chain-wide list of menu
 offerings provided by the chain, distribute the menu to other venues in
 the chain, register additional chain members to the EMS. The Chain
 Manager may access the EMS through an administrator interface, such as
 the administrator interface 110 of FIG. 1, or a separate chain manager
 interface; and (4) Restaurant manager--The Restaurant Manager role is
 also generally assigned to a venue employee, and the Restaurant Manager
 can create and modify the list of menu offerings, view statistics, create
 other restaurant managers (if applicable), etc. Similar to the Chain
 Manager, the Restaurant manager may access the EMS through the
 administrator interface 110, for example.

 [0041] FIG. 2 is a flow diagram 200 showing an embodiment of how an example
 EMS 202 can be used in a restaurant setting. The EMS 202 can respond to a
 download request from a patron device 204 (e.g., a smartphone), such as a
 smart phone, to serve an EMS client for installation on the smart phone.
 For example, the EMS 202 can provide access to the EMS client over an
 on-line portal served by the EMS 202. Alternatively, third-party portals
 can be used (e.g., the Apple Store) to download the client, or a
 browser-based interface is used instead of a separate client. The patron
 may access the EMS 202 with a secure user ID and password, for example,
 and the EMS 202 generally maintains the patron&apos;s profile information, as
 described.

 [0042] Patrons of an EMS capable restaurant can access the restaurant&apos;s
 menus offerings while at the restaurant or prior to arrival and can use
 their mobile device 204 to browse menu offerings, such as personalized
 menus and the like. In other contexts such as non-restaurant contexts,
 patrons can browse other offerings such as pictures, products, services,
 etc. Additionally, in some embodiments, patrons may interact with the
 menu offerings or other venue offerings through a venue provided
 interface such as a display (e.g., a mounted LCD display), venue provided
 handheld device, table-top interface, etc. An EMS 202 interface including
 a customized menu can be embedded into a restaurant or restaurant chain&apos;s
 existing web site in certain embodiments. In one embodiment, the POS
 system 206 or other restaurant operated system serves menu offerings or
 other restaurant information to be presented to the EMS 202, and the EMS
 202 pushes such information to the user (e.g., to an EMS client on the
 user&apos;s mobile device), although other configurations are possible.

 [0043] The EMS 202 generated personalized menu may draw on a wide variety
 of types of information in generating a customized menu, including,
 without limitation, the menu offerings available from the particular
 venue, the time of day, the patron&apos;s age, the patron&apos;s food preferences,
 the patron&apos;s previous order history, and the like. As another example,
 the EMS may allow the patron to a level of enjoyment of a particular menu
 item, such as by providing a numerical ranking or by giving a
 thumbs-up/thumbs-down type of input. Based on the patron&apos;s input, the EMS
 202 can determine whether to present the menu item to the patron in the
 customized menu on the patron&apos;s next visit. A &quot;Favorites&quot; button can
 provide the patron a list of items they have indicated as their favorites
 or as exceeding a predetermined level of enjoyment. A &quot;Quick order&quot;
 option may be included providing the patron&apos;s previous orders. A
 &quot;Recommended Dishes&quot; listing can provide the patron a list of offerings
 that are recommended based on their profile information and ordering
 history at that venue and/or other venues. Where a chain of restaurants
 include the same menu options, the menu may at one restaurant in the
 chain be based on a patron&apos;s previous orders or other interactions other
 restaurants in the chain.

 [0044] Other type of personalized menus can be generated, depending on the
 type of venue. As a few examples, a personalized list of gaming options
 may be presented a casino venue. A hotel patron may be presented list of
 available hospitality options (e.g., in-room entertainment options, spa
 services, etc.). A personalized Karaoke song list can be provided at a
 Karaoke venue. Other personalized menu offerings can include lists of
 social activities or retail offerings, for example. In certain cases,
 menus including third-party applications such as software applications
 can be provided to the patron by the EMS 202. Such applications may be
 integrated using an API, for example.

 [0045] Moreover, the EMS 202 may use information related to other patrons
 that the user is associated with in the EMS 202 social network. For
 example, the patron may identify one or more other friends who have
 profiles with the EMS 202 as having similar food tastes to their own. In
 one scenario, if the identified friend has been to that restaurant or
 ordered certain menu items, but the patron has not, the EMS 202 generates
 a menu including items the friends ordered or enjoyed.

 [0046] In some embodiments, the EMS 202 notifies a patron when one or more
 friends login to an EMS enabled venue, and allows the patrons to
 interact. In one example scenario, a patron at a first venue location is
 notified that a friend is at a second venue location, and the patron can
 buy the friend a favorite drink, or interact in some other manner.

 [0047] Additionally, in certain embodiments, the EMS 202 can be used with
 &quot;friend connect accounts&quot; such as Facebook Connect or Google Friend
 Connect, providing further social networking capability.

 [0048] According to some embodiments, the EMS 202 allows chains of venues,
 or multiple un-affiliated venues to share EMS 202 information with one
 another. For example, in one embodiment, a first restaurant venue allows
 a second restaurant to access information related to the patron&apos;s
 ordering history at the first restaurant. The second restaurant may allow
 the first restaurant similar access to the patron&apos;s ordering information
 at the second restaurant. In other embodiments, the EMS 202 generally
 makes ordering information publicly available to all venues without
 requiring permission from the individual venues.

 [0049] Based on a patron&apos;s previous order history or other available
 information, the EMS 202 may additionally determine additional items to
 offer to the patron, such as appetizers, drink selections, side orders,
 and the like, thereby potentially increasing the total value of the
 order. In various embodiments, such additional items may be presented to
 the patron in a real-time update after the user selects a first menu
 item. As one example, a patron at a fast food restaurant may select a
 hamburger using an EMS menu interface provided on their mobile device
 204, and the EMS 202 may prompt the patron as to whether they would like
 additional items, such as their preferred type of cheese, preferred side
 order, beverage choice, and the like. In other scenarios, the EMS 202 may
 present the additional items when generating the initial personalized
 menu. For example, the EMS 202 may present a customized combination meal
 option to the patron, such as a cheeseburger including the patron&apos;s
 desired type of cheese, along with their preferred side order and
 beverage choice.

 [0050] Using the interface provided on the patron&apos;s mobile device 204 or
 some other interface, the patron is guided through the menu offerings,
 including favorite or recommended items, special promotions, etc. The
 patron may select menu options for purchase using an EMS interface on
 their mobile device 204. The EMS 202 receives the patron&apos;s selections and
 forwards them to the venue&apos;s POS system 206.

 [0051] In some embodiments, the EMS 202 uses the geolocation information of
 the patron&apos;s mobile device to trigger order placement or to provide a
 notification to venue staff that they should begin food preparation. For
 example, when a patron is within a certain distance or the patron&apos;s
 expected arrival time is within a certain time period, an electronic
 message may be sent to a POS terminal or other venue computing device in
 the kitchen.

 [0052] In another embodiment, a venue operator inputs the patron&apos;s
 selections and inputs them into a terminal of the POS system 206 (e.g., a
 cash register or handheld device). For example, the patron may view a
 customized menu as he or she approaches the cash register, or may be
 presented a customized menu by a waiter at the patron&apos;s seat. The waiter
 or cashier clerk may then input the patron&apos;s selections.

 [0053] The POS system 206 receives the patron&apos;s selections and communicates
 the selections to venue operators such as preparation staff 208 (e.g.,
 cooking staff) and/or wait staff 210 through the restaurant&apos;s POS system
 206 (e.g., through a POS computer terminal having a display and mounted
 in the kitchen or other appropriate area of the restaurant) or through
 some other interface such as an electronic messaging system. The POS
 system 206 may further communicate other personalized patron data from
 the EMS database to the venue operators 208, 210. Such information may
 include the patron&apos;s particular dining preferences including, without
 limitation, food allergies, whether they drink alcoholic beverages,
 whether they are a vegetarian or vegan, how the patron likes certain
 types of meat to be cooked, what kinds of condiments to use, to name a
 few. Service related information may also be presented to the venue staff
 208, 210 as well. For example, the POS system 206 or other interface may
 provide the venue operators 208, 210 with historical information such as
 the patron&apos;s tipping history, seating desires, complaints, descriptions
 of previous encounters with the wait staff, and the like.

 [0054] The servers 210 can then deliver the patron&apos;s order and provide
 customized service to the patron using the information provided by the
 EMS 202. In one embodiment, a patron can be identified by a venue or by
 the EMS 202 as a VIP. Using the geolocation of the VIP&apos;s mobile device,
 the EMS 202 can detect that the VIP has entered or is approaching the
 venue. The EMS 202 can then notify a restaurant manager of the VIP&apos;s
 impending arrival, and the manager can take any appropriate steps, such
 as greeting the VIP at the door.

 [0055] At the end of the meal, patrons can pay through conventional means
 such as by requesting a hard check, or they can charge it through the
 secured EMS 202 interface (e.g., using a client EMS interface downloaded
 to their mobile device 202) that stores their preferred payment mechanism
 and associated information (e.g., credit card info). Diners can also
 provide feedback and comments about their experience to the EMS 202. The
 EMS 202 can provide the patron with incentives to use the EMS 202.

 [0056] Thus, the EMS 202 provides a streamlined ordering process that can
 increase table turnover. Moreover, workload for restaurant staff is
 reduced through the automated features provided by the EMS 202, which can
 provide a number of benefits including allowing staff to focus their
 efforts more on customer service, reducing the number of staff needed to
 run the restaurant and thus reducing operating costs, and the like.
 Moreover, the EMS 202 can help reduce ordering errors. For example, where
 the patron can input their own ordering selections (e.g., via their
 mobile device 204), errors in communicating the order to the restaurant
 staff can be reduced or eliminated.

 [0057] Additionally, because the restaurant staff has access to a
 repository of individualized information related to the patron, the staff
 can make individualized decisions when providing service, reducing
 mistakes. As a few examples, depending on the types of information
 available related to a particular patron, restaurant staff may be less
 likely to serve meat that is not cooked to the patron&apos;s preference, serve
 meals containing food the patron is allergic to, or neglect to put a
 slice of lemon or ice in a patron&apos;s water.

 [0058] The EMS 202 can allow for targeted content delivery including
 promotions, games, advertisements, and other marketing related material.
 In one embodiment, the EMS 202 allows the patron to accrue `usage points`
 towards future discounts&amp;privileges. Additionally, the EMS 202 can
 allow venues to market promotional campaigns, provide coupons, etc., over
 the EMS interface. Because the EMS 202 can provide the venue operators or
 third party marketers with personalized information related to the
 patron, the content can be targeted to the specific patrons, improving
 marketing effectiveness.

 [0059] The EMS 202 can additionally provide the restaurant or other venue
 with instant customer feedback, such that the venue can immediately
 address any issues. For example, the patrons may give feedback using an
 EMS client on their mobile device, or through one of the restaurant
 provided devices described herein. Users may be more likely to use the
 EMS 202 to give feedback than through traditional methods because it is
 less confrontational than giving oral feedback or writing feedback down
 on a feedback form.

 [0060] The EMS 202 can also provide information to venue management 212,
 such as periodic reports of customer usage, demographic profiles, etc.,
 providing management 212 powerful insights they can use to improve their
 offerings and service.

 [0061] Referring again to FIG. 1, the patron&apos;s location information may be
 obtained by the EMS 100 in a variety of ways. For example, the EMS client
 120 running on the patron device 102 may communicate the patron&apos;s
 location information to the EMS 100 (e.g., periodically or continually).
 For example, in one embodiment, the patron device includes GPS capability
 and forwards the patron&apos;s GPS information to the EMS 100. In other
 embodiments, the EMS 100 receives the location information from another
 source, such as from the cellular network associated with the patron
 device 102. For example, the patron device 102 may forward an appropriate
 device identifier to the EMS 100, and the EMS 100 can provide the device
 identifier to a cellular network, location tracking system, or other
 entity which forwards location information to the EMS 100 in response.

 [0062] The location tracking functionality can be initiated in a variety of
 ways. For example, in one embodiment, the EMS 100 begins tracking the
 patron&apos;s location when the patron places an order or otherwise indicates
 that they will be arriving at the venue, or when the patron logs in to
 the EMS 100.

 [0063] In some embodiments, the location information is received from the
 patron device 102 via a web interface. For example, as discussed, the
 patron device 102 may interact with the EMS 100 via a web interface
 running on a browser rather than via a separate EMS client 120. In such
 embodiments, the web interface may request location data from the patron
 device 102. As an illustrative example, the patron device 102 can be a
 Blackberry device having GPS capability accessible via an API such as JSR
 179. Such devices may include BlackBerry 8800, 8820, 8310 and/or 8110
 smartphone devices, for example, and can be configured to enable
 JavaScript and JavaScript Location support, for example. It will be
 appreciated that the web interface of the EMS 100 could implement
 JavaScript executable in conjunction with such a patron device 102 to
 obtain an indication of the latitude and longitude of the patron device
 102. For example, one or more for the following JavaScript functions
 and/or variables can be used to retrieve the patron device 102 location:
 blackberry.location.onLocationUpdate( ) blackberry.location.latitude;
 blackberry.location.longitude; and blackberry.location.refreshLocation( )
 It will be appreciated that script-based commands and functions, such as
 the JavaScript identified above, can, in accordance with known
 techniques, be associated with a hyperlink or button using, for example,
 the onclick attribute of a button or hyperlink object. While this example
 technique is described with respect to a Blackberry device, similar
 techniques can be implemented for generally other devices (e.g., Apple
 iPhones or other smart phones or PDAs) such as any mobile device having
 GPS capability or another appropriate type of locating technology.

 [0064] The patron&apos;s location can be used to trigger certain events such as
 the execution of an order or a notification of venue personnel, in some
 cases, such as when the patron is within a certain predetermined distance
 of the venue, when arrival time is calculated to be within a
 predetermined period of time, or based on some other criteria.

 [0065] Estimated arrival time can be determined in a variety of ways. In
 one embodiment, for example, the EMS 100 directly receives an indication
 of how fast the patron is moving from the patron device 102 or from some
 other source. The EMS 100 can combine the speed information with location
 information to calculate an estimated arrival time. In some embodiments,
 the EMS 100 provides the patron with an interface for indicating an
 estimated arrival time, which can be used instead of, or in addition to
 the location data to trigger events or for other purposes.

 [0066] In some configurations, the EMS 100 calculates the arrival time from
 a plurality of location readings. For example, the EMS 100 may receive a
 first location reading from the patron device 102 at a first time and a
 second location reading from the patron device 102 at a second time. The
 EMS 100 can use these readings to determine how far the patron 102 has
 moved over the time between the first and second readings. From this
 information, the EMS 100 can calculate how fast the patron is moving and
 calculate an estimated arrival time. In one embodiment, for example, the
 patron device 102 accesses the EMS 100 through a web interface rather
 than through a separate client 120. The web interface presents the patron
 with a customized menu as described herein through which the patron can
 select various menu items and eventually place their order. In the
 example embodiment, the EMS 100 web interface is configured to obtain the
 patron device 102 location and communicate it to the EMS 100 upon certain
 patron interactions with the web interface. For example, the EMS 100 web
 interface may retrieve the patron device 102 location when the patron
 logs-in, selects a menu item, confirms his or her order, etc., or
 otherwise interacts with the web interface. For example, the web
 interface may be configured to call appropriate web functions (e.g.,
 JavaScript functions such as those described above) for retrieving the
 location of the patron device 102 when the user selects buttons, links or
 other items on the web interface associated with patron interactions with
 the web interface. Those of ordinary skill will appreciate that the
 location information, once obtained by the patron device 102, may be
 represented by values assigned to parameters that may be transmitted to
 the EMS 100, for example, via a hyperlink selection. The EMS 100 can use
 two or more location readings over one or more time intervals to
 calculate the current travel speed (e.g., distance traversed in a period
 of time) of the patron and determine an estimated arrival time.

 [0067] FIG. 3 is a flow diagram 300 illustrating example operation of an
 EMS according to embodiments described herein. The operational blocks of
 the flow diagram 300 illustrate possible operations and functionality
 associated with certain example EMS&apos;s. However, one or more of these
 operational blocks may not be included in other EMS&apos;s which are,
 nonetheless, within the scope of embodiments of the present disclosure,
 or other operational blocks may be included instead of, or in addition
 to, the illustrated operational blocks. Moreover, while the operational
 blocks are described in a particular order for the purposes of
 illustration, in other configurations or use scenarios the operational
 blocks may be performed in a variety of different orders.

 [0068] At operational block 302, a patron can register with the EMS and
 create a profile including information such as favorite waiters, dishes,
 ingredients, drinks, restaurants, preferred hotel amenities, preferred
 seating and other personalized information. Such information can be
 stored in an EMS database at operational block 304.

 [0069] At operational block 306, venue operators such as managers or owners
 can register with the EMS and set up an account, and create a profile
 including settings, menu, pricing, and other data relevant to their
 offerings. At operational block 308, this information can be stored in
 the EMS database.

 [0070] At operational block 310, the EMS system serves an EMS client
 application to the patron&apos;s mobile device (e.g., a smart phone) and the
 EMS client application is launched. In alternative embodiments, no
 special client application is needed, and the patron&apos;s device may
 interact with the EMS system using a common standard application, such as
 a web browser. At operational block 312, the patron is provided with an
 EMS menu providing a variety of options. For example, custom offerings
 can be provided to the patron based on their geolocation, profile,
 settings, or other criteria and such offerings can be selected by the
 patron and provided to the user by the EMS system at operational block
 314. At operational block 312, the EMS client may further present the
 user with selections for interacting with other EMS patron&apos;s. The patron
 may select such an option and, at operational block 316, share, create
 invites, and perform other social networking tasks with his or her
 friends and/or other patrons, such as those who are visiting the same
 venue, using the EMS.

 [0071] Additionally, at operational block 318, the EMS client can present
 the patron with an option to select or search for a venue. Upon selection
 of this option, the patron can select this option, search for a venue
 such as a restaurant, casino, hotel, or other venue. The search can be
 based on a variety of criteria including the geolocation of the patron, a
 name based search, type of desired service, price-point, menu, location
 of the venue and/or other criteria. In one embodiment, the user can
 select from a list of stored favorite venues.

 [0072] At operational block 320, once the patron has selected a venue, he
 or she is presented an interface (e.g., over the EMS client or venue
 provided interface) having menu offerings.

 [0073] As shown at operational block 322, the menu can be custom-generated
 based on the information stored in the EMS database that is related to
 the particular patron and/or venue, creating a personalized experience
 for the patron. At operational block 324, the user can interact with the
 menu in a variety of ways. For example, the user can select particular
 menu offerings for purchase, modify orders, select favorite items, etc.
 In one embodiment, the EMS provides an electronic shopping cart. As
 shown, the EMS also allows the user to share information such as prior
 experiences, with other patrons or perform other social networking type
 activities at operational block 316.

 [0074] At operational block 326, the patron may complete an order and may
 request that the transaction be completed. In some embodiments, at
 operational block 328, the location of the patron&apos;s mobile device is
 tracked using GPS, triangulation, or some other mechanism. The patron&apos;s
 location can be used to trigger the actual execution of the order in some
 cases, such as when the patron is within a certain predetermined distance
 of the venue or when arrival time is calculated to be within a
 predetermined period of time.

 [0075] At operational blocks 330, the EMS detects whether the venue is
 equipped with a point of sale system. If so, the EMS causes the patron&apos;s
 order to be automatically processed through the POS system at operational
 block 332. If there is no point of sale system, the order information may
 be delivered to the venue in some other manner for processing, such as at
 operational block 334. For example, the data related to the order can be
 transmitted by fax, email, text message or some other electronic medium.
 Additionally, the EMS database receives the order information, and
 updates the patron and/or venue profile information and/or other EMS
 database information at operational block 304, 308. At operational block
 336, the EMS can generate reports, such as real-time or historical
 reports. For example, the EMS may provide the reports through a web
 portal.

 [0076] FIG. 4 illustrates a portion of an example graphical user interface
 (GUI) 400 provided to a restaurant venue for interacting with the
 experience management system. The GUI may form a part of the
 administrator interface 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1, for
 example. In one embodiment, the GUI is a web site or other portal served
 by the EMS and accessible through a browser running on a computing device
 associated with the venue. The GUI 400 generally provides the venue
 operator with a portal for interacting with the EMS.

 [0077] The web page of the GUI 400 shown in FIG. 4 includes charts and
 other statistical information related to patron purchases. For example,
 the GUI 400 includes patron activity information 402 including patrons
 names, the dollar amount of the patron&apos;s order, logon and activity
 information, a table or seating used by the patron, what type of mobile
 device the patron used, the patron&apos;s IP address. The page shown in FIG. 4
 also includes a pie chart 404 which shows a demographic breakdown of
 patrons, by age, for example. Bar charts 406, 408, show historical income
 information by date and by month, respectively. In addition to the
 information presented to the venue operator in the illustrated example,
 EMS may generally present any other appropriate information stored in the
 EMS database to the venue operator.

 [0078] The EMS may provide other functionality to the venue operator
 through the GUI, such as on other web pages available through a set of
 links 406. For example, the venue operator may follow a link to a
 configuration page, which can be used to configure the venue&apos;s profile,
 login information, etc. Another link may provide access to a page which
 can be used to modify the venue&apos;s available menu items, associated
 prices, etc.

 [0079] FIGS. 5A-5D illustrate portions of an example GUI 500 provided to a
 patron for interacting with the experience management system. For
 example, the GUI can be provided to a user&apos;s mobile device 502. The GUI
 500 may form a part of the EMS client 120 of FIG. 1, for example. In some
 embodiments, the GUI 500 runs on a customized software application or
 module that is downloaded form the EMS to the patron&apos;s mobile device. In
 other embodiments, the GUI may be served to a web browser running on the
 patron&apos;s device.

 [0080] FIG. 5A shows a home page 504 that may be provided to the patron,
 after he or she has provided EMS login information, for example. In the
 illustrated embodiment, the menu 504 includes a plurality of links
 directing the patron to various portions of the GUI 500, including: (1) a
 Profile link directing the patron to an area of the GUI 500 where the
 user can modify his or her EMS profile information; (2) a Friends link
 directing the patron to another area of the GUI 500 where he or she can
 interact with other EMS users in a social networking environment provided
 by the EMS; (3) a Messages link where users can send and receive messages
 from other EMS users, venues, or other sources; (4) an Events link where
 the patron can organize, monitor or otherwise view EMS events; and (5) a
 Restaurants link where the user can search for restaurant venues.

 [0081] FIG. 5B shows an example menu offering page 506 of a restaurant
 venue of the GUI 500. For example, in one scenario, the patron selects
 the Restaurants link of the page of the GUI 500 shown in FIG. 5A. The
 patron is then directed to another page where he or she can select a
 particular restaurant venue. The menu offerings page 506 can
 advantageously be customized according to the patron&apos;s profile
 information. For example, the EMS may process the patron&apos;s profile
 information stored in the EMS database and generate a personalized menu
 from the available menu options indicated in the venue&apos;s profile
 information, also stored in the EMS database. The customized menu page of
 FIG. 5B may then be presented to the patron, and the patron can select
 from a variety of options including categories of menu items (e.g.,
 Salads, Soups, Appetizer, Steak on Charcoal, Alcoholic Beverages),
 particular offerings (e.g., Lunch Special), etc.

 [0082] A variety of other types of functions and interfaces may be provided
 to the patron over the EMS client. For example, patrons may also be able
 to make reservations with the venue using the GUI 500 in certain
 embodiments. In some embodiments, patrons can make special requests or
 provide other details to the venue (e.g., for birthdays, anniversaries,
 request a type of seating such as a booth, etc.). The EMS client may
 provide directions and driving details (e.g., by providing embedded
 access Google Maps or some other on-line mapping software). The EMS
 client may additionally allow patrons to perform social networking with
 other EMS users to organize group events and send out invitations.

 [0083] Once the patron has selected a particular menu item using the GUI
 500, the EMS client may then direct the user to a menu item page 508 such
 as the one shown in FIG. 5C including a detailed description of the item.
 The description can include price information 509 and other information
 510 relating the menu item. For example, information related to the
 offering such as nutritional content, ingredients, a recipe, and/or
 marketing information can be included. In one embodiment, if the user has
 an allergy to a listed ingredient, that ingredient is highlighted. The
 user may also be able to modify ingredients in some embodiments.
 Additionally, the example page 508 includes an Add to Order button 512
 for ordering the item or placing it in an electronic shopping cart and an
 Add to Favorites button 515 allowing a patron to add the item to a list
 of favorite menu items.

 [0084] FIG. 5D shows a profile page 516 of the GUI 500, which may be
 accessible by clicking the Profile link of the home page 504 of FIG. 5A,
 for example. The profile page 516 can present various profile information
 to the patron and/or provide an interface for the patron to modify their
 profile information. Example types of information can include, without
 information, the patron&apos;s name, age, birthday, residence, current
 location, current status, food preferences, food dislikes, interests,
 contact info, and the like.

 [0085] While FIGS. 5A-5D show one example GUI 500 which can be provided by
 an EMS client running on a patron&apos;s mobile device, a variety of other
 configurations are possible in other embodiments. For example, in some
 cases, additional pages related to other types of venues are provided,
 such as casinos, hotels, retail venues, and the like.

 [0086] FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate further embodiments of patron experience
 management systems 600, 700 in accordance with the present disclosure.
 FIGS. 6 and 7 each respectively illustrate an EMS system 600, 700 having
 a relational database 614, 714. The EMS system 600, 700 of each of FIGS.
 6 and 7 are additionally associated with a POS system 606, 607, venue
 computing device 604, 704, which may include an associated administrator
 interface 610, 710, and a patron device 602, 702, which may include an
 EMS client application 620, 720. In certain embodiments, these components
 or other components illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 may be similar to or
 provide similar functionality as the corresponding components shown in
 FIG. 1.

 [0087] FIG. 6 illustrates a configuration in which the POS system 606
 includes one or more servers 622 and a POS server interface 624 in
 communication with a POS module 626 via a POS API 628. The POS system 606
 is in communication with one or more EMS servers 612 over a secured
 network connection 630, such as via a POS gateway. A venue service 616
 running on the server 612 may include one or more private service and/or
 third party API&apos;s 632. The API&apos;s 632 may enable communication between the
 EMS 600 and one or more of the POS system 606, the patron device 602 and
 the EMS database 614, for example.

 [0088] The administrator interface 610 running on the venue computing
 device 604 can be in communication via an encrypted network connection
 634 with the venue service 616. For example, the administrator interface
 610 may be configured for communication through a private web portal 636
 of the venue service 616.

 [0089] A user service 618 running on the EMS server 612 can include a
 public web portal 636 for allowing access to the EMS database 614. The
 venue service 618 can implement one or more public service and/or one or
 more third party API&apos;s 638, such as for communicating with the patron
 device 602 and/or EMS database 614.

 [0090] The configuration of FIG. 7 includes some components which are
 similar to the EMS 600 of FIG. 6, including a POS module 726, POS API
 728, POS server interface 724, and an administrator interface 710, for
 example. However, in addition to the EMS server 712, the EMS 700 of FIG.
 7 includes one or more supplemental EMS servers 730 including a database
 736.

 [0091] The supplemental EMS server 730 may be associated with or physically
 located at a specific venue or chain of venues, for example. In some
 embodiments, the supplemental EMS server 730 communicates with the POS
 106 via a network connection 732 such as a TCP/IP connection. In one
 embodiment, the supplemental EMS server 730 serves a content manager
 service (e.g., a web site) 734 to an administrator interface 710 of the
 venue computing device 704. Some of the information from the database 736
 may be communicated to the administrator interface 710 or modified using
 the administrator interface 710 via the content manager service 734, for
 example.

 [0092] A connection manager 738 running on the supplemental EMS server 730
 may be in communication with the patron device 702, via an XML interface
 740, for example. A venue service 742 (e.g., associated with a particular
 restaurant) may be implemented on the supplemental EMS server 730 and can
 communicate with a patron device 702 through a network connection 744,
 such as a TCP/IP connection.

 [0093] The supplemental EMS server 730 may be in communication with the EMS
 server 712 over a network connection 746. For example, an SSL/PSec
 connection is used in one embodiment. The EMS server 712 of certain
 embodiments runs a global service 748 and/or serves a global EMS website
 750.

 [0094] FIG. 8 illustrates a high-level diagram of an example computing

 [0104] FIG. 9 illustrates a high-level diagram of an example EMS 900 in
 accordance with certain embodiments described herein. While many
 different organizational schemes may be utilized for the EMS database
 900, in certain embodiments, the database 900 is organized into the
 following categories of data. Certain example types of data are described
 for each category. In certain embodiments, the EMS 900 may be organized
 into a number of separate data tables associated with the types of data
 described, or other types of appropriate data.

 TABLE -US-00001
 TYPE OF DATA DESCRIPTION
 PATRON DATA Patron data 905 can include a wide variety of information
 relating to
 EMS patrons. For example, patron data 905 can include records for
 each patron having an account or otherwise associated with the EMS.
 Each record can be identified by a unique id associated with the
 particular patron, for example. Each record can include profile
 information related to the patron. Such profile information can include
 personal information such as, without limitation: name; gender; an
 image to display on their EMS profile page; birth date; interests;
 profession, account status (e.g., active, banned, last access, permission
 levels, etc.), events the patron is associated with, etc., favorites such
 as
 favorite books, movies, music, television shows, etc. Patron data 905
 can further include tables related to certain EMS events that the user is
 associated with. Patron data 905 records can further include
 information such as whether the user has accounts with particular
 types of third party applications and services such as applications or
 services provided by Yahoo, Skype, Facebook, Google, etc. Particularly
 where the EMS is capable for use in a restaurant context, the patron
 data 905 records may include F&amp;B;related information including:
 preferred restaurants, diet restrictions, allergies, preferred
 ingredients,
 food and beverage likes, dislikes and favorites, other EMS patrons or
 groups of patrons in the patrons EMS social network, etc. In one
 embodiment, the Patron data 905 includes a FRIEND table that
 includes the unique patron id of each patron that is a &quot;friend.&quot; In
 addition, in one embodiment, the Patron data 905 includes payment
 source information for a patron, such as credit card information (e.g.,
 card type, card number, security code, expiration date, full name,
 billing address) or alternative sources of payment, such as, for
 example, debit card, PAYPAL account information, etc.
 VENUE DATA Venue data 910 includes data related to venues having EMS
 accounts.
 For example, the EMS database 900 may include a venue data 910
 record associated with each registered venue. Venue data can include,
 for example, any of the following: venue type, description, hours,
 location or locations; website; logo; description; contact information;
 services, products or other offerings provided by the venue and
 associated prices; reviews associated with the venue or with particular
 venue offerings; EMS account information for the venue (e.g., account
 status, employees authorized for EMS administration access, etc.). As
 an illustrative example, in a restaurant context the venue data 915 may
 include, without limitation: currently available menu offerings;
 ingredients, prices, images, recipes, reviews, and the like associated
 with each menu offering or group of menu offerings; reviews and/or
 ratings associated with the restaurant (e.g., overall ratings or ratings
 related to service, food, atmosphere, etc.). Where a chain of restaurants
 are registered with the EMS, chain-wide information may be included
 in the venue data 910. Such information may include identifiers linked
 to EMS records for each restaurant in the chain, chain-wide menu
 offerings, promotional offerings, venue employees authorized access to
 chain-wide EMS data, venue employees authorized to access EMS data
 associated with specific restaurants in the chain, etc.
 VENUE PORTAL In certain embodiments, venue portal data 915 includes
 information
 DATA associated with the EMS portal for a particular venue. Such
 information can include information associated with the venue that is
 generally not accessible to patrons through the EMS, for example. In
 various embodiments, venue portal data 915 includes alert criteria
 which may define rules for triggering EMS issued alerts to venue
 employees (e.g., when a VIP enters a venue, or when there is a service
 issue identified via patron feedback) or for taking other actions. In one
 embodiment, venue portal data 915 includes payment types (e.g., types
 of credit cards) accepted by the venue. In other embodiments, the
 venue portal data 915 is stored along with the venue data 910 and is
 not organized into a separate category.
 ADMIN DATA Admin data 920 can include records relating to EMS
 administration
 and configuration. For example, admin data 920 may be organized into
 records for individual EMS administrators, such as venue employees
 authorized to access the EMS (e.g., chain managers, restaurant
 managers, etc.), administrators authorized to administer the EMS
 servers and/or database, etc. Such records can include information
 related to the authorized users such as login information, name, email,
 phone number, etc., and may be linked to the particular venue or chain
 of venues they are associated with.
 SESSION DATA Session data 925 can include records storing information
 related to
 EMS sessions such as patron and/or venue administrator EMS
 sessions. For example, a session can include an EMS client session
 where a session is established between an EMS client running on a
 patron&apos;s mobile device and an EMS server, for example. Other types of
 sessions may include sessions established between an administrator
 interface of a venue computing device and an EMS server, for
 example.

 [0105] In certain embodiments, the EMS database 900 may include all of the
 categories and/or types of data described above, a subset thereof, or may
 include additional categories and/or types of data and associated records
 and tables. The information in the database 900 may be organized
 differently in various embodiments. For example, in certain embodiments,
 some or all of the information described as included in venue portal data
 915 is instead included in venue data 910. Additionally, in certain
 embodiments, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art,
 different portions of the database 700 may be physically stored on
 different computers, such as different physical servers associated with
 the EMS.

 [0106] Although a variety of database configurations are possible, FIGS.
 10, 11 (including 11-1 and 11-2) and 12 (including 12-1, 12-2, 12-3,
 12-4, 12-5 and 12-6) illustrate relational database diagrams of an
 example experience management database in accordance with certain
 embodiments described herein.

 [0107] Conditional language used herein, such as, among others, &quot;can,&quot;
 &quot;could,&quot; &quot;might,&quot; &quot;may,&quot; &quot;e.g.,&quot; and the like, unless specifically stated
 otherwise, or otherwise understood within the context as used, is
 generally intended to convey that certain embodiments include, while
 other embodiments do not include, certain features, elements and/or
 states. Thus, such conditional language is not generally intended to
 imply that features, elements and/or states are in any way required for
 one or more embodiments or that one or more embodiments necessarily
 include logic for deciding, with or without author input or prompting,
 whether these features, elements and/or states are included or are to be
 performed in any particular embodiment.

 [0108] Depending on the embodiment, certain acts, events, or functions of
 any of the methods described herein can be performed in a different
