I&apos;m definitely not a fried chicken expert.
Went for lunch, got the 4 piece dark meat, with a biscuit.
Nice, mild cajun seasoning.  Nice and juicy.  Not so steaming hot as fresh out of the frier usually is.  The guy behind me was told his order would be a few minutes, as a new batch had just gone in, so freshly cooked is a throw of the dice.
Biscuit was good.  I was not as amazed as most people seem to be.
Definitely better than fast food.
I&apos;d go back.

Tried this place on a whim after a sudden fried chicken craving. My main complaint is that the fries tasted cold/stale. On a positive note, the portion was huge. The chicken wasn&apos;t anything special apart from KFC, Popeyes or any of the other major chicken chains. And the honey butter biscuits are a nice idea, but not great.

Aside from the food, the set-up inside for dine-in was a little off-putting. Loud TVs, wobbly chairs and no sun protection whatsoever on the store front windows that face west. (I ate there around sunset and even though it was in the 30s outside, I felt like I was getting a tan.) The inside decor is appealing and very clean overall, but it was mostly uncomfortable.

If you want to know how a fast food chain should be run, go to this one at this location. I went here for lunch one day and the place was incredibly clean, the service was fast and the person behind the counter was friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. Now on to the food.

I got the 3 piece mixed with jambalaya, biscuit and cajun sauce.

The chicken was as advertised: Krispy and Krunchy. If you like a hard crunchy coating on your chicken this is your place. I enjoyed it very much.

The jambalaya was ok, it didnt have sausage or peppers in it. Only rice and large chunks of chicken. I suspect thats because this restaurant is halal or something.

The biscuit was slightly sweet and crumbly. It was alright.

Kudos on the fantastic service, clean dining room, and great chicken. I&apos;m definitely going back.

Apparently the place finished renovating a couple weeks ago. The cashier was friendly. Answered all my questions and let me sample a chicken tender. I got #1, the dark meat combo with biscuit. The biscuit was good, like others said, its unique but not out of the world amazing. The chicken seems inconsistent. The drumstick and chicken tender I had was dry and kind of flavorless. I think they had sat for a little too long. (I showed up at 7pm) The thigh was an entirely different story. It was the most moist, flavorful, yet krispy and krunchy thigh I have ever had at a fried chicken place. I think if every piece of fried chicken was like that thigh, I would only eat fried chicken.

So I tried Krispy Krunchy Chicken at their Lombard location back a few months ago before it closed down and I fell in love with their recipe! So delicious and different and the fact that it&apos;s Zabiha Halal is a huge plus because I can actually eat non-vegetarian meals when I&apos;m out.

After being devastated to find out they closed down in Lombard, I was discussing their yummy flavors with my cousins who told me about their Schaumburg location and I went crazy! Absolutely clean, even their bathrooms! And the people working there are so sweet. I loved the menu and we ended up getting just a family meal with 8 pieces and chicken tenders for our daughter who is quite picky mind you and we all left super satisfied! After that I&apos;ve been telling everyone to try it and I actually just had take out from there last night :-D

I&apos;d go there again and again, MUCH MUCH better than KFC. There&apos;s no questioning that I will stop there to eat every time I&apos;m in the area!

I&apos;ve been here twice, once when they were still in their old location on the other end of the strip mall, and the location they are in now is much more aesthetically pleasing.  Not that that matters to me, I eat anything anywhere.  There&apos;s no 5 second rule for me.  One of my favorite places to get fried rice has one of those bullet-proof turnstile things to give you your food and take your money at the same time.  But enough about me, let&apos;s talk about Krispy Krunchy Chicken!

I love truth in advertising, KKC at least has that.  The chicken is &quot;krispy&quot; and &quot;krunchy&quot;.  It&apos;s also spicy, juicy, and delicious.  And they love to fry everything!  Have you ever had fried corn on the cob?  When you see some sh*t like that on a menu, it&apos;s just begging for you to order it.  It is a strange sight when you unwrap the paper and see this sort of unsightly battered log.  But when you bite into that ugly cylindrical morsel of heaven, you get the salty savory crispy goodness of the batter combined with the sweet taste and juiciness of the corn beneath its golden exterior.

The chicken is good too!  I love their wings, and the breast is cooked through without being too dry.  Good stuff that Krispy Krunchy Chicken is.

I had seen this place many times but never had the nerve to visit...until they had a Groupon. So glad I did!

As all kids do, my young daughter wanted to know what was taking so long. The owner must have heard her and offered her a chicken finger. Instead he comes out with the chicken finger, fries and a honey biscuit. All for free! I thought it was a very nice gesture.

I ordered a family meal and the two-piece catfish combo. While the chicken is good, it&apos;s the catfish that will have me coming back. We&apos;ve been back several times since that first visit.

The chicken I ordered definitely lived up to it&apos;s KRISPY KRUNCHY CHICKEN name.  I&apos;m Presbyterian so the way the chicken is butchered doesn&apos;t mean squat to me.  But this chicken is pretty damn good.  I didn&apos;t come across any dry pieces of meat and every bite had an explosion of flavor from the seasoning and the juicy meat.  Their honey biscuits were solid as well.  I&apos;d definitely come here again and get the same exact meal.  In my dreams, i can still hear the crunching of that crispy chicken from my mouth!!

It is just popeyes with different graphics.

I am neither exited nor turned off by this place (hence the 3 stars).

The jumbalaya tasted like it was made from a mix - I&apos;m sure it was. The chicken tasted just like popeyes - and it is. So I have nothing positive or negative to say about this place. They do have some good deals and the biskets are pretty good so its worth a shot if you are feeling like trying new chicken.

After a few friends raved about this place, I had to try it out. It&apos;s in an unassuming strip mall next to Dick Pond&apos;s Athletics. I&apos;ve tried several Fried Chicken places in California, the normal chains like KFC and Popeyes, and this place is on par with those other places. I ordered a few pieces of Fried Chicken and a couple of biscuits. Here&apos;s how I rate them.

Fried Chicken
Popeyes
Krispy Krunchy
KFC&apos;s original recipe

Biscuits
KFC
Krispy Krunchy
Popeyes

Now, it&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like Krispy Krunchy, but it came out on the saltier side. It also had a spicy kick to it that I wasn&apos;t expecting. They definitely get the &quot;crunchy&quot; part right and it has an awesome coating that makes it true fried chicken, but it did come out fairly salty for my taste. After eating each piece, I wanted to douse my mouth with water. The biscuits were super soft but they were also a bit too crumbly. I enjoy KFC&apos;s biscuits a bit better because they have a bit more of that buttery taste to them and they don&apos;t crumble at my touch.

Would I come here again? Sure. But it&apos;s not the best I&apos;ve ever had.

Less a fan of this place the second time around...

The chicken was all right this time. The more I tasted it, the more I realized it was sort of featureless, and that I didn&apos;t like the krispy krunchy koating as much. The biscuits were still good, though not fresh this time around, and... while I was hoping for something original in the mac n&apos; cheese, I didn&apos;t get it. It tasted like it came out of a box.

At this point I probably couldn&apos;t tell the difference between KKC and KFC.

I love Krispy Krunchy Chicken.

The chicken is so flavorful and uh...CRUNCHY!! I always get the 5 wings, fried corn on the cob (to die for) and extra honey butter biscuits.

The owner and his staff are extremely nice and always try to assist you on deciding what to try. I&apos;ll stick to my usual tho...tried the jambalaya and the mac N cheese and I&apos;ll just say that sides may not be their strong point but they definitely know how to season and fry some chicken!

My first visit will definitely have me going back again.
My husband and I tried a bit of everything-he had the two piece white meat combo and I had the 4 pc. cajun tender combo.  Our side was the jambalaya.  We also ordered a side of fried Okra and 4 boudin bites.
Everything was excellent.  The chicken was very juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside without being too heavily breaded.  The okra had a nice flavor and was very crispy.  The boudin bites were so tasty-as was the cajun-style jambalaya (more smoky flavored-not tomato based like creole style).  Also-THIS LOCATION IS HALAL. And you don&apos;t miss the pork in the boudin or the jambalaya.  Our dinner cost just over $20.  Well worth the cost.  It&apos;s a small place with good food.  Try it.  You&apos;ll be glad you didn&apos;t go the the chain down the street.

I really have mixed feeling about this place.  The chicken is actually quite good.  It could use a little more spice for me personally, but overall good.  The mac and cheese was very blah and I would not get again.  The jambalaya wasn&apos;t great either.  The honey butter biscuits were ok too, you can get better ones at a chain fast food restaurant.

The service was good.  I would consider going back but only if I&apos;m in the area and only for the chicken.

Pros- Nothing.

Cons-
Chicken was way over seasoned.
Mashed Potatoes tasted sour and fake.
Gravy was gross
Jambalaya looked like chicken fried rice.
Price was too much and I couldn&apos;t return the food.

This place is one for the ugly. I would say they need to revamp their entire menu.

Based on the reviews, I was super excited to check this place out since I&apos;m pretty close by.  Let&apos;s face it, I have a weakness for good fried chicken.

Cute place.  The large displays of fried chicken hang on the walls had me excited to get me some!  This place is loaded with the  potential to become my go-to joint for my fried chicken fix based on presentation.

So I&apos;m greeted at the counter by who I think is the owner???  Anyway, he was pretty nice, but obviously trying to sell me on all sorts of items with my 8 pc meal.  I skipped on the extras and just got me some chicken (mixed - both white and dark), fries and biscuits.

Overall, the chicken was good, but nothing that blew my mind.  The biscuits were good.  I liken it to a Popeye biscuit that is basically glazed with honey.  Fries were similar to Popeye&apos;s fries too.

The chicken was good, but I thought that it lacked something.  I just can&apos;t quite put my finger on it.  I don&apos;t think it was salt because some of my pieces had adequate salt.

Either way, it&apos;s good, not great.  I am interested in the catfish based on the pictures.  Not sure if this place has cracked my regular rotation as far as fried chicken is concerned.

I set out to determine if this place offers better fried chicken in comparison to its competitors, KFC and Popeyes. Everyone loves fried chicken but does Krispy Krunchy Chicken stand out to two established chains which are both within driving distance?

I ordered four pieces of mixed chicken with a side of jambalaya, small order of Cajun wings, French fries, and a side of mac and cheese. I was disappointed from the jambalaya and mac and cheese since they lacked flavor and were surprisingly small. Both sides were served in small Styrofoam cups.

The chicken, on the other hand, was unique. The breading was crispy without being oily. The meat inside was juicy and falling off the bone. You can taste the seasoning but I wanted more of it. On the menu, it is referred to as Cajun but I didn&apos;t taste any cayenne. What&apos;s Cajun without cayenne pepper? The butter honey biscuits were spot on. Moist and flaky with a nice sweet buttery finish.

The Cajun wings turned out to be the same flavor as the fried chicken. We ordered sauce on the side and I immediately recognized that the BBQ sauce as Sweet Baby Rays.

Overall, Krispy Krunchy Chicken does an excellent job of offering quality fried chicken along with an extensive menu. The prices were definitely reasonable and allowed me to try several items on the menu. Come here in support of local businesses.

Where else can you get fried chicken, a poboy, pizza, cheeseburger, biscuits, Italian beef, fried catfish, jambalaya, mac and cheese, char dog, gyros, fried okra, cheesecake, and samosas in one place? There is actually more items on the menu too, no joke.

So we were looking to get some chicken. Good chicken, fried chicken, but didn&apos;t want to settle on fast food chicken. After seeing the polarizing reviews here, we decided to give it a try and were excited.

Needless to say, it definitely hit the spot and we will absolutely be returning to try out every corner of the menu!

The honey biscuits are as good as everyone says, and yes the owner is a very friendly and helpful guy. Super fresh chicken that is as tasty and juicy as I could have hoped for.

You&apos;re not going to find better in the suburbs, I can promise you that!

We went here two different times and had two totally different experiences with the food.

Visit one, we were there right after opening. The service was excellent, the chicken was fresh - and I got a lesson on how they make it. It&apos;s spicy. It&apos;s never frozen. It&apos;s awesome. Brought some of their chicken strips to a party and they were well received. I literally took a bite of it and said, &quot;This is the best damn chicken I&apos;ve ever had in my life.&quot;

Visit Two, we had the same experience with the service, but the chicken was not so hot and fresh. However, it was still juicy and not dried out.

Both times, the biscuits were to die for.
The fries are great, cajun fries.

There was a recent episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; which was all about the halal method of Fried Chicken, which gave me the giggles after having heard about it from here.

If you like fried chicken, give it a try. I&apos;ll take this over Popeye&apos;s anyday, but likely not over some real Soul Food Fried Chicken. ;)

Great flavor on chicken, however when you bite into it, you can tell its not so fresh. It has a funny taste and smell when you get close to the bone.  A fresh batch of chicken would&apos;ve called for 5 stars. Since this is a chicken restaurant, I know not to order macaroni, jambalaya etc..... Although I have on the past, I know not to order those things anymore. The fried okra was plentiful and well seasoned. The staff is very nice and helpful. I&apos;d continue to go back in hopes thats the chicken is fresh.

This place has the best chicken I&apos;ve ever had! The chicken itself was incredibly moist and the breading had a fantastic flavor. We got a little bit of almost everything to try. The catfish was fresh, the fried corn (not something I will regularly get simply because I don&apos;t want to become a house) was decadent and flavorful, and the fried okra was like going back down south. And while everything was fried, it was not greasy.

For those of you that are adventurous, you should try the samosa, not something one would expect to find at a fried chicken joint. For those of you who have never had it, I liken it to a cross between a Spanish empanada and a Greek spanakopita. It has a light, crispy, flaky wrap, with a flavorful meaty center.

And while everything was amazing, the star of the show were the biscuits. They were light and flaky with a not too overly sweet honey butter glaze on top. I could, unfortunately for my thighs, eat 4 of them before even realizing it. If I had the will power, I would have saved one for breakfast tomorrow... but I didn&apos;t have that will power : ).

And to top it all off, the owner is the nicest most gracious man I have meet in a long time. He was happy to go over the menu with us, and answer any questions we had. He was also rather proud, as he should be, to tell us how the chicken he served was certified farm raised. I assured him we would be back, and we will!

Krispy Krunchy Chicken has 5 stars for a reason!

It really is some fantastic chicken. I went last week with my friend and we grabbed some carryout. The guy with the dreamy eyes working there was extremely helpful telling us what was great and what he would recommend. He totally upsold us by convincing us to try some of their samosas. Everything I had was very good. Tasty samosas, yummy chicken fingers, cheesy mac&amp;cheese and extremely good honey biscuits! The price is good, too! Plus all of their chicken is halal which can make you feel a bit better about eating there!

The skin on their chicken has a very different flavoring then other places and be warned it has a bit of a kick to it...it&apos;s very slight though even for me who is super weak with spice.

Krispy Krunchy is definitely better then Brown&apos;s or KFC and I highly recommend giving them a try!

I love me some Krispy Krunchy!  Their krispy krunch fried chicken has a nice cajun seasoning, juicy, and is just packed with flavor.  Really good fried chicken, plus they only serve Halal chicken.  I also can&apos;t get enough of those hot biscuits drizzled with honey.  I&apos;ll definitely order extra next time.  Some fried chicken + honey biscuits = perfect combo.  My meal also included cajun fries, which were nicely battered and had great seasoning.  I was pleasantly surprised with the samosas, which were not dry and packed with beef&amp;some jalapenos, with a flaky crust.

The service was great, as the owner was very enthusiastic about the food and gave many reccomendations.  The hot sauce they serve is Frank&apos;s Redhot, but it would be awesome if they also had some Sriracha.  Other options included burgers and poboys, but the owner highly recommended the gyros.  I love me some good gyros and will for sure be back.

I went here last night after trying a honey biscuit (super delicious!) from someone else&apos;s dinner, and it was fantastic.  My boyfriend ran in to get a take out menu just to see what they had, and the guy who runs the place asked if it was out first visit and gave us a free sample!  Which, if I might add, was a nice sized sample.

Needless to say, we definitely went back.  The owner/Mgr was very friendly, and their menu has a little bit of everything!  We got chicken strips, which were, super crispy and have a little spice to them (yum), fries, mac and cheese, and those AMAZING honey biscuits!!!  To finish off all that, we got a piece of his HOMEMADE cheesecake topped with strawberries, also delicious.

I will be going back for sure!

As a caveat, any fried chicken place reviewed after my discovery of Harold&apos;s Chicken Shack is doomed. This place looked like it had potential but at the end of the day it was just alright.

Myself being a noob, the owner was super nice and helpful when I tried to figure out what to order. I got the 3-piece meal with a honey butter biscuit and jambalaya.

The chicken was okay, crispy and tasty but the meat at times seemed undercooked. Biscuits were good but nothing to sweat over. I was excited to get jambalaya as a side but I was pretty disappointed by the quality of it - kinda bland, no kick, and dry.

In the burbs, I&apos;ll still be visiting Popeyes over this place.

The new management/ownership has transformed this place. The nickel and diming has halted. The service is great. The staff takes the time to listen on improving the quality of the product - which is 3 star worth, in my book.

Will revisit.

mmmmm......  some of the best fried chicken I have had....krispy krunchy definitely delivers crispy and crunchy deliciousness.  I think what we love most is that underneath the tasty outside, the meat itself is also flavorful.  We love love love the honey drizzled biscuits...

We also decided to give the catfish a try since we have been looking for a good fried catfish place for awhile and we think this is the place!!! Fish is cooked to order.....perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious.

Such a great find in the area and we will have  a hard time prying ourselves away from this place....yikes!!!!

Chicken was FANTASTIC and the biscuit was light and delicious. It was also a big plus that they offer Dr Pepper. After all, it IS just what the doctor ordered!

I had the 4pc tenders combo with honey mustard sauce and fries. I was quite full after only 3 tenders and brought the fourth one home for tomorrow&apos;s lunch.

PROS:

Very clean and inviting dining room, friendly employees!

DELICIOUS, crunchy, juicy chicken and heavenly biscuits. We will definitely come back! The tenders were fantastic and the chicken breasts were some of the meatiest I have seen. My husband&apos;s favorite food is fried chicken and Popeye&apos;s is his true favorite...he says this beats Popeye&apos;s for sure. This will be our new go-to place for chicken!

CONS:

The sides. My husband had the mashed potatoes&amp;gravy and I had the seasoned fries...both were quite forgetable. We agreed that we will do without the sides next time and just enjoy the chicken and a biscuit.

The nickel-and-diming. The drink that comes with your combo meal is very small and the refils are $.50. Also, they give you one tiny little tub of dipping sauce for the 4 huge tenders (it&apos;s not enough) and an additional sauce is $.25.  Seems to me like having completely satisfied customers would be worth the extra dollar they would have to sacrifice in offering free refills and an extra container of sauce. :-)

We happened to drive past Krispy Krunchy Chicken when we were looking for a place to eat dinner.  The sign caught our eye so we decided to stop in.  Thank goodness we did!

The chicken absolutely lives up to its name.  It&apos;s crispy, it&apos;s crunchy, and it&apos;s delicious!  The breading is very flavorful and cajun, but not too spicy.  We ordered a family meal (at a great price), with fries and biscuits.

The biscuits are to-die-for.  Coated with honey, they are the perfect compliment to the chicken.  And the fries were seasoned/cajun and also delicious.

The only thing I will say is that everything is fried, so if you&apos;re a health nut or looking for healthier options, you won&apos;t find that here.  But it&apos;s okay to indulge, especially in this chicken! : )

The chicken is really good.  Nice and moist.  Both the white and dark meat.  The biscuits are sooooo good!

The Jambalya is not bad but the Boudin bites are not that great at all.  It is fried Jambalya, the outer crust is just not a good texture nor flavor.

I must warn you, the prices you see on their website are no where near accurate.  The site is a corporate site and the prices at this place are almost 2 dollars more on every item.  I was quite shocked that a 2 piece white combo, a 2 piece white w/ biscuit, and 2 boudin bites were almost 15 bucks.  For the same money I could eat at a sit down restaurant instead of ordering fast food.

update: I found on their takeout menu a web site for prices. http://www.chicagokrispy… but it doesn&apos;t work....

While dog-sitting out in the burbs my wife and I passed this place. The name put my wife in an odd trance. She started muttering &quot;Krispy Krunchy Chicken&quot;. Eventually she awoke from said trance and exclaimed, I want Krispy Krunchy Chicken!&quot; Never one to question  the little woman&apos;s instincts in these matters, I wheeled the car around and we commenced to buying chicken. Spectacular stuff! Both Krispy&amp;Krunchy and those biscuits are better than any I&apos;ve had... and I was raised in the DEEP south. Can&apos;t wait to get back.

Was looking for a fried chicken place that wasn&apos;t KFC or Popeyes near me, and didn&apos;t want to drive to Browns so I found this place on Yelp. It was a good change of pace. I ordered the 8 piece all white piece meal and received 4 really big pieces, and 4 small size wings. My fault that I forgot that white meat is only thighs and wings. Other then that price was good for the food I received. Biscuits were a little dry however. Wait was not long at all for the chicken as their dining room is very nice and clean. Also the person working the register was very friendly and answered any questions I had. If you are looking for a good alternative to KFC and Popeyes this is the place.

So many mixed reviews on this place, but yet it&apos;s HOT ON YELP on my Blackberry ap? I had to do research on this place myself, as I&apos;ve yet to find a comparable suburban fix to my beloved Crisp in the city for fried chicken.

So the saying is true, go for the chicken.  We entered and there was only one customer inside this very multi-ethnic strip mall of a fast food restaurant.  The owner was at the counter explaining to the customer that they are halal, which is the equivalent to kosher in their ethnicity. He doesn&apos;t freeze anything and claimed to have fresh chickens brought in every 2 days.  He also deep fries everything at 500 degrees, and then flash fries it again once order is up, which he claims, by doing so makes it healthier because it barely penetrates the chicken with this method.  Deep laughing inside, even chuckled a few outloud.  Healthier? Ooooh kay!

So he gave us some chicken breast tender samples along with a biscuit, and I must say, I was highly impressed with both, esp the chicken breast which is not my favorite cut of meat because of its often dried out interior.  So I gave it whirl, and ordered up a 3 piece mixed with a side of jambalaya and a biscuit and drink for $6.99.  Dinnermate ordered their $4.99 chicken wrap with biscuit and drink.

And that&apos;s where all my positives ended. The dining area needed some much needed sweeping.  I don&apos;t really find that to be an excuse since there didn&apos;t seem to be a rush of orders or a lot of traffic in this place.  The one stall women&apos;s bathroom was clean, but dang, it was propped open, with the garbage can, with no signs of a recent mopping.  Weird.  Even more annoying was the fact that in the dining area, there isn&apos;t a station to get any napkins, utensils or even salt and pepper or ketchup.  I had to stand on the sidelines to ask the owner for extra napkins, which he did politely excuse himself from his current customer; but still, that defeats the purpose of customer self-serv if he&apos;s actually busy. I chalk it up to the fact that he was being cheap; he only gave me 2 napkins.  Shaking my head, again, not a good sign when you have not one, but TWO flat screen tv&apos;s on the walls in your medium sized restaurant.  Even more alarming was WHAT the tv&apos;s were blaring.  Sorry, but when I&apos;m eating, it&apos;s not exactly pleasant to watch things on fire and being blown up on CNN.  Does not make for a good dining experience.

With the exception of the biscuits, the sides are horrifically terrible.  The mac and cheese was mushy, and I literally had only one teaspoon of my teh (nas-teh) jambalaya.  Super gross. They had HALF OF a deep fried corn on the cob for $1.89, which looks pretty savorily good, but still pricy for only being half.

Lastly, as I&apos;ve learned from watching way too much of my fill of reality food shows, is that a restaurant must have their own identity (thanks Gordon Ramsey). This one isn&apos;t just Krispy chicken.  It&apos;s a plethora of food....Fried chicken; po boys both chicken and fish; pizza, hamurgers, Cajun, and even gryos.  AHHHHH, talk about attempting to be an overachiever. It&apos;s way too much.  Gordon would&apos;ve reemed you a new a-hole.  Cut it down, make the food simple and sexy, as he would say.

Go here for just their chicken and biscuits.  If you can, take it home.
