North Miami McDonald’s goes Green

January 6, 2009 by robin606 
 
A former Boston Market fast-food restaurant in North Miami will be converted into a McDonald’s prototype GREEN restaurant conforming to the new LEED or Green building standards. North Miami Mayor Kevin Burns believes the decision to open the first Green Golden Arches facility makes a strong statement about his city’s commitment to the environment.

The building plan includes recycling the demolished Boston Market debris, using energy-efficient materials in construction, and creating a specialized gutter system to route rainwater to sustain the restaurant’s new landscaping. Once the shop opens, McDonald’s plans to utilize locally produced food products whenever possible and to sell their used fry oil to local recyclers.

North Miami’s new Green team is creating a template for all new development in the city that will guide builders in Green practices. Maxine Calloway at the city’s Planning and Development Office is enthusiastic that her ECO friendly guidelines will really make a difference.

A McDonald’s in Chicago will open next summer with a fully-realized Green focus. The front counter will be fabricated out of recycled detergent bottles, the ceiling will be sustainable bamboo, the windows utilize recycled glass and the concrete and roofing materials will be reclaimed materials as well.

“McDonald’s has a history of being a leader in environmental efficiency and social responsibility,”said Jim Carras, Director of Restaurant Development.“Green building is a natural offshoot of that.”

This is an interesting article and the fact that McDonald’s is gonna start building green is impressive. I believe Burger King is doing the same as I recently received a call in regards to a new green BK in Miami. I would love the opportunity to be involved with such a project…
