Located off Santa Anita in Arcadia, this is an organic restaurant featuring healthy wraps and smoothies.  They also have a breakfast featuring healthier, less greasy Mexican food (featuring items like soyrizo).   If you are looking for a healthy place to eat with many meat-free options then this is a solid choice for you.  For any sandwich/wrap they offer, you have the option to get a veggie patty instead.

I ordered the mediterranean wrap with a side of fruit.  The wrap came in a spinach tortilla and was full of chicken, veggies, olives, feta, and a light vinaigrette.   I can&apos;t tell you that it smacked me with flavor, but this was a very guilt free meal, which was perfect before a workout.

I also got their pomerful smoothie.  It came with pomegranate juice and berries and you can taste the fresh fruit in the drink.  It was so packed with fruit that i was very content with my 16 oz smoothie.  I liked it a lot.    This place is located next to a rock climbing place in arcadia.  I will likely return after trying that or after a hike in nearby chantry flats.

Nice healthy wraps and smoothies. Not much I can complain about here.
Portions weren&apos;t very big, but they were ample.
Definitely the kind of place I&apos;d go to when I&apos;m looking for a lite lunch, nothing too heavy to weigh me down.

Came here with my fiance on Friday afternoon for a quick bite to eat. My first impression of this place was that the parking lot was pretty limited (This place is located right next door to the Arc Light rock climbing place and also shares the restroom w/ this place as well) and seating inside was pretty small too (maybe less than 10 tables?).
I ordered the chicken pesto wrap w/o the feta cheese because I am not a fan of feta. I also picked the salad as my side and ordered the peach smoothie (called the peach oomph). My fiance ordered the chipotle chicken wrap with fruit as his side and the pomerful smoothie. We did not wait too long before our drinks were brought out. Then shortly after, our wraps were brought out.
My first impression of my chicken pesto wrap was how flavorful it was. Everything had a crunch or flavor, you could tell it was all nice and fresh and not soggy. But I was pretty disappointed with the size of my side salad... it was less than 1 cup of salad w/ dressing. At Something Healthy in Monrovia, the side salad is huge and their wraps are pretty flavorful as well.
My fiance&apos;s chicken chipotle wrap was really good as well and I was surprised that it wasn&apos;t spicy (which I prefer... I&apos;m not into spicy foods). But his fruit was a few measly cut up pieces of strawberry and 1 thin orange slice cut in half.... that is a pitiful size of a side order.
My peach smoothie was really peachy... (That was the first word I actually used to describe my smoothie to my fiance after my first sip) and really had a nice peach taste. It didn&apos;t taste overly sweet and just seemed perfect to the meal and to this pretty warm day. My fiance&apos;s smoothie was a bit tart for me, but he enjoyed it because he really likes pomegranates.
Overall, food was tasty but the side orders were a bit too skimpy. Pricing here is too expensive (even if it&apos;s organic... I rather eat at Something Healthy in Monrovia because it&apos;s cheaper and better portioned). To be honest, I would probably never eat here again just for that reason. So until pricing drops a few dollars and maybe even get the sides to be a little bit more generous, I won&apos;t be dining here. Oh well, more parking for the rest of the rich people who can afford eating here often.

The hubby and I had a rare lunch sans kids and went to lunch on 7/6. We opted for Natural Selection as we wanted something healthier and lighter. We split the chicken pesto sandwich and spinach salad w/chicken. The chicken pesto sandwich was one of the best I&apos;ve ever tried. It was loaded with fresh greens, pesto, and tender chicken. The bread is hearty-nutty-wheaty in flavor and texture, I just LOVED their bread. I was not expecting much from the salad, other than filling me up and fulfilling part of my vegetable requirement for the day. I was in for a surprise. The salad was peppered w/sliced strawberries, cranberries, feta cheese, and sliced almonds.  Their strawberry vinaigrette was a big hit. The hubby enjoyed a cool refreshing fresh watermelon drink reminiscent of a Mexican agua fresca. The service was great and can&apos;t wait to go back and take the kids.

Wow, what&apos;s up with all the great reviews for this place?  I got the pesto chicken sandwich and there was barely any meat in it...the chicken was cut up into little pieces and there weren&apos;t that many pieces!  I couldn&apos;t tell that there was pesto in the sandwich. All I could taste was the thick,dense bread.  The salad was good , the onions were a nice touch.  Overall disappointed and unlikely to return.

I&apos;ve been waiting to set foot in here for a meal after a nice workout at my gym near by. All organic produce, wraps, salads, burgers, and juices. Prices range between $7-$10. The portions are not large given the price we pay, I wasn&apos;t too delighted about. Great for healthy choices, but I&apos;d move on to the next...

3 1/2 stars!

A close friend actually bought some take out before heading to my house, so my first time tasting this place was a To-Go order! She ordered me this spinach salad with nuts, feta cheese, and this vinaigrette. The salad was pretty good. Nice and crunchy and had a good flavor to it.

I came back a couple of days later and ordered the chipotle wrap. For $9 I got a lentil soup with it. The soup was pretty good. The wrap was average. I barely tasted the chipotle flavor. I had to put some hot sauce on it just to get some flavor.

They offered me a sample of their new flan they are trying to serve for dessert. I&apos;m picky with flan because I have to say that I&apos;ve had my fair share of amazing flan. The flan was pretty dense and semi-sweet.

Overall, I was impressed. Great healthy way to start off the day!

I usually go rock climbing at the arc and natural selection and them share the same bathrooms in the middle. As I was cleaning up the aroma coming from this spot was simply wowing me so I went over to have a taste.

Natural Selection is a little small cafe that serves up very healthy meals. They have breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads, wraps, bowls, and healthy drinks as well.

I opted to try the Chipotle BBQ Burger and I choose Turkey as the meat (or vege if you are vegetarian). As a meat eater, the burger was above my expectations. The turkey patty was flavorful, not juicy as a hamburger patty would be, but not dry like over done chicken either. It worked well with the slight BBQ sauce and lite vinaigrette with the greens and tomato.

After a workout, eating this was the right choice :)

Quality service, indoor and outdoor seating, and the price is fair (my meal was $8.xx after taxes). If you are looking for healthy eating, this is a prime spot to choose.

Whoo hoo! So happy to discover another healthy spot near home! Although most of their menu is for vegans/vegetarians, they have a few options with chicken and turkey. Way to cater to everyone, yay!

I was hoping to catch brunch, but discovered that breakfast is served until noon on weekdays and 2pm on weekends. On the plus side, I got the chance to try their veggie black bean burger while I was there. It was simple, but very fulfilling! Even their ketchup is organic (from the store brand, Annie&apos;s). I tried the fruit&amp;veggie juice, Recharge, which contained carrots, apples and broccoli. Think I&apos;ll just stick to those fruits and veggies while they&apos;re still solid and raw...

Besides being awesome and organic,a section of their menu dedicated to Mexican food so if you&apos;re ever craving non-greasy Mexican food, just know, it exists now!

The parking lot is small (two spaces in front of the store) but there&apos;s plenty of street parking and all for free. Also, if you like indoor rock climbing, there&apos;s a place right next door! Can&apos;t wait to make my next visit with a rock climbing session followed by a healthy meal, mmm.

Im so glad i found this place! (thanks yelp)

Ever since im on a health diet (lets see how long this last), ive been in search of better and obviously healthier food.

When i came across this place, i was amazing of all the selection it has for natural and organic food. A very nice selection.

I decided to get [pesto chicken sandwich] and a side salad. And i must say, i feel in love. It was such a clean taste that it just amazed me. And the salad was great too. Most places drench salad with dressing but not here. Perfect amount ( then again i like super lite dressing- so for me, it was perfect). Still punch with flavor.

The service was good. I got it to-go.

Reason for -1 stars. I found the price to me on a heavier markup. But then again, youre paying for the natural and organic produce.

Nonetheless, ill be back. Just not so often.

Hands down, BEST &quot;kid&apos;s menu.&quot; EVER. I don&apos;t start my reviews with that category usually, if ever, but this place was so amazing at it, I had to. I mean, really. Really? Separate dishes with each ingredient for the kid&apos;s rice bowl? WOW. And PERFECT for so many kids! It got my discerning young son to sample each item - fresh broccoli, fresh pineapple, toasted sesame seeds and teriyaki sauce. Oh, they make that sauce :)

Ok, adults? You know how you just want &quot;healthy&quot; food to taste good? To have flavor? To be real and delicious and invoke happy memories - or at least a hint of salivation? Done! I had these excellent Thai- inspired, fresh spring rolls with chicken, the luscious rice boodles, these kick-butt pickled cucumbers, lettuce...well, go read the menu. The are lovely. Adult-daughter-girl had the tuna wrap and while delicious and familiar, it still had enough &quot;wow!&quot; to know that this was this particular place&apos;s recipe. Nice job on a standard!

Smoothies? Perfect. Smooth, lol, flavorful and as creative as you&apos;d like them to make them. As was my iced tea - it tasted so nice. I don&apos;t know what kind of tea it was, other than really delicious. It had an herbal &quot;flair&quot; to it, but seemed like black tea, mixed. Good stuff.

Service...a dream, really. It&apos;s a counter service place, but it had the feel of table service. A patient (and handsome as hell) register person, smiling, welcoming. The man that brought the food was very classy and really, it seemed like wait service in a &quot;nicer&quot; restaurant. So while you may order at the counter, they deliver your order to you, and they did it well.

I will be going back, there is no doubt about that. How a little place, on Santa Anita Avenue, can be homey and welcoming is amazing and impressive. And then to have the flavors and the service to match what it claims? This is a find. I liked it so much, I&apos;d want to work there :) That&apos;s the 3rd place I&apos;ve said that about in my reviews, so that says something!

And hey...Tapitio is on each table, so how bad that can be? ;)

I came here after a bike ride and I had a picky friend who wanted something &quot;super healthy.&quot; This is the first local place that came to mind because of its organic and vegan menu.

I got the Pesto Wrap. It&apos;s decent, but kind of bland. I guess that&apos;s what you get for ordering something &quot;super healthy.&quot;

This place is pricey too, but I guess you can also say that health doesn&apos;t come at a price.

Come if you want something healthy, you don&apos;t mind dropping an extra dollar or two, and you aren&apos;t looking for a super savory meal. Not a bad place to try, but I think it&apos;s a hit or miss.

This place is delicious! My friend and I wanted to try it out, since we are trying to be health conscious and eat less process or genetically modified foods. Their menu is vegan and vegetarian friendly, and they don&apos;t serve red meat. I have had their wraps, quesadillas, smoothies, burgers, and last time I went I had their breakfast torta. Everything is really good and very fresh.
The place itself is very clean and the staff is very nice. If you go there a lot (like I do) be sure to ask for the punch card and the rewards card. After 5 visits you get a free smoothie and then the rewards card gives you 5% off your purchase.

The downside is that it&apos;s pricey and portions are smaller. I spend an average of 12-15 dollars on a meal. When I order a side of fruit, I only get about 5 small cut pieces, which is disappointing. Parking is also limited in front of the store, so you have to park on the street.

This place is so freaking fantastic. I heart the food. I&apos;m only giving it 4 stars because it&apos;s never open when I go.

If you are or know who runs this rad joint, please let them know how lucrative business can be if they were open as long as the rock gym next door. So frequently does my tummy growl after/before a climbing session. It would be awesome to be able to take a break and grab some food nearby, I&apos;m sure the shared door to The Arc is there for that reason. So please, for all health conscious plastic pullers next door, stay open later!

If this doesn&apos;t convince you, I will have to bribe you with my last star rating. I promise to give it to you if you open till 9. Pretty please?

New favorite guilt-free lunch place hands down! (The 5th star will be forthcoming when the tables outside get repaired and no longer wobble:) )  Everything is fresh, organic and delicious.  I&apos;ve had breakfast burritos (served until noon), wraps and sandwiches, as well as some tasty fruit frappes!  Took a friend here for lunch and he said he felt soo good about what he&apos;d eaten he had to go out and party that nite just to &quot;dirty up&quot; a bit. LOL!

The name says it all &quot;natural selection&quot; - no genetically modified food here! Prepare yourself for some organic produce!

Came here FAMISHED after having to starve myself for a entire day for a doctor&apos;s appointment. I was truthfully craving a FAT juicy hamburger, but my guilty conscious led me to try this small local eatery for some healthy food :)

Me and my roomate ordered a Wrap + Salad Combo ($8.25) each:
---Chipotle Wrap---
Had a yummy chipotle kick! But even with the chipotle sauce, a bit bland! How sad! :( Something about cold chicken.. bleh
---Mediterranian Wrap---
I love mediterranian food - olives, feta cheese. Preferred this wrap, but again, a little bland!

Overall - I was NOT impressed. The food didn&apos;t taste any more fresh or flavorful. Portion size was small and service was slow. But the restaurant was very clean and the servers was polite and helpful.

Located in a small shopping plaza on Santa Anita (west side of the st) - you&apos;ll know you&apos;re there when you pull up to thier &quot;Organic Parking Only&quot; sign :)

Veggie patty in a Spring Roll, say what?

I&apos;ll be honest, I was seriously skeptical about how tasty a chopped up veggie patty wrapped together with rice noodles and mandarin oranges would taste, but the Natural Cafe managed  to pull it off!
My Sesame Spring Rolls came with a small side of fruit and sesame sauce for a little over 5 bucks. Not bad considering (most) of the ingredients are organic, and everything is (supposed) to be fresh.

Natural Selection is a laid back, clean little cafe that serves healthy, vegetarian-friendly options.
The menu&apos;s pretty extensive considering they&apos;re a small place--they serve breakfast, burgers, sandwiches, rice bowls, soup, salad, spring rolls, smoothies, and probably more.
I&apos;m all for supporting places like this. The fruits and veggies are grown locally and almost everything is made fresh, in house. The execution might not be perfect, but this place definitely has the right idea.

*Good service. They were friendly and my freshly-prepared rolls didn&apos;t take forever.
*Prices are average
*Eat-in or take-out

I don&apos;t see how anyone can give this a good review. The prices are high for the food category and the service is awful. Very unfriendly staff and I ended up paying almost $9 for a burrito. Why pay nine dollars when i can get a much larger (and tastier) one down the street that has pleasant service and &quot;thanks&quot; you for visiting. And if you want a juice, hello, Robeks. Much better and you get a lot more for your money.

We tried to keep the prices affordable but unfortunately the prices for ORGANIC products range from 30% to 50% higher than conventional. Most of us would agree that couple of dollars more for our lunch is something small we could do to help the environment and our long term health. I hope you could give us a try again and ask to see me! I&apos;ll make sure you get the service and the meal you deserve.

You&apos;d think that food that tastes this delicious is bound to leave you feeling guilty afterwards.. But, I always leave Natural Selection feeling great! They&apos;re a healthier alternative to the highly processed foods that are exposed to us from most other restaurants and supporting local businesses makes the food sit even more snuggly in my stomach. I come here about every other day :)

My friend brought me here since he&apos;s very conscious of what he eats and I have to say it was delicious!

Their breakfast burrito with the salsa is very filling even though at first glance it isn&apos;t very large but it is packed ! The salsa on the side is very fresh and I ended up asking for a 2nd cup of it since I went through the first one like nothing.

I&apos;d definitely come back here again if I wanted something healthy yet filling!

My initial impression of this restaurant was that it was merely following the organic, artificial-free craze that has become so popular these days; substituting flavor for a fad. However, the food proved not only organic, but delicious. With its extensive menu that includes wraps, sandwiches, burgers and bowls, the only problem you&apos;ll have will be selecting which one to get. I ordered the Mexican Rice Bowl. It had organic brown rice, organic black beans, pico de gallo, your choice of meat from grilled chicken breast, soy meat or veggie chorizo and topped with homemade chipotle sauce. I went with the grilled chicken. It was juicy and tender and not dry at all. The rice, beans and pico gallo was fresh creating a cohesive blend of tastes and textures. Although I would love to eat organic all the time simply because it tastes ten times better than the artificial, processed foods of fast food joints and chain restaurants, I simply can&apos;t afford to eat organic everyday. Thanks to Natural Selection I can get delicious, healthy, and above all affordable organic food made by a staff who are more than happy to offer recommendations and accommodate requests. Next time you find yourself craving something healthy and delicious try Natural Selection.

can&apos;t wait to try more of the menu.

Tried the honey mustard sandwich and it was delicious and filling(only ate half of it and I can&apos;t wait to eat the rest).  could have used just a little more sauce and cheese but overall was very satisfied.  Plus anywhere that has a cranberry smoothie instantly gets me excited.

Friend tried the Mediterranean wrap and with the first bite of it said yum.

The price is very reasonable for what you are getting, took the food to go
but nice inside area and outside patio, service is a decent wait.

What would make this place even better?  I hope one day they include some organic fresh baked dessert treats.

I found this restaurant on Yelp.  I have a friend who lives in the area, so I searched for somewhere healthy to eat.  There are so choices...sandwiches, wraps, rice bowls, burgers, mexican food, soup, etc.  I had the mediterranean wrap with a side salad and my friend had the pesto wrap a la carte.  I thought it was really good, and definitely seemed healthy.  (You can make modifications to make it even healthier.) The guy who took our order was really friendly and gave us suggestions.  I&quot;ll definitely come back, because the portobello burger is calling my name! :)

I went again (4th time) because this is my go-to place for organic mexican food. :9

Decor: It&apos;s very spacious, and it&apos;s at a corner location (with outside seating), so the sunlight comes in generously. Sometimes, it feels very empty because most of their clients get take-out like me. There is very minimal decor- one tv, a few bulletin boards on the side wall, but it feels clean, which is always appreciated.

Service: The service is average- 3/5, meaning they get the job done but with not much friendliness. If you get a chance though, pick up their business card because it doubles as a punch card- after 5 punches (each punch = a visit with a purchase of over $10), you can get a free 16oz. smoothie (&apos;smothie&apos; as they spell it) or shake.

Food: I ordered 2 items- the breakfast chorizo burrito&amp;the vegetarian enchilada. I&apos;ve ordered the regular chorizo burrito before and I was really satisfied (I asked for more rice&amp;no beans), but this time I forgot to make the exchange. It was still good though because the only difference was the breakfast one had a fried egg added. Yum! I would rate the regular burrito 5/5, but the vegetarian enchilada was not as good as I imagined- it&apos;d maybe get a 3.5/5, the +0.5 only because it has organic ingredients. Like other reviewers, I agree prices are steep, but I&apos;m always comforted knowing that when I choose to eat out, I&apos;m making a healthier choice with Natural Selection&apos;s organic food.

Overall: I&apos;d say a 4/5 for me because I do get what I order. It&apos;s the only place I know that serves organic mexican food (though they do have other things, that&apos;s the only stuff I order), and I do crave it once in a while so that&apos;s a good sign. Plus, it&apos;s always nice to support a local business- there aren&apos;t many other healthy eats options in Arcadia.

I guess this place is banking on the fact that they serve organic, but the price is steep and food not delicious or special enough for me to come back for more.

I had their wraps&amp;smoothies on a separate occasion and they were unmemorable. My sister convinced me to come back for a second time, so we split their turkey burger and omelet. The burger buns are straight out of the bag (I wish they could have at least toasted or warmed them) and the veggies on top were very fresh, but stingy. There was literally 1 slice of perfectly cut lettuce, 1 slice of tomato, and few strings of onions. The turkey patty could use some seasoning. The omelet was better, because the serving is huge with generous servings of spinach and turkey. However, I could easily make the same thing at home.

Unfortunately, standard, unmemorable fare is not enough for me to keep coming back, even if it is organic. I&apos;m a little disappointed because I want to believe there are tasty organic meals out there that leaves me wanting more, but I guess I have to look elsewhere.

The staff was very friendly and it&apos;s conveniently located next to the ARC and REI for the active crowd.

I was disappointed by their menu.  Although large and with plenty of vegetarian options, there were no vegan options.  A place whose tagline is &quot;be healthy, live well, eat natural&quot; should be a little more conscious about providing vegan foods.

Although sometimes getting vegan food can be as easy as removing the cheese, I just didn&apos;t order food since I wasn&apos;t sure if the buns, veggie patties, or protein powders were vegan.

I found it odd that they served smoothies&amp;shakes with the option of soy or cow milk since they served frozen yogurt as the base for all their shakes.

An organic (maybe?) sandwich cafe that&apos;s so easy to miss..unless well (A) you&apos;re a fit fanatic...and u regularly climb at the ARC, (B) U work at one of these shady looking warehouses (C) ur an intuitive equal opportunity yelper that spots every food joint while driving..(btw, not a very safe driving habit tsk..tsk..tsk..)

They have quite a selection of healthy conscious wraps, sandwiches and burgers...which I have to say..was suprisingly tasty...I completely forgot I was was eating healthy for 5 minutes there...The shakes were a bit chalky and heavy..it possibly had more calories than the burger I was eating...

That&apos;s okay...I left guilt free..

which is always...a good thing..

The reason why I love this place is because it&apos;s one of the few restaurants where you can order whatever you want on the menu, and it is delicious and more importantly, HEALTHY!

I&apos;ve had a number of different dishes here, but there is still so much I want to try (breakfast). Sometimes I look at their website, and I see the Egg Torta or whatever is pictured on their breakfast page, and my mouth waters.. I want to try breakfast so bad, but I can never make it.

Their vegetable soup (served on Mondays) is DELICIOUS.. fresh, healthy ingredients, and with a lot of basil (yummy). Just yesterday I had their veggie quesadilla (grilled spinach, bellpepper, and onion). It was a bit heavy because of all the cheese in it, but it was delicious, and I ate the whole thing (I should have stopped, but it was too good). I&apos;ve also had their pesto chicken sandwich, that was good, but not extraordinary (although, I would order it again). I haven&apos;t had the Veggie Enchiladas yet, but I heard it is AMAZING. :) I will try it someday but I&apos;m currently on a strict diet (so.. I kinda cheated with the quesadilla, but I&apos;m totally back on track today).

This place does get pretty busy during lunch time, so I do suggest phoning in and ordering early or to-go. To people complaining about the wait: Delicious, real, healthy, fresh food does NOT come out quickly! If you want fast service, go to your nearest fast food joint. Think about it.

The one thing I don&apos;t like about this place is the hours. I wish they would be open for more hours during the day, especially Saturday! They close at 5. I know it must be expensive to keep this place open, and maybe they get most of their business during the weekdays, but.. I would love to eat dinner here on Sat night.

This place is great!  I am a regular member at the climbing gym next door and I tried this place for the first time today.  I got the spinach salad with chicken and it was delicious.  Every ingredient fit very well with the dressing.  My friend got the Mediterranean wrap and she ate every bite.

I would have to say that this place is FAR from being a fast food restaurant.  The owner/manager is very knowledgeable of nutrition and the service is probably better than most &quot;nice/expensive&quot; restaurants.

Would definitely recommend and I will be going back soon :)

I I have been coming here for about a year.  Their food is always super-fresh and scrumptious, not to mention healthy!!!  The service is always superb.  The staff aims to please.   I recommend trying a wrap, or if you are there when they serve breakfast the Breakfast Chorizo Burrito.  It is to die for (not to mention great for a hangover)

I am in SoCal for the summer, and I enjoy healthy, refreshing, and delicious cuisine that I easily find in the SF bay area, so I was really happy to have stumbled upon this establishment!

I was coming from the climbing gym next door, so it seems like a perfect match.  It just opened.

We had the thai spring rolls, a wrap, and the anti-oxidant shake.  All were really refreshing and flavorful.  I can&apos;t wait to go again!

It is a bit on the pricer side of quick bites, but totally worth the quality.

The food hear is very good and when i leave, i never have the feeling that i over ate, even if i ate  a lot. I do think it&apos;s kinda pricey, but it&apos;s organic, so it&apos;s understandable. People are really nice there too..also before you order anything that has avocado, make sure they have it! I got my meal, then they told me they didn&apos;t have avocado after -_-

Minus two stars for the terrible service!

We walked in and were the only two people in the restaurant, as many other Yelpers have been. A woman peeked her head out from behind the counter. When I said hello to her, she just stared and rolled her eyes. The other person in my party also said hello to her and she just scoffed. Bitch! We are the only customers in here! Excuse the fuck out of me for patronizing your business!

We were about to leave, but I really wanted to try the food. The chicken enchiladas and the enlarged photos of their positive magazine reviews were calling me.

I tried the chicken enchiladas (served with mexican rice and black beans) with the nut shake. The other person with me had the pesto wrap, fruit and iced tea. It was only $24 for everything and it was a decent portion of food. Just a note, the iced tea is jasmine tea, which we weren&apos;t fans of.

My enchiladas rocked! Stuffed full of chicken and the sauce was good and spicy. I don&apos;t know how they seasoned the black beans, but they were fantastic! My nutty shake was incredible. I will absolutely order it again.

The pesto wrap looked good. The fruit? Not so much. It was two strawberries sliced up, two tiny cubes of watermelon and maybe a quarter of an orange. I would suggest a different side.

For a relatively new place, I was surprised to see the decor in such poor shape. There were lots of cobwebs and dust balls. The chairs have rubbed a lot of paint off of the walls, which looked pretty tacky. The whole place has a cold, office/doctor&apos;s waiting room feel to it. They even have a rack of old magazines for you to flip through while you wait!

In all, I would recommend Natural Selection for a quick, to-go meal. Maybe take it to the park or to your home so you can minimize contact with the bitch at the counter. I wish they would be friendlier. Until they learn some hospitality, I don&apos;t think I can support them.

This place is ok.  The lady wasn&apos;t very pleasant for service.
Food is kinda expensive.
The greens weren&apos;t that fresh either (some were wilted)
Besides that it was pretty good.
Pesto chicken sandwich is much greater than Hawaiian turkey burger.
