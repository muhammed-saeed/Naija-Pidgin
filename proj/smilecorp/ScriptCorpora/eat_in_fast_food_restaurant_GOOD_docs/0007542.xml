Angry Issues: Should Businesses Have To Accommodate Obese Patrons?
 
 
 


Welcome to another installment of Angry Issues , where I open up a debate regarding a contentious health and fitness issue ripped from the headlines.

Last time around I asked what Gym Behavior Drives You Crazy , and many of you shared your dissatisfaction with gym hoarders, smelly trainees, and people who spend more time talking, either on their cell, or with a friend, than working out.

Today’s topic is a much more serious issue. If you’ve followed the news in the past year, you’ve probably heard of airlines proposing to charge more money per ticket to those customers who are above ‘normal size’. In fact in one recent incident, an overweight woman was denied access to her return flight because the plane was full, and due to her size she’d be infringing on other customer’s personal space. And we all know what happened with film director Kevin Smith a couple of years ago…

But it’s not just airlines under pressure. Just the other day, I read on the USA Today website that a 290 pound man is suing White Castle because he can’t fit into the booths at the popular chain. This guy actually filed a federal lawsuit, claiming the small seating violates his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Martin Kessan had been eating at White Castle since 1959, but now refuses to eat there because he’s banged his knee trying to squeeze into the table seating, and the fact that he can’t fit is “extremely embarrassing” for him.

 

You’ve got to be kidding me! This has to be one of the most absurd things I’ve heard in a while. First of all, Kessman is claiming his overweight stature is a disability . And while I may agree that being obese limits a person’s activity level, he’s hardly disabled. I think that’s a huge insult to the true special needs of individuals that are legitimately prevented from using traditional seating. Just ridiculous.

Here’s an idea Mr. Kessman – how about you eat a little less food and become a bit more active and healthy instead of filing a lawsuit? Then maybe you would lose a few pounds and fit in the booths, as I’m sure you did back in 1959! But no, of course not. Kessman says in his lawsuit that while he won’t go back to White Castle until they provide seating he can fit in, he still sends his wife to pick up his burgers! Seriously! This has to be one of the most incredible examples of a person dodging responsibility that I’ve ever seen.

There is a movement underway at the moment towards promoting people who are overweight, or obese, as the new “normal” size in America. One look in clothing stores at the sizes being offered and you can see just how “BIG” America has become. Did you know the original Yankee Stadium had nearly 30,000 MORE seats? Our behinds have grown by nearly 9 inches since the early 1920’s, and hence, less people fit in our stadiums. That’s also means you pay more per ticket. Think about that next time you complain how much gaming tickets cost.

 

So should companies be FORCED to provide plus size seating for obese individuals? Personally I don’t think so. But that said I’m certainly not obese or above average sized, but even with my 5’10, 210 pound body, I’ve been cramped in restaurant booths a few times. And doesn’t this type of lawsuit also give basketball players the right to sue? After all they don’t fit comfortably in fast food seating areas, or on planes, or in many cars for that matter. Many people are larger than normal, not just the obese.

How about airplane tickets? Should obese people pay more, or be required to pay for two seats? That’s a hard issue to touch. On one hand, I would be upset if an obese person interfered with my personal space during a flight. On the other hand, I can tell you on a recent return trip from LA, I sat in the middle of two large men that weren’t obese by any means. And guess what? The three of us were in each other’s way the whole trip. So should each of us have paid more? Should bodybuilders? Where do we draw the line?

Many people want to point fingers at overweight people because there is a negative stigma attached to being heavy. And that’s wrong. So while I don’t think establishments should have to provide larger than normal seating arrangements, it wouldn’t hurt to make everybody happy with alternate seating every body could use. And as much as the consumer in me wants to say we should charge larger people more money for occupying more space, the human being in me says that’s not right either.

But to sue a restaurant because you’re out of shape, have overeaten, and can’t fit in their chairs is just insane!

It’s a complicated issue–so what do you think? Should businesses be forced to offer plus size seating for larger people? Should people pay more if they’re bigger? Comment away…

It’s a very sad statement on our society that while we’re at record poverty levels and massively in debt, so many of our citizens are classified as obese, prompting a new‘normal’when it comes to weight. Our values really are screwed up…

What’s sad is anytime someone feels discriminated against they sue. Lady sued mcdonlads cause she spilt coffee and the coffee was hot, people sued fast food cause it makes them fat. Guy sues cause he can’t sit in a booth. When did we stop taking personal responsibility for our actions. I’m currently overweight, but I’m doing something about it.Being fat isn’t a disability its a choice. No as far as catering to obese people that is what a buisness has to do in order to keep making money. that does mean they can charge more as the space is getting smaller the bigger we get.

There’s little I can say that hasn’t been said already, it boils down to personal responsibility. In addition, it’s impossible to conform what was intended for the majority to the few in these kinds of situations, nor should they have to. For every large person that sues, there will be an even larger one who thinks the seat for the previous large person is too small. The line gets drawn somewhere.

Except on plane flights where they’re trying to fit as many people as possible, yeah, even Webster probably thinks those seats are cramped.

I’m very short—not even five feet tall. Maybe I should sue places that don’t provide me with seats that allow my feet to touch the ground. (Or provide me with footrests!) Because, you know, that contributes to lower back pain. And stuff. Yeah! America, land of the lawsuit!

People sue because they can, and apparently they win! (if not what’s the point of suing) So I think the judges and the laws are setting a completely wrong example to the masses. It’s crazy to eat your self half to death and be awarded a fortune by the judges!!! How is it possible that in America people get away with this? I think the lawmakers should stop awarding this behavior and tell them to take responsibility. If I were to step of the roof of my house and break my legs…. do I sue the builders for putting it there? Thas insane, but that’s what’s happening in the states.
Stop rewarding bad or ignorant behavior and start educating.

Alfonso,

Did you see the article about the ketchup packets that were redesigned in order for people to eat while driving? It was on Yahoo today. Absolutely atrocious what this world is doing in order to cater to people and allow them to be unhealthy. Instead of promoting healthy lifestyles companies are more than willing to bend to cater to the obese.

Yes Greg, I did see it. More states have hands free cell phone laws, but plenty of people eat in their cars. Now they have to open ketchup packets while driving? I tell you, we are our own worst enemies.

We definitely are. I ride a motorcycle as my primary means of transportation and it has truly opened my eyes to people’s driving habits. I would say 4 out of 5 people I see on the road are either eating or talking on the cell phone. I have even seen someone driving down the road eating by holding a fork in one hand and a takeout tray in the other. Has our lives become this complicated that we can’t sit down at a table to eat anymore?

I feel that it is the individual’s lack of responsibility that has made society what it is today. Maybe there is more to the story of why some people sue others. Everyone needs to be responsible for their own actions&amp;stop blaming everything that goes wrong in their lives on others. We have become an EXTREMELY spoiled country&amp;we expect other people (like the government) to take care of it’s‘kids’(We The People) we are acting like children, throwing tantrums (“i’m fat, i’m suing this fast food restaurant) and crying to whomever will listen that we have been cheated because we made a choice. We have free agency. And we have abused it. So now we don’t want the cosequence because‘we didn’t do it.’I don’t think bigger people should be charged more. I think America needs to grow up!

Fat chick AND lawyer here. So sorry to be“weighing in”late on this post, but I really wanted to pipe up.

First off, the question doesn’t seem to really be about this guy’s lawsuit, which Stevie Wonder can see is a load of bull. The McDonald’s Coffee woman was actually seriously burned, with 3rd degree burns over her genitals. She needed extensive reconstructive surgery. The restaurant had been repeatedly warned that their coffee was way too hot. Ther is a good documentary about it on Netflix. But this guy’s case isn’t anything like that situation. Legally, in as much as obesity can constitute a disability, public places much make accommodations in order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. What this guy would have to show is that his 290 pounds is a“disability”and I doubt that he could show that. A person may be disabled if he or she has a physical or mental condition that substantially limits a major life activity (such as walking, talking, seeing, hearing, or learning). Not my area of law, not my expertise, just my hunch, this guy isn’t disabled. In any event, he’s a bit of a jerk. Can’t he just eat in his car in shame, like the rest of us do when we sneak our secret fast-food indulgences? 

But I want to address what you said about whether businesses should have to accommodate bigger people. First, I really like what you have said here, Alfonso:
“So while I don’t think establishments should have to provide larger than normal seating arrangements, it wouldn’t hurt to make everybody happy with alternate seating every body could use. And as much as the consumer in me wants to say we should charge larger people more money for occupying more space, the human being in me says that’s not right either.”
That’s a nice way to put an emotionally charged situation. Options for people of all body sizes would be wonderful. One of my coworkers is not even 5 feet tall, and hanging out with her has literally helped me see the world from a different perspective–one about 10″shorter than mine! I’m sure she’d be an advocate of having step-stools in stores with high shelves, because she can’t reach a lot of things.

One of the things that prompted me to get serious about losing weight (50 pounds and counting since January 19) was that I couldn’t comfortably sit in a barstool. That was actually helpful to me, even though it was embarrassing. But the thing is, it wasn’t the first time my size had made me embarrassed or worried about fitting somewhere. I have been large enough to wonder if I will be able to buckle a seatbelt on an airplane for several years, for instance. For a while there, I needed an extender. I didn’t always get one. So why wasn’t that enough to make me lose weight?

Because there is a huge emotional component to being morbidly obese. It is, I contend, very different than being“just fat.”Yep, when you have been in the place in your life where you can say you have over 100 pounds to lose, you get to make a determination that your fat experience is quantitatively different than other folks fat experience–because it is. Being morbidly obese is a self-fulfilling prophecy: I have always gotten fatter, so I always will. I never stay on a diet plan successfully, I always gain weight after. I will just ignore what I put in my mouth then–never diet, never get fat!

Until you are at the point where you are willing to look at the things that you have been telling yourself that got you where you are, no amount of public embarrassment/shaming will change your behavior. It takes a mental recognition that there are inconsistencies in your thoughts, the emotional readiness and support system to make a change, and the help of a team of professionals/folks who know more than you do, to make a major life change and leave morbid obesity behind. If you have a lot of weight to lose, you need to see your doctor, a nutritionist, and learn enough so that you don’t hurt yourself in the process.

So I don’t think that by *not* accommodating bigger people, we are going to spur them into taking responsibility for their size. Like I tried to say, it’s just not that simple. Some of the things that make a business able to accommodate disabled people, like having chairs at a table rather than booths, can help people of different sizes fit comfortably pretty easily. At a restaurant, you could have a stack of larger chairs over where you stack the kiddie seats, it wouldn’t necessarily be that hard. On an airplane? That ain’t gonna fly.

Dogfood Provider, I like your comment. And thank you for clarifying the issue around the woman who sued McDonald’s because of their hot coffee. I was just about to mention that. The documentary is called Hot Coffee if anyone is interested. I was believer in the frivolousness of law suits and always ridiculed this lady until I sat down and watched Hot Coffee. Highly recommend it.
In my opinion, businesses will have to accommodate bigger people. It’s not a question of should they, rights, disabilities or how a person became obese in the first place. It’s a question of money and turning a profit. People are getting bigger. Obviously the situation isn’t going away, it’s getting worse. Businesses survive by catering to their clients so if they want them to keep coming back they will have to make space for them.

Kudos to Dogfood Provider for committing to losing the weight.

Here’s a fact, and I study this stuff as a student pilot. Weight and balance affect aircraft performance. Period. Now a commercial size intercontinental jet won’t be affected the same way as a regional carrier (bigger = more stable), but there are times that people may be asked to move in order to balance the load; either left-right or front-rear. The pilots do this for safety, not to insult you. Flying is a tricky business, and a pilot has every right to do what is necessary for the comfort and safety of the passengers and crew.

I also had the probably not unique, but definitely unpleasant experience of flying from Shanghai to Los Angelos sitting next to a 300 pound stunt double for Charlie Chan (not to be confused with Jackie Chan). This gelatinous blob flowed into my seat and treated me to the sweat massage of a lifetime. I’ve been in combat and was not ever as disgusted as I was on this 12 hour flight forcibly seated next to Sweaty the Hut.

All I have to say is, if you’re so obese that you take up two seats on an airplane, don’t complain if you get moved around, and don’t complain if you get charged for every seat you occupy.

I get so fired up over this crap I can’t respond intelligently! I think I am going to sue my work place for not providing gluten free healthy food in the cafeteria!

I read about this and I remember how pissed off I was about it. I’m still an overweight guy, but I used to be huge and not fit in booths either. I was a 4xl 440pound guy.

I avoided going to those places, but I still knew that my size and the embarrassment I felt was my own damn fault. The fact is I got tired of feeling that way and chose to get healthy. Now that I’ve lost a bunch of weight and feel‘normal’–i explain to people that being obese is a choice. Being fit is a choice–simply make a choice and learn to live with it.

This guy is simply ridiculous. Why is it he cant get his ass up and I can? I have a kid, I have a career and even at my job I sit all day (web design/dev). Yet somehow even when I was extremely obese I managed to drop some weight. The whole topic makes me wanna slap people like him

I’m sorry to let people know, but some people have to take steroids for certain diseases and the steroids can cause extreme obesity. I know this because a female friend of mine was a beautiful fit woman, and sadly has a degenerative disease that will eventually kill her. They have informed her that by taking steroids she could live a fairly normal life, and live to be 65 to 70 if she gets lucky, but would gain a lot of weight.

With in two and a half years she gained close to 180lbs, and can barely walk now. She was extremely depressed at the wait gain, and tried vigorously to exercise it away, but no amount of exercise or dieting will remove this weight because the steroids have altered her metabolism. She can not sit in many restaurants now because the tables and chairs are to small for her MEDICALLY CAUSED CONDITION.

So though it is true that there are many people who are overweight because they don’t take care of them selves, there are others that are overweight because they are on medications that cause the obesity. For those kind of people this is a 100% valid law suit.
