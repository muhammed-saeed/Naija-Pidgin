 Do a good job and show an interest in being a manager. Talk to the owner, branch manager, or whomever makes decisions like that. Tell that person you want to be a manager. At the very least, it will show that you are dedicated to the store and you will get advice on what you can do to become a manager from the person who knows. Best outcome you will become a manager

 Worked at fast food restaurant and saw someone who had only worked there for a couple months become a manager just by asking.

 I think a manager should know how to spell the name correctly. It&apos;s McDonald&apos;s.

Other than that, knowing how to perform ALL the duties as you do should have you in line for promotion soon. Work on being able to instruct others in those duties, and leading a team well with good communication skills.
