What foods should I eat to lose weight?
 By fatburn.com 
 
This might be the most commonly asked question we get. Its also one of the most frustrating. The reason it can be so frustrating is because you already know what to eat in order to achieve better health or your weight loss goals. Allow us to pose a few simple questions. Which is better, fried chicken breast or baked, skinless chicken breast? We really dont have to tell you that the baked, skinless chicken breast is the answer. Does adding butter or oil to your foods increase or decrease the fat and caloric count? For desert, should you choose the apple pie or the fresh fruit? Are whole eggs or egg whites better for you? Should french fries be a part of you every day diet? How about pizza? Should you eat fresh vegetables? The answers to these questions are simple. Try not to be blind to the fact that you already know the basics for a good diet.
Occasionally we think a food is good for us and it isnt. The following are nine foods that may surprise you.
 Most breakfast cereals
 Frozen potato products
 Deli meats that are processed
 Salad dressing
 Dried fruit
 Granola
 Bagels
 Bran muffins
 Non-fat potato chips

But, there are many people who are practicing good eating habits and are still struggling with their weight. This is where we all could use a little education. From childhood most of us were told to clean our plates. This comes from generations ago when, during the depression, it was almost a crime to waste. But, today there is an abundance of food and we are taking full advantage. When you buy a sub sandwich, for .50 cents you can get the 12 instead of the 6! At every fast food restaurant, for a small price, you can &quot;Super Size&quot; your side order. At your local Italian restaurant, the bowl of pasta is probably big enough to feed a village.
Portion control, portion control, portion control. Throw away all you have been reading in the latest and greatest &quot;diet breakthrough&quot; literature. The key to your weight loss goal is eating what you like, in a balanced diet, while controlling the portion size. We are making better food choices. The proof is in these facts. A recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that adults increased their caloric intake from 1,969 calories in 1978 to 2,200 in 1990. Simultaneously, a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed that fat consumption dropped from 40 percent of calories in 1978 to 33 percent in 1995.
You already know when youre eating food that is good for you and when youre not. But do you know when to stop? It&apos;s easy to eat 200-300 more calories a day than you really need, and that translates into gradual weight gain. Figure out how much you need to eat to feel satisfied, not full. Listen to your body. It will always give you good feedback.
If you want to know the exact amount of calories you can eat to lose weight, register to use the fatburn.com website. Here you will find a calorie counter, which will give you a caloric count for the food you ate today. It will also give you a caloric burn for the calories you expended today. Finally it will give you a summary so you can see, daily, if you are choosing the right amounts of food and show you exactly why you are losing or gaining weight.
