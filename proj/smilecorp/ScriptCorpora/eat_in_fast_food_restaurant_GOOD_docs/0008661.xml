 AMERICAJR.com SAVINGS TIPS 121. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Every 
 paycheck, you plan to save, but it seems like there&apos;s 
 nothing left over after bills and creditors get their 
 share. It&apos;s getting tougher to pay the bills on time, 
 let alone save any money! Now that you know how much 
 money you make and spend, it&apos;s time to cast a critical 
 eye on expenses. Let&apos;s find out where you can trim 
 the fat from your budget. Keep charity receipts: Any 
 kind of donations that you make throughout the year 
 can be used as a tax write off. Keep less money available: 
 Leave your credit cards at home and take only the 
 cash you&apos;ll need. If you run short, put something 
 back. (Posted: 1/5/11) 120. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Staying out of debt is a big part of building a savings. 
 Here are a few more of the little things you can do. 
 Consider these extra tricks when trying to save a 
 few bucks. Take your lunch to work: Instead of paying 
 five or six dollars for a&quot;value&quot;meal at 
 lunch every day, bring a sandwich, apple and drink 
 from home. Go to beauty school: Time for a manicure, 
 pedicure or haircut? Go to a training salon and get 
 professional work done at a fraction of the cost. 
 Quit smoking: It&apos;s much easier said than done, but 
 smokers, you&apos;re burning up a gold mine. Smoking a 
 pack a day costs about $1,460 a year. (Posted: 12/29/10) 119. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Utilize 
 rewards: Rewards programs are everywhere these days. 
 If you have the discipline to pay off your balance 
 each month, use your card to pay all of your bills 
 and rack up lots of points. Just be sure to use the 
 card responsibly. The rewards won&apos;t even cover the 
 interest that you&apos;ll pay if you carry a balance. Say 
 no to the free shirt: Just about everywhere you go, 
 there&apos;s somebody trying to get you to sign up for 
 their credit card. A free shirt, free hat, or a ten 
 percent discount may be appealing, but these little 
 freebies can hurt you in the long run. Even if you 
 never use the card, the application alone can bring 
 down your credit rating. Pay on time: Late payments 
 are messy. They incur fees and allow the credit card 
 company to raise your interest rates. Make a note 
 on your calendar and pay ahead of time. (Posted: 12/22/10) 118. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Pay off the credit card balance: As soon as you get 
 your statement, pay off the balance. Minimum payments 
 don&apos;t cover much more than the interest charge. Look 
 for hidden fees: Look closely at your statement and 
 take note of what kind of fees you are paying out. 
 Programs like credit life insurance, credit disability 
 insurance, involuntary unemployment credit insurance 
 and credit property insurance are generally unnecessary. 
 Make sure you don&apos;t have to pay for them. Get a low 
 interest rate: Zero percent interest doesn&apos;t last 
 forever. Many credit cards offer this as an introductory 
 rate, but before you jump at this opportunity, find 
 out how long it lasts and what your rate will be when 
 it expires. Watch your statement: On top of hidden 
 fees, you may also find double or fraudulent charges 
 that you will need to dispute. (Posted: 12/15/10) 117. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Saving 
 money on entertainment is great, but be careful how 
 you take care of the bill. Plastic can be hazardous 
 to your bank account&apos;s health. Credit cards are not 
 free money. They can become a black hole for your 
 finances in the blink of an eye. Use them responsibly. 
 Remember: at some point, you&apos;ll have to pay them back. 
 You only need one: You can get into enough trouble 
 with one credit card; don&apos;t compound the risk by getting 
 more. Cut up the rest: Once you&apos;ve chosen your card 
 to keep, destroy the others. Be sure to also cancel 
 the associated account. In case of emergency: Consider 
 your credit card a safety net. Don&apos;t use it for anything 
 that you don&apos;t absolutely need. (Posted: 12/8/10) 116. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Watch for free events: Check the newspaper and Internet 
 for open houses, festivals, library events and other 
 community gatherings in your area.
Members only: Museums and zoos often have deals and 
 special events for members. Sign up to support the 
 arts, furry friends and your savings. Explore the 
 great outdoors: Pack a picnic and go for a hike at 
 a park or recreational area nearby. You can even pack 
 a tent and sleeping bag to stay for the weekend. Go 
 for a swim: Enjoy some good clean fun in the sun: 
 head to the lake or beach. Listen for free tickets: 
 Newspapers and radio stations often hold contests 
 to give away free movie and concert tickets. (Posted: 
 12/1/10) 115. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Don&apos;t 
 buy popcorn: Tickets are expensive enough. Don&apos;t pay 
 for an overpriced popcorn and Coke, too. Eat something 
 before you go and drink water if you get thirsty. 
 Rent a movie: Bypass the high ticket prices and expensive 
 snacks altogether. Head over to the video store and 
 rent a movie. Support your Alma mater: High school 
 and college sporting events can provide cheap entertainment. 
 Watch tomorrow&apos;s stars today: Many large cities host 
 minor league games that cost a fraction of the big 
 league price. Check out the local art scene: Poetry 
 readings, art openings, high school plays, and community 
 theater programs can be fun and inexpensive. (Posted: 
 11/24/10) 114. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Cut down on subscriptions: Pick one or two magazines 
 that you enjoy the most and cancel the rest. Share 
 with friends: Go through old books or movies that 
 you have lying around and propose a trade with one 
 of your friends for something that you haven&apos;t read 
 or seen yet. Have a game night: Instead of going out, 
 invite friends and family over for board games. Host 
 a potluck: Invite people over for dinner and have 
 each person bring a separate dish. It&apos;s fun and much 
 cheaper than going out. Catch a matinee: Movies at 
 2PM are the same as 7PM. Beat the crowd and save money 
 by catching the early show. Go to a discount theater: 
 Lots of cities have theaters that show movies after 
 their initial release. Check out movies on the big 
 screen at big savings. (Posted: 11/17/10) 113. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Avoid 
 fashion trends: Don&apos;t spend a ton of money on an item 
 that you won&apos;t want to wear next month. Stick with 
 classic styles that you&apos;ll wear often. Once you&apos;ve 
 got your necessities down, you can focus on how to 
 save money on the fun stuff. Everybody Have Fun Tonight: 
 Entertaining yourself doesn&apos;t have to mean spending 
 a lot of money. It doesn&apos;t even have to include going 
 out. Get cheap novels: Instead of filling your bookshelves 
 with brand new books, consider buying used. There 
 are chain stores that offer used books at half and 
 even a quarter of the cover price. Libraries often 
 have great sales as well. Better yet, borrow books, 
 movies and CDs for free at the library. Once there, 
 you can also surf the internet as well as read magazines 
 and newspapers. (Posted: 11/10/10) 112. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Look for sales: You can often find everything you 
 need on the sale rack. Wait for end of season sales: 
 Pick up next year&apos;s bathing suit for a fraction of 
 the cost at the end of the summer. Shop online: The 
 Internet offers many items used or at a discount. 
 Try to find sites that offer free shipping. Shop at 
 closeout stores: They may not be pretty, but you can 
 find great deals at stores like Big Lots, Marshalls 
 and TJ Maxx. Head to the second-hand store: Goodwill, 
 thrift stores and pawn shops offer many quality used 
 goods at low prices. Find a garage sale: One man&apos;s 
 junk is another&apos;s treasure. Consider alternatives: 
 Expensive does not always equal quality. Check out 
 professional ratings from Consumer Reports and read 
 what customers say online to find out if you&apos;re getting 
 biggest bang for your buck. (Posted: 11/3/10) 111. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Bring 
 leftovers home: Restaurant portions are huge, generally 
 twice the size of a recommended serving. Ask for a 
 doggy bag and bring the leftovers home. Now that you&apos;re 
 operating on a full stomach, it&apos;s time to take a look 
 at what you&apos;re wearing and how you decorate your home. 
 Don&apos;t Lose Your Shirt: The sheer volume of sales flyers, 
 coupons and advertising that we are inundated with 
 is enough to make your head spin. Cut through the 
 clutter: focus on what you&apos;re looking for and compare 
 prices for the best deal. Distinguish between needs 
 and wants: Before you start buying toys and specialty 
 items, decide what you need more: the product or the 
 money. (Posted: 10/27/10) 110. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Limit yourself: Avoid making restaurant visits an 
 everyday event. Treat yourself once a week or once 
 a month. Look for new restaurants: Lots of new restaurants 
 offer discounts and specials to attract customers. 
 Go out for lunch instead of dinner: Most restaurants 
 are cheaper at lunchtime. When you decide to treat 
 yourself, go out to lunch and stay in for dinner. 
 Avoid weekends: Everybody goes out to eat on the weekends. 
 Restaurants may limit specials and coupons during 
 this time. For the best deals, visit during the week. 
 Drink water: Save a few dollars on your bill by drinking 
 water instead of soda or alcohol. (Posted: 10/20/10) 109. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Check 
 your receipt: Before you leave the store, take a glance 
 at your receipt to make sure everything checks out. 
 Items may ring up at an incorrect price or be scanned 
 too many times. Grow your own food: Plant some herbs 
 and vegetables in a small garden out back. You may 
 not be able to replicate the produce aisle, but it 
 can help cut your grocery bill. Trimming your grocery 
 bill will work wonders when it comes to stocking up 
 your pantry, but even a house full of food won&apos;t satisfy 
 a craving for your favorite restaurant. Eating macaroni 
 and cheese, salad and Hamburger Helper every night 
 can get old fast. Treat yourself to a meal at a restaurant 
 from time to time, just be sure to keep it within 
 reason. (Posted: 10/13/10) 108. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Go generic: Just about every product has a generic 
 counterpart at a much lower price. Buy these products; 
 you can get the same thing for a lot less money. Don&apos;t 
 stray from your list: If you didn&apos;t write it on your 
 list, you don&apos;t need it. Bring your calculator: Is 
 24 ounces for $1.00 better than 36 ounces for $1.25? 
 Bring a calculator with you to figure out the best 
 deal. Buy in bulk: It never hurts to stock up on items 
 you use frequently. Bulk is often cheaper, so fill 
 your cart. Be sure that you are able to use the item 
 before it goes bad. Don&apos;t shop on an empty stomach: 
 Everything looks good when you&apos;re hungry. Eat before 
 you shop so you&apos;re less tempted to pick up anything 
 and everything that looks good. (Posted: 10/6/10) 107. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Watching 
 your order total at the checkout can be daunting. 
 Take these steps to help ease the pain. Plan ahead: 
 Map out your meals for the entire week. Go through 
 your cabinets, fridge and pantry, making a list of 
 any items you&apos;ll need for your planned meals. Cut 
 coupons: Savings of 25 cents here and 75 cents there 
 can add up fast. Look for sales: Ads for savings are 
 what make the Sunday paper so thick. Take advantage 
 of them. Look for flyers throughout the week, pay 
 attention to TV commercials and check junk mail for 
 coupons before you throw it away. Shop around: Don&apos;t 
 limit yourself to one grocery store. One store may 
 have great dairy prices but overpriced produce. Another 
 could have good meat sales, but your favorite cereal 
 is too expensive. Pick and choose what you&apos;ll buy 
 from each store. (Posted: 9/29/10) 106. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Find the shortest route: The shorter the distance 
 you have to travel, the less gas you will have to 
 use. Combine errands: Run as many errands as you can 
 in one trip to cut down on your driving time. Carpool: 
 If your co-workers live nearby, take turns driving 
 each other to work. If you&apos;re going out with your 
 friends or family, fit as many people as you can into 
 a single vehicle. Use public transportation: If the 
 option is available, take a bus, train or taxi instead 
 of driving. Take a walk: If you live close enough, 
 try walking to work. It&apos;s free and healthy. Ride a 
 bike: You may live a little too far to walk, but you 
 can try hopping on a bicycle to make your commute. 
 Again, this option is free and healthy. (Posted: 9/22/10) 105.

 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Consider the savings: It costs an average of 36 cents 
 per mile to own and operate an automobile. Don&apos;t drive 
 all the way across town to save a nickel on a gallon 
 of milk. Keep moving: Stop-and-go driving not only 
 wears out your engine faster, but also uses more gas 
 than moving at a steady pace. Use cruise control: 
 If you&apos;re not going to be hitting any stop signs or 
 traffic lights, set your cruise control to conserve 
 gas. Slow down: It&apos;s simple. Drive the speed limit 
 to save gas as well as make your life a whole lot 
 easier. Keep it light: Remove any heavy, unnecessary 
 items from your car. An extra 100 pounds can decrease 
 fuel economy of an average automobile by about one 
 percent. (Posted: 9/8/10) 103. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Getting 
 from point A to point B can really cut into your budget. 
 Here&apos;s how to get where you need to go without breaking 
 the bank.
Get regular tune-ups: Keep all of the moving parts 
 in your car running smoothly to get better gas mileage 
 and prolong the life of your vehicle. Turn off the 
 AC: Roll down your windows and let the air cool your 
 car. Keep air in your tires: Underinflated or flat 
 tires will reduce gas mileage. Shop around for gas: 
 Before you pull over and start filling up, shop around 
 for the cheapest place to get gas. Try to avoid traffic: 
 Idling in traffic can burn up lots of gas. Try to 
 avoid rush hour traffic as much as possible. (Posted: 
 9/1/10) 102. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Eliminate drafts: Use caulk or weather-stripping to 
 strengthen the seal around doors and windows to eliminate 
 the loss of hot or cool air. Shade your windows: Close 
 shades, blinds or drapes during the day to keep light 
 and heat from coming in through the windows. Direct 
 sunlight will heat your home and cause the AC to work 
 harder. Alternately, uncovering windows to let sun 
 in could be helpful for heating in the winter. Plant 
 a tree: Strategic placement of trees and bushes around 
 your home can increase shade and decrease energy consumption. 
 Try shading your air conditioning unit as well as 
 windows that get a lot of sun. Just three trees can 
 save between $100 and $250 a year in heating and cooling 
 costs. (Posted: 8/25/10) 101. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Close 
 the flu damper in your fireplace: Don&apos;t let hot or 
 cold air escape out of the fireplace. Keep the flu 
 closed. Insulate your water heater: Pack insulation 
 around your water heater to help retain heat. Also 
 try turning the heater&apos;s thermostat down a few degrees. 
 Install low flow showerheads: You can cut your shower&apos;s 
 water consumption in half by installing one of these. 
 Change washing machine settings: Heating water uses 
 energy and costs money. Wash your clothes in warm 
 or cold water instead of hot. Use a gas dryer: Gas 
 dryers use less energy than their electric counterparts. 
 Open a window: Take advantage of Mother Nature. If 
 the weather&apos;s nice, turn off the air or heat and open 
 the windows. (Posted: 8/18/10) 100. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Do the dishes: Use reusable dishes for your meals 
 instead of paper plates and cups. Hang your clothes 
 out to dry: The dryer uses a lot of energy. It takes 
 a lot to run, plus it can also heat up your house, 
 causing your air conditioner to have to work harder. 
 Accomplish that fresh, dried-on-the-line smell in 
 your own backyard. Buy energy efficient appliances: 
 If you are in the market for new appliances, take 
 energy efficiency into account. Look for items with 
 the Energy Star label. Get an energy audit: Your electric 
 or gas company can send someone to your home to tell 
 you specifically what you can do to make your home 
 more energy efficient. Enroll in cost saving programs: 
 Ask your energy company if they offer any load management, 
 off-hour rate or other cost saving programs that you 
 can take advantage of. (Posted: 8/11/10) 99. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. If 
 you happen to like Godiva, consider joining their 
 Reward Club. Members receive a FREE piece of chocolate 
 every month and a FREE gift every time you spend $10 
 or more. (Note you have to stop by a Godiva Boutique 
 to get the freebie). And club members are privy to 
 an exclusive online special on the 16th of every month. 
 Sign up online or in one of three local Godiva Boutiques. 
 Downgrade your phone services: When&apos;s the last time 
 you used call forwarding or had a three way chat? 
 Only use services that are absolutely necessary. Take 
 advantage of free long distance with your cell phone 
 if possible. Consider using VoIP or a cell phone to 
 eliminate your land line. Use cloth napkins, towels 
 and diapers: Paper napkins, paper towels and disposable 
 diapers are easy and convenient, but cloth can be 
 washed and used again. Use these to save money and 
 the environment. (Posted: 8/4/10) 98. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Cook at home often: If both the husband and wife work, 
 this is likely to be very difficult. Start out with 
 the habit of cooking at home once a week and slowly 
 increase the frequency until you find a balance between 
 saving money and getting stressed out. Even though 
 the author may have overestimated the savings from 
 skipping a latte at Starbucks, don’t underestimate 
 the ding it puts in your pocket in the long run. You 
 don’t have to entirely ban drinking coffee, 
 but skip it as often as possible unless you make it 
 at home. Brown bag lunch at least a few days a week: 
 Lunch times are great opportunities to network and 
 make connections that could improve your career growth. 
 So unless there is a common eating area for brown 
 baggers, you may choose to limit brown bagging lunch 
 to three days each week. (Posted: 7/28/10) 97. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Discover 
 card is pleased to announce that they have improved 
 the cash back rewards program and made it a little 
 easier and more fun to use. Discover is a great credit 
 card to have as it offers 3% cash back and you get 
 rotating rewards that offer up to 5% cash back every 
 quarter. Sign up for the CVS Extra Care Card. The 
 drug store chain offers free Extra Care Bucks when 
 you shop, which will make some items free of charge. 
 here are plenty of auto insurance companies out there 
 to choose from. And each one will tell you they can 
 save you money. That’s why it’s important 
 to make informed decision about your auto coverage. 
 Rates can vary by hundreds of dollars or more from 
 one company to the next—even for the same 
 coverage limits and deductibles. And companies make 
 it remarkably easy to get a quote. That’s why 
 it pays to shop around. (Posted: 7/21/10) 96. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 No one says you have to hold down a traditional part-time 
 job, but there are tons of ways to make an extra buck 
 or two while you’re in college. Solicit grad 
 students for help with their dissertation research, 
 proofreading, editing or document typing and formatting. 
 Don&apos;t forget to work extra and save up during the 
 summer to make the school year more comfortable. Offer 
 a resume writing service. This can make you quite 
 a bit of extra pocket money. But put it in savings. 
 Good luck! If you think“thrifty”we think 
 you could possibly leave college with a little in 
 your savings account to show for your hard work and 
 efforts. Any-size drinks are 99 cents all summer long 
 at Wendy&apos;s locations and only $1 at McDonald&apos;s restaurants. 
 If you want to do even better, visit Speedway where 
 drinks are only 89 cents all summer long for any size! 
 (Posted: 7/14/10) 95. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Get 
 a dog. While feeding them may seem expensive, they 
 offer low cost company ready for a walk if you get 
 lonely or might not exercise as much as you should. 
 Dogs love exercise. We&apos;re not endorsing prostitution, 
 but if you can give some of yourself by donating blood 
 plasma, you can net an extra couple hundred dollars 
 a month. But, be careful if you try combining this 
 with alchohol. Volunteer for a medical study. Most 
 do not require much time and you get paid! Sell your 
 expertise in a subject as a tutor, computer skills, 
 music lessons. Get a job in the food service industry. 
 Chances are high that you can eat for free! Be your 
 campus computer tech. Troubleshoot computer issues 
 in exchange for a few bucks or a beer. Make yourself 
 available in a pinch. (Posted: 7/7/10) 94. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 If you need music to help you have the motivation 
 to exercise, iPods and similar devices can be bought 
 for around $100. Many music fans also take advantage 
 of low download costs or free downloadable music offers. 
 Ask someone to sponsor you for a marathon or other 
 run. People do it all the time for charities. Turn 
 paying for your education into a noble cause. Enroll 
 in an on-campus exercise class such as yoga, tai chi, 
 kick-boxing or spinning. Exercise will keep you healthier 
 and happier and will fill up time you might otherwise 
 have spent spending money. eeling down and getting 
 the urge to splurge? Instead go for a run, a bike 
 ride, or a brisk walk. You’ll get some exercise-induced 
 serotonin coursing through your brain and the feeling 
 will cost you nothing. (Posted: 6/30/10) 93. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. If 
 you are already involved with an athletic program, 
 you will have plenty of opportunity to travel off 
 campus and socialize with other students. Meals will 
 typically be covered during team travel, too. If you 
 are on an athletic scholarship you will already have 
 plenty of time scheduled for practice and games or 
 competition to worry about money. Join a club or intramural 
 sport. It will gain you instant friends and offer 
 no-cost exercise and socialization. Buy an exercise 
 video game. A console and exercise game together cost 
 under $200 and offer weeks or months of fun. Who knew 
 you could lose weight playing video games? Playstation 
 2 offers a video game called Kinetic - The Personal

 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Shop for your personal items at a discount retailer. 
 Money strategists suggest buying the“store 
 brand”as a cost-saving alternative, as well. 
 Doing laundry costs money. A machine load of laundry 
 costs at least a $1, and in most places a good bit 
 more than that. Don’t drop your laundry at a 
 service, stay and wash it yourself. Spend the time 
 studying or decide to use laundry time to catch up 
 on your favorite magazine or book. If you are totally 
 outraged with the cost to wash and dry at the nearest 
 laundry joint or your residence laundry machines, 
 then shop for cheaper at another nearby residential 
 building. Most have laundry rooms. Keep your ear to 
 the ground for the best cost per load deal in the 
 area and only wash when it’s necessary. (Posted:

 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. You 
 don’t have to let your hair grow to your knees, 
 but you don’t have to choose the toniest“hair 
 design”spot in town either. Shop around for 
 a salon that offers student discounts. Share the cost 
 for personal toiletries. This works well if you share 
 a room, apartment or suite with others and can agree 
 on products that suit both or all: soap, shampoo, 
 blow dryer, curling iron, hair spray, conditioner, 
 package of razors, shaving cream, lotions, toothpaste, 
 mouth wash, etc. Whether you share or not, it’s 
 always a cost-saver to avoid high-end grooming products. 
 You don’t really need the most expensive shampoo 
 or facial scrub to keep yourself looking good. High-end 
 products can run you between $10 and $20 per product. 
 Buy affordable and quality products at much lower 
 prices. (Posted: 6/9/10) 90. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Speedway gas stations are now featuring all fountain, 
 frozen and coffee drinks in all sizes for only 89 
 cents each. The special price began on June 1 and 
 runs all summer long. Use a pay-as-you-go cell phone 
 plan. This will only work if you use your cell phone 
 on a minimal basis. Communicate via email, instant 
 messangers, create a blog, share photos on Flickr, 
 or invite friends to visit your MySpace site. If you 
 are traveling, especially out of the country, catch 
 up with friends and family before you leave, and check 
 into the various international calling cards available. 
 Ladies, how‘bout forego the salon nails for 
 the year. Instead make it a girl’s night in 
 and do each other’s nails. Same thing for waxes 
 and facials. (Posted: 6/2/10) 89. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Check 
 prices for Amtrak or Greyhound versus air travel. 
 Both companies offer student discounts. A student 
 travel discount card will get you nice discounts on 
 accommodations, food, and transportation if you are 
 traveling nationally or internationally. Carpool home 
 for the holidays. When everyone splits the cost of 
 gas, it’s pretty darn cheap. Nearly all money 
 experts say“Skip Spring Break!”Some 
 students even choose to engage in community service 
 during spring break. Join your parents’family 
 cell phone plan. It is usually much cheaper than a 
 standalone account. Refer to cell phone comparison 
 sites that offer side-by-side data of plans from company 
 to company. Save time and save money on your next 
 cell phone plan: Avoid text messaging. (Posted: 5/26/10) 88. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Don’t take the car to campus. You will spend 
 money on parking and gas, at the very least. Having 
 no car will keep you closer to campus as well. Walk, 
 bike, roller blade, skateboard your way around town. 
 Public transportation is cheap, too. Save money by 
 doing the least amount of traveling necessary. Road 
 trips are great fun, but you will put out money for 
 gas, accommodations, food, drink andentertainment. 
 When it’s all said and done, your long weekend 
 will smack your wallet. Name your own price for a 
 flight or accommodations, if you must travel, by using 
 services such as Priceline. Factors such as current 
 events and gas prices may cause travel prices to fluctuate.

 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Don’t 
 shop hungry, and that goes for any kind of shopping. 
 If you’re in the grocery store, you’ll 
 grab more and spend more; if you’re somewhere 
 else you’ll probably spend more than you planned 
 getting something to eat. Carry a snack in your purse 
 or backpack. Learn how to shop for clothes at the 
 consignment shop. Today’s second-hand is nothing 
 like your mother’s thrift store. In fact, these 
 places are regularly trafficked by college students 
 and others for the great finds in name brand,“gently 
 used”clothes and accessories. While we’re 
 on the subject of saving on clothes shopping, remember 
 to make sure your fine consignment garments are washable 
 versus“dry clean only.”Buy all of your 
 cut flowers and roses from Kroger. It is way cheaper 
 than Busch&apos;s and Hiller&apos;s grocery stores. (Posted:

 Get a few friends together to pitch in for the price 
 of an annual membership at a place like Sam’s 
 Club or Costco. Buy in bulk. You’ll save money 
 per unit for a pack of twelve bars of soap versus 
 singles. Don’t shop hungry, and that goes for 
 any kind of shopping. If you’re in the grocery 
 store, you’ll grab more and spend more; if you’re 
 somewhere else you’ll probably spend more than 
 you planned getting something to eat. Carry a snack 
 in your purse or backpack. Save time and transportation 
 money by shopping online. Make sure you choose an 
 e-tailer with free shipping. Save money in decorating 
 the dorm room by shopping at discount stores and maybe 
 a yard sale or two. The Pottery Barn dorm room may 
 be great, but it’s definitely not on the bargain 
 table. (Posted: 5/5/10) 85. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Living 
 on an upper floor will typically keep you warmer in 
 the winter, but it’ll get hotter in the summer. 
 If you go to school in a region where winters are 
 longer then upper floors are smart, otherwise live 
 low. If winters are cold and heat bills are high you 
 can insulate your windows with plastic. If you have 
 to shop, make sure you patronize places that offer 
 student discounts. Shop for stuff you really need 
 during the tax-free week - available in many regions 
 of the country. Shop early or late for Christmas and 
 the holidays. There is no more stressful time for 
 someone close to broke than the holidays. In fact, 
 some shopping mavens stress that there is no better 
 time to pick up Christmas presents than the day after 
 Christmas! Need a quick Christmas gift for a friend 
 you have yet to see? Buy last minute on clearance 
 sales. Also, buy for next year. (Posted: 4/28/10) 84. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Play on the web! The web is a virtually limitless 
 land which will allow you to deeply explore any topic 
 of interest, and participate in communities discussing 
 those topics. You can also play games like Zuma or visit true time waster sites like HotorNot.com . 
 Get a studio appartment or split rent with roommates. 
 Rent a place that will have all appliances provided. 
 Bringing in your own or having to buy is a hassle. 
 Think you can live without the microwave? You will 
 likely wish you had one. ay utility bills before they 
 are due. Avoid late fees. Save money on bills by keeping 
 the A/C or heat turned down or off if possible. Turn 
 off lights; use the oven sparingly and take shorter 
 showers. Electricity costs money. If you find an apartment 
 where utilities may run on natural gas (stove, hot 
 water heater) it’s generally more cost-efficient.

 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Avoid 
 spending money this weekend. Be creative in what you 
 choose to do, even if it includes a picnic, a long 
 walk, flying a kite, a pick up game of soccer or football, 
 an impromptu poker game (not played for money), or 
 reading a good book. Volunteer in a soup kitchen or 
 help build homes with Habitat for Humanity. Community 
 service activities like this will not only help you 
 fill free time wisely, but youll come away with 
 a real appreciation for those who have no money. Pick 
 up a local newspaper and check upcoming events for 
 freebies: concerts, arts and crafts fairs, theater, 
 festivals, art galleries, and museums. (Posted: 4/14/10) 82. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Trying to save money on going out to the movies? Hit 
 the matinee showings. Look for free movies on campus; 
 chances are you will find classics, independents, 
 student films, noir and experimental. Start a book 
 club. Read for entertainment, then get a group together 
 to discuss it and enjoy each other’s company. 
 Any interest would work for group involvement: stamp 
 collecting, scrap-booking, weight training, running, 
 cooking, and chess. Offer your services as a tutor. 
 Anytime you have the opportunity to help others is 
 less time you have worrying about what you don’t 
 have or think you need. The sooner you find out that 
 you can survive nicely on very little, the better 
 off you will be; or should we say, the richer you’ll 
 be. (Posted: 4/7/10) 81. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. While 
 you’re in college don’t take risks with 
 your electronic equipment. Laptops and other trendy 
 little electronics can be made off with quickly in 
 a dorm environment. Unless you’ve bought some 
 renter’s insurance, you will foot the bill to 
 replace. Keep your room locked and valuables stowed. 
 Not only do we suggest you protect your physical property, 
 but you’ll head off future repair bills if you 
 protect your computer investment with anti-virus software 
 and a firewall. Anti-virus and firewall protection 
 will keep your computer in top working order and it 
 will last much longer. Forget about the T.V. You can 
 watch cable television through your computer. Make 
 sure your desktop or laptop has a DVD/CD player and 
 you can also watch your favorite movies. Your laptop 
 has graphics equal to most HDTVs, so enjoy. (Posted:

 Are you going to college and don’t have anything 
 to eat, dining hall closed? Go to a take-out joint 
 if you must, or some other low-cost eatery where self-serve 
 is available and you are not obligated to tip. If 
 you’re buying a computer, save by shopping the 
 student specials; discounts, rebates and back to school 
 specials. Some regions/states even have a tax-free 
 shopping week. Apple Computer offers student discounts 
 to students and teachers, and consistently advertises 
 important education incentives and rebates. Decline 
 extended warranties. Your computer should be under 
 manufacturer’s warranty for the first year anyway. 
 Companies dupe you into believing the plan is worthwhile. 
 They become rich off your extra cash. Anything extra 
 is likely just….extra. (Posted: 3/24/10) 79. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Skip 
 the fast food forays and late night take-out. Make 
 sure you keep healthy, affordable options in your 
 room or apartment. Yogurt, cottage cheese, string 
 cheese, bagels, peanut butter are all affordable, 
 convenient and much more healthy than a late night 
 burger and fries. Collect coupons and follow the weekly 
 sales at the grocery store. Avoid high-end markets 
 like Whole Foods. These are nice, but most products 
 cost much more. Once youre out of school and 
 have a good job you can shop the upscale markets. 
 Kick the bottled water habit; support your local tap 
 water and drink for free. Get a some kind of filter 
 if you want better tasting water. (Posted: 3/17/10) 78.

 At a sit-down restaurant, avoid ordering the alcoholic 
 beverages. Most restaurants make a killing on beer, 
 wine and fancy cocktails. The alcohol mark up can 
 be anywhere between 75 and 400 percent! If you can’t 
 borrow, buy used college textbooks. On sites like 
 Amazon.com used hardcover books are often cheapest. 
 Soft cover are more valued for convenience, so if 
 you’re willing to haul a couple extra ounces, 
 then hardcover is the cost-saving choice. ISBN.nu 
 allows you to easily compare book prices from major 
 online book stores. The campus bookstore will sell 
 a supply of used books, but they are limited; so check 
 the online sources as well. Collect coupons and follow 
 the weekly sales at the grocery store. Avoid high-end 
 markets like Whole Foods. These are nice, but most 
 products cost much more. Once you’re out of 
 school and have a good job you can shop the upscale 
 markets. (Posted: 3/10/10) 77. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. Bulk 
 is good. Think about shopping and buying in bulk. 
 Save money grocery shopping by planning meals in advance 
 and bulk-buying. You can also save money by cooking 
 in bulk. This is a real way you can save money with 
 little preparation and almost no extra outlay. Always 
 purchase generics when you can. Make sure a sale is 
 a sale. By this I mean do your price research before 
 you commit to making an expensive purchase in a retailers 
 money-off sale. You have to be sure the sale really 
 is a sale and not a creative marketing strategy of 
 the store to encourage you to spend your money without 
 thinking. Eat in rather than out. This is a huge area 
 where you can save money. A cup of coffee taken out 
 could easily cost you TWENTY times (or more) what 
 it would cost you to make it at home. So think before 
 you drink when you are out. Eating is the same. (Posted:

 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 If there&apos;s one certainty in life, it&apos;s that unexpected 
 things can happen at any time. A well established 
 savings account can help prevent a financial crisis 
 when these situations arise. While the temptation 
 to purchase the latest product from the top manufacturer 
 on the market can be strong, the money that you can 
 save by buying used and non-brand name products can 
 be substantial. Refurbished or&quot;Like-New&quot;products are often just as reliable as new ones and 
 can cost significantly less. No matter how frugal 
 you think you are, there are always ways more ways 
 that you can cut the fat. That subscription to Angler&apos;s 
 Weekly that you never read? Those 500 cable channels 
 that you never watch? That 5,000 minute-a-month phone 
 plan that you never come close to reaching? All of 
 those can go. (Posted: 2/24/10) 75. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. I first 
 learned the power of this back in college, when I 
 discovered that I could get my textbooks for free, 
 by buying and selling them at Amazon. I was paying 
 a few bucks (at most) for my textbooks that many of 
 my classmates were paying over $100 for. Second, public 
 libraries are home to a wealth of resources. Of course 
 you can borrow books instead of buying them, but they 
 also often have subscriptions to high cost services 
 or publications like Hoovers or Valueline. Our local 
 library has grown a huge collection of popular CDs 
 and DVDs over the last few years. So, it can be a 
 cheap (free) ways to catch a few good movies. Third, 
 Don’t buy clothes that will only work as one 
 outfit. Look for clothes that you will be able to 
 wear with many other things, creating multiple outfits. 
 Instead of buying that green and purple striped coat 
 that will only go with one or two outfits, you could 
 get a solid color gray that will work most of what 
 you wear. Spend less money on the trendy items that 
 won’t be in style long, and spend more on quality 
 items. (Posted: 2/17/10) 74. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, pay Off Your Credit Card Debt: While having 
 a credit card that you pay off in full each month 
 is perfectly acceptable (even recommended if you&apos;re 
 trying to build up your credit), having an outstanding 
 balance that you have to pay interest on is a recipe 
 for disaster. Second, don&apos;t Buy Things You Can&apos;t Afford 
 Outright: One of the main reasons that people go into 
 debt (and consequently cannot save money) is that 
 they buy things they can&apos;t afford on credit. Even 
 if you eventually pay off the debt, the extra money 
 that you pay in interest will mean that you&apos;ve payed 
 more for the item than it was even worth in the first 
 place. Third, Save Money to Pay Off Your Debt: The 
 same principles that you can use to curb your spending 
 and start putting money away for savings can also 
 be used to save up enough money to pay off your debts. 
 Start by figuring out how much debt you need to pay 
 off, and then calculate how much you will need to 
 save each month in order to pay it off in a reasonable 
 amount of time (don&apos;t forget to calculate the interest 
 in). (Posted: 2/10/10) 73. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 compare low-cost carriers with major carriers that 
 fly to your destination. Remember, the best fares 
 may not be out of the airport closest to you. Second, 
 you may save by including a Saturday evening stay-over 
 or by purchasing the ticket at least 14 days in advance. 
 Ask which days of the week and times of the day have 
 the lowest fare. Third, even if you are using a travel 
 agent, check airline and Internet travel sites, and 
 look for special deals. If you call, always ask for 
 the lowest fare to your destination. Next, since car 
 rental rates can vary greatly, compare total price 
 (including taxes and surcharge) and take advantage 
 of any special offers and membership discounts. Finally, 
 rental car companies offer various insurance and waiver 
 options. Check with your automobile insurance agent 
 and credit card company in advance to avoid duplicating 
 any coverage you may already have. (Posted: 1/6/10) 72. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money 
 on groceries. Go shopping alone. Have a budget and 
 stick to it. Make fewer, larger trips. Don’t 
 shop hungry. Plan your meals in advance. Scan your 
 cupboards, pantry, and fridge before leaving. Keep 
 a running list of items you need on your fridge. Break 
 your list down by store and plan your outing accordingly. 
 Plan your trip through the store to minimize wandering 
 the aisles. Don’t forget your list when you 
 head to the store, but. Be willing to deviate from 
 your list for great deals. Don’t be afraid of 
 store brands. Buy the Sunday paper. Keep an eye on 
 the weekly store circular. Clip (and use!) coupons 
 for name brand items. Check the store’s website 
 for printable coupons. Be on the lookout for“double 
 coupon”days. Stack manufacturer and store coupons. 
 Keep a price list/book so you know a deal when you 
 see one. (Posted: 12/30/09) 71. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 go grocery shopping while you are in a hurry: Maybe 
 you need to go out in a couple of hours. Or your favorite 
 show is going to be on TV after a couple of hours. 
 Try to squeeze in the grocery trip in that intermediate 
 time. Armed with your grocery list, you should be 
 in-and-out very quickly with little time for meandering 
 and getting tempted to buy things you don’t 
 need. Second, watch out for expiration dates on perishable 
 goods: This one seems intuitive when you read it, 
 but I am surprised at how many people do not pay attention 
 to expiry dates. No point getting a gallon of milk 
 if it is going to turn sour with a couple of days. 
 Same goes for meat, eggs, yogurt, spreads, frozen 
 items, deli/bakery items etc. Third, use grocery store 
 bags to line trash cans: This may not work if you 
 use a massive trash can but we use a small sized one 
 for which the grocery bags are a perfect fit. This 
 not only helps us save some money, but reduces our 
 environmental foot print and avoids the kitchen from 
 stinking from a huge overflowing trash can. (Posted:

 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, eat out less. While eating out can be fun and 
 delicious, it can also take a serious bite out of 
 your wallet. Try eating in more often and packing 
 yourself a lunch for eating at work or at school. 
 Besides saving money, making your own food can often 
 be healthier too. Second, eliminate expensive coffee 
 drinks. If you stopped yourself from buying a $3.50 
 Latte every day from Starbucks, you would have about 
 $100 a month extra to put into your savings account. 
 Buy yourself a simple coffee maker and some ground 
 coffee beans at the supermarket and you&apos;ll be able 
 to get your caffeine fix without spending a fortune. 
 Third, buy used or non-name brand products. While 
 the temptation to purchase the latest product from 
 the top manufacturer on the market can be strong, 
 the money that you can save by buying used and non-brand 
 name products can be substantial. Refurbished or&quot;Like-New&quot;products are often just as reliable as new ones and 
 can cost significantly less. (Posted: 12/16/09) 69. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 buy a used car. Because cars lose most of their value 
 in the first few years, buying used allows you to 
 drive a vehicle you probably couldn&apos;t afford brand 
 new. Recent used models -- those that are less than 
 five years old -- can be a real value because you 
 get a nearly new car still in fine working order for 
 a fraction of the new-car price. And you&apos;ll pay less 
 for collision insurance and taxes, too. Second, buy 
 a gas sipper not a guzzler. Drive 1,200 miles per 
 month in a car that averages 18 miles per gallon, 
 and you&apos;ll spend $233 per month (at $3.50 per gallon). 
 Drive a car that averages 25 miles per gallon, and 
 you&apos;ll spend $168 per month -- a savings of $65 per 
 month, or $780 per year. Third, re-shop your car insurance. 
 Using a comparison site like InsWeb.com can help you 
 determine if you&apos;ve got the best deal. Rates vary 
 widely from insurer to insurer. Your savings could 
 equal hundreds of dollars. Shopping around is especially 
 important for young adults because their rates could 
 drop as they approach age 25 or older, build a credit 
 rating, start a career and get married. (Posted: 12/9/09) 68. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, track Every Expense. Financial advisors say 
 the best way to control your spending is to know precisely 
 where all your cash is going each month. There are 
 several options: Make a budget; keep a spreadsheet 
 of all spending; or buy a computer program designed 
 to help manage your finances. Second, vacation in 
 the Off-season. Financial planner Frank Boucher says 
 he is taking his beach vacation in early September, 
 when he found a luxury condo for half its cost during 
 July and August. Vacationers can also save by staying 
 with friends or visi ting low-cost locations like 
 developing countries. Third, cut out Investment Charges 
 and Fees. Jeff Seymour of Triangle Wealth Management 
 in Cary, N.C., points out that many investors end 
 up paying 2% to 3% off the top each year for investing 
 costs. Lower-cost mutual funds and index funds can 
 slash that bill, savings that compound over several 
 decades of investing. Also, save more by taking full 
 advantage of your employer&apos;s matching contribution 
 to your 401(k) account. (Posted: 12/2/09) 67. 
 Black Friday and Cyber Monday are a little over a 
 week away. To get the best deals, visit websites such 
 as bfads.net , blackfriday.info , black-friday.net and theblackfriday.com . 
 Check out all the ads and then make a list of the 
 stores and what items you want to purchase from them. 
 Be sure to check when the stores open. Some stores 
 like Sears open at 4 a.m. while other stores like 
 Target open at 5 a.m. and some open at 5:30 a.m. like 
 Radio Shack. The best website for deals is bfads.net because you can actually look at the ads as they will 
 appear in your newspaper and print off a page or two 
 from your computer. Cyber Monday takes place on the 
 Monday after Black Friday weekend. For a list of all

 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 when dining at a restaurant, always get a free refill 
 on your drink, especially if you paid more than $2 
 for it. Most restaurants have paper or styrofoam cups 
 that you can take with you. That way you don&apos;t have 
 to buy a drink later when you return to your home 
 or office. Second, stop using credit cards. Pay for 
 everything with cash or money orders. Don&apos;t even use 
 checks. It&apos;s easier to overspend when you&apos;re pulling 
 from a bank or credit account because you don&apos;t know 
 exactly how much is in there. If you have cash, you 
 can see your supply running low. Third, open an interest-bearing 
 savings account. It’s a lot easier to keep track 
 of your savings if you have them separate from your 
 spending money. You can also usually get better interest 
 on savings accounts than on checking accounts (if 
 you get interest on your checking account at all). 
 Consider higher-interest options such as CDs or money-market 
 accounts for longer savings goals. (Posted: 11/11/09) 65. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, don’t beat yourself up when you make 
 a mistake. Even if you make ten good choices, it’s 
 easy to beat yourself up and feel like a failure over 
 one bad choice. If you make a big mistake and realize 
 it, think about why you realized it now instead of 
 then, and try to apply that later on. The memory of 
 that mistake can end up being very valuable, indeed. 
 Second, always keep looking ahead. Don’t let 
 the mistakes of your past drag you down into more 
 mistakes. Look ahead to the future. The choices you 
 make now won’t affect the past–but they 
 definitely will affect the future. Think back, and 
 remember how the bad choices you made earlier are 
 costing you now, and constantly remember to not make 
 those mistakes now so that they don’t cost your 
 future self. Third, never give up. Whenever the struggle 
 against debt feels like it’s too much, go read 
 a personal finance blog and remember that there are 
 a lot of people out there fighting the same fight. 
 Read around through the archives and learn some new 
 things–and perhaps get inspired to keep going, 
 no matter what. (Posted: 11/4/09) 64. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 utilize online bill pay with your bank. This serves 
 two purposes. First, it keeps you in much closer contact 
 with your money, as you can keep a very close eye 
 on your balance and be in much less danger of overdrafting. 
 Second, it saves you money on stamps and paper checks 
 by allowing you to just fill in an online form, click 
 submit, and have your bill paid. Second, buy staples 
 in bulk. We buy items we use a lot of in bulk, particularly 
 items that don’t perish–trash bags, 
 laundry detergent, diapers, and so on are purchased 
 in the largest amounts possible. This cuts down on 
 their cost per usage by quite a bit and, over the 
 long haul, begins to add up to some serious money. 
 Third, connect your entertainment center and/or computer 
 setup to a true smart power strip. A device like the 
 SmartStrip LCG4 basically cuts power to all devices 
 on the strip depending on the status of the first 
 item on the strip. So, if you have your workstation 
 hooked up to this, every time you power down your 
 workstation, your monitor powers down, your printer 
 powers down, your scanner powers down, and so on. 
 You can do the same thing with your entertainment 
 console–when you turn off the television, 
 the cable/satellite box also goes off, as does the 
 video game console, the VCR, the DVD player, and so 
 on. This can save you a lot of electricity and significantly 
 trim your power bill. (Posted: 10/28/09) 63. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, cut down on your vacation spending. Instead 
 of going on a big, extravagant trip, pack up the car 
 and see some of America some years for vacation. One 
 of the best vacations I’ve ever taken was when 
 my son was an infant–we just packed up the 
 car and drove around Minnesota, eventually camping 
 for a few days along the north shore of Lake Superior. 
 Second, cancel the cable or satellite channels you 
 don’t watch. Many people with cable services 
 often are paying for a premium package but rarely 
 watch those extra channels. For the longest time, 
 my wife and I were subscribed to HBO, Starz, and Cinemax, 
 yet we would only tune in once a month at best. We 
 argued that it was worth it because we could watch 
 a movie or a great drama whenever we wanted, but it 
 would have been far cheaper just to rent a movie. 
 Get rid of the excess channels and put that cash back 
 in your pocket. Third, exercise more. Go for a walk 
 or a jog each evening, and practice stretching and 
 some light muscle exercise at home. These exercises 
 can be done at home for very little, meaning you’ve 
 got an activity without a lot of cost, and the health 
 benefits are enormous. Just set aside some time each 
 day to get some exercise, and your body and wallet 
 will thank you. (Posted: 10/21/09) 62. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 make your own beer or wine. If you enjoy an occasional 
 drink, this is a great way to enjoy some of the beverages 
 that you love at a very cheap price. You can easily 
 make five gallons of beer or wine at once and it doesn’t 
 take that long, either, once you have the basic ingredients. 
 Second, make sure all your electrical devices are 
 on a surge protector. This is especially true of your 
 entertainment center and your computer equipment. 
 A power surge can damage these electronics very easily, 
 so spend the money for a basic surge protector and 
 keep your equipment plugged into such a device. Third, 
 get on an automatic debt repayment plan for any student 
 loans you have. Many student loans offer a rate reduction 
 if you sign up for their automatic debt repayment 
 plan. This way, not only do you save a few bucks a 
 month, you don’t have to go to the effort of 
 actually paying the bill. Our automatic plan saved 
 us about $60 a year. (Posted: 10/14/09) 61. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, if you need a haircut, go to Rex Barber Shop 
 at 24606 Ford Road in Dearborn Heights, Mich. Haircuts 
 are only $7 each. If you do not live in the Dearborn 
 Heights area, try Great Clips. Many Great Clips locations 
 have haircuts for only $5 each. Call ahead to find 
 out what specials are going on. Second, Use a brutally 
 effective coupon strategy. Here’s the trick: 
 wait a month before using the coupons. Save your coupon 
 flyer out of your Sunday paper for a month, then bust 
 it out and start cutting anything that might be of 
 interest. For a bonus kicker, use the coupons in comparison 
 with your grocery store flyer that week to find out 
 ways you can use a coupon to reduce the cost of an 
 item already on sale–you can wind up paying 
 pennies for some things and, on occasion, actually 
 get food for free. Third, Air seal your home. Most 
 homes have some air leaks that make the job of keeping 
 it cool in summer and warm in winter that much harder–and that much more costly for you. Spend an 
 afternoon air sealing your home–the DoE has 
 a great 
 guide on basic airsealing . (Posted: 10/7/09) 60. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 dine at Arby&apos;s for the new $5.01 combos. You can get 
 a sandwich, small fries and a drink for only one penny 
 over five dollars. Choose from the French Dip&amp;Swiss, Regular Roast Beef, Roast Chicken Ranch, Roast 
 Beef Gyro or the Roast Beef Patty Melt. Arby&apos;s also 
 special sales where you can get many menu items for 
 only a penny if you purchase a drink and fries with 
 a coupon. Second, Don’t overspend on hygiene 
 products. For most people, inexpensive hygiene products 
 do the trick–for example, I just buy whichever 
 toothpaste is the cheapest, and the same goes with 
 deodorant and the like. The key is to use this stuff 
 regularly and consistently–bathe daily, keep 
 yourself clean, and you’ll be just fine. Third, 
 Eat less meat. For the nutritional value, meat is 
 very expensive, especially as compared to vegetables 
 and fruits. Simply change around your regular meal 
 proportions to include more fruits and vegetables 
 and less meats–eat a smaller steak and a bigger 
 helping of green beans, for example. (Posted: 9/30/09) 59. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, buy a smaller house. I currently live in a 
 2,000 square foot house with my wife and two kids. 
 Frankly, it’s just the right size for us–if anything, it’s a little big. We often find 
 ourselves in the same room in the house, just surrounded 
 by empty space. You don’t need a giant place 
 to live. Second, drive a different route to work. 
 This is an especially powerful tip if you find yourself“automatically”stopping for something 
 on the way into work or the way home. Get rid of that 
 constant drain by selecting a different route that 
 doesn’t go by the temptation, even if the new 
 route is a bit longer. Third, always ask for fees 
 to be waived. Any time you sign up for a service of 
 any kind and there are sign-up fees, ask for them 
 to be waived. Sometimes (but not always), they will 
 be–and you save money just by being forthright 
 about not wanting to pay excessive fees. (Posted:

 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 encourage your friends to do less expensive activities. 
 This is often a tricky thing to do, but there are 
 a number of techniques you can try. My favorite 
 one is to be the first one to suggest something–that often gives you the power to steer 
 the group towards things that are cheaper. Second, 
 don’t speed. Not only is it inefficient in 
 terms of gasoline usage, it also can get you pulled 
 over and cost you a bundle, as I discovered a while 
 back. It’s highly cost-efficient to just drive 
 the speed limit, keep that gas in the tank, and 
 keep the cops off your tail. Third, read more. Reading 
 is one of the cheapest–and most beneficial–hobbies around. Most towns have a library 
 available to the public–just go there and 
 check out some books that interest you. Then, spend 
 some of your free time in a cozy place in your house, 
 just reading away. You’ll learn something 
 new, improve your reading ability, enjoy yourself, 
 and not have to spend a dime. (Posted: 9/16/09)

 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, use a simple razor to shave. I’ve been 
 a big advocate of the basic safety razor for a long 
 time, but that’s just one piece of the puzzle. 
 For“normal”shaves, I just shave in the 
 shower and dry off the blade afterwards, using just 
 soap for lather–incredibly cheap, since I 
 only swap blades once every few weeks. The real moral 
 of the story? Use a simple razor–not an expensive 
 electric one that stops working in three years–and shave your face when it’s wet. Second, find 
 out about all of the benefits of your job. Most people 
 aren’t even aware of all of the benefits available 
 to them. Spend some time with an HR person finding 
 out about all the benefits of your job–you 
 might be surprised at what you might find. I found 
 free tickets to sporting events, free personal improvement 
 opportunities, and an optional employee match on some 
 retirement funds that maximized the money I was socking 
 away. Third, make your own items instead of buying 
 them. I like to make my own laundry detergent and 
 my own Goo-Gone, for starters. I also like making 
 Glade, Windex, and Soft Scrub. In both cases, it’s 
 way cheaper than buying the commercial version. Hunt 
 around for recipes–it’s amazing how 
 many things you can make at home in just a few minutes 
 that saves a ton of money compared to the commercial 
 version. (Posted: 9/9/09) 56. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 consolidate your student loans. Interest rates are 
 quite low right now, so it might be worthwhile to 
 consolidate your student loans into one low-rate package. 
 Look into the various student loan consolidation packages 
 - even a 1% reduction on a $10,000 loan saves you 
 $100 a year - and your loan is probably bigger than 
 that (and the rate cut you could get is probably bigger). 
 Second, when buying a car, go for late model used. 
 These are typically cars coming straight off of leases, 
 meaning they were cared for by reliable owners. My 
 truck was purchased with this criteria and has lasted 
 me several years already with only one significant 
 issue - and I saved a ton of money on the purchase 
 price over buying new. Third, hit the library - hard. 
 Don’t look at a library as just a place to get 
 old books. Look at it as a free place to do all sorts 
 of things. I’ve used it to learn a foreign language, 
 meet people, use the Internet anonymously, check out 
 movies and CDs, grab local free newspapers, and keep 
 up on community events. Best of all, it doesn’t 
 cost a dime. (Posted: 9/2/09) 55. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, do some basic home and auto maintenance on 
 a regular schedule. Instead of just waiting until 
 something breaks to deal with it, develop a monthly 
 maintenance schedule where you go around your home 
 (and your car) and perform a bit of maintenance where 
 it’s needed. Second, pack food before you go 
 on a road trip. Have everyone pack a sack lunch for 
 the trip. That way, instead of stopping in the middle 
 of the trip, driving around looking for a place to 
 eat, spending a bunch of time there, and then paying 
 a hefty bill, you can just eat on the road or, better 
 yet, stop at a nice park and stretch for a bit. Third, 
 go through your cell phone bill, look for services 
 you don’t use, and ditch them. Sit down and 
 go through each item on your bill and see if there’s 
 anything there that you don’t use, like a surfeit 
 of text messages or web access or something to that 
 effect. Then call your cell phone company and ask 
 to have those services eliminated. (Posted: 8/27/09) 54. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 carpool. Is there anyone that lives near you who works 
 at the same place (or near the same place) that you 
 do? Why not ride together, alternating drivers each 
 day? You can halve the wear and tear and gas costs 
 for your car - and for your acquaintance as well. 
 Second, design your“debt snowball.”Everyone 
 needs a plan to help them get out of debt, so sit 
 down and plot out what debts you’re going to 
 pay off and in what order. Simply having a plan goes 
 a long way towards bringing that plan into action, 
 and paying off debts early is one of the surest ways 
 to put money in your pocket over the long run. Third, 
 get a crock pot. A crock pot is perhaps the best deal 
 on earth for reducing cooking costs in a busy family. 
 You can just dump in your ingredients before work, 
 put it on simmer, and dinner is done when you get 
 home. There are countless recipes out there for all 
 variety of foods, and every time you cook this way, 
 you’re saving money as compared to eating out. 
 (Posted: 8/20/09) 53. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, dig into your community calendar. There are 
 often tons of free events going on in your town that 
 you don’t even know about. Stop by the local 
 library or by city hall and ask how you can get ahold 
 of a listing of upcoming community events, and make 
 an effort to hit the interesting ones. Second, take 
 public transportation. If the city’s transit 
 system is available near you, take it to work (or 
 to play) instead of driving your car. It’s far 
 cheaper and you don’t have to worry about parking 
 your vehicle. Third, cut your own hair. I can cut 
 mine myself with a pair of clippers, for example. 
 I just cut it really short every once in a while and 
 don’t worry about it too much. Just put a garbage 
 bag over the bathroom sink, bust out the clippers 
 and scissors, and get it done. Two or three cuts will 
 pay for the clippers, and then you’re basically 
 getting free haircuts. With a bit of practice, you 
 can make it look good, too. (Posted: 8/13/09) 52. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 check out what your town’s parks and recreation 
 board has to offer. My town has several wonderful 
 parks, free basketball and tennis courts, free disc 
 golf, trails, and lots of other stuff just there waiting 
 to be used. You can go have fun for hours out in the 
 wonderful outdoors, playing sports, hiking on trails, 
 or trying other activities - and it’s all there 
 for free. Second, air up your tires. For every two 
 PSI that all of your tires are below the recommended 
 level, you lose 1% on your gas mileage. Most car tires 
 are five to ten PSI below the normal level, so that 
 means by just airing up your tires, you can improve 
 your gas mileage by up to 5%. It’s easy, too. 
 Just read your car’s manual to see what the 
 recommended tire pressure is, then head to the gas 
 station. Third, Start a garden. Gardening is an inexpensive 
 hobby if you have a yard. Just rent a tiller, till 
 up a patch, plant some plants, keep it weeded, and 
 you’ll have a very inexpensive hobby that produces 
 a huge amount of vegetables for you to eat at the 
 end of the season. I like planting a bunch of tomato 
 plants, keeping them cared for, then enjoying a huge 
 flood of tomatoes at the end of the summer. (Posted:

 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, if somethings broken, give a fair shot 
 at repairing it yourself before replacing it or calling 
 a repairman. Get a handymans book or advice 
 from the internet and give it a shot yourself. Second, 
 Invest in a deep freezer. A deep freezer, after the 
 initial investment, is a great bargain. You can use 
 it to store all sorts of bulk foods, which enables 
 you to pay less per pound of it at the market. Even 
 better, you can store lots of meals prepared in advance, 
 enabling you to just go home and pop something homemade 
 (and cheap) in the oven. Third, look for a cheaper 
 place to live. The cost of living in Iowa is surprisingly 
 low, enough so that Im quite happy to give up 
 the cultural opportunities of other places to enjoy 
 Iowa all year around. When I want to enjoy the cultural 
 opportunities of another place, Ill travel there 
 - after all, I can afford it. (Posted: 7/29/09) 50. Today, 
 we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 go through your clothes - all of them. If you have 
 a regular urge to buy clothes, go through everything 
 that you have and see what you might find. Take the 
 clothes at the back of the closet and bring them to 
 the front and suddenly your wardrobe will feel completely 
 different. Second, brown bag your lunch. Instead of 
 going out to eat at work, take your own lunch. Lots 
 of people think that this means“nasty lunch,”but it doesn’t. With some thoughtful preparation 
 and just a few minutes of time, you can create something 
 quite enjoyable for your brown bag lunch - and save 
 a fistful of cash each day, too. Third, learn how 
 to dress minimally. Buy clothes that mix and match 
 well and you’ll not need nearly as many clothes. 
 If you have five pants, seven shirts, and seven ties 
 that all go together, you have almost an endless wardrobe 
 right there just by mixing and matching. (Posted:

 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, get rid of unread magazine subscriptions. Do 
 you have a pile of unread magazines sitting around 
 your house? Likely, it’s the result of a subscription 
 that you’re not reading. Not only should you 
 not renew that magazine, you should give their subscription 
 department a call and try to cancel for a refund. 
 Secondly, eat breakfast. Eating a healthy breakfast 
 fills you up with energy for the day and also decreases 
 your desire to eat a big lunch in the middle of the 
 day. Not only that, breakfast can be very healthy, 
 quick, and inexpensive. Third, don’t fear leftovers 
 - instead, jazz them up. Many people dread eating 
 leftovers - they’re just inferior rehashes of 
 regular meals, not exactly enjoyable to the discerning 
 palate. However, there’s nothing cheaper than 
 eating leftovers and with a few great techniques for 
 making leftovers tasty, you can often end up with 
 something surprising and quite delicious on the other 
 end. My favorite technique? Chaining - using the leftovers 
 as a basis for an all-new dish. (Posted: 7/15/09) 48. Today, 
 we have more simple ways to save money. First, when 
 buying a car, go for reliability and fuel efficiency. 
 A reliable and fuel efficient car will save you thousands 
 over the long haul. Let’s say you drive a vehicle 
 for 80,000 miles. If you choose a 25 miles per gallon 
 car over a 15 miles per gallon car, you save 2,133 
 gallons of gas. At $3 a gallon, that’s $6,400 
 in savings right there. Secondly, don&apos;t go to stores 
 or shopping centers for entertainment. Doing so is 
 just an encouragement to spend money you don’t 
 really have on stuff you don’t really need. 
 Instead, find other places to entertain yourself - 
 the park, the basketball court, a museum, a friend’s 
 house, or even in your own home. Third, rent out unused 
 space in your home. Do you have an extra bedroom that’s 
 not being used? Rent it out. In our home, we could, 
 if times were tough, rent out our entire basement 
 - it has a“living room,”a bedroom, and 
 a bathroom and has a stairwell right by the kitchen. 
 (Posted: 7/8/09) 47. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 Try generic brands of items you buy regularly. ikely, 
 you’ll save a few cents now, but you’ll 
 also likely discover that the store brand is just 
 as good as the name brand - the only difference between 
 the two, often, is the marketing. Once you’re 
 on board the generic train, you’ll find your 
 regular grocery bill getting smaller and smaller. 
 Secondly, prepare some meals at home. Get an accessible 
 and easy-to-use cookbook (my favorite“beginner”cookbook is Mark Bittman’s excellent How 
 to Cook Everything ) and try making some of 
 the dishes inside. You’ll find that cooking 
 at home is much easier than you think - and way cheaper 
 and healthier than take-out or dining out. Third, 
 switch to term life insurance. Repeat after me: insurance 
 is not an investment. Switch to term insurance instead 
 and use that difference in cost to get yourself out 
 of debt and start building some wealth. (Posted: 6/30/09) 46. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 do your holiday shopping right after the holidays. 
 Most people use this technique for Christmas, but 
 it works for every holiday. Wait until about two days 
 after a holiday, then go out shopping for items you 
 need that are themed for that day. Get a Mother’s 
 Day card for next year the day after Mother’s 
 Day. Get Easter egg decorating kits the day after 
 Easter. Get wrapping paper and cards and such the 
 day after Christmas. Secondly, join up with a volunteer 
 program. It’s a great way to meet new people, 
 get some exercise, and involve yourself in a positive 
 project that can lift your spirit. It also comes without 
 a cost to you and can provide a lot of entertainment 
 and a fulfilling day when you’re in the right 
 mindset. Third, reevaluate the stuff in the rooms 
 in your house. Go into a room and go through every 
 single item in it. Do you really need that item? Are 
 you happy that it’s there, or would you be just 
 fine if it were not? If you can find stuff to get 
 rid of, get rid of it - it just creates clutter and 
 it might have some value to others. (Posted: 6/23/09) 45. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money 
 and get free food. White Castle is celebrating it&apos;s 
 88th anniversary in business. Click 
 here to print off your coupon for a free slider. 
 One coupon is valid per person per visit. Secondly, 
 Tropical Smoothie Cafe is celebrating Flip Flop Day 
 on June 19. The first 500 customers at all Tropical 
 Smoothie locations will receive a Jetty Punch smoothie 
 for FREE! All you have to do is show up in your flip 
 flops! Click 
 here to find the nearest location. Third, give 
 a gift of service instead of an item. For new parents, 
 give an evening of babysitting as a gift. If you know 
 pet owners, offer to take care of their pets when 
 they travel. Offer up some lawn care as a gift to 
 a new homeowner. (Posted: 6/17/09) 44. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 when shopping for standard items (clothes, sports 
 equipment, older games, etc.), start by shopping used. 
 Quite often, you can find the exact item you want 
 with a bit of clever shopping at used equipment stores, 
 used game stores, consignment shops, and so on. Just 
 make these shops a part of your normal routine - go 
 there first when looking for potential items and you 
 will save money. Secondly, keep your hands clean. 
 Just wash your hands thoroughly each time you use 
 the bathroom or handle raw foods. You’ll keep 
 yourself from acquiring all kinds of viruses and bacteria, 
 saving you on medical bills and medicine costs and 
 lost productivity. Third, remove your credit card 
 numbers from your online accounts. It’s easy 
 to spend online when you have your card information 
 stored in an account - just click and buy. The best 
 way to break this habit is to simply delete your card 
 from the account. (Posted: 6/10/09) 43. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, you should challenge yourself to make your 
 own things. Start out by making your own bread. It 
 is much cheaper, healthier and tastier than buying 
 a loaf from the store. Secondly, you should do a&quot;maintenance 
 run&quot;on your appliances.Check them to make sure 
 there isn’t any dust clogging them and that 
 they’re fairly clean. Look behind the appliances, 
 and use your vacuum to gently clear away dust. Check 
 all of the vents, especially on refrigerators, dryers, 
 and heating and cooling units. The less dust you have 
 blocking the mechanics of these devices, the more 
 efficiently they’ll run (saving you on your 
 energy bill) and the longer they’ll last (saving 
 you on replacement costs). Third, you should cancel 
 unused club memberships. For example, a gym membership 
 or a country club membership. You can always renew 
 at a later date. (Posted: 6/3/09) 42. 
 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 hide your credit cards. Yes, hide them! Put them somewhere 
 in your home but not in your wallet where it&apos;s easy 
 to spend them. Don&apos;t keep plastic on you until you 
 have the willpower to not use it even when you&apos;re 
 sorely tempted. Secondly, plan your meals around your 
 grocery store&apos;s flyer. Instead of planning meals based 
 on a cookbook, plan them around what&apos;s on sale. Look 
 at the biggest sales then plan meals based on those 
 ingredients. Third, do a price comparison and find 
 a cheaper grocery store. Just keep track of the twenty 
 or so things you buy most often, then shop for these 
 items at a variety of stores. Eventually, one store 
 will come out on top for your purchases - just make 
 that one your regular shopping destination and you&apos;ll 
 automatically save money. (Posted: 5/27/09) 41.

 Today, we have more simple ways to save money. First, 
 install a programmable thermostat in your home. These 
 devices will regulate the temperature in your house 
 automatically according to the schedule that you set. 
 When you&apos;re not home, it allows the heating or cooling 
 to turn off for serveral hours. It can cut your energy 
 bill by 10 to 20%. Secondly, buy appliances based 
 on reliability, not what&apos;s cheapest. If an appliance 
 saves energy and lasts for 15 years, you&apos;ll save significant 
 money in the long run. An hour&apos;s worth of research 
 now can save you hundreds of dollars later. Third, 
 clean your car&apos;s air filter. A clean air filter can 
 improve your gas mileage by up to 7%, saving you more 
 than $100 every 10,000 miles you drive. It only takes 
 a few minutes - just follow the directions in your 
 automobile&apos;s manual. (Posted: 5/13/09) 39. 
 This week, we have more simple ways to save money. 
 First, be diligent about turning off lights before 
 you leave. If you spend one minute turning off lights 
 before a two-hour trip, that&apos;s the equivalent of saving 
 $50 per hour. That&apos;s some impressive savings if you 
 do it before longer trips. Secondly, swap books, music 
 and DVDs cheaply on the interview with services wuch 
 as PaperBackSwap . 
 You can very easily swap books, CDs and DVDs that 
 you are bored of with others who want them. Clean 
 out our media collection and trade them with others 
 online. The best part is you&apos;ll get new books, CDs 
 and DVDs mailed right to you for free. Third, maximize 
 yard sales. Stop by yard sales and ask to lower the 
 prices. You can get a really big bargain or just walk 
 away with the money. (Posted: 5/6/09) 38. 
 Today, we&apos;re looking at how to save on food and beverages. 
 First, drink more water at home. One glass of water 
 before each meal will help you digest better and will 
 discourage you from eating more. You will feel better 
 because you will become more hydrated. Don&apos;t buy bottled 
 water. Drink water from the tap if you can. Cut back 
 on fast food restaurants and microwave meals. Try 
 making some simple and healthy replacements that you 
 can take with you. Make breakfast sandwiches, quick 
 sandwiches, chicken nuggets, and other things by scratch. 
 Buy the ingredients and make extra to keep in the 
 freezer. When cooking casseroles, make four times 
 as much as you need. Then, eat one now and put the 
 other three in the freezer. Next time you need a quick 
 meal, heat it up and you&apos;re good to go. It will be 
 much cheaper than eating out. (Posted: 4/29/09) 37. 
 This week, we look at simple ways to save money. First, 
 sign up for every free customer rewards program you 
 can. Just about every store offers a savings card 
 and they even have small ones to put on your keyring. 
 By showing your card at the register, you can save 
 a percent off the bill or receive free rewards to 
 spend on cash for future visits. Instead of throwing 
 out damaged clothing, just repair it. You can easily 
 fix a broken button or sew a hole in a pair of pants. 
 It just takes a few minutes and will be much cheaper 
 than buying a new piece of clothing. Call your credit 
 card company and ask for a lower interest rate. Tell 
 them if not, you will take your business elsewhere. 
 Most times your rate will go down lower or even down 
 to zero percent. You could save hundreds of dollars 
 per year. (Posted: 4/22/09) 36. 
 Today, we&apos;ve got two easy ways to save on your personal 
 care. First, dying your hair. Buy hair coloring from 
 a drug store or discount retailer instead at the hair 
 salon. It can cost as much as $100 at the salon when 
 you can spend only $7 by buying the box and doing 
 it yourself. Ask a friend or family member to help 
 you. Secondly, instead of paying membership fees at 
 the gym, buy a workout DVD. You only end up paying 
 once instead of once per month. You can save money 
 in the long run. Workout DVDs can cost $20 or $40 
 depending on what&apos;s included. Keep doing the workout 
 DVD and you&apos;ll see getting fit at a much cheaper price. 
 (Posted: 4/15/09) 35. 
 This week, we look at practical ways to save money 
 at home. First, turn off the television. Yes, turn 
 it off. Here&apos;s the benefits: less exposure to guilt-inducing 
 ads, more time to focus on other things in life, less 
 electrical use. Secondly, make your own gifts instead 
 of buying them. You can make food mixes, candles, 
 bread, cookies, soap and other things quite easily 
 and inexpensively. Not only will you have the homemade 
 touch, but it&apos;s consumable so you don&apos;t fill up someone&apos;s 
 closet with junk. Make a list before you go shopping 
 and stick to it. If you don&apos;t have a list, you&apos;ll 
 end up with many more things you don&apos;t need. Don&apos;t 
 buy anything that&apos;s not on your list. Third, master 
 the thirty day rule. When considering a major purchase, 
 wait 30 days and ask yourself if you stillwant the 
 item. (Posted: 4/8/09) 34. 
 There are many ways to save money on dating and entertainment. 
 First, most girls won&apos;t mind if you cook for them 
 instead of going out to eat. Exercise outdoors and 
 at home instead of paying a gym fee. If you drink, 
 buy cheap beer from a grocery store instead of at 
 the bars. Find cheap entertainment to do with friends 
 instead of going out on weekends. Go for a walk instead 
 of going out on the town. Have a feast/potluck/community 
 meal with friends. The food is better and everyone 
 shares the expense. Check out books and movies from 
 the library. Share books with friends. Wait until 
 moves come out on DVD and rent them instead of seeing 
 them at the theatre. It&apos;s a fraction of the cost. 
 (Posted: 4/1/09) 33. 
 When it&apos;s the summertime, that&apos;s the time to make 
 the money. Work at least 70 hours a week. That way 
 you have regular pay and overtime pay which is triple 
 more money coming in that way for you and your family. 
 Don&apos;t go on summer vacations, they can be extremely 
 expensive with airfare tickets, food expenses and 
 souvenirs. Don&apos;t take any courses at a college or 
 university during the spring/summer term. No students 
 take courses unless they extremely have too. This 
 is the time to work and save every penny for the fall 
 and winter semesters. Because during those semesters 
 you can&apos;t work that much. That way you have money 
 coming in. (Posted: 3/25/09) 32. 
 If you&apos;re a business traveler, you can save money 
 on your transportation. First, take public transportation 
 from the airport to your hotel. The average price 
 of a bus ticket is $1.75 for a one-way ride. That 
 is huge savings off the price of a taxi cab which 
 can cost $30 or more from the airport. Consider renting 
 a car if you are going to drive long distances. It 
 is best to book your rental car online, about a month 
 in advance to get the cheapest rate. Enterprise is 
 your best bet for a low rate. If your hotel charges 
 a fee for parking, consider parking in a off-hotel 
 lot. There may be a parking lot or garage just around 
 the corner from where you are staying with a much 
 cheaper rate. Look around for a bit before selecting 
 your spot. (Posted: 3/18/09) 31. 
 If you&apos;re a student, bag a lunch instead of going 
 out to eat everyday. Most places charge $6 for per 
 meal. That adds up to $30 per week or as much as $360 
 per semester. Most restaurants in the student center 
 at colleges charge a lot due to high rent costs. Those 
 restaurants tend to not offer drink refills. Include 
 in lunch bag: a bottle water or pop, a sandwich, an 
 apple, orange, chips, pretzels, cookies and a pack 
 of gum. Refill bottled water or thermos from the tap. 
 If you get sick of a bagged lunch, use 2 for 1 coupons 
 at restaurants so you can save money. Also, sign up 
 for email coupons at local restaurants. Most on-campus 
 restaurants offer a discount just by showing your 
 student ID card. (Posted: 3/11/09) 30. 
 Shop at your local dollar store. You can save as much 
 as 70 percent off name brand products when compared 
 to drug stores and supermarkets. The five largest 
 dollar stores are Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Family 
 Dollar, Fred&apos;s Super Dollar and 99 Cents Only. Often 
 times, the quality is just as high as the name brand 
 products. Check the ingredient labels on items -- 
 most times they will be exactly the same at a much 
 lower price. Snacks like potato chips, crackers, movie-theatre 
 candy and seasonal candy is about 50 percent off prices 
 at the supermarkets. The best savings will be on shampoo 
 and conditioners. Consumer Reports says the 
 quality on store-brand shampoos is just as high as 
 the expensive ones. Other items you can find cheaper 
 at the dollar store include gift wrap, scrapbooking 
 supplies, containers, kitchen gadgets and tools, children&apos;s 
 books and school supplies. (Posted: 3/4/09) 29. 
 Make a library card at a community college. Then, 
 print off papers in its library. Most community colleges 
 allow people to make 50 pages at one time for no charge. 
 It is not necessary to be a student there. The savings 
 will add up on both the paper and the cost of ink. 
 Most universities charge 8 to 10 cents per page so 
 go to your nearest community college instead. Don&apos;t 
 try Oakland Community College as they only allow students 
 to print 150 pages per semester. They have suspended 
 free printing for the public. Some univerities already 
 have websites dedicated to printing policies that 
 describe the number of pages a student may print. 
 (Posted: 2/25/09) 28. 
 Pay all of your bills online instead of sending them 
 in the mail. You will save on the cost of postage 
 and also on the cost of checks. Remember to record 
 online payments in your check book register. Some 
 credit card companies will give you a discount on 
 your bill if you go paper-less. You can save as much 
 as $70 per year. Due to rising costs, stamp prices 
 are set to go up to 44 cents each for a regular-sized 
 letter on May 11, 2009. Customers can purchase a Forever 
 Stamp before May 11 and can continue to use them beyond 
 the day of the rate change. Some banks also offer 
 free online banking. Check with your bank to see if 
 it offers that feature. (Posted: 2/18/09) 27. 
 When dining at fast food restaurants, take home extra 
 condiments. This includes napkins, straws, plastic 
 forks, knives and spoons. Also, take home extra sauces 
 such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, taco sauces 
 from Taco Bell and sandwich sauces from Arby&apos;s. Also, 
 take home toppings such as packets of pepper, salt, 
 and sugars. In addition, take home extra creams for 
 your coffee and crackers for your soup. Each time 
 you dine out, it is another opportunity for you to 
 save money when eating at home. Restaurants order 
 these items in bulk so they get them cheap. (Posted: 
 2/11/09) 26. 
 There are ways to save money on your prescription 
 drugs. First, ask your physician to consider prescribing 
 generic drugs. Generic drugs can cost several hundred 
 dollars less to purchase annually than brand-name 
 drugs. The average prescription for a generic cost 
 $29.82 in 2005, according to the National Association 
 of Chain Drug Stores, while the average brand-name 
 prescription cost $101.71. Secondly, find the lowest-cost 
 place to purchase prescription drugs. Make sure to 
 check out not only your local pharmacist but also 
 local supermarkets, area discount centers, and mail-order 
 pharmacies. Also consider purchasing storebrand over-the-counter 
 medications. Storebrand medications often cost 20-40 
 percent less than nationally advertised brands. The 
 savings could easily exceed $100 a year. (Posted: 
 1/7/09) 25. 
 There are many ways to save money while you are having 
 fun. Rent a video instead of going to the movies. 
 If you really want to go to the movies, go to the 
 less expensive afternoon&quot;matinee&quot;. AMC 
 Theaters offers a discount to those who see movies 
 before 5 p.m. for only $5 each. Another option is 
 to rent movies from your local library. Often times, 
 it will only cost $1 to rent a movie from your local 
 library on DVD or 50 cents for a VHS rental. Cancel 
 your cable (or at least premium channels), as well 
 as subscriptions to magazines and newspapers. Take 
 advantage of free entertainment in your community 
 -- parks, museums, exhibits. Go to free park concerts 
 and other community activities. (Posted: 12/31/08) 24. 
 The holiday shopping season comes to an end right 
 after Christmas. Just about every retailer is offering 
 special deals and discounts to shoppers who want to 
 use gift cards or make exchanges. Home Depot is giving 
 $300 off two or more select General Electric appliances 
 and up to 30% off Dirt Devil products. Macy&apos;s is offering 
 75% off fall items such as earrings, bedding and appliances. 
 Wal-Mart is going to offer 80% off jewelry, appliances 
 and toys, along with Christmas decorations. Target 
 is offering deep discounts on it&apos;s GO designer collection 
 with markdowns on appliances, games and toys. Sears 
 will be giving 40% off tradmills and further discounts 
 on New Year&apos;s Day. Circuit City is also offering discounts 
 on laptops, flat-screen TVs and digital cameras. (Posted: 
 12/24/08)

 There are many ways to save money while you eat 
 out at restaurants. Most restaurants offer special 
 prices at lunch time, as much as half the price 
 of their dinner prices. Some restaurants such as 
 Applebees offer half off appetizers at night. Baker&apos;s 
 Square offers a FREE slice of pie every Wednesday 
 with any purchase. You can just order a drink and 
 get your favorite kind of pie slice at no cost. 
 There are locations in Livonia and Warren in southeast 
 Michigan. Bennigan&apos;s is offering College Night every 
 Sunday. Students can receive half off all entrees 
 just by showing their college ID. Valid at locations 
 in Michigan: Plymouth, Ann Arbor, Madison Heights, 
 Okemos, Flint, Mt. Pleasant, Saginaw, Midland, Howell, 
 Kalamazoo, Portage, Walker, Big Rapids and Lansing. 
 (Posted: 12/17/08)

 Communication devices can be expensive but there are 
 ways to save on them. Many consumers are overpaying 
 for unneeded communications. For example, if you have 
 a cell phone, cancel your landline telephone. Secondly, 
 communicate via e-mail instead of by phone. E-mail 
 is free. Most phones come with contracts with a limited 
 amount of minutes. Read up about peak calling periods, 
 your coverage area, romaning and termination charges. 
 Dial phone numbers directly. If you need a number, 
 open the phone book or look online for it at yellowpages.com . 
 Don&apos;t call an operator. It can cost you up to $10 
 per each call to the operator. Now you can communicate 
 and save money at the same time. (Posted: 12/10/08) 21. 
 The holidays are here and the economy is officially 
 in a recession. There are some ways you can save money 
 on gift giving. First, look for estate sales and flea 
 markets for inexpensive gifts. Set a spending limit 
 on gifts for your spouse or closest friends. Consider 
 volunteering or giving charitable gifts to take the 
 focus off buying and wanting. Help out a food bank 
 or soup kitchen or agree to exchange gifts that support 
 charities. Make gift certificates or coupons to offer 
 free baby-sitting to your friends or to prepare a 
 home-cooked meal for them. Kids could give breakfast 
 in bed to their parents. A husband might offer candlelight 
 dinner at home. Let the kids make wrapping paper. 
 They can use old newsprint, fingerpaint, rubber stambs 
 or even stickers. Save on decorations by using branches, 
 piner cones, wire and ribbon to create holiday wreaths. 
 Let kids cut out paper snowflakes or other decorations. 
 (Posted: 12/3/08) 20. 
 There are many ways you can save on gas. First, keep 
 your car mantained. This means regular oil changes, 
 air filter replacement and properly inflated tires. 
 Secondly, drive smart at a steady speed for as long 
 as possible and use the cruise control when you an 
 over long distances. Increased acceleration and braking 
 can use unnecessary gas. Drive to work earlier so 
 you can avoid heavy stop and go rush hour traffic. 
 It will also be less stressful for you. Consider purchasing 
 a hybrid vehicle. You might have to pay more up front 
 but the savings will add up in the gasoline usage. 
 You may even get a tax credit for purchasing a hybrid 
 and it will save you hundreds of dollars a year. Plan 
 your travel so that it maximes your time on the road. 
 Combine trips to the grocer store, dry cleaners and 
 other errands. No need to make a separate trip. (Posted:

 Black Friday is just around the corner! It is also 
 known as the day after Thanksgiving when many retailers 
 hope to get back in the&quot;black&quot;and become 
 profitable just before Christmas. Almost every store 
 will be offering deep discounts. Many are even having 
 doorbusters, which are sales that normally begin at 
 5 - 6 a.m. and end at 11 a.m. or noon. You can preview 
 black friday ads online at websites such as bfads.net , www.blackfriday.info , www.theblackfriday.com and blackfriday.gottadeal.com . 
 Many of these websites will offer a scanned version 
 of the ad circular with pictures. Some of the sites 
 also allow you to click on the items you want to buy 
 and then print them off in a handy checklist separated 
 by store name. Get ready for Black Friday and you 
 can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars! (Posted:

 Saving money at amusement parks is possible. Visit 
 Disney World in Florida or Disneyland in California 
 in 2009 on your birthday and you get in FREE! Click 
 here to register your birthday. Get maps and brochures 
 to find out about discounts and freebies. Visit unofficial 
 theme park websites for special tips and trucks. Some 
 examples include amusementpark.com , AllEarsNet and Theme 
 Park Insider . Purchase tickets online instead 
 of at the gate and you will receive a huge discount. 
 Don&apos;t order tickets too early -- if traveling in July 
 or August, order them at the end of June but not any 
 earlier. You can also save money by presenting your 
 AAA, AARP or warehouse-club membership card. Bring 
 your own food and keep a cooler handy. (Posted: 11/12/08) 17. 
 There are many ways to save money while doing your 
 banking. First, reduce the number of checks you bounce 
 per month. It can save you $20-30 per check and could 
 end up saving you hundreds by the end of the year. 
 Reduce your credit card debt by $1,000. It could save 
 you $150-200 per year from the penalty fees. Make 
 your credit card payments online. It will lower your 
 chances of paying a late fee and could save you $30-35 
 per month. Only use ATMs owned by your bank or credit 
 union. Using a ATM from a different bank or credit 
 union can cost as much as $3 per withdrawl, or about 
 $150 per year. Keep these tips in mind when you do 
 your banking. (Posted: 11/5/08) 16. 
 Eat at home more often. Bring your lunch to work at 
 least once or twice a week. It could save you hundreds 
 of dollars per year. Make your morning coffee at home 
 instead of buying it at a coffeeshop. The average 
 price of a drink at Starbucks is close to $5 each. 
 If you get a drink each day of the work week, that&apos;s 
 $25 you&apos;ve spent just on coffee. You can purchase 
 a coffee machine and make it at home for far less 
 cheaper. Also, eat at home more often. If it costs 
 $25 on average to dine at a restaurant, but only $5 
 to eat in, that&apos;s $20 you save each month. Be sure 
 to choose less expensive restaurants if you choose 
 to dine out. (Posted: 10/29/08) 15. 
 Take advantage of perks at grocery stores. When shopping 
 at Hiller&apos;s Markets, bring your own bag and save 5 
 cents off your order. It is good for each bag that 
 you re-use. When shopping at Busch&apos;s, make sure to 
 get your FREE coffee and cookies upon walking it. 
 Studies show that people who go to the grocery store 
 hungry end up buying more. So get your coffee and 
 cookies and you will spend less! When shopping at 
 Joe Randazzo&apos;s, sample fruit and vegetables before 
 buying. Only try one of each item. Not any more than 
 that. Cut out coupons and take them to your grocery 
 store. Some grocery stores will double your coupons 
 or even triple them up to 50 cents. If you have a 
 coupon for 50 cents off an item, it could be worth 
 as much as $1.50 off. (Posted: 10/22/08) 14. 
 Unplug your cell phone charger immediately when your 
 battery is done being charged. It still drains electricity 
 even when the battery is fully charged until it is 
 unplugged. A study shows that 5% of the power used 
 by the charger ends up going to the battery while 
 the other 95% is wasted as it remains plugged in. 
 Another option is to plug it into a power strip then 
 switch it off. Most chargers have a light that indicates 
 if the battery is done or not. However, it remains 
 on anyways. A cell phone charger was recently blamed 
 for a house fire in Delaware. The best idea is to 
 plug it in only when you are home. If you leave the 
 house, anything can happen including a major fire. 
 There are 190 million cell phones in the United States. 
 You can save on your electric bill simply by unplugging 
 your cell phone charger in time. (Posted: 10/15/08) 13. 
 When dining at restaurants, be sure to save your receipt 
 and fill out the survey afterwards by phone or online. 
 Companies actually do care about what you say. Many 
 of them will make changes if you say something was 
 wrong. Workers can get raises if they do a great job 
 or even get fired if they did something wrong. Many 
 restaurants will offer you something free on your 
 next visit in. Burger King will offer you a free Whopper 
 or french fries. White Castle will offer you two free 
 White Castle burgers. Many other restaurants have 
 similar programs. Most times, it will only take about 
 5 - 7 minutes of your time. Some of the questions 
 will give you a choice of 1 to 5 stars and it can 
 be tedious. Just write down the code they will give 
 you at the end of the survey and mark it on your receipt. 
 Bring it in next time and you&apos;ll get free food! (Posted:

 Wash your dishes by hand instead of using a dishwasher. 
 According to the California Energy Commission&apos;s web 
 site, 80 percent of the energy that your dishwasher 
 uses goes to heat the water. If you wash by hand, 
 you are saving lots of money on your electric bill 
 which totals about 346 kilowatts per year. That is 
 about 4% of the average household electricity use. 
 The only down side is that a dishwasher uses less 
 water, it can sanitize dishes better and it saves 
 you time. If you are in a rush, use the dishwasher. 
 If you have time to spare, wash them by hand and it 
 will save you money. Remember not to use too much 
 soap when washing by hand. It is recommended to have 
 one sink full of soapy water and one with clean water 
 for rinsing. If you run the faucet for the entire 
 time that you are cleaning each and every dish, you 
 are going to be paying more in water. Now you can 
 clean your dishes and save money too! (Posted: 10/1/08) 11. 
 Switch to new compact fluorescent light blubs (CFLs) 
 in your house. If every American replaced just one 
 light bulb with a compact fluorescent one, we would 
 saee enough energy for light over 3 million homes 
 for a year and over $600 million in annual energy 
 costs. These new fluorescent bulbs use 75% less energy 
 than standard incandescent bulbs and last up to 10 
 times longer. You will save $30 or more in electricity 
 costs for each new bulb. There are different sizes 
 and shapes of these new bulbs for indoors and outdoors. 
 There are even CFLs designed for three-way lights. 
 You can purchase CFL bulbs at just about any store. 
 They are more costly than standard bulbs but they 
 will save you in the long run. For more info, visit 
 the EnergyStar.gov website. (Posted: 9/24/08) 10. 
 When shopping, buy in bulk not single items. The large 
 quantity items you purchase, the lower the price will 
 be per item. Many retailers indicate the price per 
 unit on their shelf tags. Sam&apos;s Club and Costco are 
 great places to shop. Both stores offer most of their 
 items in large quantities -- therefore you get to 
 save money and make less trips to the store. Examples 
 of items you can buy in large quantities include canned 
 food, candy, paper towel, toilet paper, pop and just 
 about anything. If it comes as a single item, chances 
 are you can get it in bulk. Although warehouse clubs 
 charge a fee to become a member, you are really saving 
 money in the long run. (Posted: 9/17/08) 9. 
 When buying something, check at several stores first. 
 Write down all the prices of what you need at different 
 retailers. Then, buy from th cheapest store. Also, 
 check shopping.com . 
 After typing in the name of an item, the website will 
 show you a list of all the websites that have that 
 item with the prices for each one. It also includes 
 shipping charges. This is good for just about everything 
 -- books, music, electronics, appliances, computer 
 accessories and much more. Just one more way to save 
 money on everyday items. Do not make quick purchases 
 at only one store, it could cost you! (Posted: 9/10/08) 8. 
 Don&apos;t run your air conditioner at your house at nighttime. 
 Open your windows if its cooler outside. It&apos;s cheaper 
 and it will save you on your electric bill. You can 
 also use a ceiling fan or wear lighter clothing. Set 
 your thermostat to 78 degrees or above. You can save 
 20-25 percent off your electric bill by raising it 
 five degrees. Close drapes and blinds during the day. 
 Put up screens that reflect the heat during the day. 
 Just one more way to save money on your electric bill 
 and keep your house cool at the same time. (Posted:

 Greeting cards can cost a fortune these days. Instead 
 of purchasing greeting cards at major retailers or 
 Hallmark card shops, buy them from the dollar store 
 or at Aco Hardware. Those two stores offer greeting 
 cards for 50 cents each or 2 for $1. The savings will 
 add up fast if you have lots of relatives or friends. 
 Why pay $4.99 for a greeting card when you can get 
 one that&apos;s just as nice for only 50 cents. Some discount 
 retailers are also offering greeting cards for 99 
 cents. If you really want to save money, you can send 
 an online greeting card. Be aware because some greeting 
 card websites require you to join and may charge you 
 a monthly fee. Look for the ones that say&quot;free&quot;. 
 (Posted: 8/27/08) 6. 
 Purchase a contract cell phone with the lowest amount 
 of minutes. Then, make calls only when its an emergency. 
 Sign up for unlimited text messages. Instead of calling 
 people, send them text messages throughout the day 
 because they are free. When non-peak hours begin at 
 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., depending on your service, then 
 make calls. Calls during non-peak hours will be free 
 and will not be deducted from your monthly calling 
 period. Cell phones can be expensive. It&apos;s one more 
 way to save money each month. Don&apos;t ever go over your 
 minutes again...send text messages instead. (Posted:

 If you live close to work, take your bike instead 
 of driving. Not only will you be helping the environment, 
 you will get exercise that will help you live longer. 
 Another option is walking to work. Many people are 
 resorting to walking or taking a bike to work with 
 these high gas prices. Lessen your dependence on foreign 
 oil by using one of those two methods of getting to 
 work. Remember to bring a lock for your bike. Also, 
 get lights for the front and rear of your bicycle 
 so that others can see as you ride after dark. It&apos;s 
 one more way to save on gasoline. (Posted: 8/13/08) 4. 
 When going to a fast food restaurant, order everything 
 off the dollar menu. Meals can actually cost $1 or 
 $2 more. If ordering everything separately, the savings 
 add up. You can actually create your own meal by selecting 
 items off the dollar menu. Go to McDonald&apos;s, Burger 
 King, Wendy&apos;s or Taco Bell. Rumors are that McDonald&apos;s 
 may be getting rid of it&apos;s dollar menu before the 
 end of the year. So you order off it while you still 
 can! Some of the items on dollar menus may be healthy 
 for you. McDonald&apos;s features a side salad and a fruit 
 &apos;n yogurt partfair on it&apos;s dollar menu. Burger King 
 also offers a side salad on it&apos;s dollar menu. Finally, 
 Wendy&apos;s offers a side salad and a caesar side said 
 on it&apos;s value menu. (Posted: 8/6/08) 3. 
 When buying textbooks, find out what you need then 
 go to booksprice.com to find the cheapest price. It will give you a listing 
 of all the sites that sell the book you are looking 
 for with the shipping rate included for a total out-the-door 
 price. Don&apos;t order from school bookstores. They can 
 charge you as much as double the price. Order from 
 many different online bookstores as possible. Although 
 Amazon.com is the largest online bookstore, it may 
 not be the cheapest. Also, check abebooks.com , textbookz.com and half.com for more great deals. (Posted: 7/30/08) 2. 
 Before going to a festival or concert, eat at a fast 
 food restaurant. Food at festivals can cost as much 
 as $4 - $8 just for a hot dog or hamburger. Many large 
 events require you to purchase food and beverages 
 at the venue. Most do not allow you to bring in food 
 and beverages from home or outside restaurants. If 
 you eat at a nearby fast food restaurant, you can 
 order from the dollar menu and the savings will add 
 up. Especially if you have a big family. Definitely 
 eat before you go. (Posted: 7/23/08) 1. 
 Don&apos;t use the air conditioning while driving in 
 your car. Open the windows instead if possible. 
 Air conditioning can use as much as 10% more fuel. 
 On city roads and neighborhood streets, just roll 
 the window down. On the highway, use the A/C because 
 having your window down will slow down your car 
 and require more fuel. (Posted: 7/16/08)
