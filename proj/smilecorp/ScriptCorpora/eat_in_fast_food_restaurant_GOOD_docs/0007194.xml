 &quot;There are a lot of fast food restaurants that now offer salads, baked potatoes and other healthy choices instead of French fries.
The reality is that people do not go to fast food restaurants to eat healthy. They go for convenience and taste. Greasy, fried foods taste good, and people in our society love to stuff their faces with huge portions of food that are fast and cheap. The speed in which we eat this toxic food rivals the speed in which we are able to purchase it.&quot;

 &quot;Very little fresh fruit has been available at restaurants, especially fast food restaurants , but now Apple Dippers are becoming the norm.
Fruits today play an integral role in preventative, wellness medicine. We seem to think that we&apos;re only now realizing how important fruits are, but in many cases we&apos;re only now rediscovering lost wisdom. As Hippocrates said, in one of the earliest of all recorded aphorisms, &quot;Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.&quot;
Fruits have inspired countless innovations.&quot;

 &quot;You are reading this right. The fast food restaurants totally disagree with my conclusions and state emphatically that there is no evidence supporting my claims. I disagree with them 100 percent. Let&apos;s look at the facts. McDonald&apos;s says if you eat in their restaurants once a week you are a &quot;heavy user.&quot; People, however, do not frequent just one fast food restaurant. People go to multiple fast food restaurants . I asked people who eat fast food at least three times a week how their health is. Here is what I have found.&quot;

 &quot;Also, avoid fast food restaurants and all junk foods.
 Do not consume sweets such as soda, pastries, pies, cakes, doughnuts, or candy. Omit all forms of refined sugar (including white sugar, brown sugar, and corn sweetener) from the diet. Sugar triggers the release of insulin, which then activates enzymes that promote the passage of fat from the bloodstream into the fat cells.
Q Follow a fasting program once monthly. (See fasting in Part Three.)
Q Spirulina aids in fighting obesity. Take it thirty minutes before meals to decrease your appetite.&quot;

 &quot;I also visited fast food restaurants almost daily. I used to sunburn very easily. In the Midwest, where I grew up, I would get a severe burn in the summer sun in about 30 minutes or less.
Today, I live in a desert, which is closer to the equator and has far more intense sunlight. Thanks to good nutrition, I can go out under the summer sun with not a cloud in the sky, under high-intensity sunlight, and I can go walking or jogging for three hours straight with no shirt on and no sunscreen and I won&apos;t experience a burn. Same skin, different result.
Why is that?&quot;

 &quot;You should never eat brand name food and that you should never eat food from publicly traded corporations or fast food restaurants . This book explains in detail and verifies and backs up evejything I&apos;m saying about how food is produced. It is an absolute must read.
RECOMMENDED BOOK
One of the major causes of all diseases is exposure to toxins. Remember, if you are experiencing any medical symptoms or have any disease or illness, you must ask yourself what is CAUSING your symptoms, your illness, and your disease.&quot;

&quot;In the people that I interviewed who ate in fast food restaurants three or more times a week consistently, ninety percent had heart disease or high risks of heart disease. Ninety-two percent had pre-diabetes or diabetes. Ninety-five percent were overweight. Eighty-five percent had food and/or environmental allergies. Ninety-one percent had sleep problems. Ninety-four percent had depression or mood swings. Ninety-seven percent had constipation. One hundred percent had an acidic body pH, which means, according to Dr. Morter, they are prone to get cancer. The list goes on.&quot;

&quot;Did you know that even the government in reviewing the safety and sanitary regulations at fast food restaurants find violations EVERY SINGLE TIME AN INSPECTION IS DONE! That&apos;s right; every single time a food inspection is done at a fast food or chain restaurant serious health violations are found in sanitation. This means that the food is poisoned. This means the food is not safe to eat, yet we eat it almost every single day. Did you know that health violations occur in the processing plants of virtually every publicly traded corporation making your favorite brand name food?&quot;

 &quot;Despite this, fast food restaurants that serve nutritionally defunct foods are now fixtures in almost every town. We eat out more than ever4 and speed has taken precedence over quality. As we spend more time watching TV, playing video games and using the computer, we are less physically active.
Both diabetes and obesity are merely symptoms of poor health in general. They rarely exist in isolation of other diseases and often forecast deeper, more serious health problems, such as heart disease, cancer and stroke.&quot;

 &quot;The reality is that people do not go to fast food restaurants to eat healthy. They go for convenience and taste. Greasy, fried foods taste good, and people in our society love to stuff their faces with huge portions of food that are fast and cheap. The speed in which we eat this toxic food rivals the speed in which we are able to purchase it. Think about the time you take to sit down and eat a well-prepared meal compared to how long it takes to rifle down a fast food meal. Is it any wonder that acid reflux has exploded into the medical mainstream?&quot;

 &quot;Avoid fast food restaurants as much as possible.
2. Watch portion sizes. If they are too big, share with someone else or simply wrap up the leftovers for another meal.
3. Select broiled, baked, steamed, or grilled menu items over fried.
4. Ask the waiter or waitress about ingredients and preparation methods to make the most informed choice. Often you can have an item prepared as you would like it (e.g. broiled rather than fried).
5. Ask for sauces and dressings on the side, so you can control the amount you use.

 &quot;Consuming the heated oils (packed with harmful trans fats) used by fast food restaurants are an especially quick way to produce gallstones.

11. Avoid &quot;Light&quot; Food Products
Several scientific studies show that eating &quot;light foods&quot; actually encourages appetite and overeating, and does not reduce weight. Before they were introduced into the human food chain, &quot;light foods&quot; were fed to animals that subsequently began to gain weight faster than normal.&quot;

 &quot;Of course, we know this is not the case, otherwise people with the highest energy would be those who eat at fast food restaurants . By simply consuming more calories, we are not guaranteed more energy. Many conventional nutrition books would have us believe that if we expend a certain amount of energy, it can be quantified and replaced. They suggest that by simply adhering to calorie counts, with no consideration of other factors, we can accurately gauge the amount of food we need to consume to maintain low body weight and high energy. But it doesn&apos;t work that way.&quot;

 &quot;One of the world&apos;s most famous fast food restaurants uses commercials that don&apos;t even advertise its specific food products. Rather, the commercials show happy people ?families, children, teenagers ?all standing around acting incredibly happy because they&apos;re chewing on hamburgers and fries.
The message is that if you eat these products, you will be happy and healthy, because all the people who are shown in those ads look energetic and healthy.&quot;

&quot;Many hospitals, for example, contain fast food restaurants , and they serve patients junk foods and foods containing disease-promoting ingredients like hydrogenated oils and simple sugars.
I was recently in a hospital elevator when a worker pushing a cart of food wheeled in beside me. I glanced at the cart and could clearly make out three things: Ice cream (loaded with sugars and saturated milk fats), orange juice drink (highly acidic, refined and high on the glycemic index) and cartons of 2% milk (causes stagnation, asthma, constipation, allergies and more).&quot;

 &quot;Ban fast food restaurants at schools and hospitals
We should also ban junk foods and fast foods at schools and hospitals. I think it&apos;s crazy that some schools have fast food chains right in the cafeteria where children can buy disease-promoting foods for lunch. It is just as crazy that our hospitals, which are supposed to be institutions of health and healing, also serve the same junk foods. There are actually hospitals with McDonald&apos;s restaurants inside the hospital
Were people out of their minds when they allowed these restaurant chains into our schools and hospitals?&quot;

 &quot;Another source of trans fats for some people who frequently eat fast foods is French fries, since some fast food restaurants use these fats for frying.
As some people may eat a large amount of trans fats and others little or none, and as the type of food chosen varies greatly, consumption data has to be used only as a simplified overview of trans fat consumption.&quot;
- Gene A. Spiller, The Trans Fats Dilemma and Natural Palm Oil ( Get the book. )

 &quot;The number of fast food restaurants has exploded; their universal food is French fries. Onions are fried, zucchini is fried, cheese is fried, and ice cream is fried.
Let&apos;s say hypothetically that fat and carbohydrate each explain 50 percent of increased food consumption and weight gain in the population. Fat intake then declines, but increasing carbohydrate consumption more than compensates, leading to an overall increase in calorie intake and rising levels of obesity.&quot;
- Kelly Brownell and Katherine Battle Horgen, Food Fight ( Get the book. )

 &quot;At the same time advertising expenditures on soft drinks are skyrocketing, and fast food restaurants , movie theaters, quick stop convenience marts and other retail establishments that sell soft drinks are upsizing their portions to ridiculous levels:
The largest movie-theater soft drink contains 800 calories if not too diluted with ice. Larger portions can contribute to weight gain unless people compensate with diet and exercise. From an industry standpoint, however, larger portions make good marketing sense. The cost of food is low relative to labor and other factors that add value.&quot;

&quot;Of course, the idea that fried foods could be healthful is rather ridiculous in the first place. fast food restaurants use the same frying oil, over and over again, which multiplies the acrylamide content of fried foods (acrylamides are highly toxic, cancer-promoting chemicals that form when foods are cooked at very high temperatures) while simultaneously introducing dangerous levels of trans fats into these fried foods. These foods can only be accurate characterized as promoters of disease, not as any sort of healthful food.
In the end, of course, the soybean oil pushers are going to lose.&quot;

 &quot;According to the 1998 Teen Eating Study, teenagers eat at fast food restaurants at least twice a weeka habit costing them $13 billion a year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that, every year, the average American consumes more than 120 pounds of sugar, 115 pounds of red meat, 53 gallons of carbonated soft drinks, 16 pounds of ice cream, and nearly 1,100 cups of coffee.
The National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES 1999) says in the past two decades the number of overweight Americans has nearly doubled. &quot;

 &quot;Nearly half of the money they spend on foods goes to the fast food restaurants more than $110 billion a year.
Today more than a billion people worldwide are overweight, of whom at least 300 million are clinically obese, according to the WHO. Most of these people are from the developed counties.59 In the United States obesity is reaching &quot;epidemic proportions,&quot; according to Surgeon General David Satcher. More than 61% of adults and 14% of children are affected by obesity-related diseases, and some 300,000 die each year from health problems caused by obesity.&quot;
