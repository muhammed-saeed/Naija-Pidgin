 I must thank you all for such a positive and knowledgeable Expert in your Employment Law category. She has provided much relief and answers for me in the midst of dealing with a case. I am totally pleased with her customer service and care. Mildred Washington, DC Excellent direction from Socrateaser to help me preserve and pursue my rights as a proud American who has become unemployed in this messed-up economic downfall. Thank you Happy Customer Denver, CO My first experience with Just Answer has been better than I ever thought possible. I had a fairly complex legal question regarding Medicare provider regulations. For a week I had been trying to find an attorney familiar with Medicare but to no avail. I really didn&apos;t expect anyone at Just Answer to know anything about this issue. Yet the attorney who answered my question, Dimitry Alexander Kaplun, Esq., not only answered the question but cited the specific Medicare regulation in question. For six years, I was a Westlaw representative so I&apos;ve worked with hundreds of attorneys. Some attorneys are knowledgable and some aren&apos;t, especially about administrative law. But Mr. Kaplun clearly had an exceptional understanding of the issue and was able to explain it concisely. I would recommend Just Answer to anyone. Great service that lives up to it&apos;s promises! Gary B. Edmond, OK My Expert was fast and seemed to have the answer to my taser question at the tips of her fingers. Communication was excellent. I left feeling confident in her answer. Eric Redwood City, CA I am very pleased with JustAnswer as a place to go for divorce or criminal law knowledge and insight. Michael Wichita, KS PaulMJD helped me with questions I had regarding an urgent legal matter. His answers were excellent. Three H. Houston, TX Anne was extremely helpful. Her information put me in the right direction for action that kept me legal, possible saving me a ton of money in the future. Thank you again, Anne!! Elaine Atlanta, GA

I was an assistant manager at a local fast food restaurant.
       
Customer Question
 Ask your own question now&gt; 
I was an assistant manager at a local fast food restaurant. A couple months ago, I brought attention to my superior about employees that were using narcotics at work (this could&apos;ve been caught on camera if had been pursued). My boss did nothing and the individuals that were doing the narcotics began to verbally abuse other employees. I also brought this to my superior and was told that the verbally abuse individuals needed to &quot;toughen up&quot;. Well, nothing was done. Months later, the same individuals that I had exposed began a rumor about me taking my subordinates to my home and subjecting them to illegal activity. They told my superior. He, in turn, told me that I needed to &quot;cut my ties&quot; with the coworkers that I associate with outside of work. Keep in mind, that I work with my fiance and a few cousins. It would be impossible for me to cut myself off from my family. Well, I quit my job because I found this to be unethical and I have reason to believe that my superior is have sexual relations with one of the individuals I had exposed. My question is this- Should I file a civil suit against my employer for discrimination and/or defamation of character?

Already Tried:
I have filed for unemployments on the grounds that I had to quit due to unethical practices. I have just recently spoke with a friend that is involved in a civil suit for the same reason. I need to know if my previous employers actions were legal and ethical in terms of the law.

Thank you for your question!




In most situations, employees can be terminated for almost any reason or for no reason at all due to at-will employment.

In some circumstances, terminating an employee for complaining about drug Abuse in the workplace could constitute a violation of the public policy exception to at-will employment.

Further, employers must abide by any employment contracts. In some instances, an employer&apos;s policies can be interpreted to constitute implied contracts. In other words, an employer&apos;s policies can potentially create enforceable obligations.

Regrettably, employers may also typically prohibit employees from fraternizing with other coworkers or with subordinantes. However, if an employer is doing so for the purposes of unlawful discrimination, an employee may have a basis for a discrimination charge.

Unlawful discrimination involves age over 40, race, gender, disability, etc. If an employer takes adverse employment action against an employee for reasons such as those, the employee may have a basis for a discrimination charge. However, conduct unrelated to factors like age over 40, race, gender, disability, etc. would not typically have a basis for a discrimination charge.

A successful defamation plaintiff must typically show that:
1. The defendant made a statement of fact to a third party regarding the plaintiff;
2. The statement was not true;
3. The statement harmed the plaintiff.


If an individual can show that someone made statements that meet those elements or that someone repeated statements that meet those elements, the individual may have a basis to sue for defamation. However, only individuals who make such statements are liable. Individuals who take action based on false statemetns are not typically liable for defamation.

Ok, I guess not. So, I will retype it. There no policies that employees are made aware of upon employment. Employees are randomly made aware of attendance policies during employment, but not always. After managing their for about four years and working their for almost five years, it would be hard not to know about such policies for fratenization. I don&apos;t think their are because the general manager and the employers had relations with my subordinates. I was told to stop associating with people that I had known previously upon employment and I was never told when I became a manager that I was not aloud to. This was stated to me on camera. I can also prove that my previous employers had paid individuals that had quit to&quot;keep them quiet&quot;about the general manager&apos;s wrong doings. Does any of this change the situation?
             
Accepted Answer
 







Even if you placed a deposit or have a subscription





Inconsistent enforcement of company policies or simply treating one employee different than others in a particular matter can be helpful evidence to support a discrimination charge when there is otherwise a basis for a claim of unlawful discrimination.

Unfortunately, due to at-will employment, an employer doesn&apos;t really have to have a good reason to terminate an employee. That said, employers can&apos;t engage in unlawful discrimination, violate public policy, or breach a contract (express or implied). Again, in some instances, terminating an employee for complaining about substance abuse may constitute a breach of the public policy exception.
