Picking During Food Prep and Beyond
 
 By carolyn_r on Jan 14, 2011 10:00 AM in Recipes 
 
 By Carolyn Richardson 

With a pick pick here and a pick pick there... How good are mashed potatoes when eaten right off of the serving spoon? Well, if you are serious about watching what you eat, you’re best off eating only the food on your plate. Picking morsels here and there as you cook, serve and clean piles on the extra calories. You might not realize how often you eat before and after you actually sit down for dinner, but by simply setting yourself up to eat only what you serve, you can stay within your calorie budget. The word to remember is consciousness. 

 Preparation Consciousness 

Preparing food when you’re hungry is bound to tempt even the most watchful calorie counter. But, be sure you are not just fidgeting for something in your mouth! Eating while you’re preparing food is not only unsanitary but it can spoil your appetite for dinner. Try chewing a piece of sugarless gum as you prepare your food. This will do two things: it will prevent you from eating or drinking anything without having to consciously remove the gum, and two, it will occupy the extra salivation you will naturally have around smells derived from delicious food. I can hear some of you saying that gum may mess up the taste of your dinner, but drinking a glass of water before you eat to clear the smell and taste of the gum will also prevent you from overeating.  

 Spoon Consciousness 

You have to taste the food, right? But don’t use the colossal spoon you used to mix in the ingredients; rather use a dainty dinner-size spoon. Test once, and move on. Tasting two or more times means the food tastes good enough to eat. 

Post-preparation, spoons lying around with tasty remnants on them scream‘eat me.’ But, if the spoon weren’t there, you wouldn’t hear a thing. After dishing dinner onto your plate, rinse the serving spoon and leave it in the sink or out of sight in the dishwasher. This will make it more time-consuming to get seconds and hopefully, result in second thoughts about getting more food. It will help with clean up as well.

 Clean-up Consciousness 

Most times after dinner is cooked, there are certain foods that need to cool down before you can actually eat them. Use that cool-down time to package up what&apos;s left. For dinner, serve yourself one portion of the meal with twice as many vegetables as lean meat and grains and then package up the rest for lunch or dinner tomorrow. Have the Tupperware and baggies waiting. Into the lunch bag and out of sight.

The point is not to give yourself the option to easily eat more of your delicious dinner. Later, if you are truly hungry, then eat a small snack. In fact, if you&apos;d like, you can reheat and eat more of your delicious dinner.


Your thoughts....

 Do you pick while you cook, serve and clean? How do you put a lid on it?

Well, you do have to taste what you make. When I cook, I usually do it just before eating, so I eat what I make. Or if I cook more than one portion, I do it in time for a meal and eat one portion then and the rest later. I think you should never make something that you won&apos;t eat. Even if you have a family, your family deserves to eat just as healthy as you do.

I agree, you do have to taste it, check the seasonings, adjust, then taste again, etc... but that is somewhat different than just mindless munching. I normally keep a plate of baby carrots and cherry tomatoes that are pre-weighed so I can munch off them while I cook, and I try to be aware of how much I&apos;ve tasted, so to be on the safe side, I&apos;ll round up the weight of my serving to the nearest whole number to compensate for any heavy picking while cooking when I do my food log!

It&apos;s hard to get around that idea of &apos;waste&apos; because when making a dessert I can easily scrape a serving&apos;s worth of batter out of a bowl after I&apos;ve already got whatever it is cooking in the oven. I&apos;ve turned this into kiddo&apos;s reward for helping me cook. She grates, she chops, she whisks, and she&apos;s the one that gets to scrape the bowl and lick the beaters. I allow myself one lick, and that&apos;s it! If I don&apos;t stop there I&apos;ll wind up face first in a chocolate crusted bowl and won&apos;t come out until I&apos;ve lost all my dignity!

I would never eat unbaked dough. It could be dangerous and a health hazard. Plus any cookie I&apos;d make would have no sugar in it.

Well, I commend you! I don&apos;t bake for myself often but I bake for my students all the time for their birthdays and such and I like to stick to traditional methods of baking for them. 

I know a lot of people say you shouldn&apos;t eat raw dough, cookie, cake or otherwise, but we&apos;ve been doing it in our house for generations and never had health issues. We buy organic eggs from local farmers though, so that might have something to do with it.

Where I live organic is rare and very expensive, especially because of the low vages around here. So I just buy what&apos;s in the supermarket. It is local though and because it&apos;s such a small country, it can&apos;t come from a very far away place. But I think the dough is just gross.

If you&apos;re a teacher, maybe you should use healthier ingredients and only tell your students afterwards. Maybe they could see that what is healthy can be good too.

i&apos;ve tried that but it doesn&apos;t work very well with my autistic students. they are very taste and texture oriented and they don&apos;t like anything that is different from what they know. besides, i don&apos;t begrudge a kid a cake on their birthday. they have healthy snacks every day, they can have their one cake and eat it, too!

I agree...I ate raw cookie dough, and bread dough as a kid, it never hurt us in any way. I few bugs in the system is how our bodies learn how to fight off the serious ones. I am hardly ever sick, even being surrounded by 12 different kids in my wife&apos;s daycare.

I sometimes pick during food prep&amp;other times. It&apos;s so hard when your hungry not to pick before the food is cooked. The best tip is to not be ravenous when prepping or you&apos;ll be more likely to pick. I would say to also chew gum, but I don&apos;t because it causes digestive issues! http://fullbodytransformation.wordpress.com/

Well I am a retire chef and I have found out that, when I don&apos;t Taste my food I go-in have complain from costumer if they now what they eat. if they eat jest for swallow food than you don&apos;t need a test you food. and I believe if you worry to get fat you should no cook.The person that cook he should now and he should control it self.

(Love Latini&apos;s post up there!)  For me it wasn&apos;t just the &quot;taste test&quot; - it was a spoonful of mashed potato, or a slice of bacon, or a few chips, or a nice forkful of spaghetti noodles - all things that I already knew were perfectly fine because I&apos;d cooked them a thousand times before. Now that I&apos;m aware of calorie content, it&apos;s much easier to Just Say No. But I do think it&apos;s important to taste something you&apos;re not sure is quite right. One time I made Christmas cookies and forgot a key ingredient and didn&apos;t test dough OR cookie before I made them all. They were absolutely terrible and I had to throw them away. So it makes sense to test, too.

 themcmaster that&apos;s what she said. 
A lot of us here are probably trying out new recipes regularly, trying to find new healthy foods we like, so yeah, we gotta test. And that&apos;s okay!

What has worked for me is to consider the level of &apos;testing&apos; I&apos;m doing when I dish out my food when it&apos;s done, and when I record in CC the # of servings in my recipe.

For example, if I&apos;m baking mini muffins, and I know I ate about 1 muffin&apos;s worth of calories through batter, I log 1 mini muffin in my food log and count 1 extra muffin in the # of servings in the Recipe Generator.

Also, while I&apos;m cooking, I try to tell myself that my dinner will taste so much better if I wait until I&apos;m ready to eat to really go at it. This works well for me if I&apos;m making something I&apos;ve had before. Then my taste buds are happily surprised when I sit down to eat!

I don&apos;t taste when I am cooking. I know the food tastes good, that&apos;s why I&apos;m making it. I don&apos;t fool myself into thinking I have to taste everything to make sure it&apos;s edible. I know I am a good cook, and my family says so over and over again, and the fact that the leftovers never sit in the fridge for long is also an indicator that I&apos;m a good cook.

If I am making something new and I need to make sure I put enough spices in, I&apos;ll use my sense of smell or ask my fiance to try a bite. Or if I absolutely have to taste it I will, Then when I serve my and my fiance&apos;s plate I&apos;ll add a little less to make up for the tasting. That way we can still count our calories without sabotaging ourselves.

I really don&apos;t see why people fool themselves like this. It&apos;s all about willpower I guess. My family always says I have such amazing willpower.

Just as the article states, tasting what you eat is one thing, grazing is another. That&apos;s one of my biggest downfalls, by the time I get home at 5 and start cooking, I&apos;m exhausted and starving. I nibble on individual ingredients, grab two or three croutons from the salad, take a bite of pasta. It really adds up. While the gum didn&apos;t help me, drinking water throughout the process (instead of reaching for a fork I reach for my glass instead) really helps, as well as having one of my roommates in the kitchen as I cook. We talk about our days and keep each other company. If I&apos;m accountable to someone else, I can usually avoid grazing. Now, I just take a tiny taste of the sauce or something to make sure it&apos;s perfect and that&apos;s it. I&apos;ve been saving tons of calories :) Great article!

I like the idea of packing things up right away, before eating. It&apos;s nice to sit down to a meal without having to do the cleanup after it. In a way you could almost convince yourself that it&apos;s as good as going out to eat. Just put your dinner plate in the dishwasher and you&apos;re off!

I don&apos;t think I&apos;m fooling myself. Different spices have different reactions with different foods and there can be subtle changes to taste. I make the same dishes several times and never have them taste exactly the same each time due to the variance of the ingredients. Sometimes fresh produce has a stronger taste, or a lighter taste, depending on the season, and spices and lose potency over time, etc... Again though, there is a difference between tasting and eating by the forkful while cooking!

I always taste-test my food, no matter how much my family says that I&apos;m this great cook. I never graze though... To me that&apos;s just silly. Why graze when you can have a perfectly prepared dinner in just a few minutes instead?

Pack up your food right away!!! 

This has been a huge help for me. I live alone, so when I cooked I would eat a (supersize) serving, and put the rest in the fridge. Then, I wouldn&apos;t want the food to go bad, so I&apos;d eat the rest in one or two sittings- sometimes even later the same night! 

Now when I make a meal, I figure out how many properly-sized portions it makes while I&apos;m cooking. When it&apos;s time to eat, I put one portion on my plate, and immediately put the other 3 or 4 portions into containers and straight into the freezer. This way I have healthy lunches for work, and I&apos;m not tempted to eat more of a meal than I should.

I have lost about 70 pounds in 1.5 years, and while this is only one of the habits I have changed, it is a BIG one. It will save you money too (less eating out at lunch!)

I usually have some raw vegetables out as I am preparing a meal or recipe and if I feel the need to munch I will grab a carrot or celery stick. My favorite is to slice a cucumber, pour a little rice vinegar on top and ground black pepper. If I feel I need to munch because it is dinner time and I am hungry, the cucumbers are quite tastey. It&apos;s like eating your salad before our dinner is ready. :)  And yes I have tried the gum as well and that works too.

Well! it my I come from another planet,I have read all this but I don&apos;t untherstand. Are we talk about taste or eat?

To me test is mean one think, and eat is another.

taste to me is two action, first damp a tea spoon or wood spoon in what ever you do, second empty and smell, finally you taste taste. I cant see how accumulate extra calorie If for taste is fork full of any think or full of spoon or slice bread, that for me is eat and of course is adding calorie.

I rely on my sense of smell a lot when I am cooking. I don&apos;t know if I just have a really sensitive nose, or I&apos;m an intuitive cook. But I can usually tell if there is a good or bad reaction between spices or how the fresh produce will taste compared to the frozen ones by just smelling and looking at them.

The only time I made something that I should have tasted was when I made turkey chili and it was too spicy for my family. At the time I had a cold, so I messed up the doses of the spices I used because I couldn&apos;t smell them as well as I usually do. But it wasn&apos;t a problem, I froze the leftover chili and the next time I made it I took out the spicy chili and added it to the pot then adjusted the extra spices according to the spices I used too much of the first time, and when it came time to eat, it was perfect.

I work in a fast food restaurant and when its dead I am TERRIBLE for picking - also when I finish work or about to go on my break I just cannot seem to help taking a small peice of chicken!

 

Its too easy to make myself an excuse; I&apos;m a manager so I&apos;m ALLOWED to take as much food as I want, and if its quiet the fries need to be tested to make sure they&apos;re still fresh enough to serve..and can&apos;t chew gum whilst working!

 

If anyone has any tips, pleaser message me! I find myself eating about 200 over my limit almost daily due to this and would love to cut it down...am still losing but just a bit slower so would love to cut it out!

This is SO me, at least before I realized what I was doing. Once I started entering everything I ate into the calorie counter, it made me much more conscious of what I was putting in my mouth, and I discovered (and was honest about) this sneaky source of calories for me. What I have found to work for me, in addition to some other things people have posted are these:

1. Tasting is just that while cooking-- tasting --I discovered I was actually taking out a little fruit bowl and &quot;tasting&quot; with several spoons of the stuff. Yikes ! At least 1/2 a serving. So, I was watching Food Network one day and noticed the chefs taste by dipping a small spoon into the pot, tasting and then putting the spoon into a &quot;wash&quot; container. So now, I taste by dipping, and walk straight to the dishwasher with the spoon. If I must taste again, I get a new spoon.

2. I leave out a chopping board with some of the ingredients I am cooking with. For exampe, I may leave a few small pieces of celery or carrot on the board. If I&apos;m tempted to &quot;sneak&quot;, I sneak a raw celery or carrot. Maybe a walnut or two. But then, it&apos;s part of the meal and I do count it with the calorires. It seems to curb that urge to start chomping early.

3. I immediately dish out the correct number of servings into future use containers from the start. I quit thinking of them as &quot;leftovers&quot;. They aren&apos;t &quot;leftover&quot; at all (remember when we were taught to clean our plates? &quot;Leftovers&quot; were to be avoided !). Instead, they are portions I have purposefully made for later. So I separate out 4 portions, leave 3 on the counter to cool, and go eat mine for dinner. When I get finished, the portions are cool, I snap on the lids and presto. Cleanup is a breeze.

I enjoy reading your comments--thanks for all the tips !

Thank you for all the articles. I have learned so much about all the things I am doing wrong, especially the article from the lady in her 50 ties about the weight that kept on kreeping up on her and she realised she had to take control. I thought there is no solution but found out over the last 2 weeks since reading her story and trying to watch what I eat (also to not eat/ taste too much while preparing meals) that it started to make a difference. I have lost 1 kg already and are very motivated to keep it up.

I enjoy reading your comments--thanks for all the tips !

I was cooking a few days ago for the week and I remembered this article. I paid attention to what I was doing and realised that the majority of the stuff I make is actually not tasteable. First I made some chicken. I just cooked it in a bit of olive oil, then put it into a pot with tomato pure and added a whole bunch of seasonings and red wine. So I couldn&apos;t taste it beforehand. Then once it was done, it was done. Let it cool and into the fridge.

Then I made some pastry. As I said, I don&apos;t eat cookie dough. I also made some sauce, but I didn&apos;t taste that either. Once the whole thing was done I did have some, but I was planning on that.

Then how do I cook? I smell, not taste.

 Yes, must taste before serving, all good cooks now this is a must, I suggest, 1 taste each dish, wouldnt want to serve to your family tasting bad. chuckle

I definitely taste the spoon to check my seasoning. Instead of picking at the meal I have an open jar of olives, bread and butter pickles, a sliced apple or grapes for example, to snack on in order to keep away from the meal.

It fits into my 200 calorie snack limit between meals and keeps me going on the time necessary in prepping vegie meals

What a day! I actually love to cook and prepare a meal for myself and eat as I do it!! What!? I may snack on carrots, or pieces of apples with skins on (preferably red), raw veggies like green string beans, or pieces of salad makings (red bell peppers) I do not let myself snack on the grains, or legumes, beans, because they are easy to get too much too quickly. I do use a small soya pudding once in a while with Fiber cereal mixed in to give me a feeling of fullness in the early evening - followed by a raw carrot. I also am watching my sugar intake - so a sprinkle of cinnamon is good in coffee or tea, also I get a TBSP of vinegar on my salad with a little salt and oregano:) aea
