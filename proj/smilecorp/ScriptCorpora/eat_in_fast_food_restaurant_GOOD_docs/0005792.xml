Anyone ever tried Liquid Protein (nodiet.com)?
 Has anyone ever tried this? The DJ on one of our local radio stations keeps talking about it.

Here is what they claim:

What Is The Catch?
No Catch!
First 45 minutes of sleep your body is attempting to burn fat.
Protein is required for the body to burn fat at that time.

During that first 45 minutes of sleep your body is searching
through out your system to find protein to help it... Burn Fat!

Your body does this every night... always has!
Simply, take 1 tbs. of Liquid Protein before bed.
You are then giving the body the protein it is searching for and
Tapping into the natural way your body burns fat with Protein!!

How much do you take?
Simply take 1tbs. before sleep. Liquid form, already mixed for you.
This is the exact amount the body is searching for.

Why Not Just Eat A Steak?
If you ate a steak before bed, your body would use the &quot;steak protein&quot;
to digest and process the intake of the meat, fat and calories.
Instead of burn stored fat.
Liquid Protein contains ~ 0 Calories from fat, 0 Carbohydrate, 0 Fat.

What Results Can I Expect?
Clients lose and average of 2 pant sizes or more in 2 months.
Usually the belly goes down first, thru hips, thighs and backside!
Reshapes the body! Burning fat in the last areas you put it on.

Will I Gain It Back?
Low Calorie/Starvation diets cause the body to lose your fat burner.
That is why in the past you lose 5 lbs. gain back 10lbs!
No diet/starving with Liquid Protein! You dont lose your fat burner!

Is My Local DJ Really Taking This? Skeptical?
Yes! Your local DJ tried it first to show it really does work!
You can email your local DJ at the radio stations website.
He or she will verify how well it works!
Your body burns fat every night when you sleep!
Tap into the natural fat burning process!
Come Join Us On The Slimside!

Is Diet or Exercise Required?
No Diet, No Exercise! No Starving, No Counting Calories,
No Equipment to buy, No Books to Read, and No Meetings!
Easy and it Works!

What If I Do Exercise or Diet?
If you do exercise or lower your carbohydrates intake,
It will accelerate your results.
But it is NOT necessary for results!

Do I Have To Take This Forever?
No, once you get to your desired size you do not have to continue.
Some clients continue taking as nutritional daily supplement.
They like the many &quot;side benefits&quot;.

What Are The Side Benefits?
Most of us are depleted in protein.
Protein benefits the body in many ways
Diabetics notice an improvement in Sugar Levels,
Great for the helping Lower Cholesterol Levels,
Relief of Arthritic Joint Pain, Fibromyalgia.
Improvement is hair, nails and skin!
And you sleep incredibly well!

What Are The Ingredients?
5 grams of Protein. The exact amount the body needs to burn fat

Will It Interfere With Medications?
Here is the good news...
Liquid Protein does NOT interfere with medications!
Creates NO side effects! This is a Food!
That is why Doctors like to recommend it!

I have High Blood Pressure/Diabetes is it safe for me?
Yes! No ingredients to elevate the heart rate or blood pressure!
Many of our clients notice an improvement in their sugar levels!
Protein is very beneficial in helping to lower sugar levels and
reduce sugar craving!

Isnt Protein hard on the Liver?
Yes when taken in abundance like a Protein Meal Replacement Shake.
This is NOT a Protein Shake or a Drink.
You are only taking 1 tablespoon, when your body will most utilize it.

What If I Work 2nd Shift?
When ever it is that you fall asleep,
Take your 1 tablespoon and fall asleep.
It is that easy!

Sorry, babies need to store fat. When you are done nursing,
we can help you get rid of those extra baby pounds!

Can My Teenager Take It?
As long as puberty has started, Liquid Protein is perfectly safe.

diets our society has become accustomed to!
No focus on what you can and cannot eat.

find they no longer need sleep aids!
Remember there are no stimulants!

 Registered User Join Date Jul 2005 Posts 773 This probably isn&apos;t the same exact stuff that the DJ is taking but here are some reviews on a liquid protein mix that has aloe vera juice in it, like the one you posted has. There are quite a few different brands/flavors out there. I think I&apos;m going to try this NOW brand one, I love their products. Reply With Quote 10-16-2008,  02:28 PM #3 SugarMag420

 Registered User Join Date Jul 2005 Posts 773 I&apos;ve been taking this for about a week now and I think it&apos;s actually working. It tastes like warm orange jello liquid, before you add the cold water to make your own jello. I dilute it with about a half cup of water and I find myself actually enjoying the taste, as long as I haven&apos;t brushed my teeth beforehand! Blech! Orange juice and toothpaste DO NOT mix. 

Anyway, my husband asked me this morning if I&apos;ve lost some weight around my tummy (lucky for him he asked nicely) and I actually felt like my pants were a little less snug. I haven&apos;t done anything different except for take this liquid before bed so if I&apos;m losing weight then it&apos;s definitely because of this stuff. It says to wait 90 days to see results too, so if it&apos;s already working then I&apos;m super excited to see what happens in the next 90 days! Reply With Quote 10-29-2008,  11:04 AM #6 SugarMag420

You&apos;ve been taking the Awe-slim or the Nodiet one? Reply With Quote 10-30-2008,  12:51 AM #7 skimble2000

 Registered User Join Date Jul 2005 Posts 773 I&apos;ve been taking the Awe-slim one, which I think has the same ingredients as the Nodiet one if I remember correctly from when I was researching it. I&apos;m not 100% sure on that though. Reply With Quote
