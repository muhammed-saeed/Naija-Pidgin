 Please read this page fully before becoming a Mystery Shopper 
Mystery Shopping, or Secret Shopping as it is sometimes known, regularly changes the life of 1000&apos;s of people, but isn&apos;t suitable for everyone. 

You may already be self-employed, employed, a stay-at-home parent, unemployed or retired. Mystery Shopping is something that bolts on to your existing lifestyle.
 Is Mystery Shopping something new? 
Mystery Shopping started back in 1940 and is now a huge part of the Market Research Industry. It is a service used by the top retail outlets, restaurants, pubs, cinemas, theatres, travel companies, hotels, spas, cruise companies, airlines, amusement parks and leisure organizations.

 &quot;The Mystery Shopping Club is an online support service for the UK spies. Virtually all UK firms now employ mystery shoppers. Just 10 years ago there were only 2,000-3,000 people working as covert researchers in Britain. Now there are nearly 190,000, working either full-time or part-time.&quot; The Independent 
 Why do business and organisations use Mystery Shopping? 
Whenever you visit a major fast food restaurant or well known retail chain, have you ever wondered how they manage to maintain a consistent high level of service no matter how many branches they have and regardless of where they are in the world? It is not left to chance. They all use mystery shoppers to pose as diners or buyers to evaluate the service at ground level. They need to know what customers think about them to help them improve their business. They need as many people as possible to tell them how they are treated and how they feel about their products or services. Mystery Shoppers are the eyes and ears of their businesses.

 &quot;A useful contact is The Mystery Shopping Club. Mystery shopping agencies specialise in all sorts of things such as supermarkets and cinemas. You could get up to 100 for a day&apos;s work with them.&quot; Daily Mirror 
 What are the benefits of becoming a Mystery Shopper? 
 Huge flexibility: The freedom to work when and where you want and as little or as much as you want.

 Extra income: Earn spare cash as and when you need it by getting paid for the ordinary things you may be already doing regularly anyway. You will also be able to claim mileage on many Mystery Shopping trips.

 Free stuff: You&apos;ll be sometimes asked to purchase and keep such products as clothes, spectacles, groceries, petrol and car servicing . You will receive reimbursement for purchases.

 Free nights out: You might for instance receive free cinema tickets to check whether you received good service, the popcorn was fresh and the sound and vision of the film was clear. You might then be able to follow that with a meal out - restaurants provide free meals and drinks for Mystery Diners. On top of this, you will also be paid for your time... yes, really!

 Free nights in: Many fast food restaurants and pizza parlours regularly run Mystery Shopping tests for their home delivery and take-away service.

 Free lunches: After your free evaluation of the local leisure centre, treat yourself to a free lunch and don&apos;t worry about the bill. Yes there is such a thing as a free lunch!

 Childcare convenience: The ability to take children with you on some Mystery Shopping visits. Some fast food restaurants prefer if you take children on the Mystery Shop visit. Free pizzas and burgers taste just as nice as the paid for ones! Amusement park assessments often require children to be taken along. Don&apos;t have children? No problem, just borrow one for the day!

 Work from home: You can also get paid to shop online. Major online companies will pay you to buy things from their website and evaluate the service you receive.

Companies who manufacture products or provide services need to ensure they are meeting the needs of their customers, both in what they are doing now and in planning for the future. Similarly lots of organisations, commercial and non-commercial, need to understand public opinion and how this develops over time. Rather than ask their customers directly it is often more credible and effective to use a specialist market research agency to ask the questions. 

These agencies need to be able to consult members of the public to probe their attitudes, opinions and feelings on a whole range of issues. Sometimes they need to talk to a cross section of the public as a whole, whilst at other times they need to focus on specific groups, e.g. those who use a particular product regularly. To make the outcome of the research valuable to their clients, they need to select a range of people to take part who genuinely reflect the target group, showing the normal diversity expected within that group - e.g. a range of ages or ethnicity.

You&apos;ll also discover how to get discounts and cashback from over 1000 online UK shops including Currys, Tesco, Boots, Littlewoods, Prudential and more. You will receive a 5 welcome bonus on your free sign up.
