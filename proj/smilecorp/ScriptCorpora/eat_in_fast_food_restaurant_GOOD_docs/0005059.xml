 Worst fast food place i&apos;ve been to in awhile. WAY overpriced and when my food finally came it wasn&apos;t worth eating. It was undercooked and overall disgusting. Tried to have my order remade but the general manager smelled like booze so i just left the establishment then and there. Really shows how the owner cares for his customers. Will never go back to Robert&apos;s Ripoff Custard again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! …

 Pretentious Waste of Time. Its a fast food restaurant, plain and simple. The decor is nice but it is only there to distract you from the absurdly overblown prices. Prepare to pay four times as much for the same burger you would get at a Burger king, wait an extremely long time (ten minutes minimum for a cheeseburger) and still get treated like a nuisance by the staff.

The custard is exquisitely awful. Whoever came up with their flavors must believe that sugar can be used as a substitute for flavoring. Everything tastes like raw sugar packed in a glass.

In the end its another junky burger shack pretending to be something it isn&apos;t... a quality restaurant. …

 Not the same place it once was!!!. This was a place I actually enjoyed in the past, but no more! I was there about 2 weeks ago. Only ordered 3 burgers. There were no other people waiting for food. The service was slow and the workers ghetto! I waited almost 20 minutes for my burgers that tasted disgusting and were burnt. All the while sitting there with my kid and listening to these people&apos;s sex lifes from behind the glass.

Word to the wise... stick with Kopps! …

 LOVE THIS PLACE!. LOVE THAT PLACE! I&apos;ve ordered food there for many years and have never had a complaint about their food. Yes, sometimes they can get busy and the wait times could be a little long, but HELLO that&apos;s because the food and custard is so damn great. Try it for yourself and see what i mean. Some people are never satisfied and would find something wrong wherever they go as if they are getting paid for it. A word rom the wiser, check you bag for missing items before you leave the place. Duhhh... …

 Large delicious burgers made to order, good prices and convenient location.. Great little place for a tasty and well-priced dinner with the family. The custard is great and we love the gigantic burgers and other sandwiches. There are good options for the younger kids, too, and they&apos;ve added more types of sandwiches in recent years, like fish and chicken, everything made to order with various toppings.. This being said, I agree with some others who say to avoid it during the dinner rush, especially on weekend nights, unless you are prepared to wait and the weather is nice outside. You can eat outside on limited shady seating, too. If you get one inattentive cashier, just remember, they&apos;re kids. We haven&apos;t had any bad service and we do like the food and the prices. The malts are my personal favorite. I&apos;m giving Robert&apos;s four stars only because it is small inside and there is a wait time with limited seating during busy times. …

 Downhill turn for Roberts. I&apos;m sorry to say that I will not be returning to Roberts anytime in the future. Last night&apos;s visit was very disappointing for me and my family beginning with the lack of acknowledging me as a customer. While placing my order, which was quite sizable, approximately $40.00, the order taker seemed more concerned with ongoing conversations between the staff. I finally received my order after a 1/2 hour wait, which I understood because it was fairly busy. Upon returning home and unpacking our order, I discovered 2 items missing from my order (items were also missing on my last 2 visits) that totaled $7.00. In addition, enough mayonaisse was slathered on one sandwich that would have covered 2 sandwiches, the fries were overcooked and the buns were grilled too long and were dried out. Upon calling to register the complaint (three calls were made), the calls went unanswered. Too bad they missed the opportunity at retaining me as a customer. …

 Good food and custard.. Robert&apos;s has been around a long time - I&apos;ve enjoyed it for over 15 years, previously as a Kopp&apos;s. The food is really good and moderately priced. Burgers and other sandwiches are huge. Custard is delicious. Some say the &apos;hood has gotten sketchy, but I feel safe there no matter the afternoon or night... never mind the plexiglass windows and video monitoring. The only drawback to the place is that there really is no where nice to sit. There are limited benches in the place itself, and then the benches in the parking lot are all placed on the perimeter - some next to a very busy street. The parking lot is trashed and the landscaping is minimal. If they would make one investment in the place I&apos;d say it desperately needs a new parking lot and aesthetic outdoor seating. No matter the parking lot, etc, I&apos;ll always go there for some good grub at least once in a while. I just get it to go... :) …

 Best burgers anywhere!!. Roberts used to be a Kopps Frozen Custard long ago, which is the midwest In&apos;n Out. I live about 4 blocks or so away from this place and I&apos;ve been eating there since I was 3. These burgers are the classic 1950&apos;s burger joint, in which you can also include a malt. The neighborhood has gotten a little sketchy in the last few years, but Roberts still maintains a northside Milwaukee landmark, and hopefully will stay that way. The food they serve is not your&quot;Subway Fresh Value Meal&quot;, nor is it&quot;carb consious&quot;. If you want an old fashioned American non processed assembly line burger, then brother/sister, this is your calling. Start with a jumbo single cheeseburger, doubles are for veterans such as me. Bon apetit&apos; …

 Nice place to go.. I used to go to Robert&apos;s all the time as a little kid. My friends and I would walk up there almost everyday in summer just to get some really good custard. Back then it was a lot nicer in there, but over time it got a little trashy. And the prices have risen over the years but not too terribly. The first time I had a burger there I was in awe of how big it was. We went outside and there were tons of bees and I had only taken one bite and a bee landed on it and I threw away my entire burger. I never did that again however, since those burgers are amazing. Whenever I&apos;m in that area I always contemplate getting something, but its usually quite crowded. Especially on the weekends in summer.

Overall, I love this place. Most of my childhood memories were from there and it makes me wish I could go back to those times again. …
