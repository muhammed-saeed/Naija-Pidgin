The small town of Pooler is on the east coast of Georgia, less than 10 miles from Savannah and about 20 miles from the Atlantic. Interstate 95 runs north and south through the state. At the Pooler exit, or within a mile, travelers can choose from a number of chain or independent restaurants.
 
Breakfast

If you&apos;re looking for breakfast, two restaurants are on the east side of the interstate. The Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (crackerbarrel.com) is a family-friendly restaurant that serves traditional breakfast meals, with eggs, meats, potatoes and toast. Diners can order pancakes, homemade corn muffins and biscuits with-or-without sausage gravy as well. For lighter fare, consider cereal, yogurt or fruit. Breakfast sandwiches are available and there is a kid&apos;s menu. The cozy ambiance comes from a massive stone fireplace and antiques and memorabilia on the walls. Waffle House (wafflehouse.com) restaurants have been serving breakfast since 1955. The all-American, coffee-shop atmosphere comes from the booths with wood tables, window blinds and unassuming interior. Food favorites include the buttermilk waffles with apple cinnamon oats, chocolate chips, pecans, blueberries or strawberries. Wraps, omelets and Texas biscuits with gravy are also popular morning menu items.
 
Grab and Go

If you need to grab a quick bite, you can find a number of fast-food hamburger, sandwich, chicken and Mexican fast-food choices. Larry&apos;s Giant Subs (larryssubs.com) and Krystal (krystal.com) are both on the east side of the I-95 exit, and the atmosphere of both eateries is that of a fast-food restaurant. Larry&apos;s offers hot or cold subs, New York deli sandwiches, Italian hoagies, Philly cheesesteaks and salads for lunch or dinner. Larry&apos;s offers a kid&apos;s menu with a hamburger and corn dog. Krystal is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and specializes in hamburger sliders, chicken sandwiches and hot dogs. Sides, desserts and a kid&apos;s menu are available.
 
Pizza

Two casual restaurants located on the west side of the interstate serve pizza. Lovezzola&apos;s Pizza (lovezzolas.com) also serves stromboli, pasta, subs, salads and appetizers. You can build-your-own or order a combination pizza. If you&apos;re dining in, you can order beer and wine; take-out and catering are available. The restaurant is a modern, yet homey, sit-down eatery that is family-owned-and-operated. Little Italy Pizza (lipspizza.com) has been family-owned and operated since 2001. The family operates the eatery out of a building that was originally a house. The interior has tile floors, wooden tables and walls hand-painted with Italian motifs. The restaurants offers specialty pizza as well as calzones, stromboli, baked and regular pastas, subs, salads and starters. Wings are one of the house favorites; eight sauces are available. Little Italy delivers, caters and offers take-out.
 
Barbecue Steak and Buffet

If you want steak as well as a buffet, the Western Sizzlin (western-sizzlin.com) is on the west side of the I-95 exit. The company opened its first restaurant in Augusta, Georgia in 1962, with grilled steaks as a specialty. The house signature meats include rib-eyes, T-bones and sirloins. Other plated entrees include chicken and seafood. The buffet offers all-you-can eat, with entrees, pastas, salads, sides and desserts. No alcohol is served at this eatery, which is housed in a contemporary building with a modern interior.
