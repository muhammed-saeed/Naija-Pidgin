 June 13, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Too expensive, but tasty. by Spoonie ( 22 reviews ) Eaten here twice now and found them incredibly expensive for a fast food joint. Their veggie burger was sloppy and messy, but their fries were pretty good. The regular cheese burger seemed like your standard frozen burger fare, nothing special. Also tried their mini donuts which were pretty good, but still a little too pricey. The interior of the restaurant seems clean, but the service was mediocre. May 5, 2012 Likes it Good burger and shake. by Chefassassin ( 37 reviews ) I got a massive burger, and a shake. They were good. I did not need a side. reasonable price considering there was almost a pound of beef on my plate. May 22, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Sean ( 17 reviews ) This location isnt as good as the one i used to eat at all the time in calgary. $28 for 2 burgers, 2 shakes, 1 fries. Its still the best burger in town. July 7, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Anna ( 6 reviews ) I was sooo looking forward to trying this place. Kept walking past the&quot;coming soon&quot;sign. So disappointed when it opened. What kind of meat is that?! Bland! Gave it another try, still BLAND!! March 31, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Average Food, Over Priced by Shansey ( 14 reviews ) I have to say that this place did not live up to the hype its received around town. I thought the food was pretty boring and overpriced. Essentially a fast food place $35 for two burgers, two fires and pop was a bit much. I am glad we tried it but not being a burger junkie I can honestly say that I won&apos;t be going back. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful January 15, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it by burgerfreak ( 45 reviews ) somehow fatburger has managed to cause a bunch of hype in town . and found a way to charge 15 bucks or more for an extremely generic burger, fries and drink combo... the scam is they dont have combos..you pay for everything seperately which adds up quick... wasnt terrible but nothing exciting...I actually enjoy the whitespot burgers on the ferries more, and I thought those were expensive! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful March 31, 2012 Burger wars. by sleepingbag ( 12 reviews ) I went to Fatburger a few weeks ago. The burger was good. A regular fast food burger. I&apos;d say like Red Robin but a bit smaller. But the ordering process: weird. Actually, what the heck. I get it. I really do. In fact, I appreciate it. But the only time order call-back is amazing is when the people working there do it out of necessity, not to put on this weird song and dance to the public. The point is to make you feel like you&apos;re in this 50s American diner. Malted milkshakes, crinkle fries, and all that stuff. I&apos;m sorry, I just don&apos;t get that feeling when I hear,&quot;double-cheeseburger&quot;being yelled out by a group of people who really sound like they don&apos;t want to be yelling out,&quot;double-cheeseburger.&quot; If you&apos;re going to do that at least put a 17-year-old kid at the counter and make him smile big. Throw in some fresh-faced girls in medium length skirts to deliver the food to the tables. A ribbon in their hair? Why not.

Now I&apos;m smiling instead of awkwardly standing at the mimicked McDonald&apos;s counter waiting for the endless stream of order regurgitation to end. The burgers here aren&apos;t cheap and the tipping option when paying with credit/debit is kind of tacky. It&apos;s like, I already dropped $14 on a fast food meal, I don&apos;t really feel like tipping when I can literally walk across the street and buy 2 Whopper&apos;s for $6. And I&apos;m a tipper, baby. 2 out of 3 found this review helpful April 29, 2012 Likes it Way better than BK&amp;McDonalds by LegB4Wicket ( 5 reviews ) Philly Cheese Steak Combo -
I&apos;ve been dining at Fatburger since they opened in the new year and have always been happy with my food and experience at the restaurant. Yes it is is a little more pricey than other fast food burger joints, but I find the quality is much better and I like the fact they start cooking your food once you order it. It&apos;s not pre-cooked. I don&apos;t mind waiting for five minutes of so for my meal to be delivered to my table, and normally with a smile. If you&apos;re in a hurry and don&apos;t mind sharing your dining experience with Victoria&apos;s bums and drug addicts, then by all means eat at McDonalds or the Burger King. I like a clean restaurant with good food. I don&apos;t mind paying two to three dollars extra for this. December 22, 2011 Likes it Decent burgers with lots of options by Mile Zero ( 75 reviews ) Fatburger newbie here. Very much enjoyed my burger, though I&apos;m not a fan of the cheap shredded iceberg lettuce. The regular burger with standard toppers was quite filling... I can&apos;t even imagine trying the double burger or the king-size. Yikes! Really liked the wide range of topping options though. Onion rings were terrible -- the batter was bland and had a baked-on texture, but they were definitely deep-fried considering all the oil pooled in the container. Next time I&apos;ll get the fries. Very friendly and efficient service. It&apos;s a small space so there&apos;s not a lot of seating, but staff are quick to clear&amp;wipe tables as soon as someone leaves. Fatburger is fast food. It&apos;s nowhere near as tasty as Bin4, but it&apos;s a definite step up from McD&apos;s / Burger King, faster than Jackalope, and offers many more food options than Big Wheel. It&apos;s great to finally be spoiled for burger choices here in Vic. :-) 2 out of 3 found this review helpful January 10, 2012 Likes it Chewing the fat by Glorified Glutton ( 87 reviews ) I&apos;ve been to Fatburgers in Los Angeles, Nevada and Vancouver and the one in Victoria is exactly what I&apos;ve come to expect from them. A cut above standard fast food fare and a notch below the new wave of &apos;gourmet&apos; burger joints opening up everywhere. Burgers are tasty, fries are great, love the atmosphere (seats in the front window have your own little flat screen so I could downtown people-watch and watch the World Juniors hockey on my lunch break simultaneously!). Also even though many people hate it or are embarrassed, I like their little schtick of having the kitchen staff echo your order. If that doesn&apos;t make you smile you need to loosen your collar a bit! All-in-all if you&apos;re in the market for a quick tasty burger, want friendly service and to catch some sports highlights on your lunchbreak, I definitely recommend Fatburger. Actually now that I think of it, it&apos;s kind of sad in a way that I had a better burger there than I did at Bin 4 and Big Wheel, both of which showed so much promise. How can a chain with a name like &apos;Fatburger&apos; be better than local, gourmet burgers!? Head shake of shame. 2 out of 4 found this review helpful March 3, 2012 Good burgers, meh fries by chas_m ( 5 reviews ) So Fatburger has been open for a while now and finally we thought we&apos;d give it a try. It&apos;s a&quot;slighty upscale&quot;burger place, not&quot;gourmet&quot;burger. The Victoria Fatburger has comfy seating, decor and music, and the food is comfortable too. The meat is fairly nondescript but fresh, and the fries are flour-coated which makes them great with ketchup but bleah on their own, which I don&apos;t prefer. The burger was perfectly fine and the two of us split a combo and a separate (California) burger for $21 and came out full. The mini-donuts were nice (caramel sauce kinda thin) and I&apos;m told the milkshakes are good. So, kinda of a diner-type burger joint (chicken sandwiches are also available) that goes a little beyond fast-food by offering beer and margaritas and being unapologetic about their unhealthiness. :) If you and a small group are looking for a nice place to eat junk food, you might like Fatburger. I suggest the onion rings rather than the fries, but it&apos;s all basic, decent, affordable diner food. December 23, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Meh... by michael_chu ( 4 reviews ) As expected, I&apos;ve had a Fatburger in Vancouver a couple years ago and wasn&apos;t impressed but I thought I&apos;d give them another shot. Same result, nothing special at all. I would gladly rank Wendy&apos;s, DQ and McDicks over them for fastfood burgers. Any of Victoria&apos;s gourmet burger joints will slay them without even having to try. Right now my combo of choice would be a Big Wheel burger with Fatburger fries and gravy :) or KFC fries since they both use a floured frie which turn out crispy. 3 out of 4 found this review helpful January 2, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by ChkinBrgerNen ( 50 reviews ) Solid spot !!!!! Not the cheapest but u get what u pay for here. I don&apos;t like the location as parking is tough to find. I wish this was in cook street village then I would be there once a week February 12, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by AdamH ( 13 reviews ) I think they are giving you exactly what you pay for. Its not entry level. It&apos;s not gourmet. It&apos;s filling a gap in between. I wasn&apos;t excited but wasn&apos;t disappointed either. I will go back if I want a quick burger downtown but probably won&apos;t be seeking it out as a go to place. December 25, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Owenaboski ( 2 reviews ) First Impressions: Service and new staff, excellent. Food. We had 2 FatBurger originals and I to be very honest and not impressed. Meat was tasteless. Very very plain and boring. I like burgers, and eat out a lot but will not return until I hear that they have made the&quot;Burger&quot;better. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful December 23, 2011 Sigh by Foodie ( 9 reviews ) great another american based fast food chain dominating the 1000. Block of Douglas St. burger kng, McDonalds, Phat Burger...I guess Arby&apos;s will be the next arriva or perhaps a popeys chicken. I for one would prefer to spend my money locally. 3 out of 6 found this review helpful March 7, 2012 Mobile review by nomnomnom ( 3 reviews ) Way better than Big Wheel. Burg was really tasty, Caesar salad was awesome surprisingly (I know, who orders a salad at Fatburger right? Read on). I like that you can pick and choose your toppings and they have a wide menu. I have a big appetite and I couldn&apos;t finish my fries, not even close. I obviously wouldn&apos;t eat here all the time because you&apos;d have a heart attack, but it&apos;s great hangover food. Get a salad maybe; portions are huge. December 26, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Sabisabi ( 3 reviews ) Patty was juicy and fresh and meat hadn&apos;t been frozen. A bit expensive but the quality is in between Burger King and The Pink Bicycle so it&apos;s fairly appropriate. Also they bring the food to your table after you order at the counter. We had the mushroom Swiss burger with fries which were hot and crispy. The chocolate shake was pretty decent too. Fairly nice atmosphere for a fast food place with good seating options and multiple TVs. Servers were friendly. Not a bad choice but don&apos;t expect too much - it&apos;s not exactly gourmet. 1 out of 2 found this review helpful January 10, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Sean ( 3 reviews ) Garbage! Mc dicks is better and at 75% less! Save your money! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful January 1, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by BigBadger ( 11 reviews ) It was fast, inexpensive, friendly, good music but not too loud. The burgers we ate were very tasty. NOT doughy or dry as others wrote. Maybe we got them on a good day? We&apos;ll return.
