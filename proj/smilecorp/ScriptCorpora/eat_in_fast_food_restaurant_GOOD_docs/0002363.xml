 You know you need to eat breakfast. Here’s some healthy quick breakfast ideas to get you started. Be creative, remember you can eat anything for breakfast.

Breakfast is just simply the first meal of the day. There’s no iron-clad rule that says you have to eat so called“Breakfast Foods.”

Some people like fish, tuna, pork chops, soup etc first thing in the morning. The main key to remember is to Eat What You Like.

We’ve listed several breakfast ideas on this page. Be creative and I’m sure you’ll think of several more!

 Grab and Go Breakfast Ideas: 

* Fresh Fruit

* Whole Grain Muffin
* Trail Mix of nuts, dried fruits, pretzel, crackers and dry cereal

* Granola Bar
* String Cheese and a piece of fruit
* String Cheese with some whole wheat crackers
* Hard boiled eggs
* 2 ounces cubed cheddar cheese, ¼ cup nuts and an apple
* Whole wheat crackers with sliced cheese and ham

Remember to read labels on prepackaged muffins, cereal bars etc. They are not all created equal. Look for items that are low in fat and sugar, high in fiber and protein.

Some popular breakfast items are loaded with sugar and will not give you the nutrition you need.

When you are brainstorming your own breakfast ideas, be sure to keep nutrition in mind. And when you’re shopping–be sure to read labels.

You have GOT to be KIDDING with the“best”breakfast choices! That teensy Arby’s sausage biscuit is a whopping 390 calories on this list and on another site it is 475 calories! And I have a whole bunch of 99 cent coupons left for this Arby’s heart attack maker.

And McDs sausage burrito is not even on your list. It’s a paltry 300 calories and tastes fantastic to this old Nebraska farm boy!

So my advice to myself is to high-tale it to McDs for their big old sausage burrito and a cup of coffee after having plain instant oatmeal at home at 50 calories.

Oy! I should live so long already!
