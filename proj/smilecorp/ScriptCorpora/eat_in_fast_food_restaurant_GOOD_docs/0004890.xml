LEGOS! LEGOS! LEGOS!
We will be listing bulk lots of Legos, with new items added often, so please check back. All items are BRAND NEW and have only been handled while sorting into lots, unless noted below in bold red type. These come from a Smoke Free Home, so these are perfect for your little ones...or older ones! We will also be listing some custom built Legos every now and then, so check some of these out!
Auction Item: 1 Custom Made Building as seen in photos.
This item is a custom built Bowling Alley and Video Game Arcade. This piece has no instructions and was custom built as I went. I lost count of legos, but rest assured, it is built with many many legos ( my guess is well over 700 ) , including a tiled interior. T are 5 bowling lanes with custom &quot;blacklight Pins&quot;. A recent stop to our local &quot; Alley Cats&quot; bowling Center gave inspiration to this model. We all thought this would be a cool lego project and the imagination of the boys went wild! It includes the 5 lanes with ball returns, seats for all lanes, a wet bar area with tray of drinks ready to be served, and a row of custom arcade ( video ) games! T is a cash register at the front and and a garbage can at the back. The roof includes a custom air handling unit complete with piping and disconnect. Also includes a fan for over the wet bar area!
This all sits on a 32x32 count green plate that measures 10 inches by 10 inches. I apologize t is no room for any sidewalks or grass as the building goes all the way to the edge. This is a large model in order to fit the five lanes and row of games. I have my minifig modeling his best 5 step throw down the lane to pick up his spare. ( Please note that no mini-figs come with the building ). This comes with everything you see, except my minifig. The roof comes off as seen for easy access to the full interior. All items are set for the height of any mini-fig.
This will be wrapped up carefully and will be sent as seen. No assembly will be required except for the roof being placed on and the loose items being put back in place. Comes complete with 20 custom neon pins.
All Legos were brand new legos ( all Glass is pristine w/out any scratches ) or gently used legos. No marring or large scratches. Any scratches on the gently used ones are mainly from cleaning and sorting before assembly.
Item will be wrapped carefully and placed in box that is surrounded by styro peanuts. I will ship carefully as I took some time to build this and I surely dont want it destroyed in transit to its new home.
Shipping will be $20. for actual shipping and supplies to pack.
Item available to US Lower 48 at above shipping rates. If outside that area, please email first. I have no problem shipping outside that area as we have been doing that successfully for over 10 years.
