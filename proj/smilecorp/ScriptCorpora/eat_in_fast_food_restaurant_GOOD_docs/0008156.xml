Tips for Pig-N-Chik Bbq

 Could not taste smoke flavor. I could NOT taste the smoke flavor in the meat. My husband said he could smell it on his fingers. But he could not taste it as well. The meat was tender but I wondered if they cooked it in an oven and the smoker was just for show.

This BBQ place is small, clean, service was good. The atmosphere reminds you of eating in something like a cross between a regular fast food restaurant and Zaxbys. The potato salad was tasteless. The Brunswick stew was OK and the Baked Beans were OK... but they were not BBQ baked beans. …

 Best BBQ in Atlanta !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This place is a little hard to find in a shopping center on Roswell rd , But worth the hunt. I Always have a great experience here. Most friendly and helpful staff. Don&apos;t think someother reviewer has really been here. These people are out of their way helpful to All the customers.

I must say Pig-N-Chik is the best BBQ in town , just like the food critics from the AJC said time after time.

The pork, beef, chicken and ribs are slapp your momma good. Stew is the best I have ever had.

$1.50 Pabst on draught...Love It !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Caution....once you try it the others will never measure up. I&apos;m Spoiled.

Thanks PNC …

 For the price, I expected a whole lot more. I heard rave reviews about Pig n Chik, so I was excited to try out the place. I wasn&apos;t completely disappointed, but I just expected so much more for my money. He ordered a pork sandwich with a side of hush puppies, I ordered a small pork platter with two sides, and we both ordered sodas - totaling just over $17. They gave us two cans of soda and two cups full of ice. It seemed wasteful to offer both the can and a cup - why not just get a fountain dispenser?

Service was fast - a server brought our food after we ordered at the counter. The potato salad was excellent, broccoli was broccoli (it&apos;s pretty hard to mess that up), but the pork was cold and had some gristle to it. They also threw a slice of bread on the plate - not toasted or anything. The only reason I can think of is in case anyone wanted to make a half-sandwich, but if I wanted a sandwich, I would have ordered one. No butter or anything for the bread, so it just kind of sits there.

I guess I was expecting swoonworthy BBQ, but it was very, very average. To be honest, I thought it was comparable to Smokey Bones. …

 Mediocre food with some RUDE folk !!!. I went there with my girlfriend and saw the manager/whatever practically throw out a family of about 10 people (including several children). These guys were spending nearly $100 and all these twerp could worry about was clocking out for the night.

The poor guy (father) called in advance too and the manager took his order but when he got there with his wife and kids, the idiot manager who was behind the counter told him that his family and him wouldn&apos;t be able to sit and eat because when he gets ready to close, they had to get out - but it was the *way* he said it.

I don&apos;t care how good the food is (mind you, only the sauce is good), if this is how you treat some folks trying to sit down and have a family dinner and maybe catch a game on TV, then you don&apos;t deserve to serve food.

To summarize - mediocre food (only the sauce is good) but TERRIBLE service when that guy with the baseball cap is there ! …
