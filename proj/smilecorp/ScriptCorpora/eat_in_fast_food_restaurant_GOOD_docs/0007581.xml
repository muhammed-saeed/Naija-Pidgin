Have to get a whole chicken white meat only (4 fresh juicy tasty breasts) with yellow rice and beans, and of course the delicious hot sauce and free onion toppings from the condiment bar, and every time i order it i feel im getting away with highway robbery. This meal comes out to around 14 bucks and is probably price for price the best meal money can buy, especially if your craving spanish food. The boneless chicken breast is also delicious. The plantains are good but pretty standard. The yellow rice isnt great but its more than good enough to get the job done.
Quick service, if you go around dinner time the line is long but worth it, i wish theyd turn off the soccer though when theres an NBA game on. Here and la brasa have to be the best quick cheap spanish spots this side of cuba.
Ive never had any beef or fish meals from here, and im not brave enough to try the desserts.
in a perfect world this place would have boiled yuca to complete the dinner.
Ive been to other locations in Fort Pierce, boca, and sample road and theyre all great

This fast food-esque restaurant serves very good Peruvian food.  Menu is pretty easy, with pictures to help out folks like myself, who are not wholly familiar with this delicious cuisine.

I ordered  chicken, with rice, and beans and side of soup.  The food was tasty and the portions are rather large.  Make sure to stop by the condiment bar which has some spicy options to kick your meal up a notch.

The interior reminds me of a McDonald&apos;s or Taco Bell, but who cares if they are serving delicious food at an affordable price?

Went to this place thinking it was Cuban food, or perhaps similar to Pollo Tropical.  I was both surprised and impressed upon eating.

The La Granja restaurants are Peruvian, and a small chain here in South Florida.  You get massive quantities of food, and it is very tasty.

The best part, however, is the sauces.  There are four different salsas at the salsa bar, and then a couple different sauces in ketchup tubes on the tables, or near the cash register. Mostly, I just like to try them all, since they&apos;re so good.  I think the green is my favorite in the tube.  Of the salsas, the orange-y spicy one is the best.  But you gotta like the heat to take it.

The dining room is small and the place tends to fill up.  I&apos;ve never had to wait for a table, but have had to bus the trash of the people that sat there before me.

I normally think I&apos;m too cool for chains, but this is actually really cheap, delicious food. Everyone in the house is usually happy with the steak and parilla chicken meals and the fish is just plain fried fish covered with onions and tomatoes. Like the other review said, they have good sauces, but they have an onion bar. They have like 4-6 kinds of different onions to put on your meals in the middle of the restaurant.

The very best part? There&apos;s another La Granja within a few miles of this restaurant on 441 that is always uncomfortably packed (it takes forever to get the food) and it serves the same menu. The parking at this one is usually tight during dinner rushes, but you can always find a space in the parking lot for the shopping center next door.

I spent a lot of my senior year in high school at this joint. I&apos;m very impressed. Very cheap food, very filling, and very good. Their pico de gallo bar is great, and the sauces add a nice kick to your meals.

Get the steak or the chicken breast for your first time - although the 1/4 chicken makes for a good lunch time meal. I like the plaintains over the fries, although the fries are really good too!

When I&apos;m in NorCal, I often have dreams about this place.

I visited La Granja this weekend. A friend of mine and I felt like having some peruvian chicken. I have been to the one in Kendall, but had never been to this particular location. Anyways, the place was packed!. They serve everything from Rotiserie chicken, to lomo saltado, ceviche, papa a la huancaina, etc. The price for a quarter chicken, with rice, beans, fries and an inca kola was around 6 bucks. Not bad at all, and they serve a lottt! I was so full I couldn&apos;t even finish it. This place is sure growing, they seem to have a lot of other locations around south florida.

This is the BEST spanish-ish food around. I live for the steak. Tastiest piece of steak around and for a great price also! the rice and plantains are not too miss also. Make sure to grab some of the sauces with the onions in it.. you might die of heartburn after but it TOTALLY worth it!
