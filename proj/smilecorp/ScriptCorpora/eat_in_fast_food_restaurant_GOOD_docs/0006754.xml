You can get to know him even better if you take one of his cooking classes, one of which is scheduled to take place at Canyon Ranch April 28. Others will follow once or twice a month.

And because we&apos;re doing things all Canyon Ranch-style here, you should know the nutritional value of this app per serving: 96 calories, 15 grams carbs, 2 grams protein, 5 grams fat, 0 cholesterol, 387 milligrams sodium, 4 grams fiber, and 21 milligrams calcium.
