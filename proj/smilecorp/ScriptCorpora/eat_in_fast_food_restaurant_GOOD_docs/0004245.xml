 Shame on You
 By Gary Pearlman


 

 
 To educate a person in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society
 Theodore Roosevelt 1858 -1919
 
 Update February 2008
 
 McDonalds overnighted us $15 worth of coupons with an apology. They still do not answer their phone at any Tallahassee area store. They assured us that they do but the fact is they have yet to do so after numerous tries over a two month period. IT WOULD BEHOOVE YOU CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE IN THIS AREA . Update January 2008
 McDonalds corporate has promised resolution&amp;delivered nothing not even the food owed. Next time you want McDonalds go somewhere else at least once show them the people are the boss until they reolve the situation by actions not words.

&quot; McDonald&apos;s is the world&apos;s #1 fast-food company by sales, with more than 31,000 flagship restaurants serving burgers and fries in almost 120 countries. About 75% of its restaurants are run by franchisees. Despite its size and leading position in the fast food industry, McDonald&apos;s has only recently recovered from a long slump in sales.

The burger giant managed to reverse its course by focusing on food quality and improving sales at existing locations rather than rapid expansion. Its strategy of being better rather than bigger has been the cornerstone of CEO Jim Skinner&apos;s administration since taking the reigns at McDonald&apos;s in 2004.&quot;

Perhaps McDonald would be well served to revisit Mr. Skinner&apos;s commitment&amp;not get off track again

 Some Northwest Florida Region
Corporate McDonalds Seem Out of Control
 
 McDonalds
 1944 N. Monroe St Tallahassee Fl. 
 
 
 
 It seems like a simple thing getting lunch to go at McDonalds. When the girl behind the counter forgot to include a 20 piece McNuggets and got the Chicken Sandwich wrong it seemed like a simple thing to correct. Welcome to the McDonalds at at 1944 N. Monroe St Tallahassee Fl. where a simple mistake opened the door to immature combative Tiffany Washington. She was the last in a line of people who were incompetent and did not care about the customers. Corporate administrative assistant Amanda Gay started the apathetic ball rolling when she told us all 30 McDonalds that were corporately owned in the Tallahassee area took their phones off the hook form 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., every day. This claim would later be disputed by Tiffany Washington. 
 What they say 
 Plan to win vision: Our well-trained employees will proudly provide, fast friendly and accurate service with a smile, in a way that delights our customers. (McDonalds®Worldwide Corporate Responsibility Report) 
 


 What they do 
 Four times the customer asked if all items were in the bags the answer was yes. McDonalds forgot 20 Chicken McNuggets and made the Grilled Chicken Sandwich wrong. After 6 hours of continual calling they answered.

A manager at the store Priscilla, said they do notanswer phones when it is busy but if I came in and provided the receipt they would help. She was asked if someone else driving on their way past could them pick the McNuggets and the Chicken Sandwich up for them. Priscilla said it was their policy that the customer had to have the receipt. She was informed that the Burger King on Monroe Street just down the street took the name and said just mentioned the name. When the replacement order cost more than the original order Burger King refused to accept any extra money and apologized to the customer. Mistakes happen, Burger King, Taco Bell among others always made it easy for the customer. Priscilla said she could not do that.

When the customer drove back to the McDonalds Tiffany Washington demanded a receipt asked the time on the receipt wondering how long it had been since the order. She was informed that Priscilla had said to come in and that the phone was off the hook and the customer could not reach them. Ms Washington with amazing arrogance and defiance dared the customer to prove that the phone was off the hook. When told that Amanda Gay from the Tallahassee Corporate told them that was their policy Washington said I don&apos;t know her and again said angrily and daringly&quot;were you here? What do you want this isn&apos;t worth it&quot;. 

 What they say: 
 M ission&amp;Values: McDonalds mission is to be our customersfavorite place and way to eatwith inspired people who delight each customer with unmatched quality, service, cleanliness and value every time. (McDonalds®Worldwide Corporate Responsibility Report) 
 

 What they do What do you want this isn&apos;t worth it&quot;. Washington disgusted asked. The customer asked for the McNuggets that were missing and more Nuggets instead of the sandwich if possible and asked for any amount that equaled the Grilled Chicken. Washington stared at the customer angry and clearly doubting the veracity of the claim. At this point the customer said forget I&apos;ll go to Burger King, Washington eagerly said good! I don&apos;t care. As the customer pulled out and drove away Washington was laughing. 

 What they said: To The Editor,

I am writing in response to an article that appeared in the January 30 issue of The Palm Beach Times regarding a recent experience at a McDonalds restaurant.

As the Director of Operations for this McDonalds restaurant, I would like to personally apologize to Mr. Pearlman for the experience he received.

It has never been our policy to leave phones off the hook - or leave them unanswered - during the lunchtime period. Our top priority is always to satisfy our customers, and I have personally spoken to my restaurant staff to remind them about our policy and also make sure that each and every customer receives exceptional service.

I would like to personally invite Mr. Pearlman back to McDonald&apos;s for a meal on us. I appreciate his patronage and hope that he will continue to be a valued customer.

Paul Van Sickle,
Director of Operations

 Action Line Response 
 When the order was not correct the number on the receipt was called. Ms Amanda Gay an administrative assistant answered. She was told that an order was not correct. Ms Gay said the number on the receipt was a corporate number for jobs and that the store should be called on the other number on the receipt.

After 25 minutes of trying to reach the McDonalds on Monroe street at 1:30 p.m. corporate was called back from the same phone. The call was not answered. After 8 tries at calling corporate went unanswered we called from the Times Media Group Phones. The call was answered at corporate right away. We spoke told Amanda Gay and told her we could not reach the store.

This time she did in fact tell us the Corporate Stores took their phone off the hook from 11:00 - 3:00. We wondered why she did not say that the first time. She said she would send us some two coupons for meals. She was asked if she even knew what our order was, she said no. She was asked when the coupons would come and if she understood that we just wanted the food.

Ms Gay told us the coupons would come in 7 to 10 days. She was told that it would be easier to just have the store answer and replace the food, she did not answer. The phone was open but efforts to have her speak were not responded to.

We tried again to call the store for six hours to get the food ordered. We finally reached Priscilla a manger at the store. She told us that they do not usually answer the phones as they are busy and it takes away from customer service.

Priscilla seemed very sad and tired and told us the customer could come by to get the food but could not have someone passing by on the way home come by to pick up the food without a receipt .

When we returned to the store we got Tiffany Washington.

We tried to call the McDonalds at 1944 N. Monroe Street Tallahassee Fl later that night,. No one answered.
We believe that everyday people are very important they make up the majority of peoples daily lives. When an order at a fast food restaurant is wrong it is easy and normal to fix.

What is wrong when local corporate McDonalds pushes the problem to the store knowing the store cannot be reached. Amanda Gay at corporate says the phones at the store she directed us to are taken off the hook. At one point she refused to speak.

The director of operations says they are not taken off the hook yet the store cannot be reached for hours. A manger Priscilla says they do not answer the phones it will take away from customer service, corporate cannot understand we do not want coupons just to pick up the food, the store cannot do what Taco Bell, Burger King and Domino&apos;s have done take a name and let the customer pick up the food at their convenience.

The night supervisor Tiffany Washington is a metaphorical Chucky in disguise and you ask us visit the store again for a meal on you when your location has yet to give us the food we paid for.

We did go back but not for a meal on you for a meal we paid for and met Tiffany Washington. We have tried several times even after your e-mail to contact the Monroe McdDonalds to no avail.

Everyday matters are relevant they happen everyday. So far all this McDonalds has offered are words. Their actions do not match and in fact often their words do not match. We do not want to return for a free meal, we have yet to receive the meal we paid for. Nor would it make sense to subject ourselves to further abuse at a McDonald that still cannot answer their phones or show any indication that they have changed anything.

Until they do, weee stand onpuuuur complaint. When and if McDonalds rectifies this situation or even answers their phones they say are not off the hook we will update this posting to aaccomodate their actiions.

 .. Verizon 
 Verizon records customer calls, they are unable and unwilling to stop recording you. When the customer tries to record Verizon it becomes clear that the customer is not to be given the same advantages or rights as Verizon. We do not accept the premise that customers are supposed to be subservient to big business. Unless Verizon changes it&apos;s policy the public, in our opinion would be better suited to find a company that respects their rights, basic reasonableness and good faith. 
 We spoke to Verizon and recorded their response which led to Verizon changing their policy. Are you listening NOW! Click to hear.
