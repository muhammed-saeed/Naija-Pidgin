 Career Development stages 
 

 
CAREER planning, to the uninitiated, would be a one-time process, something that is done by high school students or fresh graduates at the beginning of their working life to choose a profession or career path. However, nothing could be farther from the truth.
Considering that most people change their careers (not jobs) as many as four to five times in their working life, career planning is, and ought to be- a lifetime process.
It is a process that needs to be regularly reviewed, updated and changed.
While there are any number of things that can affect the way your career shapes up- circumstances, changes in attitude, your family, the economy, market trends and even the stage of life you are in, a successful career plan is one that can adapt to these changes and reinvent itself when required.
Like the changes in a man&apos;s life span, his career too undergoes various stages of development; and, just like a person&apos;s life, career options too are flexible in the initial stages, and have a propensity to become more predictable later on. This is not to say that you cannot break free of your chosen career at an advanced stage. -
In fact, many people have done just that! But, it is also a fact that your options will be limited once your career follows a set path for a certain amount of time. So, what is the ideal stage to explore your career options?
When do you begin to get into the skin of your career? When do you outgrow it? Is there something called a seven-year itch or a mid-career crisis? When is the ideal time to switch over to a new career? If these are some of the questions that cross your mind when you think of career planning, this article attempts to answer some of them.

 

 A whole new world: Assessment 
 
For a baby, its first real comprehension of faces, of sounds, voices and colour can be an overwhelming experience. It opens up a whole new world for them. Then curiosity takes over, prompting them to explore the world around them.
Compare this with the feelings you go through when you are young, inexperienced and not sure about what you want to be doing for the rest of your life.
At the assessment stage, you are almost like the baby as far as your future career is concerned- unaware, gullible and irresolute. In this stage, you are still getting ready for your life&apos;s work.
This stage is characterised by a lack of direction, in that you are not sure what your values, strengths, and weaknesses are. You are curious to explore your options and find out what fits you best.
Taking assessment/psychometric tests or approaching a career counsellor or coach for advice and direction can be of great help to you at this stage of your career. Proper counselling can help you get started in the right direction straight away without loss of precious time or resources.
 

 
 Swinging times: Exploration 
 
In the exploratory stage of your career, you are researching on the opportunities that exist for your kind of qualifications and personality traits. This stage is characterized by feelings of confusion, and excitement. You may feel overwhelmed by all the jobs and opportunities that exist as you begin the process of researching.
You may find yourself being pulled in different directions. If you have a positive approach at this stage, you can learn about many possibilities that you can explore. However, to be successful, you have to do some serious preparation and research.
 

 
 Steady road ahead: Commitment&amp;retention 
 
You have had your fair share of adventure dabbling in diverse professions, testing waters and having fun. Now you are ready to settle down and stabilize your career.
In the commitment stage, you will feel confident about what you want to be doing for a career. At this stage your focus will be on gaining knowledge and experience, setting long-term goals and adopting a success-oriented mind-set.
You will want to remain committed to your career by continually updating your skill sets and staying on par with industry standards. This is the most important stage of your career building process.
 

 
 Restlessness and change: Transition 
 
After years of working very hard to achieve success in your career, you suddenly find something amiss- it could be the lack of growth opportunities, dearth of challenges or plain boredom and disenchantment and you suddenly realize that you have fallen into a rut.
You could call it the (nth) year itch, mid-career crisis, world-weariness or burnout- these are all symptoms that your career needs a transition.
The transition stage is characterized by feelings of discomfort because you are unsure of what you will be doing next (and/or if you will be happy).
If the spirit of adventure still beats in some corner of you heart, now is probably the time you will break free, and make conscious changes in your career direction by seeking what you crave most, be it new opportunities, job satisfaction or better work-life balance.
Career cycles vary, and patterns change from individual to individual. For some it may have very few changes or some may go through a transition repeatedly.
Some may even have very quick career cycles- they may complete the entire cycle within a year or so! For others, it may take ten or twenty years to come the full round.
A clear understanding of the various stages of career development not only helps to identify one&apos;s current priorities and chart out a career plan for the future, but also helps leaders and managers chart an effective career path for their employees.
 

 
 Exploration 
 
In this stage, individuals hover on to their preferred area of work. It is a macro level understanding of a person&apos;s professional interests. Individuals explore the various opportunities available to them and identify their area of interest.
This is an ideal stage for assessing employee interests and skills. Charting out a career plan according to employee interests keeps employees motivated and therefore ensures higher productivity.
 
 

 
 Prepare yourself before attending a recruitment fair 
 

 
In the present times, a job search is not complete without attending a career fair. Students are accustomed to attending such fairs.

They see such fairs as an event where they can meet prospective employers under one roof, push their résumés and weigh their own chances of landing a plum job. However, they gloss over some of the basic guidelines they have to stick to while attending such a fair.

According to the results of a survey carried out by TeamLease Services Private Limited, an HR outsourcing firm based in Bangalore, if students follow certain norms, they would be able to land the job of their dreams. They shared the details of the survey with Education Plus.

 Pre-register: Registering at a career fair usually includes submitting a brief résuméor filling up a prescribed registration form or telephonic registration.

 Research: It is important to get a list of the companies participating in the fair. Do some research on each company you propose to meet. Don&apos;t waste time with companies that do not interest you.

Collect information on companies using the Internet before attending the job fair.

This would enable you to be armed with some basic information about the company. This homework would also stand you in good stead at the time of meeting the company representatives.

 Resumes: Carry enough copies of resumes to the job fair—at least two a company. Depending on the number of companies you plan to meet, take several copies with you. In case you have multiple interests and different job objectives, bring different versions of your resume.

 Career portfolio: In India, this is a new trend and not all employers expect you to have a career portfolio. It may even prompt employers to look at you with a different perspective, and offer you additional responsibilities or a new role with better salary. A career portfolio should include copies of your résumés, list of references, certificates of appreciation, and samples of your best work.

While it may not always be possible for all job aspirants to bring in work samples, there is no harm in carrying brief project reports of your best assignments.

 Interview process: Interviews are usually very short, and you may get just about two to five minutes to market yourself. Hence, you need to make the most of your time. Be specific, and communicate the skills that you have and how you can contribute to the organisation.

By the end of the session, you should also have enough information about the organisation, skills needed for the job profile, salary, training, contractual obligations, if any, and most importantly, the name of the person with whom you need to follow-up after the fair.

Do not forget to collect the business card of the person you met.

 Attire: Sober colours are better than garish ones. Men should shave, comb their hair, polish their shoes, and look presentable.

Women should avoid gaudy attire and heavy jewellery. Wear subtle makeup and comfortable footwear. Very strong perfumes are an absolute no-no for both.

 Body language: Make eye contact, offer a firm handshake, and show enthusiasm. Fidgeting, shifting nervously, rocking to and fro will reduce your worth. You cannot afford to have a nonchalant attitude either. Listen to what is being told, and ask intelligent questions.

Being loud, brash, and pushy will put off the interviewer, and ruin your chances of getting a job.
 Follow-up: Many job aspirants do not understand the significance of a follow-up.
This is the first opportunity you have to meet the potential employer and sometimes you may need to go for an on-site interview or a short training on the job.
In any case, it is a good practice to either call the interviewer the same evening or the following day to thank the interviewer for the time spent with you at the fair.
 

 

 
 The making of a research scholar 


The research domain is one that attracts a significant number of students. In this new series, we will try to provide aspiring researchers with a detailed view of what research is all about.
 

 
Education has several noble goals many of which are sublime. They aim at making great human beings with altruistic motives in whatever they do. Culture, compassion, and ethics have roots in education in its widest sense. However, for the great majority of people, higher education is a means for securing a respectable job that would ensure them a successful life, success in the sense in which it is commonly understood. They would hope to find a job or profession that gives them sufficient money for a good living. A sense of job satisfaction, and ample time for rest, leisure, entertainment, and enjoyment, with a reasonable quantum of work and responsibility would please them.

 

 Pursuing knowledge 
 
However, there is another segment in the population that would find satisfaction only in the pursuit of knowledge by breaking new ground to arrive at enchanting discoveries in virgin areas. The development of the fields of science and technology, new vistas in social life and the progress of humanity in general depend on the fruits of the tireless striving of such individuals who work with a sense of dedication. It is their spirit of inquiry that spurs fresh dreams and takes mankind to new worlds. These are the people who take up research.

It has to be appreciated that any subject would grow, only through sustained research activity. Status quo cannot prevail in any field in our world of intense competition. There are struggles for survival at all levels.
 

 
 Rapid strides 
 
The tremendous strides in the fields of science and technology were made with stunning rapidity during the past two centuries. All the significant scientific inventions were made during this short period. According to one estimate, if the life of the earth is reduced to a scale of 24 hours, all these inventions took place in the final 1/450 of a second.

Look at an example. How many of us would remember that Abraham Lincoln never used a telephone, typewriter, fountain pen, or motorcar? These were discovered only after three, three, 19, and 22 years respectively after his death in 1865.
 

 
 Meaning of research 
 
The word `research&apos; may mean different things to different people. It has been defined in many ways. But we should have a clear picture as to what research is in our discussion. It is a scholarly or scientific investigation or inquiry. It contributes to expansion of knowledge through discovery of facts, theories, or laws. It may involve hunting for facts or experimentation. A thinker says,&quot;It spans inquiry from isolating a specific gene to investigating the workings of a camel&apos;s third eyelid, from identifying themes of masculinity in dance choreography to determining if older computer users are put off by fancy graphics.&quot;
 

 
 A misconception 
 
There is perhaps a misconception that research is confined to science and technology. There are vast areas of research in disciplines such as history, languages, literature, and sociology. Whatever might be the discipline, research has to be an active, diligent and systematic process of inquiry in order to discover, interpret or revise facts, events, behaviour, or theories. Applying the findings of research for the refinement of knowledge in other disciplines, or in enhancing the quality of human life also falls in the realm of research and development.

We are discussing research in its noble sense. But it is sometimes reduced to a mundane activity, when the sole intention of the researcher is to acquire a doctoral degree just to satisfy the administrative requirements to secure a promotion in teaching or some other academic field.

The candidate in such cases may not be motivated by a real spirit of inquiry, but by an eagerness to fulfil certain organisational stipulations. He may not enjoy the thrill at the moment of discovery of a new theory or concept through higher intellectual pursuit. There are, unfortunately, ignoble enterprises that dish out readymade Ph.Ds like parcels from a fast food restaurant, where the recipients never enjoy the emotional peaks of a true researcher. Let us ignore that variety of research, and focus on the exciting world of genuine research.
 

 
 The attributes 
 
We know that any researcher should be motivated by a noble goal. Work gets the first, second, and third priority. The attributes of a good research scholar may be summarised thus:
 
 Analytical mind Communication skills Concentration Dedication Determination Flexibility Freedom from the obsessions of clock and calendar Global outlook Honesty Innovative approach Insight Intellectual curiosity Intelligence Keen observation Lab temperament Optimism Organisational ability Originality Passion for knowledge Patience Persistence Precision and accuracy Presentation skills Questioning attitude Resilience to withstand temporary setbacks Scientific discipline Self-confidence Social skills Spirit of enquiry Teamwork Writing skills 
 
 

 

 

 ROAD MAP TO CAREER 

 
Roadmap to your Career!

Think about the steps you would take to plan a trip. In order to reach a final destination there is a place to begin, decisions to make about the route to follow (hopefully without too many detours!), and the need to organize many details in between departure and arrival. A good map is an essential tool to navigate your way.
Planning your career direction is no different from planning a trip. There is a place to begin, and many important decisions and details to consider before arriving at your chosen career. This journey too has a map, the Roadmap to Career Planning. Following the four steps of this map from beginning to end will help you reach your final destination successfully!
 
 
 Step One: Increase Self Knowledge 
 
 
 Step Two: Explore Your Options 
 
 
 
 
 
 Step Three: Clarify Direction 
 
 Step Four: Arrive at Your Destination 
 
 
 Step One: Increase Self Knowledge. Knowing how your interests, talents and values relate to major and career options is an important place to begin your career planning. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, from self reflection to a computer-based career assessment. Here are some specific steps that you can take to increase your self-knowledge:
 
 Meet your Career Consultant to can help you to begin exploring or confirming your focus in college. See the page,&quot; What should I major in? &quot;. Take a career inventory to help you know how your unique interests, talents and values relate to major and career direction. Your career consultant can help you with this. Use the Career Center to help you make choices about school-year positions on/off campus and to identify summer opportunities. Get involved: take advantage of other social/academic organizations and services on-campus! 
 
 Step Two: Explore your options. Now that you know more about yourself, you can use this information as a basis to learn more about specific career areas that are a good fit for you. Exploring a variety of career ideas is an important step that takes both time and effort. This step is often hurried through in an attempt to reach a decision. However, the payoff for putting ample energy into exploration is a well developed plan for the next step and more confidence in your career direction. Here are some specific steps that you can take to explore your options:
 
 Plan to meet with your Career Consultant to learn about career options related to your major choice. If you haven&apos;t done so yet, get involved in social/academic organizations and services on-campus! Attend workshops and programs sponsored by the Career Center. Make or confirm your choice of major. Still not sure? Check out our&quot; What should I major in? &quot;page. Consider part-time, on-campus positions and internships that relate to your major or would otherwise help you to develop additional skills. Use Career Center services such as counseling, campus interviews, career resource library. Consider your study abroad options. The Office of International Education also has its own website. Explore opportunities for independent research and creative projects through the Undergraduate Research Initiative Office . Register with the Fellowship Resource Advising Center to receive scholarship/fellowship information. 
 
 Step Three: Clarify Direction. Confirming your major choice and career focus requires applying both self knowledge and career exploration results to an experiential or hands-on learning environment. This means finding an internship, summer or part-time job, or volunteer opportunity related to your major or career interest. These experiences serve to confirm your direction. Here are some activities that can help clarify your direction:
 
 Send for career materials from professional associations and consider joining one as a student member. Devote a significant amount of time seeking a summer job/internship related to your field. Attend job fairs, and search for internships. Your Career Consultant can assist you with additional resources. Assume a leadership role in campus organizations and/or volunteer projects. Develop relationships with advisors and faculty members. Identify individuals who will serve as references for graduate school or employment. Schedule a mock interview. This is a free program that&apos;s offered through our Career Center-- contact your Career Consultant to set this up. Explore your options to attend graduate or professional school. The Career Center has many resources to help you make and prepare for this decision. 
 
Planning for medical or law school? Meet with your advisor before spring about admission processes and testing .

Step Four: Arrive at Your Destination. In reality, the&quot;destination&quot;is the end of your undergraduate academic experience, and therefore the beginning of a new journey. At this point, you&apos;ll need to make a decision, preferably in your junior year, about the direction you will take after graduation: to go to graduate school, or to find a job. Either direction requires a new plan; a new roadmap! The direction you now take requires specialized tools to get there. Here are some steps you can take when you arrive at your destination:

Plan for Graduate College:
 
 Complete applications and take the necessary entrance exams. Request faculty members and employers to serve as references. Start a credential file for graduate school application materials at the Career Center. Continue researching graduate school funding sources by searching the Fellowship Resource Advising Center . 
 

Embark on a Job Search:
 
 Meet with your Career Consultant for assistance with your job search plan. Frequently check the Interview section to learn about employer information sessions and interview schedules. Attend workshops for last minute help with resumes, employment letters, interviewing skills and working job fairs. Network with parents, friends, alumni and others. Contact employers by participating in on-campus recruiting, and job fairs. Review job postings, Career Resource Center directories, and the Internet. Use the Career Search database, for access to over two million companies.
