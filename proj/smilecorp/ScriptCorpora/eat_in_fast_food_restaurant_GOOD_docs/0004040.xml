 Burger King has been nationally recognized on multiple occasions as being the filthiest restaurant in the United States. Their standards for hiring are lower than others, and the quality and cleanliness of their facilities have been the focal point of multiple complaints over the years. Try submitting a FOIA request in your area for restaurant health code violations and you&apos;ll see what I mean.

 McDonald&apos;s pays the best, and if you stay there for about a year, at most franchises, you will get promoted and get more money.
