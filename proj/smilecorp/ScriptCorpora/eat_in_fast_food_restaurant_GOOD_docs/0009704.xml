About Arby&apos;s ® 
 
Arby&apos;s ® is the place for people hungering for a unique, better tasting alternative to traditional fast food. It&apos;s the favorite place for people who crave something different and better. Serving one-of-a-kind menu items, Arby&apos;s is well known for slow-roasted and freshly sliced roast beef sandwiches and famous Market Fresh sandwiches, wraps and salads, made with wholesome ingredients and served with the convenience of a drive-thru.

From day one, Arby&apos;s Roast Beef Restaurants offered an innovative menu, offering guests something other than hamburgers in the newly inspired quick service segment. When foodservice veterans Leroy and Forrest Raffel opened the first Arby&apos;s in Boardman, Ohio on July 23, 1964, customers enjoyed roast beef sandwiches, potato chips, and Texas-sized iced teas. To name their new venture, the brothers decided on Arby&apos;s, which stands for R.B., the initials of the Raffel Brothers - although many suspect the R.B. stands for roast beef.

Leroy and Forrest never looked back. They fine tuned the operation and sold the first franchise to Sam Feldman the following year. Today, Arby&apos;s rich heritage is comprised of several multi-generation franchise owners. In fact, Jim Raffel, founder Leroy&apos;s son, owns and operates three locations in Maine.

The enterprising spirit that originated with the Raffel Brothers has fueled the development of Arby&apos;s throughout its 41 year history. The company added an average of 50 restaurants a year in the 1970s while simultaneously creating and perfecting timeless menu favorites, Beef &apos;n Cheddar, Jamocha Shakes, Curly Fries and Arby&apos;s signature sauces, Arby&apos;s BBQ sauce and Horsey Sauce ® .
Arby&apos;s continued expanding both locations and menu items during the next decade, opening restaurant number 1,000 and introducing chicken to the menu in 1981.

In 1991, Arby&apos;s was the first to introduce a complete Lite Menu featuring three sandwiches and four salads under 300 calories and 94% fat free. In 1994, Arby&apos;s banned smoking in all company-owned restaurants, another first in the quick service segment.

In 1995, the Arby&apos;s Foundation launched the Arby&apos;s Charity Tour (ACT), a series of corporate golf tournaments and other fund-raising activities to benefit youth-mentoring organizations, such as Big Brothers Big Sisters.  Since then, the ACT has raised over $18 million, a testament to Arby&apos;s commitment to make a difference in the communities its restaurants serve.
A change in the company&apos;s ownership set the course for menu expansion and a strengthened brand.  Triarc Companies, Inc. purchased Arby&apos;s in 1993 and innovation quickly followed.  Arby&apos;s introduced Arby&apos;s Market Fresh in 2001, a line of deli-style sandwiches and salads made with high quality and unique ingredients.  In 2003, wraps extended the popular additions.

Following a thorough study of the brand and customer base, Arby&apos;s introduced the &quot;I&apos;m Thinking Arby&apos;s&quot; campaign in 2005.  The ad series featured Arby&apos;s point of difference - high quality, unique products not typically found in fast food.  When you&apos;re craving Arby&apos;s you can&apos;t think of anything else.

On July 25, 2005, Triarc acquired RTM Restaurant Group, Arby&apos;s largest franchisee, and formed Arby&apos;s Restaurant Group, Inc., an Atlanta-based company comprised of more than 3,500 restaurants.  Of those, Arby&apos;s Restaurant Group owns and operates more than 1,000 restaurants located in the United States.

Roland Smith returned to Atlanta as President and Chief Executive Officer of Arby&apos;s Restaurant Group in April 2006.  Smith first joined Arby&apos;s in 1994 and served as the brand&apos;s President and CEO from 1997 to 1999.

On September 29, 2008, Triarc Companies Inc. merged with Wendy&apos;s International, Inc. to form Wendy&apos;s/Arby&apos;s Group, Inc. Wendy&apos;s/Arby&apos;s Group, Inc. is the third largest quick-service restaurant company in the United States.

On July 5, 2011, Arby&apos;s was acquired by an affiliate of Roark Capital Group, an Atlanta-based private equity firm that focuses on investing in franchise, brand management and restaurant companies.
