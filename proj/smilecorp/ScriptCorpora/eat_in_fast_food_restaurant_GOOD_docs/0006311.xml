 &quot;What Can One Little Person Do?&quot;
If just one person stopped eating fast food for just 2 weeks they 
 would:
 
 Save 3,222 gallons of water that would 
 be used for livestock
Save 9.4 pounds of grain used for livestock feed
Protect 285.4 square feet of rain forest from being cut down 
 to graze cattle
Prevent 15.4pounds of manure from being created (source www.wannaveg.com) 


 Here&apos;s Our Goal:
 
 Reduce the consumption of fast food through 
 education and community awareness resulting in healthier people and 
 a better world. 

 10 WAYS TO GET 
 THE JOB DONE: 

 1:    Make a 
 clear goal and have a plan.

2:    Decide to make a change. If you don&apos;t, you won&apos;t get anywhere.

3:    Use the Buddy System - Reduce or 
 eliminate fast food with a friend, classmate, co-worker or family 
 member.

4:    Plan Ahead - Eat a 
 healthy meal or snack before leaving home, that way you aren&apos;t 
 tempted.

5:    H 2 O 
 to Go - Bring water from home so you don’t have to stop for a 
 beverage and be tempted.

6:    Stash 
 the right stuff - Bring healthy, non-perishable snacks in the car.

7:    Home Cookin&apos;- Cook at least one 
 big meal at home during the week so you’ll have leftovers.

8:    Change your routine - For example, 
 if you hit the drive-through every morning on your way to work, 
 change your route.

9:   Don&apos;t tempt yourself -Don&apos;t even go inside a 
 fast food restaurant.

10:   Take part in one of the challenges! You will 
 be healthier and help the world too!
