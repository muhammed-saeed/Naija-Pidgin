 Showing all 124 items Jump to: Cameo  (2)  | Spoilers  (9) Michael J. Fox had always been the first choice for Marty, but he was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts with his work on Family Ties . As &quot;Family Ties&quot; co-star Meredith Baxter was pregnant at the time, Fox was carrying a lot more of the show than usual. The show&apos;s producer Gary David Goldberg simply couldn&apos;t afford to let Fox go. Zemeckis and Gale then cast Eric Stoltz as Marty based on his performance in Mask . After four weeks of filming Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale felt that Stoltz wasn&apos;t right for the part and Stoltz agreed. By this stage, Baxter was back fully on the show and Goldberg agreed to let Fox go off to make the film. Fox worked out a schedule to fulfill his commitment to both projects. Every day during production, he drove straight to the movie set after taping of the show was finished every day and averaged about five hours of sleep. The bulk of the production was filmed from 6pm to 6am, with the daylight scenes filmed on weekends. Reshooting Stoltz&apos;s scenes added $3 million dollars to the budget.

 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: The time machine has been through several variations. In the first draft of the screenplay the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At the end of the first draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test. Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he and Steven Spielberg did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. (See also Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .) The Nevada desert bomb test was left out in order to reduce the budget. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a DeLorean, but in order to send Marty back to the future the vehicle had to drive the DeLorean into an atomic bomb test.

If you look carefully at the cover of the comic you can see the EC logo in the upper left. Although there was no &quot;Tales from Space&quot; by EC (Their science fiction titles were &quot;Weird Science&quot; and &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;), there was a comic entitled &quot;Tales from the Crypt.&quot; Robert Zemeckis is a fan of the now defunct EC and served as an executive producer of Tales from the Crypt .

Fox on the 2010 DVD/Blu-Ray interviews, the interior of the DeLorean was so tight due to the added props, that every time he had to shift gears, he would repeatedly hit his forearm on the handle that turns on the time circuits and he would also rap his knuckles hard against the time display board. If you pay attention during the car chase with the terrorists, you can hear these hits every time Marty uses the shifter.

This is similar to the issues Gale and Robert Zemeckis had with a terrorist scene in Used Cars (See IMDb trivia on that film).

The first one happened shortly after the finishing of Back to the Future Part II where all the original surrounding buildings burned to the ground by lightning. The second fire in 1994 almost destroyed the structure. In 2008, the fire that destroyed the nearby King Kong ride/set, along with two archive vaults and the New York street, slightly scorched the tower.

 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: The Screen Actors Guild can&apos;t have two people with the same name on their books. So Michael J. Fox inserted the letter J in his name to differentiate himself from an actor called Michael Fox . In Back to the Future , Marty goes back to the year 1955. His dad is a huge fan of the show Science Fiction Theatre, something Marty uses to his advantage. The original Michael Fox starred in the real Science Fiction Theatre in the year 1955.

The trivia items below may give away important plot points.
 The &quot;Mr. Fusion Home Energy Converter&quot;, which is sitting on the DeLorean when Doc returns from the future, is made from (among other things) a Krups coffee grinder.
 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: The mall where Marty McFly meets Doc Brown for their time travel experiment is called &quot;Twin Pines Mall.&quot; Doc Brown comments that old farmer Peabody used to own all of the land, and he grew pines there.

When he comes back to the mall at the end of the film, the sign at the mall identifies the mall as &quot;Lone Pine Mall.&quot;

That dialogue is re-inserted in Back to the Future Part II when the second Marty creeps past the car the first Marty and 1955 Lorraine are in. Lorraine states she&apos;ll let her kids do anything, Marty replies, &quot;I&apos;d like to have that in writing.&quot;
 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: In the original script, Marty&apos;s playing rock and roll at the dance caused a riot which had to be broken up by police. This, combined with Marty accidentally tipping Doc off to the &quot;secret ingredient&quot; that made the time machine work (Coca-Cola) caused history to change. When Marty got back to the 1980s, he found that it was now the 1950s conception of that decade, with air-cars and what-not (all invented by Doc Brown and running on Coca-Cola). Marty also discovers that rock and roll was never invented, and he dedicates himself to starting the delayed cultural revolution. Meanwhile, his dad digs out the newspaper from the day after the dance and sees his son in the picture of the riot.
 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: In the shot of the clock tower of 1985, after Doc Brown sent Marty into the future (with a flying-by helicopter), you can clearly see that the piece of the ledge under the clock dial is broken off. It was broken off by Doc Brown in 1955.
 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: In the opening scene of the movie, as the camera pans across the clocks, one clock in the foreground has a small figure of Harold Lloyd hanging from the minute hand (see Safety Last! ) - a foreshadowing of the story&apos;s climax, where Doc Brown ( Christopher Lloyd ) clings to the face of the clock tower while trying to reconnect the cable.
 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: Co-writer Bob Gale confirmed that for wide shots, the wind during the storm at the Clock Tower was created by using a McBride, which was described by the writer as &quot;basically a airplane engine on a huge cherry picker&quot; and was placed a good fifty feet away from the actors. The McBride was so loud that all of the dialog said by actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd had to be re-recorded later. However, the McBride also had an effect on Fox&apos;s health: while filming the sequence where Marty yells up at Doc at the Clock Tower to tell him about the future, he coughed up blood after filming those scenes.
 Share this Hide options Facebook   |   Twitter   |   Permalink: According to Back to the Future Part III , the clock in the clock tower started running at 8:00 p.m. on September 5, 1885. The date is provided by the caption on the photograph that Doc Brown gives Marty at the end of Back to the Future Part III. The time is provided by the mayor in 1885 in Back to the Future Part III, who starts it. The lightning strikes the clock tower at 10:04 p.m. on November 12, 1955. This means that the clock tower operated for exactly 70 years, 2 months, 7 days, 2 hours, and 4 minutes.

The cliff-hanger ending of the film was not originally intended to set up a sequel, but rather just as one last joke. It was admitted by the writer that had they originally intended the following two sequels, the ending would not have had Jennifer get into the car with Doc and Marty. This is why Jennifer was almost immediately knocked unconscious at the beginning of Back to the Future Part II .
