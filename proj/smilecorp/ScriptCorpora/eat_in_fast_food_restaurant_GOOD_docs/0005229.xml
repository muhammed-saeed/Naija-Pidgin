Tips for Cogans Pizza

 Lose the manager!. The red haired chick that masquerades as the night manger should be banned from working with people anywhere. After signing up for a table we waited for two hours. At first we didn&apos;t catch on, but the&quot;manager&quot;was seating people (six tables- probably her friends) that came in after us. We called this to her attention with no resolution. The second time I made an issue, she said that she thought we left and would put us back at the botttom of the list. Right! We work too hard to spend our time and money where we are treated so poorly! One star is too much! …

 Great Food, Great Beer, Great People!. I know that most Americans want everything fast but sometimes you have to slow down; savor and enjoy little things like good food and good friends. Cogan&apos;s has been a favorite of mine since I was first brought there. I have yet to try anything on the menu that I don&apos;t like and there are too many beers to ever get tired of any single one.

Some may say the service is slow, but as a former waitress I understand is not in the waiter/waitress&apos;s control and cooking time is one of them. A pizza from Cogan&apos;s is prepared after you order it, meaning it&apos;s going to take time; to put together, to bake, and to be delivered. If you want fast food, go to a fast food restaurant.

I have never been met by the wait staff at Cogan&apos;s without a smile and I have never had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food.

A great place for those who enjoy life, not for those who are impatient. …

 From an objective Norfolk local. I don&apos;t really know why I&apos;m here... Oh yeah. I was looking up&quot;Azalea Inn&quot;to hopefully write to them lamenting the $40 tab (with tip) I just got for a simple pizza and (1) pitcher of domestic beer.....and then I find these unfair reviews of Cogan&apos;s. ...

In my opinion, Cogan&apos;s is the best.

Great (reasonably priced) beers. Very solid, if not EXCEPTIONAL pizza, and their Sunday, and Monday specials. .... I really don&apos;t know what kind of pretentious hole some of these others reviewers crawled out of.

 Haven&apos;t been there yet....... I was planning on paying Cogan&apos;s a visit.........but after reading the horrible reviews I&apos;m canceling my plans.I didn&apos;t plan to eat there, and now I never would,......I was looking for a place to play music.After hearing that the cook killed a cockroach and then made a pizza......WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS........I don&apos;t even want to touch the floor with the bottom of my shoes!!! How could people be so blind to such a DIRTY place?! Cogan&apos;s should be shut down!!!!!! I didn&apos;t think this place deserved one star but they wouldn&apos;t let me leave the site without it. …

 Screw this place. Food is not bad, but how bad can you really screw up pizza. My issue is they overcharged me too. Well, to be honest, they charged my card for my bill and another different bill. I called the manager, who told me he wasn&apos;t the manager, and said a similar phrase as in another post,&quot;The sorta things do sometimes happen.&quot;He went on to tell me he was too busy to help me cause he had other customers. Hey Jacko....you ripped me off. You have my money now why don&apos;t you finish with me before you go and rip someone else off?

The food is OK and the pizza is par quality, but REALLY greasy. I will never eat there again especially after reading several of these r o a c h comments. …
