 Banks Set to Post Blowout Mortgage Earnings for 2Q 
 
Refinancing activity continued to climb over the last three months, as did the gap between consumer and secondary market prices. Expect banks to report another quarter of strong mortgage revenues in the coming weeks.
 
 Business Borrowing Cooled in 2Q, Still Underpins Loan Growth 
 
Growth in commercial and industrial loans fell to the slowest pace in a year during the period, according to preliminary data. But the increase was still healthy enough to offset contractions in other loan categories, and help drive an expansion in balance sheets.
 
 Bank Tax Rate Slips as Outlook Improves 
 
The effective tax rate for banks has dropped to a range of roughly 30% to 32%, down from a range of roughly 32% to 33% in the years leading up to the recession. Recoveries of deferred tax assets might be the reason.
 
 Buyers&apos; Market in Bank Stock Offerings 
 
In a slow stretch for issuance of bank shares, companies looking to raise capital for acquisitions have come to the fore in offerings that have performed relatively well.

Tough Questions for New CEO at Embattled MERS
 Print Reprints Email Tweet 
Bill Beckmann begins each week with a flight from his home in St. Louis to Washington, D.C. The weekly flights have become a routine of sorts since he took on a job that of late, has become among the most daunting among executive jobs in the mortgage industry: President and chief executive of Merscorp Inc.

The company, located in the capital suburb of Reston, Va., runs MERS, the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems. Its MERS System is a database that tracks both mortgage servicers and the corresponding promissory note owners for 60% of the nation&apos;s residential mortgages.

Merscorp was created and is owned by the biggest players in the mortgage industry, including the government-sponsored enterprises and the nation&apos;s largest mortgage lenders and servicers—like Citi, where Beckmann spent 25 years of his professional career, including time serving as the president of its CitiMortgage unit from 2005 to 2008.

As the foreclosure crisis mounted, the role MERS played in the process has come under fire from borrower advocates and regulators, ultimately leading to a consent order issued by federal regulators two weeks before Beckmann&apos;s hiring was announced.

In an exclusive interview with BTN and American Banker affiliate Mortgage Technology magazine—his first interview with any members of the media since taking on this new role—Beckmann explains how he&apos;s leading the effort to overcome Merscorp&apos;s challenges and why he believes in the future of MERS.

The full interview with Beckmann appears in the September issue of Mortgage Technology magazine, available in print and online at mortgage-technology.com .

 MT : What stands out about what you know now inside Merscorp that you didn&apos;t know before you started?

 Beckmann : That MERS really is a small company. We&apos;re up to 65 people now, from 50 at the beginning of the year.

For something so important, with 60% market share in the U.S. of a back office utility function for all the key players, it really is a small company.

 MT : What are some of the ways Merscorp is changing under your leadership?

 Beckmann : We&apos;re transitioning from almost like an association to really a vendor of Fortune 500 companies. We view our role as supporting the members&apos; activities. That&apos;s what we were formed to do and we&apos;re going to continue to do it well. One of our challenges has been, in doing that, is our name is on all those transactions.

We did not have a robust process to make sure that all the data on our system was accurate, timely and reliable. Our view was that is the servicer&apos;s data and they&apos;re relying on it for their own transactions, they&apos;re using their own systems, so we don&apos;t have to double check.

Well, the regulators took the perspective of, &quot;No. You&apos;ve got your name on it. It&apos;s your system. It is being used, but you don&apos;t know exactly the way it&apos;s being used, so there&apos;s no reason those two things shouldn&apos;t line up.&quot;

So we&apos;ve put in place a process now that we&apos;re going to make sure that since we run a database, that&apos;s what we do, it&apos;s going to be perfect.

 MT : Do you think it&apos;s fair for people to ask why that wasn&apos;t in place to begin with?
