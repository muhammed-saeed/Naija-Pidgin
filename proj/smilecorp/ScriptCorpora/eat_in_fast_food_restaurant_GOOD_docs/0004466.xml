 Download   Starbucks Canada: Competitive Brand Strategy Analysis   2 STRATEGIC BRAND ANALYSIS: EXTERNAL ANALYSIS Market The Café market in Canada is highly saturated with top retailers fighting to gain higher market share. Along with Starbucks, the main coffee housesin Canada are Second Cup and Timothy¶s Coffee, quick service retailers i.e. Tim Hortons, and other coffee shops and franchisese.g. Van Houte in Quebec, Gourmet Cup in British Columbia.Specialty coffee shop chains (i.e. Starbucks, Second Cup etc.) are the domi nant players with specialty coffee shops, holding 62% share in terms of sales in 2008, a 1% f rom 2007 . However, fast food restaurant suc h as McDonalds, has also tapped in to the market and has been able to gain market share.Starbucks biggest Canadian competitor, Second Cup is Canada¶s largest specialty coffee franchiser, especially in the espresso-based beverages and iced drink segments. As fast food restaurant chain (i.e. bakery outlet), Tim Hortons offers quick- service food and low-priced coffee as its core product. Timothy¶s is a retailer of premium roasted coffee beans, and draws attention to its high quality Arabica coffee beans, and not so much on service or experience . The Canadian market is of interest to retail er s because 63% of Canadians over the age of 18 drink coffee daily with consumption averaging around 2.6 cups per day. F actors impacting market health The performance of specialty coffee stores are affected by economics recession, as customers become more price sensitive; costs of raw materials (coffee, milk etc.); chang ing consumer trends; government regulation i ncluding trade and labour laws. For details on PEST analysis, see Appendix B, page 6.   3 Competitors For detailed competito rs¶ analysis based on mar keting mix, please see Appendix C, page 7. The 3 main competitors of Starbucks in the Canadian market are Second Cup, Timothy¶s Coffee and Tim Hortons. Second Cup: in terms of revenues, it takes the second spot amongst specialty coffee shops. Like Starbucks, it offers a unique coffee experience and the drinks available rival those in Starbucks. With high quality products in a cozy environment the company offers an oasis concept ± where they are the neighborhood safe place to meet ± having rebranded itself as the µneighborhood oasis¶. Target customers are a mixture of generation X&amp;Y, in their early twenties to mid and late thirties. In terms of gender, 80% of the clientele are female. It invests most of its resources to portray itself as the ideal Canadian coffee shop and to provide the overall experience of buying and enjoying the coffee.Timothy¶s: the company focuses mainly on the quality of its products and not so much on the service. Comparatively, its service is faster than that of Starbucks and Second cup, and quality better than Tim Hortons¶. It purchases, roasts and brews finest Arabica coffee beans and francises 95% of its stores. Tim Hortons: it targets people from all age groups from the , from both lower and middle classes , who are price sensitive and on-the-go; this is evident as almost all independent stores have drive-thrus. It strives on providing fast service and low priced but good quality products. It does not focus as much on customer service or buying experience. They are strategically located in urban a nd rural areas, specially on busy highways, roads and gas stations, providing service to as many customers as possible, with almost 3000 stores all over Canada. It markets its brands towards families with young children through the Timbits hockey program, thereby attracting young hockey fans . , children influence their choices .
