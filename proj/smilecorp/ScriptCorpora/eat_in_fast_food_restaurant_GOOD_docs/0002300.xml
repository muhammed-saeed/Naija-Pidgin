		You Could Start Creating
Your Favorite Restaurant Dish
In Your Kitchen
In The Next 2 Minutes
 
 

 Last Updated: 7/8/2012 Greetings,

Everything you need to know, to start making famous restaurant recipes in you home anytime you 
 want is just 2 minutes away. And the cost to you will actually shock you (in a good way).



 Here are just a few of the benefits you will see in The Home Bound Dining Guide: Hundreds of recipes to choose from

 Save time

 Make your favorite restaurant dish

 Have seconds and a doggie bag

 Keep the family home for dinner

 Great food from your kitchen

 Easy to make recipes

 Create mouthwatering dishes

 Save Money 

 Dozens of restaurants to choose from

 Enjoy the fact that you made it 

 

Now you can dazzle your audience with the multitude of recipes from the Home Bound Dining Guide. 
 Turn your kitchen into your favorite restaurant and have your friends and family eating out of your 
 hand (pun intended).

It all started as a wish list. I was curious how they made a few dishes from my favorite restaurants. 
 It turned from a wish list into an obsession of more than 580 recipes from 39 different restaurants.

I have compiled all of these great recipes into one easy to use ebook. You can easily find any recipe 
 youre looking for through a simple search and then jump right to the page you want. Then you can print 
 out the page and take it with you to the store to get the freshest ingredients for your meal. Then the 
 recipe is right there every step of the way so there is no way to make a mistake.

Need to spice up your cooking repertoire? The Home Bound Dining Guide is the way to do just that.

I know this book isn&apos;t for everybody. All I ask is that you take a look at what it has to offer you and your
 family and then come to your own decision.

It is with great joy that I can offer you such a wide variety of restaurant recipes, many of which come directly from the 
 restaurants themselves, all contained in the simple to use Home Bound Dining Guide and now available for your home.

   &quot;My husband and I like to eat at Olive Garden. The Fettucini Alfredo is to die for. Then I discovered the many great recipes for Olive Garden in the Home Bound Dining Guide. Now I can have all the meals that I love anytime I want.&quot;

   &quot;I have made several of the recipes from the Home Bound Dining Guide and found everyone of them to be spot on. The compliments just keep on coming. I am not a great cook, but these recipes were easy and pretty much fool proof. I wish I had made the decision to purchase a long time ago. Thank you again for putting this out.&quot;

   &quot;I am enjoying all of the recipes. I can&apos;t wait to get home and start cooking something else. This is so much fun.&quot;

   &quot;Thank you for making this cookbook. I have never seen so many great recipes. My husband and I are having a great time making our favorite recipes together.&quot;

   &quot;I can&apos;t believe I could save this much by eating at home. Not to mention, the portions are much bigger than in the restaurant. And the recipes are very authentic&quot;

 The Secret&apos;s Out... 
Today it&apos;s tough to make ends meet. The rising cost of fuel and utilities just makes us want to stay home more often.
 So why settle for hum drum meals when you can set restaurant quality dishes in front of your family and then still
 have leftovers. Knowing that you made the meal can make all the difference.

Providing for my family is what drove me to start making the Home Bound Dining Guide and the recipes within it are 
 doing just that. It&apos;s a wonderful feeling.

There&apos;s a ton of good stuff in this book. I know because I&apos;ve had it. Trust me it would take you several weeks to find
 these recipes and put them all into one place. Again, I know because I did it. And you could be cooking one of these
 great recipes tonight.

Remember, you can easily find and print out your favorite recipe. Take it to the store to get the ingredients. Place 
 it on the counter while preparing the meal. The Home Bound Dining Guide is simple to use, anyone can do it.

I can&apos;t promise it will turn you into a great chef. Heck, it hasn&apos;t done that for me either. But I do know that my 
 family really appreciates the meals I cook for them. I hope that this is a book that you and yours will truly 
 appreciate as well.

 The Home Bound Dining Guide brings your favorite restaurant home by offering famous restaurant recipes, 
 the ingredients and the step by step instructions to prepare authentic recreations of the same dishes you pay 5 to 10 
 times as much for in the restaurant.

Scroll through this small sampling of recipes included in The Home Bound Dining Guide . Even if you don&apos;t see 
 your favorite recipe it&apos;s probably still in this restaurant recipe cookbook.
