 New 
 Illinois 
 Speed Law 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 Illinois  Photo 
 Radar 
 
 All Illinois drivers 
 or those visiting there. 

 


Illinois will 
 begin using photo radar in freeway work zones 
 starting in July ,2012 .

Beginning in July the 
 State of Illinois will use 
 speed cameras in areas designated as &apos;Work Zones&apos; on 
 major freeways. Anyone caught by these devices will 
 be mailed a $375.00 ticket for the FIRST offense, 
 but the SECOND offense will cost $1000.00 and comes 
 with a 90-Day suspension.

Drivers will also 
 receive demerit points against their license , which 
 allows insurance companies to raise their 
 rates.

This represents the harshest penalty 
 structure yet for a city or state using PHOTO 
 enforcements. The State will begin with TWO camera 
 vans issuing tickets in work zones with speed limits 
 lowered to 45 MPH.

Photographs of both the 
 Driver&apos;s face and License plate are 
 taken.

Pass this on to everyone you 
 know.

 Strengthening Chicago&apos;s Youth 
 
 sponsored by The Chicago Headline Club and The Community Media Workshop.
Please spread the word.


We are sometimes only as good as our sources and lately I sense that we
 need more voices to tell us what&apos;s happening with youth violence here.

That&apos;s why the Headline Club is co-sponsoring a meeting on June 28th
to 
bring journalists together with those who deal with youth violence.

As 
this story seems to tragically grow larger, we need, I think, to find 
new sources to explore
and explain and to help us describe the toll of 
the violence and what could be done.

The Community Media Workshop and a broad coalition of organizations
that
 deal with violence,
called Strengthening Chicago&apos;s Youth, is putting on
 the meeting.

WBEZ reporter and South Side bureau chief Natalie Moore is the moderator
 for our event.
 We will have close to 30 organizations along with public
 officials waiting at tables separately to offer their insights and 
contacts.

Think speed interviewing. Think dozens of stories.
Think contacts you never had before.

The meeting is from 9 am to 10:30 am on June 28th at 33 East Congress, 
first floor,
Columbia College, journalism building (Congress and Wabash)
CTA bus and train stops are nearby.
Here&apos;s the link for a map: http://mapq.st/LzUNYs. 
If you can make it, please click here so we know how many folks to expect.

            VICTORY!


 
            PNC Bank Makes It Easier for the &quot;Unbanked&quot; to Become &quot;Banked         Community Reinvestment Advocates Applauds Use of Alternative I.D. Forms                             To Open Second Chance Bank Accounts
        Policy Change Will Help More Low-Income Households Open Accounts! 
 PNC Bank announced 
today that it will begin allowing the unbanked and underbanked seeking 
to open accounts through PNC&apos;s &quot;Foundation Checking Program&quot;, and 
promoted as &quot;Second Chance Saturday&quot; financial education and account 
opening events by the Monroe Foundation, can now use a cellular phone 
bill as a &quot;secondary identification&quot; document along with a valid State 
of Illinois I.D. or Driver&apos;s License. 
 Otis C. Monroe, III, 
CEO of the Monroe Foundation, stated, &quot;This is a victory for our efforts
 to promote access to mainstream financial services for those who have 
been using currency exchanges and check cashing services. We applaud PNC
 Bank for responding to our advocacy, and taking immediate steps to 
modify a product that is reflective of the new market and economic 
realities of the working poor and low-income families that need a bank 
account&quot;. 
 Previously, to open a 
&quot;Foundation of Checking&quot; account a PNC Bank require a debit card, proof 
of vehicle insurance, for example, that community advocates urged as not
 consistent with the economic realities many individuals and households 
that are &quot;unbanked&quot; can produce as part of the account opening process, 
and would do more to keep households utilizing nontraditional financial 
services. 
 Since the launch of 
&quot;Second Chance Saturday&quot; financial education programs at PNC branch 
locations in the Chicago land area, over 250 accounts have been opened 
for families that were previously &quot;unbanked&quot;  
 
 The Monroe Foundation 
will begin an aggressive campaign this fall to mobilize increased 
participation in &quot;Second Chance Saturday&quot; events at PNC branch 
locations, taking full advantage of this policy change that was 
successfully pushed by the foundation and community advocates. 
 For more information 
about &quot;Second Chance Saturdays&quot;, contact Regina Banks, project manager, 
the Monroe Foundation, at (773) 706-8915

 AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE NOT APPLYING ! 


 Even if you do not have a college-aged child at home, 
 please share this with someone who does, pass this scholarship information 
 on to anyone and everyone that comes to mind. Though 
 there are a number of companies and organizations that have donated monies for scholarships use to African Americans, a great deal of the money is being returned because of a lack of interest. No one is going to knock on our doors and ask if we can use a scholarship. Take the initiative to get your children involved. There is no need for money to be returned to donating companies because we fail to apply for it. Please pass this information on to family members, nieces, nephews, friends with children etc. We must get the word out that money is available. If you are a college student or getting ready to become one , you probably already know how useful additional money can be. Our youth really could use these scholarships. Thanks!

 BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
 



                                        Life Without Black People

 
 A
 very humorous and revealing story is told about a group of white people
 who were fed up with African Americans, so they joined together and 
wished themselves away. They passed through a deep dark tunnel and 
emerged in sort of a twilight zone where there is an   America   without black people. 

At first these white people breathed a sigh of relief. 

All of the blacks have gone! Then suddenly, reality set in. The &apos;NEW   AMERICA &apos;  is not  America  at all - only a barren land.   1. There are very few crops that have flourished because the nation was built on a slave-supported system. 

2.
 There are no cities with tall skyscrapers because Alexander Mils, a 
black man, invented the elevator, and without it, one finds great 
difficulty reaching higher floors. 

3. There are few if any cars 
because Richard Spikes, a black man, invented the automatic gearshift, 
Joseph Gambol, also black, invented the Super Charge System for Internal
 Combustion Engines, and Garrett A. Morgan, a black man, 
invented the traffic signals.

4.
 Furthermore, one could not use the rapid transit system because its 
procurer was the electric trolley, which was invented by another black 
man, Albert R. Robinson.

5. Even if there were streets on which 
cars and a rapid transit system could operate, they were cluttered with 
paper because an African American, Charles Brooks, invented the street 
sweeper.. 

6. There were few if any newspapers, magazines and 
books because John Love invented the pencil sharpener, William Purveys 
invented the fountain pen, and Lee Barrage invented the Type Writing 
Machine and W. A. Love invented the 
Advanced Printing Press. They were all, you guessed it, Black. 

7.
 Even if Americans could write their letters, articles and books, they 
would not have been transported by mail because William Barry invented 
the Postmarking and Cancelling Machine, William Purveys invented the 
Hand Stamp and Philip Downing invented the Letter Drop. 

8. The lawns were brown and wilted because Joseph Smith invented the Lawn Sprinkler and John Burr the Lawn Mower.

9.
 When they entered their homes, they found them to be poorly ventilated 
and poorly heated. You see, Frederick Jones invented the Air Conditioner
 and Alice Parker the Heating Furnace. Their homes were also dim. But of
 course, Lewis 
Lattimer later invented the El! ectric Lamp, Michael 
Harvey invented the lantern, and Granville T. Woods invented the 
Automatic Cut off Switch. Their homes were also filthy because Thomas W.
 Steward invented the Mop and Lloyd P. Ray the Dust Pan. 

10. 
Their children met them at the door - barefooted, shabby, motley and 
unkempt. But what could one expect? Jan E. Matzelinger invented the 
Shoe Lasting Machine, Walter Sammons invented the Comb, Sarah Boone 
invented the Ironing Board, and George T. Samon invented the Clothes 
Dryer. 

11. Finally, they were resigned to at least have dinner 
amidst all of this turmoil. But here again, the food had spoiled because
 another Black Man, John Standard invented the refrigerator.

Now, isn&apos;t that something? What would this country be like without the contributions of Blacks, as African-Americans? 

Martin
 Luther King, Jr. said, &apos;by the time we leave for work, millions of 
Americans have depended on the inventions from the minds of Blacks.&apos;

Black
 history includes more than just slavery, Frederick Douglass, Martin 
Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Marcus Garvey&amp;W.E.B. Dubois. PLEASE SHARE! Knowledge is POWER!

 FEMA, FCC Announce Nationwide Test of the Emergency Alert System  

 Similar to local Emergency Alert System tests, this test is scheduled for November 9, 2011 

   

 The U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security&apos;s Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will conduct the 
first
 nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System (EAS ). The national test will occur on Wednesday, November 9 at 1 p.m. (CST) will last 30 seconds . 

   

 The EAS is a
 national alert and warning system established to enable the President 
of the United States to address the American public during emergencies. NOAA&apos;s National Weather Service, governors and state and local 
emergency authorities also use parts of the system to issue more 
localized emergency alerts.  

   

 Similar to 
local EAS tests that are already conducted frequently, the nationwide 
test will involve broadcast radio and television stations, cable 
television,
 satellite radio and television services and wireline video service 
providers across all states and the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S.
 Virgin Islands and American Samoa. 

   

 On November 9, the public will hear a message indicating that &quot;This is a test.&quot;  The

 audio message will be the same for both radio and television. Under the
 FCC&apos;s rules, radio and television broadcasters, cable operators, 
satellite digital audio radio service providers, direct broadcast 
satellite service providers and wireline video service
 providers are required to receive and transmit presidential EAS 
messages to the public. A national test will help the federal partners 
and EAS participants determine the reliability of the system and its 
effectiveness in notifying the public of emergencies
 and potential dangers nationally and regionally. 

   

 &quot;A national 
test of our Emergency Alert System, with the vital communications 
support and involvement of participants, is a step towards ensuring that
 the
 alert and warning community is prepared to deliver critical information
 that can help save lives and protect property,&quot; said Damon Penn, FEMA&apos;s
 Assistant Administrator of National Continuity Programs. &quot;Because there
 has never been an activation of the Emergency
 Alert System on a national level, FEMA views this test as an excellent 
opportunity to assess the readiness and effectiveness of the current 
system. It is important to remember that this is not a pass or fail 
test, but a chance to establish a baseline for
 making incremental improvements to the Emergency Alert System with 
ongoing and future testing. It is also important to remember that the 
Emergency Alert System is one of many tools in our communications 
toolbox, and we will continue to work on additional
 channels that can be a lifeline of information for people during an 
emergency.&quot; 

   

 &quot;The 
upcoming national test is critical to ensuring that the EAS works as 
designed,&quot; said Jamie Barnett, Chief of the FCC&apos;s Public Safety and 
Homeland Security
 Bureau. &quot;As recent disasters here at home and in Japan have reminded 
us, a reliable and effective emergency alert and warning system is key 
to ensuring the public&apos;s safety during times of emergency. We look 
forward to working with FEMA in preparation for
 this important test.&quot; 

   

 Over the 
past two years and as part of ongoing national preparedness planning 
efforts, FEMA, the FCC and other federal partners, state, local, tribal 
and
 territorial governments, Emergency Alert System participants and other 
stakeholders have been working toward making this test a reality.  

   

 As the 
federal, state, tribal, territorial and local governments prepare for 
and test their capabilities, this event serves as a reminder that 
everyone
 should establish an emergency
 preparedness kit and emergency
 plan for themselves, their families, communities, and businesses. Anyone can visit www.Ready.gov for more information about how to prepare for and stay informed about what to do in the event of an actual emergency.

Vernice Armour

as seen on Oprah!


The First African-American Woman Combat Pilot

Vernice Armour has family that still lives in the Chatham Community

Vernice Armour: The First African-American Woman Combat Pilot

Source: Black-Collegian.com

By Howard Mann

Vernice Armour follows a long line of military achievers. Her stepfather and one of her grandfathers were former Marines. Her father was in the Army. But she didn&apos;t receive a rousing round of applause when she opted to follow their trail.



&quot;My stepdad didn&apos;t want me to go in the Marine Corps,&quot; said Armour, who years earlier spent some time in the Army. &quot;He thought it would be too hard and he didn&apos;t like the way they treated women. He was in Vietnam for a couple of tours, but I told him it&apos;d be different. I was going in as an officer – 30 years down the line – and going into aviation.

&quot;The biggest thing was, ‘If I don&apos;t do it, who will?&apos;&quot;

Armour read about &quot;it&quot; in an article by Lt. Col. Charles Boyd, USMC, who issued a call for the first African-American female pilot. Boyd stated that the Marines were looking for &quot;a special woman who possesses the attitude of a winner, the self-confidence of a dreamer, and the commitment of a pioneer.&quot;

Armour embraced the idea right away.

&quot;It was a challenge,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&apos;t believe it at first. ‘I&apos;ll be first? No one has done this already?&apos; For me, it was even more important. It&apos;s a legacy. We&apos;re standing on so many shoulders, and that was just a promising opportunity.&quot;


She earned her wings on July 13, 2001, ranking No. 1 out of her class of 12 and of the last 200 to graduate from flight school. The Marine Corps&apos; first African-American female pilot, she also become the first in any branch to see combat, serving two tours in Iraq between 2003-2004.

&quot;It was intense,&quot; she said. &quot;It was exciting. It was scary. Fearful sometimes. There were real people trying to shoot at you.&quot;

Armour piloted the famed AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter. One of her most memorable experiences involved her sector being called in to support Marines and soldiers being held down on the ground by indirect mortar fire. Several months later, she was at a hospital talking to a young Marine who told her about a Cobra that helped them out when they were pinned down.

&quot;We paired it up and discovered it was the same mission,&quot; she said. &quot;He looked at me and said, ‘Ma&apos;am, you saved my life.&apos; Everybody over there is watching each other&apos;s back. I&apos;m there to protect men and women on the ground. That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about for me.

&quot;Everyone&apos;s flying and providing air support, protecting people on the ground who are under attack,&quot; she said. &quot;All that political stuff we&apos;re talking about over here doesn&apos;t matter. We&apos;re just concerned about staying alive.&quot;

More than just staying alive, Armour has focused on living her life to the fullest. Prior to joining the Marines, the former Army reservist and ROTC member at Middle Tennessee State made history in Nashville . Armour was the first African-American woman and just the second woman overall on the Nashville Police Department&apos;s motorcycle squad.

While stationed outside San Diego at Camp Pendleton , after flight school, Armour exhibited her athletic prowess. She was named Camp Pendleton &apos;s Female Athlete of the Year in 2001, and was a two-time titleholder in the camp&apos;s annual Strongest Warrior competition. She also played running back for a women&apos;s pro football team, the San Diego Sunfire.

Armour knew she was setting a precedent as a Marine. But she didn&apos;t realize the extent of her history-making experience until she got a surprise phone call from the Oprah Winfrey show while stationed in Iraq in 2003.

&quot;When Oprah wanted me to be on the show, I thought it was just for being the first (black female pilot) in the Marine Corps,&quot; she said. &quot;Turns out I was the first in American history out of all the branches of service.



&quot;I was on the show via the phone, and my mom and dad were actually there,&quot; she said. &quot;I was surprised, but not completely. Legislation (allowing women to fly in combat) had just been changed in 1993, and we hadn&apos;t had another war with combat since then.&quot;

Armour has moved on to fight a different sort of battle, helping women and minorities learn how to excel. She departed from the Marines in June 2007 to focus on instilling others with same goal-oriented passion that&apos;s driven her for so long, serving as a speaker, trainer and coach.


&quot;I&apos;m not a motivational speaker,&quot; she said. &quot;I like to call myself your leadership coach for the 21st century leader, a catalyst for change. I want to share my message of ‘EXCELERATED&apos; passion. You acknowledge your obstacles but stay focused on your goals. Acknowledge your obstacles but don&apos;t give them power.

&quot;When you fall off that horse, fail that test, or don&apos;t make it, you get up and do it again right now,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;You have to harness that emotion – which is raw energy – and focus on your goal.&quot;

Armour said her experiences and &quot;firsts&quot; give her a unique platform, and she&apos;s been called to inspire others. She also wants to help corporations, businesses and organizations learn to appreciate diversity, learn to let individuals strengthen the team without leaving their identities at the door.

She said it&apos;s important to realize and recognize the &quot;outrageous legacy&quot; of forebears who made a way for her generation and today&apos;s youth. &quot;That I&apos;m able to represent for ancestors and give back just a little bit, is a blessing in itself.&quot;

Her company, VAI Communications for Change (www.vernicearmour.com) is located outside Washington , D.C. , near Quantico Marine Corps Base. Armour&apos;s Website features pictures of her on magazines, books and TV, a list of previous engagements, and a number of testimonials, including one from noted motivational speaker Les Brown.



&quot;I&apos;ve shared the stage with hundreds of great speakers over the past 20 years and they all better take notice because Vernice Armour is a force, a powerhouse and I highly recommend her to you,&quot; Brown says. &quot;She will change your life.&quot;

Just like joining the Marine Corps changed her life.

Is this a formula that can obliterate racial academic achievement gap?

It&apos;s Supergirl: 5-year-old, Queens, N.Y. prodigy can speak seven languages, play six instruments



BY Erica Pearson

DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER

Sunday, May 15, 2011



Five-year-old Mabou Loiseau plays the piano in her home in Queens, New York (photo by Craig Warga/News)



Seven languages. Six musical instruments. Two types of dance and two sports. It all adds up to one busy little Queens girl.

Five-year-old Mabou Loiseau&apos;s parents spend $1,500 a week on tutors and lessons - and she spends seven hours a day in some type of instruction, with Sundays off.

She grew up speaking French, Creole and English, but her immigrant parents didn&apos;t want to stop there. She&apos;s also learning Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic and Russian.

&quot;Russian is my most favorite. I just hear something, and if I don&apos;t understand I say, &apos;What does that mean?&apos; and they&apos;ll tell me,&quot; said Mabou, whose Laurelton house is plastered with flashcards in different languages.

She can sing her ABCs in Spanish, count in Mandarin, read fairytales in Russian, and already has an ambitious list of career goals.

&quot;I want to be a firefighter, and I want to be a doctor, and I want to be a dancer, and I want to be a princess,&quot; Mabou said with a smile, sitting shyly on her mom&apos;s lap. &quot;And I want to be an actor, and I want to be a musician, and I want to be a singer, and I want to be a veterinarian, and I want to be a mom.&quot;

Mabou has her own dance studio with a mirrored wall where she learns tap and ballet. Her mom recently got rid of the kitchen table to make room for a full-size drum set. She&apos;s also learning to play the harp, clarinet, violin, guitar and piano. When she&apos;s not taking ice-skating or swimming lessons.

&quot;All the sacrifices in the world for her,&quot; said her mom, Esther Loiseau, a piano teacher who taught French at an American school before leaving Haiti for Queens 15 years ago. &quot;Furniture is not important. Education is.&quot;

Loiseau, 47, said friends and neighbors were initially shocked that she was starting Mabou on such a regimen so early - instead of just letting her be a kid.

&quot;But I make sure I leave enough time for her to play,&quot; Loiseau said. &quot;All she knows is learning. What becomes fun for someone is what they know.&quot;

Loiseau tells the tutors to play with Mabou, speaking in their native language, for half of the lesson. They spend the other half reading, writing and practicing vocabulary.

She said a sure way to make the opinionated only child behave is to threaten to cancel one of her lessons - especially Russian.

&quot;It&apos;s a great experience for me, honestly. A lot of even adult people can&apos;t understand what she does,&quot; said Rogneda Elagina, 24, Mabou&apos;s Russian tutor. &quot;We like to read together ... we started with the alphabet and connecting letters, and now she can read real folklore.&quot;

Mabou&apos;s dad works 16 hours a day as a parking attendant in Manhattan to pay for everything, and the Loiseaus have also started hosting other students for classes at their house.

The proud parents homeschool Mabou but found out last week that she scored in the 99th percentile on the city test for gifted and talented schools.

&quot;Honestly, I just want to open doors for my daughter,&quot; said Loiseau. &quot;She is really my princess.&quot;

Chinese Children to Dominate!


Tiger Mothers: Raising Children The Chinese Way

by Maureen Corrigan



January 11, 2011


Amy Chua may well be nuts. What kind of a mother hauls her then-7-year-old daughter&apos;s dollhouse out to the car and tells the kid that the dollhouse is going to be donated to the Salvation Army piece by piece if the daughter doesn&apos;t master a difficult piano composition by the next day? What kind of a mother informs her daughter that she&apos;s &quot;garbage&quot;? And what kind of mother believes, as Chua tells readers she does, that: &quot;an A- is a bad grade; ... the only activities your children should be permitted to do are those in which they can eventually win a medal; and ... that medal must be gold&quot;?




Amy Chua

What kind of a mother? Why, a mother who&apos;s raising her kids the Chinese, rather than the Western, way. In her new memoir, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Chua recounts her adventures in Chinese parenting, and - nuts though she may be - she&apos;s also mesmerizing. Chua&apos;s voice is that of a jovial, erudite serial killer - think Hannibal Lecter - who&apos;s explaining how he&apos;s going to fillet his next victim, as though it&apos;s the most self-evidently normal behavior.



That&apos;s the other gripping aspect of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother: There&apos;s method to Chua&apos;s madness - enough method to stir up self-doubt in readers who subscribe to more nurturing parenting styles. Trust me, Battle Hymn is going to be a book club and parenting blog phenomenon; there will be fevered debate over Chua&apos;s tough love strategies, which include ironclad bans on such Western indulgences as sleepovers, play dates, and any extracurricular activities except practicing musical instruments ... which must be the violin or piano.


The back story to Chua&apos;s memoir is this: She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants and is now a professor at Yale Law School and the author of two best-selling &quot;big-think&quot; books on free-market democracy and the fall of empires. When Chua married her husband, fellow Yale law professor and novelist Jed Rubenfeld, they agreed that their children would be raised Jewish and reared &quot;the Chinese way,&quot; in which punishingly hard work - enforced by parents - yields excellence; excellence, in turn, yields satisfaction in what Chua calls a &quot;virtuous circle.&quot;


The success of this strategy is hard to dispute. Older daughter Sophia is a piano prodigy who played Carnegie Hall when she was 14 or so. The second, more rebellious daughter, Lulu, is a gifted violinist. Chua rode the girls hard, making sure they practiced at least three hours a day even on vacations, when she would call ahead to arrange access to pianos for Sophia in hotel lobby bars and basement storage rooms. Chua also rarely refrained from criticizing her daughters, and in one of the many provocative passages that fill her book, she explains: Chinese parents can do things that would seem unimaginable - even legally actionable - to Westerners.

Chinese mothers can say to their daughters, &quot;Hey fatty - lose some weight.&quot; By contrast, Western parents have to tiptoe around the issue, talking in terms of &quot;health&quot; and never ever mentioning the f-word, and their kids still end up in therapy for eating disorders and negative self-image. ... Western parents are concerned about their children&apos;s psyches. Chinese parents aren&apos;t. They assume strength, not fragility, and as a result they behave very differently.


As Chua admits, though, the Chinese model doesn&apos;t dwell on happiness, nor does it deal well

with failure. (Some of the most hilarious parts of her memoir deal with her attempts to apply Chinese parenting methods to the family&apos;s two dopey Samoyed puppies.)


I was on my living room couch, reading the end of Chua&apos;s memoir, when my 12-year-old

daughter came downstairs and announced that she had &quot;done enough reading&quot; for one day and that since she had also practiced flute (for 15 minutes) she was going to kick back and watch TV - in this case, a made-for-TV Disney movie. Chua tartly sums up the stereotypically &quot;Western&quot; Disney plot this way:


&quot;In Disney movies,&quot; she says, the [studious kid] always has to have a breakdown and realize that life is not all about following rules and winning prizes, and then take off her clothes and run into the ocean or something like that. But that&apos;s just Disney&apos;s way of appealing to all the people who never win any prizes. Winning prizes gives you opportunities, and that&apos;s freedom - not running into the ocean.&quot;


I looked over at my daughter and had mixed feelings about her just chillin&apos; in front of the TV, rather than plugging away in that virtuous circle of enforced practice. I guess we won&apos;t be sending out the invitations for Carnegie Hall anytime soon.

&quot;Every child is a genius. Once you identify the talent of a child and put them in the environment that will nurture that talent, then the sky is the limit.&quot;

Britain&apos;s Brainiest Family is Black and Has 9-Year-Old High School-Bound Twins



By Ruth Manuel-Logan

Paula and Peter Imafidon are just like any other 9-year-olds. They love laughing, playing on the computer and fighting with each other. What sets these twins apart from their peers, though, is that they are, hands down, prodigies who are about to enter high school and make British history as the youngest to do so.

The precocious London-based tykes, known as the &quot;Wonder Twins,&quot; floored academics a year ago when they aced University of Cambridge&apos;s advanced mathematics exam. They are the youngest students to ever pass the test.

The future little scholars&apos; father, Chris , and mother, Ann, immigrated to Britain from Nigeria more than 30 years ago and have actually been down this prodigy route before with their three older children, who are also overachievers.

The couple&apos;s oldest daughter, Anne-Marie , is now 20, but at age 13, she won a British government scholarship to take undergraduate courses at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Christiana , 17, their other daughter, is the youngest student ever to study at the undergraduate level in any British University at the age of 11. Youngest daughter, Samantha , now 12, passed two rigorous high school level mathematics and statistics exams at the age of 6. She mentored the twins to pass their own math secondary school test when they were also 6.

Even with all of this, the proud dad denies that there is any particular genius in his family. He does credit his children&apos;s success to the Excellence in Education program for disadvantaged inner-city youth. &quot;Every child is a genius,&quot; he said. &quot;Once you identify the talent of a child and put them in the environment that will nurture that talent, then the sky is the limit. Look at Tiger Woods or the Williams sisters -- they were nurtured. You can never rule anything out with them. The competition between the two of them makes them excel in anything they do.&quot;

The darling duo are competitive to say the least, and this is what fuels them to out-achieve each other. Paula said, &quot;I am excited to pass, but I should have got higher than Peter.&quot;

As far as career paths Paula says she wants to be a math teacher, while Peter aspires to be prime minister one day.

All it takes is a dream....

 $$ TIPS ON PUMPING GAS $$ 

(Will save you gasoline and money)
From an N&apos;Spirational Conversations reader: Enjoy!

I don&apos;t know what you guys are paying for gasoline.... but here in
California we are paying up to $3.75 to $4.10 per gallon.

My line of work is in petroleum for about 31 years now, so here are some tricks to get more of your money&apos;s worth for every gallon:

Here at the Kinder Morgan Pipeline where I work in San Jose ,

CA we deliver about 4 million gallons in a 24-hour period thru the pipeline.. One day is diesel the next day is jet fuel, and gasoline, regular and premium grades.

We have 34-storage tanks here with a total capacity of 16,800,000 gallons.

Only buy or fill up your car or truck in the early morning when the ground temperature is still cold. Remember that all service stations have their storage tanks buried below ground. The colder the ground the more dense the gasoline, when it gets warmer gasoline expands, so buying in the afternoon or in the evening....your gallon is not exactly a gallon. In the petroleum business, the specific gravity and the temperature of the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, ethanol and other petroleum products plays an important role.

A 1-degree rise in temperature is a big deal for this business. But the
service stations do not have temperature compensation at the pumps.

When you&apos;re filling up do not squeeze the trigger of the nozzle to a fast
mode If you look you will see that the trigger has three (3) stages: low,
middle, and high. You should be pumping on low mode, thereby minimizing the vapors that are created while you are pumping. All hoses at the pump have a vapor return. If you are pumping on the fast rate, some of the liquid that goes to your tank becomes vapor. Those vapors are being sucked up and back into the underground storage tank so you&apos;re getting less worth for your
money.

One of the most important tips is to fill up when your gas tank is HALF
FULL. The reason for this is the more gas you have in your tank the less air occupying its empty space. Gasoline evaporates faster than you can imagine.


Gasoline storage tanks have an internal floating roof. This roof serves as
zero clearance between the gas and the atmosphere, so it minimizes the
evaporation. Unlike service stations, here where I work, every truck that we load is temperature compensated so that every gallon is actually the exact
amount.

Another reminder, if there is a gasoline truck pumping into the storage
tanks when you stop to buy gas, DO NOT fill up; most likely the gasoline is being stirred up as the gas is being delivered, and you might pick up some of the dirt that normally settles on the bottom.

To have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of gas buyers. It&apos;s
really simple to do.

I&apos;m sending this note to about thirty people. If each of you send it to at
least ten more (30 x 10 = 300)...and those 300 send it to at least ten more
(300 x 10 = 3,000) and so on, by the time the message reaches the sixth
generation of people, we will have reached over THREE MILLION consumers


!!!!!!! If those three million get excited and pass this on to ten friends
each, then 30 million people will have been contacted!

If It goes one level further, you guessed it..... THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE!!!

Again, all you have to do is share this with10 people.
Remember, what goes around good, comes back good to you!

 Top 10 Ways Merchant Companies Rip You Off...And How To Stop Them...For Good! 


 
 You are either a new business looking for your first merchant account, or you&apos;re an existing one looking for better rates or better service. Either way, you are going to remember the day you found Total Merchant Success. I know that sounds rather self serving, but once you read this document and understand what sets our company apart it should be a conclusion you will willingly confirm for yourself. 
 
 Did you know that in the merchant serviceindustry there are currently between 20 to 30 methods that are regularly used to increase your merchant account fees. Most of these are applied without you ever noticing. When they are noticed they are seldom understood and even much less questioned. In this revealing ebook we are ripping the cover off these scams and exposing their detrimental effects on average business owners and consumers alike. Information is power. As you read this document you should find yourself becoming increasing empowered to take control over a segment of your business that will make up one of your largest single income sources. If statistics and predictions are correct, your merchant account will increasingly make up a larger and larger portion of your overall income flow. This is due to how the entire world is becoming highly automated and technologically connected. Right now the credit card industry is already processing some GLOBAL transactions. Soon this will become commonplace as the world grows smaller and as paper and coin monies are used less and less. In this new ecommerce world your merchant account will be more and more valuable. You therefore owe it to yourselves to become as informed as possible. We want to help you do this. In fact, our entire business model is built upon the premise that we win, we realize success, only as we help you do the same. 
 
 Rip Off # 1The “Promise of a new LOWER RATE” Trick: This is the most popular, yet seldom caught rip off. It&apos;s also the number one question that business owners ask when looking for a new merchant service company. What is your discountrate? Often, if a company can answer with the lowest number they get the sale. What the business owner does not realize is that hidden behind that fantastic rate, the one you are now bragging about to your friends, is an unknown tactic that&apos;s about to bite you in the wallet over and over again. I know, I know, you are about to say, &quot;If they promise you a rate in writing they have to stand by that rate, or it&apos;s against the law.&quot; And you are right. However, the way they legally do this is to wait for Banks to move first and then they are no longer bound. For example, did you know that Visa, Master Card and all the others execute a rate increase between one and three times a year? When this happens your merchant service company uses this unfortunate occasion to pad their own bank accounts. Not only do they pass this mandatory increase on to you, they conveniently add a little increase for themselves, and this is all perfectly legal. 
 
 For Example: Let&apos;s say your rate is 1.95% when you start. Then, sometime shortly after this Visa applies a Global Rate Increase of.03%. Your rate would automatically go up to 1.98%. But the majority of merchant card companies use this as an opportunity to simultaneously add an increase of their own. Let&apos;s just say they add the same .03%. Now your rate, which started at 1.95%, has shot up to 2.01%. That may not sound like a lot, but over a year’s time it can quickly add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars depending on the size of the merchant account. 
 
 Here is a fact that ought to help you understand how these merchant card companies can get away with this systematic rip off. Whenever we are asked to give a business owner a quote for new service we always ask them to give us their past three or four months of merchant history to evaluate. We obviously cannot do this with a brand new business, but with an existing one this helps us to give a comparable quote that is based on their processing history. We are frequently shocked to find many merchants who have never opened their processing account statements. One of the reasons why they don’t open their statements is because they trust that the merchant service company is going to honor their word and not increase their rates and fees! When we ask about this another reason we frequently hear is that they are too busy and all they care about is the money that goes into their bank. They focus on the bank and not that little bandit that lurks just outside the bank, the one that&apos;s quietly scamming thousands... and that&apos;s a big mistake, one we hope you will not make yourself. 
 
 The Cure #1 The “Pass Through” Solution: At Total Merchant Success we have a great cure for this rip off. First, we not do play the rate game at all. Instead we offer something that is much more valuable to every business owner. We guarantee that once we set your rate we will not increase that rate BEYOND that of Visa, Master Card or the others. We call this the &quot;pass through guarantee&quot;. Instead of padding our rates we open the gates and we refuse to be led only by greed. Don&apos;t misunderstand us here. We are not saying that money is not important to us. Not at all. In fact, we believe that our philosophy of business is so appreciated by other business owners that we make more money than many of our competitors. The reason for this can be found in a very simple principle: &quot;Give and it will be given back to you, in greater measure.&quot; Instead of seeking a business relationship that lasts only up to the moment you discover our rip off techniques, we are seeking a LIFETIME CUSTOMER. Very few people leave our company. They can&apos;t afford to. We honestly do not know of a single merchant service company that has a TOTAL package that can beat our rates. That&apos;s why we call ourselves Total Merchant Success. If we can make an honest profit and keep you as a customer for life we will, in the end, make more money through volume than we would by having fewer customers who we are gouging and ripping off. If you are a business owner we believe that your business could benefit by adopting this principle as your own. By the way, we teach these principles to average business owners through our parent company, Total Biz Success. 
 
 Rip Off # 2 The “Charging Fees That Are Not Required” Scam: Is your current processor charging you a “Merchant Club Fee”, “Compliance Fee” or a “Membership Fee” for free paper, all of these types of fees are made up fees and if you are being charged them you are paying TOO much? These fees are not required by Visa or the other bank card companies. Although there are certain monthly fees that are required and in some cases even warranted, you should realize at the outset that most of these fees are negotiable and are charged at the whims and wants of the merchant service company and are often not required. Remember to ALWAYS ASK what a fee represents and to inquire if they are imposed from above or if they are negotiable. You may be pleasantly surprised at the answer. 
 
 The Cure #2 The “Freedom From Unnecessary Fees” Solution: At Total Merchant Success we do not pad our fees or add other unnecessary expenses just to earn a few extra dollars. Again, don&apos;t misunderstand. We love getting extra money. We love a raise, a bonus, a cash increase of any kind, just like the next guy. However, it&apos;s because we love this extra cash that we do not engage in these tactics. You see, if we can help you to be more successful you&apos;re going to spend more of your &quot;success dollars&quot; on growing your company. When your company grows our bank account grows right alongside you. We would much rather get our raise as a result of you getting yours FIRST. When merchant companies turn this principle into an everyday reality everyone wins. That&apos;s why many of our competitors go out of business so rapidly. They honestly believe they can make more money, more quickly, if they rip others off and take shortcuts to success. For some reason this kind of dysfunctional thinking is rampant in the card service industry. That&apos;s why you need to do some serious research before you sign a one to four year contract with a merchant processor. Once you sign that contract you are legally bound to their terms. Take this necessary business step seriously and you will save thousands of dollars every year. 
 
 Rip Off # 3The “Non-Qualified Transaction” Ploy:Most processes know that a business owner will pay more money for every transaction if they cannot verify the address from each customer. Address verification is just one of the many &quot;Risk Factors&quot; that go into the credit card rate and fee system, all of which is passed on to the average consumer. When you think about it, it really does make sense. Some people do misuse their credit cards and rack up huge sales with no intention of paying back what they owe. Therefore, the banks want to verify as much as they can about the one using the card. If they can get this information they are willing to reduce their fees in exchange for reduced risk. But if your merchant service company wants to use this little know fact to hide the extra expenses it can mean another source of revenue for them. You would be surprised how many actually do this. 
 
 The Cure #3The “AVS In Advance” Solution: Unfortunately, unless you request that your processor program your terminals to include AVS (address verification stamp) it may never happen. At Total Merchant Success we automatically program your AVS into every terminal. In fact we look for this and other ways to help you save money so you can have every advantage to succeed. This may sound like a small item when you consider the total scope of your business income. However, we learned long ago that all these &quot;small&quot; things add up quickly. So take our advice and avoid all Non-Qualified transactions in the future and save your hard earned money for that much needed vacation. 
 
 Rip Off # 4The “Free Things That Are Never Free” Scam: Most processes lure you in by offering to give you something free. This tactic is as old as the earth and probably existed during the cave man days, even before Geico. In fact, I think we are using this strategy very effectively with our promise to give you a free terminal (not bad, huh?). So obviously, we are not against this principle. What we are against, however, is the giving of things like &quot;free paper&quot; and &quot;free print ribbons&quot;and other such items when you know you are paying for these by increasing your fees for other items or services. 
 
 The Cure #4The “Value Over Time” Solution: You may rightly ask us how we are able to give away our free terminals. Don&apos;t we have to pay for these somehow and therefore aren’t we engaging in the same practice we are condemning? Great question and the answer is NO! Here&apos;s why. Yes, of course we have to pay for those terminals and we do that by giving you a very value based fee structure. What this means is that over the first year we use your fees to pay for these and other expenses. We only begin to make money after we prove our service to you and as you continue to use our service on into the later part of your contract. Again, we believe that if we do not try to gouge you with unfair costs your business will succeed and we will develop a win/win relationship. We don’t have to get rich quick. Instead we want to get EXTREMELY RICH more slowly and with a greater degree to certainty. 
 
 Rip Off # 5The “Don&apos;t Ask&amp;Don&apos;t Tell” Scam: If you are a business owner you MUST understand this rip off and do everything in your power to avoid being sucked into the ignorance that is at the source of this growing problem. Most of us know the difference between a credit card and a debit card. Most of us think our credit card terminals shouldknow that also. However, many people do not realize that unless the customer uses their debit card PIN NUMBER they are most likely not going to get the rate they expect, and neither are you as a business owner. You would think this one should be against the law. The fact is, business owners are often so busy that they do not read either instructions or directions, thus leaving themselves vulnerable to the very tactics that depend on ignorance to work. The merchant company does not have to tell this to the business owner, and if the owner never asks this little scam can add up to lot&apos;s of money over time. 
 
 The Cure #5The All Cards On The Table Solution: You might ask how these rip offs can go one when millions of people use credit cards. The answer is simple. Most new business owners know little about the ins and outs of running a business. That&apos;s why such a high percentage of them fail annually. We are Total Merchant Success want to see these numbers change. If more people approached business with the same philosophy we aspire to we would see more success. At the heart of our values is the commitment to put all our cards on the table. We not only give honest answers to all the questions our business owners bring to us, we go out of our way to INSTRUCT and to MENTOR each owner so that they are better prepared for the realities of the business world. This includes things like how to get the most out of debit cards. That&apos;s the motive behind this book. We know that we could use some of the tactics to add a few more dollars to our pockets. However, there is something more important in life than just money. We get a great deal of satisfaction from helping others succeed. That&apos;s why our main web site is Total BIZ Success. Our new membership site at this address is being constructed now, so look for it soon as a place to support the average business person. 
 
 Rip Off # 6The Secret Time Bomb: Most business owners never see this one coming. The reason is simple and it&apos;s even understandable. After all, how many times have you read EVERYTHING contained in a contract, especially when you feel the details were already discussed and understood. Wisdom tells us that we should always read our contract, but the fact is we often do not. Merchant Service companies count on this so they can position their new client for one of the most common rip offs in the industry. Here is how it works. Because most customers looking for service are mesmerized by THE RATE they often sign the contract once they think they have secured a good one. What they fail to see in the fine print is that after 6 months those great rates go up automatically (something they forgot to read). Next to slipping in a rate increase when Visa gives a global increase, this is one of the most popular rip offs on the market today. 
 
 The Cure #6The No Surprise Solution: If you want your customers to trust you there needs to be trust where it counts most, in the fine print. If you ever find techniques like the &quot;time bomb&quot; being used against you, you should immediately commit yourself to changing service providers as soon as your contract allows. If they will treat you like a fool in the fine print they will do it any other time they can also. At Total Merchant Success we welcome our clients to read EVERYTHING in our contracts. They won&apos;t find anything we have not discussed; especially things like hidden rate increases that are tucked away in the smallest fonts available. This is not good business and it&apos;s a pure rip off. 
 
 Rip Off # 7The “We Never Thought You Would Succeed” Trap: Most business owners want their business to grow. However, many merchant companies write their contracts with the expectation that the company in question will NOT GROW. This rip off is especially cruel. We often see contracts that put the limit for &quot;the largest single purchase&quot; so low that when the company does begin to grow and to process larger transactions, the bank will often hold your money or penalize you for your OVER LIMIT transaction. 
 
 The Cure #7The “Great Expectation” Solution: Like all the other rip offs, this problem could have easily been avoided by writing the merchant contract correctly in the first place. The contract should be written with success in mind. There is absolutely no reason a merchant company would write a purchase limit so low unless it intentionally expects to capitalize on it later. Yet this is what we see all the time. How sad for the business owner to wake up one day only to see that his success has cost him dearly and in some cases may even shut him down. If the merchant bank kept $10,000 of your profits for over 40 days what would this do to your business? For some, it&apos;s enough to shut them down. 
 
 Rip Off # 8The “If It&apos;s Broke Don&apos;t Fix It” Scam: Did you know that if your merchant equipment is not working properly that it usually means the merchant processor makes more money off of you? No, I bet you did not know this one either. For example if a terminal doesn&apos;t have enough memory to hold the right programs your hand keyed transactions will cost you more because you have to remember that this industry is all built on RISK, and the more risk to the processor the more you as the merchant pays. Also, if the swiper is broken it means that all of your transactions have to be hand keyed in and your fees double because of the risk to the processor is greater. This is one of the MAIN reasons that many merchant companies only give away USED and REFURBISHED terminals. It is a well known fact that these will break down sooner than new equipment. 
 
 The Cure #8The “Let&apos;s Start New” Solution: The main way that Total Merchant Success solves this problem is to avoid much of it altogether by giving away BRAND NEW TERMINALS. That&apos;s right. We are one of the few companies who give brand new equipment with their initial offer. This equipment is not as likely to break down and thus it&apos;s not likely to cause the merchant extra expenses. We love the ideas that you can execute your business without a hitch. Business should be fun as well as profitable. We think the new equipment also look cool. We like that. We all think we are kind of cool so we like the thought that everyone we work with is also very cool. If you look on our web site you will see that everyone of the products we give away is new. We pride ourselves in offering you the very best 
 
 Rip Off # 9The “If You Catch Us We Are Sorry” Trick: Don’t expect anyone (and I mean anyone) to own or even to discuss this rip off. Believe us when we say that it happens and if you are with one of the big processors you might even watch for it. Here it is in a nutshell. Some of the large companies have a client list in the hundreds of thousands. Let’s just say they need to build a new building or expand their operations in other ways. Instead of going to the bank to secure a long term load for a few million they have another option. They can up your rate at any time IF THEY GIVE YOU A 15 DAY NOTICE. Read that statement again. Any merchant company has the right to increase their rates if they give the proper notice. They can also add a new fee to your account if they can justify it as a legitimate expense. Think of how much money could be raised if an annual fee of $25 was added to the accounts of 400,000 customers at one time. If you think this is a farfetched idea then think for a moment how many times you have called a company about a charge that you did not understand or appeared on your statement for no apparent reason. No think of the number of times you call about things like this AND THEY GET TAKEN OFF AND YOU RECEIVE A REFUND? If anyone calls the merchant company on this they can just say “I’m sorry, we will take that off.” But how many do you think will call? 
 
 The Cure #9The “Love Is Never Having To Say You’re Sorry” Solution: If you can’t trust your merchant service company you should find one you can trust. We work hard to earn your respect. We wouldn’t be writing a revealing ebook like this one if we did not intend to be transparent and honest with all our customers. We don’t want to depend on rip offs to build new buildings or to expand our business. We are banking on our company growing bigger and better than many others BECAUSE we don’t engage in trickery or deceit. To us, love is never having to say “I’m sorry I ripped you off, it won’t happen again.” Love is never engaging in this kind of behavior in the first place. 
 
 Drum Roll Please…..We are down to our last rip off: 
 
 Rip Off # 10The “You Need This Just In Case” Scam: Have you even been sold something you did not need? We all have, more often than we like to say. Well, one of the ways your merchant company ramps up your fees up is by adding services to your contract that you may not need. There are so many of these that we advise you to literally question EVERYTHING you don’t understand and most of the one’s you do. For example, small business owners are often sold a check recovery service that is only valuable if you experience over a certain amount of bad checks per year. Many stores receive few bad checks due to the nature of their business. For others this service may be a true value. For some merchant services companies it does not matter. If they can make an extra buck by getting you to “think” you need that service they will. So be aware and always ask questions. 
 
 The Cure #10The “Custom Fit” Solution: Our point is that no one contract fits everyone. That’s why we like to talk to the customer first and to find out their business needs. This way we can develop a CUSTOM PLAN that meets their needs. Of all the points we have shared this one is critical. All of the above rip offs could be avoided if you had two things: 1. An honest merchant servicecompanywho desires to build their business on honesty and trust. 2. A custom contract that fits the exact needs of the business owner. Very few of these are ever the same. 
 
 
 
 In Conclusion 
 
 We know that you are busy. We also know you don’t have time to readlots of research or to examine every company before you buy a product or service from them. We are exactly like you if truth be told. That’s why we at Total Merchant Success are constantly looking for companies that are LOOKING OUT FOR US, EVEN AS THEY TAKE OUR MONEY. These kinds of companies do exist. And when you find them it’s up to you to support them and help them become better. We hope to start a new underground revolution among average business owners who share these values. If we ban together we can make a significant difference and our companies will grow as a result. We have joined a new powerful company called PHILANTHROBIZ. This company is committed from their very foundations to teach the very best business principles, to create a network of likeminded business owners, and to encourage philanthropy and giving back as a way of life. Look for their new social network and membership site soon at PhilanthroBiz.com. It should be up and running by October 2007. Join the revolution with us. And in the meantime let’s get you one of those free terminals and write you a custom contract that will help to fuel your business into a new level of success. We love it when we can contribute to your growth. If you have ANY questions please call our toll free number at: 1-877-500-7445

90# on your telephone

I dialed &apos;0&apos;, to check this out, asked the operator, who confirmed that this was correct

so please pass it on . ... . (l also checked out Snopes.com.
This is true, and also applies to cell phones!)


PASS ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW

I received a telephone call last evening from an individual identifying
himself as an AT&amp;T Service Technician (could also be Telus) who was
conducting a test on the telephone lines. He stated that to complete the
test I should touch nine(9), zero(0), the pound sign (#), and then hang up.
Luckily, I was suspicious and refused.

Upon contacting the telephone company, I was informed that by pushing 90#,you give the requesting individual full access to your telephone line,
which enables them to place long distance calls billed to your home phone
number.

I was further informed that this scam has been originating from many local
jails/prisons DO NOT press 90# for ANYONE.


The GTE Security Department requested that I share this information with
EVERYONE I KNOW.


After checking with Verizon they also said it was true, so do not dial 90# for anyone !!!!!

PLEASE share with everyone you know!

MARK YOUR CALENDAR AUGUST 4TH

Also for all who are interested in really supporting this presidency and this president,
in honor of Barack Obama&apos;s birthday, Organizing For America and I are hosting
phone banks all over the country to recruit volunteers to get out the vote for the
mid-term elections that are coming up in less than 100 days.




Since his historic election, President Obama has been inundated with a barrage of venomous criticism. From the first cries calling for the failure of his administration by Vitter and Limbaugh to the media critique of his handling of the BP oil spill, his critics are unequivocal in telling us that he can do no right.

In the face of contrary evidence, “Birthers” rant that the President is not a US citizen and should be removed from office. Once closed by Senator Barry Goldwater, the “father” of modern conservatism, the Republican leadership has opened the doors of their party to the John Birch Society and other reactionary extremists. With cries of wanting to “take back OUR country” and “we want OUR America back,” the Tea Partiers clearly tell us that there is no room for his (The President’s) kind in their America – at least not in a position of leadership or Presidential Authority. Who remembers someone ever disrespectfully calling out “You Lie!” to either of the Bushes, Reagan, Ford or Nixon in the chambers of the US House of Representatives or someone openly carrying a loaded weapon to one of their political events?

For years our borders have been as porous as cheesecloth, but suddenly critics tell us the Administration is failing to live up to its responsibility to quell the flow of immigrants from our southern border. Without questioning the impact of our non-existent northern border on illegal immigration, reactionary responses from municipal to state governments tell us that if “Obama won’t do anything, we’ll stop these Mexicans from coming here.”

Living up to expectations, the actions of Fox News have denigrated from constant criticism of President Obama to their appeal, by the likes of Beck, to the basest elements in society to “revolt” against the oppressor Obama or to “spill the blood of tyrants to water the tree of Liberty .” Disappointingly, most mainstream media just turned its attention and focus to President Obama’s critics, while excluding a balanced assessment of the political landscape.

That having been said, there are millions out here who support the reasoned and measured approach of the President. We understand from the evidence he presents daily that he has an extraordinary, almost encyclopedic understanding of issues impacting this nation and the world. We see him lauded by his peers around the world as a “thinker” or as a no-nonsense leader who understands, and can articulate, the positions of friends and adversaries alike. While not addressing or achieving goals the way the media “puppeteers” would choose, HE GETS THE JOB DONE!!!

An overwhelming number of Americans elected President Obama and millions still support him, but too many of us do so silently. If the progressive agenda we elected the President to achieve is to be successful, we must help the President achieve it. We cannot allow the media to report from negative positions without challenge. Just as others demonstrate their hatred and disrespect of President Obama, we must actively demonstrate our support.

We call on ALL who support President Obama to take action. On August 4th, the President’s birthday, we ask those who support him to wear any campaign item from the Presidential election as a demonstration of our ongoing support. Bring out your old campaign paraphernalia.

If you don’t have caps, buttons or tee shirts, wear a red, white, and blue tri-color ribbon or clothing on August 4th. If nothing else, this simple demonstration of support for our President will provide a counteraction to the negativity that spews forth daily. We can do this. YES WE CAN. YES WE WILL.

Please share with your email list.

In the unlikely story that is America , there&apos;s never been anything false about hope.

~Barack Obama

The Great American Think-Off!
2010 Edition



The 2010 debate question has been released:
&quot;Do the wealthy have an obligation to help the poor?&quot; will be debated by four finalists on Saturday, June 12th.

We will accept essays of up to 750 words until April 1, 2010 (postmark date).

America’s premier amateur philosophy contest, The Great American Think-Off, releases its 2010 essay and debate question: &quot;Do the wealthy have an obligation to help the poor?&quot; In writing essays on this question, potential debaters may address individuals, groups, or nations as the essayist determines.

Entering the competition is easy. Just submit an essay of 750 words or less by April 1, 2010 (postmark date).

The key to writing a successful essay is to ground your argument in personal experience.

A panel of judges will select four finalists to come to New York Mills, Minnesota, for the final debate to be held June 12, 2010. The names of the four finalists, who each receive $500 plus travel, food and lodging expenses, will be announced May 1, 2010.

A Message from the President of the US.

On Tuesday, a catastrophic earthquake struck near Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed, but the death toll -- already in the thousands -- is climbing fast.

This is the worst earthquake to hit the area in more than 200 years. Entire communities have been ripped apart and as many as 3 million people have been directly affected, including tens of thousands of American citizens who are in Haiti.

Our neighbors in Haiti are racing to confront the enormous devastation -- and the OFA community can help.

Click here for more information about essential relief efforts and ways you can help today.

Footage is pouring in of homes collapsing, Haitians carrying injured family members, and hospitals being overrun in what was already the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.

I have directed my administration to respond with a swift, coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives. Personnel from the United States and our partners in the international community are on the ground in damaged areas right now, working side by side with the Haitian people. They&apos;re providing much-needed food, water, and sanitation supplies, saving lives and helping local communities start to rebuild.

Despite the fact that we are experiencing tough times here at home, I encourage those who can to reach out and help. It&apos;s in times like these that we must show the kind of compassion and humanity that has defined the best of our national character for generations.

Click here to find out what you can do:

http://my.barackobama.com/Haiti

As this story continues to unfold, I hope you will continue to keep the people of Haiti in your thoughts and prayers, as well as the many Haitian-Americans who have done so much to enrich our country and who are worried about friends and loved ones in this time of need.

Thank you,

President Barack Obama

The Illinois Text Messaging Ban

The new Illinois text messaging law goes into effect on January 1st, 2010.
According to the new law:


&quot;A person may not operate a motor vehicle on a roadway while using an electronic communication device
to compose, send, or read an electronic message&quot;
And goes on to define an electronic message as;
&quot;Electronic message&quot; includes, but is not limited to electronic mail, a text message, an instant message,
or a command or request to access an Internet site.&quot;





Please take note of following changes in the Illinois Cell Phone Laws. This might save you some money.
It might also facilitate discussion with your children ages 19 and under.
Visit this link for more information: http://www.drivinglaws.org/ill.php




As many of you know, Gov. Quinn has signed into law a set of new restrictions regarding use of cell phones while driving.
The law will take effect Jan. 1, 2010. I encourage everyone to know what the law stipulates and to begin these
safe-driving habits now. Here are the main points:





ON JANUARY 1, 2010 IT WILL BE ILLEGAL (in the state of Illinois) TO:



* send or read a text message while your car is in traffic, unless fully stopped due to a

blocked roadway (such as a train crossing). A stop sign or stop light does NOT waive

this restriction. You must place the car in park or neutral gear, or pull over to the side of the road and stop.



* send or read an email message while your car is in traffic, unless fully stopped due to a

blocked roadway (such as a train crossing). A stop sign or stop light does NOT waive

this restriction. You must place the car in park or neutral gear, or pull over to the side of the road and stop.



* use a cell phone in a SCHOOL or CONSTRUCTION zone without the use of a hands-free device.

In other words.......you cannot HOLD the cell phone while using it.



You must use a device (such as a Bluetooth headset or ear bud) which allows you to keep both hands on the wheel.

To use such a device you must have a compatible phone and must purchase and install the hands-free device itself.
Contact your cellular provider for specific information about products and services available for your cell phone.
(And don&apos;t forget your spouse and/or kids&apos; cell phones!)

Nearly everyone knows about the texting restriction since it was widely published and discussed in the media.
But fewer were aware that the law also applies to emails, and very few were aware of the restrictions
which apply to SCHOOL and CONSTRUCTION zones.

Fines for violation of these laws will start at $75.00, with higher fines expected for the most serious infractions.
Obviously, no fine can ever compensate for injuries or loss of life.

The law does NOT apply to use of a navigation device, such as a GPS system.

Please share this information with everyone, particularly teenage drivers and friends/family who do NOT live in Illinois
and may not be aware of the law.

Remember.......the law takes effect Jan. 1, 2010.......but abiding by it now will build good driving habits
and lessen the possibility of &quot;forgetting&quot; when January arrives.

America Without a Middle Class




Can you imagine an America without a strong middle class? If you can, would it still be America as we know it?

Today, one in five Americans is unemployed, underemployed or just plain out of work. One in nine families can&apos;t make the minimum payment on their credit cards. One in eight mortgages is in default or foreclosure. One in eight Americans is on food stamps. More than 120,000 families are filing for bankruptcy every month. The economic crisis has wiped more than $5 trillion from pensions and savings, has left family balance sheets upside down, and threatens to put ten million homeowners out on the street.

Families have survived the ups and downs of economic booms and busts for a long time, but the fall-behind during the busts has gotten worse while the surge-ahead during the booms has stalled out. In the boom of the 1960s, for example, median family income jumped by 33% (adjusted for inflation). But the boom of the 2000s resulted in an almost-imperceptible 1.6% increase for the typical family. While Wall Street executives and others who owned lots of stock celebrated how good the recovery was for them, middle class families were left empty-handed.

The crisis facing the middle class started more than a generation ago. Even as productivity rose, the wages of the average fully-employed male have been flat since the 1970s.





But core expenses kept going up. By the early 2000s, families were spending twice as much (adjusted for inflation) on mortgages than they did a generation ago -- for a house that was, on average, only ten percent bigger and 25 years older. They also had to pay twice as much to hang on to their health insurance.

To cope, millions of families put a second parent into the workforce. But higher housing and medical costs combined with new expenses for child care, the costs of a second car to get to work and higher taxes combined to squeeze families even harder. Even with two incomes, they tightened their belts. Families today spend less than they did a generation ago on food, clothing, furniture, appliances, and other flexible purchases -- but it hasn&apos;t been enough to save them. Today&apos;s families have spent all their income, have spent all their savings, and have gone into debt to pay for college, to cover serious medical problems, and just to stay afloat a little while longer.



Through it all, families never asked for a handout from anyone, especially Washington. They were left to go on their own, working harder, squeezing nickels, and taking care of themselves. But their economic boats have been taking on water for years, and now the crisis has swamped millions of middle class families.

The contrast with the big banks could not be sharper. While the middle class has been caught in an economic vise, the financial industry that was supposed to serve them has prospered at their expense. Consumer banking -- selling debt to middle class families -- has been a gold mine. Boring banking has given way to creative banking, and the industry has generated tens of billions of dollars annually in fees made possible by deceptive and dangerous terms buried in the fine print of opaque, incomprehensible, and largely unregulated contracts.

And when various forms of this creative banking triggered economic crisis, the banks went to Washington for a handout. All the while, top executives kept their jobs and retained their bonuses. Even though the tax dollars that supported the bailout came largely from middle class families -- from people already working hard to make ends meet -- the beneficiaries of those tax dollars are now lobbying Congress to preserve the rules that had let those huge banks feast off the middle class.

Pundits talk about &quot;populist rage&quot; as a way to trivialize the anger and fear coursing through the middle class. But they have it wrong. Families understand with crystalline clarity that the rules they have played by are not the same rules that govern Wall Street. They understand that no American family is &quot;too big to fail.&quot; They recognize that business models have shifted and that big banks are pulling out all the stops to squeeze families and boost revenues. They understand that their economic security is under assault and that leaving consumer debt effectively unregulated does not work.

Families are ready for change. According to polls, large majorities of Americans have welcomed the Obama Administration&apos;s proposal for a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA). The CFPA would be answerable to consumers -- not to banks and not to Wall Street. The agency would have the power to end tricks-and-traps pricing and to start leveling the playing field so that consumers have the tools they need to compare prices and manage their money. The response of the big banks has been to swing into action against the Agency, fighting with all their lobbying might to keep business-as-usual. They are pulling out all the stops to kill the agency before it is born. And if those practices crush millions more families, who cares -- so long as the profits stay high and the bonuses keep coming.

America today has plenty of rich and super-rich. But it has far more families who did all the right things, but who still have no real security. Going to college and finding a good job no longer guarantee economic safety. Paying for a child&apos;s education and setting aside enough for a decent retirement have become distant dreams. Tens of millions of once-secure middle class families now live paycheck to paycheck, watching as their debts pile up and worrying about whether a pink slip or a bad diagnosis will send them hurtling over an economic cliff.

America without a strong middle class? Unthinkable, but the once-solid foundation is shaking.

$5,000 Bounty




Father Michael Pfleger of the Faith Community of St. Sabina is offering
a $5,000 bounty on the head of anyone involved in the murder of our youth.

&quot;There have been 78 Chicago Public School students shot in two and a half months.
When the murder of Derrion Albert was shown on a video, we saw an outcry in the
city and in the nation but we are now being lulled back to sleep. We refuse to
become immune to our children being shot and killed...it may be cold and crass
but whatever it takes to send the message that you will not shoot our children
and get away with it.&quot;

The money for the billboards is coming from donations and not church funds.
St. Sabina&apos;s biggest supporter of the billboards is John Rogers of Ariel Investments.

After today&apos;s press conference, another family walked up to Pfleger to ask for help
in bringing their relative&apos;s murderer to justice. Their family member was shot
and killed in November of 2008 and the case went unsolved.

Embracing lifetime value

If you walk into a company-owned cell phone store to sign up for a contract, what are you worth?

Given the huge gross margins at AT&amp;T and Verizon and the standard two-year contract, I think it&apos;s easy to figure on more than $2000 in lifetime value.

If you ran a business where a customer represented an additional $2,000 in profit, how would you staff? How long would you make someone wait? If staff costs $25 an hour, how long would that extra person take to pay off?

Few businesses understand (really understand) just how much a customer is worth. Add to this the additional profit you get from a delighted customer spreading the word--it can easily double or triple the lifetime value.

So, a chiropractor might see a new patient being worth $2,500, easily. And yet... how much is she spending on courting, catering to and seducing that new customer? My guess is that $50 feels like a lot to the doc. Instead of comparing what you invest to the benefit you receive from the first bill, the first visit, the first transaction, it&apos;s important to not only recognize but embrace the true lifetime value of one more customer.

Write it down. Post it on the wall. What would happen if you spent 100% of that amount on each of your next ten new customers? That&apos;s more money than you have to spend right now, I know that, but what would happen? Imagine how fast you would grow, how quickly the word would spread.

Here&apos;s how you&apos;ll know when you&apos;ve really embraced this--a good customer at your podiatry practice (or supermarket or tax firm) walks out the door in a huff and you turn to your partner and say, &quot;There goes $74,000.&quot;

Things you can do to fight against H1N1

From our Favorite Dr Oz


The only portals of entry are the nostrils and mouth/throat.
In a global epidemic of this nature, it&apos;s almost impossible to avoid coming into contact with H1 N1 in spite of all precautions.


Contact with H1 N1 is not so much of a problem as proliferation is.

While you are still healthy and not showing any symptoms of H1 N1 infection, in order to prevent proliferation,
aggravation of symptoms and development of secondary infections, some very simple steps, not fully highlighted in most official communications, can be practiced (instead of focusing on how to stock N95 or Tamiflu):

1. Frequent hand-washing (well highlighted in all official communications).

2. &quot;Hands-off-the-face&quot; approach. Resist all temptations to touch any part of face (unless you want to eat or bathe.)

3. Gargle twice a day with warm salt water (use Listerine or Hydrogen Peroxide if you don&apos;t trust salt). H1N1 takes 2-3 days after initial infection in the throat! nasal cavity to proliferate and show characteristic symptoms.
Simple gargling prevents proliferation. In a way, gargling with salt water has the same effect on a healthy individual that Tamiflu has on an infected one. Don&apos;t underestimate this simple, inexpensive and powerful preventative method.

4. Similar to 3 above, clean your nostrils at least once every day with warm salt water, or hydrogen peroxide. *Not everybody may be good at Jala Neti or Sutra Neti (very good Yoga asanas to clean nasal cavities), but *blowing the nose softly once a day and swabbing both nostrils with cotton buds dipped in warm salt water is very effective in bringing down viral population.*

5. Boost your natural immunity with foods that are rich in Vitamin C (Amla and other citrus fruits). *If you have to supplement with Vitamin C tablets, make sure that it also has Zinc to boost absorption.

6. Drink as much of warm liquids (tea, coffee, etc) as you can. Drinking warm liquids has the same effect as gargling, but in the reverse direction. They wash off proliferating viruses from the throat into the stomach where they cannot
survive, proliferate or do any harm.


A word from me, Stay Focused!

Be conscious of your surroundings.

Illness begins in the head, before it even makes it to the body!

This is interesting . .. .

Margarine was originally manufactured to fatten turkeys. When it killed the turkeys, the people who had put all the money into the research wanted a payback so they put their heads together to figure out what to do with this product to get their money back. It was a white substance with no food appeal so they added the yellow coloring and sold it to people to use in place of butter. How do you like it? They have come out with some clever new flavorings..

DO YOU KNOW.. the difference between margarine and butter?

Read on to the end...gets very interesting!

Both have the same amount of calories.

Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams.

Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter, according to a recent Harvard Medical Study.

Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other foods.

Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few
only because they are added!

Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods.

Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less than 100 years .

And now, for Margarine..

Very high in Trans fatty acids.

Triple risk of coronary heart disease .
Increases total cholesterol and LDL (this is the bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol)

Increases the risk of cancers up to five fold..

Lowers quality of breast milk.

Decreases immune response.

Decreases insulin response.

And here&apos;s the most disturbing fact..... HERE IS THE PART THAT IS VERY INTERESTING!

Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC..

This fact alone was enough to have me avoiding margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated (this means hydrogen is added, changing the molecular structure of the substance).

You can try this yourself:

Purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or shaded area. Within a couple of days you will note a couple of things:

* no flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it (that should tell you something)

* it does not rot or smell differently because it has no nutritional value ; nothing will grow on it. Even those teeny weeny microorganisms will not a find a home to grow. Why? Because it is nearly plastic . Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast?

Share This With Your Friends......(If you want to &apos;butter them up&apos;)!

Chinese Proverb:
&apos;When someone shares something of value with you and you benefit from it, you have a moral obligation to share it with others.
Pass the BUTTER PLEASE

Sick for Profit Video


&quot;America&apos;s High Tech &quot;Invisible Man&quot;
By Tyrone D. Taborn

You may not have heard of Dr. Mark Dean. And you aren&apos;t alone. But almost everything in your life has been affected by his work..

See, Dr. Mark Dean is a Ph.D. from Stanford University. He is in the National Hall of Inventors. He has more than 30 patents pending. He is a vice president with IBM. Oh, yeah. And he is also the architect of the modern-day personal computer. Dr. Dean holds three of the original nine patents on the computer that all PCs are based upon. And, Dr. Mark Dean is an African American.

So how is! it that we can celebrate the 20th anniversary of the IBM personal computer without reading or hearing a single word about him? Given all of the pressure mass media are under about negative portrayals of African Americans on television and in print, you would think it
would be a slam dunk to highlight someone like Dr. Dean.

Somehow, though, we have managed to miss the shot. History is cruel when it comes to telling the stories of African Americans. Dr. Dean isn&apos;t the first Black inventor to be overlooked Consider John Stanard, inventor of the refrigerator, George Sampson, creator of the clothes dryer,
Alexander Miles and his elevator, Lewis Latimer and the electric lamp.
All of these inventors share two things:

One, they changed the landscape of our society; and, two, society relegated them to the footnotes of history. Hopefully, Dr. Mark Dean won&apos;t go away as quietly as they did. He certainly shouldn&apos;t. Dr. Dean helped start a Digital Revolution that created people like Microsoft&apos;s Bill Gates and Dell Computer&apos;s Michael Dell. Millions of jobs in information technology can be traced back directly to ! Dr. Dean.

More important, stories like Dr. Mark Dean&apos;s should serve as inspiration for African-American children. Already victims of the &quot;Digital Divide&quot; and failing school systems, young, Black kids might embrace technology with more enthusiasm! if they knew someone like Dr. Dean already was leading the way.

Although technically Dr... Dean can&apos;t be credited with creating the computer -- that is left to Alan Turing, a pioneering 20th-century English mathematician, widely considered to be the father of modern computer science -- Dr. Dean rightly deserves to take a bow for the machine we use today. The computer really wasn&apos;t practical for home or small business use until he came along, leading a team that developed the interio! r architecture (ISA systems! bus) that enables multiple devices, such as modems and printers, to be connected to personal computers.

In other words, because of Dr. Dean, the PC became a part of our daily lives . For most of us, changing the face of society would have been enough. But not for Dr. Dean.. Still in his early forties, he has! a lot of inventing left in him.

He recently made history again by leading the design team responsible for creating the first 1-gigahertz processor chip.. It&apos;s just another huge step in making computers faster and smaller. As the world congratulates itself for the new Digital Age brought on by the personal computer, we need to guarantee that the African-American story is part of the hoopla surrounding the most stunning technological advance the world has ever seen.. We cannot afford to let Dr.. Mark Dean become a footnote in history. He is well worth his own history book.

Our children ARE our responsibility!

We must all do what we can to insure their future as well as ours.  You can be of service by passing this info along to everyone and every organization that you know of that relates to our youth. This is an email from fellow community youth organizer:

Dear Friends of KOB;


We hope that this email finds you well. Our gratitude goes to those who have continually supported KOB throughout our short but succesful years of existence. It is with great disappointment that we announce that some of the youth involved in the summer job programs have lost their positions in the workforce due to a lack of funding. There were about 8 jobs that we&apos;re lost due to the cut.


We realize here at KOB, that this economic crisis has affected all of our communities. Furthermore, it gives youth an alternative into any kind of involvement in youth violence.As you may know, KOB has initiated the summer job program this June and for many it was shortly lived. With that said, we were inquiring as to any job openings that you may know of, or have open yourself. T


he youth have dilligently gone through the process of orientations and specific job trainings and would make an asset to any work environment. We are asking now more than ever that any possible opening be considered for KOB members.

Thank you in advance and thank you for your continual support.

Sincerely,

Kids Off The Block

Air Conditioner


Please do NOT turn on A/C as
soon as you enter the car. Open the windows after
you enter your car and turn ON the air-conditioningafter a couple of minutes.

Here&apos;s why:
According to a research, the car dashboard, sofa, air freshener emit Benzene, a Cancer causing toxin (carcinogen - take time to observe the smell
of heated plastic in your car). In addition to causing cancer, Benzene poisons your bones, causes anemia and reduces white blood cells. Prolonged exposure will cause Leukemia, increasing the risk of cancer. May also cause 
miscarriage. Acceptable Benzene level indoors is 50 mg per sq. ft.

A car parked indoors with windows closed will contain 400-800 mg of Benzene.

If parked outdoors under the sun at a temperature above 60 degrees F, the Benzene level goes up to 2000-4000 mg, 40 times the acceptable level...
People who get into the car, keeping windows closed will inevitably inhale,
in quick succession excessive amounts of the toxin. Benzene is a toxin that affects your kidney and liver. What&apos;s worse, it is extremely difficult for your body to expel this toxic stuff.

So friends, please open the windows and door of your car - give time for interior to air out -dispel the deadly stuff - before you enter. SHARE THE GOOD NEWS! What goes out, must come back!

LIFE WITH BIG BROTHER
Census GPS-tagging your home&apos;s front door
Coordinates being taken for every residence in nation


By Bob Unruh
© 2009 WorldNetDaily

GPS satellite

According to an online Yahoo program, the Global Position System coordinates for the White House, probably one of the best-known publicly owned buildings in the world, are 38.898590 Latitude and -77.035971 Longitude. And since you know that, it&apos;s no big deal for the White House to know the coordinates for your front door, is it?
Some people think it is, and are upset over an army of some 140,000 workers hired in part with a $700 million taxpayer-funded contract to collect GPS readings for every front door in the nation.
The data collection, presented as preparation for the 2010 Census, is pinpointing with computer accuracy the locations and has raised considerable concern from privacy advocates who have questioned why the information is needed. The privacy advocates also are more than a little worried over what could be done with that information.
Enhancing the concerns is the Obama administration&apos;s recent decision to put White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel in an oversight role over the census, which will be used to determine a reapportionment of congressional seats and could be used to solidify a single political party&apos;s control over the nation, its budget, military and future.
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke recently told the W ashington Post: &quot;The census director reports to me, and, of course, I serve at the pleasure of the president.&quot; He added the White House told him &quot;it has no interest in politicizing [the census].&quot;
But at American Daily Review, blogger Douglas Gibbs had more than a few doubts.

 

&quot;GPS coordinates of your front door will make it easier for the government to monitor you,&quot; he said.

&quot;The U.S. Census Bureau is simply an excuse – a harmless looking means of obtaining the front door coordinates. The creation of GPS coordinates for front doors has nothing to do with the census, in all honesty, no matter how much the United States government tries to convince you that it does.&quot;
Learn what America means, get &quot;The Patriot&apos;s Handbook: A Citizenship Primer for a New Generation of Americans&quot;
He recalled wondering why, just weeks ago, the Obama administration announced its oversight of the census, &quot;literally taking control of the census away from the Commerce Department.&quot;
He put that together with Obama&apos;s longtime push for national service.
&quot;The Obamites, thirsty to serve their new messianic figure, have lost enough of their objectivity to be willingly recruited into such an insidious program like gaining these coordinates for the U.S. government. … I ask again, what would be the purpose of shooting the GPS coordinates of American doorways?&quot; he wrote.
The answer he provided was alarming.
&quot;Imagine, if you will, that there are a number of people in a neighborhood that could not find the addresses they are tasked with finding. They are not locals, maybe are unable to read a map, or perhaps do not have the time to pull out a map, and they need to find you with specific GPS coordinates. Their devices would lead them to your front door with these coordinates.
Imagine a crisis is afoot, and martial law is put into place. U.S. troops need to round up particular folks,&quot; he wrote.
&quot;Let&apos;s take this a step further. After all, with Barack Obama desiring to decrease the number of folks in the military, and with forces committed worldwide, we may not have sufficient military forces at home to deal with a rising national emergency.

If the government decided to rely on foreign troops, perhaps United Nations personnel, most of which may not understand the street signs, much less know the lay of the land, they could use GPS devices to direct them to your front door,&quot; he wrote.

(does anyone remember after 911 how Bush thanked the many foreign pilots who flew combat aircraft along our borders to &quot;prevent terrorism at home&quot; (in actuality, a foreign national is a lot less likely to question an order to shoot or bomb civilians, if it&apos;s not his home country he is flying in). rs


According to the Census Bureau&apos;s website, the GPS technology &quot;allows us to reduce the amount of time spent by census workers in locating addresses. … Most importantly, by adding a GPS coordinate to each housing unit, the Census Bureau is able to ensure that residents are counted in the right location.&quot;
At Canada Free Press, commentator J.B. Williams said, &quot;I can&apos;t resist the urge to question the authority and purpose behind such a BIG BROTHER initiative, when the official census itself is not due to be taken until 2010…
&quot;No imagination is required to think up a whole laundry list of evil that could be done with a nationwide GPS grid of coordinate&apos;s markers painted on every private home across the country. But I was having trouble thinking up one good reason for it, even one legitimate use that would justify what must be a very expensive undertaking,&quot; he said.
&quot;Why does the Obama administration need or want the latitude and longitude coordinates for every home in America?
Why the rush to GPS paint every home in the next 90 days?
Why must the marker be within 40 feet of every front door?
For what possible purpose does the Fed need GPS coordinates for every home, and under what authority do they have the right?

Census workers, whom I asked, had the same holy-crap look on their faces that I had by then,&quot; he wrote.
Then he cited the cooperative effort that the U.S. Census Bureau has reached with ACORN, the organization of community activists with which Obama worked.
&quot;Obama&apos;s interest in an ACORN-controlled 2010 Census, for the purpose of redistricting to the advantage of Democrats before the 2010 mid-term elections, comes as NO shock from a regime known for their heavy handed Rules for Radicals political strategies. But what does this have to do with GPS marking every home in the country?&quot; he questioned.
Ask those who have served military duty, he said. They are very familiar with the most common use of GPS target painting, and the rest might want to read books such as &quot;The Precision Revolution: GPS and the Future of Aerial Warfare.&quot;
Online sources noted that Google Maps already probably has listed most homes in the nation.
&quot;But the front door? Sounds like a jackboot convenience to me,&quot; said RightSoup.com.
Added Williams, &quot;What I do know is this … Coincidences of this number and magnitude don&apos;t happen. … I also know that people had better start asking the right people the right questions and demanding answers fast. Begin with asking the mainstream press why there has been no public notification of the federal governments GPS marking your front door?&quot;
A number of concerned citizens have contacted WND about the program, and repeatedly have cited warnings delivered by the GPS squad members that their failure to allow the readings would result in fines and possibly imprisonment under Title 13, which allows the census to be taken.
But repeatedly they&apos;ve gotten no answers when asked what a GPS reading has to do with the number of people living at the home – which isn&apos;t supposed to be subject to questions until 2010 anyway.
One WND reader raised these questions to a local census office.
&quot;What authority does the U.S. Census Bureau have for sending anyone to my front door in April of 2009 to mark it with GPS coordinates? This is unacceptable. The census is not due until 2010, and the usurpation of the census by the White House is unconstitutional. … This citizen will not answer census questions until the year they are due, and demands that my GPS coordinates be removed from all government records.&quot;
The census response?
&quot;Address canvassing should conclude by mid-July. The operation will use new hand-held computers equipped with GPS to increase geographic accuracy. The ability to capture GPS coordinates for most of the nation&apos;s housing units will greatly reduce the number of geographic coding errors caused by using paper maps in previous counts. … During the address canvassing operation, census workers may ask to verify a housing structure&apos;s address and whether there are additional living quarters on the property. All census workers carry official government badges marked with just their name. You also may ask them for a picture ID from another source to confirm their identity. In addition, some census workers might carry a &apos;U. S. Census Workers&apos; bag.&quot;
Another WND reader, from Washington state, reported he is having his attorney look into the legality of the GPS data collection and hopes to have enough support for a legal challenge.
The reader, whose name was withheld because of his concerns over repercussions, said a government home data collector ignored his no trespassing sign, and he was threatened by the collector for wanting to refuse to provide &quot;census&quot; information.
He said GPS mapping nowhere is authorized for census workers.
Census spokesman Stephen Buckner told WND the activity is, in fact, proper, and even necessary. There are homes being built and torn down constantly, and the census needs such information. Local building records and other government databases such as tax records would not suffice, he said.
&quot;There are 140,000 workers walking every street of America,&quot; he told WND, in order to document 145 million addresses with GPS coordinates.
He assured WND that all such personal information is confidential, because employees of contractors doing the work are subject to a $250,000 fine or imprisonment for five years for revealing personal information. He also confirmed that the last case that was prosecuted under the law was nearly 50 years ago.
&quot;We have to verify every single address,&quot; he said.

BET to Launch New Network


Centric Will Target Affluent, Trendsetting Black Audience Beginning in October
by Andrew Hampp
Source: AdAge.com





The cable upfront season has already spawned announcements ranging from programming acquisitions and ventures into live action to new names. But tonight Viacom&apos;s BET Networks will announce the launch of a new network, Centric, at its presentation to advertisers in New York.



Centric, named for &quot;being at the center of the universe&quot; of black culture, BET CEO Debra Lee said, is slated to launch in October in nearly 45 million homes. The network is designed to target affluent, trendsetting black 25- to 54-year-olds with programming that resembles a black-skewing version of Bravo.



Scott Mills, president-chief operating officer of BET Networks, said Centric allows BET to focus on what he calls a &quot;very valuable segment&quot; of the black audience while simultaneously serving more-diverse viewers on BET&apos;s flagship channel. Centric likely will take the place of BETJ, a sibling network now in nearly 45 million homes. &quot;We are currently in discussions with our affiliate partners around the future of BETJ,&quot;
Mr. Mills said.


Among the new shows Centric will use to reach that valuable segment are &quot;Keeping Up With the Joneses,&quot; a &quot;Real Housewives&quot;-esque docu-soap chronicling the lives of high society in Houston; &quot;Model City,&quot; which
follows young black men trying to crack the New York modeling industry; and &quot;Urban Livin&apos;,&quot; billed as a &quot;chic lifestyle interio-design show.&quot; Centric will also focus heavily on music and revive the Soul Train Awards for a November event in Atlanta.

 The Times&apos;s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry.

Suppose you call my cell to leave me a message. First you hear my own voice: &quot;Hi, it&apos;s David Pogue. Leave a message, and I&apos;ll get back to you&quot;--and THEN you hear a 15-second canned carrier message.

(You hear a similar message when you call in to hear your own messages. &quot;You. Have. 15. Messages. To listen to your messages, press 1.&quot; WHY ELSE WOULD I BE CALLING?)


I, the voicemailbox owner, cannot turn off this additional greeting message. You, the caller, can bypass it, but only if you know the secret keypress--and it&apos;s different for each carrier. So you&apos;d have to know which cellphone carrier I use, and that of every person you&apos;ll ever call; in other words, this trick is no solution.


These messages are outrageous for two reasons. First, they waste your time. Good heavens: it&apos;s 2009. WE KNOW WHAT TO DO AT THE BEEP.





Do we really need to be told to hang up when we&apos;re finished!? Would anyone, ever, want to &quot;send a numeric page?&quot; Who still carries a pager, for heaven&apos;s sake? Or what about &quot;leave a callback number?&quot; We can SEE the callback number right on our phones!





Second, we&apos;re PAYING for these messages. These little 15-second waits add up--bigtime. If Verizon&apos;s 70 million customers leave or check messages twice a weekday, Verizon rakes in about $620 million a year. That&apos;s your money. And your time: three hours of your time a year, just sitting there listening to the same message over and over again every year.





In 2007, I spoke at an international cellular conference in Italy. The big buzzword was ARPU--Average Revenue Per User. The seminars all had titles like, &quot;Maximizing ARPU In a Digital Age.&quot; And yes, several attendees (cell executives) admitted to me, point-blank, that the voicemail instructions exist primarily to make you use up airtime, thereby maximizing ARPU.





Right now, the carriers continue to enjoy their billion-dollar scam only because we&apos;re not organized enough to do anything about it. But it doesn&apos;t have to be this way. You don&apos;t have to sit there, waiting to leave your message, listening to a speech recorded by a third-grade teacher on Ambien.





Let&apos;s push back, and hard. We want those time-wasting, money-leaking messages eliminated, or at least made optional.





I asked my Twitter followers for help coming up with a war cry, a slogan, to identify this campaign. They came up with some good ones:





&quot;Where&apos;s the Beep?&quot;
&quot;Let it Beep&quot;
&quot;We Know. Let&apos;s Go.&quot;
&quot;Lose the Wait&quot;
&quot;My Voicemail, My Recording&quot;
&quot;Hell, no, we won&apos;t hold!&quot;



My favorite, though, is the one that sounds like a call to action: &quot;Take Back the Beep.&quot;





And here&apos;s how we&apos;re going to do it.





We&apos;re going to descend, en masse, on our carriers. Send them a complaint, politely but firmly. Together, we&apos;ll send them a LOT of complaints.





If enough of us make our unhappiness known, I&apos;ll bet they&apos;ll change.





I&apos;ve told each of the four major carriers that they&apos;ll be hearing from us. They&apos;ve told us where to send the messages:





* Verizon: Post a complaint here: http://bit.ly/FJncH.





* AT&amp;T: Send e-mail to Mark Siegel, executive director of media relations: MS8460@att.com.





* Sprint: Post a complaint here: http://bit.ly/9CmrZ





* T-Mobile: Post a complaint here: http://bit.ly/2rKy0u





Three of the four carriers are just directing us to their general Web forums. Smells like a cop-out, I know. (As for AT&amp;T: Props to the guy for letting me publish his e-mail address! Hope he knows what he&apos;s in for!)





Yet all four carriers promise that they&apos;ll read and consider our posts. And we have two things going for us.





First, I have a feeling that the volume of complaints will be too big for them to ignore. To that end, I hope you&apos;ll pass these instructions along, blog them, Twitter them, and spread the word. (Gizmodo, Consumerist and others have agreed to help out.) And I hope you&apos;ll take the time to complain yourself. Do it now, before you forget.





Second, we&apos;ll all be watching. I&apos;ll be reporting on the carriers&apos; responses. If they ignore us, we&apos;ll shame them. If they respond, we&apos;ll celebrate them.





Either way, it&apos;s time to rise up. It&apos;s time for this crass, time-wasting money-grab to end for good.































The Mandatory 15-Second Voicemail Instructions



Suppose you call my cell to leave me a message. First you hear my own voice: &quot;Hi, it&apos;s David Pogue. Leave a message, and I&apos;ll get back to you&quot;--and THEN you hear a 15-second canned carrier message.



* Sprint: &quot;[Phone number] is not available right now. Please leave a detailed message after the tone. When you have finished recording, you may hang up, or press pound for more options.&quot;





* Verizon: &quot;At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up, or press 1 for more options. To leave a callback number, press 5. (Beep)&quot;





* AT&amp;T: &quot;To page this person, press five now. At the tone, please record your message. When you are finished, you may hang up, or press one for more options.&quot;





* T-Mobile: &quot;Record your message after the tone. To send a numeric page, press five. When you are finished recording, hang up, or for delivery options, press pound.&quot;





(You hear a similar message when you call in to hear your own messages. &quot;You. Have. 15. Messages. To listen to your messages, press 1.&quot; WHY ELSE WOULD I BE CALLING?)

Drivers to pay more at metered spots
The cost of visiting Chicago — or at least parking there — is about to go up.


Starting next week, the price of metered parking on city streets will climb.
Chicago Parking Meters says that the cost of parking in the Loop will climb
from $3.50 to $4.25 an hour. The price to park outside the Loop but in the
central business district will rise from $2.00 to $2.50 an hour. And parking
everywhere else in the city will be $1.25 an hour instead of the current
$1.00 an hour.



The rates on the meters will be changed throughout January, starting on
Jan. 4 in the Loop. Officials say they plans to change all the rates by the
end of the month, but motorists only have to pay the posted rates.

Entrepreneurs, Intra-preneurs, Edu-tainment preneurs and Game-preneurs.
 

 They all have something in common. 

 Finding your God given way to do things in life that can sustain you and your family is a gift.
 

 Entrepreneurship has become of way of life for many due to the devastating effects of the economy. In many countries,
 

 it’s the only way a family survives.

In America we became spoiled because the labor industry was already laid out for us and we didn’t have to think about it. 

 We simply applied for jobs and worked like everyone else. Well now that we’ve gone from agriculture industry to Technology industry, many of us are lost because we haven’t discovered our Natural God Given Gifts, Talents and Abilities!

For those who don’t know what their natural God given gifts, talents or abilities out, there is hope. Keep in mind, the light you see to help you read was discovered by a man who failed a thousand times. I never thought I could write a book, until someone told me I could. Try this:
 

 His Will.
 

 HisWord.
 

 HisWay. 




 We respect the religions of the world. 

 Whatever name you wish to call your 

 Higher Power, Inner Guide, Spirit, etc. that is your choice. It is also the choice for us to be ONE 

 with the ONE! 

 Be Blessed!

 CANCER is no longer a death sentence. 

 My High School girlfriend Karen McDaniels is a cancer survivor! She&apos;s walking the walk and talking the talk. If she can survive, you can too! 

 The following is info I received from a reader I think you can appreciate! 

 


Making the Cancer Connection: 

 How Networking with a Cancer Survivor Just Might Save Your Life
 
 When cancer comes up in conversation, do you change the topic and move on?

Or do you ask the questions that may possibly save your life or the life of someone you love?

Author and speaker Joni Aldrich tells you the top five questions to ask when the opportunity presents itself. 


 
No doubt about it: Cancer is a conversation stopper. It&apos;s a sad, scary subject, and most people would just as soon avoid it. If the &quot;C-word&quot; comes up at church, at work, or at a party, your first impulse is probably to change the subject or remove yourself from the group. That&apos;s a mistake, says author Joni Aldrich.


 Even if your life hasn&apos;t been touched by cancer—an unlikely scenario, by the way—there&apos;s a good chance it will be in the future. Rather than burying your head in the sand, why not look at the conversation as a networking opportunity? 
 

That&apos;s right—networking. By gathering valuable information and forging connections with others who are dealing with cancer, you might well make a lifesaving difference when someone you love is in the same grim situation. 
 &quot;We network all the time when we&apos;re looking to move up in our careers or promote our business or even find the right place to live,&quot; says Aldrich, author of The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer
(Cancer Lifeline Publications, 2009, ISBN: 978-1-4392550-3-2, $19.95, 
 www.thecancerlifeline.com)
and The Losing of Gordon:
A Beacon Through the Storm Called &quot;Grief&quot; (Cancer Lifeline Publications, 2009, ISBN: 978-1-4392649-3-5, $15.95, www.griefbeacon.com).


&quot;It&apos;s our best method of gathering information to helpus make smart decisions. Yet when it comes to a cancer discussion, many people turn away and run. It doesn&apos;t make logical sense. 
 &quot;Every single day 4,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with cancer,&quot; she adds.

&quot;One out of every 26 people is a cancer patient/survivor. If you&apos;re a betting person, you&apos;ll know that there&apos;s a good possibility that at some point cancer will invade your life or the life of someone you love.&quot; 


 Aldrich knows firsthand what it&apos;s like to live through a cancer war. In 2006, she lost her 45-year-old husband, Gordon, after a two-year battle against a rare form of cancer.


She released her first book—The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer—to tell the story of the Aldrich family&apos;s experiences while simultaneously offering valuable step-by-step advice that will give readers the tools they need to have a fighting chance against cancer. 
 


There were mistakes made at the first cancer treatment facility the couple trusted. Would things have been different had she and Gordon found the right treatment facility sooner? She&apos;ll never know, but Aldrich learned the hard way that &quot;knowledge is your armor, and the right cancer treatment is your weapon.&quot; That&apos;s why she feels that networking about cancer is important—even before it affects your world directly. 



 &quot;In my W-I-N method for finding the right cancer treatment facility and oncologist, the &apos;N&apos; stands for networking,&quot; explains Aldrich. &quot;Yes, cancer stories can be a downer, and it&apos;s certainly not a subject that you want to discuss all of the time. But rather than shut the dialogue down when the subject of cancer comes up, use the opportunity to gather as much information as you can—just in case you or someone you know needs the lifesaving facts that may be offered.&quot; 



 Aldrich adds that in her own experience, cancer survivors are among the best people, and they are usually more than willing to share their insights over adversity. 


 Read on for the top
five questions you should ask when making an important cancer connection: 



 1. What type and stage of cancer did you (or your loved one) have? This is an important question to ask because no two cancers are alike. And even if someone has been diagnosed with the same type of cancer as you, the stage of his or her particular diagnosis may be different, and that can mean a drastic change in the treatment regimen. 
 The stage of cancer is critical, too. If the patient&apos;s cancer was stage IV, the battle would have been an uphill climb—and completely different from the experience of a patient whose cancer was a stage I or II. 
 &quot;If you find yourself talking to a stage IV brain cancer survivor, or a pancreatic or esophageal cancer survivor, you&apos;ve found a golden opportunity,&quot; Aldrich explains. &quot;Take esophageal cancer—there is a low survival rate. While some cancers have low odds of survival, there aresurvivors out there. These are rare, but not so rare that it might not strike a family member or friend at sometime during your life, and they may be able to provide you with vital information that you need to know.&quot; 
 


2. What was the primary cancer treatment facility involved in your (or your loved one&apos;s) care? Aldrich says that one of the most important decisions you can make is where you receive your primary care. If you&apos;re a cancer novice, you may not know that all cancer treatment facilities are not created equal. The best facility for you should be determined by factors such as having the right equipment for your particular cancer needs, in addition to on-staff qualified oncologists and a cancer team who deal with your type of cancer on a regular basis. Even more importantly, not all facilities can treat every type of cancer—and that&apos;s information that you will want to know. 
 For example, some facilities do a lot of prostate cancer research, but only a handful will do research in multiple myeloma. And just because breast cancer is one of the more common types of cancer, it doesn&apos;t mean that it can be treated effectively at every facility. 
 &quot;Location, location, location—it&apos;s absolutely critical,&quot; warns Aldrich. &quot;Yet, in many cases, patients focus more on getting treatments at a facility that is convenient to their homes or their jobs instead of focusing on their life-and-death battles against cancer. In fact, I dedicated an entire section of my book to detailed information about where you can go to find annual caseloads by cancer type for all of the facilities in your area, and methods for &apos;interrogating&apos; your doctors regarding your treatment options.&quot; 
 


3. Who was the primary oncologist at that facility who directed your (or your loved one&apos;s) care? Once you&apos;ve established the &quot;where,&quot; it&apos;s time to figure out the &quot;who&quot; of cancer care. There are many oncologists at every facility. Some are good; some are not as good. Some deal exclusively with lung cancer—others only with blood-borne cancers. Aldrich says that the next step is to find out the name of the oncologist—whether the result was good or bad. And be sure to write it down! 
 &quot;If you think of your treatment facility as the &apos;team,&apos; in charge of your care, then the primary oncologist is the &apos;coach&apos; of that team,&quot; explains Aldrich. &quot;And they are not mutually exclusive in the overall success or failure of the patient&apos;s treatment.&quot; 
 And if the person you&apos;re talking to speaks negatively of the doctor&apos;s attitude, you may not want to place too much emphasis on it. 
 &quot;In my personal opinion, bedside manner is somewhat overrated,&quot; says Aldrich. &quot;If someone I love is diagnosed with cancer, I want to know that his oncologist can keep him out of bed. His or her skill—not his or her personality—should be the focus. If you&apos;re lucky, you&apos;ll find a great oncologist who has both. But experience and knowledge are paramount considerations over everything else.&quot; 
 


4. What do you believe was the key to your (or your loved one&apos;s) success? OR Why do you believe your treatment (or that of your loved one) failed? The attributes that lead to the success or failure of a cancer campaign are critical. Was the cancer discovered too late? Did the patient get a second—or even third—opinion? What was her attitude through the fight? Did she have to wait a long time if she had a problem that came up, or was it addressed right away? Were there support groups available during her treatment, and did she take advantage of any of them? The answers to these questions can be vital information. And, if she doesn&apos;t seem to mind the question, find out if she was offered financial assistance. 


 &quot;There are many key aspects to a successful cancer battle that can be pertinent physically, mentally, and emotionally,&quot; Aldrich says. &quot;Learn as much as you can from those who have walked the path before you. A cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event. Being prepared—if given the right opportunity to learn—makes good sense. And, you may be surprised to find a pattern regarding a specific treatment facility or even a specific oncologist.&quot; 





 5. What organizations were the most helpful to you? Usually, cancer patients, their caregivers, and their families get information and support from cancer-related organizations. Ask the person which ones helped him the most. Aldrich recommends starting with the ones that are associated with your particular type of cancer. 
 &quot;There are general cancer organizations such as the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology,&quot; she explains. &quot;Then there are organizations specific to your type of cancer.


My husband, Gordon, had multiple myeloma and we relied on the Myeloma Institute and the International Myeloma Foundation. All of these can be accessed on the Internet or phoned for direct information. The support and information that they can provide may be invaluable to you on your cancer journey.&quot; 
 Once you&apos;ve asked these questions, pay attention to the answers. And try to get the information down on paper as soon as you can. 



 &quot;The information you gather is only as good as your recollection of the details,&quot; Aldrich concludes. &quot;You may not want to take notes at a party or during a golf game, but try to write down what you learned as soon as it&apos;s convenient. And if you&apos;re truly inspired by the story, ask that person for her e-mail address—just in case you find yourself, a family member, or a close friend in a similar situation. 
 &quot;Finally, whether the person you&apos;re talking to is a caregiver or a cancer survivor, make a point to congratulate her on being an inspiration,&quot; she adds.


&quot;Both are tough paths, and the people who walk them deserve respect. And don&apos;t forget to thank her for offering the information that may someday save your life.&quot;That&apos;s right—networking. By gathering valuable information and forging connections with others who are dealing with cancer, you might well make a lifesaving difference when someone you love is in the same grim situation.

 To borrow a phrase from the book 

 N&apos;Spirational Conversations, 

 &quot;Every now and again, PAIN appears to remind us of an imbalance in our lives, whether it&apos;s personal or professional. 

 In my case, it&apos;s both. 

 Upon completion of editing a project for our TV Show, Higher Learning Network, I went to get up out of my chair, and a sharp pain hit me. I couldn&apos;t figure out for the life of me where it came from. 

 It heard all night long, and I was limping all day Saturday. It finally dawned on me that I hadn&apos;t done anything strenous, so it had to be something mental going on. 

 As usual, I grabbed one of my metaphysical books, this one by Louise Hay, Celebrate Your Life, and I went to the body section and read about hips. Of course, I knew immediately what needed to be done. 
 

 So I made a pact with myself, to be better to myself and complete a project that I&apos;d been putting off for sometime. The minute I made that decision, I noticed my hip felt a whole lot better.(Stretching helped too!) Now you might think it&apos;s crazy, but there are other laws working in this Universe, such as metaphysical laws. 

 Do yourself a favor and read anything by Lousie Hay, Eric Butterworth, Dr. Johnnie Coleman, and you will begin to understand. 


 

 Until next time, ask your pain what is it that it&apos;s trying to tell you! If you dare, share it with me! 

 
 






   



                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Every so often, one of my N&apos;Spirational Conversation Readers will send me a goodie, that I must share with you! This one comes from a skate buddy everyone calls affectionately, Uncle Frank. 
 

 Enjoy ! 




   Don&apos;t take anything personal today!  
 

 Whatever anyone does is a reflection of them and has nothing to do with you. 
 

 Just marvel at your ability, maintain peace, and continue to be you. 
 

 YES!  
 

 You are a wonderful person deserving compassion as well. People will try you over and over again. Stand strong and let them know you&apos;re not going their way.
 




  Let&apos;s have a wonderful morning and not allow anyone to disrupt our beautiful day. 
 

 Live long and prosper!

 Happy Father&apos;s Day ! 
 A store that offers fathers for those who don’t have them has just opened in Chicago,
where anyone of the female species may go to choose a father.

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

WELCOME TO THE Father Store!!

You may visit the store ONLY ONCE!
There are six floors and the attributes of the men increase as the shopper ascends the flights.
There is, however, a catch... ! You may choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!


Happy Shopping!!!!

A woman goes to the Father Store to find a father
On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1: These fathers have children and take care of them.
If you’re looking for a man who loves children, this is a good choice.

The second floor sign reads:
Floor 2: These fathers have children, but are not with the mother, who has the children,
but he still takes care of them. This is a good choice also.

The third floor sign reads:
Floor 3: These fathers are single parent fathers, and looking for a woman with children to make blended family. Great choice!

&quot;Wow,&quot; she says, these are great choices, but I don’t want to stop here, there may be something better! She goes to the fourth floor and sign reads:

Floor 4: These men are fathers with no children and looking for women with no children.
They are very good looking, sensitive and patient.

&quot;Oh, My God!&quot; she says to herself, &quot;I can’t do this alone! I need help!
Too many good choices. Still, she goes to the fifth floor and sign reads:

Floor 5: These fathers look like Denzel, Samuel L. Jackson and
Richard Gere all rolled up into one.
They are simply drop-dead fine, love to help with the housework, homework
and massaging your feet!
Did I mention they are all very romantic?
They love to give flowers, write love letters, work long hard hours just to give
you and the kids everything you need and desire.

A woman never satisfied, she has to try the last floor because if it gets better than this,
she has to know about it.

After she reaches the last floor, the sixth floor, the sign reads:

Floor 6:
You are visitor 20, 130, 214 to this floor.

There are NO fathers on this floor.
They are all on the first five levels.
This floor exists solely as proof that most women think they know what they want,
but maybe not really sure due to what eveyone tells us what we want, desire,
deserve, etc. We really don’t know what we want,
thereby making it hard to please a woman with or without children.

So please be very grateful for the father in your life!
At least he’s there and you don’t have to go looking for him.
And if you do have to go looking for him, you probably know where he is.
If you can’t find him, spend some time with yourself, so when the right man/father/father figure shows up in your life, you can appreciate him on whatever level he’s on.


Thank you for shopping at the Father Store. Watch your step as you exit the building, and have a Faith Filled Fantastic day! Please send this to everyone you know for a good laugh and to all the women who can handle the truth! If you see a community of fathers, give thanks for it! We can’t do it alone, so let’s stop pretending we can. We all need MALE energy to balance out FEMALE energy! He’s the yin, we carry the yang!
Stay on purpose,
stay empowered!
Stay tuned to MEN on Higher Learning, Ch. 19 Chicago. http://MENonHigherLearning.blogspot.com

The older generation will appreciate this!

As soon as I wake up, Will Power helps me get out of bed.


Then I go to see John.

 

Then Charlie Horse comes along,
And when he is here, he takes a lot of my time and attention.
 

When he leaves, Arthur Ritis shows up and stays the rest of the day.
He doesn&apos;t like to stay in one place very long, so he takes me from joint to joint.


After such a busy day, I&apos;m really tired and glad 
To go to bed with Ben Gay.
 
What a life!  
Oh, yes, I&apos;m also flirting with
Al Zymer.

And getting ready to call JACK DANIELS and 
JOHNNY WALKER to come and keep me company.


Now remember: 
Life is like a roll of toilet paper
....the closer it gets to the end, the faster it goes...

 

So have fun, think &apos;good thoughts&apos; only, learn to laugh at yourself, and count your blessings!

 I&apos;m always inspired when I feel better, but not today! I read this AFTER I&apos;d eaten an ice cream bar! ( Sometimes you gotta have the real thing! Substitutes only last for so long! )

If you are loading up on pasteurized milk, cheese, ice cream, or yogurt, unfortunately you are also taking in powerful growth hormones , large amounts of dietary cholesterol, allergenic proteins, insecticides, antibiotics, viruses, and bacteria. Does not sound too appetizing, huh? 

 Milk was designed with one purpose in mind: a hormonal delivery system. Milk is an appropriate food for babies that require critical hormones so that they can grow quickly. However, cow milk is for baby cows and human breast milk is for humans. The consumption of cow milk by adults opens up another can of worms. 

 On November 3, 1993, the FDA approved the use of a growth hormone in cows (rBGH); this approval was one of the most controversial drug applications in FDA history. The debate was over the effect of the rBGH hormone in humans. 

 Injections of rBGH in cows causes substantial and sustained increases of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) in milk. IGF-I occurs naturally in humans as well as in cows. Couple the rBGH growth hormone with IGF-I and you have an overgrowth in production of cancerous cells , particularly  breast cancer .  Harvard Medical School analyzed data from 27 countries and found a positive correlation between ovarian cancer and per capita milk consumption.  Even lung cancer has been associated with milk ingestion.  

 Ironically, the FDA claims that hormone-treated milk is &quot;not significantly different&quot; from untreated milk, and our US laws do not require that products containing hormone-treated milk be labeled as such. Perhaps the US is in the dark, because use of the rBGH hormone is not approved in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. 

 Looking for a milk alternative? Try the following: 
 Almond milk 
 Coconut milk 
 Hemp seed milk 
 Hazelnut milk 

 Why not soy milk? 
 Ann Louise Gittleman , author of
&quot;The Fat Flush Plan&quot;, states it best: 
 Soy is a top food allergen and is often genetically modified. It can increase hyperactivity, panic attacks , hair loss, adrenal burnout, fatigue, and hypothyroidism . Because of its effects on the hormonal system, soy has been implicated in fibroid tumors in breast and uterine tissue.

How depressing is that? If you&apos;ve got some tips to share with me to help me in my dairy challenge, feel free to email me at Zelda@ZeldaSpeaks.com!

 As we celebrate Womens History Month, let us honor those who came before us and paved the way! It doesn&apos;t matter that we don&apos;t know them, what matters is that we pass it on! 
 
 Housewives League paved way for jobs, businesses 
 
LARRY DAVIS
The Detroit News 

 Detroit&apos;s blacks in the 1930s pushed to make Detroit that better place they had hoped to find when they fled the South in the 1920s. Escaping overt racism and poverty, they arrived in Detroit and other Northern cities only to find themselves fighting for jobs, housing, education and first-class citizenship. 

 On June 10, 1930, 50 black women, led by Fannie B. Peck, wife of the Rev. William H. Peck, organized the Housewives League of Detroit and began a movement to promote economic growth in the black community. 

 The Housewives League -- a nonprofit sister group to the Booker T. Washington Businessmen&apos;s Association organized by her husband, the pastor of Bethel A.M.E. -- required members to support black businesses, buy black products and patronize black professionals, thus keeping black money in the black community. The effort received support from the NAACP and the Urban League. 

 Members, who had grown to 10,000 by 1934, picketed and boycotted, demanding that merchants employ blacks and sell black products. They also lectured and created exhibits emphasizing their position, issued Certificates of Merit to businesses that met the group&apos;s sanitary standards, gave tours and organized spending drives. 

 Their publications included the Semi-Annual Trade Guide that listed approved businesses, a calendar and a bimonthly Housewives League Bulletin. These publications were sometimes carried door to door during trade campaigns aimed at keeping black dollars in the community. 

 In addition, the group formed junior units for girls 5-15 in 1935, along with high school and college units for young men and women in 1946. They taught etiquette, scrapbooking, unity and achievement. 

 Betty Shabazz, who later married Malcolm X, was a member of a junior unit in Detroit. 

 The Housewives League became so popular that chapters sprang up in other cities, including St. Louis, Mo.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Frankfort, Ky.; Austin, Texas; and Baltimore, Md. In 1933 the leagues organized themselves into the Housewives League of America and Fannie Peck was elected president. Conventions were held in many states. 

 In the group&apos;s early decades their only source of money came from members&apos; pockets, fundraisers, ads sold in their publications, and the sales of black newspapers, including the Pittsburgh Courier and Chicago Defender, said Lydia Hibbert, 81, a past Housewives president. 

 &quot;We funded ourselves with patrons, not donations,&quot; Hibbert said. 

 During the Depression, the League&apos;s work was so successful that &quot;in Chicago, Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Harlem and Cleveland, (the League) relied on boycotts&quot; to gain &quot;an estimated 75,000 new jobs for blacks,&quot; wrote historian Jacqueline Jones in &quot;Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow: Black Women, Work, and the Family from Slavery to the Present&quot; (Basic Books, 1985). 

 Its impact was &quot;second only to government jobs as a new source of openings,&quot; she added. 

 The League continued to work through the 1960s before fading out, ironically, just as the Black Power movement grew, Hibbert said. 

 &quot;Integration diluted the buying power of black dollars,&quot; she said. 

 Dale Rich, MSU professor Darlene Clark Hine and the Detroit Public Library&apos;s Burton Collection contributed.

  MOREHOUSE WHIZ KID 

 

 There&apos;s so much good in our youth today, I consider it an honor to share this good news with you! Tell all the kids you know to visit this site to encourage them! 
 Morehouse Whiz Kid is Causing a Stir: 13-Year-Old Dominates College By Boyce Watkins, PhD   

 
 
 At thirteen years of age, Stephen Stafford is causing quite a stir at Morehouse College. Stafford has a triple major in pre-med, math and computer science. Though he loves playing video games and playing his drum set, he is no typical teenager.

&quot;I&apos;ve never taught a student as young as Stephen, and it&apos;s been amazing,&quot; said computer science professor Sonya Dennis . &quot;He&apos;s motivating other students to do better and makes them want to step up their game.&quot;

Stafford began his college career at the age of 11, after being home-schooled by his mother. Stafford&apos;s mother said that when Stafford began to teach her instead of being taught by her, she knew he needed to be in a college environment.
 
 
 Now THAT&apos;S what I&apos;m talking about. Stephen Stafford, in my opinion, represents exactly what black men are about: Intelligence, ambition and high academic achievement. This is not to disrespect men in other walks of life, but the truth is that you will never see Stephen Stafford&apos;s accomplishments promoted like a rap music video.

We must, as a community, applaud and uphold this young man. We must cheer for him as if he averages 40 points a game. We should converse about his achievements as if he had released a platinum hip-hop album. He should get the same respect as every linebacker, point guard or hip-hop artist in America.

Corporate America will not blow Stephen&apos;s trumpet, but I will. I also want all the other Stephen Staffords to make themselves seen. There are hundreds of thousands of Stephen Staffords out there who&apos;ve been convinced by a culture of thuggery that they should do their best to hide their greatness. Rather than acing math class, they&apos;ve been taught to measure grams and kilos or to memorize football playbooks that are 100 pages thick. Our young men can analyze the triangle offense in basketball and break down a nickel defense, but then become mentally deficient when it comes to doing algebra, science and social studies. The time for mediocrity is over, since education is the key to making your dreams come true. Sports only creates more nightmares.

Stephen will make more money than all of his athletic friends, because education produces economic empowerment. He will also have more personal freedom and professional fulfillment. He will live the black American dream, and I encourage all of you to make your own sons into the next Stephen Stafford.

The recipe for our kids is simple:

1) Spend as much time studying as you spend playing sports or working at fast food restaurant jobs.
2) Don&apos;t let anyone convince you that you can&apos;t achieve whatever you put your mind to.

Just by studying 4 to 5 hours per day (less than the number of hours they would put in to working a minimum wage job), almost any child in America can get a college degree and become a doctor, lawyer or whatever they want. It&apos;s actually just a matter of doing it. I&apos;ve taught college for 16 years, and I can tell you that the term &quot;college material&quot; needs to be abolished. Every child is college material if they want to be. That&apos;s the truth.

 &quot;If you work hard on your job, you can make a living... But, if you work hard on yourself, you can make a fortune.&quot; Create you own rescue plan!&apos; 

 Jim Rohn 



 
 


 As she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of school, she told the children an untruth. Like most teachers, she looked at her students and said that she loved them all the same. However, that was impossible, because there in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard . 
 
 Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he did not play well with the other children, that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath. In addition, Teddy could be unpleasant. It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X&apos;s and then putting a big &apos;F&apos; at the top of his papers . 
 
 At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review each child&apos;s past records and she put Teddy&apos;s off until last. However, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise. Teddy&apos;s first grade teacher wrote, &apos;Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners ... he is a joy to be around.. 
 
 
 His second grade teacher wrote, &apos;Teddy is an excellent student, well liked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle. 
 
 
 His third grade teacher wrote, &apos;His mother&apos;s death has been hard on him. He tries to do his best, but his father doesn&apos;t show much interest, and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren&apos;t taken. 

 Teddy&apos;s fourth grade teacher wrote, &apos;Teddy is withdrawn and doesn&apos;t show much interest in school. He doesn&apos;t have many friends and he sometimes sleeps in class.&apos; 

 By now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christma s presents, wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddy&apos;s. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper that he got from a grocery bag. Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents. 

Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle that was one-quarter full of perfume.. But she stifled the children&apos;s laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist. Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say, &apos;Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to.&apos;
 
 
 Four years after that, she got another letter, saying that while things
 

 


 A year later, she found a note under her door, 
 from Teddy, telling her that she was the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still the best teacher he ever had in life. 
 
 Life had been tough at times, he&apos;d stayed in school, had stuck with it, and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honours. He assured Mrs. T hompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he had ever had in his whole 
  life. 
 
 Then four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he explained that after he got his bachelor&apos;s degree, he decided to go a little further. The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer....The letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD. 
 
 The story does not end there. You see, there was yet another letter that spring. Teddy said he had met this girl and was going to be married. He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit at the wedding in the placethat was usually reserved for 
 the mother of the groom. Of course, Mrs. Thompson did. And guess what? 
 
 
 
 She wore that bracelet, the one with several rhinestones missing. 
 
 
 

 Moreover, she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy 
 remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together. They hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson&apos;sear, &apos;Thank you Mrs. Thompson for believing in me. Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference.&apos;

 On Tuesday, a catastrophic earthquake struck near Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed, but the death toll -- already in the thousands -- is climbing fast. 
 
 This is the worst earthquake to hit the area in more than 200 years. Entire communities have been ripped apart and as many as 3 million people have been directly affected, including tens of thousands of American citizens who are in Haiti . 
 
 Our neighbors in Haiti are racing to confront the enormous devastation -- and the OFA community can help. 
 
 Click here for more information about essential relief efforts and ways you can help today. 
 
 Footage is pouring in of homes collapsing, Haitians carrying injured family members, and hospitals being overrun in what was already the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere . 
 
 I have directed my administration to respond with a swift, coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives. Personnel from the United States and our partners in the international community are on the ground in damaged areas right now, working side by side with the Haitian people. They&apos;re providing much-needed food, water, and sanitation supplies, saving lives and helping local communities start to rebuild. 
 
 Despite the fact that we are experiencing tough times here at home, I encourage those who can to reach out and help. It&apos;s in times like these that we must show the kind of compassion and humanity that has defined the best of our national character for generations.

 As this story continues to unfold, I hope you will continue to keep the people of Haiti in your thoughts and prayers, as well as the many Haitian-Americans who have done so much to enrich our country and who are worried about friends and loved ones in this time of need. 
 
 Thank you, 
 
 President Barack Obama

 Happy New Year! Happy New You! 

 Happy New Yang! 


 

 You are the answer! 

 You have all the answers. 

 You just sometimes can&apos;t get quiet long enough to hear the answers! 

 This next piece was sent to me, and of course, all good things we must share! Enjoy! 
 

  1. Maybe . . . we were supposed to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that, when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.

2. Maybe . . . when the door of happiness closes, another opens; but, often times, we look so long at the closed door that we don&apos;t even see the new one which has been opened for us.

3. Maybe . . it is true that we don&apos;t know what we have until we lose it, but it is also true that we don&apos;t know what we have been missing until it arrives.

4. Maybe . . . the happiest of people don&apos;t necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.

5. Maybe . . the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; after all, you can&apos;t go on successfully in life until you let go of your past mistakes, failures and heartaches.

6. Maybe . .. you should dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go, be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you dream of, and want to do.

7. Maybe . . there are moments in life when you miss someone -- a parent, a spouse, a friend, a child -- so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real, so that once they are around you appreciate them more.

8. Maybe . . the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you&apos;ve ever had.

9. Maybe . . . you should always try to put yourself in others&apos; shoes. If you feel that something could hurt you, it probably will hurt the other person, too.

10. Maybe . . you should do something nice for someone every single day, even if it is simply to leave them alone.

11. Maybe . . giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back. Don&apos;t expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart; but, if it doesn&apos;t, be content that it grew in yours.

12. Maybe . . happiness waits for all those who cry, all those who hurt, all those who have searched, and all those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of all the people who have touched their lives.

13. Maybe . . you shouldn&apos;t go for looks; they can deceive; don&apos;t go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.

14. Maybe . . .. you should hope for enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, and enough hope to make you happy

Maybe . . . you could share this message to those people who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life, to those who can and do make you smile when you really need it, to those who make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, and to all those whom you want to know that you appreciate them and their friendship.

 Conference stresses professional diversity 



  
 By VALERIE WHITNEY 
 Business Writer 

 DAYTONA BEACH -- College student Tamara Fuller&apos;s summer internship in the promotions department at a South Florida radio station made her rethink her desire to go into broadcast public relations. 

 Fuller 
 Now, the Bethune-Cookman University senior is hoping she can use her degree to enter the broadcast arena in some other role, perhaps as a media buyer or advertising sales. 

 Either way, Fuller will be entering a job market that has not been too kind to media professionals in recent years. 

 &quot;I&apos;m a little concerned. I know the economy is bad and professionals, are getting laid off,&quot; Fuller said Friday during the college&apos;s annual mass communications conference at B-CU&apos;s Center for Civic Engagement. 

 Dancy 
 Desiree Dancy, vice president for corporate human resources for the New York Times Co., kicked off the program by telling students there was no way to recession-proof a career. 

 To illustrate her point, Dancy noted 11.3 percent of jobs at daily newspapers nationwide disappeared last year. The New York Times newspaper, which has the largest newsroom staff in the country, eliminated 100 jobs last year and plans are in place to reduce the staff by 100 positions by the end of this year, she said. 

 But although fewer people are gathering the news, she said The New York Times is reaching more people with digital online media. To stay competitive, she advised the students to hone skills that can go back and forth on a changing playing field. 

 Speaking to a largely African-American audience, she also said people of color, in particular, need to have a bigger footprint in the digital world in such areas as Web design and development. &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid to step outside the black box&quot; and go for more mainstream jobs, said Dancy, the chief diversity officer for the media company. 

 Burt-Murray 
 Angela Burt-Murray, editor-in-chief of Essence magazine and luncheon speaker, echoed several of Dancy&apos;s themes. 

 Journalists who write for Essence, which has a monthly readership of 7.4 million people, must be able to write for print, television and online, Burt-Murray said. &quot;When we hire folks, we are looking for people with a wide range of experiences.&quot; 

 Students who aspire to climb the management ladder need to become corporate savvy, she said. Management always has a slate of candidates that would be considered for job openings. 

 &quot;The biggest thing that derails people of color is that they don&apos;t know what five people (inside the firm) would say about them&quot; if they were being considered for another job, she said, adding her elevation to editor of Essence was almost derailed by a comment from someone who didn&apos;t know about her background, including that she had co-written two books. 

 &quot;It is important to manage your identity. You have to tell people what you are doing, &quot; she said.

 ITEX cares; safety tips for you, your families and your employees ~ 

   

 Emergency Car supplies: 

 Be prepared in case you are stuck in your car for an extended period: 

 Prepare for everyday family car emergencies. Most people carry the basic auto items (oil, flares, jumper cables, etc), but emergency boxes will be for helpful; incase of inclement weather emergencies . Fill a couple of sweater-sized plastic containers to keep in the trunk of the car with useful everyday emergency items that could help in an otherwise uncomfortable situation. Look over the lists below and decide which items relate to your particular commute, 

 Also it’s a good idea to keep your gas tank above ½ full in inclement weather . Traffic is worse and commutes take longer. 

 Emergency Supplies in Case of being Stuck or Lost in the Auto 

   

 Emergency heat-preserving silver blankets (comes in a small pack at a camping store) 

   

 Food, like food bars, nuts, crackers and peanut butter 

   

 Three day supply of water per person(rotate to stay fresh) 

   

 A mirror (for signaling for help) matches and flint , duct tape , rope 

   

 Instant hand-warming packets (comes in a small pack at a camping store) 

   

 Flashing emergency light, small crank-operated radio. Flashlight and extra batteries 

   

 A pad of paper and pencils in case you need to leave a stranded car and people are searching for you 

   

 Weather appropriate shoes, especial for those that wear dress shoes to the office 

   

 Gallon-sized seal-able plastic bags (for a million reasons) 

   

 One pair of socks and underclothing for each family member 

   

 A good quality pocket knife 

   

 A pack of baby wipes for spills and sanitizing gel 

   

 First Aid Supplies to 

   

 A basic first aid kit for minor cuts, etc. 

   

 Pain relievers 

   

 Spares of prescription or often-used over-the-counter medications (like allergy pills) 

   

 For Women and Teen Girls 

   

 Spare makeup 

   

 Feminine needs 

   

 For Babies and Infants 

   

 Formula mix and/or baby food 

   

 Diapers and Wipes 

   

 A couple very small but engaging toys 

   

 All these things should be compact and organized into the two boxes. Much more than that will take up a lot of car space. The plastic boxes will keep items fresh, clean and dry. If there is room, a couple thin backpacks are also nice to carry in case one has to walk for help.

 There&apos;s nothing more inspirational than forgiving. 

 My heartfelt sympathies goes out to my collegue Garrad McClendon (CLTV) in the loss/transformation of his parents who were killed last week. I just don&apos;t know if I could be as forgiving.  

 It&apos;s something I teach, and try to practice as well. But when it&apos;s your parents, it&apos;s the biggest test of life! My parents made their transistion before I was a teenager. I don&apos;t have a clue of what it&apos;s like to feel that pain in particular, but I do know what it&apos;s like to feel pain. 

 It takes a while to heal pain. The pain of writing about the truth is something I am still learning to deal with. I&apos;ve been contemplating writing another book on the challenges of forgiving, but just can&apos;t seem to shake the demons that keep me from moving forward. 

 We all experience pain and death, but we must move beyond the pain, and seek the lesson in living. 

 Death is always a blessing, (for someone) whether we realize it or not.  

 Death always makes us take a deeper look. 

 Death makes us see, say and do things that we would not ordinarily do.  

 Death waits on no one, so don&apos;t take death for granted.  

 Don&apos;t take life for granted either.  One day, we will all meet our maker. Hopefully we will have done the work we were put on this work to do, so our maker can say, Well done! 

 There&apos;s nothing more powerful, than working daily on something that gives your life meaning. 

 Don&apos;t let DEATH (of ideas of life) steal or stop your joy! 

 Time to get busy! 

 Stay on purpose, stay empowered!

 YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW 


   Good morning said a woman as she walked up to the man sitting on the ground. The man slowly looked up. This was a woman clearly accustomed to the finer things of life. Her coat was new. She looked like she had never missed a mealin her life.    His first thought was that she wanted to make fun of him, like so many others had done before. &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; he growled.... 

 To his amazement, the woman continued standing. She was smiling -- her even white teeth displayed in dazzling rows. &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; she asked. &quot;No,&quot; he answered sarcastically. &quot;I&apos;ve just come from dining with the president. Now go away.&quot;The woman&apos;s smile became even broader.. Suddenly the man felt a gentle hand under his arm. &quot;What are you doing, lady?&quot; the man asked angrily. &quot;I said to leave me alone. Just then a policeman came up. &quot;Is there any problem, ma&apos;am?&quot; he asked.. &quot;No problem here, officer,&quot; the woman answered. &quot;I&apos;m just trying to get this man to his feet... Will you help me?&quot; The officer scratched his head. &quot;That&apos;s old Jack. He&apos;s been a fixture around here for a couple of years. 



 What do you want with him? &quot;See that cafeteria over there?&quot; she asked. &quot;I&apos;m going to get him something to eat and get him out of the cold for awhile..&quot;&quot;Are you crazy, lady?&quot; the homeless man resisted. &quot;I don&apos;t want to go in there!&quot; Then he felt strong hands grab his other arm and lift him up. &quot;Let me go, officer. I didn&apos;t do anything..&quot; &quot;This is a good deal for you, Jack,&quot; the officer answered. &quot;Don&apos;t blow it.&quot; Finally, and with some difficulty, the woman and the police officer got Jack into the cafeteria and sathim at a table in a remote corner. It was the middle of the morning, so most of the breakfast crowd had already left and the lunch bunch had not yet arrived... The manager strode across the cafeteria and stood by his table. &quot;What&apos;s going on here, officer?&quot; he asked. &quot;What is all this, is this man in trouble?&quot; 

   &quot;This lady brought this man in here to be fed,&quot; the policeman answered.  &quot;Not in here!&quot; the manager replied angrily. &quot;Having a person like that here is bad for business..&quot; Old Jack smiled a toothless grin. &quot;See, lady. I told you so. Now if you&apos;ll let me go. I didn&apos;t want to come here in the first place.&quot; The woman turned to the cafeteria manager and smiled. &quot;Sir, are you familiar with Eddy and Associates, the banking firm down the street?&quot; &quot;Of course I am,&quot; the manager answered impatiently. &quot;They hold their weekly meetings in one of my banquet rooms.&quot;&quot;And do you make a goodly amount of money providing food at these weekly meetings?&quot; &quot;What business is that of yours?&quot; I, sir, am Penelope Eddy, president and CEO of the company.&quot; &quot;Oh.&quot; The woman smiled again. &quot;I thought that might make a difference. 



 &quot; She glanced at the cop who was busy stifling a giggle. &quot;Would you like to join us in a cup of coffee and a meal, officer?&quot; &quot;No thanks, ma&apos;am,&quot; the officer replied. &quot;I&apos;m on duty.&quot; &quot;Then, perhaps, a cup of coffee to go?&quot; &quot;Yes, ma&apos;am.. That would be very nice.&quot; The cafeteria manager turned on his heel, &quot;I&apos;ll get your coffee for you right away, officer.&quot; The officer watched him walk away. &quot;You certainly put him in his place,&quot; he said. &quot;That was not my intent. 



 Believe it or not, I have a reason for all this.&quot; She sat down at the table across from her amazed dinner guest. She stared at him intently. &quot;Jack, do you remember me?&quot; Old Jack searched her face with his old, rheumy eyes.. &quot;I think so -- I mean you do look familiar.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a little older perhaps,&quot; she said. &quot;Maybe I&apos;ve even filled out more than in my younger days when you worked here, and I came through that very door, cold and hungry.&quot; &quot;Ma&apos;am?&quot; the officer said questioningly. He couldn&apos;t believe that such a magnificently turned out woman could ever have been hungry. &quot;I was just out of college,&quot;the woman began. &quot;I had come to the city looking for a job, but I couldn&apos;t find anything. Finally I was down to my last few cents and had been kicked out of my apartment. I walked the streets for days. 



  It was February and I was cold and nearly starving. I saw this place and walked in on the off chance that I could get something to eat.&quot; Jack lit up with a smile. &quot;Now I remember,&quot; he said. &quot;I was behind the serving counter. You came up and asked me if you could work for something to eat. I said that it was against company policy.&quot; &quot;I know,&quot; the woman continued. Then you made me the biggest roast beef sandwich that I had ever seen, gave me a cup of coffee,and told me to go over to a corner table and enjoy it. I was afraid that you would get into trouble.... Then, when I looked over and saw you put the price of my food in the cash register, I knew then that everything would be all right.&quot; 



 &quot;So you started your own business?&quot; Old Jack said. &quot;I got a job that very afternoon. I worked my way up. Eventually I started my own business that, with the help of God, prospered.&quot; She opened her purse and pulled out a business card. &quot;When you are finished here, I want you to pay a visit to a Mr. Lyons...He&apos;s the personnel director of my company. I&apos;ll go talk to him now and I&apos;m certain he&apos;ll find something for you to do around the office.&quot; She smiled. &quot;I think he might even find the funds to give you a little advance so that you can buy some clothes and get a place to live until you get on your feet.. 



 If you ever need anything, my door is always opened to you.&quot; There were tears in the old man&apos;seyes. &quot;How can I ever thank you?&quot; he said. &quot;Don&apos;t thank me, &quot; the woman answered. &quot;To God goes the glory. Thank God... He led me to you.&quot; Outside the cafeteria, the officer and the woman paused at the entrance before going their separate ways... &quot;Thank you for all your help, officer,&quot; she said. &quot;On the contrary, Ms. Eddy,&quot;he answered. &quot;Thank you. I saw a miracle today, something that I will never forget. 



 And thank you for the coffee.&quot; If you have missed knowing me, you have missed nothing. If you have missed some of my emails, you might have missed a laugh. But, if you have missed knowing my Lord and Savior, God, you have missed everything in the world. Have a Wonderful Day.. 

 May God Bless You Always and don&apos;t forget that when you &quot;cast your bread upon the waters,&quot; you never know how it will be returned to you.. God is so big He can cover the whole world with his Love and so small He can curl up inside your heart.. 

 When God leads you to the edge of the cliff, trust Him fully and let go. 

 Only 1 of 2 things will happen, either He&apos;ll catch you when you fall, or He&apos;ll teach you how to fly! 

 God closes doors no man can open&amp;God opens doors no man can close.. 

 If you need God to open some doors for you...share this. 

 Have a blessed day and remember to be a blessing...&quot;&quot; 



 Don&apos;t give up..... 

 One day I decided to quit... I quit my job, my relationship, my spirituality.... I wanted to quit my life. I went to the woods to have one last talk with God. &apos;God &apos;, I asked, &apos;Can you give me one good reason not to quit?&apos; His answer surprised me... &apos;Look around&apos;, He said. &apos;Do you see the fern and the bamboo?&apos; &apos;Yes&apos;, I replied. 

 

 &apos;When I planted the fern and the bamboo seeds, I took very good care of them. I gave them light. I gave them water. The fern quickly grew from the earth. Its brilliant green covered the floor. Yet nothing came from the bamboo seed. But I did not quit on the bamboo. 

 

 In the second year the Fern grew more vibrant and plentiful. And again, nothing came from the bamboo seed. But I did not quit on the bamboo. He said. &apos;In year three there was still nothing from the bamboo seed. But I would not quit. In year four, again, there was nothing from the bamboo seed. I would not quit.&apos; He said. &apos;Then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth. 

 

 Compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant...But just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall. It had spent the five years growing roots. Those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive. I would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle.&apos; He asked me. &apos;Did you know, my child, that all this time you have been struggling, you have actually been growing roots&apos;. &apos;I would not quit on the bamboo. I will never quit on you.&apos; 

 

 &apos;Don&apos;t compare yourself to others.&apos; He said. &apos;The bamboo had a different Purpose than the fern. Yet they both make the forest beautiful.&apos; &apos;Your time will come&apos;, God said to me. &apos;You will rise high&apos; &apos;How high should I rise?&apos; I asked. &apos;How high will the bamboo rise?&apos; He asked in return. &apos;As high as it can?&apos; I questioned. &apos;Yes.&apos; He said, &apos;Give me glory by rising as high as you can.&apos; 

 

 I left the forest and brought back this story. I hope these words can help you see that God will never give up on you. 
 



 For the Christian Prayer is not an option but an opportunity. 

 Don&apos;t tell the Lord how big the problem is, 


 
 Heavens door open this morning, God asked me... 

 &apos;My CHILD, what can I do for you?&apos; 

 And I said, &apos;Daddy, please protect and bless the one reading this message.&apos; 

 God smiled and answered, &apos;Request granted.&apos; 
 
 
 This message is now in your hands. Will you share it?

 What you do when no one is looking tells alot about your personality. A reader sent this one to me and it&apos;s so good, I just couldn&apos;t keep it to myself. Be sure and share this with someone. 

 Character is doing what&apos;s right even when no one is looking.
 
 
After being interviewed by the school administration, the prospective teacher said:
 
&apos;Let me see if I&apos;ve got this right.
 
&apos;You want me to go into that room with all those kids, correct their disruptive behavior, observe them for signs of abuse, monitor their dress habits, censor their T-shirt messages, and instill in them a love for learning.
 
&apos;You want me to check their backpacks for weapons, wage war on drugs and sexually transmitted diseases, and raise their sense of self esteem and personal pride.
 
&apos;You want me to teach them patriotism and good citizenship, sportsmanship and fair play, and how to register to vote, balance a checkbook , and apply for a job.
 
&apos;You want me to check their heads for lice, recognize signs of antisocial behavior , and make sure that they all pass the final exams. 
 
You also want me to provide them with an equal education regardless of their handicaps, and communicate regularly with their parents in English, Spanish or any other language, by letter, telephone,
newsletter, and report card.
 
&apos;You want me to do all this with a piece of chalk, a blackboard, a bulletin board, a few books, a big smile, and a starting salary that qualifies me for food stamps .
 
&apos;You want me to do all this and then you tell me. . . 

 I CAN&apos;T PRAY?&quot;

  ILLNESS (Mental or physical) 

  IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF! 
 



 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

   
 
 
 Managing Medical and Mental Illness 
 
 

   

 
 
 
 
 Adrienne Fitts, 46, is a disabled navy veteran living in Chicago. She learned she had a mental illness in 1998. Her psychiatric drugs caused her weight to balloon up to 265 pounds and in 2001 she developed diabetes. She has hypertension and is now recovering from a stroke and a bout with encephalitis.  
 Gloria, a 56-year-old legislative advocacy worker, also deals with both a major mental and medical condition. Gloria, who asked to be identified by first name only, has long-term clinical depression , neurological problems and on top of that, partial kidney failure. 
 &quot;Multiple conditions are not rare and they become even more common as people get older,&quot; says Dennis Freeman, Ph.D., the CEO of Cherokee Health Systems in Tennessee . 
 &quot;Twenty-five percent of people in a primary care practice have a psychiatric illness,&quot; says Wayne Katon, M.D., vice chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of Washington School of Medicine . 
 Children are vulnerable, too. &quot;Kids with asthma are more likely to have every kind of anxiety and depressive disorder ,&quot; Katon says. &quot;This makes more of an impact on school performance and the ability to make and keep friends. Parents and schools have to be especially watchful for the additive effects of having two conditions.&quot; 
 For many people, physical conditions can contribute to problems with their mental health-problems that are often ignored and untreated. But your emotional health and physical health affect each other. Here&apos;s what you should know. 
 

   

   
 The stakes are high . 
 When recovering from a heart attack, it&apos;s natural to be focused on your physical recovery rather than your state of mind, but the two are intertwined, says Eric Goplerud, Ph.D. 
 &quot;A heart attack produces large amounts of cortisol that precipitates depression,&quot; explains Goplerud, the director of the Center for Integrated Behavioral Health Policy at George Washington University Medical Center . 
 &quot;At least twenty percent with heart attacks have severe depression-and these people are three times more likely to die if the depression is not dealt with promptly,&quot; he says. 
 &quot;People who have mental problems often have other health problems and they come together in legion,&quot; Goplerud says.  
 

   

   
 Drugs that help your mind can harm your body . 
 In a health care Catch-22, the same drugs that help people manage bipolar disorder , schizophrenia and depression can have serious physical side effects . 
 As part of her treatment, Fitts has received some heavy-duty drugs, including olanzapine. 
 &quot;Clozapine and olanzapine are the two antipsychotic drugs that the American Diabetes Association found the highest risk of causing weight gain and poor lipid control.&quot; Goplerud says. As for drugs to combat depression, &quot;some SSRIs are associated with weight gain and may contribute to diabetes . So you may be developing life-threatening illnesses from appropriate treatment of your mental illness.&quot; 
 The dilemma works both ways, Goplerud adds: &quot;Sometimes treatment we prescribe for in medical care end up causing mental health problems .&quot; For instance, &quot;People who have been legitimately prescribed powerful pain meds can become addicted.&quot; 
 If you are ever prescribed antidepressants, or given medication to help you sleep, doses often need to be fine-tuned and you might need to try several drugs before to find one that works for you. Although primary care practitioners or clinic doctors can prescribe these drugs, follow-up can fall through the cracks. Let someone know if your treatment isn&apos;t helping.  
 Patients have options, Goplerud says. &quot;Talk to your physician about other medicines that might be used.&quot; 
 

   

   
 Speaking up is vital to your mental health . 
 Stigma, no insurance, lifestyle behaviors, lack of psychiatric providers, poor access to psychologists, clinical social workers or counselors and shaky communication between doctors all contribute to extra complications for people dealing with more than one condition at a time. 
 Fear of the stigma of mental illness can keep patients from speaking up, says Chris Koyanagi, policy director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law . Some &quot;are reluctant to tell primary care doctors about their psychiatric medicines: &apos;I just don&apos;t want my regular doctor to know.&apos;&quot; 
 Recalls Gloria: &quot;As a teenager I had aches and pains and my parents took me to the Mayo clinic. They wanted me to see a psychiatrist. My father said fine, as long as they could come with me. The psychiatrist asked, &apos;Are you depressed?&apos; Dad answered, &apos;No, she&apos;s not.&apos;&quot; 
 Meanwhile, physical conditions arose that could not be brushed aside. It was only years later, when she had an emotional collapse on the job that Gloria began treatment for depression . 
 

   

   
 Your health care is usually scattered across different settings . 
 &quot;Health systems are fragmented, people are integrated,&quot; says Dennis Freeman, Ph.D., the CEO of Cherokee Health Systems in Tennessee. 
 People are often are forced to work with an array of health care providers . &quot;It&apos;s daunting to go to three different clinics; it&apos;s hard for anyone,&quot; Katon says. &quot;Fragmentation is even worse for people with mental health issues.&quot; 
   Dangerous drug interactions are possible when no single health professional has a handle on all the medications you take: you could receive heart pills from one doctor and an antidepressant from another doctor without either being aware of what the other prescribes. 
 &quot;At the least, one single person or entity needs to know all the medications you take and all the diagnoses you have,&quot; Koyanagi says. &quot;This can be your primary care physician , your mental health practitioner , your pharmacist.&quot; 
 

   

   
 Some mental health care is &quot;nested&quot; with medical care . 
 Katon, who brings his psychiatric expertise to a medical practice one day a week, says, &quot;It&apos;s ideal if psychiatric care can be merged into medical care,&quot; 
 &quot;We found that mental health care programs with primary care onsite-sometimes provided by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant-who can do regular and effective screens, can link people to community services [work best],&quot; Koyanagi agrees. 
 Federally qualified health centers, like Freeman&apos;s Cherokee Health System in Tennessee, provide a full range of services from professionals who communicate daily with one another and have access to a single, unified medical record for each patient. 
 Unfortunately, it can be hard to find mental health care at all, much less integrated medical-mental care. &quot;Half of counties in the United States don&apos;t have mental health providers ,&quot; Freeman says. 
 In those areas, &quot;You probably go to a primary care physician. They will do the very best they can. They&apos;re not psychotherapists or behaviorists, but psychiatrists are in short supply every place, even among insured,&quot; he says. &quot;So you go to see your primary care physician, talk to your minister, if you&apos;re in school it may be your teacher and guidance counselor.&quot; 
 

   

   
 We&apos;re all vulnerable at various times in our lives . 
 Just as we have ups and downs of physical health, everyone also deals with challenges that affect our moods and stability. It helps to know your baseline: What&apos;s your usual mental state? How do you know when things are out of control?  
  &quot;We all have times we&apos;re not as resilient and not managing as well,&quot; Freeman says. &quot;That&apos;s when the team needs to support you, help you through the rough times.&quot; 
 You might need additional support, not only from mental health professionals but also the people in your life. Sharing confidences and concerns with trusted friends and family or joining a support group can help restore your mental balance. 
 Fitts has found-and given-support through the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance , a peer group for people with mood disorders . Earlier, when she developed substance abuse issues - which often go along with mental illness and can complicate medical treatment -she looked outside herself for help. &quot;I just made some decisions. It&apos;s a process. I use a 12-step approach. I have a group in my church. It&apos;s helped me to get my thoughts together.&quot; 
 If you&apos;ve been diagnosed with a medical illness and you don&apos;t feel right emotionally: &quot;Talk to your physician, tell your nurse.&quot; Goplerud says. &quot;Misery is not necessary. You don&apos;t have to live with feeling physically miserable or mentally miserable.&quot;

 Comedy is my therapy. 

 It&apos;s what I rely on when I plan for things to happen, and it goes the complete opposite way. Sometimes comedy can help you keep your sanity. One of my all time favs is that of late Comedian George Carlin. Life won&apos;t be the same without him, so here&apos;s a litlle something to remember him by. 

 

 Isn&apos;t it amazing that George Carlin - comedian of the 70s and 80s - could write something so very eloquent...and so very appropriate. 

    A Message by George Carlin: 

 The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways , but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. 

 We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. 

 We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. 

 We&apos;ve learned how to make a living, but not a life. We&apos;ve added years to life not life to years. We&apos;ve been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We&apos;ve done larger things, but not better things. 

 We&apos;ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We&apos;ve conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less.. We&apos;ve learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. 

 These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete... 

 Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. 

 Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. 

 Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn&apos;t cost a cent. 

 Remember, to say, &apos;I love you&apos; to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. 

 Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again. 

 Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. 

 AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: 

 Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.  

  
 George Carlin

 BLACK FARMERS AND COTTON GROWING


 U.S. Cotton Program&amp;Black Cotton Farmers in the United States: Part Three
http://www.federationsoutherncoop.com/cottonstudy/cotton3.htm

Part One of the “U.S. Cotton P rogram&amp;Black Cotton Farmers in the United States” was an “Historical Overview”
and Part Two was “Findings and Analysis of Interviews with Black Cotton Farmers.”
In this last section of the study - Part Three - we will offer recommendations for agriculture policy based on the research findings.


We determined that the entire agriculture policy in the United States needs to be re-designed – a whole new mindset
needs to be incorporated. This would include a re-invigoration and improvement of policies developed by agriculture
experts from the past who had in mind the protection of family farmers. U.S. policy makers need to be mindful of the
safety and protection of independent family farmers, as well as the American consumers, rather than advocating for
America’s corporate giants. Ultimately, everyone loses from government policies that benefit only one sector
and in this case it is corporate America.


Please go to our website at http://www.federation.coop to read the recommendations in Part Three.

For those in the Western hemispere who profess the message of Judasim, Christianity and Islam, the time has come to honor God&apos;s dietary laws. We have been warned since the beginning of time, and we still don&apos;t obey. So now, we have been forwarned of the disasters that will occur, resulting in death. Here&apos;s an interesting article you might want to share with your friends, family and loved ones! You know we love to eat pork, but this time it&apos;s fatal! BEWARE! We&apos;ve all been forewarned!



WASHINGTON -- The United States has activated an emergency plan to combat swine flu as the Obama administration announced measures Sunday to contain the sometimes deadly virus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified the strain of swine flu and is prepared to distribute a quarter of the U.S. stockpile of 50 million doses of anti-viral medications in places around the country where swine flu has been located or may be expected to spread, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a briefing at the White House. 

Travel advisories have not been issued by the State Department, Napolitano said, nor is the United States going to screen passengers on flights arriving from Mexico. She said funds have been freed up in case a larger response is needed.

Hand-washing, mask-wearing and other measures will help prevent the spread, Napolitano said explaining how the public can help slow potential contaminations. 

&quot;If you are sick, stay home,&quot; Napolitano said. &quot;Take all of those reasonable measures that will help us mitigate and contain&quot; the illness.

People who are ill should not go on airplanes, to school or other places, added Dr. Richard Besser, the acting head of the CDC.

Besser said the United States is working with the World Health Organization, Canada and Mexico as well as other organizations to reduce the spread of the virus, which appears to have originated in Mexico and has resulted in up to 81 deaths there. 

The CDC has issued advice on its Web site on how to avoid the sickness and how to react if people think they are infected. 

 Click here for the CDC Web site. 

&quot;Every outbreak is unique&quot; and it&apos;s very hard to say how long it will be before it&apos;s contained. But Besser said since it&apos;s near the end of flu season right now, a decline would be likely.

However, he added, &quot;We view this more as a marathon. We do think this will continue to spread but we are taking aggressive actions to minimize the impact on people&apos;s health.&quot; 

&quot;Even if this outbreak is a small one we can anticipate that we may have a subsequent of follow on outbreak in several months from now,&quot; Napolitano said.

In the U.S., 20 cases of swine flu have been confirmed in California, New York, Texas, Ohio and Kansas. Patients have ranged in age from 9 to over 50. Besser said that all the cases have resulted in recovery and one person remains hospitalized.

However, the same flu has sickened more than 1,324 in Mexico since April 13.

As the briefing was occurring, Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard announced that two more people died overnight in the capital of swine flu, and three other deaths are suspected to have been caused by the new strain. Ebrard said 73 more people have been hospitalized with influenza and authorities are investigating how many of them may have been infected with swine flu.

John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security, said President Obama has offered his full support to the Mexican government and people. Brennan said early communications and quick response will be the key to combating an outbreak. 

&quot;Early identification is vitally important,&quot; Brennan said. &quot;Communications have been robust and medical surveillance efforts are fully activated.&quot;

The incubation period for swine flu is 24-48 hours. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said despite reports Obama did not have a medical exam since it&apos;s been nine days since he left Mexico.

Gibbs said earlier Sunday that now is not the time to panic.

&quot;We are increasing the monitoring and preparedness that we would need to have in place in order to deal with any sort of emergency, but it is of concern to the White House,&quot; Gibbs said on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;

Israel, New Zealand, Spain, France and Canada have reported suspected isolated cases after citizens from those countries returned home from Mexico.

The Israeli Health Ministry said the biggest concern is a spread of the disease from person to person. 

&quot;The main route of contamination would be from person to person and not from pigs. There is no swine flu in pigs in Israel. There are not many pigs in Israel,&quot; said Dr. Hagai Levin.

&quot;You can not get the swine flu from eating pork,&quot; Napolitano said during the briefing.

Swine flu is dangerous because it changes its form and takes on characteristics like bird flu, and there is no vaccination, said Dr. Isador Rosenfeld, a FOX News contributor.

However, Baxter International Inc. of Illinois is working with the World Health Organization on a potential vaccine, the company announced Sunday.

&quot;Baxter has the R&amp;D pandemic planning and expertise to develop vaccines for emerging diseases and viruses,&quot; Baxter spokesman Christopher Bona told FOX News. &quot;Upon learnign about the swine flu outbreak, Baxter requested a sample of the virus from the WHO to begin lab testing for developing a potential experimental vaccine.&quot;

Rosenfeld said swine flu is usually a mild infection. He suggested staying away from crowded places where people are sneezing and coughing and washing hands. But he said he&apos;s a bit confounded about why so many people in Mexico have died because swine flu does respond to Tamiflu and other anti-viral medicines.

&quot;This thing is treatable,&quot; he said.&quot;



Now, just because you know it&apos;s treatable, doesn&apos;t mean you can still eat it. The question is, &quot;What will it cost you in health, and is it really worth it?

 You Are Being Lied to About Pirates 
 Some are clearly just gangsters. But others are trying to stop illegal dumping and trawling 
 Johann Hari


Who imagined that in 2009, the world&apos;s governments would be declaring a new War on Pirates? As you read this, the British Royal Navy backed by the ships of more than two dozen nations, from the US to China is sailing into Somalian waters to take on men we still picture as parrot-on-the-shoulder pantomime villains. They will soon be fighting Somalian ships and even chasing the pirates onto land, into one of the most broken countries on earth. But behind the arrr-me-hearties oddness of this tale, there is an untold scandal. The people our governments are labelling as &quot;one of the great menaces of our times&quot; have an extraordinary story to tell and some justice on their side.

Pirates have never been quite who we think they are. In the &quot; golden age of piracy &quot; from 1650 to 1730 the idea of the pirate as the senseless, savage Bluebeard that lingers today was created by the British government in a great propaganda heave. Many ordinary people believed it was false: pirates were often saved from the gallows by supportive crowds. Why? What did they see that we can&apos;t? In his book Villains Of All Nations, the historian Marcus Rediker pores through the evidence.

If you became a merchant or navy sailor then plucked from the docks of London&apos;s East End, young and hungry you ended up in a floating wooden Hell. You worked all hours on a cramped, half-starved ship, and if you slacked off, the all-powerful captain would whip you with the Cat O&apos; Nine Tails . If you slacked often, you could be thrown overboard. And at the end of months or years of this, you were often cheated of your wages.

Pirates were the first people to rebel against this world. They mutinied and created a different way of working on the seas. Once they had a ship, the pirates elected their captains, and made all their decisions collectively, without torture. They shared their bounty out in what Rediker calls &quot;one of the most egalitarian plans for the disposition of resources to be found anywhere in the eighteenth century&quot;.

They even took in escaped African slaves and lived with them as equals. The pirates showed &quot;quite clearly and subversively that ships did not have to be run in the brutal and oppressive ways of the merchant service and the Royal Navy .&quot; This is why they were romantic heroes, despite being unproductive thieves.

The words of one pirate from that lost age, a young British man called William Scott , should echo into this new age of piracy. Just before he was hanged in Charleston, South Carolina , he said: &quot;What I did was to keep me from perishing. I was forced to go a-pirateing to live.&quot; In 1991, the government of Somalia collapsed. Its nine million people have been teetering on starvation ever since and the ugliest forces in the Western world have seen this as a great opportunity to steal the country&apos;s food supply and dump our nuclear waste in their seas.

Yes: nuclear waste. As soon as the government was gone, mysterious European ships started appearing off the coast of Somalia, dumping vast barrels into the ocean. The coastal population began to sicken. At first they suffered strange rashes, nausea and malformed babies. Then, after the 2005 tsunami, hundreds of the dumped and leaking barrels washed up on shore. People began to suffer from radiation sickness, and more than 300 died.

 Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah , the UN envoy to Somalia , tells me: &quot;Somebody is dumping nuclear material here. There is also lead, and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury you name it.&quot; Much of it can be traced back to European hospitals and factories, who seem to be passing it on to the Italian mafia to &quot;dispose&quot; of cheaply . When I asked Mr Ould-Abdallah what European governments were doing about it, he said with a sigh: &quot;Nothing. There has been no clean-up, no compensation, and no prevention.&quot;

At the same time, other European ships have been looting Somalia&apos;s seas of their greatest resource: seafood. We have destroyed our own fish stocks by overexploitation and now we have moved on to theirs. More than $300m-worth of tuna, shrimp, and lobster are being stolen every year by illegal trawlers . The local fishermen are now starving. Mohammed Hussein, a fisherman in the town of Marka 100km south of Mogadishu, told Reuters: &quot;If nothing is done, there soon won&apos;t be much fish left in our coastal waters.&quot;

This is the context in which the &quot;pirates&quot; have emerged. Somalian fishermen took speedboats to try to dissuade the dumpers and trawlers, or at least levy a &quot;tax&quot; on them. They call themselves the Volunteer Coastguard of Somalia and ordinary Somalis agree. The independent Somalian news site WardheerNews found 70 per cent &quot;strongly supported the piracy as a form of national defence&quot;.

No, this doesn&apos;t make hostage-taking justifiable, and yes, some are clearly just gangsters especially those who have held up World Food Programme supplies. But in a telephone interview, one of the pirate leaders, Sugule Ali: &quot;We don&apos;t consider ourselves sea bandits. We consider sea bandits [to be] those who illegally fish and dump in our seas.&quot; William Scott would understand.

Did we expect starving Somalians to stand passively on their beaches, paddling in our toxic waste, and watch us snatch their fish to eat in restaurants in London and Paris and Rome? We won&apos;t act on those crimes the only sane solution to this problem but when some of the fishermen responded by disrupting the transit-corridor for 20 per cent of the world&apos;s oil supply, we swiftly send in the gunboats.

The story of the 2009 war on piracy was best summarised by another pirate, who lived and died in the fourth century BC. He was captured and brought to Alexander the Great, who demanded to know &quot;what he meant by keeping possession of the sea.&quot; The pirate smiled, and responded: &quot;What you mean by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, while you, who do it with a great fleet, are called emperor.&quot; Once again, our great imperial fleets sail but who is the robber?

 It&apos;s not always who you know. Sometimes, it&apos;s in the knowing. Period! 

 Whenever I get goodies like this, I must pass it on! 

 Enjoy! 

 

 I would like to tell you of the benefits of that plain little ole bottle of 3% peroxide you can get for under $1.00 at any
drug store.  What does bleach cost?  My husband has been in the
medical field for over 36 years, and most doctors don&apos;t tell you
about peroxide.


&quot;Have you ever smelled bleach in a doctor&apos;s office?

NO!!!  Why?  Because it smells, and it is not healthy!  Ask
the nurses who work in the doctor&apos;s offices, and ask them if they use bleach at home.  They are wiser and know better!


&quot;Did you also know bleach was invented in the late 40&apos;s?  It&apos;s
chlorine, folks!  And it was used to kill our troops.


&quot;Peroxide was invented during WWI.  It was used to save and
help cleanse the needs of our troops and hospitals.  Please think
about this: 

 
1. Take one capful (the little white cap that comes with the bottle) and hold in your mouth for 10 minutes daily, then spit it out.  (I do it when I bathe.)  No more canker sores , and your teeth will be whiter without expensive pastes. Use it instead of mouthwash..


2. Let your toothbrushes soak in a cup of peroxide to keep them free of germs.

3. Clean your counters and table tops with peroxide to kill germs and leave a fresh smell.  Simply put a little on your dishrag when you wipe, or spray it on the counters.

4. After rinsing off your wooden cutting board, pour peroxide on it to kill salmonella and other bacteria.


5. I had fungus on my feet for years until I sprayed a 50/50 mixture of peroxide and water on them (especially the toes) every night and let dry.


6. Soak any infections or cuts in 3% peroxide for five to ten minutes several times a day. My husband has seen gangrene that would not heal with any medicine but was healed by soaking in peroxide.


7. Fill a spray bottle with a 50/50 mixture of peroxide and water and keep it in every bathroom to disinfect withou t harming your septic system like bleach or most other disinfectants will.

8. Tilt your head back and spray into nostrils with your 50/50 mixture whenever you have a cold, plugged sinus.  It will bubble and help to kill the bacteria.  Hold for a few minutes, and then blow your nose into a tissue.


9. If you have a terrible toothache and cannot get to a dentist right away, put a capful of 3% peroxide into your mouth and hold it for ten minutes several times a day.  The pain will lessen greatly.

10. Put half a bottle of peroxide in your bath to help rid boils, fungus, or other skin infections.

11. You can also add a cup of peroxide instead of bleach to a load of whites in your laundry to whiten them.  If there is blood on clothing, pour it directly on the soiled spot.  Let it sit for a minute, then rub it and rinse with cold water . Repeat if necessary.

12. I use peroxide to clean my mirrors.  There is no smearing, which is why I love it so much for this.

I could go on and on.  It is a little brown bottle no home
should be without!

&quot;With prices of most necessities rising, I&apos;m glad there&apos;s a way to
save tons of money in such a simple, healthy manner!&quot;


This information really woke me up.  I hope you gain something from

it, too. Pass this on .. and on ... and on!

 FOOD PRODUCTION IN THE AGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE

 An Afternoon and Evening Showcase Featuring Local Women in Healthy Food Creation

BIG: Blacks In Green™, one of the nations most diverse environmental organizations will hold their monthly Third
Friday Afternoon Workshop Series and Evening Networking Program at Little Black Pearl Art&amp;Design Center
Friday, March 20, 2009 from 3:00-8:30pm. The evening is divided into two segments; BIGWorks™, the Afternoon
Workshop Series, from 3:00-5:30pm and BIGDrinks™, the Evening Networking Program, from 5:30-8:30pm.

“We need a lot more hands willing to get dirty in order to feed ourselves in Illinois”, says Naomi Davis, Founder and
President of BIG. “Out West, Van Jones urges a whole new agenda for sustainable food systems. Out East our “green
cousin” Michael Pollan urges the new Farmer-in-Chief to put our food system “back on sunlight” to reverse fossil fuel
farming. Here in the Midwest, it’s the folks featured in our program this month”, comments Davis.

In every culture, women play a major role in food production. Their vital contributions toward a more conscious and
sustainable food system will be the focus of this month’s events.

The BIGWorks™ workshop series, entitled “Options For City Farming”, will be led by Martha Boyd, Program Director,
Urban Initiative/Chicago for Angelic Organics Learning Center, a regional leader focused on helping urban and rural
people build local food systems. Boyd will discuss viable alternatives for growing healthy food and building a better
quality of life through urban agricultural leadership. The BIGDrinks™ program, entitled “Global Women Feed the Soul”
will begin with a breakout performance debut by LaDonna Redmond, nationally renowned good food expert, followed
with special presentations by eight local farming and food production influentials, including Debbie Hillman of the Illinois
Local and Organic Food&amp;Farm Task Force, Joharie Cole of Iyabo Organic Farms, and Madeim Kawa, Washington
Park’s Nature Area Steward and Founder of the Washington Park Conservancy, among other special guests.

Admission is $10.00 for BIGWorks™ and $5.00 for BIGDrinks™.

A vegan buffet will be provided by chef Tsadakeeyah Emmanuel of Majani 310 at $5.00 per plate
and beer/wine will be served for $4.00 per bottle/glass.

Little Black Pearl Art&amp;Design Center, a BIG Hub in the Hood’™ is located at 1060 E. 47th Street in Chicago.

 This bears repeating! 




 
Are you still eating and cooking the old fashioned way?

 What will you do when there&apos;s no food at the grocery store or 

 because you can&apos;t afford to buy it? 

 

 If you answered YES to either of these questions, then you may want to start thinking about the food of the future! 

 

 As a child, I hated picking and chopping cotton more than I hated planting beans, peas and all kinds of other vegetables. Now that I&apos;m an adult, I can appreciate the finer things of life. Eating, is definitely one of the finer things in life. Not everyone can sit down to a healthy, filling meal. 

 There will come a time when those who don&apos;t know how to prepare their meals, WON&apos;T EAT! 

 Don&apos;t believe it? Just watch and experience the weather! Global warming affects our lives in more ways than one. You can&apos;t eat what&apos;s not there, and you sure can&apos;t eat what you can&apos;t afford. 

 If you take it aunlawfully, there are repercussions.  Get ahead of the game. Be informed. Prepare now.

 In this journey called LIFE, we often meet people for a short period of time that bring us so much more than we ever bargained for. This young lady is a former business partner (a great business partner!) and friend who brings so much to the table (literally) that I had to share it with you. You say to yourself, &quot;How Can This Little Lady Tell Me About Weight Loss and She Doesn&apos;t Even Weigh That Much?&quot; Well, once you read her story, you&apos;ll understand why.

 As an advocate of higher learning, I make it my business to find out where the scholarship money is for students to attend school FREE OF CHARGE! 

 Florida A&amp;M University FREE Female Scholarship 

 
 
If you have friends, daughters, granddaughters, nieces, cousins, neighbors, church, or social organizations who can benefit from this, please, please, please pass it on!* *

Florida A&amp;M University http://www.famu.edu/index.cfm 

is providing an outstanding opportunity for Black women entering college in the fall of 2009. It is designed to address their absence in the field of computer technology.



Dr. Jason Black is the Principal Investigator of a recently awarded $552,000 NSF Grant entitled African-American Women in Computer Science.

The grant provides scholarships from $3,000 to $5,000 per semester for female African American students .* *We need your help to get the word out about this GREAT opportunity to build up the enrollment of women in the CIS Department.

Pass this information along to high school or community college students, their parents, and to guidance counselors you may know. The full text of the press release can be found at:*  http://www.famu.edu/?a=headlines&amp;p=display&amp;news=602 

The program, entitled African-American Women in Computer Science, (AAWCS), is a four-year program that provides scholarships and other assistance to women who express a financial need and an interest in computer science or information technology. Women who apply to AAWCS will be accepted based on financial need, and will be awarded a scholarship of between $3,000 and $5,000 per semester. In addition to the funding, the women will participate in CIS departmental clubs and organizations, such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Club, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and the CIS Mentoring Organization (CISMO). AAWCS scholars will also be involved in other STEM programs, such as the Florida/Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) scholarship program, and the Students and Technology in Academia, Research and Service (STARS) Alliance, both NSF-funded programs.

An added benefit to the students is the conference participation, where selected AAWCS scholars will be chosen to attend two national conferences, paid for by the grant, each year, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing and the National Conference of Women in Information Technology (NCWIT).

The program begins July 1 and will last until June 30, 2012.

Applications for the program can be requested by contacting Mr. Black at   jblack@cis.famu.edu or (850) 412-7354.

 Harvard University has announced that undergraduate students from low-income families will pay no tuition. In making the announcement, former Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers said, &quot;When only ten percent of the students in elite higher education come from families in the lower half of the income distribution, we are not doing enough. We are not doing enough in bringing elite higher education to the lower half of the income distribution.&quot; If you know of a family earning less than $60,000 a year with an honor student graduating from high school soon, Harvard University wants to pay the tuition . The prestigious university recently announced that undergraduate students from low-income families can go to Harvard for free... no tuition and no student loans!

                    N&apos;Spiration for the SouL! 

 Now this is true inspiration! 

 A Republican turning DEMOCRATIC! 

 Colin Powell endorses Obama 
 

-- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell announced Sunday that he will be voting for Sen. Barack Obama, citing the Democrat&apos;s &quot;ability to inspire&quot; and the &quot;inclusive nature of his campaign.&quot; 
 
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell says he is voting for Barack Obama.
 
&quot;I think he is a transformational figure, he is a new generation coming onto the world stage, onto the American stage, and for that reason I&apos;ll be voting for Sen. Barack Obama,&quot; Powell said on NBC&apos;s &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;

Powell said he was concerned about what he characterized as a recent negative turn of Republican candidate Sen. John McCain&apos;s campaign, such as the campaign&apos;s attempts to tie Obama to former 1960s radical Bill Ayers.

&quot;I think that&apos;s inappropriate. I understand what politics is about -- I know how you can go after one another, and that&apos;s good. But I think this goes too far, and I think it has made the McCain campaign look a little narrow. It&apos;s not what the American people are looking for,&quot; he said.

 Powell , a retired U.S. general and a Republican, was once seen as a possible presidential candidate himself.

Powell said he has some concerns about the direction of the Republican Party, adding that it has &quot;moved more to the right than I would like to see it.&quot; Read a transcript of Powell&apos;s remarks 

In regard to the financial crisis, which Powell called the candidates&apos; &quot;final exam,&quot; Powell said McCain appeared unsteady in dealing with it, while Obama had excelled in handling the situation.

 Transcript of Powell&apos;s endorsement McCain picks up endorsement Election Center 2008 
 
&quot; Obama displayed a steadiness, an intellectual curiosity, a depth of knowledge,&quot; Powell said. Watch what Powell says about Obama » 

&quot;He has met the standard of being a successful president, being an exceptional president,&quot; he said.

Obama praised Powell at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Sunday, calling him &quot;a great soldier, a great statesman, and a great American.&quot;

&quot;I have been honored to have the benefit of his wisdom and counsel from time to time over the last few years, but today, I am beyond honored and deeply humbled to have the support of General Colin Powell,&quot; Obama said.

Obama called Powell earlier Sunday and thanked him for his endorsement, communications director Robert Gibbs said. iReport.com: Obama supporters react to endorsement 

In their 10-minute conversation, Obama said he looked forward to taking advantage of Powell&apos;s advice in the next two weeks and hopefully over the next four years, Gibbs said.

During the campaign, Powell has met with both candidates and said he has a lot of respect for McCain. He said Sunday that he thinks both candidates are qualified to be president.

&quot;It isn&apos;t easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that,&quot; Powell said.

Speaking on Fox News Sunday, McCain said he respects and admires Powell, and the announcement &quot;doesn&apos;t come as a surprise.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m also very pleased to have the endorsement of four former secretaries of state -- Secretaries [Henry] Kissinger, [James] Baker, [Lawrence] Eagleburger, and [Alexander] Haig -- and I&apos;m proud to have the endorsement of well over 200 retired Army generals and admirals,&quot; McCain said.

Powell served as Secretary of State under President Bush from 2001 to 2005.

The possibility of a Powell endorsement has been rumored for several months.

On August 13, Powell&apos;s office denied a report on Fox News by commentator Bill Kristol that Powell had decided to publicly back Obama at the Democratic National Convention.

Powell himself brushed off queries on any potential presidential nod but told ABC News in August that he would not be going to Denver, Colorado, for the convention.

Back in February, Powell told CNN&apos;s Wolf Blitzer that he was weighing an endorsement of a Democratic or independent candidate.

Powell has offered praise for Obama, calling him an &quot;exciting person on the political stage.&quot;

&quot;He has energized a lot of people in America,&quot; said Powell. &quot;He has energized a lot of people around the world. And so I think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for.&quot;

The former general, who has largely steered clear of politics since leaving the Bush administration, noted that the next president will need to work to restore America&apos;s standing in the world.
 
Powell gave the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in support of George W. Bush in 2000.

Powell said Sunday that he has no plans to campaign for Obama.

 Higher Learning Networks mission is to promote higher learning in various forms. 

This is one of them. Take heed if you really want to see change! Here&apos;s the emaill.

---------Original Message---------
From: David Plouffe , BarackObama.com 
Subject: BREAKING: Latest numbers

Friend --

A record 100,000 people rallied with Barack in St. Louis yesterday, and another 75,000 in Kansas City last night. Back in Chicago, we were tallying up our latest fundraising numbers.

Supporters like you have completely transformed how political campaigns raise money, so I wanted you to be the first to know how we did in September.

 I recorded a short video to share the latest numbers: 

 
 
When Barack entered this race, he put his faith in the power of ordinary supporters like you coming together and building a movement for change from the bottom up.

That&apos;s exactly how we got this far -- and you should feel proud of all we have accomplished together.

But with just 16 days left in this election, we can&apos;t slow down now. Please take a minute to watch the video and find out where we stand:

 I make it my personal business to attend the monthly networking meeting at the West Side Ministers Coalition at the Garfield Park Reflectory just west of Jackson Blvd. and Central for a variety of reasons.  

 None of those reasons are more important than the information I gain every single month. Last month I was given a flyer (as is everyone who attends ) with tons of information. I even worked out a deal where I got a NEW COMPUTOR, 1 DAY AFTER MINE CRASHED! IS GOD GOOD OR WHAT?? 

 Not only did I get that information for me, but I make sure I pass on everything else I can get that may help someone else. I hope you will do the same! This info is priceless! 

 EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER is available. 

 Rent Assistance, utilities and other amenities are available from Healthy Families Chicago.

 Mothers are often overlooked when they need help. It&apos;s a serious job taking care of tomorrow&apos;s future. Many have no help from family and are only a crisis away. If you know of a family in crisis (Death, divorce, fire, eviction, etc.) where children are involved and they are in need of help, please pass this information along. Help is here! 

 Mothers in crisis need a break!

 I recently found out a girlfriend of mine had been keeping a secret from me. I wondered why she was losing weight and looking so good! I knew she was NOT on a diet, because she doesn&apos;t do diets. 

 We go dancing weekly and she even dances all night long, and she weighs well over 300 pounds! Not anymore! Since she&apos;s been drinking this water, I can see her ankles as well as her waist (Never knew she had one!) is even showing now. She hasn&apos;t worn a belt in over 20 years I&apos;m sure.  

 I&apos;m not mad at her, but I think she could have told me about this water. I already knew about Alkaline water, and how it reduces the toxins in our systems. I already knew it was good for us, but with our busy lives, we sometimes forget what we know we need to do. I&apos;d completely forgotten until I saw her a month ago and seen how she&apos;s dropped some weight with her new LIQUID WORKOUT! And she&apos;s not even swimming! All she&apos;s doing is drinking the water! 

 So now I am drinking the water. People are asking me the same question, what am I doing? I now say the same thing. I am drinking the water and having a LIQUID WORKOUT TOO! I don&apos;t exercise, all I do is walk (never enough) and drink plenty of this water, every hour on the hour! 

 I drink it when I have a headache, back ache, carpet tunnel. PMS and pretty much any other ailment I have. It just doesn&apos;t stop! Now you know why I feel the way I do and look the way I do. It&apos;s the water! Do yourself a favor and do the investigation yourself. DON&apos;T BELEIVE A WORD I SAY! SEE FOR YOURSELF. 

 Visit the sites and watch your life, your health and your way of being turn into something you never even imagined. Here&apos;s to your health! 

 I&apos;ll drink to that! 

 P.S. Ask yourself this question, and then answer it! 



 

 Is the water you drink, making you sick?

I am truly inspired that women have become conscious about how the decisions they make today, affect their futures tomorrow. What concerns me is the amount of women who have yet to take control of their destiny, still living in the industrial age, believing that someone other than themselves, are in control.

When you see a woman falling by the wayside, it is your civic, and human duty to help her, not chastise her. Women businesses are the largest growing businesses in the economy. It should be no surprise, but it still is to many.

That dream you&apos;ve been putting off will not go away. It&apos;s probably one of the reasons why you can&apos;t sleep at night. Dreams are there for a reason. Learn from it. Get quiet and ask yourself a few questions, like where do I begin?

Don&apos;t like talking to yourself because you think people will call you crazy? Think agagin, especially after you read my article at

 You often ask me where I get my inspiration from.  Well now you know. I watch and listen to a lot of comedy shows and comedians. It&apos;s simply the best prescription available on the planet and it FREE! 

 Do like Bernie and Isaac did, enjoy each moment to the fullest, no matter what they say, cause&apos; they&apos;re gonna say something anyway! 

I had the pleasure of enjoying their gifts like millions of other did. Let&apos;s enjoy it one more time.!
 Whenever I am having a challenging day, I find the time to see or listen to something funny.  Science proves it&apos;s a natural healer! 
You don&apos;t event need to see a doctor.

It saddens me that Chicago and the world has lost one of my favorite comedians, the Mac Man himself, Bernie Mac.

 Every since I can remember, I&apos;ve always been a fan of poet/author/screenwriter Dr. Maya Angelou. Writing is my first passion, as is hers. I only hope to touch people in a special way, as she has with her words. One of my favorite memories is interviewing her while on air at WJPC in Chicago. Below is update on Dr. Maya. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. 
 The Meaning of Independence Original Air Date: July 1, 2008 
 Listen in to part of the show! 

In honor of the Fourth of July, Dr. Angelou talks to callers about their views on independence and what it means to them. &quot;I think that this holiday is probably the least thought of of the holidays we observe in the year,&quot; Dr. Angelou says. &quot;Whatever color, our religious loyalties, we are all Americans. As independent people, we have certain inalienable rights. That is really revolutionary.&quot;

One caller remembers that, as a young girl, her mother told her to choose what religion she wanted to be. &quot;That enabled me to study all religions and not hold any prejudices or judgments on anyone,&quot; she says. &quot;I’m free. I wasn’t raised a certain religion, so I don’t feel uncomfortable or confused as to what is right and what is wrong. I actually have an advantage, I think.&quot;

Another caller says that after returning from months in India, she noticed that her American friends didn’t talk about their independence and seemed to take it for granted. &quot;We have a voice here in America,&quot; she says. &quot;People are looking toward us, listening to how we live our lives so they can decide if that’s how they want to live their lives too.&quot;

Other callers talk about living free of prejudices, ancestry, the beauty and spirit of America, the American dream and our human rights. &quot;Whatever you do that enlivens, inspires and uplifts another human being, is done for all human beings,&quot; Dr. Angelou says.


 Talk about Dr. Angelou&apos;s show! About Dr. Angelou 
One of the most influential voices in contemporary literature, Dr. Angelou has authored countless bestselling books, including her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , and the Pulitzer Prize nominated collection of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water &apos;Fore I Diiie . She has moved generations with her talent and passion for social change and is recognized around the world as a leading civil rights activist. Dr. Angelou has written, produced, directed and starred in productions for stage, film and television. She received an Emmy® nomination for Best Supporting Actress in Roots in 1977. In 1981, Dr. Angelou was appointed to a lifetime position as the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University. In January 1993, she became only the second poet in United States history to have the honor of writing and reciting original work at the Presidential Inauguration.

 About Dr. Angelou&apos;s Show 
Hailed as a remarkable Renaissance woman, a beloved poet and best-selling author, Dr. Angelou has the unique ability to captivate listeners through the vigor and sheer beauty of her lyrics and words. A world renowned educator and historian, critically acclaimed actress, playwright, producer and director and leading civil rights activist, Dr. Angelou shares her legendary wisdom to help listeners find their true voices. Taking on issues spanning race, sex, age and religion, Dr. Angelou&apos;s extraordinary insight will continually challenge and inspire listeners.

 When was the last time you tried something new? 

 Do you often find yourself doing the same things all the time? 

 Life has too much to offer to live a routine life. 

 Most of keep doing the same things over and over in life because we don&apos;t want to risk being seen as foolish or embarrassing.  

 Sometimes things do happen to us in which we are embarrassed, but that&apos;s ok! This is truly one of the times when you are really living, being ALIVE! 

 Risk is where the rewards are. 

 Next time you feel yourself in a routine that you&apos;re bored with, try something new! I did! I risked being embarrassed by doing something I always wanted to do, but knew I wasn&apos;&apos; good at. Guess what is was. 

 I played pool! No, I wasn&apos;t that good at it. As a matter of fact, I really sucked! Pool is not my area of expertise, but I sure did have fun! Who cares I couldn&apos;t play that well! There were too many others who were doing just as rotten as I was to even care!  

 So, what does that tell you? 

 Go ahead and have some fun and risk being seen as foolish! 

 At least you had some fun, right? 

 This is what higher learning is all about. 

 When you can get to a point in your life where you risk something, you are usually rewarded for it in some kind of way. Whether it helps your self esteem, gives you a new sense of accomplishment or just got out of doing the normal routine of things.  

 It&apos;s really no fun being normal, living in a routine or rut, when you really don&apos;t have to. Life is to short. So pick up a pool stick (or anything else) and risk being rewarded! 

                                             archives 

 When was the last time you sat down and had a good conversation with yourself? Sounds crazy? Well, it can be no more crazy than this wacky world we currently live in. So why not have a conversation with yourself? After all, you&apos;re the one with all the answers.  

 Say you don&apos;t know? Of course you do.  

 You just don&apos;t trust yourself.    

 It&apos;s not your fault. You&apos;ve been trained this way.  

 We&apos;ve all been trained to trust other people&apos;s opinions over our own. From the time we were children until now. 

 It&apos;s the way of the world. Now that you&apos;re old enough to know better, it&apos;s time to do better. You can begin the process by listening to yourself. Listening how? You&apos;ve got to learn how to TUNE IN to yourself, just as if you were watching TV or listening to the radio. Catch!  

 You can tune in better when no one else is around. Why?  

 Because you&apos;ve got their energy, as well as your own energy realm to handle. It&apos;s just easier when you&apos;re dealing with yourself, alone! 

 Do yourself a favor and SCHEDULE some ME time! 

 Go to the library, closet, bathroom or anywhere else you can to get some QUIET TIME and read a few verses of my favorite GET TO KNOW SELF books.  

 Louise Hay - You Can Heal Your Life or Celebrate Yourself! 

 Forgot the Author, but the book is entitled: What Would You Do If You Had No Fear? 

 Eckhart Tolle - The Power of NOW! 

 Marianne Williamson - anything you read of hers is good, and last but not least. A Course in Miracles. 

 If you don&apos;t feel a shift in your consciousness after reading these books, email me and let&apos;s see what&apos;s really going on in your life! 

 Enjoy!

 Gas - A Little Help, from Ray Robin, Azar
TIPS ON PUMPING GAS I don&apos;t know what you people are paying for gasoline.... but here in California we are also paying higher, up to $3.50 per gallon. But my line of work is in petroleum for about 31 years now, so here are some tricks to get more of your money&apos;s worth for every gallon.. Here at the Kinder Morgan Pipeline where I work in San Jose , CA we deliver about 4 million gallons in a 24-hour period thru the pipeline. One day is diesel the next day is jet fuel, and gasoline, regular and premium grades. We have 34- storage tanks here with a total capacity of 16,800,000 gallons.
 1. Only buy or fill up your car or truck in the early morning when the ground temperature is still cold. Remember that all service stations have their storage tanks buried below ground. The colder the ground the more dense the gasoline, when it gets warmer gasoline expands, so buying in the afternoon or in the evening.... your gallon is not exactly a gallon. In the petroleum business, the specific gravity and the temperature of the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, ethanol and other petroleum products plays an important role. A 1-degree rise in temperature is a big deal for this business. But the service stations do not have temperature compensation at the pumps.
 2. When you&apos;re filling up do not squeeze the trigger of the nozzle to a fast mode. If you look you will see that the trigger has three (3 )stages: low, middle, and high. In slow mode you should be pumping on low speed, thereby minimizing the vapors that are created while you are pumping. All hoses at the pump have a vapor return. If you are pumping on the fast rate, some other liquid that goes to your tank becomes vapor. Those vapors are being sucked up and back into the underground storage tank so you&apos;re getting less worth for your money.
 3. One of the most important tips is to fill up when your gas tank is HALF FULL or HALF EMPTY. The reason for this is, the more gas you have in your tank the less air occupying its empty space. Gasoline evaporates faster than you can imagine. Gasoline storage tanks have an internal floating roof. This roof serves as zero clearance between the gas and the atmosphere, so it minimizes the evaporation. Unlike service stations, here where I work, every truck that we load is temperature compensated so that every gallon is actually the exact amount.
 4. Another reminder, if there is a gasoline truck pumping into the storage tanks when you stop to buy gas, DO NOT fill up--most likely the gasoline is being stirred up as the gas is being delivered, and you might pick up some of the dirt that normally settles on the bottom. Hope this will help you get the most value for your money.

 This week&apos;s inspiration came from another email from a subscriber. 

 Enjoy! 

 I wonder what would happen if we treated our Bible
like we treat our cell phone?

What if we carried it around in our purses or pockets?

What if we flipped through it several time a day?

What if we turned back to go get it if we forgot it?

What if we used it to receive messages from the text?

What if we treated it like we couldn&apos;t live without it?

What if we gave it to Kids as gifts?

What if we used it when we traveled?

What if we used it in case of emergency?

This is something to make you go....hmm...where is my Bible?

Oh, and one more thing. Unlike our cell phone, we don&apos;t
have to worry about our Bible being disconnected because God already paid the bill.

Makes you stop and think &apos;where are my priorities&apos;?

And no dropped calls!

P.S. DO WHAT YOU THINK GOD WOULD WANT YOU TO DO WITH THIS

 Life is so full we sometimes forget that we have unused talents. 

 I recently facillitated a job fair with the West Side Ministers Coalition for ex-offenders. As I listened to some of the stories of how people are trapped in their life story, it reminded me of the fact that one of the most productive ways to move past that part of life is to tell that story.  

 To go beyond just telling that story, is to benefit from the story. Many of the participants wanted to tell their story, so the idea came to put that story on paper, publish it and earn income from it. This is a great way to earn extra income and help others in the process. 

 Remember, it is a process. Anything worth having usually takes a little time for it to materialize. As a self published author of several books and a dozen training manuals, I bear witness of what&apos;s possible. 

 Self Publish and keep 100% Profit is the name of the upcoming workshop to be taped at 

 Chicago Access Televsion 

 322 S. Green Street (ENTER CORNER ENTRANCE NEAR Van Buren St.) 

 Friday May 2nd 

 5:30-87:30pm 

 MUST RSVP for seat at 

 HigherLearningNw@yahoo.com 

 The only way to control your destiny, is to move on it. This could be a great financial blessing for those wishing to do the work to make it happen. Please feel free to share this info with those who are poets, spoken word artists, novelists, etc. You&apos;ll be blessed abundantly. 

 We&apos;ve all got a story. If we&apos;re gonna continue to tell it, then we may as well benefit from it. Don&apos;t you think?

 Have you fed your ego lately?

 What do I mean my that? 

 Have you looked at yourself and seen something other than what you see in the mirror? 

 How can that be? Easy. (Not really, it does take some inner reflection) 

 Look beyond the mirror, and see the essence of who and what you really are. That&apos;s no easy task. Some of us see something we don&apos;t like or want to see, that&apos;s what&apos;s so awesome about seeing yourself beyond the ego. Some of us are still stuck in our childhood, not being able to get beyond the voices in our heads. 

 Most of what we see when we look in ghe mirror, is an image we&apos;ve sold ourselves on. (Or something the media has sold us) The outer wear (clothing, jewelry, makeup, etc.) is simply a cover for the real you. Of course we can&apos;t go outside naked (not in Chicago anyway :)but everytime we reveal a part of ourselves never exposed is just like being naked. It&apos; s what we refer to as being vulnerable.  

 Being in a vulnerable position may seem like being in a place you don&apos;t want to be, but it&apos;s in that space that you can begin to discover things about yourself that you never knew. I never knew I could sing! (Not really, just in the shower) I mean I can sing the national anthem, but don&apos;t put me against Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle or Anita Baker. I can sing within my limits (in the shower) but not on a grand scale.  

 Everytime I open myself to ridicule by opening my mouth and trying to sing, I put myself on the line because my ego says I can sing, even though I know darn well I can&apos;t.  One thing I can do, and that is to voice a song.  Speak it, not with melody, but with rythm. What does that have to do with anything? Nothing. Just thougth it sounded good! The power of the ego! Get my point. Being vulnerable is not so bad after all. So says the ego. Oh well.

 ******MORE ARCHIVES ******** J ust over a year or so ago, I met a simply delightful young man at a Les Brown Live Your Dreams Conference . What was so special about this young man is that he was passionate about his practice as well as his life! He is the kind of physician that you want your family and everyone you know, to go to in their time of need. That young man is known to me, as Dr. Z. (It&apos;s a &quot;Z&quot; thing!) We talked at length during our breakout sessions, and I really enjoyed his with, c harm and sense of humor. More importantly, I enjoyed the opportunity to talk to a doctor who didn&apos;t have his head up his rear end! 
 I even subscribed to his weekly newsletter. which is so power packed that this week I must share it with you because I am currently experiencing something in my life that I realize is a process.  How appropriate, Dr. Z! Here&apos;s his latest newsletter: Enjoy! Dr John Zelem is a successful practicing General Surgeon of over 25 years. During the last couple of years he has also transitioned to become a motivational speaker and a process development coach. Even with his successes and challenges in life, Dr. Zelem realized that he was missing a process in his own personal life, and once he realized his own process , his life changed for the better.   By definition, a process is a series of events leading to a desired result. A good process will lead to a good result and a bad process will lead to a bad results. No process is all good or all bad but will be a combination of the two. Even with a good result there will be and should be challenges; that is what will help us gro Dr. Zelem, by sharing his own personal experiences, and occasionally teaming up with other powerful speakers, can help you and those people that are important to you realize their own process .  This is done through powerful, sometime humorous, sometimes emotional seminars.    
 As Dr. Zelem has learned: 

 The definition of insanity is doing the same thing everyday expecting different results If you continue to do what you have always done, you will continue to get what you have always gotten If you want to make some changes in your life, you have to make some changes in your life 

 Make some changes in your life and realize your process.

 Chinese Proverb about money 


 you can buy a house but not a home 


 with money 

 you can buy a clock 

 but not time 


 with money 

 you can buy a bed 

 but not sleep 


 with money 

 you can buy a book 

 but not knowledge 

 with money 

 you can see a doctor 

 but not good health 


 with money 

 you can buy a position 

 but not respect 

 with money 

 you can buy blood 

 but not life 

 with money 

 you can buy sex 

 but not love 

 with money you can buy a book 

 but not knowledge 

 This was sent to me by a viewer, now here&apos;s my 2 cents from ancient scripture: &quot;In all thy getting, get wisdom, knowlege and understanding.&quot; It will take you places money can&apos;t begin to penetrate.

 Life always brings new challenges, one of those challenges is death. During the Xmas season my high school friend&apos;s (Michale Coleman aka Crick) wife (Joyce Coleman) passed, and then New Year&apos;s Day my sister-in-law  (Annie Penn Robinson) made her transition. Two transistions in one week. 

 I&apos;m just very glad that I listened to my inner intution and called Annie at 2 o&apos;clock in the morning, just to say hi. When I called I was informed she was in the hospital, and probably not be able to speak. I knew then she&apos;d decided to leave this planet earth. I&apos;m also very grateful that I talke to her almost daily before she left, as we all knew her time was short. 

 The challenge now is to live life like there is no tomorrow. It makes me think about all the projects I want to complete before I leave the planet. It makes me think about how much work I&apos;ve got left to do before it&apos;s my time to check out. More importantly, it reminds me to keep in contact with people, the old fashioned way, by telephone.  

 There&apos;s nothing like the sound of the human voice. It&apos;s something you can&apos;t experience in an email. On the phone you can sometimes hear what&apos;s going on inside of the person. You can tell if they&apos;re happy, tired, stressed or just need to talk. 

 I&apos;s so glad I followed my first mind (intution) and called Annie Penn, so that I have no regrets. It&apos;s a constant challenge to stop what you&apos;re doing when you&apos;re in the middle of something, just to call someone. Sometimes it&apos;s worth it.  

 All the other times I called Annie Penn when she was able to talk was truly a blessing. I have no regrets. Even in her death, she taught lessons on living. For that I am grateful. I hope you can be as grateful and conquer the challenge of making a call when you need to, even if it&apos;s 2am in the morning.

 Higher Learning comes from higher listening, and higher action. 

 I&apos;ve been putting this off for years, but it&apos;s finally caught up with me.  

 People have been asking for this and now it&apos;s time for me to put or shut up. I prefer to speak up.    No longer can I avoid what&apos;s been destined . 

 I really need your assistance to make it happen. I can&apos;t do it alone.  

 I had help. You can get it too. Les Brown helped me figure it out. 

 I figured out sometime ago that how you are percieved in this life is directly related to how you communicate with others. Whether it&apos;s at home, work or social events, you will be judged by your peers. A promotion of any kind could be delayed, simply because you don&apos;t speak the LANGUAGE! 



 I was fortunate enought to have a speech coach, Mary Berger of the SPEAK STANDARD TOO Institute,  who gave me insight early on in my speaking career. This advice has really made a difference in the quality of live I&apos;ve lived as a professional speaker/radio/tv personality and life in general. 

 Visit her site at http://www.orchardbooksinc.com/workshopsclasses/workshoptestimonials.html 

 then come and join me for speaking class at Malcom X College in January. 



 If you plan to get ahead in life, it&apos;s crucial you have command of the English language. Not to say that you must aspire to be the next Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Les Brown on Tony Brown for that matter, it does matter how you speak.  



  Be sure and get a copy of a great book for speakers 

 Secrets of Superstar Speakers by Lilly Walters. 

 To take your speaking life to the next level, be sure and join me for Speaking Your Way to Success 101 at 

 Malcom X College beginning Jan. 23rd, Wednesdays 6-9pm.

 Learn to speak your way to success!  

 

 Motivational Speaker Les Brown spoke his way to the top, and he only had a second grade education! Now what&apos;s your excuse? 

 We can make it happen, but you must take the first step! 

 Remember, Higher Learning Begins Within: 
Trust The Process!

 My former co-worker Rick Party WGCI FM 107.5 (Currently in Miami, Fl.)  held the 2nd Annaul  &quot;I Rock The Mic&quot; Conference was this past weekend in Miami, Florida at the Conrad Miami Hotel. It was an event to go down in the halls of radio history. 

 Many of Chicago&apos;s beloved history makers were on hand to join in the festivities including honoring Chicago&apos;s own legendary Herb Kent, The Kool Gent who was honored for his pioneering spirit, celebrating 52 years in the business. (80 years young this month!) 

Honorees included green eyed Donnie Simpson,  host of back in the day Video Soul, as well as a tribute to The Hardest Working Man in Show Business, Tom Joyner, the origional  Fly Jock!   

 I even had the blessing to meet the legendary Ms. Irene Ware , who was on the air hosting Gospel Shows before I was even born! She&apos;s responsible for many of the record labels that exist today! I even met her son, President of major record label. 

 I even ran into my girl First Lady (Former Radio Personality WGCI) current Mid-Day Personality/Music Director/Asst. Program Director WTCL 106.7 FM , Indianapolis, Indiana who invited me to be keynote speaker at an upcoming women&apos;s empowerment seminar! 

 Crazy as a betsy bug Irene ( Mama Cita) Mojica (V103 Weekdays 7-11pm) even showed up and showed out, sharing her words of wisdom in the seminar of legendary Program Director of WGCI/V103&apos;s Elroy Smith. (Currently Operations Director for Radio One Philadelphia)  Irene taught us a few tricks of the trade and by just by being herself. (Which was one of Elroys top 10 things for jocks at his seminar entitled:  Radio Needs Personalities: Not D.J.&apos;s 

 I met more folk from Chicago ( that I really needed to network with ) that I never would have met, had I not gone to Miami, including New Program Director of V103, Derrrick Brown. I even met the Program Director of a local TV station! Look forward to seeing more of HLN on major network!  

 Mega Talented Businessman  Tony Gray was on hand to lend his expertise as well as other panelists ranging from Vibe Magazine Editor to Oscar Joyner (Tom Joyner&apos;s son) of REACH Media who held his own, breaking it down in the Integrated Marketing Seminar along with others from ABC Networks, Coz from WVON Radio : Talk of the Negro, and others. 

 Doug Banks hosted the evening gala sharing a heartfelt story of a young man whose father sold his truck, just so that his son could attend this seminar. Guess what? His son landed a job while there.  See what faith will do for you.   

 Speaking of faith, Walt Baby Love,  (the man whose shows I played every Saturday and Sunday Morning on Inspirational 1390 (formerly Gospel Radio 1390) was honored, reminding us all of the blessing it is to be recognized in this industry. 

 I even got to chat with Mitch Falker, the king of Imaging for many radio stations throughout the country, as well as Gino Jones, (formerly of WBMX, now in S. Carolina.  It was a radio personality&apos;s smorgasbord! Any one who has made a mark in this industry, and those trying to break into the industry was in atteendance. 

 The charming Santita Jackson  (Daughter of Jesse Jackson Sr.) blessed the gala with her operetic version of The Lords Prayer, and simply blew the roof off the ceiling! She&apos;s lost well over several hundred pounds and looking simply lovlier by the moment. (Look forward to hearing her amazing story on our TV show in the near future.) 

 We were blessed with Actress/Activist/Director Cheryl Lee Ralph (Origional Dream Girl, Stepmother on Moesha TV Show, etc.) who presented an outstanding performance for World Aids Day on December 1st! 

 Even Jonathan Adelstein, Commisioner of the FCC was on hand to share the truth about the direction of urban radio! This is a must see! You don&apos;t want to miss this series with  behind the scenes details of all the seminars we attended on the Higher Learning Network ZTV Show coming soon! (Chicago, Wisconsin and Minnesota)

 If that means working overtime (or start that business venture)

 It that means continuing to be in a relationship you don&apos;t enjoy, stay only until you can find your way out. 

 If that means trusting your Creator, until you can trust yourself, then learn to trust.

 How does the media affect your life? 

 If you think it doesn&apos;t, think again. 

 You&apos;re programmed from the time you get up in the morning, until what time you go to bed at night! Don&apos;t be embarrassed or ashamed about it, because the world is. It&apos;s not just you alone. 

 Wonder why we don&apos;t do certain things, a certain time of the year? 

 Wonder why we don&apos;t wear certain colors (White!) after labor day? That&apos;s because we allow the FASHION INDUSTRY to dictate what&apos;s in our closets. How often do you wear a BLACK TOP with your jeans, as opposed to any other color? 

 How often do you make it your business to be the FIRST IN LINE, or the FIRST IN YOUR BLOCK, JOB OR GROUP to get the latest in technology? (Crackberries, IPODS, ZUNES, CD&apos;s, DVD&apos;s, etc.) 

 Do you trade your car in every few years or so? 

 Do you take vacations at where the experts say you should go? 

 If you recognized yourself in any of these situations, then you&apos;ve been simply branded, or as they say in the movies, YOU&apos;RE IN THE MATRIX! NOT A BAD PLACE TO BE, OPPOSITE DEATH! 

 This is not to make you ashamed, simply to make you aware. 

 If you haven&apos;t seen how media controls America, then be sure and log on to www.cantv.org and watch the media marathon, Sunday Oct. 14th, 9am - 5pm on Ch. 21. If you missed it, log on to the site to see when it will air again.

 I know this is supposed to be an inspirational column, but sometimes you just need to vent. Today, I am venting, hopefully you&apos;ll get something inspirational from it. Hopefully, you won&apos;t make the same mistake. 
 
 I recently attended a gala where a local representatives were supposed to award some college students scholarships for school. About halfway through the program it appeared to me that this function was more about the WHO&apos;S WHO in Chicago, and had little to do with awarding funding for school.  

 How so? After I thought about all the money that was frivously spent for hosts and emcees, bringing in top name entertainment, $500 a plate dinners, and not to mention the $5,000 tables that sponsors bought (Where NO ONE from that organization showed up!) 

 I was really ticked off!  How could we in good conscious support such an event in a community that doesn&apos;t provide economic security for the people who this organization is supposed to represent? How can we spend thousand of dollars in a downtown hotel that cares less about us as a people, but will take our dollars. We could have taken those same dollars and invested them in our own community with people who live in our community, and look like us. 

 I guess the fact that we can afford to rent these fabulous rooms, drive our luxury cars and wear our designer gowns and tuxes, is a sign that we&apos;ve arrived. But have we really? 

 The only thing  I could see from this event that we arrived at is the fact that we still don&apos;t know how to invest in ourselves. Now I wonder which corporate sponsor they can get who can provide a scholarship to do that?

 When was the last time you had a look down there? 

 What did it look like?  Where is down there? 

 Down There has numersous names, some of which you may or may not be familiar with.  If you&apos;ve seen the Vagina Monologues, you&apos;ll have an idea. If you still don&apos;t have a clue, then it&apos;s time you do. This time, it&apos;s from the perspective of the African American Woman. 

 Sharon McGee, News Anchor on Chicago&apos;s ONLY African American Radio Station has listened to her heart and followed through with a simply superb version of the Vagina Monolouges with The PocketBook Monolouges. 

 Saturday night at Malcolm X College was THE place to be. If you haven&apos;t seen it yet, might be too late. The PocketBook Monologues is off to a 10 city tour with Chicago&apos;s own Radio&amp;Televsion Divas LaDonna Tittle, (InTheMiddle ) Bonnie DeShong and Deborah Crable . There&apos;s even a youth version of the monologues included. (Can&apos;t tell you what who and what that is, it&apos;s a surprise!) 

 Coming from the South (Mississippi) I thought I&apos;d heard it all, that is until I attended the PocketBook Monolouges.  I never knew all the words associated with Down There, such as &quot;Lil Sister, Ms. Murphy, butterfly, candy, punani, velvet pouch, bun (for the hot dog), and a whole lot more. Sharon McGee says, &quot;Whatever you call it, you must protect it!&quot; 

 That&apos;s the true message of the PocketBook Monologues. She tells the story of how women are losing the battle to HIV/AIDS. African American Women are the Number 1 Growing face of this disease! It&apos;s an epidemic among us! We must do something! NOW! 

 The message comes across as soo funny, you almost forget about the tragedy. Without giving away the whole story, I&apos;ll simply say this, IF and WHEN it comes back to Chicago, make it your business to call all your womenfriend (Mothers, Aunts, Sisters, Neices, Grannies, Dads, Uncles, Nephews, Sons, etc.)  TAKE THE WHOLE FAMILY! 

 The world needs to see this. It needs to be in the Public School System ALL OVER THE COUNTRY! DON&apos;T MISS IT IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT.  You will get a chance to see BEHIND THE SCENES coming soon in November on ZTV! (Sundays Midgnight on Channel 19) 

 Parnts and Caregivers, take the time and talk to your girl and boy children about sex affects their lives and how it just might be the death of them. You&apos;ll be glad you did. If you don&apos;t know how, get them a copy of the book, The PocketBook Monologues. Invest in our youth today. The life you save could be your own! This is the essence of Higher Learning. How can you learn, if you&apos;re too ashamed to talk about it? 

                         ***************** 

 I don&apos;t totally agree that Black folks don&apos;t read, just a certain portion, but enough for someone to write something like this. 

 From my email someone wrote the following: 

 BLACK PEOPLE, PLEASE, PLEASE 

 RE AD&amp;HEED. POIGNANT. 

 The sad thing about this article is that the essence of it is true. The truth hurts. I just hope this sets more Black people in motion towards making real progress. Chris Rock, a Black comedian, even joked that Blacks don&apos;t read. Help prove them wrong! Read and pass on. For those of you who heard it, this is the article Dee Lee was reading this morning on a New York radio station. For those of you who didn&apos;t hear it, this is very deep. This is a heavy piece and a Caucasian wrote it. Dee Lee, CFP Harvard Financial Educators &quot;THEY ARE STILL OUR SLAVES We can continue to reap profits from the Blacks without the effort of physical slavery Look at the current methods of containment that they use on themselves: IGNORANCE, GREED, and SELFISHNESS.. 

 Their IGNORANCE is the primary weapon of containment. A great man once said, &quot;The best way to hide something from Black people is to put it in a book.&quot; We now live in the Information Age. They have gained the opportunity to read any book on any subject through the efforts of their fight for freedom, yet they refuse to read. There are numerous books readily available at Borders, Barnes&amp;Noble, and Amazon.com, not to mention their own Black Bookstores that provide solid blueprints to reach economic equality (which should have been their fight all along), but few read consistently, if at all. GREED is another powerful weapon of containment. Blacks, since the abolition of slavery, have had large amounts of money at their disposal. Last year they spent 10 billion dollars during Christmas, out of their 450 billion dollars in total yearly income (2.22%). Any of us can use them as our target market, for any business venture we care to dream up, no matter how outlandish, they will buy into it. 

 Being primarily a consumer people, they function totally by greed. They continually want more, with little thought for saving or investing. They would rather buy some new sneaker than invest in starting a business. Some even neglect their children to have the latest Tommy or FUBU, And they still think that having a Mercedes, and a big house gives them &quot;Status&quot; or that they have achieved their Dream. They are fools! The vast majority of their people are still in poverty because their greed holds them back from collectively making better communities. With the help of BET, and the rest of their black media that often broadcasts destructive images into their own homes, we will continue to see huge profits like those of Tommy and Nike. (Tommy Hilfiger has even jeered them, saying he doesn&apos;t want their money, and look at how the fools spend more with him than ever before!). 

 They&apos;ll continue to show off to each other while we build solid communities with the profits from our businesses that we market to them. SELFISHNESS, ingrained in their minds through slavery, is one of the major ways we can continue to contain them. One of their own, Dubois said that there was an innate division in their culture. A &quot;Talented Tenth&quot; he called it. He was correct in his deduction that there are segments of their culture that has achieved some &quot;form&quot; of success. However, that segment missed the fullness of his work. They didn&apos;t read that the &quot;Talented Tenth&quot; was then responsible to aid The Non-Talented Ninety Percent in achieving a better life. Instead, that segment has created another class, a Buppie class that looks down on their people or aids them in a condescending manner. 

 They will never achieve what we have. Their self ishness does not allow them to be able to work together on any project or endeavor of substance. When they do get together, their selfishness lets their egos get in the way of their goal Their so-called help organizations seem to only want to promote their name without making any real change in their community. They are content to sit in conferences and conventions in our hotels, and talk about what they will do, while they award plaques to the best speakers, not to the best doers. Is there no end to their selfishness? They steadfastly refuse to see that TOGETHER EACH ACHIEVES MORE (TEAM) They do not understand that they are no better than each other because of what they own, as a matter of fact, most of those Buppies are but one or two pay checks away from poverty. All of which is under the control of our pens in our offices and our rooms. Yes, we will continue to contain them as long as they refuse to re ad, continue to buy anything they want, and keep thinking they are &quot;helping&quot; their communities by paying dues to organizations which do little other than hold lavish conventions in our hotels. By the way, don&apos;t worry about any of them reading this letter, remember, &apos;THEY DON&apos;T READ!!!! 

 Now, in my own words. just to counteract this negaitve thought, those of us who do read know this not to be completely true. Since working in social services, I&apos;ve discovered that a growing number of adults in the African American community as well as the Eurpoean community do not read, many of whom who&apos;ve never learned how, for whatever reasons. 

 As readers our job is to assist those in need. Not make them feel ashamed, but to empower them by helping them learn to read. Local agencies are available to lend your time and talent. It may not mean much to you, but it can make a world of difference to someone who can&apos;t read.  

 You&apos;ve been blessed with the opportunity to be able to read, now find some time to share it with someone who can&apos;t.  Don&apos;t know where to go, Google it! You can also call your local library. Remember, readers are leaders!

 ON ANOTHER SAD NOTE: 

 
 If you have friends, daughters, granddaughters, nieces, cousins, neighbors, church, or social organizations who can benefit from this, please, please, please pass it on!* * Florida A&amp;M University http://www.famu.edu/index.cfm is providing an outstanding opportunity for Black women entering college in the fall of 2009. It is designed to address their absence in the field of computer technology. Dr. Jason Black is the Principal Investigator of a recently awarded $552,000 NSF Grant entitled African-American Women in Computer Science . The grant provides scholarships from $3,000 to $5,000 per semester for female African American students .*   *We need your help to get the word out about this GREAT opportunity to build up the enrollment of women in the CIS Department. Pass this information along to high school or community college students , their parents, and to guidance counselors you may know. The full text of the press release can be found at:*   http://www.famu.edu/?a=headlines&amp;p=display&amp;news=602 The program, entitled African-American Women in Computer Science, (AAWCS), is a four-year program that provides scholarships and other assistance to women who express a financial need and an interest in computer science or information technology. Women who apply to AAWCS will be accepted based on financial need, and will be awarded a scholarship of between $3,000 and $5,000 per semester. In addition to the funding, the women will participate in CIS departmental clubs and organizations, such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Club, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and the CIS Mentoring Organization (CISMO). AAWCS scholars will also be involved in other STEM programs, such as the Florida/Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) scholarship program, and the Students and Technology in Academia, Research and Service (STARS) Alliance, both NSF-funded programs. An added benefit to the students is the conference participation, where selected AAWCS scholars will be chosen to attend two national conferences, paid for by the grant, each year, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing  and the National Conference of Women in Information Technology (NCWIT). The program begins July 1 and will last until June 30, 2012. Applications for the program can be requested by contacting Mr. Black at jblack@cis.famu.edu or (850) 412-7354 . From personal experience w/FAMU I submit there is not a better place to send a young lady, and know that she is in the BEST hands while away from home, completely safe(no coed dorms), getting a superior education from caring professors, meeting others from throughout the country, and acquiring lifelong friends. My only child, a girl, went 1,000 miles from home to attend FAMU. She graduated Magna Cum Laude, w/an MBA, is a CPA doing quite well at a Fortune 500 company , was in the band, and she remains in touch w/FAMU and ex-band members. The FAMU Marching 100 Band will be in Obama&apos;s inaugraual parade. http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=famu+Marching+%E2%80%9C100%E2%80%9D&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=video_result_group&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=title# The band is world renown .   


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 

   
 
 
 Managing Medical and Mental Illness 
 
 

   

 
 
 
 
 Adrienne Fitts, 46, is a disabled navy veteran living in Chicago. She learned she had a mental illness in 1998. Her psychiatric drugs caused her weight to balloon up to 265 pounds and in 2001 she developed diabetes. She has hypertension and is now recovering from a stroke and a bout with encephalitis.  
 Gloria, a 56-year-old legislative advocacy worker, also deals with both a major mental and medical condition. Gloria, who asked to be identified by first name only, has long-term clinical depression , neurological problems and on top of that, partial kidney failure. 
 &quot;Multiple conditions are not rare and they become even more common as people get older,&quot; says Dennis Freeman, Ph.D., the CEO of Cherokee Health Systems in Tennessee . 
 &quot;Twenty-five percent of people in a primary care practice have a psychiatric illness,&quot; says Wayne Katon, M.D., vice chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of Washington School of Medicine . 
 Children are vulnerable, too. &quot;Kids with asthma are more likely to have every kind of anxiety and depressive disorder ,&quot; Katon says. &quot;This makes more of an impact on school performance and the ability to make and keep friends. Parents and schools have to be especially watchful for the additive effects of having two conditions.&quot; 
 For many people, physical conditions can contribute to problems with their mental health-problems that are often ignored and untreated. But your emotional health and physical health affect each other. Here&apos;s what you should know. 
 

   

   
 The stakes are high . 
 When recovering from a heart attack, it&apos;s natural to be focused on your physical recovery rather than your state of mind, but the two are intertwined, says Eric Goplerud, Ph.D. 
 &quot;A heart attack produces large amounts of cortisol that precipitates depression,&quot; explains Goplerud, the director of the Center for Integrated Behavioral Health Policy at George Washington University Medical Center . 
 &quot;At least twenty percent with heart attacks have severe depression-and these people are three times more likely to die if the depression is not dealt with promptly,&quot; he says. 
 &quot;People who have mental problems often have other health problems and they come together in legion,&quot; Goplerud says.  
 

   

   
 Drugs that help your mind can harm your body . 
 In a health care Catch-22, the same drugs that help people manage bipolar disorder , schizophrenia and depression can have serious physical side effects . 
 As part of her treatment, Fitts has received some heavy-duty drugs, including olanzapine. 
 &quot;Clozapine and olanzapine are the two antipsychotic drugs that the American Diabetes Association found the highest risk of causing weight gain and poor lipid control.&quot; Goplerud says. As for drugs to combat depression, &quot;some SSRIs are associated with weight gain and may contribute to diabetes . So you may be developing life-threatening illnesses from appropriate treatment of your mental illness.&quot; 
 The dilemma works both ways, Goplerud adds: &quot;Sometimes treatment we prescribe for in medical care end up causing mental health problems .&quot; For instance, &quot;People who have been legitimately prescribed powerful pain meds can become addicted.&quot; 
 If you are ever prescribed antidepressants, or given medication to help you sleep, doses often need to be fine-tuned and you might need to try several drugs before to find one that works for you. Although primary care practitioners or clinic doctors can prescribe these drugs, follow-up can fall through the cracks. Let someone know if your treatment isn&apos;t helping.  
 Patients have options, Goplerud says. &quot;Talk to your physician about other medicines that might be used.&quot; 
 

   

   
 Speaking up is vital to your mental health . 
 Stigma, no insurance, lifestyle behaviors, lack of psychiatric providers, poor access to psychologists, clinical social workers or counselors and shaky communication between doctors all contribute to extra complications for people dealing with more than one condition at a time. 
 Fear of the stigma of mental illness can keep patients from speaking up, says Chris Koyanagi, policy director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law . Some &quot;are reluctant to tell primary care doctors about their psychiatric medicines: &apos;I just don&apos;t want my regular doctor to know.&apos;&quot; 
 Recalls Gloria: &quot;As a teenager I had aches and pains and my parents took me to the Mayo clinic. They wanted me to see a psychiatrist. My father said fine, as long as they could come with me. The psychiatrist asked, &apos;Are you depressed?&apos; Dad answered, &apos;No, she&apos;s not.&apos;&quot; 
 Meanwhile, physical conditions arose that could not be brushed aside. It was only years later, when she had an emotional collapse on the job that Gloria began treatment for depression . 
 

   

   
 Your health care is usually scattered across different settings . 
 &quot;Health systems are fragmented, people are integrated,&quot; says Dennis Freeman, Ph.D., the CEO of Cherokee Health Systems in Tennessee. 
 People are often are forced to work with an array of health care providers . &quot;It&apos;s daunting to go to three different clinics; it&apos;s hard for anyone,&quot; Katon says. &quot;Fragmentation is even worse for people with mental health issues.&quot; 
   Dangerous drug interactions are possible when no single health professional has a handle on all the medications you take: you could receive heart pills from one doctor and an antidepressant from another doctor without either being aware of what the other prescribes. 
 &quot;At the least, one single person or entity needs to know all the medications you take and all the diagnoses you have,&quot; Koyanagi says. &quot;This can be your primary care physician , your mental health practitioner , your pharmacist.&quot; 
 

   

   
 Some mental health care is &quot;nested&quot; with medical care . 
 Katon, who brings his psychiatric expertise to a medical practice one day a week, says, &quot;It&apos;s ideal if psychiatric care can be merged into medical care,&quot; 
 &quot;We found that mental health care programs with primary care onsite-sometimes provided by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant-who can do regular and effective screens, can link people to community services [work best],&quot; Koyanagi agrees. 
 Federally qualified health centers, like Freeman&apos;s Cherokee Health System in Tennessee, provide a full range of services from professionals who communicate daily with one another and have access to a single, unified medical record for each patient. 
 Unfortunately, it can be hard to find mental health care at all, much less integrated medical-mental care. &quot;Half of counties in the United States don&apos;t have mental health providers ,&quot; Freeman says. 
 In those areas, &quot;You probably go to a primary care physician. They will do the very best they can. They&apos;re not psychotherapists or behaviorists, but psychiatrists are in short supply every place, even among insured,&quot; he says. &quot;So you go to see your primary care physician, talk to your minister, if you&apos;re in school it may be your teacher and guidance counselor.&quot; 
 

   

   
 We&apos;re all vulnerable at various times in our lives . 
 Just as we have ups and downs of physical health, everyone also deals with challenges that affect our moods and stability. It helps to know your baseline: What&apos;s your usual mental state? How do you know when things are out of control?  
  &quot;We all have times we&apos;re not as resilient and not managing as well,&quot; Freeman says. &quot;That&apos;s when the team needs to support you, help you through the rough times.&quot; 
 You might need additional support, not only from mental health professionals but also the people in your life. Sharing confidences and concerns with trusted friends and family or joining a support group can help restore your mental balance. 
 Fitts has found-and given-support through the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance , a peer group for people with mood disorders . Earlier, when she developed substance abuse issues - which often go along with mental illness and can complicate medical treatment -she looked outside herself for help. &quot;I just made some decisions. It&apos;s a process. I use a 12-step approach. I have a group in my church. It&apos;s helped me to get my thoughts together.&quot; 
 If you&apos;ve been diagnosed with a medical illness and you don&apos;t feel right emotionally: &quot;Talk to your physician, tell your nurse.&quot; Goplerud says. &quot;Misery is not necessary. You don&apos;t have to live with feeling physically miserable or mentally miserable.&quot;

A message from the President Of the United States!






 Mrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back.. She said, &apos;Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference. I didn&apos;t know how to teach until I met you.&apos; For you that don&apos;t know, Teddy Stoddard is the Dr. at Iowa Methodist in Des Moines that has the Stoddard Cancer Wing.) 
 
Warm someone&apos;s heart today. . . share this link with someone!
 

 After the children left, she cried for at least an hour. On that very 
 day, she quit teaching reading, writing and arithmetic. Instead, she began to teach children. Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and, despite her lie that she would love all the children the same, Teddy became one 
 of her &apos;teacher&apos;s pets.. 

 From an N&apos;Spirational Conversations Reader: A MUST READ!
   







 FYI!   





 
 
 THE SNEEZE   
 


 

 A reader shared this one, you gotta love it!
 

 This is what I call Higher Learning at its best!
 

 Totally Awesome!!! 
 
 
 They walked in tandem, each of the ninety-two students filing into the already crowded auditorium. With their rich maroon gowns flowing and the traditional caps, they looked almost as grown up as they felt.  
 
 Dads swallowed hard behind broad smiles, and Moms freely brushed away tears.  
 
 This class would NOT pray during the commencements, not by choice, but because of a recent court ruling prohibiting it. 
 The principal and several students were careful to stay within the guidelines allowed by the ruling. They gave inspirational and challenging speeches, but no one mentioned divine guidance and no one asked for blessings on the graduates or their families.  
 
 
 The speeches were nice, but they were routine until the final speech received a standing ovation.
 
 A solitary student walked proudly to the microphone. He stood still and silent for just a moment, and then, it happened. 
 
 All 92 students, every single one of them, suddenly SNEEZED !!!! 

The student on stage simply looked at the audience and said,
 
 &apos;GOD BLESS YOU&apos; 
 
 And he walked off the stage... 
 
 Know Thyself
