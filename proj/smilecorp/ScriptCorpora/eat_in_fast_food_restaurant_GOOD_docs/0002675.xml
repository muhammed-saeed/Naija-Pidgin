Must See: UK Year End Album Chart
 
 

It’s finally here!

Moments ago, the UK’s Official Charts Company released their list of 2011′s  highest selling albums released in the country so far.

Check it out below…

11 PROGRESS–TAKE THAT
12 NO MORE IDOLS–CHASE&amp;STATUS

37 BRING HIM HOME–ALFIE BOE
38 NOTHING BUT THE BEAT–DAVID GUETTA
39 OLLY MURS–OLLY MURS
40 JUKEBOX–JLS 

In what really goes without saying, well done to Adele for the success she enjoyed this year with ’21 ‘and‘ 19 ‘alike.

However, what really surprised us was how Rihanna ‘s‘ Talk That Talk ‘fared on the chart.

For, coming in at #17 after one month is nothing short an impressive feat and serves to prove that when it comes to purchasing her albums, the US‘Navy’will always fall short of matching their British counterparts.

However, while the likes of‘ Loud ‘, ’4′ and‘ Teenage Dream’ have all ranked impressively, a round of applause has most definitely got to be given to Jessie J ‘s debut LP‘ Who You Are ‘and Bruno Mars ‘‘ Hooligans’ for the units they’ve raked in this year.

 

Be sure to look out for an updated version of this chart in January, which will include sales generated during the festive season.

 Well done to all!

Of ALL of Rihanna’s contemporaries, how many have toured the U.K./Europe as Rihanna had??

And just who is Rihanna’s“contemporary”..?? Well, the one, and only, which comes to mind is Nicki Minaj!

(sigh.. again..) When Nicki Minaj begins to tour Europe/U.K., she’ll force Rihanna out of everyone’s consciousness, just as she has done, here in the U.S.! Rihanna now“lives”on borrowed time. The gimmickry had lasted long enough!

My girl got 2 albums on the chart and one of them came out in 2010. Lmao at how y’all put bleacher Beyonce pic up there like she’s slaying something.

I thought TTT was a flop. It came out three weeks ago and is slaying.

Question of the day: where is here I flopped?

I know Sam is crying given that 4 is not even in the top ten and bey performed at glastonbury and Kelly is nowhere to be found. I guess we know whose album is really collecting dust on the shelves.

I’m absolutely not a RIhanna stan, but this is so BIASED, double standard. 4 as impressive UK sales?? It was a flop. It was sold in 7 months almost as much as Talk That Talk in 3-4 weeks.

That list only counted TTT first 3 weeks.
But it was judt announced that TTT has sold another 100K+ this week and is now chillin at 465K+

So it has already outsold 4closure after only 1 mouth.

Loud was just certified 6 time platinum this week.
It sold 800K this year and about 800k last year as well.

It s a shame that Loud has sold 80K these past 2 weeks(40K each), but those number ain t even included in mediatraffic cus there is an over holiday rush a big release which keeps Loud outside the top 40.

Mediatraffic should think about going top50 or top60

Squeeze me! Look at this chart. LOUD outselling BTW despite the fact that Lady Gaga has been every-fucking-where with her massive promotional campaign. And this doesn’t even count the weeks when LOUD was newly released.

You’ve got nothing on the Navy. And I quote something I just read:“Only three years in the game, and she needs “fandom infusion” already.”
In comparison, Rihanna releases a song–she performs it ONCE and flies out of the country–and stays at number one for seven weeks.

U better keep it cute.

Loud sold more copies than BTW…and that’s without the 99cent nonsense.
On top of it it also sold more singles than BTW,

And TTT is set to sell 2Million by year end and that’s without 99cent nonsense and with barely any promo while Caca has been trolling ever single TV&amp;radio show that would have her on this earth…and she still ain t got any huge hits to show for it. The btw single started with a BANG but fizzled out the chart as fast as the album which 8 month later has barely double what it did in its 1st week,,, HOW PATHETIC.

How about u join the other monster on their facebook campaign to save Caca’s career from the total irrelevance path it is on.

Looks like she won t even make it to 5 years of relevancy in the game.

I expect another mental breakdown from her as depicted stupid Marry The Night video.

Def Jam already chose Riri over her.
And now, the whole world is doing the same.

Some of you are acting like straight up crack babies. For crying out loud, you all are fighting tooth and nail over accomplishments that aren’t even yours. These artist probably see these stan wars, and laugh their asses off. I wouldn’t be surprised if Bey, Gaga, and Adele are sitting down at a table sipping champagne while reading this fuckery.

You don’t have to be 2x platinum in the US to sell 6 million worldwide. Makes no sense. And I believe Rihanna has sold 6 million worldwide or very close to it.

Bruno sold 3 milli this year,he is above the goat in the U.S.,Australia,U.K. and germany and barely the same in France.The biggest markets in the world but he only sold 3 milli.

I dont need to show you real receipts cause l am not the one inflatuing Bruno’s numbers.you prove me rih actually sold more than the estimations cause the list on this post in one of the receipt l am using 

Rihanna look like a poor man beyonce,with all those tatoo like Gucci man.Big ass gorilla nostrils yet Totally untalented.At least Kat is untalented not just a model with a mic Poor mess,in what disease she is going to blame her next bad performances :Bronchitis,herpes,pneumonia…?????

smh this rhitard@lieteller needs a reality check, comparing sales of loud to sales of 4 to determine who’s local and who’s international just shows how naive, ignorant and immensely stupid u are

1) the albums are so different, they dont even belong to the same genre. u think rihanna would have sold more if she had released 4 or an album similar? hyperthetically speaking of course, we know how weak range could never pull off those vocals

2)i love it how u always ignore the fact that Bey’s album sales off 3 albums is more than rihaha ahs sold with 5 albums

3) rih is only doin extremely well in uk, nowhere else. if she was so international, her ww sales 1st week would be over 511k. Bey dint have a hit single and she’s sold more than her

4) rih is like on her 4th tour now, yet not 1 of them has smashed ww, LGOE was a huge flop tour and loud is the same: freebie tickets, cancelled shows et al. doing half her shows in eu. Bey sold out shows in Asia, somewhere is not even considering cus they wont pay to watch a dreadful excuse for a performer

5) rih has no major star power of her own. it took 3 albums/ 3 image makeovers to get her career off the ground. its so obvious why people pay attention to her. even with hit singles her 1st week sales are poor cus she cant sell on her name alone.

6)wasnt one of her early tv debuts a DC tribute at the World Music Awards? mmmkay

7)wouldnt an international artist at least be on top half of forbes power list or times most influential list? Bey is top 10 on both

 why is your ww bitch still making baby money (compared to Bey) after a year of sweating her ass off? lmao

9)that awkward moment when Bey is chosen to headline Glastonbury even b4 her new era started. rih was in d middle of one #ouch

10)when rih won int’l female artist of the year at NRJ (France) 2010, Bey was honoured with Artist of the DECADE. UK voted Bey sexiest female (2011), world’s greatest dancer (2011), world’s greatest popstar (2009). where was rih? trailing behind like the trendfollower she is!

Because ri on her own is weak and her numbers look just like that….numbers. they need to introduce the greatness of Beyonce to afford it some weight. for God’s sakes the woman has 6 albums, only 2 have sold past 3m ww does that sound like a superstar to u?

in biggest music market, she has 11 no1 singles, no no1 album and has sold less than 6mil copies off SIX albums. no wonder she turned to euro djs

rih has the most transparent strategy in showbiz plus a smart team. they have to pigeonhole her in a box of they are to milk any sales from her brainwashed coons. you know…. the eyecatching wig, jaw-dropping controversy, rih is just a product face, anyone crass/ bland enough could have been cast in her place

All I gotta do is point out that Rihanna:

* For the 6th consecutive time failed to score a #1 album.
* Sold a paltry 197k of her latest album in the 1st week.
* Debuted at #3, then slipped to #7, then slipped out of the top 10.
* Has sold only a little over 300k in the US (which is the most important music market in the world.)

The End.

I don’t care about nothing else. As far as I’m concerned, there is no dressing this shit up. Talk That Talk is a f-l-o-p.

Well, I see the Rihanna haters are so angry they are willing to pretend like LOUD did not sell 6 million. That’s really sad to me. To hate someone to the point you have to pretend that they didn’t accomplish something. I stan for the KIng but I like Rihanna. She’s not that good of a singer and she often performers like a lazy tramp ; ) but I really do like her as a person. You know she appears to be fun to be around! Plus she makes the catchiest music known to man. The Kat Deluna fan talking about sales is a joke. @Bey,Knight your mean LOL.

@Lax NOW U BrINGING UP britney it was Beyonce Vs Rihanna WTF Pressed

Beyonce has a couple of diamond

Iam Sasha fierce 2x Diamond in Brazil HAVE a SEAT

144.3rd female artist ever with the most RIAA certifications of Gold, Platinum and Multi-Platinum singles ever with a total of 32 certifications (after Madonna and Mariah,both with 35). So Beyoncé needs only one hit to be the most awarded female artist in U.S. ever

She has more Platinum etc then britney

BUT LETS STAY BEYONCE VS RIHANNA

Yeah 3 singles out only since mid january.He worked hard this year doe He deserves the success he had this year.He is extremelty talented.

What annoys me the most is Rih stans are always acting like she is the bigger than what she is.Bruno slayed her in the U.K. with less promo (he didnt attend the Brit wards 2011,festivals for example)

Bruno was snubbed at awards shows for Bieber this year tho a mess

Rihanna is not that famous, her cheesy songs are just popular but the name on its own&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

even the rolling stone comparison article said rihaha is still trying to establish herself. something Gaga did in a quarter of time on the scene. Gaga is regarded as an est. global star, cant blame em, the chick is selling out shows the world over. ronald mcdonald can only do that in uk eand even so the soundtrack of the night is the audience&apos;s boos. ah well maybe reviews will be fairer to riri oh wait i read em………i rest my case!

Stop being dumb.
Loud sold 3* more than BTW in the UK. (500K+ vs 1.6Million+)
Those are 2011 numbers.
Loud sold another 800k in 2010.

The simple fact that it sold more in 2011 than BTW despite having been released in 2010 says EVERYTHING U NEED TO KNOW.

And TTT will have outsold BTW by next weekend as well. (5weeks)

@ haters, the simple fact that you spend more time thinking bout rihanna than beyonce says alot. it simply shows how pressed and indenial you really are.
rihanna has achieved unmatchable success over these pass 6 years, that beyonce can only dream of. here in the southern hemisphere we can’t get enough of rihanna whatever she does style wise all of the girls follow her and her music is relatable to all even some hetero males. you say rihanna isn’t on bey’s level that is a definite fact because she was when she released gggb but now she’s in a league of her own 0800 DIAL A HIT. beyonce’s fading fast and can be replaced, she has a typical voice that can be matched by any black female singer whereas if you here a rihanna song you immediately know it’s her. and not anyone can replace rihanna, if anyone else got her music it wouldn’t have been as big or even recognised as being a hit!!!! besides TTT is #1 here in NZ she dominates the charts here and everywhere. and for ignorant americans without the rest of the world you’ll all be nothing, the wo’rlds a bigger market, people won’t even go see a movie unless theres someone in it that has a different nationality than american, so you just have to DEAL!!!!!!!!

On to more important artists, Adele is a muthafukn beast, you can put ur cock in Beys mouth and she’d suck u baby girl…

Rihanna did phenomenal this year, 4 weeks on sale + even after it leaked, she still slayed ur faves&lt;3…

Hating aside Rihanna really did well in the UK this year, she has 2 albums in the top 20 with 1 in the top 5. And Talk the Talk could be her biggest selling album there soon cause it hasn’t even been out a month and look at what it’s doing??

Nice for her. Congrats RIRI

Now on to serious matters, Don’t use Beyonce’s shortcomings to justify why your favourite artist is the best. If she is the best then it shouldn’t matter who else is on there
LIke really, Beyonce released an R&amp;B album and u wanna compare it’s sales to a pop album that was literally geared for the European market?? Adele is killing Rihanna’s album sales anyways so she isn’t even the best so I don’t know what we’re arguing about cause she might be outselling Beyonce but she isn’t even the number 1 artist in the world

I’m so tired of arguing about this cause it’s pointless, I know the truth and you all know the truth but youd’rather play the fool than see the facts for what they are.

4 went number 1 in the majority of the world, it didn’t do spectacularly well but it didn’t flop either so stop it with that nonsense.

I’m so sick of this Beyonce vs. Rihanna war. Now even though i think bey is a lot better, Rihanna is obviously at her prime now and doing what she can to be a great artist/entertainer, They are so different, but they are both beautiful and talented, even if rihanna is doing better than her (sales wise) it doesn’t discard all the hard work bey has done throughout her whole career. Bottom Line just because you like rihanna doesn’t mean you have to hate beyonce, and just because you like Bey doesn’t mean you have to hate rihanna, they’re both good….Anywayz Congrats to Adele!

Adele ruled, Michel Buble ruled with a few months in. I can’t believe Rihanna and Bruno outsold Gaga, well those albums have been out longer and have spawned more successful singles on that side of the pond.

First–Well done RiRi, Loud (from 2010) which went no.1 in 2010–4th best seller and TTT which has had since 21st November is the 17th!

Next–well done Gaga, but you can’t beat Rih

Next–well done to Jessie J or a debut album at 6

Well done to Bey (15), Katy Perry (19) and P!nk (34)

Such a shame that other good albums, Nicki Minaj, Cher Lloyd, Avril Lavigne, Cascada didn’t sell so well, and one trick ponies like 1D, JLS and Adele–who can only take off their tops to impress teenage girls (1d&amp;JLS) and only sing ballads that put you to sleep with a tempo below 80 (Adele) get into the chart, seriously try listening to Someone Like You 25 times in a row–impossible! If you try it with Only Girl in the world, We Found Love, What the Hell or Superbass (Rih, Rih, Avril, Nicki) you’re up dancing

@Eric–this is only albums, If you compare singles you will find that Rihanna has been named the highest selling singles artist of 2011
