 I predict that the world will end next Monday at 2pm Greenwich mean time.
I also predict that my 1st prediction will not come true and that this one will.

 It is unpredictable. Human beings is one of the primary causes of this damnation. We are ashamed! Why have we put an advantage to our chances of life? We have risked nature with its own hands. This should be called&quot;Global suicide&quot;. Humans are intelligent not destroy life but to preserve what is left in the world. 50% Humans, 50% Natural calamities for these causes. It is time to change the world and preserve in order to prevent the end. Those who say&quot;This is the end of the world&quot;are to be helpless and pessimistically inhumane and negative.

1953 - The United States and the Soviet Union test thermonuclear devices within nine months of one another. Clock changed to two minutes to midnight (one minute closer, its closest approach to midnight to date).

1953 would have been an end of the world. If it happens again but 10x worse than this. Let us blame ourselves.
