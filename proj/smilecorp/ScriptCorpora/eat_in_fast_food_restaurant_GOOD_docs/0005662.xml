 IF YOU HAVE KIDS....... 
 .... AND ARE COMING TO TAIWAN 

 Welcome to the brave new world of SARS. Fortunately it has
abated in
Taiwan....for
now. Forward 
 Due to popular demand, I have prepared a page on bearing and
raising
children in Taiwan aimed at parents coming to Taiwan with their kids,
and
assuming that both parents are non-Taiwanese. I have two kids of my
own,
but my wife is Taiwanese, so our situation is slightly different. 
 This page on kids in Taiwan is dedicated to my son and
daughter. 

 
 

 WARNING : It&apos;s
back: enterovirus ,
a child killer, is now endemic in Taiwan. Chances are extremely
slim
your child will get it, but in 1998 several score children were killed
by it. It recurs every yearn or two now, thanks to poor hygiene,
killing five or six children. Just something else to think
about.....wash
those hands well! 
 And don&apos;t forget: handwashing also helps
prevent SARS. And
Bird Flu....too bad it&apos;s no good against Mad Cow....

 Taiwan is full of
fascinating bugs your kids will love. 
 

 Introduction 
Taiwan is not a good environment for children, for a wide
variety
of reasons. Indeed, it is common for Taiwanese to observe that growing
up here is hard, and that America is a paradise for children.
 Baking,
a fun activity for kids in any country. 

 First, there is a lack of open space, especially
in the
cities. Developers have been given free rein and consequently have
created
tyrannical, oppressive, crowded, lightless and airless living
environments.  The front of a local
elementary school. 

 There is a shortage of accessible park space,
although
many small local parks are quite nice and well-equipped with playground
equipment, sand pits and pleasing landscaping (the crowding of trees
and
equipment in parks is a deliberate authoritarian design practice--
parks
with no open space cannot be used as assembly points for protests and
other
political activities. Contrast the claustrophobic, over-landscaped
parks
of KMT-run Taipei with the open parks of DPP-run I-Lan). My
son puzzles over a cage of songbirds at the fortuneteller&apos;s booth in a
night market. 

 Park equipment is often not very safe, however. A
few places,
such as I-lan on the East Coast about three hours from Taipei, have
excellent,
roomy parks with plenty of open space. Farther south, outside the big
cities,
there may be no parks at all. In Taliao (outside Kaohsiung) where
we used to live, there are no serious parks, while the adjacent
township has
only
one.  Exploring Reptile World in Tainan County. Taiwan offers many
possibilities
for small side trips to interesting, fun places for kids. In recent years the
government has been investing heavily in leisure and tourism, resulting
in an explosion of new places to take kids.

 Taiwan&apos;s cities are dirty, but given their
amazing population
densities and lack of civic/community sense, they are about as clean as
they can be. Hiking
with friends on the ridges near Keelung. 

 The cities are also difficult to get around in if
you have
small kids. Generally, bus drivers pay no attention to the needs of
parents
with
small children when stopping or starting their vehicles. Sidewalks are
crowded, uneven and difficult to push strollers around on. People do
not
help women with strollers here.
 My kids play with fire. We
are fortunate in having a large backyard. 

 Outside of the
north, the city bus systems are
extremely
undeveloped, so your family will need transportation. On a class trip to the Taipei Zoo in April of 2004. There are few diaper changing
stations
anywhere, but some of the major store chains now have them. Change is
slowly rolling over Taiwan.
 
 My daughter models a
tiny frog she caught near our house. 
 

 Playing
games at the night market with my son.  

 Taiwanese children routinely pee outdoors in
public areas
and nobody thinks anything of it. This ethic can be a godsend if no
bathrooms
are available. A kiddie pool in an apartment complex in Taichung. Many
newer complexes
have such play facilities. 

 The weather can be a pain. It often rains from
January
to March in the north, making outdoor trips impossible. I have been
here
through winters in which it has rained every day for sixty days on end.
Kids go insane under those conditions. In the summer the sun can be
nasty
and burns can occur quickly -- slather those kids with sunscreen and
make
them wear hats. The weather is much hotter in the south and it
rains
much less, but the pollution is appalling. The kids at soccer
practice at Morrison Christian Academy in Taichung. 

 A major issue here for children is security.
People advise you to watch your
kids like a hawk. Kidnapping and child snatching are commonly held to
be a serious problem in
Taiwan,
though they do not happen often to Westerners. Many of the tales you
hear have an urban legendish feel to them.
 A local park in northern Taichung. This one is fairly
representative. 

 Another major problem for westerners are
Taiwanese child-rearing
values. The emphasis in this culture is on authority and control.
Social
values here are very undemocratic (indeed, whether democracy is
compatible
with Asian culture is a frequent topic of debate in academic newsgroups
and email lists on Asia).  At the ice skating rink in
Taichung. 

 Additionally, there is a strong violent streak in
interpersonal
relations which kids pick up from a young age. Hitting, kicking,
punching
and bullying are commonplace in the schools. The
kids study a toad they have caught in the woods near our house. 

 Enjoying
a slice of chocolate mousse cake with a good friend at a local
restaurant. 

 Taiwanese parents also do not give their children
the rich
stimulation that middle-class parents overseas do, particularly with
respect
to outdoor activities. Taiwanese kids, especially outside of Taipei, do
not read books, or play board games, nor are they given &apos;dirty&apos; things
to play with like markers and paper, clay, flour, sandboxes and so
forth
(because of the lack of things to do, mothers constantly complain that
their children are uncontrollable. In reality, they are just
bored.)  Playing on the beach at
Kenting. 

 As with everything else in Taiwan, NETWORK,
NETWORK, NETWORK.
I can&apos;t emphasize enough how important forming connections is. In
Taiwan
connections are the way things get done. Personal networks may allow
you
to purchase things cheaply, to hear about good doctors, to find things
to do and so forth. My daughter and her class at the local
elementary school. 

 As for US taxes, kids overseas are NOT eligible
for the
income tax credit for low-income parents if they have been resident
overseas
for more than half the year. Most everything else is the same,
however. If your income is excluded on Form 2555 (overseas income), you are not
eligible for the child tax credit either. For both Taiwan and US
taxes, coming in January is the best time. My
kids rewrite history and sink Bismarck with Soviet carriers and
American battleships. Most childhood hobby stuff, from models to
gas-powered
aircraft, is available in Taiwan. 

 Finally,
remember, you will be 12,000 miles
from family
and friends . You have no support network here and it will take a
long
time to develop one. There may be no one to take care of the kids when
you want to see a movie or go dancing or drinking or shopping or just
plain
get away from the demands of toddlers. No one will be able to comfort
you
when you are down or reassure you that you are a good parent when you
are
feeling stressed and incapable. There may be no one to borrow money
from
when you need to, no one to take care of one kid when you need to take
the other to the doctor, no nice neighbors to park the kids with for an
hour while you run errands. 


 My daughter makes
home-made ice cream at Flying Cow Farm in Miaoli. Your stress level as a parent
is going to go way, way up
parenting in
Taiwan.

Everything your kids will need is available somewhere in Taiwan,
probably
even in your neighborhood. The trick is finding it. 

 Monkeying
around in a local park. What to Bring 
Go to your local Rite-Aid or Peoples&apos; and get two bottles of kids
chewable
vitamins. Get some vitamins for yourself as well. They are expensive
here.
Additionally, I recommend several bottles of children&apos;s tylenol
(available
here in small bottles) and children&apos;s sudafed, robutussin, etc.  

 Stopping at a highway rest stop for juice, milk, and
overpriced food. The wider the selection of cold and cough stuff
you bring,
the better off you are. Your kids will suffer frequently from colds,
especially
in the winter, and especially in the south. SARS caused demand for
thermometers
to skyrocket, so bring an electronic thermometer. A couple of fat tubes
of antibiotic ointment will also come in handy.  

 My kids ride the train at Leofoo
Village, an amusement park near
Kuanhsi. If you use cloth diapers, bring a generous supply
as the
local versions are of very low quality. A child&apos;s first-aid kit will be
useful too. This New Zealand
expat sells quality cloth diapers in Taiwan online. 
 

 A park in Taipei. Note the winter clothing. It&apos;s colder than
you think
in Taipei. Taiwan is very developed and most things are
widely available.
Diapers are easily found. Baby and toddler stuff may be purchased
almost
anywhere, even in local drugstores, and Toys&apos;R&apos;Us carries a large
selection
of brand-name Western infant and toddler goods. Bandaids and minor
medical
stuff are as available as in the US. 

 At
play at Morrison Christian School in Taichung. Vaccinations: a couple of diseases are more
prevalent in
Taiwan. Vaccination against Japanese Menangitis ( er4 ben3 nau3 yen2 )
should be considered mandatory and may be obtained inexpensively in
Taiwan.
Check with a pediatrician when you get in.

 My son
takes my niece for a ride in a toy car at the local night market. 

 A
killer whale claims two victims during an outing to the Aquarium in
Kenting. Finding a Doctor 
Finding a good pediatrician is hard anywhere. Use your connections
vigorously. If you don&apos;t speak Chinese finding a pediatrician in your
neighborhood
may be difficult, since most English-speaking doctors congregate in the
foreign ghetto of Tienmu in Taipei or in the swank Minsheng District.
But
many doctors speak enough English, especially technical English, to be
able to communicate with you. A clear sign that a pediatrician is good
is crowding during office hours. A pediatrician who also sees a lot of
adults is probably a very good doctor as well.


 
 Zeb grins in the local market. 
 The hospitals all have
pediatric clinics, but the doctors are
very much
hit-or-miss. Large teaching hospitals will probably offer the best
service. We&apos;ve had completely positive experiences at the China Medical
College in Taichung.
 

 My wife waits to go in to see the doctor in a hospital
waiting
area.  With doctors you
may have to insist on a
seven-day supply
of antibiotics -- they may only want to give out a three-day supply (be
prepared to pay). Or, when the problem turns out to be a virus, they
may
simply discontinue antibiotics before they have run their course.



 
 
 A new generation learns
an old favorite. 
 You will also have to insist
that they explain each medication
to you,
since doctors will not do so of their own intiative. It&apos;s not
what&apos;s done in the local culture, and they
haven&apos;t the time. 

 Zeb
and Dan-dan teach their cousins English at a family gathering for the
60th
birthday of Second Aunt. Do not purchase any over-the-counter antibiotics.
Everyone
uses them, and the bugs are all resistant now. 

 A
vendor sells donuts on a Taichung street. A major health lack is the absence of mechanisms
for children
with special needs, though in the last few years more and more
specialists
are appearing. Many local expats now report that they can find what
they need. Ordinary day care, frequently run by
non-professionals,
regards such children as &quot;stupid&quot; and will not defend them from abuse
by
other kids. As an English teacher I see many, many children who should
be in early intervention programs of one sort or another, but are
simply
regarded as &quot;stupid&quot; and shunted aside in a cookie-cutter system which
neither cares about them nor provides for them. If you have
children
with truly serious problems, I would rethink coming to Taiwan.

 Sebastian
and Sheridan grab tofu for hot pot in a morning market in January of
2004.
That winter was bitterly cold by local standards. 
 
 I used to have a section on childbirth at this point. I
eliminated
it, but retained this letter from a friend: 
 My name&apos;s Catherine, I&apos;m Josh Lawrence&apos;s wife, of Taiwan-Teachers fame. I was just reading through your website, Kids section, and
thought you&apos;d like to know that Josh and I, along with another
Taiwanese/American
couple, found a great doctor in Kaohsiung willing to do
homebirths. His name is Dr. Maw-Sheng Chang (not totally sure of first name), and
works
out Chang&apos;s women&apos;s hospital. He works with a fabulous midwife-
both
are very low-key people, Josh and I barely noticed them at the birth of
our child 2.5 years ago. We had a homebirth, and it went really
really
well. Our friends have had two children using this &apos;dynamic
duo&apos;. It was surprisingly supportive, despite initial disagreements between
myself
and Dr. Chang, he ultimately let me decide and, more importantly, let
me
control the situation. He charges around $30,000 nt for a
homebirth,
plus the usual fees for each monthly visit to his hospital. He
has
worked a lot with the Dutch expat community in Kaohsiung, through whom
I found him. Your kids section is great, so sadly true..... 
 
 The
dog makes a
splash. 

 Care and Feeding 
Unless you can afford to buy imported baby food at
astronomical prices,
you will have to make your own. Blenders and other equipment are widely
available at good prices and vegetables hit the markets fresh every
day.
Read the page
on
food located at my site for more information. Formula is comparable in price
to the US and widely available. Ingredients will be listed in English
in
most cases. Locally-made formulas are high in sugar, we have found.
 Zeb struggles to master the intricacies of Hanon. Lessons
for piano,
violin
and most other musical instruments are available even in the smallest
of
neighborhoods. Pianos are only marginally cheaper than in the US. We
bought
ours dirt cheap from a rebuilder who put together a Japanese keyboard
of
real ivory, a Korean case, and a German soundboard. 

 Diapers and wipes are affordable and widely
available.
Local cloth diapers are hideously bad. We gave up on cloth because the
local climate is so wet that diaper rash is more frequent (and painful)
and because they often take days to dry in the rainy winter weather in
the north. A
school bus van waits to pull out. Vans like this are the most common
forms
of transportation for kindergartens and cram schools.  

 Kids clothing is cheap in local night markets and
widely
available. The quality is often quite excellent, since much of what
gets
sold in night markets is dumped there by OEM manufacturers who
overproduced,
or made errors, etc.  My daughter reading in front of the university library.
University
libraries
make great outings for kids. 

 If you like making your own clothing, cloth can
be had
cheaply down on Tihua St. in Taipei, where the spice and textile
merchants
make their home (well worth a site-seeing trip). There is a textile
wholesale
and retail market there. Retail cloth stores can be found everywhere.
Sewing
machines are widely available (but a little expensive) and many
department
stores offer free sewing lessons. Children
taking rollerblading lessons at a local school. 

 Children&apos;s utensils, cups, etc may be purchased
at most
toy stores, Toys&apos;R&apos;Us, drug stores and so forth. Most places sell brand
name baby soaps, powders and shampoos. Baby furniture, including cribs,
beds and mattresses, is also widely available, especially at Toys&apos;R&apos;Us. The grounds of Donghai University in Taichung. Schools
provide open
spaces
in Taiwan&apos;s densely populated cities. 

 Toys will be a problem. Toys&apos;R&apos;Us is heavily
commercialized,
sells only tie-in toys, expensive brand names, and little in the way of
affordable
educational stuff. We seldom shop there; there is hardly a less useful
toy place in Taiwan. Local toys are laughable in
both
conception and production quality, and tend strongly to violent themes.
Bring what you need, and search diligently for the occasional treasure
that pops up.  Nightmarkets have everything you need. 

 Convenience stores are everywhere and there is
always one
when you need it. You can depend on them for 100% juices, snacks and
other
necessities. Their ubiquity means you don&apos;t have to travel with as much
stuff, since you can always stop to buy juice, snacks and so forth.
McDonald&apos;s
can be found even in the smaller cities, though very small towns will
not
have one. The
interior of a 7-11 in Kenting National Park. Sushi, tea eggs, fruit
juice,
cookies, hot dogs -- a mish-mash of the quick foods of East and West. 

 For some idea of costs, see the section on living
Expenses
on my money page. We have two kids and spend about $25-30,000 a month
not
counting rent. In order to save US$1,000 a month, you will probably
need
more than $70,000 a month in income as parents. Such a figure is well
within
reach, but it will take time to get up there. You will also need to pay
for a visa run for your wife and kids, a minimum of 18,000 or so for
three
tickets to Hong Kong (see below) every six months, unless they can stay
on your permit (check what the law is when you get in). Riding the electric scooter. Children&apos;s helmets and other
safety
equipment
are available everywhere. 

 However, if you have to educate your kids at a
private
school here, you will need to spend around NT$30K monthly. That
takes
a huge bite out of your paycheck! Consider: with rent at 10K,
living
expenses at 20K and school at 30K, you would need 60K just to live on
the
brink here in Taiwan with one kid. If your spouse also works,
it&apos;s
not a problem. A
selection of grilled stuff, great for kids.

 A

If you are American on both sides, your kids will perfectly
legal with
the usual visa/work permit. They will be eligible for health
insurance
and can attend local schools. Children of one-foreign, one-local
families
can chose their status as they need.
 

 Heavy
with fruit, lychee trees overhang a country road. Many country lanes
offer
pleasant walks. Adoption is not easy here. Nevertheless, we know
people who have successfully adopted. With China throwing up
impediments to adoption, American attention has shifted to Taiwan.
 

 My
son does homework. We homeschooled him for about six months prior to
sending
him to Morrison. We were pleasantly surprised to find that we had
prepared
him much better than the school does. The success of our homeschooling
program left us somewhat ambivalent about sending him to a $10K
annually
private school. The system here grinds slowly, but it does grind,
and you will be able to adopt once you have jumped through all the
hoops.
 
 Enjoying the equipment
in Tungshih Forest Park. 
 Taiwan&apos;s adoption system is
geared toward Americans, and non-Americans may be told that they must
go through an American adoption agency. Another obstacle people have
encountered is the expansion of hate-filled, controlling evangelical
Christianity, whose
orphanages only adopt to certain kinds of Christians .
 
 My kids learn GPS from an
enthusiast. For private adoptions, which
roll along much faster than public ones,
you will need to network with doctors. They will know where the babies
are, since they are treating their mothers.

 Sheridan
looks for new construction technology. Things to Do 
The old standby, the fast food restaurant, is a good place to take
the kids on a rainy day. Most of them have miniature play areas which
are
relatively safe and clean. You can sit in the air conditioning, your
kids
can play and be safe. The drawback is, of course, they eat fast food.
There
are some Discovery Zone-type places in the cities, and Toys&apos;R&apos;Us and
major
department stores will have play areas for little kids. 

 Blowing bubbles on the
grassy stretches on Chunghsinghsintsun, the
planned
town erected for the provincial government in central Taiwan. The Taipei Zoo is wonderful. Clean,
inexpensive and
conveniently located at the end of the metro line. A very good outing
every
couple of months. The Kaohsiung Zoo is even better -- tough on
the
animals, but very small and completely shaded. Perfect for kids. 

 In
the petting Zoo at Leofoo Village. In addition to hosting a theme park
with rides, Leofoooffers a small but well-equipped zoo. Most other animal
attractions succumbed
to the declining economy at the end of the 1990s, but Leofoo
Village has small zoo with a good collection of large mammals. 

 Meandering
through the massive fish tanks at the Kenting Aquarium. Although land animals are scarce, there are
world-class
aquariums in Taipei, Kenting, and Penghu.  

 Even
the smallest local bakery offers an enticing array of baked goods for
kids. Many local parks in Taipei are quite nice, with
generous
sand pits and challenging playground equipment. The northern suburbs
generally
have better parks than the southern suburbs, but good parks may be
found
everywhere. Many children like the park in Taipei west of the domestic
airport, since the approach to the airport brings the aircraft right
over
the park at low altitude.

 Enjoying
milk and donuts on a downtown outing.  There are campgrounds and several famous mountain
resorts
(La La Shan) easily accessible from Taipei. Often just taking the train
and getting off in a small town will result in a pleasant trip to an
uncrowded
and interesting place. 

 Going
to the Taipei Zoo in 1996. After the economic devastation of the late
1990s,
the Taipei Zoo is one of just three or four animal displays on the
island.
On the other hand, aquariums have become big in recent years. Yangminshan National Park, right outside of
Taipei, has
plenty of open space for kids to run around in. Another good site is
the
park on the tip of Hoping Island in Keelung Harbor. Not only is there a
small amusement facility, but there are some fascinating eroded rocks
for
climbing, tidal pools for watching fish and many walkways for
exploring.  

 Temples are lots of fun for all! Here we are at a temple in
the Taipei
suburb of Neihu several years ago. This large temple not only offers
spectacular
views of northern Taipei, but also boasts a small convenience store.
Sitting
at the top of a large hill, it provided exercise, scenery, and sweets
for
the end of the walk. There are many such temples in Taiwan. Open spaces may often be found in temples and
schools,
especially in the park-poor south. Temples are often great places to
take
kids. There are all sorts of mysterious goings-on and nooks and crannys
to run around in. Society is very tolerant of children doing their
thing
in temples. In Taiwan social and religious functions are not divorced
and
people standing around chatting, eating or playing with their kids is a
common sight in every temple. Many temples are important local
gathering
areas as well as tourist sites with wonderful views and are used to
having
small kids around. 

 My
children participate in a political demonstration. The American Club sponsors American-style events
-- Fourth
of July parties, etc. Check with them to see what is going on and if it
is appropriate for little kids.

POW
camp, whose ruins are still extant. Older kids will have fewer choices. Taiwanese
kids watch
TV (much more than American kids) or play basketball, but mostly they
do
homework. The mediocre, high-pressure educational system here robs
children
of their childhood and does not encourage the development of hobbies,
interests,
etc. You&apos;ll have to network to find out about options for older kids.
See
the page on Recreation for more ideas. 

 My
wife and daughter ponder a game of Sequence.  If you are a games-playing family, be sure to
BRING some.
The locals do not play board games and almost no board games are
available
here. Be sure to bring Risk, a US Monopoly version, a good Scrabble
version,
Life, and similar games. Don&apos;t imagine that &quot;I&apos;ll get it later&quot; or &quot;My
parents can ship it.&quot; Buy it, and bring it with you.
Note that many large internet retailers will not ship games
out of the
US.

 Schooling and Day Care 
Education is problem the biggest problem facing expat couples
with children in Taiwan. There just doesn&apos;t seem to be any good
solution to the problem.

 My
kids read each other stories they have written. Children&apos;s English
books
are expensive and found only in a few large stores, Caves and Eslite. School-age children will have
to go to some private school. At
more
than US$1,000 a month, Taipei American School and Morrison Academy
cater
mostly to children of well-off executives and privileged locals. The
Dominican
School in Neihu costs about half of that and the education is OK. I
also
know several Americans with bilingual kids who have kids in the local
school
system, including us.

magnificent east coast. 
 

 Be aware that if you put your kid in the local
system,
they may get hit by the teachers, especially at one of the larger and
more
high-pressure schools (in Taipei hitting is almost gone). If your child
is hit and you are not comfortable with that, by all means talk
directly
to the school principal. The local parents may complain as well, so you
will not be an anomaly. My
son&apos;s class prepares for school. 

  I have one
child in the local system , and had one child at Morrison Christian
Academy,
the local American missionary school, in Taichung. I am now
homeschooling him.

 Although in general the Taiwanese school system
is markedly
inferior to the US, the elementary schools are not too bad (the real
problems
begin in junior high school). One major advantage of Taiwanese schools
is the quality of the lunches. With vegetables, fish, rice, and fresh
fruit
served at every meal, they blow away the ugly brown fried fare of
American
schools. My daughter celebrates her birthday with her class at the
local
elementary
school. Her teacher, an exceptionally together and intelligent young
woman,
prevents things from getting out of hand.  





If you feel like being active, local schools are glad to accept a hand.
We volunteer at my daughter&apos;s school, where my wife tends the library
one day a week as a volunteer mother. Here is a field trip to
a
mushroom farm we accompanied in June of 2005.

and Dan-dan cook up experiments in the backyard. I&apos;ve never seen a
local
child be permitted to play with mud like this.  

 For preschoolers there are a large number of
day-care and
preschools in a variety of languages. Many are unlicensed and run by
individuals
without formal training or credentials. If your kid has any special
needs
they will not be catered to. And be careful, some day-care places hit
the
kids, though most do not. Additionally, teachers often will not
intervene
when kids abuse each other and will often focus their attention mainly
on
older
kids or children of wealthy parents (also true in the schools). My son&apos;s preschool class in 1998. Good preschools may be
found
everywhere.
Bad ones too. 

 During end-of-the-semester periods, teachers will
be busy
preparing plays and presentations for the older kids to show off to
their
parents and often younger children will be neglected. 
But don&apos;t be too paranoid -- many children of foreigners go to
day-care
in Taiwan without trouble. Try and find a local place which has been
around
for a long time.

 It is not difficult to find nannies. You can also
apply
for a Filipino maid through the government, but they cost money and you
have to demonstrate a need. However, many work illegally. A large
percentage
of Taiwanese women earn second incomes caring for babies and toddlers
during
the day. Many middle-class mothers work, frequently from 8 to 8, and
caregivers
are now one of the major child raising strategies for working mothers.
Many grandparents are taking care of children, a strain on both, but
it&apos;s
free to the mother. 
This social phenomenon of caregivers being primary
child-raisers may
have devastating effects for the next generation, but the government is
completely indifferent to the trend.
 Where we&apos;re planning to take the kids
next.... 

 If you are taking care of kids yourself Taiwan
has many
resources. Toys&apos;R&apos;Us and other toy stores carry high-quality imported
toys,
safe and educational. Books, posters and videos in English and Chinese
are widely and cheaply available. Caves Bookstore has an impressive
selection
of English children&apos;s books. Disney videos can often be had after
Disney
has yanked them from the market in the States. Some children are
educated entirely at home and home
schooling curricula are widely available.  My
kids on the glass-bottomed boat in Kenting. Tourist rip-offs like this
transcend cultural boundaries. Even the kids were bored.

 Washing the car is fun in any country.  Ideas 
Kids can make money modeling in Taiwan. Blonde-haired,
blue-eyed people
are favored in Taiwan and kids with those physical characteristics will
be strong favorites for modeling jobs. These can pay well. Just be
careful
about who you&apos;re dealing with. 
 

 My
daughter dances at a local school carnival to raise money for the
school. Agencies like to impress clients with the number
of possible
models they can bring into a job, and will call you in to show off your
kids even when there is no hope. If they don&apos;t pay for transportation,
you can end up investing a lot of money with little return.

small towns. Music lessons of every kind are widely available
in the
cities. Yamaha operates a chain of schools which provide instruction in
any kind of instrument. Ballet, art, calligraphy and other classes are
also widely available.
Child-oriented computer software in English and Chinese is
widely and
cheaply available.
