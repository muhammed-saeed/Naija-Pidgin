Expert Training

Before even signing on as a new Checkers and Rally’s franchisee,
prospective franchisees are invited to spend a day in the restaurant
and run through a quick crash course in the life of a restaurateur.

After successfully qualifying, reviewing, and signing on as a new
Checkers and Rally’s franchisee, our executive team charges 
 forward
with the training and education necessary for not only getting your 
 location open,
but for showing you the system that has created so many
Checkers and Rally’s franchisee’s success stories.

Checkers and Rally’s training entails a four-week
intensive restaurant training program in which franchisees
are walked through every job and aspect of owning and operating
a Checkers and Rally’s restaurant. By playing every role in 
 the restaurant,
franchisees are prepared in every aspect needed to then train their 
 restaurant team.
Additionally, Checkers and Rally’s offers ongoing
one-on-one training programs throughout franchisee’s tenures.
