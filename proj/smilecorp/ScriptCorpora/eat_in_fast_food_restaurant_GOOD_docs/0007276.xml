 Is it because their lives are so busy they can not sit down to a proper meal, even then do they call a proper meal some thing that is out of a packet or tin.
I think most fast food tastes disgusting, years ago fish and chips were a Friday night treat
but now the vendors have lost the art, it seems to me they only wrap them in two layers of paper to soak up all the grease rather than keep them warm.
A burger from a fast food place only tastes of the relish, what is in the so called beef burger
i guess is any thing but lean beef.
When on very rare occasions i go to the supermarket, i see trolleys piled high with packets and tins of so called food, i would not call it food i would call it a concoction of ingredients that sellers can legally pass on as food, it seems modern man expects to eat gunge that has passed through a grist mill and needs the services of a chemist to add flavour, and may be the packaging costs more than the ingredients.
But i have worked in the food industry for over 20yrs so please keep tucking in or i will be jobless.

 Occasionally I go to a shop of a certain large &apos;fast food chain&apos; to get a six inch parmesan tuna sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, pickles, oignons, no sauce.

it&apos;s fast, delicious and not that unhealthy.

 Our earliest ancestors were hunters who took a dim view of prey that was easy to catch. Easy to catch meant the animal probably was sick and not safe to eat. They prefered fast food and MacWendy King is just the modern manifestation of that preference. This is why when you don&apos;t eat fast food, it&apos;s called fasting. This is true even if you eat sloes. In short, the early bird catches the worm, food for thought for both birds and worms.

I do tend to eat fast food breakfast, a bagle with a scrambled egg on it, or a yogurt and fruit bowl. Their are healthy choices at most fast food places these days.

 Retired Staff What amazes me is how many people have simply not learned to cook! They get fast food because they don&apos;t know how to make a homecooked meal...and don&apos;t realize it would take less time to prepare than the drive to the fast food place. I had a student visit with me last month to shadow me, and she stayed at my home for two weeks. I made homecooked dinners for us, even with the busy schedule we had. She didn&apos;t know how to cook much, and was amazed at how simple it was to make very tasty meals (I taught her how to make a few of the dishes so she could go back to school and amaze her roommates). I think it&apos;s a shame when parents haven&apos;t passed on to their children the skill of how to cook, and of course these people who don&apos;t know how to cook will never be cooking for their kids either. Those are the people then end up at fast food restaurants every day.

Add fast food meals to the sedentary desk jobs so many people have, and we suddenly know why they all are getting so obese. The fast food chains have also completely distorted portion sizes. Wendy&apos;s actually dropped their smallest size fries and sodas about a year ago. Now a small is what used to be a medium. All the other sizes have increased too. Younger people are astonished when I explain to them that a small soda and fries, when I was a kid (i.e., what my parents would order for themselves), used to be the size of what is now a children&apos;s meal. And they no longer even have anything resembling what we used to get in a children&apos;s meal (by the time I was a teen, the children&apos;s meal was already increased in size to be a regular adult portion small fries and soda...when I&apos;d go out with my high school friends, we&apos;d order the kid&apos;s meal because it was plenty big enough for us). If you presented a children&apos;s meal to an adult as a full-portion meal now, they&apos;d look at you like you were crazy.

 Posts: 376 I don&apos;t like fast food, i think most of it tastes horrible and a lot of it isn&apos;t cheap either! I only get it if I am in a bind and am so hungry I don&apos;t want to skip a meal....probably once every month or two.

 Retired Staff I quite like the chicken burgers from fast food places like KFC and McDonalds. I rarely have fast food though. Perhaps once a month.

Just about every fast food chain now has a single item with over a thousand calories.

 I thought that just represented good value for money. It was the fast food chains looking after us.

 Well yes a sarnie is a sarnie where ever it is eaten, i meant cooked fast food as in burgers,
kebabs, fish and chips etc.
And i agree with MoonB on portion sizes, it amazes me where some people put their food,
it seems all most impossible they could shovel so much in with out exploding.
I see another trick for selling in supermarkets getting more prevalent, the buy 2 for 1 or
4 for 3 etc, these may seem a bargain but it is just a ploy to get you eating some thing more regularly than you would normally.

 If they&apos;re soaking the grease out of the food, then they truly have lost the art of fast food. There&apos;s nothing quite like a bag of hamburgers from White Castle where, if you&apos;re a regular customer, they&apos;ll even toss in a little extra grease free of charge!

Extra grease on your hands is good. I never had my steering wheel suddenly lock up in the middle of driving even once when I used to eat at White Castle! 

(Of course, back then, they didn&apos;t have steering wheels that locked up when the ignition key was removed, either. )
