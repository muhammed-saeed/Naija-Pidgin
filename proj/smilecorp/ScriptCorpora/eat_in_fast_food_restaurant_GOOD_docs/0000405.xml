NEXTEP expands services to different markets

NEXTEP SYSTEMS has developed new partnerships with a plethora of companies spanning several industries, including travel, retail, casinos and restaurants.

 NEXTEP expands services to different markets | selfserviceworld.com 

&quot;Many of those markets were underserved in the past,&quot; said Tommy Woycik, the company&apos;s president.

One of NEXTEP&apos;s newest partners is in the grocery/deli industry. It&apos;s now providing Nevada-based Glazier&apos;s with iPad, Kiosk and OSM solutions.

Another grocer, Nino Salvaggio, also expanded its relationship with NEXTEP by adding smartphone ordering and scale integration, as well as updating its self-order Deli 1-2-3 Kiosks. The system greets customers, remembers their previous orders, suggests new and complementary items, and takes orders. It can also text the customer when an order is complete, reducing congestion at the deli counter.

Implementing digital menu displays is another way grocers are using self-service. Pyramid Foods in Springfield, Mo., recently deployed the displays to allow operators to customize content instantaneously and to engage the customers&apos; attention, elevating sales and profits, Woycik said.

Features Include:

Shared administration with automated ordering
Integration of rich media (images, audio, video, animations)
Advertisement and promotional video frames
Immediate and zero-cost menu/media updates
Remote administration
Extensive screen layout templates
Woycik said NEXTEP is always open to working with new industries.

&quot;Our criteria for analyzing these opportunities is rather simple,&quot; he said.

First, the company performs a gap analysis between its existing solution and the requirements of the new prospect.

&quot;The less development required, the more likely we are to enter the new market,&quot; he said.

Second, NEXTEP performs an informal market analysis, looking at the industry trends, competitive landscape, barriers to entry and other factors specific to that industry.

&quot;If we are convinced that we can take and maintain a leadership position in the new vertical market, we are likely to cooperate with a retailer in that industry to develop a new solution,&quot; Woycik said.

That&apos;s what happened with the airport restaurant industry. Tastes on the Fly, an LLC that runs several airport restaurants, recently deployed NEXTEP&apos;s digital menu displays at Dine Boston inside Boston Logan International Airport and in Napa Farms Market in San Francisco International Airport.

¡Que Bueno! of the Mission Restaurant Group at the Denver International Airport also recently implemented the digital menu boards.

NEXTEP not only provides the customer-facing solution, but also allows airport staff to control dayparting, pricing and graphics remotely via mynextep.net.

Other new NEXTEP partners inlcude the Mohegan Sun Hotel and Casino in Uncasville, Conn., and Cherokee Casino and Resort in West Siloam Springs, Okla. Both gaming venues have deployed kiosks to allow gamblers to order food and drinks.

One of the company&apos;s most recent restaurant partner is Boloco, a chain specializing in burritos. It&apos;s using NEXTEP&apos;s self-order kiosks, its NETPOS interface and Paytronix loyalty rewards interface in two of its restaurants. And Zoup! Fresh Soup Company deployed NEXTEP digital menu displays in five of its locations.

Lastly, Shaka&apos;s convenience stores in Idaho are using self-ordering kiosks with a custom user interface for their new sandwich concept. The gas stations now offer made-to-order sandwiches along with gasoline and the typical grab-and-go fare. And like the airport restaurants, Shaka&apos;s manages and monitors the touchscreen kiosks via mynextep.net

Quick-service-restaurant kiosks: What’s taking so long?

 Quick-service-restaurant kiosks: What’s taking so long? | KioskMarketplace 

Alicia Kelso editor, QSRWeb.com • 07 Sep 2010

By now, it’s almost a given that self-service kiosks have a place at the quick-service restaurant (QSR) table. But whether or not it’s at the head of the table or in a child-booster seat remains to be seen.

This concept has been discussed at least since 2006, when Subway, McDonald’s, Burger King and Arby’s began trying out kiosk systems, which allow customers to place and pay for orders themselves through a touch screen device.

And other chains have added kiosks here and there, but there hasn’t necessarily been an explosion as many predicted.

According to Tommy Woycik, president of kiosk supplier NEXTEP Systems, the restaurant industry is a bit of an anomaly. There has been an explosion in kiosk deployments in airports, grocery stores and casinos, but in restaurants, kiosks have “just sort of trickled into place,” he says.

“We’ve been doing this for six years, and every year our restaurant revenue has gone up 40 to 50 percent. It’s been good, sure, but it lags a lot behind other industries, which have doubled in that same time,” Woycik said. “We thought it’d be higher at restaurants — both in the fast casual and quick-service segments — but it’s just not at the same rates.”

What’s the holdup? Some companies are apprehensive about intimidating technology-trepid customers. Others might be trigger-shy about the cost of a new system rollout, nervous about obsolescing their workforce, or about compromising customer service.

What is certain is that the United States is behind European and Asian countries in embracing self-service systems by “10 to 12 years,” according to Woycik.

“It’s not that customers aren’t ready. This trend is evident in other industries, and people love it. They’d much rather self-serve than wait in line,” he said. “The biggest issue is restaurants worrying it impersonalizes customer service. But two-thirds of their business goes through the drive-thru, an experience that minimizes personalization. If I want to focus on customer service, I go to a nice steak house, not a fast food place.”

Woycik acknowledges that adding kiosks is a significant technology undertaking that dramatically changes the operational flow of a restaurant. In addition, the QSR industry is filled with franchisees that oftentimes must wait for the parent company’s blessing to make any changes. That can mean a two-tiered sales approach for kiosk suppliers, slowing down saturation.

“Often only the parent company prescribes what technology can be used. Which is understandable since they’re doing the accounting,” Woycik said.

That leads to a circle of ‘Can I do it?’ to ‘Go ahead but you’re paying for it,’ to ‘But I can’t afford it.’

Still, a number of chains continue to test the self-serve waters.

El Pollo Loco added self-serve kiosks in two California locations this summer and Jack in the Box now has about 230 installed in stores throughout the country. Both companies are supplied by EMN8.

Jack in the Box began testing kiosks in 2006 as part of the company’s strategy to reinvent the brand through innovation in guest services, menu and restaurant facilities. The company has plans in place for kiosk installation at additional locations based on dine-in sales volume and certain demographic information, as well as transaction data.

El Pollo Loco is just starting to get into the game and has no timetable set as to whether or not it will expand its kiosk presence. For now, the company is focused on perfecting the two stores that do have the equipment.

“We expect to make changes to the physical layout of the kiosks, the order screens and other adjustments based on customer feedback from our test in the two initial restaurants,” said Joe Stein, senior vice president of strategy and innovation.

The response to the kiosks has been thumbs-up and thumbs-down.

“We’ve received positive feedback from guests who like the technology, and negative feedback from guests who were initially taken aback by the kiosks in the lobby,” Stein said.

Deli Kiosks - Big Y Foods Inc. Implements NCR Deli Ordering Kiosks

Now featured in 18 Big Y stores throughout New England, each Big Y deli kiosk uses the NCR Netkey deli ordering application and several run on NCR EasyPoint(TM) Advantage kiosk hardware. All future Big Y stores will feature the combined NCR kiosk software and hardware solution.


 source link 

DULUTH, Ga., Sep 01, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- NCR Corporation (NCR 13.19, +0.34, +2.65%) today announced that Big Y Foods Inc. has completed its initial deployment of automated deli ordering kiosks powered by NCR&apos;s self-service technology. Now featured in 18 Big Y stores throughout New England, each Big Y deli kiosk uses the NCR Netkey deli ordering application and several run on NCR EasyPoint(TM) Advantage kiosk hardware. All future Big Y stores will feature the combined NCR kiosk software and hardware solution.

To use the kiosks, Big Y customers simply swipe their Big Y Express Savings card. The simple and intuitive touch screen enables shoppers to place and customize their meat or cheese order from the in-store deli. The NCR software determines the appropriate time for the customer to return to the deli counter to pick up their order, which is then printed at the bottom of the customer&apos;s receipt. An in-store announcement also alerts customers when their order is ready. Customers have the added convenience of being able to check the price of all in-store merchandise at the kiosks.

&quot;The self-service kiosks extend even more choices to our shoppers as part of our commitment to deliver the best possible shopping experience,&quot; said Bill Classen, deli sales manager, Big Y Foods Inc. &quot;Our customers appreciate the option to place their deli orders without waiting in line and the extra convenience the kiosks provide.&quot;

The NCR Netkey management software is the first to bring together in-store digital advertising and self-service kiosks under a single platform, enabling retailers to leverage rich multimedia content across digital signs and kiosks. For example, retailers could opt to use digital advertising to promote their frequent shopper program and then make it easy for shoppers to enroll at self-service kiosks.

&quot;The deli is often one of the highest profit centers for grocers, but it can also be the most frustrating and delay-filled part of the customer&apos;s shopping experience,&quot; said Dusty Lutz, general manager, NCR Netkey kiosk and digital signage solutions. &quot;Grocers can use the NCR Netkey deli ordering application as part of an integrated loyalty program, in a converged retailing -- or c-tailing -- manner, to deliver targeted offers to consumers and simplify ordering for loyalty card members based on their previous purchases, saving valuable time and improving the shopping experience.&quot;

NCR Netkey is one of NCR&apos;s c-tailing(TM) solutions, a set of software and services that enable retailers to offer consumers greater personalization and consistency across channels, such as the Internet, mobile devices, social media and in the store. These converged retailing solutions enable retailers to differentiate themselves, lower operating costs and attract today&apos;s empowered and elusive consumer. Additional information on the NCR c-tailing solutions can be found at: http://www.ncr.com/c-tailing.

Drive Thru Ordering at Subway Deployed

New outdoor ordering option for Subway features weatherproof 32&quot; LCD with Display Positioning System. Future enhancements include credit card reader and barcode scanner.

 Touch-Screen Drive-Thru Kiosks 

Subway: NEXTEP SYSTEMS Touch Screen Drive-Thru Delivers ROI in 24 Weeks

A 20-year veteran with 25 successful Subway® franchises, Rob Woodward recently added NEXTEP SYSTEMS touch-screen kiosks to restaurants in Loveland, Colorado and Cheyenne, Wyoming.

“The only way to do drive-thru today is with this kiosk,” said Woodward, who now has four restaurants with touch-screen drive-thru kiosks. “Previously we had to have a dedicated employee asking and answering 50 questions about each sandwich. It was a slow, inaccurate and very costly means of taking orders. Our customers love the new system.”

“With the NEXTEP SYSTEMS kiosk, an average store will make enough additional profit to pay for the kiosk in six months,” estimated Woodward. “Not only does the kiosk generate an additional 15% increase in sales, it also saves 40 employee hours per week, as it doesn’t require someone dedicated to taking orders.”

Woodward said NEXTEP SYSTEMS kiosks are “faster, more accurate, and are more profitable” than traditional drive-thrus, and orders are larger. “The interactive kiosks are not shy about prompting customers for double meat or extra cheese,” said Woodward.

“The touch-screen drive-thru kiosks account for 30% to 35% of our sales. I&apos;d guess half those customers would come inside anyway. That still translates into 15% increase in sales,” explained Woodward. “A $10,000 per week store would generate additional $1,500 in weekly sales. Labor doesn&apos;t increase much; food, royalties, and labor are approximately 50%. That translates to $750 per week clear profit.”

“Our investment in a drive thru kiosk is typically paid back within 24 weeks. Obviously it starts a little slower until customers use it, but payback is clearly huge,” said Woodward, who will be installing NEXTEP SYSTEMS kiosks in additional locations.

Subway recently began offering a full breakfast menu. “The fast-food breakfast segment is dominated by just one or two major players,&quot; said Woodward. &quot;Subway can beat the competition in quality, freshness and health. Convenience is the primary hurdle. I believe that the NEXTEP kiosks are a key component to Subway&apos;s speed, accuracy and profitability in drive-thru business.”

“Throughput speed and customer satisfaction will increase even further once we enable customer payment at the kiosks this spring,” said Tommy Woycik, president of NEXTEP SYSTEMS. “Once the credit-card reader and barcode scanner are activated, we will have the ability to identify a specific customer, and the system will remember and display their previous order preferences.”

NEXTEP has worked with Subway since 2005. “Our enterprise management package provides an affordable and simple solution for the franchisee to modify menu options for any given location remotely,” said Woycik. “It provides a critical capability since each Subway location can have unique menu items, hours and prices.” Subway has more than 30,000 franchise locations worldwide.

The touch screen kiosks were developed by NEXTEP SYSTEMS and MRI, an industry leader in outdoor kiosk and digital signage hardware. Running NEXTEP SYSTEMS’ software, the kiosks feature a weatherproof 32” vertical interactive touch screen with an ambient light sensor to adjust brightness, and a Display Positioning System (DPS) to correctly adjust the ordering area for varying vehicle heights. They are available with a proximity sensor to welcome each customer as well as a webcam and premium audio system that allows restaurant staff to view and interact with the customer if needed.

Woodward was involved in the first generation of NEXTEP SYSTEMS touch screen kiosks installed between 2006 and 2008.

NEXTEP SYSTEMS, based in Troy, Michigan, is a leading provider of automated ordering solutions for QSR, casinos, airports, sporting arenas, grocery stores, hotels and other high-volume venues. NEXTEP’s core business revolves around self-service kiosks, Dynamic Digital Menu Displays™ and online ordering platforms. Subway® is a registered trademark of Doctors Associates Inc.

&apos;Holy Grail&apos; Nearing Local Grill: Food-Order Kiosks Rolling Out

Some splash news on new deli order terminals installed in Metro Silver Diners. Also mentions 70 in Subway.

By PATRICK SEITZ, INVESTOR&apos;S BUSINESS DAILY
Posted 10/08/2009 07:31 PM ET

Metro Silver Diners in Maryland and Virginia use Nextep kiosks. View Enlarged Image

The next time you&apos;re asked &quot;Do you want fries with that?&quot; the asker might be a robot.

The restaurant industry is widely expected to be the next big market for consumer self-service technology. After years of testing, quick-service, deli and casual restaurants are starting to deploy order-taking kiosks.

Food-ordering kiosks are viewed by many in the restaurant field as the Holy Grail, says Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Woycik, president of kiosk maker Nextep Systems. &quot;The potential is absolutely huge,&quot; he said, &quot;but the current penetration is still very low.&quot;

Nextep has supplied about 70 self-order kiosks for Subway sandwich shops, which are testing the technology. The chain has some 30,000 locations in more than 90 countries.

&quot;The potential for this technology is much larger than for a lot of the other self-service markets, such as self-check-in at the airport,&quot; Woycik said. &quot;There are far fewer airports than there are Subways or Starbucks or McDonald&apos;s.&quot;

2.56 Million Kiosks By 2014

Big quick-serve and fast-casual sandwich restaurants have been testing self-ordering kiosks — computerized machines, or robots — for about five years. The technology has improved greatly since then, so the chains are closer to wide-scale rollouts, Woycik says.

Food-ordering kiosks are part of the bigger shift toward consumer self-service.

The number of self-service kiosks worldwide is expected to jump to 2.56 million in 2014 from just over 1 million this year, a compound annual growth rate of nearly 19%, says Larry Fisher, an analyst at NextGen Research. The top kiosk applications this year are entertainment, retail and travel.

Leading quick-serve restaurants are considering large-scale deployments of food-ordering kiosks starting next year, Fisher says.

Woycik says the benefits of self-ordering kiosks in restaurants are clear. Sales typically rise 20% to 30%, he says. The hike comes from suggestive upselling and the ability to fulfill more orders at peak times.

&quot;A kiosk can consistently outperform an employee at upselling,&quot; Woycik said. &quot;You know, &apos;Would you like to add fries with that? Would you like bacon on your sandwich?&apos; That type of stuff.&quot;

Why? The appetizing pictures on the kiosk display, for one. Seeing crispy bacon on a sandwich or a frosty ice cream cone on the screen works better than words alone.

Also, consumers have a natural inclination to say &quot;no&quot; when they feel they&apos;re being upsold by a person, Woycik says.

Plus, by automating the ordering process, the same number of employees can fulfill more orders at peak periods, Woycik says. The kiosks keep the line moving, eliminating walk-aways. &quot;Throughput is increased 10% to 20%, easily, during peak periods,&quot; he said. Employees who normally work the register can be put to work filling orders.
