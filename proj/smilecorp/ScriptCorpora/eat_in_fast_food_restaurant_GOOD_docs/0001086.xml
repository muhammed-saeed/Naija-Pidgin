 Post a Comment Now. Comments Thu, 11 May 2006 16:51:00 GMT (1) Your restaurant by itself? If so, here&apos;s info about the WARN Act. See particularly, however, page 7 (you will have to have Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this file). It specifically states that 60 days is required if, among other things, your facility will be closed for 6 months, or your hours are reduced by at least half over a period of 6 months. It appears WARN might then apply here. Must be a pretty big restaurant. :)

This page also gives a person&apos;s name and phone number to contact for more information.
http://www.doleta.gov/layoff/warn.cfm Tue, 09 May 2006 05:46:00 GMT (2) How long should an employer give us the notice before the business closes ? It depends on how big the business is. Employers with 100 or more employees fall under the federal WARN Act which requres 60 days notice (or pay in lieu of notice) of a business closing. There are specific exceptions to that however, such as when the closing or mass-layoff can&apos;t be forseen.

If you work for a small establishment, then you probably have far less than 100 employees and the federal law doesn&apos;t apply. Thu, 11 May 2006 16:11:00 GMT (3) The restaurant i work for has 100 or more employees. Does this particular case merit severence pay, If so how do i go about collecting ? Thu, 11 May 2006 17:24:00 GMT (4) You can also check info about the Ca. warn law. It is more protective than the federal.&quot;A possible civil penalty of $500 a day for each day of violation.&quot;
