 CNB receives more than $100 million in contracts 

Department of Defense awards CNB its largest ever federal contract

 Staff Reports Claremore Progress The Claremore Daily Progress Wed Mar 21, 2012, 03:58 PM CDT 
 
TULSA—Cherokee Nation Businesses today announced the receipt of two Department of Defense contracts totaling more than $100 million, including the largest federal contract ever awarded to the tribe. 

“This is a proud day for the Cherokee Nation and the Cherokee people,”said Bill John Baker, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.“These two contracts, including the largest ever awarded to a CNB entity, show the federal government’s confidence in us to provide the highest quality of work, while supporting the men and women who so bravely serve our country.”

This month, Cherokee Nation Red Wing, operating under CNB’s security and defense division, was awarded an ID/IQ (indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity) contract with a ceiling of $18.46 million from the U.S. Army. The contract will provide materials and services in support of reset, modification and repair activities of Army missile and aviation systems.

Additionally, Cherokee Nation Red Wing was awarded a modification of $66,666,994 to a contract awarded last year, increasing the period of performance to three years and bringing the total contract ceiling to $84.25 million. This contract is designed to provide the U.S. Army with hardware logistics services, supporting various missile and aviation systems.

“The Cherokee Nation is entering an exciting new era. Federal contracts like this allow us to diversify away from gaming into many new sectors of business and industry, showing that we are a leader among tribal nations,”Baker said.“By developing our non-gaming resources, we achieve two very important goals: create job opportunities for Cherokees in many different fields, and fortify ourselves economically so we can better provide for our people.”

These contracts expand on the current capabilities Cherokee Nation Red Wing already provides the Army and will create an additional 16-28 jobs, including mechanics, engineers, shipping/receiving personnel, program analysts and managers.

“The receipt of these contracts is a testament to CNB’s capabilities and reputation,”said Russell Claybrook, president of CNB’s security and defense division.“It’s extremely rewarding to have the federal government recognize all that we are capable of by awarding such a sizable and important contract.”
