Business Free Plan Restaurant Questions and Answers




Resolved Question: Do you think its fair that I have to pay rent?
Parents are going to start to charge me $300 a month for rent. I am 22 still going to school and roughly make 15k a year which covers my car payment and some tuiton costs. Last week my parents asked me to pay $300 a month. If I agree to do this I will probably have to either sell my car (if someone buys it) or just stop making payments on it and ruin my credit. I really dont think its fair because I used to help my dad a lot at a restaurant he owns. I actually still help him at his business when I have free time. I would work almost 8 hours a day six days a week and I would never ask him for pay. Now they come up with this BS paying them $300 a month. My other option would be just leaving the house, and live out of my car or go with a family member. The problem is that if I leave Ill just make things worse. They dont want me to move out but they want me to pay rent thats just really fucked up. Either way Im planning on moving out, I cant take their shit anymore. im just wondering if anyone has been in my situation and how they handled this.  more 


Resolved Question: small business question?
Yet another small business question. I am opening a small business and want to see what you all think of my plan thus far. I have made a business plan and I think I can get away with a start-up of 30K and maybe I&apos;ll have another 20k on reserve for the next year or two for living expenses and unexpected business expenses. I am paying 700 TOTAL a month (lease) including all of my utilities. A frickin&apos;deal. Water/propane/electricity. I will be located in a town of about 3k with 20K in the county. I am just outside of the city limits. There are two colleges in my town...one military and one high end frat school with lots of money. Both are relatively small schools. I am located in a shopping center that is on the slower end of things. It&apos;s a small town so don&apos;t imagine this bustling shopping center. I am the only food within the shopping center...and The Tractor Supply gets a decent bit of business(small southern town)...my smells will travel the 50 feet over to that stores gates. I will be sharing a space with the local YMCA. So I will have immediate foot-traffic and there is already expectation for our arrival in four to five months(word of mouth spreasd like wildfire..plus i&apos;m a local kid returning to the town and there is excitement about that.) We will be serving organic coffee/organic smoothies/tea/paninis (on home-made bread)/wraps/soup/ and a unique eclectic breakfast and lunch menu. Revenue willing i&apos;ll open up for dinner in 6 months or a year. I&apos;ll do a brunch on sundays and maybe a special dinner occassionally to build anticipation. If i had a theme it&apos;d be down home goes up-town. I&apos;ll be making everything from scratch and it will be sustainably focused and locally focused. Tons of farmers in this area I will gladly support. Organic beef....organic veggies...free-range and antibiotic free animals are the way I want to go.  A littl about me...I&apos;m a 25 year old self-taught chef that has been working in restaurants/cafe&apos;s for 7-8 years. I&apos;ve done everything from prep work to high volume line work...to fine dining with intense plate timing/ high volume organic hot bar/buffet work to feed 300 people in a day. I&apos;ve done it all. I&apos;m used to being on my feet...i&apos;m young and energetic...ready to work these 8-12 hour days 6 days a week in order to make this a success. Mission statement- To provide the customer with fresh, local, uniquely prepared dishes in a casual family oriented environment. I will have art on the walls that is one of a kind (the kind that makes your mouth drop)...it&apos;s imaginative...kinda like a modern day alice in wondland meets tim burton sorta thing. The kitchen is open so you will hear me cook...so naturally the theme and feel will be a high energy/colorful/high paced music feel.Basically when you walk in the ideal feel would be the smell of roastd garlic hitting your nostrils...&quot;burning down the house&quot;by talking heads hits you smoothly and the chatter and bright feel of the place instantly entices your appetite.This will not be a normal soup and sandwiches place, though. I&apos;m going to have unique takes on eggs benedict....home-made french toast with bright fresh fruit and home-made whipped cream and A Maply syrup...i&apos;m going to have a Lump crab(or crawfish) cake....home-made hummus/garlic bread/french bread/deli salads like chicken and egg and potato salad...Black and blue chese bison burger (grass fed USDA organic.)...pulled pork sandwich on locally made onion roll and home-made BBQ sauce....Sorry this is all so scattered guys I&apos;m not an English major! I think I have about 12K in equipment and utensils and such i&apos;d need to purchase...deli case...used convection oven...vita-mix blenders...slicer...Hobart mixer...all this stuff will be acquired used at auctions or from friends. I forgot to mention I am partnering with my girlfriend and we will be the only two running the show. It will be tons of work and at times will feel like we need more help, but I&apos;m a very capable hard working chef and am up to the challenge. I can do a lot more than the average person. There is a bar where when the food is made I&apos;ll call out the name and they come and pick it up. Sandwiches will be served on plastic reuasble plates...nicer meals on real plates...i&apos;ll have biodegradable to go containers and stuff...recycling...a 50&quot;plasma for nws and sportscenter...free WIFI....My father owns a small business and his accountant is going to help me a fw hours a week do my books. I;ll be using quickbooks and I have a POS system in mind. I&apos;m inexperienced when it comes to the books but I have the right support systems in place for success. Low start-up/ready-to-go space/community support/cheap rent/passion to do it and I need a change in my life right now. So is this a good plan?Seriously? Fuck this site...jokers. No answers? No comments? The top contributor in this category didn&apos;t even read the beginning of the question apparently? I hav a business plan and license and nxt step is funding. I bet you just sit at your computer Henry and go to each individual question begging for some points by giving a short BS answer.  more

A chinese business man was successful in China, able to manage people and a business. After so many years of hard work he decided to finally take a vacation in Costa Rica. In he&apos;s one week stay at a beautiful lake, he went by a local restaurant to have lunch, he ordered fish with salad. The chinese man never had such great fish and was so delighted he sat the owner down for a business proposal, with he&apos;s extended knowledge in business he told the owner that he was willing to bring a team of workers, contractors and exporters to build a small company were they can gather fishes and export them to china.

Resolved Question: Am I Staying Too Long In a Relationship With a Controlling Boyfriend?
I met my boyfriend in January of this year. He&apos;s a retired AF Major and unfortunately still thinks he has the control he once had in the military. We&apos;re not youngsters, but I am a young looking and acting 66 and he&apos;s an active and fit 70. He works out 3 times a week, walks and eats healthy. He does have chronic sinus problems and takes many Vitamin C&apos;s a day. He has gastritis and embarrassingly in public and private burps and passes gas regularly. He takes many pepto&apos;s a day for that. The doc just did an endoscopy. On our 2nd date he showed me a&quot;schedule&quot;of the events he had typed up for our future 2 weeks of dating. All were free or cheap, like the libraries in different cities, thrift stores, museums, restaurants. He writes all of our meals off as business expenses so I literally don&apos;t cost him much. I was amused because he assumed we&apos;d be dating in the future. We started off by being intimate every single night of the week for 2 months. He has ED but that doesn&apos;t stop him from being as active as he can be. We had to take a break and now he complains we aren&apos;t as active and says I&apos;m withholding. I don&apos;t go to the gym like I used to but play racquetball with him once a week. We walk but when it&apos;s windy I don&apos;t like to and he&apos;s mad about that. He likes sunsets and instantly says let&apos;s see one even if it&apos;s hazy out. When I decline, he&apos;s mad and says never again will he ask me to walk or see a sunset or the moon or have sex. He always goes off the deep end if I refuse once to do something. I hate to argue. But I voice my opinion and let my boyfriend know when I don&apos;t like something. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t do that in the beginning and went along with EVERYTHING he wanted to do, I guess so I wouldn&apos;t be considered difficult. He made it a point to tell me his 2 prior girlfriends of 2 years and 3 years, were always in agreement with what he wanted to do and had planned. He had them pay for their share of the camping trips they went on in his camper. We have been on 2 camping trips and I have paid my share. He is so controlling that he will not accept that I am now voicing my opinion on places to go and things I don&apos;t like. He thought we&apos;d go through life with me never voicing my opinion. He says he&quot;gives&apos;me choices and suggestions, like I never had them before I met him. He has spur of the moment ideas like watching the moon at a dark reservoir that I was cautious to go to. We ended up going to a parking lot and watching, all the while him yelling at me at the top of his lungs that I was a chicken. I ended up getting out of the car and him following me through the parking lot. He has an explosive personality. He will be talking normally and then when the conversation doesn&apos;t end when he wants it to, he SCREAMS at me for a long time, causing me to walk home the other night at 1;30 am although he did follow me in his car. He argues so much with me that he almost rear ended a car at a stop sign in the rain the other night and if I hadn&apos;t yelled at him, he would have. His driving is horrendous and I cringe whenever I get into his van. He continually berates and belittles himself and me. He calls himself all kinds of horrible names,&quot;I&apos;m a..... or a ....... I guess he wants me to say, no you&apos;re not. I don&apos;t know. We bought a paperback about relationships and he kept it and is reading it and critiquing it. He writes about his views on the author&apos;s opinions and presents it to me after dinner out. We have closed up restaurants because he insists on pulling out all this paperwork he types up, like a new resume for me as I&apos;m retired 2 years now. He wants me to go back to work so we can afford our life together even though he&apos;s a Financial Advisor and owns 2 businesses. I have my own wedding business on the weekends but he doesn&apos;t want me to have my business anymore as it interferes with our going away. He accuses me of being lazy because I&apos;m in no hurry to go back to work at 66. He told me he loved me the 2nd week of dating and I told him it was too soon. But he insisted that he was so intense about it. I thought I loved him too, but that is leaving fast as he is getting more and more demanding of me. He in no way demanded of his last 2 girlfriends what he demands of me. Why can&apos;t he be as laid back with me as he was with them. We would have a great relationship. He uses adjectives to describe himself as sensitive and that he suffers when things don&apos;t go his way. He says I&apos;m very mean to him on purpose. I told him he is very spoiled and wants things his way or he can&apos;t function and his paperwork is getting worse. He types papers up for anything he thinks of like our ISSUES and INCOMPATIBILITY and anything he thinks of to type about. He made derogatory remarks about my mother and brother  more

Resolved Question: How soon after starting to talk to a girl can you ask her out for a date?
I&apos;m trying to get a girlfriend, and one problem I think I have is that I have always thought that it was not the done thing to ask out a girl unless she had given a clear indication that she liked you.So for years I have been talking to nice girls and at the end of the conversation there was no indication that she liked me, and off she would go.In fact the one time I did ask out a girl it was after talking to me on several occasions, and it really felt hard to ask her out. She said no.So I am going to take a different approach, which is to ask out a girl almost by default. Almost as soon as I get chatting to her. My question is how long is the minimum amount of time needed so that she doesn&apos;t think I&apos;m a rapist or dodgy something?So I&apos;ll be like:&quot;It is nice talking to you. Here&apos;s my business card (with my phone number and email address). Do feel free to contact me if you feel like going out for a date; a drink or a meal sometime&quot;You see that takes all the pressure and tension out of the situation, by 1. acknowledging to her that you fancy her, and 2. removing the fears in her that the man might ask her out - because I already have!Then it is just a case of waiting for her to call or text me to arrange the date. If she likes me.I met a girl in a Chinese restaurant yesterday and tried it, and to my amazement she said yes! I mean I didn&apos;t say would she like a date I said would she like a drink. So I suppose it is possible that she thinks it was actually a social invite (and that she already has a boyfriend) but I don&apos;t know.She has not contacted me yet, and perhaps she won&apos;t, but I thought it was a bit of a breakthrough.Perhaps as a phase 2 of the plan I can as well as giving her my card I can ask for her number. That would enable me to call her if she is subsequently less inclined to call me.And then. well, I might have some success with the ladies!About time as I&apos;m 43 years old, with a trail of frustration and angst behind me.Mind you it does leave me a tad apprehensive; one gets comfortable in one&apos;s celibate lifestyle.Just hope my old man doesn&apos;t fall off!  more 


Resolved Question: So Herman Cain is pro-choice, worked for the fed, and was a lobbyist. Who is Herman Cain?
WASHINGTON — Herman Cain, the Republican presidential candidate with the sharp wit and easy-to-remember tax plan, is a cancer survivor, radio host and former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza. On the campaign trail, he talks up his business experience, casting himself as a “problem solver” and Washington outsider.But the role that helped propel Mr. Cain into politics was that of an ultimate Washington insider: industry lobbyist.From 1996, when he left the pizza company, until 1999, Mr. Cain ran the National Restaurant Association, a once-sleepy trade group that he transformed into a lobbying powerhouse. He allied himself closely with cigarette makers fighting restaurant smoking bans, spoke out against lowering blood-alcohol limits as a way to prevent drunken driving, fought an increase in the minimum wage and opposed a patients’ bill of rights — all in keeping with the interests of the industry he represented.It was a role that gave him an intimate view of the way Washington works, putting him in close proximity to Republican leaders at the time, including Newt Gingrich, now one of his presidential rivals, and John A. Boehner, now speaker of the House. And it helped Mr. Cain lay the groundwork for the next chapter in his life, his entry into electoral politics, beginning with a short-lived bid for the White House in 2000.Those who knew him then could see his ambitions developing. Rob Meyne, an official at the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which contributed handsomely to the restaurant group, wrote in a 1999 e-mail to his colleagues that Mr. Cain’s presidential plans were “not totally unexpected.” In the message, part of an online archive of tobacco industry documents, a wry and somewhat skeptical Mr. Meyne assessed Mr. Cain’s chances.“Nice to have goals, huh?” Mr. Meyne wrote, speculating that perhaps Mr. Cain wanted to be vice president or had a cabinet post in mind. “In any event,” he went on, “Cain brings some positives. He is a genuine ‘antigovernment mandate’ conservative who happens to be an African-American. He is a wonderful speaker and would be an effective and charismatic candidate. He is also good on our issues.”Mr. Cain, 65, declined to be interviewed for this article. He does not hide his experience at the restaurant group — it is mentioned on his Web site — but on the campaign trail he emphasizes his earlier stint running Godfather’s, although he has not run a major corporation for more than a decade.In many ways, his advocacy of a special interest fits with his free-market, anti-Washington themes. Colleagues from the restaurant association remember him as an energetic leader and a fierce foe of any initiative that he saw as a government intrusion into the private sector.He was at first reluctant to give up his perch as a corporate executive to run a trade group. But Thomas A. Kershaw, a Boston restaurateur and owner of Cheers, the bar that inspired the television show, said the chance to work in the nation’s capital seemed to hold allure.“I think what was enticing to him was coming to Washington and getting into the middle of the whole political arena,” Mr. Kershaw said. “I think he had his eye on politics.”Mr. Cain burst into the spotlight in 1994, two years before he joined the trade group full time, while still running Godfather’s. As the association’s unpaid chairman, he sparred with President Bill Clinton during a nationally televised town-hall-style meeting on health care. Mr. Cain insisted that the Clinton plan would cost jobs, asking, “If I’m forced to do this, what will I tell those people whose jobs I’m forced to eliminate?”Their polite, if pointed, back and forth — Mr. Clinton pushed back with calculations that Mr. Cain declared “incorrect” — made the pizza executive a minor celebrity and sent the White House scrambling to respond.“That was a very seminal moment for Herman,” said Stephen J. Caldeira, who later ran the association’s communications operation under Mr. Cain. “I think that was when he got the political bug.”http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/us/politics/herman-cain-running-as-outsider-came-to-washington-as-lobbyist.html  more 


Resolved Question: Once you have that home, can you refuse to sell it ?
Once you have that home, can you refuse to sell it to the government,To my understanding freedom is a state of being where an individual does not have to get permission in order to do something that harms no one else&apos;s person or property.Once you have that home, can you refuse to sell it to the government if they want to use your land for some other purpose? Can you make them go away by simply saying,&quot;I will not sell you my property, at any price?&quot;If you are not free to choose if, when, how, to whom, and for how much you will sell your property, you are not freeAre you free to say to the government,&quot;I don&apos;t like your retirement plan; therefore, I will no longer pay for it&quot;? Can you, without penalty, tell the government that you will no longer pay for subsidies, for regulations, for wars, for empire, or for any activities that you disapprove? If you are not free to refuse to pay for things that you do not want, you are not free.If the government decides it needs more troops to build and maintain its empire, can you refuse to go if it calls for you? Will they leave you alone if you tell them you will not kill and die for them? Can you simply ignore the draft, without consequences? Can you refused to be a conscripted slave? If you are not free to tell the government,&quot;Hell no, I won&apos;t go!&quot;you are not free.Can you open a business, like a simple barbershop, without government permission? On the other hand, how about a bakery? A diner? A hot dog stand? A gun shop? Can you wire, plumb, or fix TVs or cars without a government license? If you are not free to make a living without getting the government&apos;s permission, you are not free.In addition, once you have government approval to open a restaurant or bar, are you free to decide what people may do within your business? Can you choose whether they may smoke on the premises? Are you free to invite them to light up and enjoy a cigarette, a cigar, or a pipe with their drink, or after their meal? If you are not free to decide what people may or may not do on your property or within your business, you are not free.Are you free to smoke a joint? Can you undergo any medical treatment you think is in your best interest? Can you choose whatever drug you deem appropriate for your condition? If you are not free to pursue any treatment or use any substance you think might help you obtain, regain, or retain your health, you are not free.You must sell your property to the government if they want it, and you must kill and die for them if they tell you to. In addition, you have no choice but to pay for it all anyway, whether you like it or not.likewise, to think, we still think America is a free country. In the immortal words of Johann von Goethe:&quot;None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free  more 


Resolved Question: Is opening thins business a good idea?

Resolved Question: HELP! Is This Case a Bonifide Trade Secret or DMCA Violation?
Hello. I am a 48-year-old Ohio male with clinical depression, chronic fatigue syndrome and severe anti-social disorder. Deemed “disabled” by three doctors but unable to secure Social Security Disability benefits, I dabbled with the idea of becoming an online retailer of replacement parts for household-use breadmakers. Three long years of carefully-documented research ensude, research none before me had ever taken the time to gather. Subsequetly, I opened an online breadmaker parts store, single-handedly reviving a dying industry with eighteen months by supplying decade-old replacement parts formerly unavailable for decades. It was year-five that I decided to expand my horizons so on or about June 10, 2010 I emailed a business merger proposal to eBay members Danny Back and wife Rana Smith-Back (aka heavenlightly aka BreadMachinePartsFinder.com aka BreadMachineFinder.com). My message contained, among other details, an admission of my physical and emotional limitations. Regardless, the Backs verbally accepted my proposal and insisted that I relocate to their hometown of Huntsville, Alabama as soon as possible. On or about July 12, 2010 I sold what little belongings I had and chartered a Greyhound bus to Hunstville. Once I met with the Backs at a local restaurant to revisit our goals, with the mutual anticipation of acting on them the very next day. The next day came, and nothing. The next week came and still we had accomplished nothing. It seemed Danny needed to share his life story, a long dull tale that included rants of government conspiracies and the hypothalamus being the source of all illness. ??? Emotionally exhausted from the seemingly endless chatter and stalling, I finally snapped. Snapped? That’s putting it mildly. Better said: I had an emotional episode of stupenous proportions. Nervous breakdown. Wigged out. Flipped. Penniless and wandering about the city at night, the only sane act I could conjure up was to call a relative to purchase me a bus ticket back to Ohio. Within days of my return I emailed the Backs to inform them that the deal was off, insisting they refrain from using any of the research that I had shared with them during my short stay. Within weeks I could see from visits to their internet site that they were not willing to comply with my wishes. I then emailed a legal document demanding that they cease and desist from the same. In both counts they confirmed having received my emails, arguing they had every right to continue using my research for personal gain. Looking back on this debacle I am left only to conclude the entire ordeal an evil plan to steal my trade secrets. If anyone would like to offer his or her’s advice on how I should pursue this matter, I’m listening. In fact, leave any comment you like for I’d really like to know your opinion regarding this matter. And feel free to call my voicemail at 419-581-5977. Thank you. Troy  more 


Resolved Question: How can I get into photography as a business?
Here&apos;s the deal...art in all forms is who I am. I wanted to do it as a career...but after many reality checks I&apos;ve learned a lot about financial hardship. I decided to go to school for a degree I can always use so I&apos;m going for medical admin...something that is generally useful. I have had every intention on taking time to learn about photography while I get my 2 year and have a more stable job, I work in a restaurant right now only job I&apos;ve ever had. Have to have money to really invest in photography. I would have gone to school for it but the only school around with the program cost 88,000 for the degree. Should I see about free internships or shadowing? Or even pay a photographer for their time? I&apos;m generally pretty good with a lot of it...I have used adobe in high school and I understand many of the editing concepts. I know how to use slr cameras I&apos;ve just yet to have the money for one. My goal would be to have a small studio in my home and work like that. I have no intentions of this happening over night, I plan on offering free photography until I&apos;m good enough to charge a small amount and raise my prices like so...I&apos;m not looking to make tons of money any time soon my any means, let that be clear. Any advice out there from photographers that learned the way I want tO learn??? I&apos;d love to talk to a photographer one on one, thanks!  more

Resolved Question: Could someone please check my essay, plz?
Hi, I am posting one of my draft essays for MBA admission. English is my second language, Please check for the errors and let me know the modifications required. Please help me.Topic3. What are your three most substantial accomplishments, and why do you view them as such?&quot;I know where I&apos;m going and I know the truth and I don&apos;t have to be what you want me to be. I&apos;m free to be what I want.&quot;–Muhammad Ali I think this quote is the best way to show me who I am create my own future by challenging and achievement. I tattooed this saying on my heart, and my three major achievements also maded from this belief.Coast to Coast Trip across U.S.A.Even I have traveled a lot of places, the most memorable experience is the road trip across U.S.A. Since I worked in California as my internship program during the semester, I had to go back to New York to continue my studies. Of course, there were many ways to back to N.Y., by plane, train, bus, or car. Then I thought, “Where am I, now? America! America is the home of road trip by car!” Although my friends worried about me, I made up my mind without slightest hesitation to see the country from coast to coast, from L.A. to N.Y. Even I traveled alone more than for 30 days, I didn’t lonely at all because I met various people and saw many things which made me understand more deeply for other people and the world. Specially, while I drove over 10,000km, sometimes I lost the way in the dark and had to make a detour. However, a map showed me where I was, and the belief that I would get to the destination safely made me back on the track soon. This experience taught me that if I know where I am now, and where I’m going for the future exactly, I don’t need to worry about no matter what other people think and say about me.Cooking at the most expensive restaurant in the world After I worked at a few restaurants, I decided to work at the Michelin 3 starred restaurants which there were only 3 among more than 20,000 restaurants in Manhattan, N.Y., and only 81 in the world. Then I set a goal to join the top restaurant of them and the most expensive restaurant in the world at the same time. To get an opportunity to join that kitchen, I had to work form 6 am to 1 am 24/7 for weeks for free. During this time, they checked my talent, passion for the food, and needless to say, the sharp knife skill. After I became a member of the restaurant, I was very sure I made the right choice. Even the working was tough, it was worth to challenge. Since then I always remember what Chef Daniel Boulud said,&quot;If you want to be a great chef, work for the best chefs in the world.&quot;, and the best way to predict the future may be to challenge the future and create the future by taking actions.Launching the Chef’s uniform businessMy international experiences have taught me a lot about the effect of diversity in business and society, and made me enthusiastic about planning many kind of business. Based on career and knowledge in the restaurant business, I help my friend to launching the chefs’ uniform company. I worked on the project for him to acquire exclusive rights to distribute “XXXX” product from U.S.A. In this process, I received lots of help from the uniform supplier with who I deal in U.S.A. This was the great opportunity to know how global network on the business is important. Also, I realize that for expanding a future business in international market, I have to make a true international network and diversity.  more 


Resolved Question: Let&apos;s see if we can get some agreement: planning for retirement in America.?
I want to see if we can at least get agreement on some basic retirement planning advice. I&apos;m going to list some basic guidelines for retirement planning and see if we can at least get some agreement on this. Rules on planning for retirement 1. Learn to get by with less: If you&apos;re the sort of person who is addicted to Big Box store sales and going out to eat at all those mid-level chain restaurants; always having the latest cell-phone; picking up on that new Internet subscription service, etc. then you&apos;ll never be able to retire. If you ever expect to have anything in this economy you have to come to the realization that the majority of goods and services available to consumers nowadays are pathetic garbage that really wouldn&apos;t be worth having even if they were offered to you for free. Save your money. Buy second-hand or vintage goods wherever possible. Aside from your food, underwear, t-shirts and socks there is really very little that you have to buy new. 2. Get an education: the differential in income levels between those with and without a college education is growing. High-school graduates in this country typically earn less than $12 an hour (2011 dollars) for most of their lifetime, and many reach retirement age with nothing more than Social Security checks to retire on. 3. Compare interest rates: many Americans get caught in the trap of putting money into retirement accounts when they have outstanding debt at interest rates higher than they&apos;re earning in their retirement accounts. Paying off high interest debt is better for you in the long run than putting money into low-interest investment accounts. 4. Plan on retiring - sort of: few Americans will ever be able to retire completely. With many American main-streets being loaded with empty store-fronts many retirees may want to look into starting small businesses: such as small independent specialty shops to help them maintain some sort of income. Your business doesn&apos;t have to be in its own storefront. Develop a business plan that will leverage the professional skills you&apos;ve built up over your lifetime and plan on having a second career as a freelancer well into your retirement years. That&apos;s just four basic guidelines. Can we all at least agree on these guidelines?Where are the conservative comments? I get three inane comments from three useless jack-wads and where are the rest of you? Taking notes?  more

Resolved Question: What would you do about my cm-law husband and his&quot;friendship&quot;with an older woman next door?
This woman is in her early 60&apos;s, walks with a walker, and is very clingy-acting. She just lost her husband to cancer back in March, and has just moved in right across from us at an apartment complex.(Literally, across the sidewalk) My husband originally helped her move-in, when he saw her struggling with some boxes. Now, this woman has TOTALLY invaded our space and privacy. We&apos;ll be trying to be intimate, or even watching a movie, and she&apos;ll call his cell phone first, THEN will call our house phone and ask him to go over there to help her. OR, she&apos;ll call him up and demand that he goes and eats dinner with her at a restaurant, because she doesn&apos;t want to be alone. He&apos;ll jump up, and help her with anything, even though he tells me he doesn&apos;t want to go. He feels sorry for her, but it is getting to me. They picked me up from school the other day, and I had to go to a doctor&apos;s appointment, which is a very private thing, and SHE was there, and she even asked me what kind of doctor I was going to. I think it was none-of-her-business, but thanks to my husband, he has filled her in on my health problems, and the fact that I used to be addicted to pain killers, and that is the reason why I see a doctor. He has told her EVERYTHING about us, what our schedule is, and so on. Last night, me, my husband and brother-in-law were going to go ride bikes, then go drink some beers, and go swimming, and she acted sort of mad that my husband had made plans with her. She came out of her apartment, got in her truck, and PEELED OUT practically in our faces. I feel like this whole situation is bullsh*t, and there is nothing I can do about it, because he tells her everything! What do ya&apos;ll think?OH, I have an update: My husband has told the woman already several times that we are busy and that we can&apos;t be going over there all the time. This woman has called his cell phone about 18 times since. She calls for everything. She called yesterday morning to ask him to go over and drink coffee with her, she called yesterday afternoon, evening (about 3 times) and now, this MORNING again, and wanted to know what we were doing. My husband told her we were going out of town for the weekend and we were busy. She IMPLIED that she wanted to go out of town with us! I don&apos;t know what to do.UPDATE:He just told me that he doesn&apos;t care what I think about his friendship with her--that he is going to continue being her agent (he went ahead and sold her an insurance policy) and she is trying to give him a free refridgerator from her storage unit (we need the $$). He also told me that I can&apos;t stop him from being friends with her, and that I need to mind my own business. I am very, very hurt! He stomped out of the house this morning when I caught him on the phone with her this morning.  more

Resolved Question: what is wrong with starting a business in a church?
I went to college for a 24 credit certificate in baking back in 2002-03. While doing this, I worked at an in store bakery part time for less than $6 per hour. The last few months after I graduated before going to my present 40 hour job, I think it was exactly $6 per hour, but only 35 hours a week, no benefits.Where I have been since 2/04 I started as a Baker I making $7 per hour. After 6 months, I was eligible for $7.50 per hour as a Baker I or $8 per hour as a Baker II. It takes a full year to be eligible for benefits, vacation, sick days, paid holidays, etc. One can also become a Baker III for $9 per hour. I think if are half decent, you become a Baker II automatically if you haven&apos;t already. Baker II maxes out at $9 per hour after 2 years of service. I know a person who should have been promoted to Baker III at least 3 years ago but wasn&apos;t. Baker III maxed out at $10 per hour after 3 years of service, 2 of which have to be at Baker III level. The wage scale has been exactly the same since I was hired in 2004. I&apos;m a Baker III maxed out at $10 per hour. I am the foreman of the cookie department. That is a $50 a week stipend. I have to work 40 hours to get the stipend. If I take a sick day, I lose that week&apos;s stipend. If we have a holiday, and I take off, like Christmas Day, I lose the stipend. We are given as much as 2 sick days, 1 personal day and the paid holidays are New Year&apos;s, July 4, Thanksgiving and Christmas. For the first time since I was hired, in 2011 the top of scale for Baker III is going to $10.25 per hour for those with over 5 years at Baker III level. I just made it!A few days ago, I came into a bit of luck. My parents bought 2,500 shares of Ford for about $1.50 two years ago. They gave me 500 shares. I have about $2,000 left on my student loan. I have about $1,000 in credit card debt. I don&apos;t own a car. Part of the credit card debt is the $300 Schwinn bike I own. I plan to pay off my debts next week. I sold 400 shares Friday for $16.80. It was worth $15.95 when it was given to me. I have about $3,500 to start my little project. The oven will set me bake about $1,100. It plugs in to a 208 volt line. The mixer is about $400. I am giving my church (not my parents church) a $450 Energy Star refrigerator as a gift for them letting me use their kitchen to start my business. They have a very basic electric range and refrigerator, but plenty of space.My pastor says he used to&quot;lend&quot;the kitchen out for a $10 per hour&quot;donation&quot;several years ago, but will allow me 45 hours for free to get started.

I decided for us to have lunch at a restaurant on campus since we both had class afterward. She mentions she has friends attending a free lunch at some business event nearby, but when I ask her if she wants to go to that she says&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t care.&quot;At first, things are bad. When we sit down, two of her friends are eating right behind us and she chats with them for just one minute real quick before focusing her attention back on me. This isn&apos;t good: she can easily turn around to join her friends if things seem to be going south. She&apos;s Chinese and has no idea what to eat (no rice). It&apos;s bad: little eye contact (her eyes are quickly scanning the room a lot), playing with her food, stilted convo, etc.I try to save myself through non-class related discussion (funny childhood stories proved to be popular) and soon enough, she&apos;s laughing, smiling, keeping eye contact much more, volunteering info about herself, leaning forward, etc. She doesn&apos;t talk to her nearby friends at all, though one stares at us for a bit.She pulls her phone after an hour, but just sets it on the table, not checking it. I sneak a peek at mine, which causes her to ask the time and she asks if we can go to the free business event. So we go, but just stand outside the building. She calls one friend, she&apos;s not there. She calls another, a guy, and he comes out to chat for like a minute. Mostly in Chinese, only English is when she introduces me (&quot;I met him at the party&quot;) and when he talks to me real quick. He leaves quickly, making the meeting almost pointless.I ask for her weekend plans, has none. I say we should get together this weekend, she agrees. She says she needs to call a friend since she&apos;s meeting her on either Saturday or Sunday night, forgot when. We agree to meet on the day she&apos;s not meeting her friend. She also asks about my Friday class schedule out of nowhere, though nothing is set up. I tell her I&apos;ll call her about the weekend, she says she&apos;ll just text message me which day is good after she calls her friend later on tonight.So, did I do good or not?  more 


Resolved Question: Serious Responses Please from business savvy individuals:?
I own a small company that sells snowballs/hawaiian shaved ice. I completed an application to participate in a street festival and my company was accepted. This is great!! However, after viewing the festivals website I found that 2 other companies that sell the same product as myself were also accepted and will be at the festival. I am discouraged now because the two companies are more established than my business. I know for a fact these two companies will be selling the shaved ice out of their company trucks but I do not have one yet and I will simply be putting a tent with nice decorations. My question is, how do I overcome the other companies being more established? I feel as though because they have mobile trucks and are better known customers will flock to them. I thought about doing give-a-ways and I plan on using pretty cups for the hawaiian ice. What other suggestions do you all have?? The festival is was attended by more than 3lk last year. I thought maybe I could do a $50 give-a-way to a local restaurant. Would this make you buy from me as oppose to the competition? My only one up on them is that I already know what they both sell but because my company is new and just branching out they don&apos;t know what I sell and I am sure they will be surprise to see another vendor that is selling the same product. So my strategy is even though I am the new kid I could possibly win customers with some type of free giveaways...Please, Please, give me all of your suggetions.  more 


Resolved Question: is my boss being unreasonable or is this normal?

Resolved Question: I&apos;m wondering if it looks like my friend has strong enough ties to get a V-2 Tourist visa to the united states?
I have a friend from the Philippines that wants to come to the united states with a V-2 tourist visa for her vacation before she accepts her job offers back home. The plan is she will stay at my home for a few weeks and i&apos;ll tour here around Texas and Oklahoma to see the canyons , and lakes and pretty much get the entire united states culture going on. She did the same for me in the Philippines when i went to that country.  Right now the only thing we have to go by to show the consul is. Shes a 21 year old girl , with around 1k- 1500 in u.s. currency which she just inserted into a bank account she created very recently maybe a week ago , she just graduated from a 4 year college with a business administration degree, and received a job offer from her brother to be a manager in one of his well known restaurants which is a great tourist attraction. Right now shes supported by her mom and step dad and lives with them and her brother and sister also help out there mom. She is very close to her family and her brother and sister lives near by.She currently isn&apos;t holding a job.  Does this sound like strong enough ties to get her a 20 - 30 day visa . I was planning on writing her and notarizing a letter of invitation, and the amount of money she has is perfect because she staying at my home and i&apos;m not going to charge room and board because when i visited her and her family they let me stay in there guest room free of charge.Also she this would be the first time she left her countryAlso my mistake it is a B-2 Visa  more

Resolved Question: If you got good advice and are good about reading people&amp;relationships, I need help asap!?
LOL....I know its lengthy, but please read....Thanks!!Im male in my late 20&apos;s. A little while back, I had this very beautiful girl contact me in regards to possibly doing business together. I was immediately attracted to her. She is in her mid 20&apos;s and was everything I was looking for. I asked her out on a date and she said yes she would be interested. Well as a few weeks and months pass, we become friends. We talk with each other every day and night, sometimes for hours. However, I was never given a chance to take her out on a date in two months of being friends.She was subleasing an apartment, and was kicked out. She asked if her and her younger brother could stay with me for the night so she could go to work for the evening and then would figure things out the following day. Well unfortunately, that night she was fired from her job. One night turned into 8 weeks of her and her brother living with me in my one bedroom apartment. I started of with me sleeping on the couch and I gave her my bed. As days and weeks started to progress, we started sleeping in the same bed and kissing as well as deciding to be in a relationship together. She said she told her parents about me. Things were great for the first month but only had sex twice in that time and then she states that she wants to take things slow and hold off on sex. I was caring/understanding&amp;agreed. As weeks started to go by, i started getting unhappy. This girl who is supposed to be my gf, isnt having sex with me, doesnt ever say i love you or i care about you, rarely initiates kissing/hugging on her own, and has become somewhat distant. She seems to always go somewhere or have something to do (with no job or money) when I would be around as if she was avoiding me. I felt weird and unhappy as I love this girl very much. We have a lot in common. I started to feel like I was being used. I was allowing her and her brother to live rent free for 2 months before I couldnt take it anymore. I was giving her gas money, buying all her cigarettes, redbulls, all the food for her and her brother, loaning her money, cooking for them, using my belongings, etc. There was basically nothing I wouldnt do or wasnt doing. Never once did they say thank you or help to clean up. Never once did she offer to pay. Anytime she needed something or wanted to do something, she went to her brother and not me. She never included me in anything. Examples:- When she had an errand, she would always ask her brother go but not me.- I have a pool table at my apt complex, she would ask her brother to go play but never me- She needed to take some photos for modeling and wouldnt let me do it or even be around, she had her brother do it.- If I ever asked her to go do something she would always give a reason for not doing it.- anytime she would talk about her plans for this summer, it was always what her and her brother were going to be doing, never was I mentioned in any plans or ever asked.I have known this girl for 5 months either as friends or as bf/gf, as of yet, never once has she ever let me take her out anywhere on a date. We have never been to a movie, on a trip, to a restaurant, etcWhen I confronted her on my feelings she just turned it around to make me feel bad and said I was just throwing it in her face everything I have done.When I kicked them out, a week later, she writes me an email saying that she had cancer, leukemia to be exact, and that was the reason for her frequent periods (This was also another reason besides taking it slow for not having sex) and pushing me away. That she owed me this explanation and that she wish she could redo thingsHonestly, I wasnt sure if I was only hearing from her because I have a few of her things which she wont stop asking about. Stupid stuff to, nothing of value and importance. Books, a lamp, etc.Do you think she is being honest about the cancer? OR Was I just being used, lied to, and taken advantage of for a place to stay, money, etc. I dont know what to do. I care for her and love her very much. Should I try to patch things up as I care for her very much? Or walk away as she doesnt care for me and was only using/taking advantage of me?

Resolved Question: How can this be abridged this to about 2/3 length?
I am aware there are certain risks, which are of a significant importance to opening The Cinnamon Stick cafe. The main risk is that I am not skilled in opening up a new enterprise and have never embarked on such a project before. It is known that the majority of any entrepenurial ventures fail. This could result in my business failing to survive. One of the factors which contribute to the failing of a business is due to self-employed people not having previous experience in engaging in an occupation of being an entrepeneur. Some () is that I may have competition or complacency. Competition would normally occur with other restaurants or cafes nearby with a more significant degree if they are to sell the same foods which are consumed by customers. The problem in this context is that my cafe is an international cafe selling foods and drinks of cuisines from around the world. This would mean that it is likely to be nearby restaurants or cafes with the same foods. To keep ahead of this is such a thing was to occur I would be essential to sustain a competitive advantage. I may need to lower prices of certain foods to maintain a sufficient amount of money. I am however willing to take this risk, provided I will make an effort to learn how my business will survive despite any economic condition.I plan to overcome competitive risks by having: a customer loyalty program, weekly different specials and organic food to differentiate. With having a customer loyalty program as part of the running of my cafe, I believe this would make the public find such a cafe attractive for dining or (). My idea of doing this is to give every customer a card with placing a stamp on the paper inside one of the 10 squares. It does not concern any differences about how much worth the customer has purchased for consumption. there is a tenth square filled in, it is the customers right to have their one forthcoming meal free, with the process restarting after a free meal has been consumed by the customer. It also does not count A way in which I am thinking of preventing hoaxes is to write the date and time beneath the signatures in a row of boxes designated for it. This way when the time the customer has consumed from the cafe, it can be clearly seen weather it is genuine.  more

Resolved Question: How can someone budget a disability check, and how would a spend down affect my medicaid?
I&apos;ve been approved for disability. I know I am getting 16 months back pay, but three and a half months of that time was spent in both a psychiatric hospital, and a group home, so I was told I will only get $30 for those months. I need to know what else I should spend my back pay on that would be responsible? I&apos;m also going to be getting a little under $750 a month and plan to give my mom $250 in rent. I also owe her a little bit of money from the back pay. All I can think of needing is a mattress, a small TV for my room and a CD player. What could be some other things to buy? I also know that I need to save all receipts. Also, I was told I will be getting my first check in a month and my mom will be my payee.My uncle got disability, and he blew all of his back pay without saving any receipts. He bought tattoos on his forearms, he bough whiskey, he bought junk cars and other things that are wasteful. He even bought an expensive DVD player. I told him I had an extra one I would give him for free but he felt the need to buy an expensive one. My uncle also used his EBT card for two months after getting his checks. He lost his medicaid, and only has medicare now, and spend downs I guess. He is a prime example of what I don&apos;t want to do with my money. I don&apos;t care for alcohol, so I won&apos;t be buying needless things like he does.My question is; how do I budget my money each month? What would be useful to buy with my back pay that would not look tacky? Also, I am going to a cooking school that pell grant money will pay for. But I&apos;d like to know what would be a good thing to volunteer for? Thank you for any information if you have been through this before.Would it look tacky to spend some of my money going to a theme park? And would it look tacky using some of my money to go to a nice Brazilian restaurant? The place costs $20 each and I wanted to take my mom to it, and maybe take a woman from the Internet out to eat.I also mentioned to some people at a mental health clinic this morning that I got my disability approved my first time applying. A guy started using the&quot;f&quot;bomb, and said he has been trying to get it for four years and still hasn&apos;t got it. I guess I should not mention my business to people like that.  more

He got drunk one day, and decided to go give me a hard time. I was minding my own business in my room, he comes in and goes&quot;we have to talk&quot;so i had no choice but to listen. He said i needed to stay home and eat his cooking. and i told him im a busy person, i can show him my schedule, but he didnt want to see it. instead he threatened me saying i need to stop back talking him and stop being so stubborn.

Resolved Question: Financial Mini Case...........?
Assume you have just been hired as business manager of PizzaPalace, a pizza restaurant located adjacent to camps. The company‘s EBIT WAS $500,000 last year, and since the university’s enrollment is capped, EBIT is expected to remain constant ( in real terms) over time. Since no expansion capital will be required, PizzaPalace plans to pay out all earnings as dividends. The management group owns about 50 percent of the stock, and the stock is traded in the over-the-counter market.The firm is currently financed with all equity; it has 100,000 shares outstanding; and P0= $ 25 per share. When you took your corporate finance course, your instructor stated that most firms’ owners would be financially better off if the firms used some debt. When you suggested this to y our new boss, he encouraged you to pursue the idea. As a first step, assume that you obtained from the firm’s investment banker the following estimated costs of debt for the firm at different capital structures:Percent Financed with Debit, WdRd0%-208.0%308.54010.05012.0If the company were to recapitalize, debt would be issued, and the funds received would be used to repurchase stock. PizzaPalace is in the 40 percent state-plus-federal corporate tax braket, its beta is 1.0, the risk-free is 6 percent, and the market risk premium is 6 percent.a.Provide a brief overview of capital structure effects. Be sure to identify the ways in which capital structure can affect the weighted average cost of capital and free cash flows.b.(1) What is business risk? What factors influence a firm’s business risk?(2) What is operating leverage, and how does it affect a firm’s business risk? Show the operating breakeven point if a company has fixed costs of $200, a sales price of $ 15, and variable costs of $10.c.Now, to develop an example that can be presented to PizzaPalace’s management to illustrate the effects of financial leverage, consider two hypothetical firms: Firm U, which uses no debt financing, and Firm L, Which uses $10,000 of 12 percent debt. Both firms have $20,000 in assets, a 40 percent tax rate, and an expected EBIT of $3,000.(1)Construct partial income statements, which start with EBIT, for the two firms. (2)Now calculate ROE for both firms.(3)What does this example illustrate about the impact of financial leverage on ROE?d.Explain the difference between financial risk and business risk.e.Now consider the fact that EBIT is not known with certainty, but rather has the following probability distribution:Economic StateProbabilityEBITBad0.25$2,000Average0.503,000Good0.254,000Redo the part a analysis for Firms U and L, but add basic earnings power (BEP), return on invested capital (ROIC, defined as NOPAT/Capital = EBIT (1 – T)/TA for this company), and the times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio to the outcome measures. Find the values for each firm in each state of the economy, and then calculate the expected values. Finally, calculate the standard deviations. f.What does capital structure theory attempt to do? What lessons can be learned from capital structure theory? Be sure to address the MM models.g.With the above points in mind, now consider the optimal capital structure for PizzaPalace.(1)For each capital structure under consideration, calculate the levered beta, the cost of equity, and the WACC.(2)Now calculate the corporate value, the value of the debt that will be issued, and the resulting market value of equity.(3)Calculate the resulting price per share, the number of shares repurchased, and the remaining shares.h.Considering only the capital structure under analysis, what is PizzaPalace’s optimal capital structure?i.What other factors should managers consider when setting the target capital structure?Any one can solve this case Scientifically?Califrich- Thank you match for passing through my question at least? I did all my homework, 21 cases like this. But wondering what people are doing here, it seems that they are having fun only.Good Luck!  more 


Resolved Question: How is this in violation of yahoo&apos;s guidelines?
I answered a question. The question was a single mum who&apos;s kid had just moved out. I said...&quot;Firstly, don&apos;t trust those online things. Most of them are scams, and they aren&apos;t reliable. You need to get your resume updated. There are usually ads in the newspaper for resume writers. Take some courses to make yourself more&quot;employable&quot;, such as bookkeeping, etc. My aunt, who has previously been a stay at home mum, has got a reception job by taking a few courses and looking. Think about your career dreams and what you really want to do. Write lists, think about what you want in a job. You could apply to be a front office receptionist at a fancy hotel, or a cleaning job. You could apply to a supermarket or other retail store, or factory. If you want to stay at home and work from home, or own your own business, to make the transition process to work then here are some options: -You could try telemarketing. You could do that from home. Call up telstra, optus, 3, and various companies, or look on their websites to see if they are currently hiring. -You could also start your own business making cakes, growing flowers and selling them, breeding dogs, making greeting cards, making soup, selling hand-sewn clothes, etc. and sell through a website, outside a store, through friends, etc. -You could also try taxi driving. Depending on your country, you may need a special licence or may not be old enough, but you could always try once you are eligible. My cousin used to drive taxis. A good place to pick up customers is in the city, at airports, hotels, restaurants, train stations and places like that. -If you are interested in skincare/makeup and/or cleaning produces and/or vitamins and health supplements then I suggest you try selling through pro-ma. Pro-ma works through independent distributors, and you get a competitive sales percentage. Unlike tupperware, your percentage increases the more you sell, and they have free training courses and books that you can buy. Here is their website: http://www.pro-masystems.com.au/ This is the income plan: http://www.pro-masystems.com.au/ You can also ask for help from an existing distributor. -If you have some money saved up, you could own a franchise such as dunkin&apos;donuts, subway, wendy&apos;s, mcdonalds, gloria jeans, krispy kreme, etc. However, you may be required to work long hours and would most likely need to be on your feet a lot of the time. -You could also be a freelance artist, website designer, writer, etc. You get to make your own hours, and you can work from home. -You could also get into blogging. I know someone who gets their income by making blogs on various topics such as gardening, legal, makeup, cooking, computers, etc. You can buy articles, and you get paid to have advertisements. Or you can save money and write your own articles. -You could also try doing odd jobs such as moving, cleaning, etc for your neighbours. Or, you could do dog walking. Make fliers and send them all over the neighbourhood. The great thing about dog walking is that you get excercise and fresh air, you can work at your own hours, and you get to spend time with animals. You could try and be a house sitter, a sports coach, or volunteer if you can&apos;t get a job. The great thing about volunteering is that it&apos;s easy to get work, and although you don&apos;t get paid, its something great that you can put on your resume. I hope that you find something. Keep looking, and consider being a sales rep for a pro-ma. I think it would be a good, flexible option, plus you could win an overseas holiday! Keep looking :)&quot;I did appeal, and it didn&apos;t work.  more 


Resolved Question: likewise, to think, we still think America is a free country Are you free to smoke a joint?
To my understanding freedom is a state of being where an individual does not have to get permission in order to do something that harms no one else&apos;s person or property.Once you have that home, can you refuse to sell it to the government if they want to use your land for some other purpose? Can you make them go away by simply saying,&quot;I will not sell you my property, at any price?&quot;If you are not free to choose if, when, how, to whom, and for how much you will sell your property, you are not freeAre you free to say to the government,&quot;I don&apos;t like your retirement plan; therefore, I will no longer pay for it&quot;? Can you, without penalty, tell the government that you will no longer pay for subsidies, for regulations, for wars, for empire, or for any activities that you disapprove? If you are not free to refuse to pay for things that you do not want, you are not free.If the government decides it needs more troops to build and maintain its empire, can you refuse to go if it calls for you? Will they leave you alone if you tell them you will not kill and die for them? Can you simply ignore the draft, without consequences? Can you refused to be a conscripted slave? If you are not free to tell the government,&quot;Hell no, I won&apos;t go!&quot;you are not free.Can you open a business, like a simple barbershop, without government permission? On the other hand, how about a bakery? A diner? A hot dog stand? A gun shop? Can you wire, plumb, or fix TVs or cars without a government license? If you are not free to make a living without getting the government&apos;s permission, you are not free.In addition, once you have government approval to open a restaurant or bar, are you free to decide what people may do within your business? Can you choose whether they may smoke on the premises? Are you free to invite them to light up and enjoy a cigarette, a cigar, or a pipe with their drink, or after their meal? If you are not free to decide what people may or may not do on your property or within your business, you are not free.Are you free to smoke a joint? Can you undergo any medical treatment you think is in your best interest? Can you choose whatever drug you deem appropriate for your condition? If you are not free to pursue any treatment or use any substance you think might help you obtain, regain, or retain your health, you are not free.You must sell your property to the government if they want it, and you must kill and die for them if they tell you to. In addition, you have no choice but to pay for it all anyway, whether you like it or not.likewise, to think, we still think America is a free country. In the immortal words of Johann von Goethe:&quot;None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.&quot;now thats Reality check.  more

Resolved Question: What is the best way about getting a sponsor for a party?
A friend of mine and myself plan to throw a big party this year on July 4th. We are both in college and don&apos;t have a tremendous amount of money for start up costs, etc. Our thoughts for lowering costs was getting sponsors. We plan to have alcohol for about 600 people. We were thinking of targeting a liquor store to give us a discount of some sort, or have a restaurant or company supply some food.How would we go about getting them to give us a discount?, or possibly free stuff? What things would give them incentive to give us a discount???We&apos;ve started a business plan outline type deal and we plan to present that. Anything else though?  more
