Went with a good friend/colleague a few months back and I have to say, given how disappointing other burger places have been (Elevation Burger, Burger 7) I would go back with the husband to get his thoughts.

My friend was trying to be good, so we split the sliders and an order of the gold standard fries. Delicious! The place was a little busy but service was prompt. One of our favorite parts was the soda machine - you can get all manner of sodas. I had grape and orange. My friend had different flavors of Coke.

Very disappointing.  Way overpriced product, way underwhelming quality.

I guess the leasing costs of a Coke Freestyle machine are pretty high, because I can&apos;t quantify why this place can get away with charging so much for such mediocre product.

Complement sandwich time:

Pro:  Fairly convenient location, in a shopping center with a gym and a Whole Foods in it, so there&apos;s always somewhere to park.

Con:  Everything costs way too much.  $9 for a &quot;Cuban burger?&quot;  Add a 12 oz. drink, and my burger and drink with no fries is already up to $12+.  It&apos;s about a 1/3 lb. burger, and despite the fact that I asked for it to be cooked medium, there was no pink in it whatsoever.
Con:  Because they use pre-made patties that have the boot-like shape of a Bubba Burger.  I was disappointed to open up my foil to see the sharp edges of a pre-made patty, with the expected spongy consistency.
Con:  I&apos;m amazed at how difficult it is for some places to center the contents of a burger in between two buns; holding it the wrong way leads to a cartoon-like jettison of patty and fixins from the opposite side.
Con:  Despite the fact that they had nice TVs on the walls, and with Spring Training baseball and the Final Four going on, they still decide to keep the channels on ESPN the Ocho, with bowling and flag football.

Pro:  Coke Freestyle machines are always entertaining to use, and fun to watch those who are completely baffled by them, and end up doing nothing but keep pushing the ice button, overfilling the tray and pissing off the employees.  And they had a Def Leppard album on the wall.

Okay, so this compliment sandwich is like an In-and-Out 4x4.  The thing really is, is that this place is just way too overpriced.  A restaurant could get away with pre-made patties and mediocre product if the cost justified the means.  But BGR doesn&apos;t, and therefore it really soils the review.  Bring all entree costs down 20%, and suddenly, this place goes from 2 stars to 3.

As another review points out, this used to be a Chesapeake Bagel Bakery, which I loved the heck out, and it&apos;s a shame to see it replaced by something like BGR.

I&apos;ve been here 5 or 6 times in the past year. Each time I&apos;ve ordered the veggie burger lunch box combo ($9 with fries and a soda).

While most people have griped about the meat quality, their veggie burger is fantastic. Solid flavor, very filling with brown rice. Even in the dead of winter, I received an incredible slice of tomato on my burger. I remember the tomato quality even from my last visit over the summer, although I never expect a tomato to be red, juicy, and even have flavor in March. Great surprise and shows they pay attention to smaller details. The bun is great, too.

The magical soda machine is a bit odd. I wish they had one on each side of the station, I feel as though I am always in line waiting. The food has always taken at least 10 minutes, sometimes 15, even when the restaurant is fairly empty. I don&apos;t see this as waiting too terrible of a long time. Perhaps fellow Yelpers should visit the McDonalds drive-thru? I&apos;ve always received fresh, hot fries and a toasted bun...I&apos;m willing to wait for more than a few minutes. Neither comes out of a can or can be nuked in a microwave.

I&apos;m accustomed to paying around $6 for a veggie burger and this fits the bill. If I were an omnivore, I&apos;d probably not be inclined to visit and pay upwards of $11-17 for a meal (outside of the lunch deal, or with many add-on$ with a lunch deal). Overall: good, not great.

This burger joint is awesome. My co-worker recommended this place because my boyfriend and I like to try different restaurant especially family owed restaurant. We had Southwestern and The Cuban burger. Both of them were awesome. I did like the Southwestern better. It has a good kick to it. The Cuban burger is exactly like the sandwich but it&apos;s a burger. We had sweet potato fries for side. My girls loved the sliders and fries. We are planning to go back to try the other burgers!!! So go check it out it is worth the price.

The food is better than average, but not fantastic and CERTAINLY not worth the price they charge for a burger and soda. If it were more moderately priced I&apos;d return despite the less than freindly / enthusistic staff. Not sure why, but I got the feeling no-one there really liked there job. The onion rings were OK, a bit burnt but still OK, and they do have the cool new coke machine so thats a plus. Overall I may return if there was a coupon or special but the price in my mind just isn&apos;t justified.

This place is way too expensive for what you&apos;re getting.  Nowhere in my mind is a hamburger and an order of fries meet the value of $15.00 to $20.00 - FOR ONE PERSON!

The fries are good, but, well, they should be.  If you run a burger joint, there is no excuse to serve bad french fries.  It&apos;s potatos cooked in oil, lightly seasoned with salt.  That shouldn&apos;t be hard for any restaurant to do.

The burgers are greasy, and my first time eating there the bun completely crumbled in my hands making the burger impossible to eat.  It was so disappointing.  This was not the burger my mouth was craving.

Months later I gave the place another try.  On my second visit I ordered the Welington which is supposedly some form of masterpiece for a burger.  I&apos;ll admit that my first two bites sent my taste buds into orbit, but then they caught on.  If this burger is such a masterpiece of flavor, why is it the only thing you can taste is the overpowering cheese?  The cheese is so strong that despite all the various ingredients that are on the burger, to and include the burger itself, you won&apos;t taste anything but it.

Then you start to factor in the price again, and realize that BGR is just not worth it.

We&apos;re still waiting for a great burger joint in the Sterling VA area.

Too much grease, too expensive.  The hamburger was dripping with grease.  By the end, the bun was soaked and a compressed greasy mess.  The Vidalia onion rings were also laden with grease.  And how long can you serve Vidalia onion rings, since Vidalia onions are only available for less than a month in April-May.  Bottom line, Angus burger at Mcdonald&apos;s is a better burger and costs about 1/3 of this greasy mess.  (The staff was quite friendly, however.)

Three times in a row and they have gotten the order wrong!  Burgers are actually good if they cook them as you ordered.  Be sure to check your orders.  Drink machine is cool.  Fries are average, but sweet potato fries and onion rings are awesome.  They could do a lot better for a pricey burger joint!

This place is fantastic. The fries here are the best I have ever come across and the burgers themselves are pretty great. The staff is always nice and accommodating.

The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is their burgers are not always as consistently awesome as their fries.

To be honest, BGR has never really thrilled me at all.

1. They are very overpriced. The burgers they sell sound fancy at first, but once you bite into them they aren&apos;t as good as they are made out to be. I would not pay $6.99 for a burger unless it was the best known to mankind. Unfortunately their burgers are no exception to my rule.

2. In addition to high prices and sup par foods, BGR tends to be very stingy on portions. Most burgers, which range anywhere from $7 and upwards are quite small considering the price you are charged. The fries, being $3.00 a portion, should be more plentiful. Drinks are overpriced as well, and cost around $2.00.

3. The entire atmosphere is comprised of high schoolers, at least during the occasions I have dined at BGR. This is only beneficial to individuals whom are still in high school. It just pisses everyone else off. Plus most of the kids are loud and disrespectful. The restaurant borders West Springfield High&apos;s territory, which is unfortunate.

4. They have taken the place of my favorite bagel restaurant, which causes me major disappointment as it used to be such a relaxing atmosphere. Dislike.

To sum it up: Fantastic decor, but unfortunately sub-par burgers. If you are really looking for a fantastic burger place, visit Five Guys.

This was my second visit to a BGR. I gave the one in Old Town in Alexandria two stars about a year ago. Normally I have no intention of returning to a place I gave only two stars, but I thought I&apos;d give them another chance - besides, this was a different BGR location.

I rarely make it to the part of town where this BGR is located, but I was checking out bike shops and had stopped by the next-door Bike Lane when I realized I was hungry.  There&apos;s a handful of restaurants in this strip mall, but for whatever reason, I choose BGR. My experience was fairly unremarkable.

On my first BGR visit, I had the Wellington Burger and regular fries -- this time I chose a standard cheeseburger and regular fries.  There was only a couple other guests in the restaurant, but my order took almost 15 minutes to prepare.  However, what I received was very fresh -- even the fries were very crisp.  I usually go light on cheeseburger toppings -- only cheese and onions -- and my burger was fine, but unremarkable.  I don&apos;t know how BGR creates their burgers, but the beef patty is very uniform, which makes it seem like it came from Sysco. The onions were nice slices and the cheese was an OK cheddar.  It was juicy (greasy?) and tasted fine.  However,  it didn&apos;t taste $8.00 good!  Way too expensive for an unremarkable burger.

The fries are served in Five Guys quantity -- meaning you get an enormous pile of them.  Mine were very fresh, medium-thickness, crisp, and golden brown.  They were quite good.  However, an order is about $3.00 (if my memory serves me).  I wish they would serve a more appropriate quantity (i.e., less) and charge less.

As I mentioned in my first BGR review, they really like pushing their mayo-based &quot;Mojo&quot; sauce.  In my opinion, mayonaise is the most vile substance ever created.  I don&apos;t even see it as food!  If you also avoid mayo, you need to make that clear when you order, because they will by default spread their Mojo crap on your burger and serve little tubs of the crap for your fries.  (I apologize if my rant about mayonaise offends anyone!)

To sum up, BGR serves unremarkable burgers and above-average fries -- but they aren&apos;t good enough to justify the high price.

Oh BGR!  How I wish you could provide me the experience of beef satisfaction.  After two visits the regular burger and Wellington (Roasted mushrooms, caramelized onions, garlic with a touch of mustard seed and blue cheese) only satisfied my body.

I need a burger to satisfy my mind, body, and soul and not necessarily in that order.  Perhaps the Greek burger (fresh ground leg of lamb, seasoned with cumin, mint and garlic. Topped with tzatziki sauce and feta cheese. Served on a fresh, buttery-toasted brioche bun) is the one.  Until next time we meet BGR...

I don&apos;t get this place. It&apos;s not a joint, nor it is a restaurant.

Fast food counter, but with long wait in a quite intricate rock- star memorabilia restaurant atmosphere.

Restaurant- quality menu (sous vide, brioche, gorgonzola, serrano and other fancy words), with food, barely passing &quot;edible&quot; bar (shakes are tooth achingly sweet).

Totally ridiculously humongous portions (who wants to eat a bucket of sweet potato fries for additional 4 bucks?), with equally ridiculous prices... Halve the portions, slash the prices, geez.

So what that they offer Grey Poupon mustard instead of your usual yellow stuff. Not worth coming back. Great potential- alas, poor execution.

Student Lunch Special $7

Show your student ID and you&apos;re good to go. The special includes a burger, fries, and a soda. If you want cheese with your burger it&apos;s 99 cents extra.

I was impressed with the size and quality of the burger and fries. It wasn&apos;t the best burger I&apos;ve ever tasted, but for $7 I was a happy camper. The soda machine is the coolest (see pics). You&apos;ve got so many options to choose from. The Peach Fanta is my FAVE.

The Student Lunch Special is a great deal. Without the special, a regular burger (no cheese) is $7 and Fries are $3. They also offer specialty burgers such as The Cuban, The Greek, Lobster, and Tuna.

If you don&apos;t have a student ID, they also offer a Daily Lunch Special for $9. It&apos;s only available from Monday-Friday (11:00 am- 2:00 pm).

{Note} There is a 16 pound burger for $80. If you can finish it, it&apos;s free :P

Bottom line - it&apos;s not THAT bad.

BGR won&apos;t be taking down any of the other popular burger joints in town, i think its a lil better than some of the reviews. The service is always good. My burgers have always been solid and I like their sliders.  The fries are a bit inconsistent, but usually solid as well.

That&apos;s my overall feeling on the place.  Solid, but not great.

I won&apos;t go on and on about how expensive the place is, but I can&apos;t help but feel that dropping the prices here would help.

The burgers, while not bad, just aren&apos;t good enough to support the prices.  Having a five guys so close doesn&apos;t help the matter.  If you are willing to drive a bit further, there are definitely better options for the price like Ray&apos;s and, if you can find it, Quarry House.

So, BGR isn&apos;t bad, its just not quite good enough to support its prices.

Every time I&apos;ve walked by this BGR its empty - even at 6:00pm last Friday the place was a ghost town.

I finally gave them a shot yesterday for the first time. My burger wasn&apos;t terrible, but it also wasn&apos;t exceptional whatsoever. And (as so many others have noted) BGR is way overpriced.

I think many people would pay 8 or 9 dollars for a great burger. But nobody should pay 8 or 9 dollars for this one.

I am torn on this place - swarming with children, impossible to find a seat, but good servings, an interesting atmosphere with walls covered in movie and music posters, and tables with fun mosaics.

Let&apos;s not forget to mention the highlight of this place which gets everyone talking - their soda MACHINE. A giant touch screen juke-box sorta thing for you to choose from an endless list of your favorite sodas!

So, the food? My burger was pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. Would I have liked to pay $11 for it? Um, no. The guac wasn&apos;t great and the tortilla strips were stale. The fries? Pretty standard. And my Thin Mint Shake? Eh...I wish I could have cookie pieces in it. All of that was $20 for one person. No...No.

Next time I am dying for a decent burger close by and want to dish an absurd amount for it (they have a 15 lb burger for $80!!), perhaps I shall return. They do have some delicious and interesting sounding burgers here.

I had their Veggie burger and fries. With all of the available fresh toppings and their sauce.

The veggie burger was delicious, the bun was buttered and toasted, the toppings were done right (not overdone) and the patty itself was moist and full of flavor. It doesn&apos;t hold together well and I did have to finish it with a fork and knife.

Their fries were nothing special, except that there were a lot of them.

Would I come back here again? Good veggie burgers are hard to come by, so Yes.

Thank you GROUPON!    I would honestly not pay $6.99 for this burger.     This was our first time and our last time.   Five Guys burgers have more taste.   For a nice establishment, with pricey burgers, I&apos;m surprised the only way to get mayo on your burger is to open tiny packets.  I doubt if those patties were even close to 1/4 lb.

Fries(sweet potato&amp;golden) were good.   The soda machine is a good concept.

All in all, if their burgers had any flavor to them, then this place could survive!

I like it here. I call it &quot;Five Guys When Someone Else is Paying&quot; -- it&apos;s a restaurant you come to if you want a burger that&apos;s a little bit of a treat. Like some of the other commenters have noted, this place is a little pricey, especially for dinner, but for lunch you can nab a delicious regular burger, fries, and a drink, I think, for $8.99. Of course, cheese costs extra, and you should probably be upgrading for onion rings, so eventually you might be shelling out $12.00 or $13.00 for your meal. Agreed, steep for lunch.

But if you can get past the pricing, these burgers are good. Their garlicky mojo sauce, available upon request, really gives the meat a spiky tang; the enormous, nicely-battered onion rings are a perfect complement. The fancy-schmancy digital soda fountain here is also a must-try for refill-lovers like me: how often can you get Lime Coke Zero and Diet Cherry Coke fresh from the fountain at a place other than the Coca-Cola Experience in Atlanta?

The atmosphere is okay; it&apos;s perhaps the biggest draw for me personally. The whole place is done up in a hard rock motif that feels 30 or 40-something (okay, okay, classic rock is ageless); the music&apos;s a little loud for casual conversation amongst family. The restaurant was also a little cold at the tail end of April, but that&apos;s no big deal.

Give it a shot! BGR might not be for you, but I bet if it is, you&apos;re going to be a repeat customer.

I decided to try the award winning burger at BGR. Maybe i expected too much or their burger isnt that GOOD. Overpriced, overrated, and interior seems like no concept at all.

Couple days ago, i went to YumBurgers in Rockville MD. Their burger was much better than BGR. It is just too far away from home.

I have been to the Burger Joint a few times and am usually torn as to whether I like it or not. I saw that there was a Groupon so I decided to give in and give them another shot. I really wish I wouldn&apos;t have.

The Groupon was quite a ripoff. You could get their basic burger for $4 ($6.99 regularly). Here&apos;s the catch, you had to buy the fries (~$3) and drink (~$2) separately when you can typically get their boxed lunch (regular burger, fries, and drink for only $8.99) so all told, I spent the same thing that I usually would. What&apos;s the point in a Groupon then?

When I placed my order, I handed the cashier my Groupon and she rung up everything as I ordered it and then gave me my total, forgetting to include the Groupon. Okay, I get that it might be a little odd but, my boyfriend then did the same thing and she forgot to include the Groupon in his too!

If there is one thing I can say, it&apos;s that they give you a TON of food. The burger is large and they do cook it to your liking, which is nice. The toppings can be quite interesting but cost an arm and a leg if you want to add them on to the basic burger. Their fries are no better than the run of the mill fast food restaurant (a-la Burger King) and certainly not worth a little over $3.

The main redeeming quality of this location is that they have, as other reviewers have noted, a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. I absolutely love this thing. The Cherry Coke is actual regular coke mixed with grenadine so it doesn&apos;t taste artificial at all. There are over 125 flavor combinations and it is just pure awesome. Can you tell I wish that they had them everywhere?

All in all, far overpriced for what it is - a mediocre burger that is nowhere near as good as Five Guys. I&apos;ll keep going there instead.

The Springfield/Burke area is lacking in restaurants... I am grateful for the addition of BGR.

Parking-  no issue/plenty of parking

Menu-      I have only tried the Ahi Tuna Burger.  If you are a tuna burger,
rare, fan... this is a must!  The Ahi Tuna burger is paired with
pineapple, ginger and teriyaki sauce... additional sides ex.
lettuce, tomatoes, etc can be added at no cost.
My hubby has tried the: the Cuban, the Burger, and the
Southwestern.  He admits that the Cuban was his least favorite,
but this has not seemed to hinder his appreciation for BGR.
We have not had any issues with food preparation.  One time an
ordered side was forgotten.  However, when mentioned the
BGR staff quickly supplied the missing side.

Shakes--- delicious

Cost-        Two people eating at BGR will run about $30 or more.  A little
pricey, maybe for burgers... but we still keep coming back.

Atmosphere here has a Chuck E Cheese feel to it. Maybe because there was always some kid screaming at some point in time. It&apos;s hard to enjoy food when there&apos;s a kid screaming or running around this tiny little burger joint. The decor was a bit off. Usually I don&apos;t care about how the establishment decorates the place if the food was good, but the food was not good so I feel more inclined to nag about every little thing.

I ordered the Wellington which is supposedly their main burger and found the meat to be a bit dry (I ordered medium) and suspect the mushrooms to be canned at some point in time. They were unusually mushy with almost the same consistency as the gravy they were drowning in. The fries were kinda nice. I ordered mine with parmesan, rosemary, and garlic (each topping is 49c extra) and was expecting pretty awesome fries. The addition of rosemary and parmesan was nice. Wasn&apos;t a fan of the garlic though. Instead of seasoning the fries with garlic, it was topped with whole gloves of garlic (I suspect it was also preserved). I was hoping the fries to be infused with the flavor of garlic somehow rather than tossed on top like some sort of bonus appetizer. At least they gave you a lot of fries. One order is more than enough for 2 people I&apos;d say.

BGR&apos;s honestly only true redeeming quality was its jukebox soda machine. You have your choice of traditional soft drinks but with the additional option of flavoring. I think it was grape, peach, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, and lime. It was pretty cool. However, I don&apos;t think this machine is enough to merit a second visit if you take into account the mediocre food coupled with the $16.11 price (Wellington burger, fries w/ all the toppings, and a drink).

Expensive, slow, overrated. This place will be out of business once the newness wears off. $17 for a speciality burger and fries?!?  They have a ton of cooks but somehow the food still gets charred.

I ordered the Lamb burger and sweet potato fries which took twice the time of five guys with half the line.  The burger was okay, the fries had lost all flavor from being overcooked.

If West Springfield had better options this place would be crickets. Wait for My Village Chicken to open back up and go there for 1/3 the price.

PS - the bday coupon they sent out is only good for $7 not ANY burger (no fine print clarifying this).  Lamb burger + fries (no drink) still cost me $10.

If your like my Grandfather - allergic to youth and noise - stay the hell away.

BGR feels more like an empty disco than a Restaurant. Not that I&apos;m complaining, It&apos;s just odd. But, when I think about BGR I start salivating. That being said, disappointment knows many names; most notably Old Keene Mill Road. All in all I think its a great burger. Its like Five Guys - Greasy, made to order, and served in an atmosphere that doesn&apos;t really seem to fit. Its tasty, but much like the Transformers Movie, Hype doesn&apos;t equal substance.

That is, unless were talking about the soda machine that brews every Coke product this side of the Mississippi. Seriously, if Steve Jobs made a Coke Machine, its this one!

Its one tasty burger - but at the price range, you&apos;ve got better options.

A couple weeks ago, I wrote about a great burger restaurant in Mclean named Burger 7.  Today, I write about an equally amazing burger chain that recently opened a new location in West Springfield called BGR (aka The Burger Joint).

The original location of BGR is in Arlington, but a few weeks back, a new location opened in West Springfield.  If you&apos;ve never been to either, you need to make it your next burger venture.  BGR takes gourmet burgers to another level.  You can enjoy premade favorites like the ahi tuna burger, the lobster burger, the cuban (which is themed after the sandwich made popular in the Florida area because of its larger Cuban population) or my personal favorite the wellington burger (which features foie gras and truffles among other things on it).  Add to all that delicious gourmet sides and a fairly quick serving time, and you&apos;ve got the hippest hang out spot for diners young and old.

Those of you who have been to the West Springfield site will also note the new soda dispensing machine here that has an electronic touch screen menu in which you choose from a variety of delicious sodas and it dispenses into your cup below.  Best of all, if you get a BGR water bottle the first time you come in, you can bring it back time and time again and refill for free.

De-frickin-licious.

It looked interesting when we were driving by, and had been a long-standing to-do on our list of local eats.

When we went in I really liked the atmostphere.  The 80&apos;s retro styling struck the right chord.

My wife sat in a booth with the kids and asked her to grab her a diet coke.  I went up to the coke machine and was more amused than I should have been by a soda dispenser.  I took her empty cup back to her and had her go up.  It has a touchscreen display where you can add flavoring to standard soda flavors.

The menu was very appealing.  They have combos on the menu that I haven&apos;t seen elsewhere.  I had the Wellington; my wife the Tuna.  Had I read the menu first I&apos;d probably have chosen differently.  Some of the descriptions of other dishes (such as the turkey burger) sounded much better in the standard menu.  Still, we were both very excited about the meal.

The wellington has mushrooms, bleu cheese, and (according to the chalk board but not in the menu) foie gras.  It was a bit sloppy and (as I should have predicted) pretty salty.  I also got fries seasoned with rosemary, which was different, but they were a bit overcooked and without the rosemary, a bit bland.  I should have tried the grilled asparagus instead.  The Tuna was well cooked but sort of bland.

As far as the food goes, it is ambitious but not well executed.  Any place can have an off night.

The biggest knock against the place is the reception by the staff of our family of four, with one infant and one 2 1/2 year old toddler who was understandably enthralled by the shiny decor.  My wife told me after the fact that they were none too friendly with our kids.  they seemed displeased about the two little ones when we were seated, and  when my son sat on the table (while I was away from the table momentarily) the management addresed the issue forcefully and without tact.

Great whimsy in the atmosphere, but low tolerance of whimsy in the clientele.  Hopefully that was also indicative of an off day.

My wife told me about the Boardwalk Burgers that has opened just around the corner.  Before I go back to BGR for one of their truly creative offerings (such as the Cuban burger) I&apos;ll give Boardwalk a try.

We were excited to see BGR open, hoping we&apos;d have another good, fast, and local restaurant option.  Sadly, the soda machine was the highlight, and even that wasn&apos;t all it could have been.

Our burgers were just okay.  My wife had the Wellington and I had the standard bacon cheeseburger.  They weren&apos;t especially flavorful and we found them very small for the price.  We wouldn&apos;t bother with them again.  The fries were okay, but even more over-priced.

The soda machines were cool and had a lot of different flavors, which would have been fun to taste if they actually worked... Most were out and we had relatively few to actually choose from.

We&apos;ve eaten at the Old Town BGR and were a lot happier with their food.  Still a little pricey for what it is, but we felt their burgers were more flavorful.

Been here once...here&apos;s my take.  Short and sweet.

The burger is over priced.  It&apos;s very small for a $10 burger.  The taste was so so.  I rather go to Ruby Tuesday or Fuddrucker&apos;s.

This is a restaurant with an 80s rock and roll theme.  They do one thing well and that is cook incredible burgers.  Start with the basic burger and work your way around the menu as you will want to come back.  Kid friendly too.  Burgers, fries, and drink combo will run you about $10 but the burger is about 5 inches high and 5 inches around.  But it is sooo good.  Better than Five Guys.  This is not fast food so I would not dare compare it to McDs.  With a packed house my wait was about 15 minutes but I had lots to drink (free refills) from a really cool soda machine and watched TV on there many large screen TVs.

I love a good cheeseburger.  Thick, juicy, pink (not red), in the center cheeseburger.  BGR serves a good cheeseburger.  It was cooked exactly as requested, it was served with lettuce and a decent slice of tomato (considering it is December) and a really good roll.  Really good.  No condiments needed good.  Still thinking about it five hours later good.

The fries were well above average and the soda machine was a hoot.

Why only four stars?  The napkins.  Seriously.  What is up with the cocktail-sized napkins?

Not anything super special... but good burger overall.

I got the wellington, Boyfriend got the cubano. Both were &quot;eh&quot; but i could tell that the meat was good quality. I felt like there were too many toppings on the burger, which took away from the &quot;burger experience.&quot; We shared sweet potato fries (asked for a side of honey for dipping) which were delicious. Digital Coke Machine was so cool! It was my first time using one so I was pretty darn excited. So many different flavors!!

Next time we go, i&apos;ll def get an original burger and keep it simple.

Well I will say that I was skeptical after reading a lot of the negative reviews regarding The Burger Joint, but I have been there twice and enjoyed it every time.  Yes it is expensive, but if you want something cheap, then go to McDonald&apos;s and Burger King.  Reading some of the negative comments that were put were simply a matter of personal preference, which is what makes yelp so great.
One thing I really like about this place is that fact that they grill the burgers over a grate, not a griddle, therefore burger does not sit there and cook in it&apos;s own fat.  The only thing I think that would make this better is if they managed to cook them over wood or charcoal.  I had the Wellington and thought it was cooked to perfection, it wasn&apos;t an overly sloppy mess, but what do you really expect when you put foie gras, carmelized onions, and truffles over a burger.  I know for sure McDonald&apos;s doesn&apos;t have those ingredients.  My wife got the Greek Burger which I will also say I have to indulge in half of it and it was phenomenal.  One other thing to note, both times I was there I ordered to go and had about a ten minute drive home, and I still found the food to be excellent.
The fries are extremely good and yes they put seasoned WHOLE garlic cloves with them....  Yum....  Some however may not like that.  I still have yet to try the sweet potato fries.  Enough people wrote about the soda machine and I love it, where else can you go back to the old days of actually getting a real Cherry Vanilla Coke?  Either way to sum it up, I will continue to go here for the food and recommend it to others.  I really feel the burgers are excellent and have not yet had a bad experience there.  I recommend that once you read all the reviews (both positive and negative) really give this place a chance.  Depending what you like and how you like your burgers it totally may not be for you.  But you still have to give it a try, you just may be missing out.

Maybe there&apos;s something wrong with me, but I thought this place made a damn good burger. It was big and juicy, with that delicious char-grilled quality that&apos;s lacking from griddle-cooked burgers at places like Five Guys. The meat was quality, the toppings were fresh, and the fries were great. The Coke Freestyle (&quot;jukebox&quot;) machine, as at Elevation Burger, is a lot of fun.

Then again, I also came here around 6:30 on a weekday, when there were no real crowds, so the speed and service were not a concern.

For my money, I enjoyed it more than Ray&apos;s Hell Burger. Blasphemy, I know, but if I want something that tastes like steak, I&apos;ll just have steak. BGR at least seems to understand the difference between the two.
