 King Of 

The Hill 

 

 

 
 Season 1 
 1. Pilot gs : Gailard Sartain (Anthony&apos;s Supervisor) 
A social worker mistakenly believes that Hank is physically abusing his son.

Hank Hill, his wife, Peggy, and son, Bobby, drive to a Little League 

 baseball game. Along the way, Hank gives his son a pep talk, emphasizing the 

 importance of winning. As the game gets under way, Bobby, who shows little 

 athletic prowess, manages to get on first base. But he becomes distracted 

 when his father offers coaching advice from the bleachers. A ball roars down 

 the first base line and strikes Bobby in the face, leaving him with a black 

 eye. After the game, Bobby accompanies Hank to the local department store. 

 Two older women spot the pair from twenty yards away. Hank throws a temper 

 tantrum when he is unable to find the hardware department, and the elderly 

 women erroneously conclude that Bobby is being abused. Word spreads 

 throughout the community, and eventually, a social worker named Anthony Page 

 is dispatched to investigate the incident.

Page arrives at the Hill home just as Hank erupts in a temper tantrum (after 

 banging his head on the hood of his car). But Peggy assures Page that her 

 husband is as gentle as a lamb. Later, Hank tells the social worker that his 

 son received the black eye during a baseball game. He also emphatically 

 denies ever hitting his son. But Page remains unconvinced, and begins 

 interviewing neighbors and friends of the family, hoping to uncover the&quot;truth.&quot;Hank finally loses his patience and kicks the social worker off his 

 property.

Back at the Child Protective Services Office, the social worker discusses 

 his findings with the case manager. He is later removed from the 

 investigation. Bobby tells Hank that if he continues to lose his temper, the 

 government will take him away. The boy then intercepts a phone call from the 

 Protective Services Office, in which a social worker apologizes for the 

 misunderstanding. Unaware that he is no longer under investigation, Hank 

 heeds Bobby&apos;s warning and attempts to control his temper no matter how much 

 his son misbehaves. Eventually, Peggy learns that the investigation was 

 halted a week earlier and that Bobby deliberately neglected to tell anyone 

 the truth. Later, Hank tells Bobby, in his own unique way, how much he loves 

 him.
  
 b : 12-Jan-1997 pc : 4E01 w : Mike Judge and Greg Daniels d : Wesley Archer   2. Square Peg gs : Mary Scheer (Gracie) 
Peggy is chosen to teach a Sex Ed class.

Bobby returns home from school with a permission slip. Hank explodes with 

 anger when he realizes the school is seeking permission to send his son to a 

 Sex Ed class. He and Peggy agree that&quot;the birds and the bees&quot;should be 

 taught at home. But Hank quickly nominates Peggy, who was recently voted 

 Substitute Teacher of the Year, to do the honors. With great trepidation, 

 Peggy approaches her son and broaches the subject of sex. When Bobby 

 mentions the word&quot;penis,&quot;Peggy goes blank and leaves the room. Left with 

 little choice, Hank decides he will teach his son the same way his own 

 father instructed him: by watching animals mate at a local dairy farm. But 

 Hank is horrified to realize that, through a miracle of modern technology, 

 cows are inseminated by machine. Hank and Peggy have a change of heart and 

 decide the topic is best left in the hands of professionals. But when the 

 high school&apos;s Sex Ed teacher resigns after Hank&apos;s friend Dale phones in an 

 anonymous death threat, Peggy is drafted to teach the class.

Peggy prepares for the job by reading a variety of books on the subject. 

 Word of her new position spreads quickly, and the entire family becomes the 

 target of derogatory remarks. The perceived&quot;dirtiness&quot;of Peggy&apos;s task even 

 affects her love life, as Hank recoils after she suggests they have sex. 

 While preparing for the class, Peggy musters the courage to blurt out the 

 word&quot;vagina.&quot;Fed up, Hank tells his wife he will not sign the permission 

 slip (which requires both parent&apos;s signatures).

Hank takes Bobby to work with him on the day his wife is scheduled to teach 

 the Sex Ed class. While discussing the touchy subject matter with his son, 

 Hank defends Peggy&apos;s use of words describing the human anatomy and suddenly 

 realizes how courageous his wife truly is. He brings Bobby to school and 

 allows him to attend the Sex Ed class. Meanwhile, Peggy, nervous and 

 tentative, enters the classroom and addresses the students.
  
 b : 19-Jan-1997 pc : 4E02 w : Joe Stillman d : Gary McCarver   3. The Order of the Straight Arrow gs : Victor Aaron (John Redcorn) 
Hank and his friends take Bobby&apos;s scout troop on a rite of passage journey 

 in the wilderness.

Hank, Boomhauer, Bill and Dale decide to take Bobby&apos;s scout troop, the Order 

 of the Straight Arrow, into the wilderness in an effort to&quot;make men out of 

 them.&quot;The foursome, who were members of the same scout group when they were 

 children, approach John Redcorn for&quot;Indian stuff&quot;for an initiation 

 ceremony. Redcorn tells them of a ritual involving the sacred Wematanye. The 

 men love the idea and decide they will use it. Later, Hank and his friends 

 load Bobby, Joseph and Randy into their cars and begin the journey. The 

 moment her family leaves, Peggy hops in Hank&apos;s pickup truck and heads out 

 for points unknown. As the journey continues, Hank tires of the boys&apos; 

 incessant talking. He orders a twenty-four hour oath of silence, using Slim 

 Jims as&quot;silence sticks.&quot;Unfortunately, Bobby forgets he is to remain 

 silent throughout the test, and his Slim Jim is nibbled away to almost 

 nothing. Concerned, Hank warns his son that he will not make Straight Arrow 

 if he loses one more bite of Slim Jim.

The group pulls into a campground populated by environmental activists led 

 by a woman named Mona. That night, Hank and his friends gather the boys 

 around a campfire. Hank tells the boys of the spirit Wematanye, and how it 

 respects all of God&apos;s creatures. As a final test, Hank sends the boys out 

 into the wilderness to hunt down the dreaded snipe (a fictitious creature). 

 Taking the assignment very seriously, Bobby accidentally wallops a Whooping 

 Crane, a rare and protected bird on the endangered species list.

Hank hides the animal&apos;s carcass inside a beer cooler. Afterward, Joseph 

 tells Bobby that his father invented the story about the snipe. But Bobby 

 maintains his father is the Arrow leader, and would never lie. In the 

 morning, a park ranger enters the campground. He explains that a Whooping 

 Crane tagged with a transmitter has disappeared. Hank covers as best he can 

 and the ranger leaves the camp. Meanwhile, Peggy meets up with Brock, a 

 handsome Texan...and owner of a shoe store for the&quot;largefooted lady.&quot;Peggy 

 purchases Italian loafers. Back at the camp, Hank assembles the boys and 

 speedily drives towards the park exit. As the ranger closes in, Hank makes a 

 desperate attempt to bury the crane. But before he does, Hank admits to 

 Bobby that he lied about the snipe hunt, explaining it is part of the 

 experience of becoming a scout. Suddenly, the ranger arrives. As he prepares 

 to arrest the group for killing an endangered species, the bird suddenly 

 springs to life. Realizing that the bird was only knocked unconscious, the 

 ranger lets everyone go.
  
 b : 02-Feb-1997 pc : 4E03 w : Cheryl Holliday d : Klay Hall 
NOTE: This episode reveals that Hank has always wanted to be a propane 

 salesman...if his grades were good enough. 4. Hank&apos;s Got the Willies gs : Chuck Mangione (Himself) Willie Nelson (Himself) Dennis Hopper (Himself) 
Bobby attempts to make amends after he accidentally wallops Hank&apos;s idol, 

 Willie Nelson, in the head with a golf club.

Hank catches Bobby furiously windmilling his beloved Guild guitar,&quot;Betsy.&quot;Bobby explains that he was playing the instrument with a piece of cheese, 

 like his favorite comedian, Celery Head. After examining the guitar, Hank 

 realizes his son chipped Betsy&apos;s bridge. The next day, Bobby crashes Hank&apos;s 

 lawn mower into the front of his truck. Shortly thereafter, the boy uses 

 Hank&apos;s pitching wedge to hit clumps of dog excrement. When Hank tells his 

 wife that their son seems bent on destroying everything he owns, Peggy 

 suggests he take Bobby golfing. At first, Hank dismisses the idea outright. 

 But when Bobby tells his father that his two heroes are Gameboy champ Eddie 

 Stillson, and Howard Adderly, the father of bizarre worm-child Jason Adderly, 

 Hank decides he needs to take his son golfing immediately.

Before he takes his son golfing, Hank drives Betsy to a local guitar shop. 

 Along the way, Hank tries to think of a suitable hero for Bobby. Hank tells 

 his son that his own idol has always been Willie Nelson, as he was born in 

 Texas, plays the guitar, and loves to golf. After dropping Betsy off for 

 repairs, Hank joins Dale, Bill and Boomhauer for a game of golf. Bobby pulls 

 his father&apos;s club from a bag and chips a ball right into a cup. Impressed, 

 Hank allows Bobby to tee-off on the next hole. Bobby takes a mighty 

 swing...and lets go of the club, which gracefully tumbles through the air 

 until it strikes another golfer in the head. The foursome rush to the 

 hapless victim&apos;s side, only to discover the man is none other than Hank&apos;s 

 hero, Willie Nelson.

After apologizing for the accident, Hank asks Nelson for his autograph. 

 Nelson takes a pencil in hand, but still suffering from his injury, he 

 slumps forward into the steering wheel of his golf cart, leaving a signature 

 that is nothing more than a straight line. Before Hank has a chance to tell 

 Willie that he is his hero, the singer&apos;s cart picks up speed and races down 

 a hill. Convinced he cost his father the opportunity of a lifetime, Bobby 

 rides his bicycle (with a guitar case strapped to the handlebars) to Willie 

 Nelson&apos;s mansion (now property of the United States Government). He finds 

 Nelson playing Gameboy in a nearby trailer. Bobby phones his father with 

 news that Nelson has invited him to a barbecue party. When Hank arrives, he 

 finds the singer strumming Betsy. Willie flips the guitar around and shows 

 Hank that he autographed the instrument (the signature is identical to the 

 straight line autograph from the golf course). Hank telephones his wife and 

 invites her over to the barbecue. When she arrives, Peggy meets Dennis 

 Hopper, who begins to flirt. Furious at Hank for showing the guitar so much 

 attention, Peggy stomps towards her husband. But she melts when she hears 

 Hank singing a song about how much he loves her.
  
 b : 09-Feb-1997 pc : 4E05 w : Paul Lieberstein d : Pat Shinagawa   5. Luanne&apos;s Saga gs : Chuck Mangione (Himself) Joanna Gleason (Leanne) 
Hank promises to find Luanne a new boyfriend in 48 hours.

When Hank complains about Luanne&apos;s belongings cluttering his den, Luanne 

 assures him that she will soon be living with her boyfriend, Buckley. Later 

 that day, Buckley drives his motorcycle to the Hill residence and picks up 

 Luanne. The couple drives thirty yards away when the bike stops and Luanne 

 gets off. When Luanne returns home, sobbing, it becomes clear she broke up 

 with Buckley. Hank grows concerned when Peggy is unable to&quot;fix&quot;Luanne&apos;s 

 dilemma. Peggy tells her husband it will help if he tells Luanne how pretty 

 she looks. Unfortunately, Hank approaches Luanne after she has been crying. 

 Furious, Luanne snaps at him, screaming that she was dumped by her 

 boyfriend. When Luanne continues crying, Hank convinces her that it is all 

 right to swallow her emotions. He then promises to help her find a new man 

 in 48 hours. When Hank and Luanne begin to bond, Peggy chastises her husband 

 for meddling with a natural process. Hank responds by telling his wife how 

 pretty she looks, and Peggy melts completely.

Hank, Peggy, Luanne, Bill, Boomhauer and Dale drive to Ugly&apos;s Saloon. 

 Determined to keep his word about finding Luanne a boyfriend, and equally 

 determined to keep his wife in the dark about his motives, Hank tells his 

 friends to search the bar for a potential suitor. In an attempt to keep his 

 wife distracted, Hank asks Bill to dance with Peggy. After passing over 

 several men, Hank notices a flash of light emanating from a shiny belt 

 buckle. The wearer of the belt, Wade, an all-American-looking 20-year-old, 

 passes muster with Hank. Shortly thereafter, Hank tells Luanne to introduce 

 herself. Hank and Peggy return home. When Buckley returns looking to patch 

 things up with Luanne, Hank sends him away. Later that night, Luanne returns 

 home with Boomhauer, her new beau. Hank is horrified.

When Hank sees Luanne giving Boomhauer a peck on the cheek, he storms up to 

 the couple. Luanne explains how, the moment Hank left the saloon, Wade 

 turned into&quot;Mr. Grabby Sam.&quot;Hank forbids Luanne from dating Boomhauer, 

 noting that he is her landlord. Out of spite, Luanne counters she will stay 

 at Boomhauer&apos;s home. Despite Boomhauer&apos;s objections, Luanne moves in. 

 Realizing how much Luanne and Hank genuinely like one another, Peggy 

 arranges for the pair to&quot;accidentally&quot;show up at Luby&apos;s restaurant at the 

 same time. Still angered, Hank tells Luanne to stop by the house and pick up 

 her belongings. The next day, when Luanne shows up at the house, she finds 

 her belongings unpacked and spread out neatly in the den. Hank admits how 

 much better he likes the room. Realizing she&apos;s being allowed to stay at the 

 house, Luanne tells Hank how much she loves him.
  
 b : 16-Feb-1997 pc : 4E04 w : Paul Lieberstein d : Pat Shinagawa   6. Hank&apos;s Unmentionable Problem gs : Steven Banks (Dr. Morley) Jim Cummings (C. Everett Koop) 
Hank is greatly embarrassed when word of his irregularity spreads throughout 

 the community.

Peggy notices her husband exit the bathroom without flushing the toilet. 

 Hank assures her it was unnecessary since&quot;nothing happened.&quot;Concerned, 

 Peggy fixes Hank a glass of Megamucil, an all-natural laxative. Being a 

 manly Texan, he refuses to heed her advice and her bran muffins opting for 

 sausages instead. Peggy tells Nancy about her husband&apos;s constipation. Soon 

 after, word spreads throughout the town, and well-wishers stop by the house 

 with tips on how to become regular once again, causing Hank great 

 embarrassment. As time passes, Peggy grows more and more concerned. She 

 tries sneaking melted chocolate laxative onto Hank&apos;s ice cream, but the 

 scheme fails. Peggy experiences a nightmare in which Hank dies from his 

 irregularity. Hysterical, Peggy rushes to her husband and begs him not to 

 die. Moved, Hank promises to see a doctor.

With great embarrassment, Hank keeps his promise. Assisted by Tasha, a 

 beautiful medical student, Dr. Morley inserts a sigmoidoscope, a wandlike 

 camera device, into Hank&apos;s backside for a view of his colon. When the 

 procedure proves inconclusive, Dr. Morley tells Hank that his&quot;low fat, high 

 fiber diet&quot;isn&apos;t effective. Peggy insists the diet simply needs more time 

 to work. To be on the safe side, Morley books an operating room. He tells 

 Hank that, unless his condition improves, his colon will have to be removed 

 by the end of the week.

When Peggy catches her husband frying a cheeseburger, she drives him to a 

 local health food store. But Hank shows little enthusiasm for tofu dogs. 

 Growing increasingly desperate, Hank tries everything from bacon grease to 

 acupuncture needles but they, too, fail. While chatting with Nancy, Peggy 

 realizes her husband&apos;s new diet and lifestyle is making him miserable. A 

 short time later, Hank tells his wife that he&apos;d rather&quot;die with a burger in 

 my colon&quot;than spend the rest of his life eating tofu. Surprisingly, Peggy 

 agrees and tells Hank how much she loves him. Tears in his eyes, Hank tells 

 his wife how lucky he is to have her in his life. Suddenly, a strange look 

 passes over Hank&apos;s face. He races to the bathroom, and after a simple flush 

 echoes through the hallways, Hank flings open the door, standing heroically. 

 Peggy and Bobby rush to his side.
  
 b : 23-Feb-1997 pc : 4E07 w : Mike Judge and Greg Daniels d : Adam Kuhlman   7. Westie Side Story   
Hank mistakenly believes that his new Laotian neighbors use dog meat to make 

 their delicious barbecued hamburgers.

A large moving truck pulls into the driveway of a home next door to the Hill 

 residence. A strapping, all-American father and his teenage son hop out of 

 the vehicle, drawing words of approval from Hank and his friends. But the 

 man explains he was hired to move the belongings of another family, and 

 points to a minivan as it pulls into the driveway. When a Laotian family, 

 the Souphanousinphones, steps out, Hank&apos;s jaw drops in disbelief. Telling 

 his buddies that&quot;a neighbor&apos;s a neighbor,&quot;Hank walks next door and 

 introduces himself. He meets Kahn Souphanousinphone, his wife, Minh, and 

 their daughter, Kahn, Jr. (Connie). Kahn Sr. explains that he and his family 

 moved from Laos to California, where they lived for twenty years. Peggy 

 invites the family to her home for dinner. For dessert, Peg serves up her 

 Brown Betty, the recipe for which is a closely guarded family secret. As the 

 Souphanousinphones leave the house, Minh makes a remark regarding Peggy&apos;s 

 large feet. The next day, Hank discovers his dog, Ladybird, being mounted by 

 Kahn&apos;s West Highland Terrier, Doggie. Hank tells Kahn his dog should be&quot;breeding with her own kind,&quot;prompting Kahn to call Hank a&quot;narrow-minded 

 redneck.&quot;

Minh apologizes to Peggy for getting off to a bad start during dinner. She 

 invites the Hills to join her family for a barbecue. Peggy accepts the 

 offer. During the meal, Minh serves up Peggy&apos;s Brown Betty with an added 

 dash of nutmeg. Peggy is furious that Minh was able to figure out the 

 recipe. Meanwhile, Bobby and Kahn, Jr. give chase when Doggie runs off into 

 the neighborhood. Relations between Hank and Kahn thaw the moment Hank takes 

 a bite of Kahn&apos;s barbecued hamburger. Hank calls it&quot;the best damn burger I 

 ever ate.&quot;Dale, however, abstains from tasting the burger, noting the 

 Westie&apos;s empty leash lying on the ground.

Refusing to believe his neighbors would cook dog, Hank does some 

 investigating on his own. After overhearing, and misconstruing, a 

 conversation between Minh and the dog pound, Hank concludes the burger was 

 made of Doggie. Meanwhile, Bobby and Connie unleash Ladybird, hoping she 

 will lead them to the missing Doggie. When Hank discovers Ladybird&apos;s leash 

 swinging in the breeze, he mistakenly concludes that his neighbors are using 

 her to make hamburger. Hank bangs on the Souphanousinphones&apos; front door, 

 demanding the return of his dog. Kahn threatens Hank with a baseball bat, 

 but before the argument escalates, the two children race to the home and 

 explain that they are responsible for the missing pets. Angered, both men 

 send their children to their respective rooms without dessert. Noting how 

 they punish their offspring the same way, Hank and Kahn patch up their 

 differences.
  
 b : 02-Mar-1997 pc : 4E06 w : Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger d : Brian Sheesley 
NOTE: First appearance of Khan, Minh, and Connie Souphanousinphone. 8. Shins of the Father   
Much to Peggy&apos;s dismay, Hank&apos;s sexist father drops by to celebrate Bobby&apos;s 

 birthday.

Leafing through the mail, Hank notices that Bobby&apos;s birthday invitation to 

 Grandpa Cotton was returned. He then realizes that Bobby wrote&quot;Hell, USA&quot;as the mailing address. Bobby explains that Peggy told him Cotton was the 

 devil. The boy then recites a list of things he dislikes about his 

 grandfather: his big plastic teeth, his incessant screaming, and his lack of 

 shins. Hank explains that Cotton lost his shins&quot;defending Texas in World 

 War II.&quot;Bobby telephones his grandfather and invites him to the 

 celebration. The day of the party, a Cadillac pulls into the driveway, a 

 horse trailer in tow. The trailer&apos;s ramp is kicked open from the inside, and 

 Cotton rides the horse into the Hill&apos;s backyard. Eyes shining, and assuming 

 the animal is a gift, Bobby tells his grandfather how much he loves the 

 horse. But Cotton explains the horse is being rented for only a few hours. 

 Later, he gives Bobby his real present: a 20-gauge shotgun. Outraged, Peggy 

 snatches the weapon from his hands. When Bobby is unable to break open his 

 birthday pinata, Cotton blows it apart with the gun. Peggy asks Cotton to 

 leave the house after he smashes her good dishes. But when the old man 

 attempts to start his car, the engine fails to turn over. Luanne diagnoses 

 the problem as a solenoid plunger. Peggy tells Hank she wants the&quot;ill-tempered, foul-mouthed old man&quot;out of her house. But Hank tells his 

 father he is welcome to stay.

Cotton takes Bobby to a local bar, where he harasses waitresses with sexist 

 remarks. Meanwhile, Peggy finds the missing solenoid plunger hidden in a 

 pair of Cotton&apos;s pants. She tells Hank that his father deliberately removed 

 the part so he could stay at the house. Events turn even uglier when 

 Cotton&apos;s sexist remarks begin influencing Bobby&apos;s behavior. Bobby tells his 

 mother to get his dinner and punctuates his point by slapping her on the 

 rear-end.

Hank admonishes Bobby for hitting his mother. He then attempts to tell his 

 father why his behavior around Bobby is inappropriate. But before Hank has a 

 chance to speak, his father reiterates the tale of how he lost his shins in 

 World War II. After listening in awe to the patriotic story, Hank decides to 

 drop the idea entirely. But when Bobby is sent home from school for starting 

 a&quot;sexist riot,&quot;Hank decides his father has gone too far. He tells Cotton 

 he won&apos;t let his son grow up to be a&quot;woman-hating old fool&quot;and orders him 

 out of the house.
  
 b : 23-Mar-1997 pc : 4E08 w : Alan Cohen and Alan Freedland d : Martin Archer   9. Peggy the Boggle Champ gs : Laurie Metcalf (Cissy Cob) Chuck Mangione (Himself) 
Hank must choose between attending the Dallas Mower Expo or coaching his 

 wife at the state Boggle championships.

Peggy, Minh, Luanne and Nancy play a Scrabble-like game in the Hill dining 

 room. When Peggy easily beats her opponents, Nancy suggests she sign up for 

 the Boggle tournament at the Elks club. Meanwhile, Hank, Dale, Bill and 

 Boomhauer are mesmerized when a television commercial announces the Ninth 

 Annual Dallas Mower Expo. Peggy enters the Elks club competition and, after 

 easily breezing past the other players, wins a coveted trophy. But to Peggy, 

 the biggest honor is getting to represent Arlen in the state Boggle 

 championships. Hank agrees to act as his wife&apos;s coach after he learns it 

 takes place in Dallas the very same weekend as the Mower Expo. He tells his 

 friends that the Boggle tournament will keep Peggy busy while they sneak off 

 for some real fun.

Peggy and Hank say goodbye to Bobby and Luanne and head off for Dallas. 

 Despite their best intentions, and their promise not to throw any parties, 

 Bobby and Luanne accidentally ruin the family coffee table, drip varnish on 

 the carpet, and scorch a section of wall. Meanwhile, Peggy is introduced to 

 Cissy Cobb, Boggle champion of Dallas for seven non-consecutive years. Cissy 

 easily intimidates Peggy by criticizing a jacket given to her by the Arlen 

 Boggle Boosters. Shortly before the tournament begins, Hank tells his wife 

 about the Mower Expo. Peggy makes an impassioned plea for Hank not to run 

 off in her hour of need. He agrees to stay and act as her coach. When the 

 tournament begins, Peggy gets off to a shaky start, and Cissy Cobb takes a 

 commanding lead.

Peggy is ranked 255 out of 256...one step ahead of a Boggle-playing chicken. 

 But she valiantly continues to play. Meanwhile, Hank&apos;s buddies show up at 

 the tournament. At first, Hank chooses to help coach his wife. But some 

 sharp words from Dale and the others change his mind, and the men head for 

 the Mower Expo. Slowly but surely, Peggy regains her confidence and rises 

 through the ranks until she makes it into the finals. She is horrified, 

 however, when she realizes her opponent is none other than Cissy Cobb. Hank 

 realizes he cannot enjoy himself at the expo knowing his wife needs him. He 

 races back to the Boggle tournament just in time to give his wife the extra 

 boost she needs. Brimming with confidence, Peggy beats Cissy and is declared 

 the new Texas State Boggle Champion.
  
 b : 13-Apr-1997 pc : 4E10 w : Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger d : Chuck Sheets   10. Keeping Up With Our Joneses   
Hank&apos;s attempt to make Bobby dislike smoking backfires, leaving the entire 

 family hooked on cigarettes.

Luanne is outraged when she discovers Ladybird eating her&quot;cruelty-free&quot;cosmetics. Later, while digging through an old dumpster, Bobby and Joseph 

 come across an unsmoked cigarette. The boys sneak into a men&apos;s room at a gas 

 station and light up. As luck would have it, Hank stops at the same station 

 to use the bathroom. He pushes open the door and sees his son with a 

 cigarette in his mouth. Determined to stop his son from becoming addicted, 

 Hank forces Bobby to smoke an entire carton (thinking he won&apos;t be able to 

 stand the sight of another cigarette when he is finished). As Bobby lights 

 up, Hank grabs a cigarette away to show his boy how to inhale properly. As 

 Hank takes a drag, a look of remembrance and relaxation washes over his 

 face. By the end of the day, both Hank and his son are hopelessly addicted.

When Luanne catches Ladybird sniffing a makeup tin, she rattles a canister 

 of pennies, scaring her off. Meanwhile, after sneaking cigarette after 

 cigarette, Hank absentmindedly lights up in front of Peggy. Hank claims 

 Bobby didn&apos;t finish a pack from the carton and insists he would hate to see 

 them go to waste. Shortly thereafter, Hank and his wife go back to smoking 

 cigarettes and feeling better than ever. Meanwhile, Bobby tricks a militant 

 group of anti-smoking teenagers into allowing him to buy a pack from a 

 bodega that sells cigarettes to teenagers. Despite everyone&apos;s best efforts, 

 Bobby discovers that his parents are addicted to smoking and vice versa.

The Hills attend a Cigarenders meeting, but Hank quickly grows irritable and 

 storms out with his family in tow. When they return home, Luanne attempts to 

 make the Hills kick the habit by employing the same methods she used to keep 

 Ladybird away from her cosmetics. When the family gets into a scuffle over a 

 last remaining cigarette, Luanne locks them in a room together. The scuffle 

 continues until Peggy, regaining her senses, throws the cigarette out a 

 window. Despite experiencing a powerful nicotine withdrawal, the family 

 makes it through a storm-filled night without smoking any cigarettes.
  
 b : 27-Apr-1997 pc : 4E09 w : Jonathan Collier and Joe Stillman d : John Rice   11. King of the Ant Hill   
Hank&apos;s expensive new lawn is overrun by fire ants.

Hank primps his lawn for an upcoming Cinco de Mayo block party. His ego is 

 bruised when Kahn notes that his lawn is fuller and richer. Hank realizes 

 his lawn does indeed pale in comparison...but can&apos;t pinpoint the problem. 

 Shortly thereafter, Dale stops by the house and asks if he can spray the 

 grass with pesticide (in an effort to keep fire ants away from the 

 property). Hank approves the idea. But when Peggy hints that the lawn may be 

 lagging from all the poisonous chemicals being sprayed on it, Hank has a 

 change of heart. He instructs a crestfallen Dale not to touch his lawn ever 

 again. Later, Hank stops by a nursery and falls in love with an especially 

 lush patch of Raleigh Saint Augustine sod. Despite its enormous expense, 

 Hank resods his entire lawn using the luxurious grass. But unbeknownst to 

 him, Dale sabotages his efforts by deliberately dropping a clump of fire 

 ants onto his property.

As the days grow closer to Cinco de Mayo, Hank notices an ant hill on his 

 new lawn. Panicking, Hank uses a variety of methods in an attempt to destroy 

 the insects, but his efforts are hampered by Dale&apos;s secret meddling. 

 Meanwhile, Bobby falls victim to the Queen ant&apos;s hypnotic demands. Hank 

 comes to regret firing Dale. He approaches his neighbor and apologizes for 

 valuing his lawn more than their friendship. Ever grateful, Dale pumps 

 massive amounts of insecticide onto Hank&apos;s lawn. The next morning, Hank 

 discovers his lawn has been turned into a dirt landscape as barren as the 

 surface of the moon.

His life shattered, Hank vows to cover his lawn with woodchips and gravel. 

 Meanwhile, Peggy enters the Gribble&apos;s basement to retrieve some sugar for 

 Nancy. When she descends into the eerie, poorly lit room, she comes upon a 

 model of the Hill home, with miniature ant mounds surrounding the property. 

 She realizes Dale deliberately introduced the ants to her husband&apos;s new sod. 

 Under the hypnotic control of the Queen, Bobby releases some captured ants 

 to a mound on the lawn. The ants communicate with one another, then suddenly 

 swarm Bobby. Hank is outraged when Peggy tells him the truth about Dale. He 

 rushes to his neighbor&apos;s home, intending to do him bodily harm. But before 

 Hank makes good on his threats, Bobby calls out for help. The men turn 

 around, only to see Bobby completely covered with fire ants. In an act of 

 self-sacrifice, Dale clasps the boy&apos;s hand, and the fire ants crawl onto his 

 body. Dale collapses on the ground as he is stung over and over by the 

 insects. When Dale finally stops moving, the ants crawl off his body. Later, 

 revelers show up at the Hill home holding lush green squares of lawn grass 

 sod/Cinco de Mayo gifts for their neighbor. Hank is overcome with emotion.

Hank and Peggy jump to conclusions when they discover Bobby using one of 

 Luanne&apos;s plastic beautician school heads to practice interacting with girls.

Joseph invites Bobby to his upcoming boy-girl party. But Bobby soon realizes 

 he is intimidated by most of the girls at school and lacks the courage and 

 social skills needed to approach them. He tells his father he is not going 

 to attend the party because he doesn&apos;t like girls. Hank&apos;s face begins to 

 twitch at the implication. Later, Luanne brings home a beautician school 

 practice head that she will need for her final exam. Bobby is instantly 

 drawn to the head, and stares at it with rapt wonder. Late that night, he 

 sneaks out of the house and up to Luanne&apos;s window, where he again stares 

 with enchantment at the beautiful plastic head.

When Hank, Peggy and Luanne leave the house the next day, Bobby retrieves 

 the head. Practicing in secret, he uses the dummy head in lieu of a real 

 girl, asking it if it would like to dance, etc. Meanwhile, Hank does his 

 best to avoid Luanne, who would like to practice for her upcoming exam by 

 cutting his hair. Bobby practices with the dummy head for so long that he 

 grows comfortable with the idea of attending the party. Hank and Peggy 

 conclude their boy is perfectly normal after all. But when Peggy catches 

 Bobby playing Spin the Bottle with the head, she shrieks in horror.

White as a ghost, Peggy tells Hank she walked in on their son as he was 

 kissing the dummy head. She suggests the family move to Berlin, as the 

 Germans are more tolerant towards freakish people. Bobby tells his father he 

 has no intention of marrying a plastic head. Convinced his boy is using the 

 head as a crutch, Hank locks it in his liquor cabinet. When Hank catches 

 Bobby breaking into the cabinet, he snatches the head from his son&apos;s hands, 

 and as Luanne watches, horrified, saws it in two with a spinning sawtoothed 

 blade. Left with little choice, Luanne uses Hank (in place of the plastic 

 head) for her final exam at the beautician academy. Her instructor, Miss 

 Kremzer, examines Hank&apos;s haircut and assigns her an&quot;F.&quot;But after 

 overhearing Hank&apos;s glowing comments about his haircut, calling it his&quot;all-time favorite,&quot;Kremzer gives Luanne a passing grade. Later, before the 

 party, Bobby and Connie decide to practice kissing one another. When Bobby 

 plays Spin the Bottle at Joseph&apos;s party, the bottle points to Dale&apos;s wife, 

 Nancy. Bobby grits his teeth and lunges for Nancy.

 13. How to Fire a Rifle Without Really Trying gs : David Herman (Eustis) Wallace Shawn (Rifle Shooting Instructor) 
When Bobby discovers a talent for target shooting, Hank discovers that an 

 experience from his own childhood is affecting his aim.

Hank takes his son to the state fair, where Bobby shows little talent for 

 winning prizes at any of the game booths. But everything changes when Bobby 

 discovers a knack for downing mechanical ducks with a BB gun. Hank has never 

 been so proud of his son. Despite Peg&apos;s initial objections, he takes Bobby 

 to the local Mega Lo Mart and purchases an expensive rifle. The pair travel 

 to a clubhouse shooting range, where Bobby again displays expert 

 marksmanship. While watching the boy take target practice, Hank learns of an 

 upcoming father/son funshoot tournament. Excited, and convinced he and his 

 son will win the competition, Hank picks up Bobby&apos;s gun for some target 

 practice of his own. While aiming the rifle, Hank suddenly grows confused, 

 his hands shaking. In his mind, he recalls a childhood memory in which his 

 own father, Cotton, berated him as he learned to shoot a gun for the first 

 time. The experience was a traumatic one, and Hank cannot overcome the 

 psychological damage. As a result, his marksmanship skills suffer.

Embarrassed, Hank enrolls Bobby in a safety course, hoping the experience 

 will drain all the fun out of target practice and thereby end his son&apos;s 

 interest in attending the tournament. When this fails, Hank brings his son 

 to the clubhouse early in the morning, reducing the odds of humiliation on 

 the shooting range. A sports psychologist named Philip Ny notices Hank&apos;s 

 dilemma. Stressing the importance of mental concentration over physical 

 ability, Ny hands Hank his business card, which Hank places in his pocket. 

 Later, Hank declares that guns are dangerous, and tells his friends he will 

 not participate in the competition. But he tells Peggy the real reason for 

 dropping out is that he cannot shoot straight. Peggy convinces her husband 

 that quitting isn&apos;t fair to Bobby.

Desperate, Hank turns to Philip Ny. The psychologist&apos;s technique slowly 

 builds Hank&apos;s self-confidence, improving his aim. The day of the tournament 

 finally arrives. Slowly, Hank and Bobby rise through the ranks until they 

 tie for first place. Then, without warning, Cotton shows up at the 

 tournament. Hank&apos;s face falls. A few moments later, Bobby successfully hits 

 his target...leaving the outcome of the game on Hank&apos;s shoulders. Despite 

 his best effort, Hank misses. Bobby, however, is overjoyed when he and his 

 father are awarded a second place certificate.

Hank stages a rescue attempt when a tornado bears down on Peggy and Luanne 

 inside a trailer park.

Hank loses his cool when he realizes Luanne washed his undergarments with 

 hers. Shortly thereafter, a bill collector arrives at the Hill residence. 

 Hank learns that his niece owes six months back rent for the trailer she 

 abandoned at Shiny Pines Trailer Park. When Hank confronts Luanne, she 

 explains that the trailer tipped over, making it uninhabitable. Anxious to 

 rid himself of his niece, Hank uses a winch to right the toppled trailer. He 

 then tells Peggy it is time for Luanne to leave the house. As Luanne says 

 her emotional final goodbyes, Hank hands her his business card, explaining 

 how it will save her ten percent on all of her propane needs. Hurt by Hank&apos;s 

 coldness, Luanne begins crying. Furious, Peggy confronts her husband. She 

 refers to him as a&quot;blockhead&quot;who is unable to express his emotions. In his 

 own unique way, Hank tells his wife to go to hell. Shocked, Peggy climbs 

 into her car and drives Luanne and her belongings to the trailer park. 

 Shortly thereafter, a television reporter warns of an approaching storm 

 capable of spawning tornadoes. When the reporter mentions that&quot;trailer 

 parks can be hell in a tornado,&quot;Hank grows worried.

Certain his wife is in grave danger, Hank piles emergency supplies into his 

 truck and, accompanied by Bobby, sets off for the trailer park. 

 Unfortunately, Hank blows a fuel filter along the way, and must fend for 

 himself amongst panicky shoppers at the local Mega Lo Mart as he attempts to 

 purchase a replacement. Meanwhile, Boomhauer and Dale do some tornado 

 chasing in hopes of recording the twister on videotape. Their close 

 encounter with the tornado sends a fifty gallon drum of pesticide flying out 

 the back of Dale&apos;s van. Workers wearing protective suits shut down the 

 highway until the mystery container can be identified. His progress halted 

 by the road block, Hank loses his cool. He hits the gas pedal and continues 

 driving.

When Hank reaches the trailer park, the tornado is ominously close. An old 

 woman takes Bobby to a nearby shelter while Hank runs towards the trailers 

 in search of his wife. Hank steps out of the trailer when he hears Peggy&apos;s 

 voice calling his name. Through the swirling debris, he sees Peggy waving to 

 him from the shelter. Suddenly, the twister descends from the sky. Hank 

 grabs hold of a telephone pole and, fearing for his life, pours out his 

 soul. He tells Peggy how much she means to him. The tornado passes by, 

 sparing Hank&apos;s life but tearing off all of his clothing. An embarrassed Hank 

 covers himself with a small potted cactus and makes his way to the shelter. 

 With the trailer having been destroyed by the storm, Hank realizes Luanne 

 will be living with the family indefinitely.
  
 b : 26-Sep-1997 pc : 5E02 w : Cheryl Holliday   15. Arrow Head gs : Maurice LaMarche (Prof. John Lerner) Maurice LaMarche (Prof. John Lerner) 
Hank grows jealous when Peggy begins spending her time with an 

 archaeologist.

As Hank shows off his brand-new rototiller to his friends, the machine&apos;s 

 blade strikes (what he believes is) a rock. Peggy tells Hank the object in 

 question is actually an Indian arrowhead. Shortly thereafter, while 

 smoothing dirt with a rake, Hank happens upon another object. Intrigued, 

 Hank shows it to John Redcorn, who explains that the artifact is a sacred 

 Indian tool used for straightening an arrow&apos;s shaft and places its value at 

 fifty dollars (roughly the same cost as a new rototiller blade). Hank brings 

 the artifacts to a local university, where Professor Lerner, a tall, 

 good-looking man, belittles their value and offers him ten dollars. 

 Disappointed, Hank takes the money and leaves. Moments later, Lerner 

 gingerly places the arrowhead inside a plastic bag for safe keeping. The 

 next day, Lerner and some graduate students show up on the Hill front lawn. 

 Peggy falls for Lerner&apos;s fake smile and signs a document granting him and 

 his students access to the property. But Hank loses his cool when he sees 

 Lerner digging into his precious lawn with a mechanical shovel.

Hank orders everyone off his property, but Lerner points out that the 

 document Peggy signed transformed the area into a protected archaeological 

 site. As Lerner continues excavating, Peggy develops a crush on the learned 

 professor. Hoping to expose her son to the fine art of conversation, and 

 despite Hank&apos;s objections, Peggy invites Lerner inside for dinner. During 

 the meal, Lerner shows off a replica of an intricately woven Wahasha 

 bracelet, a symbol of bonding between an Indian brave and his sweetheart. 

 Later, Hank notices the bracelet on his wife&apos;s wrist.

Jealous and suspicious, Hank concocts a scheme to embarrass Lerner in front 

 of his students. Using chicken bones and some twine, he fashions a fake 

 Indian necklace and buries it beneath the lawn. His plot begins unraveling, 

 however, when Peggy, not Lerner, discovers the&quot;artifact.&quot;As a crowd of 

 grad students gathers around, Lerner asks Peggy for her opinion about the 

 necklace. Peggy hypothesizes that the object is a warrior necklace made from 

 finger bones of the enemy. Lerner ridicules the conclusion, belittling Peggy 

 before the class and causing her to break down. When Hank admits it was he 

 who planted the fake necklace, Peggy realizes her husband did so out of 

 jealousy. Lerner snickers, telling Hank he could have had an affair with his 

 wife for the price of a phony bracelet. Angered, Hank pushes the professor 

 into a nearby pit...as do Peggy and Bobby.

Hank is outraged when a conservative church member attempts to outlaw 

 Halloween.

Hank and his buddies work on constructing a haunted house for the local 

 school. Meanwhile, Luanne attends a Bible study meeting. The group leader 

 introduces Junie Harper, a new, outspoken member of the church whom Hank 

 considers a busybody. Junie tells the impressionable teenagers that 

 Halloween is a holiday for witches and Satanists. When Luanne returns home, 

 she repeats what Junie said about trick or treating being devil worship--a 

 notion that raises Hank&apos;s ire. Later, Junie tells Luanne she is sponsoring a 

 Hallelujah House, a&quot;righteous alternative&quot;to haunted houses. When Junie 

 learns that Bobby&apos;s school is sponsoring a haunted house, she threatens the 

 principal, Mr. Moss, with a lawsuit (claiming separation of church and 

 state). Left with little choice, Moss cancels the haunted house.

Peggy suggests that the haunted house be held inside the family garage. 

 Later, Hank initiates Bobby in the fine art of trick or treating by covering 

 Junie&apos;s house with toilet paper. As a furious Junie exits the dwelling, Hank 

 and his son run for cover. But Junie gets a good look at Bobby&apos;s face and 

 reports him to the police. Hank takes the blame for the incident, but out of 

 Peggy&apos;s earshot, he praises the boy as a&quot;regular Halloween hellraiser.&quot;Later, Luanne tells Bobby that his father is a Satanist. At first, Bobby 

 dismisses the notion, but after recollecting several of Hank&apos;s comments 

 about Halloween, the boy comes to believe Luanne may be right. Meanwhile, 

 Junie convinces the City Council that her house was attacked by Satanists. 

 As a result, the Council passes a curfew that, in effect, cancels Halloween. 

 Despite this, Hank vows to teach his son&quot;the true meaning of Halloween come 

 hell or high water.&quot;

Luanne and Bobby attend Hallelujah House, where Junie pushes her own 

 religious agenda. Meanwhile, Hank and Peggy sit by the garbage hoping trick 

 or treaters will stop by the garage to see the haunted house. When Hank 

 learns that his son attended Junie&apos;s anti-Halloween church party, he takes 

 action. Despite the threat of arrest, Hank dons his Devil&apos;s costume from 

 childhood and walks down the street yelling,&quot;trick or treat.&quot;Soon after, 

 other residents muster the courage to join him, and a parade of neighbors 

 gather in front of Junie&apos;s home. Hank tells his son he will be given candy 

 if he joins the festivities. Junie, however, warns he will be sent to hell. 

 Bobby decides to go trick or treating--not because of the candy, but because 

 of his wish to be with his father. Later, the boy tells Hank that despite 

 what he said in front of Junie, he does indeed care about the prospect of 

 getting free candy.

Hank finally cracks when he discovers a fishy secret.

A thief attempts to break into Hank&apos;s truck as Hank and his son search for 

 worms in Arlen City Park. Hank makes a citizen&apos;s arrest, and later, a good 

 ol&apos; boy judge known for creative sentencing orders the teenager to spend 

 three months inside the cab of a pickup. When Hank attempts to retrieve his 

 own truck from the impound lot, he discovers it has been completely 

 dismantled (as police believed the teenager may have attempted to hide drugs 

 inside the vehicle). Hank decides that the only cure for his mounting stress 

 is a nice quiet fishing trip with his buddies. Employing exotic lures, Dale, 

 Boomhauer and Bill all catch sizable bass. Hank labels the lures&quot;cheaterbait&quot;and sticks to worms. But as the day wears on, and having reeled in empty 

 time and again, Hank realizes he must get with the times. He visits a bait 

 and tackle shop looking for a scented lure. The owner recommends a special 

 homemade bait concocted by a man who works out of his truck on a street 

 corner. Hank drives to the neighborhood where the man works, but instead of 

 buying bait, he inadvertently purchases crack from a drug dealer.

Back at Lake Arlen, Hank pierces his hook with the drug (believing it is the 

 homemade bait) and tosses his line into the water. Suddenly, the fish begin 

 biting. And biting. And biting. Dale, Boomhauer and Bill also try the&quot;miracle bait,&quot;and they, too, have resounding success. As the bass become&quot;hooked&quot;on the bait, the anglers become hooked on catching multitudes of 

 fish; Dale even breaks into Hank&apos;s garage in a desperate effort to find the 

 bait. Shortly thereafter, Hank discovers that the bass have tired of the 

 drug and crave something stronger. Hank returns to the dealer, only to 

 discover he was followed by Dale. Suddenly, two police cars pull up to the 

 corner. Hank and Dale are placed under arrest for attempting to purchase 

 drugs.

Hank faces the same judge who sentenced the car thief. Telling Hank he has&quot;the haircut of an honest man,&quot;the judge, himself a bit of an angler, 

 offers a deal: If Hank and Dale are able to show him how to catch a fish 

 using a rock of crack as bait, he will set them free. Otherwise, they&apos;ll 

 face 24 months in jail. After spending six hours on Lake Arlen, the men fail 

 to catch even one bass. As the sun begins to set, the judge gives Hank and 

 Dale five more minutes to prove their claim. When the judge isn&apos;t looking, 

 Hank baits his own line with a good old fashioned worm. The ploy works, and 

 Hank reels in a fish. True to his word, the judge sets the men free.

Much to Hank&apos;s embarrassment, Bobby gets a job modeling fashion wear for 

 overweight people.

Peggy and Hank take their son shopping at a local department store. 

 Unfortunately, Bobby is unable to squeeze himself into any of the pants on 

 sale. A salesman tells the Hills they would be better off shopping at a 

 clothing store which tailors to&quot;special&quot;children, such as H. Dumpty&apos;s. 

 Hank realizes the salesman is referring to his son&apos;s girth. Peggy puts her 

 own spin on why people shop at H. Dumpty&apos;s, telling Bobby that&quot;being 

 different is the best thing in the whole wide world.&quot;When Bobby tries on 

 the clothing, he grows excited. His enthusiasm catches the attention of the 

 store&apos;s owner, who asks if the boy would be interested in modeling for an 

 upcoming fashion ad. Hank is mortified by the idea. Luanne, however, drives 

 Bobby to the photo shoot, and when the pair return the boy announces he will 

 be appearing in a newspaper advertisement the following day.

The next morning, an embarrassed Hank sneaks onto his neighbors&apos; lawns and 

 retrieves the offending ads. Shortly thereafter, a major talent agency 

 phones the Hill residence offering representation and even more work. Though 

 Hank warns his wife that kids who are different are victimized by their 

 peers, Peggy insists there is nothing wrong with allowing their son to feel 

 good about himself. Later, Peggy takes Bobby to meet Claude Stokes, an agent 

 who believes the boy could become just as famous as one of the superstars of 

 husky modeling, a boy named Andy Maynard. Hank sheepishly sneaks inside a 

 photo studio, where he observes his son being given a makeover by a female 

 stylist. Hank is horrified by the sight. He grows even more distressed after 

 Luanne tells him Bobby will appear in an upcoming fashion show. Fuming, he 

 grabs Bobby and pulls him out of the studio. He then forbids his son from 

 attending the fashion show. Early the next morning, Bobby hops into a taxi, 

 a garment bag over his shoulder.

When Hank discovers his son missing, he hops into his truck and drives to 

 the mall where the fashion show is being held. Backstage, Bobby meets Andy 

 Maynard, who makes no secret of the fact that he is a husky supermodel. Hank 

 bursts into a dressing room looking for his son, but Bobby is already in the 

 wings. Claude Stokes tells the boy that he will walk onstage first...causing 

 Andy to throw a temper tantrum. When his father appears, Bobby makes a dash 

 for the stage. But Hank throws the boy over his shoulder and heads for the 

 exit. Moments later, as a triumphant Andy Maynard walks on stage, Dooley and 

 his buddies begin hurling donuts at the models. Bobby realizes his father 

 saved him from a humiliating fate.

It&apos;s the battle of the ages when Hank and his friends face off against four 

 teenagers for a game of paintball.

An old man notices Hank and his friends using a leaf blower to clear away 

 some leaves. He belittles them for not using a rake. Amused by the old man&apos;s 

 antiquated ways, Hank and the others chuckle. Later, Hank, acting as Block 

 Captain, attempts to&quot;straighten out&quot;four teenagers--Cane, Zeus, Face and a 

 shaved bald guy--when they play loud rock music out of their garage. The 

 four punks make fun of Hank and continue playing. Shortly thereafter, Hank 

 drives Peggy, Luanne, Bobby and his friend Joseph to the local FunCenter. 

 There, Hank and his friends use the ballcollector guy for target practice on 

 the driving range. Their fun is interrupted when Bobby and Joseph, covered 

 in red paint, complain that some older boys ambushed them. Hank realizes the 

 attackers are none other than the four punks. Cane and his cronies challenge 

 Hank and his buddies to a game of paintball--a dare Hank can&apos;t refuse. But 

 during the course of the game, the older men discover they are no match for 

 their stealthier adversaries. Adding insult to injury, the four punks 

 capture the men and, in a humiliating gesture, gun them down with paintballs 

 as onlookers watch in disgust.

BACK At home, Hank exhibits signs of what Peggy labels&quot;post-traumatic 

 stress syndrome.&quot;Hank dismisses the idea as&quot;ridiculous,&quot;but he later 

 notices a change in his friends&apos; behavior as well. After reliving the 

 humiliating paintball massacre in flashback, Hank decides it is time to take 

 action. Buoyed by Peggy&apos;s encouragement, Hank approaches his friends. He 

 tells them that if they don&apos;t fight back, they are destined to become the&quot;weird old guys of the block.&quot;Boomhauer, Dale and Bill all agree, and the 

 four punks accept the challenge of a rematch. Unfortunately, Hank and his 

 friends are again defeated.

Hank, Dale, Bill and Boomhauer all agree that they have grown old. In fact, 

 they begin hanging out with the same old man they ridiculed earlier. When 

 the punks begin taking pot shots at Bill, Hank is struck with an idea: If 

 they can understand the mind of a teenager, it might give them the advantage 

 they need to win on the playing field. The others agree. After observing 

 teenagers in action, the men make three conclusions: that teenagers are 

 cruel, clumsy around girls...and paranoid around head shops. The men then 

 challenge the punks to a rematch, betting the leaf blower against their 

 amplifier. The punks agree. During the game, the men utilize their 

 observations and strike back. Eventually, only two players remain: Hank and 

 Cane. In a stroke of genius, Hank disguises himself as the ballcollector guy 

 and ambushes his opponent, winning the game.

Hank and Kahn fear the worst when Bobby, Connie, and Joseph explore a cave 

 where teenagers go to&quot;make whoopee.&quot;

Bobby and Connie raise the ire of music teacher Eugene Grandy when they 

 interrupt his class by adding their own lyrics to popular tunes. As 

 punishment, Grandy calls Hank and Kahn to the school and voices his concerns 

 regarding their disruptive behavior. It soon becomes apparent to Grady that 

 the men have set a bad parental image. But his efforts to change their 

 behavior fails miserably. The next day, Hank and Kahn punish their children 

 by making them perform chores. Bobby tires of cleaning out a rain gutter and 

 makes his way to Connie&apos;s house. The children hop on their bikes and head 

 off in search of adventure. During the ride, they encounter Joseph, who 

 suggests a journey to&quot;The Caves,&quot;a place where teenagers go to&quot;make out.&quot;As the threesome make their way into the dark cave, they are spotted by 

 Eustis&apos;s son, Randy, who warns them not to venture inside.

Bobby, Connie and Joseph ignore Randy and make their way into the darkened 

 cave. Meanwhile, Hank, Kahn, Peggy and Minh embark on a desperate search for 

 the missing children. Eventually they encounter Randy, who reveals that the 

 children wandered into the caves. Hank panics. He tells Kahn that the caves 

 are where teenagers go to&quot;make whoopee.&quot;Later, Joseph, Bobby and Connie 

 become trapped when their light sources extinguish, plummeting the cave into 

 darkness.

The children begin to panic when they run out of food. When Bobby offers his 

 body as a source of sustenance, he greatly impresses Connie. Hank and Kahn 

 make their way into the cave...but Hank loses his bearings and the pair 

 become lost. They fall through a narrow crevice and land in a pile of old 

 beer cans. During the ensuing conversation, Kahn admits that Bobby is a&quot;good boy&quot;and doesn&apos;t fear becoming an in-law with his neighbor. The men 

 swap stories, and their laughter echoes through the cave, attracting the 

 attention of the children. The kids follow the sound...and inadvertently 

 tumble through the crevice. Shortly thereafter, a beer can tumbles from 

 above, striking Hank in the head. The group establishes communication with 

 Bill on the surface, and the fire department pulls everyone to safety.

Hank attempts to land a large business account by placating an obnoxious&quot;Yankee&quot;client.

Hank meets with his boss, Buck Strickland, inside the men&apos;s restroom at 

 work. Buck explains that Holloway Hollows, a new development, is in need of 

 a propane supplier. He gives Hank a one hundred dollar bill and the keys to 

 a rented Cadillac El Dorado convertible, instructing him to show the owner 

 and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Holloway, a good time. Buck warns, however, that 

 their competitor (and Hank&apos;s old nemesis), M. F. Thatherton, is very eager 

 to land the same client. When Hank returns home, he tells his wife a cup of 

 coffee, a slice of pie and a handshake are all he needs to cement a deal. 

 But Hank is not quite prepared for Mr. Holloway, an obnoxious Yankee who 

 pictures Texans as stereotypical cowboys wearing ten-gallon hats and spurs. 

 As Hank attends to Holloway, Peggy strikes up an easy friendship with his 

 wife. When Hank takes Mr. Holloway to a coffee shop for pie, Thatherton 

 strides up to their table and introduces himself. Holloway is impressed with 

 Thatherton, referring to him as a&quot;real Texan.&quot;

Holloway notices that Hank isn&apos;t wearing cowboy boots. Taking the plunge, 

 Hank concocts a story about how he gave up his boots to his uncle after he 

 was killed by a Texas-sized twister. But Holloway still yearns to see his 

 host in a pair of boots. Hank takes Holloway and his son to a Western Wear 

 Store, where he purchases a pair of tight-fitting boots and a large cowboy 

 hat. Later, Hank asks Peggy to don a Kilgore Rangerette-type outfit for 

 their dinner engagement with the Holloways. Though greatly displeased, Peggy 

 honors her husband&apos;s request. Mrs. Holloway bows out of dinner at the last 

 moment. At the restaurant, Mr. Holloway orders an expensive steak, then 

 tells Hank that he and Thatherton are headed out to a strip club. But Hank 

 intercedes, insisting that if anyone is taking Holloway to a&quot;gentleman&apos;s 

 club,&quot;it will be him.

Hank takes his guest to a strip club called Jugstore Cowboys&apos;. There, he 

 sells his heart out, waxing philosophic about all things propane. But Mr. 

 Holloway is more interested in getting a good mint julep. When Hank returns 

 with the drink, Holloway takes one sip and spits it out. Fed up, Hank tells 

 his guest that he is in the business of&quot;selling propane and propane 

 accessories with honor and dignity.&quot;Holloway throws a punch, which Hank 

 casually catches in his fist. He declines the fight. Thatherton steps in and 

 busts Holloway in the nose. Holloway happily retaliates, and an all-out bar 

 fight ensues. Afterward, Hank learns that it is Mrs. Holloway who owns the 

 business. Completely comfortable with Hank and his family, she awards 

 Strickland Propane the account.

Peggy insists that Connie be allowed to play on the school&apos;s all-boy 

 wrestling team. Hank becomes elated when Bobby announces he has joined the 

 wrestling team at school. Meanwhile, Peggy is asked to substitute teach the 

 Middle School girl&apos;s gym class. Her experience is a frustrating one; when 

 she requests new basketballs for the girls, she is informed the money was 

 earmarked to place holograms on football game tickets. The discrimination 

 continues when the girls are denied uniforms. Peggy loses her cool when 

 Coach Kleehammer asks the girls to move so the boys can have extra room to 

 scrimmage, but with no one on her side, she is forced to comply. Connie 

 tells Bobby she made a mistake when she signed up for sports. Peggy promises 

 Connie she can play whatever sport she choices. Connie tells her she wants 

 to join the wrestling team.

Peggy tells Kleehammer about Connie&apos;s wish, but the coach attempts to 

 dissuade her, claiming it is a&quot;boy&apos;s sport.&quot;When Minh and Kahn learn about 

 their daughter&apos;s new passion, they fear she might get hurt. But they realize 

 it might be enough to set her apart from others when she applies to college. 

 The Souphanousinphones threaten the principal with a lawsuit unless their 

 daughter is allowed to participate, and later, a reluctant Kleehammer 

 informs the boys a girl will be joining them. He then warns that, as a 

 result, some of the boys may not make the team. Later, Bobby tells his 

 parents that Kleehammer looked directly at him when he made the 

 announcement. At school, Kleehammer announces that tryouts will be held to 

 determine ability. To his horror, Bobby learns he will face Connie on the 

 mat.

Peggy is mortified when she hears the news. Meanwhile, Minh enlists Luanne&apos;s 

 assistance to help coach her daughter, while Hank tries his hand at prepping 

 Bobby for the match. The day of the tryout finally arrives. Taking their 

 cues from a video game, Bobby and Connie make wild,&quot;pro wrestling&quot;moves

As the Christmas holiday approaches, Hank and Peggy travel to the airport to 

 pick up Hank&apos;s mother, Tilly, and her new boyfriend, a Jewish man named Gary 

 Kasner. When the group returns home, Hank cannot hide his discomfort with 

 the idea of his mother sleeping with another man inside his home. He 

 arranges for his mother to sleep in the den with Luanne, while Gary is 

 confined to Bobby&apos;s room. That night, a sleepless Hank walks into the living 

 room, where he finds Gary eating a plate of food. When Gary broaches the 

 subject of his feelings for Tilly, Hank suddenly grabs the remote and 

 watches television, explaining that a late-night televangelist show is his 

 favorite. The next morning, Hank, Peggy, Luanne and Bobby pile into the car 

 and head off for a basketball game. Peggy turns the car around when her 

 husband realizes he forgot his favorite Styrofoam finger. When Hank enters 

 the house, he inadvertently catches a glimpse of his mother and Gary making 

 love on the kitchen table. The psychological shock causes Hank to go blind.

Peggy takes her husband to an opthamologist. Hank queries the doctor if it 

 is possible for a person to go blind after witnessing a horrific event. He 

 is told the condition is called hysterical blindness. Later, during the ride 

 home, Hank tells his wife he saw his mother and Gary making love. Peggy 

 cannot fathom her husband&apos;s reaction...until he mentions they were doing it 

 on the kitchen table. On Christmas morning, Peggy tells Hank he will never 

 get his sight back if he doesn&apos;t confront the trauma that triggered the 

 blindness. Instead, Hank asks Peggy to drive him to his father&apos;s house.

As the ride gets under way, Hank suddenly realizes Gary is at the wheel. He 

 asks Gary to turn the truck around and take him home. Instead, Gary takes 

 him to Cotton&apos;s house. During the short visit, Cotton talks despairingly 

 about his ex-wife. Offended, Gary leaves the house and waits for Hank 

 outside. Hank leaves the house shortly thereafter...and now sports a far 

 friendlier attitude towards Gary. Unexpectedly, Gary drives Hank to the 

 cathedral where the televangelist holds his services. As the sermon gets 

 underway, Hank thanks Gary for the gesture. Gary tells him his attitude 

 stems from his love of Tilly. Shortly thereafter, Hank regains his sight. 

 Later, during dinner, Hank declares the day has been the best Christmas 

 ever.

The Super Bowl brings super troubles for Hank.

Hank grows despondent when his old made-in-the-USA television set&quot;goes on 

 the disabled list&quot;several days before Super Bowl Sunday. Shortly 

 thereafter, Luanne joins Hank and Bobby on their trip to the Mega Lo Mart to 

 pick up grocery items for the upcoming Super Bowl event, as it is Hank&apos;s 

 turn to host his neighbors. Along the way, Hank spots a garage sale and 

 stops the car. His prayers are answered when he discovers a crucial part for 

 his ailing television set inside the back of an old monitor. Meanwhile, 

 Luanne, who has developed a case of the&quot;why me&apos;s,&quot;is greatly cheered when 

 she discovers a box of old puppets at the same garage sale. Later, she tells 

 Reverend Thomason about her idea to develop a puppet show using barnyard 

 animals who witnessed the birth of baby Jesus. She dubs the show,&quot;The 

 Manger Babies.&quot;Hank and his neighbors help Luanne construct a puppet 

 theater, which is moved to the church basement activities room. Luanne&apos;s 

 show is an instant hit with children, but Hank inadvertently interrupts the 

 performance while attempting to correct a nail protruding from the stage 

 (which he feels reflects poor craftsmanship). Hank&apos;s presence throws off 

 Luanne, and she desperately grapples to regain her momentum.

Realizing what he has done, Hank, improvising, helps Luanne save the show. 

 So grateful is Luanne that she writes Hank into the routine, giving him the 

 part of God. The show is such a hit that a local channel agrees to broadcast 

 a live performance. Luanne&apos;s spirits are greatly buoyed by the news. But 

 Hank realizes the show is scheduled against the Super Bowl. Hank tells 

 Luanne he cannot perform in her show due to the conflict of interest. The 

 day of the big game finally arrives, and Dale, Boomhauer and Bill gather at 

 Hank&apos;s house. During the game, the channel on Hank&apos;s television inexplicably 

 changes to&quot;The Manger Babies.&quot;Hank quickly grabs the remote and returns to 

 the Super Bowl broadcast. Unbeknownst to him, Peggy is standing outside the 

 house with another remote. She again changes the channel, interrupting the 

 game. This continues until Hank is drawn into the Manger Babies&apos;s story, one 

 in which the animals are about to accept a ride from a drunken man, Joe 

 SixPack. Hank jumps in his car and drives to the station, saving the 

 characters from Joe SixPack. Shortly thereafter, Hank bumps into Troy Aikman, 

 who saw a flyer announcing the puppet show. Later, Peggy looks heavenward 

 when Bobby reveals he borrowed the batteries from her TV remote before the 

 Super Bowl aired. Then Bobby states it may, in fact, have been after the 

 Super Bowl.

Hank questions his life and devotion to his job after discovering his boss 

 uses an electric and not propane stove.

The Hills help celebrate the Strickland Summer in January Picnic, in which 

 Strickland Propane employees and their families gather in a park for some 

 hamburgers on the grill. The festivities are cut short when it suddenly 

 begins to snow. Reacting quickly to the heating crisis, Strickland orders 

 his staff into action in hopes of getting the jump on the electric company. 

 Later, while ogling a company girlie calendar, Strickland suffers a heart 

 attack. At the hospital, Strickland assigns Lloyd Vickers, an MBA-type in 

 his thirties, temporary control of the company. Hank, meanwhile, is assigned 

 to walk Strickland&apos;s dogs, much to his embarrassment.

Hank tells Peggy about the appointment and his disappointment in not being 

 chosen to run the company. He later discovers that Vickers has ordered the 

 installation of tattlers devices that meter when a driver makes a stop and 

 for what duration into all company trucks. Outraged, Hank brings the issue 

 to Strickland, hoping he will put a quick end to the insulting policy 

 decision. But Strickland tells Hank he signed the purchase form himself. 

 Later, Peggy and Hank travel to Strickland&apos;s home, where they feed his dogs. 

 Inside the kitchen, Hank receives the shock of his life: Strickland uses an 

 electric stove.

Completely shaken and disillusioned about his life and career, Hank packs 

 his bags and heads out of town for some quiet time in the country. 

 Meanwhile, Strickland drivers, outraged over the installation of the 

 tattlers, walk out en masse. Vickers counters he will simply replace them 

 with friends. But a driver points out that anyone who operates one of the 

 trucks must be licensed for hazardous materials. When Strickland learns what 

 happened, he promptly fires Vickers. While visiting a small mom-and-pop 

 store in the country, Hank suddenly grows inspired. He realizes the secret 

 to running a business is service with a smile and making people happy. He 

 decides to quit the propane business and open his own general store. But 

 when Hank returns home, he listens to the many messages from needy customers 

 that have accumulated on his answering machine. Recalling fond memories from 

 the past, Hank returns to work. He tells Strickland he has returned because 

 he still believes in the product. Strickland, however, notes that the 

 business cannot run without licensed drivers. Hank points out a window, 

 where five large tow trucks are parked. He points out that a hazardous 

 materials license is not required to drive the vehicles. Soon after, Hank 

 and his friends are delivering propane using the trucks to tow the 

 Strickland Propane vehicles.

The Hills are all heart on a Valentine&apos;s episode.

As Valentine&apos;s Day approaches... Peggy uncovers a lie from Hank&apos;s past. As 

 Luanne and Bobby listen, Peggy recounts how she and Hank first realized they 

 were meant to be together. The year was 1973, and Hank and Peggy had already 

 been dating for six months. Hank convinced Peggy to cook him dinner for 

 Valentine&apos;s Day. Peggy agreedeven though she was a terrible cook. The meal, 

 beef Wellington and cherry pie, turned out terribly, but as luck would have 

 it, Hank phoned shortly before he was scheduled to arrive and bowed out, 

 claiming he pulled some tendons in his back. Two weeks later, after Hank&apos;s 

 back healed, Peggy and Hank were&quot;engaged to be engaged.&quot;BACK in the 

 present day, Peggy and another woman, Becky, update computer files at Arlen 

 High School. As the pair comb through the records, they come across Hank&apos;s 

 permanent file, which includes an entry about a twoweek absencestarting on 

 Valentine&apos;s Daydue to mono. Peggy tells Becky she never had&quot;the kissing 

 disease&quot;...creating a mystery. Meanwhile, Bobby receives Valentine&apos;s Day 

 chocolates in the mail from a secret admirer. He suspects the sender might 

 be Kerri Strug.

Peggy queries her husband about the incident. Hank claims he contracted mono 

 from sharing a soda with someone on the football team. An obsessed Peggy 

 learns that only one other studentAmy Edlinhad the disease during that time. 

 Peggy tracks Amy down, confronting her as she doles out little sausages on 

 toothpicks at a local super market. Amy recounts how she had broken up with 

 her boyfriend several weeks before Valentine&apos;s Day. Feeling as though she 

 had&quot;something to prove,&quot;she grabbed hold of Hank and kissed him. Hank 

 broke away... then rinsed his mouth out with Amy&apos;s soda. An angered Peggy 

 responds by delivering a punch to a side of beef.

Peggy returns home, where she accuses Hank of lying to her. But she is even 

 more upset that the romantic story of how they first got together is a 

 falsehood. Later, Dale, Bill and Boomhauer convince Hank he must woo his 

 wife until she loves him once more. Hank sees wisdom in their words, and 

 begins doing romantic things. He does everything from cover a puddle with 

 his coatto rent a pigall in an effort to make Peggy melt. But they all fail 

 miserably. While attempting to recover the pig, Hank hurts his back and 

 crashes to the ground. Peggy recounts Hank&apos;s antics to her girlfriends. The 

 women sigh at the thought of romance. A thoughtful look comes over Peggy. 

 She telephones Hank and promises to make him beef Wellington and cherry pie 

 for Valentine&apos;s Day. Meanwhile, much to his embarrassment, Bobby realizes

The Hills go south of the border.

Hank, Kahn and Dale find themselves trapped South of the Border. Minh boasts 

 of her family&apos;s upcoming luxury trip to Mexico, where they will stay in a 

 beautiful&quot;mitad&quot;duplex condo with Kahn&apos;s brother and family. Neither Minh 

 nor Peggy knows the meaning of the word&quot;mitad,&quot;and it is soon forgotten. A 

 short time later, Kahn learns that his brother has backed out of the 

 vacation, leaving him to pay the entire rent for the condo. He offers the 

 Hills the opportunity to join his family on the trip. Peggy talks Hank into 

 going along, as she is especially anxious to replace a papiermache pear she 

 purchased as an exchange student. Kahn arrives at the condo first. The 

 manager of the resort, Jacinto, shows Kahn around the unit. Jacinto explains 

 that&quot;mitad&quot;means half--meaning Kahn must share the downstairs portion with 

 Hank. Thinking quickly, Kahn tells Hank that the luxurious upstairs condo is 

 for the Hill family. The next morning, Peggy, Luanne and Minh tour a Mexican 

 marketplace in search of papier-mache pears and illegal beauty secret 

 supplies. Meanwhile, Connie and Bobby notice a curio shop that sells 

 fireworks. They purchase a giant, comedy-sized firecracker labeled&quot;La Bomba.&quot;Believing it to be real, the children slip the firecracker inside the 

 signage of an Italian fast-food restaurant. Expecting a huge explosion, the 

 pair take cover behind a metal dumpster.

Meanwhile, Peggy and Minh find a vendor who sells a papier-mache pear. The 

 vendor hands Peggy a nicely wrapped box and asks her to deliver it to a 

 friend just across the border. Peggy takes the package, but moments later, 

 Minh fears she has been tricked into transporting drugs.

Dale shows up at the condo unannounced, luggage in hand. Jacinto walks by 

 and notices the Hills living inside the upstairs unit. A few moments later, 

 the police arrive. Peggy, Bobby and Luanne panic, believing they are about 

 to be arrested. Hank tells police his family has nothing to hide... but 

 their actions hint otherwise. Hank, Dale and Kahn are brought before a 

 magistrate, who orders them to pay Jacinto 10,000 pesos. Their 

 identification is confiscated and will only be returned when the money is 

 paid. Believing the border guards will let them back into the U.S. because 

 they are Caucasian, Hank and Dale decide to head towards the checkpoint with 

 the Asian Kahn confined to the trunk. But the threesome panic at the border 

 crossing and run off. They trade their belongings for mopeds and make their 

 way to the Rio Grande. After crossing the river with a group of illegal 

 aliens, the men are spotted by border police. Dale jumps the border fence 

 and runs. Kahn also clears the fence, but Hank cannot do so unaided. Kahn 

 extends his hand and yanks him up and over. Kahn later muses how he, an 

 immigrant, helped smuggle an American into Texas.

Bobby decides he wants to be a stand-up comic after he accompanies Hank to 

 traffic school.

While backing out of the driveway, Hank collides with Kahn&apos;s car. An 

 insurance adjuster suggests that Hank attend traffic school in order to 

 avoid a rate increase. Hank picks the&quot;Defensive Driving School,&quot;in the 

 belief it will be devoid of frills and nonsense. But the class, it turns 

 out, is headed by an energetic African-American stand-up comic, Booda Sack.

Everyone in the class finds Booda&apos;s humor hysterically funny--all save Hank, 

 who is shocked and embarrassed by the content. When Hank returns home, he 

 tells his family about the comic. Bobby, a huge fan of Booda&apos;s humor, is 

 overjoyed. He tells his parents that Booda is one of the inspirations for 

 his wanting to become a stand-up comic. Hank warns his son that&quot;show 

 business is inherently evil,&quot;and to prove his point, allows Bobby to 

 accompany him to class. But the plan backfires when Booda brings Bobby 

 onstage and focuses his humor on Hank.

Bobby is so inspired by his experience on stage that he begins rehearsing 

 his own act, imitating Booda&apos;s African-American humor. The boy takes his 

 routine to Booda, who immediately points out to Bobby that he is not black 

 and should get in touch with his white roots. Inspired, Bobby turns to the 

 Internet, and inadvertently ends up on a Web site run by the Ku Klux Klan. 

 Meanwhile, Hank grows even more irritated at Booda&apos;s humor and files a 

 complaint with his supervisor, Mr. Johnson. Booda defends the humor in his 

 act, claiming it is freedom of speech. Hank&apos;s complaint costs Booda his job.

Bill and Dale drive Bobby to a downtown comedy club so he can try out his 

 new material. As a multi-ethnic crowd listens, Bobby tries out his act, 

 which draws its material from the White Nationalist Web site. The crowd 

 quickly grows angered. Hank learns from Boomhauer of his son&apos;s whereabouts 

 and drives to the comedy club. He rushes onstage to stop his son&apos;s act. 

 Booda Sack comes to Bobby&apos;s rescue. He points out that although the boy&apos;s 

 material is unfunny, it is protected by freedom of speech. When the crowd is 

 not satisfied by the explanation, Booda launches into his own routine, 

 causing the crowd to laugh once more. To show his gratitude, Hank gets Booda 

 a job at Strickland Propane.

Hank vehemently protests when a video store accuses him of not returning an 

 adult film.

Hank reacts with horror when he notices Peggy hanging his underwear on a 

 clothesline for all the world to see. Peggy explains she was forced to do so 

 because the dryer has broken down. Hank agrees the time has come to replace 

 the old unit. He and his family travel to the Mega Lo Mart, where Hank 

 lectures a salesman on the benefits of purchasing a propane-fueled dryer. 

 Peggy and Hank eventually settle on a Spinmore. When it comes time to make 

 the purchase, Peggy convinces her husband it is in their best interest to 

 pay for the dryer by applying for the store&apos;s credit card. But the salesman 

 informs the Hills that their application has been denied due to bad credit. 

 Hank discovers that the source of his problem is Arlen Video, which claims 

 Hank owes forty dollars for a tape that was never returned. At the store, a 

 clerk explains that computer records indicate the film in question is Cuffs&amp;Collars. Hank emphatically denies ever renting the tape and is horrified 

 to discover it is an adult title. Meanwhile, Bobby mistakes his parents 

 preoccupation with the matter as preparations for his upcoming birthday.

Peggy pressures her husband to pay the forty dollars so they can buy the 

 dryer. But Hank refuses, again insisting he never rented the tape. His 

 problems increase when his name ends up on a pornography mailing list and 

 adult paraphernalia begins arriving in quantity. An outraged Hank gathers 

 the materials and makes an attempt to return them to the post office. But 

 officials insist the source of the problem is the company from whom Hank 

 first purchased pornography. Hank travels to the municipal garbage dump 

 where he buries the adult materials in the trash. A police officer notices a 

 petroleum based byproduct amongst the materials and, noting it is being 

 disposed of illegally, demands to see Hank&apos;s license. Hank runs off. At his 

 wits&apos; end, Hank creates a petition that urges citizens to boycott Arlen 

 Video...only drawing further attention to his most embarrassing predicament.

Hank decides to put&quot;the system&quot;on trial by taking the video store to 

 court. A short time later, Hank receives a delivery of pornographic tapes. 

 An attached note, signed anonymously, states that,&quot;the answer is in the 

 tapes.&quot;Hank views the tapes, confident the answer does indeed lie within. 

 Later, in small claims court, Hank tells a judge he did not rent the tape. 

 To prove his case, Hank displays Polaroid photos of scenes from the movies. 

 He points out that an adult film star, Fernanda Valley, made a triumphant 

 return to her profession on the occasion of her eighteenth birthday. Valley 

 turned eighteen two weeks after Hank supposedly rented Cuffs&amp;Collars. The 

 judge agrees and rules in Hank&apos;s favor. Later, Bobby is overjoyed when he 

 sees the dryer being delivered, convinced it is his birthday present.

Cotton and Dale steal a famous prosthesis from a museum shortly before it is 

 scheduled to be returned to the Mexican government.

At the elementary school, Peggy fills in for Mrs. Dorland after she takes 

 ill. Her students reenact a battle from America&apos;s past, one in which the 

 Illinois Volunteer Infantry captured the artificial leg of Mexican General 

 Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna in 1847. When the reenactment ends, Peggy 

 explains that the general&apos;s prosthesis, which has been on display in an 

 Illinois museum for over a century, is about to be returned to Mexico by the 

 United States government. The leg is currently on tour and the Arlen museum 

 is its last stop in the U.S. Meanwhile, Cotton informs Hank that he and Didi 

 have split up for good. Since Didi had acted as his chauffeur, Cotton must 

 now pass an eye exam to renew his driver&apos;s license. Concerned that his 

 father would present a danger to the public, Hank deliberately sabotages his 

 father&apos;s efforts to recite a memorized eye chart during the test. Later, 

 when Cotton learns from Dale that his own son conspired against him, he 

 moves in with Dale and his family.

Dale is so flattered to have Cotton in his home that he creates a phony 

 driver&apos;s license for the old man. But Cotton&apos;s efforts behind the wheel land 

 him in trouble with the police. An officer gives Hank custody of Cotton, 

 believing he suffers from senile dementia. But when Hank drives Cotton back 

 to his house, he immediately hops out of the truck and goes to Dale&apos;s house. 

 Hank attempts to forge a reconciliation with Didi, who recalls how Cotton, a 

 lover of large rear ends, fell for her after catching a view of her 

 posterior magnified through an overturned jar. According to Didi, Cotton 

 broke up the relationship because her derriere is now too small. In an 

 attempt to win back his father, Hank asks Cotton to chaperone Bobby on a 

 museum trip. Flattered, Cotton takes up the offer. But Cotton grows angered 

 during the museum tour, insisting the old leg should never be returned to 

 Mexico. Later, he and Dale make off with the prosthesis.

Cotton believes the U.S. government will grant him his driver&apos;s license in 

 exchange for the leg. But when police arrive at Dale&apos;s house, they drag 

 Cotton away and place him in the psychiatric ward of a veteran&apos;s hospital. A 

 doctor informs Hank that if his father doesn&apos;t remain at the facility, he 

 will require round-the-clock supervision. Unwilling to allow his father to 

 rot away, Hank comes up with a plan. He brings Didi to the V.A. 

 hospital...and the couple fall in love all over again. Didi drives Cotton 

 back home. Later, Cotton stops by the Department of Motor Vehicles office in 

 Mexico...and trades the leg for a driver&apos;s license.

Luanne&apos;s mother is released from prison and becomes romantically involved 

 with Bill.

As Hank and Bobby proudly examine their new workbench inside the garage, 

 Luanne exclaims that her mother, Leanne, has been released from prison. When 

 Luanne is out of earshot, Peggy states that she will&quot;tongue-kiss Bill&quot;before she allows&quot;that tramp&quot;inside her home. A short time later, while 

 discussing the latest news about Leanne with his friends, Bill accidentally 

 drops a heavy table clamp on his foot. Hank pulls off Bill&apos;s sock, revealing 

 crusty yellow toenails underneath. Embarrassed, Bill decides to see a 

 doctor. Later, Peggy and Luanne discuss Leanne&apos;s past. Peggy warns that 

 Leanne betrayed her husband by skewering him with a fork. But Luanne 

 counters that her mother has given up drinking. Leanne is dropped off at the 

 Hill home by a burly female trucker. Mother and daughter excitedly embrace 

 one another, but Leanne receives a noticeably stiffer welcome from the 

 Hills.

When Hank avoids offering Leanne shelter, Luanne proposes quitting school so 

 she can find employment and rent an apartment with her mother. Unwilling to 

 let this happen, Peggy reluctantly offers Leanne a place to stay. Hank is 

 greatly annoyed when she transforms the garage into her new home. Meanwhile, 

 Bill&apos;s foot condition is diagnosed as a common fungus.

A nurse tells him the ailment can be cured with pills...but he must avoid 

 alcohol for them to be effective. A short time later, Bill encounters Leanne 

 inside the garage. The pair--neither of whom can drink alcohol--hit it off, 

 and the next morning Leanne and Bill stroll into the Hill kitchen dressed in 

 bathrobes. Hank and Peggy can only stare, horrified at the implication. As 

 an increasingly annoyed Peggy continues covering for Leanne whenever she 

 fails to pay her daughter the attention and love she deserves, the romance 

 between Bill and Leanne blossoms. But a hitch develops when Bill begins 

 spending his money on gifts for Leanne instead of purchasing foot 

 medication. One day, Leanne is repulsed at the sight of the yellow fungus on 

 her lover&apos;s toes. She grows so unhinged that she downs countless bottles of 

 beer, causing her expression to grow menacing. Hank discovers the emptied 

 bottles, but before he can offer a warning, Bill announces that he and 

 Leanne are engaged to be married. Angered that the secret has been revealed, 

 Leanne slugs Bill in the arm. Hank attempts to warn Bill about Leanne&apos;s 

 temper, but Bill reveals his love is moving into his home. Meanwhile, an 

 increasingly frustrated Peggy tells Luanne that the next time Leanne breaks 

 her heart, she will not come to her rescue. A short time later, the couple 

 throw a pre-engagement party. When Leanne shows up drunk and belligerent, a 

 desperate Luanne turns to Peggy. But as promised, Peggy turns away, leaving 

 Luanne alone. The situation reaches a crescendo when Buckley insults Leanne 

 as she gives him a lap dance. A furious Leanne grabs a fork, and just as she 

 is about to thrust it into Buckley, she is stopped by Peggy. An all-out 

 brawl ensues, during which Peggy gets the upper hand. Realizing she has been 

 defeated, Leanne tells her daughter they are leaving. But Luanne chooses to 

 remain behind with the Hills.

Hank inadvertently hires a drug addict to work at Strickland Propane.

Buck Strickland chooses Hank as Employee of the Month. A proud Hank accepts 

 the certificate, and shortly thereafter, Strickland asks him to hire a new 

 Accessories Associate. Hank immediately sets about creating a questionnaire 

 in the hopes of screening out undesirable applicants. After interviewing 

 several hopefuls, Hank meets with Maria Montalvo, a woman with both the best 

 credentials and an impressive knowledge of all things propane. But when 

 Maria admits she is unfamiliar with Troy Aikman, Hank has second thoughts 

 about hiring her.

Hank tells Peggy about Maria, describing her as handsome and well-qualified. 

 But he assures his wife that he will not hire Maria, as he is unsure what 

 constitutes inappropriate physical contact with a female employee. Peggy, 

 who believes Maria should be hired, shows Hank how to give a coworker an 

 appropriate hug. But Hank has his doubts, and later hires a seemingly 

 presentable young man named Leon Petard based on his familiarity with the 

 Dallas Cowboys and his apparent love for all things propane. When Peggy 

 learns that Hank passed over Maria in favor of Leon, she immediately 

 concludes that her husband was attracted to her.

The next day, Hank grows concerned when Leon shows up for work several hours 

 late. As time passes, Hank notices Leon acting in an agitated fashion and 

 becoming sick to his stomach. He asks Bobby to help him out at work and 

 cover for Leon. But after spending the day with the new employee, Bobby 

 tells his parents that Leon is a drug addict. Hank concurs with his son&apos;s 

 assessment. A short time later, Mr. Strickland notices Leon leaning against 

 a wall, giggling. A shocked Hank promises his boss the situation will 

 change. He makes good on his promise by informing Leon that Strickland 

 Propane does not tolerate drug addicts.

Hank fires Leon and hands him a business card containing the address of a 

 rehab center. The next morning, Leon returns, accompanied by Anthony Page, a 

 rehab group leader (whom Hank recognizes as Twig Boy). Page informs Hank 

 that firing Leon for drug addiction is illegal, as his condition is 

 considered a disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act.

Realizing he has little choice, Hank rehires Leon. Soon after, Page begins 

 making more demands. That night, Peggy reads aloud the Americans With 

 Disabilities Act literature, which states that any company with fifteen or 

 more employees must accommodate their disabled workers. The following day, 

 the other Strickland workers claim that they, too, are disabled, and deserve 

 special privileges. When Peggy shows up at the front office, she is 

 horrified by what she sees. She tells her husband that&quot;anybody&apos;s disabled 

 if you think hard enough.&quot;

Peggy&apos;s words prove an inspiration to Hank. Later, when Leon begins 

 referring to himself as&quot;Hank Hill,&quot;Hank uses it as a reason to quit. With 

 Hank gone, Strickland is reduced to fourteen employees, skirting the 

 Disabilities Act by one. Strickland promptly fires Leon. Later, Strickland 

 rehires Hank and places him on a six month probation period. Strickland then 

 introduces Hank to the company&apos;s new Accessories Associate, Maria Montalvo.

 strikes up a conversation with a soda boy named Tommy. Impressed by the 

 boy&apos;s&quot;can-do&quot;attitude, and hoping it will rub off on his son, Hank sets 

 about getting Bobby an interview with Tommy&apos;s boss, Jimmy Whichard. The 

 moment Bobby is hired, Tommy hands his drink tray to Bobby, hops a fence, 

 and runs away.

Bobby finds that life in the speedway stands is an arduous one. He also 

 discovers that Whichard is a crazed taskmaster. Meanwhile, Hank, Dale and 

 Bill run through some pit crew drills with Boomhauer, hoping to increase 

 their speed. When Bobby returns home from the track, he announces his 

 decision to quit his job, describing Whichard&apos;s cruel stupidity. But Hank 

 gives his son a pep talk, reminding him to give a hundred and ten percent. 

 When Bobby returns to work, he tells Whichard he will be the best employee 

 he has ever had. Whichard responds by promoting the boy as his&quot;go-to guy.&quot;Shortly thereafter, Boomhauer&apos;s big race gets under way. Hank, Dale and Bill 

 cheer him on from the sidelines. Boomhauer pulls into the pit and the three 

 men spring into action. Unfortunately, Bill pays too much attention to a 

 smudge on the vehicle&apos;s rear window and climbs into the back seat. Boomhauer 

 pulls onto the track where he is easily lapped by the other cars. Boomhauer 

 places fourth, but Hank reminds his friend he is only three accidents away 

 from driving the pace car. Meanwhile, Whichard forces Bobby to don a hot dog 

 suit. The drunken crowd pelts him mercilessly with trash.

As the NASCAR race gets under way, one amateur driver after another loses 

 control of the pace car. Meanwhile, Dale warns Hank that Jimmy Whichard is a 

 moron. Shortly thereafter, a thirsty Whichard calls to Bobby, who is selling 

 sodas in the infield from across the track. Whichard instructs Bobby to run 

 across the busy track and bring him the drink. Horrified, Hank races over 

 and pulls his son back over the guard rail. When Hank realizes Whichard put 

 Bobby&apos;s life in jeopardy, he runs across the track and confronts him. But 

 Hank is unable to clear a fence that separates himself from Whichard. 

 Suddenly, Whichard is pelted with sodas and hot dogs. It turns out that many 

 of his former exploited child workers are sitting in the stands. Meanwhile, 

 another accident gives Boomhauer his big chance. But once on the track, 

 Boomhauer slows down until his car is even with the racer driven by Jeff 

 Gordon. Gordon cannot resist temptation, and races Boomhauer down the track. 

 Though Gordon wins the race, he is automatically disqualified for passing 

 the pace car. Driver Dale Earnhardt takes home the trophy. Later, Hank 

 apologizes to Bobby for ignoring what he said about Whichard.

 Instead, Hank tears through the chain link fence and kicks him around a bit. 

 The Boomhauer/Gordon race is also cut out. 34. Peggy&apos;s Turtle Song gs : Tammy Wynette (Tilly Hill) 
Peggy quits her job as substitute teacher and takes up guitar lessons; Bobby 

 is diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.

One morning, as Bobby finishes eating a bowl of Oatmeal Cookie Crunch in the 

 kitchen, a harried Peggy rushes in, glances at the clock, and realizes she 

 is late for a school field trip. Peggy hastily pours him another bowl of 

 cereal... onto which Bobby adds more sugar. A short time later, Bobby has 

 another bowl, and at Hank&apos;s suggestion, adds even more sugar. At school, a 

 teacher notices Bobby acting in a hyperactive manner (the result of 

 consuming the sugar). Bobby is sent to the nurse&apos;s office, where he is 

 diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. A nurse informs Hank that Bobby 

 must begin taking medication. Later, Peggy suffers enormous guilt when she 

 hears the news, and decides to quit her job as a substitute teacher so she 

 can focus her energy on being a mother.

The medication prescribed Bobby leaves the boy in a stupor. Meanwhile, Peggy 

 accompanies Hank to a guitar shop to pick up some new strings. There, she 

 notices a flyer advertising guitar lessons. The next day, Peggy visits the 

 bohemian apartment of Emily, a woman with dreadlocks, a tattoo and combat 

 boots. When Emily later visits the Hill home to teach the guitar lessons, 

 Bill notes she is dressed&quot;kinda pro-choice.&quot;Hank looks on with concern. 

 Later, Emily encourages Peggy to write a song of her own. Peggy responds by 

 singing a few lines about a turtle and its shell, which is both the animal&apos;s 

 home and its prison. Emily immediately responds to the song, reading 

 something into it that Peggy did not quite intend. Though Hank labels Emily&quot;weird,&quot;Peggy nonetheless invites her over for dinner. During the meal, 

 Peggy reveals that one of Hank&apos;s most cherished possessions is a Guild Solid 

 Top guitar, nicknamed Betsy. Emily encourages Peggy to finish writing her 

 song and suggests she perform it at a Mother&apos;s Day recital, during which 

 performers take a&quot;pot shot&quot;at the holiday. Hank disapproves of the idea, 

 insisting plans for Mother&apos;s Day have already been made. But Peggy insists 

 she can do as she pleases.

Luanne complains she is unable to concentrate on studying for her beauty 

 exam. Concluding she may have contracted attention deficit disorder from 

 Bobby, she snatches a pill from the boy&apos;s hand and pops it in her mouth. On 

 Mother&apos;s Day, Hank watches as Peggy heads out the door with her cheap guitar 

 slung over her shoulder. Later, Bobby and Hank show up at the venue where 

 Peggy is scheduled to perform. Bobby hands his mother Betsy, Hank&apos;s prized 

 guitar, explaining how she should have a special guitar with which to play 

 her song.

Peggy takes the stage and performs. As she sings, the women in the audience 

 misread the turtle song as a pro-feminist statement. Peggy stops singing, 

 but Emily encourages her to continue. Singing from her heart, Peggy tells 

 how&quot;a turtle named Hank&quot;saved the turtle&apos;s heart with the magic of love. 

 Though the women in the audience are taken aback by the song&apos;s ending, Hank 

 and Bobby give Peggy a standing ovation. Later, during the drive home, Peggy 

 considers returning to her teaching job. When Hank notes a marked 

 improvement in Bobby&apos;s behavior that day, Bobby explains it can only be 

 attributed to the absence of the medication, as Luanne ingested his pill.
  
 b : 10-May-1998 pc : 5E22 w : Brent Forrester d : Jeff Myers   35. Propane Boom (1) gs : Chuck Mangione (Himself) 
Hank loses his job when Strickland Propane is unable to compete with Mega Lo 

 Mart.

While watching television, Hank sees a commercial featuring Mega Lo Mart 

 spokesman Chuck Mangione as he announces that the store is now selling 

 propane. Hank can hardly contain his anger. The next morning, Mr. Strickland 

 tells his employees that, although the company cannot compete with Mega Lo 

 Mart&apos;s prices, they can deliver a personal touch, a program dubbed&quot;Service 

 With a Hug.&quot;But the stunt does little to keep Strickland&apos;s customers from 

 straying. One evening, as Hank and Peggy lie in bed, Luanne asks if she can 

 borrow three hundred dollars to pay her tuition at the beauty academy. Hank 

 approves the loan. But the following day, Mr. Strickland tells Hank he is 

 closing the local branch in a desperate effort to save the entire company.

Furious at Mega Lo Mart for costing him his job, Hank begins discarding 

 everything and anything purchased at the store. Meanwhile, Luanne realizes 

 the promised $300 loan is no more, jeopardizing her dream of becoming a 

 famous Hollywood makeup artist. Desperate for work, Hank begins perusing the&quot;help wanted&quot;classified ads. Answering one such ad, he finds himself inside 

 the conference room of a roadside motel. But when he realizes that the job 

 is selling steak knives, he rejects the offer. When a weary and tired Hank 

 returns home, he notices Luanne studying a book about propane. Luanne 

 explains that she has decided to apply for a job selling propane at Mega Lo 

 Mart (Buckley, a store employee, promised her the job) so she can pay for 

 her education. Hank disapproves of the idea and storms off. But the pressure 

 on Hank proves too much to bear, and when Luanne walks into the Mega Lo Mart 

 to take the propane test, she discovers that Buckley hired Hank for the job.

Hank apologizes to Luanne for taking the job, telling her he could not stand 

 another moment of being stuck at home watching daytime television. But 

 Luanne vents her rage using some of the Manger Baby puppets, and later 

 decides to break up with Buckley. Back at the Mega Lo Mart, Hank discovers 

 that two of his coworkers, Mark and Ray, were also forced out of their old 

 jobs due to competition from the discount store. A bond forms between the 

 men, especially when they come under attack from much younger employees who 

 hold positions of authority. Later, Hank spots Buckley dragging a propane 

 tank across the floor by the valve.

He warns Buckley that doing so could trigger a gas leak. Buckley changes the 

 subject, telling Hank he was supposed to set up Chuck Mangione&apos;s dressing 

 room for a performance in the store&apos;s parking lot. A short time later, Hank 

 talks Ray, Mark and another worker into disrupting the concert by blowing 

 kazoos. When Mangione takes the stage, Hank enters the store&apos;s break room to 

 retrieve something more powerful than a kazoo--an air horn. But while 

 walking towards the store&apos;s exit, Hank stops and sniffs the air. His eyes 

 widen in horror.

Suddenly, a huge explosion rips through the store, engulfing Mangione in a 

 fireball. As debris rains down from the heavens, Boomhauer dials 911 for 

 help. To Be Continued...

 was part of a mock promotion by FOX to move the setting of the show to

 Season 3 
 36. Death of a Propane Salesman (2) gs : Chuck Mangione (Himself) 
In the aftermath of the Mega Lo Mart explosion...Hank discovers he is 

 frightened of propane; Luanne grapples with the loss of her hair and a close 

 friend.

As firemen sift through burning rubble of what once was the Mega Lo Mart, 

 Peggy searches for any sign of her loved ones. A fireman emerges from the 

 flames, escorting Hank and Luanne to safety. Luanne screams when she 

 realizes the fire singed away her hair. Shortly thereafter, Chuck Mangione 

 emerges from the building, smoldering but apparently unharmed. Hank turns to 

 a fireman and inquires about Buckley. He learns that no one else survived 

 the explosion. Luanne, however, is more concerned about her hair. Later, 

 when Hank is released from the hospital, he is anxious for his life to 

 return to normal. When Luanne is released, she announces that beauty is only 

 temporary, and tosses away her beauty supplies. Later, as Hank and his 

 buddies drink beer, Dale states that Buckley&apos;s death is part of a 

 conspiracy. The next morning, Mr. Strickland phones the Hill residence, 

 anxious for Hank&apos;s return. Strickland believes that Hank deliberately 

 triggered the explosion in an effort to save his propane business. At dinner 

 time, Hank discovers that he is unable to approach his backyard grill, as he 

 is haunted by the explosion at the Mega Lo Mart.

Luanne&apos;s friends at the beauty academy fashion a wig to cover her singed 

 scalp. But Luanne hands the wig to Peggy, insisting she throw it away. 

 Later, mourners gather at Arlen cemetery to pay Buckley their last respects. 

 During the service, Luanne unfurls a rolled-up poster of Bobby in his 

 underwear, and speaks out against hunger in Ireland. Shortly thereafter, 

 Kahn delivers a poignant Buddhist story that relates to Buckley&apos;s death. But 

 the mourners are unsure what to make of the tale, and dismiss it as a joke. 

 Later, Peggy realizes the horrible truth: her husband is afraid of propane. 

 She turns to a grief counselor, who concludes that Hank is really afraid of 

 death. Hank dismisses the idea, but later, as he sips beer with his buddies, 

 he raises the issue. Bobby overhears the conversation, and concludes that 

 his father is still not himself. Shortly thereafter, he runs away from home.

An anxious Hank hopes that Ladybird will be able to pick up Bobby&apos;s scent. 

 Meanwhile, Kahn tires of Luanne&apos;s fixation on starving Irish children. He 

 wonders why she does not share his remorse over Buckley&apos;s loss. Luanne 

 enters the den, where she discovers a birthday card sent to her from 

 Buckley. She is suddenly overwhelmed with grief. Using her hand puppets, she 

 works through her emotional crisis and eventually dons the wig. Later, Hank 

 finds Bobby sitting in the playground. Hank tells his son that he shouldn&apos;t 

 obsess over death. He encourages him to relax and enjoy life. Suddenly, Hank 

 hears and understands his own words. He then attempts to repeat Kahn&apos;s 

 eulogy story...as only Hank Hill could.

NOTE: This episode was supposed to be scheduled on September 8. But it was 

 postponed due to the Cubs vs. Cardinals baseball game on FOX. 37. They Call It Bobby Love gs : Sarah Michelle Gellar (Marie) Chuck Mangione (Himself) 
Bobby falls head over heels for a classmate. Hank and his friends discover 

 an abandoned couch in the alleyway where they normally stand and drink beer.

Hank and his friends are dumbstruck by the sudden appearance of an abandoned 

 couch, sitting right in the very spot where they normally stand in the 

 common alley. An outraged Hank telephones the City and demands that the 

 furniture be removed. But when the City fails to respond after a reasonable 

 length of time, Hank declares that the group should move it themselves. 

 Before the men take action, however, Bill sits down on the soft couch. He&apos;s 

 soon joined by the other men, who come to realize they can now drink beer, 

 chat and be comfortable, all at the same time.

As Bobby makes his way through the hallways of Tom Landry Middle School, he 

 encounters a fifteen-year-old student named Marie, who is acting as hall 

 monitor. Knowing he is late for class, Bobby tells her his name is&quot;Ramon 

 Tavares&quot;in hopes of evading detention. Marie laughs at Bobby&apos;s ploy and 

 sends him on his way. As time passes, Marie grows more and more enamored of 

 Bobby&apos;s clownish antics. As their friendship grows, Marie tells Bobby that 

 she is a vegetarian. Bobby decides to follow suit. As Bobby and Marie walk 

 down the common alley one evening, they discover the couch. The pair sit 

 down, and soon after, Marie pulls Bobby close and kisses him. Bobby, 

 somewhat nervous at first, kisses her back. But suddenly, Marie breaks the 

 kiss and walks off. The next morning, Bobby tells his parents about his new 

 girlfriend.

Bobby grows more and more infatuated with Marie. But the more he pursues his 

 love, the more she pulls away. Meanwhile, Kahn finds Hank and his friends 

 sitting on the couch in the common alley. He explains that it was he who 

 abandoned the furniture, as it is rife with cat urine. But this does not 

 faze the others, who have gone so far as to have installed beer can holders 

 into the couch&apos;s arms. One evening, Marie stops by the Hill residence and 

 picks up Bobby. They travel to a party, where Bobby grows sickened by the 

 sight of Marie dancing with other boys. Marie tells Bobby that they are just 

 friends...and are not a serious romantic couple. Bobby is devastated by the&quot;break up&quot;and bursts into tears. At first, Bobby tries to change Marie&apos;s 

 mind by behaving in a clownlike manner. But when Marie continues to rebuff 

 his advances, Bobby sinks into a deep depression. Later, Hank and Peggy take 

 Bobby to a steak house where, as luck would have it, Marie and her parents 

 are also dining. Bobby deliberately orders the largest steak on the menu, 

 one that, if consumed in an hour, is free of charge. As the vegetarian Marie 

 looks on in anger, Bobby downs every last morsel of the 72 ounce slab of 

 beef. Marie storms off in disgust. Afterwards, as Connie looks on, Bobby 

 doubles over and vomits.
  
 b : 22-Sep-1998 pc : 3ABE01 w : Norm Hiscock   38. Peggy&apos;s Headache   
Peggy is shocked when she learns of the affair between Nancy and John 

 Redcorn.

Peggy cheerfully greets Dale and John Redcorn one morning as she picks up 

 the Arlen Bystander off the street. After Dale drives off in his van, 

 Redcorn pulls out his own set of keys and unlocks the door to the Gribble 

 house. He covers for his action by claiming he is dropping off a healing 

 herb to Nancy and Peggy is none the wiser. Later, Peggy is stunned to read 

 that humorist Doyle Harcavy, whose column is published in the Bystander, is 

 retiring. Luanne encourages her to write the column herself. Shortly 

 thereafter, Peggy sets about writing her own musings. But Hank&apos;s constant 

 interruptions trigger a headache. Peggy walks next door for some peace and 

 quiet. There she finds Redcorn and Nancy together in the bedroom, but she 

 again fails to deduce that the two are having an affair. Instead, she asks 

 for Redcorn&apos;s help in alleviating her headache. At Redcorn&apos;s trailer, Peggy 

 receives a well-needed massage, which causes her to relax. Her headache 

 subsides. Meanwhile, Dale tells Hank about Peggy visiting Redcorn in his 

 trailer. Fearing the worst, Hank warns Redcorn to stay away from his wife. 

 Later, when Peggy announces that she was chosen to replace Doyle Harcavy, 

 Hank assumes her headaches will be gone for good. But Peggy assures him she 

 will be visiting Redcorn on a regular basis to help her cope with weekly 

 writing deadlines. A frustrated Hank tells his wife about the affair between 

 Nancy and Redcorn. Peggy gasps.

Peggy confronts Nancy about her affair, referring to her as a&quot;dirty bird.&quot;Later, Hank, Bill and Boomhauer drink beer in front of Bill&apos;s house, where 

 they discuss the affair. Unable to find his friends, Dale drops by the Hill 

 home, where he encounters Peggy. She compliments him on his looks and 

 invites him inside for some pie. Mistaking the friendly invitation for a 

 sexual advance, Dale beats a hasty retreat. A short time later, Peggy 

 realizes she has no enthusiasm for her musings column, wondering aloud how 

 she is supposed to appreciate the little things in life knowing Nancy is 

 cheating on her husband. Hank and Peggy join Dale and Nancy at the baseball 

 field. But Peggy finds she can barely contain her disgust in their presence. 

 Afterward, Peggy tells Hank that she plans on telling Dale about the affair.

Hank attempts to change Peggy&apos;s mind, but she remains determined, explaining 

 how she cannot live her life until the secret is exposed. She uses her 

 musings column to indirectly communicate with those who are aware of the 

 situation, announcing her intention to expose the affair. When Nancy refuses 

 to tell Dale the truth, Peggy pushes past her, intending to do it herself. 

 When her indirect attempts to make Dale see the light fail, Peggy sees how 

 truly loving Dale is to his son and realizes how exposing the truth will 

 shatter the family. Peggy has a change of heart, and decides the matter is 

 best left unsaid.

NOTE: This episode is a turning point in the series&apos; run: First of all, we 

 see the beginning of the end for John and Nancy&apos;s affair, as the pressure 

 finally gives in. Second, this is the first time we realize that Peggy is 

 not as bright as once presumed, but she that is merely ego-driven. 39. Pregnant Paws gs : John Ashton ((voice)) 
Hank decides to breed Ladybird. Dale applies for a bounty hunter&apos;s license.

Hank is aghast to discover Ladybird walking outside the house wearing a pair 

 of his old underwear. Peggy explains that the dog is in heat. Hank decides 

 it is time to breed the animal before it is too late. He pairs Ladybird with 

 one of Mr. Strickland&apos;s males. Afterward, Hank and Peggy bring Ladybird to a 

 veterinarian&apos;s office...where they are informed that the union was 

 unsuccessful due to the dog&apos;s narrow uterus. Hank recalls a similar 

 situation some fourteen years earlier, when he and Peggy were trying to 

 conceive. At the time, Dr. Rubin informed Hank that he and Peggy were unable 

 to have children due to Hank&apos;s narrow urethra, the result of years of 

 chronic tension. But Hank receives new hope about Ladybird when two fellow 

 dog owners fill him in on all the latest techniques for impregnating an 

 animal.

Meanwhile, Dale encounters a bounty hunter at the Arlen shooting range. 

 Enticed by the man&apos;s stylish hat, which reads&quot;Bounty Hunter,&quot;Dale decides 

 to enroll in a four-hour training course so he, too, can&quot;hunt humans.&quot;After Dale successfully completes the course, he receives his first 

 assignment from a bail bondsman: tracking a fugitive named Jimmy Helstrom, 

 who is wanted for a series of unpaid parking violations.

As Hank spends more and more time attempting to impregnate Ladybird, Peggy 

 grows irritable. In flashback, Peggy recalls how Hank refused to consider 

 artificial insemination when they were trying to conceive. Instead, Hank 

 gave up on the notion of having children altogether and did the next best 

 thing: he purchased a puppy and named it Ladybird. Meanwhile, Dale finds his 

 prey holed up in a remote cabin. His efforts to apprehend the fugitive fail 

 when a pack of snarling guard dogs blocks his path. Thinking quickly, Dale 

 dognaps Ladybird and uses her to distract the vicious canines. The ploy 

 works and Dale comes face to face with the armed fugitive. Unfortunately, 

 both men panic and throw down their weapons, resulting in a stand-off. Hank 

 discovers Ladybird is missing...and finds Dale&apos;s note detailing the dog&apos;s 

 whereabouts. Hank and Peggy rush to the cabin, where they find a dehydrated 

 Ladybird sitting in Dale&apos;s truck surrounded by the vicious dogs. The couple 

 has a heated discussion, during which Peggy mentions she might want another 

 child. Hank reflects on events that transpired fourteen years earlier, and 

 realizes the puppy relaxed him to the point where his narrow urethra opened, 

 allowing the couple to conceive. Hank realizes that he, too, would like 

 another child. The pair rescues Ladybird and returns home, where they roll 

 around on the floor as they had fourteen years earlier. Meanwhile, the 

 stand-off between Dale and the fugitive ends when they compliment each 

 other&apos;s hats. Shortly thereafter, they retire to the living room, where they 

 sit on the couch and watch television.

 Hank that a dalmatian dog can be scary, and Peggy adds,&quot;Nine times out of 

 ten they go right for the groin.&quot; 40. Next of Shin   
Cotton drops a bombshell when he announces that Didi is pregnant.

Peggy fails her twelfth home pregnancy test, prompting her to mention a 

 fertility specialist to Hank. At first, Hank protests, as he would rather 

 not be nude in front of a doctor. But Peggy informs him that the entire 

 procedure can take place using an MRI machine. Later, Dr. Bhudamanjur 

 informs Hank he suffers from a low sperm count. As heat kills sperm, the 

 doctor recommends several techniques to lower Hank&apos;s body temperature. Hank 

 follows the doctor&apos;s advice, but soon suffers great embarrassment when more 

 and more of his friends become aware of the situation. As time passes, Peggy 

 takes another pregnancy test, but she is again negative. Shortly thereafter, 

 Cotton pays the Hills a surprise visit...and announces that Didi is 

 pregnant. Hank and Peggy are stunned.

Preparing for the inevitable, Hank, Peggy, Cotton and Didi visit a large 

 baby store. But Cotton&apos;s mind begins playing tricks on him, and he imagines 

 the babies as German and Japanese soldiers advancing through the store. He 

 tells the others he will wait outside the store until they&apos;re through. 

 Afterward, Cotton brings Bobby to a bar and tells him about Hank and Peggy&apos;s 

 plans for having another baby. Later, Bobby tells his father his reasons for 

 not wanting a sibling. Their conversation is interrupted by Didi, who 

 announces that Cotton has run off. Cotton leaves a message on the Hill&apos;s 

 answering machine, confirming his intention to leave Didi and the newborn 

 behind. Bobby then dials&quot;Star69,&quot;and determines that his grandfather fled 

 to Las Vegas.

Aided by Dale and Bill, Hank sets off for Las Vegas. There the threesome 

 visit every strip club in town, but their search is unsuccessful. Hank 

 discovers Cotton sitting at a craps table (with the aid of a booster seat) 

 inside a casino. He tells his father that he and Peggy have given up on the 

 idea of having another baby, as it would upset Bobby too much. Hank then 

 tells his father that&quot;he wins.&quot;But Cotton insists he was never in 

 competition with Hank to begin with...and that Hank has always been the 

 better father. Cotton then agrees to return home. But first, Cotton insists 

 they have a night of fun in Las Vegas.

Peggy enters a beauty contest in the hopes of winning a pickup truck. But 

 she soon discovers that her competition is more formidable than she ever 

 imagined.

Nancy Gribble informs Peggy that officials from the&quot;Mrs. Heimlich County&quot;beauty pageant have asked her to act as a celebrity judge. At first, Peggy 

 wonders aloud if any mature women would really participate in such an event. 

 But her skepticism evaporates when she realizes the grand prize is a brand 

 new pickup truck with a 5.4 liter V8 engine. That night, Peggy asks Hank if 

 he thinks she could win the beauty contest. Hank delicately explains that he 

 doesn&apos;t think his wife is the&quot;pageant type.&quot;Peggy, however, is not to be 

 dissuaded, and she fills out the entry form. The next morning, Luanne 

 screams with delight when she realizes she will be styling a beauty pageant 

 contestant. The pair travel to the Arlen Hotel, where contestants mingle 

 with their competition. It doesn&apos;t take long for Peggy to realize that many 

 of the other women look unbeatable.

Peggy approaches Nancy and compliments her on her looks. Peggy digs herself 

 a deep hole when she states that women should be judged by their brain size, 

 not their bra size. Nancy takes this as an insult and walks off. The next 

 morning, Peggy and Luanne visit Mr. Strickland in hopes of convincing him to 

 sponsor Peggy in the contest. Strickland, believing that Luanne is the 

 contestant, quickly agrees to write a check for $2000. By the time 

 Strickland realizes his mistake, the check has already been drafted. Later, 

 Peggy tells Luanne she would like some highlights in her hair. Luanne is 

 somewhat hesitant, as she missed both parts of the highlights class. She 

 forges ahead nonetheless. When Peggy emerges from the house the next 

 morning, her hair sports hideous orange tiger stripes. That night, Peggy 

 tells Hank that her relations with Nancy have hit an all-time low. Hank 

 reluctantly brings Dale a plate full of brownies in hopes of making amends. 

 As the contest draws near, Luanne discovers a woman named Marci teasing 

 Peggy&apos;s hair in front of a vanity table. Luanne concludes that a mistake has 

 been made. But Peggy explains that she needs Marci&apos;s professional skills if 

 she hopes to win. Peggy arrives home sporting a complete makeover. Hank and 

 Bobby stare at the results, their mouths agape. Ladybird does not recognize 

 Peggy and begins barking at her.

Hank dislikes his wife&apos;s new appearance, but is careful not to say anything 

 that might offend her. Later, Peggy is interviewed by three contest judges: 

 Nancy Gribble, a Spanish man and an uptight older woman. The Spanish judge 

 reads Peggy&apos;s application, and notes that she speaks fluent Spanish. 

 Speaking quickly, he asks her a complex question regarding the information 

 superhighway. After a long pause, Peggy responds by saying&quot;si.&quot;As Peggy 

 prepares to join her fellow contestants in the pageant, she suddenly worries 

 about her hind end looking too big. With some help from Marci and Mr. 

 Strickland, Peggy uses duct tape to fix the problem. As a stage manager 

 directs the contestants to cross a street, the duct tape gives way, causing 

 Peggy&apos;s buttocks to droop one at a time. A furious Peggy berates Strickland 

 for purchasing cheap tape. At that moment, Hank pulls up in a sparkling 

 white truck. He tells his wife that since she entered the contest to win a 

 truck, he thought he would save her the trouble. As it turns out, the 

 vehicle is actually his old truck, now sporting a new paint job.

On the day after Thanksgiving, Hank attends a lawn mower focus group.

Hank and his buddies discuss attending an upcoming focus group run by the 

 manufacturer of Hank&apos;s favorite lawn mower, the Mason 1500. Hank believes 

 that the mower is one focus group away from being emasculated. Shortly 

 thereafter, Hank turns his attention to Thanksgiving dinner. He is thankful 

 that his mother, Tilly, could join the family for the celebration. But 

 Hank&apos;s happiness is short-lived: Cotton and Didi drop by unexpectedly. Hank 

 reminds his father that according to the rotation schedule, it is Tilly&apos;s 

 turn to spend Thanksgiving with the family. Cotton promises not to&quot;make a 

 fuss,&quot;but he manages to ruin the holiday nonetheless by insulting Tilly 

 repeatedly. That night, Peggy makes final preparations to awaken in the wee 

 hours of the morning so she can beat other shoppers to the holiday bargains. 

 When the time arrives, Cotton, Didi and Tilly accompany the Hills to the 

 mall. But the rubber sole on Peggy&apos;s shoe comes loose. As the shoe is being 

 repaired, Peggy falls asleep. Meanwhile, Hank and his friends make their way 

 to a conference room beneath the mall. There they are greeted by Jonathan 

 Burrows, the group moderator. To Hank&apos;s disappointment, Cotton joins the 

 group. As the focus group gets under way, Burrows pulls a tarp off of a lawn 

 mower, revealing the Mason 5500, which resembles a futuristic concept car. 

 Hank is aghast.

Hank tells his friends that the new, yuppified machine is his worst 

 nightmare come true. But the other members of the group are swayed by the 

 mower&apos;s many options, such as the electric seat warmer and cup holder. 

 Hank&apos;s anger rises when Burrows describes the 1500 model as&quot;obsolete.&quot;Cotton agrees with this assessment, and suggests his son&quot;trade up.&quot;Hank 

 accuses Cotton of&quot;trading up&quot;Tilly for Didi. But Cotton insists he&quot;scrapped&quot;Tilly outright. Hank addresses the group, insisting he will not 

 be swayed by its bells and whistles. But when Burrows asks for a show of 

 hands, all of the men in the focus group,save Hank, indicate their approval 

 of the machine. Meanwhile, at the mall&apos;s ice skating rink, Bobby encourages 

 Luanne to put Buckley behind her and get on with her life.

Hank decides to defend his prized mower. He addresses each of the new 

 model&apos;s options. He tells Lane, a car dealer, that he would be paying for 

 the mark-up out his own pocket. Lane changes his vote. Hank then addresses 

 Boomhauer, who liked the seatwarmer option. Hank points out that Boomer 

 always rests his beer between his legs, which would cause the drink to warm. 

 Boomhauer changes his vote. The paranoid Dale also changes his vote when he 

 realizes that corporate executives are observing the group from behind a 

 one-way mirror. Hank wins more converts to his side when he demonstrates 

 that the mower&apos;s zero turning radius can cause it to crash. Cotton is the 

 last holdout. The old man again berates Tilly, unaware that she is observing 

 from the other side of the one-way mirror. An angry Hank defends his mother, 

 and threatens to ban Cotton from his home should he ever again speak of her 

 in a disparaging manner. Frustrated, Cotton waddles out of the room. 

 Afterward, Hank asks Tilly if she has thought about what she wants for 

 Christmas. Tilly tells her son that he has given her enough already.

Hank prepares Bobby for a deerhunting trip as part of his initiation into 

 manhood.

As Hank and his friends make final preparations to take their children on a 

 deerhunting trip, Hank admits to Peggy that he has yet to purchase Bobby&apos;s 

 hunting permit. As the conversation progresses, Hank admits he is frightened 

 of being alone with his son, as he sometimes uncertain what the boy is 

 talking about. Hank declares that he has one last errand to run before the 

 journey gets under way. He drives to the county office to purchase the 

 hunting permit. But a clerk informs him that no more licenses will be sold, 

 due to an agreement with environmentalists. An angered Hank returns home. As 

 his neighbors and their children head off for the hunt, Hank pulls into his 

 own driveway and parks.

Bobby creates a deer out of cardboard and uses it for target practice. Hank 

 and Peggy notice this, and grow concerned that their boy may descend into 

 madness if he fails to achieve manhood by killing an animal. Later, Hank 

 encounters Eustis at Strickland Propane. Eustis shows him a brochure for a 

 private hunting reserve called the LaGrunta Hotel and Resort. Eustis 

 explains that he is taking his son Randy to the reserve for his rite of 

 passage, as the company takes care of guns, permits and the like. Shortly 

 thereafter, the Gribbles, the Souphanousinphones and other neighbors return 

 home with their kill. Bobby begins crying, as all of his friends have shot a 

 deer. Hank decides a trip to LaGrunta is in order.

When Hank and his son arrive at LaGrunta, they are directed to a shooting 

 stand in the woods. As the pair await their prey, an automatic feed spreader 

 whirrs into action, and deer emerge from the forest. But Bobby and Hank 

 realize there is no sport in killing an animal in such a fashion, and they 

 leave the resort empty handed. On the drive home, Hank decides it&apos;s time for 

 Bobby to try his hand behind the wheel. Bobby climbs into the driver&apos;s seat 

 and navigates a deserted road. Suddenly, a deer bolts in front of the truck. 

 Bobby slams on the brakes, but it is too late, and the animal dies. Hank 

 congratulates his son, as it is a&quot;clean kill.&quot;

Bill becomes suicidal when the Christmas holiday reminds him of his breakup 

 with Lenore.

Hank and Peggy sit at the kitchen table reviewing their Christmas party 

 lists. Hank tells Peggy that Bill will arrive without a date--prompting 

 Peggy to fear that Bill will once again spend the entire party crying over 

 Lenore. Later that day, as Hank and his friends drink beer in the common 

 alley, Bill begins to sob. He tells the others that although he loves 

 Christmas, the holiday marks the anniversary of his breakup with Lenore 

 seven years earlier. Hank follows Bill home, where he finds presents wrapped 

 with fading paper. Bill admits that he has been saving the gifts for 

 Lenore&apos;s return. That night, Bill joins the Hill family for dinner. He 

 raises the subject of breakups, causing Luanne, Bobby and even Peggy to 

 experience unpleasant memories. The next morning Bobby and Peggy ask Hank 

 why Bill is allowed to ruin their dinners. Hank explains that some twenty 

 years ago, Bill&apos;s blocking allowed him to set Arlen High School&apos;s single 

 season rushing record. And for that, Hank will be forever grateful. The next 

 day, Bill arrives at the Hill home in the company of his new pet iguana, 

 which he has named Lenore. Bill places a half-dead roach on the dinner table 

 and watches as Lenore gobbles up her meal. That night, Peggy tells Hank that 

 Bill is no longer welcome at the dinner table. A few days before Christmas, 

 Hank tells his friend that he and his family are dining by themselves. 

 Miserable, Bill borrows Hank&apos;s ladder, climbs onto his own rooftop, and then 

 jumps. The drop, however, is only about eight feet, and he survives.

Hank fears that Bill may find a more effective way of committing suicide. He 

 devises a schedule so that Bill will be under constant watch. He, Dale and 

 Boomhauer take turns monitoring Bill&apos;s every move in case of trouble. Bill 

 attempts halfheartedly to do himself in on several more occasions, but he 

 fails. The schedule interferes with Hank&apos;s much-needed rest. Hank asks Peggy 

 if she can find a date for Bill. Peggy invites Mrs. Tobias to join Bill and 

 the family for dinner. But Mrs. Tobias quickly concludes that Bill has gone 

 over the edge. Hank eventually loses his patience. He enters Bill&apos;s home and 

 begins destroying the old gifts meant for Lenore. Bill is numbed by the 

 experience, though he assures Hank he is perfectly fine. Hank returns home, 

 where he finds Lenore the iguana perched atop the refrigerator. Hank carries 

 the creature into Bill&apos;s backyard, where he encounters a woman hanging 

 clothes on a line. When the woman turns around, Hank realizes, to his 

 horror, that it is actually Bill in a dress.

Speaking in a falsetto voice, Bill assures Hank that he is actually Lenore. 

 Hank turns and walks away, warning Bill not to show up for the party. But on 

 Christmas Eve, Bill arrives at the affair wearing a dress, hat and necklace. 

 Hank gasps at the sight. He then instructs Bill to leave the house at once. 

 But Bill remains, insisting that Lenore loves a party. Just then the real 

 Lenore telephones the Hill residence. But before Peggy has a chance to hand 

 Bill the phone, Lenore hangs up. Bill breaks down, sobbing. The party-goers 

 turn vicious and begin insulting Bill. Suddenly, Hank emerges from the 

 bedroom wearing a dress. Bill runs outside, and Hank follows. Pretending to 

 be Lenore, Hank tells Bill he no longer loves him. Bill gets angry and tells&quot;Lenore&quot;to get out of his life. With that, Hank removes the dress. A few 

 moments pass, and Bill removes his dress as well. He returns to his senses, 

 telling Hank he hit&quot;rock bottom&quot;for a while. With that, Hank wishes Bill a&quot;Merry Christmas.&quot;

Hank and his friends become volunteer firefighters--with disastrous 

 consequences.

In the present day, Hank, Dale, Bill and Boomhauer meet with the Heimlich 

 County fire chief inside an interrogation room. The fire chief warns the men 

 that they are all in serious trouble. As the story unfolds in flashback, 

 Hank, Dale and Boomhauer watch as Heck Dorland drives a fire truck towards 

 the common alley. Bill, wearing a fireman&apos;s helmet, hops off the vehicle and 

 proudly exclaims that is now a firefighter. Heck explains to the men that 

 the professional firefighters are on strike--leaving the city&apos;s defense in 

 the hands of volunteers. He asks Hank and his friends if they are interested 

 in joining. The three men, in ecstasy, run towards the truck. Later, as 

 Peggy fixes dinner, Hank enters the house wearing a fireman&apos;s helmet. When 

 Luanne excitedly expresses her desire to become a firefighter, Hank insists 

 she isn&apos;t strong enough to carry a large man out of a burning building. 

 Peggy disagrees. She demonstrates a&quot;fireperson&apos;s carry,&quot;which allows a 

 woman to lift a man&apos;s weight using leverage. Unfortunately, Peggy hurts 

 herself in the process. Later, Hank and his buddies practice dousing a trash 

 fire using a hose. Dale loses control of the hose and it flails on the 

 ground, dousing his colleagues. Back at the firehouse, the men bask in the 

 clublike atmosphere. There, Heck introduces Hank to an elderly man named 

 Chet Elderson, one of the town&apos;s first volunteer firemen. Chet notices that 

 someone unplugged his neon Alamo beer sign. Dale plugs it back in, but 

 receives an electric shock in the process. One day, Hank and his buddies 

 drive past the middle school, attracting the attention of Bobby and his 

 friends. The boys want to board the fire truck, but Hank notes their muddy 

 feet. The men decide to clean the boys using the fire hose. Unfortunately, 

 the group strips the bolt on a hydrant, producing a geyser of water.

As time passes, the men&apos;s behavior at the firehouse turns more and more 

 juvenile. A sleepless Hank protests when Dale and Bill play ping-pong one 

 night. But the pair ignore his pleas for quiet. Angered, Hank rises from his 

 bed, grabs the ping-pong ball, and smashes it with his foot. In retaliation, 

 Bill removes Hank&apos;s eyeglasses and crushes them with his foot. Angered over 

 the crushed ball, Dale throws a hot Frito pie at Hank, but misses and 

 strikes Bill in the face. Hank chases after Bill, who becomes stuck on the 

 fire pole. Later that night, the men receive word of Chet Elderson&apos;s 

 passing. The funeral turns disastrous when Hank, Bill, Dale and Boomhauer, 

 acting as pall bearers, tumble into the open grave. Afterwards, at the fire 

 station, Dale plugs in Chet&apos;s beloved Alamo beer sign. Hank yanks out the 

 cord, but Dale plugs it back in. Suddenly, the station&apos;s fire alarm sounds. 

 The men are dispatched to a fire at Goobersmooches restaurant. Just before 

 the men hop aboard the fire engine, Bill runs to his uniform holding a 

 roasted marshmallow; Dale discards a cigarette; and Boomhauer knocks over a 

 tanning lamp. When the foursome arrive at the restaurant, Heck has already 

 extinguished the blaze. But when they return to the station house, they find 

 it engulfed in flames. The men recount for the fire chief what transpired 

 moments before they left for Goobersmooches. Eventually, the chief concludes 

 that the fire house blaze could have been caused by Dale&apos;s smoking, 

 Boomhauer&apos;s tanning, or Bill&apos;s eating. But Hank reveals it was none of 

 these. He recounts how, when he hopped into the driver&apos;s seat of the fire 

 truck, he saw the Alamo beer sign flashing in the rear view mirror. He 

 blames Chet Elderson for plugging in the defective sign, and for 

 accidentally causing the fire. The fire chief accepts the story...much to

Peggy loses her job as a substitute teacher after she spanks an unruly 

 student.

Peggy receives a telephone call from the dispatch office. She is asked to 

 fill in for a Spanish teacher at Bobby&apos;s school and warned of a&quot;surprise&quot;in-class evaluation. As the session gets under way, unruly students Dooley 

 and Clark Peters pull a series of pranks on Peggy, causing her great 

 embarrassment and frustration. When Peggy returns home, she shows her family 

 the results of the in-class evaluation, which concludes she&quot;needs 

 improvement.&quot;The next day, Peggy takes a more proactive approach with the 

 bullies. But Dooley nonetheless manages to pull down Peggy&apos;s pants in front 

 of the class. Furious, Peggy grabs Dooley, places him over her knee, and 

 gives him a spanking. A short time later, the school nurse informs Peggy 

 that she is to report to the principal&apos;s office the next morning.

Hank attempts to assure Peggy that she will not lose her job over the 

 incident. He recalls how, as a child, he was disciplined with a paddle 

 nicknamed&quot;Ol&apos; Spanky.&quot;Despite Hank&apos;s words of reassurance, Principal Moss 

 promptly fires Peggy the next morning. Cotton spies Peggy crying about her 

 dismissal and turns to his friend Jeter Turbeville, who disciplined 

 thousands of students during his tenure at the Middle School. Turbeville and 

 his fellow veterans circulate a petition in an effort to get Peggy 

 reinstated. Shortly thereafter, the school board votes on the matter and 

 Peggy wins back her job. But when Peggy returns to school, she brings Ol&apos; 

 Spanky along for good measure--much to the concern of her students.

Bobby approaches his father about his mother&apos;s aggressive attitude. He 

 explains that fear of the paddle is giving his friend Joseph nightmares. 

 Meanwhile, word of&quot;Paddlin&apos; Peggy&quot;spreads throughout town, and a local 

 television news channel stops by the house to tape a segment on the famous 

 substitute teacher. Peggy begins to panic when she realizes the paddle is 

 nowhere to be found. She discovers it protruding from Dale Gribble&apos;s trash, 

 and immediately assumes that his son, Joseph, tossed it there. Joseph 

 strongly denies the accusation, but Peggy is certain he is the culprit. She 

 raises the paddle over her head, prepared to strike the boy. Suddenly, Dale 

 confesses it was he who stole the paddle. Peggy, horrified by a nearby 

 reflection of herself, realizes she has gone too far. She returns to the 

 school hoping to find her old self--the one who could teach children without&quot;scaring the bejesus out of them.&quot;When a student again makes her the brunt 

 of a practical joke, she swings a mace over her head, and then recounts how 

 innocent people were brutally punished with just such a device during the 

 Spanish Inquisition, even though they did nothing wrong. Later, Joseph aids 

 Peggy in her garden, and helps spread a mulch made from chips of Ol&apos; Spanky.

Hank&apos;s old tough-as-nails football coach takes command of Arlen High 

 School&apos;s team, prompting Bobby and his classmates to sign up for soccer.

Hank, Bobby, Bill, Boomhauer and Dale make their way along a dirt embankment 

 beneath an old overpass on the outskirts of Arlen. Spraypainted on one end 

 of the bridge is&quot;Wolves #1!&quot;Hank tells the others that the Cougars must 

 take action. He shakes up his can of spray paint, then hands it to Bobby, 

 encouraging him to create some Cougar graffiti. Unfortunately, Bobby drops 

 the can, and it rolls off into the distance. Hank tells the others that what 

 really matters is that Arlen once had a great team. In flashback, a 

 tough-as-nails Coach Sauers grills his team, which includes Hank, Boomhauer 

 and Bill. Hank pulls off a last-minute goal, sending the team to State. Back 

 in the current day, Hank watches as Arlen faces off against the Wolves. As 

 the two-minute warning sounds, Hank realizes that the team actually has a 

 chance of winning. Unfortunately, Coach Maxwell sends Bobby into the game, 

 this despite protests from Hank and Bobby. The decision costs Arlen yet 

 another victory. Later, Hank and his friends conclude that old Coach Sauers 

 would have won the game. They approach Sauers at a shoe store, where he 

 works as a salesperson. Sauer is so overwhelmed by the offer that his eyes 

 almost well with tears. Unfortunately, Sauers&apos; abrasive, grueling, 

 in-your-face style causes most of the team to defect to a nearby soccer 

 game, which is supervised by Coach Lucas. The following day, Bobby also 

 defects. Hank watches, mortified, as his son runs off.

Hank apologizes to Sauers for the way his son quit the team. Sauers gives 

 Hank a chance to make amends by offering him the assistant football coach 

 position. Hank accepts the challenge. Meanwhile, Coach Lucas continues to 

 pamper his players, lavishing them with praise for doing very little. Bobby 

 tells his father that his team won a game without having to beat their 

 opponents. Hank attempts to regain his relationship with his son by offering 

 to take him to see a giant ant movie. Bobby declines, noting that the soccer 

 player who collects the most litter gets to play goalie during the next 

 game. Hank ends up taking Sauers to see the movie.

While collecting trash along the side of a highway, Bobby sees the overpass 

 with&quot;Wolves Suck&quot;painted on the side. Suddenly excited, he suggests to 

 Coach Lucas that he and his teammates paint the bridge. Lucas embraces the 

 idea. Unfortunately, he decides to cover up the graffiti before the Wolves 

 have a chance to see it. Bobby begins to have doubts about the soccer team 

 experience. A short time later, Hank discovers Coach Sauers chasing his team 

 around a muddy practice field in his car. When the vehicle gets stuck in the 

 mud, Hank slams his hands down on the hood, demanding an explanation. Sauers 

 climbs out of the car and accuses Hank of losing the State game all those 

 years ago. Hank grows angered, and uses a cooler to knock Sauers 

 unconscious. With Sauers out of commission, Hank takes charge of the team. 

 But on the day of the big game, the Wolves take a commanding lead. Bobby 

 looks across the soccer field and sees his father pacing along the 

 sidelines. He grabs hold of the soccer ball and, gaining his teammates&apos; 

 attention, points to the football field. He convinces them that the Cougars 

 need their help. Hank is overjoyed when he sees Bobby walking towards him 

 with Joseph in tow. Hank immediately sends Joseph onto the field.

Hank inadvertently causes Kahn to lose his job.

Kahn slowly drives his car down the common alley, creeping up on Hank and 

 his buddies as they sip their beers. Suddenly, he honks his horn, startling 

 the men. After trading barbs with Hank, Kahn proudly announces that he 

 received a new promotion. The following day, Kahn drops by Strickland 

 Propane, where he announces that he in now a systems manager. He invites 

 Hank to join him for a tour of his workplace, Composite Analysis 

 Incorporated, and hints about a large propane contract. Hank accepts the 

 offer. Once inside the building, Kahn warns Hank that anything he sees 

 inside the company is strictly confidential in nature. He then steers Hank 

 towards a giant hangar. He opens a glass display cabinet and removes a golf 

 driver. After placing a ball on a range tee, Kahn hits an endless drive. 

 Hank is greatly impressed. Kahn explains that the club is made of a 

 resilient ceramic composite, once sought after by the U.S. Army. Hank then 

 sets up a ball and takes a swing. An ecstatic look crosses his face as the 

 ball disappears on the horizon. Moments later, Kahn admits that his company 

 has no need for propane. Later, in the common alley, Hank tells his friends 

 about the club. Bill mentions the club to an Army general. A short time 

 later, Kahn is fired from his job.

Kahn tells Hank he lost his job because he leaked company secrets. Hank 

 tells Kahn that he is at fault. Kahn claims that a severance package will 

 take care of his family for quite some time. But at the unemployment office, 

 Kahn discovers that the company does not have to make such payments, as Kahn 

 violated his contract when he broke their confidentiality agreement. 

 Humiliated, Kahn ends up taking a position at a photocopying store. But his 

 belligerent attitude costs him his job. Desperate for cash, Kahn holds a 

 lawn sale, placing many of his belongings on display. When Connie begins 

 tutoring Bobby in Laotian, Hank walks over to the Souphanousinphone 

 residence to confront Kahn. But when he enters the kitchen, he realizes that 

 Minh has been crying. Minh tells him that her husband has no severance pay, 

 and breaks into tears. Feeling sorry for the family, Hank decides to 

 purchase ten Laotian lessons in advance. Insulted and humiliated, Kahn 

 storms out of the house.

Peggy blames Hank&apos;s&quot;loose lips&quot;for her neighbor&apos;s predicament. When she 

 notices Minh struggling with some bags of trash, she sends Hank to help her 

 out. Minh gratefully accepts his help--then takes advantage of Hank&apos;s 

 generosity by asking him to perform chores around the house. When Peggy 

 notices Hank at work, she becomes jealous and reminds her husband that they 

 don&apos;t like the Souphanousinphones very much. One day, Hank sets off to the 

 hardware store to pick up a compressor cable for Minh&apos;s refrigerator. During 

 the trip, Hank notices Kahn&apos;s minivan parked outside Luly&apos;s. He discovers 

 Kahn living out of the establishment&apos;s bathroom. Kahn vows not to return 

 home until he has found a new job that will make his family proud. A few 

 days later, Kahn pulls up in front of his house driving a brand new car. He 

 proudly announces that he found a new job in Houston. He tells Minh and 

 Connie to pack their belongings, as they are moving at once. But Minh 

 quashes the idea. She insists that Kahn make the three-hour commute.

Hank and Peggy convince Bobby that one of his pranks has gotten Luanne 

 pregnant.

Hank, Dale and Bill see Boomhauer off as he leaves on a trip to rendez-vous 

 with a woman he met through the Internet. Hank convinces Boomhauer that 

 Bobby would make an excellent housesitter during his absence. He hands his 

 son the keys to Boomhauer&apos;s house, reminding him about his responsibilities 

 as he enters the newest phase of his life: adulthood. Meanwhile, Luanne cuts 

 the hair of Rad Thibodeaux, a nattily dressed man who oozes self-confidence. 

 Rad, a&quot;self-proclaimed genius&quot;and alleged concert promoter, easily wins 

 over the gullible Luanne. The two begin dating. Rad brings her to an&quot;industry party&quot;at an apartment populated by CD store clerks and night club 

 staffers. Soon, Bobby is also won over by Rad&apos;s charm and alleged importance 

 within the entertainment industry. One day, as Luanne and Rad kiss near 

 Arlen&apos;s memorial fountain, Bobby mentions that he is in charge of looking 

 after Boomhauer&apos;s empty house. Rad arches an eyebrow, suddenly interested. A 

 short time later, he throws an industry party for his many friends at 

 Boomhauer&apos;s residence. Eventually, Luanne realizes that Rad never notified 

 Boomhauer about his intentions. Angered, she ends their relationship and 

 storms off to get her father. Hank orders everyone out of the house. He then 

 spots Bobby sitting in a hot tub with two ladies. Several cans of beer sit 

 on the edge of the hot tub. Hank grabs Bobby by the arm and marches him out 

 the door.

Hank and Peggy end Bobby&apos;s duties as Boomhauer&apos;s housesitter. As punishment, 

 they take away his comedy props. A rift soon develops between Bobby and 

 Luanne. Bobby consults Dale for help. A short time later, the boy replaces 

 Luanne&apos;s hairspray with an air horn. Luanne reacts to the deafening blast. 

 She retaliates by replacing Bobby&apos;s fruit pie filling with dirt. Not to be 

 outdone, Bobby cuts holes in the seat of Luanne&apos;s pants. The pranks soon 

 escalate until Bobby replaces Luanne&apos;s birth control pills with candy. 

 Luanne notices the difference and decides to take action. She tells Bobby 

 that women who don&apos;t take their pills get pregnant. A look of grave concern 

 passes over the boy&apos;s face. Later, Luanne tells Hank and Peggy about her 

 ruse. The pair decide they must teach their son a lesson. They continue the 

 charade by telling Bobby there is only one thing left for him to do: marry 

 Luanne.

Hank and Peggy arrange for Bill to&quot;marry&quot;Luanne and Bobby in the backyard. 

 As the ceremony gets underway, Hank escorts Luanne, clad in a wedding dress, 

 out the patio door. Bobby&apos;s eyes widen, the seriousness of the situation 

 growing by the minute. After the pair finish their vows, Bobby begins 

 throwing up. A short time later, Peggy and Hank decide to teach Luanne a 

 lesson. They tell her that, as it turns out, Bill is actually a licensed 

 minister and that she is legally married to Bobby. Luanne becomes 

 panic-stricken, and even more so when Peggy and Hank inform her that she 

 must wait a year before she can finalize a divorce. After Luanne runs off, 

 Peggy and Hank share a sneaky chuckle. Eventually, Bill becomes morose at 

 the thought of being a single man. His emotions churning, he tells Luanne

Peggy assists a magician with a trick, then infuriates Hank by refusing to 

 divulge the secret behind the magic.

Bobby and Peggy paint puffy white clouds on a blue wall in Bobby&apos;s bedroom. 

 Hank enters the room and beams with pride at the sight of his son hard at 

 work. But his smile fades when he realizes that the&quot;white blotches&quot;are 

 clouds. Hank announces his intention to paint the wall solid blue so it 

 resembles a boy&apos;s room. Later, Dale hands each of his friends an invitation 

 to his wife Nancy&apos;s surprise birthday party. Hank groans when he realizes 

 the event is being held at Abracapasta, a restaurant that features magic 

 acts. Hank tells his friends about his dislike of magicians, as they cannot 

 be trusted. Despite his misgivings, Hank shows up at the party. He hands 

 Nancy her present, then attempts to make a quick getaway. But Peggy makes 

 him sit down. During the show, the Astounding Herrera asks for a female 

 volunteer. He extends his hand to Peggy, and she runs to the stage, much to 

 Hank&apos;s dismay. Herrera helps her into a large pi?ata, which is sealed shut. 

 Blindfolded, Herrera swings a flaming pole at his target. But on the third 

 swing, Hank grabs hold of the pole. He then orders the magician to let Peggy 

 out of the pi?ata. Herrera responds by striking the pi?ata with the pole. It 

 erupts in a shower of candy. Peggy, however, is not inside. Moments later, 

 Peggy calls to Hank from her seat in the audience. Hank cannot believe his 

 eyes.

When the Hills return home, Peggy refuses to tell Hank how the trick was 

 done. The next day, Peggy describes the trick to Bobby, telling him it was 

 all accomplished with magic. When Bobby returns home from Sunday school, he 

 authors a report on Jesus Christ. Peggy listens as her son reads his essay 

 aloud. She encourages him to be more creative. Hank exclaims that he has 

 figured out the secret behind Herrera&apos;s magic. He instructs Peggy to climb 

 inside an empty crate so he can reenact the trick. But once Peggy climbs 

 inside, Hank seals the crate shut. He threatens not to let her out until she 

 divulges the secret. Peggy stands her ground. Later, Peggy and Hank 

 accompany Bobby to church to hear his report on Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, 

 Bobby chooses to use magic tricks to enliven his presentation. A gasp erupts 

 from the audience when Bobby asks for&quot;a large, wooden cross and a couple of 

 volunteers.&quot;

During the drive home from church, Hank and Peggy argue over who is to blame 

 for Bobby&apos;s behavior. Joseph tells Bobby that his parents make up by doing 

 something nice for each other. Bobby takes this to heart. He paints white 

 puffy clouds on his bedroom wall, then calls to his mother. When Peggy 

 enters the room, her face lights up. Bobby tells her that Hank must have 

 done the painting, perhaps as a way of apologizing. Peggy approaches her 

 husband and thanks him for the effort. Hank reacts with confusion. Bobby 

 interrupts the conversation. He suggests that Peggy now do something nice 

 for Hank by telling him how the trick was performed. Peggy eyes her husband 

 suspiciously. She accuses him of painting the clouds on the wall to force 

 her into divulging the secret. Another argument erupts. Suddenly, out of 

 total frustration, Peggy kicks Hank in the shin. Hank kicks her back and 

 they both erupt in laughter. When Bobby reenters the house, he realizes that 

 his parents have made amends. Hank tells Bobby that&quot;there are just some 

 things you can&apos;t explain.&quot;With that, Hank, Peggy and Bobby stare at the 

 cloud-covered bedroom wall and pick out imaginary shapes.

Hank suppresses his feelings after he inadvertently arouses and is attacked 

 by a dolphin.

Hank loans Luanne sixty dollars, hoping it will keep her afloat 

 monetarily--and stop her from borrowing money in smaller quantities--for 

 some time to come. The next morning, Hank hangs out with a group of regulars 

 at the local hardware store. One of the customers announces that there is a 

 job opening at the La Grunta Hotel. The establishment is looking to fill the 

 position of golf course drink girl. When Hank returns home, he discovers 

 Luanne selling her possessions on the curb. Luanne explains that she spent 

 every dollar Hank gave her the previous evening. Hank convinces her to apply 

 for the drink girl position at the hotel. Luanne lands the job, and soon 

 discovers that lascivious, drunken golfers tip young females rather 

 generously. So pleased is Luanne with her new job that she determines to buy 

 her uncle a thank-you gift. She enters the La Grunta gift shop and speaks 

 with the cashier, who recommends a gift certificate for a round of golf. 

 That evening, Luanne presents Hank with a large, gift-wrapped box. Inside is 

 a card for Dolphin Encounter, which allows the recipient to swim in the 

 hotel pool with a live dolphin. Hank isn&apos;t sure what to make of the gift, 

 and hopes it can be exchanged for a round of golf. Luanne bursts into tears 

 and runs from the room. Hank smooths things over with Luanne and promises he 

 will give Dolphin Encounter a try. Supervised by a trainer, Hank climbs into 

 the swimming pool occupied by the dolphin. At first, Hank enjoys his 

 encounter with the playful creature. He strokes its white belly, which 

 blushes pink. Shortly thereafter, the creature attacks Hank, and then drags 

 him underwater.

Hank is pulled from the pool. The hotel director explains that Hank&apos;s 

 display of affection aroused the marine creature, and it attempted to become 

 physically intimate with him. Hank is horrified. The hotel management bribes 

 Hank with free merchandise in hopes of preventing a lawsuit. Shortly 

 thereafter, Hank tells Luanne not to discuss the incident with anyone. But 

 Hank soon discovers that keeping everything internalized comes with a price. 

 He cringes when bedsprings make a sound similar to the dolphin&apos;s squeal, and 

 reacts with horror when he reels in a live fish during a boating trip. 

 Meanwhile, at the hotel, Luanne accepts a&quot;putting lesson&quot;from an overly 

 friendly golfer, and soon finds herself being groped. At first, she keeps 

 the incident to herself. Later, however, she tells Hank and Bobby what 

 happened. Luanne tells Hank that if she can put the incident behind her, 

 then so can he.

The next morning, however, Luanne dresses in long pants and a baggy suit so 

 as not to encourage more unwanted advances. Eventually, Peggy senses 

 something is wrong and confronts her husband. Hank describes the incident 

 with the dolphin, and by doing so begins to feel much better. In fact, 

 Hank&apos;s spirits rise so much that he also describes the incident to his 

 drinking pals. At first, everyone laughs. But then Bill breaks down, 

 sobbing. He confesses that he, too, was targeted by the dolphin. But the 

 hotel&quot;bought him off&quot;with free trinkets. Hank gathers the merchandise he 

 was given and returns to the hotel. He dumps the items by the pool, refusing 

 to take a payoff. As Hank storms off, he sees a golfer stuffing money down 

 Luanne&apos;s cleavage. Outraged, Hank lifts the golfer in his arms and dumps him 

 into the pool, where he is attacked by an aroused dolphin.

Hank volunteers to drive his mother and her friends to a miniatures museum 

 only to find himself trapped on an island overrun with students celebrating 

 Spring Break.

As Hank sips beer in the alley, he worries about his mother, who is 

 traveling to see a museum of miniatures in Port Aransas. When the van 

 finally arrives, Tilly explains that she and her friends, Delia, Maureen and 

 Lillian, got behind schedule during their visit to a pancake house. Hank 

 grows concerned. He volunteers to drive the women the rest of the way, this 

 despite his long-time hatred of all things miniature. Hank tells Peggy that 

 his mother only expressed interest in miniatures when&quot;she was heading into 

 a funk.&quot;As the group makes its way through the exhibits, Hank reacts with 

 great displeasure when he hears the name&quot;Lyle Neff,&quot;who is hard at work on 

 one of his latest miniatures. When the ladies retire early for the evening, 

 Hank hangs out at the motel bar and enjoys a beer. He befriends two 

 college-aged men, Chad and Randy. Unbeknownst to Hank, the entire town is 

 about to be overrun with students eager to celebrate Spring Break. 

 Meanwhile, Bill decides to&quot;put the moves&quot;on Peggy now that Hank is out of 

 town.

On their journey to the miniatures museum the next day, Hank and the women 

 encounter throngs of college kids. While visiting the museum gift shop, 

 Tilly falls in love with a glass unicorn. Hank grows more concerned for his 

 mother&apos;s mental well-being. Later, the group enters a tea house, which has 

 been completely transformed to accommodate the younger crowd. Hank watches 

 in horror as a DJ stages a wet T-shirt contest. Afterwards, Hank hails Chad 

 and Randy when he spots them in a crowd. The boys respond by hurling water 

 balloons. A short time later, Hank and the women pack their belongings, 

 climb into the van and begin their journey towards the ferry. Suddenly, 

 Tilly realizes she left her unicorn back at the motel. When Hank informs her 

 that returning to the motel will mean missing the ferry, a verbal 

 altercation ensues. Tilly exits the van and walks off into a crowd. 

 Meanwhile, Bill invites Peggy to his home for a barbecue, but Peggy does not 

 take him up on his offer.

Hank loses sight of Tilly and she disappears into the crowd. He eventually 

 ends up back at the museum, where he strikes up a conversation with Lyle 

 Neff. Lyle tells him that women are often sad and lonely, and that 

 miniatures are sometimes the only things that prevent them from losing their 

 sanity. Hank recalls his youth, when his parents were in the process of 

 breaking up, and how his mother embraced the miniatures. He sees truth in 

 Lyle&apos;s words. When he finally catches up to his mother, Hank gives her a 

 miniature of Los Angeles International Airport. Tilly is overjoyed. 

 Meanwhile, Peggy, Luanne and Bobby sit contentedly on a bench and watch an 

 Arlen ball game. Bill sits down next to Peggy and places his arm around her. 

 Peggy responds by striking him with her large foam finger. Bill loses his 

 balance and falls from the bleachers. Meanwhile, Hank and his mother return 

 to the van. Lillian exits the vehicle and makes her way towards a stage. 

 Hank grabs hold of a Super Squirter and uses bursts of water to break 

 through the line of drunken revelers. Hank and the women then head for the 

 ferry. Unfortunately, a giant inflated beer can floats towards them, causing 

 Hank to swerve. The van enters the exit lane of a parking lot, where its 

 tires are shredded by spikes. At first, Hank refuses to drive the vehicle on 

 its rims. But when Adam Sandler descends from the sky in a helicopter 

 singing Sloppy Joe, Hank floors the accelerator and reaches the ferry just 

 in time.

Hank has some interesting privacy issues while Bobby unwittingly disappoints 

 Connie.

While hanging out at the mall, Bobby discovers a New York style deli and 

 begins to hang out regularly when he grows to like the menu choices. The 

 food gives him gout, which makes Connie wonder if Bobby will take her to an 

 upcoming dance. Bobby is given a Rascal scooter and brags about his 

 condition. Despite doctor&apos;s orders, he continues to eat at the deli, 

 crushing and angering Connie.

Meanwhile, Hank receives an invitation in the mail to a gallery where they 

 will show a picture of his as the main exhibit. When Hank and Peggy come to 

 the exhibit, they are horrified to learn that the picture is based on an 

 x-ray of his narrow urethra.

The episode ends with Hank successfully demanding the removal of his&quot;portrait&quot;and Bobby literally crawling to the Junior High gymnasium to 

 dance with Connie.

Hank sets out to direct a videotape that will convince the Dallas Cowboys to 

 relocate their training camp to Arlen.

Hank and Bobby set out on a journey to Wichita Falls to view the Dallas 

 Cowboys&apos; training camp. As they watch the team practice from the stands, the 

 pair grade the players&apos; potential for the season. After the team leaves the 

 field, Bobby notices that a football was left behind. He and his father walk 

 out onto field, where Hank tosses his son the ball. The pigskin smacks Bobby 

 in the shoulder and drops to the ground. Bobby drops to one knee, and he and 

 his father pretend that the Cowboys have won the Super Bowl. Moments later, 

 a security guard happens by. After insulting the good name of Arlen, the 

 guard tells Hank and Bobby to leave the premises. Later, the pair drop by a 

 Wichita Falls propane store. Hank is horrified when one of the workers 

 belittles Arlen and boasts of his love for the Sooners. Hank and Bobby 

 return to their motel room, where they notice a videotape on a nightstand, 

 courtesy of the Wichita Falls Chamber of Commerce. Bobby brings the tape 

 with him on the trip home. By the time he and Hank reaches Arlen, Bobby&apos;s 

 attitude toward the city in which he lives has changed. Hank takes note of 

 this and decides something must be done to save the town. He assembles a 

 group of his friends and suggests creation of a videotape (like the one from 

 the Wichita Falls Chamber of Commerce) that will bring the Dallas Cowboys 

 training camp to Arlen. Nancy volunteers to host the tape; Peggy is chosen 

 to write the script; and Hank appoints himself as director.

At first, the group goes about the project with great enthusiasm. But the 

 process of producing the tape creates friction amongst the participants: 

 Peggy mentions to Nancy that she drifted away from the script when she 

 changed the word&quot;Arlenians&quot;to&quot;Arlenites&quot;; Hank makes matters even worse 

 when he mentions Nancy&apos;s crows&apos; feet. Nancy storms off to her trailer. John 

 Redcorn arrives on location and, sizing up the situation, announces that he 

 will need an hour alone with Nancy. Peggy tries her hand at hosting the 

 tape, but her performance does not meet Hank&apos;s approval. Moments later, 

 Nancy emerges from the trailer looking refreshed. The script calls for Nancy 

 to feed a snake a live mouse. Nancy refuses to do so and recoils in horror 

 when Peggy allows a mouse to run up her arm. This triggers a chain reaction 

 that eventually allows a caged monkey to rip at Nancy&apos;s hair. Repulsed, 

 Nancy announces her resignation. Soon after, the rest of the crew drops out 

 as well.

Hank decides that he can direct and star in the video all by himself. His 

 efforts, however, leave something to be desired. He turns to a television 

 editor for help, but even he cannot work miracles. Hank walks out of the 

 editing bay, dejected. Peggy notices her husband&apos;s mood and decides to take 

 action. She borrows home movies from her friends, and has them edited 

 together into what she hopes will be a convincing sales tape. Friends and 

 family gather at the Hill home to view the finished product, which features 

 moments from their pasts. When the tape ends, the audience claps and cheers. 

 Everyone is certain that the Cowboys will relocate to Arlen once they see 

 the tape. But a few days later, Hank receives a letter from the Cowboys, 

 along with a four-inch football. It states that the team has no plans of 

 relocating in the near future. Sympathetic, Bobby convinces his father to go 

 out for a pass. While performing a play-by-play, Bobby throws the ball. The 

 pass is completed--and Bobby announces that the Cowboys have won the Super 

 Bowl.

Hank and his friends drive Dale over the edge when they steal away his 

 state-of-the-art lawn mower.

Hank allows Dale to borrow his cherished riding mower with the proviso that 

 he replace the gasoline. Unfortunately, Hank later catches Dale riding the 

 mower to a drive-thru window of a fast-food restaurant. Hank&apos;s anger grows 

 when Dale reveals that he abandoned the mower when it ran out of fuel near 

 the gas station. Hank retrieves the mower and refuses Dale borrowing 

 privileges. With his lawn mowing only half completed, Dale invests in a 

 state-of-the-art riding mower, complete with an alarm system. Hank and his 

 friends cannot hide their envy. Later, Hank and Bill realize that Dale 

 replaced the gasoline from Hank&apos;s mower with soda pop. Hank vows revenge. 

 While Dale is taking a shower, Hank and his buddies steal the lawn mower. 

 They leave behind a message that reads,&quot;we have your mower.&quot;Dale cries to 

 the heavens.

Hank and his friends claim not to know anything about Dale&apos;s missing mower. 

 They then prey upon Dale&apos;s already paranoid nature by planting an oil filter 

 on his doorstep and doctoring a photograph to make it look as if Lee Harvey 

 Oswald is riding his mower. The pranks take their psychological toll, 

 causing Dale to grow unhinged. Hank notices the change and begins to think 

 it is time to return the mower. Bill and Boomhauer, however, believe 

 otherwise. Eventually, Hank places the machine on Dale&apos;s lawn. He asks Nancy 

 to tell him that it was all a joke. A short time later, Bill spots Dale in a 

 college tower armed with what appears to be a gun (in reality, however, the&quot;gun&quot;is a wand used for spraying bugs). Bill notifies Hank and the police 

 about the potential for trouble. Sharpshooters surround the tower.

Using a public address system, a police sergeant alerts Dale that the tower 

 is surrounded. Dale shouts down from the tower, telling the police about his 

 wand. Unfortunately, the spray from the wand ignites, creating what appears 

 to be a flame thrower. Scared, Dale tosses the flaming wand and tank over 

 the side. The incident causes Dale&apos;s already fragile mental state to 

 deteriorate even further. He then begins making outrageous demands. Hank 

 convinces police that Dale will listen to him. He climbs the tower stairs 

 and tells Dale the truth about what happened to his mower. Feeling betrayed, 

 Dale concludes that Hank is not really his friend after all. But Hank 

 manages to change his mind, and Dale agrees to come down from the tower. As 

 the pair descend the stairs, one of Dale&apos;s gun club members takes aim and 

 opens fire. Hank is struck by the bullet and slumps into Dale&apos;s arms. Dale 

 is wracked with guilt and promises to dedicate his life to all things 

 propane. But as it turns out, Hank was wearing a bulletproof vest. Dale is 

 overjoyed when he realizes his friend is not hurt after all
  
 b : 13-Apr-1999 pc : 3ABE17 w : Jon Vitti d : Tricia Garcia   56. Revenge of the Lutefisk gs : Mary Tyler Moore (New Minister) 
Bobby suffers enormous guilt after he consumes all of the new reverend&apos;s 

 lutefisk and inadvertently burns the church to the ground.

Reverend Thomason announces to his congregation that he has decided to 

 retire, as he believes the future of the Almighty is the Internet. Replacing 

 him will be Reverend Karen Stroup. The thought of a female minister running 

 the parish sends chills down Hank&apos;s spine, as Thomason kept his sermon&apos;s 

 short so parishioners could enjoy Sunday sporting events. Members of the 

 congregation gather in the church basement to meet Stroup. The reverend 

 brings with her a large casserole dish containing lutefisk, a Scandinavian 

 delicacy made by baking codfish in lye until the bones grow gelatinous. 

 Bobby is intrigued by the sound of the dish, the stench of which causes 

 those within a ten foot radius to recoil. Against his better judgment, Bobby 

 consumes the entire dish when no one is looking. Meanwhile, Hank&apos;s fears 

 regarding Stroup are put to rest when the reverend turns out to be a 

 football fan. A short time later, Bobby overhears Stroup talking about the 

 lutefisk. Panicking, he tosses the empty casserole dish into a garbage can 

 when no one is looking. When Bill finds the empty dish, Stroup realizes she 

 must address the incident in her sermon. As Stroup chastises the 

 unidentified culprit for eating all the lutefisk, Bobby&apos;s stomach begins to 

 rumble. He makes his way to the bathroom. During his absence, Cotton offends 

 Stroup by making sexist remarks. Cotton then makes his way to the men&apos;s 

 room, but the offending odor from the stall (where a guilty Bobby sits on 

 the toilet) causes him to light matches. He drops the matchbook on the floor 

 and exits. Bobby picks up the matchbook, strikes a match, blows it out, and 

 throws it into the garbage. When Thomason finds the men&apos;s room door locked, 

 Bobby makes a hasty exit through a window. Unfortunately, one of the 

 smoldering matches starts a fire, and the church burns to the ground.

Reverend Stroup approaches her congregation and reminds the unidentified 

 arsonist that although the church may be gone, the parishioners&apos; faith 

 remains. Bobby is so consumed with guilt that he stops eating. Stroup links 

 the hate in the&quot;arsonist&apos;s&quot;heart with Bobby&apos;s fasting. She calls the boy 

 to speak before the congregation, but Bobby&apos;s legs buckle and he loses 

 consciousness. Shortly thereafter, Stroup tells the congregation that police 

 found a matchbook from a Houston strip club amongst the bathroom ruins. Hank 

 and Peggy immediately suspect Cotton. When police arrive at the Hill 

 residence, Cotton takes refuge inside a suitcase. Cotton insists he is 

 innocent, but police drag him away nonetheless.

Bobby purchases a one-way bus ticket to Mexico. While awaiting the bus, 

 Bobby notices Reverend Thomason typing away on his laptop. Bobby tells the 

 reverend that he did something&quot;really, really bad.&quot;Thomason replies that 

 Jesus forgives him. Unfortunately, Bobby&apos;s spirits remain low, as the people 

 he has wronged have yet to forgive him. Later, the bus for Mexico pulls away 

 from the depot--revealing Bobby still standing on the sidewalk. Filled with 

 purpose, Bobby makes his way to the police station, where he confesses to 

 eating all the lutefisk and burning down the church. But Cotton will not let 

 his grandson&quot;take the fall,&quot;as the boy will forever be known as the&quot;stinky man.&quot;Later, Cotton tells the congregation it was he who 

 accidentally burned down the church. He also takes responsibility for the 

 terrible smell.

Despite Hank&apos;s disapproval, Peggy assists a prisoner on death row--only to 

 realize she was tricked into smuggling drugs.

Peggy receives a letter from Wesley Martin Archer, an alleged former student 

 now on death row. In the letter, Wesley credits Peggy as being the most 

 positive influence on his life. Peggy considers Wesley&apos;s request to pay him 

 a visit. As a substitute teacher, she moves in and out of people&apos;s lives and 

 never feels as if she has made an impact. Hank joins his friends in the 

 common alley, where he disapproves of the idea of his wife visiting a 

 prison. The topic of death row appeals to Dale, who likens executions to his 

 work as an exterminator. Despite Hank&apos;s concerns, Peggy makes a trip to the 

 prison, where she meets with Wesley. When she returns home, Peggy makes it 

 her business to collect a few books, which Wesley can use to expand his 

 mind. When Hank realizes that Peggy gave a convict personal information, he 

 accuses her of being na?ve. Undaunted, Peggy returns to the prison. That 

 evening, Hank&apos;s temper flares when he realizes that Peggy gave Wesley their 

 travel version of the Guinness Book of World Records. Hank forbids Peggy 

 from returning to the prison.

Despite Hank&apos;s warning, Peggy again meets with Wesley. She uses her Boggle 

 set as a creative approach to teaching him how to read. Wesley asks Peggy to 

 retrieve his old Boggle set from his wife, Janette. Peggy is more than happy 

 to help. When she returns with the set, Wesley is overjoyed. He shakes the 

 timer with glee. The next day, he informs Peggy that the timer was destroyed 

 during a prison riot. He asks her to retrieve another timer from Janette, 

 this one filled with sand. During another visit, Wesley claims the&quot;sand&quot;fell out of the timer when the top fell off. Peggy retrieves some new&quot;timer 

 sand&quot;from Janette, a brick-shaped package wrapped in plastic. Later, Wesley 

 informs Peggy that she has been smuggling him cocaine all along. He 

 threatens to alert authorities unless she brings him more of it.

Hank, Bobby and Luanne sense that something is wrong when Peggy forgets to 

 add meat to their Sloppy Joe sandwiches. On the verge of a nervous 

 breakdown, she sends Bobby and Luanne to get some pizza. After they leave, 

 she tells Hank that she was duped into smuggling cocaine into the prison. 

 When Wesley phones the house, Hank answers. He tells Wesley that his wife 

 will no longer be supplying him with drugs. Wesley threatens to make good on 

 his promise unless his demands are met. When the deadline passes, Peggy 

 receives a phone from the prison warden. She is instructed to come to the 

 prison. Peggy assumes that she will be jailed for her mistake. She and Hank 

 break the news to the family. They then make their way to the prison, where 

 they meet with the warden and Wesley. The warden asks Peggy if she was 

 smuggling cocaine. Peggy looks scared--until Wesley sniffs. Filled with 

 confidence, she asks to see the evidence against her. Wesley dramatically 

 places the Boggle timer on the warden&apos;s desk. Peggy looks at it and remarks 

 that it is completely empty. Hank wonders aloud who can be trusted: his 

 wife, or a man who decapitated someone. Wesley leaps at Peggy, but his 

 shackles prevent him from attacking her. As there is no evidence, Peggy is 

 free to leave.

Hank&apos;s friends become believers in Luanne&apos;s claim that she was visited by 

 Buckley&apos;s angel.

Luanne pays her beauty academy teacher, Mr. Kremzer, three hundred dollars 

 for enrollment in the upcoming semester. Kremzer reminds Luanne that she 

 must first pass a complicated hair dyeing exam before she can even begin 

 thinking about the final semester. Meanwhile, Hank and his friends peer over 

 a fence in the common alley, taking note of a trampoline in Kahn&apos;s backyard. 

 Kahn had purchased the trampoline from Buckley&apos;s estate, and has since let 

 it slowly fade into a sad state of disrepair. The men attempt to use reverse 

 psychology on Kahn, hoping he will allow them to restore it. Ultimately, 

 Kahn gives his consent--provided the men also mow his lawn for two months. 

 Meanwhile, one of Luanne&apos;s exams gets under way. She and her classmates dye 

 horse tails by dunking them into buckets. Luanne&apos;s efforts prove disastrous, 

 and the hair on her horse&apos;s tail falls out. When Luanne returns home, she 

 notices the men working on the trampoline. Reminded of Buckley, she sobs and 

 runs into the house. That night, Luanne uses her chemicals to dye the hair 

 on one of her puppets. She hears a noise emanating from outside, and wanders 

 into the backyard to investigate. She discovers Buckley, dressed in his Mega 

 Lo Mart smock, standing on the trampoline, a pair of tiny wings on his back. 

 She realizes that Buckley is now an angel.

Buckley and Luanne enjoy themselves by jumping up and down on the 

 trampoline. The next morning, when Luanne enters the kitchen, her face as 

 aglow. She announces that she was visited by Buckley&apos;s angel. In private, 

 Peggy suspects the incident was triggered by exposure to the hair-dyeing 

 chemicals, and is somewhat unnerved. But Hank is overjoyed, as Luanne has 

 finally stopped sobbing. He even tells his friends about Luanne&apos;s&quot;guardian 

 angel.&quot;As Hank turns his attention to repairing the trampoline, he comes 

 across a note stuck in one of the springs. On the paper is a message from 

 Bill, who asks Buckley&apos;s angel to bring him a woman. Hank grows annoyed. He 

 tells his friends there is no such thing as a&quot;Buckley&apos;s angel.&quot;But it soon 

 becomes apparent that Boomhauer and Dale also believe it. Hank storms off in 

 disgust. He makes his way to Luanne&apos;s room, where he tells Luanne that once 

 she passes the test, Buckley&apos;s good deed will be done and he will return to 

 heaven for good. That night, Luanne awakens to the sound of trampoline 

 springs. She makes her way into the backyard, where she uses the trampoline 

 as a makeshift desk. Peggy tells Luanne that, this time, she must pass the 

 exam all on her own. Luanne spends the night practicing for the exam by 

 dying Peggy&apos;s hair. The next morning, as she drives to school, Buckley&apos;s 

 angel again visits. He tells her that she will fail the test. An argument 

 ensues, and Luanne loses control of the car, nearly colliding with a 

 Weinermobile.

Luanne&apos;s car skids into a ditch. Three girls come running to her rescue. The 

 girls erroneously assume that Luanne is a student at the nearby Arlen 

 Community College. Luanne collects her wits and drives to the beauty school. 

 Meanwhile, Hank finds another note on the trampoline. He reads it aloud. The 

 message, supposedly written by Buckley&apos;s angel, addresses Bill, Boomhauer 

 and Dale&apos;s wishes. Hank concludes that Buckley&apos;s angel is no more. Bill 

 takes a closer look at the note--and realizes it isn&apos;t in Buckley&apos;s 

 handwriting. With that, Hank sprays his friends with a water hose. When 

 Luanne returns home, she proudly announces that she has received a tuition 

 refund from the beauty school and has enrolled in Arlen Community College. 

 Later, Luanne says her final goodbyes to Buckley.

Hank is picked to coach the company&apos;s softball team, causing friction with 

 pitcher Peggy.

Strickland tells Hank that the Chamber of Commerce is forming a coed 

 softball league. He asks Hank to act as the head coach for his company&apos;s 

 team. Moments later, Thatherton introduces them to Mrs. Rita Bevacqua, wife 

 of former Texas Rangers outfielder Kurt Bevacqua. Thatherton points out that&quot;husband&quot;falls under the category of&quot;immediate family&quot;(meaning he plans 

 to put a ringer on his team). Hank informs Peggy about the coed league&apos;s&quot;women-must-pitch&quot;rule. Peggy declines Hank&apos;s offer to pitch for the team, 

 as she is already a pitcher for a&quot;serious&quot;league. Meanwhile, at the middle 

 school, Bobby and Connie line up to receive their copy of the new school 

 yearbook. A page headlined&quot;couples&quot;features a photograph of Connie and 

 Bobby slow dancing. Later, Bobby rides his bike to the supermarket, where 

 Connie and her fellow Arrow Girls are selling boxes of cookies. Bobby 

 accidentally topples a display. Katie asks Connie to send her&quot;boyfriend&quot;away. Connie counters that just because she and Bobby were on the&quot;couples&quot;page, it doesn&apos;t mean they are dating. Bobby nervously begins eating the 

 cookies. He labels them&quot;waxy and stale.&quot;Meanwhile, Hank realizes his team 

 is in serious trouble. Peggy overhears a discussion between Thatherton and 

 Coach Kleehammer. Thatherton brags that he found a female pitcher who can&quot;get it over the plate,&quot;meaning he is having sex with her. Outraged, Peggy 

 joins Hank&apos;s team. Her arm leads the Strickland Bobtails to victory. Hank 

 grows jealous when everyone congratulates Peggy for the win.

Tension between Hank and Peggy builds. Despite their differences, the 

 Strickland Bobtails win game after game. During one game, umpire Boomhauer 

 kicks Hank off the field. Hank blames Peggy for his embarrassment, believing 

 that if she hadn&apos;t overruled one of his instructions, he would not have been 

 kicked out. Later, Hank chastises Dale for not wanting to run too fast (he 

 fears his hat will fall off and reveal his bald spot). Meanwhile, Bobby 

 bakes his own cookies and sets up a competing stand near the Arrow Girls. 

 Julie samples one and declares that they taste like mud. As another game 

 gets underway, Hank tells Peggy how to pitch to Bill. Peggy is rattled by 

 his interference, and even more so when he reminds her that he is her 

 husband. So distracted is Peggy that her pitches begin going wild. She 

 inadvertently strikes Bill in the head, and later hits him in the groin.

After the game, Hank wraps Bobby in plastic bubble wrap and uses him as a 

 practice batter. Eventually, Peggy regains control. The next day, the 

 Bobtails face off against the Thatherton Fuels team. As the game gets under 

 way, both Bobby and the Arrow Girls sell cookies in the stands. The girls 

 attack Bobby and smash his cookies?all save Connie, who dares sample one of 

 Bobby&apos;s efforts. The cookies are surprisingly delicious. She pronounces 

 Bobby a&quot;cookie genius.&quot;Meanwhile, as the game reaches its final inning, 

 the Thatherton Fuels load the bases?and Bevacqua steps up to the plate. 

 Strickland tells Hank to pull Peggy out of the game and replace her with a 

 new pitcher. Hank, however, makes his way to the stands. He tells Bobby that 

 taking himself out of the game?and letting Peggy pitch?is the best decision 

 he ever made as coach. His instincts prove correct: Peggy gets two more 

 strikes. But on the third throw, Bevacqua connects. Dale, who is playing 

 left field without his glove, sees the ball sailing towards the fence. He 

 removes his cap?exposing his bald spot?and uses it to catch the ball. Team 

 Strickland wins the game.

Hank and Peggy celebrate their twentieth wedding anniversary by going 

 skydiving; Bobby drives Didi to the hospital when she goes into labor.

While standing in the common alley, Hank reminds his buddies about his 

 upcoming twentieth wedding anniversary barbecue. He mentions that Luanne is 

 scheduled to go camping with friends and Bobby is staying with his father 

 and Didi. As a result, he and Peggy will have the entire weekend to 

 themselves. As the party gets under way, and guests begin arriving, Luanne 

 receives a phone call from a friend. It turns out that her camping trip has 

 been cancelled. Luanne asks Bobby if she can accompany him to Cotton&apos;s 

 place, but Bobby vetoes the idea, as he expects this is the last chance his 

 grandfather will have to spoil him before the baby is born. Later, Hank 

 subjects the party-goers to a slide show documenting the history of his 

 marriage, boring everyone in attendance. Later, Luanne climbs into a taxi 

 cab, pretending to embark on her weekend journey. But in reality, she has no 

 idea where to spend her time. Bobby also sets out on the drive with Cotton 

 and Didi, but to his great disappointment, Cotton expects him to fill in for 

 his pregnant wife and perform her chores. After the anniversary party ends, 

 Peggy begins to cry.

Still crying, Peggy laments that she and Hank are now old. As she watched 

 the slide show, she realized that the young married couple (she and Hank) 

 were unrecognizable. Hank tells her that they did themselves a favor when 

 they abandoned all their dreams. Later that night, with no where else to go, 

 Luanne sneaks back into the house and hides in a closet. Hank brings Peggy 

 to the McMaynerbury hotel for a romantic dinner. Peggy orders a Singapore 

 Sling, but Hank reminds her that if she drinks, he will have to forgo his 

 beer. Peggy changes the order to a water and Hank has his beer. When Peggy 

 and Hank return home, they spend the evening drinking. Realizing she will 

 never have a second child, Peggy begins tossing away all of Bobby&apos;s baby 

 things. She then climbs into the trash can. Hank soon follows. The next 

 morning, the pair awaken with a hangover. They set off to get some 

 breakfast, but along the way, decide to cure their hangover by drinking some 

 more beer. As Hank and Peggy sit in the bed of the truck, looking up at the 

 clouds, Peggy notices some parachutists. Peggy talks Hank into going 

 skydiving. Meanwhile, Didi&apos;s water breaks. Bobby phones Cotton at a bar. 

 Cotton tells Bobby he will meet his wife at the hospital, forgetting that 

 Didi cannot drive. Left with little choice, Bobby drives Didi to the 

 hospital. As Didi is unfamiliar with the hospital&apos;s location, Bobby makes 

 the drive to Arlen Hospital, some two hours away.

Bobby manages to get Didi to the hospital, and soon realizes that he must be 

 at her side as she goes into labor. Meanwhile, Hank jumps from the plane and 

 successfully parachutes to the ground, thoroughly enjoying the entire 

 experience. But Peggy has second thoughts and remains aboard the plane. Hank 

 radios the plane and tells Peggy about the wonderful experience. He 

 encourages her to make the jump. A short time later, Luanne tells Hank that 

 Didi is giving birth at the hospital. Hank relays word to his wife. At the 

 last moment, Peggy changes her mind and decides to make the jump. But as she 

 plummets to Earth, the ripcord comes off in her hand. She pulls the 

 emergency ripcord, but it, too, breaks. Hank watches helplessly as his wife 

 plummets to the ground.

 Season 4 
 61. Peggy Hill: the Decline and Fall (2)   
Peggy survives her crash but is immobilized in a body cast; Didi gives birth 

 to a healthy baby boy but has post-partum depression.

As Hank rushes to the spot where Peggy landed, we see the mud in the field 

 is extremely thick and soft. Peggy has survived her fall, but she is badly 

 injured and must be put in a body cast. In the same hospital, Bobby cuts his 

 uncle&apos;s umbilical cord. Peggy is elated at having survived, while Didi 

 suffers from post-partum depression. Didi&apos;s medical insurance requires her 

 to leave the hospital soon after the baby is born; Peggy insists on going 

 home too to help take care of the new baby. Cotton names his new son&quot;Hank&quot;, 

 as he&apos;s always wanted a son with that name. When Hank protests, Cotton 

 agrees to call the baby&quot;G.H.&quot;, for&quot;Good Hank&quot;, and takes to calling his 

 first son&quot;B.H.&quot;for reasons he doesn&apos;t explain. The baby begins lactating 

 due to the female hormones he&apos;s been taking in, and Cotton is so appalled he 

 won&apos;t take care of the baby. That leaves Hank and Bobby scrambling to take 

 care of Peggy and G.H. When they run out of straws, Hank chooses to feed 

 Peggy her Carnation Instant Breakfast from a bottle, but Hank and Bobby 

 confuse their bottles and Hank ends up feeding Peggy baby formula. Peggy 

 weeps at how pathetic her situation is. No one can get the baby to stop 

 crying, and Hank goes to chastise Cotton about ignoring his son. But while 

 everyone is outside, Peggy gets G.H. to sleep quietly by rocking his cradle 

 with her toe.
  
 b : 26-Sep-1999 pc : 3ABE24 w : Paul Lieberstein d : Klay Hall   62. Cotton&apos;s Plot   
While the Hills deal with the repercussions of Peggy&apos;s skydiving accident, 

 Peggy forms an unlikely alliance with Hank&apos;s father, Cotton.

Six weeks after Peggy&apos;s fateful jump from an airplane, she is finally being 

 sawed out of her body cast and planning her triumphant return home. 

 Unfortunately, she&apos;s not at all triumphant when it comes to walking and gets 

 depressed by the thought of months of rehabilitation. Hank works to make the 

 house&quot;handi-capable,&quot;and tries his best to comfort Peggy.

One morning, alone with Cotton, Peggy struggles to get to the breakfast 

 table and falls out of her chair. Instead of helping her up, Cotton reverts 

 into military mode and harasses Peggy into helping herself. Peggy&apos;s 

 resistant to Cotton&apos;s tactics at first, but ultimately she ditches her 

 traditional therapy and practically dares Cotton to help her walk again. In 

 exchange, Peggy offers to help Cotton with his latest endeavor--getting a 

 choice cemetery plot at the Texas State Cemetery, among his fellow war 

 heroes. Cotton motivates Peggy with his incredible tales of valor on the 

 battlefields of Japan, Germany and everywhere in between. Peggy gets 

 stronger every day, but begins noticing some discrepancies in Cotton&apos;s 

 stories--how could he have been in Japan and Germany at the same time? 

 Angered by Cotton&apos;s betrayal, she refuses to show up at Cotton&apos;s appeal to 

 the cemetery board, until Hank reveals a true war story about his dad. A war 

 injury left Cotton without shins and doctors swore he&apos;d never recover, but 

 18 months later, Cotton defied the odds and walked.

With renewed faith, in herself and Cotton, Peggy rushes to the hearing and 

 testifies that if Cotton Hill isn&apos;t a war hero she doesn&apos;t know who is. 

 Although Hank thinks Peggy is pretty heroic herself.

NOTE: As the family walks towards Cottons alotted grave they pass the grave 

 of Stephen Austin and Bobby asks&quot;Is that the bionic man or the wrestler?&quot;. 

 This is a gag about how ignorant Bobby (and children in general) are. 

 Stephen Austin aka&quot;The Father of Texas&quot;was the founder and secretary of 

 state of Texas. 63. Bills are Made to be Broken gs : Clint Black (Himself) 
Bill&apos;s high school football record--and local hero status--are threatened by 

 a hotshot senior at Arlen High.

In 1974, Bill Dauterive was known simply as&quot;The Bulldozer.&quot;Arlen High 

 School had never seen such a force on the football field. But now that Ricky 

 Suggs has suited up, Bill may lose some of his glory. With Ricky only two 

 scores away from tying Bill&apos;s career touchdown record, everyone in town 

 catches football fever.

When Ricky ties the record to the cheers of a sold-out crowd, he goes down 

 hard during the play, landing him on the disabled list. Hank, Dale and 

 Boomhauer worry that Bill&apos;s a little too okay with the possibility of losing 

 his record, but Bill reassures them that Ricky is earning his place in Arlen 

 history fair and square. Plus, with Ricky on the D.L., the record seems 

 pretty safe. Then comes the big game with Arlen&apos;s cross-town rival. In the 

 last moments of play, the coach puts in Ricky, who is still in a full leg 

 brace. Hank and the guys marvel at the boy&apos;s bravery and sportsmanship. But 

 when the whistle blows, the opposing team parts like the Red Sea and allows 

 Ricky to limp into the end zone, and into the record books.

Disgusted by this cowardly victory, Hank becomes determined to set the 

 record straight. He discovers a loophole that will allow Bill to play one 

 more game for Arlen High. Even though his team rejects him, and the opposing 

 team offers no mercy, Bill wears his too-tight jersey with pride. And sure 

 enough,&quot;The Bulldozer&quot;proves his worth by bulldozing his way past several 

 tackles and dragging four opponents, the ball and himself into the end 

 zone--re-tying the record and reaffirming his hero status.
  
 b : 24-Oct-1999 pc : 4ABE02 w : John Altschuler &amp; Dave Krinsky d : Jeff Myers   64. Little Horrors of Shop   
Hank teaches shop while on forced vacation from Strickland, and becomes a 

 competitor with Peggy for Substitute Teacher of the Year.

During a little vacation bonding with Bobby, Hank discovers that Bobby&apos;s 

 shop teacher eloped, turning the hallowed shop class into little more than a 

 study hall. But when Hank volunteers to substitute teach for free, he 

 invades Peggy&apos;s territory and the competition heats up.

Barely back on her feet, but thrilled to be back in the classroom, Peggy is 

 initially supportive of Hank&apos;s efforts and even shares with him her 

 sure-fire, flash card teaching method. But Hank is more at home with a band 

 saw than a flash card, and soon abandons Peggy&apos;s style for his own down-home 

 teaching approach. Hank&apos;s improvising and unconventional technique make him 

 an instant hit, and Peggy begins to feel threatened. With the&quot;Substitute 

 Teacher of the Year&quot;awards fast approaching, she steps up her efforts to 

 beat her husband and win the honor for the third year in a row. She turns to 

 Bobby for the inside scoop on what the kids really think, and Bobby reveals 

 that Peggy is seen as an insider, while Hank&quot;has good buzz.&quot;Coincidentally 

 (or not), Bobby is soon busted for wearing a tool belt on campus--a clear 

 violation of the school&apos;s zero-tolerance policy regarding weapons at school. 

 Hank is suspended, instantly making him ineligible for&quot;Substitute Teacher 

 of the Year.&quot;

While Hank teaches after-school shop out of the garage, Peggy capitalizes on 

 sympathy for him by campaigning as&quot;Mrs. Hank Hill.&quot;To no one&apos;s surprise, 

 Peggy wins. As she positions her shiny brass trophy next to the others, 

 Hank&apos;s shop students present him with their own handmade&quot;Teacher of the 

 Year&quot;trophy (which also doubles as a clock and CD holder!).
  
 b : 31-Oct-1999 pc : 4ABE03 w : Kit Boss d : Adam Kuhlman   65. Aisle 8A   
Kahn and Minh go to Hawaii on a business trip, leaving Connie with the 

 Hills...and leaving Hank with major angst when Connie&quot;becomes a woman.&quot;

After much trepidation, and lacking any other options, Kahn agrees to let 

 Connie stay with the Hills during his important business trip to Hawaii. 

 Hank and Peggy are more than happy to have Connie as a houseguest, but Bobby 

 starts getting anxious about having his girlfriend under the same roof. 

 First of all, he doesn&apos;t have the appropriate pajamas!

Everything seems fine during their first night of&quot;camping out&quot;in the 

 living room. But Bobby is too nervous to&quot;bust a move.&quot;The next day, Connie 

 seems a little moody and Bobby&apos;s convinced she hates him. Peggy takes Bobby 

 to school, leaving Hank to bring Connie, who is taking an unusually long 

 time in the bathroom. When Connie finally emerges, she shocks Hank with the 

 news that she&apos;s just gotten her first period. Unable to reach Connie&apos;s 

 parents or Peggy, Hank does what any guy would do; he rushes Connie to the 

 hospital. Unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t get him off the hook. He must still 

 face the demon known as Aisle 8A--that mysterious aisle brimming with 

 feminine hygiene products.

Once back in the safety of his own home, Hank breaks the news to Peggy, who 

 thankfully takes charge. Kahn and Minh rush back, while Peggy tries to 

 explain the situation to a very confused Bobby. He&apos;s convinced it&apos;s his 

 fault. If his hormones hadn&apos;t been so close to Connie&apos;s in the living room, 

 none of this would&apos;ve happened. Hank consoles his son by explaining that if 

 he can hold on during the next few days, everything will eventually return 

 to normal. So, Connie and Bobby decide to remain boyfriend and 

 girlfriend--except for the four days a month when the sight of Bobby will 

 make Connie want to kill him.

Hank wins an Alamo Beer contest, which gives him the chance to win a million 

 dollars; meanwhile, Bill rediscovers his Southern roots.

Who says beer drinking doesn&apos;t pay? After many a six-pack, Hank wins a trip 

 to the New Orleans vs. Dallas game, where he can try to win a million 

 dollars during a halftime contest. If Hank can throw a football 10 yards 

 into a small hole in the side of a giant Alamo beer can, he wins. Or, Hank 

 can opt to have a former Dallas Cowboy quarterback throw the football, and 

 settle for a hundred thousand dollars. Either way, Hank gets to meet his 

 idol,&quot;Dandy&quot;Don Meredith.

The drive to New Orleans becomes quite a road trip when Bill, Dale and 

 Boomhauer invite themselves along. Bill insists they stop to visit his Aunt 

 who lives in Louisiana. They are all shocked to find not a&quot;tar-paper 

 shack,&quot;but the Dauterive Plantation--an impressive estate. Even more 

 impressive are Bill&apos;s relatives, three young, beautiful women, all widowed 

 by Bill&apos;s cousins and all desperate to hook up with Bill--the last eligible 

 Dauterive man (except for Jean Robert, but he&apos;s not too interested in 

 women). Bill stays with his family, taking advantage of the Southern&quot;hospitality,&quot;while the others continue their journey to the Superdome.

Even though Hank&apos;s been practicing for weeks on a giant replica beer can, 

 he&apos;s having second thoughts about gambling on Bobby&apos;s college fund. So, 

 there on the turf in front of millions, Hank opts for the&quot;sure thing.&quot;He 

 lets Don Meredith take the shot. And sure enough, Don misses. In fact, Don 

 didn&apos;t even bother to take off his coat! A disappointed Hank tackles Don 

 right there on the field. Afterwards, Don reveals that he too had been 

 practicing for weeks with a giant replica beer can. And since he had 

 practiced with his coat on, he didn&apos;t want to throw without it. Hank 

 understands, and even though he didn&apos;t win any money, he&apos;s honored to have 

 stood on the field with a football legend.

NOTE: Bill&apos;s relatives are played by members of the Dixie Chicks. 67. Happy Hank&apos;s Giving   
Hank plans to take his family, and Thanksgiving turkey, to Peggy&apos;s mother&apos;s 

 house in Montana.

Hoping to end a long-standing dispute with Peggy&apos;s mom over the tastiness of 

 a propane-cooked turkey, Hank packs up the family for a Montana 

 Thanksgiving. Everyone, it seems, has a reason to head to the airport. Bill, 

 knowing he&apos;ll be left alone over the holiday, makes up a story about picking 

 up his uncle so he can drive the Hills. Boomhauer plans to visit his mom in 

 Miami. Dale and Nancy are dropping off Red Corn. Even Kahn is flying his 

 family out of town.

Hank pre-cooks the turkey and plans to carry it, along with a spare propane 

 tank, onto the flight. However, security forces him to leave the propane 

 behind in an airport locker. Bad weather soon delays their flight, but Hank 

 tries to keep the family&apos;s spirits up. Finally, a brief break in the weather 

 allows them to board. Unfortunately, the box carrying the turkey does not 

 meet carry-on requirements and Hank reluctantly checks it with the baggage. 

 As he watches from his window seat, Hank sees his beloved turkey left on the 

 tarmac. Suddenly, it is surrounded by the bomb squad and detonated into a 

 million little turkey chunks. As if that weren&apos;t enough, a new storm rolls 

 in and the flight is promptly cancelled. Now, all bets are off! Hank 

 discovers a new flight leaving from the other side of the airport and tricks 

 another family in order to steal their spot on the transfer bus. But he 

 can&apos;t go through with his scheme and sacrifices his own trip so that the 

 strangers can make it.

Gathered around a small table in the terminal, the despondent Hills meet up 

 with their friends who are also grounded, and Bill who drove back to the 

 airport when he heard all flights were cancelled. Realizing there is still 

 plenty to be thankful for, they pool their various snack foods, retrieve 

 Hank&apos;s propane tank from the locker and cook up the best airport 

 Thanksgiving ever.

Hank makes a new friend, which upsets the balance of things as far as Dale 

 and Bill are concerned.

Hank rents a loader back-hoe to help Bill install his new, gigantic septic 

 tank. After a frustrating afternoon of digging up the yard and watching Dale 

 play with the back-hoe, Hank retreats to the peace and quiet of the 

 Mega-Lo-Mart. There, he meets a man named Hal, with whom he has a lot in 

 common--they even drive the same model truck! The next day, Hank runs into 

 the Hal again at the gas station and the two decide to grab a beer.

As the two new friends spend more and more time together, Bill and Dale 

 start feeling a bit ignored. They follow Hank and Hal and watch with 

 jealousy as the two enjoy shopping at the sporting goods store and playing 

 guitar. But the worst is when Hank and Hal successfully install Bill&apos;s 

 septic tank, without even asking Bill or Dale for help. Dale concludes,&quot;whoever controls the back-hoe, controls Hank,&quot;and so they head off to an 

 abandoned pet cemetery to practice their maneuvers. Naturally, they maneuver 

 themselves into trouble and get trapped in a giant hole they&apos;ve created. In 

 the meantime, Hank and Hal have decided to&quot;break up,&quot;because their 

 long-distance (20-mile) friendship just isn&apos;t convenient. When he realizes 

 the back-hoe was never returned, Hank traces his friends&apos; path of 

 destruction to the pet cemetery and rescues them. He admits that Hal could 

 never replace Bill and Dale because they are something Hal will never 

 be--neighbors.
  
 b : 28-Nov-1999 pc : 4ABE06 w : Paul Lieberstein d : Shaun Cashman   69. To Kill a Ladybird   
Against Hank&apos;s wishes, Bobby befriends a raccoon that promptly attacks 

 Ladybird and Dale, creating a neighborhood rabies scare.

Good ol&apos; Ladybird may be the family pet, but she&apos;s 91 in dog years and not 

 as much fun as she used to be. So Bobby turns to a frisky raccoon for 

 companionship, naming his new pal Bandit and feeding it from the trash. But 

 when Bandit wreaks havoc on Hank&apos;s workbench, the secret&apos;s out and Hank 

 brings in the big guns: Dale, the exterminator.

Dale crawls under the house to go&quot;mano e mano&quot;with Bandit, but Bandit 

 escapes and lunges at Hank. Old Ladybird steps up to the challenge and 

 follows the raccoon as it races into the neighborhood. Dale, covered in 

 scratches, is convinced he&apos;s got rabies. He quarantines himself until Hank, 

 Bill and Boomhauer stage a&quot;kidnapping&quot;and take him to the hospital. Dale 

 escapes at a stoplight and he too disappears into the woods. Hank quickly 

 organizes a neighborhood search party to locate Ladybird, Dale and Bandit 

 (in that order of priority).

Out in the woods, Hank and Bobby stumble upon Dale. He&apos;s stripped to his 

 underwear, covered in mud and has been eating wild mushrooms for sustenance. 

 The mushrooms have made Dale a little crazy, and he ties Hank and Bobby to a 

 tree. His plan: to replace his rabies-infected blood with Hank&apos;s healthy 

 blood. Just as Dale is about to carry out his design, Ladybird emerges from 

 the woods, limping and growling. She distracts Dale long enough for Hank and 

 Bobby to free themselves. As Hank and his beloved dog reunite, Bobby picks 

 up the shotgun, aims at them and fires! He hits Bandit, who had also come 

 out of the woods and was potentially rabid. After a brief burial ceremony, 

 Hank promises Bobby that when the time comes Bobby can pick the next family 

 pet. As long as it&apos;s not a raccoon, or an ostrich, or a poodle or?

Arlen is struck with Y2K hysteria.

Boomhauer expects the Apocalypse. Dale is secretly hoarding supplies. Even 

 Chappy, the Christmas tree lot owner, has trimmed his life to the bare 

 necessities. Nonetheless, Hank and Peggy believe that Millennium Mayhem is 

 just a myth--until Peggy discovers that her computer is not Y2K compatible.

Now totally paranoid, Peggy goes on a mission to print every file before New 

 Year&apos;s Eve. Hank decides to buy her a new computer for Christmas and enlists 

 Dale&apos;s help. Unfortunately, computers are down at the computer store, and 

 Hank can&apos;t buy anything. He&apos;s amazed at how paranoid people have become and 

 he&apos;s happy that Dale is so calm. Little does Hank know that Dale&apos;s basement 

 is packed to the rafters with supplies, including two large tanks of Dale&apos;s 

 favorite soft drink, Dew Mountain.

Days before Christmas, Hank is faced with a propane crisis. The latest 

 shipment won&apos;t arrive in time for the holidays and the shortage has sent 

 customers into a frenzy. Hank takes the last three tanks for himself, 

 knowing that if the propane industry can&apos;t keep up, the worst is yet to 

 come. Meanwhile, Dale&apos;s Dew tanks have exploded, ruining all his supplies. 

 Dale, Hank and Chappy team up to guarantee their Y2K survival. On Christmas 

 morning, Peggy receives not a brand new computer, but an old grandfather 

 clock--a gift Hank assures her will be much more practical in 2000. Peggy 

 banishes him and the clock to the garage. While varnishing the clock, Hank 

 passes out from the fumes and has a prophetic dream. In it, legendary Dallas 

 Cowboys coach Tom Landry assures Hank that everything will be all right. 

 When he wakes up, Hank is a new man. One who orders his wife a new computer

Peggy blames Bobby&apos;s&quot;F&quot;in English on her rivalry with his substitute 

 teacher--until Bobby&apos;s caught plagiarizing Peggy&apos;s&quot;musings.&quot;

When Bobby&apos;s new substitute teacher, Ms. Donovan, gives him an&quot;F&quot;on his 

 English paper, Peggy takes it as a personal attack from her old rival. She 

 decides to help Bobby rewrite the essay, entitled&quot;Why Bobby Hill Loves 

 America.&quot;Inspired by the massive American flag hanging high above Bill&apos;s 

 lawn, Peggy writes an&quot;A&quot;paper.

Now that he&apos;s a model student, other students try to get Bobby to write 

 their essays. The principal has even asked Bobby to read the patriotic paper 

 to the entire school at an upcoming assembly. In a panic, Bobby turns to his 

 mother for help. She resents the fact that Bobby got all the credit for her 

 paper. In addition, she&apos;s a bit edgy because the newspaper has stopped 

 printing her&quot;musings.&quot;She tells Bobby he&apos;s on his own.

Later that night, Bobby sneaks in to Peggy&apos;s computer room and pilfers some 

 of her columns to give to his classmates. Meanwhile, Peggy has taken out a 

 newspaper ad in order to continue printing her work. As fate would have it, 

 Peggy&apos;s first printed column,&quot;If You Enjoy Knitting, Then You&apos;ll Love This 

 Yarn,&quot;is exactly the same as one of the seventh graders&apos; essays. Ms. 

 Donovan figures out the truth and Bobby confesses that he didn&apos;t write his 

 winning essay. As punishment, Ms. Donovan wants both Bobby and Peggy to 

 publicly apologize at the assembly, but Peggy has another idea.

Peggy&apos;s plan is to steal Bill&apos;s huge flag and sneak it into the assembly 

 room for an awe-inspiring, all-American presentation. The plan goes up in 

 smoke, however, when her&quot;special effects&quot;(road flares) almost destroy the 

 school and the flag. She and Bobby dump the battered and torn Old Glory on 

 Bill&apos;s lawn and watch in horror when Bill discovers it. After Bobby 

 witnesses Bill&apos;s grief, he realizes the true meaning of patriotism. His 

 heartfelt confession at the packed assembly wins over the crowd--and leaves 

 Ms. Donovan speechless.

When the rodeo comes to town, Bobby finds his calling as a rodeo clown.

The Heimlich County Rodeo is heading to town, and rodeo fever has hit the 

 neighborhood. Bobby and Dale&apos;s stepson, Joseph, practice roping Bill on his 

 rider mower and polish their cowboy boots in preparation. At the rodeo, 

 Bobby fails miserably when he gets roped by the cow, but is impressed by the 

 work of the rodeo clowns. Meanwhile, Joseph excels at roping and riding and 

 is soon accepted by the&quot;real&quot;cowboys.

Bobby asks the rodeo clowns to let him work with them, but they only laugh, 

 saying he&apos;s too young to handle the job. But after Bobby gives them some 

 shrewd pointers on their tired comedy schtick, the clowns are impressed and 

 invite Bobby to join their ranks. Totally excited, Bobby throws together a 

 clown costume with some stolen clothes and Luanne&apos;s makeup. He tells no one 

 except Joseph of his secret ambition. Unfortunately, Joseph&apos;s new cowboy 

 friends don&apos;t think too highly of rodeo clowns--and Joseph begins to share 

 their attitude. The cowboy-clown rivalry puts a strain on Joseph and Bobby&apos;s 

 friendship.

When Bill recognizes his underwear as part of Bobby&apos;s costume, Hank learns 

 the truth about his son&apos;s rodeo dreams. Hank&apos;s disappointed that Bobby 

 doesn&apos;t want to be a roughrider, and tells him,&quot;A rodeo clown is just a 

 carny who&apos;s too stupid to flip a ride switch on and off.&quot;The next day, a 

 dejected Bobby takes a seat in the stands to watch Joseph attempt his first 

 bull ride. Joseph gets thrown hard and the clowns run in to distract the 

 bull. But this time, the bull flattens both clowns, leaving Joseph in mortal 

 danger. Bobby rises to the challenge, plucking a clownish outfit from crowd 

 members and leaping into the ring. With a gag and a fire extinguisher, Bobby 

 distracts the bull, cracks up the audience, and makes his father proud.

Mrs. Strickland files for divorce, throwing Hank in the middle of a sex 

 scandal...and a murder!

Hank&apos;s boss, Buck Strickland, gets caught in a compromising position with a 

 hot, young employee named Debbie by none other than his wife, Liz. Liz files 

 for divorce and immediately takes control of Strickland Propane, putting 

 Hank&apos;s loyalties to the ultimate test.

Trying to protect his assets, Buck signs his popular barbecue restaurant, 

 Sugarfoot&apos;s, over to Hank, much to Peggy&apos;s delight. Meanwhile, Liz gives 

 Hank a promotion and a silver lighter engraved with Hank&apos;s initials. Hank 

 feels torn between the Stricklands, but offers to make an&quot;propane 

 emergency&quot;house call when Mrs. Strickland calls late one night. The&quot;emergency&quot;turns out to be Mrs. Strickland&apos;s overactive libido and sends 

 Hank running from the house. The next day, Hank discovers a half-naked 

 Debbie waiting for him in the back of his truck. Since he&apos;s her new boss, 

 she wants to sleep with him. Between the stress of work and women throwing 

 themselves at him, Hank starts smoking again!

After Liz lies to Buck and says she slept with Hank, Hank decides to put an 

 end to the whole mess. He arranges for Liz and Buck to meet him separately 

 at Sugarfoot&apos;s--with plans for a surprise reunion. They&apos;re surprised all 

 right. But it&apos;s because of Peggy&apos;s handiwork. She&apos;s remodeled the 

 restaurant--now called Peggy&apos;s Sugarfoot--into a cozy, country barbecue. 

 While Liz and Buck reminisce about their beloved restaurant, Hank slips out 

 to meet with Debbie at her apartment, which is across from the restaurant. 

 He&apos;s hoping to dissuade her from lying to Peggy about the truck incident.

Moments later, Peggy hears a noise behind the restaurant. She investigates 

 and discovers Debbie&apos;s lifeless body in the dumpster!

All signs point to one suspect in Debbie&apos;s murder...Hank R. Hill.

Hank waits for Debbie in her apartment, unaware that her dead body was just 

 discovered across the street behind Sugarfoot&apos;s barbecue restaurant. Antsy, 

 he asks Debbie&apos;s roommate, a guy named Gayle, if he can use Gayle&apos;s 

 cigarette to light his own, because his own lighter isn&apos;t working. Hank 

 takes a few hits of Gayle&apos;s&quot;cigarette&quot;to fire up the tip and realizes it&apos;s 

 marijuana. In a panic, he rushes to the bathroom, and unknowingly drops his 

 monogrammed lighter.

Back at Sugarfoot&apos;s, police inspect the murder weapon. It&apos;s a shotgun 

 inscribed with the words&quot;Miz Liz&quot;--the same shotgun Buck Strickland kept at 

 Debbie&apos;s apartment. The next day, the sheriff tells Hank that due to his 

 relationships with both Liz Strickland and Debbie, he has become their prime 

 suspect!

Hank tries to assure Peggy that there were no relationships with Liz or 

 Debbie. But secretly Hank starts to think that while he was high on drugs, 

 he may have blacked out and committed murder! Things turn from bad to worse 

 after Mr. Strickland plants evidence to frame Hank, and even supplies a 

 taped confession that he tricked Hank into giving. The confession, along 

 with Hank&apos;s lighter found in the victim&apos;s apartment, seem to seal Hank&apos;s 

 fate. Luckily, Gayle tells the police that he and Hank were smoking pot at 

 the time of Debbie&apos;s murder. When Hank&apos;s asked to confirm the story, 

 however, he&apos;s too ashamed to admit he was smoking pot, so Gayle is arrested.

At a celebratory dinner, Hank can&apos;t stand the guilt and announces to 

 everyone--including the sheriff and a Texas Ranger--that he was with Gayle, 

 which means they&apos;re both innocent (except for the pot smoking). There&apos;s a 

 huge outburst and everybody starts pointing the finger. Finally, the Texas 

 Ranger explains what really happened. Debbie saw the Stricklands arrive 

 together at Sugarfoot&apos;s and got jealous, so she planned to shoot Buck. She 

 grabbed Buck&apos;s shotgun and hid in the dumpster outside the restaurant. After 

 a brief fast-food run, she tried to climb back into the dumpster, but 

 couldn&apos;t juggle the food and the gun, consequently shooting herself. Case 

 closed!

Bobby accidentally sees Luanne naked and Boomhauer accidentally gets 

 admitted to a mental hospital.

After a fun-filled day at the river, Bobby heads into the unisex bathroom 

 and accidentally walks in on a buck-naked Luanne. Meanwhile, Boomhauer falls 

 asleep in his inner tube and drifts downstream, all the way into the Houston 

 sewer system.

While Bobby is totally traumatized from seeing Luanne in all her glory, his 

 friend Joseph is jealous--and wants a peek for himself! Joseph starts 

 hanging around the Hill house, waiting for the right opportunity. When 

 Luanne heads for her nightly shower, he goes outside to peep. Bobby chases 

 after him and tries to wrestle away Joseph&apos;s binoculars. They happen to be 

 standing in front of Connie&apos;s bedroom window, and she catches them 

 red-handed. But she thinks they were peeping at her! For revenge, Connie 

 goes out with a Laotian boy who her parents want her to marry, but has a 

 miserable time. Later, when Bobby explains what happened, Connie is 

 disappointed that they didn&apos;t want to see her naked. Bobby reassures her 

 that he&apos;d like nothing better. Bobby takes off his shirt and just as Connie 

 is about to do the same, her parents walk in! Kahn forbids Connie to see 

 Bobby and starts building a six-foot fence between their houses.

Meanwhile, in the big city, a sunburnt and stinky Boomhauer is found 

 wandering the streets in his leopard-print speedo. Thrown into a state 

 hospital for&quot;observation,&quot;he uses his one phone call to notify Dale. Dale 

 goes on a reconnaissance mission and winds up trapped inside with Boomhauer. 

 Not wanting Hank to find out, they turn to Bill. But once Bill gets a taste 

 of group therapy, he has no plans to leave. Finally, the call goes out to 

 Hank, who rescues them all--except for Bill, who is making real progress and 

 decides to stay.

Back at home, Hank discovers Bobby and Connie in a secret rendezvous atop 

 the massive fence. Hank gives his son a hand with the ladder, and lets young 

 love run its course.

Frustrated with Hank&apos;s rules, Luanne moves out.

Late one night, Hank and Peggy are&quot;getting jiggy&quot;when Luanne tries to 

 sneak into the master bathroom, killing the mood and infuriating Hank. He 

 lectures Luanne about the rules, including no hot water after 11 PM and no 

 entering the master bedroom, ever. Luanne thinks he&apos;s overreacting and that 

 his rules are ridiculous.

The next day, Bill, Dale and Boomhauer convince Hank to chip in with them to 

 rent a vacant house on the block. Their plan is to make it their clubhouse, 

 complete with secret knock and clever codenames. After getting Hank to 

 agree, they break the&quot;lock box&quot;on the rental and start making plans for a 

 clubhouse remodel. Hank decides that if he starts charging Luanne rent, he 

 can put that money towards his share of the clubhouse. He&apos;s shocked to find 

 out that Luanne has taken matters into her own hands, and has rented the 

 vacant house with some fellow students.

Luanne loves the freedom of her own place, but soon realizes that her 

 roommates are not very reliable. They eat her food, talk on the phone long 

 distance, don&apos;t clean up and mysteriously don&apos;t have money when it comes 

 time to pay the bills. But Luanne refuses to lean on Hank and Peggy for 

 help. She&apos;d rather starve than admit she&apos;s in trouble. Meanwhile, Hank has 

 converted Luanne&apos;s room back into his private sanctuary. Unfortunately, the 

 guys have decided that Hank&apos;s den is now their&quot;Plan B&quot;clubhouse and are 

 constantly in there!

Hank, Peggy and Bobby surprise Luanne by bringing over dinner one night. She 

 returns home from a double shift, frazzled and frustrated. It only takes one 

 comment from her slacker roommates to set her off. After she finishes a huge 

 lecture about respecting the rules, she is mortified that she&apos;s become Hank! 

 Later, Hank tries to give her a pep talk, but Luanne figures out her own 

 solution. She pays every bill then cancels all the services, making her 

 roommates pay up or suffer. Hank finally realizes that Luanne is becoming 

 quite the grown-up.

Peggy gets caught up in a pyramid scheme and enlists Bill&apos;s help.

Having greatly enjoyed her brief stint as a restaurateur, Peggy decides to 

 switch gears from teaching and put her people skills to better use. She 

 unwittingly joins a pyramid scheme when she signs up with a top sales rep 

 for Metalife--a health food company.

Initially, she forces Hank and Luanne to become her sales team. However, 

 their low turnover (Hank sold one health bar), combined with Peggy&apos;s dismal 

 door-to-door sales, leaves Peggy feeling like a failure. Then Bill, who is 

 always trying to impress Peggy, intercepts one of her shipments and sells 

 the entire case on the military base. Peggy is so amazed that she makes Bill 

 her new salesman. Her tough love tactics motivate Bill to scale new heights 

 and he sells 10,000 units, getting him onto the Metalife Diamond Team. Peggy 

 is a little jealous of Bill&apos;s success, but invites herself along when he 

 wins a trip to the San Antonio Sales Conference.

At the conference, Peggy learns about the Nationals--the ultimate event for 

 Metalife&apos;s elite sellers. Determined to get there, Peggy tells Bill he needs 

 to double his efforts. Even before the conference ends, Bill has sold 1,000 

 units at the hotel. Overcome with glee, Peggy heaps on the praise and even 

 gives Bill a little peck on the cheek. The unusual positive attention sends 

 Bill into a rage and he quits!

Hank tells Peggy that the only way to get through to Bill is to be mean, 

 because that&apos;s all he&apos;s ever known. So Peggy becomes a drill sergeant and 

 sure enough, Bill snaps back into shape. Their re-energized team is primed 

 for profit, but Peggy is having a hard time being so tough on Bill. He&apos;s so 

 eager to please that he refuses to slow down even after he hurts himself 

 lifting cases of Metalife. Unable to take advantage of him anymore, Peggy 

 fires him. Bill, touched by her compassion, confesses that he thinks 

 Metalife is a big scam.&quot;Maybe,&quot;says Peggy,&quot;but what a ride!&quot;

Bobby becomes&quot;Little Buddha.&quot;

On the eve of the Laotian New Year, called&quot;Pimai,&quot;the Kahns have a party 

 and invite the entire neighborhood. Also on the guest list are the 

 prestigious Wassanasongs, whose son Chane is in constant competition with 

 Connie. Chane has been identified by three visiting monks as a potential 

 lama, or&quot;chosen one.&quot;When Connie hears this, she becomes determined to 

 beat Chane in the lama game.

At the party, Chane and Connie compete for the monks&apos; attention while Bobby 

 and his parents mingle. The monks set up a test to see whether Chane or 

 Connie is the new lama. They lay some articles out on the lawn: a cane, a 

 pair of eyeglasses, some bowls, etc. One of these articles belonged to the 

 previous lama and only he or she who possesses the great lama&apos;s spirit can 

 identify which item was his. While Connie and Chane prepare, Bobby casually 

 picks up the cane and begins twirling it. The monks immediately bow in honor 

 of the new chosen one, for Bobby picked the lama&apos;s cane! No one is more 

 shocked than Hank when the monks tell Bobby that he may be destined to 

 become a great spiritual leader.

Bobby starts meditating and peacefully solving conflicts within the 

 neighborhood. He even takes Connie to a Buddhist Club meeting. They meditate 

 and make out. Connie, who was initially mad at Bobby for ruining her chance 

 to be a lama, is now proud to be his girlfriend. Hank is appalled and tells 

 Bobby,&quot;There will be no enlightenment in this house.&quot;He takes Bobby to see 

 Reverend Stroup to get him back in touch with his Methodist roots. But the 

 Reverend feels this is a great opportunity for Bobby to explore his 

 spirituality. Meanwhile, the monks are preparing another test and Bobby is 

 convinced he&apos;ll pass. However, Chane points out that lamas are not allowed 

 to be married or even have girlfriends, so if Bobby&apos;s the&quot;chosen one&quot;he&apos;ll 

 have to break up with Connie.

The second test is just like the first: Bobby must choose from a variety of 

 objects, including bowls, statues, a prayer drum, and an ornate hand mirror. 

 But when he sees Connie&apos;s reflection in the mirror, Bobby chooses his 

 girlfriend--and relinquishes his Little Buddha for love.

Hank refuses to pay his hair dues

Hank decides it&apos;s time for Bobby to stop letting Peggy cut his hair and go 

 to a real barber. Hank&apos;s been going to the same guy, Jack, for twenty years 

 and he&apos;s ready to share the tradition with his only son. At the barbershop, 

 Hank starts to realize Jack is getting a little senile. He spends twenty 

 minutes on Hank&apos;s Roger Staubach cut, but doesn&apos;t actually cut any of his 

 hair. Hank is worried because the company Christmas card photo is coming up 

 and he wants to look good. (They take the photo eight months early to 

 accommodate the elves&apos; vacation schedule.) He returns to Jack&apos;s and demands 

 a free touch-up. To Hank&apos;s horror, he emerges from the barber&apos;s chair a 

 bleached blonde!

Hank is despondent and doesn&apos;t know what to do. Bill promises to fix him up, 

 and pesters Hank to come over to the army base. Hank resists, telling Bill 

 that things won&apos;t be the same in the alley if Bill screws up. However, with 

 the Christmas card deadline looming and no alternatives, Hank agrees to go. 

 Bill does a wonderful job and restores Hank to his regular-guy look. Bill 

 doesn&apos;t want to charge him, but Hank insists on paying. Having never had a 

 paying customer before, Bill tells Hank he&apos;ll have the government send him a 

 bill. When the bill arrives, Hank is shocked to discover that his army issue 

 haircut cost $900!

Outraged, Hank writes his local congressman, claiming that&quot;wasting all that 

 money is like buying a haircut for Saddam Hussein.&quot;Weeks later, his hair 

 now shaggy, Hank gets a form letter from the congressman, thanking him for 

 his concern. But after a few days, some official-looking guys present Hank 

 with a check for $3,900--his reward for putting a stop to wasteful 

 government spending. Not until Dale calls Hank the&quot;Billinator&quot;does Hank 

 realize that he put Bill out of business. And with Bill out of action, Hank 

 is forced to go to Peggy&apos;s stylist, Ernst. His&quot;modern&quot;cut, complete with 

 Caesar bangs, gets Hank banned from the Christmas card photo. To remedy the 

 situation, Hank uses his reward money to buy Bill&apos;s equipment at a 

 government auction and donate it back to Bill&apos;s commander. The 

 commander--also desperate for a good haircut--reassigns Bill to his new, top 

 secret post as army barber.

Bobby hits the road with his propane comedy troupe

Bobby wants to spend his summer at theater camp, but Hank insists he intern 

 at Strickland Propane. At Strickland&apos;s annual&quot;Grill-stravaganza,&quot;there is 

 a near riot when Strickland sells out of its most popular grill. Bobby saves 

 the day by launching into a comedy routine and distracting customers until 

 the new shipment arrives. The top brass is so impressed with Bobby&apos;s 

 schtick, they want him to put together an act and visit each Strickland 

 dealership to boost morale. Hank is impressed with Bobby&apos;s natural comedic 

 talent, and helps him with his routine by sharing his extensive propane 

 knowledge.

The comedy troupe, named&quot;The Propaniacs,&quot;hits the road with a few key 

 members: Bobby, Dale, Luanne and Joe Jack. They are a smashing success with 

 gags like&quot;Gas Cop,&quot;&quot;Haz-Mat the Magnificent,&quot;and&quot;Big Baby.&quot;Their hard 

 work pays off when they get invited to perform at the Southwest Propane Gas 

 Trade Show and Conference in Arlington. Hank is especially thrilled because 

 Strickland&apos;s President, Mr. Fortner, will be in the audience. He suggests 

 that the&quot;Gas Cop&quot;arrest Fortner as part of the gag. Joe Jack--who plays 

 the Gas Cop--is a little uneasy about arresting the head of the company. The 

 night of the performance, Joe Jack disappears and Hank steps in as a last 

 minute replacement. Just after Hank&quot;arrests&quot;Mr. Fortner and drags him 

 onstage, a drunken Joe Jack shows up in his&quot;Big Baby&quot;outfit of oversized 

 diapers and nothing else. Hank and Bobby keep the gag going, but as Hank&quot;frisks&quot;Fortner he makes an embarrassing discovery: Mr. Fortner wears adult 

 diapers! Needless to say, that is the end of&quot;The Propaniacs.&quot;

Later, Hank tries to keep the bond between him and Bobby alive by staging a 

 Propaniacs Reunion at the Arlen Mall. Bobby&apos;s worried that the Arlen crowd 

 won&apos;t get many of the propane jokes, but wants to please his dad. Sure 

 enough, the comedy is a flop with the crowd. But when Bobby sees Hank 

 cracking up over his gas act, he just keeps on going.

Hank goes on an unannounced service call to a local restaurant and 

 unwittingly frees the trapped manager from the freezer. In gratitude, the 

 manager offers Hank a free dinner for four at&quot;That&apos;s Amore.&quot;Hank wants to 

 invite the guys, but Peggy insists that they double date with another 

 couple. To Peggy&apos;s dismay, Hank invites Dale and Nancy.

Dale, who still doesn&apos;t know about Nancy&apos;s ongoing affair with John Redcorn, 

 is looking forward to the night out. Nancy is upset that she has to cancel 

 her&quot;massage appointment&quot;with John, but he is actually grateful for a night 

 off. At dinner, Nancy heads straight for the bar, leaving Dale, Hank and 

 Peggy in uncomfortable silence. Dale tracks her down and sweet-talks her 

 onto the dance floor. Later, his smooth moves get them into the bedroom for 

 the first time in years. The next day, Nancy confesses to Peggy that she&apos;s 

 worried John Redcorn will find out how she&quot;cheated&quot;with her husband. Peggy 

 thinks it&apos;s the perfect chance for Nancy to put the affair behind her. Dale, 

 meanwhile, thinks that the reason Nancy has been spending so much time with 

 John is that Dale has been ignoring her. He vows to treat her with more 

 respect, which inspires Nancy to break things off with John.

To everyone&apos;s surprise, the Gribbles start acting like a couple of 

 newlyweds. Late one night, while Nancy and Dale sleep in each other&apos;s arms, 

 John sneaks into Nancy&apos;s bedroom--and is shocked to find Dale there. Dale, 

 thinking John&apos;s a burglar, hits him with a lamp and knocks him out. The next 

 day, Dale goes to apologize and offers to help John fight the government 

 over illegally seized Indian land. While he&apos;s there, Nancy shows up claiming 

 to have a migraine. Dale thinks he caused the headache and insists that she 

 start seeing John again for&quot;treatments.&quot;John and Nancy, realizing that 

 things between them are really over, refuse Dale&apos;s offer. Back at home, Dale 

 tries his hand at sensual massage as he and Nancy jump-start their 

 relationship.

A drought whets Hank&apos;s appetite for politics

When a local drought reaches Stage 3 of water conservation, Hank reluctantly 

 installs low-flow toilets. He&apos;s already forbidden Bobby from taking baths 

 and has watched his beloved lawn turn from green to brown. Kahn&apos;s lawn, 

 meanwhile, is lush and green due to his&quot;secret Asian watering technique.&quot;

Once the toilets are installed, Hank realizes that it takes 5 or 6 flushes 

 to accomplish what the&quot;high-flow&quot;toilets did in one flush. In fact, the 

 Hills are now wasting more water than they&apos;re conserving! Hank tries to get 

 his high-flow toilets back, but an old zoning law makes installing them 

 illegal. When Hank brings this before the Zoning Board, the head of the 

 board, Mr. Hashaway, tells Hank the only way to get on the agenda, is to get 

 on the board. So Hank becomes Arlen&apos;s newest board member. He tells his 

 friends,&quot;Grass can&apos;t vote, but I can sure speak for it. I tell you what.&quot;

Meanwhile, Bobby is sneaking out of Connie&apos;s room when he sees Kahn bribing 

 the DWP meter reader. Kahn&apos;s&quot;secret Asian watering technique&quot;is to ignore 

 the drought and use a lot of water! Bobby later bribes Kahn into letting him 

 take baths at his house, and letting him use the front door.&quot;

At his first board meeting, Hank tries to get the installation ordinance 

 repealed, but Hashaway immediately kills his proposal - along with Dale&apos;s 

 bid for a 12-foot, electrified fence around his property. Desperate to save 

 his lawn, Hank scrapes ice of the side of the freezer and sprinkles it 

 outside. Bobby decides to help. In the middle of the night, he uses Kahn&apos;s 

 hose to soak the front lawn. The next morning, Hank is overjoyed, but thinks 

 his freezer scrapings are responsible. The next night, Kahn catches Bobby 

 and revokes both his bath and front door privileges in exchange for hose 

 usage.

Later, Hashaway tries to blackmail Hank into dropping the toilet issue by 

 showing him photos of Bobby&apos;s late night water wasting. Hank punishes Bobby 

 and re-kills the lawn using a blowtorch! When he sees Dale plotting his new 

 fence, he discovers that Hashaway hired Dale to take the pictures. That 

 afternoon, Bobby slips while sneaking into Connie&apos;s house and winds up 

 eye-level with the low-flow commode. He notices the manufacturer&apos;s name: 

 Hashaway.

Armed with this new knowledge, Hank tries to get the board to reconsider. 

 However, they are loyal to Hashaway, regardless of his intentions. Hank 

 filibusters by reading Peggy&apos;s musings, which eventually forces the board 

 members to use the insufficient low-flow toilets down the hall. One by one, 

 they become frustrated with having to flush 6 times and rescind their&quot;nay&quot;votes. With the toilet victory under his belt, Hank resigns from politics.

Peggy unwittingly tapes a video for an online fetish site

When Peggy and Hank&apos;s double date with Nancy and Dale gets switched from 

 dinner to bowling, Peggy is completely unnerved. She reluctantly goes along, 

 and is forced to confide her shameful secret to the shoe clerk: She wears a 

 size 16! The clerk is shocked and Peggy flees the alley in shame.

Later, Peggy&apos;s getting fitted for a custom pair of bowling shoes and finds 

 out her feet have actually grown to size 16 and a half! As she sits in her 

 car, sobbing, another big-footed woman approaches and refers Peggy to Grant 

 Trimble. She assures Peggy that Trimble can make her troubles go away.

Peggy visits Trimble, who showers her with compliments about her&quot;vibrant&quot;feet. He asks her to participate in an educational film for other women with 

 foot issues. At last, Peggy feels her feet are an asset and she is overjoyed 

 at the chance to help other women regain their self-esteem. She spends the 

 rest of the afternoon posing in various&quot;foot situations.&quot;

At home, Hank is impressed with Peggy&apos;s new attitude until Dale, Bill and 

 Boomhauer call him to Bill&apos;s computer. They show him a fetish Web site 

 called peggysfeet.com, which features Peggy&apos;s video. They explain that most 

 fetishists will seek sick pleasure from watching Peggy stomp on eggs or walk 

 in mud. Hank is appalled and pays Trimble a visit at his studio. Hank 

 demands that Trimble delete Peggy from the Internet. Trimble refuses, and 

 starts to take an interest in Hank&apos;s feet. Hank leaves in disgust and goes 

 home to tell Peg.

Disappointed and ashamed, Peggy goes to confront Trimble herself. He 

 convinces her to break through the big foot prejudice and create a better 

 world. Peggy sees herself as Rosa Parks, with foot videos as her bus! 

 However, when Peggy tries to offer creative input, Trimble gets mad and 

 blurts out the truth. Peggy&apos;s feet are ugly, ugly, ugly! Devastated, Peggy 

 returns home, vowing to never show her hideous feet again.

Hank tries to console her, but it&apos;s Bobby who winds up helping. He tells her 

 that maybe her feet are ugly, but so what. After all, he&apos;s fat, but he&apos;s 

 also a lot of other things like funny and nice. Peggy knows Bobby is right 

 and begins to take pride in her unique feet. Her first order of business? 

 Announcing over the bowling alley P.A. system that she will need size 16 and

Peggy accuses country star Randy Travis of stealing her song lyrics!

Peggy excitedly shows Hank her letter from Randy Travis--or at least his 

 lawyers-- regarding some song lyrics she sent to the country superstar. 

 While he did not accept them, he did refer to Peggy as a songwriter and 

 wished her luck with&quot;her songwriting career.&quot;Later, at church, Assistant 

 Pastor Larry (guest voice Vince Gill) announces that there will be a field 

 trip to the Country Music Fan Fair in Nashville, Tennessee. Peggy soon 

 commandeers the church bus for the 14-hour trip to Nashville--much to the 

 dismay of all on board. At a pit stop, Bobby tries to call Connie but Mr. 

 Souphanousinphone tells him that Connie is out with another boy. Bobby is 

 crushed.

At the Fan Fair, Bobby and Luanne reach the Brooks&amp;Dunn booth for 

 autographs. Dunn notices Bobby&apos;s sorry state and closes the booth to counsel 

 him. Both Brooks and Dunn think Kahn is just&quot;yanking Bobby&apos;s chain&quot;about 

 Connie. Bobby feels much better now that he and Connie are&quot;back together.&quot;

In line at the Randy Travis booth Hank and Peggy are excited to meet Peggy&apos;s&quot;close, personal friend.&quot;However, their excitement is short-lived when 

 Peggy recognizes the song,&quot;This Is Just the Way God Made Me,&quot;as hers! She 

 marches right up to Randy and punches him, shouting,&quot;You stole my song!&quot;Rather than press charges, Randy meets with Peggy and Hank in his trailer to 

 sort out the situation. Peggy tells Randy that her Montana upbringing and 

 extra-large feet inspired her to write the song. When kids would tease young 

 Peggy, her grandma told her to say,&quot;That&apos;s just the way God made me.&quot;Randy 

 assures her that this isn&apos;t the first time two songwriters have used similar 

 themes. Peggy is not satisfied, but she and Hank return to the concert.

Hank goes to get a few beers and runs into Charlie Daniels in line! While 

 he&apos;s gone, Randy Travis takes the stage and takes credit for Peggy&apos;s big 

 feet story! Peggy is livid, but Hank thinks she&apos;s just taking credit for 

 things that aren&apos;t hers. Meanwhile, Bobby is bringing Brooks and Dunn his 

 mom&apos;s Apple Brown Betty pie as a thank-you, but splatters it onto the grass. 

 Luanne convinces him to just scoop it back into the pan and deliver it 

 anyway. Hank consults Pastor Larry about Peggy&apos;s claims, and the pastor 

 turns Peggy in to the police!

Together with Dale, Bill and Boomhauer, Peggy toilet papers Randy&apos;s trailer 

 in revenge. When the trailer accidentally slides into the lake, they realize 

 Randy was asleep inside! Quick-thinking Hank dives in and rescues the soaked 

 superstar. Later that afternoon, while Hank waits backstage, Peggy arrives 

 to present Randy with a peace offering--her Apple Brown Betty pie. She is 

 promptly arrested, not only for plotting against Randy Travis, but for 

 poisoning Kix Brooks--who is in the hospital! In a show of support, Hank 

 takes a big bite of Peggy&apos;s dessert and she is absolved. Meanwhile, on

 and Hank hopes that Bobby will enjoy it as much as Hank enjoyed his first 

 turkey fry. Hank even bestows the electric carving knife on an honored 

 Bobby. However, when John Redcorn speaks to Bobby and Joseph&apos;s class about 

 the raping of the Native Americans&apos; land by the white man, Bobby has a 

 change of heart regarding the holiday.

Bobby, convinced that his stupid race has ruined the lives of all Native 

 Americans, plans a protest feast called Thanks-taking. He refuses to carve 

 the turkey because&quot;it&apos;s basted in the blood of the innocents.&quot;Unfortunately, his research has led him to believe the Indians were 

 cannibals so his well-intentioned speech is totally offensive. John Redcorn 

 is already upset over not being close to Joseph, his biological son, and so 

 he runs off.

Later, Dale brings John some leftovers but fears he might be eaten and hides 

 in the bathroom. Hank, Joseph and Bobby&quot;rescue&quot;Dale and John realizes that 

 he and Joseph could at least be friends. Having been awarded 12 acres of 

 land in his government lawsuit, John gives the land to Dale - knowing it 

 will eventually go to Joseph.
In the meantime, Luanne tells Peggy that everyone hates her annual Boggle 

 tournament, so Peggy invents a new game called&quot;Spin the Choice.&quot;

Dale is forced to reevaluate his extermination business when his lungs begin

 bug killing sends Dale into a midlife crazed frenzy. He begins helping 

 Joseph with a cockroach project, and his wife, Nancy, stops sleeping with 

 him because he&apos;s out of work.

After extensive pressure from Nancy and Hank, Dale decides to take a job 

 with a local company that makes adhesives. His new job doesn&apos;t allow him to 

 smoke or wear his hat and sunglasses, but it does reignite his marital 

 flame. It doesn&apos;t take long for Dale to get promoted, though, when his boss 

 realizes Dale&apos;s unique gift for exterminating (i.e. firing) employees.

Hank and Nancy begin losing respect for Dale because of his vicious firing

 roaches by hand, without noxious fumes, and get back to the life he loves.

Hank&apos;s gone soft!

When Hank takes his family to see a&quot;chick flick,&quot;Hank gets caught up by 

 the movie&apos;s father-son symbolism and breaks out in tears. Showing a little 

 concern, but more excitement, Peggy practices her amateur psychology to 

 analyze Hank&apos;s newfound emotions. She determines that Hank has been crying 

 because of his own relationship with Bobby. It turns out, though, that Hank 

 is crying because his old truck is now on its last legs and he can&apos;t seem to 

 fix it anymore.

Convinced that Hank is really hiding his feelings for Bobby, Peggy urges 

 Bobby to spend time helping Hank fix his truck. When all rescue attempts 

 fail to fix the truck to full working status, Bobby suggests they go to a 

 repair shop 40 miles away that&apos;s supposed to work miracles. Hank grudgingly 

 agrees, but when the repair shop really turns out to be a truck retailer, 

 Hank turns right around and heads back to Arlen, now mad at Bobby.

Halfway out of town, the truck stalls on some railroad tracks. The truck 

 won&apos;t start up again and a train comes along and destroys it. Extra angry 

 with Bobby, Hank walks back to the truck dealer blaming Bobby for the 

 disaster. When they get there, Bobby decides to leave Hank and walk home in 

 the pouring rain. Hank soon realizes that Bobby is gone, so he borrows a

 Hank finally catches up to Bobby; they reunite inside the new truck and bond 

 over the beauty of all the new features the truck has to offer.

After the emotional ribbon-cutting ceremony, Ladybird refuses to enter the

 b : 10-Feb-2002 pc : 6ABE09 w : John Altschuler , Dave Krinsky 
NOTE: An episode of&quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which airs on the same network and the 

 same night as&quot;King of the Hill&quot;, was also named&quot;I&apos;m with Cupid&quot; Featured Music: Sum41-&quot;In Too Deep&quot; In every episode at the very end of the credits a

 and Connie form a bluegrass band. When they see a contest is taking place in 

 Branson, MO., Hank books them a spot.

In Branson, Hank becomes more like Kahn and pressures Connie into practicing 

 all the time. Because of the pressure, Connie quits the band and Bobby goes 

 with her. Bobby is also disenfranchised when Hank doesn&apos;t think his Yakov 

 Smirnoff jokes are funny. Kahn figures out that Connie is in Branson and not 

 in Ft. Worth where she&apos;s supposed to be auditioning for a music school. He 

 and Hank go after Connie and Bobby and both realize that they&apos;ve been too 

 hard on their kids and should let them pursue their own hopes and dreams.
  
 b : 03-Mar-2002 pc : 6ABE14 w : Norm Hiscock d : Tricia Garcia 
NOTE: A week after the airing of this episode The Simpsons also went to 

 Branson in the episode&quot;The Old Man and the Key.&quot; 115. Unfortunate Son   
VFW no longer has enough living members to pay dues so it is forced to close 

 down. In an attempt to get Cotton off his hands, Hank tries to get the WWII 

 vets to allow the Vietnam vets in the VFW. The problem is that the two 

 different groups of war vets have a long history of animosity towards each 

 other; the WWII vets think the Vietnam vets lost the war and the Vietnam 

 vets just want acceptance.

Hank begrudgingly allows Cotton to stay with him and as a result forges a 

 strange bond that never existed before.

 a position at a Catholic school, ending her budding career at Strickland 

 Propane.
  
 b : 17-Mar-2002 pc : 6ABE07 
NOTE: Accoring to the original story on Fox.com, the original ending was for 

 Peggy to learn about Catholicism from Bill and teach it to the Catholic 

 students, then leave without revealing her identity. But the ending was 

 changed prior to the airing of the episode to one in which Peggy comes 

 clean. 117. Tankin&apos; it to the Streets

NOTE: In this episode the gang creates the&quot;Rainey Street Country Club&quot;indicating that they live on Rainey Street. However in episode 92 (&apos;Twas the 

 Nut Before Christmas) Bill refers to himself as the Milton Street Santa 

 indicating that they live on Milton Street. Since Hank and Bill live on 

 opposite sides of the same street this is either an inconsistency or means 

 that they live at the corner of Rainey st. and Milton st. In the original story, Hank received mmbership to 

 the country club but Kahn didn&apos;t, and instead joined the&quot;Rainey Street 

 Country Club.&quot; 120. Beer and Loathing gs : Megan Mullally (Teresa)

 cover to keep him in the dark about Dad being in the closet.
  
 b : 28-Apr-2002 pc : 6ABE16 w : Alex Gregory , Peter Huyck d : Cyndi Tang-Loveland 
NOTE: The original story for this episode had nothing to do with Dale and 

 Nancy&apos;s&quot;rewedding.&quot;Instead, the plot involved Dale&apos;s paranoia extending to 

 his fear of dental visits, and his contempt for his father was that he left 

 home claiming that he had business with the government, not because he 

 kissed Dale&apos;s wife. 123. Sug Night   
Hank is shaken after having a dream about grilling burgers...naked...with 

 Nancy. And the situation is stirred when Peggy finds out.

 an overblown media event. That forces Cotton to admit to Hank that the&quot;widow&quot;was never married, and the&quot;action&quot;did not occur in battle. 

 Meanwhile, back home, Dale and Bill prove themselves dedicated house sitters 

 by dressing up as Hank and Peggy; and Luanne finds a replacement dog when 

 she thinks she has killed Ladybird.
  
 b : 12-May-2002 pc : 6ABE20 w : Kit Boss , Etan Cohen   126. Returning Japanese (2) gs : Keith Carradine (Jomichero Hill) 
It is revealed that Hank has a long-lost half-brother, who later disowns his 

 American relatives. Angered by this, Cotton plans to spit in the face of the 

 Japanese Emperor Akihito at a ceremony honoring WW2 veterans later that 

 night. As the Hill Brothers try to stop their father, they come to realize 

 how much they have in common. When Cotton finally meets the emperor, his 

 lost son calls him&quot;dad,&quot;and he shakes Akihito&apos;s hand rather then spit on

 b : 24-Nov-2002 pc : 6ABE01 w : Kit Boss 
NOTE: Originally scheduled to air on November 18th, 2001. Was fed via 

 satellite that morning, even. Football ran over, so the majority of the 

 country didn&apos;t see it. But the episode WAS seen then in areas without

When Dale sells a gun at the bookstore, Peggy is upset-but changes her mind 

 when Dale gives her part of the proceeds. Reluctantly, she lets Dale sell 

 guns there.

Meanwhile, Peggy has finally made it to the book club by bribing some of the

NOTE: This episode is supposed to be at Halloween, it is quite obvious, 

 since the Hills have Halloween decor all around and on the house... This episode was produced in season 5, and

 punishment-locking Bobby in a small chamber knwon as&quot;the hole,&quot;where 

 Cotton was sent himself. When Hank finds out about this from Didi, he rushes 

 to the camp, where Cotton is about to release Bobby. To Hank&apos;s relief, Bobby 

 comes out unharmed, and even jokes about his experience. Cotton is upset, 

 but Hank assures Cotton that Bobby is fine the way he is. What gave Bobby

 as an aspiring poker shark. But they&apos;re really tarot cards, and Bobby&apos;s

 powers and defying his father.

NOTE: This episode is being called the 150th episode, but as you can see 

 it&apos;s actually the 149th episode. Ward Rackley is named after an intern at the KotH 

 offices. Bill mentions Leoma, being the first girlfriend 

 he&apos;s had for more than an episode. This could have three outcomes here 1. A 

 story arch developes to end after a few episodes (like Leoma dies or 

 something) 2. The relationship is forgotten before season 8 3. The story 

 arch actually goes somewhere
