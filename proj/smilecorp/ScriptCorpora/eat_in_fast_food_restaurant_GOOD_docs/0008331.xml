 ﻿ Restaurant Memories Recalled Dining places prompt fond memories      Have you dined as Smokie&apos;s lately, or do you remember it better as Drake&apos;s, Hoffman&apos;s or Heide&apos;s? Long-time residents believe that the long-time Biddle Street restaurant may have had other names before these. Do you recall?    Do you remember dining at Frank Palumbo&apos;s Morey&apos;s Grove on Jefferson in Trenton or having a meal at the Poplars -- on Sibley Road, just adjacent to the railroad tracks. Diners remember the restaurant shaking whenever a train rumbled by.    Folks still miss Cunigan&apos;s Shrimp House on Southfield in Ecorse. Many think it was unequaled by any seatfood restaurant in the area.          Watkins was a favorite hamburger stop for teens and adults, as well. On occasion, the American Legion Post 217 on Biddle schedules a Watkins night to satisfy the longings of its former customers and also to dish out a bit of nostalgia with the burgers..    Students from Roosevelt High School darted across the street to have lunch at the Teddy Bear or -- time permitting -- went to the lunch counters at the Kresge and Neisner stores on Biddle.  Students from Schafer High School hung out at Lamb&apos;s Drive-In on Eureka and Syd&apos;s on Fort Street.     Corrigan&apos;s Restaurant on the south side of Wyandotte had an air of mystery about it stemming from its Prohibition days. The clientele was worth the trip -- everyone from the suit-and-tie crowd employed at the chemical factories to mechanics in greasy uniforms rubbed elbows at Corrigan&apos;s. The tale was told that Al Capone regularly stopped there for a meal on his way to -- or from -- Chicago, but I never heard a first-hand account of his visits. The Friday Special included baked beans along with fish and chips.  Did any other restaurant serve this combination? A long-time resident said he was first served fries with gravy at Corrigan&apos;s.        I faintly remember a restaurant called, The Timbers, on Dix-Toledo in Southgate, but since I never dined there, I don&apos;t have any memories to share -- other than its name.     A treat enjoyed by Downriver people for the past half century has been a cone or sundae at Bob-Joes on Quarry Road and Fort Street. The building has remained essentially the same since it was converted from its former use as a portable voting precinct. Going to Bob-Joe&apos;s becomes a family tradition when youngsters get their first taste of a small cone and continues through the years when they order sundaes -- with sprinkles -- and later bring their own children there. Just remember to get your final Bob-Joe&apos;s treat of the season before Labor Day. If not, you&apos;ll have to wait until spring. Even if the temperature reaches unseasonable 80s after Labor Day, Bob-Joe&apos;s ends its season on the Labor Day wekend.    A great trivia question for the future would be: How many fast food restaurant are there in Southgate? or How many restaurants are within the borders of the Southgate Shopping Center?

 over 1 year ago Laura Kelly responded: I remember the restaurant being called Symack&apos;s before it was Heide&apos;s. The same people owned another one called Bill Symack&apos;s on Dix in Lincoln Park. It was my Dad&apos;s favorite place to eat. The story I heard was the two were owned by a husband and wife. When they divorced he kept the one on Dix and the wife got the one in Wyandotte. She removed his name from it and called it Heide&apos;s which I guess was her first name! Our favorite Lincoln Park high school hangout was a drive-in hamburger stand on Dix called the Golden Point. I also remember going to Courtesy&apos;s on Jefferson near the entrance to Elizabeth Park. There was also a little root beer stand on Jefferson near McLouth&apos;s called Bar-Don&apos;s and one on Fort Street near Goddard in Lincoln Park called Mar-Jon&apos;s. There was another root beer stand on the Southgate side of Fort near Eureka but I can&apos;t remember the name--Does anyone know? 

 over 1 year ago Tony Galano (Facebook) responded: The Golden Point was on Dix a block or two north of Champaign. THE HAMBURGERS WERE GOOD, BUT THE ROOT BEER WAS AWFUL. 

 over 1 year ago Tony Galano (Facebook) responded: Does anybody remember the Southgate Airport that was right across Trenton Road from where the shopping center is now? And when people would pheasant hunt where the Southgate Soping Center is today? 

 over 1 year ago Tony Galano (Facebook) responded: The Timbers was right where the post office is today. 

 over 1 year ago Tony Galano (Facebook) responded: Let&apos;s see in Southgate on Fort Street going north to south, there&apos;s Taco Bell/ Pizza Hut Express,Sonic,Mc Donalds, White Castle, Tim Hortons. On NorthLine you have Tim Hortons, Wendy&apos;s, Arby&apos;s, Mc Donald&apos;s. Going west on Eureka there&apos;s A&amp;W;,Little Caesars, Taco Bell, Popeye&apos;s, Mc Donald&apos;s, Burger King.Oh, and Dunkin Donuts.land Subway.
The other chain resataurants in Southgate are on Fort Street, Pizza Hut, Ram&apos;s Horn. On Dix there&apos;s Carrabbas, Subway. On Eureka there&apos;s Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera Bread, Old Country Buffet, and Olive Garden. On Trenton Rd. you have Chili&apos;s and Old Chicago.
 

 over 1 year ago Joan Dyer responded: Tony - You get an A-plus for remembering so many of our local restaurants. (How about Logan&apos;s?)
Wish that some of our Trenton friends would add some memories of Amanda&apos;s, which served the world&apos;s best Lemon Meringue Pie, and some of the other restaurants in town. Did you ever eat at the Trenton Hotel, when it actually was a hotel, seving mostly retirees? 

 over 1 year ago TonyOn301 (Twitter) responded: Sorry about Forgeting Logan&apos;s. And the Dairy Queen, also. Do you remember the Dog N Suds drive in where the Tin Man Oil Change is now? Do you remember when the only Mc Donald&apos;s Downriver was the one on Eureka in Southgate? I think it had a &quot;hangout&quot; reputation then. This was before Ronald Mc Donald, Big Macs, and Happy Meals.
No, I&apos;ve never been to the Trenton Hotel
 

 over 1 year ago Joan Dyer responded: ﻿ Yes, Tony, I remember the Dog N Suds, but confess I had forgotten about it until you mentioned it. And, I also recall when the McDonald&apos;s on Eureka was the only one in town. At the time, they had a big sign showing how many Burgers had been sold by the chain, and reflecting the growth by the millions -- I think they discontinued the count when it got into the billions! 

 over 1 year ago Jim Boutilier responded: enjoy your blog.Born and raised in downriver but moved to Florida 30 years ago.Riverview still is home. I remember most of the dining spots mentioned above.A few more were-D.J.&apos;s truck stop on Fort Street [where the Forge later was built] best fries in town,McDonalds in Riverview [our high school hangout],Symacks[not sure of the spelling] and their $1.95 veal cutlet dinners ,Heide&apos;s on Biddle and their hamburger steak,Frank&apos;s Pizzaria in Wyandotte-good Perch dinners of all things!Good times 

 over 1 year ago Frank responded: Enjoyed your blog Joan. My grandfather was Frank Palumbo, owner of Moorey&apos;s Grove in Trenton. Nice to know some people still feel nostalgic about the good ole days in the downriver area. 

 over 1 year ago Joan Dyer responded: ﻿   Frank - I have a lot of fond memories of Moorey&apos;s Grove, as I am sure many Downriverites do. How did it come by its name? I remember the sign outside reading, &quot; Palumbo&apos;s Moorey&apos;s Grove.&quot; 

 over 1 year ago Sue Philips responded: This is way cool. My husband and I were watching American Pickers and they had a show about the Dog N Suds. I mentioned to him about the one on Eureka Rd. in Southgate and my hubby didn&apos;t remember it (he is 5 years older than I am, so this blew me away). Anyway, I started googling to see if I remembered correctly and lo and behold here was your blog. Nice to see all the memories. Do you remember the old Howard Johnson&apos;s on Dix-Toledo close to Eureka Rd., where my husband always ordered fried clams when he was younger. He mentioned the Wabeek Tea Room on Biddle Avenue. My mother loved the Riviera Restaurant on Biddle in Wyandotte. She always ordered hot beef sandwiches with french fries and everything covered in gravy (including the fries). As a kid my parents took us to Corrigan&apos;s ALL the time. I remember Neisner&apos;s, I loved playing on their staircase. Do you remember going to Sears in Wyandotte and looking at your feet through their x-ray machine in the shoe department? My favorite of all time though was having a sundae at Affholter&apos;s Ice Cream on Grove St. in Wyandotte (it was a sundae shop just like in the movies, with a counter and booths and juke boxes). 

 over 1 year ago Sue Philips responded: Cuingan&apos;s Shrimp House on Southfield Rd was a great place for a fancy meal. Another one of my mom&apos;s favorite places was Blazo&apos;s Pie Shop, which had a fireplace in it for ambiance, (it was on Trenton Road in Southgate) across from the Southgate Shopping Center (it is now an X-Ray and dental office). What about Little Skipper&apos;s on Fort St in Wyandotte (my hubby and I met there at the end of the 60&apos;s). Also, the Big Boy on Goddard and Dix-Toledo was a great drive-in hangout place. Do any of you remember the below ground public restrooms in Wyandotte located on Biddle and Maple (where the Owl&apos;s Korner is now)? Who would go down there to one of those now-a-days??? The first McDonald&apos;s in Southgate you couldn&apos;t even go inside to eat, you walked up to the windows and placed your order and went back to your car, no car-hops and no drive-thru window. My mom would take my niece (who is now 50, omg) to the A&amp;W;on Eureka in Southgate and she would order a Baby Beer, my niece wouldn&apos;t have anything to do with it because she thought it was (her words here) booze. Then my mom stuck her finger in the root beer and popped it into my niece&apos;s mouth and then my niece said &quot;that&apos;s not beer, that is pop&quot; and she loved it. Isn&apos;t it funny, Michigan calls it pop, everywhere else calls it soda. 

 over 1 year ago Larry Wright responded: Moving over to Taylor, you can&apos;t forget &quot;Peppy&apos;s&quot; Hamburgers on Ecorse Rd next door to the Ecorse Drive-In Theater. Peppy&apos;s was actually the forerunner to McDonalds in Southgate . . . AND, was the first of its kind to hire girls to work the front counter (two cheerleaders from Kennedy HS). Back in the early 60&apos;s it was all males working in that type of restaurant.
Peppy&apos;s had home-made fries (not frozen), hot dogs, fish sandwiches and burgers, shakes and pop. We used to sell the fries by the 1 lb sacks for those who wanted to take them home.
Drag racing on Ecorse Rd and cruising thru Peppy&apos;s was a regular weekend activity.
PS - I was the manager from 1966-68 at that store. 

 over 1 year ago Joan Dyer responded: ﻿ Thanks for the memories, Larry. Yes, I remember Peppy&apos;s Hamburgers, but had almost forgotten the Ecorse Drive-In -- used to mostly frequent the Michigan and Fort-George Drive-Ins. 

 over 1 year ago Joan Dyer responded: ﻿ Glad that the blog sparked some memories for you, Sue, and, in turn, you stirred up some memories for me! I do remember the Howard Johnson&apos;s on Dix-Toledo and their famous fried clams. Interesting that you mentioned the Wabeek Tea Room, because I just remembered that I did not include it in my listing of Wyandotte restaurants. Many retirees patronized the Tea Room, and (as a youngster) I always noticed how well dressed they were when they went to the restaurant. (Of course, those were the days when people usually dressed up to dine -- no sweat suits, T-shirts and baseball caps.) 

 over 1 year ago Jean R responded: As a student at Roosevelt, we used to hightail it to lunch at the &quot;Big Ched&quot; and the Rivera&quot; on Biddle...about where Lichee Gardens is now. And we all know that both Frank&apos;s Pizza and Lichee Gardens were on Eureka and 3rd for the longest time. Both businesses were moved in the early 60&apos;s to Biddle
Joan, Sharon, used to own the Teddy Bear in Wyandotte; in the 90&apos;s, I believe.

I loved Timbers, the food was better than excellent, the atmosphere was something you see in old movies and the sevice was subplime. But there is one famous story I remember about Timbers: a customer who kept sending their steak back because it wasn&apos;t done enough. After the 3rd return, the chef is rumored to have exited the kitchen with a large cleaver in one hand a the
steak in the other. He set in on the table with words that cannot be repeated here.
The fire destroyed the building but not the memories of cozy dinners with a new husband.
 

 over 1 year ago Joan Dyer responded: ﻿ Jean - I knew you&apos;d have some good stories to share. Thanks for the memories! Wonder if others have memories about the Timbers -- if so, I bet they can&apos;t top yours. 

 8 months ago karen responded: The drive in restruant on Fort Street was Little Skippers Remember that one? How about Sibley Gardens is it still there? Memories, Memories....they are great. 

 8 months ago Joan Dyer responded: ﻿ Little Skippers is still remembered by a lot of Downriver residents, but I can&apos;t remember ever eating there. I was an A&amp;W fan! As for Sibley Gardens, it is still there -- in the same location -- and popular with area residents. Because of its location near many industrial plants, it was always a favorite with managers and their guests. My brother recalls being wined and dined there by sales representatives when he was a manager at Chevrolet Gear and Axle (later American Axle) on the Hamtramck -Detroit border. It was a long drive, but, as my brother recalls, a lunch at Sibley Gardens was well worth the drive. And, in those days, no one worried about long lunch hours. 

 5 months ago kennylia responded: does anyone remember the &quot;poplar inn&quot; ,, ??? i believe it was in wyandotte, i&apos;m not sure exactly where it was, but it was an old house that serve home cooked meals... it was not fancy. i remember going there in the late 1950&apos;s where i was a little kid. i can&apos;t find anything on it anywhere. thank you 

 5 months ago jryski responded: Wasn&apos;t it in Riverview on Sibley Rd between Jefferson and the RR tracks? I never went but remember people talking about it, especially the frog legs.  Jean

 5 months ago Jim Boutilier responded: I do remember it and yes it was right next to the Railroad tracks.Enjoyed sitting in the little rooms for the private dining.Does anyone remember the old truck stop D.J.&apos;s in Riverview on Fort Street.Used to go their as a kid.Good hamburgers but a little greasy.How about Corrigans in Wyandotte?Good fried chicken and french fries with gravy.Also a resturaunt in old Trenton called Amandas (on Jefferson?] that had great soup and pies.

 

 5 months ago Joan Dyer responded: ﻿ In my recollection, the Poplar Inn was on Sibley Road, west of Biddle (or East Jefferson) just next to the railroad tracks. Every time I passed by, I was intrigued by the old, gray building and thought about having dinner there -- But, I never did. I also believe that a fire destroyed the building not too long after the time you remember dining there I&apos;ll check with some of my &quot;Red Hat&quot; friends to see if they have better memories than I have, and pass along any information.. Joan Dyer. 

 5 months ago kennylia responded: thanks for the information !!!!!   i was very young when we went there , maybe 4 or 5 years old, that would be 1956 or so. we VERY RARELY went anywhere out to eat, but i do remember that, thanks again for the info,   kenny gyetvay
 
 

 5 months ago kennylia responded: hi ,, another person wrote saying the same location. i knew it was out that way, i&apos;m from allen park, but i couldn&apos;t remember exactly. i was only 4 years old in 1956, and that is about the time i went.  we RARELY went out to eat back then, maybe a pizza from pepina&apos;s once in a while. but i remember upstairs at the poplar inn, clashing dishes&amp;such. seems like it was an old,former house ????  anyways , thanks very much for responding, i&apos;ll keep with this site, as i&apos;m obsessed with the history of the down river area now.  thanks again,  kenny gyetvay
