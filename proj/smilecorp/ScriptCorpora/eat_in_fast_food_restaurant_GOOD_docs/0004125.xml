 This is a BIg pet peeve of mine. The answer is NO. You have purchased that property and it is now yours. They have zero right to search you.Period. I refuse all the time.A police officer couldn&apos;t look in your bag without a warrant or probable cause. I sure as hell am not letting some 5 dollar and hour wanna be look.
If they think you are shoplifting, they can detain you and search you but they have better have evidence or they will be the ones arrested when the police arrive. I consider it insulting and essentially accusing every customer of being a shoplifter. Plus, if you watch them, they very rarely actually look, which means they are wasting my time. A store has no more right to search you or detain you then any other person.
The problem is people accept it and go along with it. These are probably also the same people who cry about civil rights and the patriot act, yet they let some square badge violate their rights without blinking and eye!
And NO they do not have any legal right to stop you for any reason except to make a citizens arrest, like any citizen can do.
Bottom line, we have a constitution that prohibits unlawful search and seizure. BY ANYONE! There is no addendum that says target or Wal Mart can search you. They can not. If they are stopping you because they suspect you of shop lifting, that is a totally different story. To just stand there and ask to see everyones bag, while not illegal, is not required. It is purely voluntary. I have never shown my receipt or purchases (except at Cosco and the like) and I have never been detained, chased etc.
Why? Because they can&apos;t without.....class? Probable cause!

 You should be happy to have them check , legal or not. Help them catch shoplifters. That item you just bought cost a little extra because of store losses.

 No way. Once you purchase the item it is YOUR PROPERTY. They don&apos;t have any more right to search the bag than they do to strip search you unless you have signed a contract allowing them to do so, which could happen if you are using a discount warehouse like Costco. Not do they have any right to detain you. If they do it is a form of kidnapping known as unlawful imprisonment.

People put up with this because they are used to it. But in fact the only right a store has is to request that you leave their premises and never return. It they try something more call the cops.

 If you think they are singling you out because of race, feel free to get the information of their district manager, and their corporate office information.


Different companies have different policies, some of which are set up based on the legal access those companies have. Companies like walmart, with a billion lawers on retainer, have the ability to take anyone to court. They choose to do so, knowing that most people do not have the funds to provide their own lawers and will often drop the case.


Where I worked, the only time we were allowed to stop individuals if:
1. we see what they took
2. where they consealed it.
3. did not break line of sight the remaining time they were in the store.

In stead we were incouraged to be extra helpful to those individuals, giving them extensive personalized attention while they were shoping.

(it actually works, and 9 times out of 10, they got scared and left the stuff they were going to steal... or they would go ahead and buy it, only to return it shortly there after.)

 Yes they do if they have reason to believe you have been doing a little&quot;creative&quot;shopping. I owned a convenience store a while back. Been there done that. You would be amazed how much money you can lose if you don&apos;t keep that stuff in check.

 Put it this way. If it is a random check, and you have nothing to hide, it costs you nothing except a minute of your time. If you refuse, they can&apos;t accost you unless someone has actually seen what appeared to be a theft by you. However, it is private property. They could tell you you are banned, and not to come back if they deem you undesirable. They could post a photo with security, and if you come back you could be arrested for trespassing. Does it happen often? No, of course not, it isn&apos;t really good for business.
One of our stores get around the problem by taping shut any bags people bring into the store, and stapling shut the bags of purchases. The only bags searched are those that people won&apos;t let them tape, or bags that are taped, then re-opened (that looks really suspicious).

And don&apos;t you just love how people talk about&quot;rights&quot;? You are going onto private property.

 the reason they check is because too much merchandise is going out the door that is not being paid for. Our store does this checking&quot;randomly&quot;and it is a pain in the ***. However, they are only suppose to check your receipt for items that are too big to put in their small bags. If they would get BIG bags for larger items it would take care of the problem. Wal-Mart use to have the big bags but I guess the idiots that run the Company did away with them. trying to save a buck, I guess....more money in their pocket. don&apos;t get upset with the employee for doing what he is told....complain to management.....however, with Wal-Mart...to put it bluntly...
they don&apos;t give a ****! WAL-MART SUCKS!!!!

 You people are crazy. Have you know backbone? No one has the right to check your fing bags if you just paid for them unless you specifically consented to such an action with your purchase which you did not unless its in big bold letters (and if it is my personal suggestion is that you stop shopping there). If you stopped at a friends house and they asked to check your bags on the way out&quot;just in case&quot;I&apos;m sure you would scoff at the idea. Stand up for what rights you have (or should have) before you have nothing left.

 They can ask, but you can ignore them and keep walking. If they detain you, sue them for false imprisonment.

 Not if it&apos;s in big letters. They have to specifically state that. Most private&quot;club&quot;stores can do that because they have it stated in the contract you sign ( you know like Costco or Sam&apos;s club)..but Wal-mart cannot if they do not make it clear.

Maybe you should check again. THEY CANNOT do that involuntarily period. You have to sign an agreement in order for them to do it forcefully (in other words you have no choice.)

 I don&apos;t know if that is legal or not.
But I have had stores search me once or twice.
I cooperated.
They had kinda halfassed reasons though.
(security people can be kinda DUMB)

Funny you should mention Walgreens.
The Walgreens in West Seattle..High Point.
They have sign that says all bags must be checked at counter.
I go in all the time carrying a bag.
they&apos;ve never said anything to me.
cause I am 56 year old guy.
I suspect they got girls coming in a stealing makeup.

 No they can&apos;t ask to check every bag leaving the store, this is a violation of a person&apos;s right to privacy, unless they have reason to believe that the person has stolen something inside the store, then they have the right to search the bag with firm belief, and with enough evidence to convince the person and the authority that the person do indeed stolen something then they will search the bag only then that it is legally on the store&apos;s jurisdiction. On the case of receipt they have the right to ask them before you leave,if you purchase something inside the store, if none, I donot think you have to present something out of nothing.

 Yes. It is legal for them to check your bags. The only thing they cannot do is detain you (if you have not stolen anything). The law gives retailers the right to inspect bags at any given time.

EDIT**

I have worked in Loss Prevention for 5 years now and we get paid no where near 5 something an hour! Are you kidding me!! Try 40k. I haven&apos;t made 5 something an hour since I was in high school. To work in LP, you are trusted with highly sensitive information and must be credible. They are never going to hire someone into LP starting at no less than 28k.
The retailer or its employees will NOT be arrested for a&quot;bad stop&quot;. Even if you were detained.
The only one who will be arrested is the shoplifter. Any law abiding citizen should not be offended by a LP investigator checking their purchase or receipt. Don&apos;t forget, you are on private property. A retailer that is not like Costco, Sam&apos;s or Fry&apos;s and does not have associates standing at the doors with a highlighter, will not just stand at the door checking everyone&apos;s bags for no reason. We simply do not have time for that anyways. We are more interested in Internal theft, being that is the greater cause of shrink.

Oh--I see references to&quot;security people&quot;. What a stereotype. Loss Prevention is not Security. We do not wear uniforms and carry flashlights driving around in golf carts. Two totally different jobs!

One last thing...You can file a lawsuit if you want if you have been detained without a shoplifting incident, however, be prepared to&quot;stand in line&quot;to never see a courtroom.

 Yes, they have every right to do that. They&apos;re supposed to check your reciept if you have a lot of groceries, or if that little alarm goes off. The only one who can legally check your bag(purse) is a secruity officer, the manager or employee cant. But if your talking about your walmart bag, yes they can check that.

 Yes it&apos;s legal. Normally they only ask if you have a lot of purchases or if you set off the alarm. It&apos;s not an invasion of your privacy because of everything that gets stolen from them it is better that way.
