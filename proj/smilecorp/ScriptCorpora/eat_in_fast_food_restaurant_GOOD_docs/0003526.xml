A comparison of food safety knowledge among restaurant managers, by source of training and experience, in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma.

Introduction

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), agency of the U.S. Public Health Service since 1973, with headquarters in Atlanta; it was established in 1946 as the Communicable Disease Center.  ( CDC See Control Data, century date change and Back Orifice. 
 CDC - Control Data Corporation ) has estimated
that each year 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000
deaths are due to foodborne illnesses A foodborne illness (also foodborne disease ) is any illness resulting from the consumption of food. Although foodborne illness is commonly called food poisoning , this is often a misnomer. , with a majority of the reported
cases being traced to public eating establishments (Council for
Agriculture Science and Technology, 1994; Economic Research Service,
1994; Riben et al., 1994). The increase in the number of people
patronizing restaurants has been accompanied by an increased risk of
illnesses being transmitted by food handlers handlers

frequent travel and international distribution of food products, along
with increased emphasis on streamlining trade through minimizing import
restrictions, safe food-handling practices are imperative given the
potential for widespread outbreaks of foodborne illness.

The two practices of retail establishments that are most commonly
reported as contributing to foodborne illness are improper holding and
storage temperatures and poor personal hygiene personal hygiene  person n → Körperhygiene f    among food handlers
(Collins, 2001). Recognizing these areas of concern, the National
Restaurant Association ( NRA NRA

to combat food-handling problems is training directed toward the

program and a group that had not showed that completion of the food
safety program improved performance (Stevenson, 1987). While many
studies showed similar results (Clingman, 1976; Nabali, Bryan, Ibrahim,&amp;Atrash, 1986; Palmer, Hatlen,&amp;Jackson, 1975), others
indicated no reduction in inspection violations as a result of food
safety training (Addis, Yashuk, Clapp,&amp;Blake, 1989; Teel, Fowler,&amp;Jacobs, 1981). Mathias et al. (1994) found no significant
association between the number of individuals trained in food safety and
reported inspection violations or reported cases of foodborne illness;
they concluded with a recommendation that the effectiveness and
efficiency of the education program be further evaluated.

Education/Training in Oklahoma

In Oklahoma, as in other states, regulatory agencies and industry
share the burden of preventing and managing foodborne illness. Oklahoma
state regulations mandate that 1) a food service establishment license

have at least one properly trained food service operator ( FSO ( F ree S pace O ptics) Transmitting optical signals through the air using infrared lasers.

 3.  the 1998 City-County Health Department of Oklahoma
County Consumer Protection Annual Report, reports of foodborne illness
in Oklahoma County have increased each year lot the past several years

L.  cross-contaminated with raw chicken. The
report concluded that ensuring that restaurant employees receive
training in food safety could reduce risks of foodborne illness in
restaurants.

Despite considerable progress in training, foodborne illness
continues to be a public health problem. Oklahoma County does not have
an education follow-up plan designed to determine the current level of
knowledge of food service workers or gauge the effectiveness of the FSO
certification training program. To date, no evaluation of food service
managers&apos; baseline knowledge of food safety criteria has been
conducted.

The study reported here therefore sought to evaluate basic food
safety knowledge among those in charge of facility operations. In
addition, the analysis looked at levels of knowledge among individual
FSOs with different levels of experience and trained by different
sources. Finally,; recognizing that the FSO of a facility is not
required to be present during operations, the authors examined
differences in knowledge between FSOs and their designees.

Methods

The study team developed a questionnaire designed to measure a food
service manager&apos;s general knowledge of food safety principles and
criteria. Thirteen questions on basic food safety principles and the
spread and prevention of foodborne illnesses were derived from food
safety criteria and from Essentials of Food Safety and Sanitation (2nd
edition), a text used in Oklahoma City/County food safety courses
(McSwane et al., 2000) (Figure 1). The questionnaire asked each
participant to identify the length of employment in the food industry,
estimate the number of hours of food safety training received, estimate
the time lapsed LEGACY, LAPSED.

questionnaires during routine inspections to the person identified as
manager at food service establishments. Oklahoma City/County health
inspectors randomly inspect approximately 1,000 medium- and high-risk
food service establishments per month. Upon completion, the
questionnaires were placed in a sealed envelope and returned to the
study group; managers not willing to participate were asked to return
blank questionnaires.

Questionnaires were coded by a single individual and entered into a
database; questions left blank were coded as missing information. After
the data were reviewed for entry errors, individual scores were
determined as the percentage of questions answered correctly, and descriptive statistics descriptive statistics

ranked sum test, with [alpha] = .05 established as the level of
significance.

Results

A total of 231 surveys were returned (193 completed, 38 blank),
yielding an 83.5 percent response rate. Survey scores were determined
(calculated) as the percentage of questions answered correctly (Table
2). The mean score for completed surveys was 87.2 percent.

The results indicate that, overall, food safety knowledge was high
(87.2 percent), although in some subject areas there were significant
deficiencies of knowledge. Different groups gave statistically different
levels of performance (Table 3). The respondents who had received both
health department and corporate training had the highest scores (average
score = 92.8), while the group that had received no formal training had
the lowest scores (average score = 79.5 percent). Managers with health
department training performed almost 10 points better than those who had
received corporate training. Individuals holding an FSO certification
significantly outscored uncertified un·cer·ti·fied

 Adj. 1.  respondents.

The number of hours of training had little effect on scores. The
mean score of the group with more than 40 hours of training was not
significantly different than that of the group that had received less
than 10 hours of training. It is encouraging to note that almost 22
percent of participants had received more than 40 hours of training and
that 76 percent had received more than 10 hours.

Although it is widely accepted that the average age and years of
experience are low among food service workers, the managers
participating in this study had a significant base of experience; 75
percent of respondents had five or more years of experience in the
industry, while 15 percent had more than 20 years experience. Mean
scores increased with experience, except in the case of the group with
tenures in the industry of more than 24 years, and those with one to
four years of experience had a significantly lower score than those with
longer tenures (more than 20 years).

Training appeared to be an ongoing process, with 56 percent of
respondents having received training within 15 months of the survey and
28 percent within the last five months. Only 16 percent of the
respondents had not received training within the previous 2.5 years. A
comparison of the knowledge base of those recently trained (less than
six months prior to the survey) with those trained more than 25 months
prior to the survey indicated no significant difference in scores (p =
.0970).

Groups were also compared according to the percentage of correct
responses given to individual questions (Table 4). Not surprisingly, the
group that had not received formal training performed poorest on many
survey questions. Half of this group could not identify proper
handwashing techniques (as a whole, only 75 percent of study
participants could identity proper handwashing methods). This group also
had much less understanding of temperature and food storage
requirements. For all survey participants, Question 8, which dealt with
recognizing hepatitis A Hepatitis A   Definition 

Hepatitis A is an inflammation of the liver caused by a virus, the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It varies in severity, running an acute course, generally starting within two to six weeks after contact with the virus, and lasting no  symptoms, was the question most commonly
answered incorrectly (31 percent gave incorrect answers). Questions
dealing with temperatures and food storage were also often answered
incorrectly by more than one group. The group with corporate-only
training actually fared worse than the untrained group on Question 1,
which dealt with identification of the temperature danger zone. This
group also did not have a good understanding of appropriate storage of
meats in refrigeration refrigeration,  process for drawing heat from substances to lower their temperature, often for purposes of preservation. Refrigeration in its modern, portable form also depends on insulating materials that are thin yet effective.  units (Question 11).

Discussion and Conclusions

Because of the nature of regulations in Oklahoma, people in charge
of food service establishments may not have received formal food safety
training, may not be certified, and may have limited or extensive
experience. Although the survey discussed in this paper was designed to
assess only basic food safety knowledge, it was apparent that overall
knowledge was generally good for those in charge of facilities. In
addition, the survey demonstrated the benefits of both training and
certification. Results also indicated that food service managers with
food safety training had more knowledge of food safety criteria than did
managers without formal training, and that food service managers with
FSO certification had greater knowledge of food safety, criteria than
did non-FSO-certified managers.

Health department training appeared to be most effective in
delivering food safety education. Food service managers with health
department training demonstrated a greater knowledge of food safety
criteria than did food service managers with corporate training. Food
service managers with health department training scored just slightly
below managers with both health department training and corporate
training, a result suggesting that additional corporate training was not
effective in increasing knowledge (or that the training was redundant).

A relationship was observed between years of food service
experience and knowledge of basic food safety, indicating that food
service managers with more years of experience tended to have a greater
knowledge of food safety criteria. The retention of knowledge was not
significantly affected by the number of months elapsed e·lapse

 n.  since training or
the number of hours of training received. The lack of improvement
associated with increased hours of training does not mean that training
was not helpful; it may rather indicate that the survey was too basic to
be sensitive to such improvements. Given that nearly 70 percent of
respondents had received some training within the past two years, in a
context of relatively long tenure among most managers surveyed, it
appears that training occurs with some regularity.

The survey question that dealt with recognizing hepatitis A
symptoms was frequently missed, with all groups demonstrating a poor
knowledge of this subject. Given the epidemic state of this disease in
Oklahoma, it is extremely important that food service managers have a
robust knowledge of this subject. Clearly, the training being provided
is not sufficient to adequately inform the intended audience.

Food service managers also had limited knowledge of optimal
temperature ranges for bacterial growth Bacterial growth

Recognizing the various possibilities for food service manager
qualifications, the authors designed the study to assess the basic food
safety knowledge of food service managers in charge at randomly selected
facilities. Since the survey was conducted as part of the routine
restaurant inspection process, some degree of random sampling was
accomplished. In addition, the response rate was high; therefore,

County. One potential source of error is that individual inspectors were
not required to identify themselves on the surveys they distributed to
their areas of jurisdiction; therefore, it is not possible to ascertain
the level of participation by facilities visited or by inspector. Given
the length of time over which the survey was distributed and the average
workload of inspectors, it may be inferred that some sanitarians did not
participate, possibly biasing the outcome toward more educationally oriented o·ri·ent

inspectors did not understand the principle of distribution to only
high- and medium-risk facilities. Finally, the analysis is limited by
the small number of respondents in some groups.

With the range of qualification of food service managers, it was
not surprising that a wide range of responses was received. The overall
knowledge of participants was high; however, a concern is the large
number of food service managers who indicated that they had received no
formal food safety training. With he growing importance of food safety,
it seems crucial that a minimum level of training, qualifications, or
competencies be achieved by those responsible for the operation of
retail food establishments. To determine the effects of any changes in
training and educational criteria, future surveys could be conducted in
Oklahoma County and compared against the survey data, or the results of
this study could be judged against those from a similar survey in a
jurisdiction with different educational or qualification requirements. TABLE 1
