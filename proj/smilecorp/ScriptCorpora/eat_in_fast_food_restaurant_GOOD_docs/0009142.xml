 Body I: Meat Packing plants today are unsanitary from the time they receive the cattle till they are processed. In recent years the USDA increased the number of inspections without warnings. Fast food restaurant are nothing like we imagine. So image the diseases that are carried by the time it gets to the schools. School Cafeteria meat has had traces of spinal cord, (which is how mad cow disease spreads), bone, and gristle in the meat. Conclusion: Knowing what I know now about the unsanitary of meat packing plants , school cafeterias , and behind the counters of the fast food restaurants, I thank about what I eat. They have shut down over 200,000 businesses this year alone. Like Eric Schlosser says, &quot;Beware of what you eat because there is shit in you meat. Fast food workers are usually underpaid teens who are inexperienced in meat preparation, and there, contaminated meat. Americans spend 10 billion on fast food last year.
