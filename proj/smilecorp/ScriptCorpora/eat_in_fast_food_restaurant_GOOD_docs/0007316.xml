Doomsday radio claims the world will [really] end on May 21, 2011
 By Bruce Tyson Mar 08, 11 | Updated Mar 09, 11   
Camper convoys spreading the word across the USA
 
Calendars across the nation have May 21, 2011 marked as &quot;busy&quot; now that camper convoys have traversed the United States warning Americans of impending doom culminating on that date. The group, Family Radio, is a network of religious radio and television stations that has calculated the date of the Apocalypse based on clues from the Bible to arrive at its startling conclusion.

Of course, Family Radio is not the first group to prophesy when the world world end, but it is the latest organization to make worldwide headlines with its claim.

 Details of &quot;The End&quot; 

A published by the UK Daily Mail  describes Family Radio, a group of people on a mission to warn people that the world end on May 21, 2011. According to the report, the religious group predicts a massive earthquake on that day will cause a global catastrophe and cause deaths on a Biblical scale.

According to the Mail, CNN spoke with the Family Radio group&apos;s founder, Harold Camping, who confirmed that the calculations upon which their doomsday predictions are based are spot on.

Technically, however catastrophic May 21, 2011 will be, that date is not the end of the world. That date rather represents a global catastrophe that culminates in the ascension of the Family Radio group into heaven to be with Jesus Christ. The official end of the world will be 153 days later on October 21, after epic chaos blisters the earth.

 A Biblical theme 

The story about the Family Radio group may sound vaguely reminiscent of interpretations of the Book of the Revelation found in the Bible, where a &quot;catching away&quot; of believers is followed by a period of &quot;great tribulation.&quot; However, most followers of Jesus Christ seem to be uncertain about the specific date of the occurrence of such events. Camping, on the other hand, seems quite certain, in spite of inaccuracies in the past.

 An earlier missed date 

According to the Daily Mail story, Camping previously predicted the end of the world as occurring on Sept. 4, 1994, a date he subsequently said was erroneously calculated because he was rushed to get his warning out. This time, he is sure that his calculations are correct.

 Apocalypse by the numbers 

The Family Radio Web site posts a lengthy dissertation on the calculations used to formulate the current doomsday prediction so readers can be convinced of the validity of their claims.

Apparently, the group bases its premise on the interpretation of seven days in the Biblical book of Genesis as days that last 1,000 years each, meaning that the history of the world will last 7,000 years. Calculating from the year 4990 BC (the year Camping says is the year of Noah&apos;s flood); the end of the world would have to occur in 2011.

The way the group arrived at May 21 as the exact date of the end appears more difficult to understand, but people who are interested can request a free booklet that presents additional details (those who fear the May 21 date probably should request their copy well in advance of that date).

 How to get to Heaven 

Unlike some evangelical groups who seem to know what a person must do to get to heaven, the Daily Mail piece suggests that the Family Radio group is not so sure. Apparently, the group believes that the people who are escaping earth to go to heaven are in a predetermined group, so according to them there may not be much recourse for those who want to join the group that is departing on May 21.

 Time will tell 

Although the Daily Mail seems to think that this group is wrong (again), only time will tell for sure. If anyone is still around on May 22, they can provide their feedback on the accuracy of this latest doomsday prediction.
