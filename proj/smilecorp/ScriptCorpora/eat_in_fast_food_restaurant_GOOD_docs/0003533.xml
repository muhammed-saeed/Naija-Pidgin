This was my favorite place in Athens when I was there for school. They aren&apos;t shy with the spice and put some serious love in their food. Great value at $7-10 to fill you up. I use my cornbread as a dessert and have tried and loved most of the sides. My favorite thing to get here is the jerk pork plate, small, rice&amp;peas, and spicy squash. The tea is super sweet but they have some unsweet to cut it with if it&apos;s too sweet for you. It took me 3 years to hear at this place when I was at UGA but once I did, it became a weekly dinner spot.

Small parking lot, but a good place to drop in and get out quickly. Dropped by on a Saturday afternoon with a steady traffic of people coming in.

A small order is plenty!!! I got jerk (fall off the bone) chicken, rice and beans, and sweet and spicy cabbage to-go with cornbread and sweet tea. This is as authentic as Jamaican food gets in the states! The sweet SWEET tea balances out the heat of the spicy food. I think their cornbread could double as a dessert cake, but yummy nonetheless. A very filling meal for under $10.

Kelly&apos;s Jamaican is absolutely wonderful. It is run by a Jamaican man and his family. They only have 3 or 4 meats and a handful of sides to choose from, but they are so delicious. AND, the prices are so good that it makes the experience even more enjoyable. Sweet tea is included in your meal.

I always get the jerk chicken and I&apos;ve gotten their cabbage side, zucchini side, and mac n cheese. I definitely recommend the sweet and spicy cabbage side. They&apos;re also known for having delicious sweet corn bread that comes with your meal.

Kelly&apos;s makes a certain amoung of food a day and when they run out, they&apos;re out. So hurry up and try this authentic Jamaican delight!

After many trips to Jamaica and loving the food, it&apos;s really nice to have to have an &quot;authentic as it gets&quot; Jamaican joint in town. If you do not like spicy food this place is not for you. You have been warned.

The jerk is slow burn goodness. That sneaky burn that halfway through the meal has sweat running down your face before you realize it. A spicy jerk lovers dream.

The sides are great combos of sweet and spicy. Everything is good. I highly recommend Kelly&apos;s.

Jeez. This is some EXTREME stuff. It was super spicy (which I absolutely loved) but it was also super sweet; I felt like I was licking frosting off a cake. You can tell it was also a little salty, but the salt was overwhelmed by the sugar and spice.

Everything has been pre-cooked already, so quick service was not a problem. The &quot;small&quot; portion filled up the to-go box. So, portion size wasn&apos;t a problem either.

But...I feel sick. I think this is a start of a love-hate relationship. The sweet tea might have been 3/4 sugar and 1/4 tea. But that stuff is addicting.

I did not discover Kelly&apos;s until my last year in Athens. Oh, how I regret this. I now live in Atlanta, and I cannot tell you how viscerally I miss this restaurant.

To start with, it is spicy. It&apos;s probably too spicy, in fact, for your average person. That being said, though, it is mindblowingly delicious. Here&apos;s how it works:

On your first visit, you walk in and are most likely a bit confused. It&apos;s already prepared, buffet-style  food,and you just tell &apos;em what you want. For $6 bucks, you get a meat (jerk chicken or pork--very spicy, or bbq chicken--not as spicy)  and two sides(all delicious, all fairly spicy. the choices are usually spicy cabbage, spicy mac&apos;n&apos;cheese, spicy squash, spicy spinach, rice&apos;n&apos;beans, and plantains). You also get a side of cornbread(which is great, and tastes more like yellow cake, actually, but it serves to sop up some of the spiciness in the entire meal) and also get a sweet tea(which is super sweet but somehow tastes better than any sweet tea you&apos;ve had in your entire life.

You sit down with your piping hot meal, and begin to eat. It is immediately delicious, and you think to yourself, or comment to your more Kelly&apos;s-experienced friends, &quot;oh this is spicy, but it&apos;s not THAT bad.&quot;

You keep eating. You are revelling in its deliciousness. Then you notice, just perceptibly,that the back of your neck is sweating. The skin beneath your eyes then starts to sweat. You&apos;re on fire. But you&apos;re also full. You have half a plate left, and feel embarrassed. Angry. Confused.

You get home and swear you&apos;ll never return to that place--it&apos;s too damn spicy and who wants it, anyway?

You live your life for a few more days. You eat your normal sub sandwiches, your fried chicken, your pizza.  Then slowly, day by day, it creeps up on you.

You have the fever. And the only thing that occupies your thoughts is &quot;i need to get more Kelly&apos;s.&quot; You indulge in your desire, and it&apos;s three times as as good as you remember it. More. You still sweat, and it&apos;s still hot as hell, but you savor every bite.

After this, you&apos;re hooked. You can never go back to your old life.

I&apos;ve been away from athens for 6 months now, and there are some days when I am very, very tempted (having found no replacement in Atlanta), to just hop in my car and drive the hour and a half and seek solace in the bright yellow and green building and eat what i&apos;ve been craving so long.

I ate at Kelly&apos;s about 4 hours ago, and my stomach is still rumbling unpleasantly.  I ordered the large grilled salmon plate with greens and macaroni and cheese.  The salmon was served with sauteed peppers and onions in an oily tomato-based sauce, but despite its obvious unhealthy qualities, it still tasted okay.  The greens were tender, but again I felt like they were swimming in a bit too much oil and I didn&apos;t enjoy them.  As for the macaroni, it was overcooked and soggy.  One of my friends loved the jerk chicken, though.

The best part about the experience was the super-super-sweet tea.  I definitely wouldn&apos;t be able to drink it every day, but it reminded me of the kind my mother used to make when I was a child, before she realized how terribly unhealthy it was.

Kelly&apos;s has finally found itself a nice location near 5 Points on Lumpkin Street. A variety of the island&apos;s trademark cuisine is featured including the popular jerk chicken and patties.

The jerk chicken is juicy and tender with a pleasant heat from the scotch bonnet. I did find that the other spices associated with jerk seasoning were less expressed but it&apos;s still pretty good. Jerk pork is okay but I&apos;d go w/ the chicken if it comes down to those 2 choices.

The beef patty is pretty good as well. The filling is generous and seasoned well. The pastry was a bit tough but it still retained a crispy texture.

With a $6 small entree, you get your choice of protein, 2 sides, cornbread and sweet tea. The cornbread tastes like a mix between vanilla cake mix and cornmeal batter (Jiffy?). It has that unmistakably, synthetic vanilla taste but the combination surprisingly works well. It&apos;s soft, sweeter than your usual cornbread and the sweetness helps balance out the heat. Has Sandra Lee caught onto this combination yet? She&apos;d be all over it.

You know how people are always bragging that they cook a meal that will make you go home and &apos;slap yo momma&apos;?? Kelly&apos;s really does cook that meal. Good Lord.. the food&amp;sweet tea is the best anywhere around. Staff is nice and food is already prepared so service is fast. Very laid back atmosphere, and they even have beers from Jamaica! I simply cannot get enough of this place.

I must say that Kelly&apos;s Jamaican foods is a very good restaurant.
I am a huge fan of spicy food, and I especially like spicy food that has rich flavor. You definitely get that here. And as some other reviewers have noted, it is the kind of heat that builds on you. And it is a pleasant burn. I had the jerk pork. They didn&apos;t have the jerk chicken ready when I went. I think that if they had had the chicken ready, perhaps I would have liked that a bit more because it seems that chicken might be able to take on the flavor of the jerk a little better. That said, the jerk pork was good, but not over the top good.
I am a big fan of the squash side.
The small size meal is plenty of food, and a very good deal.
As a previous reviewer said, the sweet tea is probably 75% sugar and 25% tea. I am not a big fan of iced tea in general, but it was pretty good, although I am sure it is a dentist&apos;s dream since it probably rots teeth of anyone who does not promptly brush their teeth after drinking it.
So don&apos;t get me wrong on the 4-star rating....I would go back here in a heartbeat, and if I could give this 4 and a half stars I would. I just don&apos;t think with my first visit it got to the five star level.

My digestive tract was destroyed after eating here. Maybe it&apos;s just Jamaican food, but their jerk pork is spicy beyond belief and all u can taste is the blandness and spiciness of the pork and nothing more. Also the pork seemed old and things were sold out and they doesnt seem to be making anymore.

I do not like spicy food, but I was still able to thoroughly enjoy this little Athens dive.  The curry chicken was delicious and tender, and the collard greens were the best in Athens.  The people move at a slow pace, but we could all take a lesson from that.  The important thing is that they are nice and helpful.  Prices are pretty reasonable although they are rising prices in Feb &apos;11.

Kelly&apos;s is a Jamaican meat and two veggies place. They have a variety of Jamaican food, jerk style or curried. Options include pork, chicken, goat, salmon, and ribs. Popular items may run out during the course of the day. The portions are generous. I usually get the jerk pork with spicy squash and spicy cabbage.

If you like good food and aren&apos;t afraid to try something different, you can&apos;t go wrong with Kelly&apos;s.

Kelly&apos;s is an awesome place for lunch or dinner.  The portions are big and the food is great.  I always go with the jerk pork or chicken, spicey cabbage, and rice.  The cornbread tastes like cake and is great for sopping up sauce.  The sweet tea is decent as well.  The ambiance is okay.  Kelly and Sandy are almost always around and are very friendly.  The only caveat is for those that don&apos;t like a little heat with their food.  If you don&apos;t like spice, then try the salmon, ribs, bbq chicken, or currey chicken.  Great place.

Anytime I&apos;m in Athens, Kelly&apos;s is on my agenda. They have the best jerk chicken I&apos;ve ever had if you can handle the heat I&apos;d suggest having it with the spicy cabbage and rice and peas. The sweet coenbread is the perfect complement to every meal there. I have tried other dishes there and they&apos;re good too, but it always comes back to the jerk.

My husband&amp;I are regulars i.e. at least 1X a week at Kelly&apos;s. For the price and quality, you&apos;re in for a treat. The best value is the vegetable dish which is a flat $6. The food is spicy which I love, but can understand if people can&apos;t tolerate. :) I would definitely say eating at Kelly&apos;s is healthier than eating at Subway. You&apos;re getting a delicious and homecooked meal for less than $8. I&apos;d say if you ate there, don&apos;t wimp out by ordering Mac n Cheese. It&apos;s a americanized Jamaican restaurant so definitely experiment with their selections. If you live in Athens, you should visit Kelly&apos;s. The end. :)

I just ate here for dinner and it was absolutely delicious. I got the jerk chicken, spicy squash, macaroni and it comes with cornbread. The spicy squash is so spicy it was ridiculous. He put everything on the same plate so all the juices were running together and I wish he hadn&apos;t done that b/c it made the macaroni spicy so it wasn&apos;t my cooling agent anymore. The guy working, who I&apos;m pretty sure was Kelly, brought out our cornbread after we were done, because it had still been in the oven when we ordered. It was the perfect ending to the meal. Everything had great flavor besides the spiciness of the squash. The spice didn&apos;t hit automatically so I was able to appreciate the flavors at the beginning. It was definitely homemade authentic Jamaican food though.

All of my friends know how OBSESSED I am with Kelly&apos;s.  This place has AMAZING food.  I walk in and Kelly gets started with my plate: jerk chicken, rice, and spicy cabbage.  The food is hot, fresh, and CHEAP: the small plate comes with one meat, two veggies, sweet tea and cornbread for SIX BUCKS.  Are you serious?  The cornbread is like cake, and the sweet tea is perfectly brewed (although I&apos;ll admit, I mix unsweet and sweet for my blend).  The ambiance is not fancy, but sit outside and chill out.  I eat there at least once a week!
