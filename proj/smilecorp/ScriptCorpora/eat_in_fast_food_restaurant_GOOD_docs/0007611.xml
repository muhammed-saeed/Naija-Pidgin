 An adventure kind of weekend 
 Author: tellis , 04 05th, 2012 
We recently had one of those weekends that actually made me thankful for the predictable and home body nature of a Monday. This particular weekend consisted of three days of adventures that left us all thankful for time spent together and out of the house, yet also thankful for our beds at night.

Friday- My mom had taken the day off of work to get her car worked on. Since her appointment was early in the morning, we decided that after her car was done, her and I would take the Princes to the Buffalo Zoo for the morning. This Zoo is more than an hours drive for us, so a lot of planning was going into where and when to eat lunch. This sounded like a great idea for an adventure, until I was asked to help out a friend. She is in the hospital and her husband asked me to help him out and watch three of their kids for the morning. We decided to change our plans slightly, taking on the extra kids in the morning and going to the zoo in the afternoon. The morning went well, meaning the kids had a good time. Our playroom looked like a tornado had hit it and even sent some toys spilling out into the kitchen and living room. After saying farewell to our friends and getting the diaper bag all stocked and ready, we hit the road. Unfortunately, we had not done enough research and arrived at the zoo 2 hours before closing time. This left us only 2 hours to visit a zoo we have never been to before. Thankfully, it was a bit chilly out, so the Princes kept moving at a nice pace. We got to see a bunch of the animals, including bears, zebras, lions, tigers and an alligator. I was most sad about not getting to see the giraffe up close and Prince Elijah was quite disappointed that the rhinos weren’t out. We did have a nice time, though. By this time it was almost 5:00 and we were a good 75 minutes from home. We decided to stop at the Galleria Mall to have dinner. We ate at the food court and I felt that dessert was in order since Prince Elijah actually ate all his dinner. We started walking around the mall to see our options for dessert, which ended up being either Mrs. Fields cookies or Dairy Queen ice cream. Elijah chose ice cream, which was fine by me. As we went in search of the Dairy Queen, we encountered many difficulties with Prince Jonah. We opted to leave the stroller in the car and found that to be a mistake.  Jonah gets extremely distracted when walking through a mall. He would be content just standing in front of a store window and looking inside and at his reflection. We ended up having to go between dragging him along by his hand or carrying him, as he flailed and whined. Eventually, we got our ice cream and then made our way back home, for the night. But this adventure filled weekend is far from over.

Saturday- Saturday was by far the easiest day of this particular weekend. My mom, Aeryk and I planned on taking the Princes to a local garden store, The Garden Factory, for a landscaping show. There were activities for the kids, so we figured it would be a fun little adventure. The Princes enjoyed crawling through the hollowed out tree trunks and the petting zoo. Prince Elijah was really entertained by the bunnies at the petting zoo. We walked around, gleaning ideas for our new castle, and talking to vendors. Eventually, Prince Jonah gave in to his exhaustion and fell asleep in the stroller. Prince Elijah was more energized than ever. While walking through an isle in the store, Prince Elijah found a large, flexible plastic bucket and put it over his head. He put his arms through the handles and proceeded to walk up and down the isle, pretending to be a robot. Aeryk thought it would be funny to put some large gardening gloves on the Prince’s hands. He then looked like a very silly 4 armed robot. He had all of us laughing, and every one who passed by. My Prince is a very imaginitive and silly little boy, and we appreciate that about him. We left shortly after having Prince Elijah put his robot parts away. We went home to relax, because Sunday would be another fun family adventure.

Sunday- I had obtained vouchers for free tickets to our local PBL Basketball teams final home game of the season. The game didnt start until 2:00, so we had plenty of time to eat lunch after church and head out. Thankfully, Prince Jonah fell asleep in the car, though it wasn’t his full 2 hour nap. It wasn’t that busy when we first arrived, so we were able to pick out good seats. The Princes loved watching the players practice. There was a lot for Prince Elijah to look at, and Prince Jonah just kept pointing and saying“ball”. The Princes began to lose patience and I had to take Jonah for a couple of walks around the concourse area. More of the seats began to fill up and finally the game began. I figured the Princes would enjoy it and just sit nicely, like obediant little men. Of course, they are not men, they are young boys. So they sat and acted like children. Prince Elijah jumped from lap to lap, sitting with his dad, then myself, then his nana, then in his seat. I’m not sure if he remained in one place for more than 5 minutes at a time. That is, until I bought french fries. Prince Jonah was really antsy and getting whiney because I had left his cup in the car. We decided to buy some over priced french fries for the Princes to munch on. They ate the whole box, and sat still while doing it. This only held Prince Jonah over for a short period of time. My mom took him down to the concourse area and began walking with him. About 5 minutes before the game ended, Prince Jonah gave in and fell asleep. Unfortunately, our home team, the Rochester Razorsharks did not win the game, though it was an exciting and close game. We went back home for dinner and to rest from a very busy weekend. I was probably one of the few people who woke up Monday morning and smiled, thinking to myself“I’m glad it’s Monday”.

My lesson learned this weekend was that my Princes may be small, but they have big personalities and my bes

 The Princes vs Kale 
 Author: tellis , 03 27th, 2012 
From looking at my handsome little Princes, you would not immediately guess that their father is of Italian and Sicilian heritage. If you look at my hubby, it’s more apparent. My dear little Princes both inherited my lovely porcelain colored skin, and my amazing ability to burn after only an hour in the sun. Not all the traits they received from their loving father are positive, though. Both Princes inherited Thalassemia (aka. Mediterranean Anemia). Along with this, my little Jonah also has iron-deficient Anemia. My instructions from the royal pediatrician were to try to get both boys to eat more iron rich foods. This is a feat easier said than done. Thus began the battle of the Princes versus Kale.

My hubby suggested for me to buy and cook kale for the Princes. For those who are unfamiliar with this vegetable, kale is a hearty, leafy green. It’s high in iron, but can taste kind of bitter. I looked up some different ways to prepare kale, because I was only familiar with bake it into”chips”. I found a recipe that involved roasting the kale with cheese on top. My first thought: My Princes love cheese. I tried this recipe, assuming the Princes would love it and I would be one of those moms who could get my children to eat veggies. I was wrong. They both tried one piece. Elijah immediately declared his distaste for it and Jonah might have actually eaten more if there wasn’t more appealing food on the table. Round 1 goes to the Princes. But I refused to give up, besides I still had a whole bunch of kale in the fridge. And for the record, I found this preparation of kale to be quite yummy.

 After some of my Facebook friends suggested making kale“chips”, and knowing that I like eating kale in that form, I decided I would make it for the Princes. Much like the first round, both Princes held their ground. Jonah eat a small piece, but much preferred the main course. Elijah took one bite and preceded to spit it out on a napkin because he couldn’t even swallow it. My mom and I, however, enjoyed the kale chips and finished them off. Round 2 goes to the Princes.

I further explored the Internet, searching for a“kid friendly kale recipe”. Much to my dismay, there really weren’t many. Finally, I came across a recipe for biscuits filled with cheese and spinach. I decided to replace the spinach with kale and hope for the best. They actually came out looking really cute and I found them to be tasty. I served them with dinner that evening, praying for kale to finally get the win. Not so much. Elijah, again, took one bite and decided he didn’t like it. Jonah never actually ate it, but instead forked the poor thing to pieces. Round 3 and the win goes to the Princes.

I had used up all the kale for the third preparation, and I did not buy any more when I went back to the grocery store. I did receive a suggestion for using spinach in yogurt and fruit smoothies, which I might try at an other time. Right now, I am going to focus on getting the Princes to eat red meat, since they actually like that.

 Princes in Springtime 
 Author: tellis , 03 22nd, 2012 
Sometimes our adventures happen without actually leaving our castle. Actually, most of our adventures happen very close to home. This is because we are a one car family, so when my hubby is at work, there are limited places I can go with my little princes. Today’s adventure happened right on our back deck. The weather has been unseasonably gorgeous lately. In case you are not familiar with Rochester’s weather, it’s not strange for us to still have a frost in the morning, or worse, accumulating snow this time of year. We have had ice storms well into April. Considering that, when I say“unseasonably gorgeous”I mean that the past couple of days we have experienced highs in the 70s. My little Princes have been begging to play outside, and I, being a  bigger fan of the spring and summer weather than the winter weather, am happy to oblige.

Today was one of those days that the Princes were getting restless inside while I finished up the usual chores. I decided to let them have some fun out on the back deck by filling up the water table and bringing out some cups and toys. Their water play started out innocently with them just pouring water from the cups back into the water table. After a while, the water play involved the boys pouring small cupfuls of water on their heads. These were mostly trickles, but probably helped to cool them off. After about 45 minutes of just sitting in the hot sun watching the boys play, I decided it was time for some fun. Elijah kept handing me cups of water that I was pretending to drink from. I started asking him if I could dump the water on his head. He always laughed, but said no. After a couple times, I emptied most of the water out of the cup and tossed the final drips at him. Little did I know this simple act would start a full blown water fight. Elijah began to dump cups of water on my lap, so I retaliated by dumping cups of water on his head. Jonah joined in, but was more of an obstacle than threat in the fight. Within minutes, our innocent game turned into Elijah running across the desk throwing cupfuls of water at me, then running away as I chased him with my own cupfuls of water. We were both quite drenched by the time I called a truce so I could start lunch. Where as this water fight was not my intention when setting up the water table, it did the trick of creating a fun adventure to pass the morning and kept us cool and laughing.

My lesson learned from this adventure is: Be spontaneous with your children. I have been working on this and still have a ways to go. I must mention that my spontaneity in this particular adventure was that I had not been dressed to participate in a water fight. I had just been planning on watching and taking pictures of the Princes playing. I am glad that I played with the Princes. It makes for good memories.

 Princes in the 19th Century 
 Author: tellis , 03 19th, 2012 This past weekend, we (my hubby, mom and I) decided to take the little princes on a family outing to Genesee Country Village and Museum. For those who are not familiar, the Genesee Country Village is a“ living, working 19th-century country village, complete with over 40 furnished buildings ranging from a pioneer homestead to a grand octagon house.  As you stroll, you’ll find costumed historic interpreters and up to a dozen different live demonstrations of everything from throwing pottery to blacksmithing “. They were having a maple sugar festival that I thought would be fun and interesting. 
This adventure began with a 35 minute car ride, during which we listened to Elijah’s choice of music–“The Fresh Beat Band”. We arrived in time to enjoy the pancake and sausage breakfast that was being offered. The food was wonderful, especially the real maple syrup. After the breakfast, we journeyed into the 19th century. Most of the buildings were only opened enough that you could look inside and get an idea of what it would have looked like. There were some buildings and houses you could walk through, and really get an inside view of what life was like. We spoke to some of the workers and learned quite a few neat historical tidbits. The kids did not seem to get as much out of the experience as the adults. They enjoyed playing the 19th century games and tasting the food. Elijah got tired of walking and kept insisting on riding on Aeryk’s shoulders. Jonah didn’t understand that the rope, that he was barely taller than, was a barrier and not merely an obstacle. After spending more than 4 hours walking around, Elijah was hungry and crabby, Jonah was falling asleep in my arms and the adults were complaining of aching knees, backs and feet. This was when we decided to throw in the towel and head home, even though we didn’t even see everything. After a quick trip to the gift shop for some yummy snacks and drinks, we headed to the car.

Of course, this adventure does not end here. By this time it was 1:30 and we hadn’t actually eaten a meal since breakfast. So we were in search of a gas station and a fast food restaurant with a drive-thru. The only problem with taking an adventure to a location in the middle of nowhere, there is no where to fill up the car or your belly. We had driven more than 20 minutes or the 35 minute journey before Aeryk found a gas station. By the time we found a Burger King, we were about 3 miles from home. By the time we finally arrived home, we all had full bellies and wonderful memories of the day. This would be categorized as a successful family outing because the tantrums were few, there were no injuries and we were all in pretty good moods upon arriving at our castle.

A word of advice to readers: The Genesee Country Museum is probably not geared towards children under the age of 5. It is a fun place to visit as adults and for older children. I wouldn’t suggest it if you have young children, like mine. It’s impossible to get them both to look at the same time. Jonah, just strolling along. Playing games with Daddy. 
 “More chocolate?” Elijah loved the authentic chocolate. Still can’t get both boys to look. 
 Elijah got a lolipop from the gift shop.
