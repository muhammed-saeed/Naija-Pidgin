 Cyndi Crocker Settled Car Wreck Case for $325,000 
In this case the at-fault driver lost control of his car in a curve and veered into the oncoming lane where he hit Cyndi’s client head on. The impact broke both of the client’s ankles, and she required surgery. Cyndi sent a thorough demand package that pointed out that her client was immobilized and had medical bills over $91,000 and lost wages of over $18,000. The claim was settled without litigation for $325,000.

 Ben Crocker Recovered $325,000 for Family 
One family was devastated when the driver of a state highway vehicle veered into oncoming traffic and struck their car. The wreck killed the mother and her young son and caused injury to her daughter. Ben recovered all insurance proceeds available and helped arrange a structured settlement for the daughter. The structured settlement will provide payments over time after the child turns 18 and increases the total amount of money to be paid. While no settlement can make up for the loss of a loved one, this settlement eased some of the family&apos;s financial worries and helped make sure their daughter could afford college.

 Cyndi Crocker settled Slip and Fall Case for $275,000 
Cyndi negotiated an out-of-court settlement of $275,000 for a woman who slipped as she entered the bathroom of a fast food restaurant. The floor in the hallway and bathroom was coated in a greasy film. The grease had apparently come from the kitchen and was thick enough to leave grease on the client’s clothes and in the cracks of her shoes. When emergency personnel arrived, they too had trouble with the slippery floor. Cyndi’s client had surgical injuries to her ankle and knee. She worked two jobs and missed time from both. Her medical bills were $38,004.55, and her lost wages were $15,839.99. Cyndi was able to resolve this case without litigation by presenting a complete demand package. This included opinion letters from the client&apos;s doctors and letters from co-workers describing what a hard worker the client had been and how the accident had changed her ability to do the job she loved (working with troubled youth).

 Ben Crocker Wins $225,000 in Insurance Dispute Over Fire Loss 
Ben took on this case after another lawyer had abandoned the matter. Ben’s client lost her home in a fire but her insurance company, Allstate, refused to pay for the house or its contents. Allstate made two arguments. First, they said Ben’s client started the fire. Second, they said that even if she did not start the fire, she failed to meet a technical requirement that she report any changes in the occupancy of the house. Ben&apos;s client won a trial verdict of $200,000. The total claim, including claims for insurance bad faith, was ultimately settled after appeal for $225,000.

 Cyndi Crocker Recovered $200,000 ($100,000 each) for Husband and Wife Injured in Car Wreck 
Cyndi represented a couple who was injured in a rear-end collision on the interstate. The husband suffered a surgical back injury. His wife also suffered neck and back injuries, including a ruptured disc which was treated with steroid injections and physical therapy. Each claim was settled for $100,000.

 Cyndi Crocker Settled Auto Accident Claim for $160,000 
Cyndi’s client’s car was struck first by a driver who pulled into her lane of travel, knocking her into the oncoming lane, and then by an oncoming car that was not at fault. She suffered multiple injuries including a broken foot, broken left leg and broken ribs. The foot injury required surgery and rehabilitation. The client’s medical expenses were $59,602.34. Cyndi negotiated a settlement of $160,000.

 Ben Crocker Wins $123,777.74 for Victim of House Fire 
When Ben’s client lost his house in a fire, his insurance company refused to pay him and sued him in Federal Court. The insurance company claimed that Ben’s client had caused the fire on purpose. Ben proved to the jury that his client did not cause the fire. His client was asleep in the house when the fire erupted and escaped out of a second story window. His client had no motive to burn his house. He lived on a family farm and had recently renovated the home. He had no financial problems and no plans to move. Ben used experts to show that the fire was not stirred up by fuel of any kind. There was no reason to believe that Ben’s client started the fire.

The insurance company also tried to avoid paying for the contents of the house, arguing that Ben’s client could not prove the value his of belongings and accusing him of falsifying invoices and credit card receipts. Again, Ben proved to the jury that his client was in the right. Ben’s client recovered everything he sought which allowed him to rebuild his home on the family farm.

 Ben Crocker Sued Rap Artists, Won $146,000 Verdict for College Student/Businessman 
Ben’s client was an industrious college student who started a business promoting local concerts. He arranged for multi-platinum recording artists, Trick Daddy and Trina, to come to Bowling Green, Kentucky for a performance. Ben’s client sold tickets to the show and made all the arrangements–spending thousands of dollars on the preparations. Trick Daddy and Trina signed a contract and received an advance, but when they arrived in town, they refused to perform. The jury awarded Ben&apos;s client $146,000. After the verdict, the matter was appealed and settled. The recovery allowed Ben’s client to finish college and continue in a successful career.

 Cyndi Crocker Settled Case for Boy Thrown from Hood of Car for $105,000 
The client was sitting on the hood of a friend’s car when the car started to roll forward. The friend meant to hit the brake but hit the gas, knocking Cyndi’s teenage client to the ground, where the car dragged him and rolled on top of him. He suffered road burns to his back and a dislocated hip and shoulder. The teenager had medical bills of just over $55,000. Cyndi first settled the claim against the driver for his insurance limits of $25,000, then pursued a claim under the boy’s parents&apos; policy (UIM coverage), which settled for another $80,000.

 Ben Crocker Settled Claim for Victim of Nursing Home Neglect 
Ben represented the family of an elderly woman who lived in a nursing home. She fell repeatedly over a period of several weeks. The last time she fell she suffered bleeding in her brain and died after undergoing surgery. Ben uncovered evidence that the nursing home failed to take appropriate steps to prevent falls and failed to follow established procedures to protect the patient. Ben settled the matter without litigation.

 Ben Crocker Wins $105,000 in Insurance Dispute Over Fire Loss

Cyndi’s client was driving a tractor on the highway when he was hit from behind. The defendant driver admitted that he had looked away from the road. The client suffered a compound fracture of the left elbow and required surgery. His medical bills were $24,320.45. He claimed $16,500 in lost wages. The claim was settled out of court.

 Cyndi Crocker Settled Back Injury Case for $80,000 
Cyndi’s client was injured in a car wreck caused by the other driver, who failed to yield the right-of-way. She suffered neck and back pain after the wreck and was diagnosed with a mild, broad-based disc protrusion. She exhausted her conservative treatment options (epidural blocks, trigger point injections, and chiropractic treatment) and eventually had surgery. Her medical bills totaled $31,574.42. Cyndi was able to resolve this claim for $80,000 without putting her client through a trial.

 Cyndi Crocker Settled Car Accident Claim with Rib Fractures for $52,500 
The defendant driver ran a red light and hit Cyndi’s client’s car. The impact caused injuries including eight rib fractures and a transverse process fracture. The client claimed medical bills of $20,324.29 and lost wages of $1,447.60. Cyndi negotiated an out-of-court settlement of $52,500.

 Cyndi Crocker Settled Case against Drunk Driver for $50,000 
Drunk driving is not only a crime for which a violator can go to jail; it is an act of negligence. In this case Cyndi represented the victim of a drunk driver who hit her head-on in her own lane of travel. Cyndi’s client suffered serious injuries, including a broken arm with nerve damage. The injuries required surgery. The client had $20,542.45 in medical expenses and $1,856.70 in lost wages. The drunk driver had only $50,000 in insurance, which was paid.


 Ben Crocker Settled Case Against Driver Who Blocked Road for $18,000 
Ben’s client suffered back strain after an accident in which he struck a sanitation truck that had stopped in the roadway at night.

The matter was then settled.
