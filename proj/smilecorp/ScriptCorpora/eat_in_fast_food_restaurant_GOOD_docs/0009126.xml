 NOVEMBER 2011 FILE PHOTOGRAPH/THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL Dana Chandler is accused of killing her ex-husband and his girlfriend in 2002. 
Special section

 Karen Harkness, 53, and Michael Sisco, 47, were found shot to death July 7, 2002, in Harkness&apos;s southwest Topeka apartment. Years were spent investigating the case, but it grew cold. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was consulted and &apos;48 Hours&apos; featured the case in 2009. Then, nearly a decade after the slayings, Dana Chandler -- Sisco&apos;s ex-wife -- was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, tracked to Oklahoma and arrested in the parking lot of a Duncan fast-food restaurant on July 25, 2011.

Fifty-four is the magic number in order to get a Shawnee County District Court jury to hear the trial of cold-case murder defendant Dana L. Chandler.

Monday started the process that will whittle down approximately 140 Shawnee Countians to the 12 jurors and six alternate jurors that will hear the evidence in the nearly 10-year-old case.

Chandler, 51, of Duncan, Okla., is charged with two counts of premeditated first-degree murder in the July 7, 2002, slayings of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, 47, and his fiancee Karen Harkness, 53, at Harkness&apos; duplex, 2231 S.W. Westport Square.

Monday was the first time Chandler has been in court in street clothes instead of Shawnee County Jail coveralls. Chandler wore a gray suit and white top.

Before prosecution and defense attorneys can make the cuts that will result in a jury and alternates, 54 people have to be passed for cause, meaning they are eligible to sit as jurors.

Mark Bennett, Chandler&apos;s defense attorney, gets peremptory challenges to eliminate 18 of the 54, and District Attorney Chad Taylor and deputy district attorney Jacqie Spradling have 18 peremptory challenges.

The two sides will pass the list of
prospective jurors back and forth, striking one person at a time until each side has exercised all their peremptory challenges.

That will leave 18 people—the jurors and the alternate jurors.

Each of the 18 people hearing the trial won&apos;t know whether he or she is a juror or an alternate until the jury receives the case to decide the verdict.

When court ended at 5 p.m. Monday, 39 people had been questioned in the selection process, and of those, 19 had been dismissed, and 20 hadn&apos;t been dismissed.

The remaining 38 people in the Monday panel will return on Tuesday, then 71 people in the second panel on Tuesday will be examined.

Soon after jury selection started Monday, six potential jurors were released during preliminary questioning by Chief Judge Nancy Parrish.

Those excused were:

■A man suffering from diabetes who has had trouble lately regulating his sugar level.

■Two people who have seriously ill relatives.

■A woman who is nursing her child.

■A man convicted of a felony within the last 10 years.

■A man who was called for jury duty in Shawnee County in December. A Shawnee County resident can&apos;t be called for jury duty more than once within 12 months.

After the preliminary questions, the remaining potential jurors were called one at a time into the judge&apos;s conference room to answer questions in private.

The individual questioning is being done to avoid the possibility of contaminating the entire jury pool with an answer and to encourage prospective jurors to openly answer questions that might be embarrassing if given in open court, said Cathy Leonhart, court administrator.

While waiting to be examined, potential jurors read books, including &quot;Black Jack &apos;56: The First Battle of the American Civil War,&quot; &quot;Help! I&apos;m the Parent of a Teenager&quot; and &quot;Steve Jobs.&quot; Others skimmed their smart phones, solved sudoku puzzles, did word searches and talked about anything but the Chandler case.

Seven months ago, Chandler was arrested in a parking lot in a small Oklahoma town on Shawnee County charges of murder.

Prosecutors contend Chandler&apos;s motive to kill Sisco and Harkness came when Sisco told his ex-wife just days before the slayings that he and Harkness were going to be married.

 I think that is supposed to be&quot;won&apos;t know&quot; 
 

&quot;Each of the 18 people hearing the trial won&apos;t [know] whether he or she is a juror or an alternate until they receive the case to decide the verdict.&quot;

Thank goodness I squeaked by that case by a couple of weeks...If I had to stay sequestered for 4 weeks, dd&apos;s dad and granddad would be very upset at having to &quot;waste&quot; the gass to take her to and from school...I wouldn&apos;t of heard the end of it even though I&apos;d be doing my part as a registered citizen...lesser of the two evils I guess :(

Can&apos;t you put in a different picture of this woman? You have printed this picture at least 5 times. I am tired of it.

 You aren&apos;t going to find any 
 

You aren&apos;t going to find any recent pictures of Dana Chandler that are remotely attractive. Years of heavy drinking and smoking have taken their toll.
