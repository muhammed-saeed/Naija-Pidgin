		FAPTURBO MENTORING CLASS
HOW TO JOIN INFORMATION&amp;SCHEDULE
 
 A message from the desk of your forum moderators: Calexander5 and Paul and FapturboMike. 

What’s been going on?

FAPTurbo have recently purchased BRAND NEW forum software, capable of hosting many more people,
 as well as having lots of exciting features such as voice chat and computer sharing, allowing us to create a better
 experience for FAPTurbo members. FAPTurbo has gone to considerable expense to ensure that they can support YOU
 in your FAPTurbo journey and is committed to doing so on an ongoing basis.

The much improved mentoring sessions will be available to you FREE OF CHARGE as always, as and when they occur.
 Look out for an announcement in the news section for dates of the next session.

Is that it?

 No, there is more. We found that many people would like a more detailed approach to mentoring,
 perhaps going over specific topics in detail. So we have teamed together and come up with a brilliant
 solution to provide this service. We will now be holding weekly indepth mentoring sessions. 

What will happen in the extra mentoring sessions?

Sessions will last 1 hour.

You will have an opportunity to submit your questions prior to the session, on a first come first served basis.

Your questions will be answered LIVE over voice chat by either Paul or Calexander5.
 FAPTurbo Mike (one of the developers) could be also attending.

We will present the ‘topic’ for the session in detail. We will give you tricks,
 hints and tips which have made our life so much easier and will ensure you gain a deeper
 understanding of FAPTurbo, how it works, and more importantly how you can make it work for you.

Topics will be presented using the new media available to us in the chat room, including remote computer
 viewing so you will be able to see us set up our charts live and run through and explain any confusing
 details to you.

Okay, now the ‘catch’...

To provide this extra service takes us a good deal of time and extra cost. We therefore are going to ask for
 a small fee to contribute to this. (don’t stop reading- i promise the fee isn’t going to scare you!).

“Ah, a fee.. i thought so!”

 Woaa, hold on! I know it sounds expensive- i mean, how much would you expect to pay to be able to attend
 a mentoring session? $50, $100, $200... more...? I recently attended a conference which was hosted by
 a company using the same advanced software that FAPTurbo are now using for their chats, what was the
 cost? $250 per month!!

No worries, both of us had a good chat with FAPTurbo to ensure we could bring the price down
 as much as possible and they agreed entirely! (bear with me i’m getting to the point now).
 We are going to be able to offer this service to you for less than the price of a meal at
 your local fast food restaurant. The price infact is a very low $13.97 per session.
 I challenge anyone to find such a mentoring session online at even triple this price!

So please, keep an eye out for the forthcoming update with more details on how to join and what topics we will
 be discussing (from basic setup help right through to more complex matters regarding settings and helping you
 with risk management). We very much look forward to the opportunity to speak directly with some of you and
 help you on a more indepth level in the future and i sincerely hope you decide to join us for at least
 one of the sessions.

If you have any ideas or contributions to make or a topic you would like to see discussed then please add it here: http://fapturbo.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=4905 This is being done to help you all so please tell us what you need!

What about our free support for life?

That is still a major commitment which FAPTurbo are honouring - remember the occasional mentoring sessions will be FREE as always, although vastly improved!

Whether you join us for the free or the $13.97 session - we look forward to seeing you there!
