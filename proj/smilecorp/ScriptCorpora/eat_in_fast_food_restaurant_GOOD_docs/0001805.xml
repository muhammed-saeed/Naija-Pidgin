Unusual burrito...they often grill the chicken too long so that it is dry--but tasty.  Great fries.  Kids love the hot dog and grilled cheese.  Huge menu.  Nice people.

I came here with the kids after gym class on Saturday since it&apos;s less than a mile from International Gymnastics. Located on the corner of Rand in the same area as Menard&apos;s and Aldi, right next to Business Center Drive.

Inside it&apos;s kept very clean despite the snow on the ground. They manage to do it without putting dirty cardboard on the floor like some places. Vintage Chicago photos hang on the wall above the order counter.

The smell of flame-grilled burgers hits you immediately. I got the 1/4-pound cheeseburger and the kids got grilled cheeses. We got only 1 order of fries. Their &quot;small&quot; is enough to feed 3 people. Good burger with all the toppings, no complaints.

Besides the usual fast food choices, they also have a Mexican menu of burritos and a few other items I was surprised to see. I think I&apos;ll have to run my steak burrito benchmark test on them in the coming weeks, so look for an update. I see us returning to this place every week given its proximity to the gym.

And finally, the kids got free small ice cream cones, which is apparently the standard practice. Unfortunately, Stunt Baby has no idea how to eat ice cream, so he just flicks the tip of his tongue at it. I got to finish it for him.

Wow. This place has an average of 3.5 stars? For what?

I had a cheesy beef. The cheese was shredded and topped on lukewarm slices of beef. Whaaat? Why aren&apos;t they using that gooey, awesome cheddar cheese? I felt like I was eating some kind of creepy taco!

The onion rings were alright. They were greasier than most I&apos;ve had, though.

I don&apos;t even remember what my girlfriend had. It was plenty forgettable. She enjoyed her root beer float, but come on -- how hard is it to screw up a root beer float?

I was hoping for much more out of this place.

This place is close to work and we wind up going once or twice a month.  Prices are reasonable, and the food is good.  Well, the gyros are good, I usually don&apos;t get anything else.  They grill the gyro meat after it&apos;s sliced, which makes it unique.  It&apos;s less greasy and has a good texture, but sometimes it gets a little charred.  The basket o&apos; fries with the combo meals is almost a meal unto itself, I usually split the fries with someone else.  The place is clean, there are old photographs of Chicago and Chicago sports teams on the walls.  Not a bad spot for lunch.

Combo menu is available, average combo is about $7 and some change.  Food pricing is moderate.  They&apos;ve got $1.99 deals going on for January since they are celebrating an anniversary.  They also have a daily deal of $1.99 / $2.99, for an array of most typical favorites, different items offered per day.  Mexican food is available as well.  I&apos;ve been here a few times in the last few weeks so I&apos;ve tried the $1.99 hamburger special and the amount of meat with toppings are enough to satisfy.  Combo that hamburger with a small drink and a small fries and you are definitely good.  A small order of fries consisted of a  full basket of French fries.  Also sampled the pizza puff, I thought it was fair, nothing special.
Hot sauce and salsa are complimentary; find them with the napkins and condiments.  I like that they have two televisions both aiming in opposite directions, usually displaying CNN news.  The staff is always pleasant and the order taker is attentive, for example if you were ordering single items and could save some money ordering a deal or combo, she&apos;ll mention it.
Oh yea.. 12 oz beers $1..  though I&apos;ve never been there for that enjoyment.

I would give this place 5 stars for it&apos;s food and prices.. however, I have stopped going here because one day (just happened to be the day that the illegal immigrant march was going on), they decided to close shop.. without turning off the sign or the lights, so there I sat (as well as everyone else) in the drive-thru for 10 minutes wasting my half-our lunch assuming they were open.. this as a consumer pisses me off.  you can&apos;t take the time to let your customers know your closed for business?  When things like this happen, I make it a point to never return again.

Frankie&apos;s would be average if it wasn&apos;t for their char grilled gyros, it makes the gyros more unique. They also have descent Italian beef and burgers. Daily specials and various Mexican fast foods are available.

I had to write this today because I have been on to Frankies for a while. Since this joint is close to work and has daily specials we would go there frequently. About 3 months ago my coworker got a hamburger. Took it back to the office it was raw inside. She called and took it back and they gave her money back. Then we went again about a month later. I insisted on a receipt because I didn&apos;t think they gave me the correct change and/or overcharged me. They informed me they couldn&apos;t provide me with a receipt because their machine was broken. My coworker was embarrassed I was making a big deal so we left. Today I go there for their $3.99 Gyros. I gave them a $20 and received $14.14 back in change. Wait a minute....You mean to tell me you are charging me 20% tax? I asked to speak to a manager. He comes to the window and proceeds to tell me he doesn&apos;t&apos; know what the tax rate is. Then the woman that took my order discusses it with him and gives me more change back. I look at her and say &quot; I am just trying to understand&quot;. No explanation was given. I think there&apos;s some shady 20% BS tax rate going on here.

I love Frankies.  I usually get the Italian Beef, the cheeseburger, or the burritos.  It is convenient and delicious.  The $1 beers on Saturday and car shows during the summer are just another reason for me to go there.  The owner is very kind and always greets me like I&apos;m a good friend.  Its a great meal, served fast.

I used to go to Frankie&apos;s several times a week mainly because it was the closest fast food place to where we work. The food is average. Sometimes the hamburger has a lighter fluid smell to it and is undercooked. No matter what size order of fries you ask for you get a big basketful. The main reason I have stopped going is because of the employees. When we would walk in they were always smirking and speaking in spanish. They liked to assume what we were going to order and start cooking it before we ordered. The final straw for me was how they always managed to give me two tomato slices from the end of the tomato with the holes in the middle. Once they gave me three end slices with holes in the middle! They always seemed to be smirking as we picked up our orders like they had just done something real funny. They can sit there in there empty restaurant and snicker their mexican asses off for all I care. I have taken my $30/week business elsewhere and so have my friends.

History
 
 Established in 2003 

The restaurant started as a slow place with little business. After having changed owner in 2003, the restaurant became lively and full of different customers. The owner worked hard to advertise and bring customers in. Now, the restaurant is full of new faces and old faces as well. Frankie&apos;s has many usual people who come and enjoy their food.

He now is the proud business owner and always has a smiling face. Customers enjoy talking to him and consider him like a normal friend.
