Dominic&apos;s Italian Restaurant Boynton Beach
 
Dominic’s has become one of my favorite Italian restaurants. A friend first introduced me to Dominic’s at their Hypoluxo Rd. location.“It looks like a pizza joint,”he said, as he was giving me driving directions. And he was correct. The waiter suggested the chicken rollatini daily special and I was happy to oblige. I skipped the salad and instead opted for the pasta fagioli. I often rate a restaurant on the taste of the pasta fagioli and Dominic’s rated high!

Since that introduction I discovered their Congress Avenue location in Boynton and have been a regular there ever since. Whenever I have a yearning for Italian food I think of this place. I have tried several of the entrees as well as the daily specials and have found them all to be terrific. And the pizza! The pizza is“to die for”and I think it is one of the best pies in this area. I ask for mine to be“thin and crispy”and it is always perfect. I took the picture on the right and I know it looks fake, but believe you me it is the real thing!

﻿On this particular visit Michelle and I started out with a bowl of our favorite soup, Pasta Fagioli. She ordered the Chicken Cacciatore, which she said was the best she ever had in her life! She had it served over penne. She ate about half and boxed the rest for lunch the next day. My lunch! Such large portions! I had three pieces of pizza and boxed up the rest for later.

﻿We are always greeted with a warm“hello”and although they are busy we have never had to wait very long for a seat. They even have a nice eating area outside with an overhang. The wait staff is quick, efficient and friendly. Justin keeps garlic rolls on the table, our glasses full, and checks on us regularly throughout the meal.

Next time you go to Dominic’s say hello to Anthony from the White Plate Special.

I love their pasta fagioli. Just the right blend of pasta, beans, herbs and spices. I always get some when I go there.

Ask for him when you go and tell him you saw it on www.WhitePlateSpecial.com.

I LOVE pizza and I order it all the time. Anthony makes one of the BEST Pizza’s in South Florida. There are probably thousands of pizza joints between WPB and Miami and I have probably only eaten at 10% of them. But for my 2 cents the pizza at Dominic’s is definitely in the top 10.

I especially like it“thin and crispy”and make that special request each time I order. You can’t believe how many places don’t know how to burn it a bit without ruining it. But they get it right everytime at Dominic’s!
 
pata fagioli
 
 5.0 star rating           
 
Michelle orders pasta fagioli at every Italian restaurant that we go to. So the other night, as we are picking a place for a late dinner, she says,“Let’s go to Dominic’s, I’m in the mood for a good bowl of pasta fagioli.”

Just the right combo of beans and pasta in a delicious broth. All the ingredients, herbs and spices meld together to form the perfect taste.

Great Food - Poor Service
 
This was our second time at Dominic’s. The first time, it had just opened and we felt they were going through start-up problems. This time was no better, so here’s our review.
The food is delicious, beautifully presented and piping hot. My wife had the sausage and broccoli rabe and an eggplant special, I had the pasta fagioli and gnocci special.

Our waitress was named Jackie and, although very friendly, was not very attentive. We had to ask for the bread basket and drink refills. When asked for a glass of ice for the iced tea, she said OK and then forgot. We had to ask a second time. These may sound like minor issues, but a quality restaurant stays on top of customers’needs. The bread basket should be automatic, when glasses are less than half full at least ask the customer if they’d like a refill. Don’t wait until the glasses are empty and the customers have to ask for a refill.

These are no longer start-up problems. This is not a fast food restaurant. Prices are on the high side but worthwhile for the quality of the food. Unfortunately, poor service trumps good food. There are plenty of restaurants serving high quality food WITH good service.

We won’t be returning anytime soon, if at all.

Gnocci with marina sauce

Delicious. The marinara sauce was not flooded all over the light and fluffy gnocci.
