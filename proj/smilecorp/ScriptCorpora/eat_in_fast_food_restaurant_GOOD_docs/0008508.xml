 April 29, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Junebug388 ( 27 reviews ) Noticed the negative post 3days ago and feel the need to reintterate Please refer to my previous review Most of the people the who object to the cost have positive reviews of inexpensive hamburger and pizza places Food here is non hormone fresh ground beef and individually prepared The sides are special and well executed If u want cicis or sonic go there I dont think they are trying to be that kinda place (i go those places too for inexpensive fast food) +1 more review from Junebug388 April 18, 2012 Mobile review This is a local well run eatery. First it is really clean and cute. Tonight i had the chili dog....the bun is toasted people. I have had the chili on a burger before and it is excellent. The meat is fresh ground and the onion rings are terrific For people who want an extra inexpensive burger mass produced go to sonic ...nothing wrong with that. But for the times u want to spend a little and have a really unique well prepared diner meal come here There is nothin wrong with the parking either Do remember it is cash only April 26, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by William P ( 44 reviews ) I had been anticipating going to Wily Burger for weeks, after being told how great it was. Well the time finally came to go, my wife and I went and took our grandson along for the ride. Upon arriving the first thing I noticed was a big &apos;cash only&apos; sign. Good thing I brought some cash with me. Well I walked through the front door and picked up a menu. No combos here, you pay for everything individually, that&apos;s right individually. Just a basic burger is almost 5 bucks, and then you add fries for another 2 bucks, we&apos;ll you get the idea that things can add up pretty fast. By the time it was all said and done I had forked out almost 20 smackers! As you can tell I find these prices steep. Well now on to the burger&apos;s themselves, was all this anticipation worth it? Hummm how do I put this..NO. I found the burger&apos;s very bland, no seasoning is used. They are griddled as opposed to grilled. I just don&apos;t get it why so few hamburger joints refuse to grill burgers? I mean if your going to cook... more» I had been anticipating going to Wily Burger for weeks, after being told how great it was.

Hummm how do I put this..NO. I found the burger&apos;s very bland, no seasoning is used. They are griddled as opposed to grilled. I just don&apos;t get it why so few hamburger joints refuse to grill burgers? I mean if your going to cook them on the griddle at least use seasoning. Shoot anyone can fry up a slab of meat, but it takes an artist to use the right amount of seasoning to enhance the flavor of the beef. Come on willy you can do better than this. The burger&apos;s were very greasy as well. No doubt a side effect of the burger sitting in its own fat. There are just so many better burger&apos;s out there. Hell I can cook a better burger myself without hardly any effort. I just don&apos;t like griddle burger&apos;s, they are number one above all things unhealthy for you. They are twice the calories of grilled burger&apos;s. Sorry but I wont be returning to willy burger. May 20, 2012 Mobile review by Tyler ( 9 reviews ) Greasy burger April 3, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Not bad, but not great either by MariB ( 91 reviews ) Willy Burger stands out on its side street and appears to be pretty clean on the inside. The service is nice, but it would be more efficient to have more than one cash register working during busy hours. Having heard great reviews about this place, I wanted to try a variety of their food items. I had a cheeseburger fixed up like I like it, an Uncle Charlie burger, onion rings, french fries and a funnel cake for dessert. It all smelled really nice in my bag, but I was disappointed when it came to taste. My cheeseburger and the Uncle Charlie was fine, but greasy for my taste. The onion rings were really greasy like they were either poorly drained or the oil was too cold during frying. I had one and it was enough. The fries are very, very skinny (think 1/2 the size of McDonald&apos;s fries) and were also very greasy. I did not finish those either. The funnel cake was good and probably one of my favorite part of my visit. In all, I was not impressed with my visit to Willy Burger. It was way too greasy. The Cash Only policy with the mediocre food makes another try too much of an inconvenience. April 29, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it EXPENSIVE!!! by katherine ( 8 reviews ) this food costs TOO much money. i think i tried just about the whole menu. my results: the hamburgers are mushy and greasy. the onion rings are good when hot. the malt taste like bland milk, the fries are NOT good at all. the funnel cake was great the first time i purchased - but they are now overfried - like eating potato chips August 9, 2011 Likes it Good Food with a Vintage Feel by Melanie L. ( 72 reviews ) We tried Willy Burger last weekend and it was FANTASTIC. Friendly atmosphere, enjoyable decor and most importantly, DELICIOUS food. I had the&quot;Uncle Charlie&quot;burger, which includes 2 onion rings (on the burger), bacon and barbecue sauce. I added pickles and cheese as well. VERY juicy, very flavorful! I also split an order of onion rings&amp;a HUGE funnel cake with my boyfriend, who had a grilled chicken sandwich, and they were all delicious! They even have shakes, malts and homemade ice cream cones... The owner likes to mingle with the customers to make sure they like their meals, and he makes entertaining announcements over the loudspeaker on occasion to thank everyone for eating at Willy Burger. Only complaints: Be sure to you have plenty of time when you go. There&apos;s only ONE cash register and they ONLY take cash. The wait can take a while since everything is made fresh, but it&apos;s worth the wait. We waited about 15-20 minutes, but I&apos;ve heard the wait can get up to 45 minutes. Since the ingredients are fresh, it&apos;s a little more expensive too. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful March 16, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Food_Group ( 4 reviews ) Awesome atmosphere&amp;great grub! Five Guys who? March 6, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Wendy Elaine Rodgers ( 14 reviews ) Great Burgers and Onion Rings with a great atmosphere! Funnel cake is a great finish! March 11, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Cash Only! by Barbara ( 1 review ) Will not be back. Parking sucks. Looked at menu and in my opinion is pricey for a burger. They start at 4.99 without fries and it goes up from there. I ordered and presented the girl my debit/credit card and she said&quot;We are cash only&quot;. I said I&apos;m sorry to hear that and I said nevermind. The girl did not appologize or say I&apos;m sorry as I walked out. This is not customer friendly more like something you would expect at a fair or flea market. February 13, 2012 Grilled tuna burger,rare, w/Asian slaw and wasabi mayo by elizpresjacob ( 1 review ) Grilled tuna burger,rare, w/Asian slaw and wasabi mayo -
Though the tuna steak is cooked rare (which I&apos;m not used to), it&apos;s firm, juicy, and good tasting. This heavy slab of protien tends to smush the light textured bun, though. Also, the slaw adds moisture that makes the bun soggy. My bun disintigrated about half-way through the meal, so I just pealed it off and finished the fish. I think you need a sturdier bun and to serve the slaw on the side. February 3, 2012 OVERRATED! by LeTony W. Hadnot Jr. ( 1 review ) Wasn&apos;t bad, just wasn&apos;t all what people were cracking it up to be. The burgers weren&apos;t just outstanding, the fries weren&apos;t all that great, and the milkshakes tasted like a milkshake from a fast food restaurant, just wasn&apos;t very authentic. I&apos;d go back if I was in the area for lunch, but it&apos;s nothing that I would ever have a hankering for.
