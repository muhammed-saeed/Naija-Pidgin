 Why Online Grocery Ordering Clicks with Consumers 
 By: Brittany Jul 11 
Once upon a time, you had time.  And grocery shopping was grand. Strolling down the produce aisle, frolicking in the bakery, and pulling your lucky number at the deli counter. Ah, life in the slow lane. Remember those days? Yeah, me neither.

 Truth is your grocery shopping strategy is–and will always be – get your food, and get out. That’s why it’s no surprise that grocery chains like Whole Foods , Publix , and Lowes Foods are jumping on the online ordering bandwagon for deli, bakery and prepared foods. They know their customers are on-the-go and that convenience is key to keep ‘em coming back for more.

After all, grocers are part of the service industry too.  And when it comes to serving food, folks want it fast and easy. That’s why online ordering rocks the restaurant industry and why it’s expected to do the same for supermarkets.
 
According to Nielsen , the U.S. grocery market is a $538 billion industry, and by 2014 the online grocery segment will hit $25 billion. That means it’s ripe for tech integration. And there’s no better time than now for food shops to plug into the future.

So the next time you’re standing around waiting for a deli tray, think of all the things you could be doing if you would’ve ordered your grocery goods online and picked ‘em up in the drive-thru . Ah, to live life in the fast lane.

 Does your local grocery store sell their goods online? If so, do you use it? Why or why not? Share with us here. 

 Have some friends in the supermarket biz that need a little tech persuasion? Feel free to send them our way!

 ONOSYS Supper Club–Happy Dog 
 By: KimSullivan Jul 03 
 The fourth installment of Supper Club brought the ONOSYS crew to Happy Dog – a Cleveland landmark located on the West Side of the city.  Happy Dog is known for their great live music, the array of old school video games, casual neighborhood atmosphere and fantastic beer list. But our main (and most important!) mission was to sample the famous build-your-own Hot Dogs.  Celebrity chefs from the area have all created their own favorite famous dog, and being a group that“lives hungry,”we opted to follow in suit.  Each of us (including our dedicated paleo peeps) built a unique Hot Dog from the 50 toppings to choose from – and delicious masterpieces were created before our very eyes!

The build-your-own list consists of many options to add to your dog.  They range from house made ketchup, to Pimento Mac-n-Cheese,  to Bacon – Balsamic Marmalade, a Fried Egg or Ginger Sesame Coleslaw.   We all congregated in the Underdog (lower level of the restaurant) and tackled the list.  Multiple scrunched up papers in the middle of our table proved that the decision is not an easy one to make.   I went through four rounds before creating what I thought was the perfect dog, and of course added the side of tater tots to round out the meal. 

 Happy Dog lives up to the hype!  All of our hot dog creations were delicious and unique.  My Hot Dog creation of Blue Cheese Coleslaw, Caramelized Onions, Kansas City BBQ Sauce and Bacon Balsamic Marmalade hit the spot.  Other unique creations included Peanut butter, hot sauce and Alien pickle relish, as well as Dill Pickle Spears, Applewood smoked bacon, and Habanero pickled onions.  Though all of dogs should require a fork and knife to be consumed, we happily dominated the Happy Dog experience with messy hands and full bellies!

 To app, or not to app: That is the question 
 By: Brittany Jun 11 
 With mobile technology growing faster than you can figure out the features on your smartphone, many restaurateurs are asking whether they should build a mobile app or a mobile website.

And while the jury is still out on the winning widget, a recent SmartBlog on Restaurants article says don’t waste your time on the app. Building a mobile website is easier, more efficient and much less expensive. Here’s why:

 Easy: You already have a website, so it’s easier to optimize it for mobile devices than to build two different apps for iPhones and Androids. A developer can easily pull all the important info that’s already there, tweak it with some fancy code and get your site functioning on a mobile device in no time. With an app, it’s the opposite. It takes tons of time to write programs, install menus and features and don’t forget, you’ll need two. 

 Smart: Only 40% of your audience has an iPhone or Android so creating an app is inefficient. It completely neglects the folks with other phones. With a mobile website, everyone who has a smartphone, or a basic phone with browsing capabilities, can visit your website easily and conveniently. 

 Inexpensive: Last but not least, apps cost a pretty penny. At an average of $3,000 per application set-up – and again, don’t forget you’ll need two–there’s also fees ($140 average) for maintenance and updates. With a mobile optimized site, it’s much cheaper. You can have one built for $150 and pay about $50 a month for upkeep. 

Still need convincing that mobile web is the way to go? Check out this Nielsen research that says smartphone users prefer it. And then share some of your ‘appy thoughts.
 Stay tuned for Part 2 of“To app, or not to app”as we present the other side of the mobile app debate.

 ONOSYS Supper Club–Sokolowski’s University Inn 
 By: DustinSullivan Jun 01 
Last Friday night, the ONOSYS supper club hit up Cleveland’s most edible Polish landmark, Sokolowski’s University Inn. Located at the north edge of Tremont, this establishment has been family owned and operated since 1923. You can tell just by looking at the walls covered with autographed photos of famous people who have eaten there; it’s a must-visit for Cleveland guests.

This cafeteria style eatery begins with the most important element of most meals: dessert. Picking up a slice of blueberry pie for my tray, I could tell this was going to be an excellent meal. Sliding on down the line, I grabbed an old-fashioned bottled root beer. Also available were bottles of grape and cream soda. Some of the slightly less classy club members availed themselves of the fountain soda.

Main dish offerings included Salisbury steak, honey-glazed meatloaf, pork chops, ribs, fried fish and more. The huge slab of meat sizzling in sweet-smelling juices won me over for the meatloaf option. It turned out to be pretty spicy, but it was very moist and flavorful.

 

After choosing your main dish, you get to pick two sides. If you didn’t get pierogis as your main dish, you have to get them as a side. Otherwise, you would be missing out on the climax of the Sokolowski’s experience. In case you’ve never heard of them, pierogis are Polish dumplings of unleavened dough filled with potato and usually fried with butter. Sokolowski’s pierogis have been highlighted by Iron Chef Michael Symon on Food Network’s The Best Thing I Ever Ate . Rather than being simply fried with butter, these pierogis have been swimming in butter for the better part of their existence. As long as you don’t think about the health effects, they are one of the most enjoyable experiences your mouth can have.

 

After dinner we gathered around the bar, where co-founder Stan shared a drink with Sokolowski’s co-owner Mary Balbier and the bartender shared some new concoctions with the club.

 

I can say quite certainly that we all rolled out of Sokolowski’s a happier (and slightly heavier) people.

 Spice-up your sleepy restaurant marketing with new ingredients 
 By: Brittany May 18 
Like preparing an old-fashioned cocktail, serving-up an enticing restaurant marketing program takes the right tools and correct ingredients. And new research by the National Restaurant Association and LivingSocial says the recipe for success isn’t just a pinch of this and a dash of that. It’s a calculated mix of marketing elements – including traditional channels, online outreach, and personalization – that will keep customers hungry for more.

Presented at the 2012 NRA Show, useful bits and pieces of the research include the following:

 Earn a spot at the cool kid’s table with online marketing: Restaurants that use online marketing (emails from restaurants, emails from a daily deal provider, and websites) tend to be viewed by consumers as modern and popular – and effective in bringing in newbies. 

 Say my name and save me a seat. Customized marketing messages that address a consumer’s preferences result in more sales. 68% would go to or order from a restaurant if they received customized messages that referenced past patronage, allowed them to make reservations (66%), and identified them by name (64%). 

 Ready, set, SEND! Operators understand what marketing tools work; they just need to implement them. 84% consider restaurant-specific marketing emails to be effective in increasing revenue, and 63% say they plan to send such emails in the next year. 

 Keep a safe cyber-distance. Consumers are very sensitive to social media and Internet ads.  They perceive the least effective efforts to entice them to go to a restaurant include social media (56%), online ads (58%), and radio ads (56%). 

So with all the marketing options on your plate, what channels have you found to be most effective at increasing customers and revenue at your restaurant? What new ingredients have you added to the mix?  Share your secret recipe!

 ONOSYS Supper Club–Empress Taytu and Hodge’s Cleveland 
 By: Brittany May 01 
 MARCH SUPPER CLUB 

For the March installment of the ONOSYS Supper Club we stretched our culinary horizons and visited Ethiopian restaurant Empress Taytu.

Upon arrival we opted for a traditional setting, seated in a circle (for communal sharing) with a grass basket table under a straw roof hut. Then came a round of tej–Ethiopian honey wine and an order of lentil sambusa to start. For entrees we shared a vegetarian combination plate which included red and yellow lentil dishes, greens and spicy cabbage, as well as several meat dishes, including beef tips (cubes of beef marinated in an Ethiopian blend of spices).

Without a knife and fork in sight (yes, you eat with your hands!), each person gets their own basket of fresh injera (a traditional spongy pancake bread) to tear away, and“pinch”the different meat and veggies.

With large portions, bold flavors, and an authentic Ethiopian ambiance, Empress Taytu is a unique Cleveland dining experience definitely worth trying a time or two.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 APRIL SUPPER CLUB 

This month we decided to try something new and trendy and without a second thought– Hodge’s it was! The highly anticipated downtown eatery, owned by the same folks that operate the popular Hodge Podge/Dim and Dem Sum food trucks, totally lives up to the hype.

So you know you’re in for a treat when your drinks (more on that later) are served with complimentary cornbread. But that was just the beginning. For apps, our group shared the chicken liver toast, house-made pickled vegetables, gnudi (crispy artichoke with brown butter, parm, and parsley) and swedish meatballs (NOT the IKEA kind). Talk about tasty!

For entrees, a few went with the burger, one with the Hodge’s honey ribs, and another with the ribeye steak. Each meal was quickly devoured and the unanimous vote was that the food was delish!

The vibe and the service were great and the bar manager even stopped by to chat about our order of“Mohurtos.”In case you were wondering, this is the signature drink of ONOSYS project manager, Dave Hurt. A twist on the mojito, the“moHURTo”is a mix of tequila, mint, club soda, a little lime juice and simple syrup.  Sounds manly, right? (He paid me to include this blurb)

Okay, back to Hodge’s. Great spot, great food. Take a date and take your friends. You won’t regret it!

 My way or the highway: Why customers want customization 
 By: Brittany Apr 26 
Remember the old “ Have it your way ” advertising campaign from Burger King? I bet a large fry you do. The catchy jingle invited you to order a Whopper any which way you pleased. No mayo? Extra pickle? Your wish was their command.

 Sure the big wigs at BK wanted to please your picky taste-buds. But more importantly than that, they were pioneers in the hot product strategy known as customization.

In a recent article from SmartBlog Food&amp;Beverage, the author shares how customization can increase customer retention and average order value. It impacts how customers perceive their relationship with both a brand and its products. But it’s not a feature; like product quality or ease of use – customization is a FUNdamental dimension of the customer experience (see what I did there).

Think about it. We all have an innate desire to be creative, engaged and in control. Customization fulfills that. And when we’re engaged and in control during the buying process, we’re a satisfied customer. And when we’re satisfied, we’re likely to buy again and again.

A solid online ordering system is the crème de la crème of food customization.  It lets customers live out their inner control freak. Whether it’s building a salad, sandwich or pizza, the options and modifiers let them have it their way (even if their way is a combo of pineapple, spinach, and anchovy). And once they’ve created their perfect product, they can name it and save it for repeat consumption.

So how do you engage your customers with customization? Let us help you add value to your online ordering system with visual and gratifying customization.  Between our own customers’ dishes and a custom orange shoe obsession , I’d say we’re old pros at it. Besides, your ever so choosy customers will thank you for it.

 Power to the People: The New Restaurant Critic is YOU 
 By: Brittany Apr 11 
As consumers, we’re quite the big-mouths. If we have a great experience in a restaurant, we’re likely to tell somebody. If it’s poor – be it the service or food – we’re likely to tell five people, and then share it with the entire world wide web.

 User reviews on social sites like Yelp and Foursquare have become trusted sources on which restaurants soar and sink (literally and/or figuratively). We care what other people think and we don’t hold back on adding our two-cents to the mix.
 
This new infographic from Keepingitkleen.Com shows us that foodie blogs and the ever increasing amount of social sites make us the new food critics. These statistics show, people trust what we’re dishin’ out:

 90% of consumers trust peer reviews and 70% trust online reviews 

 89% of consumers use the internet to check out menus and researched a restaurant before dining there 

 Yelpers have posted over 25mil local reviews and average 5.7 mil monthly visitors 

So if a diner has dirty dishes, dingy bathrooms, and a disrespectful wait staff, there’s a good chance the voice of the people will shut them down before the health inspectors do.  You may not be putting the health grade in the window, but if you say a place is a pass or fail, you the diner, define the restaurant’s clout.

How often do you check restaurant reviews before choosing a new restaurant? How much sway does it have over where you dine? And operators, how do you handle folks that talk cyber-smack about your spot? Give us a piece of your ever-so-influential mind.

 Cool Tech: Google Car Fetches Food 
 By: Brittany Apr 04 
Most folks would say they frequent fast food spots because it’s quick, convenient, and with a drive-through, you don’t even have to get out of the car.

Now what if you could kick that convenience up a notch. What if you could sit-back, relax, and let the car fetch the food for you. Those smarty pants at Google are on the fast-track to making it happen.

A few years ago, Google developed cars that could drive themselves. Now, the New York Times reported that with their latest innovation, Google is teaching cars to navigate programmed routes, such as fast food restaurant drive-throughs.

In a post on Google Plus the company says that robotic cars have “now safely completed more than 200,000 miles of computer-led driving.” Google added that it wanted to demonstrate that a driverless car navigating new obstacles, like a drive-through, offered “a promising look at what this kind of technology may one day deliver for society if rigorous technical and safety standards can be met.”

In the YouTube video below, you can check-out the self-driving car in action, allowing Steve Mahan (a gentleman that has lost 95% of his vision) to safely and independently run errands like picking up dry-cleaning and fast-food. With the car, he’s experiencing being behind the wheel in a whole new way.

While Google has a lot of lobbying to do before it can set a battalion of robotic cars loose on city street, it’s pretty neat look at the future of autonomous technology and how it can benefit the folks that may need it most.
