MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) - Fire inspectors and workers are combing Morgantown, removing furniture and trash from the porches of hundreds of rental homes. Fire Capt. Ken Tennant says the cleanup has been under way since 9 a.m. Thursday.

Many truckloads are being hauled away as the city tries to prevent big street fires after Saturday night&apos;s football game between No. 16 West Virginia and No. 2 LSU.

Earlier this week, officials posted hundreds of notices in areas dominated by student housing, ordering people to remove flammable material.

Tennant says most people are complying. Some even put their furniture and trash along the street so city trucks could pick it up.

The few who refused have been cited and could face fines of $100-$1,000.

Morgantown has struggled for years to end street fire celebrations.
