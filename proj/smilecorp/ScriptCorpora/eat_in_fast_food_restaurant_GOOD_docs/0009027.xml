Bakeries in Calgary?
 
Hello! I am from Montreal and am spending the summer in Calgary. I&apos;m having trouble finding decent bread here. Does anyone have any tips? I like all kinds of bread from baguette to a good multigrain.

A new Italian Country Bakery opened on Meridian Road S.E. next to Jugo Juice Corporate Headquarters in the same complex as Mr. Cappuccino. They sell bread by weight and I find the bread to be fantastic, typically European style, Hard crust and lasts for a few days. They are no relation to either companies mentioned above.

There are excellent bakeries here. Any particular part of town?

Incidentally if you like any stripe of Asian food, I guarantee it&apos;s better, for some variants much better, in Calgary than Montreal.

 re: John Manzo 
thanks to everyone for the suggestions so far!

I&apos;m willing to travel for good bread, but anywhere around Kensington, downtown, West Hillhurst, Capitol Hill, Marda Loop would be great.

I just tried Chinatown for the first time the other day and had a decent meal. I&apos;ve read the posts on good restaurants and dimsum. Any recommendations for Chinese bakeries?

 re: matter 
Since the inner city is your focus, you have to check out:

Rustic Sourdough on 17th Ave and 12 St SW, excellent German bakery- amazing Brötchen but get there early before their pretzel rolls run out!

Manuel Latruwe on 1st St SE near 11th Ave, by Castle Callebaut

Euro Bakery on 17th Ave SW near 5 St- the best thing there IMHO is their Kosovar bureks but they have nice breads too

Rise Bakery (a couple of downtown locations, sadly not open weekends) has small pricey loaves that seem to be made to fit into a briefcase :) but I&apos;ve had some epic breads from there

We got some ciabatta buns from the Market Bakery at CFM last weekend that just blew us away. Also Lina&apos;s Italian Market is a local treasure that has some very good breads.

There&apos;s a start- there are lots of posts/threads about Chinese in Calgary incl dim sum, have a search around, and enjoy your summer!

 re: matter 
Eclair De Lune 1049 40 Ave NW is a great french bakery, and a little cheaper than others in town. Their croissants were comparible to what I had in Paris last year. They also make wonderfuly flakey turnovers with a mushroom or spinach stuffing. And the mini-fruit flans are a nice small light dessert I serve to my dinner guests regulary @ about $2 each.

 re: matter 
Missed your ask for Chinese bakeries. Here are my family&apos;s favourites:

St Laurent Cake House in the City Centre Mall (the one with Thai Tai on the corner) has great raisin twists and Swiss rolls.

Jing Jing Bakery, in the basement of the building with Happy Valley Restaurant (kiddie corner from City Centre Mall) has yummy pineapple buns and cocktail buns.

ABC Bakery has okay bakery items, but the real attraction there is the cheap HK-style breakfast.

And don&apos;t forget Bliss Cupcakes as suggested by ybnormal below. Excellent cake, delicious pies. Not a Chinese bakery, but definitely not to be missed.

Outside of Chinatown, I love the coconut and the red-bean bread loaves at T&amp;T.;

Eclair De Lune does great pastries...but not breads. Almadine on Centre St and about 25 Ave north does pretty good bread...but a trip out to Glamorgan Bakery (33 Ave and 37 St SW) is worth it.

Rise Bakery does great breads, but on the pricey side. They are located Downtown in Bow Valley Square, and only open during office hours Monday - Friday.

ETA: Whoops, I see John has already mentioned Rise. Well, consider this a second endorsement!

Shout out to Urban Baker in Bridgeland

 http://www.urban-baker.ca/ 

The Chocolate Cranberry Sourdough, Pesto Cheese, and Pear Pepper breads are truly terrific. Make french toast out of the Chocolate Sourdough. The baguette and foccacia aren&apos;t slouches there either.

If you are in Chinatown, search this board for Bliss Cupcakes. You won&apos;t regret it!

In the NW around Varsity is a good little European Bakery called Watermill Bakery. Their breads are quite good. I just got a really good challah/egg bread there.

 re: ybnormal 
I&apos;ve actually been by the Watermill Bakery a couple weeks ago and I wasn&apos;t all that impressed by their breads. I bought a challah bread, a couple of croissants and their ciabatta. Their croissants....well I wouldn&apos;t even call them croissants. They were more like bread roll, very chewy and dense, no flakiness what so ever. And their ciabatta seemed like the same kind of dough was used except cut in a rectangular form.
The challah bread on the other hand had a decent flavour to it, but it was still really chewy to me.
I&apos;m not sure if it was just that day I went or not, and I&apos;m not sure if their other breads are like this (I hope not)
Does anyone else have some experience with this bakery?

 re: whackamole 
Their croissants aren&apos;t croissants - they are more like danishes. When I had the challah, I don&apos;t believe it was chewy. I haven&apos;t been there in a little while though. It is not like Manuel Latruwe or Ladybug.

Haven&apos;t tried their ciabatta - its not my favourite bread, but I&apos;ll have to try some of their other breads and see what is going on.

Gunther&apos;s in forest lawn: 4306 - 17th Avenue S.E. - It&apos;s a bit out of the way, but well worth the trip.

The Kaisersemmeln (kaiser buns) are the best in the city and the selection of heavy, dark breads is outstanding. Also worth mentioning are the Mohn-Kipferl (poppy seed filled, crescent shaped pastry).

I discovered a real little gem up on Centre Street, a few blocks north of Linas in Simons Valley Plaza..

Orchid Pastries is an Iranian run patisserie, they have imported Persian foods including incredible pistachios&amp;a really nice selection of intricate pastries all made in the sparkling new bakery out the back.

Well worth a visit!!!

Really looking forward to these recommendations - as a former Montrealer myself, I found the same problem here - a lack of good bread. Yann Haute Patisseries is fantastic for a very specific loaf, croissants and macarons, but I&apos;ve been craving a good variety of breads!

What, no love for Glamorgan Bakery in here yet? 37th Street and 33rd Ave SW in the strip mall.

The cheese buns are outrageously good. But great breads all around.

Living in Evergreen means one is not too close to any of the bakeries mentioed, so you are forced to look for the best that the big stores can offer. I can highly recommend a few loaves at Superstore. The make quite a few styles, including several baguuttes, their&quot;Parisienne&quot;being the best of the bunch, and excellent sourbread boule-which is improved by tossing it in a hot oven for a few minutes, and if you want a very good burger bun, try the foccacia buns. All their breads have good chewyness factor.

Question: Who carries a good light rye with a hard thin crust?

 re: Scary Bill 
Rustic Sourdough has good rye but the crust is pretty thick. Probably not what you want.

I like the European Light Rye at Safeway. The crust is a bit soft and chewy, though, so that might not be what you want either.

The Urban Baker has a nice rye bread with a thin hard crust. I don&apos;t recall it being&quot;light&quot;though.

Also, The Bakery at CFM by the food court is getting better and better. I had an awesome Hazelnut Chocolate Tart there the other weekend.

Yann on 23rd avenue (or thereabouts) has baguette? I thought they only made a sourdough type bread, and everything else was sweet pastries.

 re: 23skidoo 
The term baguette describes the shape of the dough. Long and thin with a hard crust. Yann does make it from a sourdough base as is the very traditional method in France. The same dough (at least I think it is the same as it has the same taste) is made in a square.

I&apos;ve bought a couple of items there and found them to be expensive and not great, rather acceptable, therefore not really good value.

Also thei motto for thier buns&quot;bigger, fresher, softer&quot;What about a nich crispy crust? I can buy soft buns from and grocery store for a lot less.

I guess I just don&apos;t get Cobs.

 re: Scary Bill 
Sadly I have to agree, there&apos;s a lot of hype for Cobs and I just can&apos;t get it. I&apos;ve tried them a few times and have never been impressed. But different tastes for different people.

I wish that some bakery would focus on&quot;correcting&quot;the water they all use. Our water here is quite hard and it just doesn&apos;t work well with most breads. Before anyone jumps down my throat, there have been blind taste tests done with NY vs LA vs Chicago water and it&apos;s the water that makes those pizzas more distinct.

That being said, Gourmet Croissant in Canmore manages to make incredible croissants but they sell out so fast it&apos;s frustrating when you are driving from Calgary and they are out :(

 re: 23skidoo 
I don&apos;t think water hardness has much to do with bread flavour - if anything.

Paris has hard water, yet is recognised as oneof the bread making capitals of the world.

Vancouver has very soft water, yet mediocre tasting bread is readily available there.

Flavour in bread will be down to how it is made (fermentation time&amp;process)&amp;ingredients (flour, salt (in particular), sugar etc etc). I would be very suprised if the flavour imparted by the water is distinguishable at all. The hardness would have an effect on fermentation time in extreme cases&amp;that may influence the taste - but as most breads here are no time doughs or recieve mimimal bulk fermentation, that isn&apos;t the case).

Thumbs up from me for Gourmet Croissant though -I am pleased they survived the ownership transition a few years ago. I would also recommend trying the pastries at Mountain Mercato on Main Street, the Cherry Cake I had yesterday was superb!!!

 re: LindaInCalgary 
Although a chain, I do find Cobs to have a place in the market, and I feel they beat grocery store alternatives in both quality (or lack of preservatives) and I hesitate to say artistry, but how about interesting-ness. I love Cobs Turkish Loaf, it is VERY much like that which P&amp;S;uses for their breakfast sandwiches (fantastic BTW), and their Cinnamon Scones I adore. Whole Wheat, Cape Seed, whatever, I&apos;m sure someone likes them. The Vienna Sourdough became petrified within 2 days, better to think of it as Melba Toast. I tried their Blueberry Teatime and Cinnamon Logs once, but wouldn&apos;t bother again. The Lemon Tarts were definitely lemon-y and worth doing again, but at 400 Calories each *ouch*, it will be a while.

I&apos;m all for supporting local establishments, but&quot;interesting&quot;is of great value to me, as is experience. My husband won&apos;t go near&quot;My Bread Lady&quot;out at the Bearspaw Market for her crabbiness, so all that said, I&apos;ll be back to Cobs for the Lekkerbrot, Turkish Loaf, and Cinnamon Scones; Gus&apos;s in Cochrane for Cocktail Buns, and Urban Baker for the Chocolate Sourdough, Cinnamon Buns, and Chocolate Banana Bran Muffins.

Located in the food court at the calgary farmers market on currie barracks there is a place called The Bakery@The Market. The owner is there all week baking up a storm for thrusday - sunday market.

I recently started buying my bread there because I am so sick of the preservative battle I have to go through looking for bread at the grocery store.

This place has a lot of very unique flavours to offer, the first that I tried is still my favourite: Stilton Walnut. Wild Rice green onion was very good as well. not the smoothest, prettiest mararons i have seen made, but there is always an array of different flavours, and their buttercreme is VERY good. smooth, light and barely sweet.

Local bakers rock my socks off.

Same story with me: former Montrealer longing for great, crusty European-style breads in Calgary. A reliable source (from Quebec!) just tipped me off to a new bakery that she says is excellent: Wilde Grainz Artisan Bakery, 1218c 9th Ave SE in Inglewood. I also second the Manual Latrue mention. Cobbs has a decent multigrain farmer&apos;s loaf, but not much else. Their pastries are made with margarine = YUCK! Prairie Mills does a nice sunflower whole wheat bread, heavy, earthy, but their crusty breads are too sour for my taste. Believe it or not, Costco&apos;s ciabatta breads are acceptable in a pinch. Brace yourself for a whole new bread culture here. Don&apos;t you miss Premier Moisson??!!
