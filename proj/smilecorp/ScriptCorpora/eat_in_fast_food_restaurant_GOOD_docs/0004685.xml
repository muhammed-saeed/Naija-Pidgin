Mama meals all the way!  Grew up eating Mama meal burgers and will continue eating them.  This is my &quot;In-N-Out&quot; and even better!  Whenever I&apos;m driving on the freeway through the 909 and see a Baker&apos;s sign, it&apos;s OVER!  I&apos;m off the next exit and into the parking lot of Baker&apos;s.

Welcome to Fontana~

Congratulations to my Sister-In-Law for becoming a home owner.  Big Giant 40,000 Square foot property out in the middle of nowhere.

After assisting her in getting settled in we decided that food was much needed.  The only problem was that neither her, my wife or myself knew where anything was...  By the looks of it the city of Fontana north of the #10 freeway is where civilization lives.  And south takes you back to simpler times like the town of Mayberry.  So after crossing the freeway and getting to Valley Blvd.  All we saw was a Baker&apos;s Drive Thru~

Now for Starters, I wouldn&apos;t be able to tell you where there is another Baker&apos;s Drive Thru in the entire State California.  The name seemed familiar, but when we walked in and checked out the menu which is a mix of Mexican and Burgers.  I was scratching my head.  I wasn&apos;t in the mood for either, so I decided on the Monterrey Chicken Sandwich, which consists of a grilled chicken breast with jack cheese and roasted Anaheim peppers.  Then the counter person asked me &quot;Do you wanna Pirate Size it Sir&quot;?  Ah Hmmmmm~  Guess that I am the &quot;out of towner&quot; now.  Yeah Sure!  I will take the Pirate Size.  All of Baker&apos;s Combo meals come with French Fries.

My wife went with the 2 Texas Taco Combo.  Whatever that is!  My sister in law went with the Double Burger Meal.  Overall my sandwich was really good.  Hot, Juicy with a good mix of flavors.  My wife thought she was getting hard shell tacos, but the combo was actually soft flour tortilla tacos.  She didn&apos;t complain either!  The food was tasty.

What can I say,  we are all looking for new business ventures in tough economic times.  Perhaps I should buy a franchise and set up shop in Los Angeles somewhere.

It would be fun to ask my customers
&quot;Would you like to Pirate Size the Combo&quot;??????

Give them a Try~

Cheers

Baker&apos;s ran a BOGO Facebook coupon special for shredded beef burritos, so I printed one out and gave them a try. They were excellent, so that fact and the friendly and efficient counter people who filled my order inside have rescued them from 2 star land.

I still can&apos;t stand their vinegary not-hot sauce, but that&apos;s why I have bottles of Pico Pica and Tapatio in my cupboard.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Bakers. I have grown up on this food. Excellent american food items from cheeseburgers to grilled cheese sandwiches, to Mexican food; bean and cheese burritos to quesadillas..My personal fave is the bean and cheese burrito..one of the best I have ever had.  Fries are delicious, salty, hot and fresh.

Dont forget about breakfast either..they are sticklers tho with the cut off time...11:15 am is the last time to put in that order for a breakfast burrito. I&apos;d reccomend the chorizo or the sausage; incredibly filling and just plain good.  Dessert is awesome too, best hand dipped shakes I have sampled so far!!! I love Bakers!!!!!
