Pop Burger
 58-60 Ninth Ave., New York, NY 10011 (212) 414-8686 We&apos;re surprised that few, if any, joints have taken the Meatpacking District name with such literalism, so Pop Burger remains a truly strange find in the increasingly annoying melee of West 14th Street. A delectably greasy burger-and-fries joint by day, the tony, brushed-steel aisles inexplicably convert into a raucous nightclub after sundown, and uptown hip-hop lovers cram into the canola-oil-scented booths to dance to fine &apos;80s fare and consume relatively cheap mixed drinks. No beef is incorporated in the alcoholic offerings, thankfully, but those deliciously unhealthy sliders are still available for table service. And just as a bonus, a small, shady booth also projects &apos;70s pornography in the very rear of the dance floor. What a strange, beautiful world we live in.
