 WIKI ANALYSIS   TOP CONTRIBUTORS Alexander Nicolau Thomas Shyr 
 Tim Hortons, Inc. ( NYSE :THI) is the largest fast food restaurant chain in Canada (and the fourth-largest in all of North America) based on market capitalization. [1] Its best selling product is coffee, and the chain is known for its &quot;double-double,&quot; a coffee with two creams and two sugars. Tim Horton&apos;s also has a food menu to complement its beverage selection, offering doughnuts, sandwiches, and other food items.

Despite intense competition throughout Canada coming from other fast food giants such as McDonald&apos;s , Tim Horton’s has acquired more than 75% share of customer traffic in Canada’s coffee and baked goods sector. The company views Quebec and Western Canada as its fastest-growing domestic markets and as opportunities for further expansion. Tim Horton&apos;s has also been eager to expand U.S. operations, since it already has high market saturation in Canada. This is problematic, as it is forced to compete with entrenched brands like Dunkin&apos; Donuts, McDonald&apos;s (MCD) , and Starbucks , and it hasn’t been that successful in the U.S. markets.

Another issue that the company confronts rising prices for commodities such as coffee, oil , wheat , and sugar, which have compressed margins. Tim Horton&apos;s must keep its products affordable to attract customers, which keeps it from passing these costs directly onto consumers.
