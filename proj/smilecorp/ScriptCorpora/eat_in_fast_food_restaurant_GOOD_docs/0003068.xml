The more I eat from this place, the more I love it.

I&apos;m not a vegetarian but the veggie wrap is the best!! OMG, you will not miss the meat at all. The flavoring is too good, it just melts in my mouth. Not to mention, the yummy, rich brownie and soft, gooey cookies. I&apos;m drooling just thinking about it now.

F2O is one of my fave places now. May I make a request for you to open one up in Gwinnett County. Johns Creek is too far. Don&apos;t be afraid of coming up in an Asian-filled place. Opening one up near the Forum in Norcross would be good since I live near there :D

I have a great experience here every time I go.  It&apos;s generally bright and clean.  And for mall food, it&apos;s very, very good.  I have people meet me here for lunch sometimes and they are always skeptical - they think we&apos;re meeting in the food court.  But they are typically pleasantly surprised.

It is pretty expensive, but as a vegetarian, it&apos;s a great casual option for me.  My favorite is the spinach salad with tofu.  I also like their vegetarian soup and sandwich options.  And the little croissant bread-y thing they offer with each meal is a nice finish.  I sometimes eat here with friends or just enjoy a meal by myself and &quot;mall people watch&quot; or watch the televisions in the restaurant.

I do think this is a great place.  Perhaps I&apos;m biased because every time I finish a meal at Fresh To Order, I head over to DSW (which is right next door), to walk through the aisles and walk off the calories :-)

I&apos;ve worked right near Cumberland Mall for five years and I&apos;d never been to Fresh to Order..

I wish I would have waited another five years.   The place seemed overrun with middle aged ladies with twenty pounds to loose (big surprise since its early spring).   We got there at 12:15, the wait in line was fifteen minutes to order, then the food came out at random times for the four of us, with one salad taking twenty minutes after the person went up to ask about it.   The manager came out and was apologetic.

I got a bowl of soup, side of vegetables, and a water and somehow my bill was over $9.  All the people I was with who got drinks were around $12.

Decent food, but expensive and slow, both of which are deal killers for me at lunch.

The Bourbon Filet Panini is amazing!

My wife and I love this place.  We were starving so just went to the closest restaurant, which is now one of a favorites.  And hands-down the best in it&apos;s category.

Atlanta needs more restaurant&apos;s where you order at the counter and sit down to be served your food.  Los Angeles has lots of these hybrids, but Atlanta few.

Customer service is impeccable.  Smiling faces, refills (never happens at hybrid restaurants), and great food.  You should absolutely try dining here.

At the Buckhead location, free parking is only for an hour.  My wife and I stayed for nearly two so were planning on paying the difference.  However the manager saw us putting in money into the parking machine and stopped us, ran inside (literally), and ran back out (still literally) to give us a second validation.  He said &quot;no one pays for parking while eating at my restaurant.&quot;

Even if the food wasn&apos;t good, we would&apos;ve been back just for this kindness.  However, the food is fantastic.  All of it!

This is a fun little place to take a break from shopping at Cumberland Mall. My favorite thing on the menu is a bourbon steak panini with caramelized onions. Nomtastic. I also love that you finish with a sucker. Just enough sweet to knock off the craving for a brownie. Bravo.

I understand the draw for a healthier meal out, but it&apos;s simply expensive for what you get.  For lunch (two drinks, a sandwich/salad, and a bowl of soup), we spent $20, and the taste didn&apos;t really merit $20.

I&apos;ve been to f2o (Fresh To Order) several times because some of my coworkers enjoy coming here for lunch.  f2o is a fast casual Atlanta restaurant chain that serves healthy foods (soups, salads, sandwiches, and various entrees) that are cooked-to-order.  It&apos;s one of those restaurants where you place your order at the register and then wait at your table for your food to be brought out.  There are six locations in metro Atlanta and one in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  This f2o location is inside Cumberland Mall on the ground level facing Costco.

This place is usually busy around lunchtime.  In addition to seating inside the restaurant, there are some tables outside in the mall area and outdoors on their narrow patio.  There&apos;s an open kitchen behind the registers so you can see the cooks preparing all the food.  They&apos;ve got a fire grill which they use to cook their &quot;fire-grilled chicken&quot; and grilled salmon entrees.  I&apos;ve always enjoyed their panini sandwiches the best, though, as they&apos;re pretty appetizing.

My favorites are the bourbon filet steak and the Waldorf chicken sandwiches.  The steak sandwich has caramelized onions, baby greens, and a tasty horseradish aioli.  The Waldorf chicken sandwich has chunks of their fire-grilled chicken together with fruits such as apples, grapes, and cranberries.  You have the option to mix it up and do half and half on sandwiches, salads, and soups.  There are also several healthy side options such as wheat berry rice, grilled vegetables, and fruit salad.

If you plan on getting your order to go, you can place your order online and specify a pick-up time.  When you get to the restaurant, you can skip the line and go straight to the to-go pick-up register.

Miscellaneous note: I once saw former professional wrestler Lex Luger eating lunch here with his family.  He was wearing a Tony Dorsett jersey.  It would&apos;ve been cool if he did a running forearm smash to somebody in the restaurant.

I love F20. This location is pretty good.
It is INSIDE the mall and parking can be tricky.

The staff is always friendly and the food is great!
What I don&apos;t understand is how they keep their prices SO low!
Such an easy, filling, and cheap dinner!

I always get the Caesar panini with sweet mash. Its fab.\
Asian salad is close 2nd.
So are the pork tenderloins!

Hint: &quot;like&quot; them on Facebook and make sure you sign up for their emails, they always have coupons and contests!

I met a friend for lunch here around 1:30 on a Saturday and was pleased to find that while there were plenty of patrons, it was not over-crowded like the food court in Cumberland Mall.

Since I&apos;ve only eaten here once, I can&apos;t attest to the whole menu, but I must say it looked pretty good...healthy choices and not just the average stuff.  It&apos;s a casual/fast dining kind of place with a more upscale feel than your average fast food restaurant.  You can choose where you sit and a server brings out your food when it&apos;s made.

I had the Almond Chicken Skewers.  They have a 3/4 portion and a full portion choice on the menu.  The full order was 50 or 60 cents more, so I just ordered the full.  Thankfully.  The chicken came with a side of mashed sweet potatoes and a small cabbage/carrot mixed salad.  The chicken was amazing!  It was not overcooked, and it was still tender and juicy...I think there were 5 skewers and honestly, I was disappointed when I ate the last one...for a pregnant lady, it was just not enough.  The sweet potatoes had cinnamon and toasted walnuts and were good.

The entree was $11.  I thought that given the price, the portion size would be larger, but I guess this is a made to order place with fresh ingredients and not just a burger and fries.  So...while I&apos;d probably choose this over the food court, it&apos;s also a bit of a splurge, but well worth it.

There is one item on their menu that keeps dragging me in..and that is their creamy, delicious, tasty tomato basil soup!!
My husband orders their market salad with chicken which is very good. Also gotta love that little piece of heaven that the put on the side: croissant.
Nice place to eat! Little pricey but worth it.

I&apos;ve stopped by a couple of times for lunch, and a quick tip -- go early! This place gets SUPER packed, and you&apos;ll find out why. Pretty much everything on the menu is healthy and delicious. You order at the counter and sit down with a number, and eventually, a staff member will make their way to you. The presentation is superb, it can make even a salad look amazing, and I don&apos;t even eat salads! Their panini sandwiches are great; I highly recommend them. Their chicken tenders are a little greasy, but it just melts in your mouth and the honey mustard is amazing. I also tried their calamari once, and would probably not eat it again. It was SUPER greasy and got soggy pretty fast. This is definitely my go-to when I want to eat healthy and not deprive myself of taste and flavor.

Good option for lunch -- the place is clean, the staff is friendly and quick.  My only complaint is the price seems a little high for the amount of food you get -- either increase portions or preferably, decrease prices for what you get.  But still a good option for a healthy lunch.

Love this place for lunch. Part of a chain, but it doesn&apos;t feel like it. The food tastes so fresh, with clean flavors.

For lunch, you can get anything from a panini to soup or a nice salad, and, if you&apos;re anything like me, and usually cant decide, You can get half soup and salad. You HAVE to eat their rolls as well, OMG, so yummy.

Today I had a very good Asian salad with avocado and corn chowder on the side; both were very tasty. The tomato bisque is also very good.

I&apos;ll have to agree that this place is pretty crammed at lunch, not to mention its in a mall (thankfully, not in the food court, but as a standalone), but if you can get over that, the food is worth it.

Tried out the F2O in Cumberland.  Glad to see it was by itself (not food court) and had seating inside and outside.  I went for lunch with a friend. We both ordered the asian chicken salad to eat there.  The server came and said they made it to go in error, no problem, so we got it in styrofoam containers.  Mine had 2 small slices of chicken and my friends had none.  I went up to the manager type - he said they made them wrong and would fix.  Great, brought them back out and forgot my friend&apos;s salad dressing.  So back we go.

The chicken was tasty; the real thing or at least that&apos;s how it tasted.  Most disappointing was the wilty lettuce.  I was hoping (and expect) in a salad place, I&apos;ll get fresh crisp lettuce.  No go.

I may give this one more try since its convenient to my office but won&apos;t drive out of my way for it.

My meetup group raved about the Gluten Free menu at Fresh2Order and I had been meaning to try it for some time. So, I was pleased when The Boy suggested we come here after the movie.

When I heard it was in the Cumberland Mall, I teased him about having to request applications for a new Boy, if this restaurant was actually in the Food Court. Fortunately, no interviews required, as it was far from the food court, located just inside the mall doors.

I was a little disappointed when I saw the GF menu, as it was very limited and mostly was a list of GF salad dressings. There were only two entrees in the Big Plate section, one being pork loin and another a chicken dish. Neither was of interest to me, so I opted for a Club Salad from the three that were available on the menu.

The Club Salad was a healthy portion and delicious, with Bacon, Avocado, Cranberries, Almonds, Cucumbers and Lettuce. Of course, the recommended salad dressing was not on the GF menu, so I opted with the Ranch and was surprised that it was not served on the side. Thankfully, it was just a drizzle of dressing and did not detract from all the wonderful flavors in the salad.

The meal was pleasing, but I don&apos;t see myself rushing back here. I had high expectations of the GF menu and was disappointed in the limited selection. I guess I should just be happy that they offered a GF menu, especially since there were items on the regular menu that I would have otherwise assumed were GF.

I eat at this Fresh to Order usually about 2-3 times a week.  Yes, their food is that good.  The staff is awesome and the food always comes out quickly.  Best of all - this isn&apos;t Wendy&apos;s or Mickey D&apos;s - this is HEALTHY food!  I usually get the Market salad and either add grilled chicken or the seared tuna. YUM.  Writing this review is making me hungry just thinking about the food here! Get off your butt and go get some deliciousness....

Although this place is one of those order-no server restaurant-ish places (I feel it is okay for like...chipotle with a VERY limited menu, but with a place like this that has pasta, salad, soups, sandwiches....yea that gets difficult)

Anyway, the food was FRESH and tasted SO SO good, it is also super conveniently located right by my house, score!

I got the cesar panni- I loveeee anything cesar and sandwichy mh mh it came with kettle chips (delish). I also got a salad- which was huge and came with a  croissant (weird).

F20 (I love downsizing names) also has a great selection of drinks- I got an old school sparkling lemonade.

Reasonably priced, everything I got came out to like $15, and no tip- so that&apos;s pretty sweet about the no server thing I guess haha.

On the same plane as the Panera&apos;s of the world, Fresh to Order is yet another addition to the &quot;healthy&quot; options of lunchtime destinations, or is it?

Like many of it&apos;s competitors, this place has a seemingly vast array of choices when it comes to your lunch menu. With a variety of salads, sandwiches, and soups, I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted right away. None of the options seemed to be jumping out at me. Already a &quot;not so great&quot; sign of this place... Everything seemed to try too much to be &quot;unique&quot;, or &quot;special&quot; in some way or another... Each item from the salad menu was paired with what they thought would go best with it... The salad I chose, the F2O Club Salad, suggested a Honey Mustard Dressing, as well as the crispy ale laced Chicken Tenders, making my salad choice less healthy off the bat. I opted for the Grilled Chicken, but stayed with the dressing suggestion (on the side).

Overall, the salad was decent. Nothing amazing, and nothing horrible... Just a salad that I would expect from any of the other cookie-cutter type lunch options around. It did try to distinguish itself from the rest with the use of dried cranberries and raisins, but that didn&apos;t really do much for me. The chicken was fairly decent, despite the fact that it was grilled rather than fried the way they suggested. It wasn&apos;t dry and chewy, suggesting that it was in fact, fresh to order.

The odd piece to this meal was the addition of the croissant. Again, not really something that I would see being paired with a salad of this sort... Tasting it was a mistake...

It&apos;s not that this place is a bad option, and I suppose that it&apos;s a good thing to see places try to be &quot;fresh&quot; and all, but really isn&apos;t most food made &quot;fresh&quot; to begin with? I mean, take away the Burger Kings of the world, and you&apos;re left with the Paneras and Corner Bakerys... They all do the same thing I think... I could be wrong, but it seems to be a lot of marketing and hype.

That said, it&apos;s not a place I would seek out again, but it&apos;s not a place that is on the blacklist.

This was my second time coming here. I had previously gone to the Midtown location.I was glad it was not in the food court, otherwise I would have been punished.

I have gotten a chicken dish both times I have come here and have not been disappointed. Their chicken tenders were cooked well, had good flavor, and were quite plentiful. The garlic mashed potatoes were good as well. I even got a free cookie because they messed up my order the first time.

My only complaint is that they give you a tiny cup for water. I drink a lot of water, and I hate having to get up several times per meal for a refill. I guess it is better than having a tiny cup with waiter service and having to wait on them though.

I visited f20 the day before yesterday (6/10/08). This was my third time dining at one of thier stores and my second @ this particular location. The store has a lowkey spot in the mall. Upon entering the store, you will immediately be impressed by its trendy decor, large flat screen tvs, easy-to-read menu displays and friendly crew members. Affixed to the regular menu are the After-5 Chef Specials. I was in the mood for a glass of red wine and a nice seafood dish. MY attention was immediately captuted by the Crab&amp;Avocado Crusted Salmon. The cashier, who took my order was less than friendly and looked as if she wanted to be somewhere else, but she promptly took my order, poured my glass of wine, and assigned me a number to sit on my table, so the food runner would know where to deliver the appropriate order.

Well, I must say the salmon was some of the best tasting salmon I have had in a  long time. My plate featured two nice sized salmon fillets , topped with a shredded crab/avocado stuffing. My side item was garlic mashed potatoes. Also, I was given the choice of a croissant or tuscan bread to accompany my meal. I chose the croissant, which was hot, fresh and glazed with a sort of honey butter. The food was exxxxxxtra tasty, even though the salmon was a little over cooked, but I got over it. I think it would also be helpful to know that the mashed potatoes were garnished with chives/green onions. The menu did not mention the onion, and though I do like onions, I think it would be helpful to know that  the potatoes had the onion, for guests who might be allergic or those who just don&apos;t want them.

The food runners on the dining room floor were much more friendly then the cashier. They were mostly younger, maybe in thier latter teens or early 20s, but they were very visible, engaging and proficient. I saw them having conversations with other guests, and they promptly removed all unused dishes, including my own.

Overall, this was a pleasant trip.!!!

I&apos;ve had f2o 3 times now in 3 different locations (midtown, buckhead, cumberland)...and I must say, this one is the most disappointing so far. BUT, the reason I&apos;m finally writing a review for this place isn&apos;t to complain about this location, it&apos;s because I discovered today that you could place your order online and it&apos;s so easy and fun! The online ordering process is fancier than others I have seen and let&apos;s you customize your order to your heart&apos;s content (with all sorts of options for switching out existing sides or adding extra sides), pay online with a credit card, and then pick up in 29 minutes!

I mentioned the credit card thing because I can&apos;t ever bring myself to NOT leave a tip when I&apos;m signing my credit card slip right in front of the cashier and there is a line for tip...even though this place is self-serve. So yes, this is the first time I didn&apos;t tip at f2o, and it&apos;s only because there is no way to do so online. That&apos;s a win-win for me.

What I ordered:

Tenderloins Of Chicken Plate + Grilled Vegetables $9.99
Grilled Salmon Plate + Wheat Berry Rice $9.99
Salmon Panini on Cibatta $7.99 + Wheat Berry Rice $0.99
SubTotal + Tax = $30.70

What I thought:

1. Nowhere in &quot;tenderloins of chicken&quot; did it suggest to me that it&apos;s fried chicken nuggets...I found that disappointing and counter-intuitive for a &quot;healthy&quot; place.

2. The grilled vegetables included a grilled corn on the cob (half), zucchini, squash, and other vegetables that I don&apos;t like...I thought this was strange because I assumed it&apos;d be the standard broccoli-n-carrots-type thing.

3. Grilled salmon was good, but the sauce was a tad on the sweet side.

4. Salmon panini...pretty much every person I know who&apos;s been to f2o will tell you this is one of the best, if not THE best thing on the menu. This time, it was good tasting as usual but quite sloppy in terms of assembly.

5. The wheat berry rice (can you tell I love it by the double order?) was much saltier than I&apos;ve had before and I couldn&apos;t even eat more than 3 bites.

All in all, if they could lighten up on the salt, be more descriptive in their menu, and attempt to actually serve healthy stuff, I would happily add another star.

Okay, I&apos;ve only been here once, but I&apos;ve been talking about it since then, so I guess that means I&apos;m a fan?

I ordered the half soup/half salad lunch special.  Corn chowder = yummy!  There goes that soup kick of mine again!  Salad was pretty good as well.  The roll that they serve with it is tasty too!

I&apos;m waiting to go back so I can try something else, but I fear that I will get in a rut and order the same thing each time because of how good it is!

Not such a bad thing though, is it?

This appears to be one of those restaurants with something for everyone, which is something that we needed because we couldn&apos;t agree on where to eat.  Figures that it would be in a mall.

I decided to go with the half soup half salad deal, tortilla soup and Asian salad.  Here is where presentation comes into play.  There really isn&apos;t a whole lot of food but it&apos;s served on a long rectangular plate to make it seem like there&apos;s more than there actually is.  The tortilla soup had a strange sour taste to it.  Other than that, it was ok.  The only real differences between the Asian salad here and the sesame salads at Panera are that you can throw different meats on the salads here and they throw nuts in your salad here.  Basically, when you come here, expect to spend around 10 bucks for a meal and a drink.

When you arrive, you order at the counter, grab a number, and put it at your table.  They bring the food to your table.  Gotta love the drink fountain here, especially with the sweet tea.  You can create your own sweet tea/unsweet tea/lemonade mixture.  If you&apos;re going to try to convince the masses eat healthier, it all needs to be cheaper.

I really enjoy having a healthy option for &quot;fast food&quot;. All the soups are made the same day and the tomato bisque is my favorite. Staff is always friendly and courteous too.

Just happen to be taking a scroll at Cumberland mall when I happen to get that hungry feeling so I saw this spot never heard of it before so I wanted to check it out.

The decor of the place was nice, the upscale feel but nothing really upscale about it.

I had the Mediterranean salad with bourbon grilled steak with a apricot dressing which was great, I have never tasted a apricot vinaigrette before so it was great......

The food was fresh had quick server really nice they explained everything on the menu in great detail....the food  was good no but I have to say that they do put a different twist on the salad....

I hadn&apos;t been here in a while, I was hungry&amp;in the mall area - so I decided to opt out of the &apos;tour of Chinese food&apos; that is the food court and go to F2O.  They have changed their menu.  They have taken my FAVORITE dish off of the menu, darnnit!  No more crab avocado encrusted salmon for me...  Shucks!  I wish I had been warned, I would have made a special trip just to give it the necessary goodbye before it was gone.  I decided to get something else with the Salmon, but I had to modify it, I was WAY too picky for what they were suggesting - some corn relish on top of it?  Well, I got the meal - I had them to make the salmon, but give me a mushroom sauce on top.  It came with the wheat berry rice and a few lettuce leaves.  It was only one piece of salmon!  Wha??? My FAVE meal always came with 2!  I ate it, it was alright, but dunno how enthused I am to return.

As always, fruitflies are flying all around the lemonade&amp;tea... not so fresh.  Why don&apos;t they DO something about that!

I will never understand why they think that it is a good idea to ask someone to give a tip when they have to order their own food.  There is no waiter service, you don&apos;t get a tip!

Great place for lunch. I had the spinach salad, dressing on the side, chicken on top.
The order was quick, the cashier was very pleasant and helpful. The food arrived with the quickness as well.
The chicken was warm, as I like it, a lot of restaurants will serve the chicken cold. The portion was great and all of the ingredients tasted fresh.

Priced right, convenient location, and delicious!

(waving white flag) Ok! Ok! Ok! I surrender! f2o you have won my love back! You had a bad day on my previous visit, but now you&apos;ve got your SWAG back!
Your prices are very conservative given the quality and quantity of ingredients.
I appreciate management&apos;s genuine effort to make me a happy and repeat customer. I will say they read these reviews and want their customers to be happy!! And happy I am!
On this visit, I had the Asian salad w/seared tuna. FLAVORLISHIOUS!! I was a little weary about the amount of ingredients on the plate, but each seemed to compliment the other so well. I want some NOW!!
I also sampled the calamari dish (subbed out the wheat berry rice and went for the grilled veggies)....YUM! and YUM again.
So here&apos;s the thing Fresh...you&apos;re back on top, and it&apos;s well deserved!
Yelpers- give it a try, you&apos;ll be locked in for life. I&apos;ll see you there!

P.S.- service, atmosphere, cleanliness yadda yadda yadda are all 5 stars.

I am really upset to give this place only 2 stars. I have been contemplating on writing this review since Monday...and hopefully Monday was just a bad day...but unfortunately I won&apos;t be going back. Everytime that I go to this place I usually order the salmon long plate...and Monday was no exception to the rule. I really should have stopped at the first bite...because something didn&apos;t taste right...but I just thought that it was me. Long story short...I spent the remainder of Monday (and I went to the restaurant at 11:00am) and part of Tuesday (my bday) with some sort of illness that felt like a food bug. Maybe the salmon was not kept cold enough...I do not know. But I am not going to dog this place out...I just won&apos;t be going back. I literally spent the remainder of the day with my head in the toilet...TMI...I know.

I guess I should&apos;ve known better because my boyfriend had the salmon pannini back in May and he, too, got pretty sick. It hurts me to my soul because I love love love salmon...I just won&apos;t be eating it from here anymore.

Always fresh&amp;healthy! I visit F20 at least once a week for their salads. Never get tired of it. There are plenty of options to keep your taste buds happy. Where else can you find a decent meal under 350 calories&amp;$10?

Had this for the first time a few weeks ago and actually kinda forgot about it!  I definitely will be going back though!  I ordered the Asian salad w/ almond crusted tuna and some kind of apricot dressing....sounds weird but it was very good!  Hubby got the chicken tenders (he&apos;s so original) w/ garlic mashed potatoes.  He said the chicken was really good and I tried the potatoes which were tasty too.  Even though its a fast-food setting, the restaurant is decorated nicely and you feel as if you are in a &quot;real&quot; sit-down place.  The servers who brought the drinks always kept us refilled as well, so that was nice!

I love the Waldorf Chicken Salad Panini served here! The food is both fresh and delicious - their paninis are perfectly pressed and served with salty, yummy chips or slices of fresh apples. A bonus I wasn&apos;t expecting was their 20% military discount - thanks f2O! Highly recommended!

Wish I had this place when I was living in Atlanta. Houstons quality food in a family friendly atmosphere. We love taking our family here. Options galore. Salads are the bomb and nice size portions. Great concept.  Only 4 stars because I want them to come to the Nashville market. A must for travelers staying near the galleria and to-go is a plus.
