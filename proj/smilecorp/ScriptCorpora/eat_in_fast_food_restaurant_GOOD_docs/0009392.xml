 Reviews for La Quinta Inn&amp;Suites Grand Junction: 7           AVERAGE OVERALL RATING SERVICE (3) CLEANLINESS (3.5) LOCATION (3) VALUE (3) Sort By: Most Recent Positive Negative Most Helpful           USER RATING NOT a good experience By Angel , 3/30/12 My boyfriend and I decided to book this hotel because it was a little cheaper than the local Holiday Inn, which was a TERRIBLE mistake. First off, its in a terrible location (unless you&apos;re there for the airport) When we got there, the clerk was nice, but not overly friendly. We got into our room, and being the neat freak I am, I looked through the room to check it out. There was black animal hair all over the bed, on the comforter, and when I pulled the comforter back to look at the sheets it was also on the sheets. There were stains all over my boyfriends pillow. There is a desk in the room as well, which looked like it hadnt been wiped. It had old coffee spots on it and what looked to be like peanut shells on the desk and all over the floor. We figured that we&apos;d paid for it so we would make the best of it and sleep in the cleaner bed and ignore the dirty desk as we wouldnt be using it anyways. When I went to go throw away a tissue in the trashcan (which didnt even have a trash bag in it) there were old yogurt containers, and plates, as well as a cup and other various items in it that WERE NOT OURS. That was the final straw. We called the Holiday Inn, they had a few rooms open, so we packed our bags, went to the front desk where the clerk was kind enough to give us a refund (its actually still pending on the card, so lets hope it goes back in) and we left to the Holiday Inn that is in the middle of all the great shopping and restaurants, and its within walking distance of Mesa Mall. I would recommend Holiday Inn, not La quinta! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem SERVICE (4) CLEANLINESS (1) LOCATION (1) VALUE (1)           USER RATING We will not be back By caithlin , 4/24/09 We had stayed at a La Quinta in nearby Fruita the previous year, found the accomodations quite satisfactory and so had no reservations about staying in another one before an early morning flight out of Grand Junction.
Sadly, our experience left us with too little sleep and the decision to never return. The room was stuffy, smelled a little&quot;off&quot;and the thermostat on the air-conditioner wouldn&apos;t go lower than 65 degrees. Almost every button on the T.V remote ---not only the channel up/down but also the mute, menu and, most curiously, the volume control--caused the T.V to change channels. I was watching a favorite program and hit&apos;mute&apos;during a commercial break. Suddenly I was watching a sports channel. Pressing mute again did NOT bring me back to my program but to yet another channel. It took several minutes to find my program again as there was no T.V guide in the room and nothing I pressed on the remote would bring up a menu on the screen....every button just changed the channel. There was no fan in the bathroom and the pillows on the bed were like rocks making it impossible to get comfortable when we went to bed. The din of the air conditioner also made sleeping difficult. We tried opening the window instead but there was too much noise from the interstate and bright lights from the parking lot. After a restless few hours we got up and decided to take our things to the car. We found that the elevator was shut off. I have no objections to taking the stairs for three flights but what if I had had a broken leg and couldn&apos;t manage stairs very well? What is the rationale behind shutting the elevator off at night anyway? To top everything off, when I went to the front desk at 5:45 a.m to return the keys and get a printed receipt, there was no one there. There was no bell to ring so I yelled&quot;hello&quot;repeatedly but got no response. I did see a younger guy standing on the sidewalk outside the lobby doors talking on a cell phone who looked like he could be the clerk due to the way he was dressed but he made no motion to get off the phone and come inside when he saw me go into the lobby. 
 I would recommend you spend your money and the night elsewhere. I chose La Quinta over the Marriott Courtyard (which has always been a good experience) because I wanted to save $50. I won&apos;t make the same mistake again. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 1 of 1 Yahoo! Users found this review helpful SERVICE (1) CLEANLINESS (3) LOCATION (1) VALUE (1)           USER RATING It was great! By A Yahoo! Contributor , 3/14/08 Very close to the airport, good, clean, friendly place. There was free wireless Internet in the lobby, a helpful staff and some very nice touches like freshly baked cookies in the lobby and a workout room. Only complaint is the workout room isn&apos;t open early enough. Should be able to use it earlier than 7 a.m. The free breakfast was more than expected. I will be going back as I use the airport there several times a year and have stayed at other hotels but I&apos;ve found I prefer this La Quinta to the rest. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem SERVICE (5) CLEANLINESS (5) LOCATION (5) VALUE (4)           USER RATING From misery to wonderful By A Yahoo! Contributor , 2/27/08 Our trip to Grand Junction was a disaster, involving too many bad memories to recount here! The roads were awful,the snow was worse and we were tired, freezing and frustrated when we arrived. The desk clerk greeted us very warmly and listened to our horror stories while checking us in. The added pity was a great touch! Fast check in made things great. The room was clean and very nice, the bed was wonderful. The rooms have small coffee pots that were a great addition. The morning lady at the desk had been on all night but was just great to us and our dogs. She even took the time to warn guests at breakfast to warm up their cars and be sure to check the weather reports she had printed out for road conditions because some of them had been closed. It&apos;s the only place we&apos;ll book when we need to go back. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem SERVICE (5) CLEANLINESS (4) LOCATION (4) VALUE (4)           USER RATING The Way All Hotels Should Be Rum By Vivian Reed , 12/24/06 I made an online reservation on Hotels.com for this hotel based on previous reviews. We weren&apos;t disappointed. The desk clerk was friendly and efficient (important after a long drive). The special requests I put into the Hotel.com reservation were fulfilled (upper floor, quiet room, mountain view). The rooms are bigger than average and we did in fact have a view of the mountains. The hotel staff recommended a local Italian restaurant named Pantuso&apos;s where we got a 10 percent discount and a good meal. The continental breakfast was also good with sausage, eggs and waffles. For $68 for four people you couldn&apos;t ask for more. Only problem is finding it. You see it from the freeway but have to go up a block to get there. Was this review helpful?

By Donna R , 6/8/05 The hotel was very clean and comfortable. The garden area around the back side of the hotel had the offerings of a gazebo and park benches to sit on. 
 Every morning there was a complimentary buffet filled with fresh fruits, your choice of cereal, a waffle maker, eggs, multi-flavoured teas and fresh coffee to chose from. 
 The atmosphere was comfortable and the staff friendly and willing to help out when needed. 
 A short walk to the store or a couple of blocks to get to that fast food restaurant. Larger family restaurants were further away however, my stay was based on staying close to the hotel. 
 If your looking for a place to stay and not doing too many things mobile this is the place to stay. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 3 of 4 Yahoo!
