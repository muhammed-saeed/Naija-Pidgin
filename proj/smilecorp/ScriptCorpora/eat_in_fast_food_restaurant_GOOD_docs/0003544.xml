Try frugal substitutes

 

 O ne common weight-loss tool is making choices from a food exchange list. Frugality works in a similar way. You can make decisions based on available alternatives. Instead of losing weight, you save money, use what you have on hand, repair and/or waste less.
What type of cheaper options have you discovered? Here are a few to consider.

 CUT THE CABLE/SATELLITE: 

You won’t miss much with alternatives such as Hulu, Netflix, Red Box and your public library. Cable subscribers are dropping and for good reason. There are cheaper alternatives! At the very least, call and negotiate a lower rate.

 CRAFT SUPPLIES: 

“Why buy retail?”can be your new mantra. Look to Freecycle, eBay classifieds and auctions, or Craigslist for supplies, or post a“want”list.

 SKIN EXFOLIANT: 

Instead of a costly skincare product, go natural. One reader, Lori from Illinois, suggests:“Take a pair of panty hose or knee highs, cut off the leg, and fill the foot part with equal parts of baking soda or brown sugar. Tie the end. Double the panty hose in thickness to make sure the ingredients do not seep out too fast. Wet the skin and if you want, lightly lather with a body shampoo, soap or olive oil. Use the nylons as a“loofah,”and gently scrub your skin. Afterward, apply a light moisturizer.”

 PAPER NAPKINS:

Maybe you don’t want to buy cloth napkins. You can save paper napkins from fast-food restaurant orders. Check your workplace if takeout is no longer in your budget. Put out the word that you’ll take them instead of them being thrown away. You can make your own cloth napkins, too. Visit www.skiptomylou.org/2009/04/20/make-your-own-cloth-napkins for an easy tutorial. If you don’t sew, simply cut cotton fabric 16 inches by 16 inches with pinking shears. Instead of buying new fabric, reuse an older tablecloth, sheets or clothing.

 TEXTBOOKS: 

Not every student can afford college textbooks with ease. An alternative to buying used textbooks is renting them. Try chegg.com or bookrenter.com, which can be especially helpful for renting textbooks for general education-required classes.

 AIR FRESHENERS: 

Take a walk in the home-scent aisle in any store and you’ll see many options to mask the smells in your home. You can use a few drops of vanilla or essential oil on a cotton ball, or pour vinegar into a spray bottle, add 20 drops of essential oil (optional) and spritz the air. Open a window, and let fresh air in, too. If you prefer not to spray it, you can pour some into a small bowl and set it on a table. Don’t toss it out when you’re done. Use it to clean your microwave. Add some water to your bowl of vinegar. Place it in your microwave, and set it to high for 3 minutes. Once it steams, turn it off. Wipe the interior clean. Or freeze citrus peels as you consume lemons, grapefruit and oranges. Simmer them on the stove with cinnamon and cloves to scent your home naturally.

 REPAIR: 

Instead of replacing an item, try to repair it. Visit websites such as Appliance Guru ( www.applianceguru.com ) Repair Clinic ( www.repairclinic.com ) and AP Wagner (www.apwagner.com) for parts information and do-it-yourself-repair resources.

 FITNESS: 

Instead of paying for a gym membership, work out at home or seek out cheaper options. Another reader, Liz from Canada, shares:“Buy a few workout DVDs and take up running or walking. Or instead of paying for yoga classes, inquire about an“energy exchange”or“karma yoga”program. Clean the studio/work reception in exchange for free classes. The number of classes you get for a certain amount of work varies but most yoga studios have a program like this.”

Don’t forget to check out your local library, too, for exercise resources (as well as books for DIY repair, natural skin care, etc.)! My library has exercise DVDs that I can check out for free, and of course, there are books. Also, check and see if your library stocks fitness magazines.

I think people forget about the library, but it’s such a great resource, and it’s free! Mine also offers online renewal for items, so I get a reminder when something I’ve checked out is about to be due and I can renew it in seconds, so I rarely have late fees.

Unfortunately where I live I’d have to pay 90 dollars a year to use the library so that is not an option.

WOW! Paying for library use, and I thought library fees where expensive. Another example of our hard earned tax money going to poor use and the local governments that support these tactics. There are some book swap web sites out there as an option.

College Text Books: I’ve noticed that renting books from my experience can be very expensive and almost equal to simply purchasing out-right. After purchasing books it gives me the opportunity to re-sale the books after the semester. One warning is that the books are updated so frequently that you might be left holding a book nobody wants….don’t get me started about the text book industry.

On FITNESS: Forget the gym! Ride your bicycle to work, or to run errands. Why do people insist on driving their cars three blocks to pick up a bag of milk? Next to home mortgages, automobiles are the single most expensive item we have. You could buy 20 high-end commuter bikes for the price of a USED economy car. With the money you save on gym memberships and gas, you could replace two of them every year. You have to pay insurance, gas, maintenance on a car…and then drive it to the gym to work off that‘junk’in YOUR trunk. Crazy world we live in. I live in Canada, and I cycle year’round. The roads are plowed and salted/sanded in the winter, and it’s no different than any other aerobic winter sport. Dress properly, and you are good to go!

Netflix also has workout videos, that you can get instant and not on dvd. And alot of people don’t know that you can pay for high speed cable and not have to get cable tv and or phone lines. I love Netflix, I travel a great deal, and it is nice that I can watch it anywhere I have internet.
Skipping the car is alsome, I try walking whenever I can, but for that to really work, it really depends on your location.. I have lived places where the nearest anything was a hour drive away.. and with a family of four, bike riding is just out of the question. But soon I hope to be living in a city where I won’t need a car at all.. where If I can not bike or walk.. I can take a bus ). And a bus pass is much cheaper than a car as well. There are so many programs out there, that can help you save money and time and make healthier impacts on the world, sometimes they are alittle hard to find, but well worth it.

Wow, I can’t believe you have to pay to use the library @Anna, there is just something so wrong about that.

I love finding substitutes, it is so satisfying knowing that you saved money and usually time as well. I do all of my esthetics on my own and it’s super relaxing–I’ve never tried the panty hose exfoliater, but I often mix regular sugar with my creamy face wash to do the same thing. It’s great!

A few other things I do around the house to save money include decorating old coffee tins and shoeboxes for storage, using well-worn t shirts as cleaning clothes and dying my own hair. I have to agree though, this is probably something best left to the pros. I actually just recently did my own repair too, I didn’t use any of the sites you mentioned but still ordered my part online from Partselect. I thought they were really cool because I could read through other peoples experiences. It took me a bit to figure out on my own, but I was SO proud after and gloated to my husband all day.

In my experience, just searching on Google can give you a whole list of things that you can do yourself and save the money. Most of the time when I need something or have a problem, this is what I do.

Good luck!
