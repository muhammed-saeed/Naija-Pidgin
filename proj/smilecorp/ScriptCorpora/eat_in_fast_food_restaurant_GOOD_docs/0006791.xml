My List Of Some Of The Best Food Movies
 Do you love movies? Do you love to cook? If you answered yes to these two questions, then you probably love food movies , too, just like I do. Welcome to my list of some of the best food movies out there.

Picking the best movie has proven to be very difficult though as best lists are always subject to interpretation. What each individual enjoys in a movie is different. You could be looking for drama, romance, comedy or a myriad of other qualities in your movies. Maybe you LOVE an actor like Johnny Depp (I do) or maybe you do not.

I was, therefore, fairly loose with this list. I chose to include those movies that appeal to me from Amazon&apos;s bestseller lists and those that are frequently discussed on other best food movie lists.

I will definitely be looking for your ideas and recommendations. As a matter of fact, you can vote for your favorite food movie which will help us come up with a short list of the best-ever food movies. Plus, you can add your recommendations in the comment box near the end on this page and I&apos;ll consider adding them to the master list.

By the way, I have chosen to exclude foreign language movies with English subtitles because, generally speaking, I do not enjoy them. I have also excluded food documentaries as I was looking for entertaining movies and not-so-much informative ones.

Since I keep finding new cooking movies that I have NOT seen but which sound interesting, this page is sure to be a growing resource. Be sure to bookmark it and to come back and see what new movies we have added to the list. It would also be great if you come back to add your review of any new movies that you see.

 Chocolat Ratatouille Julie and Julia Cooking With Stella The Best Food Movie, A List More Food Movies 
 
Feast On These Movies!


 
Chocolat

Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche literally sizzle in this Academy Award nominated movie.
 

Nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, Chocolat is a wonderful movie packed with it all. That is, with great talent, chocolate and sizzle. The star studded cast features Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Juliette Binoche, Alfred Molina and Lena Olin.

The story? Vianne Rocher travels with her young daughter, encountering much skepticism and resistance in France in a conservative, rural town when they open a beautiful chocolate shop during Lent. However, the townsfolk soon embrace her zest for life and her chocolates. All that is, except the major who wants to have her shop closed. In this movie, Vianne teaches the townsfolk about acceptance when a group of river drifters arrives and she falls in love at the same time.

I definitely love this movie . I love the book and I love the soundtrack .

Amazon Customer Review of the Chocolate Blu-ray Movie

Mark Zablotny says,&quot;This is NOT a chick flick!&quot;
 

&quot; First off, I like good movies with&quot;guts&quot;- i.e. - if you liked Armageddon (or most of the movies produced today) we are in two different worlds. Chocolat is not a&quot;girlie&quot;movie. It was very cleverly written and has great acting. Dame Judith Dench was particularly outstanding (my favorite movie of hers). The blu-ray version is clear and vibrant. Superlative movie in every way. &quot;~~ Mark Zablotny

Ratatouille

Rat-a-too-ee ~~ Remy spices up life in this Acadamy Award winning movie.
 

No, I haven&apos;t gone crazy and no, I&apos;m not a particularly big fan of animated movies, either but Ratatouille is another story altogether. I love Ratatouille. It is the animated movie that I set out to buy FOR ME and NOT for my children. I love the fact that this movie is set in Paris (it is actually installed as my wallpaper on my computer) and I love the food in the kitchen where Remy aspires to work. That pot of soup, c&apos;est magnifique!

And no, I wouldn&apos;t ordinarily want a rat in my kitchen, but for this world-famous, well-loved rat named Remy, I would make an exception!

How can you resist a food movie that was nominated for FIVE Academy Awards which included Original Score, Achievement in Sound Editing, Achievement in Sound Mixing, Original Screenplay and Animated Feature Film and the category in which it won, Best Animated Feature?

Amazon Customer Review of the Ratatouille Blu-ray Movie

&quot;A Rat Chef Dishes Up Delights...Bon Appetit!&quot;~~ Gerard D. Launay
 
&quot; Everything about this film is wonderful...the streets of Paris are recreated in rich colors and exquisite detail. I haven&apos;t seen a European city look this good in an animated film since Disney&apos;s&quot;Pinocchio.&quot;Yes, it is definitely worth experiencing this delight on Blu-Ray. Oh my, even the French copper pots look authentic. &quot;~~ Gerard D. Launay

Julie and Julia

Based on two true cooking stories.
 

If you like cooking and you like movies, there is no way you could have missed the presence of this movie this past year. You might, however, have been unable to fit it into your busy schedule yet. (I have not.) However, do to the immense popularity of the Julie and Julia blog, the Julie and Julia book and the movie, I am assuming it is a must add movie to this list and I have put it firmly on my list to watch this weekend. I will definitely report back.

Meanwhile, the story, in case you just happen to have missed it. Young Julie was a bored office worker who decided to give her life a focus by cooking every recipe in Julia Child&apos;s cookbook...and blogging about it. One book and one movie later, I guess you&apos;d have to call her experiment a success!

The cast features Amy Adams, Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci and Vanessa Ferlito. About Streep, Rolling Stone reviewer Peter Travers wrote,&quot;Meryl Streep - at her brilliant, beguiling best - is the spice that does the trick for the yummy Julie&amp;Julia.&quot;

Kenneth Turan, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said&quot;[Julie&amp;Julia] does it right. A consummate entertainment that echoes the rhythms and attitudes of classic Hollywood, it&apos;s a satisfying throwback to those old-fashioned movie fantasies where impossible dreams do come true. And, in this case, it really happened. Twice.&quot;

Definitely sounds like a food movie worthy of any foodie&apos;s attention.

High Def Digest Review of Julie&amp;Julia
 &quot; Julie&amp;Julia is a delightful homage to food, perseverance, and dreams, and features another knockout performance from the grande dame of American cinema, Meryl Streep. Nora Ephron&apos;s film won&apos;t change the world, but it will get your stomach growling and just might inspire you to pick up a pound or two of butter on your next trip to the supermarket. Good quality video and audio and some nice supplements beef up this Blu-ray disc, but it&apos;s Streep&apos;s spot-on portrayal of Child that makes &apos;Julie&amp;Julia&apos; a truly delicious dish. Recommended. &quot;~~ Highdefdigest.com

More Cooking With Stella Information

An interesting new food movie that I just discovered but have not seen yet.
 For now, you are going to have to see Cooking With Stella at the movie theatre for it was just released in the movie theatres on March 19th. The story? That of a diplomatic family on a Canadian diplomatic post in India. She is on an assignment which means that he is the stay-at-home Dad. By training, he is a cook and part of his reason for moving to India is to&quot;broaden his palate.&quot;He learns about Indian food and cooking through his own cook who has been working for the diplomatic families for her entire life...and he learns a bit more than that, too. Cooking With Stella ~~ Indian Food and A Movie My blog post on Music&amp;Movie Treasures By Brenda, with a longer discussion of this movie. Cooking with Stella (2009) - Plot Summary A newly posted Canadian diplomatic couple Michael and Maya arrive with their baby and, after an initial jolt when she learns that Michael will be staying home as&quot;diplomatic housewife&quot;while Maya goes off to work, everything goes swimmingly for Stella. Michael was a chef in Ottawa and he is longing to learn authentic Indian cooking. Stella agrees to be his&quot;cooking guru&quot;. But Stella&apos;s cozy domestic set-up implodes when Tannu, an honest nanny, joins the household, and threatens to expose Stella&apos;s deceptions.

 Julie&amp;Julia (On my short list to watch.) 

Julie&amp;Julia is based on the book by Julie Powell, a frustrated New York bureaucrat who wants to be a writer.&quot;But you&apos;re not a writer until someone publishes you,&quot;she moans. So she gives herself a challenge: to cook her way through Julia Child&apos;s Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year, and to blog about it. As Powell (played with chirpy determination by Amy Adams), begins to find her groove as a cook, and her voice as a writer, the project takes on a life of its own...

 Chocolat (One of my absolute favorite movies.) 

Chocolat is a beautiful and captivating comedy. Nobody could have imagined the impact that the striking Vianne would make when she arrived in a tranquil, old-fashioned French town. In her very unusual chocolate shop, Vianne begins to create mouth-watering confections that almost magically inspire the straitlaced villagers to abandon themselves to temptation and happiness!

 Eat Drink Man Woman 

This is not a movie to see on an empty stomach. Writer-director Ang Lee&apos;s 1994 Oscar nominee tells a family story about a chef and his three daughters through the meals the chef prepares and serves his family. This touching, dryly funny story of a family coping with personal lives and the way those lives intersect with the family relationships captures a shift in generations in Taipei. The father, a famous chef who has lost his taste buds, still cooks, though he draws no pleasure from eating.

 What&apos;s Cooking? 

At first glance, What&apos;s Cooking? looks like it was dreamed up by some politically correct screenwriting committee: a series of overlapping stories that intercut among four families (one Hispanic, one Vietnamese, one African American, one Jewish) all preparing for Thanksgiving dinner. But what could be toothless and smarmy is made gripping and genuinely affecting by a mixture of observant writing, fluid direction, and a truly superb ensemble of actors.
