It&apos;ll make a mess, but won&apos;t damage anything.

For N/A cars, get a fake turbo/whistle tip and screw that onto the exhaust real quick.

For boosted cars with an easy-to-access BOV, there&apos;s only one solution.
Blow off valve + Duct tape + TURKEY CALL

alright mr. hardass :roll:

he did say they are going back and forth with the pranks and that he&apos;s not asking for suggestions that would be damaging.

something like covering it with post it notes would do the trick.

 Who said he was going to go postal on me? It&apos;s a mutual thing, if one of us wanted out he would simply say so...

 Exactly. He&apos;s looking for&quot;nuisance&quot;or&quot;hilarity&quot;not lasting damage. Thus I didn&apos;t post any of my Genuinely Malicious plans.

We took the windshield wipers and arms off my other buddies car, just a little lever to release them from the posts.
Another buddy lettered &apos;Mustang&apos; on the back glass of my other buddies Bronco II .
I found a shopping cart in the back of my Bronco II cause they knew the rear window latch would pop if you just twisted the handle some

Find the bumper stick that says&quot;I love c0cks&quot;and put it on his back bumper.

Assuming your friend is a guy.

 Maybe I only see how stupid the situations are. 2 kids, bore out of their mind and don&apos;t know what else to kill the time decided to mess with each other cars.
Honey or bird sh*t on his car. If you couldn&apos;t find any bird sh*t, replace it with any sh*t of your choice. It might be disgusting for him to clean it up, but nothing a good wash wouldn&apos;t clear up.

Take a large tie-wrap and wrap it around the driveshaft, letting the end hang loose. (Tuck the end out of sight)
When they get a little speed, the end of the tie-wrap will start whomping against the underside of the vehicle.

I did this a few years back to a worker who lived 75 miles away from the jobsite, he told us the next day that he drove about 50 miles and it didn&apos;t get any worse, but for some reason, he drove all the way back to the jobsite (50 miles?) before he even looked under his truck!
(He wasn&apos;t the sharpest pencil in the box, BTW!) __________________
