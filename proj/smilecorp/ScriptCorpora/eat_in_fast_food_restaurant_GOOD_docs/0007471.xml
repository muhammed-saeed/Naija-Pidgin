Warrants Issued for Suspect in Western U.S. Crime Spree
 Print Email 2012-01-03T13:40:00Z Warrants Issued for Suspect in Western U.S. Crime Spree By PAUL FOY - Associated Press Magicvalley.com January 03, 2012 1:40 pm  •  By PAUL FOY - Associated Press (0) Comments 
SALT LAKE CITY • Authorities issued an arrest warrant for a
suspect in the killing of an elderly Utah couple and the shooting
of a woman outside a Nevada casino.

The warrant accuses Logan Welles McFarland, 24, of burglarizing the
couple&apos;s Mount Pleasant home. They were found shot to death
Saturday.

Police said a witness told them McFarland bragged at a Friday night
party about obtaining money and firearms.

The warrant filed in court Tuesday says McFarland and a woman left
in a stolen car for West Wendover, Nev., where police say they shot
and wounded a woman in the head during a carjacking.

McFarland and suspect Angela Atwood were last seen in Nevada
driving a stolen gray Volkswagen Jetta with Colorado license plate
725WHX, authorities said.

Atwood has not been charged. McFarland is being sought on suspicion
of felony burglary, the warrant states.

Jewelry and other stolen items from the home of LeRoy and Ann
Fullwood were found in the trunk of a car the suspects took from
the Friday night party, police said.

The car was ditched about 45 miles away and a stolen Saturn sedan
was allegedly used to drive to West Wendover. A receipt from a
fast-food restaurant found in the car indicated the meal was paid
for with LeRoy Fullwood&apos;s stolen credit card.

In West Wendover, Atwood tried to steal another car in a
carjacking, police said. But the driver of that car resisted and
was shot in the head.

The Jetta was then stolen in a motel parking lot.
