Do you share drinking glasses?
 Do you ever drink out of your kids cups or let them take a sip out of yours? What about sharing a spoon/fork?

Yes. At a fast food restaurant, we usually get one drink to share between the three of us.

ETA: I will only share if there is a straw involved. I can&apos;t deal with backwash.

NOT ANY MORE. Our dentist told us we have to stop, since our little ones first were getting cavities. The bacteria in you and DH&apos;s mouth spreads to theirs and helps them get their first cavities. 

Don&apos;t do it.

I let them have an occasional sip or a bite off of my fork, but not that often. I don&apos;t like to share my drink because they always have so much backwash/floaties in theirs.

This exactly. My big girls can share a bottle of water, but I typically have my own.

Occasionally. We&apos;re more likely to share a water bottle or something when we&apos;re out.
