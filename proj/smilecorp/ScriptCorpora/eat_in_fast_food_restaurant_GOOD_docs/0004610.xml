Program offers free lunch for kids on vacation

 Published: December 27, 2011 - 12:00 AM Elvira Martinez and her children Issac, 7 and Saray Torres, 9, get napkins from volunteer Jim Sullivan at lunch time at Cups Cafe on in Medina. The Cups Cafe is offering free lunches to anyone over the holiday break, especially Medina school children.

MEDINA: Vacations sometimes bring hunger for kids whose families don’t have a lot of money, so a Medina group is providing free lunches with holiday style.

The aim is to help kids who ordinarily benefit from school lunch and breakfast programs but do without during the holiday break. Meals are served from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Cups Cafe, 126 N. Court St.

“They get free lunches [at school], but when they are home, they don’t get any,”said Terry O’Connor, food distribution coordinator for Feeding Medina. Fliers are passed out at local schools, telling children they have a safe place to visit midday and get a hot meal.

On Monday, they were served corn dogs, fresh fruit and holiday sweets.

It’s an extension of a program sponsored by Cornerstone Wellness that runs all year. Last summer, free lunches went to as many as 60 kids a day, O’Connor said. During the school year, kids are given food to discreetly put in their backpacks to take home.

O’Connor said volunteers provide the help quietly so kids are not embarrassed. But he said the help is needed.

“We find that on Monday, when they come to school, they haven’t had anything to eat all weekend, so we do lunch bags on Thursday…and then they take the food home for the weekend.”

School lunches and the backpack operation are interrupted by the holiday vacation, so Cornerstone set up the free lunches to fill the gap.

Elvira Martinez, who brought her son and daughter to the cafe, said it’s a big help.

“They help our family to have something to eat,”she said.

Cups Cafe has additional programs at dinnertime, but she’s unable to come because she works at a fast-food restaurant.

The emphasis is on kids, but anyone is welcome to stop by and get a nourishing lunch, free of charge.

Clarence and Nancy Owens said they came three times last week and again Monday because times are difficult. He’s 68 and retired. She’s 61 and works as a waitress.

“Everything helps the budget,”Clarence said.“We shut the furnace off at night. In the daytime I turn it up to 58-60. We’re doing just fine. We struggle. We do without, but we are doing fine.”

Cindy McQuown of Cornerstone Wellness said a $5,800 grant from the Medina County Community Fund helps keep the program going, along with being able to buy food at a discount from the Akron-Canton Regional Foodbank.

“We’re doing our best to get the word out, and the school helps us spread the news,”she said.“We don’t turn anybody away that shows up.”

Registration is not needed. Food is provided until it is gone, probably providing enough for about 100 kids. Anything remaining is left behind for the Cups Cafe evening program.

The free lunches will continue daily until next Tuesday.
