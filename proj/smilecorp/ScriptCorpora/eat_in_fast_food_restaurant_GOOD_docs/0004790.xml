Question
 Jane W 
Do you charge groceries and gasoline on your Credit Card?

I noticed that recently there has been alot of talk about people who use their credit cards for nearly everything. I see people who use a Visa or Mastercard for $3.00 purchases at a fast food restaurant. Many of my friends carry no cash at all and use a credit or debit card for every expense. It seems scary to me to not have any cash because if there is a huge power outage or emergency, you would be out of luck.

I recently just started to charge my groceries and gasoline due to extra Thankyou Network Points connected with my Bank.

What do you think of charging for necessities?

I always use my debit card for everything. I don&apos;t have a credit card though because they are horrible. Spending money that you don&apos;t have just doesn&apos;t make sense to me. I believe in saving money. But yeah, I have made $1 purchases before with my debit card. It&apos;s no big deal. I mean if you carry around cash all the time and you loose your wallet - then you will get robbed. This actually happened to one of my friends. He lost $200 because he was just carrying it around. On the other hand, if someone steals your debit/credit card - your bank will reimburse you for all of the stolen charges. No big deal. I prefer debit cards vs. cash, except when I need to do laundry - coin op. :D

No. . . I use cash or debit.

well I&apos;m not so sure ask the people at the bank maybe they can tell you :3
 by Rainbow cookie - 4 years ago 
I think charging in general is a bad idea. With the direction our country is headed, people living on credit are going to have huge problems when stores actually want cash because credit means nothing.
 by hprebel311 - 4 years ago 
yup you can
 by life or something like it - 4 years ago 
As long as you can be responsible enough to watch your spending to pay it all off at the end of the month, it&apos;s fine to charge stuff to just get the points for rewards.

However, if you often charge stuff and then you can&apos;t pay the bill off at the end of the month, you end up paying more in interest than any freebies you would get from the credit card&apos;s rewards program.

I used to use credit card for all.

well i no that my teacher and my parents use thire credit card for gas just to make sure they will be getting enough gas to fill the tank. i no they just use money for groceries when they dont have a lot but when they buy alot they use credit card
 by splover1234 - 4 years ago 
It&apos;s convenient and I get a statement at the end of month showing me where my money went. I pay off the credit cards every month. If there was a massive power outage, back up generators would come on line - otherwise how would stores use their registers?
 by picopico - 4 years ago 
ya most people have to with gas being almost 4 dollars a gallon now

i always use my debit card for everything...but i also carry like a little cash just in case....some places only accept cash
 by star819 - 4 years ago 
Unfortunately, I have occasionally. It is best not to, because after you factor in interest charges, what is final price you ended up paying for that gas? Something to think about. I like using a credit card for either emergencies, or as a quick loan for things that you will have for a while, not quickly expendable things like food or gas.
 by Big Mr.Muffet - 4 years ago 
Charging for necessities is a good and easy way to build credit. It is what I did in the beginning when I got my first credit card... I used it for gas only. I don&apos;t think it matters much if you use your debit card and how much you use it, since its connected to your bank account, and not to your credit. But I would definitely recommend using your credit card for groceries and gas... you&apos;re right, it gets you points and it helps to build credit.
 by comfortable0 - 4 years ago 
no those two would be the dumbest thing to charge on your credit card. you have to pay interest for them and they don&apos;t last. better spend it on something of value.
 by theusedtheused - 4 years ago 
Well how often does a power outage occur ? and if it does it rarely last long .

I do use my credit card for gas and groceries to acrue points . I just cashed in my points for a $25.00 gift card to one of my very favorite restaurants .
 by laurie - 4 years ago 
Yes, with a low-limit card we pay off each month so we don&apos;t pay interest. But not for anything that small unless it&apos;s an emergency. We have our own business and know full well how much of that the card companies take from the vendor in transaction fees.
 by John&apos;s Secret Identity™ - 4 years ago 
A credit card is something I don&apos;t use! Too many people are spending money that they don&apos;t have!

I use a debit card occasionally. I use cash mostly.
 by JustMe. - 4 years ago 
I don&apos;t like credit cards for that sort of thing, unless you are buying items online.

I would only use them when I buy something really expensive, like a guitar, piano, or other things I wouldn&apos;t normally be able to afford. I mean, isn&apos;t it sort of the point to only use them when you are low on cash, unless you are using debit?

I like bringing cash with me, so I do not over spend;If you have a credit card, you get this idea in your head that&quot;the sky is the limit&quot;when really you can&apos;t afford half of what you just bought.

that may be just me, but I hope not,

nope, credit cards are like dangerous, u have to pay almost twice as much as u charge
 by flashystunna6oy - 4 years ago 
I sometimes charge when I&apos;m out of cash, but I really do prefer to use cash. All your charges are tracked and your spending habits are used to create a data base/portfolio on you when you use a credit card. Do some research, it&apos;s pretty scary.
 by kadiss17 - 4 years ago 
I use debit for those. gasoline isn&apos;t a necessity and I keep extra food in the house and I grow food so I should be fine if the power goes out and I can&apos;t use my card. There really isn&apos;t much of anything I would absolutely need to buy if there was an emergency.
 by Betsy - 4 years ago 
I don&apos;t like credit cards and therefore don&apos;t use them. I do use a debit card to purchase gas and groceries. I still prefer cash for the little incidentals items though.
 by CygnusX1 - 4 years ago 
I personally hate having bills coming in for stuff I have already used up.
So I don&apos;t use credit cards for consumables.
 by bob shark - 4 years ago 
Yes, because in case of emergency if there is a bank run the cast in the ATM machines will be dained so that is why I use my credit cards to all my purchases. Well since you have a thank you network also that is a good thing since all dollar you spend you could earn points.
 by travelguy3680 - 4 years ago 
I have charged my gasoline on my credit card at times. It would be because I don&apos;t have a lot of cash on me or because the cash I have on me is for another use. Such as, my child is in an afterschool program and they don&apos;t take debit or credit for payment. So I have to pay her monthly bill with cash or money order.

I&apos;ve also charged food with my debit or credit card. I do this because it helps me maintain an outstanding credit rating with the company. When you&apos;re trying to keep your credit ratings in good standards, the company doesn&apos;t care how much your transaction cost. All they want to see is that you are using the card and can pay the outstanding bill.
 by sweetnsexy_38 - 4 years ago 
I use my credit card a lot, mostly my American Express. I have to pay that in full at the end of the month so using that card forces me to watch what I spend. I live in Florida so during hurricane season I make sure and have cash on hand, even if there is no immanent storm.
 by Morbius - 4 years ago 
I&apos;m starting to use debit more, but I put my gas on my discover card because I get 5% cash back for that.
 by xbluebellax - 4 years ago 
I have a 6% cash back for all gas purchases I got at creditcardwarehouseonline.com and also have one for everyday purchases. So I charge all my groceries and gas. However I also pay the balance in full each month. If you do not pay the balance then the cash back isnt worth it. Also if you have any rewards cards and are able to pay off the balance in full it is well worth it to charge everything.
 by Bryce K - 4 years ago 
I use debit only. Charge card used only for large purchases
