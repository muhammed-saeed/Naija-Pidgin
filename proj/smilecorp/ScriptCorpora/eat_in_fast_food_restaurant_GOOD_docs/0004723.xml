I didn&apos;t even know there was such thing as a Jollibee before my boyfriend. I was kind of in the dark when it came to Filipino cuisine and I still am very much in the dark so I&apos;m not sure what to really say or criticize.

Lots of fried chicken, spaghetti, and burgers and such. It&apos;s fast food! I tried filipino spaghetti for the first time here. It&apos;s sweet and tastes kind of like ketchup (I love ketchup so this was fine for me). My boyfriend seems to think the chicken is good here. He gets it with rice.

Anyways, this place is busy and usually crowded but the lines move pretty quickly so it&apos;s not too bad. 3/5

I finally tried Jollibee for the very first time despite warnings from my Filipino friends. When I walked in I was a bit overwhelmed by the menu since they offered a lot of really random items like spaghetti, chicken, burger with a pineapple, fiesta noodles, and other random crap. The employees were not very friendly but I guess what can you expect out of 16 year old teenagers. I ordered a chicken plate and it was greasy and gross. The spaghetti side was sugary and disgusting.

The place was dirty too but I will say that it was also packed with people. When one of my Filipino friends found out I was eating there, he called to directly apologize for &quot;his people&quot; and told me that this food does no way truly represent Filipino food. As a Mexican I believed him because it will be like saying that Taco Bell is real Mexican Food. The only difference is that Taco Bell is actually tasty. Jollibee is disgusting.

Delish! But chaotic!!!

Jollibee is the number one food chain in the Philippines. Anaheim is one of their many branches worldwide.
Great variety from burgers to fried chicken to rice to spaghetti, satisfying most cravings.

If you&apos;re not familiar with the menu and the food would recommend trying the chicken first. Spaghetti is sweeter than the usual Italian offerings.  Personally I love the burger steak (hamburger patty with mushroom gravy), you can also order a fried egg and have it loco moco style. Lumpia (eggrolls) are available.

The drink coolers are delish--ube (purple taro) and buko pandan (coconut and screwpine) are very yummy.

The little pies also have some different flavors peach mango and banana lanka (lanka is jackfruit) a departure from your apple and cherry pies.

Remember when you&apos;re eating here it is fast food, so don&apos;t expect too much, but enjoy the experience and tastes of another culture--Americanized. It&apos;s also a quick way to enjoy what has been rated as one of the  best fast-food chains in the world by international online travel magazine Travel+Leisure.

I love jollibee. Their chicken is fried to perfection every time. I have never tried any of their sides so this review is strictly based on their deliciously crispy golden fried chicken.

I always drive by this place and have never tired it until today when my brain was telling me to be adventurous... bad idea.
I recall reading the oc weekly food blog and they mentioned the fiesta noodles here was the item to try, and i believe it also made it on to their top food list. Well, whoever nominated this dish must have been smoking crack! I got the combo w/ the fried chicken leg and both items were super nast... greasy soggy fried chicken, and the fiesta noodles had no flavor, with some funky sauce on top. Gross! Never again!

Oh Jollibee... How do I rate thee?

-Food -3 stars
-Cleanliness - 3.5 stars (new)
-Service - 4 stars (everyone is eager to help)
- Speed - 1 star (keep reading)

Here&apos;s the deal.... I love Jollibee but, seriously, it&apos;s a mission if you like white meat (like chicken breast)!  I know most filipinos like dark meat; but what about the heathier choice (such a cliche with the fried chicken)? Anyways, 20 minute wait for the white meat option! I guess the freshness makes up for it.

On the flip side, their spaghetti is so tasty! How could you not enjoy hotdogs in your spaghetti? Lol!

Fyi... Gravy is delish with rice and chicken!

My favorite fast food in the WORLD!!! The chicken is so flaky that it crumbles in your mouth. I always get mine Extra Spicy! Not to mention its tenderness and juiciness... Super delicious especially if paired with the all-time favorite spaghetti! You can&apos;t find this spaghetti&amp;chicken combo anywhere else... Also, try the palabok noodles! You can&apos;t go wrong with it. I would eat here everyday if I lived closer to it. I mean it literally... :)

It&apos;s all about the chicken and rice here! Ohh ya their gravy deserves an extra star. :) if you are super hungry, get some fiesta noodles (known by Filipinos as Palabok) too. It&apos;s not as good as home cooking but for a fast food restaurant, this place does the job. The nice part is there is a red ribbon bakery next door so you can make it your one stop shop!

It&apos;s Filipino fast food and for what it&apos;s supposed to be, uh, this is what you get.  My friend wanted to check this place out so we went in, and unfortunately had the displeasure of trying their fried chicken.  It was so greasy and flavorless after a couple bites, tossed the rest out.  Their &quot;world famous gravy&quot; sauce made me wonder, in what world?  Because it sure isn&apos;t this one.

The fries were just OK.  How can you mess up fries.  If you mess up fries, you sir, do not belong in the fast food industry.  The worst part of our dining experience was we walked in and one of the patrons was changing her baby&apos;s diaper at one of the freekin&apos; tables.  Free country and all, but DANG yo, can you do that in the privacy of the bathroom?  I know it&apos;s not Jollibee&apos;s fault, but uh, yeah, kind of killed it for me.  If the food had made up for it, I could&apos;ve closed my eyes to it.

If you do not like Jollibee chicken and spaghetti before coming here, please check your Americanized taste buds at the door.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m an OC-born-and-raised chic but this IS modern day Filipino fast food so get over it people! :D Jollibee is NOT meant to be authentic filipino food or traditional Filipino take-out. It, truly, is the nation&apos;s version of McDonald&apos;s.

The chicken is meant to be crispy, warm, a bit salty with a seemingly bland gravy to balance it out. And OH MY GOD! YES!! As every Pinoy/Pinay knows, the spaghetti is as sweet-and mixed with little chopped hot dogs-as it should be. The peach mango pies are still so flaky, hot and full of sweet goodness it almost made me close my eyes and smile.

You&apos;re treated with real Filipino hospitality from the moment you open the door or order from drive-thru.

If you&apos;re fien&apos;n&apos; for something that will take you &quot;home,&quot; dine in. It won&apos;t be as crowded in the morning but you&apos;ll still forget you&apos;re in the States for a while :)

A smiling Jollibee himself greets all who enter.  This bee has no stinger in it&apos;s butt and resembles Bob&apos;s Big Boy. Inside, it&apos;s fairly roomy with red furniture in a bright modern interior. The same smile greeted me at the counter and those who go through the drive through service.  It&apos;s a favorite hangout for many of the mostly Filipino American families that were here. Besides the many locations in the Philippines, there are several locations in California, e.g. Union City, Cerritos, etc

As a 20-year organic gardener, I have plenty of reasons to love bees. They make my pollinating plants jolly.  But Jollibee food-- well, it&apos;s just okay. The friend I went with said his hamburger was mediocre.  No comment from me since I didn&apos;t try it. After having great fried chicken like Jim Dandy&apos;s in LA and Honey&apos;s Kettle in Culver City, this chicken just doesn&apos;t compare.  I was more than happy patronizing a restaurant whose investors, managers, and workers are from my homeland.  But my taste buds were not so happy.  Those who like Jollibees would probably approve my 2nd grade Catholic school nuns in the PI slapping my keyboarding hands.

The staff was smiling and friendly. I saw several people eating their pancit (noodles) and fish.  I had their two piece Fried Chicken special with rice and gravy.  The chicken was tender, but too greasy and not very.  I needed napkins under each piece to drain off excess fat.  The chicken must&apos;ve been either pressure cooked like KFC or their oil is not that hot. Overall, not bad, not great.  Church&apos;s and Popeye&apos;s chicken -definitely crisper, less greasy, and better seasoned - are better.

In the Philippines where I went for a vacation last year, this chain with their spaghetti with hot dog slices excessive sugar is hugely popular.  But, it&apos;s just too sweet  to me though lots of people like it. Definitely very Filipino (sugar as a preservative, hot dogs or Vienna sausage as a meat) in it&apos;s approach.

I didn&apos;t have it this time, but I like their halo-halo which I didn&apos;t have here. I have had at their Cerritos location.  BTW, halo halo which translates to mix-mix is a shaved ice and sugar, evaporated milk, and preserved Filipino fruits dessert that is sometimes topped with Ube (taro) or other ice cream.  You mix it up and spoon into your mouth. Other than that, with this being a very crowded mini mall especially during rush hour, I&apos;m not going to rush back here. But if a Filipino person gets homesick, this place will probably help him or her feel connected with the motherland.

Duh, its a Jollibee. There&apos;s chicken and filipino spaghetti. I got 2 pieces of chicken, rice, gravy, and a drink for 4.99. That&apos;s not that bad. I took the chicken 30 minutes away and ate it later. It was still crispy, delicious, and warm. It&apos;s not Popeyes but it has got its own merits. I personally never ever get burgers here because they weren&apos;t even good in the Philippines.

They have midweek deals going on. One deal was 6 pieces of chicken and family sized spaghetti for $10. That&apos;s cheap. They also have $10 deals for pairs, like if you&apos;re on a date you both can chose one combo each and get 2 drinks and 2 pies. Good deal. I was only feeding myself so I couldn&apos;t get a deal.

The workers were nice to me. Maybe it was because it wasn&apos;t that busy, but I didn&apos;t have any kind of issue.

I have to say this place is a little different.  But my friends say it&apos;s huge in the Philippines.  I do have to say when I saw the menu, I was quite surprised.  Fried Chicken&amp;hamburger pattis with sauce.  Not quite what I thought.    But the chicken was very juicy!!  I got a side of the sweet potatoe waffle fries, YUM!!  For the price&amp;size, wow!!

We also tried their soup dish which was good.  The pies were good as well.  Kinda like McD&apos;s pies but just diff&apos;t flavors.

There&apos;s a bakery next door as well which I&apos;ll try next time.

I wasn&apos;t impress with their flavorless fried chicken -POPEYES chicken still king when it comes to that department. I don&apos;t care how nice&amp;modern you make your place to be, what matters most is satisfaction of one&apos;s TASTE buds. Maybe I should&apos;ve gotten the spaghetti or somethin&apos; but then again maybe I won&apos;t b/c I&apos;ve tasted better filipino food elsewhere.. I never was a big fan of Jollibee anyways, they just try too hard. Staff at the counter couldn&apos;t even get my order right when I decided to get the combo instead of the bucket of chicken. Bad experience ruins all.

I just recently be came a regular here. Never heard of this place before 2 years ago and than I wasn&apos;t a fan. This place is alright it sort of grew on me. I can&apos;t say this place sucks because I&apos;m always using the drive-thru. It&apos;s closer to my house so that&apos;s a plus!

Food :
Salisbury Burger Steak
The spicy chicken (has a good spice)
Yum burger

Spaghetti isn&apos;t great to me at least! Maybe different for you! But I don&apos;t like sweet spaghetti :(

Gravy is good&amp;great with chicken!

Honestly this place is ok something different from your everyday fast food joint!

Actually came here in October for my daughter&apos;s birthday lunch. Tried the fried chicken and mashed potato with gravy...interesting...this is Filipino fast food. Maybe I&apos;m biased because I was born and raised here in Cali, this is not fast food, well not good fast food. The fried chicken was greasy and mashed potatoes was warm and dry? Gravy was meh, KFC is the best! My daughter had the spaghetti, it was sweet.

Should have walked over, next door to Red Ribbon...

Ah, its time to review the Mickey D&apos;s of Philippines.

DO NOT COMPARE THIS PLACE TO KFC OR ROSCOES!

People usually come here for their fried chicken, halohalo and the Pinoy spaghetti an d the fried pies!
With that said, lets break them downnnn!!!

Fried chicken: Do not compare KFC or Roscoes. They serve you dark meat, which is not very popular in US but!, there is usually more flavor on the dark meat then the white meat! ba bam!

Halohalo: If your American or &quot;white&quot;, you won&apos;t notice the difference between a good halohalo and the halohalo they sell here.  Its alright, but really, I feel a little ripoff everytime I get it here. It is just great for a hot summer day.

Spaghetti: What is the difference between the spaghetti you know and this type of spaghetti?? - Pinoy spaghetti is usually sweet but it can be too sweet for your tastebuds so it really depends on the people.

Pies! - Remember those fruit pies you buy from Walmart?? Well...same thing but fried and warm in the inside.

This place is FIlipino fast food so if this is your first time here, you will feel like an alien. It is also for nostalgic purposes and it is not the flagship of Filipino food.
===
Pros:
Fried chicken
The piess!!
Pinoy hospitality and ...
THE MASCOT IS A BEE!!!

Cons:
It really depends on the person if they like it.

DO NOT COMPARE THIS PLACE TO KFC OR ROSCOES!

I&apos;m sorry to say it, but the chicken truly is terrifying. It nearly damned ruined my life! =O I may need therapy now just to get over it. Maybe in October they should turn it into one of those temporary Halloween attractions. It would probably do well- scaring people with their chicken, along with the creepy looking bee that already haunts patrons out in front. Sounds like a win-win situation to me!

What makes it even more annoying is that my mom freakin loves this place! Ever since she found out about it I swear it&apos;s &quot;Jollibee&quot; this, &quot;Jollibee&quot; that. Oh. My. F. God. Can someone please shoot me? I can never understand how she&apos;s able to eat this shit. (-_-)

Now I&apos;m really starting to believe that she&apos;s a part of this whole damn conspiracy too. (-_-)

Yelp Really needs to have ZERO STARS OR NEGATIVE STARS.
Ordered a 12 piece Chicken bucket, By the way all a LA carte, you have to buy everything individually. Chicken was undercooked, Spaghetti was noodles with Ketchup and cut up hot dog weenies, yes, no joke, ketchup with cut up weenies in the spaghetti.
Did not try the hamburgers but will probably not cause we won&apos;t be going back here.
Overall, very expensive for some nasty chicken and spaghetti made from the recipe of a 5 year old.
We Do Not Recommend and we won&apos;t be going back.
By the way, I am Filipino, this is a Filipino restaurant, where is the Rice?

I&apos;m not Filipino BUT I like having the option of some Filipino fast food (as opposed to other restaurants where everything sits in warming trays/bins and is full of oil).

I was being adventurous after a bit of shopping&amp;decided to try Jollibee.  I really wanted to have some longanisa or tocino but it was after breakfast hours.  Instead, I tried a two piece of chicken joy&amp;a little big bite spam sandwich.  The chicken was actually good - it was pretty crispy&amp;the flavor of the chicken was nice as well.  I ordered mashed potatoes as my side - pretty standard but good.  They also give you an extra small cup of gravy to dip your chicken in - I love that because I am a fan of gravy.  =)  The little big bite was ok - basically a sweet Hawaiian roll, a little mayo&amp;some cooked spam.  I can probably do this at home though.

Next time, I shall try more items&amp;get some longanisa without having to cook it myself at home.  I was tempted by the halo halo and the mango/jackfruit pies too but I controlled myself. =)

JOLLIBEE ROCKS...........when it&apos;s 7300 miles away&amp;in the Philippines.  After suffering at the hands of the threat of contracting a water or foodborne disease, it&apos;s the best...stuff...ever.  Like EVER-ever.

But alas, here we are in California.  And in California, we live by California&apos;s standards.  And the standard for a good fast-food burger is In-N-Out, the standard for good fast-food fried chicken is Popeyes, and the standard for good fast-food spaghetti is----in a jar of Ragu?  It&apos;s all actually pretty good&amp;it makes me wonder if Jollibee can compete.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love Jollibee.  I love what it stands for.  I love the idea, I admire its recent success to be able to open up a branch in Anaheim.  I wouldn&apos;t change it...but I&apos;d rather just give it the occasional visit when I&apos;m in Cebu, Philippines where I&apos;d appreciate it more.  Because here, with In-N-Out, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d really have the craving for a yumburger.

The spaghetti is bound to single-handedly cause diabetes because it&apos;s sweet.  The mango-peach pie had a chapstick-y aftertaste.  Burgers aren&apos;t too memorable but I&apos;ll admit I&apos;m a sucker for their fries.

I&apos;m not too much into Filipino food, but Filipino fast food to me is a different story.

Fried chicken with gravy and a sweet spaghetti is the main entree here.

I&apos;m pretty sure the fried chicken joy is MSG loaded! Man, to me its like having an addiction to McDonald French fries. Chicken Joy is heavily seasoned which I like because its flavorful, even better, dip em&apos; in gravy.
Being Filipino you gotta have them with rice too!

The spaghetti: sauce blended with pasta, saucey and sweet is key here chops of hotdog in the blend too awesome!

The significants about this location is, its wider but it can be busy so you may end up seating on the other side where Red Ribbon is at. The employees here are cool, polite and they appear to be having fun even though there&apos;s a rush.

3.5 stars for this Jollibee but they all need to lower their prices so I can afford to buy a bucket of chicken joy.

The Filipino food here is not so great.  There are much better and more authentic places nearby (like Kapit Bahay).

Chicken Joy is overpriced; $20 for 12 pieces.  Go to Popeye&apos;s or KFC instead for fast-food fried chicken.

I really, really, wanted to like this place. But I&apos;ve been here twice and both times, this place has failed me.

My boyfriend talked about Jollibee all the time, and they finally opened this location which is pretty close to his house, so we went there so I could try it out.

The chicken isn&apos;t crispy, but more soggy which is unfortunate. My first time I tried the two piece combo with the two sides (corn and mashed potatoes). The chicken was soggy, the corn was overly buttered, and the mashed potatoes were okay. The second time I tried the chicken strips, but it was disappointing once again. The chicken didn&apos;t taste like anything (if that makes sense) and the texture kind of seemed off to me.

The only thing that I ended up liking was the mango peach pie (2 for $3.50).

The fried chicken is pretty gross. It tastes like pure grease. I actually had to peel the skin away just to eat the meat because the grease was starting to make me feel sick. Aside from that, the flavor was pretty bland.

The worse part though is the gravy, which came with my combo. It was very thick and slightly peppery and absolutely disgusting. It was like something out of a clogged grease trap.

Its about time I write a review about this location, I thought I wrote a review alreadt, but I guess not.

Ahh!! Finally a close Jollibee in my area. This is my fav  Jollibee location.  Theyre fast, friendly and most importantly, they don&apos;t charge for extra gravy, yes!!

This location just opened up last October and I hope their awesome service and free gravy doesnt change, lol!

I love their chicken joy, beats KFC`s fried chicken. Their pansit palabok ua good too. I recently tried their fried bangus (milk fish) and it was alright, it was  too fishy for me.
Overall, I&apos;ll be going back to :)

Sweet sweet sweet! This is my first time coming to Jolibee. So glad that they finally opened up in Anaheim. The Filipino McDonald&apos;s has arrived. A very small menu with typical items. The difference is in the taste. The food here is all SWEET. I ordered the spaghetti plate with 1 piece of chicken joy. Also got a side of mashed potatoes. The spaghetti had tomato sauce , cheese, and cut up hot dog pieces. The sauce itself is sweeter than normal spaghetti. The chicken was good too. It goes up well against the other fast food chicken spots. The mashed potatoes and gravy was on par with KFC as well. The food here probably has sugar added to everything. Not a bad place at all. I am definitely coming back when I&apos;m in Anaheim. Welcome to the OC Jolibee!

Recommendation: Spaghetti with 1pc chicken joy.

Awww man.... I wish I was the first to review, especially if the first review was only one sentence long and seems like they didn&apos;t step foot in the place. No biggie though; they&apos;ll probably edit it once they tried the place.

So here goes... I&apos;ve heard a lot about Jollibee from my Filipino friends and the comments made on http://OCRegister.com , so I wanted to go and check it out.

My friend and I ordered the same thing but with different sides. We both got the C2 Chicken Joy meal that comes with 2 pieces of chicken (original or spicy), 2 sides of your choice, and a drink. For sides, she got sweet potato fries and mashed potatoes, while I got french fries and buttered corn.

First off, the chicken was nicely cooked (crunchy skin on the outside - my fave part. hahaha) and juicy meat on the inside. The size of the chicken pieces were also big compared to KFC.

The sides we had:
- Sweet potato fries are the bomb! The way they are criss-cut makes it fun to eat and the pattern gives it more surface area to actually fry and become crunchy.
- Regular fries were also crunchy. They were also pretty long pieces in there that weren&apos;t over-fried and oily. Just the right amount of frying.
- Buttered corn: Tastes like regular buttered corn.
- Mashed potatoes: Good thing they gave us one small carton of gravy with each meal because you&apos;re going to need the extra gravy on the mashed potatoes. I really wish there was more flavoring in the actual potatoes as well.

The service was nice. When we came (around 1:30pm), it was so crowded, we had to wait outside in a line before getting inside. The cashier was a bit forgetful. I had to repeat my order three times before he was able to input it correctly. Even then, our order was still wrong, but that was easily fixed (I got the spicy, while my cousin got the original when it was suppose to be the other way around). The whole experience was tolerable though because the place did just open.

The atmosphere was great. Very clean since it just opened, but the only thing I would complain about would be how freezing it is in the main lobby!!! Good thing there was a pocket room on the inside where it was much warmer. The place was also connected to the Red Ribbon Bakery on the side.

I would love to come here again if I&apos;m ever in the area, but that&apos;s about it. If I ever do come back though, I&apos;ll try a burger that time around since I have also heard many great things about that.

Not a place we&apos;ll be coming back to...we had heard many mixed review about this place but since it was down the street and the newest thing open in our area we checked it out for lunch...the spicy chicken was ok...but nothing to write home about...I really have nothing else to say about it sadly...except that their soda fountain was the next best thing they had...

Their chicken was served warm, i wanted it hot. Took awhile for my purple yam drink to come out. Their service was alright.

The plus is that they have a drive through, which is faster. but won&apos;t be going there regularly.

This place gets a 4 from me cause if I can get chicken joy at 9 in the morning, I&apos;m set!  Their gravy is awesome too, you can smother that sauce everywhere on everything.
The staff is friendly, the furniture is cute and adorable.  The place is spacious and there are non Filipinos who come over.  I love that this place is connected to the Red Ribbon so if you&apos;re in a glutinous spree, my God check out Red Ribbon, you don&apos;t even have to go out a door you just walk to the other half of the place.
The only gripe I might have is that they are short on supplies.  My brother made a remark about, &quot;We&apos;re not in the Philippines anymore, please bring it up to American standards.&quot;
For instance:
the soda fountain was short on some soda,
there were no straws, I guess they ran out
and we each had one napkin...which reminds me of being given one ply of toilet paper instead of two.

All in all I would give them 3.75 but Yelp doesn&apos;t rate in between so I have to round up to 4.  There&apos;s still room for improvement, =)

So I was waiting for this place to open for awhile. I was excited, I love chicken and if it&apos;s fried that&apos;s even better. So I walked in to a very friendly very nice cashier, and I&apos;m not gonna lie, I really don&apos;t care about the people just as long as the food is good and quick. I was at a loss, because I couldn&apos;t choose between the strips or fried chicken, I went with the strips because you can&apos;t really mess those up right?! Right.

The strips were good, not great but good. They were a little bland but still better than KFC but not as flavorful as Popeye&apos;s. My only gripe-and this is the reason why I gave them 3 stars instead of 4 or 5- is because they nickel and dimed me for ranch. I don&apos;t mind paying for extra ranch, I actually expect it now. Yet, they gave me a tub and only filled the tub with ranch 1/5 of the way. Are you kidding me?!??!? I&apos;m sorry it&apos;s the little things that bring back customers, you can go anywhere and get chicken strips but if you&apos;re gonna charge 27 cents for ranch and then not fill the packet all the way; you have officially lost my business.

If I do go back it will be for my friends who want to try it, but I can&apos;t recommend this place simply because they didn&apos;t follow through on the little things.

I think the only thing that was good was that it tastes just like the Jollibee I ate at in the Philippines so many years back. Got the Chickenjoy with spaghetti.   And of course, I&apos;m always a sucker for fried chicken. It was pretty good as usual.

But seriously. It&apos;s damn overpriced for the portion you get. $7 or so for one drumstick and a small portion of spaghetti. I had to drink the gravy just so I wouldn&apos;t feel like it was a total waste of my cash. Did not leave very satisfied at all.

The food is Ok, specially the aloha burger.
My problem is their service.
I went thru the Drive-thru and it took 20 minutes. For fast food they sure are very slow.
I understand Filipino Time, where you&apos;re always late. but you&apos;re in the U S of A now. Your business model needs to change to reflect your customers.

How are you going to attract new customers or in my situation. How are you going to retain customers with such BAD SERVICE.

Two stars is being generous.
I&apos;ll try you again in a year or so &quot;Maybe&quot;
