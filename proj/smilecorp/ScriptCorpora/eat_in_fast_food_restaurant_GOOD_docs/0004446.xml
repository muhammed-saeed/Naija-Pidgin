She seems normal when she shows up at the FBI office in St. Louis--until she produces a tattered Raggedy Ann doll she found and tells him she thinks something is wrong because of a strange feeling of terror it gives her when she touches it. Nick dismisses her, only to stumble across a link between the doll and an abducted child, setting in motion a chain of events that uncovers startling connections--and puts Rachel&apos;s life on the line.
Filled with palpable suspense and a touch of romance, &quot;In Harm&apos;s Way&quot; is the final installment of the thrilling HEROES OF QUANTICO series.

But the third book in the series is the first I could get a hold of. So, these reviews may be a little out of order.

Rachel Sutton can’t explain the feeling of dread she experiences every time she touches a doll she found in a restaurant parking lot – but it’s real and it’s intense. Knowing she’ll be seen as crazy Rachel still feels the urge to take the doll and her feelings to the FBI.

When agent Nick Bradley listens to Rachel’s story he’s torn between thinking she is crazy and acknowledging her fear is real. Something makes him keep the doll, even though the rest of the agency thinks it’s all a crock. But the little discovery and a conniving newspaper journalist out to further her career, begins a chain of events that can’t be undone and puts Rachel in harms way.

What I Thought:

Love, Love, LOVE! – enough said.
The story is believable, despite the fact that Rachel has this odd feeling when touching a doll I found it totally realistic.
The suspense that is built up as the reader follows the main characters as well as the criminal keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Of course, the love story is great and wholesome too. (less)

Rachel Sutton has had a difficult life, but chooses to live in the present. A busy teacher of piano and a muralist, her life is busy giving her no time to ponder her loneliness.

A magnetic read that I couldn’t put down.

Rachel Sutton has had a difficult life, but chooses to live in the present. A busy teacher of piano and a muralist, her life is busy giving her no time to ponder her loneliness. An orphan when she was just an infant, she had no family to call her own so she immersed herself in her love of music and art. Her simple life changes when in an odd turn of events, she finds a Raggedy Ann doll buried in the snow. The minute she touches the doll she is overtaken by a strong current of fear. Not understanding what is happening to her, or why she’s felt anxious the last few weeks, she goes to the FBI and finds it hard to explain the terror she feels when she touches the doll. Knowing she’s made a fool of herself, she leaves, wishing she’d met the handsome FBI agent Nick Bradley under normal circumstances.

Special Agent Nick Bradley doesn’t know what to make of Rachel Sutton’s claim. She seems like a normal, intelligent woman, and even admits she doesn’t believe in ESP or paranormal activity, but her explanation regarding the affect the doll has on her has him perplexed. He too, wishes they had met somewhere away from work, because the woman with the soulful brown eyes has definitely made an impression on him.

Rachel and Nick are thrown together in a bizarre way as the doll because the focus of a kidnapping that’s trail has run cold. Trying to keep their personal feelings for each other from coming to the surface is difficult, especially when Nick feels Rachel’s life is in danger , and Rachel has trust issues that might be the wedge that keeps her and Nick apart.

I finished IN HARM’S WAY in one afternoon. Irene’s writing style is so smooth you turn page after page not even realizing the passing of time. Though I guessed the plot early, it didn’t detract from the story in the least. A great series! I’m glad Irene’s father challenged her to write mysteries, because I think suspense is definitely her strength. (less)

IN HARMS WAY is the story of FBI Special Agent Nick Bradley. He hasn&apos;t found a woman he can trust with his past until he meets Rachel Sutton. At the first meeting he is attracted to her until he finds out she&apos;s at his office because of a feeling she gets when touching an ratty old Raggedy Ann doll.

For some reason he isn&apos;t able to brush Rachel off or get her out of his thoughts and life.

I think this is the best of the three books, again all of Hannon&apos;s books stand alone as a good read. You might find yourself hunting down the previous books to read though, so you&apos;ve been warned.
Her books are engaging and have quite a bit of action in them. (less)

I&apos;ll admit it. I fell in love with this series with the first book. I found the first book, Against All Odds, during a &quot;wandering&quot; trip through the local bookstore. The book cover caught my eye, along with an endorsement by Dee Henderson - author of the O&apos;Malley series.

Let&apos;s just say, I didn&apos;t sleep much that weekend. My experience was repeated when I found book two, An Eye For An Eye, on the shelves.

So when I was given a chance to read and review book three, In Harm&apos;s Way, and interview the author, I jumped at the chance.

I think, if you like romantic suspense, and enjoy reading books that highlight federal agents, I truly think you will enjoy this book and the series.

In terms of characters, Hannon has created a trio of guys - Coop, Mark and Nick - along with their female counterparts, that you&apos;ll fall in love with.You may even find yourself unable to put the book(s) down.

On a scale of 1 to 5, I rank these books at least a 4 to a 4.5. This book (along with the other two in the series) are definitely in my &quot;read more than once&quot; pile...along with books by Dee Henderson! Who knows, Hannon&apos;s series might find its way into your &quot;keep&quot; pile as well. (less)

Not one to believe in psychics, but unable to ignore the fear that overcomes her every time she touches the doll, Rachel takes a leap of faith and delivers the toy to the local FBI office. At her wit’s end, and even though she’s convinced she’ll be mocked and dismissed as a crazy, Rachel’s sure that entrusting the doll to the FBI will allow her to move on with her life. Nick Bradley, a veteran agent, has met his share of whacky tipsters, but Rachel’s levelheadedness and apparently genuine terror raise enough questions in his mind that he’s unable to simply dispose of the filthy toy and write off Rachel’s reaction as some sort of bizarre coincidence. When the doll turns out to be the only clue in a kidnapping case gone cold, and it’s revealed that Rachel has an unexpected tie to the missing child, suddenly Nick’s intriguing tipster is the target of unwanted media attention. As the news story spreads, Rachel becomes the only threat to a kidnapper desperate to cover her tracks, and Nick must work overtime to protect Rachel, the investigation’s best lead and the only woman who’s ever invaded his heart.

I was so happy to finally read Nick’s story. The glimpses of his character in the first two books of the series marked him as an intriguing guy, and I had great fun watching Hannon turn the tables on him as he enters the spotlight and becomes the hero falling hard for a woman at the center of an investigation. Hannon writes the male point of view extremely well, and Nick is her best hero yet – a dreamy combination of toughness and sensitivity. The faith element was also well-integrated into the storyline. I loved the fact that Rachel wasn’t a stranger to the idea of God, she just didn’t see the need to cultivate a relationship with Him. Also, it was nice to see a female lead exploring faith – more often than not in CBA fiction it is the hero who learns faith in a story, so I really appreciated how Hannon shook up this formula with this novel. Also, Rachel’s reaction to the doll and how others respond to it added a unique element to the storyline.

Hannon concludes her Heroes of Quantico series with a well-plotted thriller and a spectacular romance, earning In Harm’s Way the top spot in my favorites ranking of the trilogy. Every aspect of this story clicked, working together on all levels from pacing, plotting and characterization to deliver one engaging, un-put-downable read. While I couldn’t help but favorably compare the first two Quantico books to Dee Henderson’s O’Malley series, which has long been a “gold standard” in romantic suspense in my view, this book blew past the competition. Hannon is clearly on track to lay claim to the title of “Queen of Romantic Suspense” in the CBA market. In Harm’s Way is the perfect blend of suspense, balanced with just the right touch of romance between two leads that have so much chemistry the sparks practically fly from the page. Masterfully plotted and crackling with romantic tension, In Harm’s Way delivers the goods – I can not WAIT for Hannon’s next book! (less)

Rachel Sutton is at a fast food restaurant where she spies a doll hidden beneath the icy snow. As soon as she touches it she gets this horrible &quot;vibe&quot; from it. Every time she touches the dolls she gets shaky, sweaty, and her heart races. After discussing it with her friend, Marta, Marta decides to talk to her husband, a police officer, about it. As they chat about it at a local restaurant, little do they know that a reporter is eavesdropping on the conversation. After much thought, she decides to take the doll to the FBI.

Rachel gives the bag with he doll in it and tells him what happens when she touches it.

Soon Rachel&apos;s life gets crazy. She is starting to fall for Nick! Between them will they find out what the significance of the doll is? Will Rachel survive?
This is definitely a page turner. I finished it in two days!

Now I need to go back and read the first one. If you like a little suspense mixed with light romance read this series.

Nick is a good looking agent who is really ready to follow in the footsteps of his buddies Coop and Mark and settle down into a desk job, or at least a job where he isn&apos;t alway having to transfer. He is rehabbing an old house and spends lots of time on projects in the house, but he is ready for romance and love.

Rachel Sutton, a music teacher finds a Raggedy Ann doll trapped in a snow bank from the snow plows of winter, and is distressed, dismayed and plain scared of the reactions she has when she touches this doll. Convinced she is loosing her mind, she is persuaded by the extreme reaction to take the doll to the FBI. Agent Bradley was assigned to her case, and the attraction is instant and mutual, it would seem.

An exciting story, with more twists and turns than a drunk man&apos;s path, this book will have you hooked from the first page to the last. I am sad to see this last book of the series, I have loved this series, but look forward to new projects from Irene. She has given us another 5 star Quantico story. 326 pages US $14.99 5 stars

She doesn’t quite know what the vision is about but she knows she needs to contact the authorities.

FBI Special Agent Nick Bradley has seen many things in his career. He has a good instinct about people. When he sees Rachel’s reaction to the doll, he believes she is the real deal. Together Rachel and Nick will have to race against the clock to save a little girl before it is too late.

In Harm’s Way is the third and final book in the Heroes of Quantico trilogy. It can be read and enjoyed as a stand alone novel. This book also happens to be my first introduction to author, Irene Hannon. I liked the pretense of this story line. I felt that Rachel was an interesting character. She was nice and very smart. Nick and Rachel meshed well together. While, I liked this book, I felt it was a little on the weak side. The beginning drew me in and kept me there until about the middle and then flat lined some. The ending could have been better. Overall, In Harm’s Way was a pretty good book.

On her way to her car, she sees a bright orange clump frozen in the icy snow. When her foot dislodges a chunk of ice, she finds a button eye staring up at her. Digging it out, she finds a Raggedy Ann doll, which she plans to place on the restaurant’s air conditioner so the owner might find it.

Problem is, when she held the doll, she got the shakes, a racing pulse and had difficulty breathing, much like a panic attack. The doll fell from her arms, and the episode ceased. She knew she had been tense and stressed, which she couldn’t seem to shake, with multiple sleepless nights for about a month.

Surely a doll couldn’t cause all this. To prove it wasn’t so, she picked it up again, and terror hit the pit of her stomach. Jarring, crashing sounds and a baby’s cry hit her. She opened her car door and slung the doll across the seat. The symptoms stopped, leaving her with a sense of anxiety.

Rachel told her friend Marta, who thought she was crazy and told her to dump the doll. But she couldn’t. She had to get it to the ‘right’ person, so she has Marta talk to her policeman husband. He recommended the FBI, though he thought they’d think her crazy.

Meanwhile, Claudia Burnes, a St. Louis tabloid writer, was listening in on Marta’s conversation with her husband at a restaurant and took notes. This could be her leap to the National Inquirer if she could connect this lead article of ESP or clairvoyance in crime fighting.

Rachel brings the doll in a bag to FBI Special Agent Nick Bradley, who seemingly listens to her, after seeing her reaction to the doll. He stumbles onto a link between a doll and an abducted child. His world and Rachel’s takes on a whole new realm when Claudia’s article reaches the papers. Someone wants her silenced. Why? She only found a doll. Is there a connection to the doll and the person(s) trying to silence her? Again…why?

This haunting suspense and light romance keeps you turning pages late into the night. A definite nail-biter! (less)

Nick an FBI special agent takes her statement and comes to her aid when Rachael is questioned by a tabloid reporter. The stories the reporter writes unfairly puts Rachael in the crosshairs of kidnapper who doesn&apos;t want to be caught.

This story has some wonderful twists and turns. Rachael and Nick find they have something very strong in common - this fosters a quick bond. And out of our three heroes in the Quantico series Nick is the one we learn most about his past. Nick does not keep his feelings bottled up and after some encouragement from his friend Mark Sanders he is more honest about his feelings for Rachael.

What I also loved about this story is the continuation of Mark&amp;Em and Coop&amp;Monica and their baby (which I love the name!). They are all great friends. And now that the series is over I can imagine all of them sharing their lives and creating a great family of friends. I will miss them all! (less)

Although, I am certainly going to be reading Against All Odds , book 1, and An Eye For An Eye , book 2.

I used to watch TV shows like Law and Order, NYPD Blue, and CSI. I loved all the mystery of finding out the who-dun-it&apos;s. But I am now adding Irene Hannon to my quickly growing list of authors whose suspense novels are 100% better than those shows!

From page one, In Harm&apos;s Way starts in on the fast paced suspense. I was completely captured and became a part of the story immediately. Each chapter brought with it a new twist that I was trying to work hard at guessing the what-next&apos;s! But, Irene has such talent that I found it difficult to figure the who-dun-it&apos;s until the end!

Not only did Irene create a story full of awesome suspense, she added lots of faith in God, lots of humor, and lots of friends and romance, all to keep the reader hooked. All the beautifully created charaters bring the plot together and tug at your heart. Especially Nick, whom my heart went out to the most. He just was such a loving a character and I found myself praying for him often.

So, my review concludes that this is definitely recommended with two thumbs up and high 5 star praises! But be prepared for fast paced, crime solving adventure!

Irene Hannon&apos;s voice and style is very similar to Dee Henderson in the O&apos;Malley series.

The plot of &quot;In Harm&apos;s Way&quot; was predictable for me. The number of clues given for what should be the story&apos;s big surprise made me wonder how and FBI agent could miss the truth. Even so, the novel is an enjoyable ride - - a rider can predict the ups and downs of a favorite rollercoaster ride but that doesn&apos;t take away the enjoyment. I will recommend this novel and author to my friends.

Nick Bradley&apos;s characterization was the one real disappointment with this novel. He seemed &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; almost even cliche. A wild, borderline law-breaking youth gets turned around and becomes goes into law enforcement. At one point he talks about having gotten in with the wrong bunch of kids who were into petty theft and minor drugs...I felt like Ms. Hannon copped out and didn&apos;t go the full nine yards. It would&apos;ve been a bigger deal if Nick had been picked up for some real crimes - misdemeanors would be okay but something more than petty. And not &quot;minor&quot; drugs - come right out and say &quot;smoking pot&quot; if that&apos;s what she considers minor (as opposed to, I guess, crack cocaine etc). Nick&apos;s reluctance to talk about his past is believable but at one point he definitely over reacts. The true pain in his past also felt cliche - he needed more believable walls around those memories. He gives in and talks about them too quickly - I wondered what was the point of his refusal to talk about it if he was only going to spill it all 5 minutes later. It was a lost opportunity for a real point of conflict.


Rachel Sutton is the opposite. Ms. Hannon does a superb job with Rachel. Her past, her emotions now, how she reacts to Nick, to the &quot;big surprise&quot; and to the unwanted attention of being labeled &quot;psychic&quot; all felt like a real person. Ms. Hannon paints the pictures, showing what Rachel goes through and how she reacts so that the reader feels the emotions as well.

I look forward to reading more Irene Hannon novels. This author seems like she would appeal to people who like crime fiction (TV) stories like &quot;Bones&quot; rather than something more like &quot;Southland&quot;. (less)

When it comes to novels you want to read, what is it you are looking for: fast paced action, good characters you can identify with and get emotionally invested in, maybe a good mystery with a few plot twists and turns, a good romance story thrown in, humor, a really good ending?

When it comes to novels you want to read, what is it you are looking for: fast paced action, good characters you can identify with and get emotionally invested in, maybe a good mystery with a few plot twists and turns, a good romance story thrown in, humor, a really good ending? Well I must say that the third and final installment to the Heroes of Quantico trilogy has that and much more.
Am I bummed that the series is wrapped up? Yes, without a doubt. I have been sharing the novels with my wife and it has been a blast to be able to discuss them with her. The series started with Against All Odds ( We featured it Sunday in our Blast From The Past; check our archives). Number 2 was An Eye For an Eye and that gets us to the third and final, In Harm’s Way. Hannon will be starting a new series in early 2011. I am looking forward to that, and the knowledge of it has buoyed my spirits as I have become a big fan of her style and storylines. The new series is called Guardians of Justice and the first novel is titled Fatal Judgment.
Without giving up any spoilers here is the skinny on the storyline from the jacket of the novel; “ FBI Special Agent Nick Bradley has seen his share of kooks during his fifteen years with the Bureau. But Rachel Sutton is an enigma. She seems normal when she shows up at his office- until she produces a tattered Raggedy Ann doll and tells him about a strange feeling of terror it gives her when she touches it. Nick dismisses her, only to stumble across a link between the doll and an abducted child, setting in motion a chain of events that uncovers startling connections- and puts Rachel’s life on the line.”
Irene Hannon’s final installment is the best of the series, bringing to bear all that the first two had and much more. Elements of romance, suspense, Christian beliefs, humor, and lots of action are an unusual combination. Hannon manages to pull it off and in spades. I suggest this novel for all the right reasons. She is a Goodreads author, let her know you are out there and put all three novels in your –to read- list at the very least, enjoy them and the ride along with a standup group of characters from the elite FBI Hostage Rescue Team.

Rachel Sutton is a busy woman, she plays the piano, teaches and she&apos;s not crazy...or is she? Rachel shows up at the FBI office, and seems normal...until she tells Special Agent Nick Bradley her story. She found a Raggedy Ann Doll in a parking lot and when she picks the doll up, after digging it out of the frozen snow, she gets this strange sense of terror and hears a baby crying. At first Nick dismisses her but then he stumbles on a link between the doll and the abducted baby. What he discovers is shocking!

&quot;In Harm&apos;s Way&apos; is by far my favorite book in the &apos;Heroes of Quantico&apos; series. I love how Nick is fixing up a house and that he&apos;s not your typical FBI agent. When I was reading this I was thinking if it&apos;s going to be where she is a psychic, then I won&apos;t like this book, but that was not the case. I&apos;m not going to say what happens because that would give away to much of the story.

I am so looking forward to reading &apos;Deadly Pursuit&apos; and I can hardly wait until August! This has just been such a great series and I don&apos;t want it to end...but end it did. At least there is another series that has some of the same characters. &apos;In Harm&apos;s Way&apos; held my attention and I most definitely recommend this book! (less)

This one starts quickly with a riveting prologue. The book focuses on another FBI agent, Nick Bradley, who meets with a woman who at the FBI office one Friday night. This woman is Rachel Sutton, who is bringing a Raggedy Ann doll to the FBI&apos;s attention because when she picked it up she felt intense fear. Before that scares you off, I was a little hesitant at the new age feel here too (with Rachel&apos;s &quot;bad vibes&quot;) but it was well handled with an interesting twist. All I can say is-- things are not always what they seem...You will have to read it to find out what that means! Nick and Rachel both feel an instant attraction to each other despite the odd introduction, and as they work together on issues relating to the doll a friendship develops. The conversations that they share and the time they spend together were a beautiful way to create the intimacy between them. I loved the growing confidence and trust that they have with each other. A link is found between the doll and a missing child, and Rachel&apos;s life is at risk due to her connection to the case. Nick wants to be sure that nothing happens to her.

WOW!! What a ride! This was an incredible book. It grabbed me from the beginning and moved at a good pace toward a satisfying end. It was suspenseful with some great twists along the way. It was fun to revisit the main characters from the first two books, and the hero and heroine in In Harm&apos;s Way were strongly developed by giving us interesting glimpses into their pasts. Nick is Christian and he shares that with Rachel as he reveals his history and takes her to church. The element of faith is richly woven into this intense plot with very real conversations and a life-changing decision.

I received a free copy of this book, but that in no way influenced my review. (less)

Hannon sucks us in immediately with the opening prologue. A young infant is kidnapped. Said infant owns a treasured Raggedy Ann doll, which is promptly discarded by the kidnapper. Said Raggedy Ann doll is found in a frozen patch of snow by our heroine, Rachel Sutton.

On contact the doll gives Rachel bad vibes. And she&apos;s not a believer in the paranormal. So, after mustering up some courage she brings the doll to the FBI. Thus, coincidentally meeting our lovely Special Agent Nick Bradley. Again, it&apos;s not an ideal boy-meets-girl scenario.

Nick explains how they cannot do much with the information but offers to give her a follow-up in the event something happens. Rachel, feeling she&apos;s losing her sanity, goes home and tries to forget about it.

But sadly, that is not the case. As it turns out a nosy, eager, and very weird reporter overheard Rachel&apos;s story. From there she stalks poor Rachel and publishes in a tabloid all about Rachel&apos;s &quot;psychic&quot; ability and work with the FBI....

Which draws Nick and Rachel together again to handle the situation. The two end up sharing dinner as they discuss the case and learn more about each other.

I thoroughly agree with the phrase, &quot;the plot thickens&quot; it seems very accurate to &quot;In Harm&apos;s Way&quot; and about every other Irene Hannon novel I&apos;ve read.

I will draw the line here and bring the review to a close, I don&apos;t want to spoil anyone too badly. But if you choose to read this book brace yourself for twists and unexpected turns that will keep you reading all night!

This is a series I recommend to all my friends and readers. (less)

Again, the character development and plot twists were superb. Having met Nick in the first two books, I was happy to see the character fleshed out and fully developed. Shocking experiences from his childhood were heart-rending and define his reasons for entering law enforcement and his enjoyment of remodeling houses. Rachel, a usually upbeat music teacher, has been experiencing an unexplained bout of anxiety. Her discovery of a Raggedy Ann doll in a parking lot exacerbates her feelings and she decides to take the doll to the FBI. This leads to her meeting Nick and, as I suspected, their are valid reasons for Rachel&apos;s bizarre reaction to touching the doll. Like Monica and Emily in the first two books, Rachel is abducted by the villain and is placed in a situation where she will definitely lose her life unless Nick and his partner Mark can find her in time.I like Ms. Hannon&apos;s style of using the characters from her other novels throughout the book. It can be read as a stand-alone, but it will cause readers to want to read the other two titles in the series.Another excellent suspense novel by Irene Hannon. She has edged out Terri Blackstock and Dee Henderson as my favorite suspense author. I look forward to beginning her new series in January 2011! (less)

As I am still trying to catch up on reading review books (due to lots of reading time being lost while helping my sister with her wedding), I was not able to read the first two books in Irene Hannon&apos;s Heroes of Quantico series before starting In Harm&apos;s Way. That being said--I will most definitely be borrowing them from my sister (newly married!) as soon as I get caught up, so I can see what I missed.

In Harm&apos;s Way was my first time sampling Irene Hannon&apos;s Romantic Suspense...and...I&apos;m happy to say that I absolutely loved it! I thought the entire book was fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat, what&apos;s gonna happen next entertainment. I grumbled and groaned every time I had put it down! Yes, it&apos;s that good...at least in my opinion.

As I always say, it&apos;s more difficult for me to review suspense/mystery books as I don&apos;t want to give away any surprises/twists--trust me, this book has plenty. =) If you haven&apos;t read it yet, and you enjoy a good mystery, you are in for a treat!

Rachel and Nick will quickly make a place for themselves deep in your heart. I really enjoyed getting to know them, and watching them discover one another&apos;s secrets. Rachel loves music and art; while Nick&apos;s job allows him to be somewhat more adventurous. Nick lives his life with Christ at the center, but Rachel isn&apos;t sure what she believes as far as religion goes. When they realize they had similar childhoods, their blossoming relationship moves to an even deeper level. Prepare yourself for lots of twists and turns, all of which will eventually lead you to a very exciting ending!

The focus this time is on Nick Bradley, an agent of the FBI&apos;s exclusive Hostage Rescue Team.

The book begins with a kidnapping in Chicago and a woman who does not like the old Raggedy Ann doll that the kidnapped baby enjoys. We know that the kidnapped makes it to St. Louis because that is where Rachel Sutton discovers the Raggedy Ann doll. The drama unfolds because Rachel Sutton has a highly physical and emotional reaction when she touches the doll. She is not a believer in psychic phenomenon but she is having a reaction to this doll. When she learns that the police will discount her as a kook she takes her story to the FBI and Nick Bradley. He is willing to dismiss her except he witnesses her reaction when she touches the doll.

There is a reporter for a supermarket paper that serves as a catalyst to stir up events and which forces Nick and Rachel to be in each others company thus developing their romance. As events occur and the kidnapper, Nick and Rachel are all drawn together this thriller becomes more and more exciting with the last hundred pages being an extremely wild ride. All I can say is imagine going on a roller coaster the beginning of the ride is nothing until you get to the top and experience that first drop then it is nothing but twists, turns upside down loops until the ride ends. This is what Ms. Hannon does to us as readers with this book.

In addition to the nerve-wracking suspense there is also the wonderful theme of how God uses events to bring good to an evil situation. There also is the theme of Nick&apos;s house which is mostly remodeled but it is empty much like the lives of both Nick and Rachel. I think this is Irene Hannon&apos;s best work so far and a fitting end to a wonderful series.

This is a fun read, it is a fast read, however I do not recommend starting this book late at night because it will cost you sleep as you will not want to put it down. Ms. Hannon is an excellent writer and knows how to twist your nerve endings as she tightens the suspense. While we are sad to leave these wonderful characters we look forward to Ms. Hannon&apos;s new series which will be released in January of 2011.

Like the others, I read it in an evening. It&apos;s fast-paced, thrilling and not completely predictable. Irene&apos;s gift of character repartee and conversation is again apparent. Nick is a strong Christian and Rachel, not so much, although she finds her faith renewed. A terrific conclusion to the trilogy and definitely recommended. Each book stands alone, although reading them in order does bring a extra depth of understanding.

The &quot;villain&quot; in this book reminded me a bit of the one in Book 2, An Eye for an Eye, in that both people seemed otherwise normal, except for a desperate obsession. They&apos;re not the kind of people you love to hate...you actually find yourself feeling just a teeny bit sorry for them although it does not excuse the wrong they did. If you haven&apos;t yet, go back and read the first two. I&apos;ll be looking forward to Irene Hannon&apos;s new suspense series coming out next year. (less)

The hero is the one who takes the doll.

This is NOT a paranormal story. The heroine isn&apos;t a psychic, there are no ghosts or anything like that. The mystery has several levels, and the hero and heroine do have to face down death and the bad lady. I enjoyed it. It wasn&apos;t too scary for this wimpy girl. (less)

The storyling keeps your interest and you want to read more at the end. I hope that Irene Hannon writes more books of this caliber and that they are offered in the Kindle format for public libraries. I am more apt to get the books from the library than to buy them. Excellent read!

However, when she handles it she is filled with a feeling of terror. Long debate and she turns it in to the FBI who smile and set it aside until something happens to tie it to a current case. Intersting.
