 Reviews for Willie&apos;s Grill&amp;Ice House: 5           AVERAGE OVERALL RATING Sort By: Most Recent Positive Negative Most Helpful           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 1/16/11 for the money and the food, i think it was great especially for pasadena golden acres area where you are limited to fast food. chicken and shrimp great. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By Cheryl , 1/9/10 Food had poor quality, beer was good, company was great. But the overall experience would never have me return there. I was really disappointed with the service. Heck she didn&apos;t have to take our order just deliver it to our table and keep the drinks full, which she didn&apos;t seem able to do and then you are supposed to tip her for this service. I would rather eat at a fast food restaurant! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By dustin , 11/15/09 So, why do I stop at the counter and place my order? I gave it to this lady who wrote it down and she gives me the meal ticket. I sat myself and gave that to my waitress who then gives it to the kitchen - why didn&apos;t I just get seated and have the waitress take my order? Burger and rings were tasty. They had all the doors open and I got bit by a couple of mosquitoes - too much of a price for fresh air. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING OK By A Yahoo! Contributor , 4/15/09 The setting is unique, but we found the food to be just a little better than ordinary. I really did not find it compelling enough to make it a regular stop. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING Horrible experience By Easy Eddie , 6/29/07 Our group eats out every Thursday night, usually 15 - 30 people. Food was cold (4 meals) taco salad had mystery meat that tasted like something left in the bottom of a pan for a week. (3 sent back) manager refused to come talk to the group!

They just lost our business on a regular basis!
