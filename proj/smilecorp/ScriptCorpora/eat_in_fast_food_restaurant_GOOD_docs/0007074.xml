Teppanyaki Fast Food Restaurant Ipoh Greentown
 Comments Ipoh Food This recently opened Tepanyaki restaurant serve a varieties of Japanese Tepanyaki dishes in a very simple manner at a very affordable price. 

When you talk about Japanese food, the first thing in mind would be the hefty price it came along with, especially when you enter a restaurant which is specializes in the Japanese food. You certainly not going off without paying more than RM30 per person for a moderate order. Japanese foods are expensive for good reason. The ingredients are mostly imported and there aren&apos;t many good chef which could made good authentic Japanese food around.

And one thing which bears in my mind about Japanese food is its presentation. Japanese culinary is a fine art which takes a good long time to master. From a simple plate of Sushi to a everything-in-one plate of Teppanyaki, you could see everything is very well arranged and looks very nice when served. Taste good or not, that is the next thing you need to discover.
 
Enough talk about this authentic Japanese foodstuff here. Just today, I came across this self claim fast food restaurant serving Teppanyaki dishes in Greentown, Ipoh. If Im not mistaken, this place was formerly the Kimberly Cafe which I reviewed before.

Here, you will find some less authentic Tepanyaki dishes at a very affordable price.
 
You wont find a Teppanyaki bar in the restaurant where you could see the chef prepares the Teppanyaki food right in front of the customers. It is all prepared in the kitchen and god-know-how-it-was-cooked.

It is said that this is a fast food restaurant but I didnt count how fast the food arrive upon my order but it is rather fast since we are the only customer there at the time, lol.

Looking at the menu, I could see their Teppanyaki dishes is served in several way such as Teppanyaki in tin foil, serve with either plain rice or fried rice or even Teppanyaki with Udon noodle. Price starting from RM6.90 which is really cheap.
 
I had a cup of Champagne milk shake and wifey had the guava juice. In addition, we get treated with some pineapple tart cookies. Yummy.
 
I had this Garupa Fillet Teppanyaki served with rice. Well, it was rather plain simple though. Just a bunch of bean sprout and then a few slices of fish fillet with a cup of plain rice. And the fish fillet was like baked in the oven instead of grilled on the Tepanyaki pan. If you wanted to know how this thing tastes, well, it was just so-so only lah.
You get what you pay for and it is really true in this case.
 
This is the Teppanyaki Fried Udon Cuttle Fish . There are ample of Udon noodle and cuttle fish too making it a very filling dish. The taste is rather mild and Im sure it would taste much better with a few more drops of Teriyaki and Soy sauce on it.

Serve along with the dishes is some Sambal Chilli which is kicking hot. Sambal chilli is certainly Japanese and I aint sure how they had this idea but I guess they just try to create another fusion between Japanese cuisines to our local favor.
 
Here is our local kind of Wasabi, our infamous Kampung Koh chilli sauce, hahaha! Ask you die or not.
 
The bill sum up to RM31.00 and the cashier didnt mind treating us another 2 pieces of Cloud9 Lemon Tea candy. So sweet.

Overall, the food here is just normal. Though it is below my expectation of what a Teppanyaki should be but the price explain everything.

This is a place for those who want a taste of Teppanyaki-like dishes at a less throat-cutting price.
Also Note*
Unlimited refill of hot / cold Green Tea
