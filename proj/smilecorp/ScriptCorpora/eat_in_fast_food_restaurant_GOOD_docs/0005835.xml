Restaurant Business - How To Open A Pizzeria

 By Patricia Farnham 
 
Starting a pizzeria will require you to get more equipment than a regular restaurant business. You will need specific kinds of ovens to bake pizza. Some pizzerias even have huge brick ovens. It is fun to own your own pizza place and it can be a very lucrative business as long as you serve excellent tasting pizza. Here are some guidelines to help you get started in the pizza business.

Decide on the type of pizza business you want to start. Will you want to open a simple window for take-out pizza or do you have the funds and energy to start a full service pizza restaurant business? Having a bigger place with seats and table allows you to expand your menu to serve salads, pasta and full meals. A small take-out window or pizza kiosk is ideal for smaller budgets and for those who don&apos;t want too much work.

Before opening a restaurant business, you should decide on focusing on cuisine you are familiar with. It is better to know how to cook even if you won&apos;t be doing the cooking every day. Knowledge about the food business will give you an edge over the competition. For example, if you don&apos;t know how to make pizza dough and your pizza maker skips work, your business may suffer for that day because no one can make the pizza crust. Placing the toppings and cheese is easy and all you have to do is stick it in the oven.

Create a business plan for your pizza parlor. This will help you keep focused and provide guidelines for you to follow. It is easy to get distracted and forget things in the midst of the chaos of starting a restaurant business. Your business plan should cover marketing, profit and loss, budget, and expansion among other things. A business plan can also come in handy if and when you need to borrow money for capital.

Estimate the amount of money you need to start a pizzeria. Add the expenses for rent, construction, the first batch of supplies and ingredients, wage, advertising, your furniture, equipment and pizza ovens. If you find that the total amount is more than you can afford, that&apos;s the time to go to a lending firm or bank to borrow money for your capital. By this time, you should have that business plan finished so you can give it to your lenders.

To be able to know how much money you need for equipment purchases, make a list. If you will cater to the high-end market, you might want to install a brick oven. That will add to the costs but will also attract more customers. A pizzeria needs additional equipment and appliances like pizza pans, heavy-duty pizza ovens, dough mixer and a rolling machine.

Location is a big factor for any restaurant business. For a pizzeria, you will also have to consider what type of pizza you will serve before deciding on the location. If you want to serve gourmet pizza, you should be located in an upscale neighborhood or in a business center. If you are just starting with a pizza kiosk or take-out window, a mall would be a good place to start.

Make a lot of noise before you open your pizzeria. Send out press releases to your local newspaper and print some fliers that you can distribute around town. Offer tasting events at various local events and at the mall and universities. Talk to other restaurant business owners about boosting your marketing. Marketing is what&apos;s going to make your pizzeria popular and profitable aside from serving excellent tasting pizza.
