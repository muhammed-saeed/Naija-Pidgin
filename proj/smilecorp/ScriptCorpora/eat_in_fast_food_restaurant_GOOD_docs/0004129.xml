 June 25, 2012 Wonderful by Lacy ( 1 review ) Florentine pizza, fried calamari, bruschetta, tomato and mozerella salad, antipasto salad, meatballs. -
Honestly I&apos;m not sure what the other reviews are talking about saying that Trattoria has bad service becasue mine was great (right along with the food)! I came in this afternoon for lunch with my mom and a couple of friends and the food was absolutley amazing! The portions were massive too, you certainly get your money&apos;s worth! The young man who served our table was friendly and provided us with excellent service even though our order was huge and he seemed to be the only waiter there that day. Overall, I&apos;d certainly reccomend this place to anyone. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful March 31, 2012 the owners by Sara ( 3 reviews ) i dont know who gave the class on management but between the 2 owners theres no management whatsoever it would be a excellent place to dine, except for the bickering amongst owners and employees its not a place to bring your family and the service lately has become very poor i dont know if they fired people there cuz there is new faces except a few they had a very great crew our advice tio you bring your crew back they were plesent and very friendly they will lose alot of customers and with the season approaching they need to really think twice. +2 more review from Sara October 23, 2011 Mobile review Awesome wait staff and greatfood November 23, 2011 dining at trattorias our family dined there plenty of times and everytime we dine in there is always bickering amongst the owners. the gentleman sal is always scolding his help the waitresses r very busy and give us the utmost service they do alot of work for these nj people if it wasnt for the help they have on the floor and kitchen they would have no restaurant hats off to the help. the owners should be a lot more respectful and appreciate their enployees..... March 23, 2012 Mobile review by Zach Rubemeyer ( 2 reviews ) Horrible customer service. Been there twice no and I will NEVER go back again. I tried calling them for an hour and a half trying I figure out what time they close but the phone was off the hook the entire time. We got there 2 minutes past &apos;their clock&apos;s closing time&apos; and they refused to let us carry out. I&apos;ve listened tithe owner complaine about people not tipping enough after saying the waitress was rude to them. April 24, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Lynne Sanders Pridgen ( 31 reviews ) I had such high hopes for this restaurant after hearing so many good things but I was in for a let down. We got there at about 440pm on a Friday night and other than someone waiting to pick up a pizza we had the place to ourselves. Knowing this should have made for hot food and good service. He ordered baked ziti that was so cold he sent it back. And the time it came back it was still cold. My husband said it seemed as if they heated it in the microwave because there were hot/cold spots like you&apos;d get if you nuked it. I had the 7&quot;super steak sub. The only thing hot on it was the bread. Not sure how just the bread could be hot and not the steak. My husband made a comment how he hates when a server won&apos;t look you in the eye. I felt like we were putting them out. The best part was the free Tiramisu the waitress gave us because she felt bad. Oh, and the pod of dolphins we saw after we ate was a neat treat too! Maybe their pizzas are really good. Not sure we&apos;ll ever give them another chance though. Piasanos in Jacksonville is much better. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful September 5, 2010 Likes it BEWARE Sanitation Grade 85!!! by kimmypoo ( 28 reviews ) Check out the sanitation grade for this restaurant. Many repeat offences! Go to JDNEWS dot com, go to bottom of the page for&quot;Restaurant Sanitation Scores&quot;. Both food and wait staff is inconsistent. Last time we ate there the owner spent the entire time bitching at the people in the kitchen and waiters. It made our evening very UNenjoyable. Salad is usually great. Pasta sauce is sometimes soupy, sometimes delicious. Very crowded. They go through waiters it seems like weekly. I&apos;ve not been back since. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful July 4, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Julie ( 20 reviews ) The food is fantastic but order it to go and skip the mediocre service. December 11, 2010 Good food - Horrible inconsistant service by Walter Kitt ( 5 reviews ) I agree with the poster as to the inconsistent service. My mother lives in Swansboro&amp;I have eaten their food regularly since they opened. I was even a patron of the owner&apos;s restaurant in NJ. Although I really enjoy his food, I have resorted strictly to getting it to go. I have no problem waiting for good food, but he last four times I dined in were a total mad house with orders constantly wrong&amp;no one to take charge of the people waiting. The sweet elderly lady that works there to seat(?) just seemed to walk around in a daze&amp;make things worse. To the person that works there that posted that the owner should yell at the employee&apos;s. Sweety, you don&apos;t yell at your help in front of the patrons... i hope you don&apos;t ever run a restaurant. My last&amp;final visit. I recently took my 79 year old mother there for dinner&amp;the owner took us to the only open table in the corner which was dirty.

It&apos;s not the food, it&apos;s everything but the food. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful February 14, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Glenn ( 1 review ) Terrible service. One of the waitresses was loud and obnoxious. We called in reservations and when we arrived were told there would be a twenty minute wait. We decided to order the food to go and if a table opened before the food was done we would stay. We waited another 40 minutes before we were seated. When we sat down we told the waitress that we ordered the food to go. She said she would check on it. We then Waite another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. I know that I should have left but I really had to see this one to the end. On a Plus side when the food did finally arrive it was very good. I do not live far from this restaurant and have eaten here before. I am now reminded why I have not returned. I would only recommend this place for take out. July 26, 2010 Authentic by Erynne Hood Messina ( 8 reviews ) I am astounded by the negative reviews. The food is absolutely amazing and I have never had bad service. The restaurant is small which lends itself to the authentic, real Italian cooking feel of it. And as far as a wait, well, it&apos;s NOT fast food! It&apos;s real food. The dough and breads are made fresh every day on site! So go if you want a truly authentic meal and have the time to enjoy it! P.S. I&apos;m shocked about the owner yelling at customers! Our order took overly long one evening and we were offered a free bottle of wine while we waited! January 21, 2012 Mobile review by Kelley ( 2 reviews ) The Pasta dishes we had were very good, but the dining room is too small. It isn&apos;t a very nice atmosphere, and my table was asked to leave after our plates were taken so they could seat someone else. We were there for about 45 minutes and will not return because we were rushed out once we finished eating. August 19, 2011 Mobile review by james von prague ( 2 reviews ) The food takes a while but its worth it. The stromboli was HUGE and the desserts are soooo good. Not to mention I love a large peter. +1 more review from james von prague February 13, 2011 Mobile review Wonderful pizza!! It took a while, but it was well worth the wait. The tiramisu was the best I&apos;ve ever had. September 24, 2009 Likes it Great Italian! by Jen ( 7 reviews ) Great place for lunch or dinner! Everything is made to order! July 23, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Coastalkate ( 4 reviews ) Great pizza! I am surprised by the negative reviews. We enjoy the Tratt and consider it to be the best casual Italian restaurant in the area. We go during off hours and are seated immediately. Our server was pleasant and attentive. We were promptly served warm bread with garlic infused dipping oil. We ordered the special pizza which was served in a timely manner and was topped with a nice array of red, green, orange and yellow peppers. See picture! We have not been disappointed and look forward to a return visit. March 24, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Sara Johnson ( 2 reviews ) We love the food here!! Never again will we order take out italian anywhere else in the area!! April 4, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Deb galli ( 3 reviews ) Very disappointed. Made reservations. After waiting 10 minutes with tables available was told would be another 20 food looked good August 11, 2009 Likes it Mobile review by Jason Gwinn ( 2 reviews ) You can get lunch for two for under $20 and it tasts great. Only problem, they turned off their air conditioning. June 27, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Horrible! by Susan ( 1 review ) Five of us had dinner at Trattoria on June 25th. After ordering, it took over an hour before we were served. The waitress didn&apos;t bring the food I ordered and then argued with me and insisted I had not ordered pasta with my meal. My four dinner companions told her I DID order the pasta. She huffed away and 20 minutes later finally brought the pasta. I had veal parmigani, and it was so tough I couldn&apos;t even cut it. I sent it back. The waitress told us the cooks were mad at her. I ate very little of my dinner because it was inedible. They reduced our bill by only 10%. We were nice and tipped the waitress well, in spite of bad service. After we got in the car, which was parked right in front of the restaurant, the old lady who owns the restaurant came out on the porch and yelled at us&quot;Good night you ignorant young people! You are not welcome to come back here!&quot;We were stunned and could hardly believe what we had experienced. Trattoria is the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. July 29, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it by New yorker ( 1 review ) Sorry, this pizza was soggy and had a thin crust. Sicilian pizza should have crust about an inch thick and have a crunch to it. April 4, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Maria ( 1 review ) Disappointing. Had a reservation which was not honored. Basically ignored by staff. May 18, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Dreadful by Liz ( 1 review ) I am a local to Swansboro and often eat at the restaurants. I gave Trattoria a chance about 4 months ago. The food was mediocre and the service was the (by far) the worst I had ever experienced. Thinking that they just had a bad night, I went back again on the 17th of May. The service and food were worse than the first time. It took 15 minutes to even get someone to take a drink order and it took 45 minutes to get our food. I work in a shop and have many tourists ask for places to eat. Trattoria will only be said for worst place to eat. I will send them to a fast food restaurant before I send anyone here.
