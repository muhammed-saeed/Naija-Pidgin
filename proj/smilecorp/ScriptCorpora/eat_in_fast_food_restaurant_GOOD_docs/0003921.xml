 The best and worst paid jobs in the world 
 
What do a pole dancer and an airline pilot have in common? Well they both make a living from whizzing around in the air but that’s pretty much where the similarities end. In fact, the connection between the two is that they roughly take home the same pay each year. That may seem surprising to many considering the training, cost and responsibility an airline pilot has to shoulder in order to fly planes but perhaps it’s more of a reflection of how much money there in the sex industry.

And it’s not the only surprising comparison when you look at the pay scales for many of the nation’s workers. Real life James Bonds’ or MI5 agents earn roughly the same as refuge collectors or electricians. Paramedics and nurses often work longer hours and earn less than a manager at Starbucks. Even the current British Prime Minister, David Cameron, only takes home in one year roughly the same pay as footballer, David Beckham, makes in one week.

Of course not everyone works to earn money, spiritual leaders often earn less than the average wage despite hours of public speaking and fund raising duties. Muslim imams’ earn between $7,500(£5,000) and $22,500(£15,000) per year while Jewish rabbis and Church of England clergy get slightly more at $30,000(£20,000) per year.

At the opposite end of the spectrum both in terms of pay and lifestyle are city workers and banking staff, the average worker at Goldman Sachs scooped a pay package of $430,000 (£269,000) in 2010.
