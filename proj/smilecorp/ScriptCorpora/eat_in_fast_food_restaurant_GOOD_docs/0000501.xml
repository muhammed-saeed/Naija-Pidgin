		F4   Fast Fresh Fun Flavor 

 &quot;Healthy Choices Fast Food&quot; 

 
 

 Welcome to F4,
 the only way to eat fast and still eat healthy. F4 provides the tastiest, high quality whole-food options in fast,
 easy to eat on the go servings. The restaurant was built off of my own desire to loose weight. I created a great
 menu of tasty healthy choice options for people on the go. Scroll down and  Read My Story  to
 find out about my story and how I lost over 80 pounds eating this way and have kept it off for years.  My
 secret is not constricting yourself to eating&quot;diet&quot;food, but eating regular food that&apos;s fun, flavorful, high
 quality and great tasting. 

 F4 was named for the four F&apos;s that are the
 foundation of my restaurant.   

 Fast  - F4
 is especially made for people on the go that want to eat healthier but don&apos;t think they have the time or the ingredients
 or don&apos;t want to sacrifice taste.  

 Fresh  -
 Just because its made fast doesn&apos;t mean you have to sacrifice freshness. My food is made from whole food ingredients
 and prepared the same day; Ingredients like chicken breast, steak, onions, peppers, whole-grain wraps, fresh vegetables, pure
 extra virgin olive oil, etc. 

 Fun  - I love to eat,
 (and that&apos;s what used to get me in trouble) and I think that people should enjoy their eating experiences even if its
 on the go. That&apos;s why I made sure that every bite you take is a fun adventure that excites your tongue, and
 that our staff is both joyful and helpful. 

 Flavor - Every meal item is guaranteed to be filled with flavor. You have many choices of the flavors to choose from, both
 in the preparation of the food and in the dipping sauces you choose. Who says eating healthy has to taste bland! 

 
 My
 free-standing drive-thru restaurant will be opening soon in the Atlanta Metro area (Yes, I said drive-thru.... My first F is Fast!)  In the mean time, contact me for catering options,
 and I can bring the flavor to you!  I t would be my pleasure to provide you with healthier food options. Whether you are interested in weight loss or you are just trying to live a healthier lifestyle or you just love the taste
 of fresh flavorful food, I can be of service to you.

 My Story 
 Someone had
 told me I was overweight when I was in the 8 th grade, but I didn’t quite believe them.   Maybe
 if I would have taken notice of the fact that every year I was getting bigger and bigger, I could have stopped the process
 earlier.   I found myself in college weighing 205 at 5’4”.   I had told myself
 I would never get over 200 pounds.   So now I was telling myself that as soon as I get out of college and
 have“more time”, I was going to loose the weight.   I stayed like this for years and for a while
 just settled myself into thinking that I was just going to be a big girl.   The change came when I made a
 decision to try to find a diet that worked for me and was something I could do for the rest of my life.   This
 meant that my diet had to be easy, fast, and financially feasible.   

 Part of my success came from doing
 a low-carb diet and part of my success came from doing a low calorie diet.   I cannot say which one is better,
 all I know is that I worked both philosophies until I found something that worked for me.   The first diet
 was from a book that gave lots of recipes with expensive sugar substitutes and rare cooking ingredients.   I
 decided that I was going to use the principles of the diet, but not the recipes.   I decided that I would
 just forgo the carbs or replace them with something else.   At that time I was a Mechanical Engineer, living
 in Los Angeles.   I spent a lot of time in traffic (hours, at least 3 to be exact) and I was working on a
 very time consuming project.   So I decided that what ever I did had to be fast and easy.   For
 dinner, I didn’t want to wait for hours after I had gotten home to eat, so I perfected making fast meals.   Then I began making enough so I could take the meals to work the next day.   So, two meals were taken
 up by my fast cooking, so I was happy for a while.   During this time I also ate out a lot, but I was used
 to either ordering things low-carb style, or I simply replaced the carb for a vegetable. 

 The trouble came when I decided
 to move and drove from Los Angeles back to my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio by way of Atlanta, Georgia.   All
 the way on my cross the country drive, I had no options of anywhere to eat that would allow me to eat low-carb and by that
 time I was kind of sick of eating that way anyway.   So, even when I got to Cleveland, I decided that I would
 start trying to incorporate carbs in my diet and see how I did.   Besides, Cleveland didn’t have nearly
 as many healthy, fresh-food places to eat as Los Angeles did, so I thought I was better off settling for some carbs.   I don’t know if this is a medical fact or not, but I think carbs are addictive.   I was not
 able to really moderate how much I ate so I then gained about 20 of the 50 pounds I had lost back.   And
 even when I would try to go back to my low-carb life, it was much harder than before.   

 I later moved to Atlanta,
 Georgia and after about two years, finally got back in the swing of eating healthy again.   I began to incorporate
 carbs into my diet, but not like crazy, as long as my calorie intake did not go over a certain margin (which I decided on
 based on how much weight I wanted to loose or maintain).   I was now a teacher and was very busy all the
 time.   I would get home late, and that was on nights that I came strait home.   I was very
 active in my church which was all the way on the other side of town.   So again, no matter what I did, it
 had to be quick, easy, and convenient.   I began preparing meals again that were now with less carbs and
 were low in calories but were still easy to make.   They were meals that I could take with me to school and
 even that I could eat on the road on my long trip from school to church. 

 I am not saying that any of these diets or ways that
 I lost weight are the solutions, but what I am saying is that I know that I would not have been able to do anything if it
 weren’t for the fact that I forced myself to find ways of making healthy eating convenient for my life style.   That is what I purpose to do for the rest of the public.   I want to provide an easier, more convenient
 way of eating healthy.   Of my analysis of the options people have to be healthy if they want to eat fast
 food, I see two different things.   The first is the not-so-healthy restaurants who are now serving more
 healthy options to keep up with the market.   The only problem with that is that most of the options are
 not fresh and are filled with preservatives.   These companies are used to selling things pre-packaged to
 keep costs down, so they have now just included their“healthy”things in their shipments.   The
 second option people have to eat healthy, but fast, is the“fresh”places.   These are places
 that serve sandwiches, wraps, burritos, etc. that only use the freshest, healthiest ingredients.   The only
 problem with this is that most of these places you have to go into the restaurant, stand in line and pick out all your topics
 (which I do love, when I have the time).   These options are still better than the places that don’t
 serve any healthy options at all or the sit down places which are not fast at all.   

 When I am having one
 of those days when I am on the road all day and it would be inefficient to drive home just to get a healthy meal, I don’t
 want these things to be my only option.   I want to be able to pull over and order a healthy meal that can
 be served to me in minutes.   I want to be able to eat it while driving or stop for a minute and eat it without
 having to worry about how messy it is or have to assemble a lot of things.   My restaurant will be the solution
 to this problem.   This will be a chain of restaurants where people can get off the interstate and have a
 healthy alternative to the traditional three or four fast food restaurants that you can find anywhere.   I
 want people who have no time to go home between work and whatever event they are doing that evening to have somewhere to stop
 and get a bite to eat without messing up their diet.   I want moms and dads to be able to pick their children
 from school and have another alternative of where to take them than the traditional drive-thru. I want to help everyone
 who wants to live a healthier life be successful at it. Take a look at my before and after pictures to see how successful I&apos;ve been eating this way.
