 YORK 
 
York is located at the &quot;Crossroads of the Midwest&quot; , exit 353 at the crossing of Interstate 80 and Highway 81, located 50 miles west of Nebraska&apos;s state capitol of Lincoln. Almost every fast-food restaurant is located at this junction of I-80 and US 81, one of Nebraska&apos;s busiest crossroads. For the traveler with extra time, and an appetite for home-style cooking,

Lake , a 50 surface-acre lake with 310 acre feet of storage on a tributary of Beaver Creek . A boat ramp is located on the east side of the lake. 

 York&apos;s Trail System - setup was one of the first of its kind in the nation to be designed with hard surface hike and bike trails. York County offers three golf courses, numerous tennis courts, swimming pools and parks.
 
SIGHTSEEING - Lee&apos;s Legendary Marbles - Lee Batterton started his collection of marbles over 30-years ago when he was traveling across the country working on grain elevators. Stopping at antique stores and flea markets picking up marbles as a hobby turned into serious collecting about 10-years ago when he started buying other peoples collections to add to his own. Inside the museum marbles are displayed in glass cases, hundreds of quart jars are filled to the brim, vases, glass containers and trays. Among the more unusual are ones containing copper and pre World War I marbles containing uranium that have a eerie glow under black light. Please call ahead for hours 402-362-3320 (see ad).
