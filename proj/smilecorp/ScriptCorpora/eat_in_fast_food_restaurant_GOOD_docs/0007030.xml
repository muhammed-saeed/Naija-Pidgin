EDMONDS, P. J.

 Plaintiffs appeal and defendants, Lane County and its lessees, cross-appeal
from the trial court&apos;s judgment in this declaratory judgment proceeding. ORS 28.010 -
ORS 28.160. The trial court rendered a judgment for defendants, declaring that a deed
restriction is not enforceable against the county&apos;s property. Also, the trial court held that
plaintiffs&apos; use of a driveway across the county&apos;s property was subject to an implied
dedication for public use, and it therefore refused to enjoin plaintiffs&apos; existing use. We
review de novo , ORS 19.415(3) (2001). (1) We affirm on both appeal and cross-appeal.

The dispute in this case involves land that is adjacent to the intersection of
Marcola Road and Mohawk Boulevard, which is now part of the urban area of Lane
County. For the purposes of this opinion, we will refer to the land in dispute as Tax Lot
500. If the intersection of the two streets is understood as forming quadrants, the county&apos;s
land lies in the southeastern quadrant in its most northwesterly portion. Plaintiffs&apos; land
adjoins the county&apos;s land to the south and the east. The following map, taken from an
exhibit in the record and enhanced with identifying markers, illustrates the parcels at
issue.

 In 1946, Morris and the Chases, the joint owners of Tax Lot 500 and the
abutting land to the south and east, sold to Lane County: &quot;All that portion of an 80 foot
right-of-way&quot; located at the northwest corner of the Chases&apos; property. We will refer to
that land as the &quot;1946 right of way.&quot; In 1951, the Chases, who had previously acquired
Morris&apos;s interest, sold property to the Hendersons on both sides of the 1946 right of way,
excepting what was sold from the part of Tax Lot 500 that had been sold previously to the
county. That meant that the right of way intersected Henderson&apos;s property, roughly in the
middle of the northwest portion of it. For some years thereafter, the Hendersons resided
on the property that they had purchased from Chase. (2) 

In 1952, an event crucial to the resolution of this case occurred. The
Hendersons conveyed by deed to Lane County a portion of Tax Lot 500 that described
property on both sides of the 1946 right of way. After describing the land conveyed, the
deed provides:
 
&quot;Except that tract of land conveyed to Lane County for road
purposes, described in Volume 32, Page 601, Lane County, Oregon, Deed
Records, and excepting right-of-way of Mohawk County Road.

&quot;Land conveyed by this deed is .9 Acres, which is hereby made
subject to the restriction that no building shall ever be erected thereon.&quot;
 
 We will refer to that conveyance in this opinion as the &quot;1952 conveyance.&quot; According to
the record, in later years, when Mr. Henderson discussed the purpose of the restriction in
the deed to the county, he explained that, because he lived on the property, &quot;he didn&apos;t
want a building next to him.&quot; (3) 

 As the years passed, the surrounding area became urban in nature rather
than rural. Plaintiffs or their predecessors in interest constructed a 110-unit apartment
complex, a 66-room motel, and a restaurant on the property that is immediately adjacent
to the property owned by the county on Tax Lots 701 and 702. In 1971, the county
relocated Marcola Road. By 1972, additional motel units were added and apartments
built on property to the east and southeast on Tax Lot 700. (4) In 1972, a second event
crucial to the resolution of this case occurred. The Lane County Board of Commissioners
vacated the 1946 right of way. It also vacated a portion of the roadway that the county
had constructed and that was on a portion of the land conveyed to the county by the
Hendersons in 1952 because those areas were no longer being used as part of the existing
roadway.

In November 2000, and after Mr. Henderson died, his wife and his heirs
sold all the remaining land they owned in Tax Lot 500 to RealVest, one of the plaintiffs. 
Presently, the property to the north and west of Tax Lot 500 across the roadways includes 
a convenience store, pizza parlor, and a neighborhood market place with a large grocery
store, a fast food restaurant, and several smaller stores. All of the property immediately
surrounding Tax Lot 500 is zoned commercial. Mohawk Boulevard, also known as 19th
Street, is a two-way, four-lane arterial with a center turn lane, curbs, gutters, and
sidewalks. Likewise, Marcola Road is now a two-way, two-lane arterial with a center
turn lane, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.

Those facts frame the present dispute between the parties. In their
complaint, plaintiffs seek a declaration that all of the county&apos;s property is subject to the
restriction against building contained in the 1952 conveyance and that, as successors in
interest to Hendersons, they are entitled to enforce the restriction against the county. 
With knowledge of a dispute over the enforcement of the building restriction, Sooys
entered into a lease with the county for the county&apos;s remaining property in Tax Lot 500.
Sooys intervened in the trial court proceedings, and they participate in this appeal as
respondents and cross-appellants. The county and Sooys contend that the restriction is no
longer enforceable. In addition, the county seeks to enjoin plaintiffs from trespassing on
their property by the use of the driveway that leads from plaintiffs&apos; apartment across the
county&apos;s property to Marcola Road.

The trial court made findings of facts and reached the following conclusions
of law:
 
&quot;1.The effect of the change upon the restricted Lane County property is
such as to clearly neutralize the benefits of the restrictions to the point of
defeating the object and purpose of the covenant.

&quot;2.The restrictive covenant is of no substantial value to Plaintiffs&apos;
property.

&quot;3.Enforcement of the restrictive covenant would be inequitable, unjust
and a useless burden upon Lane County and Lessors.

&quot;4.Plaintiffs are presently using portions of the Lane County property
for a driveway without Lane County or Lessor&apos;s explicit authorization and
consent. However, since the evidence establishes an implied dedication of
the driveway to public use, Plaintiffs should not be enjoined from
continuing use of the subject driveway without the County formally
vacating the implied easement created by that public use.&quot;
 
The trial court denied &quot;as moot&quot; plaintiffs&apos; request for a judgment declaring that the
disputed county property is subject to a deed restriction enforceable by plaintiffs. It
declared that the restriction in the 1952 deed was not enforceable against the property that
Lane County obtained in that deed. It also declared that judgment be entered in favor of
plaintiffs and against defendants on defendants&apos; trespass claim.

On appeal, plaintiffs make two assignments of error: (1) &quot;[t]he trial court
erred in holding that the deed restriction no longer provides any value to RealVest
Property&quot;; and (2) &quot;[t]he trial court erred in failing to rule on Plaintiffs&apos; claim for relief
and to hold that the deed restriction encumbers all of [Tax Lot] 500, including the &apos;80 foot
right of way.&apos;&quot; We consider both assignments together because they are interrelated. The
starting point in our analysis concerns the ownership of the various portions of Tax Lot
500. Two questions need to be answered before addressing the present import of the
1952, deed restriction on building: What interest in land was conveyed to Lane County in
1946 and 1952 and who owns the land vacated by Lane County in 1972?

Our goal in interpreting a writing, including a deed conveying property, is
to determine the parties&apos; intent. See Tipperman v. Tsiatsos , 327 Or 539, 544-45, 964 P2d
1015 (1998) (construing an instrument that created an interest in land); Yogman v.
Parrott , 325 Or 358, 361, 937 P2d 1019 (1997) (construing a contract). We do that by
looking first to the language of the instrument itself and considering its text in the context
of the document as a whole. If the text&apos;s meaning is unambiguous, the analysis ends, and
we interpret the provision&apos;s meaning as a matter of law. Yogman , 325 Or at 361. If a
provision is ambiguous--that is, if it has no definite meaning or is capable of more than
one reasonable interpretation--we will examine relevant surrounding circumstances or
extrinsic evidence of the contracting parties&apos; intent. Tipperman , 327 Or at 544-45; Yogman , 325 Or at 363-64. Finally, if an ambiguity remains, we may resolve the
contract&apos;s meaning by resort to applicable maxims of construction. Yogman , 325 Or at
364-65.

With the above principles in mind, we turn to the terms of the 1946 deed. 
For the listed consideration of one dollar, the 1946 warranty deed from Morris and the
Chases &quot;does hereby grant, bargain, sell and convey&quot; to Lane County &quot;all the following
real property * * * described as follows, to wit: All that portion of an 80 foot right-of-way * * *. To Have and to Hold, the above described and granted premises unto the said
Lane County * * *.&quot; (Emphasis added.) Plaintiffs argue that the 1946 deed conveyed
only a public easement to the county, focusing on the words &quot;right-of-way&quot; in the
instrument. Consequently, according to plaintiffs&apos; argument, the Chases retained the fee
interest in the land subject to the easement conveyed to the county in 1946 and, when the
Hendersons conveyed the fee interest in that area that they had purchased from the Chases
to the county in 1952, that conveyance, containing the restriction on building, operated to
impose the restriction on all the property purchased by the county, including the easement
area previously conveyed in 1946. It follows then under plaintiffs&apos; argument that all of
the land owned by the county in Tax Lot 500 is subject to the restriction on building.

In support of their argument, plaintiffs point out that the words &quot;right of
way&quot; are terms of art, relying on the holding in Cappelli v. Justice , 262 Or 120, 496 P2d
209 (1972). In Cappelli , the court had before it a suit to quiet title in a 30-foot strip of
land running between properties owned by private owners. 262 Or at 121-22. In the
context of determining the intent of the parties and construing the language of the deed,
the court explained:
 
&quot;The deed purports to convey only &apos;A right of way 30 feet in width * * *.&apos; 
In common parlance the term &apos;right of way&apos; signifies an easement. In the
absence of special circumstances indicating a contrary meaning, the courts
have generally construed the term in accordance with common usage.&quot;
 
 Id. at 128-29 (omission in original). While we agree with the assertion that the term
&quot;right of way&quot; generally signifies the grant only of an easement interest and not a fee
interest, each case must be decided on its own facts, and we are bound by the principles
expressed above to determine the intent of the parties in this case regarding the 1946
deed.

 The 1946 deed from Morris and Chases to Lane County is a deed from
private property owners to a public body, in contrasted to a conveyance between private
citizens. The deed uses inclusive language; it conveys &quot;all the following real property[,]&quot;
and it defines that property as &quot;[a]ll that portion of an 80 foot right of way.&quot; 
Significantly, it does not use the word &quot;easement,&quot; nor does it otherwise purport to limit
the nature of the estate being conveyed, with the possible exception of the use of the
words &quot;right of way.&quot; The nature of an easement is that the fee interest in the land over
which the easement runs remains with the owner of the land, thus enabling both the
holder of the easement and the fee owner to use the land consistently with the enjoyment
of the easement. Thus, the grant of a &quot;right of way&quot; across private property from one
private property owner to another suggests the grant of an easement. In contrast, the
conveyance of privately-owned property to a public body for a public &quot;right of way&quot; is
inconsistent with the understanding that the grantor retains some privately held right to
use the conveyed property after the conveyance occurs. In general, the use left to such a
grantor is to use the conveyed property as a member of the public. While it is accurate
that the conveyance represented by the 1946 deed is of a narrow strip of land, and the
conveying instrument refers to it as a &quot;right of way,&quot; the language of the deed as a whole
indicates that it is more likely that the words &quot;right of way&quot; are surplusage and refer to the
purpose for which the land conveyed will be used by the grantee (5) rather than as a
limitation by the grantor on the nature of the estate conveyed. Plaintiffs counter that the
consideration of a dollar in the 1946 deed also supports the interpretation that the grant is
an easement rather than a fee interest, but there is no evidence that one dollar was the true
consideration. (6) Thus, ultimately, we are persuaded that the parties to the 1946 deed
intended the county to receive the 80-foot strip in fee. It follows that the restriction
against building in the 1952 deed is not applicable to the area conveyed to the county in
1946.

Our ruling leaves us to determine the validity of the restriction in the 1952
deed as it applies to the area that was conveyed in 1952. The parties apparently agree that
the 1952 deed conveyed a fee estate to Lane County, and we agree. We pause, however,
to consider the effect of the county&apos;s 1972 vacation order before considering the present
enforceability of the restriction against building. ORS 271.140 (1971), amended by Or
Laws 1981, ch 153,§58, provided, in relevant part:
 
&quot;The title to the street or other public area vacated shall attach to the lands
bordering on such area in equal portions: except that where the area has
been originally dedicated by different persons and the fee title to such area
has not been otherwise disposed of, original boundary lines shall be adhered
to and the street area which lies on each side of such boundary line shall
attach to the abutting property on such side.&quot;
 
Because under either the 1946 deed or the 1952 deed Lane County owned the fee interest
in the land over which the public way existed, the operation of the statute triggered by the
county&apos;s vacation of the public way did not change the ownership of the land. Rather, the
effect of the vacation was to eliminate the public way over the land while retaining the
county&apos;s ownership of the land. 

We turn now to the issue of the continuing enforceability of the restriction
against building on defendants&apos; property. In general, Oregon courts will enforce a
restriction against building on one&apos;s own property &quot;unless the effect of the change on the
restricted area is such as to &apos;clearly neutralize the benefits of the restrictions to the point
of defeating the object and purpose of the covenant.&apos;&quot; Albino v. Pacific First Fed. S&amp;L ,
257 Or 473, 479, 479 P2d 760 (1971) (quoting Ludgate v. Somerville, 121 Or 643, 651,
256 P 1043 (1927)). The Albino court explained:
 
&quot;[I]t is not sufficient that there have been changes outside the restricted
area, unless there have also been changes in the area itself, nor is it
sufficient that, as a result of changes outside the area, the property within a
restricted residential area may be more valuable for business purposes.&quot;
 
 Id. 

Here, the record shows that Hendersons lived in a rural area at the time that
they imposed the restriction against building on the property that they conveyed to the
county. They had a barn for livestock and raised chickens. Mr. Henderson said that,
because he lived on the property, &quot;he didn&apos;t want a building next to him.&quot; We deduce
from the record that Hendersons were attempting by the imposition of the restriction to
protect the rural environment in which they lived, understanding that development of the
county&apos;s property to include the construction of a building would interfere with those
desires. Plaintiffs, owners of apartment buildings and other commercial establishments
on adjoining lands, cannot credibly assert that they share Hendersons&apos; intentions. In fact,
the changes since 1952 in the area surrounding the county&apos;s property, including plaintiffs&apos;
own developments, have substantially changed the character of the area from rural to
urban. Those changes have substantially neutralized any benefit the restrictive covenant
could have as originally intended, and its object and purpose have been defeated by the
development that has occurred since 1952. We conclude therefore that the trial court did
not err in denying plaintiffs their requested relief.

 We turn now to defendants&apos; cross-appeal. Regarding a driveway from
plaintiffs&apos; apartments that crosses over the county&apos;s property to connect with Marcola
Road, the trial court held that &quot;the evidence establishes an implied dedication of the
driveway to public use.&quot; As a result, the court refused to enjoin plaintiffs&apos; use of the
driveway and rejected defendants&apos; counterclaims. Initially, we must determine our
standard of review. Plaintiffs argue correctly that the standard of review for claims made
under ORS 28.010 - 28.160 depends on the nature of the dispute itself. May v. Chicago
Insurance Co. , 260 Or 285, 291-92, 490 P2d 150 (1971). They assert that defendants&apos;
counterclaims are not equitable in nature seeking to quiet title; rather they sound in
&quot;ejectment&quot; or are legal in nature. (7) As a result, they say, the trial court&apos;s findings can
be set aside only if there is no evidence to support them. Defendants respond that,
because they seek to enjoin plaintiffs&apos; use of the driveway, the nature of the relief they
seek is equitable in nature. One difficulty with defendants&apos; position is that the county
sought compensatory damages &quot;in an amount to be determined at trial&quot; as well as an
injunction in its counterclaim, and Sooys asked the court to declare that they &quot;have a right
of exclusive use and possession of the entire Leased property&quot; and that &quot;Plaintiffs are
presently using portions of the Leased Property without Sooys&apos; authorization and consent
and as such are trespassers.&quot; Nonetheless, for purposes of our standard of review, we
concern ourselves with the &quot;essence&quot; of the claims. Kassel v. City of Salem , 34 Or App
739, 741 n 1, 579 P2d 875 (1978). We conclude that the essence of defendants&apos; claims
are to prevent plaintiffs, through a declaratory judgment, from using a portion of
defendants&apos; lands as a driveway and, thus, the core relief that they seek is equitable in
nature. See, e.g. , FOPPO v. Washington County , 142 Or App 252, 258, 920 P2d 1141
(1996) (holding that, because the declaration sought was analogous to injunctive relief,
the declaratory judgment proceeding was equitable in nature and this court therefore
reviews de novo .).

Plaintiffs argue that &quot;[t]his is only a case where a public body (Lane
County) granted plaintiffs, their predecessors and the public a revocable right to use a
small piece of land (perhaps 10&apos; to 15&apos;) to connect Plaintiffs&apos; driveway to a public road
more than 30 years ago.&quot; While plaintiffs acknowledge that generally Lane County has
the right to deny private landowners access across its property to public roads, they
contend that the trial court ruled that the decision whether to deny plaintiffs and the
public access from Marcola Road to their property should be made administratively by the
Lane County Board of Commissioners with the opportunity for all interested parties to be
heard, rather than as a response to plaintiffs&apos; action. Alternatively, plaintiffs assert that
the trial court correctly found that there has been an implied dedication by the county of
its land for purposes of access to plaintiffs&apos; property. They point to the fact that Lane
County itself constructed concrete approaches and drainage improvements so as to permit
the use of the driveway across their land and that the county has permitted the public to
use the driveway for more than 30 years in order to gain access to plaintiffs&apos; apartment
buildings. Plaintiffs add that, until this litigation commenced, the county never
challenged their right to use the driveway.

The county responds that under ORS 368.326 it has no authority to vacate
an interest in property that is within a city and that the county&apos;s land is presently within the
City of Springfield. The county also contends that the trial court correctly found that
there was no express dedication of the driveway to public use and that plaintiffs are
unable to prove that the city impliedly dedicated the driveway to public use by clear and
unequivocal actions demonstrating that intent.

We agree with defendants that the record before us contains no evidence of
an express dedication. For an implied dedication of land to the public to occur, there must
be a clear and unequivocal manifestation by the owner of the property of an intent to
devote it to public use. Muzzy v. Wilson , 259 Or 512, 518, 487 P2d 875 (1971). Under
ORS 275.027, &quot;[t]he rights of any county to public lands are not extinguished by adverse
possession.&quot; Also, as the county correctly argues, the fact that the apartment occupants
and their invitees have used the driveway for many years is as consistent with the county&apos;s
acquiescence in that use as it is with an implied intent to dedicate the land to public use. There is, however, more evidence in the record regarding the county&apos;s intent
to dedicate a way across its land than plaintiffs&apos; mere use of the driveway. When Lane
County improved Marcola Road in the 1980s, it constructed a concrete driveway and
associated drainage improvements from the road across its land to plaintiffs&apos; property. It
also assessed itself for the costs of the improvement. There is also evidence that in 1982 a
county engineer, in making a report about a proposed relocation of Marcola Road,
recognized the need to &quot;reserve out an easement for the apartments.&quot; Although the county
dismisses that report as suggesting options that the county never acted on, that report,
together with the county&apos;s improvements to its own property to provide better access to
Marcola Road from the apartments, persuades us that the county intended that the
driveway be used by the public. There appears to be no other reasonable explanation for
the county&apos;s construction of permanent improvements on its own property that benefit a
private property owner.

There is also another factor that concerns us. The driveway across the
county&apos;s land provides access for fire and police protection. Apparently, the trial court
believed that there could be the potential of substantial and irreparable injury to the public
if an injunction issued. In that regard, our analysis is informed by the Supreme Court&apos;s
opinion in Minto v. Salem Water Etc. Co. , 120 Or 202, 250 P 722 (1926). In that case, the
defendant company was under a contractual obligation to supply the inhabitants of the
City of Salem with water. Minto , 120 Or at 205. The plaintiff brought suit to enjoin a
continuing trespass by the defendant, Id . at 218. The plaintiff contended that the
defendant used the plaintiff&apos;s property in excess of the terms of an easement granted by
the plaintiff to the defendant&apos;s predecessors in interest. Id. In determining whether the
plaintiff was entitled to relief, the court said that the defendant &quot;ought to do one of three
things: (1) Abide by its contract; (2) Compensate [the] plaintiff for rights taken in excess
of those granted, or (3) Abandon the easement and vacate the premises.&quot; Id. at 218-19. 
The court said, however,
 
&quot;It does not follow * * * as a matter of right, because there has been a
breach of plaintiff&apos;s legal rights, that he is entitled to the extraordinary
remedy of injunction. Even though there has been a continuing trespass
and a multiplicity of actions would result if the plaintiff were obliged to
seek redress at law, equity will not raise its restraining arm if, by so doing,
great and irreparable injury might result to the public[.]&quot;
 
 Id .

 Here, even if plaintiffs were deemed to be trespassers, we would be
reluctant to grant injunctive relief in light of the history of the use of the county&apos;s property
for access to the apartments and the significance of the injury that might occur if access
were denied. (8) In summary, we conclude for all the above reasons, as did the trial
court, that there has been an implied dedication of the driveway to public use by the
county, and, therefore, it follows that injunctive relief is not available.

whether the 2003 amendments to ORS 19.415(3) affect our standard of review because those
