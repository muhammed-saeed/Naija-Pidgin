		Chicken Surprise! 
 
 
 
A customer at a local fast food restaurant in Newport, VA., claims 
 to have gotten more than she bargained for when she received her order.
Katherine Ortega alleges that she found a fried chicken head in 
 the box of chicken wings she ordered Wednesday.

Ortega said someone who wasn&apos;t looking closely could have easily 
 mistaken the chicken&apos;s head for another piece of chicken like a 
 leg or a wing. The chicken&apos;s beak, the cone on top of its 
 head and some feathers are visible.

Ortega said she wants to know how the chicken&apos;s head could have 
 made it past inspectors and into the hands of a customer.

&quot;I usually look at my food, but I shouldn&apos;t have to look that 
 closely to see that,&quot; Ortega said. &quot;My 5-year-old 
 probably wouldn&apos;t have looked. He probably would have thought 
 it was a chicken leg and eaten it.&quot;
