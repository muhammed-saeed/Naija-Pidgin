Summary


This is the first book to examine the phenomena behind global kids&apos; relationships with brands. It looks at kids&apos; life priorities, hopes and dreams, and reveals the true drivers of kids trends by analyzing teen-minority groups, communities and clubs.

Tweens (8- to 14-year-olds) comprise a new type of audience. An increasingly powerful and smart consumer group, they not only spent US $300 billion but influenced an astounding US $1.88 trillion spend across the globe last year. They are different from previous generations in every way. They are more likely to have a friend on the other side of the world than in their own street, they think the TV remote is broken when they cant find the cursor on the screen, they drop from existence when the battery in their cell phone is flat, and they know current brand images better than any advertising agent.

Based on the worlds most extensive study of tween attitudes and behaviours ever conducted, BRANDchild is the first book to look in-depth at the phenomena behind global kids and their relationships with brands. Conducted by Millward Brown, the leading global market research agency, the BRANDchild survey involved several thousand kids from more than 70 cities in 8 countries (throughout Europe, Asia, the United States and South America). Several renowned experts including best-selling author Patricia B. Seybold share their unique views on kids trends and fascinating marketing techniques.

BRANDchild summarizes this research, as well as decades of experience from a variety of other sources on how to market to kids. It looks at their life priorities, hopes and dreams, and reveals the true drivers of kids trends by analyzing teen-minority groups, communities and clubs.

Packed with practical advice on how to create kids brands, including more than 50 fascinating previously unpublished case studies, BRANDchild proposes new innovative ways of marketing to this young audience. It is required reading for anyone wanting a fresh insight into this increasingly influential and demanding consumer group.







 
Foreword


 Children nowadays are tyrants. They contradict their parents, gobble their food, and tyrannize their teachers.
 Attributed to Socrates in the year 425 BC 

For the past 30 years, Millward Brown&apos;s mission has been to help marketers maximize their marketing and communications return on their investment. So, when Martin Lindstrom approached us and asked if we would be interested in providing the research findings to power his new book, BRANDchild, we readily accepted.

In today&apos;s world, many marketers are finding that their tried and tested &apos;rules&apos; no longer always apply. Across all segments, social relationships are changing, media is fragmenting, and everything is happening at warp speed. But it is amongst tomorrow&apos;s consumers that the changes are having most impact.

By partnering in this groundbreaking project, our aim was to add to our understanding of the global consumer; particularly the one we will all face in the very different world of tomorrow. We believe this book and the associated research provide unique insights into the early origins of brand relationships and help us to understand what the future will hold with tomorrow&apos;s new and demanding consumer.

As input for the book, Millward Brown undertook research with 914- year- olds across seven countries representing a cross-section of economies, as well as western and non-western cultures. We also undertook qualitative work, reviewed learnings from our own kids research databases, and conducted desk research on perceived wisdom on tweens in the marketplace in general. The findings from all stages of the research are fascinating. Some we expected; many more were a surprise.

The fact that the research clearly demonstrates that young consumers don&apos;t just influence family purchases like breakfast cereals; but have an important say on big ticket items like cars and adult fashion has major marketing implications. Most importantly, the point to remember is that wherever you are based in the world, you should be thinking about whether your brand or service requires a &apos;tween&apos; brand strategy.

However, if you do decide this is the route you want to go down, then prepare for the ride of a lifetime. You&apos;ll have to get to grips with new ways of thinking and new ways of communicating. You&apos;ll have to learn that when it comes to managing your brand or service, you have to be double jointed, not just flexible. You&apos;ll have to learn to work in tween time, ie 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and talk tweenspeak.

The book Martin has written is full of really practical tips to help you do this. Certainly, understanding kids today isn&apos;t child play. But we hope that this book will help you begin to get to grips with this increasingly influential consumer group.

Enjoy the read; I think Martin has written a stunningly interesting, entertaining and easy to read book and please feel free to contact Millward Brown with your thoughts and comments. We love feedback!

1. Tweens


 Dream as if you&apos;ll live forever. Live as if you&apos;ll die today.
 James Dean 



When James Dean swaggered onto movie screens in the 1950s, his rebellious image encapsulated the daring and dreams of an entire generation. During his short career he managed to dramatize the questions that were on the lips of every young person in the mid-20th century.

James Dean was as much a product of his time and place as the youth of today are of theirs. His acts of rebellion are not, however, today&apos;s. And although his movies are as popular as ever, a rerun of a James Dean movie would barely raise a pierced eyebrow among a new generation weaned on special effects and digitized soundtracks.

Let&apos;s call this generation the tweens. Tweens span the pre-adolescent years through to the age of about fourteen.



Meet the New Kids


It is not surprising that this generation has been tagged the &apos;age of compression&apos;. Almost every aspect of today&apos;s tween-ager is different from what we have seen among past generations. They&apos;ve grown up faster, are more connected, more direct and more informed. They have more personal power, more money, influence and attention than any other generation before them.

No other generation has ever had as much disposable income as this one. So it&apos;s no coincidence that this emerging generation has become powerful enough to have a specific allotment in every marketing director&apos;s budget. They spend money and time with a casual and carefree attitude: they get what they want when they want it. And there is a reason for this.

This is the first generation that&apos;s been born and bred with an understanding of today&apos;s economic world. They play the stock market as if it&apos;s another version of a computer game. They talk about trading indices while they swap baseball or DragonBallZ cards, and they watch financial news as if it&apos;s an ongoing soap opera.

It&apos;s not surprising that 8 per cent of the teenagers in the United States have some or all of their money invested in stocks and futures. Twenty per cent have their own checking accounts, and 70 per cent would love a credit card if their parents (and the bank) would allow it. This is a generation that spends in excess of US $150 billion a year. And if this is not enough, then add another US $150 billion, because that&apos;s the amount that this generation actually controls when their parents are supposedly in the driver&apos;s seat, holding on to the family purse strings.

From a purely monetary perspective, it&apos;s no wonder that this generation has created such enormous attention and wielded so much influence among companies and their brands.

&apos;Where&apos;s the cursor in my book?&apos;



There can be no doubt that the steady diet of information, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through a whole variety of channels, is playing a major role in shaping this new generation. Penetration through technology is a key factor in an unprecedented level of global integration.

This is the first generation born with a mouse in their hands and a computer screen as their window on the world. Tweens understood icons before they could read. They now surf the Net with an ease and speed that belongs only to those who are at home in cyberspace. They think in megabytes, pipeline sizes and screen resolutions, in the same way that previous generations thought about swapping stickers, memorizing football scores and perfecting wheelies on their bicycles.

Most of the barriers preventing older generations from fully embracing digital media do not apply to this new generation. In fact, electronic media is such an integral part of their life that it no longer holds any fascination in and of itself. In many ways, the heavy emphasis on technology we saw in the 1990s has shifted. The focus is now on content. The computer, with its awesome abilities, is now the vehicle for other activities. The emphasis is now on games, and how best to move through the levels, what mods (modifications) are available, and the release date of the next version. For the first time since computers entered our lives we&apos;re encountering a generation that is tuned into interactive media - and far less preoccupied with the infrastructure behind the screen that makes it all possible. Tweens have no notion of the
