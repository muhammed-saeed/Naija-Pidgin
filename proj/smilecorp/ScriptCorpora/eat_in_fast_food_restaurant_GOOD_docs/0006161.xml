 Reviews for Dengeos Restaurant: 17           AVERAGE OVERALL RATING Showing 1 - 10 of 17 Previous | 1 | 2 | Next Sort By: Most Recent Positive Negative Most Helpful           USER RATING By John , 2/23/11 i have been to this establishment as a customer, and i have to say, why are people saying that the food is great. ITS NOT. the portions are small, for the price. Let me also say, that i really do believe that the staff do not take kindly to minority customers. I am a asian american, and i was disgusted by the treatment of one of their staff members. They seemed to be hostile, and not friendly toward myself. But the aora of this place did not seem right. I did not see much diversity among the customers. Something did not feel right in this place. I do believe that racism is still alive and well in 2011 Was this review helpful?

Contributor , 8/28/09 I had a business lunch there and ordered the Greek Chicken and Gyros with Feta cheese. The food was wonderful. The cashier was very patient with us even when we were a bit indecisive. the food came quickly and it was the right temperature. The place seemed like it was recently remodeled. I had a very good experience. Best of all free refills Was this review helpful?

I&apos;m happy that they&apos;re close to home.

A nice place to take the kids for a burger. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By Ninodino , 1/18/08 Dengeos has a great variety of food. I especially like their soups and chicken kabobs!! YUMMY!! =) The only drawback is that Dengeos does not have a drive through and parking is really difficult. They should expend and provide more parking, otherwise, I highly recommend Dengeos!! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By Dan , 11/7/07 Absolutely the best restaurant of its kind anywhere! Super Gyros, wonderful Italian beef and sausage. Great food at the right price. I&apos;ve been eating there for over 30years. The owners have continually invested and reinvested money to make their business better. Was this review helpful?
