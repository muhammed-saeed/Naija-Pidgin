(Best Syndication News) It is uncertain how many people will be able to take advantage of President Obama’s housing assistance program, but there is no question that many homeowners are in need. There are two main prongs to the Financial Stability Plan which will make refinancing available to homeowners and offer incentives to banks to modify loans.

Home Refinancing Program

It is hoped that the refinancing plan will help 4 to 5 million homeowners who do not have enough equity in their home to refinance. Many homeowners have seen the values of their properties decline and are unable to refinance to lower interest rates.

 
 
 

With this new opportunity, dubbed the Home Affordability Refinance Program , people who have made their payments “responsibly” but have seen the value of their homes decline, will be able to refinance.

This is for loans currently owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to government reports, these two GSEs hold nearly half of all home loans. Even if your loan originated somewhere else, Fannie and Freddie may have purchased it.

If you currently have a rate of 6.5 percent, you may be eligible to refinance to a rate near 5.16 percent, even if you don’t have the equity. This can save homeowners thousands of dollars a year.

Loan Modifications

The Obama Administration has set aside $75 billion for their loan modification program which could help 3 to 4 million At-Risk homeowners. The goal of the “Home Affordable Modification Program” is to prevent foreclosures which drive down home values for everyone.

This program will lower mortgage payments for up to five years. After five years the payments may gradually increase. Incentives are offered to banks and homeowners who opt to take part in this program.

This modification program is designed for homeowners who have seen their loan payments adjust upward to 40 or 50 percent of their income. If you are suffering a hardship because of lost income or increased expenses, this will help lower your payments, but you need to take advantage of it within three years.

Even if you have not missed any payments, you may be eligible for this program. Assistance will be provided for those who are current and behind. It is restricted to owner occupied residences not exceeding the FHA conforming limit of $729,750. You may be required to enter into HUD-certified consumer debt counseling if your “back end” debt (which includes not only housing debt, but other debt including car loans and credit card debt) equals to 55% or more.

The United States Treasury will partner with lenders to reduce monthly payments. In order to receive compensation from the government, lenders must lower payments to a specified affordability level (no more than 38 % of total income). The government will then match reductions dollar for dollar down to a 31% debt-to-income ratio.

Interest rates could be reduced to 2 %. If at that rate the debt to income level is still over 31%, lenders will then extend the term or amortization period up to 40 years, and finally forbear principal at no interest, until the payment is reduced to the 31% target.

But there is an incentive for banks to lower rates and payments. The government may share the cost of reducing the principal up to the amount the lender would have received for an interest rate reduction. The borrower must reach that 31% debt-to-income ratio.

Also, modification servicers will get an up-front of $1,000 for each eligible modification. As long as the borrower stays current and stays in the program they will also get $1,000 each year for three years subject to a de minimis threshold. De minimis is a tiny amount of money.

There is an incentive to banks to keep their loans current too. If the bank catches a borrower before they miss a payment, they will get $1,500. The servicer will also get $500.

The borrower will also get some money from this program. He or she can get up to $1,000 each year for five years. They must stay current in the program to receive the money. The money will go towards the principal of the loan.

The FDIC has also offered to compensate lenders that suffer losses from failed modifications when home prices decline. Holders of mortgages modified under the program would be provided with an additional payment on each modified loan, linked to declines in the home price index.

While eligible loan modifications will not require any participation by second lien holders, the program will include additional incentives to extinguish second liens on loans modified under the program, in order to reduce the overall indebtedness of the borrower and improve loan performance.
