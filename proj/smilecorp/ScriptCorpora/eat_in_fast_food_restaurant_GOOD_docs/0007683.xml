Subject: Rare Development Opportunity in Chicago&apos;s Hyde Park 

 The City of Chicago and 
 the University of Chicago offer their combined land
holdings in the center of Hyde Park&apos;s commercial district for mixed-use
development. This rare assemblage offers developers a unique opportunity to
creatively reshape a nearly three acre site into a cohesive, active neighborhood
core. The property is located at the corner of 53rd Street and Lake Park
Avenue, blocks from the university campus, close to Lake Michigan and Lake 
 Shore
Drive, and adjacent to a commuter rail station. The land holdings include
Harper Court, a four-building retail center constructed in the 1960s, and 
 an
adjacent public parking lot. 

 The property is offered 
 for sale at the target purchase price of $7,745,000 or
approximately $62 per square foot of land. (This is the price of the leased 
 fee
interest because one of the four Harper Court buildings remains under lease). 
 A
long-term ground lease may also be considered. 

 The request for proposals 
 is divided into two parts. The first submission will
establish the qualifications of the development team, its financial capacity,
its experience with similar developments, and the conformance of its
redevelopment concept to the goals and objectives of the RFP. In the second
part, a short-list of teams will be invited to submit a detailed development
proposal. 

 The city and university 
 will host a pre-bid conference at 9:00 a.m. on December
17th at the United Church of Hyde Park, 1448 W. 53rd Street. Please RSVP to
either James Wilson, City of Chicago project manager at jwilson@cityofchicago.org 
or 312-744-2379 or Susan Campbell, Assistant Vice President of the University 
 of
Chicago at smc1@uchicago.edu or 773-702-4065. 

 Below is a link to the 
 RFP document. Hard copies of the RFP will be available
at the pre-bid conference. If you will download the document and do not attend
the pre-bid conference, it is important to register with either of the above

 I. 
 SUMMARY OF OFFERING

A. Owners’Objectives
The University of Chicago and the City of Chicago in collaboration with the 
 4th
Ward Alderman have partnered for the redevelopment of the Harper Court area
known as the“Heart of Hyde Park”.

The Owners have assembled a number of prime contiguous sites in the center 
 of
the Hyde Park neighborhood in Chicago bounded roughly by Lake Park Avenue,
53rd Street, Harper Avenue, and 52nd Street, which include parcels currently
owned by the University of Chicago and the City of Chicago. This rare
assemblage of parcels amounts to a project area of approximately 2.94 acres
and provides developers with a unique opportunity to creatively reshape this 
 area
into a cohesive, active neighborhood core.
The Owners’objectives in the disposition or lease of the Properties 
 are as
follows:

1. Redevelop the property through high quality, unique mixed-use
development to serve as the neighborhood commercial“core”for
Hyde Park in a manner consistent with the character of Hyde Park

2. Contract with a qualified developer who has a demonstrated track
record in urban retail/residential redevelopment, adaptive reuse,
and/or historic preservation

3. Obtain a purchase price or lease agreement consistent with the
Owners’financial and community objectives

4. Adhere to City standards for affordable housing and for MWBE
involvement

5. Provide for community consultation on a regular basis during the
RFP process

6. Complete the redevelopment in an expeditious fashion

The Owners are requesting proposals from qualified firms to provide
development services as a Master Developer for the redevelopment of the“Heart
of Hyde Park”. This two-step process includes an initial Part One-Request 
 for
Qualifications (RFQ) followed by a Part Two-Request for Proposals (RFP). Both
the RFQ and RFP have been outlined in this document to attempt to provide 
 an
understanding of the full scope of work that will be required of the developers.
The Part One-RFQ process will seek responses from developers experienced in
the redevelopment of high quality, mixed-use urban neighborhood“downtowns”,
with the goal of short-listing a limited number of developers to proceed into 
 the
Part Two-RFP phase. The RFQ responses should outline the developer’s
qualifications and experience, development team and financial capacity, and 
 the
general concept or approach to the development project. An evaluation
committee consisting of the Alderman, representatives of the City of Chicago 
 and
9
the University of Chicago and the Owners’Agent will recommend a short-list 
 of
developers to continue into the Part Two-RFP process.

During the Part Two-RFP, the Owners’Agent will invite the short-list 
 of
developers to submit detailed development proposals including a complete
development team, physical master plan design concepts and layouts, proposed
purchase or lease terms, tenant program and leasing, economic pro-formas,
schedules and specific performance commitments to undertake and implement
an agreed upon redevelopment scenario. Following the submittal, each shortlisted
developer will be asked to give presentations and participate in oral
interviews. The Owners will then select one or more developers with which 
 to
begin negotiations and subsequently select a single developer to proceed into 
 a
Redevelopment Agreement.

The selection process will be determined through unanimous vote of both
Owners, each with equal approval rights.

The Owners wish to enter into a Redevelopment Agreement with a developer
who will have the ability to purchase or lease and redevelop the sites entirely, 
 or
in partnership with other developers. The anticipated role of the developer 
 shall
include the detailed development of a Master Development Plan and Strategy
and the implementation and management of development activities necessary 
 to
carry out the intent of the Master Development Plan. The developer will also
assume responsibility for the overall development process, including
entitlements, zoning approvals, market leasing and sales, financial assistance,
and overall capitalization with the cooperation of the Owners. The selected
developer will retain the obligation to meet any and all performance criteria
throughout the entire redevelopment process regardless of any partnership 
 or
subcontracts. Completion of the entire redevelopment in a timely fashion is
critical, however the Owners recognize that a phased approach to the
development may be proposed.

All plans and proposals for the redevelopment project will be subject to the
criteria and guidelines established herein, and the ongoing review and approval
by the Owners. The Owners reserve the right, at any time and in their sole
discretion, to reject any and all responses, and/or to withdraw the RFQ/RFP
without notice.

B. Property Summary
Located northwest of the corner of 53rd Street and Lake Park Avenue, the Harper
Court Project Area includes approximately 2.94 acres of land area. Currently 
 the
project site includes the Harper Court Properties and the adjacent City of
Chicago public parking lot along Lake Park Ave (see Exhibit A in the Appendix
for more information).

C. Transaction Timing
With the desire to continue the positive momentum of development on 53rd Street
and the surrounding Hyde Park area, the Owners will require that the selected
developer begin the redevelopment process immediately upon acceptance of the
redevelopment agreement. Through all phases of this process from selection,
negotiation of the agreement, closing, and project implementation, time is 
 of the
essence.

D. Transaction Structure
The Owners will evaluate each proposed transaction structure on a case-by-case
basis. Therefore, neither a purchase nor a lease agreement is included as 
 part
of this RFQ/RFP. The Owners are willing to entertain various real estate
transaction arrangements which facilitate the redevelopment objectives including
an outright purchase, a sale/leaseback, a land lease or a partnership based 
 on
the developer’s proposed response and ability to positively impact objectives.

E. Due Diligence/Property Inspection
A site tour will be offered as part of the pre-proposal meeting. Additional 
 site
tours may be requested and coordinated through the Owners’Agent. Potential
developers may also ask the Owners’Agent for clarification of any of 
 the
information included in the RFQ/RFP. The Owners’Agent will make best 
 efforts
to satisfy any and all requests for additional information and clarification. 
 Neither
the Owners nor the Owners’Agent will be held responsible for incomplete 
 or
incorrect information provided by the University of Chicago, the City of Chicago
and/or their agents or third-party contractors.
Questions or clarifications regarding the RFP can be directed to James Wilson:

developers are advised that purchase price is an important but not primary
consideration in the evaluation of the proposals to the RFQ/RFP.
The Owners are seeking proposals that balance the best quality project for
the community with an appropriate financial value to the Owners. 

 III. PROPERTY 
 DESCRIPTION
A. Overview
The site represents a key development anchor to the entire Hyde Park
neighborhood and mid-south communities and has been included in significant
recent public discussion and input. The 53rd Street Corridor (from Lake Shore
Drive to Cottage Grove) serves as an important retail street for the Hyde 
 Park
community and adjacent neighborhoods, while also offering a variety of other
uses including office, residential and institutional. Though other streets 
 including
55th and 57th provide retail and support services, 53rd Street remains the 
 primary
retail corridor and has the greatest potential to evolve into the vibrant“heart”of
the area. 

 B. Ownership
Currently there are two ownership parcels within the Harper Court
Redevelopment Project: the Harper Court Properties, owned by the University 
 of
Chicago and the adjacent public parking lot owned by the City of Chicago. 
 It is
the intention of the Owners to convey the property to a single entity prior 
 to the
purchase or lease by the awarded developer.

C. Site Description and Specifications
The“Heart of Hyde Park”project area is located between 52nd 
 and 53rd Street
with prime frontage at the corner of 53rd and Lake Park Avenue continuing 
 north
along Lake Park Avenue. The site is ideally accessed from Lake Shore Drive 
 at
53rd Street.

The project site includes the two aforementioned parcels that will be conveyed 
 to
a developer under negotiated terms of a redevelopment agreement with the
controlling entity. Additionally, adjacent public rights-of-way within the 
 Harper
Court area may be considered in final design proposals for redevelopment
provided proper access and circulation is maintained. The project area does 
 not
include the 53rd and Harper Ave“Theater Building”, the Columbian 
 Apartment
building, the McDonald’s parcel located at the northeast corner of Lake 
 Park
Avenue and 52nd Street or any other existing buildings along 53rd Street (see
Exhibit A).

•Harper Court Properties
Immediately north of 53rd Street and Harper Avenue is the retail complex
known as Harper Court, consisting of approximately 73,320 SF of site area
and recently purchased by the University of Chicago for $6.5 million. The
Owners are working with all tenants to assist with their relocation prior 
 to
completion of the RFP process with the exception of the 5201 South Harper
Ave Building.
The 5201 South Harper Avenue building (north building @ 52nd street),
comprised of 14,300 SF net rentable square feet, is leased to Park 52, (a
15
Jerry Kleiner Restaurant) until May of 2016, with two 5-year extension
options, and the famous Checkerboard Lounge whose initial lease runs until
May of 2009, with one 5-year extension option. These leases are anticipated
to remain in place until their term expires or, at the discretion of the selected
developer, their relocation terms are met as stipulated in their leases.
Similarly, developers may wish to relocate these tenants within the
redevelopment to accelerate access to that portion of the property. With the
exception of these two leases for the 5201 S. Harper Avenue building, the
developer should assume that there will be no existing lease obligations or
occupancy in the Harper Court at the time of transfer.
A summary of the 5201 S. Harper leases is available upon request from the
Owners.

•City Parking Lot and City R.O.W.
The City Parking Lot is an undeveloped parcel consisting of approximately
54,990 SF of site area, which currently contains about 170 at grade parking
spaces accessed from Lake Park Ave. The lot serves the 53rd Street corridor
and Harper Court retail stores with short-term, metered parking and monthly
parking for business owners and employees in the area. The City-owned
parking lot currently charges minimal rates with a four-hour maximum to help
encourage retail activity and turnover. Developers will be responsible for, 
 at a
minimum, the replacement of a comparable number of public parking spaces
and up to 400 public spaces at a maximum, at the discretion of the developer.
Funds to offset the construction of these public spaces may be made
available by the City from the TIF. These spaces shall be in addition to any
required by code for the redevelopment program, and must be priced and
operated to serve the community interest.

This lot is currently a vital amenity to Harper Court and the 53rd Street
Corridor retailers and businesses. Careful consideration should be given to
the phasing of the redevelopment to ensure the ongoing vitality of any
businesses remaining in Harper Court, as well as and neighboring businesses
throughout construction.

Existing City streets and/or alley rights-of-way that are within or adjacent 
 to
the site can be considered in the development plan for a more contiguous site
provided that the final proposals maintain and enhance the connectivity and
proper circulation in and through the area. (See Exhibit A, Site Summary
Diagram for more information)

A portion of Harper Avenue between 53rd and 52nd Streets was vacated as
part of the 1960’s redevelopment plan. It is the goal of the Owners’to
reconnect Harper Avenue and allow access to/from north of 52nd Street. The
final layout and configuration of that reconnection will be the responsibility 
 of
the developers and should be integrated into the final master plan solution 
 of
the development proposal.
16
•Other Site Opportunities
Though not included as part of this proposal, other adjacent parcels that
enhance development potential and opportunities may be included in the
redevelopment project should the developer elect to pursue them as part of 
 a
separate process/agreement. Developers should demonstrate their control of
or ability to control parcels if included.
D. Existing Conditions and Site Preparation
The site is anticipated to be delivered to the developer cleared of all structures
except for the 5201 S. Harper Ave building. Any cleared area may either be
paved for use as temporary parking for the development or landscaped as an
open lawn area.

The selected developer will assume the cost of clearing and disposing of
additional existing buildings (5201 S. Harper), infrastructure and debris 
 such as
paved surfaces, curbs and gutters, fill, fencing, and lighting. The selected
developer is solely responsible for bearing all costs and making all arrangements
associated with the abandonment, relocation or installation of private or 
 public
utilities. Developers are advised to contact the Department of Transportation
(312-744-4828) and private utility companies for information concerning existing
utility lines. A copy of the City of Chicago Bureau of Underground’s 
 plans is
included in Exhibit G.
The selected developer is also responsible for reconstructing sidewalks and
relocating street lighting standards, fire hydrants, or other facilities within 
 the
public way if such work is necessitated by the redevelopment project. Any
construction in the public way must be made according to the City’s
specifications, and the work must be fully bonded.
The City may consider reimbursement of cost associated with site preparation
and public improvements that show clear public value and enhancement based
on eligible expenses outlined in the 53rd Street TIF.

E. Environmental and Soil Conditions
Environmental Conditions: There is no knowledge of any major existing
environmental hazards on the Harper Court site as indicated in a Phase I report
commissioned in March 2008 by the University of Chicago for the Harper Court
Property. The assessment did report evidence of possible Recognized
Environmental Conditions (REC) in three locations where prior usage included 
 an
auto repair shop and filling stations. A summary of the Phase I Assessment 
 for
the Harper Court Property is on the CD of appendix materials under Exhibit 
 F.
No Phase I has been conducted for the City’s Parking Lot site.
The Owners may require the selected developer to obtain a Phase I
environmental report for the entire site prior to closing (performed in accordance
17
with ASTM 1527-05 and All Appropriate Inquiry standards). Based on the
conclusions of the Phase I report, the Owners may also require submission 
 of a
Phase II analysis. The Department of Environment will review the reports and
recommend appropriate action, which may require enrolling the site in the 
 Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency’s Site Remediation Program (SRP). If 
 the
development proposal includes residential, DOE will require that the site 
 be
enrolled in SRP and receive a Comprehensive No Further Remediation letter
prior to occupancy.

The land will be sold“as-is”with no warranties or representations 
 as to its
environmental condition, and it will be the responsibility of the selected 
 developer
to complete any remediation required under the SRP. The redevelopment
agreement with the selected developer will include release and indemnification
language protecting the Owners from liability.

The cost of environmental remediation of the property, if any, will be considered
in negotiations with the selected developer.

Soil Conditions: The Owners have not performed a geotechnical analysis of 
 the
site, and the City make no representations, warrantees or covenants as to 
 the
suitability of the land for any purpose whatsoever.

Additional Testing: It is the responsibility of the selected developer to 
 investigate
the environmental and geotechnical conditions of the site to its own satisfaction,
and any studies performed in addition to the Owners’analyses will be 
 at the
developer’s cost. The Owners will grant the selected developer a right-of-entry
for the purpose of conducting geotechnical and environmental tests. The
developer must provide the Owners with an acceptable certificate of insurance,
and the developer must agree to provide the Owners with copies of any and 
 all
geotechnical, environmental or other test reports.

F. Neighborhood Context
Hyde Park/Kenwood is home to numerous institutions including the Museum of
Science and Industry, the University of Chicago, the University of Chicago
Medical Center, the Oriental Institute and the Robie House and is often described
as small town living in the heart of the City. Additionally, with over 45,000
residents from across a varied socioeconomic demographic, Hyde
Park/Kenwood is frequently recognized as a national model of racial diversity 
 and
urban stability.

The 53rd Street corridor and surrounding area have been the focus of significant
study and assessment by the community, the City and the University of Chicago
including the following efforts: 2008 53rd Street Vision Workshops, 2008 Harper
Court Survey, the 2003“Heart of Hyde Park”Development Study 
 and the 1999
Planning Now Study for 53rd Street. A number of recent workshop efforts held 
 by
the community, 4th Ward Alderman Toni Preckwinkle, the University of Chicago,
the City of Chicago, the South East Chicago Commission and key local
18
businesses have helped inform a number of recommendations and guidelines
outlined in the RFP, and have helped to foster a positive development
environment in and around the Hyde Park/Kenwood community.
This strength of the Hyde Park/Kenwood area and community commitment is
evident in the following recent initiatives and investments:
•53rd Street TIF District
The project site area lies within the 53rd Street TIF District, established 
 in
January 2001 by the City of Chicago with the specific purpose of generating
revenues for public improvements. Specific public improvement priorities
identified to date include a public parking facility to serve the 53rd Street
shopping district, a planned expansion to the Canter Middle School on 4959
S. Blackstone Avenue and funding of various programs benefiting the 53rd
Street Corridor (Small Business Improvement Funds-SBIF, the CleanSlate
Program).
•53rd and 55th Street Corridor Improvements
In 2002, the City of Chicago completed $2 million of streetscape improvement
projects on 53rd and 55th Streets that have created a friendlier, clean
pedestrian environment with new historic light fixtures, cleaning and painting
of all street poles, new signs, meters and trash receptacles, and additional
landscaping. The Clean Slate program begun in 2006 has been very
successful in maintaining this clean and attractive environment throughout 
 the
Hyde Park commercial areas.
•Metra Improvements&amp;CDOT Lake Park Corridor Master Plan
CDOT has developed a master plan for the Lake Park Corridor Project (47th
to 57th Street), which includes renovation of the 53rd and 55th Street viaducts
and embankment enhancements currently underway. Additionally, Metra
recently completed a multi-million dollar project, replacing all of the Hyde 
 Park
stations, platforms, stairways and signage. The new stations help to promote
an attractive and accessible environment and increased use of the Metra
lines as an important link to downtown Chicago and area wide
neighborhoods.
•Checkerboard Lounge and Park 52 Restaurant: The University of
Chicago, working with longtime club owner LC Thurman, relocated the
legendary blues and jazz club, the Checkerboard Lounge, to 5201 S. Harper,
in 2005. Recently, Park 52, a new restaurant by acclaimed restaurateur Jerry
Kleiner, opened within the same building. Each tenant provides a unique
destination draw both locally and regionally, that will help catalyze the
transformation of the Hyde Park downtown.
•Treasure Island and Hyde Park Produce: The recently opened Treasure
Island Grocery store and the relocated and expanded Hyde Park Produce
19
have helped to enhance the fresh grocery offerings and bolster a positive
retail environment in Hyde Park.
•Hyde Park Bank: The Hyde Park Bank recently completed a multi-million
dollar renovation of its lobby, banking hall, and building exterior, signaling 
 its
commitment as a key anchor to the 53rd Street corridor and the Hyde Park
area.
•Village Center Redevelopment: The adjacent“Village Center”, 
 just north of
Harper Court on 51st and Lake Park, is currently planning for a major
redevelopment with modified zoning to allow for a new mixed-use
redevelopment. Plans include ground level retail fronting on both Lake Park
Ave and Harper Ave, with two residential structures (an 8-story mid-rise along
Lake Park and a 24 story high rise at Harper and 51st St.) atop. Structured
parking will be provided internally, and screened from view outside the
development.
•Adjacent Uses and New Developments
Many areas around Hyde Park and throughout the mid-south neighborhoods,
including Woodlawn, North Kenwood/Oakland, and Bronzeville, continue to
experience new growth and redevelopment of high quality residential
communities. While greatly enhancing the image and appeal of these
neighborhoods, these developments have also brought about a new market
of residents and business, and helped significantly in revitalizing the
connection of Hyde Park to downtown Chicago.

G. Vehicular Access and Public Transportation
Direct vehicular southbound access to the 53rd Street business district is 
 via Lake
Shore Drive (LSD) with an exit at 53rd Street. Hyde Park is also well served 
 with
additional southbound LSD exits at 47th, 51st and 57th streets and northbound 
 at
57th and 47th Streets. As a primary east-west connection, 53rd Street extends
from Lake Shore Drive to Drexel Boulevard, which also provides access to the
surrounding communities. In addition, there are a number of arterial streets
(Lake Park, Woodlawn, etc.) that connect Hyde Park to the major expressways,
the surrounding neighborhoods as well as serve as primary internal routes 
 for
vehicular travel within Hyde Park.

A number of one-way and dead-end streets exist throughout Hyde Park including
Harper Avenue. As part of this redevelopment, it is requested that Harper
Avenue should be reopened/reconnected to“thru”traffic allowing 
 better access in
and around the surrounding area. Currently, service and delivery access to 
 the
area is from 53rd Street, Harper Avenue, and 52nd Street with no public alleys
serving the project area. Redevelopment plans need to address and solve
service access to all new development while maintaining a quality pedestrian 
 and
vehicular environment.
20
Metra provides direct rail service to Hyde Park with stations at 47th, 51st, 
 53rd,
55th-57th and 59th Streets to downtown Chicago, terminating at Randolph Street
on the north, and the southern suburbs like Flossmoor, Olympia Hills and
University Park to the south. In addition, CTA offers several bus routes to
downtown and has contracted with the University to provide free bus service 
 for
students to connect the campus to the west, north and east portions of the
neighborhood.

H. Public Infrastructure
Major infrastructure/utility services are available at the site and located 
 primarily
under the existing street and alley right-of-way (R.O.W.) including sewer, 
 water,
electric, natural gas, telephone/data and cable. As part of the development 
 of
Harper Court in the 1960’s, a portion of the Old Lake Park R.O.W. was 
 vacated
from 53rd Street north to 52nr Street along with a number of utilities. However,
some active utilities still remain within the easement as well as other
dead/abandoned lines. (See Exhibit G for additional utility information).
If required, utility relocation to accommodate a final development plan as 
 well as
upgrades to service/capacity necessitated by redevelopment should be explored.
The City may consider reimbursement of eligible expenses through TIF dollars.
This might include utility relocation, utility upgrades, site lighting, and 
 streetscape
and landscape improvements. Provided funds are available, the City may
contribute towards infrastructure and utility improvements, subject to City 
 and
Aldermanic review and approval.

I. Zoning and Regulatory Ordinances
The site is currently zoned under a planned development, PD #38, initially
approved in 1965 for the creation of Harper Court (see attached Exhibit E). 
 It is
anticipated that the Planned Development will require updating through an
amendment to respond to and accommodate the approved final development
plans. The Department of Planning and Development will assist the chosen
developer in this process.

F.A.R.: The final development plan will most likely require an increase in 
 the
overall density and site coverage of at Harper Court in order to achieve the
various goals of a vibrant mixed-use district. Based on similar precedent 
 retail
districts, adjacent redevelopment efforts, as well as professional and public 
 input,
it is suggested that the overall development density range target a Floor 
 Area
Ratio (F.A.R.) range of 2.5 up to 5. The proper distribution of any future 
 density
should be commensurate with the massing, scale and heights of surrounding
context, including 53rd Street corridor, Lake Park Ave corridor as well as 
 East
Hyde Park.

Ordinances: Development proposals are subject to all applicable City of Chicago
Ordinances which may include the following: The Chicago Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance, the Chicago Landscape Ordinance, the Chicago Parking Garage
21
Ordinance, the Chicago Townhouse Ordinance and the Chicago Stormwater
Management Ordinance.
For more information, see Exhibit D and/or contact DPD at City hall to obtain 
 a
booklet that offers guidelines to these ordinances.

J. TIF Redevelopment Project Area
The property is located in the 53rd Street Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district
which was formed in 2001 primarily to raise revenue to fund public improvement
projects (see Exhibit C). Tax Increment Financing assists development projects
by using the increased property tax revenue generated by these projects. The
53rd Street TIF District was established with the primary purpose of generating
TIF revenues for public improvements to address structured parking to support
development on 53rd Street, Canter Middle School’s expansion and renovation
needs and other public improvements.

As a“public purpose TIF”, TIF assistance will be considered for 
 proposals that
provide tangible public benefits, however, such assistance is not guaranteed.
The TIF may provide reimbursement for eligible development costs with clear
public benefit including land acquisition, site preparation, environmental
remediation, affordable housing offsets, cultural activities, preservation 
 of a
historic building, social services, fiscal benefits, innovative environmentally
sustainable features new/improved streets and public infrastructure, professional
fees, leasing commissions and job training. New construction is not an eligible
expense except for development of low-income housing. Proposals that request
TIF assistance must demonstrate the need for such assistance.

Residential projects over 10 units that seek TIF assistance must set aside 
 20
percent of the units for sale to or occupancy by households with incomes no
greater than 60 percent of the Chicago Area Median Income for rental
developments, or no greater than 100 percent of the Chicago AMI for for-sale
developments. Non-residential developments or residential developments of 
 less
than 10 units must provide tangible public benefits such as affordable housing
units, new or retained permanent jobs, new retail services in an underserved
community, cultural activities, preservation of a historic building, social 
 services,
fiscal benefits, innovative environmentally sustainable features or other 
 desired
benefits identified in the TIF district’s redevelopment plan.

Projects that receive TIF financing must pay prevailing wage rates for all
construction jobs, employ Chicago residents for half of all construction worker
hours, and comply with the City’s affirmative action plan for minority- 
 and womenowned
business enterprises (MBE/WBE).

The amount of TIF assistance provided to a project is a function of the increased
tax revenue that will be generated by the project over the remaining life 
 of the TIF
district, the demonstrated need for financial assistance, and the existence 
 of
22
eligible development costs. Typically, TIF funding of eligible costs may not
exceed 25% of the project costs. Applications for TIF assistance are processed
by the Department of Planning and Development. The selected developer will 
 be
expected to work with the Department in processing the TIF request.
All proposed development projects within the 53rd Street TIF District are 
 subject
to review and approval by the 53rd Street TIF Advisory Council, a 13-person
governing board appointed by the 4th Ward Alderman, that meets publically 
 every
other month throughout the year.
23
 IV. THE DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

A. Development Goals and Objectives
The redevelopment of Harper Court must create a vibrant neighborhood
commercial district to serve the community and to serve as a destination due 
 to
its distinct qualities, character and ambiance. To do so will involve the 
 unique
blend of community and university attributes into a place with a life and 
 vibrancy
only found in such neighborhoods. With this strong focus on creating a“sense 
 of
place”and quality neighborhood environment, the urban and architectural 
 design
and mix of program uses are critically important and will become a primary
consideration in the selection of the developer.

To help guide the future redevelopment of the Properties without strictly 
 dictating,
the Owners have established the following primary objectives and parameters 
 for
the success of the project:

•Create a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood core that would serve the
diverse community, University and city-wide visitors

•Improve the image and identity of 53rd Street/Harper Court area as 
 an
active, attractive and street-oriented commercial district

•Leverage the historic character of the neighborhood

•Attract a high quality mix of commercial uses, local and national, 
 that
reflect the tastes, incomes, and needs of the immediate neighbors as well
as the broader communities, while assuring effective relocation strategies
for existing tenants and opening possibilities for new, locally-generated
businesses.

•Increase the daytime and nighttime population to further enhance the
commercial vitality through additional uses such as office and residential
including a mix of product type and for a range of incomes

•Feature high quality urban design and architecture that not only is
respectful of the architectural context, but also continues Hyde Park’s
traditions of uniqueness and innovation

•Establish an accessible, pedestrian-friendly environment that can
serve as a model of effective handicap accessibility through quality
streetscape, open space and design

•Provide adequate parking to serve the development and the 53rd Street
area and work with local and city officials to strengthen the transportation
options to connect with the surrounding areas and Downtown 

 
24
These overall objectives will be used to evaluate each developer’s proposal,
based on creating a quality mixed-use development for Hyde Park.
There are a number of neighborhoods that serve as good precedents for quality
redevelopment projects including: the Delmar Loop District serving the City 
 and
Counties of St. Louis and the Washington University markets with a unique 
 mix
of primarily local retail, restaurant and live entertainment offerings; University 
 City
District adjacent to University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University in West
Philadelphia which recently completed the University Square mixed-use project;
Downtown Oak Park/River Forest which has infused their downtown with a wide
variety of retail, restaurants and residential through new construction and
renovation, while providing ample public structured parking. 

 B. Urban Design 
 Objectives
With prime frontage along 53rd Street, the property is a key anchor parcel 
 and
signature development for the district as well as an important entry into 
 the
Harper Court area. The range of density and heights of surrounding blocks 
 in
Hyde Park and East Hyde Park should serve as good precedent for the massing,
materials and architectural detail/character with respect to the overall design 
 and
composition of any proposed development. Additionally, the Harper Court site
offers a variety of unique urban design opportunities outlined in the following
criteria to be considered with the redevelopment of the property. 

 •Gateway 
 Opportunity with new development at 53rd Street and Lake Park
Avenue corner, when paired with the current Border’s retail building 
 forms a
significant physical and ceremonial entry into the entire Harper Court and 
 53rd
Street Corridor

•Circulation and Connectivity to Neighborhood: improved circulation 
 and
access through a reopening/reconnection of Harper Ave from 52nd to 53rd as
well as a logical internal street and alley network

•Neighborhood space to provide a central gathering space or neighborhood
heart for special/seasonal events and serving as a key amenity and“address”
for many new retail/commercial opportunities

•Reinforce 53rd Street as Main Street through proper program/uses and
design (building, storefront, signage, streetscape etc), new development
should reinforce the pedestrian friendly 53rd Street retail corridor and serve 
 as
a key anchor to and participant in the Main Street experience

•Re-establish the“Heart of Hyde Park”at this key opportunity 
 site in Hyde
Park, Harper Court, through a quality, signature development
The project should be innovative in response to programmatic needs and be 
 of
high quality with respect to all aspects of design including site plan, architecture,
and interior and exterior finishes.

C. Program and Use Criteria
25
As part of a quality mixed-use development, the Owners have identified a list 
 of
preferred program uses and components to help ensure that the Proposed
Development becomes part of a vibrant neighborhood district. The program
should seek signature quality uses as described below:

•Retail and Entertainment
A creative mix of retail and entertainment tenants to achieve an active,
diverse, dynamic urban neighborhood center with increased daytime and
nighttime activity and destination appeal that builds and complements the
strong cultural destinations already present in the neighborhood
Retail/entertainment uses are encouraged at ground level in order to reinforce
an active, dynamic and pedestrian friendly urban neighborhood center.
Additionally, given the large area of the site and resulting potential for 
 larger
footprint spaces (8,000sf to 15,000sf), new development can attract a wider
range of retailers, including national anchors as well as local, boutique
specialty retailer(s). With the objective of attracting patrons from Hyde 
 Park
as well as the surrounding areas, a strong and varied mix of retailers will 
 help
activate the area and create a“destination”draw for the district.
Building on the new Park 52 Restaurant, Chant Restaurant and
Checkerboard Lounge venue, other live performance and signature
restaurant uses that appeal to a wide metropolitan market and create
additional draw and nighttime appeal to the area are encouraged.
Additionally, options that increase nighttime buzz and activity, especially 
 24-
hour dining (other than fast food), have also been suggested for the area.

•Office and Specialty Uses
Potential for quality office space to serve the area or other specialty uses
which increase the daytime population and visitation
Options to add quality office product with“above-the-store”professional 
 office
space and service businesses should be considered including Universityrelated
office, lodging and other business uses.

•Residential
A mix of apartment and condominium product, including a 20% affordable
housing component (for projects seeking TIF assistance), to increase the
vitality and vibrancy of the area. If possible that range should expand on 
 the
typical income levels considered affordable and nontraditional housing types
such as live/work.

Residential opportunities, located above the ground floor, are encouraged 
 to
increase the residential population in the district and enhance the
neighborhood vitality and vibrancy to support the retail and entertainment
Proposals may include rental and ownership units that appeal to a variety 
 of
markets including first time buyers, current area residents, University faculty
26
and staff and graduate students. Various product types should be explored
that expand the residential offerings in the neighborhood, such as“soft 
 loft”
units, stacked townhouses, condominiums, apartments etc. (See Exhibit I for
further details and requirements)

•Open Space and High Quality Urban Design
An important urban amenity and“address”for retailers, residents 
 and visitors
with areas specifically designed for cultural and civic uses/programming
fronted by activated building facades and uses

•Access and Circulation
Convenient circulation to and through the area with proximate parking to
promote retail activity, adequate service access to assure open streets and 
 a
minimum number of curb cuts that enhance pedestrian movement

•Development Range
Overall density range of 2.5 to 5 FAR with building heights commensurate to
adjacent blocks and surrounding context of Hyde Park / East Hyde Park.

•Parking
Parking sufficient to accommodate the City required standards for the
proposed development uses must be provided on site. Additional parking to
replace the lost parking of the City Lot (approx 170 spaces) as well as provide
an increase (up to 400 spaces total) to the 53rd Street Corridor public parking
is required. Options for proximate offsite location may also be considered.
TIF funding may be made available from the City’s 53rd Street TIF district 
 for
developers to complete the public parking requirement and help offset the
cost associated with its construction. Developers are responsible for the 
 cost
of all parking necessitated by their program uses.

D. Architectural Objectives
In conjunction with the design criteria, a number of basic architectural guidelines
have been outlined to preserve the strong architectural character and quality 
 of
the Hyde Park community:

•High Quality Design and Materials–high quality architecture 
 and design is
pervasive throughout Hyde Park and should serve as a benchmark for the
expectations of this redevelopment. Durable exterior wall materials,
particularly on the ground level façade, should be considered including 
 brick,
stone, ornamental terracotta and/or stucco that continue and reinforce the
area’s masonry traditions. Use of EIFS and other non-contextual materials 
 is
strongly discouraged. Unique and creative designs are welcome as long as
they present a high quality architecture and fit well within the neighborhood.
27
•Massing/Scale–building massing and scale should generally 
 be appropriate
to the context of the Hyde Park area, the size and character of the various
streets and adjacent structures. Key facades along major retail areas should
be designed to respond to pedestrian scale as well as promote a vibrant and
active pedestrian environment.

•Landscape and Streetscape–the site plan must comply with the 
 Chicago
Landscaped Ordinance. Additional trees, landscape parkways, green space,
planters, street furnishings, benches, bollards, way finding signage and other
streetscape elements are encouraged to enhance a comfortable pedestrian
environment.

•Other
Storefront Windows–maximize the transparency of ground floor, street
facing commercial facades and provide primary building entrances facing or
clearly visible from public sidewalks.
Awnings/Signage/Lighting/Streetscape–architectural features that
embellish the visual appeal of buildings as well as help create a more
pedestrian scaled, comfortable environment are encouraged. The use of a
cohesive palette of store awnings, signage, accent lighting and other
streetscape elements is encouraged.

E. Environmental Goals
The City expects that all proposals will employ, to the greatest practical 
 extent,
techniques that lessen the environmental impact of the project and result 
 in a
development that will be efficient to operate, require fewer resources to 
 build and
maintain, and that will protect building occupants’health and well 
 being.
Identified in Exhibit J are several important techniques for enhancing the
environmental benefits of development projects.

Green: The City of Chicago has developed standards for new construction
based largely on LEED’s six categories of environmental performance. 
 The City
encourages developers to incorporate such items as environmentally responsible
landscaping, permeable paving, optimal building orientation, low-e double-glazed
windows, fluorescent lighting, natural flooring materials, resource efficient 
 design,
Energy-Star products and appliances, and low-emitting interior finish products.
Information concerning the City’s green guidelines can be obtained from 
 DPD’s
Zoning Division.
See Exhibit J for additional requirements.

F. Construction Requirements
28
The selected developer must comply with the City of Chicago’s construction
requirements. During construction, at least 24 percent of qualified project 
 costs
must be paid to City-certified Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) and at 
 least
four percent must be paid to City-certified Woman Business Enterprises (WBEs).
In addition, Chicago residents must perform at least half of all constructionworker
hours. Prior to the start of construction, the selected developer will be
required to meet with a representative of the City’s monitoring and 
 compliance
division to review the developer’s plan for satisfying the City’s 
 construction hiring
and MBE/WBE goals.
29
 V. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS
All proposals should be responsive to the submission requirements described 
 below.

A. Pre-submittal Conference&amp;Site Tour
A pre-proposal meeting and site tour with the Owners’Agent is tentatively
scheduled for December 17, 2008 at 9:00 a.m. CT, at the United Church of Hyde
Park on 53rd Street. This meeting is for qualified development teams who intend
to submit a proposal and will require pre-registration by notifying the Owners’
Agent in advance. Attendance is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged as
this is the key opportunity to raise questions regarding the RFQ/RFP and tour 
 the
site. A confirmation notice for this meeting will be sent to all registered
developers.

Additional questions can be addressed to the James Wilson at
jwilson@cityofchicago.org or Tim Brangle at ccs@ccstudioinc.com. The Owners’
response will be returned by e-mail to all parties that have expressed interest 
 in
the RFQ/RFP. Questions will be taken by phone only for those parties that 
 do
not have access to e-mail. Responses to phoned-in questions will be distributed
to the other interested parties by e-mail (or by regular mail for those without 
 email
access).

B. Two-Part Submission Process
This process incorporates a two-part submission process. In the Part One-

 EXHIBIT 
 B Neighborhood History and Facts 

 Hyde Park/Kenwood 
 began in the 1850’s as a premier lakefront respite community with its 
 abundant parks and
grand residential offerings. Extending from Lake Michigan to Cottage Grove 
 Avenue, Hyde Park/Kenwood is
situated in a historic setting eight miles south of downtown Chicago. In 1893, 
 the area hosted the World’s
Columbian Exposition, one of the grandest and most revered world fairs of 
 all time, which established Chicago as
a world-class city and gave the area many significant features including the 
 current Museum of Science and
Industry building, the Midway Plaissance and lakefront parks. Around the same 
 time, the University of Chicago
was founded, establishing a key anchor for the neighborhood and setting an 
 intellectual character and
prominence that remains today.

The intellectual, cultural and artistic appeal of the neighborhood has always 
 proved attractive to residents and
visitors and is home to many renowned institutions including:
·University of Chicago
·Museum of Science and Industry, one of the most popular tourist attraction’s 
 in the Midwest with over 1.5
million visits annually
·University of Chicago Hospitals, repeatedly cited by U.S. News&amp;World Report as one of the best hospitals in
the U.S.
·Six theological seminaries
·A collection of cultural institutions including DuSable Museum of 
 African American History, Hyde Park Art
Center, Little Black Pearl Workshop, Oriental Institute, Court Theater, Muntu 
 Dance Theater, and the Robie
House.

Hyde Park/Kenwood is often described as small town living in the heart of 
 the City and is frequently recognized as
a national model of racial diversity and urban stability. Characteristics 
 of its population include:
·44,700 residents–2003 estimate, with steady growth since 
 1990
·Over 25% of households have household incomes over $75,000 (a 112% 
 increase since 1990)
·$62,697–Estimated 2003 Average Household Income, a 52% increase 
 since 1990
·$90,578 - Estimated 2003 Average Family Household Income
·People of color comprise about half the neighborhood
·Highly educated–close to 40% hold a master’s, professional 
 or doctorate degree and 22% hold bachelor’s
degree
·11,150 University of Chicago graduate and undergraduate students
·The University of Chicago and the University of Chicago Hospitals 
 employ close to 13,000 persons and
together are the largest employer on the south side of Chicago
·More than 60% of the University’s faculty and their families 
 live in Hyde Park/Kenwood, as well as a vast
majority of University students.

Today, the Hyde Park/Kenwood area continues to thrive as a diverse urban neighborhood 
 with a unique
community pride and strong city appeal. Ranked in 2000 and 2003 by Money Magazine 
 as one of the best places
to live in the U.S. and cited as a“top neighborhood”, Hyde Park/Kenwood 
 continues to experience steady growth
and property appreciation. Housing values have increased at rates higher than 
 the average for Chicago, and are
comparable to north side lakefront neighborhoods including Lakeview, Near 
 North Side and Lincoln Park. In
addition, the community has many excellent choices for education with some 
 of the best public and private
schools in Chicago including Ray and Murray Elementary Schools, Kenwood Academy 
 High School, University of
Chicago Laboratory Schools and the Ancona School.

The following land-use ordinances may also affect development of the property. 
 Booklets that
offer guidelines to these ordinances can be obtained from DPD in Room 1003 
 City Hall.
The Chicago Landscape Ordinance establishes standards for on-site and parkway 
 plantings.
Landscaping permits are obtained as part of the normal process of building 
 and zoning permit
applications except that a separate permit is required from the Bureau of 
 Forestry for actions
regarding trees in the public way.

The Chicago Parking Garage Ordinance establishes urban design standards for 
 free-standing
and accessory parking structures. An application for parking garage review 
 must be submitted
to the Department of Planning and Development before applying for a building 
 permit.
The Chicago Townhouse Ordinance establishes special zoning requirements for 
 townhouse
developments (two or more single family dwellings that share party walls). 
 Townhouse permits
are obtained as part of the zoning process.

Stormwater Management Ordinance

The Stormwater Management Ordinance takes affect on January 1, 2008. Regulated
developments include projects that disturb over 15,000 square feet of land 
 or projects that will
create an at-grade impervious surface of 7,500 square feet or more. The developer 
 of such
projects will be required to prepare a stormwater management plan for submittal 
 to the City for
review. The plan must include rate control (by using the City’s calculations 
 guideline or by
using Chicago vortex restrictors) and volume control (by using stormwater 
 BMPs to capture up
to 0.5 inch of rain from impervious areas or by achieving a 15 percent reduction 
 in impervious
surfaces from an established baseline).

More information concerning the stormwater management ordinance can be obtained 
 from the
Chicago Center for Green Technology at 312-746-9642 (445 N. Sacramento Blvd.) 
 or from
CGGT’s website at www.cityofchicago.org/environment/GreenTech. CGGT

 Summary 

 This report 
 presents the results of the Carnow, Conibear&amp;Assoc., Ltd. (Carnow Conibear)
investigation associated with a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) 
 of the Harper
Court property located at 5201 to 5225 South Harper Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 
 (the subject site).
The Phase I ESA consisted of a visual site inspection, a site historical review, 
 a review of public
record documents, and a review of government agency records. The Phase I ESA 
 was
conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials 
 Standard E 1527-
05 (Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental 
 Site
Assessment Process).
Canow Conibear conducted a visual inspection of the subject site on March 
 20, 2008. The
subject site consists of an irregularly shaped parcel of approximately 73,344 
 square feet. Four
2-story concrete and masonry buildings occupy the subject site along with 
 a brick-paved court
yard, small landscaped areas, and a paved parking lot. The subject site is 
 bounded on the
north by East 52nd Street, beyond which are residential properties and a filling 
 station to the
northeast; on the east by an alley beyond which are a fast food establishment 
 and a City
parking lot; on the south by an alley, beyond which are commercial and professional
businesses; and on the west by residential and commercial properties.
The investigation indicated that the subject site has historically been developed 
 as a commercial
and residential neighborhood since at least 1925. The current site buildings 
 were constructed
between 1965 and 1967. The investigation indicated that the site buildings 
 have always been
leased as commercial storefronts, restaurants, and offices.
The subject site was not listed in the environmental database consulted for 
 this ESA. Based
upon the current information, this assessment has revealed the following evidence 
 of
recognized environmental conditions (RECs) in connection with the subject 
 site:
•An auto repair shop reportedly was present on the current 5211 South 
 Harper Avenue
portion of the subject site in 1950. Petroleum products, additives, solvents, 
 and other
chemicals are commonly used in such establishments. Carnow Conibear believes 
 that
this represents a REC.
•A filling station was reportedly present on the property east adjacent 
 to the 5201 South
Harper Avenue portion of the subject site from at least 1975 to 1989. Given 
 that there is
little information available about this facility, Carnow Conibear believes 
 that this
represents a REC.
•In September 2000 and August 2002, LUST incidents occurred at a filling 
 station located
less than 1/8 mile to the northeast of the subject site. The releases were 
 reportedly
cleaned up, with NFR letters issued for the incidents. Carnow Conibear believes 
 that the
LUST incidents at this filling station represent a historic REC to the subject 
 site.
The Executive Summary is intended to provide a brief summary of the findings 
 of the recent site
investigation. The entire report must be read in order to fully understand 
 the findings and
potential environmental concerns associated with the subject site; therefore, 
 the Executive
Summary should not be substituted in lieu of reading the entire report. 

 2.0 Introduction 

 2.1 Purpose
Lake Park Associates retained Carnow Conibear to perform a Phase I Environmental 
 Site
Assessment (ESA) of the 73,344-square-foot property located at 5201 to 5225 
 South Harper
Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The purpose of the Phase I ESA was to obtain 
 and evaluate
information related to any recognized environmental conditions (RECs) that 
 might be present on
the subject site.

2.2 Detailed Scope of Service
The Phase I ESA was performed for the subject site in accordance with the 
 current American
Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard E 1527-05 (Standard Practice 
 for Environmental
Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process). The following 
 activities
were conducted:
?? A visual investigation of the subject site;
?? Interview with the site representative Ms. Leslie Cole-Morgan (site Executive 
 Director);
?? Interview with the ESA user Mr. Mark Chrisman (User Questionnaire);
?? Interview with the local fire department;
?? Review of historic topographic and floodplain maps;
?? Review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps;
?? Review of aerial photographs;
?? Review of Sanborn maps;
?? Review of accessible government/public records;
?? Review of local, state and federal databases; and
?? A limited inspection of the adjacent properties from vantage points accessible 
 to the
public.

2.3 Significant Assumptions
With respect to the ASTM standard, there were no significant assumptions associated 
 with this
Phase I ESA.

2.4 Limitations and Exceptions
With respect to the ASTM standard, there were limitations associated with 
 this Phase I ESA.
Not all of the responses to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests 
 have been received
from all of the government agencies within the time frame for issuance of 
 this report to the
client.

2.5 Special Terms and Conditions
With respect to the ASTM standard, there were no special terms or conditions 
 involved in this
Phase I ESA. 

 2.6 User Reliance
No environmental site assessment can wholly eliminate uncertainty regarding 
 the potential for
RECs in connection with a property. This Phase I ESA, in accordance to ASTM 
 Standard E
1527-05, is intended to reduce, but not eliminate, uncertainty regarding the 
 potential for RECs
for the subject site, given reasonable limits in time and cost. Based solely 
 upon the work
performed in connection with this Phase I ESA Report, which has taken into 
 account commonly
known and reasonably ascertainable information, and subject to all conditions 
 and exceptions
set forth in this report, the following entity can rely on this report when 
 assessing environmental
conditions pertaining to the subject site:
Lake Park Associates
1501 South Indiana, Unit 1
Chicago, Illinois 60605
No other party may rely on this Phase I ESA without the prior express written 
 consent of
Conow Conibear.

 4.0 User Provided 
 Information
ASTM Standard E 1527-05 requires the user of a Phase I ESA to provide the 
 environmental
professional with any information that could be deemed useful in identifying 
 RECs. The user of
this Phase I ESA is Mr. Mark Chrisman of Lake Park Associates. The User Questionnaire,
which was completed by Mr. Chrisman and returned to Carnow Conibear on March 
 25, 2008,
can be reviewed in Appendix D.

4.1 Title Records

A real title search including any deeds, easements, leases, restrictions, 
 and covenants is
sometimes included in Phase I Environmental Site Assessments to help identify 
 past site uses
and potential environmental concerns. The user of this Phase I ESA, Mr. Mark 
 Chrisman, did
not provide Carnow Conibear with title search documents. However, a title 
 search is not
required by ASTM if other historical sources of information provide the necessary 
 information.
Carnow Conibear believes that the data collected during the Phase I ESA provided 
 sufficient
information about the site.

4.2 Environmental Liens or Activity and Use Limitations

 and misspellings reported to the governmental agencies.
* Asterisks indicate supplemental databases that are not required to be searched 
 by ASTM standards.
Examination of other properties listed within ASTM search distances from the 
 subject site
determined that they would not affect the subject site due to distance from 
 the subject site.
Specific information regarding all of the listings within the ASTM minimum 
 search distances can
be found in the complete EDR report, which is included as Appendix E-2.
5.1.3 EDR Orphan Sites
There were two orphan sites (listed sites that could not be mapped due to 
 poor or inadequate
address information) identified during the database search. Further investigation 
 determined
that one of these sites is several city blocks from the subject site. Due 
 to the distance, Carnow
Conibear believes that this site/listing does not represent an environmental 
 concern to the
subject site at this time. The other orphan site listing contains insufficient 
 information to locate
the property. The complete orphan site list is included in Appendix E-2.

5.2 Additional Environmental Record Sources

5.2.1 Local Government Agencies
Carnow Conibear submitted FOIA requests to local agencies in an effort to 
 obtain information
regarding the subject site. Copies of the state and local requests and responses 
 can be found
in Appendix E-1. The following agencies were contacted 

 •City 
 of Chicago Department of Environment, Chicago, Illinois
Carnow Conibear is currently awaiting a response from this agency.
•City of Chicago Department of Buildings, Chicago, Illinois
Carnow Conibear received a response from this agency which contains no records 
 of an
environmental nature.

5.3 Physical Setting Sources

5.3.1 Surface Water Characteristics
The topography of the subject site and adjacent properties is relatively level, 
 with no significant
natural relief features. The nearest significant water body is Lake Michigan 
 approximately 2,200
feet east of the subject site. According to the USGS 7.5-minute topographic 
 map of the Jackson
Park, Illinois quadrangle (revised 1998) accessed by EDR, the elevation in 
 the vicinity of the
subject site is approximately 592 feet above mean sea level.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate Map for the subject 
 site,
Community-Panel Number 170074 0090B (June 1, 1981), shows that the subject 
 site is
designated as Zone C, area of minimal flooding. No standing bodies of water 
 nor wetland
vegetation was observed during the recent site inspection.
5.3.2 Subsurface Geological Characteristics

CCA retained EDR to conduct a search of available geological information for 
 the subject site
and surrounding properties. A listing of EDR’s geological sources can 
 be reviewed in Appendix
E-2. The rock stratigraphic unit surrounding the subject site is Paleozoic 
 Era, Silurian System,
Middle Silurian (Niagoaran) Series; the geologic age identification is of 
 the Stratified Sequence
category.
Carnow Conibear reviewed Plate 1 of the ISGS Circular, Potential for Contamination 
 of Shallow
Aquifers in Illinois, indicating that the regional geologic materials underlying 
 the subject site are
designated as“B1,”which is described as sand and gravel less 
 than 20 feet thick over relatively
impermeable till or bedrock (Berg, ct al. 1984).

5.3.3 Groundwater Characteristics
No groundwater investigation data for the subject site or immediately adjacent 
 properties was
available. Therefore, Carnow Conibear was unable to determine groundwater 
 flow direction for
the subject site. 
Two primary aquifers are present in the Chicago metropolitan region. These 
 aquifers are the
shallow dolomite aquifer (which includes the bedrock strata directly underlying 
 the
unconsolidated glacial sediments) and the deep Cambrian-Ordovician Aquifer 
 (which consists
predominately of sandstone). The latter unit is isolated from the shallow 
 dolomite aquifer by up
to 250 feet of shale. Discontinuous glacial aquifers are also present in the 
 Chicago region in the
form of lacustrine sands (Dolton Member of the Equality Formation) and outwash 
 sand and
gravel of the Henry and Wedron Formations (Willman, 1971). The City of Chicago 
 has a
groundwater ordinance that prohibits the installation and use of potable water 
 supply wells.

5.4 Historical Use Information
5.4.1 Aerial Photographs
Historical aerial photographs of the subject site and surrounding areas were 
 reviewed for the
years 1952, 1963, 1972, 1988, 1998, and 2002 (see Appendix F-1). Carnow Conibear
reviewed the aerial photographs for indications of the previous uses of the 
 subject site and
surrounding areas in an effort to identify potential environmental concerns. 
 The following is a

Review of the Sanborn maps did not reveal any potential environment concerns 
 with regard to
the subject site except for the existence of an auto repair shop in the rear 
 of 5215 South Harper
in 1950 and a filling station east adjacent to 5201 South Harper from 1975 
 through 1989
(approximate locations are shown in Appendix B).
5.4.3 Historic Maps
According to the USGS topographic map of Jackson Park, Illinois the subject 
 site is located in
Section 11, Township 38 North, Range 14 East of the Third Principal Meridian 
 in Cook County,
Illinois. Carnow Conibear reviewed the historical USGS map for the year 1963 
 (photorevised
1972) looking for any indication of past uses of the subject site. The 1963

5.4.4 Polk City Directory for 1928
A search of an electronic copy of the 1928 Polk City Directory for Chicago 
 revealed no
indications of possible hazardous sites or RECs on the subject site or adjacent 
 properties. 

 6.0 Site Reconaissance 

 6.1 Methodology 
 and Limiting Conditions
A visual inspection was conducted on the subject site on March 20, 2008 by 
 Larry Lueck of
Carnow Conibear. Conditions during the visit were favorable, with sunny weather. 
 Carnow
Conibear first inspected the buildings with Ms. Cole-Morgan, the site manager, 
 then toured the
outdoor portions of the subject site and adjacent properties. Photographs 
 taken during the
reconnaissance can be viewed in Appendix C.

6.2 General Site Setting
The subject site is located in a mixed commercial/residential area of Hyde 
 Park in Chicago,
Illinois. The site is bounded by East 52nd Street on the north, a fast food 
 establishment and a
city-owned parking lot on the east, an alley and commercial buildings on the 
 south, and
residential properties on the west. Appendix B depicts the Site Plan and adjacent 
 properties.

6.3 Exterior Observation 
The subject site is developed with four 2-story buildings of concrete and 
 masonry on slabs with
no basements, a brick-paved courtyard, and an asphalt-paved parking lot. The 
 following table
summarizes the exterior site observations:
Site Observations
Lot Size 73,344 square feet
Shape of Parcel(s) irregular
Number of Buildings on Site 4
Exterior Improvements brick-paved courtyard and asphalt-paved parking lot
Pools of Liquid none
Drums, Hazardous Material or
Petroleum/Unidentified Substance Containers
none
Stained Soil or Pavement none
Stressed Vegetation none
Wells none
Solid Waste or Fill Material none
Pits, Ponds, Lagoons, Surface Water, Waste
Water
none
Septic Systems none
Railroad Tracks none
Pipeline(s) none

6.4 Interior Observations
The subject site buildings are currently occupied by various shops, restaurants, 
 and
professional offices, with some vacancies (see details of site manager interview 
 documentation
in Appendix D). Each building consists of two floors the lower of which is 
 garden style a few
feet below surrounding grade. The second floors of three buildings have vaulted 
 ceilings, while
open lofts are built into the second floor of the fourth building. Heating 
 is provided by natural
gas units, many of which also provide the air conditioning. Several units 
 have window air
conditioners in place of the combined HVACs.

6.5 Hazardous Substances and/or Chemical Storage
On May 19, 1980, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published, 
 in the Federal
Register, the first phase of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 
 1980 RCRA
Laws. RCRA defines a hazardous waste as a solid waste that may cause or significantly
contribute to serious illness or death, or that poses a substantial threat 
 to human health or the
environment when improperly managed. No hazardous waste was observed on the 
 subject
site. There is small cleaning establishment across South Harper Avenue southwest 
 from the
5225 building with a“Dry Cleaning”sign in the window. However, 
 Ms. Cole-Morgan, the
manager of the facility, stated to Carnow Conibear that no dry cleaning is 
 done on the premises.
6.6 Above Ground and Underground Storage Tanks and Pipelines

6.6.1 On-Site
No above ground or underground storage tanks, or evidence for same, were observed 
 on the
subject site

6.6.2 Adjacent Properties
No evidence of the presence of UST, ASTs, or pipelines was observed on the 
 immediately
adjacent portions of the bordering properties from publicly accessible vantage 
 points. Review of
IEPA’s Leaking Underground Storage Tank Incident Tracking (L.I.T.) database 
 found LUST
incidents 20021147, 901776, and 20001861 from September 2000 and August 2002 
 listed for
the northeast adjacent filling station property, across East 52nd Street. 
 The extent of the soil
contamination related to these incidents is unknown at this time. The facility 
 is currently active.

6.7 Suspected Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB)-Containing Equipment
The Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) of 1976 mandates the regulation of 
 electrical
transformers containing toxic substances known as polychlorinated biphenyls 
 (PCBs). Prior to
1976, PCB transformers were manufactured and placed into service by various 
 electric utility
companies without government regulation. Regulations promulgated under TSCA 
 require that
transformers containing PCBs be marked as such. Subsequently, a PCB Ban Rule 
 was enacted
in 1979 to eliminate the use of PCBs in transformers. There are unmarked, 
 locked metal
cabinets which Carnow Conibear believes to contain transformers located immediately 
 east of
the southeast corner of the 5211 building and immediately north of the 5201 
 building. Both
cabinets appeared to be in good condition with no signs of leaking. There 
 are several
transformers on two utility poles located near the southeast corner of the 
 site parking lot east of
the 5210 building but these also appeared to be in good condition with no 
 leaking. All of these
transformers probably belong to Commonwealth Edison. 

 7.0 Interviews 

 7.1 Interviews 
 with the Site Managers
Carnow Conibear was informed that the subject site is currently owned by the 
 Harper Court
Foundation. Carnow Conibear conducted an in-person interview with Ms. Leslie 
 Cole-Morgan
the Executive Director of the Foundation. Ms. Cole-Morgan has approximately 
 6 years
experience as site manager and approximately 30 years living in the neighborhood. 
 Ms. Cole-
Morgan stated that Harper Court was constructed very much in its present configuration
between 1965 and 1967 as part of a large-scale urban renewal of the neighborhood 
 and has
undergone no significant renovation since then. There is no hydraulic equipment 
 on the subject
site. Ms. Cole-Morgan indicated that there were no flooding or leaking issues 
 in the building,
although water from a flash flood once damaged some of the lower level floors 
 because it
temporarily overwhelmed the drainage system. No hazardous waste is generated 
 or stored on
site. Ms. Cole-Morgan explained that there is a subsurface lift system under 
 a hatch in the
sidewalk off the southwest corner of the 5201 building that brings waste water 
 and sewage up to
the level of the city sewer system.

7.2 Interview with Site Workers
No interviews were conducted with site workers.

7.3 Interviews with Local Government Officials
The Chicago Fire Department does not allow its personnel to give interviews 
 to members of the
public without specific permission from headquarters. Therefore, on March 
 25, 2008, Carnow,
Conibear sent an email request for information on the Harper Court site to 
 Mr. Larry Langford,
Chicago Fire Department Director of Public Information and Media Affairs. 
 Mr. Langford’s email
response suggested that it would be better for Carnow, Conibear to contact 
 the Chicago
Department of Environment with requests for environmental information (see 
 Section 5.2.1). A
copy of both emails is provided in Appendix D. 

 8.0 Findings 

 Based on the 
 findings of this Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, within the scope of 
 this
investigation and pursuant to the requirements of ASTM Standard Practice E 
 1527-05, the
following findings are presented below:
•An auto repair shop reportedly was present on the current 5211 South 
 Harper Avenue
portion of the subject site in 1950. Petroleum products, additives, solvents, 
 and other
chemicals are commonly used in such establishments. Carnow Conibear believes 
 that
this represents a REC.
•A filling station was reportedly present on the property east adjacent 
 to the 5201 South
Harper Avenue portion of the subject site from at least 1975 to 1989. Given 
 that there is
little information available about this facility, Carnow Conibear believes 
 that this
represents a REC.
•In September 2000 and August 2002, leaking underground storage tank 
 (LUST)
incidents occurred at a filling station located less than 1/8 mile to the 
 northeast of the
subject site. Although the releases were reportedly cleaned up (NFR letters 
 were issued
for these incidents), Carnow Conibear believes that the nearby presence of 
 this facility
represents a REC to the subject site. 

 9.0 Opinion 

 Based on the 
 findings of this Phase I ESA, within the scope of this investigation and pursuant 
 to
the requirements of ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-05, this section presents 
 Carnow
Conibear’s opinion of environmental impacts on the subject site.

9.1 Recognized Environmental Conditions
?? An auto repair shop was present on the current 5211 South Harper Avenue 
 portion of
the subject site in 1950. Petroleum products, additives, solvents, and other 
 chemicals
are commonly used in such establishments. Carnow Conibear believes that this
represents a REC to the subject property.

?? A filling station was present on the property east adjacent to the 5201 
 South Harper
Avenue portion of the subject site from at least 1975 to 1989. Given that 
 there is little
information available about this facility, Carnow Conibear believes that this 
 represents a
REC to the subject property.

9.2 Historical Recognized Environmental Conditions
•In September 2000 and August 2002, LUST incidents occurred at a filling 
 station
located less than 1/8 mile to the northeast of the subject site. The releases 
 were
reportedly cleaned up, with NFR letters issued for the incidents. Carnow Conibear
believes that the LUST incidents at this filling station represent a historic 
 REC to the
subject site.

9.3 De Minimis Conditions
•Several transformers located on the perimeter of the subject site 
 could potentially
contain PCBs. A leak would result in a hazardous condition.

9.4 Business Risk
•None

9.3 Data Gaps
When conducting a Phase I ESA investigation, an environmental professionals’ability to identify
RECs is sometimes limited due to data gaps. Data gaps are not inherently significant, 
 but can
be substantive to a report if other information and/or professional experience 
 raise reasonable
concerns regarding the data gap.
One common type of data gap is data failure–the inability to find 
 sources to adequately identify
the historical uses of the subject site. ASTM 1527-05 requires that historical 
 uses of a property
be identified in five year intervals back to 1940 or the property’s 
 first development, whichever is
earlier, as long as the information is reasonably ascertainable. If specific 
 use of the property
appears unchanged over a period of longer than five years, then research of 
 the use of the
property during intervening years is not required.
This investigation has identified sources of information from 1925, 1928, 
 1950, 1952, 1963,
1972, 1975, 1988, 1989, 1992, 1998, and 2002. This information suggests that 
 the site has
been developed with urban structures since at least 1925. The current subject 
 site buildings
were constructed between 1965 and 1967 and have been leased in units for stores, 
 restaurants
and commercial office space since they opened.
Carnow Conibear believes based on professional experience, adequate historical 
 information on
the site was obtained, and the data failure does not represent a significant 
 data gap to the
study. 

 10.0 Conclusion 

 Carnow Conibear 
 has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, in conformance
with the scope and limitations of the current ASTM Practice E 1527, of the 
 site located at 5201
to 5225 South Harper Avenue in Chicago, Illinois (the subject site). Any exceptions 
 to, or
deletions from, the practice are described in Section 2.4 of this report. 
 This assessment has
revealed the following recognized environmental conditions (RECs) in connection 
 with the
subject site:
•An auto repair shop was present on the current 5211 South Harper Avenue 
 portion of
the subject site in 1950. Petroleum products, additives, solvents, and other 
 chemicals
are commonly used in such establishments. Carnow Conibear believes that this
represents a historical REC.
•A filling station was present on the property east adjacent to the 
 5201 South Harper
Avenue portion of the subject site from at least 1975 to 1989. Given that 
 there is little
information available about this facility, Carnow Conibear believes that this 
 represents a
historical REC.
•In September 2000 and August 2002, LUST incidents occurred at a filling 
 station located
less than 1/8 mile to the northeast of the subject site. The releases were 
 reportedly
cleaned up, with NFR letters issued for the incidents. Carnow Conibear believes 
 that the
LUST incidents at this filling station represent a historic REC to the subject 
 site.
Carnow Conibear has applied prevailing industry standards and reasonable judgment 
 and effort
within the scope of work outlined in Carnow Conibear’s proposal, while 
 conducting the Phase I
ESA. The standards, judgment, and effort used by Carnow Conibear personnel 
 to investigate,
assess, and determine the presence of potential environmental hazards and 
 liabilities
associated with the site are consistent with the requirements outlined in 
 the current ASTM
Standards No. E1527. Carnow Conibear makes no warranty, express or implied, 
 that the
findings and interpretations in this report are a complete representation 
 of the environmental
hazards and liabilities, associated with the site. There may be unrecorded 
 information or
documentation from previous owners or tenants that is unattainable and may 
 be proprietary,
legally protected, or unavailable through government regulatory services. 

 11.0 Deviations 

 Carnow Conibear 
 has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, in conformance
with the scope and limitations of the current ASTM Practice E 1527, of the 
 site located at 5201
to 5225 South Harper Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. Any exceptions to, or deletions 
 from, the
practice are described in Section 2.2 of this report. No other significant 
 deviations are noted
with this report. 

 The Phase I 
 ESA was performed for the subject site in accordance with the current American
Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard E 1527-05 (Standard Practice 
 for Environmental
Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process).
CCA recommends, at a minimum, that a Phase II Environmental Assessment with 
 subsurface
soil sampling be conducted on portions of the subject site to investigate 
 the possibility of
impacts from the current and historical RECs identified in this Phase I ESA.

 14.0 Signature 
 and Qualifications of the Environment [image form] 

_________________________________________

 

 Exhibit 
 J 

 Environmental Goals: The City expects that all proposals 
 will employ, to the greatest
practical extent, techniques that lessen the environmental impact of the project 
 and result in a
development that will be efficient to operate, require fewer resources to 
 build and maintain,
and that will protect building occupants’health and well-being. Identified 
 below are several
important techniques for enhancing the environmental benefits of development 
 projects.

·Roof Systems: Environmentally responsible roof systems protect our 
 valuable
water resources and help to mitigate the urban heat-island effect. Green roofs
provide the greatest benefits but hard-surfaced roof systems with a high
reflectivity rating, such as Energy Star-rated roof surfaces, also help the
environment.

A green roof system typically consists of a waterproof and root-repellant
membrane, a drainage system, filter cloth, a lightweight growing medium and
maintenance-free vegetation. Green roof systems may be modular or each
component may be installed separately.

·LEED Certification: The U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED 
 (Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System™provides
national standards for the development of high performance, environmentally
sustainable buildings. Properties submitted for LEED certification are rated
according to environmental performance in six categories: sustainable sites,
water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor
environmental quality, and i nnovation and design process.

Properties are awarded points for meeting or exceeding the requirements of 
 each
category. Those properties that meet the minimum requirements receive LEED
Certification; properties that exceed the minimum requirements can achieve
Silver, Gold, or Platinum ratings. The U.S. Green Building Council’s 
 website is
www.usgbc.org.

·Green Residential Guidelines: The City of Chicago has developed standards 
 for
residential construction based largely on LEED’s six categories of environmental
performance. The City encourages residential developers to incorporate such
items as environmentally responsible landscaping, permeable paving, optimal
building orientation, low-e double-glazed windows, flourescent lighting, natural
flooring materials, resource efficient design, Energy-Star products and
appliances, and low-emitting interior finish products. Information concerning 
 the
City’s green residential guidelines can be obtained from DPD’s 
 Zoning Division,
Room 1003 City Hall.

·Energy Star: The Energy Star program is administered by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The program helps to protect the
environment by promoting superior energy efficiency. The program rates the
energy efficiency of building products, equipment, and appliances as well 
 as the
overall energy efficiency of newly constructed residential buildings of less 
 than
four stories. Products and buildings that achieve a high level of efficiency 
 are
awarded an Energy Star label. The EPA’s Energy Star website is
www.energystar.gov.

·Stormwater Management: The City of Chicago promotes better management 
 of
stormwater runoff to protect our water resources, and the minimal requirements
for stormwater management are prescribed in the Stormwater Management
Ordinance described previously. All responses to the RFP are encouraged to
exceed these minimum requirements by employing such features as natural
landscaping, permeable paving, drainage swales, and naturalized detention
basins. A guide to stormwater best management practices can be obtained from
DPD in Room 1003 City Hall or can be downloaded from the CGGT website (see
below).

Proposals that incorporate the preceding environmental strategies will be 
 given
favorable consideration. DPD has also established the following minimum requirements
for proposals that request public assistance (such as land price write-down, 
 TIF or other
financial assistance) or that seek Planned Development (PD) status. [delete 
 following
uses not included in this RFP]

·Residential developments with four or more dwelling units where 20 
 percent or
fewer of the units are affordable : If the proposal requests a land price 
 write-down,
TIF assistance, or Department of Housing (DOH) financial assistance then it
must include a green roof system on at least 50 percent of all flat roof surfaces
and achieve Energy Star building certification, or alternatively only achieve 
 LEED
certification. If the proposal requests other forms of public assistance, 
 then a
green roof system on at least 50 percent of all flat roof surfaces and Energy 
 Star
building certification are required. If the proposal only seeks PD status, 
 then a
green roof on at least 25 percent of all flat roof surfaces is required. In 
 all cases,
whenever a green roof covers less than 100 percent of flat roof surfaces, 
 then
the remainder must be covered by an Energy Star-rated surface.

·Residential developments with less than four dwelling units or developments 
 that
include townhouses or single family houses, and where 20 percent or fewer 
 of
the units are affordable: All such proposals that seek a land price write-down, 
 TIF
assistance or DOH financial assistance are required to achieve either Energy
Star or LEED building certification.

·Residential developments of any type or size where more than 20 percent 
 of the
units are affordable: All such proposals are required to satisfy DOH’s
environmental requirements (DPD can provide this information).

·Industrial: Industrial projects that request a land price write-down, 
 TIF assistance,
or Empowerment Zone grants have two options: incorporate an Energy Starrated
roof surface and achieve LEED certification, or install a green roof on 10
percent of all flat roof surfaces. Industrial projects that request other 
 forms of
public assistance (6b assessment reduction, industrial revenue bond, or
Enterprise Zone Facility bond) are required to provide a green roof system 
 on at
least 10 percent of all flat roof surfaces or an Energy Star-rated roof surface 
 on
100 percent of all flat roof surfaces. In all cases, whenever a green roof 
 covers
less than 100 percent of all flat roof surfaces, then the remainder must be
covered by an Energy Star-rated surface.

·Retail developments with a building footprint of 10,000 square feet 
 or larger:
Proposals that request a land price write-down, TIF assistance, or Empowerment
Zone grant have two options: include a green roof on 75 percent of all flat 
 roof
surfaces or include a green roof on 50 percent of all flat roof surfaces and
achieve LEED certification. Proposals that seek o ther forms of public assistance
have the following two options: include a green roof over 50 percent of all 
 flat roof
surfaces or include a green roof on 25 percent of all flat roof surfaces and
achieve LEED certification. Proposals that only seek PD status are required 
 to
provide a green roof on at least 50 percent of all flat roof surfaces. In 
 all cases,
whenever a green roof covers less than 100 percent of all flat roof surfaces, 
 then
the remainder must be covered by an Energy Star-rated surface. Big box retail
developments with a building footprint larger than 100,000 square feet must
reduce the site’s stormwater run-off coefficient.

·Retail developments with a building footprint smaller than 10,000 
 square feet:
Proposals that request a land price write-down, TIF assistance, or Empowerment
Zone grant have two options: include a green roof on 25 percent of all flat 
 roof
surfaces or achieve LEED certification. The portion of flat roof surfaces 
 not
employing a green roof system must be covered by an Energy Star-rated
surface. Proposals that seek other forms of public assistance or PD status 
 must
provide an Energy Star-rated roof surface over the entire roof.

·Office buildings 80 feet or higher: Proposals that request a land 
 write -down, TIF
assistance, or Empowerment Zone grant must provide a green roof on 100
percent of all flat roof surfaces. Proposals that seek other forms of public
assistance must provide a green roof on 75 percent of all flat roof surfaces.
Proposals that only seek PD status are required to provide a green roof on 
 at
least 50 percent of all flat roof surfaces. Whenever a green roof covers less 
 than
100 percent of all flat roof surfaces, then the remainder must be covered 
 by an
Energy Star-rated surface. 

 ·Office 
 buildings lower than 80 feet: Proposals that request a land write-down,
TIF assistance or Empowerment Zone grant have two options: provide a green
roof on 50 percent of all flat roof surfaces and an Energy Star-rated roof 
 on the
remainder, or provide an Energy Star-rated roof on the entire roof surface 
 and
achieve LEED certification. Proposals that seek other forms of public assistance
must provide an Energy Star-rated roof on the entire roof surface.

·Community Centers and Schools: All proposals that seek PD status 
 have two
options: provide a green roof on 25 percent of all flat roof surfaces, or 
 provide a
green roof on 10 percent of all flat roof surfaces and achieve LEED certification.
Whenever a green roof covers less than 100 percent of all flat roof surfaces, 
 then
the remainder must be covered by an Energy Star-rated surface. 

 [Delete the 
 following two paragraphs if the RFP property is vacant land.]
The preceding environmental goals have been largely developed for new
construction projects. Rehabilitation projects will be expected to achieve 
 these
goals to the greatest practical extent, and the Department of Planning and
Development will advise the selected applicant on the means to achieve
meaningful environmental benefits.

A green roof structural feasibility report will be required for rehabilitation 
 projects,
and where feasible the same green roof requirements will be applied. If the
feasibility report indicates that the existing roof system cannot support 
 a green
surface, DPD will offer alternative techniques for reducing the heat-island 
 effect
and controlling runoff.

The department encourages all applicants to contact the Chicago Center for
Green Technology at 312-746-9642 (445 N. Sacramento Blvd.) or visit CGGT’s
website at www.cityofchicago.org/environment/GreenTech. CGGT offers a
wealth of information concerning green building techniques and products, LEED
Certification, the Energy Star program, and stormwater management.
