Limited 2.0 Eni-LASMO OIL PAKISTAN LTD 2.1 KADANWARI GAS PROCESSING FACILITY: MODIFICATION OF WELLHEAD COMPRESSION&amp;K-10 PIPING LASMO decided to modify the existing Kadanwari Gas Processing Facility. The existing facility is such that seven (7) wells (i.e. K-1, K-6, K-7, K-9, K-10, K-11 and K-12) are operating to serve Kadanwari Central Processing Facility. K-1 and K-6 low pressure well are directly connected with the low pressure manifold, while K-7&amp;K-9 are also connected to the same low pressure manifold via south valve station. The low pressure streams were compressed through Front-End Compressor installed in processing facility to feed the processing facility. High pressure wells K-10&amp;K-12 were connected to high pressure manifold. The combined high pressure streams was connected to central processing facility. ? Wellhead Compression Instead of using the existing Front-End Compressor in central processing facility, it was decided to install two wellhead rental compressor packages, one at K-1 fence area and other at K-9 fence area. Each compressor package consisted of a slug catcher, blow case and compressor. The K-6 stream is combined with K-1 stream in K-1 fence area then it has been directed to rental compressor package. After separator, gas stream is directed towards compressor and water is sent to blow case where it is pressurized by discharge stream of compressor. The pressurized water has been injected into the discharge of compressor then combined stream has been connected high pressure manifold. Similarly, K-1 stream is combined with K-9 stream in K-9 fence area then it has been directed to other rental compressor package. The compressed stream with water re-injection has also been connected with the high pressure manifold. For the above changes in system, some piping modification has been done in K-1&amp;K-9 wellhead fence area as well as processing facility area for the connection of high pressure streams from rental compressor package to high pressure manifold. ? K-10 Piping Modifications LASMO also increased the throughput of K-10 by reducing wellhead pressure. For this modification, K-11&amp;K-12 are still connected with the high pressure manifold via north valve station i.e. bypassing of K-10. A new separate flow line of dia 10”duplex steel (about 6 KM) has been installed from K-10 to low pressure manifold. The dia 10”has been laid by using 3.7 KM line to be recovered from K-3, 13 KM recovered line from K-1&amp;1.0 KM new pipe from inventory. Some modifications has been done in K-10 well site fence area i.e. bypassing of K- 10 and new wellhead piping for new separate flow line as well as connection of 10”flow line with the existing low pressure manifold has been connected to existing Front-End Compressor. Some instrumentation has also been installed to monitor the rental compressor from central control room at Kadanwari central processing facility.

 Zero Discharge of Treated Effluent Achieved NRL has achieved zero discharge of its treated effluent, which means even the otherwise safe treated effluent which is generated within the Refinery is no longer discharged outside the Refinery premises. This has been possible due to use of superior technology as well as the untiring efforts of the Management and technical personnel of the Company in that direction. The Effluent treatment Plant (ETP) at NRL is equipped with modern and latest treatment facilities including chemical, biological and tertiary treatment facilities. The ETP includes a three-stage oil recovery system from the wastewater generated during refinery operations and high efficiency centrifuge for recovering oil from the oily sludge. Tertiary treatment is done by using pressure sand filters as well as activated carbon filters. Because of the latest technology used in the ETP, quality of treated effluent coming out of ETP is very good, which means that the pollutant levels are very less making it suitable for use for various other purposes. The treated effluent is used as filter backwash in the Cooling Tower, an integrated unit which forms part of the Refinery operations. It is also used for gardening inside the Refinery premises and for watering the green belt surrounding the Refinery. Well maintained gardens at various locations inside the Refinery premises is a common sight and inter-unit competitions for best housekeeping of respective plants are often held to encourage such practices. The green belt surrounding the Refinery comprises of 70 hectares of land, which, other than retaining and enhancing the greenery, renders a perfect natural barrier to the industrial noise and minor air pollutants from reaching the immediate surroundings, both human population and the rich flora and fauna.To facilitate the above process of using the treated effluent in various other places within the Refinery, around 1.5 kms of 8 inches pipeline has been laid. During 2006 a major modification project, which included a high capacity pump along with all necessary pipings and suitable control systems including the chlorine dosing system was put in place. Due to the above modification works, the earlier practice of supplying water to the fire water network within the Refinery premises using fresh river water from the adjoining Kaliyani River has been replaced by using chlorinated treated effluent, thereby reducing the treated effluent discharge to zero level. It may be mentioned that right from its inception more than a decade ago, NRL has a well defined Environment management system under which it has been pursuing a focused programme towards environmental protection by adopting safe and eco-friendly technologies, sound design and engineering practices. 13-02-07

 AGM PRESS RELEASE 22-09-06 
 NRL DECLARES 31 % POST TAX PROFIT AS DIVIDEND FOR 2005-06, GOVT. OF ASSAM TO GET RS. 17.25 CRORES AS DIVIDEND
 
 The 13th Annual General Meeting of Numaligarh Refinery Limited was held in Hotel Brahmaputra Ashok, Guwahati on Friday, the 22nd September, 2006. The Meeting was presided over by Chairman, NRL, Sri Ashok Sinha, who is also the Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. The resolution of declaring 31 % post tax profit as dividend was adopted in the AGM. With this, NRL shall contribute Rs. 17.25 crores as dividend to the state exchequer for the year 2005-06.
The year 2005-06 saw NRL achieving its best ever financial results since commencement of its commercial operations in the year 2000. The Company attained an all time high gross turnover of Rs. 5,820 crores registering a growth of 35 % over the previous year. Profit after tax of Rs. 449 crores achieved during the year was also the highest ever as against Rs.409 crores in the previous year, thereby registering a healthy growth of almost 10%. The company has good reasons to cheer about the impressive results, coming at a time of spiraling international crude prices and tightening margins. The higher level of profit is attributable to a combination of positive factors like growth in turnover due to higher realization of price, improved product mix, optimization of operations, stringent cost control measures and savings in interest cost .

By optimizing operations and fine tuning business systems, the refinery was able to process 2.13 million metric tonnes of crude and evacuate 1.95 million metric tonnes of products during the year 2005-06. NRL’s continual efforts in maximizing production of high value distillates has resulted in net distillate yield of 85.1% wt., which was one of the highest in the country.

A major milestone achieved in the current year is the successful completion of the Rs. 297 crores Motor Spirit Project which will enable NRL to produce 185 thousand metric tonnes of Motor Spirit annually and enhance the production of LPG by about 21 TPA, thereby providing value addition.

NRL’s venture into the retail distribution segment gained further momentum during the year with the tally of commissioned retail outlets, aptly christened as“Energy Stations”, reaching 59 of which 36 are in the North East region and the remaining in other parts of the country. Sales from these outlets have been quite encouraging and the Company has been able to set itself apart as a unique brand, earning a loyal set of customers in the process. It is noteworthy that one of the newly commissioned energy stations at Jorabat in Meghalaya (near Guwahati) was the highest selling outlet in the whole of Eastern Region during April-August’06 with a combined MS/HSD sales volume of 1869 KLPM. NRL has now made a decent presence in retailing of MS/HSD in the North Eastern Region and captured a market share of 8.5% in the region, which is likely to increase progressively. Retail Visual Identity of NRL outlets have made quite an impact in the national scenario and the Company has been conferred the POPAI OMA ( Point of Purchase Advertising International Outstanding Merchandise Achievement) Silver award during 2006 under the category“Automobile Permanent”for the distinctive style and aesthetics of its Retail outlets. Moreover, internationally acclaimed certifying agency, M/s DNV has been engaged for Quality and Quantity certification of the commissioned Retail Outlets and they have already certified two Retail Outlets in the meantime.

NRL’s initiative for setting up of a tap off point marketing terminal at Hajo near Guwahati as an offshoot of the Numaligarh-Siliguri Product pipeline, presently under construction by Oil India Limited is likely to generate substantial business activity in Lower Assam. The proposed marketing terminal shall be used mainly for distribution of products to the markets located in lower Assam districts and in Meghalaya and shall also assist in river transport of NRL products to Bangladesh, as and when the efforts to enter Bangladesh market fructify.

As NRL moved forward in pursuit of organizational excellence, awards, accolades and recognition have come by from National and International bodies alike. The Greentech Safety Gold Award in Petroleum Refinery Sector for the Year 2006 in recognition of outstanding performance in the field of Health&amp;Safety, the Greentech Environment Excellence Award in the field of Environment Management ,“Award for Excellence”(1st prize) by Petroleum Conservation and Research Association (PCRA) in the Medium Project Category for the year 2004-05 ,‘Jawaharlal Nehru Centenary Award’for Energy efficiency for the year 2004-05 and the Oil Industry Safety Award in the‘Refineries’Category were bagged by NRL during the year.

While the company set it’s sights on achieving new milestones, it has never faltered in discharging its corporate social responsibility. It has taken a proactive role in promoting and executing schemes for socio - economic development of the region especially in the vicinity of the refinery by taking substantive strides for the benefit of the local populace, particularly in the areas of education, clean drinking water and sanitation and development of infrastructure.

 QUALITY AND QUANTITY CERTIFICATION OF NRL OUTLETS After putting up high end customer friendly Retail Outlets (Petrol Pump) with state-of-the-art facilities and branding them as“Energy Stations”, NRL has now set a very high standard to be followed in operation of their Energy Stations. NRL had engaged an internationally reputed agency, M/s. Det Norske Veritas AS (DNV) of Netherlands, to develop a suitable protocol for certification of NRL Energy Stations for Quality, Quantity, Infrastructure Facilities, Safety and Service Standards. Under this“Q&amp;Q protocol”, DNV will certify the NRL Energy Stations against over 100 different elements of Petrol Pump operation. DNV will carry out surprise checks of NRL Energy Stations and draw samples for testing independently. Besides physical operation of the outlets including maintenance of Quality and Quantity etc., the Q&amp;Q protocol also covers the areas of service standards and customer feed back system. By developing an elaborate and strict Q&amp;Q protocol, involving periodic and surprise inspections by a third party of international repute like, DNV, for operation of its Energy Stations having infrastructure facilities of international standard, NRL intends to give a happy fueling experience to its valued customers which the customers rightfully deserve.

Two NRL Energy Stations have already been certified under this Q&amp;Q protocol by DNV and these are located at Jayanagar in Guwahati (6th mile) and“Between Kaziranga and Bokakhat on NH-37”. NRL has awarded the job to DNV for certification of all its operating Energy Stations under this Q&amp;Q protocol.

With its quality and service standards, NRL Energy Stations have already made an impact in the petroleum retail marketing, particularly in the North-Eastern states of Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur. NRL Energy Station at Jorabat in Meghalaya became the highest selling Retail Outlet in the Eastern Region in March 2006 with a sales figure of 2236 KL and has retain this position even in the first quarter of 2006-07 with a sales figure of 1903 KL per month. More and more NRL Energy Stations are being put up with adequate infrastructure and high service standards.
During the financial year 2005-06, NRL has put up 48 Energy Stations in the country out of which 29 are in North-East. This brings the total number of NRL Energy Stations to 58 as on 01.04.2006, out of which 36 are in North-East.

 Rs. 70 CRORE MARKETING TERMINAL OF NRL AT HAJO
 
 Government of Assam had recently given its formal nod for transfer of more than 66 bighas of state owned land to NRL at Hajo in the outskirts of Guwahati for setting up of a tap off point Marketing terminal. NRL authorities have taken physical possession of the land today. The terminal shall serve to tap off NRL white oil products such as High Speed Diesel and Motor Spirit from its proposed 660 km product pipeline from Numaligarh en-route to Siliguri and shall serve as a major loading point for tank lorries for supply of NRL products to its retail outlets situated in the vicinity of Guwahati as well as other locations in lower Asom and Meghalaya. It may be mentioned here that NRL is moving ahead with ambitious plans to commission 125 retails outlets in the North East Region within the next two years. The utility of the tap off point shall continue to grow with expansion of NRL’s retail network, with the terminal serving as a major marketing hub for NRL products. Engineers India Limited has already been engaged as consultant for preliminary studies for the purpose of setting up of the terminal facilities at Hajo. Estimated cost of construction of facilities at tap off point shall be around Rs. 60-70 crores and the expected volume of products that shall be marketed though this terminal shall be at least 500 TMT annually. The utility of the tap off point shall increase many fold, with expansion of NRL’s Retail network.

NRL also has plans to export Diesel to Bangladesh via river route. This tap off point shall increase the viability of such export with products being transported by barges through the Brahmaputra via Dhubri into the neighbouring country of Bangladesh. Activities for lining up an agency for construction of a Jetty at the terminal point are already underway. It may be mentioned that the 3 MMT per annum Numaligarh Refinery has been able to operate at a capacity of around 2 MMT per annum only due to evacuation problems faced by it. To remain viable, NRL has to market 85% of its products outside the North East due to inadequate demand within the North East, which is limited to 1.8 MMTPA against a total refining capacity of 7 MMTPA of all the 4 Assam Refineries put together.

With timely product evacuation through the proposed product pipeline between Numaligarh and Siliguri, NRL shall be able to attain 100 % capacity utilization which shall in turn increase the viability of the refinery and shall also lead to refining a larger quantity of crude within the state. This shall not only make NRL sustainable, but also allow it to invest its profits for supporting expansion projects for value addition, thereby leading to more wealth creation within the state. 
 29-06-06 
 PRESS RELEASE FOR PRESS MEET HELD AT NUMALIGARH Numaligarh Refinery Limited, which has come into existence as a result of the Historic Assam Accord signed in the year 1985 has a capacity to process 3 MMT of crude per year. However, on an average, it has been able to process only about 2 MMT of crude per year due to constraints faced by it in evacuation of its products. About 85 % of NRL’s products have to be marketed outside the North-East, since demand for petroleum products in the North East is only around 1.8 MMT per year against total refining capacity of 7 MMT of all the 4 Assam refineries put together. In the financial year 2005-06, the Refinery could process 2.13 MT of crude, evacuate 1.95 MMT of products and earn a reasonable amount of profit in the process. The net distillate yield during the year was maintained at a level of over 85% wt , which was one of the highest in the country. During the year, the Refinery produced around 960 TMT of Bharat Stage II grade HSD ( High Speed Diesel) and around 360 TMT of Euro III grade HSD for supply to metro cities. Production of ATF( Aviation Turbine fuel) and MS( Motor Spirit) stood at around 83 TMT and 91 TMT respectively. Since commissioning, NRL has been maintaining very high standards of safety performance. It has completed about 4½years without loss time accident. Due to its safety systems, the company has been awarded the International Safety Rating System(ISRS) level-9 by M/s DNV Netherlands, which establishes NRL as one of the safest Refineries in operation in the world. Conscious efforts have been made by NRL at every stage to preserve the environment complying with statutory norms prescribed by concerned authorities. Besides normal pollution abatement measures, specific steps have been taken to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the nearby areas. Continuous air monitoring is carried out at many locations in and around the vicinity of the Refinery and at Kaziranga in order to ensure that strict control of ambient air in and around the vicinity of the area is maintained, so that the flaura and the fauna is not disturbed. NRL bagged many awards last year like the Jawaharlal Nehru Centenary Award for Energy Efficiency, the Green Tech Gold Environment Excellence award, the Greentech Silver Safety award, the POPAI OMA Silver award for Retail Outlet design, Petroleum Conservation Research Association award for excellence in medium project Category for Energy Conservation. 

 With an objective of value addition, the company is moving ahead with ambitious plans for the future. The MS Project of the Refinery for production of 185 TMT of Euro III grade Motor Spirit is presently under commissioning. Revamp study of the Hydrocracker Unit (HCU) of the Refinery for production of Euro III grade High speed Diesel at 100% crude throughput capacity is in progress. Presently, capacity utilization of HCU has been limited to 80 %. While producing Euro III HSD, there are also plans to set up a naphtha splitter unit for supply of petrochemical grade Naphtha to the proposed Gas Cracker Project of Assam, where NRL shall hold 10 % equity. On the marketing front, the tally of commissioned Retail outlets stands at 59 with 36 in the North East Region. The sales from these outlets have been quite encouraging. NRL has already achieved per Retail outlet throughput of 311 KL per month against all India Industry Average of 130 KL per month. It is note worthy to mention that in the month of March’06, one of NRL’s newly commissioned Retail outlets at Jorabat achieved combined MS/HSD sales volume of 2236 KL, the highest in the Eastern Region. NRL is moving ahead with ambitious plans to commission 125 outlets in the North East within the next 2 years. The company has also made headway with its plans to export HSD to the neighbouring country of Bangladesh. Construction of product pipeline from Numaligarh to Siliguri by Oil India Limited is going on and is expected to be completed within 2007. The pipeline shall enable NRL to transport 1.72 MMT of white oil products per year. With this, the severe bottlenecks faced by NRL in evacuation of its products is expected to be over. Product distribution through roadways by way of tank lorries shall not only continue but shall increase substantially with NRL’s initiative to expand its retail network within the North East. Also, rail loading of products for various North East locations will continue from Numaligarh. 
 Right from its inception, NRL has put great emphasis in discharging its duties as a socially responsible corporate. NRL is conscious of the fact that being the Assam Accord Refinery, it has to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of the people of the state. NRL’s Community development initiatives are carefully planned and executed so that maximum number of people from the nearby areas benefit from our schemes. Besides dispensing relief, NRL focuses on capability development of the beneficiaries on various aspects like income generating activities, education, community health, infrastructure and a multitude of social activities. 06-05-06 
 NUMALIGARH REFINERY RIDES HIGH ON GOOD FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
 The annual accounts of Numaligarh Refinery Limited for the financial year 2005-06 were adopted in the meeting of its Board of Directors on 28th April 2006 at Mumbai. The Company posted a record sales turnover of Rs. 5820 crores registering a growth of 35 % over the previous year’s turnover of Rs 4299 crores. Net profit rose by almost 10 % to Rs. 449 crores from the previous year’s level of Rs 409 crores. During the year, the refinery processed 2132.8 TMT of crude with a high distillate yield of 85.06 % and evacuated 1948.15 TMT of products. The Company has reasons to cheer its impressive performance coming at a time when Oil PSUs are reeling under the burden of spiraling international prices of crude oil and subsidies on petroleum products. NRL’s foray into the retail distribution segment gathered momentum during FY 2005-06 with the tally of commissioned retail outlets, aptly christened as“Energy Stations”, reaching 58 by the year-end of which 36 are in the North East region and the remaining in other parts of the country. Sales from these outlets have been quite encouraging and the Company has been able to set itself apart as a unique brand, earning a loyal set of customers in the process. The Company has also made some headway in its efforts to export diesel to the neighbouring country of Bangladesh with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation Ltd in the month of February 2006 While NRL moved forward to achieve new milestones, it has never faltered in discharging its corporate social responsibility. It has taken a proactive role in promoting and executing schemes for socio - economic development of the region especially in the vicinity of the refinery by taking substantive strides for the benefit of the local populace. It has contributed significantly in sponsoring agri-allied schemes for self-employment of the local unemployed youth. It has made conscious efforts to spread the light of education in the nearby areas by renovating schools and colleges and building educational facilities. The initiatives to improve infrastructure in the nearby areas has extended beyond the domain of building roads and bridges and has had a definitive impact in improving the quality of life in the neighboring areas. Community health and promotion of arts, sports and culture are other aspects that assume priority in the Company’s agenda for community development. 22-04-06

 SOFTWARE 
 Software are running to software in the output like game operation system, which are help full to the user. 
 Software is a generic term for organized collections of computer data and instructions, often broken into two major categories: system software that provides the basic non-task-specific functions of the computer, and application software which is used by users to accomplish specific tasks. 
 System software is responsible for controlling, integrating, and managing the individual hardware components of a computer system so that other software and the users of the system see it as a functional unit without having to be concerned with the low-level details such as transferring data from memory to disk, or rendering text onto a display. Generally, system software consists of an operating system and some fundamental utilities such as disk formatters, file managers, display managers, text editors, user authentication (login) and management tools, and networking and device control software. 
 Application software, on the other hand, is used to accomplish specific tasks other than just running the computer system. Application software may consist of a single program, such as an image viewer; a small collection of programs (often called a software package) that work closely together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet or text processing system; a larger collection (often called a software suite) of related but independent programs and packages that have a common user interface or shared data format, such as Microsoft Office, which consists of closely integrated word processor, spreadsheet, database, etc.; or a software system, such as a database management system, which is a collection of fundamental programs that may provide some service to a variety of other independent applications. 
 Software is created with programming languages and related utilities, which may come in several of the above forms: single programs like script interpreters, packages containing a compiler, linker, and other tools; and large suites (often called Integrated Development Environments) that include editors, debuggers, and other tools for multiple languages. DATA: Data is processing to run and communicate through user to computer, which are facts and figure. is a small hardware device that joins multiple computers together within one local area network (LAN) . Technically, network switches operate at layer two (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model .

Unlike hubs, network switches are capable of inspecting data packets as they are received, determining the source and destination device of that packet, and forwarding it appropriately. By delivering each message only to the connected device it was intended for, a network switch conserves network bandwidth and offers generally better performance than a hub.

KFC has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Yum! Brands since 2002. The company was founded as Kentucky Fried Chicken by Colonel Harland Sanders in 1952. The company adopted the abbreviated form of its name in 1991. [2] Starting in April 2007, the company began using its original appellation of Kentucky Fried Chicken again for its signage, packaging and advertisements in the United States as part of a new corporate re-branding program; [3] [4] newer and remodeled restaurants will have the new logo and name while older stores will continue to use the 1991 signage. Additionally, the company continues to use the abbreviation KFC freely in its advertising. Internationally the company is still known as KFC . KFC primarily sells chicken in form of pieces, wraps , salads and sandwiches . While its primary focus is fried chicken KFC also offers a line of roasted chicken products, sides and desserts . Outside of North America , KFC offers beef based products such as burgers or kebabs, pork based products such as ribs and other regional fare. The popularity and novelty of KFC has led to the general formula of the fried chicken fast-food restaurant being copied by restaurant owners worldwide.

 

 HISTORY OF KFC 
The restaurant in North Corbin KY where Conlonel Sander developed Kentucky Friend Chicken. World&apos;s first KFC in South Salt Lake, Utah , since replaced by a new KFC on the same site. Born and raised in Henryville, Indiana , Sanders passed through several professions in his lifetime. [5] Sanders first served his fried chicken in 1930 in the midst of the Great Depression at a gas station he owned in North Corbin, Kentucky . The dining area was named&quot;Sanders Court&amp;Café&quot;and was so successful that in 1936 Kentucky Governor Ruby Laffoon granted Sanders the title of honorary Kentucky Colonel , in recognition of his contribution to the state&apos;s cuisine. The following year Sanders expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he bought across the street. [6] When Sanders prepared his chicken in his original restaurant in North Corbin, he prepared the chicken in an iron skillet, which took about 30 minutes to do, too long for a restaurant operation. In 1939 , Sanders altered the cooking process for his fried chicken to use a pressure fryer , resulting in a greatly reduced cooking time comparable to that of deep frying . [7] In 1940 Sanders devised what came to be known as his Original Recipe. [8] The Sanders Court&amp;Cafégenerally served travelers, often those headed to Florida , so when the route planned in the 1950s for what would become Interstate 75 bypassed Corbin , he sold his properties and traveled the U.S. to sell his chicken to restaurant owners. Sanders entered into franchise agreements paying him five cents for each piece of chicken sold.[ citation needed ] The first to take him up on the offer was Pete Harman in South Salt Lake, Utah ; together, they opened the first&quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;outlet in 1952. [9] By the early 1960s Kentucky Fried Chicken was sold in over 600 franchised outlets in both the United States and Canada. One of the longest-lived franchisees of the older Col. Sanders&apos;chicken concept, as opposed to the KFC chain, was the Kenny Kings chain. The company owned many Northern Ohio diner-style restaurants, the last of which closed in 2004 . Sanders sold the entire KFC franchising operation in 1964 for $2 million USD [10] Since that time, the chain has been sold three more times, most recently to PepsiCo , which made it part of its Tricon Global Restaurants division, which in turn was spun off in 1997 , and has now been renamed to Yum! Brands . Additionally, Colonel Sanders&apos;nephew, Lee Cummings, took his own Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises (and a chicken recipe of his own) and converted them to his own&quot;spin-off&quot; restaurant chain , Lee&apos;s Famous Recipe Chicken . Today, some of the older KFC restaurants have become famous in their own right. One such restaurant is located in Marietta, Georgia . This store is notable for a 56-foot (17 m) tall sign that looks like a chicken. The sign, known locally as the Big Chicken , was built for an earlier fast-food restaurant on the site called Johnny Reb&apos;s Chick, Chuck and Shake. It is often used as a travel reference point in the Atlanta area by locals and pilots. [11] Hisoty at Glance: 9/9/1890

 Packaging 
The famous paper bucket that KFC uses for its larger sized orders of chicken and has come to signify the company was originally created by Wendy&apos;s restaurants founder Dave Thomas . Thomas was originally a franchisee of the original Kentucky Fried Chicken and operated several outlets in the Columbus, Ohio area. His reasoning behind using the paper packaging was that it helped keep the chicken crispy by wicking away excess moisture. The rotating bucket sign was designed by Leonard Goldstein to advertise the availability of Kentucky Fried Chicken at his Lendy&apos;s Restaurants in Roanoke and Salem, VA. The signs first appeared in 1961, a year before Dave Thomas took over 4 Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in Columbus, OH.

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 Menu items 
Chicken
 KFC&apos;s specialty is fried chicken served in various forms. KFC&apos;s primary product is pressure-fried pieces of chicken made with one of two types of breading: original recipe or extra crispy . KFC has two lines of sandwiches: its&quot;regular&quot;chicken sandwiches and its Snackers line. The regular sandwiches are served on either a sesame seed or corn dusted roll and are made from either whole breast fillets (fried or roasted), chopped chicken in a sauce or fried chicken strips. The Snackers line are value priced items that consist of chicken strips and various toppings. In the UK the main sandwiches are chicken fillet burger (a chicken breast fillet coated in an original-recipe coating with salad garnish and mayonnaise) and a Zinger Burger (as with the former but with a spicier coating and salsa). Both of these are available as&quot;tower&quot;variants, which include a slice of cheese and a hash brown. A variety of smaller finger food products are available at KFC including chicken strips, wings, nuggets and popcorn chicken. These products can be ordered plain or with various sauces, including several types of barbecue sauces and buffalo sauce . Several pies have been made available from KFC. The Pot Pie is a savory pie made with chicken, gravy and vegetables. In the second quarter of 2006, KFC introduced its variation on Shepherd&apos;s pie called the Famous Bowl . Served in a plastic bowl, it is layered with mashed potatoes or rice, gravy, corn, popcorn chicken, and cheese. The bowl had been available at KFC&apos;s special test market store in Louisville since the third quarter of 2005. 


 The KFC Twister is a wrap that consists of either chicken strips or roasted chicken, tomato, lettuce and (pepper) mayonnaise wrapped in a tortilla . 


 Shish kebab - in several markets KFC sells kebabs. 
Other products Coleslaw 

 In some international locations, KFC may sell hamburgers , pork ribs or fish. In the U.S., KFC began offering the Fish Snacker sandwich during Lent in 2006. The Fish Snacker consists of a rectangular patty of Alaskan Pollock on a small bun, and is the fifth KFC menu item in the Snacker category. [12] Three types of salads (which can be topped with roasted or fried chicken) are available at KFC: Caesar, house, and BLT salads (in the US). Zinger Burger - A regular sized burger which regularly consists of a boneless fillet of hot and spicy chicken, lettuce and mayonnaise in a burger bun. Cheese, tomato, bacon and pineapple can be added upon request. Barbecue sauce can also replace/join the mayonnaise. Parfait deserts -&quot;Little Bucket Parfaits&quot;in varieties such as Fudge Brownie, Chocolate Crème (once called the Colonel&apos;s Little Fudge Bucket), Lemon Crème and Strawberry Shortcake are available at most locations in the US. [13] Sara Lee Desserts - Available in either Cookies and Cream Cheesecake or Choc Caramel Mousse. &quot;Variety Bucket&quot;: This has chicken, popcorn chicken, two sides, biscuit. 
Sides
 Other than fried chicken, many KFC restaurants serve side dishes like coleslaw , various potato -based items (including potato wedges, french fries and mashed potatoes with gravy ), biscuits , baked beans , macaroni and cheese , rice , steamed vegetables and corn on the cob . 
Discontinued products
 The Colonel&apos;s Rotisserie Gold - This product was introduced in the 1990s as a response to the Boston Market chain&apos;s roasted chicken products, and a healthier mindset of the general public avoiding fried food. Purportedly made from a&quot;lost&quot;Col. Sanders recipe, it was sold as a whole roaster or a half bird. [14] Tender Roast Chicken - This product was an off-shoot of&apos;The Colonel&apos;s Rotisserie Gold&apos;. Instead of whole and half birds, customers were given quarter roasted chicken pieces. For a time, customers could request chicken&quot;original&quot;,&quot;Extra Tasty Crispy&quot;, or&quot;Tender Roast&quot;. Chicken Little sandwich - a value oriented sandwich that sold for $0.39( USD ) [15] in the U.S. during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was a small chicken patty with mayonnaise on a small roll, similar to White Castle &apos;s mini chicken sandwich. [16] Extra Tasty Crispy (ETC) - Chicken much like the Extra Crispy served today, except ETC was prepared using chicken that had been soaking for at least a day in special marinade. There is some speculation that the marinade may have been made with trans-fats, and KFC boasts to no longer use trans-fats in their chicken. In the summer of 2007, KFC started marketing the chicken just as&quot;Extra Crispy&quot;without the marinade. 


 Kentucky Nuggets were a chicken nugget product available at KFC until 1996. No reason has been given for their discontinuation. Fillers - A promotional item for a Cricket team, the filler was a nine inch (22cm) sub available in four different varieties from November 2007-Mid January 2008, only in Australia. 
Nutritional value KFC formerly used partially hydrogenated oil in its fried foods. This oil contains relatively high levels of trans fat , which increases the risk of heart disease . The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) filed a court case against KFC, with the aim of making it use other types of oils or make sure customers know about trans fat content immediately before they buy food. In October 2006, KFC announced that it would begin frying its chicken in trans fat-free oil. This would also apply to their potato wedges and other fried foods, however, the biscuits, macaroni and cheese , and mashed potatoes would still contain trans fat. Trans fat-free soybean oil was introduced in all KFC restaurants in the U.S. by 30 April 2007 . CSPI announced that it would immediately drop its lawsuit against KFC and was hopeful that this would create a ripple effect on other restaurants or fast food chains that prepare food rich in trans fat.&quot;If KFC, which deep-fries almost everything, can get the artificial trans fat out of its frying oil, anyone can,&quot;CSPI Executive Director Michael Jacobson said in a statement. KFC MARKETING ANALYSIS Introduction KFC operates in 74 countries and territories throughout the world. It was founded in Corbin, Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders. y 1964, the Colonel decided to sell the business to two Louisville businessmen. In 1966 they took KFC public and the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1971, Heublein, Inc. acquired KFC, soon after, conflicts erupted between the Colonel (which was working as a public relations and goodwill ambassador) and Heublein management over quality control issues and restaurant cleanliness. In 1977 a&quot;back-to-the-basics&quot;strategy was successfully implemented. By the time KFC was acquired by PepsiCo in 1986, it had grown to approximately 6,600 units in 55 countries and territories. Due to strategic reasons, in 1997 PepsiCo spun off its restaurant businesses (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC) into a new company called Tricon Global Restaurants.

Reasons for going overseas Companies moves beyond domestic markets into international...... External Analysis The following external analysis will include an examination of KFC’s competitors, the markets in which it sells its products, and the demographic factors that influence its business.

 

 Customer Analysis 
KFC’s customers generally choose the restaurant they will eat at based on quality, rapidity, and variety of items. KFC’s customers are also really price sensitive and will go elsewhere if they find that the value is not worth the price. They can also be characterized by being people that want to be served fast and be out of the restaurant in no time.



 

 

 

 

 

 

 Competitor Analysis 
PepsiCo had the leading market share in the chicken (KFC), pizza (Pizza Hut), and Mexican-food (Taco Bell) segments of the fast-food industry. The major competitor for KFC is Popeyes, which comes second with a mere 12.7% as you can see from the graph where KFC has 55.2% (refer to graph #1) of the Chicken chain market shares. Another interesting fact is that the Chicken segment is the fifth in terms of sales in the fast-food industry and we note that they are fewer competitors compared to the other segments. For instance the sandwich chain segment, which includes McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s, has about 12 notable competitors where there are only 5 in the chicken segment. KFC is the overall sixth biggest restaurants, all segments grouped. Even with a large market share, KFC is losing of its leadership. Market shares have been declining at a rate of 15% over the past 10 years. Other chains such as Boston quickly understood that people wanted healthier food. To response to the demand, Boston provides roasted chicken instead of fried. Without a doubt, it appears that their strategy is working and that Boston is stealing customers away from KFC. However by aggressively competing in the market, Boston went into financial problems and was later acquired by McDonald’s, which would certainly be a fierce competitor to KFC. Another competitor, Wendy’s, announced that they plan to open 100 new restaurants over the next 10 years in Mexico where KFC had planned to increase their presence. We can see that competition is really tough domestically and most companies are now ready to attack internationally.

 

 

 

 

 

 Market analysis (Domestic&amp;International) 
Fast-food industry sales rose by 5.4% with more than 800 000 restaurants in the US in 1999. On the other hand, full-service restaurants grew by 7% during the same period. The trend has now been reversed since in the mid-1990s, at that time the fast-food sector was surpassing the full-service sector, however due to the maturation of the sector, rising family income among many Americans and many other demographic factors that will be discussed in more detail in the next point. Dinner houses are becoming more popular and we can see a trend for full-service restaurants. Sales in the full-service sector increased by more than 13% during 1999, surpassing by a large margin the 6% fast-food industry growth. This higher growth in that full-service segment translated to a slower demand in the sandwich, pizza chains. Domestically, the chicken market seems saturated and is only growing at a rate of 1% in the US. Companies in that sector have to look at other alternatives if they want to grow. International fast-food market was a strategy that most big fast-food players have looked at since the US started to mature and saturate. Many chains expanded into other countries to take advantage of the potential growth opportunities. There seems that there is still an untouched market outside of the US. For instance, McDonald’s operate 46 restaurants for every 1 million US residents and only 1 restaurant for 3 million outside the US. McDonald’s is certainly the biggest competitor abroad operating 14 000 units. SWOT ANALYSIS OF KFC SWOT ANALYSIS OF KFC Strengths FC&apos;s product strategies are categorized into two aspects. 1. To meet consumers&apos;desire for novelty by introducing western style products like Mexican Chicken Warp and New Orleans Barbeque Wings. This means can satisfy young consumers who are more open and acceptable to the foreign flavors. 2. To cater to consumers&apos;taste for traditional Chinese meal by offering Chinese style fast food from time to time, say, Old Beijing Chicken Roll, a wrap modeled after the way Peking duck is served, but with fried chicken inside and accompanied with green onions and hoisin sauce, and Sichuan Spicy Chicken which absorbs the spicy flavor of Sichuan dish. Chinese-style breakfast food, like porridge is also served since Oct 27, 2003 on the breakfast menu of all 59 KFC restaurants in Shenzhen. The breakfast choices are a blend of East and West, ranging from Chinese seafood and chicken congee, Hong Kong milk tea to Western burgers, potato sticks and orange juice (Adler, 2003). This measure can attract older consumers who are fond of Chinese food and in need of the convenience of fast food service as well. Based on its scrutiny and adoption of Chinese traditional culinary arts, KFC has developed a series of products which are specially designed for the tastes of Chinese consumers. Moreover, in purpose of maintaining its image of a U.S. brand and keeping consistent with its globalization strategy, most of KFC&apos;s Chinese side dishes are defined as short-term products and would be replaced by new product.

To represent the Chinese characteristics and increase the identification from Chinese consumers, KFC absorbs Chinese cultural elements into the arrangements and decorations of its outlets all over China. In 2003, KFC spent 7.6 million renminbi (equal to 900,000 US dollars) to redecorate the flagship outlet in Beijing, which is also the world&apos;s largest KFC outlet, with the Great Wall, shadowgraph, Chinese kites and other traditional Chinese symbols. In the Chinese New Year... Threats The largest threat KFC is faced with is the restaurant industry as a whole. The consumer continues to have many choices when it comes to fast food restaurants. By the year 2000 only 27 percent of the restaurants were company owned. The cultural differences took the focus away from the chicken business. Weakness I&apos;ll focus the analysis by exploring, through different perspectives, the pros and cons of KFC investing in Latin America. I inevitably associate the words&apos;Latin America&apos;, when related to social and political factors, with instability, coup d&apos;鴡t, inflation, drug cartels, and military governments. What can make this region attractive to so many companies? First, the size of the market - it has a population of more than 360 million. Second, most countries are becoming fully functional democracies. Third, most countries are successfully stabilizing their economies. These factors make investment in this market less risky, although it still carries a risk degree above the average. In a competitive market, companies are not only dependent on their strategy but also on the strategy of their competitors. If the competition is exploring the Latin American market and you aren&apos;t, can&apos;t that be risky? For example, if McDonald&apos;s invest in the risky market X and KFC doesn&apos;t, two situations may happen. First the investment succeeds, in which case McDonald&apos;s gains the advantage. Second the investment fails, in which case KFC gains the advantage from McDonald&apos;s misfortune. This situation is one of win or lose all. If KFC wants to&apos;play&apos;it safe, it can follow the competition into the new markets. That way the chance of all loosing or all winning is quite the same. The new trade theory mentions the importance of first-mover advantages, especially in locations where the market size only supports one company. For example, KFC&apos;s early entry in Mexico gave it a leadership position. McDonald&apos;s, one of KFC&apos;s biggest competitors, decided to focus their Latin American investments on Brazil. As of December 1997, McDonald&apos;s had a total of 480 restaurants in Brazil while KFC had only 8. The economies of scale that are allowed in a big market such as Brazil, can be an enormous competitive advantage to power the investment in the rest of the South/Central America. Mexico is a very attractive market to many American companies. Its proximity to home and large population are two of the main reasons. It can be the first step into the promising&apos;Latin American&apos;market. Three factors made Mexico an even more attractive market after the late 1980&apos;s - when they joined GATT, NAFTA and elected Carlos Salinas, which started an ambitious program of economic reforms. In the mid 90&apos;s KFC investments in Mexico were hit by a series of social, economic and political events. The main one was the Peso devaluation, which resulted in higher inflation and capital fight out of Mexico. To fight the problem an austerity program was created resulting in lower disposable income, higher unemployment, and lower demand for products and services. Any sign of economical problems generally hits the restaurant industry. If a family has income problems one of the first things they&apos;ll cut is eating out. Opportunities and Recommendation In the 1998 financial report of Tricon Global, they mention&quot;We anticipate that, despite the inherent risks and generally higher general and administrative expenses of operations, we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential&quot;. This indicates that KFC strategy is to continue to expand internationally with which I totally agree. My recommendations for an international strategy will not only focus on Latin America. Here they are: Follow the 80-20 rule During 1998, about 66 percent of KFC&apos;s international profits were coming from seven countries. My recommendation is to focus on those markets with company owned restaurants and have franchises in the rest of the markets. Don&apos;t put all eggs in the same basket The world is divided in different regional markets (like Europe, Asia, Latin America,?). If a crisis happens in a specific country it tends to affect all countries within the same economic region with which it has close economic relations. KFC should focus not only on&apos;Latin America&apos;but also in other markets. That way it can minimize possible economic crisis in one region with the profits of another region. Lobby within the Mexican government Due to Mexico&apos;s failure in reducing restrictions on US and Canadian investments in a timely fashion, KFC should establish contacts within the Mexican government to incentivize Mexico&apos;s compliance with NAFTA and GATT agreements. Decrease the turnover rate KFC needs to understand why the turnover and absenteeism rate so high. Is it due to cultural factors? Does that also happen to other companies? Are those companies foreign? After understanding the main reasons for the labor problems, KFC must deploy a program that will create a more disciplined work force. That can be accomplished by giving a bonus for those that had high punctuality rates, good growth perspectives, etc. This program would have to be targeted to the Mexican culture, the examples given where based on a Western point of view. Gain from future currency crisis Currency fluctuation is inevitable. It can result in significant economic impacts that affect operating results. KFC executives must try to benefit from those fluctuations and currency crisis. For example, when the Mexican Peso was grossly overvalued in 1995 KFC could have bought foreign currency with Pesos before its value was readjusted. After the readjustment it could have bought back Pesos and use that gain to invest in its operations in Mexico.

McDonald&apos;s ( NYSE : MCD ) is the world&apos;s largest chain of fast food restaurants , serving nearly 47 million customers daily [3] . McDonald&apos;s primarily sells hamburgers , cheeseburgers , chicken products, French fries , breakfast items, soft drinks , milkshakes and desserts . More recently, it has begun to offer salads , wraps and fruit. Many McDonald&apos;s restaurants have included a playground for children and advertising geared toward children, and some have been redesigned in a more&apos;natural&apos;style, with a particular emphasis on comfort and the absence of hard plastic chairs and tables. 

 

 HISTORY OF MCDONALD&apos;S 
 The business began in 1940, with a restaurant opened by siblings Dick and Mac McDonald in San Bernardino , California . Their introduction of the&quot;Speedee Service System&quot;in 1948 established the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant . The present corporation dates its founding to the opening of a franchised restaurant by Ray Kroc , in Des Plaines , Illinois on April 15 , 1955 , the ninth McDonald&apos;s restaurant overall. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers&apos;equity in the company and led its worldwide expansion. With the successful expansion of McDonald&apos;s into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life . Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity , corporate ethics and consumer responsibility . The McDonald&apos;s History - 1954 to 1955 Raymond Albert Kroc 1902-1984 Ray Kroc mortgaged his home and invested his entire life savings to become the exclusive distributor of a five-spindled milk shake maker called the Multimixer. Hearing about the McDonald&apos;s hamburger stand in California running eight Multimixers at a time, he packed up his car and headed West. It was 1954. He was 52 Year old. Dick and Mac McDonald&apos;s Restaurant, San Bernardino, California Ray Kroc had never seen so many people served so quickly when he pulled up to take a look. Seizing the day, he pitched the idea of opening up several restaurants to the brothers Dick and Mac McDonald, convinced that he could sell eight of his Multimixers to each and every one.&quot;Who could we get to open them for us?&quot;Dick MCDonald’s said &quot;Well,&quot;Kroc answered,&quot;what about me?&quot; Where it all began, Des Plaines, Illinois Ray Kroc opened the Des Plaines restaurant in 1955. First day&apos;s revenues-$366.12! No longer a functioning restaurant, the Des Plaines building is now a museum containing McDonald&apos;s memorabilia and artifacts, including the Multimixer! The McDonald&apos;s History - 1956 to 1963 Ray Kroc At Work If you&apos;ve got time to lean, you&apos;ve got time to clean,&quot;Ray Kroc preached to his troops. Heeding his own words, here the Chairman of the Board cleans the parking lot of the first McDonald&apos;s franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois. Ronald McDonald, In Any Language He Means&quot;Fun!&quot; The smile known around the world,&quot;In his first TV appearance in 1963 none other than Willard Scott portrayed the happy clown. Check out McDonaldland for more Ronald McDonald information and fun. Fred Turner And Ray Kroc, Architects Of A Dream Here Ray Kroc (right) and Fred Turner study the design which would replace the red and white tile buildings that had become landmarks throughout the U.S. Called Kroc&apos;s first&quot;grill man extraordinaire,&quot;Turner is today Senior Chairman of the Board. The McDonald&apos;s History - 1965 to 1973 McDonald&apos;s Comes To Wall Street In 1965 McDonald&apos;s went public with the company&apos;s first offering on the stock exchange. A hundred shares of stock costing $2,250 dollars that day would have multiplied into 74,360 shares today, worth approximately $3.3 million on December 31, 2006. In 1985 McDonald&apos;s was added to the 30-company Dow Jones Industrial Average. Click here for today&apos;s McDonald&apos;s stock price. A Big Idea Called&quot;Big Mac&quot; &quot;Introduced systemwide in 1968, the Big Mac was the brainchild of Jim Delligatti, one of Ray Kroc&apos;s earliest franchisees, who by the late 1960s operated a dozen stores in Pittsburgh.&quot; The Egg McMuffin Introduced in 1973, the Egg McMuffin was developed by owner operator Herb Peterson. The McDonald&apos;s History - 1994 to Today Kuwait City, Kuwait Kuwait City is pretty far from Des Plaines, Illinois, but that didn&apos;t stop 15,000 customers from lining up here on opening day in 1994. The line at the drive thru was seven miles long. Proving once again that&quot;Good Times, Great Taste&quot;is understandable in any language.

Forty three years after opening our first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, we are proud to come to you on the World Wide Web. Did you know that McDonalds.co m receives millions and millions of hits every week? 50th Anniversary McDonald&apos;s Corporation celebrated its 50th Anniversary with the opening of a flagship restaurant in Chicago. Mission Statement and MacDonald’s Products MISSION STATEMENT McDonald&apos;s brand mission is to&quot;be our customers&apos;favorite place and way to eat.&quot;Our worldwide operations have been aligned around a global strategy called the Plan to Win centering on the five basics of an exceptional customer experience -- People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. We are committed to improving our operations and enhancing our customers&apos;experience. MCDONALD&apos;S PRODUCTS McDonald&apos;s worldwide menu is broadly similar to that of the United States; for this reason The Economist magazine devised the Big Mac index , as the Big Mac is a product available around the world made to the same specifications. Even so, there are some variations due to differing tastes and cultural issues, among them: 

 In predominantly Muslim countries like Malaysia, pork is not served due to Muslim dietary laws ; the hamburger is called the beef burger, avoiding the word&quot; ham &quot;(although the name refers only to the German city of Hamburg ). Additionally, in North African Morocco as well as other Muslim countries, all meat is slaughtered in the halal method and labeled as such. In Israel , kosher dietary laws forbid the mixture of meat and dairy products; because of this, cheeseburgers are not popular. McDonald&apos;s runs kosher restaurants in Jerusalem and in Buenos Aires , Argentina and offers a&quot; Passover Bun&quot;(just in Israel) for the eight-day period in which practicing Jews abstain from leavened bread . &quot; Veggie burgers &quot;are offered wherever there is a significant demand, including India and much of Western Europe ( Belgium and France are notable exceptions), but McDonald&apos;s rarely certifies its products as vegetarian . Indeed, McDonald&apos;s was subject to a high-profile lawsuit and eventually forced to apologize for using small amounts of beef tallow in the preparation of fries marketed as cooked in 100% vegetable oil . 
 Soft drinks offered, also vary from country to country, with local brands available on tap alongside Coca-Cola Company brands . For example, Irn-Bru in Scotland and GuaranáAntarctica in Brazil , are more popular in those countries than the leading international brands (Recent studies show Irn-Bru has less market share than Coca-Cola).[ citation needed ] Similar popularity has led to the sale of Farmer&apos;s Union Iced Coffee in South Australian stores. For a time, British outlets offered&quot;McDonald&apos;s Cola&quot;rather than Coca-Cola, for legal reasons. Also, in Peru McDonald&apos;s was heavily criticized for not stocking Inca Kola , and thus never had a chance for the top spot of fast-food restaurants in that nation ( Bembos , a local chain, is number one there); McDonald&apos;s now serves Inca Kola alongside Coca-Cola, but it is still second in market share. In some countries McDonald&apos;s is expanding some of its restaurants to include&quot; McCafé &quot;counters, which sell brewed and specialty coffees , frappés , and a range of cakes , biscuits (cookies), and sandwiches in addition to the regular McDonald&apos;s menu; the first such McCaféwas installed at an existing McDonald&apos;s in central Melbourne , Australia in 1993 . In Portugal ,&quot;McCafés&quot;serve coffee in china cups, since the country has the custom of after meal coffee ( Bica or Cimbalino ), which is not traditionally served in plastic cups. 

 Products 

 The range of foods offered depends on the time of day. Lunch items such as hamburgers and fries are generally not served during breakfast time, from store open (or about 4:00am in 24-hour stores) to 10:30am on weekdays or 11:00am on weekends. In some 24-hour McDonald&apos;s restaurants (such as airports and service plazas ), some lunch items are already available cooked to order (as in a buffet ). Most breakfast items are not served at any time except breakfast, but there are some exceptions; hotcakes , Cinnamon Melts (replaced cinnamon rolls ), and bacon are always available upon request at most McDonald&apos;s restaurants. Food prices vary by region and country [3] . 

 Burgers 
 All meat-patty based sandwiches are grilled, with seasonings, consisting primarily. A freshly prepared Big Mac 

 Big Mac : Along with the Quarter Pounder with cheese, this is one of the two McDonald&apos;s signature menu items. Introduced in 1968 as a response to the flagship burger at Big Boy restaurants.

In some markets unfamiliar with Imperial measurements (such as France), it is known as a Royale with Cheese, as famously explained in the film Pulp Fiction , or variants thereof, such as McRoyale. Also sold as a double but with another large beef patty and slice of cheese, or as a quad sandwich in parts of Australia. Hamburgers and cheeseburgers : 1.6 oz. (45 g or 1/10th lb) ground beef patty, with 1/8oz ketchup , mustard, a single dill pickle , re-hydrated onions , on a toasted bun. This is also known as a Junior Burger, in some areas. At one time early in McDonald’s history, the pickle was removed from the sandwich [4] . Also sold as a double or triple, adding an extra pickle slice for each beef patty added. The double cheeseburger was originally offered as a promotional item, and was added to the regular menu in the late 1980s. A triple burger and a bacon double cheeseburger are optional items and are not always available in all restaurants or markets. A green chili double cheeseburger with chili peppers is offered in New Mexico . The Big N&apos;Tasty is a quarter pound beef patty with ketchup, mayonnaise with a grill flavoring, diced onions, two pickles, leaf lettuce, and a tomato slice, on a toasted bun.

Though in Ontario there is the angus deluxe, the angus delux with bacon, or cheese and the angus deluxe with bacon and cheese. Cheddar cheese is used on the Angus in Canada instead of American Cheese. Designed to compete with the Angus Burger from Burger King . Angus burgers are rumored to be released in Canada Q2 of 2008. In several European markets, a wrap called the Greek Mac is sold. It consists of two burger patties wrapped in a pita with yogurt sauce, tomato slices, iceberg lettuce and onions. The sandwich is offered in Belgium , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Spain, Cyprus , Serbia (seasonal), selected outlets in the UK, and Portugal . 

 Chicken, fish and pork 

 McChicken - A mildly spicy chicken sandwich, made from 100% white meat chicken breast, mayonnaise, and shredded lettuce, on a toasted bun.

[12] Fish McDippers is an Asian offering that features pieces of breaded fish with dipping sauces. When the item was introduced, it had special dipping sauces such as Thai sweet chili sauce and wasabi . These two dipping sauces have since been discontinued, though at certain places that still offer them, you can get tartar sauce . McRib - A sandwich featuring boneless pork smothered in barbecue sauce, diced onions, and pickles. Created in 1981, but later pulled from menu. Released annually in the US as a limited time promotion. Since 2005, the McRib has reappeared in late October and stays on the menu for one month. This limited time marketing stategy was parodied on The Simpsons , with the&quot; Krusty Burger Ribwich&quot;. The McRib was recently released in Canada as a promotional sandwich from March 18 through April 8th, 2008. The McRib is presently on some European menus, e.g. Germany. [13] 

 Other products

 Discontinued menu items 

 Hulaburger : A Ray Kroc invention, it featured a slice of pineapple instead of meat. Originally intended for Roman Catholics who were not allowed to eat meat on Fridays. It flopped when it was test-marketed in 1963. Famously re-enacted by X-Entertainment . McDLT : The McDLT (McDonald&apos;s Lettuce and Tomato) was sold in a novel form of packaging. [16] The meat and bottom half of the bun was prepared separately from the lettuce, tomato, American cheese, pickles, sauces, and top half of the bun. Both were then packaged into a specially designed two-sided container. The consumer was then expected to finalize preparation of the sandwich by combining the hot and cool sides just prior to eating. The company discontinued the sandwich in 1990 due to the move away from the environmentally unsound styrofoam packaging which was integral to the McDLT&quot;experience&quot;. The McDLT is perhaps best remembered for its marketing, which focused on variations of the theme&quot;Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool.&quot;A 1985 commercial released to market the new sandwich featured a young Jason Alexander . Beefsteak Sandwich , test-marketed in New York and other East Coast markets in 1980 and as far west as Chicago were part of a McDonald&apos;s&quot;Dinner Menu&quot;, offered only after 4:00 p.m. The Beefsteak Sandwich was essentially an elongated hamburger of a different quality served on a short French roll, similar to a sub or hero roll. Packets of steak sauce ( A1 sauce in Chicago) were available for the sandwich. Onion Nuggets , introduced at the same time as the Beefsteak Sandwich as the side item for the Dinner Menu. Onion Nuggets were chopped onions shaped into small solid pieces, dipped in batter and deep-fried. McLean Deluxe : A lower-calorie Quarter Pounder-type sandwich (introduced in 1991). This item was otherwise identical to the Big&amp;Tasty and the McDLT. Triple Ripple : A mixed cone with strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate, topped with a plastic top. [4] Arch Deluxe : A failed attempt to produce a&quot;luxury&quot;hamburger, promoted by a high-profile advertising campaign (introduced in 1996). It featured a quarter pound beef patty on a potato roll, with leaf lettuce, tomato, red onion, cheese, and a honey mustard -type sauce; peppered bacon was also offered for an extra charge. Torta : In 2000, the company released their own version of tortas, a Mexican sandwich, in southern California on a trial basis. McStuffin : a pocket sandwich available with various fillings. Chicken McGrill : Same as the Crispy Chicken, but with a marinated, grilled chicken breast. Both the Crispy and Grilled Chicken are derivatives of the failed Arch Deluxe sandwiches. Also replaced with a premium chicken sandwich in July 2005, but is still available in Canada. McGrilled Chicken Classic : A sandwich featuring a grilled chicken breast portion that was produced before being replaced by the Grilled Chicken Deluxe/Chicken McGrill. McCrispy Chicken : Served on a sesame seed bun, this sandwich featured mayonnaise, leaf lettuce and a sliced tomato and a crispy chicken patty. Fried Roast Beef Sandwich : An early sandwich that caused a disaster in the company. The introduction of roast beef was not a stupid move, after all, they have succeeded in getting into chicken, salads, etc. But frying roast beef just didn&apos;t sound appetizing to most people and the whole thing flopped as a result. [4] Philly Cheesesteak Slices of steak and Swiss cheese with onions. Served until August 2007, at Australian and American McDonald’s. This sandwich is still available in Canada, made with Cheese spread instead of Swiss, and with green bell pepper. Pizza : McDonald&apos;s has also attempted pizza at various times, with an apple-pie-like McPizza and more conventional McDonald&apos;s Pizza. A line of personal sized pizzas were sold in the early 90s. In Alberta, Newfoundland&amp;Labrador, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and British Columbia (c. 1992-1997) the pizza originally began as a family sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee and placed on a raised rack in the centre of the table. Later it was scaled down to a personal sized pizza when the larger version did not sell well. Hot Dogs : CEO Ray Kroc famously prohibited the company from selling hot dogs , regardless of potential demand, as he regarded them as unhygienic in his 1977 autobiography; however, UK Stores did sell Hot Dogs during the late nineties on the McChoice menu (later PoundSaver). Also, at least one American restaurant offered Oscar Mayer hot dogs at some time, and McDonald&apos;s locations at Toronto Metro Zoo and SkyDome in Toronto offered hot dogs until 1999. Grilled Chicken Flatbread Sandwich : Grilled chicken strips, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese, and a creamy herb sauce served wrapped in a heated flatbread. Served briefly in June 2002, and brought back in December 2002-January 2003. It was so popular in its original run that locations were running out of the flatbread, forcing McDonald&apos;s to briefly stop promoting the item. Chicken Platter : A grilled chicken burger served with lettuce and tomato on the HotCakes tray. Big 33 or McJordan Burger : A quarter pound burger with bacon and special barbecue sauce named after either basketball player Larry Bird or Michael Jordan. Triple-Double Burger : A burger featuring 3 beef patties and 2 slices of cheese, served on the same 6 inch (15.2 cm) sesame seed roll as the McRib . This was sold under the names of local sports stars in at least two markets in the 1990s: 
 The Jason Kidd Burger : Downtown Phoenix, Arizona franchises had an LTO burger named after NBA player Jason Kidd , while he played for the Phoenix Suns . Boselli Burger : Jacksonville, Florida franchises also featured the Triple-Double Burger in 1998, named after Jacksonville Jaguars tackle Tony Boselli . [17] 
 Beef Wennington : A burger solely offered in the Chicago area in the late 1990s, named after former Chicago Bulls player Bill Wennington . It featured a single patty topped with cheese, onions, barbecue sauce and a slice of Canadian bacon, as a tribute to Wennington&apos;s Canadian background. Dinner Menu : In early 1990s a New Dinner Menu was tested for 6-12 months at two locations in New York and Tennessee. It consisted of the above mentioned pizza but also included lasagna, spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo, and roasted chicken as entrees. The side dishes included mashed potatoes and gravy and a vegetable medley. For the dessert it included a brownie a la mode. 
 McDonalds International Products Ronald McDonald Ronald McDonald is a clown character used as the primary mascot of the McDonald&apos;s fast-food restaurant chain. Ronald McDonald is the second most recognized figure in the world (after Santa Claus ) [1] . In television commercials , the clown inhabits a fantasy world called McDonaldland , and has adventures with his friends Mayor McCheese, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, and The Fry Kids. The McDonald&apos;s Corporation has also characterized Ronald McDonald as being able to speak 31 different languages including Mandarin , Dutch , Tagalog , and Hindi . [2] In recent years, the&quot;childish&quot; McDonaldland has been largely phased out, and Ronald is instead shown interacting with normal kids in their everyday lives. He was first portrayed on television by Willard Scott . Many people work full-time making appearances in the Ronald McDonald costume, visiting children in hospitals. There are also Ronald McDonald Houses , where parents can stay overnight when visiting sick children in nearby chronic care facilities. Since August 2003, McDonald has been officially recognized as the&quot;Chief Happiness Officer&quot;of the McDonald&apos;s Corporation . 

 Origin 
 Willard Scott as Ronald McDonald, from the first of three pre-recorded television advertisements to feature Ronald. Note the&quot;food-tray hat&quot;. 

 Willard Scott 
 Teh first version of the origin of Ronald McDonald involves Willard Scott (a local radio personality who also played Bozo the Clown on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. from 1959 until 1962 ), who performed using the moniker &quot;Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown&quot;in 1963 on three separate television spots. These were the first three television ads featuring the character, whose later appearance was substantially similar to George Voorhees&apos;prior appearance as Ronald Mcdonald (spelt with a lower-case&quot;d&quot;) as shown in the Valley News and Green Sheet , a San Fernando Valley newspaper of the time. Scott, who went on to become NBC-TV &apos;s Today Show weatherman, claims to have&quot;created Ronald McDonald&quot;according to the following excerpt from his book Joy of Living : 
 
 “ At the time, Bozo was the hottest children&apos;s show on the air. You could probably have sent Pluto the Dog or Dumbo the Elephant over and it would have been equally as successful. But I was there, and I was Bozo... There was something about the combination of hamburgers and Bozo that was irresistible to kids... That&apos;s why when Bozo went off the air a few years later, the local McDonald&apos;s people asked me to come up with a new character to take Bozo&apos;s place. So, I sat down and created Ronald McDonald. [3] ” 
 McDonald&apos;s does not mention Voorhees or claim that Willard Scott&quot;created Ronald&quot;in their statement: 
 
 “ The smile known around the world,&quot;Ronald McDonald is second only to Santa Claus in terms of recognition. (According to one survey, 96% of all school kids in the United States of America recognize Ronald ( stunning-stuff.com )). In his first TV appearance in 1963, the happy clown was portrayed by none other than Willard Scott. ” 
 Additionally, and disregarding Voorhees&apos;claim, on March 28 , 2000 , Henry Gonzalez, McDonald&apos;s Northeast Division President, thanked Scott for creating Ronald McDonald, during a taped tribute to Scott on the Today Show . In 1965, Roy Burgold assigned Aye Jaye as Boss Clown worldwide in charge of hiring, writing, creating shows, media handling, training, and major events such as The White House appearances, Macy Days, etc., and finally opening Ronald worldwide for 35 years. Aye Jaye was responsible for the hiring of hundreds of past field Ronalds.

 Actors 
 Someone portraying Ronald McDonald on their way to a McDonald&apos;s event. At any given time, there are dozens, or possibly hundreds, of actors retained by McDonald&apos;s to appear as Ronald McDonald in restaurants and events. It is assumed, however, that the company uses only one actor at a time to play the character in national television commercials. Following is a list of such primary Ronald actors. 

 Willard Scott (Washington, D.C. 1963–1965) Bev Bergeron (Southern California, 1966-68) George Voorhis (South California, 1968-1970) Bob Brandon (1970-1975) King Moody (1975-1984) Squire Fridell (1984-1991) Jack Deopke (1990-1992) Joe Maggard (1994-2007) Brad Lennon (2007-Present) 
 Various forms of the name&quot;Ronald McDonald&quot;as well as costume clown face persona, etc. are registered trademarks of McDonald&apos;s. McDonald&apos;s trains performers to portray Ronald using identical mannerisms and costume, to contribute to the illusion that they are one character. McDonald&apos;s marketing designers and stylists changed elements of the Ronald McDonald character, persona, style, costume and clown face when they adopted the clown as a trademark, possibly in deference to &quot;The Code&quot; , the tradition of clowns to scrupulously avoid copying other clowns&apos;appearance or performance style. The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald was a series of retail animated direct-to-video features produced by the ka-chew! division of Klasky-Csupo (an animation company famous for creating shows like Rugrats , The Wild Thornberrys , and Duckman ) for the McDonald&apos;s fast-food restaurant chain. A total of six forty-minute tapes were produced, released at various times between 1998 and 2003 . 

 Scared Silly a haunted house tale The Legend of Grimace Island , dealing with the Grimace &apos;s origin Visitors From Outer Space , a science fiction tale dealing with extraterrestrials Birthday World , dealing with a scheming mad scientist &apos;s plot Have Time, Will Travel , A story of Time Travel The Legend of McDonald-Land Loch , homaging the Nessie myth 
 Although the series is&quot;free-standing,&quot;ongoing artistic influences can be inferred from the ways certain characters were drawn for animation. For example, the character Birdie shares certain aspects of grooming and costume with Eliza Thornberry , and the rendition and bearing of the Hamburglar, reminiscent of Darwin and of Chuckie Finster , may have been an influence on the design of Otto Rocket . Elements of early K-C&quot;house style&quot;are also very evident on other supporting characters like Sundae the dog and the Chicken McNuggets. Co-protagonist Tika, however, is a very normal looking human girl of color. Iam Hungry appeared to be in one part of the episode Visitors From Outer Space . McDonald&apos;s products (international) In order to satisfy the palette of the local population in a country, McDonald&apos;s offers regionalized versions of its products. The result is McDonald&apos;s foods and meals not seen in other countries. Australia

The winning name was the &quot;Backyard Burger&quot; . Due to healthy sales, the promotional period was extended from 8 to 16 weeks, but currently the NameIt/Backyard Burger is not part of the Australian core-menu line-up. · Nudie Fruit Juices : Released in October 2007, they are 100% fruit juices available in three flavours; Mango Mash, Strawberry Burst and Blueberry Blend.

 Brazil 
 The best selling McDonald&apos;s sandwich in Brazil is a local creation, the Cheddar McMelt . It features toasted buns, one hamburger, onions, soy sauce and a large amount of creamy cheddar cheese. 

 Canada 
 In 2006, the deli sandwiches had been introduced, and in 2008, poutine was added to the menu under the name My Poutine (for some reason, Mc is not in the name) nationwide, although it had been available in the province of Quebec for over a decade. The McLobster, a lobster roll , is available seasonally at select locations in Atlantic Canada. Two versions of pizza have been rolled out on a regional basis: A full family sized pizza, and a personal pizza which eventually replaced it when the original version did not sell strongly enough. These were eventually discontinued as the market was highly competitive and tiny profit margins did not allow either product to be very profitable. There was also a small, Calzone -style McPizza for some time, which resembled an apple pie. 

 Chile 
 In Chile, customers can add avocado paste to any sandwich, other than the McPalta ( Chilean Spanish for: McAvocado ) whose basis is the avocado paste along with lomito or pork. Cheese empanadas are also sold at all McDonald&apos;s locations in Chile under the same category as fries.

There is also a seasonal Chinese New Year meal available, including Grilled Chicken Burger, curly fries, with a horoscope of the twelve zodiac animals of Chinese astrology and traditional&quot;red&quot;packets, or gift bags, for monetary gift giving as good luck. Note that all chicken burgers offered in Chinese McDonald&apos;s use thigh fillet (eg Premium Grilled Thigh Fillet Burger, Hot and Spicy Grilled Thigh Fillet Burger), rather than breast meat as per usual in occidental countries. 

 France 
 In France, McDonald&apos;s also offer Kronenbourg 1664 in 25 or 33cl measures. The&quot;Croque McDo&quot;is also offered which is a toasted cheese and ham sandwich, similar to the French classic Croque-monsieur.

India Beef and pork products are not served to cater to Indian religious sensitivities. Chicken (only Halal) along with fish are the only meat products used. In India, meat and vegetarian meals are prepared in separate areas of the restaurant because of religious laws about preparation of food for vegetarians and meat-eaters . Cooks preparing vegetarian dishes wear distinctive green aprons . The Big Mac is replaced by the Maharaja Mac, which was originally made with lamb but is now made with chicken.

In the kosher branches they don&apos;t serve either. Malaysia There is a special menu named Prosperity Burger only for the Chinese New year festive season. There is also the Ayam Goreng McD which literally translated means McD&apos;s Fried Chicken, a crispy two piece fried chicken meal.

Fried chicken is also offered in Malaysia but it is not more popular than hamburgers as in neighbouring Indonesia, perhaps because of competition from Kentucky Fried Chicken and local fried chicken outlets. Morocco The McArabia is sold in the Middle East. In 2005, the McSahara was briefly sold.

 Facts and figures 
 A McDonald&apos;s store front in Times Square . The interior of a McCafé concept located in Dublin, Ireland . McDonald&apos;s restaurants are found in 119 countries [4] and territories around the world and serve nearly 47 million customers each day. McDonald&apos;s operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 1.5 million people [5] . The company also operates other restaurant brands , such as Piles Café, and has a minority stake in Pret a Manger . The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until completing its divestment in October 2006. Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza . On August 27, 2007, McDonald&apos;s sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners . [6] 

 Types of restaurants 
 Most standalone McDonald&apos;s restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or McDrive as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined; it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. In some countries&quot;McDrive&quot;locations near highways offer no counter service or seating. In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service. There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer Walk-Thru service in place of Drive-Thru. Specially themed restaurants also exist, such as the&quot;Solid Gold McDonald&apos;s,&quot;a 1950s rock-and-roll themed restaurant. In Victoria , British Columbia , there is also a McDonald&apos;s with a 24 carat (100%) gold chandelier and similar light fixtures. The site of the first McDonald&apos;s to be franchised by Ray Kroc is now a museum in Des Plaines , Illinois . The building is a replica of the original, which was the ninth McDonald&apos;s restaurant. To accommodate the current trend for high quality coffee and the popularity of coffee shops in general, McDonald&apos;s introduced McCafés. The McCafé concept is a café -style accompaniment to McDonald&apos;s restaurants. McCaféis a concept of McDonald&apos;s Australia , starting with Melbourne in 1993. Today, most McDonald&apos;s in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald&apos;s restaurant. In Tasmania there are McCafés in every store, with the rest of the states quickly following suit. After upgrading to the new McCafe look and feel, some Australian stores have noticed up to a 60% increase in sales. As of the end of 2003 there were over 600 McCafés worldwide. Some locations are connected to BP gas stations / convenience stores , [7] while others called McDonald&apos;s Express have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall . Other McDonald&apos;s are located in Wal-Mart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops . [8] Business View Of McDonalds McDonald&apos;s Corporation earns revenue as an investor in properties, a franchiser of restaurants, and an operator of restaurants. Approximately 15% of McDonald&apos;s restaurants are owned and operated by McDonald&apos;s Corporation directly. The remainder are operated by others through a variety of franchise agreements and joint ventures. The McDonald&apos;s Corporation&apos;s business model is slightly different from that of most other fast-food chains. In addition to ordinary franchise fees and marketing fees, which are calculated as a percentage of sales, McDonald&apos;s may also collect rent , which may also be calculated on the basis of sales. As a condition of many franchise agreements, which vary by contract age, country and location, the Corporation may own or lease the properties on which McDonald&apos;s franchises are located. In most, if not all cases, the franchisee does not own the location of its restaurants. The UK business model is different, in that fewer than 30% of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald&apos;s trains its franchisees and others at Hamburger University in Oak Brook , Illinois . In other countries McDonald&apos;s restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald&apos;s Corporation and other, local entities or governments. As a matter of policy, McDonald&apos;s does not make direct sales of food or materials to franchisees, instead organizing the supply of food and materials to restaurants through approved third party logistics operators. According to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald&apos;s. (According to a news piece on Fox News this figure is one in ten). The book also states that McDonald&apos;s is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef , pork , potatoes , and apples . The selection of meats McDonald&apos;s uses varies with the culture of the host country. 

 Redesign 
 A McDonald&apos;s in Shenango Township, Pennsylvania just outside of New Castle was rebuilt in 2007 with the new&quot;Forever Young&quot;look. In 2006, McDonald&apos;s introduced its&quot;Forever Young&quot;brand by redesigning all of their restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s. [10] [11] The new design will include the traditional McDonald&apos;s yellow and red colors, but the red will be muted to terra cotta, the yellow will turn golden for a more&quot;sunny&quot;look, and olive and sage green will be added. To warm up their look, the restaurants will have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Contemporary art or framed photographs will hang on the walls. The exterior will have golden awnings and a&quot;swish brow&quot;instead of the traditional double-slanted mansard roof . The new restaurants will feature areas: 

 The&quot;linger&quot;zone will offer armchairs, sofas, and Wi-Fi connections. The&quot;grab and go&quot;zone will feature tall counters with bar stools for customers who eat alone; Plasma TVs will offer them news and weather reports. The&quot;flexible&quot;zone will be targeted toward families and will have booths featuring fabric cushions with colorful patterns and flexible seating. Different music targeted to each zone. 

 Playgrounds 
 Some McDonald&apos;s in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds , called&quot;McDonald&apos;s PlayPlace&quot;(if indoors) or&quot;Playland&quot;(outdoors)[ citation needed ]. The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the USA, with many more being constructed soon after. Some PlayPlace playgrounds have been renovated into&quot;R Gym&quot;areas. &quot;R Gyms&quot;are in-restaurant play area that features interactive game zones designed for children aged 4 to 12. Equipped with stationary bicycles attached to video games, dance pads, basketball hoops, monkey bars, an obstacle course, and other games which emphasize physical activity. [9] The&quot;R Gym&quot;features the Toddler Zone, an active play environment with age appropriate games that develop physical coordination and social skills; the Active Zone, designed for children aged four-to-eight that promotes physical fitness through fun play; the Sports Zone which features a series of sport oriented activities to promote aerobic exercise for children aged 9-to-12; the Parent Zone which features seating and provides a monitoring area for their children; and the Dining Area which allows families to eat. 

 Controversies 
 Potted plants at a McDonald&apos;s. As a prominent example of the rapid globalization of American fast food industry, McDonald&apos;s is often the target of criticism for its menu, its expansion, and its business practices. For example, in 1990, two British activists, David Morris and Helen Steel , distributed leaflets entitled What&apos;s wrong with McDonald&apos;s? on the streets of London. McDonald&apos;s wrote to Steel and Morris demanding they desist and apologize, and, when they refused, sued them for libel in a case known colloquially as the McLibel case . In 2001, Eric Schlosser &apos;s book Fast Food Nation included criticism of McDonald&apos;s&apos;business practices. Among the critiques are allegations that McDonald&apos;s (along with other companies within the fast-food industry) uses its political influence to increase their own profits at the expense of people&apos;s health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brings into question McDonald&apos;s advertisement techniques where it targets children. While the book does mention other fast-food chains, it focuses primarily on McDonald&apos;s. In 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu , successfully sued McDonald&apos;s[ citation needed ] for misrepresenting their French fries as vegetarian. [12] Morgan Spurlock &apos;s 2004 documentary film Super Size Me said that McDonald&apos;s food was contributing to the epidemic of obesity in society, and failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald&apos;s announced that is eliminating the super size option, and created the adult happy meal. Anthony Bourdain on his show, No Reservations , has criticized McDonald&apos;s among other fast-food restaurants for its culinary blandness. In 1999 JoséBové vandalized a McDonald&apos;s in France to protest against the introduction of fast food in the region. [13] Marketing&amp;Advertisement McDonald&apos;s has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events from ranging from Little League to the Olympic Games , and makes coolers of orange drink with their logo available for local events of all kinds. Nonetheless, television has always played a central role in the company&apos;s advertising strategy. To date, McDonald&apos;s has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions. At times, it has run into trouble with its campaigns. 

 Controversies 
 In 1996, the British adult comic magazine Viz accused McDonald&apos;s of plagiarizing the name and format of its longstanding Top Tips feature, in which readers offer sarcastic tips. McDonald&apos;s had created an advertising campaign of the same name, which suggested the Top Tips (and then the alternative—save money by going to McDonald&apos;s). Some of the similarities were almost word-for-word: &quot;Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to Oxfam. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p.&quot;—Viz Top Tip, published May 1989. &quot;Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to a second-hand shop. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p.&quot;—McDonald&apos;s advert, 1996. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, which was donated to the charity Comic Relief . However, many Viz readers believed that the comic had given permission for their use, leading to Top Tips submissions such as:&quot;Geordie magazine editors. Continue paying your mortgage and buying expensive train sets ... by simply licensing the Top Tips concept to a multinational burger corporation.&quot; In 2003, a ruling by the UK Advertising Standards Authority determined that the corporation had acted in breach of the codes of practice in describing how its French fries were prepared. [3] A McDonald&apos;s print ad stated that&quot;after selecting certain potatoes&quot;&quot;we peel them, slice them, fry them and that&apos;s it.&quot;It showed a picture of a potato in a McDonald&apos;s fries box. In fact the product was sliced, pre-fried, sometimes had dextrose added, was then frozen, shipped, and re-fried and then had salt added. As part of a broader industry concession to the US Federal Trade Commission , on July 18 , 2007 the company agreed to limiting its advertisements directed to the under-12 demographic to two Happy Meals &quot;containing less than 600 calories , and derive no more than 35 percent of calories from fat , and have no more than 35 percent total sugar content.&quot;[ citation needed ] This can be compared to the World Health Organization &apos;s recommendation that free sugars not exceed 10 percent of energy consumed. [4] [ edit ] &quot;I&apos;d Hit It&quot;banner ad controversy The banners from the ad campaign. I&apos;d Hit It is the name of a McDonald&apos;s banner ad, part of the i&apos;m lovin&apos;it campaign. The phrase, which is slang for&quot;I&apos;d have sex with that person&quot;, proved controversial. 

 Current campaign 
 i&apos;m lovin&apos;it is an international branding campaign by McDonald&apos;s Corporation . It was created by Heye&amp;Partner, a longtime McDonald&apos;s agency based in Unterhaching , Germany , near Munich, and a member of the DDB Worldwide Communications Group, Inc. It was the company&apos;s first global advertising campaign and was launched in Munich , Germany on September 2 , 2003 , under the German title ich liebe es . The English part of the campaign was launched on September 29 , 2003 with the music of Tom Batoy and Franco Tortora (Mona Davis Music) and vocals by Justin Timberlake , in which the slogan appears. In 2007, after a public casting call which received 15,000 submissions, McDonald&apos;s selected 24 people to appear as part of the campaign. [5] Images of those chosen, who had submitted a story and digital photograph which&quot;capture[d] ... themes of inspiration, passion and fun,&quot;appear on McDonald&apos;s paper bags and cups worldwide. 

 Slogans, mottoes and jingles 

 Jingles 
 Perhaps the best-known slogan was&quot;You deserve a break today&quot;(a song sometimes incorrectly attributed to a young Barry Manilow [6] )in fact, written by jingle singer/songwriter Kenny Karen. In the accompanying TV commercial, there was almost no mention of food. Instead, the ad featured an all-male McDonald&apos;s cleaning crew, singing after-hours about their individual tasks, and emphasizing that&quot;at McDonald&apos;s it&apos;s clean!&quot;just before launching into the almost operatic chorus:&quot;You deserve a break today / So get up and get away / To McDonald&apos;s!&quot; 

 The Big Mac &apos;s song (1975): 
 Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun 

 McDonald&apos;s menu song (1988): 
 Big Mac, Mc DLT, a Quarter-Pounder with some cheese, Filet-O-Fish, a hamburger, a cheeseburger, a Happy Meal. McNuggets, tasty golden french fries, regular or larger size, and salads: chef salad or garden, or a chicken salad oriental. Big Big Breakfast, Egg McMuffin, hot hot cakes, and sausage. Maybe biscuits, bacon, egg and cheese, a sausage, Danish, hash browns too. And for dessert hot apple pies, and sundaes three varieties, a soft-serve cone, three kinds of shakes, and chocolaty chip cookies. And to drink a Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, and orange drink, A Sprite and coffee, decaf too, A lowfat milk, also an orange juice. I love McDonald&apos;s, good time great taste, and I get this all at one place... The good time great taste of McDonald&apos;s! 

 McDonald&apos;s today jingle (1992): 
 What you want is what you get at McDonald&apos;s today. 

 i&apos;m lovin&apos;it jingle (2003): 
 ba da ba ba baa... I&apos;m lovin&apos;it.

 Environmental record 
 In April 2008, McDonald&apos;s announced that 11 of its Sheffield restaurants have been using a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, waste from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald&apos;s plans to expand this project, however the lack of biomass power plants in the U.S. will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon. [19] In addition, in Europe, McDonald&apos;s has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for their diesel trucks. [20] Furthermore, McDonald&apos;s has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of their products. Although industries who use this product claim a carbon savings of 30% to 80%, a Guardian study shows otherwise. The results show that this type of plastic does not break down in landfills as efficiently as other conventional plastics. The extra energy it takes to recycle this plastic results in a higher output of greenhouse gases. Also, the plastics can contaminate waste streams causing other recycled plastics to become unsaleable. [21] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald&apos;s to demonstrate a continuous effort to solid waste reduction by inspecting its packaging for efficient material for and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials. [22] McDonald&apos;s report that they are committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant. [23] When McDonald’s received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress towards source reductions efforts. [24] For instance, an“average meal”in the 1970s—a Big Mac, fries, and a drink—required 46 grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25 grams, allowing a 46 percent reduction. [25] In addition, McDonald’s eliminated the need for intermediate containers for Coke by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving two million pounds of packaging annually. [26] Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by 24 million pounds annually. [27] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 Global Operations Issues&amp;SWOT Analysis 

 

 

 

 GLOBAL OPERATIONS ISSUES 
 Countries with McDonald&apos;s stores McDonald&apos;s has become emblematic of globalization , sometimes referred as the&quot; McDonaldization &quot;of society. The Economist magazine uses the&quot; Big Mac Index &quot;: the comparison of a Big Mac &apos;s cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies&apos; purchasing power parity . The EFTA countries are leading the Big Mac Index with the top 3 most expensive Big Mac &apos;s. Iceland has the most expensive Big Mac , followed by Norway and Switzerland . The brand is known informally as&quot;Mickey D&apos;s&quot;(in the US and Canada),&quot;Macky D&apos;s&quot;(in the UK and Ireland),&quot;Mäkkäri&quot;(in Finland),&quot;McDo&quot;(in France, Quebec, the Philippines and the Kansai region of Japan),&quot;Maccer&apos;s&quot;(in Ireland),&quot;Macarrannis&quot;(in Mexico),&quot;Maccas&quot;(in New Zealand and Australia),&quot;McD&apos;s&quot;(in New Zealand),&quot;Donken&quot;(in Sweden),&quot;de Mac&quot;(in the Netherlands), Mäkkes (in Germany),&quot;Mac&quot;(in Brazil and the Kanto region of Japan) or&quot;Mek&quot;(in Serbia). Thomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald&apos;s had gone to war with another. [29] However, the&quot; Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention &quot;is not strictly true. Careful historians point to the 1989 United States invasion of Panama , NATO&apos;s bombing of Serbia in 1999 , and the 2006 Lebanon War as exceptions. Some observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East (Stanford University Press, 1998, edited by James L. Watson) looked at the impact McDonald&apos;s had on East Asia , and Hong Kong in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald&apos;s was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. In East Asia in particular, McDonald&apos;s have become a symbol for the desire to embrace Western cultural norms. McDonald&apos;s have recently taken to partnering up with Sinopec , China&apos;s second largest oil company, in the People&apos;s Republic of China, as it begins to take advantage of China&apos;s growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. SWOT ANALYSIS OF MACDONALD’S Strengths MacDonald’s has a strong global presence with its nearest domestic competitor being only half its size, it is the market leader in both the domestic and international markets. It benefits from cost reduction through economies of scale because of its enormous size and its huge global presence allows it to diversify risk involved with the economic performance of specific countries. In international markets, it is well placed to expand and take advantage of long-term economic growth. The company also has a strong real estate portfolio. The company’s outlets are located in areas that are highly known for visibility, traffic volume and ease of access. MacDonald’s also has exceptional brand recognition. This strong brand recognition creates significant opportunities for the company. It is able to generate more sales because of its brand recognition. Through aggressive market planning it has been able to recapture its youth market once again. Weaknesses The food industry is really saturated. As a result of this, company has to deal with the prospect of looming market saturation, which could make it difficult to add new outlets. The market is forecast to grow by around 2% per year. There is also an increasing price competition driven by too many competitors, which reduces the company’s ability to increase revenue. Nevertheless, the swift of the company’s focus from a value menu to a more diverse one has recently limited the negative effect of the intense price competition that was traditionally taking place among the industry leaders. Lack of product innovation is another weakness of McDonalds. The last breakthrough for company was the Chicken McNugget in 1983, but again the company’s new strategy seems to have successfully dealt with the problem through the popularity of its new salads and other new products. Opportunities MacDonald’s sold its Donatos Pizzeria back to its founder in 2003 and discontinued Boston market operations outside of the US. The company will instead focus on Chipotle Grill which is the company’s most successful non MacDonald’s branded chain of restaurants. Also to increase profitability the company has slowed its expansion of McDonald’s restaurants so as to refurbish and change the image of current restaurants and adding new features such as Internet access. McDonald’s still has plans for more international expansion. Company still needs to penetrate in many countries especially in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Changing trends in eating habits toward more health eating, seen as a threat to McDonalds can also be seen as an opportunity. McDonalds introduced new premium salads and the same products will probably bring some more growth in foreign markets. Threats McDonald’s is exposed to changes in the global economy. The company’s aggressive international expansion has left it extremely vulnerable to other countries economic slowdown. Foreign currency fluctuation is also another problem global companies like McDonalds. The Fast food industry is becoming an increasingly competitive sector. Company keeps up with competitors through expensive promotional campaigns which leads to limited margins to gain market share. Company is also attempting to differentiate itself, with new formats and new menu items, but other fast food industry are doing the same too. McDonald’s, just like other fast food industry, often receives bad press because of its link obesity. Increased concern such as this has led the Food Standards Agency and the Department of Health in the UK to review the advertising of’junk’foods such as McDonalds to children. Top Competitors for MacDonald’s include: Yum Brands, Wendy’s International, jack in the Box , and Burger King Corporation. C ompetitor&amp;Conclusion COMPETITORS OF MACDONALD’S While McDonald&apos;s was establishing itself Domino&apos;s faced tough competition when it entered India, with homegrown players like Niruala&apos;s and Pizza Corner and multinational company like Pizza Hut and Wimpy&apos;s already having established themselves in the market. The home delivery concept that the company introduced had not yet caught on. Besides, Domino&apos;s was in a dilemma about how it should position pizza - as a meal or a snack? How far should they go in indianising the pizza so that it had mass appeal, and yet did not lose its identity? The entry of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) was greeted with protests of farmers, consumers, doctors and environmentalists. The fast food chain, which initially planned to set up 30 restaurants by 1998, was not able to do so, as its revenues did not pick up. KFC began to investigate whole issue more closely. Their findings revealed that KFC was perceived as a restaurant serving only chicken. CONCLUSION McDonald’s faces some difficult challenges. Key to its future success will be maintaining its core strengths—an unwavering focus on quality and consistency—while carefully experimenting with new options. These innovative initiatives could include launching higher-end restaurants under new brands that wouldn’t be saddled with McDonald’s fast-food image. The company could also look into expanding more aggressively abroad where the prospects for significant growth are greater. The company’s environment efforts, while important, should not overshadow its marketing initiatives, which are what the company is all about. Through analysis it is found that McDonald&apos;s Corporation remains the premier player in the fast food industry. McDonald&apos;s is well prepared for future growth. McDonald’s is tinkering with various possibilities in technology and design to try to ensure it is a hangout of choice in the future. Same-store sales have increased for 25 straight months in the key U.S. market. Its stock price nearly tripled over a two-year period, hitting a four-year high of $34.56 per share in March, but has since settled around $29. McDonald&apos;s has built one of the most successful fast food franchises in the world, with incredible growth for over three decades. The company&apos;s long-term strategy has focused on uniformity in its product, service, and the consistency of its information systems. However, with a slew of recent challenges, McDonald&apos;s has been able to adjust with each challenge and economic condition. The company&apos;s main new concern is portraying their sense of healthy eating habits and staying ahead of the competition.
