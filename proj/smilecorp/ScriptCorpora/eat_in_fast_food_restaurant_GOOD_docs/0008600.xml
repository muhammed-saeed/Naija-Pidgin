Heraa Restaurant: Try Traditional Meccan Food!
 LauraofArabia   2 reviews 
The best food in town! I could eat here every day! It has lots of variety and everything tastes home made. There is a family section. The restaurant is named after the cave in which the Prophet Muhammad received his revelation.

 Favorite Dish: Ruz Kabli , a traditional Meccan dish, is made using all the best spices - no skimping on the saffron.

Bin Dawood DateCentre: Dates in abundance!
 
 Helpfulness
 Muarrij   169 reviews 
The middle east is famous for its dates, especially Ajwa. These are in contrast very expensive to other dates.

There are many stores and outlets like the one in the picture that offer fresh or packed dates.

There are also many different varieties, you can even get stuffed dates, which come with a nut or other filling instead of the original stone/seed.

You can usually bargain with these guys. So make sure you get a good deal.

My preference however, is not to buy from the date factory, but instead buy from a store in one of the larger centres.

 Favorite Dish: Ajwa Kajoor, (Date), is the one that was recommended by the Prophet, as it contains special healing powers.

As a result it is also one of the most sought after too! They are smaller, quite black and taste quite sweet.

* TIP * - Whilst you are in Makkah, why not buy some dates and distribute them to the locals and the those less fortunate to be able to buy their own. :)

Al Baik: Close by the Holy Mosque
 
 Helpfulness
 marimar_72   730 reviews 
At the Makkah Towers you can find many restaurants,it is within walking distance from the Holy Mosque.
My personal faivourate is the AL-Baik chain.
It offers deep fried chicken served with garlic sauce and bread.

 Favorite Dish: This chain is only found in the west provence of Saudi Arabia.
Half a chicken with french fries and bread costs about 2 $.

A General Tip
 
 Helpfulness
 Digi   94 reviews 
From what I saw, there wasn&apos;t a lot of indegenous food in Saudi Arabia. I could be wrong of course, but the majority of what was available was American food, and food from countries with large expat populations, notably Pakistani and Indian food.

For me, the American food was good on the stomach, as some of the Pakistani restaurants in Mecca were not in the best of shape. The American restaurants like BK, KFC and such cater to the Saudis, and as such are kept in pretty good shape.

In Mecca you can find anything in the large Hilton hotel right outside the grand Masjid.

Here you can find a lot of eating places like the shops near the Alley to the hotels . The favourite food that I tried is the Grilled chicken ......delicious and of course the ice-creams and pistachios,dates ,tahini and so on and so forth.

 Favorite Dish: Besides grilled chicken , I love the pita bread filled with lovely mixture of god knows what? sorry... the picture above was taken from a restaurant secretly because ....no picture taking is allowed ....hence it was taken secretly and not well focus.
