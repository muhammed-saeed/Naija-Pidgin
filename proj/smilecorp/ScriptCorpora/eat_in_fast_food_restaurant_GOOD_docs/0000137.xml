Victoria and the rest of these reviewers have not a single clue about fried chicken perfectionism.  How do I know what I am talking about?  Thanks to the University of Louisville, I was able to travel to the Middle East.  I&apos;m also from Western Kentucky and part of the Volunteer Fire Department BBQ Burgoo Fundraiser variety.  In other words, I know about Kentucky and the world of fried chicken.

In the Middle East, they know the name of a few places in America.  One of them is Kentucki.  You see restaurants named Kentucky all over Arabia.  Every single one of them serves friend chicken.  If a town has 100 people, they have a single business and its a chicken restaurant named Kentucky.  That&apos;s how the Middle East rolls.

What kind of fried chicken do they love in Arabia?  They serve the kind like Indi&apos;s has.  It&apos;s also called broaster chicken.

The world agrees that Indi&apos;s has the kind of chicken that represents a place like Kentucky.

Haters be damned.

There are some things that can not be duplicated.

Indi&apos;s is one of them.

The decor is nonexistent. The staff is frequently abrupt. The neighborhood is blighted.

This ain&apos;t no fancy schmancy New American Gourmet Cuisine bullshit.

It&apos;s wings and greens and potato wedges done the way they ought to be.

The spicy chicken packs heat and flavor all the way through. It&apos;s crispy and tender and juicy.

I always leave feeling like I need a nap.

Ok I must update this review since we have had Indi&apos;s several more times since I wrote it.

Indi&apos;s SHOULD be the REAL Kentucky Fried Chicken that the state is known for.  KFC can&apos;t hold a candle to Indi&apos;s, it is SO delicious, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  When we pick up Indi&apos;s we always get two huge pans full that will last a couple or more days, plus a big tub of their sweet potatos (yams or whatever you southerners call em), and it&apos;s still less expensive than a little bucket of skinny measly KFC chicken.  Seriously, you won&apos;t be disappointed.

I have to agree with Victoria L, and I won&apos;t even try to compete with her inimitable style of writing.  But I will echo what she&apos;s said and recommend Indi&apos;s.  It&apos;s cheap, spicy, and down-home.  I used to live in Louisville and would occasionally go to Indi&apos;s at lunch while working on a data center that was being built down the street.  The only other restaurants in the immediate vicinity were McDonald&apos;s and White Castle.  Need I go on?

Edited to ask:  what&apos;s up, Louisvillians?  It seems to me like not many are using Yelp for Louisville-area businesses.  If you eat at a restaurant, good/bad/indifferent, spend 3 minutes when you get home telling us about it.  You&apos;ll be helping to build an awesome food database; you&apos;ll be glad you did.

Indi&apos;s is good, but I have had less than favorable experiences with the food at the Market St location.

The original in Louisville, on West Broadway @ 12th St is always spot on with the food unless the bars just closed(at 4am) and they have been hit hard!

The Fern Valley Rd location is good too, and always very clean.  The Lexington KY location is similar, as is the Poplar Level Rd location.

Cost effective GREAT food.

*Amazing* fried chicken!  I&apos;m eating the spicy fried chicken right now and it&apos;s wonderful.  The breast is very juicy all the way through, and the drumsticks are fall-apart tender.  The breading is not to thick and is perfectly cooked.  I will definitely return to try more things (the catfish perhaps?)!
