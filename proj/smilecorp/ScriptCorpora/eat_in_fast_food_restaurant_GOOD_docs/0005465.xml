WHY DOESN&apos;T MCDONALD&apos;S DELIVER?? THEY COULD CHARGE TRIPLE THE PRICE AND FAT LAZY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE GLOBE WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY TO GET THEIR ADDICTIVE FOODS DELIVERED TO THE DOOR! MCDONALD&apos;S DELIVERY SERVICE COMING UP?

McDonald&apos;s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) is one of the world&apos;s largest fast food restaurant chain, serving more than 46 million customers each day. At one time it was the largest global restaurant chain, but it has since been surpassed by multi-brand operator Yum! Brands ( which operates KFC, Taco Bell, etc.) and also by sandwich chain Subway .

It used to own the Chipotle Mexican Grill until 2006 and the Boston Market restaurant chain until 2007. Chipotle is actually very good food by today&apos;s restaurant standards. They also expanded the McDonald&apos;s menu in recent decades to include alternative meal options, such as salads and snack wraps, in order to try to capitalize on growing interest in health and wellness. Though it is clear that nothing is really&quot;healthy&quot;at a fast food restaurant. The concept is CHEAP and QUICK food. In order to produce enough quick, cheap food, the quality of the food is sacrificed. The movie, Food, Inc., has more information about this groing problem. These photographs and images depict quite well the real side of what McDonald&apos;s has become.

 



Each McDonald&apos;s restaurant is operated by a franchisee, an affiliate, or the corporation itself. The corporations&apos; revenues come from the rent, royalties and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. McDonald&apos;s revenues grew in 2007 to $22.8 billion.

McDonald&apos;s primarily sells trash but call it food, including: hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. These fast foods are all contributing to the growing obesity problem crisis in the nation and is quickly spreading across the globe. In response to obesity trends in western nations and in the face of criticism over the healthiness of its products, though it doesn&apos;t seem to be affecting sales much, the company has modified its menu to include such healthier alternatives as salads, wraps and fruit. However, people can go to a grocery store and acheive better quality and quantities of fruits and salads, why would you get it from McDonald&apos;s? Because we are Americans and so fucking lazy that we don&apos;t want to have to leave our vehicle to go into a grocery store to get it? Because we can keep our fat asses in our SUVs and get it from a drive-through window?

McDonalds points the obesity finger at the parents and self-indulgence. However look at this clip from their menu, containing the TOP 10 most caloric meat products. The ones with the most calories, fat, and sodium have the words Angus and Premium in the name to make it sound like they are better quality and healthier food.

Normally two chicks together like this would be HOT:

 

McDonald&apos;s has been criticized as long as recent minds can recall. Recently the Toronto Sun did an article, about McDonald&apos;s food appearing the same after 142 days . There was no mold, no decomposition, and even the lady&apos;s dogs didn&apos;t want to eat it. After reading the information, and talking to co-workers, I found there was many more similar stories. There has been article after article about how unhealthy and disgusting their food is.
