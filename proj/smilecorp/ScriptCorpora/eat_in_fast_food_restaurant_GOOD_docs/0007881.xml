 13-I OVERVIEW 

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from
employment discrimination based on their race, color, religion,
sex, national origin, opposition to practices made unlawful by
Title VII, or participation in Title VII proceedings. (2) This Section of the Compliance Manual
focuses on the prohibition against national origin discrimination.
In enacting this prohibition, Congress recognized that whether an
individual&apos;s ancestry is Mexican, Ukrainian, Filipino, Arab,
American Indian, or any other nationality, he or she is entitled to
the same employment opportunities as anyone else. Likewise, Title
VII&apos;s protections extend to all workers in the United States,
whether born in the United States or abroad and regardless of
citizenship status. Title VII articulates the national policy
against national origin discrimination in the workplace, while also
preserving an employer&apos;s freedom of choice to make sound business
decisions. (3) 

As the composition of the American workforce continues to
change, Title VII&apos;s prohibition against national origin
discrimination has become increasingly significant in ensuring
equality in employment opportunities. Today, about one in ten
Americans is foreign-born. (4) The
largest numbers of recent immigrants have come from Asia, including
China, India, and Vietnam, and from Latin America, including
Mexico, El Salvador, and Cuba. (5) Between 1990 and 2000, the proportion of the U.S. population of
Asian origin increased substantially. (6) The proportion of Hispanics also rose
substantially, and now one in eight Americans is Hispanic. (7) Immigration also has expanded diversity
among Black Americans, including new immigrants from the Caribbean
and sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1980, the proportion of Black
Americans who are foreign-born has risen by about 65 percent. (8) 

The American workforce has witnessed a corresponding increase in
diversity. In 1999, immigrant workers numbered 15.7 million,
accounting for 12 percent of U.S. workers. (9) Between 1990 and 1998, 12.7 million new
jobs were created in the United States, and 38 percent (5.1
million) were filled by immigrants. (10) In 2000, Hispanics, Asians, and
American Indians constituted 15.2 percent of the workforce employed
by private employers with 100 or more employees. (11) 

Many successful businesses have benefitted from a diverse labor
force. As noted in the Commission&apos;s report on the &quot;Best Practices
of Private Sector Employers,&quot; employers benefit from a diverse work
force by being able to &quot;draw talent and ideas from all segments of
the population&quot; and may gain a &quot;competitive advantage in the
increasingly global economy.&quot; (12) In its report &quot;Good for America,&quot; the Glass Ceiling Commission
noted that, as the workplace increasingly reflects the pluralism of
American society, employers are realizing that &quot;harmony - and
therefore the efficiency and effectiveness - of the workplace
requires greater sensitivity to cultural differences.&quot; (13) 

This Section is intended to be a practical resource on Title
VII&apos;s prohibition against national origin discrimination. It
defines &quot;national origin&quot; discrimination and discusses typical
employment situations in which national origin discrimination may
arise. This Section also is intended to fulfill the more specific
needs of employees, employers, and EEOC staff engaged in mediation
and enforcement. For example, it addresses steps an employer can
take to prevent national origin discrimination and provides
guidance for EEOC staff handling charges of national origin
discrimination. (14) It also
encourages employers to adopt &quot;best practices,&quot; proactive measures
that not only comply with Title VII but also address impediments to
equal employment opportunity. (15) 

 13-II WHAT IS &quot;NATIONAL ORIGIN&quot; DISCRIMINATION? 

Generally, national origin discrimination means treating someone
less favorably because that individual (or his or her ancestors) is
from a certain place or belongs to a particular national origin
group. (16) Title VII prohibits
employer actions that have the purpose or effect of discriminating
against persons because of their national origin. In addition,
Title VII prohibits discrimination against a person because he or
she is associated with an individual of a particular national
origin. (17) 

 A. Employment Discrimination Based on Place of Origin 

National origin discrimination includes discrimination because a
person (or his or her ancestors) comes from a particular place. The
place is usually a country or a former country, for example,
Colombia or Serbia. In some cases, the place has never been a
country, but is closely associated with a group of people who share
a common language, culture, ancestry, and/or other similar social
characteristics, for example, Kurdistan.

 B. Employment Discrimination Against a National Origin
Group 

A &quot;national origin group,&quot; often referred to as an &quot;ethnic
group,&quot; is a group of people sharing a common language, culture,
ancestry, and/or other similar social characteristics. (18) Title VII prohibits employment
discrimination against any national origin group, including larger
ethnic groups, such as Hispanics and Arabs, and smaller ethnic
groups, such as Kurds or Roma (Gypsies). (19) National origin discrimination
includes discrimination against American Indians or members of a
particular tribe. (20) 

Employment discrimination against a national origin group
includes discrimination based on:

 Ethnicity: Employment discrimination against
members of an ethnic group, for example, discrimination against
someone because he is Arab. National origin discrimination also
includes discrimination against anyone who does not belong
to a particular ethnic group, for example, less favorable treatment
of anyone who is not Hispanic. Physical, linguistic, or cultural traits: Employment discrimination against an individual because she has
physical, linguistic, and/or cultural characteristics closely
associated with a national origin group, for example,
discrimination against someone based on her traditional African
style of dress. (21) Perception: Employment discrimination against
an individual based on the employer&apos;s belief that he is a member of
a particular national origin group, for example, discrimination
against someone perceived as being Arab based on his speech,
mannerisms, and appearance, regardless of how he identifies himself
or whether he is, in fact, of Arab ethnicity. 

 C. Related Forms of Discrimination Prohibited by Title VII 

Title VII&apos;s prohibition against national origin discrimination
often overlaps with the statute&apos;s prohibitions against
discrimination based on race or religion. The same set of facts may
state a claim of national origin discrimination and religious
discrimination when a particular religion is strongly associated,
or perceived to be associated, with a specific national origin. (22) Similarly, discrimination based
on physical traits or ancestry may be both national origin and
racial discrimination. If a claim presents overlapping bases of
discrimination prohibited by Title VII, each of the pertinent bases
should be asserted in the charge.
 
 EXAMPLE 1
NATIONAL ORIGIN AND RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION 

Thomas, who is Egyptian, alleges that he has been harassed by
his coworkers about his Arab ethnicity. He also has been subjected
to derogatory comments about Islam even though he has told his
coworkers that he is Christian. Thomas&apos; charge should assert both
national origin and religious discrimination.
 
 EXAMPLE 2
NATIONAL ORIGIN AND RACE DISCRIMINATION 

Toni alleges that she was not hired for a server position in a
Greek restaurant based on her Chinese ethnicity and physical
features. Toni&apos;s charge should assert both national origin and race
discrimination.
 
A significant difference between Title VII&apos;s coverage of
national origin and religion relates to accommodation. Title VII
only requires accommodation of religious practices.
Pursuant to this requirement, an employer must modify workplace
policies that conflict with religious practices unless doing so
would result in an undue hardship to the operation of the
employer&apos;s business. For example, an employer would be required to
provide an exception to a dress code to accommodate an employee&apos;s
religious attire unless doing so would result in undue hardship. If
the modification imposed only a minor financial or administrative
burden on the employer, it would not impose an undue hardship.

While accommodation requirements do not apply to national
origin, Title VII prohibits employers from imposing more
restrictive workplace policies on some national origin (or
religious) groups than on others. For example, an employer may not
require that Hispanic workers wear business attire while permitting
non-Hispanic workers in similar positions to wear more casual
attire. However, an employer could impose the same dress code on
all workers in similar jobs, regardless of their national origin,
as long as the policy was not adopted for discriminatory reasons
and is enforced evenhandedly. (23) 

 13-III EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS 

Title VII prohibits employers from basing employment decisions
on an individual&apos;s national origin. Any discriminatory employment
decision is covered by Title VII, including: (24) 

 Recruitment Hiring Promotion Transfer Wages and benefits Work assignments Leave Training and apprenticeship programs Discipline Layoff and termination 

The following subsections discuss the application of Title VII&apos;s
bar on national origin discrimination to various types of
employment decisions.

 A. Recruitment 

 1. Application of Title VII to Recruitment 

Title VII prohibits employers from engaging in recruitment
practices that discriminate on the basis of national origin. Thus,
an employer may not recruit individuals belonging to some national
origin groups while deliberately not recruiting members of other
national origin groups. Nor may an employer adopt certain
recruitment practices, such as word-of-mouth recruitment, where
such practices have the purpose or effect of discriminating against
particular national origin groups.

Because employment agencies are covered by Title VII, they may
not comply with requests from employers to engage in discriminatory
recruitment or referral practices. Thus, a placement agency may not
honor a client request to exclude Arab or South Asian applicants.
Recruiters also may not independently screen out job seekers or
applicants on the basis of national origin, religion, or any other
characteristic covered by Title VII.

Finally, coverage of Title VII also applies to temporary
agencies with respect to referrals and treatment of employees on
the job. For instance, if a temporary agency learns that one of its
employees was involuntarily transferred by a client from a position
that involves public contact to a lower-paying position because of
perceptions about her national origin, the agency should insist
that the client return the employee to the former position. If the
client refuses, the agency should offer to assign the worker to
another client at the same rate of pay, and decline to assign other
employees to the same worksite unless the client changes its
discriminatory practices. A temporary agency that fails to take
reasonable steps to remedy discrimination by a client may be
jointly liable for any discriminatory actions taken against the
agency&apos;s employees while assigned to the client. (25) 

 2. Best Practices 

A common employer practice is to use a variety of recruitment
and hiring techniques, some of which are low cost, including job
fairs and open houses, professional associations, search firms, and
internships and scholar programs. This approach casts a wide net
for talent and is more likely to result in a diverse pool of job
seekers. (26) Specialized
publications or websites, including those directed to particular
communities, may be effective tools for these purposes. Some
recruitment methods, such as word-of-mouth hiring, are less likely
to reach a diverse pool of job seekers and may tend to reinforce
the make-up of the existing work force to the exclusion of other
qualified individuals.

Employment advertisements should notify prospective applicants
of all qualifications, including any qualifications related to
language ability. For example, employment advertisements for
positions where English skills are required by business necessity
should specify such requirements. (27) Advertisements should state that the
employer is an &quot;equal opportunity employer.&quot;

 B. Hiring, Promotion, and Assignment 

 1. Application of Title VII to Hiring, Promotion, and
Assignment 

Title VII prohibits hiring, promotion, and assignment decisions
that are based on national origin.
 
 EXAMPLE 3
UNLAWFUL HIRING DECISION 

Anu is a woman of Bangladeshi ancestry who wears a sari. She is
offered a position at XYZ Bakery after a phone interview. When she
reports for the first day of work, she is told by the manager who
interviewed her that the bakery has found someone &quot;better suited&quot;
for the position. Anu files an EEOC charge alleging discrimination
based on national origin. She believes that the bakery&apos;s manager
changed his mind about hiring her after meeting her in person and
seeing that she is South Asian. The EEOC investigation reveals that
the bakery hired an Hispanic woman for the position one week after
turning Anu away and that Anu and the selectee possessed comparable
qualifications. Under the circumstances, the evidence establishes
that the employer has provided a false reason for its action as a
pretext for unlawful discrimination.
 
Customer Preference

In addition, employers may not rely on coworker, customer, or
client discomfort or preference as the basis for a discriminatory
action. If an employer takes an action based on the discriminatory
preferences of others, the employer is also discriminating.
 
 EXAMPLE 4
EMPLOYMENT DECISION BASED ON CUSTOMER PREFERENCE 

Alexi, a Serbian-American college student, applies to work as a
cashier at a suburban XYZ Discount store. Although Alexi speaks
fluent English, the manager who conducts the routine interview
comments about his name and noticeable accent, observing that XYZ&apos;s
customers prize its &quot;all-American image.&quot; Alexi is not hired. XYZ
has subjected Alexi to unlawful national origin discrimination if
it based the hiring decision on assumptions that customers would
have negative perceptions about Alexi&apos;s ethnicity.
 
Assignment

Employers may not assign applicants or employees to certain
positions based on national origin. (28) 
 
 EXAMPLE 5
UNLAWFUL ASSIGNMENT BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN 

XYZ Pizza Palace decides to open a restaurant at a suburban
shopping mall. It runs an advertisement in local newspapers
recruiting for positions in food preparation, serving, and
cleaning. Carlos, an Hispanic man with a few years of experience as
a server at other restaurants, applies for a position with XYZ and
states a preference for a server position. Believing that Hispanic
employees would be better suited for positions with limited public
contact at this location, XYZ offers Carlos a position in cleaning
or food preparation even though he is as well qualified for a
server position as many non-Hispanic servers employed by XYZ. Under
the circumstances, XYZ has unlawfully assigned Carlos to a position
based on his national origin.
 
Similarly, employers may not limit promotional opportunities
based on national origin.
 
 EXAMPLE 6
UNLAWFUL LIMITATION OF PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON NATIONAL
ORIGIN 

Raj, who is Indian, is a computer programmer for XYZ Information
Technology Consultants. Raj applies for a slot in XYZ&apos;s management
development program and is rejected. Raj files an EEOC charge
alleging that the rejection was based on his national origin. The
employer states that Raj was not selected because he was not as
qualified as other applicants. The investigation reveals that,
based on XYZ&apos;s written criteria, Raj had superior qualifications to
three non-Indian candidates selected for the program. The
investigation also reveals that since XYZ initiated the management
program, only one out of the fifteen candidates selected for the
program has been South Asian, even though nearly one-third of the
applicants and nearly one-half of the programming staff are South
Asian. The evidence establishes that XYZ unlawfully rejected Raj
for its management program based on his national origin.
 
Mixed-Motives Cases

Employment decisions that are motivated by both national origin discrimination and legitimate business reasons
violate Title VII. However, remedies in such &quot;mixed-motives&quot; cases
are limited if the employer would have taken the same action even
if it had not relied on national origin. The charging party may
receive injunctive relief and attorney&apos;s fees but is not entitled
to reinstatement, back pay, or compensatory or punitive damages. (29) 
 
 EXAMPLE 7
MIXED MOTIVES: LIMITATIONS ON REMEDIES 

Jane, a Chinese-American, was hired to fill a temporary position
as an assistant professor of philosophy at a major private
university. Several years later, she was rejected for a permanent
position in the Philosophy Department. A colleague tells Jane that
at the board meeting at which the permanent position and the
relative qualifications of the candidates were discussed, the
Department Chair, one of the five people on the hiring committee
for the position, stated, &quot;I don&apos;t care how brilliant she is - one
Asian in the Department is enough.&quot; Jane files an EEOC charge
alleging national origin discrimination based on this evidence.

The EEOC investigation reveals that the Department Chair did, in
fact, make the reported statement and that the other hiring
committee members generally defer to his hiring recommendations.
The investigation also reveals that Jane was less qualified than
the selectee. The selectee had numerous well-received publications
and lectures recently, but Jane had only published one academic
article in three years and had not spoken at conferences in her
field. Because the evidence establishes that the university would
have made the same decision even absent discrimination, Jane is
entitled to injunctive relief and attorney&apos;s fees, but not
instatement, back pay, or compensatory or punitive damages.
 
Security Requirements

In some circumstances, employers may justify hiring and other
selection decisions by relying on security requirements. Title VII
permits refusal to hire, refusal to refer, or termination, where an
individual does not meet job requirements that are imposed in the
interest of national security under any security program in effect
pursuant to federal statute or Executive Order. (30) Additionally, the Commission may not
review the substance of a security clearance determination or the
security requirement, even if it is allegedly based on national
origin. Accordingly, EEOC review of employment decisions involving
security clearances is very limited. However, the Commission can
review whether procedural requirements in making security clearance
determinations were followed without regard to an individual&apos;s
protected status. (31) For instance,
an employer may not deny procedural safeguards when revoking the
security clearances of Cuban-American employees that it grants to
other employees.

An employer also may adopt other security requirements for its
employees or applicants. Such requirements must be adopted for
nondiscriminatory reasons and applied in a nondiscriminatory
manner. For instance, an employer may require applicants of Middle
Eastern descent to undergo only the same background investigation
as applicants of other national origin groups. In addition,
employers do not violate Title VII by cooperating with requests by
law enforcement officers for access to employee personnel files. (32) 

 2. Best Practices 

Employers can reduce the risk of discriminatory employment
decisions by establishing written objective criteria for evaluating
candidates for hire or promotion and applying those criteria
consistently to all candidates. Likewise, in conducting job
interviews, employers can promote nondiscriminatory treatment by
asking the same questions of all applicants and inquiring about
matters related to the position in question. If an employer has
clearly defined criteria for employment decisions, managers can be
more confident that they are selecting the most qualified
candidates. (33) Appropriate
objective criteria for employment decisions will be tied to
business needs. Criteria that are not business-related sometimes
improperly screen out individuals based on national origin.
 
 EXAMPLE 8
REMOVING A JOB REQUIREMENT THAT MAY IMPROPERLY SCREEN OUT
INDIVIDUALS BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN 

 For many years, XYZ Tool Corporation has had an
apprenticeship program that trains participants in the skills
needed to become a journeyman machine mechanic. XYZ started as a
family-owned business and has limited the program to individuals
who are sponsored by current machine mechanics. In the course of
negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the local
union, XYZ and the union note that the number of applicants to the
program has declined steadily for the last ten years and that,
while there has been an increase in Filipino and Hispanic workers
in the local labor force, there are none in the apprenticeship
program. XYZ and the union agree to discontinue the personal
sponsorship requirement because it screens out people on the basis
of national origin and it is not related to the requirements of the
mechanic position. 
 
 C. Discipline, Demotion, and Discharge 

 1. Application of Title VII to Discipline, Demotion,
and Discharge 

 As with other employment decisions, discipline,
demotion, and discharge decisions may not be based on national
origin. 
 
 EXAMPLE 9
UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN 

Ahmed, who is Lebanese, was discharged from his position as a
city bus driver. According to the employer, Ahmed was discharged
because, while his performance was satisfactory, customers
complained that they were wary of riding with an obviously Middle
Eastern driver after the recent arrest of several suspected
terrorists in the same city. The employer has unlawfully discharged
Ahmed based on his national origin.
 
Discipline, demotion, and discharge decisions are typically
based on either employee misconduct or unsatisfactory work
performance. While neutral rules and policies regarding discipline,
demotion, and discharge generally do not violate Title VII, they
must be enforced in an evenhanded manner, without regard to
national origin.
 
 EXAMPLE 10
DISCRIMINATORY ENFORCEMENT OF TARDINESS POLICY 

XYZ Foods, a grocery store, has a written policy of docking
workers&apos; pay for being late. Stephanie, a Somali employee, was
docked pay as a penalty for being 15 minutes late on two occasions.
While other Somali workers have also been docked pay for being
late, Hmong workers have been given warnings or permitted to make
up the time for comparable violations. Because XYZ treats Somali
employees who violate its tardiness policy more severely than Hmong
employees who violate it, the company has discriminated against
Stephanie based on her national origin.
 
Employer decisions to discharge or &quot;lay off&quot; employees must be
based on nondiscriminatory reasons, such as seniority, or quality
or quantity of work, rather than national origin, religion, or
other prohibited factors.
 
 EXAMPLE 11
UNLAWFUL LAYOFF 

Bob, who is Jamaican, was laid off from his position as an
accountant with XYZ Medical Supply Co. Bob asks the employer why he
was laid off while others were retained and is told that his
performance was inferior to that of other accountants. Bob suspects
that the employer&apos;s reason is a pretext for national origin
discrimination and files an EEOC charge. The investigation reveals
that XYZ generally relies on seniority in making layoff decisions
among employees with satisfactory performance and only relies on
other factors, like comparative performance, when employees have
comparable levels of seniority. Bob had three years more seniority
than Phil and Susan, two non-Jamaican accountants who were not laid
off. Bob, Phil, and Susan all received performance evaluations from
the same supervisor commending them for &quot;excellent&quot; performance,
and all received year-end bonuses.

Under the circumstances, the evidence establishes that XYZ has
provided a false reason - performance - for laying off Bob. Bob had
the same &quot;excellent&quot; performance as two other accountants, and XYZ
failed to follow its normal layoff policy. Therefore, the evidence
establishes that Bob was laid off because of his national origin in
violation of Title VII.
 
 2. Best Practices 

Employers can best treat employees of different national origin
groups in a nondiscriminatory manner by developing and applying
clear objective criteria for discipline, demotion, and discharge
decisions. These policies should address issues related to employee
misconduct and unsatisfactory work performance. One common approach
for addressing misconduct is a progressive discipline policy
directed at correcting employee misconduct.

Employers also will benefit from carefully recording the
business reasons for disciplinary or performance-related actions
and sharing these reasons with the affected employees. In
appropriate circumstances, employers also may choose alternative
approaches, such as an employee assistance program. Because any
policy related to discipline or poor work performance will require
some exercise of managerial discretion, employers also may wish to
monitor the actions of inexperienced managers and encourage them to
consult with more experienced managers when addressing difficult
issues. (34) 

 13-IV HARASSMENT 

Harassment is one of the most common claims raised in national
origin charges filed with the EEOC. During the last decade, the
number of private sector national origin harassment charges filed
with the EEOC increased from 1,383 charges in fiscal year 1993 to
2,719 charges in fiscal year 2002. In fiscal year 2002, thirty
percent of all private sector national origin charges included a
harassment claim. The subsections below discuss Title VII&apos;s
prohibition against national origin harassment, offer practical
guidance on how employers can prevent unlawful harassment, and
outline steps that employees should take when they believe that
they have been harassed.

 A. Title VII &apos;s Prohibition Against National Origin
Harassment 

National origin harassment violates Title VII when it is so
severe or pervasive that the individual being harassed reasonably
finds the work environment to be hostile or abusive. (35) Harassment based on national origin
can take many different forms, including ethnic slurs, workplace
graffiti, or other offensive conduct directed towards an
individual&apos;s birthplace, ethnicity, culture, or foreign accent. A
hostile environment may be created by the actions of supervisors,
coworkers, or even nonemployees, such as customers or business
partners. Relevant factors in evaluating whether national origin
harassment rises to the level of creating a hostile work
environment may include any of the following:

 Whether the conduct was physically threatening or
intimidating; How frequently the conduct was repeated; Whether the conduct was hostile and/or patently offensive; The context in which the harassment occurred; and Whether management responded appropriately when it learned of
the harassment. (36) 

The following example illustrates the distinction between
&quot;merely offensive&quot; and unlawful conduct.
 
 EXAMPLE 12
OFFENSIVE CONDUCT BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN THAT VIOLATES TITLE
VII 

Muhammad, an Arab-American, works for XYZ Motors, a large
automobile dealership. His coworkers regularly call him names like
&quot;camel jockey,&quot; &quot;the local terrorist,&quot; and &quot;the ayatollah,&quot; and
intentionally embarrass him in front of customers by claiming that
he is incompetent. Muhammad reports this conduct to higher
management, but XYZ does not respond. The constant ridicule has
made it difficult for Muhammad to do his job. The frequent, severe,
and offensive conduct linked to Muhammad&apos;s national origin has
created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. (37) 
 
In contrast, the example below illustrates circumstances in
which conduct that may be offensive is not sufficiently severe or
pervasive to create a hostile work environment.
 
 EXAMPLE 13
OFFENSIVE CONDUCT BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN THAT DOES NOT VIOLATE
TITLE VII 

Henry, a Romanian emigrant, was hired by XYZ Shipping as a
dockworker. On his first day, Henry dropped a carton, prompting
Bill, the foreman, to yell at him. The same day, Henry overheard
Bill telling a coworker that foreigners were stealing jobs from
Americans. Two months later, Bill confronted Henry about an
argument with a coworker, called him a &quot;lazy jerk,&quot; and mocked his
accent. Although Bill&apos;s conduct was offensive, it was not
sufficiently severe or pervasive for the work environment to be
reasonably considered sufficiently hostile or abusive to violate
Title VII.
 
 B. Liability 

Employers and employees each play an essential role in
preventing national origin harassment. Failure by an employer to
take appropriate steps to prevent or correct harassment may
contribute to employer liability for unlawful harassment. Likewise,
failure by an employee to take reasonable steps to report
harassment may preclude the employee from being able to hold an
employer responsible for the harassment. When employers and
employees both take appropriate steps to prevent and correct
national origin harassment, offensive conduct generally will be
corrected before escalating to the point of violating Title
VII.

Generally, an employer will be liable for unlawful harassment by
a supervisor unless it can show the following:

 The employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct
promptly any harassing behavior, and The employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any
preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or
to avoid harm otherwise. (38) 

An employer is liable for unlawful national origin harassment by
coworkers or non-employees if the employer knew or should have
known about the harassment and failed to take immediate and
appropriate corrective action. (39) 

The most important step for an employer in preventing harassment
is clearly communicating to employees that harassment based on
national origin will not be tolerated and that employees who
violate the prohibition against harassment will be disciplined. In
addition, an employer should have effective and clearly
communicated policies and procedures for addressing complaints of
national origin harassment and should train managers on how to
identify and respond effectively to harassment. (40) 

Employees who are harassed should take appropriate steps at an
early stage to prevent the continuation of the objectionable
conduct. In some cases, an employee who is offended by a
supervisor&apos;s or coworker&apos;s conduct may feel he or she can raise it
directly with the individual who engaged in the objectionable
conduct. In other situations, where the employee believes that the
employer&apos;s intervention is required to prevent further harassment,
the employee should notify the official designated by the
employer&apos;s complaint or harassment procedures. In some
circumstances, it may be reasonable for the employee to notify
another appropriate official not specifically designated by the
employer to accept complaints, such as where the employer&apos;s
procedure requires the employee to report the harassment to his or
her direct supervisor and that individual is the alleged
harasser.

The following examples illustrate how the above practices may
affect employer liability.
 
 EXAMPLE 14
EMPLOYER NOT LIABLE FOR UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT BY A
SUPERVISOR 

Carla, a Guatemalan, claims that she was subjected to frequent
offensive comments based on sex and national origin by her
first-level supervisor. Carla was aware of the employer&apos;s
anti-harassment complaint procedures, but did not notify her
employer or explain her failure to follow those procedures. The
employer learned of the harassment from Carla&apos;s coworker, and
immediately conducted an investigation. The employer reprimanded
the supervisor and transferred him to another division. The company
is not liable for the harassment because it took reasonable
preventive and corrective measures and Carla unreasonably failed to
complain about the harassment.
 
 EXAMPLE 15
EMPLOYER LIABLE FOR UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT BY A
NON-EMPLOYEE 

Charles is a frequent visitor on XYZ Senior Community&apos;s
&quot;neighborhood days,&quot; when XYZ allows senior citizens in the
neighborhood to visit its residents. During his visits, Charles
often yells derogatory comments about Asians at Cheryl, a Filipino
employee, and has even pushed and tripped her on a few occasions.
Cheryl complains about the conduct to a manager, and is told that
XYZ cannot take any action against Charles because he is not a
resident. On subsequent visits, Charles continues to yell ethnic
slurs at Cheryl, and she files an EEOC charge. XYZ is liable for
the actions of Charles, a non-employee, because it had the power to
control Charles&apos;s access to the premises, was aware of Charles&apos;s
offensive conduct, and did not take corrective action.
 
 13-V LANGUAGE ISSUES (41) 

As the U.S. labor force has grown more ethnically diverse, the
number of workers who are not native English speakers has increased
dramatically. In the year 2000, approximately 45 million Americans
(17.5 percent of the population) spoke a language other than
English in the home. Of those individuals, approximately 10.3
million individuals (4.1 percent of the total population) spoke
little or no English, an increase from 6.7 million in the year
1990. (42) 

Employers sometimes have legitimate business reasons for basing
employment decisions on linguistic characteristics. However,
linguistic characteristics are closely associated with national
origin. Therefore, employers should ensure that the business reason
for reliance on a linguistic characteristic justifies any burdens
placed on individuals because of their national origin. The
subsections below provide guidance on employment decisions that are
based on foreign accent or fluency, and guidance on policies
requiring employees to speak only English while in the
workplace.

 A. Accent Discrimination 

Because linguistic characteristics are a component of national
origin, employers should carefully scrutinize employment decisions
that are based on accent to ensure that they do not violate Title
VII. (43) 

An employment decision based on foreign accent does not violate
Title VII if an individual&apos;s accent materially interferes with the
ability to perform job duties. This assessment depends upon the
specific duties of the position in question and the extent to which
the individual&apos;s accent affects his or her ability to perform job
duties. Employers should distinguish between a merely discernible
foreign accent and one that interferes with communication skills
necessary to perform job duties. (44) Generally, an employer may only base
an employment decision on accent if effective oral communication in
English is required to perform job duties and the individual&apos;s
foreign accent materially interferes with his or her ability to
communicate orally in English. Positions for which effective oral
communication in English may be required include teaching, customer
service, and telemarketing. Even for these positions, an employer
must still determine whether the particular individual&apos;s accent
interferes with the ability to perform job duties. The examples
below illustrate how to apply these principles.
 
 EXAMPLE 16
EMPLOYMENT DECISION WHERE ACCENT IS NOT A MATERIAL
FACTOR 

Anna, a Pakistani librarian in an elementary school, is
responsible for cataloguing, researching, and reading aloud to
young children. Her performance evaluations reflect that she is an
excellent cataloguer and researcher and that she can communicate
effectively with teachers and older children, but that some of the
youngest children have had difficulty understanding her due to her
accent. When her position is eliminated, Anna asks the local school
board to transfer her to a position at a high school that involves
cataloguing and researching but requires minimal student contact.
The school board appropriately grants Anna&apos;s transfer request
because Anna is qualified and her accent would not materially
interfere with her ability to perform the librarian position at the
high school.
 
 EXAMPLE 17
EMPLOYMENT DECISION WHERE ACCENT IS A MATERIAL FACTOR 

A major aspect of Bill&apos;s position as a concierge for XYZ Hotel
is assisting guests with directions and travel arrangements.
Numerous people have complained that they cannot understand Bill
because of his heavy Ghanaian accent. Therefore, XYZ notifies Bill
that he is being transferred to a clerical position that does not
involve extensive spoken communication. The transfer does not
violate Title VII because Bill&apos;s accent materially interferes with
his ability to perform the functions of the concierge position.
 
 B. Fluency Requirements 

 1. English Fluency 

Generally, a fluency requirement is permissible only if required
for the effective performance of the position for which it is
imposed. Because the degree of fluency that may be lawfully
required varies from one position to the next, employers should
avoid fluency requirements that apply uniformly to a broad range of
dissimilar positions.

As with a foreign accent, an individual&apos;s lack of proficiency in
English may interfere with job performance in some circumstances,
but not in others. For example, an individual who is sufficiently
proficient in spoken English to qualify as a cashier at a fast food
restaurant may lack the written language skills to perform a
managerial position at the same restaurant requiring the completion
of copious paperwork in English. (45) As illustrated below, the employer
should not require a greater degree of fluency than is necessary
for the relevant position.
 
 EXAMPLE 18
LAWFUL ENGLISH FLUENCY REQUIREMENTS 

Jorge, a Dominican national, applies for a sales position with
XYZ Appliances, a small retailer of home appliances in a
non-bilingual, English-speaking community. Jorge has very limited
skill with spoken English. XYZ notifies him that he is not
qualified for a sales position because his ability to effectively
assist customers is limited. However, XYZ offers to consider him
for a position in the stock room. Under these circumstances, XYZ&apos;s
decision to exclude Jorge from the sales position does not violate Title VII.
 
 2. Foreign Language Fluency 

With American society growing more diverse, employers have
increasingly required that some employees be fluent in languages
other than English. For example, a business that provides services
to Spanish-speaking customers might have a sound business reason
for requiring that some of its employees speak Spanish. As with
English fluency requirements, requirements for fluency in foreign
languages must actually be necessary for the positions for which
they are imposed.

A business with a diverse clientele may assign work based on
foreign language ability. For example, an employer may assign
bilingual Spanish-speaking employees to provide services to
customers who speak Spanish, while assigning employees who only
speak English to provide services to English-speaking customers. Of
course, employers should make such assignments based on language
ability. In most cases, employers also may lawfully assign
comparable work to employees based on their language skills, and
are not required by Title VII to provide additional compensation
for work that is performed in a foreign language. (46) 

 C. English-Only Rules 

Some employers have instituted workplace policies restricting
communication in languages other than English, often called
&quot;English-only rules.&quot; In fiscal year 2002, the Commission received
228 charges challenging English-only policies. The application of
Title VII to such rules is discussed below.

 1. Application of Title VII to English-Only Rules 

Title VII permits employers to adopt English-only rules under
certain circumstances. As with any other workplace policy, an
English-only rule must be adopted for nondiscriminatory reasons. An
English-only rule would be unlawful if it were adopted with the
intent to discriminate on the basis of national origin. Likewise, a
policy that prohibits some but not all of the foreign languages
spoken in a workplace, such as a no-Navajo rule, would be
unlawful.
 
 EXAMPLE 19
ENGLISH-ONLY RULE: INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION 

XYZ Textile Corp. adopts a policy requiring employees to speak
only English while in the workplace, including when speaking to
coworkers during breaks or when making personal telephone calls.
XYZ places Hispanic workers under close scrutiny to ensure
compliance and replaces workers who violate the rule with
non-Hispanics. Jose, a native Spanish speaker, files a charge with
the EEOC alleging that the policy discriminates against him based
on his national origin. XYZ states that the rule was adopted to
promote better employee relations and to help improve English
skills. However, the investigation reveals no evidence of poor
employee relations due to communication in languages other than
English. Nor are proficient English skills required for any of the
positions held by non-native English speakers. Because XYZ&apos;s
explanation is contradicted by the evidence, the English-only rule
is unlawful. (47) 
 
Even where an English-only rule has been adopted for
nondiscriminatory reasons, the employer&apos;s use of the rule should
relate to specific circumstances in its workplace. (48) An English-only rule is justified by
&quot;business necessity&quot; if it is needed for an employer to operate
safely or efficiently. The following are some situations in which
business necessity would justify an English-only rule:

 For communications with customers, coworkers, or supervisors
who only speak English In emergencies or other situations in which workers must speak
a common language to promote safety For cooperative work assignments in which the English-only rule
is needed to promote efficiency To enable a supervisor who only speaks English to monitor the
performance of an employee whose job duties require communication
with coworkers or customers 

The following is an example of a narrowly crafted English-only
rule promoting safety in the workplace.
 
 EXAMPLE 20
PERMISSIBLE ENGLISH-ONLY RULE: PROMOTING SAFETY 

XYZ Petroleum Corp. operates an oil refinery and has a rule
requiring all employees to speak only English during an emergency.
The rule also requires that employees speak in English while
performing job duties in laboratories and processing areas where
there is the danger of fire or explosion. The rule does not apply
to casual conversations between employees in the laboratory or
processing areas when they are not performing a job duty.
The English-only rule does not violate Title VII because it is
narrowly tailored to safety requirements. (49) 
 
 2. Best Practices 

In evaluating whether to adopt an English-only rule, an employer
should weigh business justifications for the rule against possible
discriminatory effects of the rule. While there is no precise test
for making this evaluation, relevant considerations include:

 Evidence of safety justifications for the rule Evidence of other business justifications for the rule, such as
supervision or effective communication with customers Likely effectiveness of the rule in carrying out
objectives English proficiency of workers affected by the rule (50) 

Before adopting an English-only rule, the employer should
consider whether there are any alternatives to an English-only rule
that would be equally effective in promoting safety or
efficiency.
 
 EXAMPLE 21
ENGLISH-ONLY RULE: NONDISCRIMINATORY ALTERNATIVE 

At a management meeting of XYZ Electronics Co., a supervisor
proposes that the company adopt an English-only rule to decrease
tensions among its ethnically diverse workforce. He reports that
two of the employees he supervises, Ann and Vinh, made derogatory
comments in Vietnamese about their coworkers. Because such examples
of misconduct are isolated and thus can be addressed effectively
under the company&apos;s discipline policy, XYZ decides that the
circumstances do not justify adoption of a facility-wide
English-only rule. To reduce the likelihood of future incidents,
XYZ supervisors are instructed to counsel line employees about
appropriate workplace conduct. (51) 
 
An employer should ensure that affected employees are notified
about an English-only rule and the consequences for violation. The
employer may provide notice by any reasonable means under the
circumstances, such as a meeting, e-mail, or posting. In some
cases, it may be necessary for an employer to provide notice in
English and in the other native languages spoken by its
workers. A grace period before the effective date of the rule also
may be required to ensure that all workers have received
notice.

 13-VI CITIZENSHIP-RELATED ISSUES (52) 

 A. Citizenship Requirements 

Discrimination based on citizenship violates Title VII&apos;s
prohibition against national origin discrimination under limited
circumstances. While Title VII does not prohibit citizenship
discrimination per se, citizenship discrimination does violate
Title VII where it has the &quot;purpose or effect&quot; of discriminating on
the basis of national origin. (53) For example, a citizenship requirement would be unlawful if it is a
&quot;pretext&quot; for national origin discrimination, or if it is part of a
wider scheme of national origin discrimination. (54) 
 
 EXAMPLE 22
CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT AS PRETEXT FOR NATIONAL ORIGIN
DISCRIMINATION 

Juanita is a Mexican citizen living in Houston, Texas, and is
authorized to work in the United States. She would like to apply
for a position as a tour guide with XYZ Tours, for which she meets
all of the stated qualifications except U.S. citizenship. Believing
the policy of requiring U.S. citizenship to be discriminatory, she
files a charge with the EEOC. The investigation reveals that XYZ
recently employed several tour guides who were citizens of northern
European countries, but has never hired citizens of South American
or African countries as tour guides. Based on these facts, the
investigator concludes that XYZ&apos;s citizenship requirement is a
pretext for unlawful national origin discrimination.
 
 EXAMPLE 23
CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT THAT IS PART OF WIDER SCHEME OF NATIONAL
ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION 

Luis, a Mexican citizen, files a charge with the EEOC alleging
that he was not promoted from his unskilled laborer position to a
skilled craft position by XYZ Petroleum Company because of his
Mexican national origin. The investigation reveals that XYZ has
many Mexican-Americans employed in unskilled positions, but has a
policy requiring that all of its higher-paid skilled workers be
U.S. citizens. In addition, Hispanic applicants for entry-level,
unskilled jobs are rejected at a much higher rate than non-Hispanic
applicants, even accounting for differences in qualifications
and/or experience. Hispanic employees also are generally given less
favorable work assignments and paid less than non-Hispanic
employees who are performing similar work. Under the circumstances,
the evidence establishes that the citizenship requirement is part
of a wider scheme of unlawful national origin discrimination and
was adopted for unlawful discriminatory reasons.
 
Federal law requires U.S. citizenship for most federal civil
service employment. (55) For such
employment, the failure to hire an individual because he or she is
not a U.S. citizen does not constitute national origin
discrimination in violation of Title VII.

In addition to national origin claims under Title VII,
individuals who are not U.S. citizens may have claims under other
federal statutes, which are enforced by other agencies:

 Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986
(IRCA): IRCA prohibits employers with four or more
employees from discriminating because of citizenship status against
U.S. citizens and certain classes of foreign nationals authorized
to work in the United States with respect to hiring, referral, or
discharge. (56) IRCA also prohibits
national origin discrimination by employers with between four and
fourteen employees. IRCA&apos;s nondiscrimination requirements are
enforced by the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related
Unfair Employment Practices, Civil Rights Division, at the
Department of Justice. (57) Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): The FLSA
requires, among other things, that covered workers, including those
who are not U.S. citizens, be paid no less than the federally
designated minimum wage. The FLSA is enforced by the Employment
Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division of the Department
of Labor (DOL). (58) Special Visa Programs: Employment of foreign
nationals under special visa programs, such as H-1B and H-2A visas,
also may be subject to certain requirements related to wages,
working conditions, or other aspects of employment. The Wage and
Hour Division of DOL investigates alleged violations of some visa
program requirements, including H-1B and H-2A visa requirements. (59) 

 B. Coverage of Foreign Nationals 

Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Equal Pay Act (the EEO
statutes) prohibit discrimination against employees who work in the
United States for covered employers, regardless of citizenship (60) or work authorization. While
federal law prohibits employers from employing individuals lacking
work authorization, employers who nonetheless employ undocumented
workers are prohibited from discriminating against those workers. (61) 

The Commission has taken the position that foreign nationals are
covered by the EEO statutes when they apply for U.S.-based
employment from outside the United States. (62) If the employment is outside the
United States, however, individuals who are not U.S. citizens are not protected by the U.S. EEO statutes.

 13-VII RELATED ISSUES 

 A. Retaliation 

Title VII prohibits retaliation against an individual because he
or she has opposed unlawful national origin discrimination or
participated in the complaint process by filing a charge,
testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII. For a
detailed discussion of the prohibition against retaliation, refer
to Section 8: Retaliation , EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume
II (BNA) (1998).
 
 EXAMPLE 24
RETALIATION VIOLATES TITLE VII 

In an EEOC investigation, Daniel provided testimony that a
coworker was subjected to harassment based on her Polish ancestry.
After participating in the EEOC investigation, Daniel was no longer
assigned overtime, and he filed an EEOC charge alleging that the
denial of overtime was discriminatory. Daniel&apos;s employer states
that Daniel was not assigned overtime because there was less work.
The investigation reveals no significant change in the amount of
overtime available before and after Daniel was removed from the
list. Other employees with similar qualifications as Daniel have
continued to be assigned overtime at approximately the same rate.
These facts establish that Daniel has been subjected to retaliation
in violation of Title VII for participating in an EEOC
investigation.
 
 B. Foreign Employers in the United States and American
Employers Overseas 

With a few exceptions, foreign employers doing business in the
United States are covered by Title VII, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Equal
Pay Act to the same extent as American employers. Similarly,
American employers overseas are generally covered in the same
manner as American employers located in the United States with
respect to employees who are U.S. citizens. (63) For further discussion of these
issues, refer to Enforcement Guidance on Application of Title
VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act to Conduct Overseas and
to Foreign Employers Discriminating in the United States (1993); and Policy Guidance on Application of the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the Equal Pay
Act of 1963 (EPA) to American Firms Overseas, Their Overseas
Subsidiaries, and Foreign Firms (1989).

 1. Foreign Employers 

A foreign employer doing business in the United States is
generally covered by Title VII and the other EEO statutes to the
same extent as an American employer. However, a foreign employer
may discriminate in favor of its own nationals when permitted by a
treaty. (64) The EEO statutes do not
apply to employment actions taken by foreign employers
overseas.
 
 EXAMPLE 25
TREATY PERMITTING DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN
NATIONALS 

XYZ Automotive, a Japanese automaker with a factory in Kansas,
hired Pam, an American citizen of Japanese ancestry, for an
executive position. John files a charge with the EEOC alleging that
he was not selected for the position because he is not of Japanese
ancestry. XYZ states that it lawfully considered Pam&apos;s Japanese
ancestry pursuant to a treaty permitting it to favor Japanese
applicants. The investigation reveals that the treaty permits XYZ
to favor Japanese citizens, not individuals of Japanese ancestry.
Because the treaty only permits favoritism based on Japanese citizenship and XYZ has instead engaged in favoritism
based on Japanese national origin , XYZ has subjected John
to national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII.
 
 2. American Employers Overseas 

Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA generally prohibit
discrimination against U.S. citizens by American employers
operating overseas. (65) An employer
operating abroad that is incorporated in the United States will
generally have sufficient ties to the United States to be deemed an
American employer. Where an employer is not incorporated in the
United States or it is not incorporated at all, e.g., a
partnership, various factors should be considered to determine if
the employer has sufficient connections with the United States to
make it an American employer. Factors to consider include the
employer&apos;s principal place of business, the nationality of dominant
shareholders and/or those holding voting control, and the
nationality and location of management.

The EEO statutes also prohibit discrimination by a foreign
employer that is controlled by an American employer. The
determination of whether an American employer controls a foreign
employer is based on the interrelation of operations, common
management, centralized control of labor relations, and common
ownership or financial control of the American employer and the
foreign employer. (66) 
 
 APPENDIX A HOW TO FILE A CHARGE 

If you believe you have been discriminated against by an
employer, labor union, or employment agency when applying for a job
or while on the job because of your race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, (67) age (40 or
over), or disability, or believe that you have been discriminated
against because you opposed unlawful discrimination or participated
in an equal employment opportunity (EEO) proceeding, you may file a
charge of discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC). Charges against private sector and local and
state government employers may be filed in person, by mail, or by
telephone by contacting the nearest EEOC office. If there is no
EEOC office in the immediate area, call toll free 1-800-669-4000 or
1-800-669-6820 (TTY) for more information. To avoid delay, call or
write beforehand if you need special assistance, such as an
interpreter, to file a charge. Federal sector employees and
applicants should contact the EEO office of the agency responsible
for the alleged discrimination to initiate EEO counseling.

There are strict time frames in which charges of employment
discrimination must be filed or your agency&apos;s EEO office must be
contacted. When charges or complaints are filed beyond these time
frames, you may not be able to obtain any remedy. Charges against
private sector or state or local governments must be filed with
EEOC within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act. The time
frame is extended to 300 days if the alleged discrimination arose
in a state or locality that has a fair employment practices agency
(FEPA) with the authority to grant or seek relief for the alleged
discrimination. Federal sector employees and applicants must
initiate EEO counseling at the agency responsible for the alleged
discrimination within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory event.
Allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin are timely if at least one incident of harassment
that is part of the larger pattern of harassment occurred within
the filing period.

If you wish to remain anonymous during the period when an EEOC
charge is being processed involving a private sector or state or
local government employer, another individual or an organization
may file a charge on your behalf. In some circumstances, an EEOC
Commissioner may file a charge against a private sector or state or
local government employer. Federal sector employees and applicants
may remain anonymous during EEO counseling, but lose the right to
anonymity after filing a formal complaint.
 
 APPENDIX B WHEN A CHARGE IS FILED AGAINST YOUR COMPANY 

This appendix provides general information regarding the
processing of a charge alleging discrimination by a private sector
or state or local government employer under the EEO statutes. (68) Anyone who believes that his or
her employment rights have been violated because of race, color,
sex, religion, national origin, age (40 or over), disability,
opposition to unlawful discrimination, or participation in an EEO
proceeding may file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. A
charge does not constitute a finding that your company did, in
fact, discriminate. The EEOC has a responsibility to investigate
and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe
discrimination occurred.

That process begins with the EEOC sending your company a copy of
the charge, which will briefly identify the charging party, the
basis (e.g., race, religion, etc.) and issues (hiring, promotion,
etc.), and the date(s) of the alleged discrimination. You also may
be asked to provide a response to the charge and supporting
documentation. The EEOC also may ask to visit your work site or to
interview some employees. It is important that your company retain
records relating to issues under investigation as a result of the
charge until the charge or any lawsuit based on the charge is
resolved.

In some cases, the EEOC notice may offer mediation as a method
of resolving the charge before an investigation. EEOC&apos;s mediation
program is a free service, and participation is voluntary. The
process is confidential, and there is a firewall (i.e., total
separation) between the mediation program and EEOC&apos;s enforcement
activities. Mediation provides employers and charging parties the
opportunity to reach mutually agreeable solutions early in the
process. The EEOC will notify your company if a charge is eligible
for mediation. In the event that mediation does not succeed, the
charge is referred for investigation.

If the EEOC finds reasonable cause to believe that your company
discriminated against a charging party, it will invite you to
conciliate the charge (i.e., the EEOC will offer you a chance to
resolve the matter informally). In some cases, where conciliation
fails, the EEOC will file a civil court action. If the EEOC does
not find discrimination, or if conciliation fails and the EEOC
chooses not to file suit, it will issue a notice of a right to sue,
which gives the charging party 90 days to file a civil court
action. The EEOC also must issue a notice of right to sue to the
charging party on request if its handling of the charge is still
pending after 180 days, or earlier if the EEOC knows it will take
more than 180 days to complete action on the charge.

In all cases, your company should remember that it is unlawful
to retaliate against the charging party for filing the charge, even
if you believe the charge is without merit.

You should submit a response to the EEOC and provide the
information requested, even if you believe the charge is frivolous.
If the charge was not dismissed by the EEOC when it was received,
that means there was some basis for proceeding with further
investigation. There are many cases where it is unclear whether
discrimination may have occurred and an investigation is necessary.
You are encouraged to present any facts that you believe show the
allegations are incorrect or do not amount to a violation of the
law.

Workers , EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II; and Section 623: Speak-English-Only Rules and Other Language Policies , EEOC

 2. Title VII, which the EEOC enforces, covers
employers with at least 15 employees. Note that the Immigration
Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) prohibits national origin
discrimination in hiring and discharge by employers with between
four and fourteen employees. IRCA&apos;s nondiscrimination requirements
are enforced by the Office of Special Counsel for
Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC), Civil Rights
Division, at the Department of Justice. See generally http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc (OSC home page). For detailed
information on referral procedures for charges that may be within
the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel, EEOC
investigators should consult the Memorandum of Understanding

Practices (1997), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/oscmou.html.

 3. As the Supreme Court stated in Price

by more than one race whereas in the 1990 census, they were
required to choose only one race. Because of this change, the 1990

Highway Authority , 704 F. Supp. 1531, 1532 (N.D. Ill. 1989),
the court found that discrimination based on an employee&apos;s status
as a Gypsy constitutes national origin discrimination under Title
VII, which prohibits discrimination based on &quot;ethnic distinctions
commonly recognized at the time of the discrimination.&quot;

 20. Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project
Agric. Improvement&amp;Power Dist. , 154 F.3d 1117 (9th Cir.
1998), cert. denied , 528 U.S. 1098 (2000). Title VII
permits preferential treatment of American Indians under limited
circumstances, though the exemption does not permit preferential
treatment of members of one tribe over members of another tribe. 42
U.S.C.§2000e-2(i); see EEOC Policy Statement on Indian Preference Under Title VII , 8 FEP Manual (BNA)
405:6647-54 (1988).

 21. If the alleged employment discrimination
is based on traits linked to national origin, then the alleged
discriminator need not know the particular national origin group to
which the charging party belongs. For example, discrimination
against an individual because she has a &quot;foreign-sounding&quot; accent
is a covered form of national origin discrimination. 45 Fed. Reg.
85,632, 85,633 (Dec. 29, 1980) (preamble to &quot;Guidelines on
Discrimination Because of National Origin&quot;).

 22. Increasing ethnic diversity has been
reflected in greater religious diversity in the workplace. In a
survey of human resource professionals conducted by the Society for
Human Resource Management and the Tanenbaum Center for
Interreligious Understanding, 36 percent of respondents reported
that more religions were represented in their workforces compared
with five years ago. See http://www.shrm.org/press/releases/default.asp?page=062501d.htm.

 23. As stated above, the employer still has
a duty to accommodate religious practices under Title VII. For a
detailed discussion of religious accommodation and undue hardship,
refer to 29 C.F.R.§1605.2.

 24. While this document focuses on
discrimination by employers, Title VII also prohibits
discriminatory practices by labor organizations, including union
membership and representation, and employment agencies, including
referral practices.

 25. For more information on liability for
discrimination by clients, refer to Enforcement Guidance on Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by
Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms ,

cases, refer to the Commission&apos;s Revised Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory (BNA)
(1992), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/disparat.html.

 30. 42 U.S.C.§2000e-2(g). U.S. export
laws also restrict the transfer of technology to foreign nationals
from certain countries. Employer actions taken pursuant to
requirements under U.S. export laws do not violate Title VII. See generally http://www.bxa.doc.gov (Bureau of Industry
and Security home page).

 31. See Tenenbaum v. Caldera , 45
Fed. Appx. 416, 418 (6th Cir. 2002) (unpublished) (courts may
review cases in which an agency violates its own regulations in
making a security clearance determination but may not review the
substance of the clearance determination).

 32. See , e.g. , USA PATRIOT
Act of 2001, 50 U.S.C.§1861.

(2d ed. 1991); see also Dennis K. Reischl&amp;Ralph
Smith, The Federal Manager&apos;s Guide to Discipline (3d ed. 1997).

 35. Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson ,
477 U.S. 57 (1986).

 36. For guidance on evaluating whether
national origin harassment creates a hostile work environment,
refer to EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual
Harassment (1990), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/currentissues.html; and EEOC Enforcement
Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. (1994), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/harris.html. While
these documents specifically address sexual harassment, most of the
same principles also are relevant to Title VII&apos;s prohibition
against national origin harassment.

 37. The facts in this example are similar to
those in Amirmokri v. Baltimore Gas&amp;Electric Co. , 60
F.3d 1126 (4th Cir. 1995) (finding that Iranian emigrant employed
as an engineer at a nuclear power plant established a prima facie
case of national origin harassment).

 38. The standard for employer liability for
harassment by supervisors was established by the Supreme Court in
two leading decisions addressing sexual harassment: Burlington
Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth , 524 U.S. 742 (1998), and Faragher
v. City of Boca Raton , 524 U.S. 775 (1998). The same standard
applies to national origin harassment by a supervisor. Gotfryd
v. Book Covers, Inc. , No. 97 C 7696, 1999 WL 20925, at *5
(N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 1999) (applying Ellerth and Faragher standards to national origin discrimination).

 39. The question of an employer&apos;s liability
for harassment by non-employees may be affected by the extent of
the employer&apos;s control over and any other legal responsibility that
the employer may have had with respect to the conduct of
non-employees. 29 C.F.R.§1606.8(e).

 40. Typically, employer policies related to
national origin harassment can be part of broader policies
addressing all prohibited forms of harassment, including harassment
based on race, sex, religion, age, or disability. For more
information on preventive measures related to harassment generally,
refer to EEOC&apos;s Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer
Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors (1999), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/harassment.html.

 41. This subsection replaces Section 623: Speak-English-Only Rules and Other Language Policies , EEOC
Compliance Manual, Volume II.

 42. These figures are for individuals five
years of age or older. In 1990, approximately 31.8 million
Americans (13.8 percent of the population) spoke a language other
than English in the home. Of those individuals, 6.7 million
individuals (2.9 percent of the total population) spoke little or
no English. These figures are from the following U.S. Census Bureau
publications: 1990 Census of Population: Social and Economic
Characteristics, Table 27, &quot;Nativity, Citizenship, Year of Entry,
and Language Spoken at Home,&quot;
http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp2/cp-2-1.pdf,
and Table P035, &quot;Age by Language Spoken at Home
by Ability to Speak English for the
Population 5 Years and Over:  Census 2000,&quot; http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?ds_name=D&amp;geo_id=D&amp;mt_name=ACS_C2SS_EST_G2000_P035&amp;_lang=en.

 43. 29 C.F.R.§1606.1. The court in Fragante v. City&amp;County of Honolulu, 888 F.2d 591,
596 (9th Cir. 1989), cert . denied , 494 U.S. 1081
(1990), stated that accent and national origin are &quot;obviously
inextricably intertwined,&quot; therefore requiring a &quot;very searching
look&quot; at employment decisions based on accent.

 44. For example, in Carino v. University
of Oklahoma Board of Regents , 750 F.2d 815 (10th Cir. 1984),
the court found that an individual with a noticeable Filipino
accent was unlawfully demoted from his position as a supervisor and
not considered for a supervisory position in a new facility. The
court found that Carino&apos;s accent would not interfere with the
duties required of a supervisor. Id. at 819. By contrast,
in Fragante v. City&amp;County of Honolulu, 888 F.2d
591, 597-98 (9th Cir. 1989), cert . denied , 494
U.S. 1081 (1990), the court found that the employer lawfully
refused to hire an individual with a pronounced Filipino accent for
a position requiring constant phone communication with the public.
The record revealed that Fragante&apos;s pronounced Filipino accent
would make him difficult to understand over the telephone.

 45. In Shieh v. Lyng , 710 F. Supp.
1024 (E.D. Pa. 1989), aff&apos;d , 897 F.2d 523 (3d Cir. 1990)
(table), the court found that the plaintiff was lawfully demoted
because his language abilities were too limited to enable him to
produce the complex scientific manuscripts required by his
position.

 46. For example, in Cota v. Tucson
Police Department , 783 F. Supp. 458, 473-74 (D. Ariz.
1992), the court found that Title VII was not violated because,
although Hispanic employees performed more Spanish-related tasks
than non-Hispanic employees, there was no evidence that Hispanic
workers performed extra or more difficult, rather than merely
different, work.

 47. The facts in this example are similar to
those presented in EEOC v. Premier Operator Services,
Inc. , 113 F. Supp. 2d 1066 (N.D. Tex. 2000). In that case, the
court noted that Hispanic employees were &quot;forced to be constantly
on guard to avoid uttering their native language, even in their
most private moments in the lunch room or on a break.&quot; One employee
was reprimanded for speaking Spanish to her husband while at lunch
in the break room. Id. at 1075.

 48. The EEOC guidelines on English-only
rules, 29 C.F.R.§1606.7, state that English-only rules must
be justified by &quot;business necessity.&quot; Courts are divided on the
application of Title VII to English-only rules and the validity of
the EEOC guidelines. Compare EEOC v. Premier Operator
Servs., Inc. , 113 F. Supp. 2d 1066, 1073 (N.D. Tex. 2000)
(English-only rules &quot;disproportionately burden national origin
minorities because they preclude many members of these groups from
speaking the language in which they are best able to
communicate.&quot;), and EEOC v. Synchro-Start Prods.
Inc , 29 F. Supp. 2d 911, 914-15 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (English-only
rules may create discriminatory work environment based on national
origin), with Garcia v. Spun Steak Co. , 998 F.2d
1480, 1487-89 (9th Cir. 1993) (finding that the EEOC&apos;s guidelines
on English-only rules could not be applied to truly bilingual
employees because such individuals do not suffer any adverse impact
from these rules and holding that the guidelines impermissibly
presume that English-only policies have a disparate impact without
requiring proof of such), cert. denied , 512 U.S. 1228
(1994), and Long v. First Union Corp , 894 F.
Supp. 933, 940 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff&apos;d per curiam , 86 F.3d
1151 (4th Cir. 1996) (table) (district court rejected the EEOC
guidelines, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed without addressing the
guidelines). Two other U.S. Courts of Appeals have upheld
English-only policies without addressing the EEOC guidelines. See Garcia v. Gloor , 618 F.2d 264, 268 (5th Cir.
1980), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 1113 (1981); Gonzalez v.
Salvation Army , No. 89-1679-CIV-T-17, U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21692
(M.D. Fla. May 28, 1991), aff&apos;d , 985 F.2d 578 (11th Cir.
1992) (table), cert. denied , 508 U.S. 910 (1993).

 49. The facts in this example are similar to
those in EEOC Dec. No. 83-7,¶6836 (CCH) (1983).

 50. To minimize the adverse effects that
English-only rules may have for non-native English-speaking
workers, employers also may want to consider providing an incentive
for those workers to improve their English skills, such as English
classes. Such specialized training will help workers with limited
English skills acquire skills necessary for advancement.

A recent survey by the Society for Human Resource Management
shows that a substantial number of large employers have begun to
provide bilingual training for managers and employees and others
have offered company-paid training in English as a second language.
Society for Human Resource Management, Impact of Diversity
Initiatives on the Bottom Line 4 (2001). In SHRM&apos;s survey, 22
percent of responding companies stated that they provide bilingual
training for managers and employees, and 19 percent offer
company-paid training in English as a second language.

 51. Courts have indicated that if the
problem were more widespread, then the employer would be justified
in adopting an English-only policy. See , e.g. , Roman v. Cornell Univ. , 53 F. Supp. 2d 223, 237 (N.D.N.Y.
1999) (business reasons for an English-only rule may include
&quot;avoiding or lessening interpersonal conflicts, preventing
non-foreign language speaking individuals from feeling left out of
conversations, and preventing non-foreign language speaking
individuals from feeling that they are being talked about in a
language they do not understand&quot;); Long v. First Union
Corp. , 894 F. Supp. 933, 941 (E.D. Va. 1995) (English-only
policy may be legitimate and necessary for business where adopted
to &quot;prevent employees from intentionally using their fluency in
Spanish to isolate and to intimidate members of other ethnic
groups&quot;), aff&apos;d per curiam , 86 F.3d 1151 (4th Cir. 1996)
(table).

 52. This subsection replaces Section 622: Citizenship, Residency Requirements, Aliens and Undocumented
Workers , EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II.

 53. Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co. , 414
U.S. 86, 92 (1973); 29 C.F.R.§1606.5(a).

 57. See generally http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc (OSC home page). For detailed
information on referral procedures for charges that may be within
the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel, EEOC
investigators should consult the Memorandum of Understanding
Between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office
of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment
Practices (1997), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/oscmou.html.

 59. See generally id. 

 60. Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co. , 414
U.S. 86 (1973).

 61. However, relief may be limited if an
individual subjected to discrimination does not have appropriate
work authorization. Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. Nat&apos;l
Labor Relations Bd. , 122 S. Ct. 1275, 1283-84 (2002).

 62. The Commission took this position in an amicus curiae brief in Reyes-Gaona v. North Carolina
Growers Ass&apos;n , 250 F.3d 861 (4th Cir.), cert. denied ,
122 S. Ct. 463 (2001). A copy of the Commission&apos;s amicus
curiae brief is available at
http://www.eeoc.gov/briefs/reyes.txt. The Fourth Circuit rejected
the Commission&apos;s position, id . at 866-67, finding that the
ADEA does not protect foreign nationals who apply for U.S.-based
employment from outside the United States. But cf. Denty v.
SmithKline Beecham Corp. , 109 F.3d 147, 150 (3d Cir.) (place
where job is performed constitutes location of work site for ADEA
coverage purposes), cert. denied , 522 U.S. 820 (1997); Hu v. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher&amp;Flom LLP , 76 F.
Supp. 2d 476, 477-78 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (non-U.S. citizen not
protected by ADEA with respect to employment in Beijing and Hong
Kong, even though employment interviews and hiring decisions were
made in New York); Gantchar v. United Airlines, Inc. , No.
93 C 1457, 1995 WL 137053, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 1995) (Title
VII jurisdiction dependent on location of potential
employment).

 63. For a detailed discussion of the
coverage requirements for employers, refer to Section 2: Threshold Issues , EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II (BNA)§2-III B.1.a (2000), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/threshold.html . 

 64. See , e.g. , Wallace
v. SMC Pneumatics, Inc. , 103 F.3d 1394, 1401 (7th Cir. 1997)
(Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between United
States and Japan entitles companies of either nation to
discriminate in favor of their own citizens even if the other
nation prohibits such discrimination); MacNamara v. Korean Air
Lines , 863 F.2d 1135, 1147 (3d Cir. 1988) (treaty between
United States and Korea permitting each to have businesses in the
other country managed by their own nationals did not conflict with
Title VII&apos;s prohibition against intentional national origin
discrimination), cert. denied , 493 U.S. 944 (1989).

 65. Individuals who are not U.S. citizens
are not protected against discrimination overseas. In addition, the
Equal Pay Act does not apply overseas at all.

 66. 42 U.S.C.§2000e-1(c)(3) (Title
VII); 29 U.S.C.§623(h)(3) (ADEA); 42 U.S.C.§ 12112(c)(2)(C) (ADA). This is the same test used by
courts in determining whether two or more employers constitute an
integrated enterprise.

 67. Title VII covers employers with at least
15 employees. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986
prohibits national origin discrimination in hiring and discharge by
employers with between four and fourteen employees. IRCA&apos;s
nondiscrimination requirements are enforced by the Office of
Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment
Practices, Civil Rights Division, at the Department of Justice. See generally http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc (OSC home
page).
