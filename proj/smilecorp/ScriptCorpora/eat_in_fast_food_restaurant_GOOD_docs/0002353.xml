 Where Japan&apos;s Tea Grows - The Uji Region
 
 
 Uji is Japan&apos;s oldest tea growing region, where the world famous tea gardens are located just     
south of the historical city of Kyoto, on the main island of Honshu. Tea first arrived in Japan         
from China in the 800&apos;s, brought from the Jin Chan area of China by monks, to Japan&apos;s imperial    
city of Kyoto.
 
 
 
 
 The importance of the tea plants wasn&apos;t immed-
iately recognized upon their arrival, and the gar-
dens weren&apos;t planted for several hundred years,
until the 1100&apos;s.

Kyoto remained the imperial city from 794 to 1868,
and it was during this time that Shogun Ashikaga
Yoshimasa (r. 1449-1474) ordered the expansion
of the tea gardens that had been planted 300
years earlier.

Many of the ancient tea gardens are still producing
tea today, providing most of Japan&apos;s finest quality
gyokuro, sencha, and matcha (made from tencha
leaves).

While China makes tea from over 600 different cul-
tivars, Japan produces tea from just one variety,

 the yabukita clone, which was introduced in 1954, and accounts for over 90% of the tea grown
there today.

The yabukita varietal produces a larger concentration of amino
acids, giving Japan&apos;s teas their characteristic thick vegetal brothi-
ness, or fullness of flavor, something the Japanese call umami.

In the mid 17th century Soen Nagatani, a Uji tea producer invented
the Sencha rolling method, a new technique for loose green tea
 production . This new technique produced a more mellow, brothy
tea that quickly caught the fancy of Japanese tea drinkers and became their new everyday tea. 
Today the Sencha rolling method is used throughout Japan.

Not only did the Uji tea producers invent the sencha method, but in the 1860&apos;s at the end of the
Edo period, they created two new variations in growing Japanese teas; the sencha sun grown
method, and the gyokuro shade grown method. 

No one knows for sure exactly who came up with the idea to shade tea plants, as it&apos;s been lost
in history over time.

What is known, is that shade grown teas have higher levels of both chlorophyll and amino acids
in the leaves, while polyphenol levels are lowered. This gives the teas a darker, more vivid
emerald green color, with less astringency and a more mellow flavor than entirely sun grown
teas.

To shade them, the tea plants are covered with a black plastic mesh for anywhere from a few
days to a few weeks before harvesting.

 Sencha and bancha are sun grown teas . These teas have slightly lower levels of amino acids
and chlorophyll, and have a higher level of certain polyphenols. They are also lighter in color,
more vegetal, and slightly more astringent.

Just south of Uji&apos;s world famous tea gardens that produce all of Japan&apos;s most exquisite and
expensive teas is Kyoto, Japan&apos;s seventh largest city and important cultural center. 

Uji has suddenly become the suburb of a major and affluent city. And, as is the story so often,
its few remaining tea farms have become endangered by urban sprawl, as many of the farmers
have already sold their tea gardens to make room for fast food restaurant franchises, shopping
malls, apartment complexes, and office buildings.

Most gyokuro is grown in Uji and what&apos;s left of the remaining gyokuro
fields is sandwiched between buildings and on hills surrounding the city
of Kyoto.

 Matcha , made from tencha leaves, is Japan&apos;s oldest type of tea, and is
also grown in Uji. The best quality tencha comes from the Uji fields in
Kyoto prefecture where it originated, and also from the Nara and Mie
prefectures to the southeast, where gyokuro and sencha is also grown.
 Enjoy.
