 15. Managing Money 
 
 
 
 Life is a challenge. While it can be a struggle to pay bills, make the rent payment, and provide food and clothes for the family, we keep on doing our best. Ultimately, the life we want – a better place to live, enough money to pay our bills, and fewer concerns about finances – is possible if we keep focused on our goals. 
 Through the years, many of us have developed negative and confusing ideas about money. We may have thought that it was the answer to all our problems. Or, we may have blamed money for ruined relationships and other negative things in our lives. However, money is neither good nor bad. It’s merely a tool for helping us live the life we want and deserve. 
 Since money is a tool, it may help to think of it as a hammer. If a hammer is used correctly, it can help build a fine home or solid furniture. If it’s used incorrectly, it can leave you with a sore thumb. Your money also can be used as a tool to help build something wonderful – a stable, well-balanced life, with your dreams coming true. To help you reach your goals more quickly, you may need to think about money differently and treat it in a new way. 
 (Reference: http://www.managingmymoney.com/newagreements.html ) 
 
Budgeting Can Improve Your Life 
 Controlling your finances requires a budget. For many people, the word “budget” has a negative meaning. Instead of thinking of a budget as “financial handcuffs,” think of it as a means to achieve financial success. A budget is the first and most important step you can take towards putting your money to work for you instead of being controlled by it and forever falling short of your financial goals. If you think you know where your money goes without keeping detailed records, try this: keep track of every cent you spend for one month. You’ll be surprised and perhaps shocked by how much some of your “small” expenses add up to. 
 
Reasons for budgeting include: 
 A budget is a guide that tells you whether you&apos;re going in the direction you want to be headed in financially. You may have goals and dreams, but if you don&apos;t set up guidelines for reaching them and you don&apos;t measure your progress, you may end up going so far in the wrong direction you can never make it back. 
 
A budget lets you control your money instead of your money controlling you. 
 
A budget will tell you if you&apos;re living within your means. Before the widespread use of credit cards, you could tell if you were living within your means because you had money left over after paying all your bills. The use of credit cards has made this much less obvious. Many people don&apos;t realize they&apos;re living far beyond their means until they&apos;re badly in debt. 
 

A budget can help you meet your savings goals. 
 Following a realistic budget frees up spare cash so you can use your money on the things that really matter to you instead of spending it on things you don&apos;t even remember buying. 
 
A budget helps you prepare for emergencies or large, unanticipated emergencies. 
 
A budget reveals areas where you&apos;re spending too much money so you can refocus on your most important goals. 
 
A budget can keep you out of debt or help you get out of debt. 
 
A budget actually creates extra money for you to use on things that matter to you. 
 
A budget helps you sleep better at night because you don&apos;t lie awake worrying about how you&apos;re going to make ends meet.

Steps in Setting Up a Budget 
 To set up a budget for yourself, follow these steps: 
 
Step One: Set Up Categories 
 The first step is setting up income and expense categories to track. A common mistake is to try to fit your spending into somebody else’s categories. While basic categories such as housing, utilities, insurance, and food apply to all of us, we each have expenses that are unique to our personal situations. A successful budget will include categories that reflect the way YOU actually spend money.

For example, if you regularly eat out everyday, you’ll want a subcategory under “Food” for “Eating Out.” Think about your habits (smoking, drinking, buying a cup of coffee every day) to identify other spending categories. The idea is to become more aware of where your money goes so you can make conscious decisions about spending. 
 
Step Two: Calculate Budget Amounts 
 To get started, collect as many of your pay stubs, bills, and receipts as possible. Calculate your average monthly gross pay (before taxes) by adding the gross pay on four pay stubs if you’re paid weekly, or two pay stubs if you’re paid twice a month. If your pay varies from pay period to pay period, try to come up with as accurate a monthly average as possible. 
 
Next, start going through your bills for at least the last three months and listing monthly expenses on a budget worksheet. Make your categories detailed enough to provide you with useful information about your spending habits, but not so detailed that you become bogged down in details. Remember, this has to be something you’ll stick with for the long term, so you don’t want it to be too much of a chore. 
 
To come up with your monthly budgeted amounts for each category, it’s important to walk a fine line between reflecting your actual expenses and setting targeted spending levels that will allow you to save money. Even fixed costs such as housing or utilities can often be reduced. Start out by reviewing your bills from the last several months, and entering monthly budgeted amounts for each category. Later, when you have a better grasp on your spending, you’ll look for ways to reduce many of these expenses. 
 
Step Three: Record Your Expenses 
 When you&apos;ve identified and listed monthly estimates for your budgeted amounts, use your checkbook to record your expenses for the month in the appropriate categories. Don&apos;t forget to record your cash expenditures. Jot them down them in a little notebook as you spend the cash, or scribble them on a piece of paper and stick it in a file to be categorized and totaled at the end of the month. You may be shocked at where your cash goes, especially if you make frequent ATM withdrawals from your bank account. 
 
Subtotal the income and expense categories and then subtract the total expenses from the total income to arrive at your net income. If you&apos;ve recorded all of your income and expenditures for the month, this will be the amount of money you have left over for savings, emergency funds, etc. If the number is negative, your expenses are greater than your income. Don&apos;t be discouraged. Chances are, your situation can be greatly improved by changing your spending habits. If you&apos;re fortunate enough to have a positive net income, be sure to transfer most of it to a savings account at the end of each month. Extra cash left in a regular checking account has a way of getting spent. 
 
Step Four: Set Goals and Make Adjustments 
 After you&apos;ve tracked your actual spending for a month or two, you&apos;ll be better able to identify where you can comfortably make cuts and adjustments to start saving money. Consider this a process of self-discovery. Many people don&apos;t have a clear idea of where their money goes until they start tracking their spending, and then they are usually very surprised at how much they spend in certain categories over a month&apos;s or several months&apos; time. You can&apos;t control your money until you know how much you have and where it goes. 
 
Once you&apos;ve got the budgeting process in place, take an in-depth look at your largest spending categories; brainstorm about ways to reduce spending in specific categories and set realistic goals. Don&apos;t overlook the smaller spending categories. Small amounts can add up quickly. 
 
If you stick with the budgeting process past the first month or two, you&apos;ll begin to see a pattern in your spending, and you&apos;ll be able to identify areas where you can painlessly save money that you can use to build an emergency fund or save for an important purchase or goal. Cutting costs becomes a challenge that can be very rewarding, especially as you see your savings grow. Following a budget can set you free from the burden of debt and the constant worry that you won&apos;t be able to obtain your financial goals. 
 Living Within Your Means 
 You’ve probably heard the phrase, “living within your means.” But what does it really mean? Simply put, if you’re living within your means, you can pay for the things you need without getting trapped in more debt than you can handle. However, many of us believe that the only way to have nice things is to go into debt to get them. While that may be true for some large purchases such as a house or car, it doesn’t have to apply to the other things we need in life. 
 
We all need things to survive. We need clothes, food, a place to live, and often some sort of transportation. Things we want, on the other hand, aren’t essential to survival. Designer-label clothing, dinners out, and brand-new cars all represent wants. Sometimes, we get our “needs” mixed up with “wants.” 
 
For example, we need clothes that are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Our clothes need to be of good quality so they’ll last a while, and they need to fit us. However, we may want the newest trendy jeans, expensive running shoes, or an outfit that needs to be dry cleaned after each wearing. Since many of us have never learned to distinguish our wants from our needs, we spend a lot of money on “wants” – things that we don’t really need.
Here’s a quick way to determine whether something is a want or a need: 
 
 It’s probably a want if: 
It’s possible to delay the purchase, substitute a less-expensive item, or use something you already have or own. 
 
 It’s likely a need if: 
 You’re purchasing something you must have to survive. 
 Knowing the difference between wants and needs puts you in control of your purchases.

 It also helps you: 
Set spending priorities 
 Make wise choices about spending 
 Get the most value for your money 
 Be a thoughtful consumer 
 Save money 
 Living within your means is definitely possible. Often, it’s just a matter of making different choices. Most of us spend a significant amount of money on everyday items. Here are some suggested ways to save money on food, clothing, and transportation costs. Soon, you’ll discover your own solutions, and living within your means will become a habit. 
 
Food 
 Avoid eating out . Even at a fast-food restaurant, you’ll pay three to seven times more for a meal than you would if you cooked at home. 
 Shop at large grocery stores or food warehouses. Avoid high-priced convenience stores and smaller &quot;boutique&quot; grocery stores. 
 
 Buy store brands. They are usually less expensive than nationally advertised brands, but the quality is often just as good. 
 Make a shopping list—and stick to it. Avoid buying food on an impulse and don&apos;t shop on an empty stomach or you may come home with more than you planned to buy. 
 Pack a lunch for work or school instead of going out. 
 
 Use coupons or &quot;membership&quot; cards at grocery stores—but only buy the item if it&apos;s something you use anyway. 
 Compare the unit prices of products. Buy whichever product is less expensive per ounce, per pound, per pint, and so on. 
 
 Take advantage of two-for-one sales if the items are things you use anyway. 
 As much as possible, avoid purchasing junk food such as potato chips, pretzels, soda, and candy. Junk food is usually quite expensive, especially when you consider that it offers little nutritional value. 
 Stock up on sales of items you use regularly such as paper products and canned food. 
 
Clothing 
 Garage sales and flea markets can be fantastic sources of quality clothes at great prices. 
 Set up a clothing exchange with friends or neighbors to trade your adult and children’s clothes. What&apos;s old to you will be new and exciting to someone else. 
 Regularly visit thrift stores. The inventory usually changes frequently. 
 
 Check out clothing sales sponsored by local churches or service groups . 
 Some stores accept used clothing, price it, sell it, and give you some money back on the items you bring in. These are called &quot;consignment stores.&quot; Look into consignment stores for clothing for both kids and adults. You can earn a little money on clothes you consign and either apply the credit toward another purchase in the store or take the cash someplace else. 
 Stick with classics whenever possible. They stay in style longer than the latest trends. 
 
Transportation 
 If your community offers a carpool matching service, try to find someone to share rides to work. 
 
If you live close to school or work, try walking or biking. You&apos;ll get exercise and save money on transportation. 
 Take advantage of public transportation if it&apos;s available and delivers you to your destination in a reasonable amount of time. 
 Perform regular maintenance on your car —such as changing the oil and coolant— as well as keeping the tires properly inflated. Your car will run more efficiently and you’ll save money every month. 
 Refill your tank at gas stations that regularly have the lowest prices on gasoline and try to avoid more expensive stations. 
 If you&apos;re buying a car, consider a good used model instead of a new one. 
 Purchase the vehicle with the best gas mileage rating that will serve your needs. 
 Every two years, shop around to be sure you have the best deal on car insurance.

How to Live Within Your Budget 
 Living within your budget can be challenging. A few simple practices can help ensure that you are successful: 
 
List all of your expenses, savings, and income from the past year. Use your checkbook register, credit card receipts, and bills to do this. A computer-based financial program such as Quicken may help. 
 
Determine, as accurately as possible, what expenses you expect to have for the next year.

You can project expenses for a shorter period, such as the next three months, then multiply by four for yearly expenses. 
 Record this information into a ledger or computer-based program to accurately track your income and expenses. 
 
Determine what you can reasonably afford to spend each month and then track how well you are doing by keeping track of actual expenses. 
 If you find that you are spending less than you had anticipated, you may want to put more money in your savings account to help out with unexpected expenses. 
 
If you find that you are spending more than anticipated, try identifying the items you really don&apos;t need (new clothes, CDs, expensive dinners) and avoid purchasing them until you are back within your budget.

 Banking - Savings and Checking Accounts
 The first step in using a bank is opening up an account. In general, you need to bring a few things. First, you need to bring money or a check made out to you that you can deposit. Second, you will need your Social Security number or card. The last item you need is a formal picture identification. Be prepared to fill out forms. They will want to know your address, phone number, and possibly some current employment information. They may ask for your mother&apos;s maiden name for security purposes. Your signature will also be required. 
 Once an account is set up, then it is your responsibility to keep up with how much money is in your account. The balance of a savings account increases with deposits and interest earned and decreases when a withdrawal is made. The balance of a checking account increases with deposits and decreases as checks are written. When making deposits, a bank usually has a form or a slip that the customer fills out to indicate how much money is being deposited. Some banks have the person present a bank card that has the person&apos;s account number on it as well. 
 (Reference: http://www.workshopsinc.com/manual/ch4l3.html) 
 The two most common services used by bank customers are: 
 Savings accounts – A good way to stay out of financial problems is to save money for things you want to buy and have extra money on hand for emergencies. One way to keep that money safe and even get more money is to put the money away in a savings account at a bank. Putting the money into the bank is safe because your money is insured. 
 The bank pays people to keep their money in savings accounts. The amount the person gets paid depends on the interest rate and how much money they have in their account. The amount of the money in the savings account increases as it accumulates interest and as the person deposits more money into the account. When you need money you can go to the bank and withdraw as much of the money as you want (unless the bank has a minimum balance requirement). Money can also be transferred into your checking account. 
 Checking accounts – Checking accounts are different from savings accounts in two basic ways. First, checking accounts generally do not earn interest. Second, when a person wants to buy something, he or she writes a check instead of withdrawing money and paying with cash. The advantage of having a checking account is that a person does not have to carry a lot of cash to make purchases or pay bills. If you lose your checkbook, you call the bank to let them know and your money is safe. 
 Because money is taken directly from your checking account when you write a check, it is important to be able to keep track of your balance. Your balance is how much money you have left in your account. If your balance is $50 and you write a check for $75, you have just &quot;bounced&quot; a check. In addition to depositing enough money into the account to cover the check, you will have to pay a fee of $15-$25 for trying to spend more than you have. Writing a check without enough money in your account is illegal. Banks charge the fee for the inconvenience, but if you do not make efforts to deposit enough money to cover your checks and stop bouncing checks, businesses can report you to law enforcement. 
 Most people keep a savings and checking account at the same bank. If your checking account is low and you need groceries or some other necessity, you can transfer money from your savings account into your checking account until you get paid and can deposit money into your checking account. 
 (Reference: http://www.workshopsinc.com/manual/ch4l3.html) 
 Be honest. Do you faithfully balance your checkbook to the penny each month? Balancing your checkbook is one of the most basic habits for good money management, yet millions of Americans don&apos;t do it on a regular basis. Is balancing your checkbook an old-fashioned task that is no longer necessary? Here are four reasons you should balance your checkbook monthly: 
 Balancing your checkbook is a method of verifying that your records (your checkbook register) match the bank&apos;s records, as shown on your monthly bank statement. This will always be an important task, although the method of accomplishing it is changing in the electronic age. 
 Although your bank processes thousands of transactions accurately, it can make mistakes, and you typically have only 60 days in which to inform the bank of the error. If you don&apos;t balance your checkbook monthly, you might not even find the error in 60 days. Even more likely is the possibility that you made a math error in your checkbook register, which you&apos;re unlikely to find unless you balance your checkbook each month. 
 If you make a mistake or forget to post an ATM withdrawal, debit card purchase, or other transaction in your checkbook register, you may start bouncing checks. 
 If there is a problem at some point, it&apos;s much more difficult to wade through months of transactions to figure it out. If you&apos;ve balanced your checkbook every month, the most you&apos;ll ever have to do is look at the most recent month&apos;s transactions. Sometimes people make such a mess of their checkbook by not balancing regularly that they have to close out their account and open another one. 
 (Reference: http://financialplan.about.com/cs/personalfinance/a/CheckbookBalanc.htm) 
 Tips for managing your checking account include: 
 Shop around for a good deal, preferably an account without a monthly maintenance fee. Banks usually offer a choice of several accounts with different features, fees, interest rates, and opening balance requirements. 
 Keep your checkbook up to date by recording all transactions, including ATM withdrawals, bank fees, debit card purchases, and any other deductions that do not involve writing a check. Also, promptly compare your checkbook with your monthly statement, or review your account information online or by telephone. 
 Avoid “overdrawing your account,” which can happen if you write a check or otherwise attempt to withdraw (by mistake) more money than you have in your account. It also is possible to overdraw your account using your debit card at the ATM or when making a purchase. These transactions can be costly. 
 Consider Internet (online) banking. This service allows you to make payments or move money from one account to another through your bank’s website instead of (or in addition to) writing and mailing paper checks. This saves on the costs of postage and buying paper checks. Online banking also allows you to monitor your account without having to wait for a statement in the mail. 
 Pay attention to your bank statements. To protect yourself from accusations that you were negligent in managing your account, immediately report any errors or unauthorized transactions. Look at your statement as soon as it arrives in the mail, or monitor your account more regularly on the Internet or through your bank’s telephone banking service. 
 A word about ATM&apos;s and credit cards 
 For many bank accounts, banks can issue you debit cards. Debit cards can be in the form of basic Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards that let you obtain 24 hour access to money in your bank account through ATM cash machines, or in a form that lets you use ATM machines plus make purchases. When you use a debit card, funds come directly out of your bank account (just like writing a check). Because ATM withdrawals and purchases are listed on your monthly statement you can track your spending. 
 Certain debit cards may have the logo of a familiar credit card company on them. Do not be confused. These cards are designed to provide you the convenience of making purchases wherever such credit cards are accepted (millions of businesses worldwide), but the purchase amounts are subtracted directly from your bank account and listed on your monthly statement. Debit cards do not extend you credit or generate separate bills. They also do not help you build a credit record, which may be important if you intend to purchase a car or home. 
 Your bank will provide you with a personal identification number (PIN) to use with your card, which is essentially a password for electronic access to your account. With your debit card and PIN, you can withdraw cash, make deposits, or transfer funds between bank accounts, and pay for retail purchases with certain cards. Keep your PIN a secret. Do not write your PIN on the card or on a slip of paper kept with your card. Take your ATM receipt after completing a transaction. Check all ATM receipts against bank statements as soon as possible. 
 When you withdraw cash, some ATMs charge a fee if you are not a member of their network or are making a transaction at a remote location. ATMs must disclose the fee on the terminal screen or on a sign next to the screen. 
 Report a lost or stolen ATM or debit card to the bank immediately. If you report an ATM card missing before it is used without your permission, you are not responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals. Federal regulations limit your liability to $50 if you report the loss within two business days after you realize your card is missing, and to $500 if you report the loss between 2 and 60 days. 
 Purchases made with a debit card are handled in one of two ways: either you enter your personal identification number, as you would at an ATM, or you sign for the purchase, similar to a credit card transaction. Ask for a debit card that must be used with a PIN to make it harder for thieves to use your lost or stolen cards or account numbers. 
 When you use a debit card for purchases, these purchases will be shown on your statement from your bank account. If there is an error on your account, contact your bank. 
 (Reference: http://www.militarymoney.com/money/1140121676) 
 If you decide to switch banks 
 Perhaps you are moving, getting married, or just unhappy with your current bank. Your switch to a new bank can be smoother if you do the following: 
 Balance your checkbook and make sure all outstanding checks have cleared before you close your checking account. This will ensure that you and the bank agree on how much money is due to you. Also, you will not get hit with fees for checks that bounce after you close the account. 
 Open an account at your new bank before you leave your old bank. That way you can write checks and make ATM debit card withdrawals without interruption. 
 If you have arranged for direct deposit of your pay, do not close the old bank account until you are sure the next scheduled payment will be going into the new bank account. 
 If you are changing addresses, make sure your old bank has your new address and phone number. Do this in writing. Do not trust a phone call. Your bank may need to contact you weeks or months after you close your bank account. 
 Do you have anything in the bank&apos;s safe deposit box? Remember to clean it out and return the keys.

 Where Does Your Money Go? 
 Have you ever had $20 at the beginning of the week and by Wednesday it was gone? Even worse, you can&apos;t remember how you spent it? That&apos;s a spending leak. Like a dripping faucet wastes water, spending leaks can waste hard-earned money. To plug spending leaks, you first have to know where the money is going. One way to track leaks is by keeping a spending diary. A small spiral notebook makes it easy. Keep this notebook in your purse or pocket and write down everything you buy over the course of a day and how much it costs. Include everything, even small purchases such as a cup of coffee or a magazine.

Track your spending for a few weeks. Even better, track it for three months. Then, take a look at where you’re spending money—you’ll probably find your spending leaks. Once you’ve determined where your money&apos;s going, you can start plugging those leaks. By reducing—or better yet, eliminating— your spending leaks, you&apos;ll find you have more money to apply to bills, add to your savings, and, ultimately, reach your goals.

Here are some common spending leaks: 
 cigarettes 
 soft drinks 
 fast-food meals 
 snack foods 
 coffee 
 magazines and books 
 movies 
 video or DVD rentals 
 CDs and tapes 
 lottery tickets 
 gifts 
 cable TV 
 phone options, such as call waiting 
 Internet service

 After you&apos;ve tracked your spending habits, identified spending leaks, and plugged the leaks, it&apos;s time to develop a spending plan. A spending plan is different from a budget, which focuses only on regular monthly bills. A spending plan is a tool that you can use for a lifetime.

With a spending plan, you look at the money coming in and the money going out and then find ways to balance the two. There are four steps to creating a spending plan:

1. Identifying your income
2. Identifying your expenses
3. Comparing the income with the expenses
4. Setting priorities

For a spending plan to work, it needs to be accurate. Don&apos;t overestimate your income, and don&apos;t forget about bills due every few months. For those bills, set aside an average amount of money each month so the bill may be paid when it arrives.

The following steps will help you create a spending plan. 
 Identifying your income.

Determine how much money you receive each month. Pay stubs, deposit records, and other records of income will help complete this step. 
 Identifying your expenses.

Determine how much money you spend. List your expenses and don’t forget to include the items from your spending diary. If you have a checking account, refer to canceled checks or your account register. If you use a credit card, review six months’ worth of your statements and average the total amount spent over that period. Include receipts or invoices for items you pay every three, six, or 12 months, such as car insurance. For weekly expenses, such as gas, multiply the amount by four for a monthly total. 
 Comparing the income with the expenses.

Add up your income and expense lists. Compare the two. Do you have enough money to pay all your expenses? If you don&apos;t, it is time to set some priorities. If you have money left over at the end of the month after paying your expenses, that’s even better. Now you can start paying yourself first by putting that money into a savings account. 
 Setting priorities.

If you’re outspending your income, or if you&apos;re just breaking even, you probably need to make some changes. Simply put, you need to either spend less by cutting your expenses or boost your income. To spend less, take a hard look at your expenses. Are there a couple of activities or expenses that you could do away with? To increase your income, you could ask your employer if you can get paid for working overtime. Or, you may want to look for a second job.

 Using Credit Wisely : Establishing A Good Credit History
 What exactly is credit? Credit means that you are using someone else&apos;s money (usually a credit card company or a bank) to pay for things. It also means that you are making a promise to repay the money (the loan) to the person or company that loaned you the money. A loan of any type includes both the principal—the amount of money borrowed—and the interest charged for the right to borrow the money.

Credit can be a useful tool. It enables many people to purchase large items, such as a house or car that few can afford to buy with cash. The problem with credit is that many people see it as free money. If you make credit card payments on time and repay your debts as promised, you’re building a good credit record. This will be an important factor in making major purchases in the future. When you have a good credit record, lenders feel more confident that you will be willing and able to pay back a new loan. On the other hand, a poor credit record can affect your ability to make large purchases and may even hurt your ability to get a job. 
 Many people look at credit cards as play money since they&apos;re not paying cash for an item but they still get to take it home right away. They see credit as a way to get great stuff without worrying about paying for it. However, a few weeks later, the credit card bill arrives in the mail and the best intentions of paying for the item are gone.

With all the problems that credit cards can cause if they&apos;re not used properly, why use one at all? Here are a few reasons: 
 Credit cards offer convenience and a safer alternative to carrying cash. If your card is lost or stolen, you’re generally responsible for no more than $50 of unauthorized charges if you contact the credit card issuer as soon as you realize the card is missing. 
 Some businesses, such as rental car companies, require a credit card to make a purchase. 
 Smart credit card use helps you establish a good credit history. When you purchase something with credit, and then pay it off promptly, it shows that you can manage credit responsibly. 
 The following tips will help you successfully take advantage of the benefits of credit cards without falling into debt. 
 Use a credit card only for important items. 
 Since a credit card purchase is essentially a loan, ask yourself, &quot;Would I take out a loan to buy this?&quot; before using the card. 
 Instead of using a credit card to make a big purchase today, wait until you’ve saved enough money to make the purchase with cash and avoid owing any money on it. 
 Keep track of credit card charges by writing them in your check register and compare charges to the amount of money left in your checking account. Be careful not to charge more than the current balance of your checking account. That way, you’ll have the money to pay your credit card balance in full when the bill arrives. 
 Choose cards that have no annual fee and shop around for the lowest interest rates. 
 If you think you’re getting in trouble with credit cards, stop using them. 
 One way to control credit card expenses is through a &quot;secured&quot; credit card. These cards work just like credit cards, except they require a deposit as security that you&apos;ll pay off the balance. For example, if you deposit $300, the bank gives you a card with a credit limit of $300 and you can&apos;t charge more than $300. Be warned that there may be other fees involved with these cards. 
 Establishing good credit means building a solid reputation for paying your bills on time. People who establish good credit qualify for loans to buy more expensive items such as cars or houses. Plus, people with the best credit histories are usually eligible for some of the best interest rates available, which can save a borrower a significant amount of money in interest payments.

Your credit history also can affect your ability to be hired for a job. Many employers check prospective employees&apos; credit reports and it&apos;s perfectly legal. If your credit report contains credit or debt problems, a company may choose not to hire you. Landlords also may ask to see your credit record before they agree to rent you an apartment. Working to build—and maintain—a good credit history takes time. But it&apos;s definitely worth the effort.

The best way to build good credit is to pay household bills, such as rent, gas and electricity, water, and telephone bills on time. If you take out any loans or make purchases with credit cards, pay those bills on time every month, too. And try hard to make more than the minimum payment. When you just pay the minimum due, it can take months or years—and lots of interest payments—to pay off the debt.

If you have a checking account, don&apos;t bounce checks. A history of writing bad checks will hurt your credit with the bank and other merchants. Plus, if you bounce too many checks, your bank may even close your account. Also, writing bad checks is against the law!

 Debt 
 Credit card bills. Car payments. Bank loans. Rent or mortgage payments. At times, it may feel like most of our money goes toward paying off debts. But, while it may seem like debt is just part of being an adult, it doesn&apos;t have to be that way. By managing our money, living within our means, and saving for purchases rather than putting them on credit, we not only can pay off some debt, but we won’t be relying so heavily on borrowing.

The type of debt you want to avoid is consumer debt—credit cards, auto loans, and department store cards. Items purchased with this type of debt don&apos;t increase in value, and the interest rates you pay can be quite high. There may be times when consumer debt is unavoidable—for example, few people have enough cash to buy a car without a loan. But falling too deeply into consumer debt is one of the biggest mistakes people can make. Many people carry large balances on several credit and department store cards while they are also paying off large auto loans. These expensive, multiple debts drain their financial resources and jeopardize their financial future. 
 To Help You Get Out of Debt, Follow These Steps: 
 Step One 

Find out where you are in debt. Do you owe many businesses or just one or two? Look closely at your credit card invoices and loan agreements. Are you being penalized for not paying the total amount? Find out what happens if you are late or miss a payment. If you’re not sure, call your lender and ask.

 Step Two 

If you are in debt to just a few businesses, call them and try to negotiate smaller payments—at least for a while. Make this call before you miss a payment. It may be tough to do and embarrassing. Still, it’s better than getting calls from creditors demanding payment.

 Step Three 

If you owe money to many businesses, it may be time for outside help. Consider working with a nonprofit debt counseling service. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling is one service you can contact. Its toll-free number is 1-800-388-2227. The organization can work with you and your creditors to set up a repayment plan.

 Step Four 

Take a hard look at your spending plan. Try to come up with new ways to cut expenses. Can you use the bus instead of driving? Can you take a brown-bag lunch to work? Are there community services you can use for low-cost food or clothing?

 Step Five 

Look for ways to increase your income. Or, you can work extra hours at your job. Have you considered a second, part-time job? If you can increase your income so it’s more than expenses, you CAN get out of debt.

 Step Six 

As hard as it is, don’t ignore bills and past-due notices. A poor credit record follows you for years. It can make it hard for you to buy a house, get a loan, and maybe even get a job.

Getting into debt is easy. Pulling yourself out can be harder; it takes time and commitment. But, taking steps to get out of debt is far less stressful than watching your debts grow. In time, you’ll see that by having less debt you have greater choices. You will have more money to put into savings for the things that are really important.

 Tips to Dig Yourself Out of Credit Card Debt 
 When you have buried yourself under a mountain of credit card debt, it can feel as though you&apos;ll never get out from under it. The thought of owing so much money while being hit every month by high interest rates is overwhelming. But the truth is that people like you do pay off their credit card debt every year, and you can too (with a bit of discipline). Here are some tips to help you get through this tough time and come out the other side debt-free. 
 First things first. Stop spending on those cards. You are only leading yourself further into debt. Sometimes when people rack up the credit card bills, they tend to shop even more to alleviate the stress associated with debt. Unfortunately, this is a vicious cycle. To make a change, you first have to admit you have a problem, and then decide to do something about it. 
 Cut up your credit cards. For some people this is the only way to keep themselves from charging more. So get rid of the plastic altogether to avoid temptation. 
 Do not apply for more credit cards. It may be tempting to get another card with a fresh credit limit, but you will only pile more debt on yourself. Spend only what you have in your checking account for now. 
 Open a savings account. Everyone should be putting some money away for the future. When you can’t use your credit cards for an emergency, you will have a back up savings account for those unexpected car repairs and doctor bills. 
 Make a budget. You need to be realistic about what you bring in each month and what you spend. Chances are, you’ve been in some denial lately about how much money you really have at your disposal. So sit down and take stock. Figure out how much you must have to pay bills, buy groceries and gas, and other necessities. You can save and spend the rest. 
 Set some financial goals. In order to get out of your present difficulties, you need to have some goals in mind. Do you want to have a certain amount paid off by the end of the year? Decide on the things that are most important to you and get them down on paper. 
 Pay bills first. When you get paid, sit down and immediately write out checks for your bills. This will ensure you have enough left over to live on and you won’t feel the need to scramble for money at the end of the month. 
 Call the credit card companies. You may be able to negotiate a lower interest rate and get rid of some of your late fees if you agree to a firm payment schedule. If you can make an agreement with them, you will have to stick with it but it could save you hundreds of dollars in the long run. 
 Look into credit card debt consolidation. If you have debt spread out over several cards, you may be able to move your debts to a single balance transfer credit card with lower interest. But as always, read the fine print. This interest rate could skyrocket if you are late with one payment or at the end of a trial period. 
 Always pay more than the minimum balance on your credit cards. If you only have to pay $25 per month to keep it going, pay $30 or even more. Even this small amount of difference will help you to reduce your principal. Often, the minimum balance due will only cover the interest you have accrued over the last month, so if you were to always only pay the minimum, the debt would never be paid off in full. 
 Get copies of your credit report. There are credit bureaus that hold records of your credit history. These companies will provide you with a free credit report each year. So take advantage of this and see what the credit card companies and other financial institutions are being told about your credit history. 
 Dispute any errors on your credit report. When you receive a copy of your credit report from all of the major reporting agencies, you should receive a form that allows you to dispute an entry. Go through all areas of the report and write to the company if you find a mistake. Not reporting mistakes could cost you. 
 Find out your credit score. When you get the free copy of your credit report, you should also be able to get your credit score for a small fee. This score will often determine your eligibility for loans and future credit cards. Knowing what your credit score is, and understanding how to fix it, will help you face your financial problems more confidently. 
 Cut out unnecessary expenses. Remember that budget you made? Chances are you can cut out $100 or more of expenses each month without even noticing what you&apos;re missing. Putting that extra money toward a better life will feel better than ‘buyer’s remorse’ for the junk you used to buy. 
 Pay with cash—not a debit card. People tend to spend less when they use cash as opposed to plastic (even ‘debit’ plastic). Consider it a tool to discourage any impulse buys you might make. 
 Qualify for future credit cards by making payments regularly. A good payment history is the best credit you can get. If you can pay your car loan, your mortgage, and your other bills on time, this looks good to credit card companies who previously may have been hesitant to offer you a line of credit. 
 Create a holiday fund. Most credit card debt is accumulated during the holidays when people spend beyond their means. So start early in the year creating a fund that cannot be touched until December. Most banks now offer this type of interest bearing account. You will deposit money throughout the year and then have a nice nest egg to spend for holidays without racking up more debt. 
 Don’t shop when you are angry. In fact, don’t shop when you are feeling any strong emotion. You will be tempted to spend money you don’t have to make yourself feel better. 
 Have some savings automatically deducted from your paycheck. Most companies allow this service. You can have anywhere from one to five percent of your paycheck sent directly to a savings account. You probably won&apos;t miss it, and it can add up quickly. 
 Don’t avoid the phone calls. Most people let the answering machine get the calls from collectors. Try to talk to these people and set up some sort of payment plan so they will stop calling. Setting up a deal will help relieve a lot of stress as well. 
 Keep good records. When you get correspondence from credit card companies, keep a record of what you do in response. Write down dates and times of phone calls along with details of payment arrangements. 
 Get organized. Find a central location for all your bills. Keep the most current bills in a place where they are easily accessible. Also create a calendar of your bill due dates to stay on top of deadlines. 
 Reward yourself. When you pay off a credit card or other bill, set up a reward system for yourself. Knowing you have a reward waiting will give you extra incentive to keep paying down the debt. 
 Be polite. Remember that you are the one who got yourself into this mess. The collectors and credit card companies are only doing their jobs. 
 Be patient. Your debt will not go away overnight. You may be paying on this debt for months or even years. But when you finally pay it down, you will have a great feeling of accomplishment, not to mention a cleaner credit history. 
 Be persistent. Don’t give up after a few months of making regular payments. You may feel like you aren’t making much of a dent in the total amount owed, but even $5 or $10 can make a big difference in interest payments down the line. 
 Ask for help. If you have relatives or friends who have gotten out from some deep debt, ask for their advice and experience.
