For a great tasting hamburger, fast service, very nice and helpful staff and low prices, In- N- out rules. My favorite: Double burger, no cheese, grilled onions, ketchup, medium rare. Unbeatable.

Limited menu, but for the money this is one if the best burger fast food places anywhere. The meat is flavorful and juicy. Great fries too

Honestly, the best burgers. Tough to get the secret menu down but worth a try. Burgers are small, better get two double doubles, just in case. Fries and shakes are fantastic!

Always consistent, always good no matter where you area. Ordered from the&quot;secret&quot;menu with chopped chillies and fried chopped onions on double doubles with twice-cooked fries! Very busy location with a long line of cars for take out so we parked and went inside to get our to-go.

The locatiion is not the best place, as its hard to navigate in/ out of the parking area. There&apos;s no inside place to sit, so its pretty much strictly drive thru. There&apos;s 2 sides to drive thru but if you&apos;re solo, stick to the right lane.

While visiting CA, I thought is necessary to try the famous In and Out Burger. These places do an incredible business. I had the double burger and fries, which was good but really isn&apos;t much more than a typical fast food burger. I prefer Five Guys.

sorry, but theres no better burger than an in-n-out burger. the service is better than any other fast food restaurant and the food, nothing beats it. french fries are better than anything, you have to get spread on everything!! and try the animal fries, really great.
