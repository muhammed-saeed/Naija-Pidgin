 September 18, 2011 Burgers, Barbecue and Everything Else ...what really caught our attention there was the Funnel Fries. Imagine funnel cakes, reinvented as french fries. What a wonderful creation. More from Burgers, Barbecue and Everything Else

 March 5, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Brittnykay ( 19 reviews ) Way too greasey. Ew. +1 more review from Brittnykay March 5, 2012 Mobile review Way too greasey. Ew. September 12, 2010 Likes it So-So by alis volat propriis ( 49 reviews ) Just another fast food restaurant really. However you do a huge burger and a huge portion of fries. It&apos;s ok not my favorite, but I would eat here again. July 12, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Poor Service by Alix ( 92 reviews ) When we went, there was no place to sit--none of the tables were cleaned off. We moved another diner&apos;s trash to another table so we could eat, got napkins&amp;wiped down the table ourselves. I ordered a cheeseburger w/grilled onions, and got no grilled onions--which I received after a long wait. There was one or two employee in the kitchen, and one at the counter and there were only 4 other people in the place at the time we came (those 4 were already eating). The counter employee decided to sweep the floor and no one cleared off any tables! Yeah, the floor needed swept, but did she miss EVERY TABLE with trash/containers from the diners who had left?? I doubt I would go back, unless it was through the drive thru. Sorry. February 3, 2012 Mobile review by candace ( 1 review ) We love bionic burger. But when you feel like you have to explain why you want your combo a double large sized its quite embarrassing. Me and my bf split the double burger and large fries cause that&apos;s the perfect amount for us both to share. I felt a little insulted and didn&apos;t care for that at all. May 3, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it I don&apos;t know how people like it. by Jason Roepka ( 19 reviews ) My fiance and I went here once, and had about the worst dining experience ever. We ordered 1 cheeseburger w/ fries, 1 mushroom swiss burger w/fries, and 1 soda. Not difficult order to get mixed up, right? Well apparently no. I got my burger and fries and soda, and there was no cheeseburger and fries. Not a big problem.. just show our receipt and get what we ordered. Well, it wasn&apos;t that simple apparently. The young girl at the register acted like she didn&apos;t believe us, and the manager on duty was reluctant to give us our full order! Finally she caved and got our order in... OK all set? NO. The order sits on the counter for 10 minutes before we finally come up and ask if it&apos;s ready and the girl says&quot;oh yeah, here.&quot; Not only was the service horrible, but the food wasn&apos;t great either. The burger tasted like a school cafeteria burger and the fries were as ordinary as could be. I will never return, and I don&apos;t see why so many people love it. November 7, 2011 Likes it THE BEST! by ronnie ( 1 review ) Best Burgers in Kansas, Hands down! February 12, 2011 Not again by canderson186 ( 1 review ) This review is for the store in Haysville, Ks. It may or may not be representative of the other Bionic Burger stores in Wichita, Ks. I am posting here because I cannot find a web page for the Haysville store. With that said here is the experience that I had last night. I went to Bionic Burger for the fries. The rest of the food is about average for any given fast food joint but the fries are very good. I ordered two dinners, for my wife and me, through the drive thru. One was the #2 Combo and one was for chicken strips and onion rings. The total came to $15.37. When we opened the sack at home we found out that the fries was actually tater tots with a few fries piled on top to give the appearance the sack was full of fries and the onion rings was actually tater tots. This was quite disappointing because as I mentioned I was there for the fries.

It may or may not be representative of the other Bionic Burger stores in Wichita, Ks. I am posting here because I cannot find a web page for the Haysville store. With that said here is the experience that I had last night. I went to Bionic Burger for the fries. The rest of the food is about average for any given fast food joint but the fries are very good. I ordered two dinners, for my wife and me, through the drive thru. One was the #2 Combo and one was for chicken strips and onion rings. The total came to $15.37. When we opened the sack at home we found out that the fries was actually tater tots with a few fries piled on top to give the appearance the sack was full of fries and the onion rings was actually tater tots. This was quite disappointing because as I mentioned I was there for the fries. We choose to go ahead and eat the burger and chicken strips right away before they got cold, which is what would have happened if we had went back out into the cold to return the tater tots. After that I called the manager on duty to complain about the tater tots masquerading as fries. I said that it appeared the sack was packaged in a manner to make it look full of fries when it was not. She said that was not the case, that fries and tater tots are cooked in the same bat and often they get mixed up. She spoke as this was fact even though she had not talked to anybody but me about this. I would at least expect that she would have talked to the employee who packaged it and got more information. Instead she offered to give us credit for the fries and onion rings for our next visit. I told her that was not acceptable and I wanted a refund or credit for two dinners, because not having the fries and onion rings ruined our dinning experience. She asked if the burger was OK. I said yes. She said if the burger was OK she would not give a refund for the entire order because part of it was alright. She completely missed the point that the DINNER was not alright! All through this conversation I get the feeling that I am being spoken to like I am a teenager, (I am 58 years old) and that if I didn&apos;t like what she said that I could just go to hell. I finally tire of the whole ordeal and tell her that she will read my comments on the internet. At that point she hangs up on me. Now to me it would have been a better decision on her part to have given in for the $15 rather than running off a customer for ever. Even if I just ate there once a month for 12 months that&apos;s $180 thrown away for $15. Ten years time $1,180. Needless to say, I will never be back!! 1 out of 2 found this review helpful July 28, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Michelle ( 4 reviews ) Best burgers in town by far!
