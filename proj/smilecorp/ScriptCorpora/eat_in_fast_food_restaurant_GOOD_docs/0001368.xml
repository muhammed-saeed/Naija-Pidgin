 Talk about taking your fried chicken seriously…Daniel Lunie Everette, shot his estranged wife, Alice Jenkins Everette at a Chick-fil-A drive-thru. The scene prolly went down like this: 

 Daniel–I’ll have the fried chicken, extra greasy.
Alice–See, there u go wit that greasy food again, fat ass!
Daniel–Bitch, we not together anymore, I’ll eat whatever I want. Give me 2 of those, SUPER SIZE.
Alice–Mhhmph, thats why we not together anymore, you eaten’all that bullsh*t and cant do me right no more.
Daniel–*Chris Tucker Voice* Awwww hell no…don’t you ever fuKK wit a black man’s chicken order… 
 
A Prince William County woman was fatally shot by her husband outside a Woodbridge Chick-fil-A restaurant Thursday morning after an ongoing domestic dispute, police said.

Police arrived at the fast-food restaurant just before 9 a.m. and found Alice Jenkins Everette, 48, of Dumfries dead in her silver Chrysler. She had been shot several times, police said.

Police have charged Daniel Lunie Everette, 52, of the 9100 block of Broken Oak Place in Burke with murder and use of a firearm in commission of a felony.

Prince William police spokesman Jonathan Perok said the couple was married but had separated. The incident happened in the restaurant’s parking lot, and there were no other injuries, Perok said. He declined to say whether anything happened immediately before the shooting or how the two ended up at the restaurant.
 
 Seriously though, according to other sources Daniel had a history of abusing his wife, for which she left him. Ladies, this tragedy just goes to show, aggression is generally a behavior that people have a lot of trouble changing. Most never change.

About Us
 Street Digest is a media outlet that focuses on the dark side of the news, most of which receives little coverage by the national press. Rising murder rates among juvenile adolescence, increasing drug abuse and rampant poverty are often suppressed and hidden in the alleys of the towns they take place in. We help expose the reality of what takes place every day in these cities. These images and news feeds bring light to a topic often avoided by the American media and gives a voice to the lost generation of the abandoned underclass trapped in daily urban warfare.
