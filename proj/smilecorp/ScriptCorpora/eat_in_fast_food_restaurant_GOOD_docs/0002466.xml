I love BBQ and I love brisket. Famous Dave&apos;s does them both well. The place is neat too. The waitstaff is typically attentive. It&apos;s also a bit pricey so expect at least $12-15 a head. Overall: I think it&apos;s worth eating there because the food is dynamite with a lot of choices in BBQ sauce - order the Devil&apos;s Spit.
