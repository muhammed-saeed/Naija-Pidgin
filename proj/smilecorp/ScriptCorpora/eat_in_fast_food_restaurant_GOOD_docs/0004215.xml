 im not sure ever since there have been incidents at both resturants. 2- 3 years ago a finger was found in someone&apos;s chili ( even though it turned out the woman had put it in there) and my aunt had taken me to taco bell and the serbice wansnt tht good though because the cashier was rude and impolite

 I like the spicey chicken burger and the chicken nuggets at Wendy&apos;s. There hamburgers though ... horrible. The&quot;baconator&quot;is disgusting, never eat it.

As for Taco Bell, I don&apos;t eat there. I prefer diarrhea free nights.

 Taco Bell is exquisite to me. Wendys has not been good to me of late. I had the baconator= too greasy and the triple stacker= just gross. Taco Bell has never let me down.

 I&apos;M NOT A HUGE FAN OF EITHER BUT IF I HAD TO CHOOSE IT WOULD BE WENDY&apos;S. TACO BELL IS DISGUSTING. FAKE MEXICAN FOOD WITH NO MEAT. ALL THEY SERVE YOU IS TONS OF LETTUCE WHAT THE HELL WHERE&apos;S THE MEAT!! AN INSULT TO REAL MEXICAN COOKING
