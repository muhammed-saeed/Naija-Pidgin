Weight Watchers Points for Fast Food
 Chicken Nuggets -- do you have enough points? By Deb Ng 
It&apos;s not difficult to find Weight Watchers Points for fast food. Several websites feature point values and the Weight Watchers Dining Out Companion also offers Weight Watchers points for fast food. However, keep in mind that point values for most fast foods are rather high, so you&apos;ll have to sacrifice other meals if you plan on dining in one of these restaurants.

What Are Weight Watchers Points for Fast Food?

As of 2010, the FlexPoints plan has been discontinued by Weight Watchers. With the Weight Watchers flex plan, each food had a certain point value. Each member on the flex plan was given a point allotment upon enrollment and a consultation with a program leader followed. If a member was only allowed 22 daily points, she had to plan menus in order to not exceed those points in a 24-hour period. Thirty-five extra points were allowed to be spread out during the week, however, so it was possible to go over your daily points and not &quot;cheat.&quot;

If you knew your Weight Watchers Points for fast food, you&apos;d be better able to plan the snacks and meals for the rest of the day. Because of their high fat and calorie content, fast foods tended to use up the bulk of the day&apos;s point allotment. Many members felt it best to avoid fast food as much as possible so as not to waste most of a day&apos;s points on a single meal. You could find Weight Watchers Point guides for fast food restaurants including Taco Bell, MacDonalds, Burger King and Wendys if necessary.

Alternatives

As you can see, Weight Watchers points for fast food could be rather high. If you&apos;re like most dieters, you don&apos;t want to waste the bulk of your points (calories, fat, or anything else you&apos;re tracking) on a bag of french fries. Instead, try one of these suggestions to help to cut calories and save points.

 When at all possible, grilled is better than fried. If you can order a grilled chicken sandwich, rather than a battered or breaded sandwich, go for the grilled. You can save 4 or more points by opting for grilled. Omit heavy sauces. Leaving off the tarter sauce, special sauce and mayonnaise can shave two to three points off a sandwich. Eat smaller portions. Instead of ordering a large burger, order a small kids burger. Order a salad if at all possible. By leaving out the meat, you could deduct 4 or 5 points on the old system. Try to use as little dressing as possible. Drink diet soda or water. Avoid the &quot;sides&quot;. French fries, potato salad and chili all are heavy in fat and calories. If you&apos;re still hungry request a side salad. 

Also, it may sound funny, but you can bring your own food. If you know ahead of time you&apos;ll be dining on fast food, pack a container of salad and eat that instead. The fast food might be a more attractive and convenient option, but you&apos;ll be thinner and healthier if you avoid it altogether.

These alternatives paved the way for the Momentum plan , which has replaced the FlexPoints plan and strives to nudge members into making healthier choices. While the FlexPlan allowed for unhealthy choices like fries within the parameters of the points per day (plus the 35 extra points to spread over the week), the Momentum plan teaches you to choose the healthier food options that provide more nutrition and keep you feeling full longer.
