Calorie Count On Fast Food Restaurants

Some cities are trying to force some fast food restaurants to post the calorie count on the foods they serve. Starbucks, Burger King, McDonalds, KFC, and Subway are some of these restaurants.

People that are for this legislation say that if people saw how many calories are in each dish they might not buy the higher calorie ones but choose a lower calorie meal instead.

The fast food restaurants are against this because they are forced to do this only because they have voluntarily made the calories of their food public already. They have posted all the nutritional facts and calories on their websites.

What do you think? Would people choose the lower calorie meals or eat what they feel like having when they walked in? Is this new legislation just another way of the government barging in to our private lives? Should this legislation be forced only on the restaurants who have already disclosed this information and not on restaurants that haven&apos;t?
