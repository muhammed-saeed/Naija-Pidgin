The Life Principles of Voluntary Simplicity

 

Life Principle #1: Do Justice 

1- New Year&apos;s Day . Reflect.&quot;The Lord of hosts is exalted by justice.&quot;-Isaiah 5:1

2-Voluntary Simplicity is not about following rules, but about living by
principles. Living more simply is about personal responsibility. It&apos;s seeing
where our lives may be extravagant, even out-of-control, and deciding what
to do a little at a time to cut down on overconsumption. Don&apos;t begin cold
turkey. You might get frustrated and give up.

3-20% of the world&apos;s population - the Overconsumers - use 80% of the resources
and the other 80% - the Sustainers - use only 20%. Our planet cannot sustain
life if everyone lived like the Overconsumers. The motto of voluntary simplicity
begins to make sense: Live simply that others may simply live. This
calendar challenges us Overconsumers - virtually every person in North America,
Western Europe and Japan - to offer up an Environmental Tithe, to reduce
consumption of all resources by at least 10%. God put us on Earth to be stewards
of Creation - sustainers, not abusers; protectors, not dominators.

4- Living more simply may mean dealing with our own resentment when others
don&apos;t&quot;get it.&quot;When we are making corrections to live more responsibly
and
others don&apos;t seem to have the slightest inclination to change their wasteful
ways, we may feel angry. We can be living testimonials. We are not judgmental
but we speak up whenever we have the chance.

5-Simplicity is not&quot;living on the cheap.&quot;It&apos;s more than being
 frugal, far from being a tightwad, and surely not being a miser. In some cases
 it may
mean actually paying more for tools that are Earth-friendly. Instead it&apos;s
a journey to find more meaning, more joy, more fun in life by getting out
from under the burden of so much stuff - to remove the barrier of stuff that
keeps us apart from other people, from God and even from ourselves.

6- Epiphany . Consider using Alternatives An Epiphany Celebration in your congregation. 
Read it at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; Services &gt;&gt; Archives &gt;&gt; Christmas &gt;&gt; Epiphany 
or visit SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; Services &gt;&gt; Archives &gt;&gt; Christmas Pack 1991 (or click here) or SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; Services &gt;&gt; Archives &gt;&gt; Whose Birthday 1999) (or click here) 

7-The first principle is not&quot;Think about Justice,&quot;or even&quot;Believe in Justice.&quot;It&apos;s&quot;Do Justice!&quot;Besides our prayers, our contributions, and our
pressure on governments, we help the world&apos;s poor by consuming less, thereby
making
more available for others. Biblical justice reflects God&apos;s great love for
the poor and our parallel call to live in a way that positively responds
to their needs.

8-In face of an economic system and an advertising industry that pressure
us, we CAN take control of our own buying patterns! We can beat this addiction
of overconsumption day by day... and then share ideas of simpler living with
others.

For more information read Living More with Less, pp. 22-29; Treasury
of Celebrations , pp. 127-129; To Celebrate , pp. 27, 87-89. View
Alternatives&apos; video Break Forth into Joy!: Beyond a Consumer Lifestyle ,
Main Segment.

 

Life Principle #2: Learn from the World Community 

9-Reflect.&quot;And what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and
to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&quot;- Micah 6:8. We have
a great deal to learn from people in Third World countries, most of whom
live simply by necessity, not choice. More about food in October.

10- All things are connected . We want to help those poor people with
THEIR problem OVER THERE. However, we need to realize many of their problems
are caused by OUR problem OVER HERE, our overconsumption.

11- A black bishop from Africa said,&quot;White folks... yes, they&apos;re the people
who can sing and NOT move at the same time.&quot;African music can help liberate
other Christians.

12-For every Christian that North America and Western Europe loses, Africa
gains three! We have something profound to learn from our African brothers
and sisters.

13-Ask yourself,&quot;What can I live without?&quot;Be uncomfortable. Take
 something off - a watch, an earring - as a reminder of less. Are you a slave
 to the
clock? Are you burdened by too many clothes or jewelry? Take something off.

14-Even people from our highly technological medical establishment are now
seeing the potential of learning from native healers/shamans. We are learning
natural cures from the rain forests.

15-What do children say when they want to do something they know is
irresponsible?&quot;But everybody&apos;s doing it!&quot;Let&apos;s try that in our lives.&quot;But
God, everybody&apos;s driving a new car.... But God, everybody builds a big, expensive
house that&apos;s many times bigger than they need, claiming it&apos;s for equity when
the kids leave home.... But God, everybody has a yard that looks like a golf
course so that nobody complains that we&apos;re lowering their property values....&quot;Sounds
just as silly and disconcerting as kids&apos; requests to sleep outdoors on a sidewalk
overnight to be in line for tickets to a rock concert.

16- Voluntary Simplicity is a consciousness , an awareness. It is
 a
matter of personal responsibility. Before we buy or use something ask,&quot;Do
I really need to do this?&quot;

 

Life Principle #3: Nurture People 

17- We find meaning in life through our relationships with God and with
people, not through stuff. Often we allow our things to own us. We go
into debt paying for something. We have to maintain it, then secure it so
nobody steals it! What owns whom?

18-Create a game with yourself that you can play with your children or
grandchildren. It&apos;s OK to admire things in stores and say,&quot;I like that.
I like THAT. I LIKE that.&quot;Make it not OK to say,&quot;I want that,&quot;or even
worse,&quot;I need that.&quot;

19-Think of the mall as a museum. Everything there is on display for your
pleasure, but somebody else owns it. As you stroll through the galleries
say,&quot;Thank you store person for putting this here for me to see. I&apos;m so
glad you&apos;re responsible for all this stuff and I&apos;M NOT.&quot;

20- Intimacy ... getting to know someone well... opening oneself up.
When we choose to be intimate with our spouse, things can get in the way.
To be intimate we may choose to take something off... to take everything
off. Stuff can get in the way of intimacy in other situations as well. We
can learn to recycle stuff and put relationships first.

21-Cooperative, non-competitive games nurture relationships. 
 Try The Christmas Game, The Anytime Game, Lifestories : 
 a fun board game of telling tales; Futurestories ;
and Conversation Pieces : Parents, Kids and Other Animals. See September
19 for more titles.

22-A weekly family meeting at a set time helps to coordinate schedules
and gives children respect, inclusiveness and empowerment. It can also diffuse
arguments. At a time of tension, one can say,&quot;Let&apos;s take this up at the
family meeting.&quot;Take turns taking minutes. Follow with family fun-time.

23- Reading aloud year-round, as well as telling one&apos;s own stories,
builds relationships. When a parent reads to a child, a grandparent to a
grandchild, spouses to each other, the act is as important as the story.

24-&quot;Quality time&quot;can be a myth, an excuse to spend a little time
 together in order to spend more time working to make more money to accumulate
 more
stuff. Quantity time is also needed for healthy relationships, being there...
in sports and fun, worship, talking, the arts. If you find this is a problem,
discipline yourself to keep track of relationship time and increase it 10%
each month till you reach your goal.

For more information read Living More with Less, pp. 37-42. View
Alternatives&apos; video Break Forth into Joy! Family&amp;Children Segment.

 

Other January holidays include- Martin Luther King Day ( Third Monday).
 Read Treasury of Celebrations, pp. 130-131; To Celebrate , pp.
 89-91. Consider Alternatives&apos;&quot;Dr. King Was Right&quot;bulletin insert
 for your congregation.

 

Life Principle #4: Non-conform Freely 

25-The forces against living simply are extremely powerful and devious. Some
of them are quiet, unwritten... like how we dress in church, how our house
will look at Christmas time. But many of them can be loud, in-your-face forces
that work to get as deeply into our pocketbook as possible. (See September
for media pressures.)

26-Let&apos;s say what overconsumption often represents - addiction . As
any addiction, it is powerful. It takes great will power, faith, and the
right tools to beat an addiction. The addiction of overconsumption is reinforced
by our culture. It is encouraged, fed, promoted by peer pressure and by
advertising. We are told it is patriotic to buy, that our economy depends
on it, that we are&quot;worth it.&quot;We are worth much more than our stuff!

27-Worth Reading - Your Money or Your Life; How Much Is Enought? 

28-Small groups could benefit from: Living More with Less Study Guide,
Your Money or Your Life Study Guide, Simple Living / Compassionate Life . Alternatives&apos;
video Break Forth into Joy!: Beyond a Consumer Lifestyle won a Gold
Medal at the Houston International Film Festival! Now also on audio cassette.

29-&quot;Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?&quot;-from Matthew
6:24-33. How do my clothes reflect my personality and my values? Did the
people who made my clothes get a fair wage for their work? Go to your clothes
closet. Choose enough clothes to wear a different outfit each day for a week.
Put the other clothes aside. Wear only the clothes you&apos;ve chosen for the
next two weeks. (from Trek )

30-Shop at Goodwill and other thrift shops. Wear clothes from other cultures.
Support others who break clothing stereotypes. Show the great fraud of&quot;The
clothes make the man&quot;and&quot;Dress for success.&quot;Is wearing&quot;nice&quot;clothes
to church a matter of giving God our best? Wearing expensive clothes is giving
our best to ourselves and our clique-mates .

31-We can object when people suggest dress codes for voluntary events, such
as company parties or church activities. Must men always feel obliged to
wear a tie?

For more information read Living More with Less, pp. 51-72,&amp;pp. 99-117 (Clothes). View Alternatives&apos; video Break Forth into Joy! Taking Action Segment.

 FEBRUARY 

Celebrating More Responsibly

Music/Worship

1-Musicians are not exempt from the call to offer help to the needy and to
care for God&apos;s Creation. Urge your congregation to put on a benefit concert,
including some music of social responsibility. A great musical is Lazarus from Bread for the World.

2-Write a letter to the music publishers your congregation uses the most.
Urge them to use recycled paper and soy-based inks when they print their
music. For a sample letter, contact Alternatives.

3-A great, inexpensive hymnal on social responsibility is Banquet of
Praise from Bread for the World. Give a copy to your Minister of Music
and offer to buy more copies for your choir, youth group or congregation.

4-Alternatives eStore Worship Resources 
include hymns, Bible studies, litanies, etc. on Care of Gods Creation. The Hymn Society in
the United States and Canada (TheHymnSociety.org or 800/THE-HYMN) has several collections and papers
on topics related to Voluntary Simplicity.

5-BWAAG (Better World Artists&apos;&amp;Activists&apos; Guild) says,&quot;Never underestimate
the power within you to make a better world.&quot;This non-profit, national
ecumenical network of individuals who are committed to enriching the peace
and social justice ministers of congregations and related organizations has
produced several recordings and songbooks.

6-Investigate Alternatives booklets and recordings Sing Justice! Do Justice! and Stories and Songs of Simple Living .

7-In Celtic Christianity, the wild goose is a symbol for the Holy Spirit.
Wild Goose Songs from the Iona Community in Scotland are very direct and
powerful. Visit SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; eStore &gt;&gt; Spiritual &gt;&gt; Worship.

8-After the Bible, the hymnal often is the second most important book to
many Christians. If you do not have one, buy your denominational hymnal for
your office and home for private and family daily devotions. Read one hymn
per day as poetry. Sing the ones you know.

More on celebrating more responsibly in November and December. For more
information read Living More with Less , pp. 188-208 (Celebrations); Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 10-13, 39-126; To Celebrate ,
pp. 11-26.

 

Other February holidays include: 19th- Day of Remembrance ( To
Celebrate , pp. 94-95); Purim ( To Celebrate , p. 95 ); Chinese New Year ( To Celebrate , p. 96); Black History
Month . 

 

Preparing for Lent, Easter and Other Spring Festivals

9-Celebrations belong to people. They are not natural resources to be strip-mined
each year for the sake of profit. Treasury of Celebrations channels
our desire to celebrate into activities that truly nourish the human spirit,
express our solidarity with all the earth&apos;s people, and respect the environment.
If you are not satisfied with consumer-oriented celebrations, this big book
of creative ideas will help you resist consumer pressures and celebrate in
a more spiritually fulfilling, joyful way.

10-&quot;Freedom from anxiety is characterized by three inner attitudes. If what
we have we receive as a gift, and if what we have is to be cared for by God,
and if what we have is available to others, then we possess freedom from
anxiety. This is the inward reality of simplicity. However, ifwhat we have
we believe we have gotten and if what we have we believe we must hold onto,
and if what we have is not available to others, then we live in anxiety.
Such persons will never know simplicity regardless of the outward contortions
they may put themselves through in order to live &apos;the simple life.&apos;&quot;-Richard
Foster

11-Alternatives&apos; numerous Worship, Study&amp;Activity Guides for Lent and
Easter include&quot;An Easter Seder&quot;(meal) and&quot;A Passover Seder.&quot;Some
resources
are intergenerational.

12- Lincoln &apos; s Birthday. What values do we really admire in heroes?
Who do we pick to be our heroes?

13-&quot;If I give away all my possessions... but do not have love, I gain nothing.&quot;-
 from I Corinthians 13. What keeps me from giving the gift of myself more often?
 What non-material gifts could I gave on the various gift-giving occasions
during the year? (from Trek )

14- St. Valentine &apos; s Day ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp.
132-133; To Celebrate , pp. 92-94). St. Valentine is the patron saint
of prisoners. Distribute Alternatives&apos; bulletin inserts&quot;The First Valentine:
I was a prisoner and you visited me,&quot;or&quot;St. Valentine, Thoreau&amp;Other
Prisoners of Conscience: When Conscience and Government Collide.&quot;

15-Alternatives&apos; numerous 40 Day Calendars for Lent (in bulletin inserts
and/or poster format) can be used within lectionary cycles or not. Some also
come in Spanish; one is for children.

 

For more information read Treasury of Celebrations , Part III, pp.
127-227

 

On Ash Wednesday (beginning of Lent) we are reminded of our mortality.
What do we really want to accomplish in our lifetime? Daydream about people
living in harmony in a clean environment. Make the fantasy as positive and
fun as possible. Focus on the people and the Earth interacting, not on&quot;stuff,&quot;things, possessions or money. ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 135-140; To Celebrate , pp. 97-100)

 

Rites of Passage

17- Treasury of Celebrations: Create Celebrations That Reflect Your Values
and Don &apos; t Cost the Earth contains life affirming ways to celebrate
holidays and rites of passage, such as births, graduations and deaths. It draws material from the six Alternate Celebrations Catalogs published
from 1973-87 by Alternatives and adds new ideas in its 384 pages. To
Celebrate: Reshaping Holidays and Rites of Passage is the only predecessor
of Treasury still in print.

18-The average American wedding now costs over $27,000. We can find value
and meaning without going into debt. The Alternative Wedding Book helps
create a beautiful wedding that reflects true family values and doesn&apos;t cost
the earth. It comes in English (softbound book or packet for photocopying)
or in Spanish.

19-The January-February, 1997, issue of Modern Bride Magazine contained
940 pages! The Alternative Wedding Book offers alternatives to engaged
couples, clergy and others... alternatives to the bridal magazines and
professional bridal consultants. It encourages couples to use their imaginations
as they incorporate their values and family and ethnic traditions in planning
meaningful wedding celebrations. It&apos;s a practical planning guide with personal
stories from people who chose more than the status quo wedding.

20- The Alternative Wedding Book details ways to sort out what is important
to you and make your wedding what you want it to be. It gives guidelines
for ceremonies (with eight complete examples) and practical and cost-cutting
tips on food, flowers, decorations, photography, clothing, music, location,
setting, entertainment, invitations, even choosing rings. The Wedding
Timeline/Checklist is a fast and easy way to make sure your plans run smoothly
and that everything gets done. The Budget Worksheet will help you save money
and time.

21-What messages about material goods do I get from my church or faith community?
Do my closest friends push me toward deeper values, or make it harder to
live them out? (from Trek )

22-New Road Ministries (803/892-2556) offers bereavement seminars and video.
Alternatives offers the classic Dealing Creatively with Death and
numerous children&apos;s books dealing with death and grieving. Is a resource
on funerals needed?

 

For more information read Treasury of Celebrations , Part IV, pp. 228-284; To Celebrate , pp. 169-218; The Alternative Wedding Book ; Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 250-264; To Celebrate , pp. 191-201.

Other February holidays include on Third Monday- President&apos;s Day (Washington&apos;s Birthday observed) ( To Celebrate , p. 95).

 

What Is&quot;Enough&quot;?

23-Meditate on the concept of&quot;enough.&quot;&quot;Give me neither poverty nor riches;
feed me with the food that I need.&quot;- from Proverbs 30:7-9.&quot;The one who
had much did not have too much, and the one who had little did not have too
little.&quot;-II Corinthians 8:15. Do I think a world where everyone has enough
is part of God&apos;s vision for humankind?

24-&quot;Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor
for that which does not satisfy?&quot;-from Isaiah 55:1-5. Do I give the people
who love me what they most want from me? Am I able to spend the time I need
to build special relationships with the people I love?

25-What is a good balance of&quot;deferred gratification&quot;and&quot;taking no thought
for tomorrow?&quot;Will the amount of things I own continue to grow throughout
my life, or will I eventually say,&quot;that&apos;s enough&quot;? How much do I need
to
accumulate before I can do what I really want to do? What am I doing now
to enjoy life?

26-Spend an evening with one of your parents, a grandparent or other friend
who has retired. Invite them to talk about the choices they have made about
how to spend their lives. What choices have brought them the most joy? What
do they wish they had done more of?

27-Do I use the things I own to build walls or bridges between myself and
others? What messages do I receive about the need or desirability of&quot;having
my own space&quot;? Who gives me those messages? If a fire destroyed my place,
who would I ask to give me emergency housing?

28-Meditate on&quot;hospitality.&quot;What is the finest gift I can offer
 a visitor who comes into my life? When have I been received into someone&apos;s
 home or
living space with great hospitality? What did they do to make me feel welcome?
Who makes me feel most at ease in his or her presence? How does he or she
make me feel at ease?

29- Leap Year Day. What to do with an extra day? How can I work for
just enough without tying myself into knots of guilt and despair?

Global Justice

Hunger&amp;Homelessness

1-Our language shapes the way we think. Inclusive language opens us to more
inclusive lives. Inclusive language may seem a little awkward because it
feels new or different, not because it&apos;s wrong.

2-Using inclusive language does not assume that everyone is alike or even
equal in abilities. It recognizes that each person has different gifts but
that we treat all with respect, not with prejudice. All are of equal value
in God&apos;s sight.

3-When we hear the term&quot;politically correct&quot;or&quot;PC,&quot;someone may be denigrating
inclusive language.

4-&quot;Sexism,&quot;&quot;racism,&quot;&quot;ageism&quot;are expressions of prejudice, that we&quot;pre-judge&quot;people by their age, race or gender. We make up our mind about someone before
getting to know them. All of these are very real. They combine prejudice
and power. We can&apos;t escape prejudice but we can catch ourselves, say&quot;Ooops,&quot;and instead be open to the person.

5-Our attitudes about global justice are reinforced by language. We may think
of people in developing countries as less than we because of their race or
income. We may take a condescending or superior attitude, wanting to help&quot;those poor souls.&quot;Instead, let&apos;s offer our help, not impose it, like we
would want others to offer us help when we&apos;re in need. We&apos;re all family...
the human family.

6-Beware of media and organizations that spread unconscious and excessive
American nationalism, that suggest that Americans are superior than others
because of our great wealth and power, that play on our fear of the unknown.

7-Do we impose titles on people, such as&quot;Mr. and Mrs.,&quot;that they have not
requested? Do we call people by their first names or diminutives when such
may show a lack of respect?

8- International Women &apos; s Day ( Treasury of Celebrations ,
pp. 141-144; To Celebrate , p. 107)

For more information read Treasury of Celebrations , Part I: Making
Choices, pp. 14-87.

Orthodox Lent usually begins in March.

Hunger and Homelessness

(continued)

9-Front line organizations, such as World Vision, Oxfam, Care, Heifer Project,
Self Help, provide direct aid and self-help programs to needy people. Advocacy
groups, like Bread for the World, lobby governments to do more for the needy.
The U.S. government has access to more resources than do private organizations
that depend on contributions. Participate in Bread&apos;s OFFERING of LETTERS
at your local chapter or congregation or in your home.

10-Investigate the magazines at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; eStore &gt;&gt; Misc, &gt;&gt; Magazines, 
such as New Internationalist :the People, the Ideas, the Action 
in the Fight for World Development

11-Your congregation probably has a Social Ministry Committee. Find out what
the members do. Typical projects are direct help, such as serving at the
local Soup Kitchen, or education, such as a Social Concerns Fair. Resolve
to participate in one project this year.

12-Your denomination probably has a national or regional hunger office. Contact
it, find out what it does and consider giving it a contribution this year.
Church World Service (800/456-1310 or ChurchWorldService.org) sponsors the national interfaith CROP
Walks each year. Either walk or sponsor a walker this fall. Help start a
walk if your community doesn&apos;t have one yet.

13-Worth Reading - Sojourners : Faith, Politics and Culture; WORLDWATCH produces the influential Vital Signs report and the annual State of the World . Bread for the World
(800/822-7323) issues the annual Hunger Report. Visit SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; eStore &gt;&gt; Misc. &gt;&gt; Magazines, and SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; AboutUs &gt;&gt; Links.

14- Check to see if your city and state have a Human Rights Commission. Make
one phone call to find out what they do to confront prejudice. Check the
government section in the front of your phone book.

15-Simplicity is not romanticizing poverty, monks, the Amish or people who
struggled through the Great Depression. We only diminish those people&apos;s devotion
or struggle, and we tend to try to make the journey of discipleship look
silly or&quot;for others,&quot;unrelated to us, untouchable. Poverty is NOT fun.
Two thirds of the world population live in poverty involuntarily. We have
a choice.

16-&quot;Just as you did it to one of the least of these... you did it to me.&quot;-from
Matthew 25:31-40. What sense of connection with people in need can unlock
my compassion and generosity? Was there ever a time when I really didn&apos;t
have enough money? How did or does that make me feel about people who are
wealthier than me? (from Trek )

 

Peace/Violence

 

17- St. Patrick &apos; s Day ( To Celebrate , p. 108). Ponder&quot;If you want peace, work for justice.&quot;August 6 is Peace Day or Hiroshima
Day.

18-The pursuit of Peace: 12 steps of peacemaking can make your faith more
than just talk. 1. Pray for peace and for one another. 2. See faces. 3. Learn
names and stories. 4. Take the first step to love. 5. Reach out and touch.
6. Find common ground. 7. Make relationships concrete. 8. Give peace offerings.
9. Learn languages. 10. Eat together. 11. Celebrate together. 12. Stand with
those in danger. -Ann Helmke

19-Does your denomination have a Peace and Justice office? Investigate Fellowship
of Reconciliation, an association of religious Peace Fellowships. Call
914/358-4601, ask for a copy of Fellowship Magazine .

20-Contact Center of Concern: Promoting Global Justice and Peace since 1971 (CenterOfConcern.org)
 or Pax Christi (PC-USA.org) which works for peaces for all humankind.

21- First Day of Spring ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 145-148; To Celebrate , pp. 108-110). What can you do to reduce street crime?
Would you join a brigade to remove gang-related graffiti?

22-Alternatives offers many resources designed for children or people who
work with children (like parents!). We hope to affect children&apos;s buying habits
early because they are targeted by so many advertisers. A well-intentioned
grandmother said,&quot;I like to spoil my grandchildren when they&apos;re little.
But when they turn ten, I CUT &apos;EM OFF.&quot;We&apos;re hoping to be a little more
helpful.

23-Read Alternatives&apos;&quot;War Toys and Christmas: A Contradiction in Terms&quot;and&quot;Organize for Peace: How to Start a Peacemaking Group in Your Church.&quot;

 

Advocacy/Boycotts

24- Central America Week ( Treasury of Celebrations , p. 141; To Celebrate , pp. 110-111)

25-Over the years people of faith have used boycotts to reduce poor social
practices among businesses, such as Nestle Company&apos;s practices in the Third
World. The organizer of that boycott is still at work for other causes - InFact.org 
(Challenging Corporate Abuse, Building Grassroots Power, Since 1977). 
 Most denominations have an advocacy office. Contact
yours and find out what they do. Alternatives&apos;&quot;Reaching Out Through the
Media&quot;helps promote events and causes.

26-Small, every day protests can be effective. Businesses listen to buyers.
Most want to avoid controversy. Most want to do business quietly as usual,
even if some results are harmful or wasteful... as long as they&apos;re profitable.
The strongest way to challenge such businesses occurs when we might diminish
their&quot;bottom line.&quot;Change to a different maker of a similar product that
is less wasteful. Then write a letter explaining your concern or join an
organized boycott to make sure that the egregious company gets the point.

27-Assertive folks buy one share of an offending company&apos;s stock, file
shareholder resolutions, attend the annual meeting and verbally protest the
company&apos;s policies.

28-To find out what boycotts are currently in effect, get Co-op
America &apos; s Boycott Action News , (800/58-GREEN or CoopAmerica.org).
 Each issue gives names, addresses and phone numbers of the organizers and the targets, and
the reasons for the boycott.

29-An organization like WorkingAssets.com (800/548-2567) provides long distance,
credit card and investment services and is an advocate for change. Their
profits go to a wide variety of grassroots organizations, voted on by the
customers annually.

30-Find out who your local, state and national government representatives
are. Your local library or League of Women Voters can provide a list of names,
addresses, phone and e-mail. Write at least one letter expressing your support
for laws (and lawmakers!) that protect the environment, not degrade it. You
can also call your senators&apos; and representative&apos;s office in your part of
the state. Check directory assistance.

31-Government officials are influenced by hand written letters instead of
signed form letters or&quot;petitions.&quot;Most organizations will supply a sample
letter on an issue that you want to address. You can then word it in your
own style. Address your letter to: Senator ___, United States Senate, Washington,
DC 205l0; Representative ___, House of Representatives, Washington, DC 205l5.
Or call the Capitol switchboard (202/244-3121) to talk with your members
of Congress or to get their FAX numbers or e-mail addresses. Close a letter
with&quot;Please let me hear from you on this issue.&quot;Most will respond, at least
with a form letter presenting their position.

Voluntary Simplicity Life Principle #5: Cherish the Natural Order 

 

Water

 

1 - Read the Story of the Creation in Genesis chapters 1&amp;2. Reflect
on&quot;And Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it
and take care of it.&quot;-Genesis 2:15.

2 - Our water is both precious and finite. While water covers 3/4 of the
Earth&apos;s surface, 97.4% is salt water; 1.8% is frozen; only 0.8% is fresh
water. Let&apos;s challenge the wasting and poisoning of our water supply. Over
1.5 billion people lack safe drinking water. Here&apos;s an invitation to conserve!

3 -Turn the water off when not needed while washing hands, shaving, brushing
teeth. Washing hands with tap running constantly takes two gallons; only
one with the tap off and on. Shaving, tap on, 20 gallons; tap off, only one;
brushing teeth, tap on, 10; tap off, only 1/2!

4 - How much water would I use each day if I had to pump or carry it by hand?
(from Trek ) Normal toilet flushing uses 5-7 gallons. Fill a small
milk jug and put it in the tank. Better yet, install an efficient toilet
that uses fewer than 2 gallons.

5 - A small leak from a faucet can waste 50 gallons of water per day. Fix
leaky faucets. When using public facilities, report drips to the proper
authorities. Ask why automatic sprinklers are running in the rain. Why do
we water the street? When appropriate, recommend a drip system instead of
sprinklers for lawn and garden.

6 - The average washing machine uses 40 gallons per load. Can you wash fewer
loads each week? Review your rationale for washing. Is it based on global
solidarity, health considerations or advertising?&quot;Sparkling clean&quot;sells
more soap but might do nothing for our health.

7 - Take only the number of showers you really need. Try one fewer this week.
Need a shower to wake up? Wash your face instead. Install low flow shower
heads. A regular shower uses 25 gallons; tub bath, 36. But a wet-down, soap-up,
rinse-off shower uses only about four gallons! Turn off the water while soaping.

8 - It takes 1000 gallons of water to produce one pound of aluminum. If your
state does not have a deposit on beverage containers, petition your state
representatives to require it. Reduce or cease using aluminum cans altogether.
Both producing and recycling aluminum are financially and ecologically costly.

Holidays that usually fall in April: Ramadan ; Second Week before Mother&apos;s
Day- National Farm Worker Week ; Holy Week (week before Easter),
including Palm/Passion Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday; Easter
Sunday (Resurrection of Jesus); First Day of Passover; Orthodox
Easter 

To learn more about these holidays, obtain To Celebrate or Treasury
of Celebrations. 

 

Energy

 

9 - At church, home or office heat only the part of the building you are
using, not the whole thing, with high efficiency space heaters.

10 - Set thermostats no higher than 68F in the winter and no lower than 78F
in the summer. Dress appropriately. Style is no excuse to waste energy! Layers
of clothing can be put on or taken off to keep comfy. Use the body&apos;s natural
heating and cooling systems.

11 - Consider using spot lighting rather than general lighting. Convert
incandescent bulbs to fluorescent or other high efficiency bulbs. Turn off
incandescent lights whenever not in use; turn off fluorescent lights if you
do not expect to return within an hour.

12 - Wash the dishes by hand today; get somebody to help; tell jokes. Hang
the clothes out to dry this week. Inquire about an energy audit from your
local utility.

13 - Plan recreation that gives physical exercise and/or builds relationships
but uses little fuel or other nonrenewable resources. Take only short trips
or carpool, walk, bike or use public transit.

14 - Turn your water heater thermostat down to no higher than 120F. After
heating and air conditioning, the water heater is usually the biggest user
of energy in a house. Wrapping it in a thermal blanket will increase it&apos;s
insulation and your savings.

15 - Worth Reading - Eco-Justice Capsules from the NCC Eco-Justice
Working Group at NCCEcoJustice.org; Eco-Justice Notes from Eco-Justice.org.

16 - Read the Story of Noah in Genesis 6-9:17. Reflect on 6:19-22 and 9:8-17.
God does not want the Earth harmed.

For more information read Living More with Less, pp. 43-50.

 

Chemicals&amp;Waste

 

17 - Reflect on the implications of the Prophet.&quot;Is it not enough for you
to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture
with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also
muddy the rest with your feet?&quot;- Ezekiel 34:18

18 - Reduce the use of make-up by at least 10%. Let your natural beauty shine!
Be aware of the pressure on women to conform to&quot;Madison Avenue&apos;s&quot;standard
of appearance. Read labels. If you must use make-up, only use brands not
tested on animals.

19 - Reduce the use of chemicals for cleaning. Then use only biodegradable,&quot;green&quot;products. Are our standards based on health or appearance? Can our
Earth afford the&quot;whitest white&quot;?

20 - Reduce chemicals on your lawn and garden. Consider a low-maintenance
lawn (like Buffalo grass) that requires less water and mowing. Reduce lawn
mowing by at least 10%. An average gas mower cutting an average American
lawn pollutes as much as a 300 mile car trip.

21 - The first R is the most important... and hardest for Americans... REDUCE.
That&apos;s what Simple Living is about. As important as recycling is, it is not
an excuse for waste. It&apos;s more important to REDUCE consumption and waste.

22 - Earth Day . The earth belongs to God and therefore cannot be held
perpetually. -Leviticus 25:23

23 - How can I learn to say joyfully,&quot;Here. Take this. It is the best that
I have.&quot;When have I most joyfully given to someone in need? What allowed
me to give so joyfully? (from Trek )

24 - E the Environmental Magazine is a bimonthly,
independent publication that works to inspire people to educate themselves
on issues in order to take action to effect change personally and/or politically. 
Visit EMagazine.com Subscribe at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; eStore &gt;&gt; Misc &gt;&gt; Magazines.

 

Consumables

 

25 - Think of the implications for the Creation of John 3:16-21 -&quot;For God
so loved the world...&quot;People, animals, plants, all Creation.

26 - Use cloth napkins. Throw a paper napkin away only after it&apos;s completely
used.

27 - Share at least one newspaper or magazine subscription with a friend
or neighbor or read it at the office or the library. Renew subscriptions
based on need, not out of habit. It takes 17 trees to make one ton of paper
from non-recycled sources. It takes about 280 gallons of water to produce
one large Sunday paper (after the trees are grown).

28 - Recycle paper, metal, glass, etc. Set up properly marked bins at home,
church, work, school. Volunteer to help get the materials to the recycling
center. If your community does not have curb-side pick up of recyclables,
petition City Council to start it, even if it means an additional fee or
tax.

29 - Take your own mugs, plates and silver if you go to a fast food restaurant.
Use them instead of disposable cups and plates. Keep these items handy in
your car or on your bike. Make a list of other disposables to avoid.

30 - Avoid toys and products that use batteries. When batteries are unavoidable,
use only rechargeable batteries.

The last week of April is International TV Turnoff Week from the Center for Screen-Time Awareness. Escape the
Fantasy - Get Real! No more radiation, laugh tracks or gratuitous violence.
And once you try real life, you may never want to go back to the simulated
variety again. Info at TVTurnOff.org

 May 

Environment - The 4 R&apos;s

 

Reduce

 

1- Ponder:&quot;There are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate
more and more. The other is to desire less.&quot;- G.K. Chesterton

2 - During a family or community meeting ask,&quot;Are we committed to work through
this calendar together? What is our &apos;comfort level&apos; in reducing consumption?
(10%?) How far are we willing to stretch? How do our faith and church help
us or hinder us to make a commitment to God&apos;s Creation?&quot;

3 - Conduct a Personal Environmental Audit. How much waste do I produce?
How much of how many resources do I waste? How do I overconsume? Make a list.
Add to it as you go. For help, try Better World Handbook and other resources in the Environment section of Alternatives eStore.

4 - So many positive changes are possible. Don&apos;t try to do them all at once.
Start now, even if you&apos;re unsure of the result. Getting started is what&apos;s
important. As we succeed, we&apos;re more open to doing something new. Take this
pledge or write your own.&quot;For the sake of myself, of others and of God&apos;s
Creation, I pledge to learn about my overconsumption and to do what I can
to curb it.&quot;

5 - Cinco de Mayo (Mexican independence day)

6 - Evangelical Environmental Network produces Creation Care Magazine and has issued several books.
 It encourages small groups and conducts service projects. Visit CreationCare.org. 
 Religious Campaign for Forest Conservation conducts a series of explorations of nature 
 (weekend seminars) and other activities. Visit EcoStewards.org/rcfc.

7 - Until my son graduated from high school he had not been able to save
money. Despite all of our modeling of frugal behavior, he spent it as fast
as he made it. Then he said,&quot;Ya know, Dad, if I don&apos;t spend so much money,
I don&apos;t have to make so much money.&quot;

8 - We hope that our children will not succumb to the pressures of
overconsumption that most call success. There are two ways to have the money
we need. We can earn more, or we can spend less. Voluntary Simplicity says
we&apos;ll have more time and energy for what really counts - for God and for
the people in our lives - if we choose to spend less on things we really
don&apos;t need.

Other May holidays include: 1st- May Day (To Celebrate , pp.
115); Ascension Day ; Shavuot ( To Celebrate , p. 116); Day of Pentecost (coming of the Holy Spirit) ( Treasury of
Celebrations , pp. 156-157; To Celebrate , pp. 115-116).

 

Reuse

 

9-Reusing means to use something over again. Refuse single-use consumables
like styrofoam cups. Use things that can be repaired. That&apos;s not easy because
so many thing are designed to break . It&apos;s called&quot;planned obsolescence.&quot;We can buy tools and appliances and shoes that can be repaired but we need
to do our homework to find them. It&apos;s not convenient.

10-Most denominations have an office dealing with Creation Stewardship or Eco-Justice. 
Contact yours, or Northwest Earth Institute (NWEI.org).

11-Educate yourself a bit about the subtle but powerful forces working against
Earth. Petition state and national governments to require&quot;full pricing&quot;of goods. Full pricing includes the environmental impact of the making and
disposing of goods.

12-Help reduce pollution. For example, learn about the detrimental effects
of golf courses. In Hawaii the runoff from the rapid growth of golf courses
for tourism is killing fish and making many residents sick.

13-&quot;If riches increase, set not your heart on them.&quot;-Psalm 62:10.&quot;Those
who trust in their riches will wither.&quot;-Proverbs. 11:28.&quot;Do not store up
for yourselves treasures on earth.&quot;-Matthew 6:21, 19. The biblical injunctions
against exploitation of the poor and the accumulation of wealth are clear
and straightforward. The Bible challenges nearly every economic value of
contemporary society.

14-Some Europeans are beginning to require manufacturers to be responsible
for the final disposition of their products. That should make manufacturers
a lot more concerned about how the product is built, repaired and recycled.
Petition government to make the manufacturers here responsible for an item
after it&apos;s been used.

15-Put a bucket in your shower to catch the cold water while you&apos;re waiting
for the hot. How many relatively easy uses can you think of for the water
in the bucket besides watering your indoor plants?

16-&quot;Do not damage the Earth or the sea or the trees.&quot;Revelation 7:3.

Other May holidays include on the Second Sunday- Mother &apos; s Day ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 158-164; To Celebrate , pp.
116-122).

 

Recycle

 

17-Recycling means making something new out of something that&apos;s already been
used. We recycle glass, paper and metal. We drop a can in the bin and carry
the bin to the curb on recycle day. That&apos;s a start. But that&apos;s really the
easiest and least necessary part of the whole cycle.

18-Even more important is pre-cycling - evaluating a product before buying it to make sure it is environmentally sound. Reduce
the need for recycling. Avoid products that use excess packaging. Let
manufacturers know you care. Chide the wasteful ones. Praise the helpful
ones. Go shopping with a cloth bag. If you forget, request a paper bag and
later use it to line your trash can. Decline plastic bags. Reuse paper bags.

19-Then close the loop ... buy products made of recycled materials,
such as plastic lumber. It does little good to recycle if we don&apos;t then buy
the products we use made of recycled materials. Recycling is not an excuse
to keep on overconsuming as long as we recycle. Buy only the paper products
you really need. It may for the time being cost a bit more to buy and use
recycled paper. Sometimes it costs more to do what&apos;s right. Can we afford to care for the Earth?

20-If a solicitation arrives that does not contain the recycled paper logo,
send it back in the postpaid return envelope with a protest letter. Contact
Alternatives for sample letter.

21-Worth Investigating Forum on Religion and Ecology. Visit ReligionAndEcology.org Earth Island Journal from Earth Island Institute. Visit EarthIsland.org Earthkeeping News from North American Coalition for Christianity and Ecology. Visit nacce.org.

22-We get so much junk mail, phone calls and email. 
To prevent your name, address and home phone number from being used for direct mail or telemarketing purposes, 
register free of charge with the Direct Marketing Associations Telephone Preference Service, 
PO Box 9014, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9014. 
For more information visit NewDream.org, click on Junk Mail..

23-&quot;The Earth is the Lord&apos;s and all that is in it.&quot;-from Psalm 24:1-6.
Contemplate a flower very closely. Notice the detail. Watch a sunset long
enough to see it slowly evolve. Be in awe of Nature. But beware of&quot;Bambi
Talk,&quot;thinking and speaking of animals as&quot;cute.&quot;The balance of nature
is held by life and death competition among animals and plants. All creation
deserves respect. Beware of cartoons that trivialize animals and nature,
and of animal-based fads that sell more comic books, clothing and other stuff.
Mammals, fish, birds and insects are not humans and need to be respected
for their place in God&apos;s Creation.

24-TargetEarth.org has developed a rainforest conference center in Belize. With the mission&quot;Serving the Earth, Serving the Poor,&quot;CEA has service opportunities in 15
countries; a full semester academic program; a retreat center in the Sierras;
and field stations in Zimbabwe, Brazil and the U.S. Its Eden Conservancy
buys endangered lands.

 

Restore

 

25-Do you get&quot;Living on Earth&quot;on your local public radio station? If so,
tune in. If not, petition the local manager to carry it and help find an&quot;underwriter&quot;to fund the broadcast.

26- Restoring ... remember what grandmother says,&quot;You got it out. You
put it back!&quot;The most common example is trees. But this also relates to
sustainable agriculture... putting natural, not synthetic nutrients back
in the soil. Restoring helps make up for past mistakes but never should be
used as a reason to make future ones. And some resources cannot be restored,
like oil and topsoil.

27-&quot;A tree farm is not a forest.&quot;A forest is an eco-system with animals
and insects. A tree farm is a place to produce a crop to make more paper,
building materials, furniture, etc. Tree farms may be necessary but are not
an excuse for de-forestation or clear-cutting.

28-At a population of 265 million, Americans constitute about 4.7% of the
current world population, yet are responsible for 30% of the total global
resource consumption. We have earned ourselves the dubious distinction of
becoming the most over populated nation on the planet. Over population is
determined not by the number of people, but by the degree to which a population
is out of balance with the environment. [Continued]

29-If we do not change, the 567 million people projected to be born in the
US in the 1990s will cause more environmental degradation than the 915 million
projected to be born in the global South during the same period. Do we have
the right to do that? -John Leon Fish

30-What does Jesus&apos; cleansing of the temple tell us about our role as disciples?
He was upsetting the status quo. Shall we be about the actual cleansing of
God&apos;s Creation? Has it become a den of thieves? How can we prevent it from
continually being corrupted by pollution and greed?

31-EarthMinistry.org produces Earth Letter , its&quot;mini-Journal
of Christian environmental spirituality&quot;and a variety of programs, workshops
and resource materials. It&apos;s mission is to engage, educate and inspire
individuals and congregations to deepen our relationship with creation and
with the God of creation.

Other May holidays include on the Last Monday- Memorial Day ( Treasury
of Celebrations , p. 164-166; To Celebrate , pp. 122-124).

Alternative Giving

 

Contributions

 

1-Reflect. Substitute the word&quot;stuff&quot;for money.&quot;No one can serve two
masters... You cannot serve God and wealth.&quot;-Matthew 6:24 (also Luke 16:13)

2-Confused by all the requests for money? Call your denominational office 
or consider a clearinghouse like IPM International Partners in Mission: 
An ecumenical ministry for justice and hope, that focuses on small, grassroots efforts 
around the world (ipm-connections.org). They do the homework. You
choose the organizations you prefer or let them choose.

3-Most groups now have foundations or endowments that receive tax-deductible
gifts while you&apos;re living or after you&apos;ve died. Check with your denomination.
Consider bequests in your will for your congregation, for your denomination
and for other worthy organizations, like Alternatives.

4-Some credit cards give you&quot;cash back,&quot;some charge no annual fee, others
have lower interest. The best ones give a percentage of your purchases to
charity. Many environmental groups offer these&quot;conscience cards.&quot;

5-Most of us use some criteria to decide who and what to support. Several
national magazines investigate non-profits and then publish lists of&quot;worthwhile
charities.&quot; The Other Side : Justice Rooted in Discipleship (800/700-9280)
publishes a Givers Guide occasionally.

6-Investigate MinistryOfMoney.org: Discipleship, Compassion, Stewardship, which
offers&quot;Third World pilgrimages,&quot;leads workshops and publishes a newsletter. 
Also,&quot;More Than Money&quot;quarterly from the non-profit Impact
Project explores the personal, political and spiritual impact of wealth in
our lives (MoreThanMoney.org).

7-Development Funds allow you to decide how much of the return you keep
and how much provides credits and small business assistance to poor
microentrepreneurs throughout the world. Community Loan Funds provide
a low but stable return and support small businesses.

8-&quot;One&apos;s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.&quot;-from Luke
12:13-34. What do I own that is not necessary for the activities I find most
meaningful? What would I do with my free time if I only had to spend half
as much time working? [ Trek ]

For more information read Treasury of Celebrations , Part II: Gifts,
pp. 88-126.

To obtain materials on Alternative Gift Markets, see To Celebrate ,
pp. 44-46. For a list of agencies you may wish to contact for more information
on a specific area of concern or for the purpose of making a charitable donation,
see Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 285-288; To Celebrate , pp.
223-224.

 

Volunteering

 

9-Reflect.&quot;For the love of money is root of all kinds of evil, and in their
eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced
themselves with many pains.&quot;-1 Timothy 6:6-10.

10-Many denominations have a volunteer youth corps, placing high school and
college graduates into places of need for one or two years. The U.S. government&apos;s
Peace Corps (overseas assignments) and VISTA program (Volunteers in Service
to America-stateside placement) do not restrict by age.

11-Most service agencies (like Lutheran Social Service or Catholic Charities)
and service clubs (like Lions) welcome and need volunteers. Over 250 fraternal
organizations, such as Thrivent Financial Services and Knights of Columbus, plow
their profits back into our communities and congregations by giving challenge
grants and encouraging volunteerism.

12-NGO&apos;s -&quot;non-government organizations&quot;(like Red Cross) - can be very
effective in meeting social needs. Some, like Habitat for Humanity, are heavily
volunteer driven. Some, like Big Brothers and Sisters, are very personal
and one-on-one.

13-Learn how to say NO MORE. Most volunteer work is meaningful. But most
organizations will ask for more and more. We have to set our own limits.

14- Flag Day 

15-When the neighbor child comes to the door selling posters or overpriced
holiday wrap, send a contribution directly to the person in charge at the
school or church. That way, your contribution supports the program (not just
a fraction of it after the fundraising company has its cut) and is tax
deductible. Express your concern to the PTA or official that business interests
may be taking advantage of the kids. Offer to help raise funds another way.

16-Fundraising items that are useful and carry a message are available from
Earth Care. Their program for children includes environmentally friendly
products... greeting cards and wrapping paper made of recycled paper at a
discount, such as Northern Sun, Jim Morris T-shirts, EarthShirtz, Social T&apos;s and
Alternatives.

 

More Alternative Giving 

17-Reflect.&quot;Keep your lives from the love of money, and be content with
what you have; for he has said, &apos;I will never leave you or forsake you.&apos;&quot;-Hebrews
13:5

18-Translate your environmental tithe into cash. How much money have you
saved so far by conserving resources? Give that amount to an environmental
organization, preferably a grass roots Christian one.

19-Jesus washed others&apos; feet and instituted the Great Meal as symbols of
community. As a national community, our extravagant lives impact negatively
on people around the globe. Besides prayer and almsgiving, what other ways
can we work for Eco-Justice?

20-Consider&quot;giving of ourselves&quot;by volunteering time for groups that help
the truly needy... tree planting, public education/information, protest letters
and boycotts of polluters, lobbying governments, restoring housing, developing
rooftop and community gardens.&quot;Giving of ourselves&quot;includes our special
skills, like writing, carpentry, sewing, making music. What activity has
little or no value in our lives? TV? Movies? Could we reduce some entertainment
to allow more time for volunteering?

21- First Day of Summer ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 166-170; To Celebrate , pp. 124-129).&quot;God loves a cheerful giver.&quot;-2 Corinthians
9:7. Jesus calls all who would follow him to a joyful life of carefree unconcern
for possessions:&quot;Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone
who wants to borrow from you.&quot;-Matthew 5:42

22-Jesus experienced a slow and painful death for our sakes. The possibilities
for new relationship with God and others that he invites us to can be lived
out NOW with Creation. Pledge to help bring about reduction in the negative
environmental impact of our companies, churches or schools.

23-Jesus went through hell for our sakes. Are we willing to follow his example?
Take personal responsibility for breaking the cycle of addiction to
overconsumption. Pledge to raise your children in an environmentally sensitive
way and to set a good example for them.

24-Alternatives&apos; gift card&amp;envelope&quot;We Honor Christ&apos;s Birth by Continuing
His Work&quot;helps when we give gifts in other peoples&apos; names. Check with them
before giving or give to groups they already support or have said they would
like to support.

25-At the mid-point of the year, do you feel more free from the burdens of&quot;stuff&quot;separating us from others, from God, from ourselves? How many of
the ideas were you able to try? Seriously. How many can you continue? How
can we share our experience with others in a friendly, non-judgmental way?
We can be living testimonials to a simpler, more God-pleasing life.

 

Other June holidays include on the Third Sunday- Father &apos; s Day ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 158-164; To Celebrate , pp.
116-122)

 

Planning Alternative Christmas Events

26-Many churches and groups organize Alternative Christmas events in the
fall. Alternatives&apos; How to Organize an Alternative Christmas Community
Festival (also in To Celebrate , pp. 44-46) and Planning an
Alternative Christmas Workshop might help. The three basic plans can
be used singly or combined.

#1. Offer information about worthwhile organizations and encourage people
to give a monetary gift in someone else&apos;s name. Most people consider it an
honor to receive a&quot;gift&quot;that makes a difference. 
Contact Alternative Gifts International (800/842-2243 or AltGifts.org)

27-#2. Sell to or give to others crafts and clothing from artisans of non-industrial countries. 
Your family and friends get beautiful gifts at reasonable prices. 
Third World artisans get a fair price for their work since volunteer fairs and shops 
dont take a large share. Contact: A Greater Gift (AGreaterGift.org, formerly SERRV International;
 Ten Thousand Villages (TenThousandVillages.com); Friends of the Third World 
 (FriendsOfTheThirdWorld.org) and Sharing the Dream (SharingTheDream.org).

28-#3. Organize an Alternative Christmas Workshop at your church. Several
churches might work together. Go beyond gift-giving to the purpose of celebrating
Christmas. Give people other ways to celebrate. Alternatives has support
materials like Unplug the Christmas Machine and Leader &apos; s
Guide to Unplug the Christmas Machine Workshop. (See December.)

29-To shop by mail for Third World Crafts, contact those on June 27th 
and read The Conscious Consumer: Promoting Economic Justice Through Fair Trade
from Fair Trade Resource Network through Alternatives. 
Also see Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 285-286; To Celebrate , pp.,
219-223.

30-Heifer Project International (Heifer.org) provides livestock and training
to needy families in 100+ countries. Their Gift Catalog offers clothing and
crafts. Their World Ark receives gifts in others&apos; names.

Money&amp;Goods

Green Business

1-Meditate on the many kinds of abundance in life.&quot;I came that they may
have life, and have it abundantly.&quot;-from John 10:7-18.&quot;The pastures of the
wilderness overflow, the hills gird themselves with joy.&quot;-from Psalm 65.&quot;the mountains and the hills before you shall burst forth into song.&quot;-from
Isaiah 55:6-13

2-A Green Business is a company that strives to make a profit while making
the Earth and its people a top priority. It takes responsibility for the
short- and long-term effects of its products. It may have a Code of Ethics
like the Ceres Principles.

3-One of the best sources for information about Green Business is Co-op
America&apos;s National Green Pages : A Directory of Products and Services
for People and the Planet. Discover thousands of socially and environmentally
responsible businesses. Find hundreds of tips to save you money, improve
your life and protect the planet. Meet the green businesses that are rewriting
the rules of commerce... and succeeding. Call 800/58-GREEN or visit CoopAmerica.org. 
A Co-op America membership includes a very worthwhile journal.

4- Independence Day ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 170-172; To Celebrate , pp. 133-136). Immigrants? Refugees? Illegal aliens?
Celebrate the Fouth by welcoming strangers.

5-Are garage sales a good thing? Signs of frugality? Promoting reusing? Sharing
good stuff with folks who can&apos;t afford new stuff? A good fund-raiser for
worthwhile groups? What is the intent? To simplify our lives or just to clear
out a bunch of stuff we&apos;re tired of so we can load up on what&apos;s new and exciting?

6-Is it better to buy in quantity at warehouse markets for economic stewardship,
or to support the local small business? Yes. We wrestle. Living more simply
is not simple.

7-Worth investigating - The E. F. Schumacher Society (SchumacherSociety.org) promotes
the ideas of Schumacher&apos;s classic Small Is Beautiful: Economics As If
People Mattered and implements those ideas in practical programs that
link economics, ecology and culture.

8-&quot;One&apos;s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.&quot;-from Luke
12:13-34. What do I own that is not necessary for the activities I find most
meaningful? What would I do with my free time if I only had to spend half
as much time working? (from Trek )

Green Investing

 

9-When investing, be aware that some mutual fund companies, families of mutual
funds, insurance companies and other investment companies have&quot;green&quot;funds,&quot;socially responsible funds&quot;or at least&quot;social screens.&quot;These screens
are criteria that companies must meet before the investing company will invest.

 

10-The most common screens are no tobacco, alcohol or armaments. Other screens
deal with hiring practices, employee conditions, etc. Some companies announce
their screens to attract investors. Other companies keep their screens quiet
not to scare investors away.

11-Many people feel that the only thing that matters is the financial return,
not their consciences. They fear that such screens will mean lower returns.
The irony is that companies with screens have been keeping up with and in
some cases out-performing those that have none! Socially responsible investing
may also be profitable.

12-The number of green funds and families of funds is increasing. Some of
the oldest and best known are Pax, Calvert, Working Assets and Parnassus.
You can deal with these funds directly.

13-One of the best sources for information on green investing is Greenmoney
Journal : Socially&amp;Environmentally Responsible Business, Investing
and Consumer Resources (GreenMoneyJournal.com), available through Alternatives.

14-More resources - The Clean Yield : Principles and Profits Working
Together (CleanYield.com); NCFE (National Center for Financial Education, NCFE.org); 
and The Pocket Change Investor from Good Advice Press (available free online at http://www.goodadvicepress.com/pci.htm)..

15-To pay less income tax, keep your taxable income as low as possible and
give away as much as possible. Some taxes can be sheltered or delayed. The
income is not claimed until retirement when, supposedly, your income (and
tax bracket) is lower.

16-Saving for retirement? Security is more than money. In old age, friends,
family and faith provide comfort. Network now! Put relationships in your
account, not just funds.

 

Green Products

 

17-The tenth commandment is against covetousness, the inner lust to have,
which leads to stealing and oppression. Might the 11th Commandment be: Thou
Shalt Not Tempt Thy Neighbor. What can we do to discourage coveting, such
as not buying, wearing or displaying expensive things?

18-Seventh Generation: Products for a Healthy Planet (SeventhGeneration.com, 800/456-1177) is based
on the Great Law of the Iroquois Confederacy,&quot;In our every deliberation,
we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.&quot;

19-The X Generation, the 13th Generation, may be the first generation in
America&apos;s history not to have more prosperity than the preceding generation.
X&apos;ers may not have the disposable income to buy and consume and... Maybe
they&apos;re lucky! Maybe they won&apos;t have all the temptations that recent generations
have had... the peer pressure to be the best, to spend the most, to conquer
the world. (Continued)

20-This seems to be a generation ripe for Voluntary Simplicity. The less
they spend, the less they have to make. And THEY&apos;RE STILL OK! They&apos;re no
less important than the spendthrifts who preceded us. In fact, they have
an even greater chance to do something really important because they won&apos;t
be burdened with all that stuff. They have great prospects... and hopefully
less baggage.

21-Simple Living Network sponsors a huge range of resources 
as well as communities and books at SimpleLiving.net.

22-Beware of collections. The appeal, the&quot;beauty&quot;of collections is that
we pay for the items but never use them. Collecting is an additional source
of income for manufacturers. Collectors bought over $30 million of the Elvis
Stamp from Post Office Philatelic stores for collections, not to deliver
mail. (Continued)

23-Collectors hope that an item&apos;s value will increase in the future. It may...
to other collectors! As long as we perpetuate the myth that rarity gives
worth, collectors are safe. Baseball cards, comic books... without the need
to possess, even if the item has virtually no intrinsic value, the system
falls. Collecting gives false security... financial and psychological.

24-Non-conforming freely may happen both privately and publicly. Consider
some non-mainstream media. Investigate Simple Living YES : A Journal of Positive
Futures, Center for a New American Dream, 
or other publications offered by Alternatives at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; eStore &gt;&gt; Misc &gt;&gt; Magazines. .

 

Personal Finance, Credit&amp;Debt

 

25-Use credit cards wisely. Have only one. Use it only for purchases that
you can pay off at the end of the month. Then do it! Be aware that credit
cards vary in annual fees, monthly interest, late charges. Preferably, use
a debit card, which takes money from your account.

26- For long term debt, such as a home mortgage or car purchase, consider
your options. The first is always&quot;don&apos;t go into debt.&quot;Find a simpler house,
a simpler car. Consider borrowing from relatives or from yourself (such as
cash value in a life insurance policy). Never use a credit card.

27-Avoid credit card cash advances. They have no grace period. Interest begins
accruing immediately. Credit card&quot;checks&quot;are a form of the dreaded
cash
advance.

28-Beware of credit card promotions! One huge credit card processor proclaims&quot;Simplify your life in the New Year!... Consolidate your holiday bills...
It&apos;s definitely time for a break - from high interest, from holiday bills,
from seasonal stress - from the everyday. Get the break you deserve.... With
fewer bills to pay, you could end up with extra time and money on hand each
month.&quot;Except for short-term&quot;promotional rates,&quot;their typical account
pays over 17% interest. Then came a notice that, among other increases, the
late payment fee increased from $10 to $20!

29 - Debt is the companion - the Enforcer - of the addiction of overconsumption.
Debt is a monster, a mobster that would control your life! Avoid debt by
controlling consumption.

30-Saving for kids&apos; college education? Spend time with them now, help them
develop. Then don&apos;t pressure them to be a part of a&quot;get-ahead&quot;system that
may leave them stressed out and in debt.

31- Consider barter, community loans, exchanging services and goods, prepaying
your mortgage to free up cash, and even alternative currencies like that
in Ithaca, NY.

Personal Choices, Happiness, Fulfillment

 

Work, Stress&amp;Health

 

1-Several paths lead to Voluntary Simplicity. In secular&quot;downshifting&quot;one
may take a different job with a smaller income and less stress. Then move
into a smaller house in a rural area, grow some vegetables, gain control
of credit cards and pay off debts. That&apos;s downshifting to increase personal
happiness.

2-Christians try to live more simply for some of the same reasons. But there&apos;s
more... to be in touch with God and to help others. Simplicity is a lifestyle
of integrity, living as a disciple of Jesus, walking our talk.

3-&quot;Be still and know that I am God!&quot;-Psalm 46:10. Take a few minutes each
day for meditation and prayer, with or without devotional material. Be silent,
be still, be open to what God may be telling you.

4-Here&apos;s something so many can agree on! So many issues keep people apart.
Here at Alternatives we hear from many different people - all excited, or
relieved, or cautious but interested - that there really is a group working
on the over commercialization of Christmas. Thank you to all the editors
of magazines and so many others who have helped us get out the good news
of Simple Living! Encourage your editor to run an article about Alternatives.
We&apos;ll supply the story.

Gifts of Peace Packet.

7-Let&apos;s listen to our bodies and minds. Don&apos;t ignore mental, physical or
spiritual symptoms. Pain means something. Years of stress may be stored up
before symptoms appear. And then WHAM! Reduce stress by exercise and
verbalization of feelings. Physical activity alone is not enough. Speak out
loud, even if to yourself, while exercising.

8-Working ten hour days and feeling really productive? Or feeling accused
or&quot;not good enough&quot;? It&apos;s all stress. The body doesn&apos;t distinguish between&quot;positive&quot;and&quot;negative&quot;stress. We can&apos;t eliminate stress. We can moderate
it. Learn the basic techniques of massage. Find a partner who can give a
decent back rub.

 

Support

 

9-Living more simply can be lonely. Others in our families, in our church,
in our social circle may think we&apos;re weird. Find another Simple Liver. Maybe
start a support group or study circle. Alternatives has guidelines and
recommendations of several excellent study guides.

10-Alternatives is working to connect Simple Livers for support... by mail,
phone, e-mail, face-to-face through the Simpler Living Community Network. 
Visit SimplerLiving.org &gt;&gt; Volunteers.

11-There&apos;s a great hunger for help with simplifying. Contact Alternatives
if you could speak about Voluntary Simplicity or if your group wants a
presentation or display. Check out the emphasis of your Denominational Women&apos;s
Organization. Invite us to speak locally, regionally or nationally.

12-For information on living in community with others, consider Communities
Journal at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; eStore &gt;&gt; Misc &gt;&gt; Magazines.

13-7 Golden Rules for Good Health - 1. Eat breakfast. 2. Eat nutritious snacks
moderately or not at all. 3. Get seven to eight hours of sleep per day regularly.
4. Maintain ideal weight. 5. Exercise aerobically at least three times per
week. 6. Use alcohol in moderation or not at all. 7. Don&apos;t smoke.

14-Simplify-organize-delegate - in that order! -from Simply Organized .

15-&quot;Time is NOT money&quot;- Doris Janzen Longacre. Many programs about time
management and organizing our lives urge us to get the most out of every
minute. Why? Who&apos;s telling us that we must continually strive to do more,
work faster, get better organized, be the best? Those&quot;values&quot;drive us to
be&quot;successes,&quot;to make lots of money, regardless of the effect on family
and Creation. Christian discipleship calls us to make good use of God&apos;s gifts,
to be stewards of Creation, to put relationships above buying, maintaining
and protecting more stuff.

16-We may need to be better organized and to make better use of our time
to benefit others and ourselves. But why? If it&apos;s to acquire and consume
more things, it&apos;s bound to be disappointing. Meaning comes from relationships
with God and other people, not from stuff.

Transportation&amp;Travel

 

17-Many organizations offer educational tours to learn first hand about economic
and social conditions in developing countries. Contact your denomination&apos;s
office of Global Mission or the Center for Global Education at http://www.augsburg.edu/global/.

18-Practice&quot;Eco-Tourism.&quot;Take the Earth, the ecology, into account when
traveling... the people, plants, animals, terrain, air and water. Step out
of the&quot;bubble&quot;that most Americans travel in. Shed expectations about food,
language, etc. Investigate TransitionsAbroad.com : The Guide to Learning, 
Living and Working Overseas.

21-A Creation Awareness Center is your church building, grounds, programs
and people. A church that becomes a Creation Awareness Center makes
the celebration and care of the Earth a dimension of its total ministry! Visit WebOfCreation.org.

22-Care of the Earth is highlighted in worship. Adult and Sunday School classes
are offered on environmental issues. Members are encourage to reduce, reuse,
recycle and restore. Area environmental concerns are discussed and acted
upon. Church building and grounds are kept up to reflect energy efficiency
and environmental concern. And, in many other ways, church members are encouraged
and empowered to act as caretakers of God&apos;s Earth in the church, their homes,
the community and the world.

23-Your congregation becomes a Creation Awareness Center by: A. Assessing
your church&apos;s current involvement in earthkeeping, B. Sending interested
representatives to meetings to explore with resource persons and with each
other about how we can make this vision come true, C. Creating a priority
in church for celebrating God&apos;s ongoing creation, and for making environmental
concerns an important part of our ministry, D. Working on areas within the
church building and the life of the congregation that need improvement, E.
Reviewing the environmental assessment again to measure progress and to point
up needs.

24-When planning a public event - a worship service, a concert, a meeting,
a convention - follow environmental guidelines so that your event is a witness
to care of Creation.

Homes&amp;Buildings: Construction, Energy Generating, Appliances

 

25-When some folks retire, they build a new, larger house,&quot;just in case
the kids come to visit.&quot;When others retire it&apos;s to show the world what status
they have achieved during their working years. Ask,&quot;How much space can we
justify taking up now that we&apos;re alone?&quot;Then downsize! Isn&apos;t it cheaper
and MORE JUST to pay for motel rooms when the kids come than to maintain
a palace for those few visits?

Media Literacy

 

1-Most of us know so little about something so powerful and pervasive in
our lives: the media. We&apos;re familiar with print media (magazines and newspapers),
electronic media (television, radio, cable and the internet) and other media
(telephone, billboards, direct mail). But do we recognize its effect in our
lives, our families, our society, our world?

2-We think of media as ways to receive information or entertainment. But
the powers of commercialism see the media first and foremost as ways of
delivering customers to advertisers. Through those eyes many other common
items become media - anything that can carry a logo, a name - clothes, buses,
sports stadiums. An average American sees 16,000 commercial impressions per
day!

3-Media Literacy is an attempt to educate people about the power and techniques
of the media. It includes the effects of advertising on our desires and the
impact of violence on our behavior.

4-Media Literacy is directly connected to Simple Living. True meaning and
fun in life come from relationships with self, friends, family and God. Stuff
is a burden, a barrier, that prevents us from cultivating those relationships.

Advertising is largely a powerful and devious obstacle to living more simply.
Advertising tries to create needs in us that we don&apos;t have. To get us to
buy things we really don&apos;t need... stuff that gets in our way of finding
real meaning and happiness in life, stuff that uses our time, money and energy
but gives little in return except the desire for more.

5-For helpful resources about the media, such as We Know What You Want, visit SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; eStore &gt;&gt; Social Justice &gt;&gt; Media. 
Learn about Turn Off TV Week at TVTurnOff.org.

September holidays include: First Monday- Labor Day ( Treasury of
Celebrations , p. 176; To Celebrate , p. 143).

 

Advertising&amp;Public Relations

 

9-Advertising can give us information to meet our basic needs... food, shelter,
etc. Objectionable ads create false expectations and needs that are really
wants or desires. Are we really better people because of the beverage we
drink? Will we be sexier if we buy a certain kind of car? Will we be more
popular or successful if we wear certain kinds of clothes or perfume?

10-When watching TV, ZAP the commercials (mute the sound). No need to be
assaulted by aggressive car and soda pop commercials. Some consider ads&quot;the
price of admission.&quot;That&apos;s exactly what advertisers want you to think. The
air waves belong to the people. We owe advertisers nothing!

11-Avoid wearing commercial logos which attempt to convey status and promote
overconsumption. Only wear messages that convey values that you truly believe
in. Fingernail scissors will cut embroidered logos off of sweaters.

12-If a national magazine carries an article that criticizes the tobacco
industry or questions smoking, one large tobacco company that also owns food
companies will pull its FOOD ads from the magazine.

13-Some advertisers are trying to capitalize on our desire for simpler lives.
An expensive luxury car is hyped with a picture of the shiny vehicle and
the word&quot;Simplify.&quot;A national restaurant chain uses the slogan&quot;Simplify
your life. Eat out more.&quot;The Masters of Doublespeak!

14-In the name of&quot;research,&quot;some advertisers - without our permission or
even our knowledge - place cameras in grocery stores to photograph our eyes
as we shop. When we look at cereal, for example, a camera record our reaction
to various boxes and even measures the length of time we focus on each box.
This&quot;research&quot;helps advertisers decide what sells.

15-Are you a&quot;news junkie?&quot;Most commercial news broadcasts and talk shows
stress the sensational. Too much stimulation from them can develop cynicism,
even paranoia. Yes, we need to be informed, to protect ourselves. But moderate
the input from commercial broadcasts and consider the alternative press,
including public radio and TV. Giving up something for Lent? Give up some
media input... news and entertainment (wherever the line between them may
be)... a-news-ment?

16-The Media Foundation (800/663-1243 or Adbusters.org) sponsors Buy Nothing Day and publishes 
the irreverent magazine Adbusters: Journal of the Mental Environment. 
The Center for Media and Democracy (PRWatch.org) publishes PR Watch: Public Interest Reporting on the PR/Public Affairs Industry.

 

Alternatives to TV, Video Games, Movies, Gambling

 

17-Is there any difference between watching a concert by the Three Tenors
or a game at the Three Rivers stadium? Professional sports, movies and the
fine arts may be on different spots on the entertainment continuum, but they&apos;re
on the same line, as long as there&apos;s a passive audience. A Beethoven symphony
is engaging to some. So is a hard fought hockey game. And they may represent
the same thing... struggle between good and evil. Let&apos;s support the Arts
by DOING the ARTS ... drawing, writing, dancing, reading aloud. If we feel
incompetent, let&apos;s take a class. (Continued)

18-Amateurs and professionals are on a continuum too. The difference is not
between&quot;good&quot;and&quot;bad&quot;art and entertainment but between passivity and
involvement. Passive entertainment makes money for somebody else, so it&apos;s
promoted. Active entertainment takes no more time but takes our energy.&quot;The
system&quot;is designed primarily to keep us passive, to let professionals do
the work while we pay them outrageous salaries. Non-conform freely. Reduce
passive entertainment; increase active arts.

19- Play non-competitive, communications games with your family, such as Everyone Wins: Cooperative Games and Activities. See January 21 for story telling games.

20-Alternatives can help equip you to present children with alternatives
to TV, to be prepared for weekly family fun time, to help develop your child&apos;s
social conscience, to help develop your child&apos;s spirituality and interpersonal
skills.

23-&quot;But seek first God&apos;s kingdom and God&apos;s righteousness and all these thing
will be given to you as well.&quot;-Matthew 6:33.

24- If you find gambling&quot;fun,&quot;set a limit of what you would normally spend
for an evening&apos;s entertainment. If you&apos;re given free chips as an incentive,
spend them (and any winnings) and no more. The addiction of gambling is no&quot;better&quot;than any other addiction, legal or illegal.

 

Marketing

 

25-Most marketing tries to create constant dissatisfaction and personal
inadequacy. We need one more thing - THIS thing - to be happy. Ooops. Didn&apos;t
work? Then try this.&quot;A satisfied customer is not.&quot;(from Fool&apos;s Gold )

 

26-Beware of Spin. The purpose of public relations is to interpret events
in the best interest of the client (a company, group or government) that
the firm represents... not necessarily the public&apos;s best interest.&quot;Spin
doctors&quot;are generally public relations people who&quot;put a spin&quot;on an event,
to get the public to see the event in their client&apos;s best interest. We can&apos;t
avoid all spin, all interpretation. Be aware of their purpose. Then beware.

 

27-Some pet food is marketed not for the benefit of the pet but for the&quot;tastes&quot;of the owner. Beware of owner-driven pet food advertising. If you have a
pet, consult with a veterinarian or a pet store owner you really trust.

 

28-Help prevent pet overpopulation. If you join your local ASPCA, make your
membership specifically for the spaying and neutering of pets.

Take care of your pet if you have one. Pets are not people. They are God&apos;s
Creatures too. But with people starving around the world it&apos;s no better to
be lavish with pets than with ourselves. Everybody needs to live more simply,
including our pets!

 

29-Petition your governmental representatives to make advertising a
non-deductible business expense.

Sustenance

 

Food

 

1-Reflect on Luke 12:22-32 or Matthew 6:25-33. Don&apos;t worry about what you&apos;ll
eat or what you&apos;ll wear. That sounds like encouragement to live more simply.

2-Learn about the power of&quot;cheap food.&quot;Resist using foods that deprive
other countries of food and have little or no nutritional value, such as
coffee. Caffeine is an addictive drug. Other beverages, like fruit juice,
can be just as socially inviting.

3-Reduce your consumption of red meat by 10%. It takes many gallons of water
and many pounds of grain to make one pound of beef for our table.

4-Vertical integration of food is the process in which the most powerful
resource becomes monopolized. The people who sell the food also control
distribution, processing plants and production. We can vote against it with
our dollars by shopping at Farmers Markets, by supporting community-based
agriculture, by refusing to buy out-of-season fruits and vegetables.

5-Consider fasting one regular meal time or one day per week. Use the discomfort
to deepen awareness of poverty. Offer the savings to the poor.

6-Help supply soup kitchens by gleaning unsold produce from grocery stores. 
Find out if you have a local Food Bank. Visit SecondHarvest.org: The Nation&apos;s Food Bank Network. 
Who do they help? Can you help too?

7-What&quot;bottom line&quot;do I use to decide what something is worth? Do I eat
my food slowly and reflectively, or do I most often eat on the run? How could
I buy more of my food from farmers in my area? (from Trek )

8-Food Co-ops like Blooming Prairie provide nutritious food. If you don&apos;t
have a retail store in your area, you may have a buying co-op which takes
orders once a month and delivers the following week. Be cautious of some&quot;health food stores.&quot;

For more information read Living More with Less , pp. 245-268 (Eating
Together).

 

Recipes (from Developing Countries)&amp;Food Preparation

 

9-Cook with the World Community. Investigate recipes from other countries,
especially developing countries. Obtain at least one alternative cookbook, 
such as the Mennonites World Community Cookbook series: More-with-Less Cookbook; 
Extending the Table; the more recent ones Simply in Season and Simply in Season for Children. 

10-Vegetarians come in several flavors: those who eat no red meat; those
who eat no meat; and Vegans, who eat no animal products (no milk, no eggs).
Contact The Vegetarian Resource Group: Vegetarian Journal at vrg.org, 
or EarthSave.org: Personal Food Choices Global Results.).

11-Reduce processed food by at least 10% at each meal. Cooking&quot;from scratch&quot;takes more planning and time but is more nutritious and fun when done together.
Make menu planning and shopping a social event, instead of a chore.

12-Serve and take only what you and your household can eat. Go back for seconds
if you&apos;re still hungry. Focus on flavor, not quantity. Try to throw nothing
away. Develop clever ways of using left overs. Proudly eat chicken backs!

13-Research indicates that a typical in-home American father has only three
minutes a day of direct conversation with his child. Also, an American couple
that are still married only have five minutes a day of meaningful verbal
exchange.

14-We can learn more about community by doing meal preparation and clean-up
together. Vow to eat at least one meal a day together. Often we allow the
school, the community, the TV, even the church to take away our common meal.

15-We Americans now eat a great deal of expensive convenience food - at home
or in restaurants. Many of its nutrients are processed out. We work more
hours so we can afford more expensive food that&apos;s fast so that we can work
more to buy more expensive, hollow, highly processed food. Can we find ways
to stop the cycle?

Sustainable Agriculture, Organic Farming

 

17-Shop at Farmer&apos;s Markets. Eat mostly fruits and vegetables that are in
season in your area. Most Americans are far removed from the source of their
food and from the people who grow it. Our food travels an average of 1300
miles to reach our tables.

18- Children &apos; s Sabbath . Children&apos;s Defense Fund (ChildrensDefense.org) 
publishes CDF Reports and sponsors Children&apos;s Sabbath. Take a stand
for children in worship services, educational activities, community service
and advocacy efforts.

19-Top 10 reasons to buy organic: 1. Protect future generations, 2. Prevent
soil erosion, 3. Protect water quality, 4. Save energy, 5. Keep chemicals
off your plate, 6. Protect farm worker health, 7. Help small farmers, 8.
Support a true economy, 9. Promote biodiversity, 10. Taste better flavor.

20-We are endangered by the pesticides that have been banned in this country
but exported to and used in poor countries. Write a letter to a government
official protesting the dumping of toxic chemicals in Third World markets.

21-Investigate sustainable agriculture and sustainable economic development.

22-Biodiversity protects our food supply. Famines can result from monocultures. 
Extinction is forever. Contact SeedsOfChange.com: Organically Grown Seed (888/762-7333) 
and Seed Savers Exchange at SeedSavers.org.

23-Landmines make farming a very dangerous business in many parts of the
world, particularly Southeast Asia. Petition the federal government to work
for the elimination of the use of landmines that cripple, maim and kill
civilians.

Gardening

 

25-Worth Reading: To Till It and Keep It : New Models for Congregational
Involvement with the Land (715/294-2831). The primary goal of Permaculture
Activist (POB 1209, Black Mountain, NC 28711) is to provide information
useful to people actively working to establish permaculture systems&quot;on the
ground.&quot;

26-A weed is called&quot;a plant out of place.&quot;A weed is in the eye of the beholder.

27-Organic gardening involves the use of natural herbicides and pesticides.
Composting vegetation from the garden and the kitchen (no meat!) builds up
the soil. Low maintenance composters work slowly. Adding worms and natural
enzymes speeds up the process.

28-Gardening in an urban environment can be accomplished successfully in
the total absence of land. Create rooftop gardens, especially on office
buildings. Usually there&apos;s plenty of space, plenty of sun and access to water.

29- Subscription farming is a cooperative effort between a farmer and a group
of subscribers. The subscribers put up the capital for the crop and help
in the busy season. In return they get their share of the crop each week
during harvest.

30-&quot;Where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.&quot;-from Matthew
6:19-21. Do my gadgets make me more or less fully human? What makes something
designed to help me cross the line into weighing me down? (from Trek )

More Celebrating

 

1- Let &apos; s Talk About Christmas ! How are we going
to celebrate Christmas this year? What is really most meaningful? Who&apos;s going
to do what? Are we willing to spend less on ourselves and give more to the
truly needy? Ask your family, relatives, friends questions like these. Write
down your decisions and post them.

2-For help, see Alternatives&apos; Fall/Holidays Resource Guide and the&quot;Let&apos;s
Talk About Christmas!&quot;Worksheet. Consider using Alternatives&apos; most widely
read resource, the booklet Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? Current and
past editions are available. Remember International Buy Nothing Day (adbusters.org).
Yes, it&apos;s the day after Thanksgiving!

3-Simplicity is a disciplined life - disciplined, not punished or deprived
or joyless. We are given great freedom to care about all of God&apos;s Creation,
rather than nurturing the perversions and idols that our society has created
and worships - our&quot;stuff.&quot;Stuff exists to meet our needs. But if we spend
our time, energy and money nurturing it instead of our relationships with
God, others and ourselves, it will own us, control us and ultimately destroy
us and the Earth.

4- The Jesse Tree - Many meaningful symbols help us focus on preparations
for Christmas during Advent... the Advent wreath, Chrismons, and the Christmas
tree. When so many commercial symbols try to distract us from the real meaning
of the season, the Jesse Tree is a lesser known but also powerful, visual
focal point. (Continued)

5-At the beginning of Advent (no later than four weeks prior to Christmas)
cut a branch from a lilac or forsythia just above a bud and place it in a
vase filled with water. Make the cut clean and at an angle. A vase filled
with clear glass beads and water will provide support for the Jesse Tree.
Maintain a water level above the cut and the Jesse Tree will blossom by
Christmas. Lilacs, regardless of their blossom color, will bloom white when
forced this way. (Continued)

6-Isaiah foretells the end of the Assyrian rule over Jerusalem as God&quot;hack(ing)
down the thickets of a forest with an ax,&quot;razing it to stumps. The Israelites
- David&apos;s line - had been so razed. Then comes the promise in Isaiah 11:
1-2, from which the Jesse Tree gets its name -&quot; A shoot shall come out
from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. &quot; And from that line will come the Messiah... a new branch from a stump...
a branch stronger and more fruitful than the original tree. (Continued)

7-The Jesse Tree is beautiful by itself. But it can also hold ornaments,
symbols of the season of Advent, the season of waiting... a scroll to remember
the prophecies... a dove to remind us of the peace that comes with Messiah...
a crown for David&apos;s son, Solomon... a rose with twelve petals, one for each
of Jesse&apos;s sons from whom sprang the twelve tribes of Israel. (Continued)

8-As we hang the ornaments - usually one per day - we tell the related story.
The prophecies come to life with the appearance of blooms - new life from
an old branch - as they did with the birth of Jesus Christ. For more information
about possible designs of the ornaments, contact your public or church library.

 

Preparations

 

9-For our widowed fathers who live far away we produce a simple video Christmas
card. While our children are home for Thanksgiving, we take an hour and put
together a 20 minute greeting on tape. We use parts of Whose Birthday
Is It, Anyway? We sing some carols. We avoid anything showy. (Continued)

10-For a video Christmas card, we try to model the things that are important
to us, things we really do and believe in - like delivering poinsettias as
a fund-raiser for the Battered Women&apos;s Shelter - not things we want others
to think we do and believe. The sound isn&apos;t professional, the production&apos;s
not slick - no editing, no special effects - but it&apos;s us! It is relatively
easy and a lot of fun. Everybody gets their say, though not everybody gets
their way.

11- Veterans &apos; Day 

12-View and discuss Alternatives&apos; video Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas .

13-&quot;We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish. . all ate and were
filled.&quot;-from Matthew 14:13-21. Do I miss the chance to do what I can because
I can&apos;t do it all? (from Trek )

14-For your church or group consider using Alternatives&apos; Guidelines for
Alternative Giving; Models for Prayer and Worship; Resource Packets; Bulletin
Inserts&amp;Posters; graded Activity Guides; and adult Discussion&amp;Activity Guides (such as&quot;What Makes a Perfect Christmas?&quot;&quot;The Gift of Giving,&quot;&quot;What About Santa?&quot;&quot;Christmas Traditions That Work for You,&quot;&quot;Looking Behind
the Cost of Christmas,&quot;and&quot;What Is a Gift?&quot;).

15-ChurchWorldService.org distributes the exceptionally attractive Global Calendar 
and greeting cards of color pictures of people from around the Earth.

16-Start saving Sunday comics to use for wrapping paper for gifts. Recycle
Christmas cards by cutting at the fold. Write a personal message on the back
and use as a post card. Save envelopes.

 

For more information read To Celebrate , pp. 27-86.

 

Unplug the Christmas Machine

 

17- The Christmas Pledge 

Believing in the true spirit of Christmas, I commit myself to:

Remember those people who truly need my gifts

Express my love in more direct ways than gifts

Examine my holiday activities in the light of my deepest values

Be a peacemaker within my circle of family and friends

Rededicate myself to my spiritual growth

18-Make a Plan. Set small and specific goals. Want to minimize Christmas
preparations? To feel more relaxed this holiday season? To spend more relaxed
time with the children this Christmas? Want to give less commercial gifts?
(Continued)

19-Look at your goals and think of one, two or three activities that will
help you accomplish them. Unless you are assured of other people&apos;s cooperation,
it&apos;s best to focus on activities that you can do by yourself. (Continued)

20-Next describe these activities in simple written sentences - what you
are going to do and when it should be done, for example: Goal: I want to simplify my gift giving. Activity 1 : I will write letters
to Aunt Carol and Aunt Rebecca suggesting that we give gifts only to the
children and mail those letters by October 1. (Continued)

21-Share your plan with your family. Choose your time carefully. Wait until
they are in a relaxed and accepting frame of mind. Be nonthreatening. Unless
the other family members have done a lot of thinking about Christmas, introduce
the topic gently. Take the time to explain your reasons for wanting to make
changes. Once they know your sincere motives, they are likely to be more
supportive. Finally, talk to others as soon as possible. Many like to plan
for Christmas early.

22-Brainstorming is fun! It requires withholding judgment on any idea, letting
ideas come out from other ideas. Linear thinkers may be more goal oriented
and circular thinkers may be more creative. Both are necessary. A balance
of both is optimal.

23- A Birthday Gift for Jesus - When we celebrate a birthday,
we are careful to give what the person really wants or needs. Is there any
doubt what Jesus wants from us? He insists that in order to give to him,
we must find him in the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the
sick and the imprisoned. By helping to provide a goat for a farmer in Honduras,
a decent home for a family in rural Mississippi, or food for those who are
victims of war, we can give Jesus a birthday gift he really wants. Contact
organizations listed in Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? for more information
on how to give money, time and skills to those in need.

24-Read and discuss Isaiah 58 as part of your preparation for observing
Thanksgiving.

November holidays include: Fourth Thursday- Thanksgiving Day ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 178-188; To Celebrate , pp.
155-160; Alternatives&apos;&quot;Fasting with Thanksgiving&quot;bulletin insert); Friday
after Thanksgiving- Buy Nothing Day 

 

Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway?

 

25-Use Alternative&apos; Cost Analysis Form , to estimate how much you spent
on each item last Christmas. Then total it. This is private. Don&apos;t feel guilty
about how much you spent or proud about how little. Decide what percentage
of that amount your family is willing to give to truly needy people this
year. We recommend 25%. You may decide on 10% or 50%. (Continued)

26-Now we may feel we have just as many things to buy and people to buy for,
but with less money. We have several options. We can drop some folks or
activities from the list. We can buy less expensive items. We can draw names
instead of everyone giving something to everyone else. Or we can practice
Alternative Giving. That&apos;s done in various ways. The first is deciding how
much of last year&apos;s budget to give away and to whom.

27-Say to yourself, out loud while looking in a mirror.&quot;I&apos;m OK. I&apos;m enough.
I don&apos;t have to prove how good or strong I am by using my purchase power.
I don&apos;t need to own or show-off my stuff to be accepted or loved. I&apos;m forgiven
for my past waste and extravagance.&quot;

28-Simplicity is the greatest peace making tool we have in the war between
the have&apos;s and the have-not&apos;s.

30-Surprise is a key element of gift giving. To avoid bad surprises, do not
rely on mind reading. Instead, help your family members and friends select
appropriate gifts - and also reveal some fascinating personal preferences.
Ask each person in your gift exchange circle to fill out the questionnaire
from Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? 1996 
at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; Services &gt;&gt; Archives &gt;&gt; Whose Birthday &gt;&gt; 1996.(Continued)

31-Voluntary simplicity is not Scroogism . Gift giving IS appropriate,
especially if it is not just habitual, not based on catalogue shopping and
mall hopping. Add meaning to your giving by giving appropriate gifts... gifts
based on information about the recipient, not what interests the giver or
what the giver would like to receive.

 December 

Responsible Celebrating

Advent

 

1-Begin using Alternatives&apos; Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? Use the calendar of your choice every day, the Biblical reflections each week 
and the services and other activities as appropriate. 
Back issues come on paper, CD-ROM, audio CD, and at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; Services &gt;&gt; Archives &gt;&gt; Whose Birthday.

 

Ten Tips for a Simpler, More Meaningful Christmas

 

2-Tip #1. Plan ahead. Instead of going on auto-pilot the day after Thanksgiving,
hold a family meeting to decide what the group really wants to do and who&apos;s
going to do what. Use Alternatives&apos;&quot;Let&apos;s Talk About Christmas!&quot;Worksheet
to guide your discussion.

3-Tip #2. Avoid debt. Refuse to be pressured by advertising to overspend.
Use credit cards wisely. Avoid cash advances. They have no grace period,
interest accumulates immediately.

4-Tip #3. Avoid stress. Give to yourself... a peaceful space, for example.
Don&apos;t assume that things have to be the same way they&apos;ve always been. For
more on stress, see August.

5-Tip #4. Draw names rather than everyone giving something to everyone else
in your giving circle. Set a ceiling for each recipient.

6- St. Nicholas Day ( To Celebrate , pp. 34-40). Tip #5. If you
need a symbol for giving (in addition to Jesus and the Wise Ones), learn
about St. Nicholas. Santa Claus has been completely taken over by commerce.
Read, share, use Alternatives&apos;&quot;St. Nicholas: A Puppet Play&quot;or&quot;A Saint
Nicholas Day Celebration.&quot;

7-Tip #6. Give appropriate gifts. Get to know the recipient. Give what they
want to receive, not what you want to buy. For help, use the&quot;Appropriate
Gift Questionnaire&quot;in Alternatives&apos; Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? 1966
 at SimpleLiving.org &gt;&gt; Services &gt;&gt; Archives &gt;&gt; Whose Birthday.

8- Christmas Is More Than Gifts and Glitter - The effort to celebrate
a simple Christmas is led by a small, ecumenical nonprofit group called
Alternatives. Organized in 1973 to protest the commercialization of Christmas,
Alternatives provides encouragement and support for those who want to celebrate
Jesus&apos; birthday. The group emphasizes relationships and traditions over things,
hoping to avoid stress and debt.

For more information see March and November and read Living More with
Less , Celebrations, 188-208.

Other holidays in December include: First Day of Hanukkah (Jewish
Festival of Lights) ( Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 196-197; To
Celebrate , pp. 161-162); 15th- Festival of the Virgin of Guadalupe ( To Celebrate , p. 162).

 

More Advent

 

9-Tip #7. Give alternative gifts. Give 25% of what you spent last year to
the truly needy... individuals or groups locally, nationally or internationally.
For help, use Alternatives&apos;&quot;Cost Analysis Form.&quot;

10- Human Rights Day. Contact your denomination&apos;s Human Rights Association
and find out what they do.

11-More Tip #7. Buy crafts and clothing from developing countries at alternative
gift markets, not from commercial importers, so that the artisans receive
a fair price for their work. For more, see June.

12-Yet More Tip #7. Give of yourself, not just&quot;stuff&quot;- a coupon book for
future services (such as baby-sitting or an&quot;enchanted evening&quot;) or something
baked, sewn, handmade, composed, etc. For more, read&quot;Gift Giving&quot;in Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 39-56, or To Celebrate , Chapter
3, pp. 49-70.

13-More on Giving of Ourselves... giving something more meaningful than stuff
for the giver and the receiver - giving ourselves, not our money or things
bought with our money, but our time and our special skills. (Continued)

14-Baking, sewing, woodworking, composing poetry or playing music. The point
is not just to find a substitute for a thing-gift at Christmas but to build
and strengthen a relationship that will nurture and be nurtured all year
long. (Continued)

15-Hand-made coupon books for promises of time or services at the convenience
of the receiver, not the giver, are both generous and well received. Coupons
for child care, for a special meal, for lawn mowing... you name it.

16-Tip #8. Give children ONE thing they really want, rather than so many
gifts. If need be, pool funds.

 

Yet More Advent

 

17-Tip #9. Take turns opening the gifts around the tree, so that each gift
can be admired and each giver thanked. To avoid the emphasis on gifts, don&apos;t
put them under the tree until after attending worship service on Christmas
Eve or Christmas Day.

18-When I was a child many of the relatives would gather on Christmas Eve
for a grand meal. Then we would gather around a tree that always reached
to the ceiling. It was surrounded by a mountain of gifts. Everybody gave
something to everybody else. With little fanfare I would start ripping into
all my stuff. It seemed that no one paid much attention to what others were
getting. After an hour or so it was over. (Continued)

19-One year I asked my dad if we could go to church on Christmas Eve. He
agreed. But I didn&apos;t ask until Christmas Eve. When we got back, the others
were pretty unhappy. We had changed the plan. We hadn&apos;t considered the group.
Now, after we all go to church, we gather for some favorite foods. We take
turns opening our gifts with considerable fanfare for each one. Though we
are only four, it is more meaningful than when there were a dozen!

20-Tip #10. Make changes slowly but persistently. Don&apos;t try to change everything
and everybody all at once. The resistance will make you feel defeated and
lonely. For more help, read the classic Unplug the Christmas Machine or
the excerpt&quot;Christmas Revival&quot;in Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? 1966
or&quot;Getting Started&quot;in Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 70-87.

21- First Day of Winter ( To Celebrate , p. 163)

22-We have much better symbols of Christmas and giving than Santa, who has
been completely taken over by commercial interests to sell us more stuff.
We have Jesus giving himself to us and the Three Wise Ones giving gifts to
Jesus. We have St. Nicholas, who gave gifts to the needy. Let&apos;s not confuse
our children with stories about Santa. Let&apos;s tell the real stories of our
faith.

23-One Christmas my mother bought a new plastic Santa to put on the top of
the tree. I didn&apos;t think much of it. When my Dad saw it, he quietly insisted
that it come down. After all, he was Sunday School Superintendent. Mother
replaced Santa with a Christmas star. That incident had a profound effect
on me. As greedy as I was as a youngster, I got the point that we celebrate
Jesus&apos; birth, not the coming of Santa Claus.

24- Share memories and stories besides gifts and food. Play Alternatives&apos;&quot;Christmas Game&quot;in Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? 1977.

 

Christmas

 

25- Christmas Day (birth of Jesus observed). For more information read Treasury of Celebrations , pp. 207-225.

26- First Day of Kwanzaa . For more information read Treasury of
Celebrations , pp. 226; To Celebrate , pp. 163-164.

27-Keep your tree and decorations up until Epiphany, January 6th, when the
Wise Ones arrive with their gifts.

28- Holy Innocents . Read, share, use Alternatives&apos;&quot;Remembering the
Holy Innocents: A Service for December 28th.&quot;

29-There are three levels of working toward justice.

1) Symbolic acts, like giving up a meal, help change us though they do not
alleviate another&apos;s hunger. Education and worship are largely symbolic acts.
Though they don&apos;t make any thing, they feed our spirits and minds. Symbols
are powerful!

30-2) Sharing our resources of time, money and energy are small steps to
alleviate another&apos;s situation.

31-3) Systemic change, which is more complex, requires recognition of a need
for change by communities and governments. It requires conversation, negotiation,
a commitment to cooperation, and constant pressure from caring people.

 About Alternatives 

ALTERNATIVES for Simple Living

 

Alternatives was an interdenominational, non-profit organization that&quot;equips
people of faith to challenge consumerism, live justly, and celebrate
responsibly.&quot;Started in 1973 as a protest against the commercialization
of Christmas, it encourages celebrations year-round that reflect conscientious
ways of living.

Throughout its 38 years, Alternatives has helped lead the movement to live
more simply and faithfully. The many staff members and volunteers of Alternatives
have developed a wide variety of resources, organized an annual Christmas
Campaign, held the Best and Worst Christmas Gift Contest, led numerous workshops,
and reached countless people with the message of simple, responsible living.

Alternatives emphasizes relationships and traditions over things, helping
to avoid stress and debt, and promoting alternative giving - helping the
truly needy instead of spending so much on ourselves.

Alternatives was operated by a small staff which reports to a national Board
of Directors. We are funded by memberships and donations, grants, and sale
of resources. Everyone is welcome to use Alternatives&apos; services, regardless
of their religious beliefs. You need not be a member to order from us, though
membership has numerous benefits.

Resources originally produced by Alternatives on simpler living and related
topics (such as hunger, the environment, media literacy, etc.) for Advent
and Christmas, for Lent and Easter, for weddings and for year-round use -
some in Spanish - for adults and children - are now available for free on this site.

Alternatives&apos; Mission Statement

Equipping people of faith to challenge consumerism, live justly, and celebrate
responsibly.

 

Alternatives&apos; symbolic logo

The circle represents the Earth. The tree and the star answer the question Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway? Alternatives has been pointing people
to Jesus at Christmas time since 1973. The tree and its shadow also form
an arrow, urging us to change directions, to turn away from overconsumption
to alternative, simpler, more people-oriented ways of celebrating and living.
The entire logo is a stylized&quot;A&quot;for Alternatives. The lettering of the
name is simple but strong.
