 Jack In The Box Complaint

 Taco&apos;s 

Review by gorkameister on 2008-09-04 
   

 ST.LOUIS, MISSOURI -- My son is disabled and loves JACK IN THE BOX taco&apos;s. So, between my brother and myself we get him the taco&apos;s whenever he wants them. On 8-4-08 at 2:27pm I purchased his taco&apos;s brought them home and he ate them. The next week was pure HELL! He can&apos;t walk so I still change him. He has just be introduced to FOOD POISONING! The Taco&apos;s made him deathly sick. Now instead of going to see a lawyer and suing them over this I am willing to let them make this right with him. The Phone Number And The Number&apos;s on the receipt are as follows: 314-773-1553 JTB#4027 196349 JAK 01.

If they would like a copy of the receipt I can sure furnish them with that. And I was also wondering if it wasn&apos;t with any of the tainted tomatoes the sauce was made from.

Not sure if you would get away with suing for food poisoning. It is very difficult to prove THAT meal is what caused it.

I got sick lastnight from eating some under-cooked chicken at a Max&amp;Erma&apos;s restaurant. I noticed it looked a little pink, so I pulled those parts off. I should have sent it back.

Later last night I found myself deathly sick... but it passed. If you son is still sick after a few days, it may be something else! I would have him go to a doctor.

Good luck.

Food poisoning symptoms don&apos;t occur a week after consumption, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re saying here. Deep fried tacos...
they should just call them Grease Pockets. 

 Posted by Ghost of Doc J on 2008-09-04 
I agree Sparticus. The child ate the tacos and didn&apos;t get sick until a week later. Nearly all foodborne illness has an onset of symptoms measured in hours, not days. The child could have gotten sick from something prepared in the home or elsewhere. Or, picked up a diarrhea-causing pathogen somewhere else. BTW: The FDA determined the past outbreak was not due to tomatoes...it was jalopenas and fresh chilies imported from Mexico...at last word.

Have you ever opened up a JITB taco and looked at the meat? It&apos;s more like a mystery meat paste than meat. I wonder what they are mixing with the meat to get that. 

 Posted by Ghost of Doc J on 2008-09-04 
You&apos;re being generous, DC. The stuff inside looks more like &apos;diaper scrapings&apos; than any meat I&apos;ve seen.

Soylent Green! 

 Posted by superbowl on 2008-09-04 
Soylent Green was a great Heston flick. Who would have known it was laced with true snap shots of our future. 

 Posted by heaven17 on 2008-09-04 
Just wondering...how exactly did you zero in on these tacos as the source of his illness, especially after an entire week lapsed before he actually got sick?
Did you take him to a doctor (I assume you did since he was &apos;deathly sick&apos;)? 

 Posted by Ghost of Doc J on 2008-09-04 
I see a fast-food remake of Heston&apos;s flick: &quot;Soylent Brown&quot; After discovering a JITB secret installation of porta-potties with piped in Vivalde, the hero runs through the streets shouting...&quot;It&apos;s feces...Soylent Brown, is feces!&quot; 

 Posted by raven2002 on 2008-09-04 
*sigh* I&apos;m sorry the little guy was sick, but there is no way you can prove JITB is the cause. 

 Posted by justcuz3993 on 2008-09-04 
I&apos;m not sure the OP meant her son didn&apos;t get sick until a week later, as she said &quot;The next week was pure HE**,&quot; which could mean that he did get sick soon after eating the tacos and was sick for days.

Still, the fact that you are going to give JITB the opportunity to &apos;make it right with him&apos; vs suing them, doesn&apos;t sit well with me.

First, you don&apos;t mention whether or not you actually took your deathly ill child to the Dr, or what the Dr determined to be the cause of his illness. It&apos;s very hard to pinpoint where exactly food poisoning stemmed from. If you truly felt it was from the tacos, you were obligated to call JITB and let them know, in the event that they did have tainted items that may have caused others to also become ill.

Second, what are you looking for here? Compensation? An apology? What exactly?

Third, why did you see a need to tell us your son is disabled? Does that make a difference somehow? 

 Posted by JohnInSoCal on 2008-09-04 
Deathly sick? How long was your son hospitalized for this illness that caused him to be deathly sick? What did the doctors say? Did you get a medical report from the facility that treated him? (Sorry in advance for this, guys), did the hospital send a stool sample to the lab to be cultured? Did you or a legal representative contact JITB corporate office to see if any others had reported any illnesses due to their product? And, no offense but this could have happened to any child, disabled or not. I believe that your son may have needs that may have caused this illness to be more severe, but all children are a valuable resource and we should be concerned for all, equally. 

 Posted by JohnInSoCal on 2008-09-04 
hahaha justcuz. Get out of my head!! I just saw your post as my post went up. :) 

 Posted by justcuz3993 on 2008-09-04 
LOL John, I was just going to ask if you were peering over my shoulder while I was typing! :) 

 Posted by Ghost of Doc J on 2008-09-04 
Nice catch, justcuz. I also based my response on the fact that almost all foodborn illnesses last less than a day or two. I would be reluctant to allow an illness of the type of severity indicated to go on for a week before seeking medical attention. I think disability was mentioned because the child may not be an infant. Rather, the OP led me to believe it is an older child who is disabled and wears diapers because of incontinence issues. Just IMHO and a guess. 

 Posted by justcuz3993 on 2008-09-04 
Thanks Doc J
I just have this &apos;ill&apos; feeling that the OP is looking for compensation from JITB, because her son is disabled. 

 Posted by Principissa on 2008-09-04 
Surely your doctor told you what caused your son&apos;s illness. Did he/she confirm it was the tacos from JITB? When exactly did he become ill, how long before you took him to the doctor/hospital? 

 Posted by Ghost of Doc J on 2008-09-04 
I hate to be cynical, justcuz. But I have the same &apos;ill&apos; feeling. &quot;Now instead of going to see a lawyer and suing them over this I am willing to let them make this right with him.&quot; triggers my cynicism. What could make it right? Free tacos for life? Boxes of diapers? Reimbursed medical care? Hard to sympathize when a threat is thinly disguised in a plea for help. Again, my guess and opinion. 

 Posted by JohnInSoCal on 2008-09-04 
I agree justcuz and doc. I zone out right away when legal recourse is mentioned before an establishment has had the opportunity to respond. Makes the OP appear to be greedy. How &quot;gracious&quot; of them to give JITB the opportunity to make it right. Why not give JITB the chance to make it right before posting a complaint on a consumer website? 

 Posted by justcuz3993 on 2008-09-04 
That was exactly what did it for me too, Doc J, and the fact she made no mention of actually seeking medical care for her child. 

 Posted by Ghost of Doc J on 2008-09-04 
Yes, that is interesting John. The OP quotes the JITB store&apos;s phone number and does not relate if they contacted JITB or post any response by JITB. I dunno, Kimmosabe, me smell an ambush here. 

 Posted by justcuz3993 on 2008-09-04 
Excellent point, John, I am even more convinced now that this post is based on pure greed and nothing else. 

 Posted by Principissa on 2008-09-04 
What I don&apos;t understand is if this child was &quot;deathly ill&quot;, why no mention of medical attention? I know most of us on here, me included would rush their kids to the hospital or doctor if they displayed any signs of being deathly ill. So was the child even ill at all? 

 Posted by JohnInSoCal on 2008-09-05 
I believe the child may have been ill, but I don&apos;t think it was due to the JITB taco&apos;s. The timing is not right. The OP wants to make a few bucks and is using their child as a pawn in their attempt to extort a few dollars out of Jack in the Box. Shame on them! 

 Posted by Principissa on 2008-09-05 
I agree John. It&apos;s sick when parents try to exploit their kids for money like this.
