 People who have been interviewed by food service jobs regularly, what questions do they ask? 
 The last time I was interviewed by a fast food place they just ask what my age was (which was illegal, I just said I was over 21) and what my shirt size was, lol. I had that job for 3 days.

So for the ones that are used to these jobs and being interviewed by them, how is it usually like?
I think the shirt size question is weird. I&apos;m usually interviewed by stores and offices so it&apos;s weird to me. 1 answer - Asked By: gurlygurl20000 - 10/26/2007

 Is it just me or are min. wage low paying (usually food service) jobs more open to the idea.....? 
 Is it just me or are these places more open to the idea of an employer who has a criminal past than other jobs. If so why?

I&apos;m asking because in all my years of applying to mostly food service or retail min. wage work, they always have a question about if you commited a felony or some other crime and in fine print, it says something about it won&apos;t affect your employment. And when I did work at a bar I knew a guy who had a criminal background, a woman who didn&apos;t have any teeth (apparently due to secret drug use, a woman who knew her told me), and a girl who was 18, no hs diploma or GED, and a rude attitude and someone told me she was kicked out for fighting. I did work at a bar and grill, lol. And they definitely put the bar in bar and grill (it was in a hotel and a bit seedy). And I know a guy who apparently works at a fast food resturant a couple of hours away and it allegedly hired criminals who were rapists, murders, etc. I don&apos;t know if that was true or not though, lol.
I don&apos;t know if that last one was true or not because I got it second hand from a friend of the guy&apos;s and not from the guy&apos;s mouth. And the guy who told me is a bit of a ( I don&apos;t want to say exaggerator) but he was known to come up with weird crap to say, lol. 8 answers - Asked By: gurlygurl20000 - 5/6/2007
