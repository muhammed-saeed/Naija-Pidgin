Normal rainfall is slightly acidic because carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in the
raindrops to produce hydrogen ions. Yet, normal
rainfall is not considered acid rain. Acid rain is
a form of air pollution in which airborne acids
produced by electric utility plants and other
sources fall to Earth in distant regions. The
corrosive nature of acid rain causes widespread
damage to the environment. The problem begins with
the production of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides from the burning of fossil fuels, such as
coal, natural gas, and oil, and from certain kinds
of manufacturing.

Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides react with water and other chemicals in the
air to form sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and other
pollutants. These acid pollutants reach high into
the atmosphere, travel with the wind for hundreds
of miles, and eventually return to the ground by
way of rain, snow, or fog, and as invisible &quot;dry&quot;
forms. Damage from acid rain has been widespread
in eastern North America and throughout Europe,
and in Japan, China, and Southeast Asia. Acid rain
leaches nutrients from soils, slows the growth of
trees, and makes lakes uninhabitable for fish and
other wildlife. In cities, acid pollutants corrode
almost everything they touch, accelerating natural
wear and tear on structures such as buildings and
statues

Acids combine with other chemicals to
form urban smog, which attacks the lungs, causing
illness and premature deaths.The process that
leads to acid rain begins with the burning of
fossil fuels. Burning, or combustion, is a
chemical reaction in which oxygen from the air
combines with carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and other
elements in the substance being burned. The new
compounds formed are gases called oxides. When
sulfur and nitrogen are present in the fuel, their
reaction that occurs with oxygen yields sulfur
dioxide and various nitrogen oxide compounds. In
the United States, 70 percent of sulfur dioxide
pollution comes from power plants, especially
those that burn coal.

In Canada, industrial
activities, including oil refining and metal
smelting, account for 61 percent of sulfur dioxide
pollution. Nitrogen oxides enter the atmosphere
from many sources, with motor vehicles emitting
the largest share-43 percent in the United States
and 60 percent in Canada. Once in the atmosphere,
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides undergo complex
reactions with water vapor and other chemicals to
yield sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and other
pollutants called nitrates and sulfates. The acid
compounds are carried by air currents and the
wind, sometimes over long distances. When clouds
or fog form in acid-laden air, they too are
acidic, and so is the rain or snow that falls from
them.

Acid pollutants also occur as dry particles
and as gases, which may reach the ground without
the help of water. When these &quot;dry&quot; acids are
washed from ground surfaces by rain, they add to
the acids in the rain itself to produce a still
more corrosive solution. The combination of acid
rain and dry acids is known as acid deposition.The
acids in acid rain react chemically with any
object they contact. Acids are corrosive chemicals
that react with other chemicals by giving up
hydrogen atoms. The acidity of a substance comes
from the abundance of free hydrogen atoms when the
substance is dissolved in water.

Rain, snow, or
fog with a pH below 5.6 is considered acid rain.
When bases mix with acids, the bases lessen the
strength of an acid (see Acids and Bases). This
buffering action regularly occurs in nature. Rain,
snow, and fog formed in regions free of acid
pollutants are slightly acidic, having a pH near
5.6. Alkaline chemicals in the environment, found
in rocks, soils, lakes, and streams, regularly
neutralize this precipitation. But when
precipitation is highly acidic, with a pH below
5.6, naturally occurring acid buffers become
depleted over time, and nature&apos;s ability to
neutralize the acids is impaired.

Acid rain has
been linked to widespread environmental damage,
including soil and plant degradation, depleted
life in lakes and streams, and erosion of
human-made structures.Acid rain can best be
curtailed by reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxides released by power plants,
motorized vehicles, and factories. The simplest
way to cut these emissions is to use less energy
from fossil fuels. Individuals can help. Every
time a consumer buys an energy-efficient
appliance, adds insulation to a house, or takes a
bus to work, he or she conserves energy and, as a
result, fights acid rain. Another way to cut
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides is
by switching to cleaner-burning fuels.

For
instance, coal can be high or low in sulfur, and
some coal contains sulfur in a form that can be
washed out easily before burning. By using more of
the low-sulfur or cleanable types of coal,
electric utility companies and other industries
can pollute less. The gasoline and diesel oil that
run most motor vehicles can also be formulated to
burn more cleanly, producing less nitrogen oxide
pollution. Clean-burning fuels such as natural gas
are being used increasingly in vehicles. Natural
gas contains almost no sulfur and produces very
low nitrogen oxides.

Unfortunately, natural gas
and the less-polluting coals tend to be more
expensive, placing them out of the reach of
nations that are struggling economically.
Pollution can also be reduced at the moment the
fuel is burned. Several new kinds of burners and
boilers alter the burning process to produce less
nitrogen oxides and more free nitrogen, which is
harmless. Limestone or sandstone added to the
combustion chamber can capture some of the sulfur
released by burning coal. Once sulfur dioxide and
oxides of nitrogen have been formed, there is one
more chance to keep them out of the atmosphere. In
smokestacks, devices called scrubbers spray a
mixture of water and powdered limestone into the
waste gases (flue gases), recapturing the sulfur.
Pollutants can also be removed by catalytic
converters.

In a converter, waste gases pass over
small beads coated with metals. These metals
promote chemical reactions that change harmful
substances to less harmful ones. In the United
States and Canada, these devices are required in
cars, but they are not often used in smokestacks.
Once acid rain has occurred, a few techniques can
limit environmental damage. In a process known as
liming, powdered limestone can be added to water
or soil to neutralize the acid dropping from the
sky. In Norway and Sweden, nations much afflicted
with acid rain, lakes are commonly treated this
way.

Rural water companies may need to lime their
reservoirs so that acid does not eat away water
pipes. In cities, exposed surfaces vulnerable to
acid rain destruction can be coated with
acid-resistant paints. Delicate objects like
statues can be sheltered indoors in
climate-controlled rooms. Cleaning up sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides will reduce not only
acid rain but also smog, which will make the air
look clearer. Based on a study of the value that
visitors to national parks place on clear scenic
vistas, the U.S.

Environmental Protection Agency
thinks that improving the vistas in eastern
national parks alone will be worth $1 billion in
tourist revenue a year.In the United States,
legislative efforts to control sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides began with passage of the Clean
Air Act of 1970. This act established emissions
standards for pollutants from automobiles and
industry. In 1990 Congress approved a set of
amendments to the act that impose stricter limits
on pollution emissions, particularly pollutants
that cause acid rain. These amendments aim to cut
the national output of sulfur dioxide from 23.5
million tons to 16 million tons by the year 2010.
Although no national target is set for nitrogen
oxides, the amendments require that power plants,
which emit about one-third of all nitrogen oxides
released to the atmosphere, reduce their emissions
from 7.5 million tons to 5 million tons by 2010.
These rules were applied first to selected large
power plants in Eastern and Midwestern states. In
the year 2000, smaller, cleaner power plants
across the country came under the law.

These 1990
amendments include a novel provision for sulfur
dioxide control. Each year the government gives
companies permits to release a specified number of
tons of sulfur dioxide. Polluters are allowed to
buy and sell their emissions permits. For
instance, a company can choose to reduce its
sulfur dioxide emissions more than the law
requires and sell its unused pollution emission
allowance to another company that is further from
meeting emission goals; the buyer may then pollute
above the limit for a certain time. Unused
pollution rights can also be &apos;banked&apos; and kept for
later use.

It is hoped that this flexible market
system will clean up emissions more quickly and
cheaply than a set of rigid rules. Legislation
enacted in Canada restricts the annual amount of
sulfur dioxide emissions to 2.3 million tons in
all of Canada&apos;s seven easternmost provinces, where
acid rain causes the most damage. A national cap
for sulfur dioxide emissions has been set at 3.2
million tons per year. Legislation is currently
being developed to enforce stricter pollution
emissions by 2010. Norwegian law sets the goal of
reducing sulfur dioxide emission to 76 percent of
1980 levels and nitrogen oxides emissions to 70
percent of the 1986 levels.

To encourage cleanup,
Norway collects a hefty tax from industries that
emit acid pollutants. In some cases these taxes
make it more expensive to emit acid pollutants
than to reduce emissions.Acid rain typically
crosses national borders, making pollution control
an international issue. Canada receives much of
its acid pollution from the United States-by some
estimates as much as 50 percent. Norway and Sweden
receive acid pollutants from Britain, Germany,
Poland, and Russia. The majority of acid pollution
in Japan comes from China.

Debates about
responsibilities and cleanup costs for acid
pollutants led to international cooperation. In
1988, as part of the Long-Range Transboundary Air
Pollution Agreement sponsored by the United
Nations, the United States and 24 other nations
ratified a protocol promising to hold yearly
nitrogen oxide emissions at or below 1987 levels.
In 1991 the United States and Canada signed an Air
Quality Agreement setting national limits on
annual sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants
and factories. In 1994 in Oslo, Norway, 12
European nations agreed to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions by as much as 87 percent by 2010.
Legislative actions to prevent acid rain have
results. The targets established in laws and
treaties are being met, usually ahead of schedule.
Sulfur emissions in Europe decreased by 40 percent
from 1980 to 1994. In Norway sulfur dioxide
emissions fell by 75 percent during the same
period.

Since 1980 annual sulfur dioxide emissions
in the United States have dropped from 26 million
tons to 18.3 million tons. Canada reports sulfur
dioxide emissions have been reduced to 2.6 million
tons, 18 percent below the proposed limit of 3.2
million tons. Monitoring stations in several
nations report that precipitation is actually
becoming less acidic. In Europe, lakes and streams
are now growing less acid. However, this does not
seem to be the case in the United States and
Canada.

The reasons are not completely understood,
but apparently, controls reducing nitrogen oxide
emissions only began recently and their effects
have yet to make a mark. In addition, soils in
some areas have absorbed so much acid that they
contain no more neutralizing alkaline chemicals.
The weathering of rock will gradually replace the
missing alkaline chemicals, but scientists fear
that improvement will be very slow unless
pollution controls are made even stricter.
