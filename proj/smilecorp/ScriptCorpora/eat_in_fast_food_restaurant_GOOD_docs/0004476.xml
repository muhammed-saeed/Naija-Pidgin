Coloma - The Vineyard House - In Coloma, CA, there is a famous Victorian house called the Vineyard House, which has been reputed to be haunted by its original owners for many years. The house was built some time in the late 1800s, and was used over the years as a jail, an inn and restaurant, and, as its name implies, a winery. It was also at one time supposedly the site of where some executions took place. According to records, the original owners who built the house suffered one tragedy after another. Several of their young children died, their winery was eventually ruined because of a blight, and the husband contracted syphillis, which over time caused blindness and mental illness. Because he became violent from being mentally ill, his wife had him chained to a wall in the basement of the house, where he reportedly died. The entire family is buried directly across the street in a graveyard that overlooks the house. Reports of seeing ghosts in the graveyard have also come forth in the past, but most of the stories took place inside the house. Ghost stories of the encounters where told by employees and guests of Vineyard House. One intrigueing story was told by a couple who were staying in one of the upstairs bedrooms. It was late at night and all was quiet, when suddenly the couple was awakened by the sound of drunken men coming into the hallway downstairs. They were very loud and were singing and laughing and making a general raucous, so the husband upstairs stuck his head out the bedroom door to tell the loud men to quiet down. But upon doing so, he saw three men dressed in Victorian clothing ascending the stairs, and then they faded right before his eyes. Another story from a different couple who decided to stay at the inn was that something frightened them so badly that they packed up and left in the middle of the night. They reportedly refused to say what had happened that scared them so badly. The basement was used as a bar, and it was late at night after closing hours. The owner was cleaning up and wiping down he bar. He said that there was one last glass at the far end of the bar, and as he was cleaning, the glass suddenly began to shake, and then it slid all the way across until it finally stopped right in front of him. He admitted that he had no rational explanation for what he&apos;d seen. It is believed that the things that go on in the bar are the original owner who died down there while chained to a wall. Other things that have been reported are sounds of rustling skirts, and there is apparently an area near the kitchen that is constantly cold. A woman having dinner in the restaurant claimed that she was approached by a young child who asked her to mash his peas and carrots for him. Another scary incident occurred in the restaurant when a large chandelier suddenly came crashing down, barely missing some of the guests. It used to be that when the restaurant and inn were still in operation, you could pick up a pamphlet that gave information about the hauntings. It was a famous place because it had been there since the Gold Rush, and there were pictures of famous people, such as John Wayne and Dudley Moore, hanging on the walls. The hauntings were so well-known that the house was featured on That&apos;s Incredible! and Ripley&apos;s Believe It Or Not. Sadly, the house has been closed to the public for quite a few years.

The new owner doesn&apos;t mind and comments that, &quot;People say she is a really nice girl and even shy.&quot; He has never seen her, but has had many complaints from customers that she continually flushes toilets close to closing time.

There were now many witnesses who believed that strange things were occurring at our store. Servers reported trays flying at their heads in the dishwasher&apos;s area and salt and peppershakers once empty were full. The spookiest always happened to the vendors who cleaned the restaurant. The carpets would be cleaned on a monthly basis and they would always come in pairs. Something would always happen, strange sounds, floating balloons, TV&apos;s being turned on, etc. All of these things could be explained by scientific methods: electric currents and helium filled balloons losing air. Whatever was going on in that building after the employees left was bad enough that the carpet cleaners would never come alone. On the occasions that they would come alone, they would come right at closing and be done before we would finish closing the store.

The carpet guys from then on always came promptly at closing and no one was left alone in the building.

Los Angeles - Venice Beach - Westminster Ave. Apartment Bldg. - Charlie Chaplin used to own several of the large buildings that sit near or along the famous Venice Beach Boardwalk in Los Angeles. In the day, these buildings were commonly used as bath houses or lodging for wealthy vacationers. Today, these buildings have been converted to apartment buildings for the local artists, musicians, and other creative types that now inhabit Venice Beach. Incidentally these buildings cradle around the famous Building Number 26 on Westminster Ave. It has been documented in print as well as Chaplin&apos;s films that during the early 1900&apos;s he did much of his filming in and around these properties on Westminster Avenue. In 1915, during the filming of &quot;By the Sea&quot; Chaplin&apos;s stunt double mysteriously disappeared from the film set. Production was put on hold for three days and a full on man-hunt was instated. After turning up empty-handed, it was assumed that the long time friend of Chaplin&apos;s must have quit and left on his on recognizance. The studios that were financially backing the film, were losing money. Under haste, Chaplin was forced to replace his stunt double and continue production of the film. On the seventh day after the disappearance, Chaplin returned to his dressing room after a day of shooting. His dressing room was located in the basement of the now famous Building number 26 on Westminster. It is documented that Chaplin, while accompanied by an entourage, entered the room to discover his stunt double and long time friend lying dead on the floor, wet and covered in seaweed. The man appeared to have been deceased for several days. How he had ended up on the floor of Chaplin&apos;s dressing room after missing for almost an entire week, is still to this day a complete mystery. The &quot;now&quot; inhabitants of the famous building claim to still hear strange noises emanating from the walls of somebody walking through shallow water. Other noises include moaning, and sounds of someone distantly crying for help. In addition to the assortment of disturbing sounds, there have been several sightings of what appears to be an apparition of a man bound by the hands and feet standing in luminous corners of the large building. Quite possibly the most blood curdling detail of all these sightings is what the man is seen wearing. He&apos;s dressed the same way he was the day he disappeared. A Chaplin-esque tuxedo coat with tails and the proverbial black derby hat.

Miss Lowerey became the first person to ever be killed by an automobile in this area. Many have seen a woman in white by the cemetery and near by areas, accompanied with strange lights. - November update: A paranormal researcher found there&apos;s quite an extensive collection of newspaper clippings that was donated to the library by a journalist. The clippings go back to the turn of the 20th century, so they cover the period when the &quot;accident&quot; happened. According to the first journalist to report on the supposed haunting, about ten years after the date in the 1920&apos;s when the woman was popularly held to have died, there was no mention of anyone dying in an accident in the canyon, and county records of the time listed no account of the body of anyone who had supposedly died in Niles Canyon. There was, in the early 50&apos;s, a young man who dressed in a white sheet and jumped out in front of motorists near one of the bridges on Halloween. He scared someone so bad that they immediately drove to the nearest phone and called the police, who arrived in force (owing to the legend of the white witch) and drew guns on what they thought was the ghost. The young man was almost shot, though he was not arrested, but he had to be taken to a coffee shop where it took him until 2am to calm down sufficiently to go home. The supposed &quot;white witch of Niles&quot; actually follows the scenario of a common fake ghost story, that being the &quot;hitchhiking ghost&quot; story. The Niles ghost is most commonly said to hitchhike to one of the bridges in the area, where she disappears at the tollbooth. There is no cemetery that they know of in Sunol, which is at the top of Niles Canyon Rd. Similarly; there is no Morrison Canyon ghost.
