Waiting on tables is a hard enough job without having to deal with customers who demand pampering. If you make a job hard for a waiter/waitress, they will find a way to make your dining experience miserable. Here are some tips for dealing with the tempermental staffs of the restuarant business.

GET OUT OF THE WAY! Sometimes, when the bar is full, and there are tables waiting, people stand around looking at the matrodee and study his features until he leads them with the menus. But, in the mean time, they block the flow of the restuarant traffic and simply make their wait that much longer. If you want to get that table, stand off to the side while you wait.
 
NITPICKERS BEWARE. The dishes are prepared a ceartin way for a reason. Dietary needs are kept in mind to an extent, but, most of the food in a restuarant is made to cook, meaning, that it is prepared way in advance. When you completely change the chemistry of an entree the chef gets mad with the waiter, and deliberatley stalls that waiter&apos;s tables, meaning your food.

I DON&apos;T COOK THE FOOD. If the food is undesirable, or not to one&apos;s standards, don&apos;t bash the server. He/she doesn&apos;t prepare the meals, only the hot plates they are served on. If its bad we&apos;ll fix it-if you&apos;re nice about it.

I AM A SERVER NOT A SERVANT. Just because you buy from me, that doesn&apos;t mean you buy me. Consider me a salesperson and dining as a business transaction. Would you condescend a client the way you would a server? Servers DO have a hard job. The restuarant business is among the most stressful work envoirnments and dealing with people is hard work. Most waiters and waitresses have many other responsibilites besides work-often children, spouses, second and third jobs, careers, college, etc. Don&apos;t belittle someone who isn&apos;t in a position to defend themselves, 9 out of 10 times, they would have told you off, but a server is bound to their fake smile.

Enjoy your meal and if you&apos;s need anything else, don&apos;t hesitate.
