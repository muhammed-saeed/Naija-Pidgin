 Vehicle maintenance helps prevent wildfires, officials say 
A well-maintained vehicle can help prevent wildfires, according to state fire officials.

The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection&apos;s Amador-El Dorado Unit reports that several recent fires have been caused by vehicles, citing areas along Highway 50, Bass Lake Road, Gold Hill Road and Cameron Park Drive in El Dorado County. In Amador County, recent fire scars can be seen along highways 49 and 88 and Ridge Road, where vehicles caused strings of wildland fires.

&quot;When a vehicle&apos;s engine is not well maintained, the exhaust system can become overtaxed, thereby allowing fuel to enter the exhaust system, which in turn overheats the catalytic convertor that melts and disintegrates,&quot; Scott Hogan, fire equipment manager for the Amador-El Dorado Unit said in a written statement. &quot;Pieces of the catalytic converter exit the muffler at about 1,200 degrees F and can bounce onto the dried grass along the edge of road and start fires.&quot;

 Sacramento PD: Verbal confrontation leads to Highway 99 off-ramp shooting 
Sacramento police are investigating a shooting that occurred shortly before 9 p.m. at the Broadway off-ramp of Highway 99, which sent a man in his 20s to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, a police spokesman said.

Officers have learned the man was in a car exiting the freeway when he was shot at least once in the upper body, said Sgt. Andrew Pettit, police spokesman. Officers believe words were exchanged between occupants of the victim&apos;s vehicle and occupants of a vehicle that had pulled up alongside it, leading to the victim being shot, Pettit said.

The victim went to the 3800 block of Third Avenue, where a call was made to police, and was then driven by an acquaintance to a nearby hospital, Pettit said.

With volunteer pilots using their own aircraft, there is no cost to taxpayers or the county, officials said. Federal asset forfeiture funds will be used to pay for the fuel.

 Lincoln teenager arrested in burglary of evacuated home 
A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the burglary of a home that occurred last week while the neighborhood was under emergency evacuation due to a rail tanker fire.

 Rancho Cordova woman killed in Highway 99 crash identified 
 The Fresno Bee 

The Madera County Sheriff&apos;s office has released the name of a Rancho Cordova woman killed Friday in a crash between a compact car and a big rig on Highway 99.

The woman, Jerri Fuller, 21, was driving a 1997 Honda Accord north on Highway 99 south of Avenue 21 1/2 when she veered left from the pavement, slid across the dirt median and into oncoming southbound traffic. The driver of a tractor-trailer rig swerved to try to avoid the Honda, but the car struck the left side of the trailer and the rear wheels rolled over it, breaking the rear axle from the trailer.

Fuller was declared dead at the scene. The truck driver, Kevin Barth, 48, of Wisconsin, was taken to Madera Community Hospital after he complained of pain.

Officers said witnesses reported Fuller was driving the Honda at between 65 and 80 mph when she left the northbound lanes of the highway. Officers don&apos;t know why the car sped across the median and into the southbound lanes. The collision was reported about 3:30 p.m.

 Lincoln propane tanker fire cause still undetermined; feds to conduct investigation

Whitt&apos;s preliminary report on the tanker car blaze that resulted in the evacuation of approximately 4,800 homes in the city for two days leaves unanswered why the fire erupted that day.

It could be some time before federal officials release a possible cause. Whitt said he understands that federal investigators with the Federal Railroad Administration want to take the the burned rail car away on a flatbed car to a location where they can closely exam the tanker.

 Effort launched to repeal California&apos;s death penalty 
 By Sam Stanton
 sstanton@sacbee.com 

Opponents of the state&apos;s death penalty announced a new effort Monday aimed at getting an initiative before voters next year that would abolish the death penalty and replace it with life without parole.

The effort uses the enormous costs of California&apos;s death penalty as a sales point with voters, and organizers said this morning that roughly $4 billion has been spent since 1978 to execute only 13 inmates.

Jeanne Woodford, a former San Quentin warden who presided over four executions, was the main speaker at a news conference outside the state Attorney General&apos;s office in Sacramento and was joined by lawyers, crime victims and others to declare that the time is now to do away with executions.

 Grants to Sacramento County crime lab will help cut forensic backlog 
Two grants to the Sacramento County DA&apos;s office will help speed up crime lab turnaround time for analyzing DNA evidence and replace forensic equipment.

The grants, which total $687,000, are much needed after years of budget cuts to her department, said District Attorney Jan Scully. The cuts have reduced both staff and equipment, she said, and the monies will help cut forensic work backlog.

The grants:

-- State Department of Justice DNA backlog program: $586,429 will fund crime lab analysts, consultants for case screening, training and equipment purchases.

-- Cloverdell Forensic Science Improvment program: $100,625 will be used for equipment and analytical system upgrades.

 Missing Fair Oaks boy returned safely to his family 
The 6-year-old Fair Oaks boy who was being sought by the Sacramento County Sheriff&apos;s Department has been returned home safely, according to authorities.

The boy, Raymond Peters (photo, right), had been last seen Friday evening with his mother, Tricia Pelletier (photo, left), who does not have legal custody of her son. She violated her court-ordered visitation rights when she failed to return him to the custody of his father and grandmother Sunday, according to a Sheriff&apos;s Department news release.

Raymond was considered to be at-risk because he has asthma and it is believed that his mother does not have the medication the youngster needs.

However, Pelletier reportedly saw herself on the news today and returned Raymond to his grandmother&apos;s house, said sheriff&apos;s Deputy Jason Ramos. The boy had not been harmed.

Pelletier&apos;s whereabouts are not known, Ramos said.

 Suspect sought in Olivehurst animal cruelty case 
The Yuba County Sheriff&apos;s Department seeks the public&apos;s help in locating a suspect in a case of animal cruelty that left a dog badly injured earlier this month.

Just before 7 p.m. Aug. 2, several residents of the 1800 block of Seventh Avenue in Olivehurst saw a dog suspended from the bed of a pickup truck as it drove east on Seventh Avenue. The dog, a female American bulldog, appeared to have been attached to a rope in the bed of the truck, according to a Sheriff&apos;s Department news release.

The dog came loose from the rope and fell to the roadway, where it may have been run over by a rear tire of the truck. The driver stopped the vehicle, then allegedly backed up, running over the dog again before driving away.

 Update: Lincoln tanker empty of liquid propane, only fumes now burning 


By Matt Kawahara
 


Fire officials have announced that they now believe the tanker car burning in Lincoln since Tuesday is virtually empty of liquid propane, and that they may be able to render it inert before midnight.

Flames from the top of the car died down around 9 p.m., leading firefighters to run tests attempting to determine how much propane was left in the car, said Lincoln Fire Chief Dave Whitt. They are now pumping the rail car full of water and aqueous foam in an attempt to force out any residual liquid and propane vapors, said Whitt.

&quot;As the tank fills up with foam and water, it&apos;s pushing the residual vapors outside the tank,&quot; he said. &quot;So we re-lit the fire again and as the tank fills up it&apos;ll continue to burn off the residual vapors. We should have a stable tank once that foam ... fills up that tank.&quot;

 Child molester convicted again 
A Sacramento Superior Court jury convicted today the 56-year-old child molester accused ot trying to &quot;groom&quot; new victims within a week of his release from prison last year.

It took the panel less than a day to reach its verdict on Robert Precobb, who was accused on one count of annoying or molesting a minor and four more counts of furnishing marijuana to minors.

Precobb was ordered freed last year from his 15-to-life prison sentence on a 1988 child molestation conviction. The release resulted from a California Supreme Court decision that changed the law on whether certain predicate offenses could be used to trigger the life term.

Judge Greta Curtis Fall scheduled Precobb&apos;s sentencing for Sept. 23. He is facing five 25-to-life terms.

 Placer DA plans no action against sheriff&apos;s sergeant in shooting 
The Placer County District Attorney&apos;s Office has concluded that an off-duty sheriff&apos;s deputy did not commit a crime when he intercepted and shot a man who was being chased by Rocklin police.

The District Attorney&apos;s Office announced today that it has completed its review of the May 29 shooting of Sergey Pautov, 22 of Rancho Cordova, by Placer County Sheriff&apos;s Sgt. Vaness Bogardus. The review was based on information provided in Rocklin and Roseville police department reports, as well as an analysis of California law, according to a District Attorney&apos;s Office news release.

These materials established that officers, including Sgt. Bogardus, were advised that Pautov was a suspect who was wanted for a recent burglary and auto theft. Sgt. Bogardus and other officers were also aware that Pautov had been evading capture while driving a stolen vehicle in a reckless manner that endangered the public, including twice driving on the wrong side of the road, officials said. Pautov eventually abandoned the vehicle and began to run away.

 Highway patrol reminds RV drivers of safety tips 
Bee Staff

Even as the summer vacation season winds down for those heeding the school calendars, there are still plenty of recreationists on the road.

The California Highway Patrol has a few driving and safety reminders for drivers of recreational vehicles.

Best days for travel are not weekends. Unless it&apos;s absolutely necessary, avoid traveling in your RV on Saturday and Sunday. These are the two most heavily congested traffic days around recreational areas. Driving weekdays is much more enjoyable and relaxing.

Caravans are problems. Most RV caravans occur on two lane roads, creating a nightmare for drivers of other vehicles. Other drivers can&apos;t see ahead, they have difficulty in passing, and as tempers flare they take chances or make driving mistakes, thus creating the perfect setting for a traffic collision which could involve you. You can contribute to safer roadways in California by discouraging caravans or establishing large spaces between the caravaning vehicles.

Robert Winston Precobb, 56, is charged with one count of annoying or molesting a minor and five more counts of furnishing marijuana to minors.

Precobb had spent more than 20 years in prison on a child molestation conviction before Sacramento Superior Court Judge Sharon A. Lueras ordered him released in February 2010.

 Sacramento police seek information in July homicide 
Sacramento police are seeking the public&apos;s help in identifying the driver of a sports utility vehicle who is believed to have been the last person to see a homicide victim before he was killed last month.

 Detectives hope that the driver of the vehicle, pictured at left, might be able to provide information that will jumpstart an investigation that has gone cold, according to police.

On July 22, 49-year-old Thong Khousakoune was found dead after his Honda CRV crashed into a home at 15th Avenue and Franklin Boulevard. Further investigation revealed that Khousakoune died from gunshot wounds and not from the impact of the crash, according to police.

That night, the Fresno resident visited friends in Sacramento and likely was preparing to return to Fresno via Highway 99 when he stopped to get gas at the Shell gas station at 12th Avenue and Franklin Boulevard about 11 p.m., police said.

 Antelope residents victims of widespread tagging spree 
Residents of a wide swath of the Antelope community awoke this morning to graffiti on fences, cars, garages, mailboxes and an elementary school.

Sacramento County sheriff&apos;s spokesman Deputy Jason Ramos said a man walking his dog called the Sheriff&apos;s Department about 7 a.m. to report that he had observed a lot of spray painting and tagging that appeared to have white supremacist overtones.

Ramos said the graffiti included swastikas and some references to white supremacist gangs, but much of the tagging appeared to have no particular significance. The word &quot;Minkus,&quot; believed to be a tagger&apos;s moniker or signature, appeared at several locations, Ramos said.

 Update: Suspect who allegedly shot at officer now in custody 
The man Sacramento police have been seeking in the Valley Hi area for three hours this afternoon is believed to be in custody, according to police.

The suspect came out of an apartment unit on Valley Hi Drive with another adult and two children and surrendered to police about 6:20 p.m., police Officer Konrad von Schoech confirmed. Officers are now confirming that the man is the same one suspected of firing at an officer earlier this afternoon - and, potentially, a man suspected in at least one earlier robbery.

Just after 3 p.m., an officer attempted to stop a man who matched the description of a suspect in at least one other robbery, von Schoech said. Two minutes after he voiced the attempted stop, the officer radioed dispatch to say the suspect had fired at him. Nobody was hit, von Schoech said.

Police have not positively identified the suspect and are not sure whether he is, in fact, the same person suspected in the robbery, von Schoech said.

The suspect was believed to be holed up in an apartment complex at Bamford Drive and Valley Hi Drive. Police located a handgun within the perimeter of the scene, but are not yet sure if it is related to the suspect and therefore are not sure whether the suspect remains armed, von Schoech said.

 State prison officials report progress toward cutting inmate population 
By Sam Stanton
 sstanton@sacbee.com 

California prison officials expect to fall just short of a court-ordered reduction in inmate populations by December, but say they will be in compliance by next June and do not expect to have to ask federal courts for more time to achieve a lower inmate population.

Papers filed today with a panel of three federal judges who have ordered the state to improve medical and mental health conditions inside California prisons say moves by Gov. Jerry Brown will substantially meet the court&apos;s requirements.

The state&apos;s inmate population is required to be at 167 percent of capacity by December, and prison officials said they expect to reduce populations by 9,200 inmates, or about 169 percent of capacity.

 Teen lovers sentenced to prison in mother&apos;s savage murder 
 By Peter Hecht

 phecht@sacbee.com 

Steven Paul Colver was sentenced today to life in prison without the possibility of parole and his teen lover Tylar Marie Witt was sentenced to 15-years to life after pleading guilty in a reduced charge in the murder of her mother, Joanne M. Witt.

The back-to-back sentencings came after family members of Joanne Witt, stabbed to death in the bedroom of her El Dorado Hills home, decried Colver, then 19, for talking advantage of a 14-year-old girl and carrying out the savage killing of her mother

&quot;Steven Colver not only took the life of our daughter,&quot; said Norbert Witt, Joanne Witt&apos;s father, &quot;but he also destroyed the life of our granddaughter.&quot;

He said Colver, then 19, introduced a young girl &quot;to heavy narcotics and sex&quot; and then carried out the savage killing of her mother.

Moments later, with Colver out of the courtroom, he turned to Witt, now 16, and told her how she deprived the family of a loving mother, sister and daughter &quot;who dedicated her life to you.&quot;

&quot;You were your mother&apos;s only child,&quot; he added. &quot;You are a murderer. You and your boyfriend planned and executed...a vicious senseless murder.&quot;

Judge Daniel B. Proud imposed mandatory sentence against Colver, who was convicted of first-degree murder and special circumstances of lying in wait and killing a witness. He said he had &quot;no reservations&quot; about putting Colver, 21, away forever given the violence he carried out.

Accepting Tylar Witt&apos;s plea agreement of second-degree murder, he imposed the 15-years to life sentence with a lecture.

&quot;Joanne Witt loved her daughter. She was a protective and carrying mother. She tried her best. I&apos;m sorry Ms. Witt because the person who loved you more than anyone in the world, without reservation is gone.&quot;

The sordid criminal case - which ultimately involved the premeditated murder of the mother of a disturbed, rebellious girl - concluded as the father of the victim, the grandfather of the girl, told of the searing effect the case has had on his family.

The sentencing unfolded after Colver&apos;s trial revealed the saga of two deeply troubled teens, who killed Joanne Witt shortly after midnight June 12, 2009 and fled in a suicide pact after the had mother reported Colver to authorities for statutory rape over his relationship with Tylar.

El Dorado County prosecutors said Colver brutally stabbed Joanne Witt more than 20 times while she was sleeping in her El Dorado Hills home, ultimately killing her with a gaping cut to her neck.

A jury convicted Colver of first-degree murder with a special circumstance of lying in wait on June 15. Tylar Witt pleaded guilty to her role in the killing in September 2010.

Tylar Witt testified during trial that the teens had ascended the stairs to commit the killing together, Colver with a chef&apos;s knife from his restaurant job and she with kitchen knife from the house. But after Colver entered the bedroom and practiced slashing motions, she said she collapsed outside the door and, &quot;I put my hands on my ear, closed my eyes and hummed,&quot; as her mother was murdered.

The girl testified that she was possessed by three spirits, &quot;a demon from hell&quot; named Toby, &quot;Alex,&quot; her inner angel and Tylar herself, a troubled 14-year-old girl. Her calm demeanor in describing the plot was assailed by Colver&apos;s lawyer, Dain Weiner, who argued that the girl - not his client - killed Joanne Witt.

&quot;Throughout this trial, you haven&apos;t shed a single tear,&quot; Weiner challenged the girl during her testimony.

&quot;I have trouble crying in front of people,&quot; she answered.

When he asked her if she was acting, she answered, &quot;No, I feel full emotion.&quot; She said she regretted her mother&apos;s death but, &quot;I think I have actually only been able to cry, like bawling, about three or four times.&quot;

In his testimony, Colver claimed the girl called him to the house and greeted him with a bloody knife saying, &quot;I finally did it. My mom is finally gone forever.&quot;

Under cross-examination, with a prosecutor introducing a 2007 journal entry in which Colver suggested a fascination with watching someone bleed to death, Colver described himself as suicidal, often self-loathing, but said he would never kill anyone.

Yet after the teens fled to San Francisco, where they attempted suicide by ingesting Fruit Loops and Red Velvet Cake laced with rat poison, their own writings pointed to their roles in the Joanne Witt&apos;s murder.

Colver wrote in a journal that he was so devoted to Tylar that he would &quot;travel through the pits of hell&quot; and &quot;take the life of another&quot; to have her.

&quot;It is a true test when facing the test of taking the life of another to be with the one you love,&quot; he said.

After Joanne Witt&apos;s body was found, he texted an apology to a companion, declaring, &quot;Our sin has reached the news.&quot;

Key testimony in the trial came from friends such as Matthew Widman, a gangly teen nicknamed &quot;God,&quot; who testified that Colver showed him a bloody knife and described plunging it into Joanne Witt. Another friend, Matthew Bogert, a young man nicknamed &quot;Squishy,&quot; told of calling Colver as the teens fled to San Francisco and hearing Colver confess that &quot;he killed his girlfriend&apos;s mom, that her body is in her bedroom.&quot;

Unaware Colver was already romantically involved with her daughter, Joanne Witt had rented him a $500-month room in her house after the teens led her to believe he was gay and a platonic &quot;big brother&quot; figure to Tylar. The mother kicked him out after she found her daughter naked in a utility closet in the room, telling him she wouldn&apos;t file statutory rape charges against him as long as he stopped seeing her daughter.

That was apparently impossible. While high on Esctasy and No Doze, Colver had written in the girl&apos;s journal, &quot;Tylar Goddess Marie Witt, I love you more than you can possible imagine. I would gladly face scorn...or eternal damnation if it meant I could have you in my life.&quot;

A friend of Colver&apos;s, Courtney Epperson, 22, who let him stay at her apartment after he left Joanne Witt&apos;s house, said Tylar called constantly and &quot;just wouldn&apos;t let them separate, even for a day.&quot;

Joanne Witt later gave El Dorado authorities her daughter&apos;s diary, detailing a sexual relationship with Colver.

At their San Francisco hotel, following their failed attempt to poison themselves, authorities found a suicide note from Tylar that read, &quot;You, mother, made me a whore, to the man I love.&quot;

A story she wrote, set in medieval times, later reached friends in the mail. It described young lovers betrayed to authorities by an oppressive mother.

&quot;That&apos;s when their hope vanished,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and when this man, this 19-year-old man became a killer.&quot; She told of the girl sneaking the boyfriend into her house, where he stabbed the mother &quot;in her sleep, killing her and freeing themselves.&quot;

The real life-lovers are now being sent away to prison. Tylar&apos;s could be eligible to be freed on parole at 29. Colver&apos;s freedom is over.

 Life term for man who murdered woman and burned her body 
A man who strangled a woman and set her body on fire was sentenced today to 34 years to life in prison.

Jose Duarte, 25, received the term for the killing of Alicia Ray, 20, whose body was found Aug. 10, 2008, in her apartment in the 2000 block of West El Camino Avenue.

Jurors convicted Duarte of both murder and arson in June.

Defense attorney Stacy Bogh asked Sacramento Superior Court Judge Russell L. Hom to only impose the medium term for the arson. The judge declined, saying that the fire &quot;desecrated&quot; Ray&apos;s body &quot;in many ways,&quot; to the point where &quot;the victim&apos;s mother couldn&apos;t even look look at it after that.&quot; The judge then gave Duarte the eight-year maximum on the arson count.

Some members of Duarte&apos;s family left the courtroom in anger. They muttered remarks under their breath towards Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz and claimed the defendant was innocent.

 Ex-inmate nabbed breaking into New Folsom Prison 
Correctional officers at New Folsom Prison searched for contraband after they caught a former inmate who they said snuck back onto prison grounds.

Marvin Lane Ussery, 48, was arrested Thursday for being an ex-felon on prison grounds. Ussery was paroled June 1, 2009 after serving time for robbery. He was once held in California State Prison, Sacramento -- sometime called New Folsom.

Correctional officers have noticed a trend in which ex-inmates with knowledge of prison grounds will climb a fence into an institution and hide a backpack of cellphones and drugs. Later, an inmate weed-abatement crew will smuggle the contraband back into cells.

 Burglars rammed open doors of a Cal Expo big box store before making off with thousands of dollars in jewelry.

Thieves smashed open steel doors on the north side of the Costco, 1600 Expo Parkway, about 2 a.m. The two men drove their car through the double doors in reverse, smashing them open.

Once inside, the thieves broke a large glass jewelry display case, said Sacramento Police Sgt. Louis Pease.

&quot;They took every piece of jewelry out of there,&quot; Pease said.

Descriptions of the men were not available, in part because the store was dark when the break-in occurred. Police are checking video of area businesses for possible images of the burglars or their car.

 Tips for fitting a life jacket correctly 
Because a life jacket that does not fit properly can put a person at risk of drowning, the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary has a few tips when choosing a life jacket.

* Choose only a life jacket approved by the U.S. Coast Guard and the correct size for the weight of the person. The U.S.C.G. stamp of approval, size, whether it is for a child or an adult, and appropriate weight of the wearer should be listed inside the jacket. A person&apos;s chest size and stomach size may come into play when selecting the right life jacket.

* Use the &quot;touchdown&quot; test to see if your life jacket fits properly: Lift your arms above your head as if signaling a touchdown. The chest portion of the jacket should not touch your chin when you look left, right or over your shoulder. If the jacket passes this test, it most likely fits. If possible, try it in shallow water. The life jacket should not ride up on your body. However, ride-up may happen if your stomach is larger than your chest.

* Weigh a child and measure for chest size under the arms before shopping for a child&apos;s life jacket. A properly fitting jacket should be snug but not tight.

* Check for proper fit of a life jacket on a child. Wearing the jacket, the child should stand normally with arms at his or her sides. Grab the jacket at the shoulders and firmly lift. The jacket does not fit if it moves more than three inches up and down the child&apos;s body during the test.

* Ensure a life jacket for an infant or child has a crotch strap to help keep the life jacket on, an oversized float collar to help keep the head out of the water and a grab loop for easier water rescue. All straps should be intact and fastened at all times.

The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary is the uniformed volunteer component of the U.S. Coast Guard.

 Sacramento woman finds old grenade while cleaning 
Sacramento Police were briefly on high alert Friday after responding to a call from a woman claiming to have found a grenade while cleaning her garage.

According to Sgt. Norm Leong, the department&apos;s Explosive Ordinance Disposal unit was summoned to the house in the city&apos;s Pocket neighborhood, but officers determined that the grenade had no firing pin.

Upon further questioning, it was learned that the grenade had likely belonged to the woman&apos;s late husband, and had been gathering dust inside of an old box before its discovery Saturday.

The bomb squad did remove the grenade but were not forced to detonate it because it was inactive and not functional.

 Murderer sentenced to 50 years to life in prison 
A teenager who shot and killed a man after an argument on a light rail train in Rancho Cordova was sentenced today to 50 years to life in prison.

Deandre Dwayne Rooks, 21, was convicted in June of first-degree murder for the shooting death of Juan Carlos Sanchez, 21.

According to the evidence at trial, Sanchez, who had been drinking and was carrying a cup that smelled of vodka, asked Rooks for a cigarette when the two got on board the train at the Mather Road station. When Rooks refused, the two got into an argument. A security guard kicked them both off the train at Zinfandel Road.

The two then went behind a department store to fight each other, when Rooks, who was accompanied by several friends, took out a gun and shot Sanchez six times, including three times in the back, according to the trial testimony.

Sacramento Superior Court Judge Helena R. Gweon called the murder &quot;brutal, senseless and cowardly.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Rooks, on the night of the murder, you were sober -- Juan Carlos was not,&quot; the judge said. &quot;You had five people with you. Juan Carlos was alone. You had a gun. Juan Carlos had a styrofoam cup in his hand&quot;

The men accused in the July 29 shooting death of a man during what detectives suspect was a robbery-gone-bad have criminal histories involving guns, assaults and robbery among the three of them, according to Sacramento Superior Court records.

One of them - 31-year-old Travis Mabson - was discharged from parole in May after initially serving about nine years of a 12-year prison term, according to records from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

Arrested in connection with 54-year-old Michael Sanderson&apos;s slaying on Manzanita Avenue were Mabson; Patrick McPherson, 24; and Patrick Godines, 26.

The combative people were subdued. One was taken to the hospital, the other arrested for resisting arrest and assault on a police officer, who suffered a split lip that required stitches.

The incidents again raise questions: How often do officers need to use the devices to bring unruly subjects under control? And what guidelines for Taser use do officers follow?

 In this weekend&apos;s Bee: How last summer&apos;s 56-hour standoff unfolded 
 

Last summer, authorities estimate that Anthony Alvarez took a .308 caliber round from a semi-automatic rifle to the shoulder about 9 a.m. the Thursday after he kicked off the longest hostage situation in Sacramento County history.

The round created a gaping exit wound about as big as a silver half-dollar.

And yet, the 26-year-old Alvarez would remain holed up in his cousin&apos;s Arden Way apartment for another 34 hours, occasionally firing at police and holding a 16-month-old toddler hostage. He never once complained to negotiators about the injury, nor did it appear to affect his resolve, according to the Sacramento County Sheriff&apos;s Department.

That&apos;s just one example allowing some insight into Alvarez&apos;s mindset during the 56-hour standoff that ended with Alvarez&apos;s death and the toddler&apos;s safe recovery. Sheriff&apos;s officials say Alvarez was a unique and sophisticated opponent who created the most difficult hostage scenario most law enforcement officers involved had seen in their careers.

Coming in The Bee this weekend, read never-before released details about the standoff - including SWAT efforts to end the standoff peacefully and the many hurdles facing them - and reflections from sheriff&apos;s officials about how it played out.

 Nunez, Schwarzenegger case to stay in Sacramento 
 A Sacramento judge today combined and retained the two lawsuits that challenged former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s commutation of the 16-year prison sentence of former Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez &apos;s son.

Superior Court Judge Laurie M. Earl found that the case is &quot;much further along&quot; in Sacramento than in San Diego and ruled that the case stay here.

Núñez&apos;s son, Esteban Núñez , was convicted in the fatal stabbing of Luis Santos at a party in San Diego. Schwarzenegger, in one of his last acts as California governor, commuted Esteban Nunez&apos;s sentence to seven years.

Lawsuits challenging the action were filed in San Diego by District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis and in Sacramento by Luis Santos&apos; parents. Attorneys for the state sought to have the case consolidated and heard in Sacramento.

 Fred Santos , the father of the slain victim and a Northern California resident whose attorneys filed suit in Sacramento, said it does not matter to him where the case is heard.

&quot;We did not file a lawsuit to find convenience in our life,&quot; Santos told reporters after today&apos;s hearing. &quot;We filed the lawsuit to seek justice for our son.&quot;

San Diego County Deputy District Attorney Laura E. Tanney argued that the case should be heard in San Diego because that&apos;s where her clients&apos; son was killed and where other victims also were injured.

&quot;It&apos;s where the tip of the governor&apos;s sword slashed against justice,&quot; she told the court.

 Dirt bike collides with police patrol car, rider seriously hurt 
A 20-year-old man sustained major injuries when he was thrown from his motorized dirt bike into the path of a Twin Rivers Police Department patrol car Wednesday evening in North Highlands.

The collision occurred around 6:45 p.m. at the intersection of Holiday Way and Brock Drive, said California Highway Patrol Sgt. Kelly Cardoza. Investigators believe the dirt bike rider was traveling up Holiday Way, turned left sharply onto Brock Drive and saw the patrol car approaching toward him, Cardoza said.

The rider - who lives in the neighborhood - attempted to set the bike down but while trying to do so was thrown into the path of the patrol car, which hit him, Cardoza said. She said the rider, whose name was not released, was transported to a nearby hospital where he was believed to be in stable condition.

Cardoza said the rider of the dirt bike failed to yield at a T intersection and also was traveling on the wrong side of the road, factors that she said will be a part of the investigation.

Officer William Cho, spokesman for the Twin Rivers department, said the driver of the patrol car was on duty at the time and was not responding to a call when the collision occurred. He said the officer would return to duty.

Cardoza said investigators believe the dirt bike was stolen and is not street legal.

 I voted to send another brother to prison 
By Ed Fletcher
 efletcher@sacbee.com 
 
For better or worse, television crime drama can not replicate the gut wrenching experience of sitting in a jury box.

On Tuesday, I concluded 10 days of jury service by reaching a guilty verdict, and in all likelihood sending another brother to an already overcrowded prison system.

We convicted Donnell Boyce, 31, for his role in the Jan. 16 robbery of two men outside of the 47th Avenue Valero gas station. Boyce was accused of using a semi-automatic handgun and firing as many as a dozen shots, most into the air.

 Bomb squad investigating devices found in Rio Linda home 
The sheriff&apos;s bomb squad is responding to Rio Linda after a fire led to the discovery of two potentially explosive devices in a residential garage, according to authorities.

Firefighters responded to the home on the 1000 block of Fallon Woods Way in Rio Linda and found a man who was on fire. After the fire was extinguished, the man was uncooperative and refusing treatment for his injuries, which were not serious, said Sacramento County Sheriff&apos;s Deputy Jason Ramos.

Because of his resistance, firefighters called deputies, who, upon arriving, found two potentially explosive devices in the man&apos;s garage, Ramos said. It&apos;s not clear whether those devices played a role in the fire, he said.

The Explosive Ordnance Detail is investigating the devices.

 Shots-fired call leads deputies to cache of weapons, ammo 
By Kim Minugh
 kminugh@sacbee.com 

Sacramento County sheriff&apos;s deputies responding to a fairly routine call last week came home with a not-so-routine haul: three guns, a slew of ammo and some drugs, too.

Deputies responded to the 3100 block of Laurelhurst Drive in Rancho Cordova on July 26 after callers reported shots fired from a residence. Upon arriving, they saw a man in front of the residence, who quickly fled inside, according to a sheriff&apos;s report.

Deputies followed him inside and found quite the cache: A 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun, three spent .22 casings; live .22 ammo; .38 ammo, 9 mm ammo, and .223 ammo. Outside, they found a .22 and a .38 revolver that had been thrown over a fence to an adjacent yard, the report states.

 Man stabbed multiple times in Orangevale expected to survive 
A man stabbed multiple times at an Orangevale residence following an argument this evening is expected to survive, a Sacramento County Sheriff&apos;s Department spokesman said.

Deputies have a 51-year-old suspect in custody, said sheriff&apos;s spokesman Deputy Jason Ramos, but have not released his identity.

The Sheriff&apos;s Department received a call at 6:10 p.m., from a man alleging that his roommate had just stabbed his friend in the 6700 block of Hazel Avenue, Ramos said. Responding deputies found a male in his 30s suffering from multiple stab wounds, including wounds to his chest and back.

The victim was transported to a local hospital with injuries believed to be non-life-threatening, Ramos said.

Deputies on scene were given the name and description of the suspect, who had fled on foot. At about 6:45 p.m., responding to a reported sighting of the suspect, they detained him on Potts Court, less than a mile from the scene, Ramos said.

Investigators believe the suspect and victim argued at a residence on Hazel Avenue, and that the victim left and walked to another residence down the street, Ramos said. They believe the suspect then followed the victim to that location, where the alleged stabbing occurred, he said.

 Firefighters suffer minor injuries in Rancho Cordova hazmat fire 
Two firefighters suffered minor injuries this morning during a hazardous materials incident involving pool chemicals at a waste facility in Rancho Cordova.

Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District firefighters responded at 11:15 a.m. to a report of a fire involving hazardous materials in the 11000 block of White Road Road. They arrived to find smoke and fumes coming from a hazardous waste storage area on the site, according to a district news release.

Workers told firefighters that they were repacking dry pool chemicals in a 55-gallon drum and it appeared a chemical reaction occurred, causing a small fire and what they thought was off gassing of the material.

 Body found in Lake Tahoe may be that of diver missing 17 years 
Authorities hope dental records will help determine whether the body of a diver recovered from Lake Tahoe last week is that of a man who reportedly went missing in the lake 17 years ago, an El Dorado County Sheriff&apos;s Department spokesman said.

The Sheriff&apos;s Department was alerted to the body by another diver who reported seeing it at a depth of about 265 feet, said sheriff&apos;s spokesman Lt. Bryan Golmitz.

Last Wednesday, a team from the Sheriff&apos;s Department used a remotely operated vehicle fitted with a camera to locate the body - which was still wearing dive gear - on an underwater shelf off Rubicon Point, which is near Highway 89 in South Lake Tahoe.

 National Night Out: Barbecues, ice cream and watching out for the neighbors 
By Bill Lindelof and Ryan Lillis

Tonight is National Night Out -- a time when neighbors band together in a common effort to watch out for each other.

It&apos;s an age when porch-sitting is not in style it was years ago. It&apos;s a time when homeowners hit the remote as soon as their car is parked in the garage, thereby avoiding contact with the neighbor.

But at least once a year, neighbors can re-connect on the first Tuesday in August. National Night Out is designed to heighten crime and drug prevention, strengthen neighborhoods and forge police-community partnerships.

In a blistering assessment of how badly officials bungled their oversight of rapist-kidnapper Phillip Garrido, El Dorado County prosecutors have compiled a list of dozens of instances for which his parole should have been revoked, many of them that would have saved Jaycee Lee Dugard from being abducted.

The 162-page report from El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson&apos;s office includes numerous federal and state documents that have previously surfaced since Dugard was rescued from 18 years of captivity in August 2009.

 Alexander Piggee, the troubled 24-year-old who set the $55 million blaze at the Westfield Galleria in Roseville last October, was sentenced this morning in federal court to 15 years in prison after expressing remorse for his crime.

Piggee (photo right) pleaded guilty to two counts of arson in March in a deal that avoided a trial in the case. He also faces 72 months of supervision following his release from prison.

The blaze destroyed part of the mall just as the holiday shopping season began. The fire, which began in a backpack Piggee left in a video game store closet, roared out of control after officials turned off the mall sprinkler system because of miscommunication.

 Suspects in Susanville police officer&apos;s death to stand trial 
Jane Braxton Little
Bee Correspondent

SUSANVILLE - Two suspects in the Jan. 1 murder of Robert McElrath, a Susanville police officer, are scheduled to appear for arraignment Aug. 15 on charges that they shot him in the face with his own duty weapon, then shoved his body off an out-of-service highway bridge.

The officer&apos;s estranged wife, Joanna McElrath, 36 and Robin Glen James, 46, both of Susanville, were held to answer to felony charges that include murder, conspiracy to commit murder and special allegations that the murder involved lying in wait and the use of a firearm.

Lassen County District Attorney Robert M. Burns charged that James and McElrath, the victim&apos;s estranged wife, used a prescription narcotic to drug Robert McElrath before using his own car to drive him to the bridge near Susanville, where they killed him.

Lassen County Superior Court Judge Michelle Verderosa determined that a week-long preliminary hearing produced enough evidence to try both defendants. Joanna McElrath and James have been in custody without bail since their January arrests.

No weapon was found on then-32-year-old John Hesselbein when officers searched him for the second time after the shooting.

In her 11-page letter to police Chief Robert Lehner absolving the officer of any criminal liability, Scully argued that the officer had reason to believe Hesselbein was dangerous and that the officer &quot;had the right to act in self-defense and in defense of his fellow officers.&quot;
