Tetra Algae Control review–product says it is safe for plants but it killed my pot plants!
 By Herbmaniac 
I bought this Tetra algae control solution and it killed my baby marijuana plants!
 




I decided to take my pot plants indoors when I moved away to college. They are legal in California where I am from, but where I am going to college (Virgina Tech) they are not. I don’t think they would take to kindly to it if I were to grow some pot plants outside my dorm room or anywhere else on campus out in the open. So I have to resort to indoor grows in my dorm room closet.

I did try and plant a few plants last year but the grounds people dug them up and took them away–probably to take them to their home and plant them there. I know the grounds crew here is a bunch of pot heads but they aren’t cool pot heads. Anyway, this year I decided to go hydroponic.

I figured it would be less mess–no dirt. Also hydroponic grows tend to grow much bigger and at a faster rate so I could have several harvests each year while I am at school here (at least for the next 2 years until I graduate and then I will go to Johns Hopkins for Med school). So, I got everything I needed. The plastic containers, pumps, black plastic tubing, etc…

I set it all up and then I just had to wait for the White Widow and AK-47 (you can tell I don’t mess around. I want top notch bud with the highest levels of THC) seeds I ordered from Amsterdam to be delivered to my dorm here at Virginia Tech. To make sure I didn’t get caught by the police or anything (I highly doubted this would happen as the police here are fucking stupid) I had this engineering fag I know pick it up for me (no one would miss him if he got caught and I knew he wouldn’t talk because he knew I knew he was gay and he didn’t want his parents to know).

Needless to say the seeds came without a hitch. I then placed them inside the rockwool cubes, filled the system with water and nutrients and cranked it up. It worked beautifully for a while and then out of nowhere this brown much started to show up in the container. It was brown algae and it reeked like ass.

I read that it can actually starve the roots of cuttings, seedlings and plants of all ages and I certainly didn’t want this algae ruining my babies. So I did some research and I bought this Tetra Algae Control solution. It was really cheap–$3 for a little bottle and it said all I needed to do was add one drop per gallon of water to treat the algae in an aquarium. It also said that it was safe for plants and fish so I figured it would work good in my hydroponic system to keep the algae down without hurting the plants.

I was wrong. Even at very low concentrations (one drop per gallon of water as per the directions on the Tetra Algae Control bottle) it caused my little plants that were looking healthy to wilt and then die. I tried to do early I could bring them back to life and it didn’t work. This Tetra Algae Control stuff sucks for marijuana seedlings big time.

These seeds were expensive $60 for 10. So I lost six seeds because of this Tetra algae control crap. I will do more research and find a better way to control the algae growth in my hydroponic system, but for anyone out there growing pot seedlings you need to stay away from this stuff because it will kill your plants dead.
