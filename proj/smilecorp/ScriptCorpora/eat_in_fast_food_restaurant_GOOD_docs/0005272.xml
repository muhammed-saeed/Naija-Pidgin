Best Magic Kingdom Quick Counter Service Disney World

by josh on May 25, 2010 
 
The Magic Kingdom has about eight main counter services as well as several smaller counter service locations that serve just two or three items like hot dogs or turkey legs.  The number isn’t exact because two places in particular are only open “seasonally,” which generally means “probably not open.”  Both Tomorrowland Terrace and Tortuga Tavern (formerly El Pirata y el Perico) fall into that category.  Both the Terrace and Tortuga Tavern will be left off this list because they’re so often closed and not necessarily  recommended anyway.   The food at Tortuga Tavern is decent, but it’s so rarely open that the people working don’t really know what they’re doing because they don’t have an opportunity to get the hang of it.  This means long waits for food and inconsistent quality.  The seating area is not air-conditioned, which makes for an uncomfortable experience in the heat as well.  Tomorrowland Terrace serves an odd variety of chicken nuggets and Asian inspired fast-food dishes.  The Asian dishes are generally mushy and full of salt and the chicken nuggets are nothing special.  There’s just no reason to hunt down either of these counter services even if they might be open.

 Main Street Bakery is excellent for breakfast or a mid-day treat and it is my number one rated location for using snack credits on the Disney Dining Plan.  With most items less than $4, Main Street Bakery is an excellent choice when paying out of pocket also.  Although they do serve sandwiches for lunch, I won’t be listing it below due to the fact that it isn’t set up to handle large masses like the other counter services.

Be sure to read over the full reviews for more information on any of the counter service locations listed.  You can either click here for the full list in alphabetical order or click the individual highlighted links throughout this post.

 Most Unique Menu 

1. Columbia Harbor House 

2. Cosmic Ray’s Starlight Cafe 

3. Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn&amp;Cafe 

4. Pinocchio Village Haus 

5. Casey’s Corner 

None of the Magic Kingdom counter service locations offer an inspired menu, but Columbia Harbor House does serve several unique items including a tuna sandwich, hummus sandwich, fried shrimp basket (with large shrimp), two unique salads, and clam chowder, all of which can’t be found elsewhere.  Cosmic Ray’s has a large menu, but you can still find most of the items at other locations throughout Disney World.  Pecos Bill serves the usual hamburgers, Pinocchio Village Haus serves standard Disney pizza, and Casey’s Corner only offers a hot dog or corn dog nuggets as entrées.  All in all, you’re going to be hard pressed to end up at a location that doesn’t serve Disney hamburgers or pizza.

 Best “Value” AKA The Most Expensive Meal  on the Disney Dining Plan 

1. Cosmic Ray’s (Average Entrée Cost $8.32, Most Expensive Entrée $13.99)

2. Columbia Harbor House ($8.09, $9.69)

3. Pecos Bill ($8.09, $9.09)

4. Pinocchio Village Haus ($7.93, $8.29)

5. Casey’s Corner ($5.39, $6.59)

Cosmic Ray’s is the favorite among visitors with the Disney Dining Plan because you can put together a meal with the $13.99 half chicken and rib combo plate, $2.49 soda, and $3.59 slice of cake for a total meal cost of more than $20.  This is one of the most expensive counter service meals at any of the Disney theme parks.  The next three are all similarly priced.  Only Casey’s Corner is a distinct “bargain,” at least in terms of price.

 Best Value Out of Pocket 

1. Columbia Harbor House

2. Cosmic Ray’s Starlight Café

3. Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn

4. Pinocchio Village Haus

5. Casey’s Corner

Columbia Harbor House and Cosmic Ray’s both offer entrees with large portions,  many of which could easily be shared.  Columbia Harbor House wins because its sandwiches and other items are generally fresher than Cosmic Ray’s and the fried shrimp and chicken are higher quality.  Neither Pecos Bill nor Pinocchio Village Haus is a tremendous value compared to other counter services because their menus and pricing are standard for Disney.   Casey’s Corner may offer the cheapest entrées, but the quality of the hot dogs has declined immensely in the last year or so.  The corn dog nuggets are still good, but it’s a small portion.

 Best Seating 

1. Pinocchio Village Haus

2. Cosmic Ray’s

3. Columbia Harbor House

4. Pecos Bill

5. Casey’s Corner

Pinocchio Village Haus usually has the most ample seating and some of the tables overlook the “it’s a small world” water ride next door which can be fun to watch while eating.  Many people tend to shy away from Pinocchio because it looks like it’s a tiny little place from the outside.  Don’t be fooled, it’s much larger than the storefront would lead you to believe.  Cosmic Ray’s has the largest indoor and outdoor seating area, but even then it does get full during peak meal times.  Nonetheless, if the seating is crowded at Cosmic Ray’s, you know it’s going to be even worse elsewhere.  Cosmic Ray’s also features a seating area with light entertainment performed by Sonny Eclipse, the audio-animatronic alien.  Columbia Harbor House gets busy, but there is plenty of additional seating upstairs so make sure to check if the downstairs seating area is crowded.  Pecos Bill is dark, which is nice after spending the day in the bright sun, but it’s usually a hassle to find an open table.  There just isn’t enough seating.  It got so bad that Disney was testing a program where you couldn’t sit unless your entire party was ready to be seated with food trays in hand.  They scrapped that plan and it is still more likely you’ll have trouble finding a place to sit here than the other restaurants.  Casey’s Corner’s seating area is outside and there isn’t a lot of it, which puts it in last place again.

 Best Food 

1. Columbia Harbor House

2. Cosmic Ray’s Starlight Cafe

3. Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn&amp;Cafe

4. Pinocchio Village Haus

5. Casey’s Corner

Columbia Harbor House barely wins this race, with Cosmic Ray’s and Pecos Bill a close second and third.  Even Pinocchio Village Haus isn’t a distance fourth.  The freshness of Columbia Harbor House’s sandwiches and salads and the light crispness of their fried fish and shrimp put them a cut above Cosmic Ray’s Starlight Café and Pecos Bill.  The Magic Kingdom is an even closer call because the top three counter services all serve chicken nuggets, salads, and similar sandwiches and wraps.  Since Disney owns and operates all of the counter services at the Magic Kingdom, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that they’re all similar in food quality and variety.  Pinocchio Village Haus serves pizza that’s on the same level as Pizza Planet or Pizzafari.  If you like pizza from chain pizza restaurants like Pizza Hut then you’re likely to enjoy Disney pizza. If you wouldn’t dream of ordering a Domino’s then you probably want to skip it.  Casey’s Corner, with its crumbling whole grain buns and low quality non-kosher hot dogs, is a distant fifth place.  Overall, you’ll find similar food options and quality at the top three choices and slightly different, but still decent food at Pinocchio Village Haus.

 Overall Best Counter Service at the Magic Kingdom 

1. Columbia Harbor House 

2. Cosmic Ray’s Starlight Cafe 

3. Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn&amp;Cafe 

4. Pinocchio Village Haus 

5. Casey’s Corner 

The Magic Kingdom is the only Disney World theme park where the top choices are so similar in quality, service, and selection.  If Columbia Harbor House is a B+, then Cosmic Ray’s is a B, Pecos Bill is a B-, and Pinocchio’s Village Haus is a C+.  Columbia Harbor House wins out because of its unique menu and the slightly higher quality of the unique items.  Cosmic Ray’s serves about 90% of Pecos Bill’s menu and a lot more items, including rotisserie chicken and BBQ ribs, which puts it ahead of Pecos.  If you’re on the Disney Dining Plan and want to get the most “value” for your credit then Cosmic Ray’s is the obvious choice as well, with the most expensive quick service meal at the Magic Kingdom.  If you’re planning to order a hamburger then you may want to choose Pecos Bill because it serves a “Deluxe 1/3 Pound Angus Cheeseburger” topped with bacon, onion rings, and BBQ sauce.  It’s the best burger at the Magic Kingdom.  Pinocchio Village Haus lags behind because of the blandness of the pizza and the limited menu options.  If something slathered in marinara sauce doesn’t sound appealing then you’re out of luck at Pinocchio’s, unless you love Disney’s chicken breast nuggets.  Casey’s  is the only real loser and the only one I would expressly not recommend.  The quality of the hot dogs and buns is substantially lower than it once was, making Casey’s a “dog” in its own right.

Just wanted to thank you for your Best of section. We were at WDW over the MLK weekend and ate at Cosmic Ray’s and Earl of Sandwich based solely on this site’s Best Value Out of Pocket recommendations. Both were good choices (we really loved Earl’s!). Thanks for the time you have devoted to this research and your site!

Thank you so much for this exhaustive list! It was just what I’ve been looking for. We’re headed to the World in less than two weeks and trying to get our bearings ahead of time. Your breakdowns are fantastic. Kudos!

great article. Always looking for new places to try each visit. I use to love ABC but it has declined so much in the last few years. For several years it was on our must do list. The fish and chips were very good. In 2009 was disappointed, but decided it was just an off day. Tried again in 2010. It was worse than before. Haven’t been back. Based on your review I see it still hasn’t changed. Too bad because the location and seating are excellent.
