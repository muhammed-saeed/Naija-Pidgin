 09-24-2011,  06:30 PM #1 arimuse Senior Member Join Date Jan 2011 Posts 695 now, I replied to a topic about a rude show attendant, and a lot of people said well, its a small issue. It is and it isnt. You certainly can&apos;t take it to heart, but you have to address it, here&apos;s why.
Anyone behind you who did not carry the flyer and doesn&apos;t have money for an extra ticket they were not expecting to pay will have problems so it isnt just about you, people, volunteers will get the idea they actually run things when they don&apos;t and may give out misinformation, and there may even be someone who knows the price and is skimming the door.

So, squash. last week I went and bought a few things at a local grocery. It rang to 30$ and on the way to the car I just couldnt get over the cost - I was sure I didnt buy that much. I checked the bill and they charged me 10$ over on a fresh butternut squash! and, it was on sale by a 1$ off a pound!!

The checker who rang me was busy so I went to the desk. I showed the bill, the squash (it was a small one)- the girl just looked at me, I said, excuse me, but this is only a squash, not a doubloon, and its on sale for 69C a pound and this is not a 15 pound squash.
she looked over to the checker, at which point I very calmly said in a low voice, the checker didnt miss ring this, the machine weighs it on the scan, so her machine is broken (she really should have caught that ring!) or the computer is not set right for the price.

she cleared my charge, and tried to ring it - still ringing up wrong. she called another clerk over (it really helps that PT, 17 year old HS kids are doing this job!) they ring it again - she says but thats the code it has on it. I slowly said call the produce mgr and tell him he has the wrong codes on his squash, and I stood there until they got someone from produce. And I wouldnt leave until he showed . Because, where I live, most people, if they have jobs, make no more than 10$ an hr and
this squash was on sale all week. If you dont check your bill after spending 100$ or more on groceries you dont need to be giving a store 10$ on a bill cus you thought you got a deal feeding your family fresh veggies - thats why it matters, its not just that it matters to me, it matters to all of us.

you could always go back, but with gas so high, driving back in for the correction throws it away on the gas to come and go sharet Reply With Quote 09-24-2011,  06:40 PM #2 blueangel Power Poster Join Date Dec 2010 Location Kansas Posts 19,131 Well said.

Reply With Quote 09-24-2011,  07:03 PM #4 Glassquilt Super Member Join Date May 2011 Location Northeast IL Posts 2,059 Blog Entries 1 I can remember my mom checking each item on the receipt - literally checking it off. Never thought to ask what may have happened that caused her to be so thorough. Reply With Quote 09-24-2011,  07:12 PM #5 lee_stitches Senior Member Join Date Apr 2011 Location Central Kentucky Posts 347 My mom and sisters tease me about getting in a checkout line with me. It never fails, either someone ahead of me has an issue or I get over charged for an item (and I point it out). I always pay attention and many times sale items and regular priced items ring up at the wrong price. I have been known to go get the sale sign posted over the product because a cashier will not honor the sale. I work hard for every penny that I earn and I do not feel that a huge corporation should get any more of my money than required. If everyone gets overcharged just a few cents that adds up to $$$$$$$$ for the corporation.☺Putting my soapbox away now.

I would have to remind the checkers about sales and specials. Now that my children are grown and on their own I&apos;ve noticed they also pay attention at the check out. Reply With Quote 09-24-2011,  07:17 PM #7 quiltingcandy Super Member Join Date Dec 2010 Location Chula Vista CA Posts 1,337 I try to keep track also. Mervyn&apos;s was famous for having things marked at the rack but not on the register. If you didn&apos;t watch, the clerk didn&apos;t either. They were actually caught and severely fined for their actions.

And I have contacted a local fast food restaurant on-line when I was short changed by $5.00. It was not for the $5.00 but I was concerned they had an employee that was skimming at the window. It turned out it was his first day and they offered to reimburse me, which was nice. I am the person that hands back the extra money when a clerk gives me to much and I have no trouble saying the change was wrong. But ever so often we are in too big of a hurry and do not notice it until later. Fast food places hire a lot of teens, so if they have one looking to make more than it should, then the manager needs to be notified. Reply With Quote 09-24-2011,  07:56 PM #8 DogHouseMom Super Member Join Date Jan 2011 Location Grundy Co Illinois Posts 2,861 I&apos;m guilty of not checking, and I&apos;ll only question something if is well out of line (like a $10 squash).

I TOTALLY agree with you though. The prices need to be correct for everyone and making sure that it is corrected is a community service.

Bravo.

But I have to ask (cause I&apos;m a debating kind of gal ), had the price rung up much lower, and you had noticed it, is it still a community service to get the price corrected for everyone?

Yes, it goes both ways. I can remember taking my son back with me to Walmart because they had failed to charge me for an item. Also, one night at Cracker Barrel the cashier gave me $10 too much in change. They said that if they were short $10 at the end of the night they would call me and have me bring it back. I insisted that they had made a mistake and I would not be coming back just to return $10. They closed the register to count and indeed they were short. These are two times that I remember the specifics.

I had 800$ cash and needed another 800$ for the money order to make a yearly payment on our swather for the farm. I had 8--100$ bills. I got my other 8 bills and went to the po to get the money order and mail the letter. I counted out the money for the lady at the PO and found I had 100$ extra. I said that&apos;s funny, I just got this from the bank. I said I guess I need to go back to find out if they shorted themselves. Both the &quot;NEW&quot; trainee teller and her supervisor checked the till and said no they started with this much and they ended right to the penny. So there must have been 2 --!00$ bills stuck together when the till was started. I said well if you find when you check out the whole bank tills this afternoon call me and I will come in. They never called and the next time I went in the bank--they told me every till checked out perfect with what it was supposed to be and they told me have a happy day. Wow, not often something like this happens. So I had some extra cash for some things that we really needed for the kids. Reply With Quote
