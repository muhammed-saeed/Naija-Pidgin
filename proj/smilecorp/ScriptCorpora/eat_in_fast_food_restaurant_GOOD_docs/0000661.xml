When it was the Eric Rittenhouse Square Twin, what was the seating capacities of each auditorium?

The Eric Twin Rittenhouse Square opened in 1968. Closed for remodeling on June 12, 1985. Third theatre, which was added at this time, was converted from a furniture store which was located between the two original theatres. The Rittenhouse 3 reopened on June 28, 1985. The theatres were damaged by a neighboring fire on Dec. 14, 1994 and I believe were never reopened. United Artists purchased the Sameric“Eric”chain in 1988 or 1989.

According to my records, the seating capacity of the original Eric Rittenhouse Square Twin theatres was 250 in each. Their seating would not have changed with the addition of the third screen because that was not developed by chopping up the twins.

Each original Rittenhouse Twin was the width of a typical Center City house. The story was that they could not purchase two contiguous sites, so they were separated with an old house between them. Sometimes you bought a ticket at one twin then walked to the other. Because they were so narrow, there was next to no lobby. Each twin had a small cagelike elevator. When you went in, you were encouraged to take the elevator to the third floor lounge. Then when the previous screening let out, you wouldn’t be in the way. When the theatre was empty, an usher would let you go downstairs.

When they finally acquired the middle site and built a third theatre, everything changed. The original elevators remained, but the new theatre (triplet?) didn’t have one. But the lounge spaces on the second and third floors were connected.

I lived (and worked) only a few blocks from the Rittenhouse cinemas and was probably there 50 times during my 16 years in Philadelphia.

Hello williame303.

Do you have any photos of either the Rittenhouse or Eric’s Rittenhouse Theatre’s? I’ve Google’d them both but came up empty.

Thanks in advance!

To ctano4: Sorry I don’t have any pics. I lived in Philly only from 1070 to 1986. Looking back, those were pretty good years for movies. I lived in Center City and went 3-4 times a week!

The only memory I have of this theater, and the one and only time I remember going there, was to see a film. It was in the year 1972. I had just turned 18 years of age. The film was rated X and the seating was reserved in which they assigned you a seat. I remember locating my assigned seat to view the film and saw many â€œwell to doâ€ others finding their seats. I even remember a few women with fur coats on! I mean after all it was the Rittenhouse Square Theater!
The film everyone was attending to see (if you havenâ€™t guessed it by now) wasâ€¦
â€œLast Tango In Parisâ€
I, later at the age of 19, worked in a fast food restaurant and had a special order for a roast beef sandwich to which I replied loud enough for everyone standing in line to hearâ€¦â€¦
â€œOne Last Tango In Paris Coming Upâ€¦â€¦â€¦No Butter On The Buns!â€
Only a couple of people got it, you could tell by the looks on their faces and their laughter
The others were left standing without a clue!
