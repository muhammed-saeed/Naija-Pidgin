 By Time Out Editors Posted: Oct 3 2011 
Dining at the Table is a bit like eating in a design showroom - the steel fittings, new wooden tables and clean lines create a minimalist space that&apos;s brought to life by the open kitchen. A potentially soulless vibe is avoided thanks the relaxed busyness of the engaged chefs. The sound of gentle conversation pervades the space, which is as suited to business breakfasts and sole diners as it is to couples and small groups.

Dedication to top-drawer ingredients is evident in the displays of wines, condiments and (Chegworth Valley) juices. The modern approach extends to the menu, whose contemporary British dishes - very much in the &apos;local is best&apos; camp - are infused with Mediterranean flavours.

A starter of smoked haddock was made light and fresh with mint and coriander. Sea bass stuffed with dill was perfectly complemented by chargrilled fennel and tomato, while ham hock &apos;tartine&apos; with chickpea and rose harissa salad and poached duck egg was tasty and attractively presented. Quality produce makes up for the fact that portions are on the small side. Weekend brunches, when the huge windows provide a lovely light, are a treat here.

 By Ann - Apr 23 2012 2/5 
Pretty poor service, I have eaten here once with friends and I ordered fishcake. I have found a couple of fish bones in my food and I accident swallowed one. When I pointed this out to the waiter, they said it was my bad luck. And you can expect bones in their fish cakes. Well, first of all, fish cake is a processed food which means you would normally expect the fish to have been de-boned. Secondly, it was not disclose anywhere in the restaurant or menu that you can expect bone from the fishcake. And lastly, they didnt even tell the Chef about this. It was just assumed that I am wrong/had bad luck! Food was okay but overall service is pretty poor!

Great for brunch; there was a good selection and it took a while to decide but there were no regrets for having settled on the full English followed by some banana bread - good quality and tasty. The service was friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere relaxed. Lovely cappuccinos too.

Mmmm best brunch ive had for a while. In a moment of gluttony ordered the full English with poached eggs and a little hollandaise on the side and was not disappointed. Very friendly service makes a great start to a Saturday.
