Owning and managing a fast food restaurant is a small business concept with numerous start-up and expansion options. Prospective owners can choose to take over an existing business, build a fast food restaurant from the ground up or buy into a franchise, which will provide instantaneous name recognition. Owning and managing a fast food restaurant is much like any small business ownership in which research and planning are crucial for success.
 
Step 1

Decide which of the three approaches to fast food restaurant ownership you want to pursue and conduct feasibility research about start-up and operating costs.
 
Step 2

Develop a business plan. A business plan outlines each step of your business start-up and helps you estimate costs, project revenue and determine your target market. Secure all necessary business licenses and operating permits required by your city, county or state.
 
Step 3

Inquire at your local health department about regulations concerning the food service industry in your city and make arrangements for required licenses and permits. You will also have to undergo health department inspections before opening and periodically while your business is operational.
 
Step 4

Find a suitable location for your fast food restaurant that is in a visible, high-traffic, easily accessed area that is not inundated with similar restaurants. If you&apos;re buying a franchise, assistance in this area will be provided for you. If you&apos;re building from the ground up, a licensed general contractor who specializes in restaurant construction can be of assistance. If you&apos;re looking for a building site or an existing restaurant, a licensed and reputable commercial real estate professional can provide you with information about purchasing availability.
 
Step 5

Secure start-up funding. Consider applying for a loan with a bank that promotes small businesses or contact the U.S. Small Business Administration to learn about small business loan programs.
 
Step 6

Purchase all necessary equipment including ovens, stoves, fryers, refrigerators, booth and table seating, cash registers and fixtures. Find reputable food and beverage vendors and order food inventory. Open a business bank account and establish a payroll and accounting system.
 
Step 7

Hire and train staff. Teenagers are often hired to work in fast food restaurants, but most need flexible schedules because of school attendance.
 
Step 8

Advertise and promote your restaurant through mediums including social media, television, radio and print advertising. Consider partnering with schools or sponsoring sports teams to draw in large groups of customers.
 
Step 9

Ensure your fast food restaurant meets health codes at all times regarding cleanliness, food temperature, storage facilities and employee hygiene. Employ a purchasing manager to ensure that you always have adequate amounts of food on hand, but not too much that you are subject to spoilage and waste.
 
Step 10

Provide employees with ongoing training in customer service and conduct periodic customer satisfaction surveys to look for ways to improve your operation.
