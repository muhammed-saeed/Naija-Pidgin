 Study: Teacher&apos;s gender affects learning 
By BEN FELLER, AP Education Writer 
WASHINGTON - For all the differences between the sexes, here&apos;s one that might stir up debate in the teacher&apos;s 

 lounge: Boys learn more from men and girls learn more from women.

That&apos;s the upshot of a provocative study by Thomas Dee, an associate professor of economics at Swarthmore 

 College and visiting scholar at Stanford University. His study was to appear Monday in Education Next, a quarterly 

 journal published by the Hoover Institution. 

 Vetted and approved by peer reviewers, Dee&apos;s research faces a fight for acceptance. Some leading education 

 advocates dispute his conclusions and the way in which he reached them. 

 But Dee says his research supports his point, that gender matters when it comes to learning. Specifically, as he 

 describes it, having a teacher of the opposite sex hurts a student&apos;s academic progress. 

 &quot;We should be thinking more carefully about why,&quot;he said. 

 Dee warns against drawing fast conclusions based on his work. He is not endorsing single-sex education, or any 

 other policy. 

 Rather, he hopes his work will spur more research into gender&apos;s effect and what to do about it. 

 His study comes as the proportion of male teachers is at its lowest level in 40 years. Roughly 80 percent of teachers 

 in U.S. public schools are women. 

 Dee&apos;s study is based on a nationally representative survey of nearly 25,000 eighth-graders that was conducted by 

 the Education Department in 1988. Though dated, the survey is the most comprehensive look at students in middle 

 school, when gender gaps emerge, Dee said. 

 He examined test scores as well as self-reported perceptions by teachers and students. Dee found that having a 

 female teacher instead of a male teacher raised the achievement of girls and lowered that of boys in science, social 

 studies and English. 

 Looked at the other way, when a man led the class, boys did better and girls did worse. 

 The study found switching up teachers actually could narrow achievement gaps between boys and girls, but one 

 gender would gain at the expense of the other. 

 Dee also contends that gender influences attitudes. 

 For example, with a female teacher, boys were more likely to be seen as disruptive. Girls were less likely to be 

 considered inattentive or disorderly. 

 In a class taught by a man, girls were more likely to say the subject was not useful for their future. They were less 

 likely to look forward to the class or to ask questions. 

 Dee said he isolated a teacher&apos;s gender as an influence by accounting for several other factors that could affect 

 student performance. But his study is sure to be scrutinized. 

 &quot;The data, as he presents them, are far from convincing,&quot;said Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National 

 Women&apos;s Law Center, which works to advance the progress of women. 

 Greenberger said she found Dee&apos;s conclusions to be questionable and inconsistent. More broadly, she said, boys 

 and girls benefit by having male and female teachers as role models. 

 &quot;I don&apos;t think there are many parents or students, looking back over their educational careers, who haven&apos;t been 

 inspired by a teacher of the opposite sex,&quot;she said. 

 &quot;And many have had very unhappy experiences with teachers of the same gender that they are. We have to be 

 careful of too many generalizations,&quot;Greenberger said. 

 Student success cannot be narrowed to the gender of the teacher, said Reg Weaver, president of the National 

 Education Association, the country&apos;s largest teachers&apos; union. 

 Experienced teachers, good textbooks, smaller class sizes and modern equipment all influence how boys and girls 

 do in class, Weaver said. 

 &quot;Students benefit by having exposure to teachers who look like them, who can identify with their culture ... but this is 

 just one variable among many,&quot;Weaver said. 

 Dee said his research raises valid questions. 

 Should teachers get more training about the learning styles of boys and girls? Should they be taught to combat 

 biases in what they expect of boys and girls? 

 In the nature-nurture debate, he said, teacher gender belongs. 

 &quot;Some people will react strongly to this,&quot;he said.&quot;But I&apos;ve taken pains to explain that we need to be cautious about 

 drawing policy conclusions. As provocative as this all might seem, I really haven&apos;t gotten that much negative 

 feedback.&quot;

DISABLED KIDS SUE SCHOOLS 


By DAVID ANDREATTA New York Post

August 24, 2006 -- Just in time for the new school year, the city Department of Education has been slapped with a

class-action lawsuit that alleges a new policy cheats disabled students of required services.

The complaint, filed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court, charges that the agency last year began illegally cutting off

services to disabled students when disputes about the services arose between parents and the department.

According to the complaint, federal law requires that disabled students continue with their education program

pending the outcome of a dispute. Last year saw more than 5,000 such disputes.

But Gary Mayerson, lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the new policy requires parents to request a departmental hearing

to ensure that their child continues to receive the services.

Education spokeswoman Kelly Devers said she could not comment on pending litigation.

Many parents lack skills to help with homework 

Survey finds seven in 10 wary of helping children
Adults urged to brush up basic maths and English

Rebecca Smithers, education editor
Wednesday August 23, 2006
The Guardian


Many parents admit they are baffled by their children&apos;s homework and lack the confidence to help out as much as 

 they would like, according to a survey published today. 

 Nearly one in five parents said they were regularly surprised by the difficulty of the work their children brought home 

 to complete, the survey commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills found. And nearly seven out of 

 10 
said they would spend more time helping with homework if they were more confident in their own abilities in 

 maths and English.

The survey, carried out for the government&apos;s Get On campaign, which encourages adults to brush up their basic 

 skills, is calling on parents to gain the confidence to help their children by signing up for a free course. More than 

 nine 
out of 10 parents agreed that helping their children at home made a difference to their academic achievements 

 at school.

The survey is published the day before the publication of GCSE results and amid fresh concerns about whether the 

 education system gives young people sufficient grounding in basic, but essential, literacy and numeracy skills. 

 According 
to official figures, 5.2 million adults lack the English skills expected of a 14-year-old and 14.9 million 

 would be unable to match a typical 14-year-old at maths.

Phil Hope, minister for skills, said:&quot;There are still many adults who struggle with their maths and English skills and 

 as a result may experience difficulties in helping their children with homework. This doesn&apos;t have to be the case - 

 there are hundreds of free courses up and down the country where adults can brush up their maths and English 

 skills in a friendly, supportive environment. As a dad I&apos;m fully aware of what a difference it can make to be able to 

 help 
your children with their learning, so I call on all parents to think about whether they could benefit from improving 

 their skills a little.&quot;

More than half (53%) of the parents say they help their children with homework&quot;every day&quot;. But 2% admit they 

 &quot;never help&quot;their children.

Meanwhile, employers today issue a stark warning to young people that they risk becoming unemployable without 

 minimum qualifications and urge those who do not make the grade to stay in education or training to boost their 

 prospects. An 
estimated one in 20 16-year-olds left school this year without a GCSE or other qualification.

Research from the Learning and Skills Council reveals that more than one in five (22%) of employers say they 

 would not recruit people with fewer than five good GCSEs or the vocational equivalent and 15% ignore CVs if the 

 job applicant 
does not have these essential qualifications.

The survey follows a report earlier this week from the CBI, which revealed that too many teenagers were leaving 

 school barely able to write or add up. The LSC&apos;s research shows that for those who do not stay at school or college 

 and do 
find a job, the prospects are bleak.

Of the three-quarters (74%) of employers who would recruit someone with fewer than five good GCSEs, close to 

 half (47%) would offer only unskilled positions with low pay and limited prospects. On average, employers say they 

 would pay a 
starting salary 1,700 higher if a person had five A*-C GCSEs or vocational equivalent, compared with 

 someone without these qualifications plus experience.

 Governor proposes dropout age of 18 

Chip Scutari
The Arizona Republic
Aug. 23, 2006 12:00 AM

Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano wants Arizona teenagers to stay in school until they are 18 or until they graduate 

 as one of the key ways to modernize and revamp the state&apos;s educational system.

Napolitano, who is pushing a national plan to retool America&apos;s classrooms, said raising the dropout age to 18 from 1 

 6 is part of an overall strategy to meet the changing needs of a competitive workplace.

The dropout age was one of eight recommendations Napolitano gave Tuesday to her P-20 Council, a statewide 

 effort to unify educational improvements and reforms from preschool through graduate school. The group, which 

 includes top 
educators, university presidents and business leaders, will report to Napolitano in October 

 advertisement.

Referring to raising the minimum dropout age, Napolitano said:&quot;It seems to me . . . we have to give this a very hard, 

 hard look. Other states are looking at doing this. It seems to me that you have to throw these ideas out on the 
table 

 so they can be discussed. We can&apos;t keep doing everything we&apos;ve been doing for the last 100 years. Economic 

 competition is not going to get any less over time.&quot;

Napolitano also told the group she wants it to consider making every public school offer students the chance to take 

 algebra in eighth grade. She also wants to increase the number of math and science teachers in Arizona and 

 improve 
access to four-year college degree programs.

The Center for the Future of Arizona, a Phoenix-based, non-profit organization that studies dropout rates, said 13 

 states have a minimum dropout age of 18. The organization also noted there are benefits that come with keeping 

 kids in 
high school longer.

&quot;The bottom line is that there is evidence that it can be helpful in reducing the dropout rate and possibly increasing 

 graduation rates,&quot;said Sybil Francis, executive director.&quot;It&apos;s a valuable thing to do as an educational-reform 

 package. And for reasons we don&apos;t totally understand, it seems to have more of an impact on minorities.&quot;

Arizona schools chief Tom Horne applauded Napolitano&apos;s education goals, but he wants to keep the dropout age at 

 16.

&quot;My solution to the dropout problem is to persuade kids to stay in school with things like outside mentoring and peer 

 counseling,&quot;said Horne, a Republican.&quot;If they don&apos;t want to be at school, they can be disruptive. Kids who are 17 

 and 18 who don&apos;t want to be in a certain place can create a lot of havoc. In some cases, it&apos;s better for kids to work 

 and then realize they need to come back to school.&quot;

Napolitano said Arizona could look at alternative curricula and focus on identifying at-risk youths earlier in their 

 school careers before they become disruptive. She said some of these ideas could turn into legislation next year but 
first they must be fleshed out.

Arizona law now says a student should attend school through age 16 but certain exemptions are allowed.

Every class of students statewide loses more than 20,000 members from the time the youngsters start school 

 through high school.

As head of the National Governors Association, Napolitano launched&quot;Innovation America&quot;earlier this month to 

 align school curriculum with an ultra-competitive 21st-century workforce.

&quot;All of this is fundamental to improving education in Arizona,&quot;Napolitano said.&quot;We can take the best advice we can 

 get and move forward.&quot;

 One in 20 leave school without any qualifications 
By Richard Garner, Education Editor
Published: 22 August 2006
Thirty thousand youngsters will have left school this summer with nothing to show for 11 years of compulsory 

 schooling, the Prince&apos;s Trust reveals today.

One in 20 school leavers will not have achieved a single GCSE pass when results are published on Thursday. 

 Despite vigorous attempts to raise standards in recent years the number has remained constant.

The figure is revealed a day after the Confederation of British Industry warned that one in three businesses were 

 sending staff for remedial lessons because they had not been properly taught to read, write or add up.

Research carried out by the Prince&apos;s Trust shows that 46 per cent of unemployed youngsters put their problems 

 down to a lack of qualifications and that teenagers from the poorest homes are most likely to leave school with no 

 exam passes. They revealed that the 35 education authorities considered to be the most deprived had made the 

 least progress in reducing the figures.

To tackle the problem, the Trust is launching a national qualification for 16 to 25-year-olds - a certificate in personal, 

 teamwork and community skills - in a bid to restore their confidence. Ms Hamden said:&quot;This will help thousands of 

 young people avoid a lifetime of struggling to find work.&quot;

For the first time this year ministers will be collecting figures for youngsters with five top-grade passes, including 

 maths and English, after concerns that many schools are ignoring the basic three R&apos;s.

Exam results are expected to show a similar rise to 2005 in students achieving five top grade A* to C grade passes. 

 Last year saw the biggest rise for 13 years, from 59.1 per cent to 61.1 per cent. The overall GCSE pass rate is 

 expected to stay at 97.8 per cent.

 Researchers Gain Insight Into Why Brain Areas Fail To Work 

 Together in Autism 

Basis Identified For Why People With Autism Think In Pictures

Researchers have found in two studies that autism may involve a lack of connections and coordination in separate

areas of the brain.

In people with autism, the brain areas that perform complex analysis appear less likely to work together during

problem solving tasks than in people who do not have the disorder, report researchers working in a network

funded by the National Institutes of Health. The researchers found that communications between these

higher-order centers in the brains of people with autism appear to be directly related to the thickness of the

anatomical connections between them.

In a separate report, the same research team found that, in people with autism, brain areas normally

associated with visual tasks also appear to be active during language-related tasks, providing evidence to

explain a bias towards visual thinking common in autism.

&quot;These findings provide support to a new theory that views autism as a failure of brain regions to communicate

with each other,&quot;said Duane Alexander, M.D., Director of NIH&apos;s National Institute of Child Health and Human

Development.&quot;The findings may one day provide the basis for improved treatments for autism that stimulate

communication between brain areas.&quot;

The studies and the theory are the work of Marcel Just, Ph.D., D.O. Hebb Professor of Psychology at Carnegie

Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Nancy Minshew, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology

at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and their colleagues.

The research was conducted by the Collaborative Program of Excellence in Autism, a research network funded

by the NICHD and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.

People with autism often have difficulty communicating and interacting socially with other people. The saying

&quot;unable to see the forest for the trees&quot;describes how people with autism frequently excel at details, yet struggle

to comprehend the larger picture. For example, some children with autism may become spelling bee champions,

but have difficulty understanding the meaning of a sentence or a story.

An earlier finding by these researchers described how a group of people with autism tended to use parts of the

brain typically associated with processing shapes to remember letters of the alphabet. A news release detailing

that finding appears at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/new/releases/final_autism.cfm.

Participants with autism in both current studies had normal I.Q. There were no significant differences between the

participants with and without autism in age or I.Q.

The first of the two new studies recently was published online in the journal Cerebral Cortex. In that study, the

researchers used a brain imaging technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to view

the brains of people with autism as well as a comparison group of people who do not have autism. All of the study

participants were asked to complete the Tower of London test. The task involves moving three balls into a specified

arrangement in an array of three receptacles. The Tower of London is used to gauge the functioning of the prefrontal

cortex.

This brain area, located in the front, upper part of the brain, deals with strategic planning and problem-solving. The

prefrontal cortex is the executive area of the brain, in which decision making, judgment, and impulse control reside.

A little further back is the parietal cortex, which controls high-level visual thinking and visual imagery, supporting the

visual aspects of the problem-solving. Both the prefrontal and parietal cortex play a critical part in performing the

Tower of London test.

In the normal participants, the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex tended to function in synchrony (increasing and

decreasing their activity at the same time) while solving the Tower of London task. This suggests that the two brain

areas were working together to solve the problem.

In the participants with autism, however, the two brain areas, prefrontal and parietal, were less likely to function in

synchrony while working on the task.

The researchers made another discovery, for the first time finding a relationship between this lower level of synchrony

and the properties of some of the neurological&quot;cables&quot;or white matter fiber tracts that connect brain areas.

White matter consists of fibers that, like cabling, connect brain areas. The largest of the white matter tracts is known

as the corpus callosum, which allows communication between the two hemispheres (halves) of the brain.

&quot;The size of the corpus callosum was smaller in the group with autism, suggesting that inter-regional brain cabling is

disrupted in autism,&quot;Dr. Just said.

In essence, the extent to which the two key brain areas (prefrontal and parietal) of the autistic participants worked in

synchrony was correlated with the size of the corpus callosum. The smaller the corpus callosum, the less likely the two

areas were to function in synchrony. In the normal participants, however, the size of the corpus callosum did not appear

to be correlated with the ability of the two areas to work in synchrony.

&quot;This finding provides strong evidence that autism is a disorder involving the biological connections and the coordination o

f processing between brain areas,&quot;Dr. Just said.

He added, however, that the thickness, or extent, of connections between brain areas may not be the basis for the disorder.

Although the neurological connections between the prefrontal cortex appear to be reduced in autism, the brains of people

with autism have thicker connections between certain brain regions within each hemisphere.

&quot;At this point, we can say that autism appears to be a disorder of abnormal neurological and informational connections of

the brain, but we can&apos;t yet explain the nature of that abnormality,&quot;Dr. Just said.

In the second study, published online in the journal Brain, the researchers examined the extent to which brain areas involved

in language interact with brain regions that process images. Dr. Just explained that earlier studies, as well as anecdotal

accounts, suggest that people with autism rely more heavily on visual and spatial areas of the brain than do other people.

In this study, the researchers used fMRI to examine brain functioning in participants with autism and in normal participants

during a true-false test involving reading sentences with low imagery content and high imagery content. A typical low imagery

sentence consisted of constructions like&quot;Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are all math skills.&quot;A high imagery sentence,

&quot;The number eight when rotated 90 degrees looks like a pair of eyeglasses,&quot;would first activate left prefrontal brain areas

involved with language, and then would involve parietal areas dealing with vision and imagery as the study participant mentally

manipulated the number eight.

As the researchers expected, the visual brain areas of the normal participants were active only when evaluating sentences

with imagery content. In contrast, the visual centers in the brains of participants with autism were active when evaluating both

high imagery and low imagery sentences.

&quot;The heavy reliance on visualization in people with autism may be an adaptation to compensate for a diminished ability to

call on prefrontal regions of the brain,&quot;Dr. Just said.

The second study also confirmed the observations in the first study-that the prefrontal and parietal brain regions of the cortex

in people with autism were less likely to work in synchrony than were the brains of normal volunteers. The second study also

confirmed that the extent to which the two parts of the cortex could work together was correlated with the size of the corpus

callosum that connected them.

Dr. Just and his colleagues are conducting additional studies to ascertain the nature of the abnormality of the connections in

the brains of people with autism.

 It Takes More Than Schools to Close Achievement Gap 


By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO
Published: August 9, 2006

WHEN the federal Education Department recently reported that children in private schools generally did

no better than comparable students at public schools on national tests of math and reading, the findings

were embraced by teachers unions and liberals, and dismissed by supporters of school voucher programs.

But for many educators and policy makers, the findings raised a haunting question: What if the impediments

to learning run so deep that they cannot be addressed by any particular kind of school or any set of

in-school reforms? What if schools are not the answer?

The question has come up before. In 1966, Prof. James S. Coleman published a Congressionally mandated

study on why schoolchildren in minority neighborhoods performed at far lower levels than children in white areas.

To the surprise of many, his landmark study concluded that although the quality of schools in minority

neighborhoods mattered, the main cause of the achievement gap was in the backgrounds and resources

of families.

For years, education researchers have argued over his findings. Conservatives used them to say that the

quality of schools did not matter, so why bother offering more than the bare necessities? Others, including

some educators, used them essentially to write off children who were harder to educate.

The No Child Left Behind law, enacted in 2002, took a stand on this issue. The law, one instance in which

President Bush and Congressional Democrats worked together, rests on the premise that schools make

the crucial difference. It holds a school alone responsible if the students whatever social, economic,

physical or intellectual handicaps they bring to their classrooms fail to make sufficient progress every year.

Yet a growing body of research suggests that while schools can make a difference for individual students,

the fabric of childrens lives outside of school can either nurture, or choke, what progress poor children do

make academically.

At Johns Hopkins University, two sociologists, Doris Entwisle and Karl Alexander, collected a trove of data

on Baltimore schoolchildren who began first grade in 1982. They found that contrary to expectations,

children in poverty did largely make a year of progress for each year in school.

But poor children started out behind their peers, and the problems compounded when school ended for the

summer. Then, middle-class children would read books, attend camp and return to school in September

more advanced than when they left. But poorer children tended to stagnate. The long summer break is

especially hard for disadvantaged children, Professor Alexander said. Some school is good, and more is

better.

Family really is important, and its very hard for schools to offset or compensate fully for family disadvantage,

he said.

In Chicago, a court order to empty public housing projects, which dispersed families and children into the suburbs,

led to a rise in childrens academic achievement.

The evidence is pretty clear that the better their housing, the better kids do on tests, said Jack Jennings,

president of the Center on Education Policy, a nonpartisan group.

In his 2004 book, Class and Schools: Using Social, Economic and Educational Reform to Close the

Black-White Achievement Gap, Richard Rothstein, a former writer of this column, argues that reforms

aimed at education alone are doomed to come up short, unless they are tied to changes in economic and social

policies to lessen the gaps children face outside the classroom.

A lack of affordable housing makes poorer children more transient, and so more prone to switch schools midyear,

losing progress. Higher rates of lead poisoning, asthma and inadequate pediatric care also fuel low achievement,

along with something as basic as the lack of eyeglasses. Even the way middle- and lower-class parents read to

their children is different, he writes, making learning more fun and creative for wealthier children.

I would never say public schools cant do better, Mr. Rothstein said. Id say they cant do much better, unless

lawmakers address the social ills caused by poverty.

FOR many children in America, public schools are not lacking. A 2001 international reading test put Americans

ninth out of students in 35 nations. But only students in Sweden, the Netherlands and England had scores more

than marginally higher than the United States average.

More important, the average score of the 58 percent of American students attending schools that were not

predominantly poor surpassed that of Sweden, the top-scoring nation.

But for the 42 percent of American students attending the poor schools that are the principal target of No

Child Left Behind, the inequities remain. Blacks and Latinos lag more than two years behind white students

in math on national assessment tests. In reading, which is more influenced by family background, blacks

and Latinos fall three years behind whites.

Yet these gaps have shrunk considerably since 1992, when blacks were 3.5 years behind whites in math.

Since 1973, when the federal government began collecting these scores, black 9-year-olds have gained

roughly 3.5 grade levels in math, narrowing the achievement gap, even though white scores were also rising

at the same time. The cause of these improvements is unclear, although some are most likely related to state

efforts, especially in the last 15 years.

A $100 million school voucher bill sponsored by Republicans gives vouchers a prominent place in next years

debate over renewing No Child Left Behind. But other voices are likely to call for a sense of responsibility for

improving childrens academic success that does not begin and end at the schoolhouse door.

It cant just be a burden on the schools to do away with social inequality, said Mr. Jennings, of the education

policy center. It has to be a burden on all of us.

Using a Parent Provided Sensory Integration Program to Lesson

the Stereotypical Behaviors of Children with Asperger&apos;s Syn drome 

 Monday, August 7, 2006
by Analisa L. Smith

The study examined the impact of sensory treatment options and was designed to determine if participants with 

 Asperger&apos;s
Syndrome would display fewer stereotypical behaviors after implementation of a Sensory Integration 

 Program and exhibit
increased academic function and social development. Children with Asperger&apos;s participated in 

 home-based Sensory
Integration activities for ten weeks. Pre and post-test Sensory Profiles were completed by 

 parents and teachers to measure
decreases of sensory deficits. Parent completed Sensory Profiles showed a 

 statistically significant decrease in sensory
deficits. Results provided needed groundwork information re a promising 

 method of treatment for sensory deficits in children
with Asperger&apos;s Syndrome.

 Problem and Significance 

Asperger (1944) identified Asperger&apos;s Syndrome (AS). Children with Asperger&apos;s have sensory deficits that lead to 

 sensory
integration dysfunctions (Ayers, 2004). The sensory deficits of Asperger&apos;s children limit their academic and 

 social
development and could be eased by a Sensory Integration Program ( S I P) . This study measured the effects 

 of a S I P on
the sensory deficits of children with AS. 
Dysfunction of sensory integration limits the Asperger&apos;s child 

 response to the environment (Mailloux, 2001). Research does
suggests that children with AS have Sensory 

 Integration
Dysfunction (SID). Research was needed to delineate correlations between S I Ps with children with AS 

 and the reduction of
sensory deficits.

 Literature Review 

Characteristics . Asperger&apos;s (1991) studied the social and learning development of children which the symptoms of 

 AS.
Mailloux (2001) noted that Asperger focused on the AS child&apos;s inability to read facial expressions and understand 

 social concepts. Asperger (1991) acknowledged the AS child had sensory processing deficits that limited access to 

 learning opportunities and delayed social development (Falk-Ross, Iverson, Gilbert, 2004).
Diagnostic Criteria . For 

 awhile, the medical community did not recognize the disorder as a separate disorder from autism(Myles&amp;Simpson, 

 2002). There were attempts made to develop diagnostic scales for diagnosis based on symptoms (Szatmari, 
1991; 

 Gillberg&amp;Gillberg, 1989).

Diagnostic rating scales have the following criteria:

A. preoccupation with stereotypic patterns of behavior.

B. social qualitative impairment or emotional reciprocity.

C. no delays in oral language acquisition exist.

D. definitive impairment in social and/or occupational areas of life functioning (Attwood, 1998; Myles&amp;Simpson, 

 2002).

Prevalence . Asperger&apos;s Syndrome has a prevalence rate in children of 9 out of 2500 births (Cumine, Leach,&amp; 

 Levinson, 1998). The ratio of boys to girls is found to be 9:1. Once diagnostic rating scales for AS can be universally agreed 
upon

(Attwood, 1998) there will be a uniform prevalence rate.

Etiology and Co-Occurrence . The exact cause of Asperger&apos;s is not known (Courchesne&amp;Pierce, 2000). Lincoln and 

 colleagues (1998) reported that AS was caused by abnormal brain development. Courchesne and Pierce (2000) 

 reported that Asperger patients have severe neurological abnormalities of the brain. Asperger (1944) noted a genetic 

 link in his patients occurring between the male members of families. Genetic transmission of AS is plausible. Also, a 

 large number 
of children with AS are diagnosed with other disabilities (Ozbayrak, 2004). Sensory Processing 

 Difficulties . Many researchers have identified children with AS have sensory processing difficulties (Attwood, 1998). 

 Sensory processing 
difficulties are still not used as a criterion for disorder diagnoses. Smith-Myles (2000) reflects 

 that the child with Asperger&apos;s engages in self-stimulatory behaviors that limit developmental skills. It is sensory 

 processing 
limitations that do not allow the AS child to access maximal learning and delays the child&apos;s social 

 development (Ayers, 2004; Grandin, 1990). Sensory Integration Dysfunction . Sensory Integration (SI) involves the 

 stimulation of 
neuronal response mechanisms to sensory stimuli with the expressed intent of maturizing this aspect of 

 brain function (Kranowitz, 2006). SID is the opposite of SI (Ayers, 2004). A child with SID is unable to learn to full 

 potential and 
has delayed social development (Ayers, 2004). The Asperger&apos;s child needs to be taught to manipulate 

 the sensory systems (Falk-Ross, 2004) to maximize learning potential and social development (Smith-Myles, et al., 

 2000).
Summary . Children with AS display symptoms that are universal to other disabilities (Attwood, 1998) and are 

 often misdiagnosed. Since it appears that all children with AS have some form of sensory deficits ( Myles&amp;Simpson, 

 2002 ), 
it may be assumed that all children with an AS diagnosis will have SID (Ayers, 2004). A S I P would be 

 beneficial to them (Ayers, 2004; ).

 Methodology 

Study Design . This quantitative study documented the effects of a parent implemented S I P upon children with AS. 

 All information was gathered using the Sensory Profile and classroom observations.

Participants . There were two child participants that attended a private, special education school. Parents and 

 teachers of child participants were also participants. Measurement Instrument . The Sensory Profile was used in this 

 quantitative study to measure levels of sensory processing skills. This measurement instrument was chosen because 

 of allowance of assessment of sensory deficits by school personnel and caregivers. The Sensory Profile was 

 completed by 
the participants&apos; teachers and parent pre and post implementation of the SIP. 

 Procedures 

The participating school was contacted to solicit participants. The research sample was drawn from students at the 

 host school. All AS participants&apos; parents completed the Sensory Profile, a demographic form, and consent forms. 

 Teachers 
completed a Sensory Profile. P articipants were observed before pre and post implementation of the S I P . 

 A t-test assessed the statistically significant changes in behavior as a result of the S I P . Parents engaged in SI with 

 children three times weekly, thirty minutes per time, for ten weeks. Frequency charts were completed.

Data Processing/Analyses . Raw scores from each of the nine sections of the Sensory Profile were gathered in pre- 

 and post-test applications to use for comparison. Demographic data was analyzed. A paired t-test was used to 

 compare pre- 
and post-test raw scores of the profiles of each participant. Participants were observed for a thirty 

 minute period within respective instructional environments at the beginning and the end of the SIP. Tally frequencies 

 were compared 
with those from the initial observation.

 Results 

Participant Descriptive . There were two child participants. The limits of the sample size were relevant to the nature 

 and size of the evident population. Participants engaged in a parent provided S I P for ten weeks and were evaluated 

 by parents and teachers using the Sensory Profile. All participants were Caucasian. Both participants had Attention 

 Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and took medicine for ADHD. Parents took the children off medications before 

 the 
study was completed. One child received occupational therapy (OT). Each child did have an Individualized 

 Education Plan through the host school to meet their individual academic needs.

 Research Question and Hypothesis 

The following research question and hypothesis served as the basis for this study:

-Will the use of a Sensory Integration Program, implemented by parents, reduce the stereotypic behaviors that limit 

 the academic and social success of children with Asperger&apos;s Syndrome?

It was hypothesized that children with AS will display fewer stereotypic behaviors associated with their diagnosis 

 after implementation of Sensory Integration.

The study obtained mixed results. T-charts from the parent test results indicated significant gains, p=0.001 and 

 p=0.00. These test results did support the hypothesis. The teacher completed Sensory Profile t-chart results for 

 each 
participant did not indicate a significant decrease in stereotypical behaviors. A slight decrease was indicated for 

 each participant. The t-chart comparison of the teacher pre and posttests yielded results of p=0.398 and p=0.153. 

 The 
teacher t-chart results did not support the hypothesis. Results gathered from the classroom observations 

 showed no significant decrease in stereotypical behaviors. Classroom observation results did not support the 

 hypothesis.

D iscussion 

Interpretation . This study yielded mixed results. The results of the pre and posttests parent completed Sensory 

 Profile results of this study did support the hypothesis to a statistically significant degree. Teacher completed 

 Sensory 
Profiles and academic observations did not support the hypothesis to a statistically significant degree, but 

 there was a slight indication of positive success.

More improvement was found in the scores of parent completed Sensory Profiles that teacher completed Sensory 

 Profiles for both participants. An explanation for the difference in scores could be attributed to the Hawthorne effect. 

 The 
child participants may also have shown greater improvement in the home environment due to the vested interest 

 of the parent. The statistically significant improvement of the parent Sensory Profiles warrants further research into 

 the 
use of parent implemented S I Ps with children with AS.

 Limitations 

 The study involved a small volunteer convenience sample. Both participants were Caucasian and from 

 middle class families. Such demographic data affects the study&apos;s generalizability. One of the children who participated 

 in 
the study was receiving OT. The design of this study was arranged in a way not to have a comparison group of 

 non-disabled children of the same age range. Future research is recommended to include comparison between 

 groups of children 
that allows for a matched comparison of non-disabled children to those with AS. The children in 

 the study were taking medication for ADHD. Both sets of parents had chosen to take their children off the 

 medications. Discontinuing the 
usage of the medication could have impacted the outcome of the scores. To minimize 

 for such potential statistical anomalies, the small set of samples scores were compared side by side using a paired 

 t-test. 

 Future Research 

 It is recommended that future research replicate the conditions of the present study with a larger population sample 

 and extended for a longer period of time to increase generalizability and statistical relevance. 
Further research needs 

 to be conducted to allow for a comparison children with AS with sensory deficits and nondisabled children. 

 Comparative research should be conducted with AS children that receive OT compared children with AS that 
do not. 

 Comparative research should be conducted on groups with medication and without to examine the effects of 

 medication on sensory deficits. Research should review the reliability of the use of parent evaluations when 

 examining 
sensory deficits of children with AS to document the reliability thereof. Research must continue to find 

 effective evaluation tools and treatments for the stereotypical behaviors associated with Asperger&apos;s Syndrome.

 U.S. Issues New Rules on Schools and Disability 


By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO
Published: August 4, 2006

WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 For more than 25 years, federal law had required that schools nationwide identify

children as learning disabled by comparing their scores on intelligence tests with their academic achievement.

This meant that many students had to wait until third or fourth grade to get the special education help they needed.

In regulations issued today after changes to the law, the federal Education Department said states could not require

school districts to rely on that method, allowing districts to find other ways to determine which children are eligible for

extra help.

It was the final step in the federal governments repudiation of the old approach, which had come under severe

criticism from advocates for children with disabilities, testing experts and eventually federal officials themselves.

Advocates for those children applauded the change.

If you talk to principals and special ed directors, there is pent-up demand for better ways to serve struggling kids

than waiting until they crash and burn in third and fourth grade, said James H. Wendorf, executive director of the

National Center for Learning Disabilities. The new rules also require schools to alert parents as they begin exploring

whether children may need special education, another change that won praise from advocates for children with disabilities.

The regulations come after Congress updated laws covering special education for some six million schoolchildren

nationwide in late 2004.

Comparing intelligence tests with academic achievement, known as the discrepancy model, came under intense

criticism in the debates over the law and over special education.

Federal officials and advocates for children with disabilities contended that the practice of waiting for children to fall

behind on tests in third or fourth grade before getting them extra help consigned them to failure, and opened the way

for the disproportionate numbers of poor and minority children to be labeled as needing special education.

The 2004 law abandoned reliance on that approach. And the new regulations favor alternative methods of identifying

children who need services, like evaluating the response of struggling children to extra help before the third grade.

The 2004 law also streamlined procedures and reduced the paperwork involved in providing children special education

services, and relaxed burdens on schools when children with disabilities had behavioral problems.

A draft of the regulations published in June 2005 prompted an outpouring of 5,500 letters and comments to the

Education Department from advocates for children with disabilities, as well as parents, teachers unions, and state,

district and local education officials.

The department posted the final regulations on its Web site today, along with answers to each of the comments it

received. The final regulations will be published in the Federal Register on Aug. 14, and will take effect 60 days later.

In unveiling the new rules, Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said her priority was that we not lose our vigilance

for educational attainment for every child.

Advocates for children with disabilities said they were disappointed that the regulations did not address some

problems they saw in the 2004 federal law.

For example, the law says that instead of reviewing each disabled childs educational plan every year automatically,

schools could review them only once every three years, provided parents agree to the change. The regulations do not

help ensure parents are properly notified, advocates said.

But who is going to make sure that parents now know what theyre giving up if they agree to that? said Ricki Sabia,

associate director of the National Down Syndrome Society Policy Center. The department could have made clear

what constitutes that agreement.

 New pupils aren&apos;t healthy 

 BY JENNIFER MROZOWSKI | ENQUIRER STAFF WRITER 

 August 1, 2006

Almost one in 10 Cincinnati Public School District children is considered overweight by the time

they enter kindergarten, and even more have moderate to serious dental problems.

Those statistics come from a first-time analysis of health screening data of district kindergartners

who took the state&apos;s literacy readiness test in 2005-06.

&quot;That could affect their ability to be successful in school in later years,&quot;Stephanie Byrd, executive

director of Success By 6, said.

Success By 6 is an initiative of the United Way of Greater Cincinnati.

&quot;Our goal is to identify those issues early on and connect them to services so we minimize the gap

and provide early intervention,&quot;Byrd said.

The screenings are part of a larger effort by Success By 6 to improve children&apos;s school readiness.

The agency supports voluntary preschool for all children and more guidance to parents.

Success By 6 provided Cincinnati Health Department nurses with scales, body mass index calculators

and other gear to conduct the screenings.

Of the 2,820 students screened for body mass index, 275 were overweight and another 301 were at

risk of being overweight for their height.

Of the 2,612 students who had dental screenings, 310 had moderate to severe dental problems,

necessitating referral for a dental visit within 24 hours because nurses saw an abscess or significant decay.

Success By 6 is driven to improve children&apos;s health by stark statistics.

Results of the state&apos;s kindergarten readiness test showed that more than half of Cincinnati Public Schools&apos;

kindergarten students did not have basic literacy skills by the time they entered school in 2005-06, the

first year the test was required statewide. Some children could not recognize letters, name rhyming

words or identify sounds.

The next step for Success By 6 is to determine why some schools showed higher rates of overweight

children and instances of dental problems, or why some communities were successful in minimizing

those problems before children started school, Byrd said.

For instance, more than 22 percent of students screened at Rockdale Academy in Avondale and

almost 37 percent at William H. Taft School in Mount Auburn were considered overweight.

None of the 32 screened at Clifton School was overweight.

At Clifton School, almost 97 percent of the 30 students examined for dental problems had a normal

screening. At Rockdale Academy, just over 43 percent of the 30 children examined had a normal

screening, and almost 57 percent (17 students) had moderate to severe dental problems.

After more data is collected, Success By 6 plans to examine the results to determine whether

there&apos;s a correlation between obesity rates, dental problems and low scores on the literacy

readiness test.

In the meantime, Cincinnati Public Schools is trying to improve student health, said Deborah

Bradshaw, the district&apos;s director of early childhood education.

The school system has a new wellness policy that cuts down on sugar and fatty foods offered

in schools. The district also contracts with a dental van to provide screenings at its

headquarters in Corryville and at neighborhood schools.

&quot;The earlier that we catch obesity or tooth decay, the easier it is to remedy the problem,&quot;

Bradshaw said.&quot;And it gives us more opportunities to build better habits for families and children.&quot;

Other agencies also are trying to improve children&apos;s health before they get to school.

One program is Every Child Succeeds, launched in 1999 by Cincinnati Children&apos;s Hospital Medical

Center, Cincinnati-Hamilton County Community Action Agency and United Way of Greater Cincinnati.

It offers parenting tips and home visits to first-time mothers.

The organization has served more than 10,000 families through more than 200,000 home visits, and

participants have a lower infant mortality rate than local and national averages, said Judy Van Ginkel,

president of Every Child Succeeds.

&quot;It&apos;s nice to know someone is coming to check up on you and your child,&quot;said Nicholas Leonard, 24,

of Walnut Hills. Leonard&apos;s 1-year-old son, Ski&apos;lr, and the boy&apos;s mother, Ashley Marshall, 22, are in the

program.

A family support worker comes to Marshall&apos;s Avondale home one or two times a month to talk to her

about child nutrition, safety tips, medical issues and other topics.

&quot;It&apos;s been a big help,&quot;Marshall said.

California School Districts Try to Cope With Declining Enrollment 

 
Schools throughout the state are searching for ways to cope with declining enrollment, saving campus closures as a 

 last resort.
  

 By Catherine Saillant, Times Staff Writer
  

 July 31, 2006

Over the last seven years, nearly 400 students have left the public school rosters in Santa Barbara.

Enrollment in this wealthy, Spanish-tiled coastal haven has dropped as steadily as home prices have risen.

It is a trend expected to continue as the median home price pushes past $1 million.

It is also a trend that increasingly appears to be occurring across California.

Public schools circling downtown Los Angeles are losing students as their neighborhoods gentrify.

A similar shift is underway in the Bay Area, Sacramento and Los Angeles, and Orange and Ventura counties.

Statewide, public school enrollment was down slightly this year, for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century.

And though officials aren&apos;t quite sure of all the reasons behind the drop, they are sure that the cost of housing

is one of them.

In Santa Barbara, school administrators worry about lost revenue, because funding is tied to enrollment.

Already, administrators said, the decline has cost the district millions annually. Now, having made small,

less-painful cuts, they are considering larger steps, such as selling off vacant property or building housing

to sell to teachers at below-market value.

Building the houses, they say, would help recruit teachers, who otherwise might not be able to afford the area,

and the school system would bring in some revenue from the sales.

Another option is to start closing schools, a move that is always unpopular, said Jan Zettel, the Santa

Barbara School Districts&apos; assistant superintendent of secondary education.

&quot;We don&apos;t think we will have to close a school in the next year,&quot;he said,&quot;but beyond that, yes, it&apos;s entirely possible.&quot;

In the 2005-06 school year, statewide school enrollment dropped for the first time in 24 years. There were

6,313,103 pupils enrolled, a decline of about 10,000 from the previous year, according to state Department of

Education records.

State officials aren&apos;t sure whether the trend will continue. Projections had called for continued student growth

through at least 2010, said Donna Rothenbaum, a spokeswoman in the education department&apos;s demographics

unit. She said several factors could contribute, including local job losses, changes in migration patterns and lower

fertility rates. But a major trigger, analysts say, is the state&apos;s sky-high housing market.

Student losses appear to be highest in high-cost coastal regions, especially around Los Angeles and the Bay Area.

Housing prices in those regions are among the highest in the state, analysts note.

At ABC Unified, based in Cerritos, enrollment has dropped by 1,000 students over the last five years, officials said.

In Orange County, Fountain Valley schools are losing 60 to 100 students a year. Similar declines have been recorded

in Ojai and Oak Park school districts in Ventura County.

In Sacramento, San Juan Unified School District is closing schools because of decreased enrollment, Rothenbaum

said.

&quot;It wasn&apos;t that long ago that we couldn&apos;t build schools fast enough,&quot;said Hans Johnson, a demographer at the San

Francisco-based Public Policy Institute of California.&quot;Now we&apos;ve switched to which schools to close.&quot;

Santa Barbara&apos;s housing market is so out of reach for young families, Johnson said, that when couples there

decide to buy a home, they move inland. The pattern is common throughout California, he said.

&quot;There are still areas of enrollment growth, but they are in places like San Bernardino and Riverside, and in the

cities east of the Bay Area,&quot;Johnson said.

Housing in Santa Barbara was already more expensive than other areas when the boom in home prices began

five years ago. In June, the median price passed $1 million.

That has squeezed out teachers, police officers, firefighters and other middle-wage earners, creating a two-tiered

economy, said William Fulton, president of Solimar Research Group, a Ventura-based planning and

development research firm.

&quot;You have rich people who don&apos;t have kids and poor people living two or three families to a house,&quot;Fulton said.

In Santa Barbara Unified&apos;s 13 elementary schools, 70% of students are Latino and 25% are white. Citywide,

population estimates are nearly reversed: 58% of residents are white and 35% are Latino.

Most of the remaining students are from immigrant families and struggle just to read and write in English, Zettel said.

The evidence of white flight out of the city&apos;s schools has made the challenge more difficult, educators said.

Once begun, white flight can be a difficult cycle to break, Zettel said. La Cumbre Junior High School has lost

hundred of students in recent years, he said.

&quot;We started to see people looking around, getting worried,&quot;he said.&quot;And if you&apos;re wealthy, you have a lot of

education options.&quot;

The school board will study several ways to use two vacant parcels next month. But already there is opposition

from neighborhood groups that fear construction of hundreds of units beyond what current zoning densities allow.

Details won&apos;t be released until the school board meets Aug. 8, officials said. But the study is expected to spell

out what it would take to build housing for teachers on the properties. They are zoned for 115 units, but nearby

residents fear the district could seek to rezone for as many as 400 homes and condos.

If built for staff, the homes would be sold at below-market rates. Teachers would be required to sell the homes

after retirement and share the profits with the school district.

Another option would be for the district to sell the land to developers. A 2005 appraisal estimated that the

properties could bring $23.5 million total.

Gary Earle, president of Coalition for Sensible Planning, said residents aren&apos;t opposed to the idea of

affordable housing for teachers. But they don&apos;t want hundreds of units on a lot zoned for 75 homes, he said.

&quot;They have to be a good neighbor and build something that is consistent with what&apos;s already here,&quot;he said

of a 23-acre property near tract housing in Goleta.&quot;Why should one neighborhood be ruined to solve their

financial problems?&quot;

Other districts have explored alternatives to selling off surplus property. The Oak Park Unified School District

in 2004 passed a $197-per-parcel tax to raise $1 million annually, said Assistant Supt. Cliff Moore.

Oak Park officials expect the current 3,800-student population to shrink by half in about a decade. Build-out

and high home prices constrict the district&apos;s ability to attract new students, Moore said.

If the parcel tax is not renewed after it expires in three years, Oak Park could be facing school closures, he said.

&quot;With our small district, we don&apos;t have economies of scale,&quot;he said.&quot;We could be looking at some pretty severe

cuts in the next five to seven years.&quot;

In the ABC Unified School District, most of the student losses have occurred at the elementary level.

Economic pressure has made it difficult for young families in Cerritos, Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens and

Lakewood to buy homes, officials said.

Though the district has not closed schools, it has reduced class size in kindergarten through third grade

and ninth grade, with a resulting loss in state reimbursements, said Kathy Frazier, the district&apos;s director of schools.

The district is trying to attract more working families this fall by offering part- to full-day kindergarten at all of its

elementary schools and simplifying the registration process, Frazier said.

The challenge, educators say, is figuring out how to maintain a quality education as revenue shrinks. Without

supplementary dollars, popular programs, such as music, art and sports, could be eliminated.

Moore said he fears a future of haves and have-nots, where schools located in well-to-do neighborhoods

will be able to hang on to their extras through parcel taxes and educational foundations, while those in

lower-income areas will suffer.

&quot;Schools could be in trouble,&quot;he said.&quot;There could be a widening gap and that&apos;s pretty scary.&quot;

A Modest Proposal To Abolish Universities

About Time 
 

July 27, 2006


I think it is time to close the universities, and perhaps prosecute the professoriat under the RICO act as a

corrupt and racketeering-influenced organization. Universities these days have the moral character of

electronic churches, and as little educational value. They are an embarrassment to civilization.

I know this. I am sitting in my office in Jocotepec, consorting with a bottle of Padre Kino redchanneling

the good Padre if you will. It is insight cheap at the price. A few bucks a liter.

To begin with, sending a child to a university is irresponsible. These days it costs something like a

quarter of a million dollars, depending on your choice of frauds. The more notorious of these intellectual

brothels, as for example Yale, can cost more. This money, left in the stock market for forty hears, or thirty,

would yield enough to keep the possessor in comfort, with sufficient left over for his vices. If the market

took a downturn, he could settle for just the vices. In the intervening years, he (or, most assuredly, she)

could work in a dive shop.

See? By sending our young to college, we are impoverishing them, and ourselves, and sentencing

them to a life of slavery in some grim cubicle painted federal-wall green. Personally, Id rather be

chained in a trireme.

Besides, the effect of a university education can be gotten more easily by other means. If it is thought

desirable to expose the young to low propaganda, any second-hand bookstore can provide copies of

Trotsky, Marcuse, Gloria Steinem, and the Washington Post. These and a supply of Dramamine, in

the space of a week, would provide eighty percent of the content of a college education. A beer truck

would finish the job. The student would save four years which could more profitably be spent in selling

drugs, or in frantic cohabitation orwild thoughtin reading, traveling, and otherwise cultivating himself.

This has been known to happen, though documentation is hard to find.

To the extent that universities actually try to teach anything, which is to say to a very limited extent, they

do little more than inhibit intelligent students of inquiring mind. And they are unnecessary: The professors

role is purely disciplinary: By threats of issuing failing grades, he ensures that the student comes to class

and reads certain things. But a student who has to be forced to learn should not be in school in the first

place. By making a chore of what would otherwise be a pleasure, the professor instills a lifelong loathing

of study.

The truth is that universities positively discourage learning. Think about it. Suppose you wanted to learn

Twain. A fruitful approach might be to read Twain. The man wrote to be read, not analyzed tediously and

inaccurately by begowned twits. It might help to read a life of Twain. All of this the student could do,

happily, even joyously, sitting under a tree of an afternoon. This, I promise, is what Twain had in mind.

But no. The student must go to a class in American Literatue, and be asked by some pompous drone,

Now, what is Twain trying to tell us in paragraph four? This presumes that Twain knew less well than

the professor what he was trying to say, and that he couldnt say it by himself. Not being much of a writer,

the poor man needs the help of a semiliterate drab who couldnt sell a pancake recipe to Boys Life. As

bad, the approach suggests that the student is too dim to see the obvious or think for himself. He cant

read a book without a middleman. He probably ends by hating Twain.

When I am dictator, anyone convicted of literary criticism will be drawn and quartered, dragged through

the streets as a salutary lesson to the wise, and dropped in the public drains.

Why is the ceiling spinning? Maybe Im caught in a gravitational anomaly.

The truth is that anyone who wants to learn anything can do it better on his own. If you want to learn to write,

for example, lock yourself in a room with copies of Strunk and White, and Fowler, and a supply of Padre

Kino, and a loaded shotgun. The books will provide technique, the good Padre the inspiration, and you

can use the shotgun on any tenured intrusion who offers advice. They tend to be spindly. A twenty-gauge

should be sufficient.

Worse, these alleged academies, these dark nights of the soul encourage moral depravity. This is not just

my opinion. It can be shown statistically. Virtually all practitioners of I-banking, advertising, and law began

by going to some university. Go to Manhattan and visit any prestigious nest of foul attorneys engaged in

circumventing the law. Most will have attended schools in the Ivy League. The better the school, the worse

the outcome. Any trace of principle, of contemplative wonder, will have been squeezed out of them as if

they were grapes.

Perhaps once universities had something to do with the mind, the arts, with reflection, with grasping or

grasping at mans place in a curious universe. No longer. Now they are a complex scam of interlocking

directorates. They employ professors, usually mediocre, to sell diplomas, usually meaningless, needed to

get jobs nobody should want, for the benefit of corporations who want the equivalent of docile

assembly-line workers.

See, first you learn that you have to finish twelve years of grade school and high school. The point is not to

teach you anything; if it were, they would give you a diploma when you passed a comprehensive test,

which you might do in the fifth grade. The point is to accustom you to doing things you detest. Then they

tell you that you need four more years in college or you wont be quite human and anyway starve from not

getting a job. For those of this downtrodden bunch who are utterly lacking in independence, there is

graduate school.

The result is twenty years wasted when you should have been out in the world, having a life worth talking

about in barsriding motorcycles, sacking cities, lolling on Pacific beaches or hiking in the Northwest.

You learn that structure trumps performance, that existence is supposed to be dull. It prepares you to

spend years on lawsuits over somebody elses trademarks or simply going buzzbuzzbuzz in a wretched

federal office. Only two weeks a year do you get to do what you want to do. This we pay for?

What if you sent your beloved daughter to a university and they sent you back an advertising executive?

I think were having an earthquake. When the floor stops heaving, Im going to send out for more Padre Kino.

State schools should learn lesson from private sector, says

education secretary 

Matthew Taylor, education correspondent
Wednesday July 26, 2006
The Guardian


State schools can learn from those schools in the independent sector that turn out rounded, socially adept pupils, the

education secretary, Alan Johnson, suggested yesterday.

He said private schools teach young people vital attributes, such as teamwork and communication skills, which are

increasingly important in the job market.

Mr Johnson&apos;s remarks, made to the National Family and Parenting Institute in London, come a day after he was

criticised for helping a boy in his Hull constituency find a place at a local private school because there were no

&quot;suitable&quot;state schools in the area.

Yesterday he said:&quot;One of the reasons why independent schools get such good results, apart from the level of

selection and the extra resources, is the time they spend with children doing sport, music and drama, building

social skills, confidence and teamworking. This helps children develop not just academic and vocational

skills but social skills as well.&quot;

He said English state primary schools were already taking up a scheme to help children develop the social

and emotional aspects of education.&quot;These skills are vital in today&apos;s workforce, where the ability to

communicate, integrate and engage are essential - they are the skills which employers increasingly

look for first.&quot;Earlier in the week Mr Johnson revealed that he had helped a mother in his Hull constituency

who was trying to get her son into an independent school.

The school, which had accepted the boy, had run out of bursaries to help working-class families pay fees

and the woman asked for his assistance, Mr Johnson said.

&quot;She couldn&apos;t possibly afford it,&quot;he told the London Evening Standard.&quot;It would have been the end of a

chance for him. She just doesn&apos;t have a suitable school close at hand and he is a very bright boy who

wants to do science.&quot;

Yesterday an education department official said Mr Johnson had complete confidence in Hull&apos;s state

schools, which had&quot;improved dramatically&quot;.

Union leaders criticised his comments. Martin Johnson, head of education policy at the Association of

Teachers and Lecturers, said last night:&quot;It&apos;s a pity the secretary of state for education doesn&apos;t share our

faith in state schools.&quot;Steve Sinnott, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said state

schools needed the resources of the independent sector more than their ability to teach&quot;social skills&quot;.

He said if Mr Johnson had visited sufficient state schools,&quot;he would know there is a huge amount

independent schools should learn from the state system - it is never a one-way flow&quot;.

Acid Tests
No Child Left Behind is beyond uninformative. It is deceptive. 

BY CHARLES MURRAY
Tuesday, July 25, 2006 12:01 a.m. EDT

Test scores are the last refuge of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). They have to be, because so

little else about the act is attractive.

NCLB takes a giant step toward nationalizing elementary and secondary education, a disaster for

federalism. It pushes classrooms toward relentless drilling, not something that inspires able people

to become teachers or makes children eager to learn. It holds good students hostage to the

performance of the least talented, at a time when the economic future of the country depends more

than ever on the performance of the most talented. The one aspect of the act that could have

inspired enthusiasm from me, promoting school choice, has fallen far short of its hopes. The only

way to justify NCLB is through compelling evidence that test scores are improving. So let&apos;s talk

about test scores.

The case that NCLB has failed to raise test scores had been made most comprehensively in a report

from the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, released just a few weeks ago. The Civil Rights

Project has an openly liberal political agenda, but the author of the report, Jaekyung Lee, lays out

the data in graphs that anyone can follow, subjects them to appropriate statistical analyses, and

arrives at conclusions that can stand on their scholarly merits: NCLB has not had a significant

impact on overall test scores and has not narrowed the racial and socioeconomic achievement gap.

Is it too early to tell? As a parent who has had children in public schools since NCLB began, I don&apos;t

think so. The Frederick County, Md., schools our children have attended have turned themselves

inside out to try to produce the right test results, with dismaying effects on the content of classroom

instruction and devastating effects on teacher morale. We actually lost our best English teacher to

the effects of high-stakes testing.&quot;I want to teach my students how to write,&quot;he said,&quot;not teach

them how to pass a test that says they can write.&quot;He quit.

So, yes, I think that if we parents have had to put up with these kinds of troubling effects on our

children&apos;s schooling for four years, we are entitled to expect evidence of results. After all,&quot;accountability&quot;

is NCLB&apos;s favorite word, and the Department of Education is holding school systems accountable for

improvements in test scores with a vengeance. Sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander.

The Department of Education will undoubtedly produce numbers to dispute the findings of the Civil

Rights Project, which brings me to the point of this essay. Those numbers will consist largely of pass

percentages, not mean scores. A particular score is deemed to separate&quot;proficient&quot;from&quot;not proficient.&quot;

Reach that score, and you&apos;ve passed the test. If 60% of one group--blondes, let&apos;s say--pass while only

50% of redheads pass, then the blonde-redhead gap is 10 percentage points.

A pass percentage is a bad standard for educational progress. Conceptually,&quot;proficiency&quot;has no

objective meaning that lends itself to a cutoff. Administratively, the NCLB penalties for failure to make

adequate progress give the states powerful incentives to make progress as easy to show as possible.

A pass percentage throws away valuable information, telling you whether someone got over a bar, but

not how high the bar was set or by how much the bar was cleared. Most importantly: If you are trying to

measure progress in closing group differences, a comparison of changes in pass percentages is

inherently misleading.

Take the case of Texas, from which George Bush acquired his faith in NCLB. As the president

described it to the Urban League in 2003:&quot;In my state, Texas, 73% of the white students passed

the math test in 1994, while only 38% of African-American students passed it. So we made that the

point of reference. We had people focused on the results for the first time--not process, but results.

And because teachers rose to the challenge, because the problem became clear, that gap has

now closed to 10 points.&quot;President Bush&apos;s numbers are accurately stated. They are also meaningless.

Any test that meets ordinary standards produces an approximation of what statisticians call a&quot;normal

distribution&quot;of scores--a bell curve--because achievement in any open-ended skill such as reading

comprehension or mathematics really is more or less normally distributed. The tests that produce

anything except a bell curve are usually ones so simple that large proportions of students get every

item correct. They hide the underlying normal distribution, but don&apos;t change it. Thus point No. 1, that

using easy tests and discussing results in terms of pass percentages obscures a reality that NCLB

seems bent on denying: All the children cannot be above average. They cannot all even be proficient,

if&quot;proficient&quot;is defined legitimately. Some children do not have the necessary skills. Point No. 2

goes to the inherent distortions introduced by the use of pass percentages: Because of the underlying

normal distribution, a gain in a given number of points has varying effects on group differences

depending on where the gain falls.

To illustrate point No. 2, consider a test that has a hundred-point scale with a mean of 50 and a standard

deviation of 15 (the standard deviation, a measure of the variability of the scores, tells you how tall and

skinny or how short and broad the bell curve will be). How many students are involved when a range of,

say, 10 points is at issue? The shaded areas in Figure 1 show two possibilities.

The total area under the bell curve includes all the students. The shaded area on the left includes all

those with a score of 40 to 49 points--24.8% of all students, if the distribution is perfectly normal. The

shaded area on the right includes all those with a score of 80 to 89 points--just 1.9% of all students.

Suppose we are still comparing redheads and blondes. If the mean score of redheads goes from 40

to 50, it has risen all the way from the 25th to the 50th percentile of all students. If the blonde mean goes

from 80 to 90, it has moved merely from the 98th to the 99th percentile of all students. You do not have to

be a statistician to see that these built-in features of normally distributed scores--gains that are equal in

points are not equal in the number of students they affect or in the percentile distances that students

move--complicate the use of pass percentages when comparing groups.

If you want to get deeper into the math, you may visit a quirky and provocative Web site, www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com,

run by someone who calls himself La Griffe du Lion. I surmise that he is an established scholar--a quantitative

discipline seems likely--who once published on the fraught topic of group differences, learned how unpleasant

and even professionally perilous that can be, and decided to remain anonymous henceforth. In any case,

his technical skills are first rate. Click on the topic line entitled&quot;Closing the Racial Learning Gap&quot;for a

much more detailed version of the argument and data that I am presenting here.

For our purposes, you need know only this: If the real difference between two groups, measured as it

should be with means and standard deviations, remains constant, the size of the pass-percentage gap

between two groups changes nonlinearly in a mathematically inevitable way. In other words, if there really

is a constant, meaningful difference between groups, you can generate a curve that predicts how the point

gap will change as tests are made easier or harder or as students become more or less competent.

La Griffe has done this, and his curve fits the Texas data almost perfectly. In Figure 2, the white pass

rate is used as the basis for predicting the size of the white-black gap. The circles represent the

observed sizes of the test score gap from 1994 to 2002.

Test scores in Texas went up for both blacks and whites. Maybe that&apos;s good news, representing real

gains in learning for everyone, or maybe it&apos;s not so good, representing the effects of teaching to the

test. The data Texas reports do not permit a judgment. But the black gains are almost exactly what

would be predicted if the magnitude of the underlying black-white difference remained unchanged.

If there really was closure of the gap, all that Texas has to do is release the group means, as well

as information about the black and white distributions of scores, and it will easy to measure it.

Whatever the real closure may be, however, it cannot come close to the dramatic reduction that

President Bush found in the difference between black and white pass rates.

In this instance, the percentage-passed measure misleadingly showed a huge reduction in the black-white

achievement gap. But look at the left-hand side of the curve. In a state that imposes tough standards--for example,

one that establishes a threshold that only 40% of whites pass--across-the-board improvements in scores can

misleadingly show an increase in the white-black achievement gap when none occurred.

Question: Doesn&apos;t this mean that the same set of scores could be made to show a rising or falling group

difference just by changing the definition of a passing score? Answer: Yes.

At stake is not some arcane statistical nuance. The federal government is doling out rewards and penalties

to school systems across the country based on changes in pass percentages. It is an uninformative measure

for many reasons, but when it comes to measuring one of the central outcomes sought by No Child Left Behind,

the closure of the achievement gap that separates poor students from rich, Latino from white, and black from

white, the measure is beyond uninformative. It is deceptive.

 Most States Fail Demands in Education Law 


By SAM DILLON
Published: July 25, 2006

Most states failed to meet federal requirements that all teachers be highly qualified in core teaching fields and

that state programs for testing students be up to standards by the end of the past school year, according to the

federal government.

The deadline was set by the No Child Left Behind Act, President Bushs effort to make all American students

proficient in reading and math by 2014. But the Education Department found that no state had met the deadline

for qualified teachers, and it gave only 10 states full approval of their testing systems.

Faced with such findings, Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, who took office promising flexible

enforcement of the law, has toughened her stance, leaving several states in danger of losing parts of their

federal aid.

In the past few weeks, Ms. Spellings has flatly rejected as inadequate the testing systems in Maine and Nebraska.

She has also said that nine states are so far behind in providing highly qualified teachers that they may face sanctions,

and she has accused California of failing to provide federally required alternatives to troubled schools. California

could be fined as much as $4.25 million.

The potential fines are far higher than any the Education Department has levied over the law, and officials in several

states, already upset with many of the laws provisions, have privately expressed further anger over the threat of fines.

But Ms. Spellings faces pressure for firm enforcement of the law from a broad array of groups, including corporations

and civil rights organizations.

In the early part of her tenure, Secretary Spellings seemed more interested in finding reasons to waive the laws

requirements than to enforce them, said Clint Bolick, president of the Alliance for School Choice, a group based

in Phoenix that supports vigorous enforcement of provisions that give students the right to transfer from failing

schools. More recently, she seems intent on holding states feet to the fire.

In an interview, Ms. Spellings acknowledged her shift in emphasis.

I want states to know that Congress and the president mean business on the law, she said. She has stressed that

message in part, she said, because the deadlines, which expired this month, were not met, and because lawmakers

have been asking her whether states are meeting the laws requirements.

Im enforcing the law does that make me tough? she said. Last year it was, Were marching together toward the

deadline, but now its time for, Your homework is due.

Douglas D. Christensen, the Nebraska education commissioner, has accused Ms. Spellings and her subordinates of

treating Nebraska in a mean-spirited, arbitrary and heavy-handed way after their announcement on June 30 that the

states testing system was nonapproved and that they intended to withhold $127,000 in federal money.

In an interview in Lincoln, Neb., Mr. Christensen said he first realized the administrations attitude had changed in April,

when Raymond Simon, deputy education secretary, addressed most of the 50 state school superintendents at a

gathering in Washington.

Ray went on a 12-minute diatribe of You folks just aint getting it done and said the department would be strictly

interpreting the law from here on, Mr. Christensen said.

Mr. Simon disputed that account Im not a diatribe type of guy, he said but acknowledged that he had spoken

bluntly.

I tried to emphasize that we continue to be partners, Mr. Simon said, but that there are some things we cannot

be flexible on.

Mr. Bush signed the act into law in January 2002. Under his first education secretary, Rod Paige, legislators,

educators and teachers unions criticized the laws many rules and what they said was its overemphasis on

standardized testing.

After Ms. Spellings took office in January 2005, she allowed some states to renegotiate the ways they enforced

the law, and on major issues she offered ways to comply that prevented thousands of schools from being

designated as failing.

Her efforts softened the outcry from states. But they brought criticism from corporate executives who hoped the

law would shake up schools to protect American competitiveness. Criticism also came from civil rights groups

that wanted the law to eliminate educational disparities between whites and minorities, and from groups angry

that although the law required districts to help students in failing schools transfer out, only 1 percent of eligible

students had done so.

Some experts say most parents do not want to remove children from neighborhood schools. But others say

districts have subverted the program, partly by informing parents about their options too late.

Mr. Bolicks group, the Alliance for School Choice, used a similar argument in a complaint filed this year

against the Los Angeles Unified School District, where 250,000 students were eligible for transfers in 2005-6,

but only about 500 successfully transferred. That complaint generated considerable news coverage and

moved Ms. Spellings to action.

On May 15, she wrote every state, linking the unacceptably low participation in transfer programs to the poor and

uneven quality of many districts implementation. We are prepared to take significant enforcement action, she said.

At the California Department of Education, Diane Levin, the states No Child Left Behind administrator, said she had

assumed that California was on solid ground because a federal review of its enforcement of the law was ending positively.

But then California received a letter from Ms. Spellingss office demanding extensive new documentation by Aug. 15 on

the transfer programs in the states 20 largest districts. Officials warned California that if the documentation proved

inadequate, the government would withhold part of the $700 million the state was to receive this fall for high-poverty

schools, said Ms. Spellingss spokesman, Kevin Sullivan.

Ms. Levin said California felt whipsawed. Were doing everything the law asks us to do, she said, which in a state this

size is a huge amount of work, and were treated like were doing nothing.

Dozens of other states have also felt the tougher enforcement.

In May, federal officials ruled that nine states were so far from meeting the teacher qualification provision that they could

lose federal money. Ms. Spellings said she would decide on the penalties after August, when states must outline plans for

getting 100 percent of teachers qualified.

At the end of June, Henry L. Johnson, an assistant secretary of education, wrote to 34 states, including New York and

New Jersey, saying that their tests had major problems and that they must provide new documentation during a period of

mandatory oversight.

Dr. Johnson warned some states that federal money might be withheld. And he rejected the testing programs in Maine and

Nebraska. His letter to Maine said $114,000 would be withheld unless the state could change Washingtons mind.

Nebraska is the only state allowed to meet the testing requirements with separate exams written by teachers in its 250

districts rather than with one statewide test.

Dr. Johnsons letter to Nebraska said that although locally written tests were permissible, the state had not shown it was

holding all districts to a high standard.

Before announcing that decision, Dr. Johnson visited the Papillion-La Vista School District, south of Omaha.

Harlan H. Metschke, Papillions superintendent, said he had told Mr. Johnson that Nebraskas tests helped teachers focus

on students learning needs, unlike standardized tests, which compared students from one school with another.

But federal officials have the mentality that there has to be one state test, Mr. Metschke said.

Biography of Roderick R. Paige, Ed.D.
U.S. Secretary of Education (2001-2005)

During his tenure at the U.S. Department of Education from 2001 to 2005, Secretary Roderick R. Paige was a fierce and

innovative champion of education reform who led the way in setting new standards of achievement for all students in our

education system. He spearheaded the implementation of the historic No Child Left Behind Act, with its goal of reinvigorating

America&apos;s education system.

Dr. Paige has devoted his life to transforming the state of education by improving the way that children learn on all levels,

a passion that has manifested itself most recently when he founded the bi-partisan Chartwell Education Group, LLC. This

group is a consulting firm devoted to offering solutions to the 21 st Century challenges faced by the public and private sector

enterprises that focus on pre-K, K-12 and post-secondary education, both in the United States and throughout the world.

Prior to his time at Chartwell, and after he left the administration in 2005, Dr. Paige served as a Public Policy Scholar at the

Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. There he was able to explore a more global perspective of education.

As he said: Civilizations rise and fall depending upon the quality of education.

His appointment by President George W. Bush as the seventh U.S. Secretary of Education, and the first school

superintendent to serve in this position, was a signal honor for Dr. Paige, the son of a principal and a librarian in the public

school system. Born in 1933 in segregated Monticello, Mississippi, Dr. Paige&apos;s accomplishments speak of his commitment to

education. He earned a Bachelor&apos;s degree from Jackson State University in his home state. He then earned both a Master&apos;s

and a Doctoral degree from Indiana University.

Dr. Paige began his career as a teacher and coach. He served for a decade as dean of the College of Education at Texas

Southern University (TSU), working to ensure future educators receive the training and expertise necessary to succeed in

the classroom. He also established the University&apos;s Center for Excellence in Urban Education, a research facility that

concentrates on issues related to instruction and management in urban school systems.

Elected to the Board of Education of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) in 1989, Dr. Paige was a trustee and

an officer until 1994, when he became Superintendent of HISD, the nation&apos;s seventh largest school district. Inside Houston

Magazine named him as one of Houston&apos;s most powerful 25 people for helping guide the city&apos;s growth and prosperity. He

was also honored as an outstanding educator by the Council of the Great City Schools (2000) and the National Association

of Black School Educators (2001). His innovative practices also led Dr. Paige to being named the National Superintendent

of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2001.

What impact do you think No Child Left Behind&apos; has had?

I think that the No Child Left Behind Act was a turning point in public education in America and the most significant change

in federal public education policy since the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

It allows us to see what is really going on in the classroom and to focus in an effective manner on closing the achievement

gap among students by setting measurable standards for them and their teachers and making them all accountable for

getting results.

Furthermore, by requiring disaggregation of data, performance can no longer be hidden in averages. Standards must be

met by each and every child, their teachers and their schools and progress reports must show what is being done to

improve the quality of the system for everyone. Thus, NCLB allows us to see more clearly into a system that had been

opaque.

Do you think the initiative and the impetus will continue?

NCLB is already indelibly etched into our nation&apos;s education system and the public will not allow us to turn back the clock.

As we go forward the more information about student and school performance that is made available will make it more

difficult for the system not to operate in an effective and efficient manner; the public will not stand for it. As a result, no

child in this country no matter his economic standing will be deprived of the opportunity to receive a quality education.

Could you please describe your new company affiliation and what exactly you&apos;re going to be doing?

Chartwell Education Group was created to help improve the abilities of those in the field of education in the United States

and throughout the world, both in the private and public sectors, to deliver education services more effectively, efficiently

and successfully. Thus, we provide experienced counsel and advice to schools and school systems, businesses that

operate in the field of education, philanthropic organizations and foreign governments and institutions seeking to raise

standards for education in their nations.

With the help of my former Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Education, John Danielson, we&apos;ve been able to assemble

an extraordinarily talented and experienced group of professionals at Chartwell individuals who know education and are

also experienced in business. They are passionate about what we are doing and help our clients create solutions that work

for them and the students they serve.

What do you perceive as the major reasons why school districts become failing school districts? What&apos;s going on in those

districts?

I think the first place to look is at the top. If a school district is not performing or under performing the fault usually lies at the

administrative level. And so, you need to look at how the big decisions are made, how the leadership was chosen and

established, how resources are allocated and what policies are in place. You must also determine whether or not the district

has a strong and focused commitment to student achievement.

Does No Child Left Behind address the needs of the increasing number of kids with exceptionalities, disabilities, whatever

politically correct word you want to use?

The No Child Left Behind Act is focused on ALL children, which includes children with disabilities. In fact, it is one of the

important elements of this act. NCLB is intended to make sure children with disabilities get the attention that they need and,

contrary to what some people think, failure to measure the progress of children with disabilities is a major barrier to their

improvement.

So, the No Child Left Behind Act helps to make certain that these children get the attention they need and deserve.

We&apos;re on the same page now because the differences between I.D.E.A. and the No Child Left Behind&apos; has often been

referred to the clash of the titans.&apos;

I think that is because they are two different laws and require some coordination. There are many similarities and many

differences between NCLB and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that need to be examined more closely

so that we might create more effective synergies. Also, we don&apos;t want the two acts bumping into each other.

What are you most proud of in terms of your accomplishments via a vis the No Child Left Behind?

I&apos;m very proud of the role I played in implementing the No Child Left Behind Act, an important idea with a noble purpose that

President Bush offered to the nation. The success of this law will help all of the citizens of the United States by allowing all

of our children access to a quality education.

There have always been pockets of excellence across the United States and we have rightfully bragged about the

contributions made by those students who have been allowed to excel and succeed. That&apos;s because their success has

been a product of the effectiveness of our education system. Now we need to give all of our kids the chance to succeed,

including a whole subset of students who are not being effective but have the ability to improve. Until now they have been

essentially invisible.

The No Child Left Behind Act let&apos;s us see these children and to identify and fulfill their needs. This process is particularly

effective as the result of the law&apos;s disaggregation clause because it sheds light on needs that are not being fulfilled and so

I&apos;m proud of that. And, I&apos;m proud of, as I indicated earlier, the change of direction we&apos;ve taken, the change of culture we have

effected and the whole idea of accountability.

I think some of the finest people in our nation are those who lead our schools and who teach our children. And, I feel

confident that these wonderful, committed and capable people, who are our nation&apos;s educators, will come to view NCLB

as a much needed, long overdue enhancement of the American system of education.

We have to commend you for trying to change a very entrenched culture, and you leave a legacy for the history books

in American Education. How do you want to be remembered?

I guess I would like to be remembered as someone who permitted himself to pursue an important mission and that&apos;s the

mission of the education of all of our children. My specific interest was in closing the achievement gap in education,

which I think is our nation&apos;s greatest social issue and maybe even it&apos;s most important economic issue. The United States

needs all of the resources it can muster in order to successfully deal with the new realities of Global Economics. If we

empower all of our children to succeed we, as a nation, will succeed.

The fact is that if we don&apos;t change the dynamics of our education system to allow equal opportunity for all of our children to

be successful in life no matter what their ethnic or economic backgrounds may be, we will be doing a great disservice to

our nation.

What question have we neglected to ask you about No Child Left Behind?

You have not asked about the opposition NCLB has faced and there has been a lot of opposition, much of it stemming

from the law&apos;s intent. Some of it has been deliberate and some of it has been simply the result of people not knowing

enough about the law and its potential for making America a better place for all of us.

But, in a sense this is good because it has made us work harder and understand more clearly how change works in a

complex society such as that in United States. Just because it is the right thing to do, or just because it&apos;s the best thing to

do, it does not necessarily mean that it&apos;s going to get done. People have to be convinced that it&apos;s the best thing to do!

You have to be convinced that it works. So, as we go forward we will see more and more people come to the realization

that the No Child Left Behind Act is the most significant educational endeavor undertaken by the federal government

since1965.

What last words of wisdom or what do you want to end up saying to the teachers of America?

I would just repeat what General Omar Bradley said: The teacher is the real soldier of democracy. Others can defend it,

but only he can make it work.

When I use the term, teacher, I use it broadly to include social workers, nutritionists, and administrators because they are a

part of a system that needs both attention and recognition. These individuals are some of the smartest people in the world.

They are in our schools and they are managing our schools day to day.

The system of education that was put into place during the first two decades of the last century is not suited to the

needs of the 21 st Centurynot for our children and not for our society. Thus, it needs to embrace change if our

children and our nation are to prosper and I believe that the No Child Left Behind Act is a catalyst for that change.

I believe it is a positive influence not just for the students that will benefit from the law, but for educators as well.

Republicans unveil $100 million school voucher plan 

Wednesday, July 19, 2006; Posted: 3:47 p.m. EDT (19:47 GMT)
  

 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans on Tuesday proposed a $100 million plan to let poor children leave 

 struggling schools and attend private schools at public expense.

The voucher idea is one in a series of social conservative issues meant to energize the Republican base as midterm 

 elections approach. In announcing their bills, House and Senate sponsors acknowledged that Congress likely won&apos;t even 

 vote on the legislation this year.

Still, the move signals a significant education fight to come. GOP lawmakers plan to try to work their voucher plan into the 

 No Child Left Behind law when it is updated in 2007.

&quot;Momentum is on our side,&quot;said Representative Howard McKeon, R-California, the chairman of the House education 

 committee.

The Bush administration requested the school-choice plan, but Tuesday&apos;s media event caused some awkwardness for the 

 Education Department. The agency just released a study that raises questions about whether private schools offer any 

 advantage over public ones.

Under the new legislation, the vouchers would mainly go to students in poor schools that have failed to meet their progress 

 goals for at least five straight years.

Parents could get $4,000 per year to put toward private-school tuition or a public school outside their local district. They 

 could also seek up to $3,000 per year for extra tutoring.

Supporters say poor parents deserve choices, like rich families have. When schools don&apos;t work, said Education Secretary 

 Margaret Spellings,&quot;parents must have other opportunities.&quot;

During Bush&apos;s presidency, Congress approved the first federal voucher program in the District of Columbia, and 

 private-school aid for students displaced by Hurricane Katrina.

So far, Congress has refused to approve Bush&apos;s national voucher proposals. The new one is the first to target money for 

 kids in schools that have fallen short under federal law.

Critics dismissed it as a gimmick.

&quot;Voucher programs rob public-school students of scarce resources,&quot;said Reg Weaver, president of the National Education 

 Association, a teachers union.&quot;No matter what politicians call them, vouchers threaten the basic right of every child to 

 attend a quality public school.&quot;

Meanwhile, Spellings faced questions about her department&apos;s handling of a new study comparing students in public and 

 private schools that had been quietly released on Friday.

The study found that, overall, private school students outperform public school children in reading and math. But public 

 school students often did as well, if not better, when compared to private-school peers with similar backgrounds.

The study had many caveats and warned that its own comparisons had&quot;modest utility.&quot;

Spellings said she first learned about the study -- one produced by the Education Department&apos;s research arm -- by reading 

 about it in the newspaper. She said the agency must improve the way it releases such reports. But she rejected any 

 suggestion that the department buried the study because it put public schools in a favorable light compared to private ones.

Public vs. Private Schools 
 

Published: July 19, 2006
  

 The national education reform effort has long suffered from magical thinking about what it takes to improve childrens 

 chances of learning. Instead of homing in on teacher training and high standards, things that distinguish effective schools 

 from poor ones, many reformers have embraced the view that the public schools are irreparably broken and that students 

 of all kinds need to be given vouchers to attend private or religious schools at public expense.

This belief, though widespread, has not held up to careful scrutiny. A growing body of work has shown that the quality of 

 education offered to students varies widely within all school categories. The public, private, charter and religious realms 

 all contain schools that range from good to not so good to downright horrendous.

This point was underscored last week when the United States Education Department released a controversial and 

 long-awaited report comparing public and private schools in terms of student achievement as measured on the federal 

 math and reading tests known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress. As with previous studies, this one 

 debunked the widely held belief that public schools were inferior to their private and religious counterparts. The private 

 schools appeared to have an achievement advantage when the raw scores of students were considered alone. But those 

 perceived advantages melted away when the researchers took into account variables like race, gender and parents 

 education and income.

The National Education Association, the nations largest teachers union, quickly asserted that the study showed public 

 schools were doing an outstanding job. That seems absurd, when we consider the dismal math and reading scores that 

 American children racked up on last years national tests.

What the emerging data show most of all is that public, private, charter and religious schools all suffer from the wide 

 fluctuations in quality and effectiveness. Instead of arguing about the alleged superiority of one category over another, 

 the country should stay focused on the overarching problem: on average, American schoolchildren are performing at 

 mediocre levels in reading, math and science wherever they attend school.

BLACKSBURG, Va. The college classroom scene is a familiar one:

young adults in flip-flops and baseball caps, some scribbling notes,

others napping.
 
July 18, 2006
 
 Evelyn Scruggs, a student sitting near the front, is among the more attentive, filling an entire page with notes. 

 But, by the time she leaves, she won&apos;t remember the lecture topic or one word she wrote Scruggs, 19, has attention deficit 

 disorder and related short-term memory loss. Like everyone attending this mock class, she&apos;s hoping it will give her tools to 

 balance her disability with her dream of a college degree. 

 The students get pointers on navigating wheelchairs over hilly terrain, finding note takers and deciding whether to come out to 

 peers about less-obvious disabilities tips experts say are vital as administrators face swelling numbers of disabled students.

About 6 million Americans receive special education services, designated for students whose mental or physical limitation affects 

 their learning, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

Increasingly, such students are aiming for degrees: 11.3 percent of undergraduates nationwide reported a disability during the 

 2003-04 academic year, compared to 7.7 percent during the 1989-90 school year, according to the most recent department 

 statistics.

Special education has shifted over the past decade from getting students to functional levels on basics like reading in favor of 

 encouraging them to move to advanced levels of study and tackle more complex subjects, said Lynda Van Kuren, a 

 spokeswoman for the Council for Exceptional Children.

With special education services and transition planning, they are succeeding at a higher level than ever before, she said.

But college challenges remain, from living independently, to coping with the sudden loss of the family, teachers and specialists 

 who have molded their educations.

Of disabled college students who began college during the 1995-96 school year, only 15 percent had obtained a bachelor&apos;s 

 degree by 2001, compared to 29.8 percent of their non-disabled peers, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

Nearly half of disabled students 41.2 percent dropped out by that year. The remainder attained lower degrees or continued 

 their education.

While a successful student may balance schoolwork with things like cleaning an apartment, some disabled students find it 

 difficult to multitask and excel academically at the same time, explained Jill Rickel, national director of admissions with the College Living Experience, among the most extensive transitional programs in the nation.

Based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the program provides full-time tutoring, social skills development and help with time management 

 for disabled college students.

People are failing out of school because of independent living skills they aren&apos;t taking care of themselves, Rickel said. 

 People&apos;s eyes are opening to that.

Experts say the very support systems set up to help the disabled in grade school may also hurt them.

Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, disabled students from kindergarten through high school are entitled to an 

 individualized education plan created by a pit crew of teachers and specialists.

It all stops in college, a surprise to students who may think administrators will know their needs, said Jane Warner, assistant 

 director of services for disabled students at Virginia Tech and co-organizer of College Bound, a collaboration of the Blacksburg 

 school, Radford University and New River Community College.

College Bound, which Scruggs is part of, is open to high school juniors, seniors and entering college freshman with conditions 

 ranging from speech impairment to cerebral palsy. The program was founded in 1999 after administrators at all three schools 

 noticed students failing.

Students were coming to college not prepared to be able to receive services, Warner said. They may not know that they have 

 to be the ones to go to the disabilities service office and let the college know that they&apos;re a student here.

Still others discover tools that helped them learn in grade school don&apos;t work in college.

Scruggs, for instance, often uses an audio recorder to tape instructors, later listening to the recordings over and over at home.

What if you&apos;re in a class with 500 people and that recorder can&apos;t pick up because the professor is too far away? Warner asked. 

 You have to work with disabilities services to find a solution.

 THE Victorian Government plans to establish&quot;literacy improvement teams&quot;to assist the progress of 

 struggling readers in years 3-8. There are several likely problems with this initiative.

First, the initial teaching of reading follows a discredited model, and it is this misteaching that will 

 continue to produce an unacceptably high failure rate among students. Additionally, the model that will be 

 employed by the&quot;literacy improvement teams&quot;is highly likely to adopt the same failed approach. Finally, given 

 the very high level of problems in these years, intervention will be spread too thinly to be effective, regardless of 

 model.

The reason we are in such a parlous state is because our system has ignored the enormous amount of research 

 that can offer a solution to our literacy problems. Some of this research shows us how our brains react to different 

 teaching approaches.

When MRI brain imaging is used to examine reading, good readers are seen to activate several places on the brain&apos;s 

 left side. These areas are used co-operatively to convert letters into sounds, and then to fit the sounds together to 

 make words we know. Flourishing readers have realised that the alphabet&apos;s letters are symbols intended to evoke 

 those sounds, and they have learned how the sounds are blended to build words.

One of these left-brain regions is used to sound out words. Over time, as young readers perform this sounding-out of 

 written words, they start to build a model of that word in another section of the brain. After they&apos;ve sounded a word 

 correctly several times, their model progressively develops into a replica of the printed word. It shows the way the word 

 is pronounced, the way it is spelt, and what it means. These features become bonded together so that seeing the word 

 evokes its meaning.

Readers clarify and store these models in this second region of the left brain. When that familiar word is subsequently 

 seen in print, it is sent directly to this second region and its recognition is automatic and instant - in a period briefer than a 

 heartbeat. When this process occurs regularly, students begin to display rapid, effortless reading rather than the earlier, 

 slower, sounding-out strategy.

It is tempting to suggest that children should not be taught to sound out, because it isn&apos;t the way skilled readers respond to 

 print. However, what brain science has demonstrated is that you can&apos;t access this second fast-acting region without initially 

 building up the first region. 

 Once children latch on to the logic of our alphabetic language, it doesn&apos;t take many soundings-out to create the firm links 

 necessary.

Not only that, but words that look similar to now-known words are converted to models much more quickly. For some 

 children, however, it may take many attempts. Not all children inherit a strong talent for sensing those small units of sound. 

 However, slower progress may relate to either genetics or inappropriate teaching.

Those who struggle to read do not use the same brain regions for reading. Instead, they try using the right side of the brain, 

 in areas not well suited for reading our alphabetic language. When they read, little activity is observed in the good areas of 

 the left hemisphere but much in the less productive right side.

If this sequence (from sounding out to whole word recognition) is not adequately taught, some children will still figure it out 

 for themselves. However, too many children will be forced to employ less rapid and accurate systems, such as prediction 

 from a story&apos;s context, guessing from pictures, and guessing from the first letter.

We now understand that the brain responds to multiple similar experiences. These stimulate activity in particular areas, 

 building connections in and between those active brain regions. That is how practice makes permanent. Practising 

 productive strategies forms and strengthens the optimal connections that stimulate subsequent reading development.

In the same way, routinely engaging in ineffective strategies also builds circuits in the brain, but circuits that are 

 second-rate for reading. These routines are not easy to break when students grow older, perhaps because between ages 

 five and 10, there&apos;s a pruning process that erases under-used neural cells.

Forming neural links for language is relatively easy up to about age six, and though achievable after that time, requires 

 much more effort. That is why effective initial teaching is so important.

Among those struggling readers, there are teaching strategies that can alter the inefficient pattern of brain activation. 

 Studies have indicated that about 60 hours of careful daily phonics teaching alters the way the brain responds to print. 

 Inefficient right-hemisphere activity diminishes, and left-hemisphere activity increases. New MRI images now look much 

 more like those of good readers. The measured reading outcomes include increased fluency and comprehension.

The brain imaging studies have also shown how difficult and exhausting is the task of reading for struggling students. 

 They use up to five times as much energy when reading as do fluent readers. It is not surprising that they prefer not to read.

But slow early literacy progress usually predicts a decline in academic progress across their primary and secondary 

 careers. Such students increasingly lose access to the curriculum, and many are early school-leavers.

The recent literacy inquiry report commissioned by former education minister Brendan Nelson called for the reintroduction 

 of phonics, in which children learn to read by breaking words into sounds and syllables. This can make a huge difference to 

 the many students for whom reading is made unnecessarily difficult, whether the cause involves brain anomalies (very few) 

 or inappropriate teaching (the vast majority). Recent inquiries in the US and Britain reached similar conclusions.

At a time when real reform is possible, it is unfortunate that some politicians and teacher organizations decry both the need 

 for change and the strong evidence upon which the inquiry&apos;s recommendations are based. It is our children&apos;s future at stake. Time to move on this.

U.S. Says Language Exam Does Not Comply With Law 
 

By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN
Published: July 11, 2006
The federal Department of Education has found that New York States methods for testing
the annual progress of disabled students and students with limited English proficiency do
not comply with the No Child Left Behind law and that the state must correct the problems
within a year or risk losing $1.2 million in federal school aid.

The finding was issued in a letter late last month to the state education commissioner,
Richard P. Mills. In the letter, Henry L. Johnson, the assistant secretary for elementary
and secondary education, told Mr. Mills that the New York State English as a Second
Language Achievement Test is not sufficiently comparable to the regular English
language arts assessment for use as a substitute language arts assessment.

Mr. Johnson also said that tests for special education students were not suitable for
their grade or age.

State officials said they were already working on the problems related to testing special
education students. But they said the finding could have serious consequences for the
states nearly 175,000 non-English speaking students, including about 145,000 in New
York City, by requiring them to take the regular annual state reading exam.

A large number of these students would likely fail the test and, as a result, hundreds
more schools could be branded as needing improvement under provisions of No
Child Left Behind. The law requires annual testing and schools can be sanctioned
if groups of students, like racial minorities or disabled children, fail to make adequate
progress.

To help formulate its response to the federal government, the state education department
later this week is convening a group of experts on bilingual education.

Other possible solutions include forcing non-English speakers to take both the regular
test and the test they have been taking, or for the state to devise an entirely new test,
which could cost millions of dollars. In the school year that just ended, 173,434
non-English speaking students statewide took the existing exam, known by its
acronym, Nyseslat. Students are typically required to take the regular state English
exam after three years in school in New York.

Mr. Mills, in a statement, said that it was too soon to describe specific remedies but that
he expected to address regulators concerns. We are going to resolve these issues, he
said. We will work with educators from across the state to arrive at a solution. This will
include members of the bilingual and special education communities.

David Cantor, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein, said it was premature for
the city to comment.

New York was one of 36 states whose accountability systems under No Child Left
Behind were found by federal reviews to have substantial problems and deemed
pending approval. Only 10 states won approval, while two, Maine and Nebraska,
had their testing systems rejected.

Local experts on bilingual education said the federal governments complaint was
just the latest example of non-English speaking children being an afterthought in
American school systems.

Maria Neira, a first vice president of the state teachers union, New York State
United Teachers, said it was unfair of the federal government to expect newly
arrived immigrant students to take the same exam as native English speakers.

Of course, the tests are not comparable, they are not comparable because
they are not developed to measure the same skills, she said. One is language
acquisition, the other is English language skills. Whats going to happen is you
are not going to have our English language learner students showing any progress.
This is a big dilemma for us.

Lillian Rodrguez-Lpez, the president of the Hispanic Federation, said the
government should focus first on the programs offered to non-English speakers.

What they really need to look at are the resources, the funding that they put into
No Child Left Behind, she said. There are not enough certified teachers, the
curriculum is not strong enough. We need a solid set of standards that are being
followed across the state.

 California Schools Could Lose Aid over &apos;No Child&apos; Law 
by Claudio Sanchez

California is under pressure to provide students at low-performing schools in its
largest school districts with more options for transferring out. Above, a new school

DEADLINE LOOMS FOR CALIFORNIA
California has until Aug. 15 to come up with a plan to allow more students to
transfer out of low-performing schools in its largest school districts. If the state fails
to meet that deadline, the U.S. Education Department has threatened to withhold part
of the $700 million it provides California for high-poverty schools. Read the U.S.
Education Department&apos;s letter to California:


Letter from the Education Department to California
All Things Considered, July 6, 2006 This week, the U.S. Department of Education
threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal school aid from California
because the state has failed to help students transfer out of low-performing schools.


The No Child Left Behind Law requires that students in such schools be given the
option of transferring elsewhere. But nationwide, some 4 million students eligible
for such transfers did not do so, in many cases because there was no place for them to go.


Getting the School District&apos;s Attention

In Los Angeles, some 250,000 students were eligible for transfers, but only a small
percentage actually switched schools. Among those who didn&apos;t is Yolanda Decatur&apos;s
8-year-old son, Cameron.


Like many children in Los Angeles, Yolanda Decatur&apos;s three sons attend year-round
schools -- a byproduct of crowding in the 800,000-student district. By 6:30 a.m. on a
typical school day, Decatur has three bowls of milk and a box of Cap&apos;n Crunch
waiting on the kitchen table of her home.


Kyron, 5, is still in pajamas, watching Sesame Street. Cameron and Sexton Jr., 14,
are dressed. Both boys have struggled academically, Decatur says, but it&apos;s 8-year-old
Cameron who&apos;s having the most trouble at West Athens Elementary School.


&quot;He goes through his tantrums,&quot;she says, adding that the school is too crowded to
give her son the one-on-one attention he needs.&quot;There&apos;s too many kids.&quot;


But it&apos;s not just the crowding. Decatur says that Cameron&apos;s teachers seem to
have given up on him.


Last fall, she had nearly lost all hope of getting the school district to pay attention to
Cameron&apos;s case. Then, John Mancino walked into the fast-food restaurant in south
central Los Angeles where Decatur works full time.


Mancino, a management consultant by profession, with children of his own, says he
became an activist because he hates the way the Los Angeles Unified School
District bureaucracy deals with parents who request transfers.


&quot;A lot of them have given up,&quot;he says.&quot;They don&apos;t think they can beat the system.
They&apos;ve basically thrown the towel in.&quot;


Few Transfer Options for Students

Mancino&apos;s organization -- the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education -- has filed a
complaint with the district and the state. It accuses school officials of withholding
information from parents about the district&apos;s transfer policies and discouraging them
from even applying.


&quot;According to the law, NCLB [No Child Left Behind], they&apos;re supposed to make it very
clear and explain it in simple, easy-to-understand terms, and they&apos;re not doing that,&quot;
Mancino says. The district, he says, is&quot;burying&quot;the information about transfers&quot;to
get around the requirements of No Child Left Behind.&quot;


Mancino says about one-third of the district&apos;s students were eligible for transfers this
past school year, but only 527 students actually did so.


The school district has dismissed Mancino&apos;s complaint.


&quot;We have a massive program of transfer of students throughout this district,&quot;says
L.A. school district superintendent Roy Romer.


Urging Parents to Be Patient

The L.A. school district has done everything possible to give parents options,
Romer says, but it simply doesn&apos;t have the room for all of those students to transfer.

&quot;We&apos;re 160,000 seats short. Where do you transfer to?&quot;he says.&quot;Give us some time.
We&apos;ll have new buildings built. We&apos;re building them now.&quot;


Romer says the district is building 160 new schools at a cost of $19 billion to deal
with the crowding. But, he adds, parents like Decatur have to be patient.


&quot;I&apos;ve got to say to that parent, &apos;We are making more change in the right direction
than any other urban school district in California,&apos;&quot;Romer says.&quot;You can&apos;t turn
one of these things around in a month, a year or five years. It takes 10 to
12 years to do it.&quot;


That&apos;s not good enough for Yolanda Decatur.

&quot;Tell my son, you look in his face and tell him he that he has to wait for
a better school,&quot;she says.


She says parents like her feel that suing the school district will force it to act faster.
&quot;We have these rights to demand better schools for our children,&quot;she says.


Federal Funds at Stake

There is no lawsuit yet, but there will be soon, says Clint Bolick, of the
Phoenix-based Alliance for School Choice.


Bolick, a longtime advocate of vouchers and school choice, is working with
Mancino and his organization to help parents in Los Angeles. He says he&apos;s
convinced that the threat of a lawsuit will force U.S. Education Secretary
Margaret Spellings to deal with the problem.


&quot;If she wants school districts to comply with the law, she has got to make an
example out of a school district that is in blatant non-compliance, and she
could not find a better example than the Los Angeles Unified School District,
&quot;Bolick says.&quot;She&apos;s offered an awful lot of waivers to school districts to get
out of from the requirements of the law, and she&apos;s threatened a great deal.
But so far, she has not made good on a single threat.&quot;


Chris Doherty of the U.S. Education Department strongly disagrees.

&quot;This secretary has made clear that she&apos;s unsatisfied with what we&apos;re
seeing across the country, and she&apos;s taking strong steps to bring those
numbers up to where we want them to be,&quot;Doherty says.


Doherty has been monitoring parents&apos; complaints in Los Angeles and
across the country.


Spellings&quot;has made California aware that she&apos;s following this extremely
closely,&quot;he says.&quot;She&apos;s made every state superintendent aware that she&apos;s
poised to take action, including withholding funds from noncompliant
districts and states, if need be.&quot;


In an unprecedented move, Spellings has given California six weeks to
come up with a plan that would allow students in failing schools throughout
the state to transfer to a better school this fall.


If the state does not submit a plan that Spellings deems adequate, Doherty
says the education secretary will withhold part of the $700 million California is
due to receive this fall in federal Title I funds, which are earmarked for
high-poverty schools. And that, department officials say, is no empty threat.

California officials told NPR that what the U.S. Department of Education is
asking for is going to be a logistical nightmare: Every failing school -- and
every school district -- where parents have tried, unsuccessfully, to transfer
their children out now faces a six-week deadline to make sure those
students find a new school.


California officials said lawyers for the state will likely examine the letter from
Washington to see whether they can challenge the Aug. 15 deadline, because
under No Child Left Behind, there is supposed to be a process in place that
gives states time to review and appeal any complaint or lawsuit. This process
now appears to be out the window.

An Interview with Steve Hinshaw: About ADHD in Females 
Monday, July 10, 2006
Michael F. Shaughnessy
Eastern New Mexico University
Portales , New Mexico 88130

Steve Hinshaw has just competed a major study regarding Attention Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity in females. In this 

 interview, he responds to questions regarding this problem and the results of his research.

1. You have recently completed a major research study about ADD and ADHD in females. What have you found?

In short, we performed an unprecedented, 5-year prospective, longitudinal follow-upfrom childhood into adolescenceof our 

 large sample of girls with ADHD as well as our matched comparison sample of girls without ADHD. We originally evaluated 

 both samples together during our summer camp programs in the 1990&apos;s, documenting that (a) ADHD does indeed exist in girls 

 and (b) when it does, noteworthy impairments in social and academic functioning are evident. In our follow-up study, we 

 evaluated 92% of the 140 girls with ADHD and 88 comparison girls, now aged 12-17 years. The key findings were as follows: 

 (i) a number of girls with ADHD lost symptoms of the condition over time, particularly the most visible hyperactive symptoms. 

 (ii) Still, in all 10 of the domains we examined (delinquent behavior, anxious/depressed behavior, eating disorder symptoms, 

 substance use and abuse, social skills, rejection by peers, academic achievement, self-perceptions, and need for services), 

 the girls with ADHD were far more impaired than the comparison group, 5 years after the childhood ascertainment of the 

 sample. (iii) Few differences emerged in adolescence between girls with the Inattentive type of ADHD and the Combined type 

 (signifying a combination of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms), but both types were notably worse off than the 

 comparison group. (iv) Academic achievement in math and reading showed the most significant declines, over time, for the 

 girls with ADHD. Overall, ADHD portends continuing problemsin precisely those domains of functioning that predict long-term 

 successthrough middle adolescence.

2. There has been a plethora of medication over the last ten years for the treatment of ADD and ADHD. Where does medication 

  fit into the big picture?

The follow-up study just noted was not a treatment study per se; we observed the girls, whether or not they received treatment 

 (about half of the girls with ADHD receive medication during the 5-year follow-up interval). Overall, a host of studies reveal that 

 medication treatments (stimulants) provide clear benefit for over 80% of children with ADHD who receive them. Side effects are 

 usually manageable, but because in the wrong hands stimulants can be drugs of abuse, they should be prescribed only when 

 needed and must be monitored carefully. These medications help with the core symptoms and with some aspects of academic 

 and social performance, but (a) they are typically not sufficient to normalize functioning and (b) their effects do not persist after 

 the last dose is administered. In other words, the medications help alleviate symptoms but do not constitute a cure. Medication 

 effects for some youth with ADHD are night-and-day; more often, they are helpful, but only if concentrated efforts are also put 

 in place to help families with behavior management, to provide teacher consultation, and to provide academic and social skills 

 to the child.

3. What kinds of counseling issues need to be addressed with adolescent girls?

Counseling per se, or play therapy for younger children, is not a proven treatment for ADHD; only medications and behavioral 

 treatments (parent training, school consultation, social skills) are truly evidence based. Yet at the same time, adolescents do 

 not like to feel singled out as needing treatment or having a mental disorder; counseling may assist with self-esteem issues, 

 motivation to keep taking medication, and the like. Also, behavioral parent training with adolescents needs to focus less on 

 star charts and more on contracting and negotiating rewards and punishments between the teen and his or her caregivers.

4. There is always debate as to the incidence of ADD and ADHD. Some liberal individuals indicate it to be about 25 % of the 

 population and other conservatives say 2%. What is your take on this issue?

It&apos;s a lot like saying how much hypertension is there? That is, like blood pressure, ADHD symptoms exist on a continuum in 

 the normal population, and there&apos;s no magic cutoff point above which ADHD clearly occurs and below which it clearly does not. 

 The best estimates, however, using cutoff points that strike a careful balance between under-diagnosis and over-diagnosis, are that about 5% of boys and 2% of girls have clinically significant ADHD.

5. What kinds of counseling should parents of kids with ADHD receive? What kinds of counseling should adolescent girls with 

 ADHD receive? Parents need education about ADHD, support (groups can be helpful here), and explicit training in how to 

 provide more regular and more consistent rewards and punishments. As noted above, adolescent girls need family and school 

 environments that are programmed for consistency and regularity; a sensitive counselor, or an appropriately conducted social 

 skills group, could also be valuable.

6. In terms of conjecture, do you think that girls who have ADD have self esteem, self concept issues that perhaps later leads 

 them into difficulty?

The self-esteem issue is an important, but tricky one. That is, children and adolescents with ADHD often show, over the years, 

 lower overall self-esteem than their peersundoubtedly as a function of the negative feedback they so often receive from 

 parents, teachers, and classmates. On the other hand, compared to how significant others appraise their functioning, youth 

 with ADHD tend to over-rate or over-inflate their own appraisals. These inflated perceptions are most likely to occur in just the 

 domains of functioning in which their own behavior is most problematic. So, at one level, global level self-esteem may be 

 headed downward over time. But at another level, there may be poor self-monitoring (as well as defensiveness) in exactly 

 those areas in which the most improvement is needed. You can see why motivation for change would not routinely be strong.

7. I have read about and see various attention training programs that attempt to help children with ADD pay attention. Are 

 there programs simply too expensive or too labor intensive to be viable and feasible?

It would be great if an individually administered attention training program&apos; could help individuals with ADHD to focus for long 

 periods of time. The problem is that, despite some small case report-style studies, rigorous data from clinical trialsof the 

 types that are plentiful for medications and behavioral treatmentsare simply lacking for such attention training modules. And, 

 to raise a crucial point, even if some of these do show promise in future studies, it is not at all clear that the benefits will 

 generalize from the lab or clinic or study carrel to the classroom or social environment of the child/adolescent. One thing we 

 know for sure about treating individuals with ADHD is that one-on-one interventions typically do not show transfer of their 

 benefits to the everyday worlds where the problems and impairments are most salient.

8. Why is it that girls with ADD later seem to have depression, juvenile delinquency and eating disorders? Do you have any 

 hypotheses regarding this?

There are undoubtedly several pathways. In some cases, the failure experiences generated by ADHD begin a downward spiral. 

 For others, the skill deficits that accrue from poor attention and dysfunctional impulse control mean that youth with ADHD hang 

 out with the wrong crowd and lose interest in the traditional roads to success. For still others, it may be that risk factors 

 (including genes) for ADHD are the same risk factors for depression, antisocial behavior, or eating pathology. In short, we are 

 just beginning to address the mediating factors that explain why ADHD is such a potent risk factor.

9. How hard or difficult is it for parents to get help for their children with ADD? Are the schools doing all they should? How 

 much responsibility should the schools have for adolescents with ADD?

Parents need to be strong advocates, as well as patient teachers and effective behavior managers. Medication treatments 

 have certainly grown in popularity, but they are rarely monitored with sufficient care. Behavioral treatments are hard to obtain 

 in many communities, because of the domination of play therapy and other traditional one-on-one approaches. Public schools 

 are already overburdened budgetarily, and it may well take strong advocacy to get appropriate accommodations and/or 

 school-based behavior management programs in place. Schools are mandated under IDEA to provide appropriate evaluation 

 and accommodations for learning problems related to ADHD, but the actual provision of such is highly variable.

10. Where was your study published and who supported it?

 U.S. SUPREME COURT DENIES REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPERT 

 FEES 

On June 26, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision in Arlington Central School District Board of 

 Education v. Pearl Murphy and Theodore Murphy. The question the Court decided in Arlington v. Murphy was 

 whether the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes parents who win an action (prevail) 

 under the due process provisions of IDEA to recover fees they paid to experts during the case. Many parents find it necessary to hire private experts to observe and evaluate their child and then testify in an action challenging a 
school or districts decision regarding their childs IEP.

Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy 

 and Thomas. The majority opinion states that IDEA does not authorize the reimbursement of expert fees. Justice 

 Ginsberg agreed with this result but wrote a concurring opinion because she disagreed with some of the other 

 statements in the majority opinion. Justice Breyer wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Justices 

 Souter and Stevens. The dissenting Justices argue that IDEA does authorize the reimbursement of these fees. 

 The full text of Arlington v. Murphy can be found at http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-18.pdf . 

 IDEA states that in any action or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award 

 reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing 

 party. The majority opinion rejects the argument that costs includes the reimbursement of expert fees. This 

 conclusion is reached in spite of the fact that the 1986 Conference Report for IDEA clearly states that Congress 

 intended the term attorneys fees as part of the costs to include reasonable expenses and fees of expert 

 witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation 

 of the case. According to the majority opinion, the intent of Congress is not the key issue in this case. Instead, 

 the focus is on whether the language in IDEA gives clear notice to the states that by accepting IDEA funds they 

 might be liable to reimburse prevailing parents for expert fees. The majority of the Court concludes that the 

 terms of the IDEA fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed to attach such a condition to a States 

 receipt of IDEA funds.

The Justices offering the dissenting opinion disagree with the rest of the Courts decision to ignore the intent of 

 Congress. They also argue that IDEAs basic purpose further supports interpreting the provisions language to 

 include expert fees. IDEA guarantees a free and appropriate public education for all children with 

 disabilities and the expense of paying experts to secure an appropriate education undermines this guarantee. 

 Parents have the right to become involved in their childs education and IDEA encourages their participation. The 

 dissenting Justices point out that parents are assured by IDEA that they may question a school districts 

 decisions about what is appropriate for their child and in doing so, they may secure the help of experts. The 

 dissent concludes that the practical significance of the Acts participatory rights and procedural protections may 

 be seriously diminished if parents are unable to obtain reimbursement for the costs of their experts and that 

 experts are necessary because the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections 

 provided in the IDEA lack knowledge about the educational resources available to their child and the 

 sophistication to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

The preceding quote in the dissenting opinion for the Murphy case comes from Justice Ginsbergs dissenting 

 opinion for the Shaffer v. Weast case in 2005. In a prior information bulletin we explained that Shaffer v. Weast 

 places the burden of proof on the party (usually a parent) who is challenging the appropriateness of an IEP, 

 unless there is a state statute placing the burden of proof on the district. The fact that most parents must now 

 prove the inappropriateness of the district-proposed IEP, increases the need for experts.

The combined effect of these two Supreme Court cases is to discourage parents from filing a due process 

 complaint because of the economic impact on their families. NDSS encourages parents to try to resolve 

 disagreements at the school and district level using non-adversarial forms of dispute resolution. However, 

 sometimes parents end up having to choose between filing a complaint or forfeiting their childs educational 

 rights under IDEA.

As a result of the Shaffer and Murphy cases it is more important than ever for parents to be well informed about 

 their childs rights, to develop effective advocacy strategies and to access the free and low cost resources that 

 are available in their communities. The NDSS website (www.ndss.org) and local NDSS affiliates are great sources 

 of information and support. If you need help contacting an affiliate, call NDSS at 800-221-4602. In addition, every 

 state has organizations that are funded to help parents, such as Parent Training and Information Centers (PTIs), 

 Community Parent Resource Centers (CPRCs) and Protection and Advocacy agencies (P&amp;As). A directory of 

 PTIs and CPRCs can be found at http://www.taalliance.org/centers/index.htm

More than 2,500 in Ohio apply for school vouchers
Mother of 2 grateful for state program

Plain Dealer Reporter 

 A few weeks ago, Pam Adams received a letter in her mailbox announcing a new statewide school voucher program.

Eager to find a better education for her two children, Adams jumped at the chance for more information.

After a tour and meeting with the principal of New Covenant Christian Academy in Walton Hills - the closest participating 

 private school - she decided to send her children there in the fall.

She won&apos;t know if her applications for vouchers are approved until the state sends out notifications in a few weeks. If they 

 are, the $6,500 tuition bill for both children will be completely covered by the state.&quot;It makes me feel better about their 

 education,&quot;Adams said of 8-year-old Mark and 9-year-old T&apos;ara, who last year went to John Dewey Elementary School in 

 Warrensville Heights.&quot;It&apos;s difficult to pay for private school.&quot; Mark and T&apos;ara are among 126 Cleveland-area students and 

 2,568 students statewide who have already applied for the new Ohio EdChoice voucher program.

The state legislature last year expanded vouchers far beyond Cleveland by allocating money for 14,000 renewable 

 scholarships. Children who attend low-performing public schools will get up to $4,250 a year for elementary school tuition 

 and $5,000 for high school tuition at participating private schools.

Originally, eligibility was limited to students whose schools have been in&quot;academic emergency&quot;(the lowest of five state 

 rankings) for the past three years. In March, the state expanded the program to include students in schools under&quot;academic 

 watch&quot;(the next-lowest ranking) for three years.

That change pushed the number of eligible students in the Cleveland area from 300 students at Glenbrook Elementary in 

 Euclid to 10 times that many at five different schools.

Students at Forest Park Middle in Euclid, Russell Hobart Middle in Painesville, and Shaw High School in East Cleveland 

 can apply, in addition to those at Glenbrook and John Dewey. A second application period will run from July 21 to Aug. 4.

Though less than 6 percent of the 46,000 eligible students applied in the first period, voucher supporters are not 

 discouraged. The Ohio EdChoice program has the highest first-year participation rate of any voucher program in the country, said Clint Bolick, president of the Phoenix-based Alliance for School Choice.

&quot;It has been an extraordinary turnout,&quot;Bolick said.

&quot;The start-up period is always slow. The concept of school choice is very unfamiliar to most people.&quot;

How Schools Pay a High Price for Failing to Teach Reading
  

 July 3, 2006 

 In Indiana it is difficult to even get a child listed as having a problem. My (Russia-born) son with FAS, ADD, PTSD was 

 passed from 1st to 2nd grade and could not read or write. His language skills are excellent. At my own expense, we had to 

 find a place who could teach him and thankfully found one. I can&apos;t imagine we&apos;d ever be able to recoop our expenses through 

 the school system as they would not even admit he has a problem! To give you an idea of the people I&apos;m dealing with, it took 

 them over 3 hours in a meeting to decide that my other (Russia-born) son was orthopedically impaired. He has no right arm, 

 a 1/2 length left arm, 1 finger, 46 degree curve to his spine, bilaterial hip dysplasia, and one leg is shorter than the other! 

 When the school won&apos;t admit that your child has a problem, can you still try to get reimbursement?
