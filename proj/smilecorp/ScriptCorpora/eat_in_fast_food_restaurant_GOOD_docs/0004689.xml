 Sandra Yi Reporting 
Workers at a trash station in Weber County found the body of a man.
How it ended up there is a horrible tragedy.
In the recycling center at the Weber County Transfer Station, trash is sorted before going out to different locations. Workers sorting through the material made an unusual discovery this morning.
Capt. Klint Anderson, Weber County Sheriff&apos;s Office: &quot;As they were starting to sort through the materials they found some blood, and then they found a body in there.&quot;
The body was that of a 53-year-old man who listed an Ogden homeless shelter as his address. He had checked into a homeless shelter for three nights, but last night he didn&apos;t check in and we don&apos;t know why.

 
Sgt. Dale Bridges, Weber County Sheriff&apos;s Office: &quot;He&apos;s known, at least to law enforcement, as a result of incarceration in the Weber County Jail.&quot;
Police believe the man was sleeping in the dumpster using cardboard and newspaper to keep warm. They believe he was crushed to death.
Capt. Klint Anderson, Weber County Sheriff&apos;s Office: &quot;What they do periodically is they have to compress the load in order to make room for the next one. There was evidence of trauma consistent with compression.&quot;
Police say the dump truck, which picks up recyclable material, made 20 stops this morning. Investigators are tracing the truck&apos;s route to try and locate which dumpster the man was in. They say his death appears to be an accident. Anyone seeking shelter needs to go to a safe place.
Capt. Klint Anderson, Weber County Sheriff&apos;s Office: &quot;They really need to check with the shelters and the religious organizations to find an appropriate shelter so that they are out of the weather and that they are properly taken care of.&quot;
Police are not releasing the victim&apos;s name; they are still notifying family members. He was released from jail just four days ago. He was arrested for unauthorized use of a roadway, which probably means he was begging for money on the street.
Police are treating this death as suspicious as they await the autopsy results.
The workers who found the body were unavailable for comment.
