 yeah same here for me except it is always blue

 Join Date: Dec 2002 Location: Nottingham Posts: 7,987 we should all pool together with different colors of lint, and then sell that on ebay and split the profits

&lt;power rangers&gt;
and when the powers of our lint combine.....
&lt;/power rangers&gt;

there are so many of these auctions you see that ther seller claims they are struggling for food and dont have any money etc
but when you look at past auctions they have bought something in, it doesnt make sense any more, like just being nosey, this guy bought a wireless card, rollerblades, laptop accessories and a nose hair trimmer recently, thats a necessity then isn&apos;t it 
and surely if they were really *struggling* for food they could sell their computer and get rid of the internet, that would save a bit of cash

pah, struggling my arse

There are lots of smaller bids lower down but this is the interesting bit. Surely this isnt for real! __________________

 Join Date: Jan 2004 Location: Texan at heart Posts: 24 Generally I would tend to agree that people are stupid. This is absolutely ridiculous, and probably a scam. But, assuming it isn&apos;t, I can see someone bidding that much out of charity. Probably a scam, but if it isn&apos;t, whoever sold the crap now has food to eat and is probably very happy about it. As much as people are stupid, actually scamming them is wrong. You can rip them off all you want, but lying and saying your starving so you can get money is wrong. Hmm.... the lint could be a good idea. If you really want it to sell though, you&apos;ll need the cooperation of hundreds of thousands mailing lint to someone so they can assemble it all into the world&apos;s largest ball of various body and clothing lint held together entirely by duct tape. Get it in the guiness book of world records and you might actually make some money. __________________
