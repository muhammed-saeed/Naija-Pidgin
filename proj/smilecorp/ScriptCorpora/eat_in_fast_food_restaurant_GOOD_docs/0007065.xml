 Steve Shenk 

In October 2011 it was reported that 68 people in 10 states were sickened by an outbreak of salmonella tied to a “Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain”. It was later determined the chain was Taco Bell. Recently McDonald’s, one of our largest fast-food restaurants in America, issued the following statement:

“For a number of years prior to 2011, to assist with supply, McDonald’s USA used some lean beef trimmings treated with ammonia in our burgers. We were among other food retailers who used this safe product.”

Let that sink in for a moment—“beef trimmings treated with ammonia.” That can’t be right can it? What does that actually mean?

The beef trimmings referred to here are what is left over once all the cuts of beef have been removed from the cow. (These trimmings were once deemed unfit for human consumption and used for dog food). The trimmings are spun in a centrifuge to separate the “meat” from the fat and then the meat is treated with ammonium hydroxide in an attempt to kill all the harmful forms of bacteria present. You may have heard people refer to this “meat” as pink slime. A name as appetizing as the process it went through to get on your table.

Now, look at McDonald’s statement again. Does anything else standout to you? What about “[w]e were among other food retailers…”?

 A d v e r t i s e m e n t 

From this statement, one can safely assume that the use of pink slime is a widely accepted practice in the fast-food industry. Think back over the last year. How often have you eaten at a fast-food restaurant? Do you go out regularly with your co-workers for lunch? Do you stop by on the way home because you’re too tired to cook dinner? Or do you take the kids there for a reward or a family night out? The “why” isn’t as important as is knowing how many times you may have been fed pink slime. How do you feel about a trip through the drive-thru now?

It is also interesting that pink slime is referred to as a “safe product.” It makes you wonder what other “safe products” they are feeding us.
The USDA has approved the use of ammoniated beef trimmings for human consumption. They argue that the beef’s ammonia treatment will kill any bacteria lingering in the beef. But, how much can we trust this process—or the government—when we hear of outbreaks of E. Coli and other harmful bacteria on a regular basis.

So what can you do to protect you and your family? You’ve already taken the first step by beginning to educate yourself on where your food comes from and how it is made. Please continue to do so. With knowledge comes power and the ability to make informed decisions that ultimately lead to peace of mind. It is for this very reason that Alex Jones is committed to providing you with this type of information on an ongoing basis.

Remember, if you are apathetic and passive about your food choices, you leave not only your health but also your well-being in the hands of others. Stop playing “Russian roulette” with your future and take control.
