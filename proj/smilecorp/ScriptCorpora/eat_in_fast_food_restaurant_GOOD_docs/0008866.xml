 depends on which type of fast food restaraunt. Most mcdonalds where i live make around 750,000 a month. Burger kings don&apos;t do well at all, and braum&apos;s makes somewhere in the middle. taco restaraunts make a little less than mcdonalds. wendys is right up there too.

 A fast food restaurant can do anywhere between $250,000 and $2 million per year in sales, McDonalds included. The average is probably somewhere around what Subway and many Taco franchises do, which is around $450,000 per year. Taco Bell is a little higher, likely around $600,000 per year. McDonalds in on the higher end of the spectrum with the top stores doing $2,000,000 or more per year in sales. This is due simply to higher traffic and extended business hours. They choose their location very well. To give you an idea of the traffic it takes to do $2.5 million in sales, the average ticket in McDonalds is no more that $5, that&apos;s probably a little high when you factor in breakfast. For a $7000 day, which it would take 357 of to get to $2.5 million, a McDonalds must sell 1400 $5 meals. That&apos;s one meal every single minute of the day, 24 hours a day. That&apos;s a lot of traffic. Most that business though is packed into the 7-10am, 1130-130pm and 500-800pm hours. That&apos;s why it&apos;s so important to be incredibly organized. That&apos;s no small task.

As far as profit goes, according to the National Restaurant Association, the average profit for all restaurants in the U.S. for 2005 was 4.5%.

In most cases, higher volume restaurants make a lower profit as a percentage of sales, than those in the $400,000 to $1 million range. Mainly because that&apos;s where most delis and pizza concepts fall, and they turn the greatest profits, which can be as high as 30% of sales. A McDonalds can expect to make around a 15% profit margin. The National Restaurant Association&apos;s average for all restaurants is drug down mostly by independent restaurants that make no money, or even lose money.

The fastest growing concepts are those that require a lower startup cost, but average higher profit margins. Subway for example. The average Subway will make a 20-25% profit margin. Well run Subways will make a 28-30% profit margin. The average Subway does $450,000 per year in sales. That means, for an average store, for the fastest growing fast food franchise in the country, you can expect to make a $90,000 to $112,500 profit per year.

People don&apos;t get rich opening a restaurant. They get rich opening 200 restaurants, or having a concept other people will pay them money to own, as in franchising.
