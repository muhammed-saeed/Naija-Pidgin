Editorial Review
 by Contributor at Citysearch, August 05, 2008 
 For more than 60 years, this all-American institution has been serving its signature chicken and home-style sides. 
 In Short 
Established in 1939, this fast-food restaurant still makes its legendary fried chicken with the closely guarded blend of 11 herbs and spices originally created by founder Colonel Sanders. Modern additions to the menu include oven-roasted renditions of its chicken sandwiches, popcorn chicken, potato wedges and wraps. Classic sides include flaky, oversized biscuits, steaming-hot mashed potatoes and gravy, smoky-sweet baked beans and crisp, generously dressed coleslaw. Kids and adults love the &quot;little bucket&quot; parfaits of pudding desserts.
