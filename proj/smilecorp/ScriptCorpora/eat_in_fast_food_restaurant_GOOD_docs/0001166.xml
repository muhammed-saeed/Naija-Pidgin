Skinny Indulgences: My Absolute Favorite Dessert
 
 Tweet 

Life is easy in my Easy Skinny world, because I don’t deprive myself of a favorite dessert if I absolutely, positively LOVE it.  Since I know it is always out there for me as an option, it’s easy to say“no thanks”to any wannabe favorites or runner-up options tossed in front of me each day.

My favorite dessert is a cake created from scratch with real food ingredients by Fiona at a local business called Fiona’s Cakes.  I first discovered it for my wedding cake, and now my entire family orders a very small and economical version of it for special occasions or birthdays.

 Is that gorgeous or what?  Interestingly, it’s Roasted Almond Cake, with Cream Cheese Filling, brushed with extra Amaretto Liquer, and topped with Traditional Vanilla Buttercream Icing.  I order it light on the sugar.

Almond Cake may sound crazy, especially since I don’t like regular nuts in my desserts, but it’s wonderful with just a hint of a kick to it.

My second indulgence is a real, baked from scratch Cheesecake or Hot Apple Crisp!  I can easily bypass the store-bought or big-box types for an occasional homemade version with a homemade crumbly crust.

Visualize your own absolute favorite indulgences and then say no to most of the other desserts or treats that don’t quite make the cut!

There’s always tomorrow, so don’t waste your calories or body on anything but the best.
