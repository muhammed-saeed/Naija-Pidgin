 Flag Close Post a comment Steak N&apos; Shake is a great fast food restaurant, or a place to sit down and enjoy a meal. They resemble the look and feel of a 1950&apos;s dinner and have food that is incredibly good. Steak N&apos; Shake is what I would consider a place to get a good burger although their menu includes a lot more then the stables of burgers and fries. Steak N&apos; Shake is a great place to take the family for a special evening, or just to stop buy and grab a quick bite to eat.
Steak N&apos; Shake makes their signature Steak Burger from 100&amp;Grade A ground beef and it shows. Their burgers are the best from any place that I have ever eaten at, and their fries are absolutely delicious. The fries are very thin shoestring style fries, and having them served with chili and cheese on top is a real treat. And speaking of chili, Steak N&apos; Shake is famous for theirs. Their chili is perfectly seasoned and again they use 100% grade A beef, so you know it&apos;s quality.

Aside form Hamburgers and Fries Steak N&apos; Shake offers a wide variety of other menu items. Their Taco Salad bowls are great, and huge, and Steak N&apos; Shake spaghetti is good, although not the best. They also have a good salad selection and a variety of other kinds of sandwiches and patty melts. No matter what kind of crowd you have coming along with you everyone will find something to love about Steak N&apos; Shake.

Now I could not review Steak N&apos; Shake without talking about their amazing Malts and Milk Shakes. Steak N&apos; Shake has the best Malts and Shakes around. No where else can you get a milk shake that tastes as good as one of the 100% real ice cream shakes that they offer. Also you have unlimited options when it comes to flavors. You can have a straight forward chocolate or vanilla shake, but why not mix it up a bit. How about banana and strawberry? Or Peach and Vanilla? Mint Chocolate chip and Cherry? The choices are endless with the vast number of flavors Steak N&apos; Shake offers, so you&apos;ll never be board.

Expect to pay a bit more when dinning at Steak N&apos; Shake, but you&apos;re getting a lot of food and a lot better quality of food for the price. Steak N&apos; Shake is also a place where you sit down and eat and actually have waitresses and waiters serve you, and their service is top notch. The kind of customer service you receive while at Steak N&apos; Shake is not what you would expect from a regular burger joint, but resembles that of a fine dining establishment, and that&apos;s just what Steak N&apos; Shake is.

Steak N&apos; Shake is a great family restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, great food, and a wide variety of menu items to satisfy any customer. From their service to their food Stake N&apos; Shake is one place that will have my business for as long as they are around.

 Did You Know 
 Steak N&apos; Shake was the target of a false rumor stating that they had a verbal policy banning public prayer in their restaurant. This claim was indeed proven to be false.
