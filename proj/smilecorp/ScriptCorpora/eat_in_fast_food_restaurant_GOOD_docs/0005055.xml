 How to Take an Order in a Fast Food Restaurant 

Edited by Katie and 11 others 
 Pin It Article Edit Discuss History 
Taking an order is not as easy as one might think. When working in a business requiring you to take orders, it is imperative that you first know what you are doing.

 Please note: This article is geared more toward fast food order taking. Being a server in a fine dining establishment is quite different. 
 
 Edit Steps 
 
 1 Smile and greet the customer . 2 Ask the customer if they are ready to order . 3 Listen carefully as the customer places his or her order . 4 Repeat the order to the guest . 5 Enter the order as the customer tells it to you . 6 Read the order back to the customer . 7 Total the order . 8 Tell the customer the amount due . 9 Collect payment from the customer . 10 Give the receipt to the customer . 11 Thank the customer . 

 
 
 Edit Tips 
 
 A quick greeting lets the customer know that he or she is important. Here are a few examples of what a good greeting might be.
 &quot;Hi! How are you today.&quot; &quot;Welcome to&lt;insert your business name here&gt;. &quot;My name is&lt;insert your name here&gt;and I will be your server today. 
 Reading the order back to the customer assures accuracy by allowing the customer to make any changes to his or her order before it is made. Depends on the computer or register system that you company uses, you may be required to enter the order, total the order, and collect payment in a number of ways. Be sure that you know the correct way to use the system before you attempt to take an order. If the customer is paying with a credit or debit card, make sure that you enter the numbers into the credit card machine correctly. Practice makes perfect! Practice taking orders with your family and friends. If the customer is paying cash, be sure to count the money correctly. Also make sure that you count the change out loud as you give it to the customer. Counting the change this way assures that the customer is given the correct amount. Thanking the customer is very important. Here are a few examples of what an order taker might say when thanking the customer.
 &quot;Thank you. Have a nice day!&quot; &quot;We appreciate your business. Please come back soon!&quot; &quot;Thank you and come again!&quot; 
 Always smile and be polite. Treat everyone with kindness and respect!
 Maker sure the your smile is real. Customers can spot a fake smile right away. 
 When working a drive up window, after telling the customer the amount due, the order taker will need to ask the customer to drive up to the window. Once the customer arrives at the window, the order taker will need to repeat the total to the customer once again. Remember: The customer is always right. Make sure the customer leaves happy! 

 
 
 Edit Warnings 
 
 Every business has a set of rules explaining what is expected of an order taker. Always read and follow these rules carefully. Expect that from time you will encounter a irate customer. Always deal with them politely. Don&apos;t allow them to get you angry or upset! Talking too much can put you in jeopardy too. Remember the syllable rule. If a person talks too much, respond with one syllable words as that will shorten the conversation. If they are quiet, use multiple syllable words as it will comfort the customer. It&apos;s all about doing MORE business then the order taker who has more shifts!
