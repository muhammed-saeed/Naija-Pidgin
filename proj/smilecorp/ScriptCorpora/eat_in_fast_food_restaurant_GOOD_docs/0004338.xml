AbstractMy career choices have changed through the
years from mother and housewife through architect,
accountant, or teacher, finally I have arrived at
a computer career. The following is an idea of the
path I have followed. What I want to be When I
Grow UpComing to the point of my current career
choice has been a long road. My idea of what a
career is or should be has changed with
circumstances and age. According to Weintraub
(2005), &quot;the average worker spends only four years
in a job and will have 12 jobs in as many as five
career fields during his or her working life.&quot;
(para.

1) My first career was marriage and
motherhood followed by a surprising healthcare
career. What the future holds waits to be seen.
With a bachelor of science degree in information
technology the options are wide open. Childhood
Career ChoicesMost children seem to have ideas of
what they would like to be when they grow up. The
average person walking into any kindergarten class
today would find future teachers, lawyers,
doctors, nurses, astronauts, firefighters, and
ballerinas; the list is endless. I never had the
chance to even dream about what I wanted to be
when I grew up and was given little chance to
develop my own tastes and ideas towards this goal.
I spent my childhood trying to be the good example
to my younger brother and sister that my father
demanded in his letters

All the while I was
hoping and praying that my mother and father would
get back together. The only thing I knew was being
a mom and that is what I thought I wanted to
be.Adolescent Career ChoicesIn high school my
ideal career seemed to change from day-to-day. I
tried working at a fast food restaurant, and ice
cream parlor, a day care, but none of these led to
any career decisions. I wanted to join the
military so I took the ASVAB but I was not
confident enough in my ability to make it through
basic training so I gave up the idea. I wanted to
be an architect so I applied for admission to the
CAD program at ITT Technical Institute and was
accepted.

I was scheduled to start classes on June
12, 1989, but deep down what I truly wanted was to
a wife and mother and the idea of getting out of
Rantoul, Illinois did not hurt either. My unspoken
desire came to the fore when I met my future
husband in January of 1989. We were married on
June 10, 1989, four days after my high school
graduation and two days before I was supposed to
leave for ITT Tech. He graduated from his Air
Force technical training and received orders to
Clovis, New Mexico. I was getting everything I
wanted, or so I thought.Early Adulthood Career
ChoicesTwo months after my marriage in 1989 I was
pregnant; my high school career choice had been
fulfilled but I was not able to fill it.

I did not
feel satisfied as a stay-at-home mom, and I began
looking for a new career. I started taking classes
at Eastern New Mexico University in Clovis, New
Mexico with a major in accounting. In my second
semester I realized that this was not what I
wanted to do so I switched to a general studies
major taking any class that looked interesting
trying to decide on a major. In my third semester
of classes my first career choice reared its ugly
head and my husband received orders to go to
Germany. We packed up and I was back to trying to
be a stay-at-home mom.

While in Germany I tried a
correspondence course for computer repair. I loved
this but could not keep up the payments when my
husband decided he wanted a divorce. Once I was
back stateside I tried the traditional college
path again. I enrolled at Eastern New Mexico
University in their associates of applied science
in electronics/computer technology but this did
not pan out for me either. I loved working with
computers but working and attending classes
full-time along with raising two children alone
was more than I could handle.

I dropped out of
school and moved to Wisconsin to have the support
of my family. Once in Wisconsin I enrolled at
Blackhawk Technical College in their computer
repair degree but I tired of family taking
advantage of my computer expertise and was not
doing well physically or emotionally so I dropped
out of yet another program.I took a long break
after moving into my mother&apos;s house and dropping
out of Blackhawk Tech. I did not know what I
wanted to do and feared failing yet again. One day
the opportunity to be trained in transcription
fell into my lap. I did not consider this a career
choice at the time but it was a job so I finished
the six month training program in four months and
was offered a job at Memorial Community Hospital.
I had never seen myself in the healthcare field
but here I was.

After less than a year in the
medical records department transcription was
downsized and I was no longer needed. I was
fortunate to have a supervisor that saw potential
in me and I was offered the opportunity to help
develop a new position in the department. Over the
next six months I worked closely with supervision
developing the assistant medical records clerk
position at the hospital. I enjoyed the
development of the position but soon became bored
with the job. An opening became available in the
admissions office so I applied and moved to a new
job and department at the hospital.

Once I had
learned the job I soon became bored with yet
another position and was looking for a new
opportunity. At this point I still did not
consider healthcare a career choice; it was just a
job to pay the bills.In August of 2002, the
medical records department, now called health
information management, found themselves with a
new supervisor. The new supervisor received
approval from upper management to add a new
position to the department, and I was offered the
opportunity to move back to the health information
management department as a transcriptionist/coder.
I jumped at the chance to again try my hand at
developing yet another new position and to learn
medical coding, which was something totally new to
me. I had received a few months of on-the-job
training and was doing well when the part-time
transcriptionist retired and the hospital hired a
second full-time transcriptionist. This gave me
the opportunity to become a full-time coder.

At
this point, after working at the hospital for two
years, I was finally thinking of healthcare as a
career. I have enjoyed the challenge of working in
the healthcare field but have again reached a
plateau. After two years in my current position I
would like to move forward but there is no where
to go. To best facilitate upward career mobility I
enrolled in the bachelor of science degree at
University of Phoenix.Future Career ChoicesToday I
still have not decided what I want to be when I
grow up. I know I would like to work with
computers so I just need to find the opportunity
with a company where I can grow as I learn and
have the opportunity to keep growing.

The
Occupational Outlook Handbook (2004-2005) lists
179 possible jobs related to computers. I am
considering following a programming path and
working for a healthcare software vendor. The idea
of taking my experience in the hospital
environment and transferring it into helping
create programs that work more efficiently for the
job being done appeals to me. With a software
vending company there is also the opportunity of
training users on new software, I have had some
opportunity to do this currently and find it very
rewarding. Another consideration is entering the
healthcare management field.

I have the majority
of the skills to manage the department but not the
degree. With the implementation of the electronic
health record a new field has opened in healthcare
called healthcare informatics; a degree in
computers would be extremely valuable with this
new field and combined with the Registered Health
Information Administrator credential from the
American Health Information Management Association
the opportunities in healthcare management would
be wide open. There is, of course, the possibility
of totally leaving the healthcare field and moving
on to greener pastures. With my future bachelor of
science degree from University of Phoenix I will
have the degree to back up the skills I already
have with computers. With the growth promoted by
the staff at University of Phoenix I should also
have the confidence necessary to sell myself to
potential employers.

The information technology
field is growing exponentially with every new
computer development, which means the career I
choose on graduation in three years might not even
be considered a career today.Something hitherto
unconsidered is the possibility of going on in my
education to receive a master&apos;s or Doctorate. With
a master&apos;s or Doctorate I could even further
change the focus of my career goals; library
science and law are fascinating subjects to
consider. While driving the possibility of tax law
popped into my head. Entering the educational
setting once again has opened my mind to new
directions for my current career and new ideas for
future possibilities.Only time and opportunity
will tell which direction might be taken. Tamara
Orr (2004) states, &quot;few people may know early on
exactly what they want to be, but most of us hop
around and explore different options as we get
older.&quot; (para.

2) This gives me faith that I still
have ample opportunity to make a decision, and I
can always change my mind. I think I would be
happy to follow Robert Frost (1920) and take the
road less traveled by.SummaryIn summary,
throughout my life many career choices have
crossed my mind. I have tried being a stay-at-home
mom and a hospital employee. I am working on
trying computers. The path I chose in computers is
yet to be decided but the opportunities are vast.
My current path leaves me many opportunities in
healthcare and computers but the possibilities do
not stop there.

With further education I could
still do anything. ReferencesBureau of Labor
