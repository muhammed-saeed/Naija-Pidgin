		Garbage People/Children of the Street

Mexico City
 
Martin Trejo, 22, typically makes 20 peso a day, and on a
good day, he can make up to 50 working in the landfill sorting glass from
wood, and paper from plastic. Though he&apos;s up to his knees in other people&apos;s
waste, surrounded by skinny, sick dogs, aggressive flies and flying
garbage on a windy day, he&apos;s happy with the job. He believes it is the only
alternative is unemployment.
The pepenadores (the garbage people) represent a growing part of Mexico
City&apos;s population that is living in extreme poverty. Trejo, like thousands
of others, not only works in the landfill. He also lives there and has built a
small house out of garbage. His closet is in an old cooler, his sofa consists
of two orange old bus seats of plastic, and his calendar sporting pictures
of naked women is, of course, from last year. Trejo has no electricity, no
water, no formal address in the Neza landfill, one of Mexico City&apos;s seven
landfills.
As a consequence of the currency devaluation in 1994, the GDP per capita
dropped over 30 percent to $2,800 in 1995, the severe inequities in
income distribution became even more severe, and the number of people
living in extreme poverty rose.
&quot;There is not only more inequality,&quot; wrote professor of political science
Jorge Castanada in his recent book, &quot;The Mexican Shock.&quot;
&quot;There is a new inequality--and a new poverty--in the hemisphere. It is
produced by the conjunction of the rush to the cities and the
disappearance of the high economic growth rates in Latin America
between 1949-1980. The large majority of the poor and excluded are now
in the cities.&quot;
Arturo Buenrostro is a garbage specialist and has his own NGO, called
&quot;BIO,&quot; which fights to make the lives of the pepenadores more livable.
&quot;The average age is 50. They cook and eat out there and have all kinds of
stomach diseases. Some children die before they are 10. We are fighting
for them first, then for the environment,&quot; said Buenrostro who has been
garbage-stoned out of the landfills. &quot;They don&apos;t like us, because they think
we&apos;ll take away their jobs. But they can&apos;t read or write, and they don&apos;t
understand what we are trying to do.&quot;
According to Buenrostro, the solution is to privatize the whole garbage
industry, so the some 25 million inhabitants pay what it cost to get rid
off their 20,000 tons garbage a day. Today, the industry is run by a mafia,
and the government does nothing about it, because it does not want a
political uproar, said Buenrostro. &quot;By charging people what it cost to get
rid of the garbage, we would force them to think of their consumption.
They&apos;d start buying food without so much packaging, and they&apos;d have to
sort their garbage from their home.&quot;
Yet, his visions are not visible on the Mexican horizon. With an unofficial
unemployment rate in the 50 percent range, the low value of the peso for
the Mexicans, and a fight for food and other basics to stay alive, there is
not space for environmental considerations.
So, Martin continues his job in The Lost City (another name for the
landfills).
Three times a week he does get out of the garbage. Next to the landfill,
CPJ Neza Ac. has a playground. Here, Martin plays football twice a week
with the other pepenadores and the kids in the neighborhood, and then,
once a week, there&apos;s even a rock concert, he can attend.
Neza Ac. is a part of the coalition &quot;Axis-Urban Courage,&quot; that
will be present at the Habitat Conference in Istanbul this June. The NGO
has been labeled as one of Habitat II&apos;s Best Practices projects. It works
for young people&apos;s rights and their well-being. CPJ Neza has playground for
football and rock concerts, a workshop to produce furniture and t-shirts
and a kitchen to give out free meals once a day. Here young people not only
get their basic needs catered to, they get politically sensitized, and some
of them are even led to a new path in life.
 
Mexico City&apos;s Children of the Street
 
Marceo Antonio, 18, gave his puppy another hug and smiled.
He had just come up from his home, a hole in the ground in the center strip
of Insurgentes, one of Mexico City&apos; many noisy, smoggy highways. The dirt
in his nostrils made him sneeze, and he coughed because of the turpentine
he was sniffing. Marceo&apos;s smile was not a happy one. He was just shy and
high. &quot;If I could chose,&quot; he stammered, &quot;I&apos;d leave the street and get a job.
But I don&apos;t think it is possible.&quot;
Marceo does not believe he has a chance to get a better life, ever, he said.
He has no hopes for his future and he is not alone. In the overpopulated
city, the number of street children is on the rise. Children, who live and
work in the streets, do whatever they can to scrape by. Some dress up as
clowns to make people pay for a laugh, other wash car windows, sell
gadgets or simply beg. According to a recent survey from La Comision
Economica para America Latina y el Caribe 17 percent of the youth
population in the city work in the streets. That amounts to two million.
Casa Alianza, a Latin-American NGO for street kids, has reached the same
conclusion. But far fewer kids actually live in the streets like Marceo.
According to the latest UNICEF survey, there are 14,000 kids living in the
streets. &quot;But that number is definitely higher. Our own government has
estimated that it is more like 25-30,000, and that&apos;s the minimum,&quot; said
Jose Capellin Corrada, National Director of Casa Alianza. &quot;We, alone,
approach 1,300 new kids every year.&quot;
Marceo&apos;s home at the end of the hole in the ground is crammed as a cell
and furnished with a couple of blankets, one pillow, and brown dust. He
shares it with 10 to 12 other street kids. There&apos;s another hole close by,
and in total the group amounts to 30. Carlos, 12, lives in the same hole as
Marceo. &quot;There are not only more street kinds, because of the crisis, but
they also get younger and younger. Today we get them down to eight years
old,&quot; said Omar Santiago, Casa Alianza Street Team Coordinator. &quot;Their
parents ask them to go out and find jobs, but in the streets they get
trapped in gangs, start sniffing pvc or glue, or even smoke marihuana or
crack, which we did not see a couple of years ago.&quot;
All around the group&apos;s &quot;territory,&quot; empty, yellow cans lie around. The
turpentine-like fluid costs 5 pesos (less than a dollar) a piece.
Casa Alianza tries to convince the children to leave the streets for
shelters in order to start a rehabilitation process (first shelter, then a
transition house, and then a girls&apos; house or a boys&apos; house where they attend
school), and finally, they can either go back to their parents, if they have
any, or start living a &apos;normal&apos; independent life.
Casa Alianza did not succeed in convincing Marceo, and now he&apos;s 18 and too
old. They did succeed with Fanny, 16 and mother of four-month-old
Asucena. Fanny, pregnant after a one-night-stand with a security officer
twice her age who picked her up at the bus station, has changed her mind
after coming to Casa Alianza. But it is primarily because of Asucena, she
said. &quot;She gives me a meaning in life, she makes me strong, and I&apos;ll fight
for her.&quot;
&quot;Each year 100 of our children go back to their families,&quot; Corrada said,
responding to questions on success rates. &quot;15 percent come back or end up
in the street. Each night 150 boys and girls sleep in our houses, and they
typically stay for a year, unless they have no other options.&quot;
Carlos, 12, has been on the street for two years and is likely to soon move
to a shelter. Others are just not motivated, like Alberto, 13. He&apos;s the
groups most active car window washer and can make up to 50 peso a day
(almost $7). He&apos;s got dreams, and he knows what he would do, if he won
the &quot;life&quot; lottery. &quot;I&apos;ll go to California,&quot; he said. But he did not mean the
US State of California, he meant the fast-food restaurant by the same name
on the other site of Insurgentes.
