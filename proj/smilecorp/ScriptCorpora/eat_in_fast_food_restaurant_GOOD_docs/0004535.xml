Legacy Wine Clubs Selected to Develop Exclusive eCommerce Technology for Lufthansa U.S. WorldShop Program

 Through a new eCommerce Web site developed by Legacy Wine Clubs, Inc., Lufthansa frequent flyers will have the ability to trade miles for wine, gourmet food, and kitchen products. 

(PRWEB) August 31, 2005 -- Legacy Clubs, Inc., the Napa, CA-based provider of eCommerce technology and wine club management tools, has today announced a strategic partnership with Lufthansa Worldshop and Bedford Forum, LLC, a New York - based marketing group specializing in ultra premium and luxury brands. Through this partnership, Lufthansa&apos;s Miles&amp;More frequent flyers will have the ability to redeem their frequent flyer miles for premium wines, gourmet foods, cookware, and home products provided by such prominent brands as Dean&amp;Deluca, Viking Range, and Harney&amp;Sons Fine Teas.

Lufthansa, with more than 1.3 million U.S. – based frequent flyer members and 10 million worldwide, counts among its member base some of the most cultured and well-traveled individuals in the world. Through this new website: LH-Worldshop-Gourmet.com, Lufthansa&apos;s U.S. members will have an abundance of options in redeeming miles accumulated over years of membership.

Lufthansa&apos;s demographic profile indicates that its members are more discriminating, more traveled, and more informed. They have higher disposable incomes, higher educational levels, and a taste for indulgence, making this the ideal audience for exclusive wines and other luxury goods.

Legacy Clubs was selected to provide the eCommerce environment for this project based on its industry leading technology and inside knowledge of the intricacies involved in the shipping of wine. &quot;For this project we were presented with the challenge of developing a &quot;dual currency&quot; environment, that will allow Lufthansa&apos;s Miles&amp;More members the option of paying with miles, cash, or a combination of both.&quot;, said Richard Kline, President and CEO of Legacy Clubs, Inc. &quot;Our experience in developing custom web solutions for numerous wineries and third party programs meant that we could easily meet the challenge.&quot; The program is scheduled to launch on October 1, 2005.

New Vine Logistics of Napa, CA was selected as fulfillment partner for this project based on their advanced shipping model which enables the sale of wine directly to consumers in up to 43 states, in full compliance with the laws of each state. By partnering with New Vine, the program gains the ability to offer ultra premium Napa Valley wines to a large majority of program members.

Wineries interested in including their wines in this program should contact Legacy Clubs. Inc. at 707.253.7400.

Café Don Pablo Outsells National Brands in Test in South Florida Supermarket Chain

 The Café Don Pablo line of specialty coffees roasted by Burke Brands, Inc., North Miami Beach, Florida, outsold all of the national specialty coffee brands represented, including Starbucks, in a test store in the Miami area. 

(PRWEB) August 31, 2005 -- The supermarket, which is located in an upscale Miami suburb, and is part of a 28-unit chain that serves a diverse, though mainly Hispanic clientele, sold 52 twelve ounce bags of Café Don Pablo in a thirty-day period.

“The magic is in the brand,” says Darron Burke, President of Burke Brands. “Besides being a high quality, fresh-roasted, great tasting coffee, Café Don Pablo was created as a crossover product, and its name, packaging, and unique selling proposition has significant appeal to both upscale Hispanics, and non-Hispanic specialty coffee consumers.”

Burke adds that “Hispanics living in the US are very proud of the coffee tradition in Latin America, and non-Hispanic gourmet coffee connoisseurs realize that much of the world’s best tasting coffee comes from that region.”

The Café Don Pablo line is comprised of over 75 specialty coffees including various single origins, blends, roasts, flavors, organics, and fair trade coffees. “Our coffees are tailored to the tastes of specific consumer groups, Burke explains. “Hispanics traditionally enjoy their coffee roasted a bit darker, as do west coast connoisseurs, while New Englanders, for example, tend to lean towards a medium to light roast. Meanwhile, flavored coffees are becoming more popular than ever, and our Dulce de Leche coffee is proving to be a real winner across cultures.”

The company expects positive sales results in supermarkets across the country. “We’re confident that the timing couldn’t be better for Café Don Pablo,” Burke asserts. “There’s been an explosion of growth in the Hispanic population and a marked increase in that demographic’s purchasing power; this coupled with the swiftly rising demand for specialty coffee, and an interest in cultural exchange, particularly in food, puts Café Don Pablo in a favorable position to become a leader in the specialty coffee category nationwide.”

Burke, who holds an M.B.A. and a Masters of International Management, has been involved in coffee production since meeting his Colombian-born wife and business partner Eliana Burke, in 1989. The couple and their company were recently featured on the internationally broadcast Mananitas show on the Hispanic television network Telemundo.

Coaxing Kids To Eat Healthier Back At School? They Just May Take the Hint

 With juvenile diabetes and other sugar-related problems on the rise, the question on the minds of many parents, teachers and health officials is, &quot;How do we teach young people better eating habits?&quot; All-natural HINTKIDS Apple water may be one of the easiest answers. With sleek upscale packaging and nothing artificial, HINTKIDS makes drinking water cool, and it tastes great. 

(PRWEB) August 31, 2005 -- With juvenile diabetes and other sugar-related problems on the rise, the question on the minds of many parents, teachers and health officials is, &quot;How do we teach young people better eating habits?&quot; All-natural HINTKIDS Apple water may be one of the easiest answers. With sleek upscale packaging and nothing artificial, HINTKIDS makes drinking water cool, and it tastes great.

Recently hailed as “what to drink” on Splendora.com’s Style Forecast, HINTKIDS Apple water is the trendy drink that parents can feel good about. And for the adult palate, HINT is available in Cucumber, Lime and Tangerine.

HINT, Inc. CEO Kara Goldin created HINTKIDS for her own children because she didn’t want them drinking artificially sweetened beverages loaded with preservatives.

Unlike similar looking “water beverages,” HINTKIDS premium water has NO artificial sweeteners, NO sugar, and most importantly no artificial flavors, additives or preservatives. That’s right -- no Splenda and no cornsyrup.

HINTKIDS is pure water with natural flavors. This delicious healthy alternative to sugary juices, sodas and sweetened water beverages allows kids and parents alike to say “goodbye” to messy juice boxes and “hello” to refreshing water with a fruity kick that kids crave.

Experts agree that sweetened drinks and juices are the biggest source of empty calories for kids and are a major contributor to life long obesity. And just this past week, the American Beverage Association recommended limiting the availability of soft drinks in schools across the country, a move that comes amid increased pressure to curb the epidemic of childhood obesity.

“It starts early, this addiction to juices, sugar and sweeteners,” says HINT CEO, Kara Goldin. “At birthday parties, school functions and in the vending machines, sugary drinks are inescapable. We need to cut back on all that sweet stuff and help our kids break the sugar habit.”

“HINTKIDS offers our children a great tasting alternative. My four kids, the ultimate focus group, love it. HINTKIDS tastes like fresh fruit dunked in water and the twisty cap is perfect for little fingers and mouths. My message to families: drink water, not sugar.”

HINTKIDS Apple water is sold in natural and specialty food groceries nationwide and will be available in many Whole Foods stores in Northern California in September. Additional HINTKIDS flavors (coming soon) will include Grape, Tropical Punch and Mixed Berry.

Transitions Lifestyle System Adds Delicious Entrees And Bars

 New additions to help continue low-glycemic success stories. 

GREENSBORO, NC (PRWEB) August 31, 2005 -— As the low-carb diet fad withers away, a few diet marketers have expanded their lines of scientifically sound, glycemic index-based weight management systems. Transitions Lifestyle System, an exclusive Market America brand, has added new entrees and “On the Go” bars to an already impressive line of weight management products based on low-glycemic eating and simple lifestyle changes.

The Transitions entrees are low-glycemic index, portion-controlled alternatives to unhealthy eating. Perfect for a healthy lunch or dinner, Transitions’ nutritionally balanced entrees come in a variety of flavors to fit varying tastes. The newest flavors are chicken with barbecue sauce, lemon herb chicken and vegetarian chili.

Also introduced were two new “On the Go” nutrition bars. All Transitions nutrition bars are high in protein and rich in fiber. The bars low-glycemic snacks to help curb cravings and hunger between meals. The newest flavors added are double chocolate crisp and chocolate raspberry crisp. Both new flavors are vegetarian-friendly.

Designed by best-selling author and 20-year veteran of nutrition science Shari Lieberman, Ph.D., Transitions Lifestyle System draws upon a well-established and evaluated method of weight management based on the Glycemic Index of foods. Glycemic Index (GI) measures how quickly foods impact blood sugar levels. Carbohydrates that break down slowly and help keep blood sugar levels stable are considered “good carbs.”

“Low glycemic eating has been used by diabetics for years,” said Lieberman. “Transitions offers low-carb diet victims a way to lose weight without trying another fad diet that may leave them worse off than when they started. The key to long-term weight loss is to make small changes in how you live. Consumers are now realizing that fad diets like the low-carb way, do not work over a long period. Low glycemic eating is a more natural, scientifically reviewed method of weight management that continues to provide success stories.”

ABOUT SHARI LIEBERMAN, Ph.D.
Dr. Lieberman earned her Ph.D. in clinical nutrition and exercise physiology. She is a Certified Nutrition Specialist, a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition, a member of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, a board member of the Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists and President of the American Association for Health Freedom. She is the recipient of the National Nutritional Foods Association 2003 Clinician of the Year award. She is a published scientific researcher and a presenter at numerous medical conferences. Dr. Lieberman has been in private practice as a clinical nutritionist for more than 20 years and serves on the faculty of two universities.

Marler Clark files second Salmonella lawsuit against Orchid Island Juice Co.

 A second Salmonella lawsuit was filed against Orchard Island Juice Co by Marler Clark. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a North Carolina woman who became ill with Salmonellosis after drinking the company&apos;s unpasteurized orange juice in June. 

(PRWEB) August 30, 2005 -- Marler Clark, the Seattle law firm with a successful track record of representing victims of Salmonella poisoning, and respected Asheville, NC attorney Mark Kurdys, filed a second lawsuit against Orchid Island Juice Co. of Fort Pierce, Florida, Friday. The firm represents Barbara Jane Dooley, a 72-year-old Jackson County, North Carolina resident who became ill with Salmonellosis after consuming Orchid Island unpasteurized orange juice in June while dining at a restaurant with her husband. The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (Case no. 2:05CV215).

In the complaint, it is alleged that Mrs. Dooley drank Orchid Island Juice on June 4, 2005 and became ill with symptoms of a Salmonella infection two days later. Because of the severity of her illness, Mrs. Dooley was admitted to the hospital on June 6, and remained there for seven days. Lab work conducted while Ms. Dooley was hospitalized confirmed that she was suffering from a Salmonella infection, and that she was infected with a strain of Salmonella genetically indistinguishable from that isolated from Orchid Island unpasteurized orange juice.

“Mrs. Dooley, like so many Americans, routinely had a glass of orange juice with breakfast. She never imagined that something as simple as this would endanger her life, or end up putting her in the hospital for a week,” said Denis Stearns, a partner with Marler Clark.

Since 1995, at least four Salmonella outbreaks have been traced to unpasteurized orange juice. Marler Clark attorneys represented over 100 people in a lawsuit against Sun Orchard after orange juice made by the company was determined to be the source of a Salmonella outbreak that made over 400 people sick and killed one. Stearns continued, “It is time for the FDA to stand up to the few remaining producers of unpasteurized orange juice and either require pasteurization, or at least require restaurants to tell their customers that they are being served a possibly unsafe product. No one should be allowed to unknowingly drink unpasteurized orange juice.”

The FDA issued a nationwide warning to consumers against drinking unpasteurized orange juice products distributed under a variety of brand names by Orchid Island Juice Company on July 8, 2005. At that time, Michigan, Ohio, and Massachusetts were reporting cases of Salmonella Typhimurium infection connected to consumption of the juice. At least sixteen other states reported cases of Salmonella Typhimurium infection that matched the specific strain. A recall was issued on July 15, 2005 (see http://www.fda.gov).

Marler Clark (www.MarlerClark.com) has represented thousands of people who consumed Salmonella-contaminated foods such as orange juice, cantaloupe, sprouts, almonds, and cereal. The firm sponsors an informational Web site about Salmonella (www.About-Salmonella.com) and a site about Salmonella litigation (www.SalmonellaLitigation.com).

(PRWEB) August 28, 2005 -- From January to June 2005, Dining Downunder conducted a global survey on hotel cuisine promotions which was completed by over 650 in the hotel and restaurant industry.

The survey was developed to identify the challenges for hotels in hosting cuisine promotions and to allow hotels to evaluate future promotions and distinguish the profitability of a particular event.

Guest chefs are commonly invited to host hotel promotions around the world. However many promotions are still seen as significant cost centres and run for public relations rather than as for what they should be - serious revenue generators and opportunities to train the kitchen brigade in specific cuisine offerings.

The survey addressed 14 key areas;

1. How often does your property run cuisine promotions?
2. Why run a cuisine promotion?
3. What cuisine is the most popular?
4. Do you feature a guest chef for cuisine promotions?
5. Is the reputation or celebrity status of the guest chef important?
6. Average length of a hotel cuisine promotion?
7. Does your hotel try to gain sponsorship for cuisine promotions?
8. Do sponsors feel that they got value for their investment?
9. Average budget for each cuisine promotion in US Dollars?
10. For what market segment is the cuisine promotion predominantly focused?
11. How many room nights does a cuisine promotion typically generate?
12. What factors contributed to your least successful promotion(s)?
13. Have your cuisine promotions been increasingly successful?
14. What do you feel makes a cuisine promotion successful?

The results were very surprising and paint a realistic picture of the industry today and also direct readers to think outside the square to attract attendees to future promotions and look at what opportunities they offer potential guests.

Volcanica Coffee Company Launches, Makes Available Exotic Gourmet Coffees from Volcanic Mountain Regions Around the World

 Today, Volcanica Coffee Company announces the official launch of the company and website, VolcanicaCoffee.com. Volcanica Coffee is a specialty coffee importer and retailer of single origin gourmet coffee beans grown on volcanic soil. 

Fort Lauderdale, FL (PRWEB) August 27, 2005 -- Announcing the launch of Volcanica Coffee™ Company, making available the finest exotic gourmet coffees from volcanic mountains regions around the world.

Today, Volcanica Coffee Company announces the official launch of the company and website, www.VolcanicaCoffee.com. Volcanica Coffee is a specialized importer and retailer of single origin gourmet coffee beans grown on volcanic soil.

&quot;We discovered that the common trait among the finest gourmet coffees from around the world is that they originate from high altitude volcanic mountains&quot; said Diane Contreras, Volcanica vice president of sales. &quot;Our focus is on importing only the exotic gourmet coffee varieties from the various volcanic regions around the world.&quot;

Volcanica Coffee searched and found the finest coffees from Costa Rica, Kona - Hawaii and the Jamaican Blue Mountains. At 3,000 to 7,000 feet above sea level on the slopes of what are currently active or inactive volcanoes, the coffee plants are nourished by rich nutrients found in the volcanic soil, abundant moisture and cloud cover.

The fertile conditions on volcanic mountains produce better beans, not only because they have the effect of increasing the acidity of the bean and thereby improving the flavor, but also because the cold nights that occur at the higher altitudes mean that the trees develop more slowly, which also allows the beans to develop a fuller flavor. The regular rainfall that is caused by precipitation at the higher altitudes is also essential for the proper development of the trees.

&quot;The volcanic mountain growing conditions result in a remarkable smooth and rich taste that is unmatched by any other variety,&quot; continues Contreras. &quot;We established relationships directly with the farmers that meet our high standards of consistently providing the best beans from the best coffee growing regions. We do not offer any coffee blends as we believe that people need to enjoy and experience the rich flavor offered by 100% pure single origin coffees. Most importers and retailers mix the finer coffee beans with cheaper ones diluting the true flavor. Volcanica Coffee offers single origin coffees from the Costa Rica Tarrazu region, the Kona region in Hawaii and the Jamaican Blue Mountains with plans to import from other regions.

Volcanica Coffee is a specialty importer and retailer of exotic single origin gourmet coffee beans. The Company is committed to offering only the finest quality coffee from volcanic regions around the world that is wonderfully exotic and remarkable in taste.

 L’Academie de Cuisine has been named the Training Center for the United States World Pastry Cup Team. The USA World Pastry Cup Team competes every two years at the Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie in Lyon, France, the Olympics of the culinary world. L’Academie will also host the National Competition, where twelve finalists will compete for the three slots on the USA World Pastry Cup Team. 

(PRWEB) August 26, 2005 -- Francois Dionot, Founder and Director of L’Academie de Cuisine, announced today that L’Academie has become the Training Center for the United States World Pastry Cup Team. The USA World Pastry Cup Team competes every two years at The Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie in Lyon France.

Dubbed the &quot;most delectable competition in the world&quot;, the Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie brings together the world&apos;s premiere pastry chefs from 22 countries to participate in the two-day event in Lyon, France. Each country presents a team of three people selected during a national heat: a pastry-cook, a chocolate maker and an ice-cream maker/ice-sculptor.

The purpose of the Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie is not only to highlight the skills and new gastronomical ideas of some of the world’s finest pastry chefs, but to inspire and share with others. The World Pastry Cup teams will demonstrate their creativity and technical skills in the making of:

Lifesaving Vegan School Halfway There Says Author

 UK Authors of best selling Vegan Cookbook say another £500,000 ($1million) donated to their planned International School of Health, Nutrition&amp;Vegan Culinary Arts will save peoples&apos; lives. They insist their sustainable vegetarian Island development is the Wight stuff for ethical investment and will make a difference to people, the environment and animals. 

(PRWEB) August 26, 2005 -- In less than only a week Tony Bishop-Weston (award winning vegan cook) and his wife Yvonne (top London nutritionist) have raised half the capital they need to buy a UK farm on the Isle of Wight and establish a Vegan culinary arts school but need another half a million pounds ($1 million) to make their dream come true.

A Good Life Showcase

Following the success of their healthy vegan cookbook (vegan by Hamlyn ISBN 0600611906 USA /0600609154 UK http://www.vegan-cookbook.com) Tony and Yvonne hope to combine their skills once again to turn a former pig farm into an education centre for nutritional health and sustainable living.

There&apos;s nothing like leading by example – they have plans for accommodation, a restaurant, café and organic farm shop, bio fuel recycling centre, 4 acres of organic Wight hempseeds, a plush therapy room, an organic orchard, and the international vegan school of culinary arts.

Raw Appeal

As well as basic academy courses for chefs to learn the basics of nutrition and alternative vegan cooking methods there will be courses on gourmet raw food techniques and celebrity vegetarian Asian chefs will be invited to reveal their techniques too.

Ten a Day Tuition

&quot;It&apos;s all very well The World Health Organisation and Governments saying we should eat up to ten portions of fruit and vegetables a day but until someone targets the world&apos;s chefs, teaches them about basic human nutrition needs and teaches them how to adapt the way they cook – there&apos;s a big brick wall for consumers&quot; says Yvonne, a tutor at The Institute of Optimum Nutrition.

Strategy for mass market appeal

&quot;People are unlikely to change if it&apos;s difficult – it&apos;s easy to buy a big Mac, McDonalds are everywhere – it&apos;s much harder to find a quinoa and wild mushroom and organic herb tabouleh or even basic dairy-free ice cream. We are on a mission to convince chefs that nutritious and delicious food that everyone can enjoy makes viable economic sustainable sense&quot; says Tony who used to own a world renowned vegan guest house in Scotland.

Soysage Sponsors

Tony and Yvonne don&apos;t get royalties from their internationally selling Hamlyn book so they urgently need backers and sponsors to fund this project. They promise big rewards with exclusive rights for manufacturers and producers of vegan products who jump on board now and support them from the outset.

TV Deal

As well as a book deal with a US publisher they are already negotiating a deal with Vegetarian Internet TV Production Company Veggievision to produce a series of free Vegan Cooking DVDs based on the courses on the Isle of Wight. They say this alone represents an excellent opportunity for mainlining straight into the foodservice industry, gaining market share and brand awareness.

The Wight stuff

&quot;The Isle of Wight has a buoyant Tourist trade for good reason. It has everything including property prices that are far better value than the mainland that means our dream has a chance of success – we are already halfway there!&quot; Yvonne enthuses.


Editors Notes

Yvonne worked for UK health food chain Holland and Barrett, before running the vegetarian restaurant chain Cranks. As senior nutritionist and catering consultant for The Food Doctor Yvonne sits on various catering committees for global corporations dealing with foodservice giants such as Sodexho, Aramark and Compass. Yvonne now runs her own catering and nutrition consultancy Foods For Life and is also a tutor at the prestigious Institute of Optimum Nutrition in London. She gained notoriety when she told vegetarian manufacturers from the Food and Drink Federation that they needed to try harder to make their products nutritious as well as delicious. She has written for various newspapers and magazines.

Tony grew up in a London delicatessen obsessed by fine food. After establishing an award winning vegan guesthouse in the Highlands of Scotland Nr Ullapool he joined first The Vegetarian Society and then The Vegan Society as business development officer. He is author of two vegan cookbooks and has had a diverse career from drive-time radio presenter to lifeguard and Webmaster. He has been involved with various developmental and support agencies such as STB area consultative committee and Federation of Small Businesses. Tony has helped various small businesses get started and co-ordinated the Diamond Jubilee Awards for the 60th Anniversary of The Vegan Society.

Hilton Research Suggests Link Between Staff Loyalty and E-learning

 Research commissioned by Hilton International, the hotel company, strongly suggests that there is a link between employee development and reduced staff turnover. 

(PRWEB) August 26, 2005 -- In a survey completed by 1,854 team members across all parts of Hilton International&apos;s business worldwide, 37 per cent say that being offered development opportunities is the most important factor in them deciding to continue their career with Hilton. A further 50 per cent say that although it isn&apos;t &apos;the&apos; factor, being given the opportunity to develop professionally is very important to them.

Hilton team members across the globe are able to access a wide range of learning activities through Hilton University, the group&apos;s online learning platform. These include:

550 SkillSoft e-learning courses - covering business, professional and IT skills

Books24x7 Referenceware – featuring best-selling management, business and technology books and reference materials

Online mentoring

Virtual classroom environments

Team members also have the opportunity to visit the Hilton University Bulletin Board, which is used increasingly to share ideas and best practice with colleagues in other countries.

The survey, whose participants remained anonymous, took place online during the summer of 2005. As well as helping to prove the link between training and staff loyalty, it also highlighted how learning is being applied in the workplace. 90 per cent of respondents are convinced that the resources they access through Hilton University help them with their professional development and an astonishing 95 per cent believe that what they learned yesterday during a learning activity can be used today in their work.

The link between learning and development and team member loyalty is further reinforced by 95 per cent of respondents who say that they appreciate the opportunity Hilton is giving them to develop their knowledge. 98 per cent go on to say that they would recommend Hilton University to colleagues.

Commenting on the survey findings, Maarten Staps, International Learning and Development Manager for Hilton International said:

“We are committed to ensuring that we offer the best learning experiences to our team members, so it is encouraging to see real proof that they are using the Hilton University for both professional and personal development.

“Our focus will continue to be on the quality and relevance of the learning activities available through Hilton University. However, the increase in employee loyalty and the potential reduction in staff turnover as a result of this commitment is a welcome knock-on effect!”

Notes to editors

Since the launch of the award-winning Hilton University in February 2002, e-learning has become an integral part of the learning and development activities within Hilton International. Organised in seven faculties and accessible online by all Hilton International employees, Hilton University provides a central and structured learning infrastructure and resource.

Codex Allows Seven Deadly Pesticides Banned by Stockholm Convention and US Law

 Although Codex says it is focused on &quot;Consumer Protection&quot; the Codex Alimentarius Commission now allows seven of the 12 deadliest compounds on earth to be used on food. These seven deadly pesticides are banned by US law and the Stockholm Convention, which the US and every member of Codex signed. 

The Stockholm Convention, signed by 176 countries including the United States (May 2005) commits the signatories to eliminate world&apos;s 12 most dangerous Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs . The (CAC)Codex Alimentarius Commission, (made up of 171 countries, including the US, uses consensus to set the world’s rules for international trade in food) allows seven of the twelve agreed upon killer POPs to be used in the production of foods as varied as milk, soy oils, cotton seed, citrus fruits, eggs, poultry, cereal grains, pineapples, leafy and root vegetables, legumes and others.

POPs remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms and are highly toxic to humans and wildlife. They increase brain, bladder, biliary, lung, breast and other cancers, cause damage to the kidney, liver, adrenals and thyroid, can cause decreased fertility, immune suppression, diabetes, porphyria, cardiovascular disease, fatal skin lesions especially in children and nursing infants (“pink sore”), headache, dizziness, nausea, general malaise, and vomiting, followed by muscle twitching, myoclonic jerks and convulsions.

All of the killer POPs pose shared health threats but each has its own special hazards. Endrin, for example, is 2-4 times more toxic than the better known DDT, and tends to accumulate in children.
Chlordane, banned in the US in 1988, paralysis cancer-fighting cells and doubles rates of lung and brain cancer in exposed persons. As a group, the seven deadly pesticides are known to increase the effects of the other toxic substances. Codex allows them in food.

Scientists estimate that the misuse of POPs leads to thousands of excess deaths, millions of disabilities and billions of lost dollars annually.

The seven restricted POPs banned by both the Stockholm Convention and US law but permitted by Codex are
Aldrin, Chlordane, ,
Dieldrin,
Endrin, Heptachlor, Hexachlorobenzene and Mirex.
Toxiphene and DDT are the only two POPs pesticides on the Stockholm POPs list which Codex does not allow.

The Natural Solutions Foundaton is deeply concerned about the apparent lack of science-based decision making since excellent alternatives exist to the use of these deadly toxins.

Stirling Products Limited (ASX: STI) Produces 30 Per Cent Leaner Chicken In Trial Using Beta Agonist Growth Promotion Product Says CEO Dr. Calvin London

 Stirling Products Limited (ASX: STI) says chickens with nearly 30 percent less fat have been produced in a trial using a new animal growth promotion agent, ST810, the same compound (R-salbutamol) that is the active ingredient used to treat asthma in humans. 

(PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- Chickens with nearly 30 percent less fat have been produced in a trial using a new animal growth promotion agent.

Perth-based biotechnology company Stirling Products Limited (ASX: STI) www.stirlingproducts.net initiated the study to measure the effects of ST810, the same compound (R-salbutamol) that is the active ingredient used to treat asthma in humans.

“The results are significant because they confirm our belief that this product will have major benefits for both consumers and producers in producing chickens with more lean muscle and less fat in a more efficient and environmentally sound way,” said Stirling Managing Director, Dr Calvin London.

The study was completed at Massey University in New Zealand and follows similar results produced in pig trials.

“These trails confirm ST810 works across a range of animal species and based on data from the United States Department of Agriculture, producers can achieve price premiums of nearly 30 per cent for chickens with less than 20 per cent fat,” Dr London said.

Other significant results from the trial found ST810 increased muscle or lean meat by nearly 11 per cent and improved feed efficiency and carcass recovery by 5 per cent.

The poultry industry is expected to be a major market for the product because the world consumes more than 46 billion chickens each year, with 9 billion of these in the US.

About Stirling Products:

Stirling Products is commercializing patented animal growth promoters that turn fat into protein and improve feed efficiencies in poultry, sheep, pigs, cattle and fish. These products will play a major role in reducing the global use of antibiotics and steroids for animal growth promotion.

About ST810:
ST810 is a beta agonist growth promoter and fine-tunes the metabolism in animals to produce more lean muscle and less fat in a range of animal species. It is considered a viable alternative to the use of antibiotics and steroids, which are being banned in many countries because of disease resistance and human health concerns.

About The Chicken Trial:
The aim of the study was to determine the lowest dose of ST810 that did not produce an effect and compare this to the lowest dose that was commercially viable.

The study was designed to decrease the doses of ST810 in chickens to determine this no-effect dose level. Performed in broiler chickens at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand under the supervision of Dr Ravi Ravindran, 21-day old broiler chickens (120 male and 120 females) were studied for their response to low doses of ST810 in the feed.

The broiler chickens were divided equally (24 birds/group) among five different treatment groups – a control, a group receiving 1 ppm, 2 ppm, or 5 ppm of ST810 and an additional group that were fed a diet containing 5ppm of ST810 supplemented with 100 ppm of zinc bacitracin (an antibiotic commonly used in the poultry industry).

Birds were fed a commercial pellet diet (with or without ST810) from day 21 to day 42. Individual body weights and pen feed intake were recorded weekly and the lean meat and fat content determined at the end of the study.

Results from the study show that ST810 at a concentration of 1part per million (ppm) in the chicken feed is the no-effect dose. In some attributes however, such as increase in leg muscle weight, there were still significant increases (+7%), which demonstrates the high potency of ST810. Responses were significantly improved at 2 ppm, but to varying degrees with different parameters.

The most significant results from this study were the confirmation of the beneficial effects of ST810 at a low dose of 5 ppm. ST810 produced a reduction in feed consumption of up to 5.5% and a massive reduction in body fat of 28.6% in males and 23.5% in females.

Feed represents one of the major cost inputs for poultry producers.

Statistical analysis will be on-going for several months and the results of residue levels in the tissue samples will be processed and reported when they become available.

New ISO Food Safety Auditor Training Course in St. Louis, MO, Oct. 10-21, 2005

 The First IRCA Certified Lead Auditor Course offered in the U.S. combines ISO 9001:2000 Quality with HACCP Creating ISO 22000:2005. 

(PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- Bizmanualz, Inc., a management training, consulting and publishing provider based in St. Louis, MO, today announced expanded course offerings in the much anticipated area of ISO 22000:2005: Food Safety Management System (FSMS). Specifically, the courses combine ISO Auditor certification with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) to satisfy the requirements of the latest food safety release of ISO 22000:2005.

Successful completion of the auditor training class certifies quality auditors of food industry companies involved in the safe sourcing, processing and packaging of food and drink products. Industries affected include: Airlines, Hospitals, Hotels, Food Producers, Food Packagers, Warehousing, Agricultural Processors (meat, livestock, cattle, hogs, poultry, fish, and other farm products) and Regulatory Enforcement Agencies.

Bizmanualz offers a 3-day Foundation and Implementation Course, a 3-day Internal Auditor Class and the 5-day Auditor/Lead Auditor. Check the 2005 training schedule at: www.bizmanualz.com.

&quot;Recent global news highlighting unsafe food processing, distribution and preparation are creating an increasing demand for standardized food safety training to ensure a safer food supply” explains Christopher Anderson, Managing Director of Bizmanualz, Inc. “By integrating the two most popular global standards – ISO 9001&amp;HACCP – into a single Food Safety Management System, companies will save both the time and expense involved in complying with two different standards.”

How a Bread Maker Improved the Safety of Its Employees

 How a bread maker improved the safety of its employees by switching to the Ronningen-Petter DCF Self-Cleaning Industrial Filter. 

(PRWEB) August 25, 2005 --

SITUATION

A Canadian bread company was putting a new bagel boiler in its Alberta plant and required a filtering system to clean the recycled boiler water of raisins, sesame seeds, bits of dough, and corn meal. Corn meal can create water quality problems if the temperature is allowed to fall, requiring an expensive and time-consuming water change.

It is critical that the water in a bagel boiler is kept up to temperature, even as it is filtered and recycled.

The company was using duplex bag filters in its bagel boiler process at its Toronto facility. Concerned about employee safety, however, the maintenance supervisor at the company&apos;s Alberta plant wanted a filtering system that required less operator intervention than a bag system.

High water temperatures used in the process can be a serious hazard to an operator changing filter bags, especially if the operator is pressed for time during the shutdown process and opens up the filter housing while it is still pressurized.

SOLUTION

Decision-makers at the Alberta plant wanted a filter they could count on, without the hazards occasionally associated with bag filter maintenance. Working with an RPA Process Technologies sales representative, the plant manager, and maintenance supervisor determined that the Ronningen-Petter DCF self-cleaning filter was the permanent solution to meet their business objectives.

Two Ronningen-Petter DCF-800 self-cleaning filters were installed on the bagel boiler water recycle line at the Alberta facility. DCF filters successfully removed the raisins, sesame seeds, and bits of dough that would adversely affect the final product.

Uninterrupted filtering by DCF also ensured consistently high water temperatures required to maintain bagel boiler water quality. DCF performs a self-cleaning action by mechanically scraping collected debris from the filter screen with a patented disc that moves up and down the screen, parallel to the liquid flow. Collected debris is then automatically purged from the collection chamber at the bottom of the filter. This self-cleaning action is performed without halting production, and provides the highest quality filtering under continuous demand. Because the screen is cleaned continuously, without interrupting production, a consistently high flow rate is maintained.

RESULTS

The Alberta facility has completely eliminated the risk of operator injury due to changing filter bags, because with Ronningen-Petter DCF filters, there are no messy bags to remove and media cleaning is automatic.

The Alberta facility&apos;s supervisors are also impressed with the unsurpassed filtering of its bagel boiler water with the DCF filters. High water temperature is maintained and water quality problems are avoided. In fact, the company is so happy with the performance of the DCF filters at its Alberta plant, the Langley, B.C. facility is also installing DCF filters on its bagel boiler system — instead of previously planned bags.

CONCLUSION

A Canadian bread company went in search of a safer filtering system and found an RPA Process Technologies solution. Ronningen-Petter DCF Self-Cleaning filters provide the company with unsurpassed filtering, automatic cleaning of the filter media, and a safer work environment for its operators.

APPLICATION DETAILS

Filter model: Ronningen-Petter DCF-800

Type of liquid: Bagel Boiler Water

Pressure: 50 PSI (3.45 bar)

Temperature: 206°F (96.7°C)

Flow Rate: 25-35 GPM (5.7-7.9 m3/h)

Adelsheim Vineyard Purveyors of Classic, Robust Pinot Noir, Intense Pinot Gris, Rich Chardonnay&amp;Some Pretty Wacky Whites Reported In Portland Restaurant Forum Magazine

 Adelsheim Vineyard - purveyors of classic, robust Pinot Noir, intense Pinot Gris, rich Chardonnay and some pretty wacky white wines. 

Adelsheim Vineyard (PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- Purveyors of Classic, Robust Pinot Noir, Intense Pinot Gris, Rich Chardonnay&amp;Some Pretty Wacky White Wines by Loran Hickton with David Adelsheim.

In the early 1980&apos;s, I was the Maitre&apos;d / Manager of a small French restaurant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania called &quot;LePommier&quot;. We were recognized for providing outstanding wines to go along with some of the finest foods I have ever had the honor to serve. The owners of LePommier were Chef Christine Dauber and her husband Jim. While Christine had the vision and expertise to execute an authentic and fine French restaurant, Jim served as the capable and thoughtful wine steward.

In addition to Jim&apos;s duties at the restaurant he was also a doctor and professor of pulmonary medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Each evening Jim would arrive and work the popular restaurant and enjoy speaking with patrons about wines and foods. At the end of each evening Christine, Jim and I would sit down to dinner and a bottle of wine. It was an incredible experience for me to work with two people who really loved food and wine and worked their craft as a method of love vs. just a business. Jim would gather various reports, published tasting notes and other related data and open a bottle of wine. He was, and is, the quintessential scientist and professor. We were conducting research each evening and making detailed evaluations and decisions.

During one evening at the restaurant he spoke about the Willamette Valley in Oregon and how it was exceptional and producing very special and different wines. He mentioned that the earth and the climate were truly unique and that we needed to really explore the region for what he was certain would be a great future for additions to our list.

We searched out the winemakers, wineries and vineyards that we thought were producing great wines. We contacted David Adelsheim, David Lett and Dick Ponzi. During their &quot;marketing tour&quot; east in 1984, we hosted all three winemakers and created an Oregon menu to complement the wines. During this adventure we sampled Oregon wines extensively and became great supporters of the wines.

I moved to the Oregon region in 2000 and was very excited to see Adelsheim wines available in many retail locations. That was very different from my experience in Pennsylvania, where availability of many Oregon wines was constrained by the State&apos;s wine monopoly and are thus difficult to obtain. Here I shared great Oregon Pinots and my experience with the famed Oregon wine pioneers many years before with my dinner guests at my home. Many times I was surprised that local folks were not very informed about the amazing value of these local treasures. Maybe having unbelievable wines available at local outlets tended to take some perceived value away from the wines. I also have been a little surprised that many Portland and regional restaurants don&apos;t have larger selections of these gifts of our local farms. There are now over 300 wine brands in Oregon, over 250 brick-and-mortal wineries, and over 14,000 vinifera acres planted. Oregon ranks #2 only behind California in number of wineries. Oregon wine sales for 2004 topped 1.3 million cases. According to the Oregon Wine Board, Oregon&apos;s wine industry has a 1 billion dollar impact on Oregon&apos;s economy each year. ONE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR!

For this article, we were very happy to visit with David Adelsheim twenty years after our first meeting in Pittsburgh. The value of wine in one&apos;s diet must be good because, while we are quite a bit older, David looks the same as twenty years ago. One of the first questions we asked David was why there are not more Oregon wines on Portland restaurant wine lists. David was quick to point out that there are many lists that highlight Oregon wines very well. He mentioned that he could understand why some local restaurateurs would choose to focus on wines that are not as available as a means of providing the unusual (See article on Southpark). &quot;For local restaurant patrons it provides a chance to explore unusual wine regions. The problem with this approach is that visitors from outside the State increasingly expect to see a glorious list of Oregon wines when they visit and are confused by a list in Oregon that has fewer Oregonian wines than that of their favorite restaurant at home. Additionally, I believe that the health of our shared community relies on the partnership of independent restaurateurs and winemakers together promoting the uniqueness of our local products. Simply having one good Oregon Pinot on a list implies that all Oregon Pinots are interchangeable and prevents a guest from exploring the differences of the wines we have in our region. One could have ten different Oregon Pinots on a list in Portland without overlaps in price or style. It would be interesting, I suspect, for our Oregon restaurant partners to hear what we hear from cities around the country. Demand from restaurant customers for Oregon wines is climbing steeply, and restaurants are adding to their placements of Oregon wines, even as other categories shrink. Oregon wines are very, very popular and our sales are strong in places as diverse as Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, New York, New England, Illinois, Colorado and California. Oregon wines have developed a strong and unique brand all of our own and much of the rest of the country has taken a more aggressive position in promoting these wines than some of our most valued local restaurant partners in State.&quot;

David noted that restaurants in San Francisco have gone through several phases in their relationship to the California wine industry. In the 1980&apos;s, at the height of &quot;California cuisine&quot; many San Francisco restaurants had &quot;California only&quot; wine lists. Then in the 1990&apos;s, there was a move to esoteric European wines on lists, much like what we see today in some Oregon restaurants. Now in California, there is a bit more of a synthesis, still often with a focus on esoteric wines, but now those esoteric wines can be from California - or Oregon.

According to David, &quot;In Portland today, there is still a bit of a love-hate relationship between Oregon&apos;s restaurateurs and its vintners. The reality is, however, that Oregon will host nearly 30 million visitors, 7.5 million of them in Portland. My take is that more and more of these visitors will be seeking a broader range of local wine options while here. It&apos;s good economics for both restaurants and wineries to offer that broader array. It is also good for the health of our region. Regarding the restaurant-vintner partnership, I think the ball is in the court of the wine producers. I believe we need to do a better job of communication. I feel we need to provide more educational opportunities to our most valued local restaurant partners. We need to have events in wine country that give the front-line servers, who are responsible for the sales of our products, a real understanding of what it means to be in the middle of wine country.”

The following information and tasting notes were provided by Adelsheim Vineyard -

Adelsheim Vineyard, a leading Oregon wine producer, is known as an innovator in sustainable, cool climate viticulture.

The estate acreage has grown from its original 15 acres to 180 acres. A new, cutting-edge winemaking facility provides all the quality controls demanded by our &apos;hands-off&apos; winemaking, utilizing a two-level, gravity-feed fermentation room for gentle grape handling, and underground barrel caves for slow, cool aging of our Pinot noir and Chardonnay.

After 34 years and many successful vintages, the naive dreams of one of Oregon&apos;s founding wineries are coming true. More importantly, Adelsheim Vineyard has people with the vision, skills and energy to carry us upward in our quest to produce ever more complex Pinot noirs and elegant white wines.

In 1971, David Adelsheim and Ginny Adelsheim stood above an open field and were taken with the beauty of its orange and purple wildflowers.

Five hundred feet below, Oregon&apos;s north Willamette Valley stretched out in a patchwork of orchards, pasture and native trees. The field, rich with clay-loam soil, had a gentle southern exposure and was sheltered by the Chehalem Mountains. The Adelsheims had dreamed of planting a vineyard in the area since returning from a summer in Europe, where they were inspired by the hand-made foods and wines they encountered.

In 1972, the Adelsheims began planting their original 15-acre vineyard at Quarter Mile Lane with Pinot noir, Chardonnay, and Riesling.

Relying on family and friends for assistance, they battled weeds, mildew, birds and deer -- and the widely perceived futility of growing wine grapes in northern Oregon&apos;s cooler climate.

Working in a cramped basement winery with a simple crusher and press, and 20 Burgundy barrels, David Adelsheim made the first 1,300 cases of wine for commercial release in 1978: tiny quantities of Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Riesling from the estate vineyard were produced, along with Semillon and Merlot from purchased grapes. As the Quarter Mile Lane vineyard matured to full yield and grapes were purchased from other growers, annual production doubled every two years.

As Adelsheim Vineyard continued to grow, the need for a new production facility became critical. A 6000 square-foot winery adjacent to the Adelsheim&apos;s home was built in 1982. Barrels, tanks, a bottling line and still more barrels were added until the new winery was also filled to capacity.
Our first vineyard expansion was in 1989, when we leased a 19-acre site across the road from the original estate vineyard at Quarter Mile Lane. Today, Bryan Creek Vineyard is an important source of our Pinot noir, Pinot gris, and Pinot blanc.

We also purchased a 52-acre site at a lower elevation in the Chehalem Valley. Planted with Pinot gris and Burgundian clones of Pinot noir, the Calkins Lane Vineyard is also home to the new Adelsheim Vineyard winery, built in stages between 1993 and 1997.

Co-owners Jack and Lynn Loacker joined Adelsheim Vineyard in 1994, and began planting Ribbon Springs Vineyard in 1995. This exceptional 120-acre site on the Ribbon Ridge spur of the Chehalem Mountains has provided Pinot noir, Pinot gris and Auxerrois grapes to us since 1998.

Today, Oregon has been recognized as one of the New World&apos;s leading wine producing regions. At Adelsheim Vineyard, we continue the experimentation and systematic study that have established our reputation as a leader and innovator in cool climate viticulture. With a dedicated staff, exceptional vineyards and a cutting-edge winery, we continue our quest to produce world-class Pinot noir, Pinot gris, Chardonnay... and range of &quot;wacky whites.&quot;

Oregon Series Wines
While much of our reputation derives from our long-lived Reserve and Single Vineyard Pinot noirs, the Oregon Series Pinot noir also offers delicious red and black fruit, complex structure, and a supple mouthfeel. Our spicy Pinot gris is the focus of our Oregon Series white wines, and we take great pride in our rich Chardonnay.

2003 Oregon Pinot noir
Our signature red wine and best-known label. The wine is produced almost entirely from estate grapes, using &quot;hands-off&quot; winemaking with a view to current drinkability and medium-term cellaring. Flavors of wild cherry, raspberry, and a hint of ginger spice predominate. The wine has medium body, long finish and soft tannins. Available in 750ml and 375ml bottles.

2003 Oregon Pinot gris
Oregon growers introduced this variety to New World viticulture. We seek to preserve the incredible freshness of these grapes by using stainless steel fermentation and aging. Adelsheim&apos;s Pinot gris offers a lovely floral bouquet, spicy winesap apple and Bosc pear fruit, and a rich mouthfeel. Available in 750ml bottles.

2003 Oregon Chardonnay
A blend of estate and purchased grapes, this elegant Chardonnay is fermented and aged in small French oak barrels, and is characterized by its richness and lovely balance. The addition of earlier-ripening Burgundian clones has given racier flavors to this traditionally produced wine. Available in 750ml bottles.

Reserve Wines
Selected each vintage from the finest lots in our cellars, the Adelsheim Vineyard Reserve wines reflect the vintage and character of Yamhill County Pinot noir and Chardonnay: by holding back our best barrels, we are able to choose between different soil types, clones, site climates, fermenter sizes, and barrel characteristics. With these many variables (and a lot of work!), our Reserve wines truly represent a vision of the vintage, showing wonderful intensity, balance, richness, and complexity.

2003 Elizabeth&apos;s Reserve Pinot noir
This 2003 Elizabeth&apos;s Reserve is a barrel selection of the finest lots of Pinot noir in our cellars. This wonderfully rich wine layers abundant raspberry and black cherry fruit, a luscious mouthfeel complemented by balanced oak, and a long, complex finish. The wine&apos;s elegant structure and round, soft tannins will allow it to develop for at least a decade, given proper storage conditions. Available in 750ml bottles.

2003 Caitlin&apos;s Reserve Chardonnay
A new-wave Chardonnay, produced from early-ripening Burgundian clones planted at Stoller Vineyard in the Dundee Hills. This exceptional site yields grapes showing the complex flavors of white Burgundy. The wine layers lemons, citrus and hazelnuts, a rich mouthfeel with beautifully integrated oak, and a long, elegant finish. Available in 750ml bottles.

Single Vineyard Wines
Adelsheim Vineyard was one of Oregon&apos;s earliest producers of single vineyard wines, first releasing the Elizabeth&apos;s Reserve Pinot noir in 1986. Today, these special wines are the exquisite focus of our vineyard and winemaking team&apos;s dedication and enthusiasm, concentrated into your wineglass. Here you will find the ultimate expression of Pinot noir: the flavors of a singular vineyard site-soil, slope, water and the growing region-as modified by the influence of the vintage, with only the most modest tweaking by human hands. In most vintages, we produce four or five such wines, usually from our own estate vineyards. They might include wines from our estates at Quarter Mile Lane, Bryan Creek, Calkins Lane and Ribbon Springs. In the last vintages there has also been a Goldschmidt Vineyard wine. While we endeavor to produce enough of the wines to obtain some distribution in restaurants and specialty stores, the only sure way to obtain our Single Vineyard Pinots is by becoming a member of our Club Noir.

Wacky Whites
The 2004 Wacky Whites were bottled in mid-April. All the dry wines now come with screwcap closures. These wines reflect the fun and creativity involved in producing new varieties. Call them what you will, these wines are definitely exciting and unique, both because of their limited production and, in the case of our Tocai Friulano and Auxerrois, their position as the first of their kind released by an Oregon producer.

2004 Pinot blanc
It is produced in small quantity from a steep slope of our Bryan Creek Vineyard on the Chehalem Mountains. Subtle aromas of melon, lime, and apple with gentle, smooth texture. Perfect with white fish or shellfish-or just chilled, by itself, at the end of a warm day. Available in 750ml bottles.

2004 Tocai Friulano
Though Tocai is in the Sauvignon family, its wines have more seductive fruit and less grassiness. Also, they are dry and not at all like Tokaj from Hungary. We used an extended press cycle to extract more of the lime/kiwi/guava flavors from the skins. Available in 750ml bottles.

2004 Auxerrois
Auxerrois, like Chardonnay, is a medieval cross between the noble Pinot noir grape of Burgandy and an ignoble variety, Gouais blanc. A crisp and refreshing wine with aromas of orange, quince, and honey. This is just our second bottling of the Auxerrois variety. Available in 750ml bottles.

2004 Deglacé
This is a rare dessert wine made from Pinot noir grapes frozen after harvest, then pressed after partial thawing. Lovely apricot pink in color, with elegant strawberry, nectarine, and orange blossom aromas and a luscious mouthfeel. At 17% residual sugar and 11% alcohol, one might suspect it of being &quot;sticky&quot;, but it has enough acid to be in perfect balance. Available in 375ml bottles.

(PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- In this age of advanced technology and mass production, there is a unique quality dairy nestled in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, approximately 50 miles from Portland. Located near Silver Falls State Park, Silver Falls Creamery is a small farm that produces delicious, farmstead artisan goat cheese. Their goat cheese is made in the “European-style,” velvety smooth and with a delicate texture, and uniquely delicious! Goat cheese, also known as chevré (French for goat) is characterized by its stark white color and tangy flavor. Goat cheese devotees swear by its excellent and complex taste.

The Silver Falls Creamy is one of the few in the state making fresh goat cheese. Unlike aged cheese, fresh cheese is ready to eat after ripening a few days or weeks. Also, unlike most cheeses, this is farmstead cheese, meaning that all the cheese is made from goats that are raised and milked on the same farm by the people that make the cheese. This translates into top quality goat cheese. The “farmstead” designation lets consumers know that they are buying from a small creamery where quality control can be assured from start to finish.

What does top quality mean? It is the hygiene of the cheese making process. Quality in goat cheese means providing consistent taste year around. This is achieved by having control over the flavor and texture of the cheese because they have control over the prime ingredient, the milk. The milk controls the quality of the cheese, and Silver Falls Creamery makes their goat cheese from only fresh goat’s milk, not frozen curds as some larger dairy’s do. By carefully controlling what the goats eat and by also controlling the breeding process, and providing a stress free, free grazing environment, the creamery is able to provide fresh goat’s milk throughout the year with no milking down time. Silver Falls Creamery is presently milking 45 goats twice a day, at 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., and producing more than 60 lbs of fresh cheese per day, 7 days per week.

The Silver Falls Creamery came about from a group of friends that combined their various abilities of farming, marketing, and cheese making to make up this unique family. The creamery’s commercial operation is less than a year old, but the “spark” of creation actually began in 1995 when Shawn Hanowell acquired his first two goats. After several years of experimenting with the goats and goat cheese making, the “family” was ready to jump in full force and begin commercial sales.

Shawn Hanowell is the husbandryman and breeder, and he oversees the main operation of the farm and the goats, making the critical decisions on what to feed them and when to breed in order to maintain their award-winning quality. Much of Shawn&apos;s time is spent breeding, feeding, and caring for the goats. They raise three certified and award winning breeds; all are carefully managed and feed to produce quality milk with desired milk components. This produces a cleaner and leaner chevré. If the fat content is not carefully managed the cheese may become overwhelming and pungent.

Carrie McVay is the cheesemaker. Her careful attention to detail has produced the most wonderful tasting goat cheese. The dairy&apos;s fresh fromage blanc cheese is creamy, mild, and most suitable for pastry, cheese cakes and tortes. The chevré is sold in Plain, Chipotle, Garlic-Herb, and Rosemary-Peppercorn. You’ll be delighted when tasting the outstanding chipotle chevré with just the right amount of “kick” - but doesn’t overwhelm. Additionally the fromage blanc is finding its way into recipes of pastry chefs of the region in many deserts, cheese cakes and fruit tarts. Rachel Ray of the Food Network’s $40 per Day show fell in love with Silver Fall’s Chipotle chevré while dining at Morton’s Bistro in Salem in October of 2004 and featured an Oregon fish entree including Silver Falls chevré.

Did you Know?
When compared to cow&apos;s milk products like cream cheese, goat cheese is lower in fat, calories and cholesterol. It also provides more calcium and fewer carbohydrates than cream cheese. Even though goat cheese has fewer calories, it has a full, rich and creamy flavor.

Goat cheeses are easier to digest than cow&apos;s milk cheeses because the fat cells and protein molecules are smaller and thereby more closely resemble human milk. This also allows the product to be more easily digested.

Many people who are lactose intolerant or have other milk-related allergies can eat cheeses made from goat milk.

Using and Storing goat Cheese:
Fresh artisan goat cheeses are not usually aged, so they are fresh and creamy looking with a fairly mild, salty flavor. To store, you need to protect the cheese from air with the original wrappings, plastic wrap, or wax paper. Remove from refrigerator one hour before serving. Discard any cheese that develops an off-odor, strange colors, or more than a touch of mold.

For longer storage, freeze your goat cheese. It will hold for a few weeks with no appreciable change. The cheese can be frozen in small packages (in quantities of one pound or less). As long as the cheese is in good condition and tightly wrapped, its flavor, texture, and moisture content will remain unchanged. Thaw goat cheese slowly. Leave it undisturbed in the refrigerator until thawed. Whatever you do, let the cheese warm to at least to room temperature before serving to maximize the flavor. All goat cheeses are heat sensitive and can becomes grainy and separate when overheated. When using in recipes, heat until just soft.

Local Support:
Silver Falls Creamery has already made a name among cheese connoisseurs in the Portland/Salem area. In Portland, Whole Foods Market and the New Seasons Market carry their goat cheese. They also sell it at local Farmers Markets in Hillsboro and McMinnville.

Goat cheese is being used in the kitchens of some of the most famous restaurant in the U.S., as Americans have enthusiastically embraced the taste of goat cheese in their favorite dishes, including pizza, panni, ravioli, sauces, and appetizers. Fresh goat cheese also pears wonderfully with other local products that are unique and truly a gift of our region including our one of kind pairs, our fabulous hazelnuts and Northwest free-range chicken and wild northwest fish. Of course completed as well by our fantastic Oregon wines and fine local microbrews. Everyday, more and more people discover the delights of goat cheese, thus continuing the demand for it. As we developed this article it provided another example of how fortunate we are to have these gifts readily available. We must support our partners in the fields and the farms to maintain the healthiest environment and business. Support you local partners!

By buying fresh, locally produced goat cheese; you will get great cheese while supporting your local farmers. Local artisan goat cheeses may be more expensive than their mass produced counterparts, but they offer much more in flavor, diverse textures and menu appeal when they are presented as the &quot;featured&quot; ingredient on your menu items.

Managing the Unforeseen Catastrophe Business Continuation As Reported In Portland Restaurant Forum Magazine

 What’s your game plan if your chef is killed in an auto accident? How about if you, the owner are injured and cannot continue to work? After an event such as this your business plan has only two options, success or failure. 

(PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- Managing the Unforeseen Catastrophe--Business Continuation, by David Brink.

What’s your game plan if your chef is killed in an auto accident? How about if you, the owner are injured and cannot continue to work? After an event such as this your business plan has only two options, success or failure.

A good business plan has a contingency plan for most events that may occur. Surprisingly though, many business plans do not take into consideration the unforeseen issues described above. We plan for the fire, product issues and replacing vendors, but how do you replace the people who in many cases have been the creative force surrounding the legacy of your business? It is the most difficult part of the planning process. If you have a corporate structure or several locations, perhaps you may be able to juggle people until you find a replacement. In some cases though, finding replacement people is both time consuming and expensive. The worst case scenario is that something has happened to the owner, and the reality to that is that the doors may close.

To succeed in this particular situation will take tremendous skill, patience and empathy. Remember, in a crisis like this there is much confusion within the organization. So the first thing to do is to have a good organizational plan in place to address the critical workplace issues. Not just for this disaster, but all of the day to day activities as well. The other issue to not overlook is the communication of this information. It needs to be delivered prior to the event. The designated people really need to step up and lead the team with empathy under these very difficult circumstances.

The second part of your planning must take into consideration how much it will cost to get through a situation such as this. Internally, who do we have that could step in, either temporarily or on a permanent basis? Is it possible for a speedy merger to occur? Do we have to look outside the organization to find the right person and if so, how long will it take? These questions need to be answered prior to any crisis, because if they are not addressed then the negative impact could be devastating.

Ok, so now we have an idea of how to examine the situation, provide an organizational plan to allow for a structured transition in the face of a crisis. We have communicated this plan to the management and staff prior to the unforeseen event. We have analyzed the people we have internally that can be replacement candidates as well as examined our outside opportunities and have a draft scenario of how these events should play out. But how can we afford to actually implement changes at the time of a catastrophic event?

To successfully confront this problem we will need a contingency fund of some kind. There are several ways available. It can be in many forms; however it must be readily available. One idea, Key Person Insurance may provide a readily available solution. These policies provide death and disability benefits to the company if a key person is injured or killed. They are relatively inexpensive and are created to serve this purpose specifically. There are also other cash transfer mechanisms which can take the place of insurance. Your Attorney and CPA can work with your Insurance Broker to achieve these results. Your professional team will be critical in both the planning process as well as delivering the results after an unforeseen event.

The key here is long term planning and the effective communication of that plan to everyone concerned. Remember, without a plan, you plan to fail.

Choosing The Right Bank by Jeanne Rolhf of US Bank As Reported In Portland Resaurant Forum

 The bank or credit union you have used for your banking may have been the perfect fit for your personal banking needs but now you need a bank that will fit the needs of your business. How do you know which bank to choose? And how do you go about researching a bank? 

(PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- Choosing The Right Bank By Jeanne Rohlf

The bank or credit union you have used for your banking may have been the perfect fit for your personal banking needs but now you need a bank that will fit the needs of your business. How do you know which bank to choose? And how do you go about researching a bank?

First, make a list of all the needs you think you need met by a bank or financial institution. Remember, if you expect your business to be successful, you’ll need more than a bank where you can make deposits and get change. Project your needs ahead a few years. What kinds of banking support will you need for your restaurant?

provide a checking account where you can deposit your receipts ands and write checks to pay employees, suppliers and others?
provide investment options so your excess cash can be working for you earning interest
provide retirement planning programs for you and your key employees
facilitate merchant activity so your business can accept credit and debit cards and gain access to the funds the same day or as quickly as possible
offer lease programs so your business can lease rather than purchase equipment if that makes good financial sense
arrange a loan
suggest tools and ideas to help you better manage your day to day business and financial affairs.

Now that you’ve listed the ways you might need a bank, the trick is to find one that can serve the needs you’ve identified. What are some of the ways to identify a bank that can serve the needs you have identified as important for your business?

Look at the websites for banks in your area. Do the various banks offer support for the needs you have identified as important for your business?
Talk with others in the restaurant business. Can they recommend a bank or a Relationship Manager who understands the restaurant business?

Choosing a bank that can work with your business as you grow is the basis for an important partnership. Take time to think about the needs of your business and find the right bank to fit those needs. Having the right banking relationship can make all the difference in fostering a successful start for your future.

Through our Metro Banking Division, located in more than 78 branches throughout the Greater Portland Metropolitan area, U.S. Bank is committed to working with business owners to meet the needs of small businesses. By establishing a banking relationship with a bank which has a wide variety of services, your business will have access to the financial services you need to address the banking aspects of your business.

Nearly 20% of Americans Can be Considered “Gourmet” Consumers, New Report Finds

 New report finds nearly 20% of Americans can be considered &quot;Gourmet&quot; consumers. 

New York (PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- Nearly one-fifth of American adults can be considered gourmet consumers, and these “foodies” are fueling a $41.2 billion industry, according to The U.S. Market for Gourmet Foods and Beverages, a new report from market research publisher Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com. Packaged Facts projects that the market for gourmet foods and beverages will top $62 billion by 2009.

Based on data from Simmons Market Research Bureau, the report estimates that 18.3% of adults try to eat gourmet food whenever they can. And that’s getting easier to do. Several factors are making gourmet products more available, appealing and affordable, including greater involvement in gourmet on the part of mainstream food marketers, expanding retail distribution of gourmet products and a growing synergy between the natural and gourmet foods industries.

“More gourmet products are using natural and organic ingredients (and appealing to consumers’ social consciences by offering products that are good for the environment and for the workers who produce them), and more natural foods retailers are carrying upscale, gourmet food and beverage items that meet their quality standards,” said Don Montuori, publisher of Packaged Facts

Convenience, too, continues to be a major force influencing everyday purchases of food and beverages, and gourmet/premium products are no exception to this rule. It is no coincidence that some of the fastest-growing products in this market—including bottled water, RTD beverages, bagged salads, and refrigerated “supermarket sushi”—benefit from the convenience angle in terms of portability, being fully prepared, ease of preparation, and no-mess consumption.

The U.S. Market for Gourmet Food and Beverages covers eight product areas: Beverages, Baked Goods, Pasta and Grains, Fresh Produce, Ready-to-Eat Meals, Condiments and Sauces, Cheese, Candy, and Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts. The report charts historical sales and projections; analyzes marketing and new product trends; and offers an in-depth profile of the gourmet consumer.

Priced at $5,000, this two-volume report can be purchased directly from Packaged Facts by clicking http://www.packagedfacts.com/pub/1087756.html. It is also available at MarketResearch.com.

Imaje Have Met Gerber’s Requirements for a Coding and Marking Solution to Code Onto Products, Boxes and Pallets Managed Via an Imaje AutoCoding Software Solution

 Like many major food and drink manufacturers, accurate product coding is a priority for Gerber. The repercussions from miscoded information onto products, cases and pallets can result in heavy compensation charges from retailers, as well as incurring substantial costs from mass emergency product withdrawals and scrapped unusable products. 

(PRWEB) August 25, 2005 -- Gerber Foods Soft Drinks Ltd (GFSD) is part of the largest juice group in Europe and is one of the largest UK producers of ambient and chilled juice and juice drinks. The company operates in all sectors of the market place from supermarkets to foodservice, producing over 700 million litres of juice per annum for private label and branded customers.

Imaje have successfully managed to meet Gerber’s requirements for a coding and marking solution to code onto products, boxes and pallets managed via an Imaje AutoCoding software solution.

“We needed an overall integrated quick, reliable, accurate coding system that would minimise downtime, operator error and potential quality defects,” explains Graeme Macfarlane, Gerber’s Ambient Operations Manager. “Imaje offered a competitively priced, complete solution; one that could be developed to suit our needs, rather than our Company conforming to a ready-made product.”

Mr Macfarlane has been very satisfied with the Imaje system. &quot;From test phase through installation and production to-date, the reliability of the day-to-day running of the Imaje equipment has exceeded our expectations.&quot;

Like many major food and drink manufacturers, accurate product coding is a priority for Gerber. The repercussions from miscoded information onto products, cases and pallets can result in heavy compensation charges from retailers, as well as incurring substantial costs from mass emergency product withdrawals and scrapped unusable products.

“Initially we had been considering inkjet coders only and had invited four main suppliers to put forward their proposals,” explained Mr Macfarlane. “However, with the introduction of the new “Combi Lines”, it was apparent we also required downstream coding equipment for labelling outer cases and pallets. We, therefore, started to look for a complete system.”

The success of the project was greatly assisted by the ongoing collaboration between Imaje and Gerber from the outset. “Gerber’s clarity in defining their solution objectives assisted the Imaje team to develop a customised proposal utilising the correct coding technology,” commented Carsten Soerensen, Imaje Systems&amp;Applications Sales Manager.

Imaje have a wide range of marking technologies at their disposal which made it possible to explore various options before reaching the final solution. The total solution was designed to meet the specific needs of Gerber and to date over 30 ERP interfacing production lines have been installed with small character inkjet coders, multi-pack outer case coders, flash labellers and pallet labellers, all managed via an Imaje AutoCoding software solution.

The Imaje equipment codes a combination of use-by dates, times, batch numbers, production line numbers, barcodes and product description information onto the juice cartons, cases and pallets.

&quot;The old system had been quite cumbersome with an operator taking anything between 10 and 20 minutes to manually change the code,” said Mr Macfarlane. “The potential was there for operator error, but now that&apos;s removed. The operator scans the bar code, and the data we need is provided accurately, in seconds, via our own IT system.”

The integrated software solution has saved Gerber considerably as each production line is fitted with a terminal that controls all coding and scanning equipment on the line. With the system being fully automated, the possibility of human error from manual entry of product coding is eliminated and ultimately production downtime is reduced.

 e-Scientific now represents WTW&apos;s line of pH Meter and electro chemistry products for the western states. This includes the inoLab, Profiline, and VARIO line of pH Meters and accessories. 

Mission Viejo, CA (PRWEB) August 23, 2005 -- Working to provide scientists with the richest product portfolio possible, e-Scientific Inc. has announced a new relationship with WTW®, (a Nova Analytics Company) to represent the inoLab®, ProfiLine®, and VARIO® family of pH meters and accessories for all of the western US States. &quot;We are thrilled to have WTW pH meters and electro chemistry products as a key offering in our portfolio,&quot; says Pete DeCarlo, founder and President of e-Scientific Inc. Pete adds, &quot;With their breadth of line and breadth of product WTW® meters really offer the best electro chemistry package available and we consider WTW® to be a strategic partner&quot;

Along with weighing and temperature measurements, pH is the most measured parameter in the laboratory. With the inoLab®, ProfiLine® and VARIO® meters WTW® offers a family of laboratory instruments which meet all measurement requirements from routine measurements to research applications.

In the laboratory supply industry, manufacturers of laboratory equipment and instrumentation have found a lot of value in working with smaller more flexible distribution channels such as e-Scientific. Smaller, progressive organizations like e-Scientific are able to sell more aggressively and develop unique relationships with the bench level scientists. The early success of e-Scientific has been driven by flexibility and flexible manufacturers like WTW compliment this strategy.

e-Scientific offers choices for customers. As e-Scientific (http://www.escientific.com) celebrates its second year of business they are rapidly expanding their customer and product base. e-Scientific has rethought the traditional laboratory distribution model to effectively leverage technology while balancing the hands on service and responsive nature inherent in the research markets. &quot;We realize that while technology enhances the buying and selling process relationships and face to face contact are the cornerstone of successful distribution.&quot; says Pete.

BRUGO™ Travel Mug Revolutionizes To-Go Coffee Packaging, Improves Consumer Experience

 Announcing the new travel mug that keeps your coffee at the perfect tempature longer. Allows you to drink piping hot coffee right away without burning your mouth. 

Chicago, Illinois (PRWEB via PR Web Direct) August 22, 2005 -- It&apos;s been more than a few years since lawsuits involving scalding cups of &quot;to-go&quot; coffee made front-page news, but the ongoing problems experienced by those consuming hot beverages away from home have remained fresh on the minds of the innovators at Jolex, Inc.

This month, Jolex unveils the answer to optimal flavor and unsurpassed convenience with the introduction of the BRUGO™ travel mug, an elegant, patented accessory that allows coffee and tea enthusiasts to enjoy every sip of their hot beverage in the &quot;Perfect Temperature Zone,&quot; while eliminating the spills, spatters and burned lips that are a familiar part of the &quot;to-go&quot; coffee experience.

Fresh coffee is brewed at 200 degrees or more, but its vibrant flavors are most distinguishable and pleasing at around 150 to 170 degrees. By using a simple &quot;tip and sip&quot; motion, BRUGOTM owners transfer sip-sized amounts (one fluid ounce) of their hot beverage to the temperature control chamber, where it immediately reaches this &quot;perfect temperature zone.&quot; Only the liquid in the chamber is cooled and only this liquid exits the sip opening. A tight seal keeps the remaining coffee at its hottest and most aromatic. This inventive system eliminates the need for coffee drinkers to blow on their beverage, add ice to it, or wait for it to cool. Instead, they have immediate access to their hot beverage, and they can enjoy it longer at its peak freshness and flavor.

The BRUGO™ lid has three options: LOCK, TIP&amp;COOL, and SIP. The LOCK setting seals the mug completely and is perfect for transporting the beverage without spilling. TIP&amp;COOL gives the consumer the full benefits of the temperature control chamber.

Once the beverage in the mug has cooled to a palatable temperature, users simply turn the dial to SIP and drink the beverage directly.

Spero Pavlopoulos, Jolex&apos; president, anticipates strong demand for the BRUGO™ mug. &quot;I love coffee but I don’t love waiting for it to cool down,&quot; Pavlopoulos says.

&quot;BRUGO™ is a truly unique product that delivers maximum enjoyment of any hot beverage. In addition, it eliminates accidental spills, reduces burns to the mouth, and provides coffee sellers with a powerful way to enhance the customer experience.&quot;

BRUGO™ is an especially attractive option for drivers who know what it&apos;s like to spill coffee on themselves or stain their vehicle&apos;s upholstery. As Americans spend more time commuting to work, their choice for drinking coffee on the go becomes increasingly critical. For those concerned about appearances, BRUGO™ will find its way into discriminating coffee drinkers&apos; accessory wardrobes with its sleek design and array of stylish colors.

BRUGO™ carries a lifetime-limited warranty. Further details about the product can be found at www.brugomug.com.

 Unusual holiday dinners are becoming more popular thanks to the Internet and overnight shipping. 

Harrisburg, PA (PRWEB) August 22, 2005 -- Turkeys and hams are taking a back seat to a new trend -- breaking open a case of crabs at the holiday dinner table. &quot;People are searching for new ways to celebrate old traditions&quot; states Harbour House Crabs owner Curt Engle. &quot;And ripping open a box of fresh crabs, complete with napkins, mallets and crab cakes, is just another fun and creative way to celebrate the season.&quot;


Indeed the trend has seemed to catch on as Engle&apos;s crab company was recently featured in Real Simple magazine, as well as Food&amp;Wine. &quot;We&apos;ve had tremendous response from people discovering Maryland blue crabs as a great meal for special occasions, and the the holidays fit that bill to a tee.&quot; Recently back from Wango Tango in Anaheim, CA, Engle served a number of high profile celebrities who are also getting in on the trend. &quot;Among them we served The Black Eyed Peas, Jennifer Lopez and Kelly Clarkson. So we&apos;ll have to see if our crabs make it on their wish list.&quot;

Another responsive group are former east coasters that grew up enjoying Maryland blue crabs. &quot;With the advent of overnight shipping and improvements in packaging, we can keep home sick folks from the east coast freshly supplied, and that does make for a happy holiday&quot;.

All the sudden attention has not gone unnoticed at the register. &quot;We&apos;ve had a 400 percent increase in sales for two years in a row.&quot; What used to be a Maryland tradition has now become a nationwide phenomenon.&quot; What&apos;s more, last November, a typically slow month for crab sales, turned into one of the biggest sales months of the year. &quot;I think with the advent of the internet, we&apos;re seeing more people gaining access to the types of foods they want, when they want them,&quot; Engle continues. Asked if he could envision the day when crabs shared equal billing with turkey and ham, Engle hesitated. &quot;I&apos;m not sure I want to work as many hours as the man in the red suit that time of year.&quot; But with sales continuing to spike each holiday, Engle may have no choice. His advice? &quot;If you have a grinch on your holiday list, give them a case of crabs.&quot;

Stopping Head Lice Naturally – Scientifically Speaking (Show Me the Data)

 Fourteen natural head lice treatments were surveyed for clinical evidence of efficacy - proof that they work. Despite tremendous interest among parents and school nurses in natural head lice treatments, only two natural products have conducted studies and only one has published science in prestigious journals. 

(PRWEB) August 22, 2005 -- Spurred by the tremendous concern among parents and school nurses over head lice resistance to chemical treatments and their potential toxic effects on children, a spate of natural head lice treatments has hit the market place. Most of them even claim to work better than traditional brands.

But can they prove it?

This writer decided to take a scientific approach and review the scientific studies on humans that were available for each of the most popular natural head lice treatments available in the United States.

The first task was to identify the natural treatments. Using the internet and visiting drug and health food stores led to fourteen natural brands. Most are from small companies with limited retail distribution. However, most claimed to work much better than any of the traditional permethrin based products available at the drugstore. Each had numerous testimonials from satisfied users.

In the end, just two formulas had studies. But only one had numerous studies with published results. Not to say the others don&apos;t work, but there is a definite dearth of clinical evidence.

The top formula, originally developed in Israel by a pediatrician who was frustrated with lice-resistant chemical products, is comprised of three essential oils; Anise, Coconut and Ylang Ylang and is sold under various brand names around the world.

In the USA, it&apos;s known as HairClean 1-2-3 Lice Kit (www.hairclean.com). Of the seven studies completed on this product, three are on humans – 216 of them! The largest of the studies, conducted by the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School on 129 school children, compared the formula&apos;s performance to a combination of permethrin and malathion. The results – Hair Clean was slightly more effective. There is no product in the USA that has both permethrin and malathion because the latter is available only by prescription. But if it was available, it would be the most powerful chemical formula one could buy. (Published: Journal of the Israel Medical Association/10-02)

The two other human studies were conducted through the University Of Miami School Of Medicine, which has a top notch dermatological department. In one study, HairClean was compared the well known brand Nix and the popular home remedy mayonnaise (you put it under a shower cap overnight). The results were notable. Mayonnaise was minimally effective, Nix was 89% effective and HairClean was 98% effective. Another study, on 37 school children, was preformed in a Florida school system where lice were rampant. The results were equally impressive – students who followed the program were 100% lice free.

The program was simple and similar to what other treatments suggest. The lice treatment is applied to dry hair for 15 minutes, and then washed out with a shampoo, followed by a thorough combing with a special nit comb to remove the dead lice and nits (eggs). The process is repeated seven days later. These HairClean studies were reported in Current Problems in Dermatology (May/June 1999)

The additional four HairClean studies were lab studies showing the formula&apos;s lice and egg killing prowess (total annihilation) and its residual effects (how long it was effective if left on hair – 24 hours), and ease of combing HairClean-treated hair for removing dead lice and nits (very easy).

In addition, The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a report on head lice (9/02 - Vol 110, #3) suggested treatment do&apos;s and don&apos;ts, and selected HairClean 1-2-3 Lice Kit as the natural product of choice, stating that it had been shown to be at least as effective as Nix. (See Summaries at:
http://www.quantumhealth.com/news/articles_test.html)

The other evidence based formula, Lice B Gone (www.licebgone.com), conducted two basic use studies several years ago in which school nurses treated about numerous school children. One study showed a 91% success rate; the other showed a 100% success rate. This product is placed on dry hair under a shower cap for 30 - 60 minutes followed by a nit combing and a shampoo.

The brands surveyed included: HairClean 1-2-3 Lice Kit, Nitmix, Licefreee, LiceRx, Lice R Gone, Not Nice to Lice, Head Lice Solutions, Head Lice Cure, Lice Arrest, Lice Doctor, HairFairies, Head Lice Remedy, Fairy Tales Lice Good-Bye and Lice B Gone.

Tip Sheet:
How do you prevent head lice?
Direct head-to-head touching spreads lice. They do not fly or jump, they crawl. Children at play have closer contact than adults, so they&apos;re more likely to get lice, though this does not exempt adults from infestation. Head lice can be spread by sharing the following items:

- Personal items (clothing, combs, headbands, hats, scrunchies and or scarves).
- Towels, linens, pillows, carpeting, and naptime blankets.
- Stuffed animals, dolls and cloth toys.
- Earphones used for personal radios.
- Lockers or hanging clothes together on coat hooks
- School uniforms, costumes, or gym clothing.

How do you find head lice?
Early detection makes complete lice elimination faster and easier. The nits or eggs are white, sesame seed shaped and very tiny. They are usually on the hair shafts close to the scalp. The lice are small, wing-less and sometimes transparent and are sometimes extremely hard to see. Complete nit removal is crucial to eliminating head lice from a child&apos;s head. A magnifying glass is helpful. Use a lice comb to move hair around so you can see more clearly and remove the lice or nits with the comb.

How do you treat head lice and keep your family free of them at home?
If someone in your family has lice, then you should immediately examine other family members and treat everyone at one time, as follows:

- Use a non-toxic head lice product. Follow the directions carefully.
- Remove the left over nits with a fine toothed comb.
- Machine-wash all bedding, clothing and towels. Put in a hot dryer for at least 20 minutes.
- Put all stuffed animals, pillows, dolls, hats, comforters and any other non-washable personal items in a plastic garbage bag and seal for 14 days. After 14 days, open the bag outdoors and shake items vigorously.
- Soak all brushes, combs and hair accessories in rubbing alcohol or scrub in hot soapy water.
- Vacuum carpets and furniture, then remove the vacuum cleaner bag and throw it out.
- Make sure you tell others about the outbreak. Babysitters, grandparents, playmates, etc. will be grateful for the opportunity to check their families early in order to prevent an outbreak.

New Program Creates $50,000 Cash and Rewards for Salem’s Best Little Roadhouse Restaurant As Featured In Portland Restaurant Forum Magazine

 Finding really big rewards in credit card program, credit card rewards are no longer just for consumers. 

(PRWEB) August 22, 2005 -- In the restaurant business sometimes it seems to take everything you have to put out good food and service. Let’s face it; there are few professions that require that you be the master of every detail, of every aspect and the owner of every mistake. So when you think about adding a new technology or program that changes the methods of accounting you might want to pass until you see the technology widely adopted by others in the industry first. Right? Well if you read on you may want to put down that sauté pan and pick up the phone and jump on this program for your restaurant.

Rewards have become common place for consumers, but used in a limited fashion in the business world. A Portland based company called Zevez, is changing that with a combination of software and services so businesses can get something back every time they pay a bill. Zevez delivers software that fits into a customers&apos; accounts payable program. So paying by card looks and feels to the accounting team as if they are paying by check. The software is simple, affordable and built to handle the volume of business payments. Zevez also serves up a Redemption Center to make it easy for their customers to use rewards. By paying business invoices with reward-rich credit cards, carefully researched and integrated by Zevez, small and medium-sized private companies are adding $10,000 to $50,000 in cash or travel related rewards to their bottom line.

We needed an accurate example to use for the restaurant industry and the team at the Best Little Roadhouse was very happy to share their information and the benefits they have achieved. We traveled south to Salem to meet with the owner of The Best Little Roadhouse, Ralph Matt and talk about Zevez and the RewardWorks program and how it applies to the restaurant industry.

First some background on The Best Little Roadhouse. Rewards programs are based on revenues channeled through the program and we needed to understand the operation and the revenues segments to see how the program would translate to other restaurants.

The Roadhouse opened in June of 2003 and seats 170 patron inside and 125 on the covered patio. The hours of operation are 11:00AM to 11:00PM Sunday through Thursday and 11:00AM to 12:00AM Friday and Saturday. Yearly sales are around three million dollars.

The fare at the Best Little Roadhouse is Standard Steakhouse / Roadhouse with lunch business accounting for 30% and 70%% dinner. Annual revenues range from $2.9M to $3.1M. The entertainment or golf element of the operation accounts for 6%. Food 73% and beverage 21%.

Roadhouse owner Ralph Matt and his family were vacationing with friend Colin Giddings Colin Giddings (owner of Gladstone Suzuki). Colin told Ralph of Zevez and how it is being applied to auto dealers around the country and earning millions of reward points. After vacation Ralph contacted Zevez to find out the value of the program for his restaurant. According to Ralph “The folks at Zevez were very professional and very well-informed regarding the processes we use to process invoices and pay our bills. They spent sufficient time with us to really understand our business. Zevez conducted an extensive analysis of our payables and contacted each vendor to communicate the program application and make certain the program would be applicable. It did not take a long time to receive a detailed report that explained the benefits. This was done without our restaurant investing a dollar for the report. Once we reviewed the data it was very easy to make the decision. We then invested around $1,000 to set up the program, load the software and populate our desired information within the RewardsWorks Program. Based on our current business level we will realize over $50,000 dollars in rewards value this year. With the program you have the option to receive cash, or use points for airline tickets and hotel rooms. Our program provides incentives for our team members that work hard to do their very best for our customers. The RewardsWorks Program provides great incentives that much greater in value than we could otherwise afford. Additionally, we use the rewards too attend educational conferences and other business related events.”

With $3,000,000 in sales The Best Little Roadhouse added $50,000 in reward values. The opportunity is real, tangible and large —even restaurants paying some invoices on credit cards will see a big impact. This is tool every restaurant should have in their kitchen.

We also spoke to Jeff Jandera at Izzy’s Franchise Systems who also is putting Zevez and the RewardWorks program to good use. According to Jeff, ”It is a very useful and simple program that is easy to manage. Because we have many locations and we offer franchise support in terms of television advertising we spend a great deal of money on advertising efforts. We have been pleasantly surprised that all of those expenditures have been converted to rewards. Our total rewards program is currently processing 13,000 per month in restaurant related vendors and suppliers and 42,000 per month in advertising related expenditures. While it might be possible to execute rewards without the software and support, the real issue is time, cost and efficiency. Zevez and RewardWorks are doing something we can not do for ourselves.”

Business of Success Radio Show Host Set to Show That Entrepreneurial Spirit is Alive and Well in America

 Following the recent success of the self-made billionaire, Jon Huntsman interview on the Business of Success radio show, host Alan Rothman is set to deliver yet another compelling interview with International Food Products Group (OTC Bulletin Board: IFDG), CEO Richard Damion of Golden Choice Foods. 

(PRWEB) August 21, 2005 -- The interview which was motivated by Huntsman&apos;s statement that true entrepreneurship with humility and integrity are thin on the ground moved Rothman to deliver guests of a similar caliber to reinforce that true entrepreneurship is alive and well in America. The interview will be heard live by over 1.2 million listeners on over 65 syndicated radio stations coast-to-coast and via live streaming at www.businessofsuccess.com on this Sunday&apos;s show, Aug. 21, at 1 p.m. (EST).

Rothman, whose show broadcasts live every Sunday from noon to 2 p.m. (EST), commented, “Over the past seven years I&apos;ve had the opportunity to interview some of the brightest business brains on the planet. The Jon Huntsman interview resonated strongly with our listeners who seem disillusioned with the world of big business where ethics appears to have taken a back seat. I&apos;m excited about interviewing Richard Damion. He has achieved much with his back to basics approach to doing business, without compromising on ethics. It seems these qualities are becoming a rarity in business today, which probably explains why listeners react so positively to these interviews.”

Qualifying why Richard Damion sets a good example for the business leaders of tomorrow, the Business of Success host added, “What makes Richard Damion impressive is that he built the Golden Choice Foods brand with limited resources and is making a big entry into what could be considered one of the most difficult markets to penetrate. The fact that his company will compete on a par with Fortune 500 companies and hasn&apos;t accrued any debt is in itself impressive. But what really impresses me most is Richard&apos;s ability to compete at this level without compromising on principles. This is a great indication that business with ethics is indeed thriving.”

Also appearing on this Sunday&apos;s show is George Veronis, entrepreneur and real estate developer. George will share with Alan the unique investment opportunity that exists in Arkansas and why savvy property investors are buying into the Cherokee Village development. Listeners looking to explore buying that holiday or retirement home, certainly won&apos;t want to miss this interview.

About Business of Success - The Business of Success show is designed to educate and empower entrepreneurs on their way up the success ladder and gives its 1.2 million listeners the opportunity to &apos;Learn from the entrepreneurs&apos; of today so that they can be the entrepreneur of tomorrow.&apos; Hosted by Alan Rothman, the shows success is due to his ability to continuously attract interviews from top Fortune 500 CEOs&apos; and business leaders and interview them in a unique style that is entertaining, intelligent and insightful; giving his listeners a valuable opportunity to learn from the real life experiences of successful people who have triumphed over adversity – sharing the pitfalls and rewards of running a business and achieving success.

Medina Gourmet to Offer a New Line of &apos;Deliciously Healthy&apos; Mediteranean Salads, Spreads, and Dips

 As more and more food lovers discover how delicious and healthy they are, Mediterranean foods have boomed in popularity. And according to Meyer Futersak, marketing director for Medina Gourmet, there will soon be more than a dozen great new reasons to fall in love with Mediteranean food -– or to take the &apos;love affair&apos; to a whole new level. 

(PRWEB) August 20, 2005 -- Medina Gourmet to Offer a New Line of “Deliciously Healthy” Mediteranean Salads, Spreads, and Dips

Close your eyes and imagine an ancient grove of olive trees in a tiny hilltop village . . . or the sun-dazzled waves of the balmy Mediteranean Sea, as you walk along a pebbled, pristine beach that is all your own.

There’s no doubt about it – the Mediteranean region abounds with natural beauty, a rich and colorful history, and great food. Tahina,
hummus, babbaganoush – the words themselves sound as spicy
and exotic as the foods they name.

As more and more food lovers discover how delicious and healthy they are, Mediterranean foods have boomed in popularity. And according
to Meyer Futersak, marketing director for Medina Gourmet, there will soon be more than a dozen great new reasons to fall in love with Mediteranean food – or to take the “love affair” to a whole new level.

That’s because, starting in September, Medina Gourmet will introduce
a gourmet specialty line of savory Mediteranean salads, spreads, and dips. The initial product lineup includes: Artichoke and Parmesan;
Basil and Toasted Walnut Spread; Artichoke with Sun-Dried Tomato
and Garlic; Artichoke and Sun-Dried Tomato Hummus; Olive and Herb Babbganoush; Hummus and Curry; Indian Spiced Tomato and Onion Dip; Romesco (a puree of toasted almonds, green pepper, garlic, and evoo); Harisa Hummus; Moroccan Spiced Lemon Hummus; Saffron Roasted Garlic Tahina; Tzatziki; and Tunision Spiced Grilled Tomato Salad.

Attractively packaged and made with the finest all-natural ingredients,
the Medina Gourmet line will initially be targeted to gourmet shops and upscale supermarkets nationwide, Mr. Futersak said. Medina Gourmet foods contain no sweeteners or preservatives.

The “Mediteranean diet” has recently been acclaimed for its healthy nutritional value. Hummus, for example, contains no saturated fat,
no cholesterol or sugars and is high in protein and fiber. Unlike many foods that are good for you, however, hummus also tastes great. It is
an ideal food for anyone who wants to eat more sensibly, or who is
concerned about calories, carbohydrates, and/or cholesterol. Hummus
is also low in trans fats and rich in fiber, protein, Omega-3, and heart-healthy anti-oxidants.

Medina Gourmet products are very “meal-versatile” too. Use the dips with veggies for the perfect “anytime” snack. Offer any of the savory salads or spreads as a delicious side dish – no preparation or cooking necessary! Or use any of the spreads as a more healthy alternative to
other high-fat, high-calorie spreads. Anyway you use them, Medina
Gourmet truly delivers the robust taste of the Mediteranean region,
hence its tagline: “Mediteranean made right!”

According to Mr. Futersak, “We are 110% excited about the market potential of this premium-quality line. The initial reaction of distributors and retailers has been very encouraging.” Efforts to establish a national distribution network for Medina Gourmet products are now in full swing. Those interested in learning more, obtaining samples , or in placing an initial stocking order should call (718) 781-9549.

Flor de Sal USA Announces Gourmet Merchants International Will be Distributing Necton S.A.’s Hand-harvested Sea Salts in the Southwest U.S.

 Flor de Sal USA announces that their products will now be available to gourmet, specialty and natural food stores via Gourmet Merchants International for the U.S. Southwest. 

Seattle, Wash. (PRWEB) August 19, 2005 -- Flor de Sal USA announces that their products will now be available to gourmet, specialty and natural food stores via Gourmet Merchants International for the U.S. Southwest.

“We&apos;re excited and honored to have our products available through Gourmet Merchants - the Southwest U.S. has a number of gourmet, natural and specialty retailers that Gourmet Merchants can introduce to our line of products. These customers are best served through a local distributor that can support the products at the store level,” said Marco Pinheiro, Managing Partner of Flor de Sal USA.

“We&apos;re always on the lookout for great new products that can meet the needs of our customers,” stated Bob Chavelle, “with the growing interest in artisanal, specialty salts, we believe this will be a great product for our retail customers to meet the wants and needs of their customers.

About Necton&apos;s Products:

After the winter rains have ceased, and the birds have begun their journeys back north, the salt pans (salinas) of the Belamandil, where the Atlantic Ocean meets the European coastline, are ready to be harvested. During the summer months, weather permitting -- an absence of rainfall and a dry wind from the north -- the salinas are worked by local artisans, salt harvesters (marnotos). The marnotos, on a daily basis, skim the delicate crystals forming on the top of the salt pan by hand, with the same wooden implements that have been used for millenia. The resulting brilliantly white sea salt -- Flor de Sal – literally &quot;the flower of salt&quot; – also known as Fleur de Sel - is a light, crumbly, melt-in-the-mouth salt that maintains all the micronutrients naturally found in ocean water and has been described by many as having hints of sweetness and creaminess, without any of the harshness commonly associated with regular table salt.

Necton&apos;s Traditional Sea Salt (Sal Marinho Tradicional), similar to Flor de Sal, is harvested by hand, but only after the salt crystals have settled on the bottom of the salina. Every three weeks, the marnotos, using similar implements and techniques as with Flor de Sal, exercise great care in harvesting Sal Marinho Tradicional. These crystals, along with Flor de Sal, are placed in piles beneath the Algarve sun, where they are naturally dried, and then sent off for packaging, with no additional processing taking place.

Penchant For Pasta, the Results Are In

 New survey reveals whether Americans twirl or cut their pasta. 

Orlando, FL (PRWEB) August 19, 2005 -- There’s a whole lot of twirling going on – with pasta that is. According to a recent survey commissioned by Olive Garden and conducted by Harris Interactive®, 77 percent of U.S. adult pasta eaters, twirl, rather than cut, long noodle pasta, and 58 percent of Americans(1) use their plate, rather than a spoon, to twirl it.


The survey also found that more than 50 percent of respondents are eating pasta at least once a week and most frequently as a family meal (41 percent). From among a selection of 20 pastas, spaghetti is America’s favorite and tomato, or marinara, the preferred sauce(2). First and second runners up included lasagna and fettuccine for pasta preference and Alfredo and Bolognese, came in second and third respectively for favorite sauce.

And, with all this twirling going on, almost two-thirds of Americans (63 percent)(3) say they end up with a little sauce on themselves or their clothing, while enjoying their pasta.

The survey was commissioned as part of Olive Garden’s Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion on the menu from Aug. 29 through Oct. 16. The 11th-annual restaurant tradition features six sauces, including new Mushroom Alfredo and Five Cheese Marinara – all made from fresh ingredients daily – and seven pastas, for 42 possible combinations.

Olive Garden is the leading restaurant in the Italian dining segment with 563 restaurants, 70,000 employees and more than $2 billion in annual sales. Olive Garden is a division of Darden Restaurants Inc. (NYSE:DRI), the world’s largest casual dining company. Visit Olive Garden’s website at www.olivegarden.com.

About the Survey
Harris Interactive® fielded the online survey on behalf of Olive Garden between July 27 and 29, 2005 among a nationwide sample of 2,011 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, of whom 1,978 eat pasta. The data were weighted to be representative of the total U.S. adult population on the basis of region, age within gender, education, household income, race/ethnicity and propensity to be online. Though this online sample is not a probability sample, in theory, with probability samples of this size, Harris Interactive estimates with 95 percent certainty that the overall results have a sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. Sampling error for the results of those who eat pasta is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.

1. U.S. adults 18 and older who eat pasta.
2. Among U.S. adult pasta eaters who eat pasta most frequently with sauce.
3. U.S. adults 18 and older who eat pasta; net of sometimes, often and always.

New Orleans Parade of Cuisine-LA CÔTE BRASSERIE&amp;The Rene Bistrot

 New Orleans will be hosting the Parade of Cuisine, a month long celebration of food and wine. 

(PRWEB) August 19, 2005 -- New Orleans will be hosting the Parade of Cuisine, a month long celebration of food and wine. While New Orleans is already known for its extravagant festivities that come with Mardi Gras, this event formalizes New Orleans as a culinary capitol during the month of August. The word “New Orleans” in most cases is used synonymously with the words fun, food, and excitement. Many restaurants offer wonderful lunch specials at $20.05 or less and dinner menus at $30.05 or less. This city offering is a natural fit for tourists wishing to dine on exquisite food and to see what New Orleans has to offer. Two restaurants to visit in order to make your tour of New Orleans complete are the LA CÔTE BRASSERIE and the Rene Bistrot. Both New Orleans restaurants have a great selection of food and provide you with a dining experience like no other in the French Quarter.

The LA CÔTE BRASSERIE, housed in the Renaissance Arts Hotel, located in a historic 1910 warehouse, provides a unique and artistic choice in the heart of the Arts District of New Orleans. Located on the Lobby level of this New Orleans Luxury Hotel, large picture windows provide stunning views of the neighborhood. This stylish, modern restaurant includes an exposed kitchen, a full service New Orleans seafood raw bar, and was rated 3 Beans by the Times Picayune. In addition to Louisiana style seafood dishes, Executive Chef Subra&apos;s summer menu is enhanced by Asian influence. Signature dishes include: Hibachi Scallops with Chinese mustard sprouts and Tuna Poke, both bringing a new dimension to traditional New Orleans cuisine. The LA CÔTE BRASSERIE currently features the Table d&apos;Hote - Daily 3 course lunch special for $15, and the Chef&apos;s Tasting Menu - 6 course dinner special for $65 and $95 with wine pairing.
http://marriott.com/property/abouthotel/restaurants/msydt?ptnr=emergent

The Rene Bistrot, a classic French Bistrot, housed in the Renaissance Pere Marquette Hotel, gateway to the French Quarter, is a historic 18 story building located just one block from Bourbon Street and 6 blocks to the New Orleans Superdome. French country cuisine goes haute in the hands of Rene Bajeux, a former executive chef of the Windsor Hotels Grille Room. Casually, chic, Rene’s gets it all right and makes it look effortless, from the knowing wine list to the fleet servers. Now offering 3 course daily table d’ Hote Menu $15 for lunch and $28 at dinner. The saddle of rabbit in a mustard crust is delectable, as are the home made pates. The Rene Bistrot has been awarded 4 beans by The Time-Picayune, and the Award of Excellence, by the Wine Spectator.

The Newest Water Sensation--Water With Just A Hint of Flavor--No Sweeteners, Cool Flavors

 Finally a naturally flavored water with no sweeteners, no added sugar, no calories. Great, flavors -- perfect for the water drinker who wants a change. 

(PRWEB) August 17, 2005 -- HINT INC. continues its subtle revolution this week at the summer Fancy Food Show in New York, demonstrating to thousands of attendees that true refreshment includes no sweeteners. Pure healthy hydrating water, lightly infused with 100% natural flavors and absolutely no artificial additives or preservatives. What a treat. Finally, a drink that tastes great and finishes cleanly, not sweetly. 0 calories. 0 sweeteners. A HINT of natural flavor added to premium drinking water. Nothing else. Think fresh fruit sliced and dropped in water – just the right amount of zing. It’s H2O with a HINT.

HINT offers the most discerning individuals, and their children, exactly the flavors they’ve been craving. Current flavors include cucumber, lime, tangerine and apple. Look for pear, strawberry-kiwi, raspberry-lime, pomegranate-tangerine, grape, tropical punch and mixed berry coming later this year.

“Doctors and dieticians agree that water is the best thing we can drink, but how much plain water can you drink before craving more zing?” asks CEO Kara Goldin. “I created HINT simply because I love water with a slice of lemon or cucumber and wanted a convenient way to have that experience on the go. But I developed HINT KIDS because I wanted to teach my kids to crave more than sweetness.

“There is literally an epidemic of obesity in our country, fueled by sugar and other high calorie foods. Sugar substitutes are no answer – they just condition kids to go for the sweet stuff, and who knows what they will do to our children over time? Instead, we need to change the food environment.”

HINT is an energetic, delicious solution to all that sweet stuff. My girlfriends and my four kids, the ultimate focus group, love it. And the twisty spout is perfect for little fingers and mouths. Goodbye sticky sippy cups filled with sugar water juice. Hello HINTKIDS!

Our mission at HINT is to help change the food environment by offering a healthy alternative without sacrificing taste. Our philosophy: drink water, not sugar. HINT quietly launched in late April in New York and the San Francisco bay area in many of the best stores including Gourmet Garage, Woodlands Market, Berkeley Bowl, Cal Mart, Real Foods and Glen Ellen Market. It can also be found in museums such as The Bay Area Discovery Museum, hotels and spas such as the Kenwood Inn, and many upscale cafes and delis. HINT is currently looking for high end distribution relationships in order to take this great tasting drink across the country.

A Revolution in Eating - How the Quest for Food Shaped America

 “Delicious from start to finish.” – Kirkus Reviews “The lucid style and jaunty tone make this accessible to all.” – Publishers Weekly. 

(PRWEB) August 17, 2005 -- What makes American foods American? James E. McWilliams’ insightful new book, A REVOLUTION IN EATING, answers this question by delving into the history of America’s culinary beginning. He takes readers on a spirited and colorful tour of the attitudes, tastes, and techniques that began in colonial America and have shaped who we are and what we eat.

The dinner table is the ideal place to explore not only our past, but also the way we think about food. By tapping into our culinary history, A REVOLUTION IN EATING both introduces us to and reinforces our understanding of America’s “culinary declaration of independence.”

From the kitchen tables of Puritan families, to Iroquois longhouses, to slave kitchens, McWilliams portrays the grand variety and inventiveness that characterized colonial cuisine. As the colonies grew, so did the American palate. Interactions among European settlers, Native Americans, and African slaves created new dishes and attitudes about food. For example, once thought by colonists to be “fit for swine,” Indian corn became a fixture in the colonial diet, and domestically brewed beer came to symbolize solidarity and loyalty to the patriotic cause of the Revolution. This new national beverage marked a clear departure from the adherence to all things British, and spurred unprecedented trade among the colonies, integrating colonial habits and tastes.

The food that comes to us today, despite its transformation into pre-packaged meats and waxed vegetables, continues to embody the spirit of the settlers and Native Americans who lived off the land and produced the food they consumed. Americans are eager to get back to the literal roots of their culinary heritage, recognizing and celebrating the simplicity, frugality, and frontier ruggedness that define who we are. The soul of American cuisine transcends time, connecting us with our past, grounding us in our present, and giving us an essential link to our future.

About the Author
James E. McWilliams is an assistant professor of history at Texas State University in San Marcos. His articles on food history have appeared in numerous newspapers such as The Christian Science Monitor and the Texas Observer. He is a past winner of the Whitehill Prize in Colonial History, awarded annually by the New England Quarterly, in which he is often published.

Diet Fallacy #8: “Low-Carb Products Will Help You Lose Weight”

 “We&apos;ve never been fatter, never so unhealthy--we are living in the Dietary Dark Ages” says iconoclastic diet guru, Ori Hofmekler, author of bestselling The Warrior Diet http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html. And a lot of the problem lies with the mistaken belief that low-carb products are the answer to fat loss. 

Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) August 16, 2005 -

“We&apos;ve never been fatter, never so unhealthy-we are living in the Dietary Dark Ages” says iconoclastic diet guru, Ori Hofmekler, author of bestselling The Warrior Diet http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html.

According to Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler, we&apos;re living in an era which may go down in history as the Dietary Dark Ages.

Even though more people today are on a diet than ever before, the numbers of the overweight, of the clinically obese, of the diabetic and of those suffering from cardiovascular disease, are at an all time high.

Ironically, the darkest days in human diet history have seen the greatest-ever explosion of “health” products-in particular the all-pervasive low-carb offerings.

Low-carb products appeal to low-carb believers who desperately try to minimize carb consumption, assuming that carbs are the culprit for fat gain. Yet, in spite of the widely advertised low-carb diet and the massive consumption of low-carb products, most low-carb dieters fail to maintain a lean body.

Statistically, in the long run a low-carb dieter will most likely suffer from a fat gain rebound, gaining more weight then they initially lost. There are two major reasons for the failure of low-carb products to ensure longterm fat loss.

One: Low-carb diets adversely affect the human capacity to generate energy. build tissue and maintain optimum health (See diet fallacy # 5).

Two: Low-carb products are often made with low-grade carb substitutes, chemical additives, artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohol and often hydrogenated oil.

Low-carb products, in particular protein bars, typically have a funky aftertaste-not to mention severe adverse side effects such as indigestion, bloating and nausea.

Due to their often-inferior nutritional composition and high chemical content, low-carb products may increase the overall metabolic stress on the liver. That may lead to the accumulation of metabolites such as coenzyme A and acetate as well as estrogen chemicals in the liver, which causes insulin resistance and accumulation of stubborn fat and abdominal fat, respectively.

Furthermore, for many overweight people who suffer from Dismetabolic-Syndrome, following a rigid low-carb/high fat diet may be the worst thing they can do.

Researchers at Wallenberg lab, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden recently published recently an assay stating that individuals who suffer from Dismetabolic-Syndrome generally have the typical symptoms such as obesity / abdominal obesity as well as dislipidemia - impaired fat metabolism with a high level of serum lipids.

For that matter, any application of uncontrolled high fat/low-carb diet in these cases may unfortunately accelerate the damage by increasing the levels of serum lipids, which makes patients more insulin resistant and prone to gain more fat, in particular abdominal fat.

In conclusion:

Don&apos;t attempt to fool your body, stay away from products loaded with chemicals or cheap carb substitutes. If you suffer from abdominal obesity or dislipideimia, high fat/low-carb products could be your worst choice.

(PRWEB) August 15, 2005 -- The Three Angels Gourmet Co. is among a select group of Missouri-based food companies whose owners are happy to think &quot;inside&quot; the box for a change.

The Taste the Best of Missouri gift box is an AgriMissouri affiliated program that began in 2003.

&quot;We’re very pleased that our Heavenly Jam Bar Mix was chosen for this year’s gift box,&quot; says AgriMissouri member and Three Angels Gourmet Co. owner, Suzanne Lieurance, &quot;because we think it is one of the best Missouri-made food products on the market today and we want everyone to know about it. And while I like to be innovative and think outside the box most of the time, this is one instance when thinking &apos;inside&apos; the box, so to speak, is very exciting.&quot;

Taste the Best of Missouri gift boxes will be available in two sizes later this month, priced at $35.00 and $50.00 and can be ordered at www.tastethebestofmissouri.com or by calling 1-800-241-0070. The attractive boxes are black with gold lettering and are shaped like the state of Missouri.

Peppermaster&apos;s Hot Pepper Creations to be One of the Newest Culinary Art Sensations Presented at the Festival des Arts de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield 2005.

 Greg Brooks, renowned Peppermaster and president of Brooks Pepperfire Foods, dons his chefs hat and fires up the grill to show off his culinary creations amidst the festival atmosphere of the fourth annual Festival des arts de Valleyfield this coming August 13 and 14 at Park Delpha-Sauvé. 

(PRWEB) August 13, 2005 -- Since its humble beginnings in the summer of 2002, this arts festival has become the cultural happening of the summer. Marrying the divine skills of some 60 Quebec artisans and Quebec agrifood producers is the recipe for success for this to be the festival of festivals.

Growing more and more elaborate each year, this years&apos; festival will be held between the rotunda and the community center in the serene setting of this beautiful park in the heart of Quebec&apos;s vibrant Suroit region.

Festival-goers can feast their eyes and their tongues on the works of both professional and culinary artists, chosen by the organisation committee, the majority of whom are local to the Vaudreuil-Soulanges area and 15 of whom are new to the festival in 2005.

The municipality of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield is offering an award of $2000 for the winning artist and will hold a drawing for three lucky attendees, $300, $400 and $1000,respectively.

A team from the Musée des Deux-Rives will be on hand to present the travelling exhibition Histoire d&apos;eau. There will be a special, not-to-be-missed, exhibition of 25 works of painter Yvon Duranleau in the chalet at the park. Shows by musical group Amana and L&apos;Harmonie de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, entertainers, dance demonstrations and an exhibition of Tai Chi are also planned.

The gastronomic artists on hand include some 15 agrifood stars of the Suroît region. Attendees can partake in samples and snacks of the art of all of our area&apos;s producers; test their limits on a grilled chicken sandwich replete with hot peppers by the Suroît&apos;s own, Peppermaster, Greg Brooks!

The Festival des Arts is put on through a monetary grant from the Caisse Desjardins Notre-Dame de Bellerive, which comes from the Caisse&apos;s Fonds d&apos;aide au développement du milieu. Other sponsors include CEZinc, Alcan, the Municipality of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and the Deputy of the Provincial Assembly, the honourable Mr. Serge Deslières.

Nutritional Information on Alcoholic Beverages in Doubt?

 &quot;The current Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) petition drive shows a deep division between the wants of consumers and the economics of the drink industry,&quot; says the Low-Carb Bartender. 

Chicago, IL (PRWEB) August 12, 2005 -- Bob Skilnik, author of The Low-Carb Bartender: Carb Counts for Beers, Wine, Mixed Drinks and More (ISBN:1-59337-253-1, Adams Media, $9.95), thinks consumers are in for a long wait before they can benefit from nutritional information labeling on alcoholic beverages. His drink reference book lists the carbohydrate counts of over 1,000 worldwide beers, 400 wines, and 200 low-carb mixed drinks.

&quot;The smaller-sized beer and wine makers are especially fighting this rare opportunity to give consumers the same kind of information that they customarily find on packaged food labels,&quot; notes Skilnik. &quot;They&apos;re arguing that any such regulation would be cost-prohibitive. But if the smallest food manufacturers can accept the costs of nutritional listings on their products, why not the drink industry? As a consumer, I&apos;m much more concerned with nutritional information on my favorite beers and wines, than what kind of select hops were used in a brew or whether or not a vintage was aged for 6 months in French oak. The 9,600 comments that the TTB has received from consumers so far shows that this is something the public wants.&quot;

Although the interest in carb-counting diets has waned from its peak in 2004, recent estimates still place the amount of low-carb dieters at more than 2 million. Even more consumers admit that although not on a weight-reduction program, they still like to keep track of their carbohydrate intake as part of an active lifestyle. The more than 18 million Americans who suffer from diabetes could also benefit from the nutritional labeling of beers, wines, and spirited products. Currently, Skilnik&apos;s book is the only guide for those who would like to enjoy a drink or two but want to---or need to---keep track of the carbohydrate counts of these products.

Consumers have until September 26, 2005 to add their comments to the TTB&apos;s Notice No. 41, Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits and Malt Beverages; Request for Public Comment by going to http://www.ttb.gov/alcohol/rules/response_noticeno41.htm

 The Siebel Institute of Technology, America&apos;s oldest brewing school, presents &quot;The U.S. Brewing Industry Considered,&quot; a technical symposium analyzing the past, present, and probable future of the brewing industry. On October 8th, 2005, four leading brewing industry analysts will present data and relevant conclusions that will give attendees new insights into the competitive domestic and international brewing business. 

(PRWEB) August 12, 2005 -- This fall the Siebel Institute of Technology, America’s oldest brewing school, will host a presentation that may change the way you look at the brewing industry.

On Saturday October 8th, 2005, we are pleased to bring back our Technical Symposium series with a panel presentation titled “The U.S. Brewing Industry Considered.” In this four hour presentation, four esteemed presenters will discuss the past, present, and probable future of the American brewing industry.

First up, Victor J. Tremblay, Professor of Economics at Oregon State University, and Carol Horton Tremblay, Associate Professor of Economics at Oregon State University, authors of the excellent new book “The US Brewing Industry - Data and Economic Analysis”, will draw from over 50 years of their compiled data to discuss the evolution of the leading large-scale brewers and the emergence of both specialty brewers and imports, and analyze the factors involved in the success or failure of some of the industry’s most recognizable companies. You can read about this amazing book on the MIT Press web site at http://mitpress.mit.edu/0262201518 .

Following the Tremblay’s presentation, Lester Jones, Director of Statistical and Information Services for the Beer Institute, will extrapolate on the forensic data and conclusions presented by the Tremblays to bring us up to date on the highly fluid dynamics of the large brewing market. Mr. Jones will detail the expected challenges for the brewing community both domestically and globally, and suggest scenarios for the years to come. Then Ray Daniels, Director of the Brewers Association Craft Beer Marketing Program, will take our audience through some of the pivotal moments in the “craft brewing revolution” and present ideas about how individual initiative and cooperative efforts by the members of America’s craft community can contribute to this sector’s continued expansion.

The final session of the morning will be a spirited question&amp;answer session between participants and audience members, allowing attendees to pose questions to this panel of brewing industry business experts. Breweries of any size and from any point in the globe are sure to leave this presentation with the tools they need to better compete in this rapidly-changing industry.

You can get complete details on the Chicago-based Siebel Institute Technical Symposium by visiting the Siebel Institute web site at www.siebelinstitute.com, where you can also read about the 4th Annual Suppliers Day, our brewing industry trade show held immediately following the Technical Symposium.

Frank’s musical talents were also highlighted at the game as he sang the national anthem, a performance he will be repeating at the Eastern Conference Semi-finals.

The CD was recorded as a dedication to Frank’s longtime friend Paula Boxser and all women like her who are survivors of breast cancer.

“Paula’s courage during her four year battle with breast cancer is inspiring. I wanted to dedicate this song to all women who are courageously facing one of the toughest fights of their lives,” said D&apos;Angelo.

Vermont Shortbread Company Wins Marketing Makeover

 Small business owner and entrepreneur Ann Zuccardy is transforming her Vermont-based business, Vermont Shortbread Company, after winning a &apos;marketing makeover&apos; in a national contest run by nationally acclaimed author and coach, Suzanne Falter-Barns. Zuccardy is &apos;paying it forward&apos; by sharing what she learns during the makeover with other entrepreneurs and small businesses through postings on her blog. 

(PRWEB) August 11, 2005 -- Ann Zuccardy may soon say good-bye to running her small business, Vermont Shortbread Company, in a small way. As the winner of a national contest, the Vermont resident will receive a complete &apos;marketing makeover&apos; - the advice and assistance of a team of renowned marketing experts who will personally help Zuccardy grow her business. The prize is valued at over $4,500.

Zuccardy established Vermont Shortbread Company nine years ago to earn extra money while raising her toddler daughter. After a divorce in 1998 forced Zuccardy to return to her career as a technical writer, the shortbread company took a backseat to her career. But Zuccardy says she never lost her passion for the little company that grew to have a small, loyal following locally and nationally.

She says, &quot;The marketing makeover couldn&apos;t have come at a better time. For years, juggling full-time work and single parenting left me little time or money to develop my shortbread business. Now I have an amazing opportunity to expand my company on a national level.&quot;

The contest was run by nationally acclaimed author and coach Suzanne Falter-Barns through her website, the &apos;Self Help Salon,&apos; which is also referred to as &apos;Get Known Now.&apos; Falter-Barns says, &quot;I chose Ann as a finalist because her site needed a huge amount of work, her intentions were great and her company was clearly something needed by the marketplace. The product has heart, and is bound to be successful with better marketing.&quot;

Falter-Barns adds that after the contest, she was delighted to learn about Zuccardy&apos;s background. &quot;Little did I know that Ann also worked a full-time job and ran this company from her kitchen,&quot; says Falter-Barns. &quot;This is a great inspirational story about living your dreams, which is the focus of my own work.&quot;

Some of the prizes Zuccardy won include: professional coaching from nationally renowned branding, marketing and publicity experts; a web site renovation; virtual assistance support; small business coaching and consulting; custom-designed graphics; article submission and distribution; and a host of resources including marketing books, ebooks, CDs and cassettes, and a blogging seminar.

In fact, Zuccardy has already started a blog to track her progress. She says, &quot;This is a great way for me to share in the joys of building my business, and to exchange marketing wisdom, resources and insights with other small business owners who wish to overhaul their own marketing plans.&quot;

SNC Destinations Launches Web-Based Training for Hospitality and Tourism Industry

 To complement its program of cross-cultural workshops in North America and the Caribbean, SNC Destinations, Inc., a tourism marketing and training company, today announced the launch of its web-based training for the hospitality and tourism industry. 

Sunrise, FL (PRWEB) August 11, 2005 -- To complement its program of cross-cultural workshops in North America and the Caribbean, SNC Destinations, Inc., a tourism marketing and training company, today announced the launch of its web-based training for the hospitality and tourism industry.

Developed specifically for online delivery, the interactive 75-minute sessions focus on interaction with people of other cultures; understanding cultural differences, recognizing social nuances through these interactions, and meeting the cultural needs of foreign guests.

&quot;We are excited to provide such interactive training in this web-based format, as so much of what we instruct concerns interaction and body language,&quot; states Simone Champagnie, Director of Business Development, of the Company&apos;s decision to implement the latest online training technology. &quot;Our initial concern was that the online environment might be too static, not providing us with the vividness found in face-to-face contact. We also knew that we have a strong onsite program, and that there had to be a way to deliver a condensed online version, highlighting the key points of intercultural communication for those in the hospitality and tourism industry.&quot;

The training delivery method allows participants access to live audio and screen interactions, simulating online collaboration and discussion. Each session is instructor-led, incorporating electronic hand raising, breakout groups, and Q&amp;As.;

With interest from as far as Australia, SNC Destinations sees this as an opportunity to expand its training beyond North America and the Caribbean.

&quot;Intercultural communication is the essence of our industry,&quot; Champagnie says. &quot;Providing guests the highest levels of service has as much to do with their comfort and security as does having the right attitude and approach to cross-cultural interactions.&quot;

About SNC Destinations
SNC Destinations is a marketing and training company that provides superior options in destination management services, and seeks to enhance the experience between international guests and local hosts. For more information on SNC Destinations, Inc., visit the website at www.sncdestinations.com or call 954-748-6895.

USDA GIPSA Approves New Aflatoxin Testing Technology

Lawrence, MA (PRWEB) August 10, 2005 -- Charm Sciences ROSA® Aflatoxin (Quantitative) test has received approval from the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA). The test was approved under the new GIPSA directive and is the first quantitative lateral flow test developed to detect the presence of aflatoxins in corn/grain samples.


Charm’s ROSA® (Rapid One Step Assay) aflatoxin test procedure is simple; after sample extraction and a 10 minute incubation, a test strip is inserted into a digital ROSA-M strip reader. Results are displayed and recorded on the reader (with automatic printing and download options).

Multiple samples can be prepared, incubated, and tested at the same time. Four samples can be tested in 15 minutes, eight samples in 19 minutes, and sixteen samples can be tested in less than a half hour.

This lateral flow test method is time/cost efficient and requires minimal user involvement. Like a home pregnancy test, the test strips also provide quick visual results. The digital ROSA-M strip reader interprets these visual results with a high degree of accuracy detecting an aflatoxin presence from 0 to 100 ppb (parts per billion).

Introduced in 1999, Charm’s ROSA lateral flow test strips and readers are the leading diagnostic tests employed by the dairy industry worldwide to screen for antibiotics and aflatoxins. The introduction of the ROSA Aflatoxin (Quantitative) test brings this proven technology to the feed and grain industry.

ABOUT CHARM SCIENCES
Charm Sciences, Inc., a world-renowned manufacturer of food safety monitoring tests and equipment was founded in 1978. The Company continually develops innovative, reliable testing methods. Charm Sciences corporate offices are in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

Creole Potato Salad Propels &quot;New Orleans Bill&quot; to Entrepreneurial Success -- &quot;Kick&apos;n&quot; Potato Salad Sold in Over 1,000 Delis and Supermarkets Across U.S.

 From Bourbon Street barker and Southern University Business graduate to potato salad &quot;King.&quot; 

Oakland, CA (PRWEB) August 9, 2005 -- There is something to be said for &quot;old family recipes.&quot; New Orleans, Louisiana native Bill Washington used one to propel him to entrepreneurial success. Made from a family recipe, New Orleans Bill&apos;s Creole Potato Salad has become the side dish of choice throughout Northern and Southern California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Atlanta, Georgia and the fastest-growing city in the United States, Las Vegas, Nevada. The delectable Creole Potato Salad includes a blend of his special spices and Creole flavors with just the right amount of &quot;kick&quot; to remind you that it is New Orleans cooking!

For the past 15 years, Washington, a former Bourbon Street barker and Southern University Business graduate, has supplied supermarkets and delis with millions of pounds of his award-winning salad. Consumers purchase New Orleans Bill&apos;s delectable salad in delicatessens and at these major supermarket deli counters: Albertsons, Safeway, Mollie Stones, Pak &apos;N Save, and PW supermarkets in Northern California; Albertsons stores in Southern California, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Las Vegas; Jewel and Cub supermarkets in Illinois, Shaw&apos;s in New England and Wayfield Markets in Atlanta – more than 1,000 stores in all.

Washington has always been proud of his New Orleans roots, and the distinctive cuisine that is native to the area. He wanted to create a food product that differed from the typical gumbo, jambalaya and similar foodstuffs. Early on, in his apartment kitchen, Washington prepared his family-recipe salad for cooking demonstrations that took him all over California. Tasters&apos; reactions confirmed what he had always thought: people of all backgrounds and races love &quot;authentic&quot; New Orleans food. To everyone&apos;s amazement, Washington ended his conservative accounting career to make potato salad!

Sold primarily at supermarket deli counters as &quot;Creole Potato Salad&quot; (served by deli clerks), the salad is also sold in pre-packaged containers under the &quot;New Orleans Bill&quot; label in other delicatessens. When introduced in Northern California, Bill&apos;s Creole Potato Salad became the fastest selling food item in Lucky&apos;s supermarket (now Albertson&apos;s) deli history! The salad&apos;s tremendous popularity and ever increasing line-up of retail customers has propelled Bill Washington to entrepreneurial success.

Visit Bill Washington&apos;s web site (www.NewOrleansBillCreoleFood.com) frequently to see if his authentic Creole Potato Salad is sold in your area. New locations and new cities and states are added weekly to Bill&apos;s list of clients. If not carried in your area, ask your local store&apos;s deli department manager &quot;why not?&quot;

Continuing his desire to create and market tasty and innovative New Orleans recipes, Bill will soon introduce Creole Macaroni Salad and his Sweet Potato Cookies - a jazzy blend of yams and his secret spices. Bill &quot;jams with some yams!&quot;

Facilities in Alabama and Oakland, CA enable New Orleans Bill&apos;s Creole Foods to service wholesale customers nationwide. The zesty salad is sold to wholesale distributors under two brand names - &quot;New Orleans Bill&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Mother Dear&apos;s.&quot; To obtain wholesale information, E-mail New Orleans Bill (e-mail protected from spam bots) or visit the wholesale page on his web site.

Celebrated 1996 Vintage in Burgundy Comes Under Fire

 Wine critics worldwide have praised the 1996 vintage in Burgundy for the quality of the wines and for their exceptional cellaring potential. Today the wines are dying. 

(PRWEB) August 8, 2005 -- Right from the start, the 1996 vintage in Burgundy was hailed by wine critics as “remarkable”, “exceptional”, even “legendary.” From Europe to the US, virtually every wine professional, wine writer, and wine critic extolled the qualities of the wines and promised consumers decades of cellaring potential. Prices skyrocketed overnight and today top-end 1996s are still some of Burgundy&apos;s most expensive wines.

Contrary to common opinion, veteran wine consultant and wine critic Thierry Paul Leroux, the man who sparked a controversy in the wine world a few months ago when he publicly announced that the 1990 Bordeaux were dying, expressed his reservations concerning the 1996 vintage in Burgundy. In several articles on EliteWine.com, Leroux warned wine enthusiasts that overall the vintage had been overestimated and that the wines did not have the cellaring potential announced. In 2004, Leroux shocked his readers when he wrote: “To think that the 1996 Burgundies have a great ageing potential is another mistake. I said it several times, including recently, [… many 1996s are now dying. This is even more true for the whites.”

Today, a few other critics and wine professionals are finally admitting that the 1996 vintage in Burgundy has been overrated and that the wines do not have a great cellaring potential. wine writer Mike Steinberger recently observed in a column for Slate that: “The 1996 white Burgundies are dying young” and wondered “Why?” During an interview with Thierry Paul Leroux, Burgundy&apos;s Maison Bouchard Pere&amp;Fils director Bernard Hervet said: &quot;The 1996 vintage did not have the qualities announced. One had to aim very high in the Burgundy hierarchy to find reds with a true cellaring potential in 1996. These wines had to be drunk on the fruit. It is obvious today for many appellations, unfortunately for all those who believed in the ageing potential of this vintage.&quot;

Thierry Paul Leroux&apos;s explanation of why the vintage was overrated rests on the fact that most critics today focus too much on primary aromas, on “the fruit” or “the flesh” and do not take into account the ageing potential of wines. After a few years, when the wines lose their flesh, sometimes only bones remain and this is exactly what is happening to the 1996 Burgundies.

Most wine critics, however, are sticking to their guns, refusing to admit what is now obvious: they were wrong about the quality of the1996 Burgundies and, overall, the vintage does not have the cellaring potential they announced early on.

This has implications for wine enthusiasts and wine collectors alike as the 1996 vintage in Burgundy has been considered to be one of the greatest vintages ever, as reflected by auction prices worldwide. Many collectors are now finding out their wines are well past their peaks.

Consumer Adoption of Organic Products Encouraged by Mainstream Brands, says RetailWire Business Tip

 The desire for organic products is now prevalent enough among mainstream shoppers that conventional grocers need a more broadly appealing organic selection. A RetailWire Business Tip, sponsored by Campbell&apos;s, looks at the route consumers take as they adopt organics and makes recommendations for retailers who want to &quot;go mainstream&quot; with organics in their stores. 

(PRWEB) August 8, 2005 -- According to The Hartman Group, over one-third of grocery store shoppers also shop in natural food stores. However, 78 percent of those would like to find organic products in their conventional grocery store, next to nationally branded items.

As discussed in the RetailWire Business Tip entitled &quot;Bringing Organics into the Mainstream&quot; (http://www.retailwire.com/Campbell_Soup), the new generation of healthy lifestyle retailers, like Whole Foods and Wild Oats, signals a wake up call for conventional grocery operators. It means that there&apos;s a real change occurring in the profile of the natural foods shopper towards more mainstream tastes.

Based on the Food Marketing Institute&apos;s &quot;Shopping for Health&quot; study, it can be assumed that more than half of all shoppers have bought some organic food in the past six months. That means that retailers will miss opportunities to satisfy customers if they continue to isolate organic products in natural foods sections. Other barriers to converting shoppers over to organics are the higher prices, less-than-satisfactory taste and unfamiliar brands that they often find in the natural foods specialty aisle.

As with all other product categories, branding is very influential to consumer purchasing and product loyalty. If given a choice, consumers will opt for the organic version of a product offered by a recognizable, mainstream brand.

As Campbell&apos;s is currently demonstrating with its new organic introductions in the PACE and PREGO brands, retailers can gain organic shoppers&apos; attention by presenting large brand, organic products. PACE, for example, is the salsa/picante share leader with 36 percent national dollar share. Not only is a national brand like PACE more familiar to this new profile of organic shopper, but price and taste, often barriers to adoption with off-beat natural brands, are overcome in a PACE organic version.

With the introduction of mainstream brand versions of quality organic products, retailers&apos; lives could get a lot easier as they look to tap into healthy lifestyle trends. Major brands such as Campbell&apos;s can offer grocers far more product development and marketing support. With the confidence that they are no longer simply appealing to niche consumer groups, we should expect to see much more in-store promotional activity for organic products, as well.

New RFID Center Shows Customers How Solutions Lead to Business Value

DALLAS (PRWEB) August 8, 2005 -- Xterprise Incorporated, the leading solutions provider for the “RFID Enabled Supply Chain,” announces its new, custom-designed headquarters, where the company recently hosted a multiday open house for customers.


More than an expanded headquarters, the facility is home to a 6,000 square foot state-of-the-art RFID Solution Center. The center gives Xterprise an operational warehouse/manufacturing environment to showcase its complete suite of solutions that it has deployed around the globe.

The growing list of Xterprise solutions serve the needs of many markets: retail, supply chain visibility, food and pharmaceutical cold chain (temperature tracking) and asset management.

On display in the Solutions Center is the company’s suite of retail RFID solutions, XARM™ (1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000). The product line addresses a spectrum of customer needs, from the most basic low volume application to the more complex, higher volume in-line production manufacturing application.

Xterprise’s inventory visibility, cold chain and asset management solution, TraX™, addresses an even wider range of supply chains. The company has deployed TraX™ for high tech/electronics, food and pharmaceutical cold chain and reusable asset management in North America, Asia, and Europe.

“Existing and prospective customers are excited to see new RFID business solutions that are an essential part of the roadmap to an ROI,” said Steve Hall, Senior Vice President Sales at Xterprise. “Our team has and is deploying RFID solutions for some of the most respected and largest supply chains in the world. The open house gave us a chance to showcase these solutions. The response was so strong; we will host another customer open house August 31st and September 1st.”

“Our first solution center opened 24 months ago. Then, we focused on RFID basics; tag and reader analysis, product testing and basic RFID training. Now, in response to the market demand to see pragmatic business solutions in an environment that emulates real supply chains, we have designed this facility to show customers the spectrum from tag engineering to generating an ROI,” said Dan Ahearn, Vice President of Solution Services at Xterprise.

One measure of Xterprise’s market leadership is co-sponsorship of the facility from leading RFID technology providers. Sponsors includes: Alien Technology, Zebra Technology, Symbol, Apriso, Red Prairie, TrueDemand, DPI and others.

Xterprise brings together a unique blend of partnerships and pragmatic logistics know how. “There are so many touch points and interfaces between Systems, Machines and Humans in an effective solution; you must manage exceptions as a normal reality. We have invested in designing around these nuances while being able to meet production standards and manage the pre and post shipment RFID data efficiently that enable the business value. We have performed extensive research on the total cost and benefits of RFID infrastructure solutions, including labor, support, infrastructure, scalability and we’ve found infrastructure is only half of the story,” added Ahearn. “The value of RFID comes from having solutions that can use information created across multi-party RFID enabled supply chains to better respond to the market’s real demand for products ... leading to a positive ROI.”

About Xterprise:

Veteran Pizza Driver Reveals Insider Secrets for Making Up To $38 Per Hour

 Former pizza driver&apos;s book reveals secrets for making excellent money as a delivery driver. Based on personal experience and interviews with drivers across the country, his soup-to-nuts manual is chock-full of useful information. Pizzeria owners, too, can learn how their pizzeria rates from the driver&apos;s point of view. 

(PRWEB) August 8, 2005 -- Few people are aware of it, but most people can actually make up to $38 per hour at a simple and fun job – delivering pizza. Although some drivers only make a fraction of that amount, others have found a cash cow right in their own neighborhood. Veteran pizza driver Dave Shelson spills the beans on one of America’s best income opportunities, and one of the least understood, most unappreciated and undervalued jobs.

Men and women, teenagers and retirees, people of all educational and cultural backgrounds, even moonlighters and dropouts from the corporate world, are earning good money delivering pizza. However, not every pizzeria is a goldmine for drivers.

It’s all explained in Shelson’s new book “How To Make Up To $38 Per Hour Delivering Pizza.” The book explains in a straightforward and often humorous manner how to reach the pinnacle of pizza delivery profits, who is doing it, and why. With good paying jobs being outsourced and the cost of living rising, part-time or full time, pizza delivery is emerging as an increasingly attractive solution.

Because it is written by an insider, this book raises and answers the practical and important questions, including: How to find the best pizzerias, how drivers are paid, how to consistently get the biggest tips, how to profit from spin-off activities, which drivers make the most money, how to deal with stingy tippers, and more.

Dave Shelson is a former pizza driver who writes from personal experience. He has also interviewed hundreds of drivers from across the U.S. over the past 25 years to confirm his observations.

“How to Make Up To $38 Per Hour Delivering Pizza” is available from Double Crust Publishing through their website www.doublecrust.com.

Research and Markets: Avocado Consumption in the European Union has Increased Significantly over the Last Ten Years

 (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c21907) has announced the addition of Analysis of the Avocado in the European Union to their offering. 

Dublin (PRWEB) August 8, 2005 -- Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c21907) has announced the addition of Analysis of the Avocado in the European Union to their offering.

Avocado consumption in the European Union has increased significantly over the last ten years. The increase has been more remarkable in France where per capita consumption went from 400 to 1500 grams. In spite of that, the avocado is still considered an exotic product in most European countries, where consumption is less than 250 grams per capita. This means that there is an important market potential for avocado in those countries. This market potential becomes even greater if we consider that the demand for organic avocado has yet to be satisfied.

Within the European Union, Spain is the only country that produces avocado on a commercial scale. However, this production is not sufficient to satisfy the community’s demands. Currently, the European Union is the largest avocado importer of the world. The imports from non-community countries increased 40% over the last ten years.

Real Halva from the Middle East Makes its Way to the U.S.

 Classic Recipe and Sugar Free Halva From Tunisia Begins US Rollout 

Philadelphia, PA (PRWEB) August 6, 2005 -- Following in a long tradition of classic manufacture, Agora International’s Sultan’s Finest Foods Halva makes its way to U.S. specialty grocers’ shelves from Tunisia beginning in August.

Halva enjoys a rich tradition in households with roots to the Mediterranean and Middle East regions. Halva is a natural confection made from a paste of ground sesame seeds. The word halva (or halvah) originates from an Arabic term ‘halwa,’ meaning sweetmeat. Throughout its storied history, halva recipes have included the addition of dried fruit and nuts that take the flavor to new heights.

“American shoppers are demanding more exotic and ethnic foods all the time,” says U.S. sales coordinator and executive food industry veteran Jerome Shupak. “I grew up eating halva, and I agreed to take on Sultan’s Finest because its taste takes me back to when I was a boy.”

Sultan’s Finest Foods Halva comes in a variety of sizes, from a convenient 20g (0.71oz) snack bar, to bulk sizes up to 5K (11lb).

Sultan’s Finest Foods is a division of Agora International of Tunisia, and is headed by Managing Director Rym Bedoui.

“We are very excited to be able to introduce authentic Halva from the Mediterranean region to American consumers,” says Ms Bedoui. “We look forward to introducing additional products that reflect the taste and heritage of our region in the months to come.”

Dealers and distributors with questions about pricing, delivery schedules and special needs, should contact U.S. sales agent Jerome Shupak at (215) 643-9731. Or visit our website at www.agora-intl.com for more information.

Howard B. Schiffer of Vitamin Angel Alliance Honored with Lifetime Achievement Award at the Newport Summit

 Howard B. Schiffer, Founder of Vitamin Angel Alliance, was honored last week with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Nutrition Business Journal’s Newport Summit. 

Santa Barbara, CA (PRWEB) August 4, 2005 -- Howard B. Schiffer, Founder of Vitamin Angel Alliance, was honored last week with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Nutrition Business Journal’s Newport Summit.


The NBJ/Newport Summit is an annual convention of the world’s leading nutritional corporations and manufacturers in the progressive natural, organic, health, and nutrition industries. Schiffer received his Lifetime Achievement award for the impact Vitamin Angels has had in addressing the international malnutrition crisis that has affected hundreds of millions of people, most of them children.

Schiffer, who was known throughout the natural foods marketplace for developing and marketing quality new products reinvented his career as a result of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. As he recounted in his acceptance speech “We received a call from the relief people immediately after the quake. People weren’t eating correctly. They were living in tents and were very stressed out; all of the conditions were ripe for an epidemic or opportunistic infections to spread.” Within 72 hours, Schiffer had arranged for three large pallets of vitamins to be delivered for the relief effort.

“And in that moment,” Schiffer said, “I found my calling. For my entire career I had helped create and market natural products for those who could afford to buy them. Now I had a different purpose. To provide basic nutrition to people in need.”

In 2004, its tenth year, Vitamin Angel Alliance shipped 23.4 million supplements to over 40 countries. In the first five weeks of 2005, Vitamin Angels shipped over 10 million supplements to tsunami survivors in Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia.

Following the award ceremonies, senior natural food executives commented on Schiffer’s contributions and the role Vitamin Angels plays in fighting malnutrition around the world.

“Vitamin Angel Alliance reminds us that providing people with basic nutrition is always the first step in making this world a better place,” said Elliott Balbert, CEO of Natrol. “Their efficiency and integrity in making sure the vitamins reach the poorest of the poor, makes it an honor to work with them. Vitamin Angels is changing lives – ours and the people we get to help.”

“Vitamin Angel Alliance, through the depth of their network and relationships, has made a difference. We’re amazed by the speed, passion and commitment with which they respond to those in need of nutritional supplements,” said Len Monheit, President of NPI Center. “Over the past decade, more than a hundred million vitamins and other supplements have saved the lives and eyesight of millions, providing them with a chance for a productive future.”

“Vitamin Angel Alliance is a leader, providing vitamins to families around the globe who otherwise would be at risk of disease. The Alliance is ready when disaster hits,” said Dot Boyd, President of NNFA West, “Being involved with the &apos;Angels&apos; adds meaning and joy to my work in the natural foods industry.”

Al Powers, President of NOW Foods stated, “Vitamin Angels carries the vision that many of us in the natural product industry share; that we can change the world by what we do.”

Health Concerns and More Mobile Lifestyles Are Driving “On-the-Go” Foods Market

 Research shows a new growing trend of healthy eating among people with busy lifestyles. 

New York, NY (PRWEB) August 4, 2005 -- U.S. consumers are increasingly opting for foods, and especially healthier foods, that require minimal or no preparation. And, as a result, the market for “on-the-go” foods is expanding, both in terms of products and places where one can buy them, according to On-the-Go Eating: Consumer Mindsets, Menu Trends and Product/Packaging Innovations, a new report from market research publisher Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com.

Of course, portable foods are nothing new, as anyone who has eaten at a fast-food restaurant can attest. But what’s changing, according to the report, is the types of venues where consumers can buy on-the-go meals: more traditional “sit-down” restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores, and even vending machines.

One of the strongest signs that consumer attitudes and eating habits are being greatly altered by on-the-go lifestyles is the blurring of the line between meals and snacks. At the same time, Americans are taking a more balanced approach to eating on-the-go, realizing the need to balance convenience with healthy eating, the report notes.

“Americans now spend more than 100 hours a year commuting to work, and these statistics represent growth potential for convenient food products tailored for eating on-the-go,” said Don Montuori, acquisitions editor of Packaged Facts. “In particular, car-friendly food packaging designed to be hand-held, spill-free, and cup-holder compatible is in heavy demand.”

On-the-Go Eating examines the market for convenient and hand-held foods in quick-service and fast-casual restaurants, mass-market food retailers, and alternative channels, such as convenience stores and vending. Key trends covered include the steadily growing demand for gourmet sandwiches in foodservice channels and their untapped market potential in supermarkets, convenience stores, and other mass-market retailers; the impact that litigation and new and proposed legislation is having on food producers and marketers; and the increasing focus on combating obesity and related illnesses in the United States via healthier fare, including among kids.

Priced at $3,000 this report can be purchased directly from Packaged Facts by clicking http://www.packagedfacts.com/pub/1077422.html. It is also available at MarketResearch.com.

WHAT: We are going to have hourly specials starting with $1.00 shots of espresso. Our hours for the grand opening will be from 6am to 10pm. A local dou will be performing to kick off our evening of desset and coffee.(Every Friday and Sat night) Local artist Anna Loring, our first artist showing work will be on hand. Darby Kim, young piantst extraordinaire will be performing. Many of our food vendors will also be on hand to educate the customers on healthy eating and extend a helping hand on the big day. 

(PRWEB) August 4, 2005 -- * ABOUT Satchel’s Market*

At the end of the month of July 2005, the neighborhood of North Park Hill welcomed a new business to the neighborhood – speciality food store Satchel’s Market. “We cannot express how thrilled we are to be in such an amazing neighborhood, both as residents and now business
owners,” says Andrew Casalini, founder of Satchel’s Market. You’ll find Satchel’s market just off the corner of 28th and Fairfax, on 28th Avenue in Denver, Colorado.

Casalini and his family, wife Jen, and children Siena, Sage, and Satchel – the store’s namesake -- will be on hand in the coming months to greet you, Park Hill neighbors, and all of Denver as the specialty food market makes it’s debut. Satchel’s Market will offer specialty foods, as well as a deli and breakfast menu.

What are specialty foods?? – You’ve probably heard that term before – and thought to yourself – oh yes, Whole Foods sells those products. Or you’ve read a fancy quote like this one from California’s Long Beach Press-Telegram, “Specialty grocery stores are an emerging trend in response to consumers&apos; growing taste for high-end, gourmet food, freshly made and pre-packaged, or sold by the pound for fancy picnics.”

Satchel’s market is not about to be a place for picking up “fancy picnics” – the market aims to skip any pretensions and make its customers feel comfortable with personal service. “Sure you can drive to Whole Foods to get the products you want, says Casalini. “But it&apos;s the personal touch and passion for the food that will set us apart. Where else can you go in Park Hill and get a cheese platter with three different cheeses, olives, dried salami, and figs?”

Fare will consist of a selection of fine cheeses, hand made chocolates, artisan breads, gourmet sandwiches, desserts and pastries. “What I am excited about too,” says Jen Casalini, mother and business partner – “is for other families like myself to have the opportunity to walk this beautiful neighborhood, and along the way will be able to pick something up that will be special for the family.”

“I’ve seen Andrew&apos;s expertise first hand,&quot; says local accountant Sarah Kim, &quot;he has a way with food and presentation, the golden touch, really.&quot; Andrew Casalini has over 10 years of experience in the retail food industry.

For coffee lovers, Satchel’s Market will be the only venue right now in Park Hill to get fresh and authentic Italian Illy Coffee. Not only will you be able to enjoy coffee, expresso drinks, and teas at the market, but also the community of Park Hill. “We aim to create new friends at our dessert nights, wine and cheese tastings, and art openings,&quot; says Jen Casalini. “Also, for time pressed customers we can help you either cater your next gathering, or even host your event,” adds Andrew Casalini. Satchel’s Market plans to be of service for the Park Hill neighborhood, and to any customer who walks through the door. “We plan
to take it one year at a time, and we’ll try our best to fill any special request,” says Andrew. But with The National Association for the Specialty Food Trade, reporting sales of gourmet and specialty foods jumping 16 percent between 2002 and 2004, to a nearly $25 billion marketplace, and with the Casalini family’s dedication to the business, it’s likely that Satchel’s market will continue to be a beacon to those seeking quality foods, personal service, and a warm neighborly smile.

Greg Rasheed, Director of the neighborhood association, the Greater Park Hill Community, Inc. also adds:

&quot;I want to support Satchel&apos;s Market because it is a nutritionally sound market. Also, Andrew is a community-minded person dedicated to Park Hill and its continued growth and success. Please come visit and support Satchel&apos;s Market, truly a beacon of light for all of Park Hill, a comfortable, friendly atmosphere.&quot;

Atkins Bankruptcy And The Next Big (Raw) Diet Trend

 Amidst the Atkins bankruptcy goings-on one might wonder where the next big diet trend will come from. Could it be the raw food diet? 

(PRWEB) August 4, 2005 -- Amidst the Atkins bankruptcy goings-on one might wonder where the next big diet trend will come from.


Could it be the raw food diet?

Celebrity proponents include Madonna, Sting, Woody Harrelson, Demi Moore, Natalie Portman, and Uma Thurman.

Websites and books abound including TheGardenDiet.com from authors of the ebook by the same name, RawFood.com from popular speaker David Wolfe, and RawFoods.com boasting the largest community of raw-vegans online including an active bulletin board (community forum).

Folks claim that raw food diets have helped them heal from cancer, fibromyalgia, diabetes, candida, asthma, and other diseases.

The FDA reports that all cooked and processed foods contain toxins such as carcinogens, mutagens, trans fats and free radicals. They also claim that if warnings were issued about cooked foods that &quot;there would be little left for people to eat&quot;.

Raw food enthusiasts want to show that it can be done!

 Kentucky Living readers&apos; votes are in for Kentucky&apos;s &quot;Best Ofs&quot;, and they say Moonlite Bar-B-Q Inn is the best barbecue in Kentucky. 

(PRWEB) August 3, 2005 -- The votes are in from Kentucky Living readers for the best of Kentucky. In March, Kentucky Living asked readers to send in their votes for 18 Kentucky “Best Ofs,” from fishing spot, to antiquing, to barbecue. View the Full list at: http://www.kentuckyliving.com/article.asp?articleid=1492&amp;issueid;=257

What Makes Moonlite the Best in Kentucky Barbecue? - Good Food and Family Tradition

Moonlite Bar-B-Q cooks in the old fashioned Kentucky tradition. Placing meats personally selected for quality in their custom built hickory fired pits and cooking them slow and long, giving the meats that distinctive hickory flavor. When you visit Moonlite, you can smell the difference even before you taste the southern style food that has made them legendary.

Back in February, 1963, Catherine and Pappy Bosley bought the Moonlite for $50,000 from Sonnie and Sadie Bertram and J.C.&amp;Betty Stinson. The Bosley&apos;s used the 5,000 dollar profit from selling their house to make the down payment, moved in with Catherine&apos;s mother and entered the restaurant business with no experience, and little formal education. Then, the Moonlite was a fourteen year old barbecue joint with 30 seats including stools at the counter. He was 48 and she 42, they had five children.

People often ask what led up to buying the Moonlite -

Pappy drove a cab for Veterans Cab Company, and worked at Fleischman’s Distillery. Catherine was a foreman at Glenmore Distillery. It was Pappy’s layoff from Fleischman’s that caused them to reexamine their opportunities. The owners of Moonlite were ready to sell, as they were looking to retire. The restaurant had been around then for 14 years and was well known to the Bosley’s being near Catherine’s mother’s house. •Their five children grew up working next door to the Moonlite at the Big Dipper (a local hamburger joint),

Over the last thirty-five plus years, Moonlite Bar-B-Q has grown into a very special business. In this time of large chains and merged companies Moonlite has grown as a family business. Hugh and Catherine are now passed away, But, four of thier five children and several grandchildren work together to keep things going and growing at a slow, steady rate that now requires a staff of over 120 dedicated members working various facets of the business. These areas now include a 350 seat restaurant, a U.S.D.A. inspected processing plant, an extensive catering department (capable of serving 15 to 15,000 with unparalleled quality and professionalism), a wholesale division serving the region with Barbecue and related products through distributors in a four state area, a busy carryout department, and now publishing a Cookbook (Family Favorites from Moonlite, Recipes That Founded A Kentucky Tradition)available nationally. All this from a thirty seat, roadside restaurant in 1963.

Catherine kept her job at Glenmore until retiring just in case they didn’t make it in the restaurant business…They had no experience but worked hard. Late in her life before she passed away, she finally told her Grandson Patrick Bosley, that, &quot;Moonlite just might make it&quot;, but &quot;you should keep your options open just in case.&quot;

The secret to Moonlite&apos;s Fame has always been two parts: Pappy&apos;s and Catherine&apos;s tradition of treating customers like friends and family, and cooking food like they did at home.

Comfort Gourmet Dessert Wins Edwards® &quot;Indulgence&quot; Contest

 Trendy &quot;Tini&quot; and Key Lime Pops were rated high. 

Atlanta, GA (PRWEB via PR Web Direct) August 3, 2005 -- American Eagle pilot Bonnie Hicks of Lancaster, Ohio, claimed a Grand Prize valued at $5,000 in the &quot;Edwards Invent Your Own Indulgence&quot; national dessert contest. Bonnie delighted judges with her &quot;Georgia Pecan Sweet Potatoes&quot; topped with lightly-toasted marshmallows, cinnamon, and nuts.


&quot;You took an old school tradition and created comfort gourmet,&quot; said Five-star Corporate Executive Chef Fritz Schultz, as he presented Bonnie the Grand Prize medal. &quot;Visually it&apos;s a knock-out. And it has a very unique flavor.&quot;

Bonnie, who flies out of Chicago&apos;s O&apos;Hare Airport, was one of three national finalists who recently competed in the last round of judging before Edwards renowned Chef Fritz and Chef Kit Kiefer, Corporate Executive Chefs for Schwan&apos;s Bakery, Inc., makers of Edwards desserts.

&quot;Her creation was an innovative idea that could be served as a side dish and/or a dessert,&quot; explained Chef Kit. &quot;Ease of preparation was really good. And there&apos;s a nice collision of textures.&quot;

As the Grand Prize winner Bonnie and a guest will be whisked away for a week-long, gourmet get-away at the CuisinArt Culinary Resort and Spa in Anguilla, British West Indies. When she&apos;s not flying, Bonnie enjoys horseback riding, gardening, traveling and cooking.

Other &quot;Indulgence&quot; finalists included: 2nd Place winner Susan Scarborough of Fernandina Beach, Fla., who chose Edwards Key Lime Pie Slices to develop &quot;Temptational Key Lime Macaroon Pops&quot; and 3rd Place winner Elise Lalor of Issaquah, Wash., who incorporated Edwards Key Lime Pie into her recipe for &quot;Key Lime Tiramisu.&quot;

&quot;We&apos;ve received some fabulous recipes and we&apos;re very proud of the creativity that this event has inspired,&quot; said Melinda Pritchett, Edwards Brand Manager. &quot;With creations such as these, it&apos;s clear that with Edwards, you don&apos;t need a lot of time or culinary experience to prepare quick and easy gourmet-quality desserts.&quot;

The Georgia-based Edwards, known for its best-selling Key Lime, Lemon Meringue and Georgia Pecan pies, sponsored the contest. The contest began April 15th and accepted entries of original recipes through July 8, 2005. The finalists arrived in Atlanta for a live, cook-off at the Schwan&apos;s Bakery Innovation Center where each contestant recreated her recipe and presented it for judging. Recipes were judged on ease of preparation, creativity, appearance, and taste.

&quot;Unbelievable ideas,&quot; said Chef Fritz. &quot;There was a separation of less than 10 points between the winners. Each finalist has a unique culinary skill.&quot;

Elise&apos;s Key Lime Tiramisu was an instant hit. Presented in martini glasses and garnished with dark chocolate shavings and raspberries, Elise is the consummate contestant. She wins, often. Married and the co-owner of a travel agency that specializes in Scandinavian and European destinations as well as adoption travel, Elise collects cookbooks as souvenirs.

&quot;The Tiramisu has a very gourmet finish. It can be prepared in advance and can be out on the table when people come over to your home,&quot; said Chef Fritz.

&quot;The martini glass brings it to a white tablecloth look. And it has an interesting combination of flavors,&quot; added Chef Kit. &quot;To take an old-style technique, tiramisu, plus two heavy expressions – coffee flavor with key lime -- was fantastic.&quot;

Chef Fritz, formerly with Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel and Veni Vidi Vici restaurant in Atlanta, praised finalist Susan Scarborough for fashioning a dessert with opportunity. Married and the mother of four, Susan is a decorative artist and portrait artist. &quot;She turned a regional Key Lime pie into a gourmet dessert,&quot; Chef Fritz explained. &quot;And it eats great. These desserts are on trend.&quot; Chef Fritz has won medals in several national and European culinary competitions. He was named &quot;Chef of the Year,&quot; &quot;Culinarian of the Year,&quot; and &quot;Culinary Educator of the Year&quot; by the American Culinary Federation.

Five-star Chef Kit Kiefer, owner and founder of legendary Atlanta restaurant Kiefer&apos;s, has three First Place titles in International Cuisine, the Governor&apos;s Award, as well as numerous culinary medals. Chef Kit serves on the Board of the American Culinary Federation, is a culinary instructor, and is published in several leading magazines such as Southern Living and The National Culinary Review.

Edwards &quot;Indulgence&quot; contestants submitted recipes from across the United States. Entries were narrowed to 12 semi-finalists by an independent home economist and later to the three finalists.

In addition to the Grand Prize getaway, other prizes included: a product coupon entitling all entrants to a free, Edwards dessert and a $250 gift certificate to specialty retailer Williams-Sonoma. The three finalists also won an all-expense paid weekend in Atlanta to compete for the Grand Prize.

Winning desserts will be showcased in the upcoming 2005 Fall Edwards Quick&amp;Easy Dessert booklet. Look for the free booklet at participating grocers and the great creations on the Edwards Web site www.edwardsbaking.com. Edwards desserts are available as whole pies and in two-slice packages. Flavors include the No.1 selling Key Lime, Lemon Meringue, Georgia Pecan, Turtle and OREO®, among others. Edwards gourmet desserts are found in grocer&apos;s freezers nationwide.

Single-cup Brewers Heat Up Luxury Coffee Trend At Work and At Home

 The latest trend in coffee is the emergence of single-cup brewers. These are the newest in coffee pots and pre-measured and packaged coffee that makes coffee one cup at a time. The trend began in the office market and is quickly moving into the home market. That&apos;s because it offers coffee lovers a simple, clean, fast and efficient way to make a perfect single cup of coffee everytime. They no longer have to make a whole pot of coffee if all they want is a single cup. 

Fairfield, NJ, (PRWEB) August 3, 2005 -- For more than a decade, the gourmet coffee trend has been steadily climbing, with specialty coffee houses and upscale chain shops sprouting up everywhere from urban street corners to suburban strip malls, and with grocery stores selling freshly-ground exotic beans from all over the world to a swelling audience of luxury coffee-lovers. The only place it seemed a coffee gourmand couldn&apos;t get a freshly brewed, custom-prepared cup of java was at work, where double burners hosting a hardly-fresh pot of regular and one of decaf usually ruled the day. But that, too, has changed.

“There are so many trends – both on the consumer side and the business side – that have converged to make luxury office coffee such a popular corporate perk,” notes Judson Kleinman, president of Corporate Essentials, a beverage service firm for professional businesses in the NY-metro area. “But by far, the newest and strongest of these trends is the emergence of the Single-Cup Brewers,” he says.

Single-Cup Brewers work using sealed cartridges or cups of prepackaged, pre-measured coffee, which are inserted in the machine prior to brewing. After selecting and inserting a cartridge or cup, then pushing a button, the machine brews a fresh cup of coffee in usually about 30 seconds. Although Single-Cup Brewers have been available to the corporate market for several years, Kleinman notes that the past year saw a surge in the technology behind the machines for both the office and the home, as well as in the widespread availability of a host of premium quality coffees for those machines. “Today, manufacturers like Keurig have partnered with several coffee brands to create more than 100 different flavors and strengths of coffee, along with other hot drinks like tea or cocoa,” Kleinman explains.

What&apos;s more, the industry is hard at work developing the “next generation” of Single-Cup Brewers that use “pods” of specialty coffee pre-wrapped in filter paper in place of the cartridges and cups. “The technology has been used for years in Europe to control quality and costs when making espresso,” Kleinman explains. Corporate Essentials has tested several models of this new equipment, and Kleinman believes the technology is “very close – we&apos;re right around the corner from a market introduction.”

Single-cup brewers at home
Fueling the rise in popularity of Single-Cup Brewers, several manufacturers of these traditionally corporate machines recently began marketing smaller consumer models for the home. “It wasn&apos;t until 2004 that Single-Cup Brewers for the home market really began to take off,” Kleinman explains. “The appeal of making a custom cup of coffee in your own kitchen – whenever you want it, however you want it – with no mess, and within 30 seconds, drives strong consumer sales of these Single-Cup Brewers for the home,” he adds. Once consumers experience the quality and convenience of single-cup, luxury coffee brewing at home, Kleinman says, the contrast with average coffee at the office becomes far more pronounced, and much less acceptable.

Employees and Employers See the “Perks”
According to recent research by Automated Merchandiser, the trade magazine that follows the Office Coffee Service (OCS) industry, there are benefits to be had on both sides of the boardroom table when it comes to offering luxury coffee as an office perk.

For instance, The 2005 National Coffee Drinking Trends survey, which was conducted by the National Coffee Association and referenced in the report, confirmed that more Americans are drinking specialty coffee (52% in 2005, as opposed to 49% in 2004). Of those coffee aficionados, the percent that drink gourmet coffee away from home spiked 11%. The most popular place? Work, of course. The bad news is that NCA reports most of these specialty-coffee-loving office workers had to leave their offices to find their favorite cup of joe. “This represents a huge potential for lost productivity, when more and more employees are heading out the doors and down the street for a good cup of coffee,” Kleinman points out. “Employers are realizing that the key to keeping workers happy and at their desks is to bring the gourmet coffee to them.”

The good news is that, once employers institute in-house specialty coffee services, employees do view it as a significant “perk.” Gerald (Jerry) Kundla, Director Facilities&amp;Office Administration at VNU Inc., a leading international media and information company, notes, “We had several employees who would spend $6, $10, even $12 per day on specialty coffee outside the office. They&apos;ve commented that the single-cup brewing system is almost like getting a raise for them.” Kundla notes, too, that the perks extend to client service as well. “The fact is that more and more people are jumping on the gourmet coffee bandwagon. And being able to offer clients or prospects a variety of high-end coffees from our own pantry right before a meeting just reinforces that overall quality image that we want to project.”

According to the Automated Merchandiser report, published this month on its web site, www.amonline.com higher coffee prices, coupled with a stronger, less downsized corporate economy and an unprecedented increase in the quality and variety of both coffees and equipment, led to a 5% jolt in OCS revenues during the past 12 months, bringing the industry to $3.56 billion in sales.

Judson Kleinman has more than 25 years of experience in positioning and promoting refreshment services to professional services companies including law firms, advertising agencies and accounting companies. Mr. Kleinman has been at the forefront of the recent trend by employers to offer their employee’s gourmet coffees and refreshment services as a perk to improve job satisfaction and productivity. From his position as a reseller, Mr. Kleinman has a broad view of the many makers of coffees, teas, waters and snacks and is on the cutting edge of the beverage brewing technology and trends. As the founder and president at Corporate Essentials, a New Jersey business to business beverages and refreshment services firm, Mr. Kleinman oversees purchasing, sales and servicing. Mr. Kleinman has been quoted on numerous occasions on the subjects of coffees, teas, waters, and on a variety of topics involving running a small business, customer services and sales management.

Ozone Comes of Age: Chemical Free Technology in the UK

 The patented Ozone Cleaning Systems from OzoneSafeFood are now available in the UK and Ireland. Used throughout the world in the food and associated industries, the equipment offers power and versatility, uses cold water and no chemicals and is 3,000 times faster than chlorine at killing bacteria. 

(PRWEB) August 2, 2005 -- Developed over the last 25 years, the innovative systems combine power and versatility, with the fastest bacteria kill rates available of all industrial cleaning methods. They offer a safe cleaning method and are environmentally friendly, using cold water and no chemicals and producing no effluent.

The ozone based equipment can be used in place of traditional chemicals for the controlling of Listeria, E. coli, Salmonella and other micro organisms that are of constant concern to Quality Assurance Managers. Now all primary and secondary processors of beef, pork, poultry, seafood, dairy products, beverages, fruits and vegetables can take advantage of our companies patented vortex technology to topically clean all foods, integrate with ice machines and sanitize equipment. Application also abound across a diverse range of other areas, including water supplies, effluent control, building renovation, odour control, healthcare and catering.

Exclusively distributed in the UK and Ireland by CIProcess Ltd, the UK-based, innovative Cleaning and Process Systems Company, the patented equipment is used for cleaning and disinfecting in the food, water and associated sectors.

Eliminating the need for chlorine, Dave Adams, the technical Director of CIProcess states, “Chlorine has traditionally been the sanitizer of choice in the food processing industry, but experts share a growing concern about the dangerous byproducts such as trihalomethanes or dioxins produced when chlorine reacts with organic matter in the water. These substances are known carcinogens and are regulated in drinking water by the US Environmental Protection Agency.&quot;

Ozone gas is a naturally occurring tri-atomic form of oxygen that is formed as sunlight passes through the atmosphere. It can be generated artificially by passing high voltage electricity through oxygenated air. For over 100 years, ozone has been recognized as a superior methodology in the purification of potable water. However, due to the instability of ozone gas reverting back to oxygen, it has been difficult to harness the natural &apos;killing power&apos; of ozone outside the confines of a water pipe. Our patented Vortex technology entrains ozone into the water until it is fully suspended; the natural process of reverting back to oxygen becomes delayed, allowing the water stream to exit the confines of a pipe with its natural micro organism killing power still in effect.

Because ozone is an unstable, highly reactive form of oxygen, it is 51 % more powerful than chlorine, the oxidizer most commonly used by most food processors, and 3,000 times as fast at killing bacteria and other microbes. Micro organisms also cannot develop a resistance to their ozone enemy, which they can with chemicals.

Ozonesafefood declared: “Ozone is effective as a disinfectant at relatively low concentrations and does not leave toxic by-products similar to those related to chlorination, the company claims. Because it decomposes quickly, ozone does not build up on surfaces the way detergents can if not removed by proper rinsing”.

One of the patented processes uses a system in which ozone is compressed into microscopic bubbles into a water solution. Applied to food products, it can help reduce pathogens and vastly increase the shelf life, with monitored tests giving some products up to 20 day increases.

Operating costs are reduced, by using cold water and no chemicals, and by reducing the steps in the cleaning process to a single step. The systems are available in mobile or static versions and can often be used through your existing pipework etc. Add this to an increased quality product and an extension to the shelf life, return on investment paybacks of fewer than 12 months are often achieved.

Recently launched into the Australian market at FoodPro 2005 in Sydney, Dave Adams further commented: “The show was an outstanding success, with a constant stream of users, government departments and the press, visiting the stand, which included working demonstrations of the patented technologies. Following the success of this show, the equipment will be displayed at FoodTech2005 in Telford in September – with the Australian, American and Chinese engineers on the stand to provide an insight of the equipments use around the world.”

The ozone systems are surprisingly affordable, and can usually pay for themselves in a short period with savings realized in utility and chemical expenses, plus the simplification of waste water treatments. Considering ozone has FDA / USDA approval, an exhaustive list of micro organisms that it is effective against with very limited contact time, organic listing, and significant chemical and utility cost savings, installing a CIProcess Ozone system is a unique opportunity to economically modernize a processing plant.

The products are successfully used in many sectors and new applications are constantly emerging. As part of CIProcess’s commitment to these technologies, our clients are invited to discuss their applications and submit their products and processes for testing in our test workshop or on site.

Ozonesafefood equipment is part of CIProcess’s extensive range of innovative cleaning and processing equipment including CIP/COP systems, laser cleaning, and ice blasting systems, tanks and vessels, electrical and hygienic installations.

Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places? Look No Further than your Morning Cup of Coffee

 Close your eyes and imagine: The aromatic smell of freshly roasted and brewed coffee, your favorite breakfast item, and the morning paper. Ahhh ... what taste, what indulgence, what more could you ask for? That&apos;s the premise behind OwnAnythingCoffee.com -- a newly launched website filled with everything a coffee lover -- or anyone who wants to experience the romance of a freshly roasted and brewed cup of coffee -- could ever want. 

Mira Loma, CA (PRWEB) August 2, 2005 -- Most coffee drinkers don’t realize that the high-priced, lower-quality pre-ground coffee they purchase at their local grocery store is stale before it hits their shopping cart. And those pre-roasted beans you love? Give them an extra week, maybe two, but remember to store them in an air-tight container or their freshness peaks in approximately three days.

So what’s a coffee lover supposed to do? Enter OwnAnythingCoffee.com -- the premiere site for everything coffee. The company specializes in hand-picked green coffee beans from top growers around the world. Green coffee beans are beans picked fresh from the plantation and shipped to you to be roasted, ground, and savored right in your own home.

&quot;It was amazing to me how many people love to drink coffee, but don’t realize they’re buying stale, or close to stale product,&quot; notes Karen Pacella, founder of OwnAnythingCoffee.com. &quot;You wouldn’t buy stale bread – why should you have to buy stale coffee?&quot;

Pacella, a home coffee roaster herself, decided it was time someone offered the consumer not only the know-how, but also the freshest, highest quality selected green beans possible, along with everything necessary to roast, brew and enjoy the freshest cup of coffee possible, in the convenience of their own kitchen.

According to the Specialty Coffee Association of America, the coffee industry is currently an $18 billion industry and one of the fastest growing food industries in the world. It’s estimated there are over 28 million coffee drinkers in the U.S. alone – a market that is growing by 20% per year. Pacella feels an educated consumer will quickly come to appreciate what she has to offer.

&quot;I felt the time was right to launch OwnAnythingCoffee.com,&quot; said Pacella. &quot;There are sites offering green beans and roasters, but I wanted to target coffee connoisseurs as well as the average coffee drinker by offering an array of specialty coffee products at affordable prices. A kind of “one stop coffee shop.&quot;

Pacella may be on to something. It’s estimated there are 12,000 coffee shops in the U.S. with the average specialty coffee drinker consuming 3.1 cups per day. At prices starting at $3.00 for a freshly brewed cup of your favorite espresso drink, it can get quite pricey. Roasting your own beans can save up to 50 percent off the cost of store bought coffee over a very short amount of time.

&quot;There’s nothing like a freshly roasted, freshly ground and brewed cup of coffee,&quot; notes Pacella, almost dreamily. &quot;And it takes very little effort to experience the aroma, the taste, and the sheer enjoyment of creating it yourself.&quot;

OwnAnythingCoffee.com features high quality green coffee beans, top rated home roasting equipment -- complete with instructions on use -- as well as grinders, brewers, espresso machines and tableware. There’s something to fit every taste and budget. It’s the perfect way to indulge your senses, save money, and impress your friends -- it really is romance in a cup.

Headquartered in Mira Loma, California, OwnAnythingCoffee.com distributes and markets fresh green coffee beans and everything necessary for the home roaster. Visit their website at: www.ownanythingcoffee.com.

Importer Brings Extra Virgin Olive Oil Varietals from Israel to US Market

 Company offers consumers a choice of three olive oil varietals, including two rarely seen in the United States. 

Springfield, MA (PRWEB) August 1, 2005 – The Harrington Trace Corporation, a gourmet food import company, recently began shipping Israeli Gold extra virgin olive oil. Available in three distinctive varietals -- Manzanilla, Barnea and Soury – the oils are imported from award-winning producers in Israel.


John McBride, the president of Harrington Trace, explained that the company sought out Israeli olive oil specifically to fill a void in the marketplace. With the growing surge in the popularity of olive oil, products from Italy, Spain and Greece are readily available to American consumers. Israeli oils are still relatively rare in the U.S. In keeping with its market strategy of introducing under-represented gourmet-quality foods and beverages to the American market, McBride said, Harrington Trace selected the three Israeli Gold varietals for introduction in 2005

According to McBride, even identical varieties of olive oil produce a distinctive taste depending on the country of production. “Just like fine wines, olive oils embody the geography and climate of the place where the fruit is grown,” he said. McBride said Harrington Trace wanted to offer consumers the unique flavor characteristics of Israeli oil in unblended varietals, adding that the Barnea and Soury varietals are rarely seen in the United States.

Israeli Gold oils are bottled in 375ml cobalt blue European glass bottles, a unique and distinctive look for the product. “The bottle was chosen in part for its beauty, but primarily because of its ability to protect the oil from the degradation that can occur when oils are subjected to light,” McBride said.

Israeli Gold olive oils are available direct to consumers on the web at http://www.harringtontrace.com. The company also plans to make the oils available at specialty food and gourmet shops nationwide. For additional information, visit http://www.harringtontrace.com. Israeli Gold and Harrington Trace are trademarks of The Harrington Trace Corporation.

Coffee Sold In A Drugstore? Catapult Coffee, A New brew With A &quot;Healthy Kick,&quot; Now Being Tested At Brooks/Eckerds Drugstores

 Catapult Coffee, a new herbally enhanced coffee, views drugstores as a unique and appropriate distribution center for its brew. In a test, 1800 Brooks/Eckerds Drugstores will offer Catapult for sale in the Northeast. 

(PRWEB) August 1, 2005 -- Catapult Coffee, the newest entry in the growing food and beverage trend, is now available at participating Brooks/Eckerds Drugstores (approximately 1800 stores) in the Northeast.

“We think drugstores are a tremendous distribution concept for us,” says Catapult president David Sollars. “Our coffee has added herbs for greater vitality and clarity and that feels like the perfect fit for a drugstore customer. The drug channel also seems to be an early adopter of this new coffee concept since their consumers already buy herbs and vitamins at their locations. Retail can feel the pulse changing of the consumers, and they don’t want to be left out of this next product wave.”

Catapult Coffee is also available at select Stop and Shop supermarkets in the Northeast, as well as nationally online at www.catapultcoffee.com. There are four energizing coffees to choose from, all available in distinctive 12 oz. cans:

• Dragon Roast – the flavor of rich Arabica beans
• Cinnamon Dragon – with a touch of cinnamon
• Vanilla Crane – for vanilla lovers
• Hazelnut Tiger – with a hint of hazelnut

All four coffees contain extracts from the following three herbs, and are listed in FDA regulations for use in food and beverages:

• Yerba Mate – Used throughout South America to make a popular drink known for relieving both mental and physical fatigue.
• Angelica Sinensis (Dong Quai) – One of the most highly respected herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. This high-energy herb helps maintain healthy circulation and blood flow.
• Guarana Seed Powder – The people of the Amazon rain forest use crushed guarana seeds as a beverage to decrease fatigue and increase energy.

“Coffee is more than a drink. It’s become an integral part of how we jump-start our day. For many, coffee is the morning ritual for getting it together,” says Sollars. “A recent survey by the National Coffee Association found that 79% of Americans aged 18 or older will drink coffee at some point during the year. 110 million of us drink it every day.

Growth in Specialty Tea Sales Driving $6.8 Billion Tea Market

 Exotic flavors are the newest rage in ready to drink market. 

New York, NY (PRWEB) August 1, 2005 -- Green, white and even red—if it’s a specialty tea, it’s a hot item among U.S. consumers, who are gravitating toward more “exotic” tea blends and fueling a tea market worth $6.8 billion, according to The U.S. Market for Tea and Ready-to-Drink Tea, a new report from market research publisher Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com.

Packaged Facts projects that the tea market will reach $10 billion by 2010.

Tea in the United States has never had the popularity of coffee, nor do Americans drink as much tea as consumers abroad. Indeed, the lion’s share of U.S. retail tea revenue is generated by sales of ready-to-drink bottled and canned ice teas. However, as Americans become more health conscious and the health properties of green and white teas become more widely publicized, tea has acquired a new cache.

As traditional black tea sales decline, specialty tea sales continue to grow. This is a very competitive arena, with many small companies vying for shelf space and attention. A marketing partnership between Kraft and Tazo Tea, owned by Starbucks, may catapult this brand to leadership in specialty teas.

“Green tea is hot right now—in fact it’s getting dangerously close to becoming a cliché, for a food to contain green tea,” said Don Montuori, publisher of Packaged Facts. “White tea is the newest trend, and it’s said to have even more health advantages than green tea. But, it may not take off with the same trajectory as green tea, since it’s more expensive and the flavor is more subtle.”

The U.S. Market for Tea and Ready-to-Drink Tea covers market share by company and brand, profiles major tea marketers and smaller up-and-comers, delves into the consumer behavior of the tea drinker, and forecasts trends that will affect the tea market over the next five years.

Dublin (PRWEB) July 1, 2005 -- Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c21631) has announced the addition of Understanding the Operator to their offerings.

Recipes have to be rewritten to deal with modifications...&quot;

The handbook covers:

The company is also test-marketing non-grain cakes for special occasions like birthdays and weddings.
