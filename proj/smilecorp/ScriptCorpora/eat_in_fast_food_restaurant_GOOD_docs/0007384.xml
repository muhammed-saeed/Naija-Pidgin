 Fort Mill Chef Opens Fort Mill BBQ Restaurant 

 May 25, 2009 By: Scott Category: Fort Mill News 
 
 Local Fort Mill Chef Herb aka Herb Tesh along with the help of Bob Bowman opened up a new BBQ restaurant last week. It’s called Fort Mill BBQ Company.

If you look at ChefHerb Production’s website, Herb says he is a certified Chef with over 20 years experience as an executive chef for large hotels and restaurants. He has a passion for southern cuisine especially BBQ pork, ribs, brisket, and chicken. Besides catering, Herb enters several area BBQ contests and teaches cooking classes.

Carmen and I went to the Fort Mill BBQ Company’s new restaurant last week and enjoyed the food and hospitality. The restaurant is located in the Stockbridge Commons shopping center where Lowe’s Foods is located at the corner of Highway 160 and Gold Hill Rd. they took the spot that used to be Sonny’s Dutch Mill Restaurant. When we walked in for lunch, the restaurant was busy and Bob greeted us with a warm welcome at the door. The restaurant is full of color and historical pictures of Fort Mill. The most predominate picture was a picture of the old barn that was located at the same corner that now is the shopping center. Bob explained part of the restaurants design concept is to feature Fort Mill.

A banner promoting a logo contest was hanging on a wall showing the logo winner and 2nd place winner. Bob’s wife is the principal of Nations Ford High school and they asked the Nations Ford HS art class to hold a contest to make the best logo for the Fort Mill BBQ Company. Bob also explained as he pointed to a wall that the winners of the all u eat BBQ challenge will be featured on the wall along with kids color drawings done while they eat. The restaurant has a large colorful menu board with many items to choice from.

There was a lot of hands on service for a order as you come in restaurant. I asked Herb’s wife why they decided to open their restaurant in this tough economy. She said their catering business has been doing well and their customers urged them to open a local restaurant.  Besides good cooking, the group did a great job making us and everyone else in the restaurant feel welcome. Herb, Bob, and family, we wish you good luck and we are glad to have you as a great restaurant choice in Fort Mill.

This is good news. I love restaurants and constantly I eat in the restaurants because I work and do not have much time to eat the house. I love all the specialties of the chicken and pork so that I will need to visit this restaurant.
