MONROE -- Police said a Goshen man was trying to order much more than a hamburger at the Zoar Drive-In.

 John Traonetta , 35, was charged with second-degree harassment after he called the popular food stand and demanded some sex with his takeout order, police said.

According to police, on Sept. 9, a teenaged female employee of the stand said she received a call from a man who said in addition of the his food order he wanted to perform a sex act on the young woman.

Police said they managed to trace the call to Traonetta&apos;s cell phone. When they confronted Traonetta, police said he admitted he made the call but agreed to write a letter of apology to the teen.
