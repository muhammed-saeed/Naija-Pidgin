Suggestions and Choices For Eating On The Trail
 Tweet 
 Apr 1, 2007 Jeff Wetherington 
 Even on relatively short day hikes of a few miles or less, these food choices will make your outdoor experience much more enjoyable. 
Spring has arrived and the hiking and backpacking gear is coming out of storage. It&apos;s always a good idea to do some easy day hikes to get back into shape before tackling the longer, more intensive overnight or multi-day hikes. Some don&apos;t bother with food on day hikes, but part of getting your body back in the groove is giving it the fuel it needs to help with the adjustment back into hiking. And, if the unthinkable should happen and you find yourself lost overnight on an out-of-the-way trail, you&apos;ll have at least eaten something during the day, and might even have some food left over to hold you through the night.

Here are some suggestions for eating on the trail.

 Water - This should go without saying, but water is an absolute necessity. The amount that you will need will depend on several factors including temperature, elevation and how strenuous the hike is, among others. Take enough according to the above factors and then throw in a little extra as a buffer.

 Fruit, Fresh or Dried - Fresh fruits, especially apples, peaches, plums, pears or grapes, give you a natural sugar and provide some of the fluid your body needs with their juices. If you&apos;re able to pack them securely in your backpack so they don&apos;t get mashed or bruised, you can take the entire fruit (if weight is not an issue); or you can slice them up ahead of time (eliminating the seeds, cores or pits) and place the pieces in a zip-lock bag. Dried fruits allow you to pack more in a smaller container with less weight, but don&apos;t provide the natural juice that fresh fruits do, so be sure to drink water when eating these items.
 
 Energy Bars, Power Bars, Granola Bars - Whatever you like to call them, they can provide a quick energy boost in a convenient form. There are literally hundreds of different brands, combinations and varieties of ingredients that you can find at your favorite outdoor supplier or even in your local grocery store. You may have to try a few different ones before you find the one or ones that have the taste and texture you prefer. Again, most of these will require some water to wash them down.

 Peanut Butter - Peanut butter is an excellent source of protein and fat, as well as going with a lot of other foods. You can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or two (so you&apos;ll also get the sugar from the jelly and the carbs from the bread), put in on crackers, on bagels, dip apple slices in it, drizzle raisins on it or just eat it straight. Most manufacturers already offer a squeeze tube type packaging option that is a great convenience when you&apos;re out on the trail.

 Tuna Fish - Another excellent source of protein and (if packed in oil) fat. Good on crackers or spread across some sandwich bread or wrapped in a pita. If it&apos;s too dry for you, bring along some mayonnaise packets that you can get from your nearby fast-food restaurant. Skip the old-fashioned cans and cut your pack weight by using the new fresh pouch bags packaging.

 Cheese - A good source of protein and calcium and easy to pack. Sliced cheeses are convenient and hard cheeses can be cut into chunks for easy packaging. The deli section in most stores also sell cheese already cut into chunks and bagged for even extra convenience. If you in a very warm climate, it might be a good suggestion to consume the cheese during the morning part of your hike, to avoid any potential issues. Pair up the cheese with some fresh fruit and you&apos;ll have a great mid-morning snack.

 Trail Mix - Trail mix or gorp is a favorite food item on the trail. Easy to pack and to eat while hiking, as well as being tasty and a quick source of energy. The major drawback is that most common pre-packaged varieties are heavily weighted in fat content. Some fat is good and necessary; too much is tough on the digestive process. Most experienced hikers will prefer to make their own with ingredients of their own choosing.

Whatever your food choice on the trail, remember to pack out everything you pack in; leaving the outdoors as you found them.
