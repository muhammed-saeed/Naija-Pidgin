Five day old baby stolen in carjacking
 By: WXIA | CountOn2.com

 ATLANTA -- A five day old baby went on a ride of his life but probably didn&apos;t even know what happened. His mother did. Her van, with the infant inside, was carjacked outside a day care Tuesday morning.

The carjacker apparently didn&apos;t realize the baby was in the van when he stole it and dropped the baby at a fast food restaurant on Whitehall Street, about six blocks away.

Imagine the surprise to clerk James Ku when the man lugged the baby&apos;s car seat into Wings R Us and dumped it with the baby on the counter. &quot;He looked like the baby&apos;s father,&quot; Ku said initially. &quot;Everything looked good until he walked in and set the baby down and he said he found the baby on the side of the road.&quot;

 Ku said the man told him he was a teacher at a school down the street. That&apos;s when Ku got suspicious because he noticed the man was wearing two thick gold earrings. The man told Ku to call 911.

It was the end of some harrowing minutes for the baby and his mother, though Ku said the baby slept through the whole thing. It started at Central United Methodist Church on Mitchell Street where the five day old baby&apos;s mother dropped two other children off at daycare.

&quot;She left her car running with the infant child in the back seat with the AC on,&quot; said Atlanta Police Officer James Polite . &quot;She said she was in there about two to three minutes to make sure her child got in good and by that time she saw her vehicle driving off.&quot;

Police reunited the baby and his mother Lauren Ringer at Ku&apos;s restaurant after he called 911. &quot;She just came here, she was just crying, she was speechless, she didn&apos;t say anything, she just sat there and cried,&quot; he said.

&quot;Do not leave your child unattended in any vehicle for any time, a minute, five minutes, that&apos;s just how long it takes for someone to get in your vehicle and take it,&quot; Officer Polite said.
