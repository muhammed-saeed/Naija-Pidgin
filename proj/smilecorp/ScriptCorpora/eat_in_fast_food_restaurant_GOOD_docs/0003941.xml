US/Portugal culture: fast food
 
The US has exported its fast food culture all over the world, but much of Portugal is still immune. While the big malls have Burger King, McDonald’s, KFC and Pizza Hut in their food courts, you won’t find them elsewhere except in the larger cities.

What you’ll find instead are the churrasqueiras, or grills. These are locally owned businesses, usually staffed by the owners and their families. Some have seating, though it’s often rather superfluous since the vast majority of their customers order takeaway. They offer several types of grilled meat, including pork ribs, but by far their biggest seller is chicken.

 

Using grill racks similar to but larger than those used for sardines, the cooks flatten a whole chicken butterfly-style into the rack and set it over the grill. This is the healthiest fast-food chicken I’ve ever seen. Cooked over a real fire and basted in a sauce of olive oil and spices, it’s low-fat and absolutely delicious. Not to mention incredibly cheap—we can feed our family of three for ten euros.

The not-so-healthy part of the meal is the fried potatoes, or what I knew as French fries. Note: nobody over here, and by“here”I mean Europe, calls them French fries. The French didn’t invent them, nor are they known for making particularly good ones. Actually some of the best fried potatoes I’ve had were in Belgium (which claims their invention), but the Portuguese version is very close. What makes them so good is the same thing that makes them so unhealthy—they’re double-fried. The first dip into the oil is just to give them the idea. Then they’re set aside until a customer places an order, at which point they’re dunked again. The result is piping hot fries with a perfect combination of hardened exterior and soft, fluffy interior.

I am utterly addicted to these fries. Since I have a 9-year-old stepson, we are occasionally obliged to visit the Burger King in the mall (because it’s exotic!), and those fries are garbage. I can’t believe I used to think they were good.

Some churrasqueiras sell their fries by the serving, others by weight. Where they’re sold by weight, the staff display a rapid routine in which they whip a piece of paper onto the scale, dump a scoop of fries onto it, toss salt over the top and then twist the paper into a cone, all in about six seconds. Fries at a churrasqueira are easy, cheap, delicious and entirely too tempting.

 

The chicken is also served in a rapid-fire manner. The cook forks it off the grill and onto a tray, then grabs it with a pair of tongs and uses scissors to cut it up. Next he plucks a paintbrush from the sauce bowl and bastes the pieces. By default, the“normal”sauce is used, but if you request piri-piri, you get the spicy stuff. (Piri piri is a hot red pepper, ubiquitous in Portuguese cooking.)

A paper lid is placed on top and the foil edges of the container are pressed down, resulting in a heat-retaining, recyclable takeaway container. The whole process takes maybe 20 seconds. Watching these folks at work during the dinner rush hour is something to see, and will completely blow one’s image of the laid-back Portuguese.

Other than the churrasqueiras and the pizza joints, there really isn’t a fast food culture here. Then again almost every restaurant offers takeaway, so maybe there is a fast-food culture, just not American style. Food is one of the things that is still inexpensive in Portugal, and it’s often cheaper for us to order takeaway than to make a meal at home. Not only that, but the takeaway can be quite healthy, because it’s produced by locally-owned restaurants—meaning not much is preprocessed—and the main source of fat is olive oil.

I don’t miss American fast food. What I do miss, however, are taco stands—which aren’t really American at all, but a perfect combination of Mexican tradition and US business style. At the moment I would kill for a good spicy pork soft taco with lime juice and salsa.

Oh, well. The grilled chicken leftovers in the fridge will do for now.

To tell the truth, I’ve been a US expat living in Wales for a month shy of four years now and the only thing I really miss about life in the USA is Mexican food. I’d go to great lenghts for some homemade tamales with pico and a fried egg on top!

IF you live in Faro you should visit Papa 24, it’s a fast food restaurant that combines several types of cuisine in on place, you can order chinese food, pizzas,giant hot dogs, burguers, Italian food and one of my favourites wich are the suckling pig sandwichs wich were a must during my college years down there.
Speaking of suckling Pigs have you ever visited the Bairrada Region between Porto and Aveiro? Theyr are world famous for their roasted suckling pigs, the best place to eat them is at Rei dos Leitões http://maps.google.pt/maps/place?hl=pt-PT&amp;cr=countryPT&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=rei+dos+leitoes+mealhada&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=pt&amp;hq=rei+dos+leitoes&amp;hnear=mealhada&amp;cid=9993505377529613824

Beth—do you suppose we miss Mexican because it’s the one thing we really can’t find? There are Mexican restaurants here, but they’re few and far between, expensive, and not as good as what I’m used to.

Golan—I don’t live in Faro, but it’s not far away. I’ll check out Papa 24, mostly for the suckling pig sandwiches, which sound fantastic! And while I’ve driven through the area you speak of, we didn’t stop for suckling pig. Thank you, I’ll add that to my (ever lengthening) list.

Please, have mercy. You must put a warning on your gastronomical posts: Do not read just before mealtime. What a mouthwatering description.

OH that sounds yummy Fletcher–Wish I was there to taste it.

That‘Double Dopping’sounds like what I know as Blanching (my dad had a Fish and Chip store in Gisbourne many years ago) and is done to reduce the actual cooking time of the fries in comparison to the Fish, Sausages, Hot Dogs (really just a Saveloy in batter) by reducing the water content of the Potato in order for it all to come out at the same time.

I love that Chicken you describe. We have a Rotisserie Chicken takeaway place locally, but the way that Chicken you describe is cooked, I’d definitely love to try here.

My classmates and I used to go to a chip shop down by the beach once a week when we had our teaching placement in Gizzy! So fatty, but soooo good

Heh, probably wouldn’t have known my Dad’s then, He used to be down the bottom end of London St. in Kaiti but he sold up half way through the 1980′s

In the Algarve this type of chicken is very famous, we called it Franguinho da Guia, small chicken from Guia. I don’t eat it regularly, I’m not a big fan of poultry chicken, I prefer free range home grown chickens, they are more tastier and healthier. You should try Arroz de Cabidela, Cabidela Rice, it’s one of my favourite dishes, rice with chicken and chicken blood, it’s very good. I don’t think i’s available in the South of the country, it’s a regional dish from the Minho Region.

Oh, come on…what about soup? I’d call that an original portuguese fast food, especially since the soup restaurants started to spread like crazy in malls all over the country!

Ever thought that fast food has been around since ancient Rome. Medieval London (Thames harbor) even had its own 24h fast food take away (1). Around the world it is better known as street food. The way for the “urban poor” to have access to food, ‘hot and ready-to-eat’.
Whenever in a foreign country I search for local street food sellers, looking where it’s crowded with locals, checking first on some basic hygiene and then start enjoying the local dishes. Most of the times my taste buds do double flips, my purse is happy and very seldom does my stomach complain. Further info int.all. on http://www.streetfood.org/

Good point! I forgot about soup. You’re right, it’s everywhere, and the fastest of all possible fast foods.

About Oregon Expat
 
Sometimes the best view is from the outside, and an American expatriate living in Portugal is, in many ways, outside of both nations. The views can be spectacular. I&apos;m also a science nerd, Mac dweeb, and grammar geek, so the posts in this blog tend to be eclectic.

Click the &quot;About&quot; tab if that wasn&apos;t quite enough detail.
