Health, fitness or fun, Cardel Place features a fitness centre, a multi-component aquatic facility, three gymnasiums, two NHL-size arenas, and a branch of the Calgary Public Library as well as community meeting rooms and offices, a pro shop, sports medicine clinic, child minding services, and food services facilities.

In the mid-nineties, The City of Calgary, along with a group of respected community leaders, began to discuss the need for a regional recreation centre in north central Calgary. Our dream was to build a community hub – a place to meet, learn, socialize, grow and play – a place to be.

To realize this vision, the Nose Creek Sports and Recreation Association (NCSRA), a community based not-for-profit organization, was formed in 1997. Seven founding member organizations and nine additional community leaders were selected to form the NCSRA’s volunteer Board of Directors.

After an extensive community consultation process, the NCSRA entered into partnership with the City of Calgary – they provided the land and majority of capital resources to build the facility and we, the community, assumed full responsibility for both start-up and on-going operating expenses. In 2003, the NCSRA negotiated naming rights with Cardel Homes and at long last, Cardel Place was born.

On September 20, 2004 we invited all of our families, friends and neighbours to ‘come out and play.’ Our new 195,000 square foot facility was the first Canadian recreation centre to become LEED™ Gold accredited, a distinction enjoyed only by qualified, energy efficient and environmentally sustainable buildings in North America.

Our founders envisioned a place to play where their communities’ social, emotional, spiritual, mental and physical needs would be met under one roof. This holistic approach to wellbeing continues to set us aside from other recreation facilities. As a result, we’ve become a leader in enhancing the health, wellness and quality of life of our communities – we’ve become the place to be.

Thank you for making our first five years a success!
