 Earth-185 (Parallel England No. 185 / 185th Parallel): Papist Affair, 
first ever Luther Arkwright strip. In 1524 Catherine of Aragon gave Henry VIII a 
son. As a result he did not remarry, Elizabeth I not born, and Henry never broke 
with Rome. His son Henry IX proved a tyrant and religious fanatic, persecuted 
all who were not Catholic, Tudors held crown and many countries fell to English 
rule, forming the Holy British Empire. No world wars, by 1970s decadent England 
still ruled Europe and Americas, but dissent was growing, and Luther Arkwright 
helped the resistance.

 EARTH-1287 (Nick Fury, Maverick, Strikeforce: Morituri)
   --Strikeforce: Morituri#1 (2-31
   --[Exiles#62], 83
        Note: Strikeforce Morituri took place on Earth, yes, 
but it&apos;s an Earth of maybe twenty years in the future as of 
the 1980s, where IIRC superhumans never existed until the title team was created 
to fight the alien Horde (oh, and there were a few&quot;in-joke shots&quot;like seeing 
Galactus&apos;s helmet on the Horde ship, but, really, it might as well have been an 
Epic series like&quot;The One&quot;or&quot;Brats Bizarre&quot;for all the connection it had to 
anything else). As off the 1980s Marvel Universe map as G.I. Joe.
   Sort of like Earth-Supreme-Power with an invading race as the 
catalyst for the story developments instead of just the one alien infant, I 
guess.
   But there&apos;s nothing to say that on such an Earth, the 
government didn&apos;t employ an agent called Maverick and that he couldn&apos;t have been 
under the authority of a guy who looked like Nick Fury. There&apos;ve been odder 
juxtapositions, and since Exiles didn&apos;t have any problem pulling characters from&quot;far enough in the future&quot;that Nightcrawler, Magneto, etc. could have adult 
offspring, there&apos;s no reason Maverick-1287 couldn&apos;t have been pulled from 
Strikeforce Morituri&apos;s&quot;future&quot;(explaining why he&apos;s a COSTUMED government 
agent). It&apos;s the easiest way to explain why the same Earth-number is applied to 
both concepts, for those few of us who care.

like Blonde Phantom being an Avengers leader, with teammate Marvel Boy, in the

with the Tri-Level Brain, exists in this reality with a tall vertical test tube 
on his head, containing three brains (at least two are alien). The last events 
in this reality show Void killing Cranio (in the late Silver Age), killing 
Sentry, absorbing his power and taking his place as the new Sentry, although the

America (and their sidekicks Robin (Grayson) and Bucky) teamed up to
find out why the Joker was trying to steal a nuclear
warhead. When the Joker found out he was working for the Red Skull, a
Nazi, he tried to end their partnership, but the Red Skull had the
Joker knocked unconscious. With the warhead loaded on a plane headed
for Washington, D.C., Captain America and Batman tried to stop it. The
Joker awoke and tried to disarm the bomb, but his struggle with the
Skull caused both of them to fall out of the plane. Batman and Cap took
over the plane, averting disaster. At some point near the end of the
war, Captain America disappeared. Twenty years later, the new Batman
(Grayson) and the new Robin (Bruce Wayne, Jr.) found Captain America
encased in a block of ice, and revived him. Back at the Batcave, the
two, along with a retired Bruce Wayne, Sr., welcomed the hero back.

 Earth-6674&quot;00-66-74&quot;Post Urban Collapse. After a prolonged Second World War, a 
lack of co-operation between the victorious Allies and the apathy of the 
vanquished caused post-war recovery from economic ruin to be desperately slow. 
The U.S. gained control of the Middle East&apos;s oil producing countries, and was on 
the road to recovery, when the Russian Revolutionary State declared war to&quot;liberate&quot;the oil nations. The Oil War lasted until 1959, drawing in Europe; in 
the aftermath, Europe expected aid and oil share from America when the oil 
states were divided between the two main aggressors, but received neither. 
Rioting, anarchy and the collapse of centralized government followed. By the 
1980s Europe had been a wasteland for a decade, the remaining population 
returning to primitive feudal systems, serving Petrol Barons in return for 
protection from roving bandit gangs. How much of the above is Disruptor 
influenced is uncertain.

However the Church proved sterner masters than any of the New Caesars, weakening 
and then removing the nobility following a policy of&quot;all men equal under God.&quot;Some nobles willingly surrendered their lands to the Church in return for 
positions in the Church. More than 160 years of world theocracy followed, with 
science reserved by and for the Church, few of its benefits reaching the people.

Approximately 25 years in the future, Roxxon dominated not only Earth but had a 
presence in space as well; a Resistance led by a mysterious General led Roxxon 
to send their Peaceloks (aka Deathloks) -- corpses of human criminals bonded to 
sentient computers as cyborg warriors -- 25 years into the past to exterminate 
any hero who might become the General. The General, in response, had his agent 
Miranda L. Bayer send visions to her own past self to help oppose the Deathloks. 
In the modern era, one of the time-traveling Peacelok computers bonded to a 
unidentified sociopath&apos;s corpse took over their collective body upon developing 
connection to human emotion, slew the other Deathloks, rescued the sociopath&apos;s 
young self, and transported away to experience life. This Deathlok eventually 
became the Resistance&apos;s General, and following his past self&apos;s actions, he 
guided Bayer to send the rescued boy to Danmar Orphanage, where he would grow up 
to become a serial killer, mirroring his human self&apos;s own past. Wolverine:

Wonder Man, Moondragon, Quasar, Giant Man, Volstagg, Vision, Cyclops, Thing, Dr. 
Doom, Photon, Hercules, Ms. Marvel, Magneto) with him to fight Ultron and his 
forces. Based on advice from Avengers-616, Ultron allowed himself to be defeated 
to prevent Kang from further disrupting time in efforts to defeat him (as per

escaped into the timestream and had reworked history briefly. They misinformed

 Earth-30247&quot;03-02-47&quot;Japanese Empire Variation. Contact and trade with the 
Portuguese led to the Shogunate being exposed to and swiftly grasping the 
potential of firearms and Western nautical skills. China was invaded and 
subjugated after a century of intermittent, bloody conflict. In the West 
meanwhile the powerful influence of the Catholic Church retarded scientific 
advancement; Japan initially accepted Catholicism, but in 1879, secretly 
influenced by the Disruptors, Imperial decree returned it to its old faith, 
leading to an inevitable war between the Catholic and Japanese Empires, during 
which Japan made fantastic advances in science and industry, likely through 
Disruptor influence. The war ended in 1902 with Japan&apos;s Emperor taking the title 
Lord of All the World. Since then Japan has continued to make advancements at an 
accelerated rate: Industry is now centered in Europe, Russia and America, while 
the heavily defended Japan and China have become vast gardens for the Japanese - 
all First Class Citizens. Europeans have been declared Third Class Citizens - an 
improvement over their former status as slaves - since the Humane Reforms of 
1943. Indians, Africans and Arabs make up the Second Class Citizenry.

asked to borrow the Infinity Gems from the Illuminati; despite Black Bolt still 
being miffed that Santa never brought him the Speak and Spell he wanted, they 
agreed, but Santa had an adverse megalomaniacal reaction to wearing the Infinity 
Gauntlet. The Illuminati battled him to no avail, their energy attacks bouncing 
off force fields Santa generated, until Sub-Mariner threw a snowball with all 
his Atlantean might, a lucky shot that struck Santa in the face, knocking him 
over and causing the Gauntlet to slip off his hand. Santa&apos;s normal amiable 
demeanor was restored, and he had no memories of what happened. Luckily (and 
somewhat bizarrely, as his fellow Illuminati point out), Iron Man happened to 
have a herd of flying robotic reindeer available, and lent them to Santa to 
complete his deliveries.

 Earth-113500 (Ginny Stark) - By 2052, Earth has been 
ravaged -- by the Mandarin working for a&quot;master&quot;(unspecified in the story), 
using technology he forced an enslaved and tortured Tony Stark to design and 
build -- and is about to be broken; Stark&apos;s son, Howard Anthony Stark II, is an 
officer of the Mandarin&apos;s enforcers, and his granddaughter, Ginny, is a member 
of the ragged resistance. Both actually work together - they know that their 
father has designed failsafes against his own technology and are trying to 
activate those before it&apos;s too late. The failsafes are very high-powered EMP 
bombs designed in 2011. They are spider-shaped as part of a mnemonic sing-song 
to remember how to build them. Ginny managed to build about 90% of such a bomb. 
During an extermination sweep, her father discreetly completes and films the 
distinctive circuitry. When *his* father sees the image, he remembers the 
mnemonic sing-song and how to activate the failsafes. H. A. Stark II is killed 
in a suicide run to protect his daughter as the other enforcers realize that 
he&apos;s a traitor. Tony Stark kills the Mandarin, then activates nine EMP failsafe 
bombs, plus the one built by his children, killing all technology worldwide - 
include his heart. The Earth is ravaged and bereft of technology but the few 
survivors, including engineering genius Ginny Stark, still have a planet.

approximately 70 years behind ours. Napoleon killed by stray cannon ball during 
Russian campaign of 1892. Without his leadership, France&apos;s armies were 
destroyed, and Louis XVIII reinstated on the throne by Allied armies. His weak 
leadership resulted in internal rebellions and economic recessions which have 
kept France weak ever since, and without France as an impetus, the German states 
never united, leaving two countries to become unrivalled world powers. The 
American Revolution failed because Britain was not fighting France at the same 
time, and so America chose to remain part of the commonwealth and the British 
Empire. Russia and Britain became the world superpowers, carving up Africa and 
Asia between them, but the close links between their Royal houses kept the two 
sides as friendly rivals, until the Disruptors stepped in.

Earth-340909 - The question of secrecy, and of fighting the Disruptorr, in 
secret, first became an issue on Para 34-09-09, in 1920. Due to W.O.T.A.N.&apos;s 
interference (using Valhalla Nova&apos;s most powerful telepaths) the World War I of 
this parallel had continued for far longer than the Disruptors desired. ZeroZero 
further manipulated the Disruptors into increasing the power of the Anglo-French 
American colonial states, in an effort to hasten the end of the war. In the 
final days of the war the Americas declared their independence, and ZeroZero 
took the previously untried action of informing this Earth of the existence of 
the parallel Earths, of themselves and the Disruptors. Within hours the 
fledgling American Federation was destroyed by nuclear attack, devastated by 
weapons launched on a different parallel which emerged at ground-zero on 
34-09-09.
