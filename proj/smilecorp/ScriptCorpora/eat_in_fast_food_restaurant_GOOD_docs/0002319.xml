DISCOUNTED: This VC 3000 Commercial Vapor Steam Cleaner is being sold at 
 a $150 discount. Steam is in excellent condition and works 
 perfectly. Unit history : Sold to a customer and it seems 
 it was returned with no clear explanation. The steamer was put 
 in our storage area and sat for 7 months in its box. We recently 
 unpacked this unit and inspected it and tested it. Everything is 
 in 100% working order and the unit looks great. There may be a 
 few scuffs on it from shipping it to and from its original 
 destination. For this reason we are offering it at a discount. 
 Most companies would simply pack this unit up as new and resell 
 it as new. Our policy only allows us to sell un opened units as 
 new. That is the main reason for the discount. Also note, 
 the original sale date for this steamer was December, 2011, 
 about 6 months ago. The warranty is based on the original sale 
 date. The standard limited lifetime warranty applies minus the difference from 
 the original sale date, about 6 or 7 months. Fully 
 warranted, fully functional and ready for use. Only One 
 available, first come first serve. Steamer sold AS IS, no 
 retruns. 
 
 
 
       --- General Terms: As with all repacked or 
 reconditioned units you may expect, besides the described 
 information above, scuff marks, scratches or minor pings / dents and signs that the unit was handled and repacked. All repacked or 
 reconditioned units are FULLY tested and inspected for quality 
 control. Repacked or reconditioned units are sold as is . You 
 may not return the item if you find scuff marks, scratches or 
 other minor damage not described in the offer. The large 
 discount offered in the price is designed to compensate for such 
 instances . The only exception to the no return 
 policy is if the steamer is defective meaning non operational. Not liking the performance, appearance or it not being useful 
 for your special needs are not grounds for return . If you 
 are not sure that this kind of unit is for you perhaps you 
 should give us a call before ordering or do some research on 
 this particular technology.
  
       --- What is a 
 reconditioned unit ?  At times, though this is 
 very rare a customer will receive a new steamer and find 
 cosmetic blemishes, damage or mechanical problem often caused by the shipping process. In such cases we 
 immediately have UPS pick up the steamer and send the 
 customer a new replacement steamer at no cost to them. We then test, clean and if 
 needed make any minor repair. Once Fully inspected the unit 
 is repackaged and sold as reconditioned at a discount.

      --- 
 Most repacked or reconditioned units could pass for brand new 
 but in keeping with our policy 
 of selling ONLY FACTORY FRESH NEW STEAMERS AS NEW we discount 
 these units . This his gives you a great 
 opportunity to get a great discount. Note: Most companies big 
 and small, repackage reconditioned items and sell them as brand 
 new! We will never do this. That is one of the many differences 
 that makes Just Renew It! Industrial Supplies stand out 
 from the competition.  
       --- What is a 
 reconditioned unit ?  At times, though this is 
 very rare a customer will receive a new steamer and find 
 cosmetic blemishes caused by the shipping process and other 
 times just some unexpected mechanical defect. In such cases we 
 immediately have UPS pick up the steamer and send out the 
 customer another brand new one. We then test, clean and if 
 needed make any minor repair need. Once Fully inspected the unit 
 is repackaged and sold as reconditioned at a discount.
