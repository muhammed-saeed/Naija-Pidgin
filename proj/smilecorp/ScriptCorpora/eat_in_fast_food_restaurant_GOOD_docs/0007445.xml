 Restaurant Questionnaire 
 
 Search and Ye Shall Find 
 Thursday, August 4, 2011 by Greg Timpany In today’s online marketing world the term ‘search’ invariably
refers to search engine optimization or search engine marketing or
Google, or some other derivative. However, long before SEO and SEM
search meant something more than just key words and pay per
click.

As market researchers our interest is not in just ‘how’ a consumer
or business client found us, but in their search process as a
whole. The end of the process may have included a Google search,
but that is just the tip of the proverbial... Continue Reading» View Full Post » 
 3 Reasons I Like this Restaurant Questionnaire 
 Monday, May 23, 2011 by Cynthia Spitalny I recently made reservations for a restaurant online.  I was
dining with mostly family, and we had a great experience and a
delicious dinner.  We all went home as happy customers. 
The next day I received a restaurant questionnaire.  While
restaurant questionnaires are not new in the survey business, I
really liked this email questionnaire because:

 Asked about the cost of the food as it related to how I
felt about my dining experience - How many times have you
left a restaurant and felt like the...

 The Fun is in the Gap: A Primer on Gap Analysis 
 Monday, March 21, 2011 by Greg Timpany There are many methods available to marketers to assess
satisfaction some of which are very sophisticated and require
extensive training to implement. Yet one of the most effective is
also one of the easiest to understand and put into action. Gap analysis looks at two dimensions to identify
differences between a desired and an actual state of
affairs .

In customer survey research this can be actionalized by comparing
the responses to two questions. For example satisfaction with a
product, feature... Continue Reading» View Full Post » 
 Three Reasons to Try a Comment Card 
 Wednesday, March 2, 2011 by Cynthia Spitalny While surveys and questionnaires can be great for getting detailed
customer insights about a brand, service, or product, they require
customers take the time and effort to complete the questions. 
There has to be a quicker way to get insights from customers and
for customers to give feedback than a survey or questionnaire -
right? Right .  The comment card can be a
powerful tool to enhance what you know about your business. 
Here are three reasons to try the comment card:

 A comment card can be...

 Getting the Most Out of Your Survey 
 Monday, November 8, 2010 by Greg Timpany Question
writing is as much an art form as it is science. As a skill it has
to be acquired via practice and a desire to improve. Many companies
are foregoing research during these challenging times; however
others are digging into the mine that is their customer base. To
maximize the value of a survey research program we have to be
confident that the questions we choose are both efficient and
effective.

A recent article in Quirk’s by Brett Plummer illustrates the dos and don’ts of... Continue Reading» View Full Post » 
 Keeping Them Satisfied 
 Monday, October 4, 2010 by Greg Timpany In a recent post I spoke to the need
for using best
practices when applying survey scales to measure customer
attitudes. No where is this more critical than when creating a
customer satisfaction survey. This should be accomplished in a way
that places as little effort on the respondent as possible.

It is not uncommon that satisfaction measurements are tied to
incentive compensation. As such, diligence needs to go into the
creation of satisfaction questionnaires. Significant research has
been done... Continue Reading» View Full Post » 
 When to Use Paper Surveys 
 Monday, August 23, 2010 by Cynthia Spitalny Paper
surveys are a great way to get on the spot feedback from all types
of customers. Comment cards, suggestion boxes, or questionnaires
are best used in businesses where transactions occur, such as in a
banks, restaurants, and hotels. Some gyms (including mine!) have
benefited from paper surveys as long as they are placed
strategically .

Why are paper surveys great for transactional customer feedback?
The customer experience is fresh and in-the-moment so customers are
more likely to give gut... Continue Reading» View Full Post » 
 Using Survey Incentives that Appeal to Your Audience 
 Tuesday, May 25, 2010 by David Murphy In Sherrie&apos;s most recent post, she debated the actual appeal of giving away an iPod for completing a
survey . In today&apos;s constantly evolving technological world,
Sherrie is right. So many people already have an iPod that its
value is much less significant as a giveaway. As you are preparing
to conduct research, it&apos;s important to think about who will be
completing your form. What kind of offerings will motivate them to
complete your questionnaire? What kind of offerings can also draw
them to your... Continue Reading» View Full Post » 
 Keeping Restaurant Customers Happy (And Eating) 
 Monday, March 1, 2010 by David Murphy As many consumers adjust their budgets in an uncertain economic
climate, it&apos;s important for businesses to make sure that they keep
their customers happy. Earlier, we discussed why banks are using surveys to ensure customers are
receiving the service they desire . In the restaurant business,
it&apos;s never been so important to make sure that everyone who leaves
your restaurant is satisfied.

 If you&apos;re the
manager, you know that gauging customer satisfaction from everyone
can be challenging. On crowded... Continue Reading» View Full Post »

Are you sure? Even though you think you know what customers want,
I&apos;m thinking you, like most executives, aren&apos;t quite all the way
there. Conducting customer research and getting customer feedback
can sometimes be harder than it should be. There&apos;s lots of reasons
for it. To get started down the right path of meeting your customer
satisfaction research goals, here are several tips for collecting
feedback from customers:
