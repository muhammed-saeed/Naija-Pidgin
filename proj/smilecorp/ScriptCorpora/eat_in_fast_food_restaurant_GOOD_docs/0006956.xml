SPUNK WIRE: Missing Boy Called Reincarnated Buddha Found at Hong Kong McDonald&apos;s
 by Rigolando Rodriguez, DS International Correspondent

HONG KONG, China - A 16-year-old boy regarded by many as the reincarnation of Buddha and disappeared after 10 months of meditation in Nepalese jungles was found this afternoon at a McDonald&apos;s in Hong Kong.

Since May 17, 2005, Ram Bahadur Banjan had been meditating sitting cross-legged and motionless in a hole at the base of a tree. His followers claimed he had not eaten or drank water since he began.

After his disappearance, there was speculation as to whether he went further into the jungle or was kidnapped.

When approached, he gave no explanation as to how he travelled or reached China, but instead was unexplainedly speaking in an American inner city dialect.

 &quot;Damn, I was just so hungry after 10 months of not eating or drinking,&quot; Banjan explained as he ate a Big Mac sandwich and fries. &quot;I couldn&apos;t wait any longer to get some grub, so I knew I had to get to the nearest Mcdonald&apos;s.&quot;

Witnesses described a ragged and tired Banjan meditating briefly on a bench with a life-size Ronald McDonald before walking into the busy restaurant determined to get food. They said he initially appeared to be calm and peaceful as he stood in line to order his meal, but quickly grew impatient as the line didn&apos;t move fast enough.

&quot;He just started throwing his hands up and screaming loudly &apos;Yo, what&apos;s a n***a got to do to get some good service around here ?! Shit, I thought this was a fast food restaurant !&apos;,&quot; said Yangzhao Zhu, who was in the restaurant at the time.

&quot;He was very hungry,&quot; added Zhu. &quot;He must have eaten three Big Macs, two double quarter pounders with cheese, at least four orders of fries, a chocolate triple thick shake, and five large Cokes.&quot;

Banjan was known to eat only leftovers for food and going hungry if there was nothing else. Also, before embarking on his journey and beginning meditation last year, he visited his family encouraging them not to kill animals.

He angrily replied when confronted about his sudden change of diet, saying &quot;Bitch, you try not eating for as long as I have,&quot; as he stuffed a handful of fries in his mouth, &quot;and see if you give a fuck about eating beef.&quot;

 Banjan said he was not going to return to meditating and continue his path to enlightenment, and admitted he knew he wasn&apos;t the reincarnation of Buddha all along.

&quot;I just started meditating cause I didn&apos;t want to go to school and my mom wouldn&apos;t shut the fuck up about getting a job,&quot; he said.

When asked about what he was going to do next, Banjan appeared unsure.

&quot;N***a, I don&apos;t even know...maybe I&apos;ll get one of those cages in the market so I can take a nap, &apos;cause I&apos;m tired as hell and I ain&apos;t about to go back to sleeping under no muthafuckin&apos; tree,&quot; he said.

Shortly after he finished his food, Banjan asked other customers for change for a bus ride. When no one offered any, he threw his food tray across the restaurant and exited angrily.

&quot;Man, fuck you bitches, I&apos;m out,&quot; he said as he left.
