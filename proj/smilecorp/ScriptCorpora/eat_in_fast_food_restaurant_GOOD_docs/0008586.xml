Select whole bean, or any of the following grind types:Infusion Grind (coarse):
Very coarse particles or flakes, like kosher salt. Grind this way for a cafetiere or coffee press, percolator, or vacuum pot. Ideal grind for methods with open-pore metal filters.Manual Drip Grind (medium-coarse):
Medium particles, looks and feels like coarse sand. Will not compress. Use this grind for a manual drip brew method (a pour-over) or in an automatic drip brewer if you use a gold filter. (This slightly coarse grind will result in less sediment in your cup when using a gold filter.)Auto-Drip Grind (medium fine):
Medium-fine particles. Looks and feels like grains of beach sand. Does not easily compress. This is the right grind for brewing in an automatic drip brewer with a paper filter.Espresso Grind (fine):
Fine particles. Feels almost like confectioner&apos;s sugar in your hand and can be compressed with little effort. The resulting brew is heavily extracted and tastes rich and heavy. This is the correct grind for espresso and coffee prepared in a moka-pot.Turkish Grind (very fine):
Very fine particles to powder. Tags: Fair   Trade   Organic   Coffee   Sampler   1399   shipped   Green   Mountain   Madhava Organic Agave Nectar - Amber, 23.5-Oz Bottles as low as $3.44 ea. Amazon $20.64 (Pack of 6) taking advantage of the subscribe and ship option.Text List Price:$40.43

My co-op will have these on sale periodically for 1.50. You can sometimes find a coupon to take the price down, but why bother??? Then again, Muir glen coupons have been scarce lately anyway.Not sure if they still line this in bpa, though they were supposed to have done away with those cans.According to camelcamelcamel, the last lowest price was 18.27 without subscribe and save. Snap them up before they are gone.
**************In addition to this, I would recommend their pizza sauce Text. Although it is 20.03 (still a good price) with s/s, it is still cheaper than the stores and if you look at the reviews, it is great sauce. This I can attest to. So far these have been coming to me with bpa free cans. Sometimes I will add this to Chili or god knows what if I am out of other tomato products. If you ever find that your dish is a little too acidic, just add a little baking soda.It wont get much lower than this camel
**************Also, I would like to **highly highly** recommend their ketchup Text. Do yourself a favor! I will never buy anything else again even if I have to pay a premium. Once you taste it, you will never buy Heinz or anything else again.

Product Description
For a certified-organic meal for the family, Annie&apos;s has created a larger-size version of its Shells&amp;White Cheddar. Made with only the best certified-organic ingredients, like organic durum semolina pasta and organic white cheddar cheese, Annie&apos;s Organic Family Size Shells&amp;White Cheddar is perfect as a side dish for a whole family or for serving a few hungry eaters.It takes a lot of hard work to grow the organic durum wheat that makes up these great shells. Our American family farmers do what they do because they have incredible respect for the land. Thanks to their care and consideration, some of this great nation&apos;s soil stays healthy, and you get to eat pasta that&apos;s been grown and processed without synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, genetically-modified organisms, or irradiation. And naturally. Annie&apos;s cheddar cheese comes from American organic dairy farms where cows are fed organic, nutritionally-balanced diets, and treated well.Product Description

Shipping less than $100 has a flat rate of $15, while anything more than $100 is free. Nature&apos;s Prime obtains its organic foodstuffs from a variety of Midwestern farmers who use renewable resources and conserve soil and water without resorting to antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, bioengineering, or gene splicing with giant carnivorous plants. Its bacon comes from Wisconsin; its fish are line-caught; its lamb hails from the Midwest; and its fresh fruit is delivered via giant suction tube directly from the Brazilian jungle. Tasty items such as Nature&apos;s Prime&apos;s fair-trade french-roast coffee ($17.30 for 12 oz.), Alaskan halibut ($16.25 for an 8 oz. fillet), and organic New York strip steak ($17.50 for 12 oz.) provide a higher-octane fuel for your food-injected stomach-engine. Cut out grocery-store middlemen and squeaky-wheeled shopping carts with today&apos;s Groupon to Nature&apos;s Prime Organic Foods. THE HIGHLIGHTS

I don&apos;t ordinarily buy organic.But! --- An aisle display in WalMart caught my eye because I approached it from the backside and saw the coupons printed on the cereal boxes.Cascadian Farms (organic) Granola, 17oz, $2.68
Box has 3 coupons printed on the back face:
$1.50 off WalMart fresh produce
$1.00 off Cascadian Farms granola bars (retail: $3.00)
$1.00 off Cascadian Farms granola cereal (retail: $2.68)We purchased 36 boxes of granola and used 36 of the box back-side coupons to spend $1.68 per box. We buy produce at WalMart anyway, so value the $1.50 produce coupon at face value. So, we consider these boxes to cost $0.18 each, NET.If you collect Boxtops for Education, these boxes also include those (10c per box). So perhaps you&apos;ll consider the net outlay to be $0.08 per box!Enjoy!

This candy store would produce allergen-free organic candies, and would contain none of the questionable ingredients that other candies do.All St. Claires Organics products are allergen-free, wheat-free, gluten-free, dairy free, casein-free, genetically-modified-organism-free (GMO), soy-free, corn-free, tree nut and peanut-free, egg-free, fish and shellfish-free, 100% vegetarian, fat-free, and low calorie.What is really amazing about St. Claires Organics is that their sweets have a low-glycemic index. A low-glycemic index rates how quickly the body is able to digest food, which would raise the body&apos;s blood glucose levels. A low-glycemic index is ideal for diabetics and those concerned with healthy dieting.From a natural, organic and yummy taste point-of-view, St. Claires Organics are simply the kid-friendly best!St. Claires Organics makes certified organic candy. We manufacture GREAT tasting healthy candy! Our manufacturing facility is dedicated Allergen-free. This means our candy is Wheat-free, Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Casein-free, Soy-free, Egg-free, Peanut-free, Tree nut-free, Corn-free, and Fish and Shellfish-free. That is an impressive list of allergen-free items that St. Claire&apos;s Organics consumers do not have to worry about, and this is what makes St. Claire&apos;s Organics the child-friendly candy.Not only is our organic candy Allergen-free, but it tastes great and is low-carb... so Go Organic today!

Start with the Collector&apos;s Edition of Disney&apos;s Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force game for Nintendo DS game systems. This charming E-rated game includes DS-only mini-games and allows you to transfer &quot;coins&quot; earned to online accounts. It also includes a special stylus, an Elite Penguins Force DS skin, and a 2500-coin card for use in your Club Penguin account.  

It&apos;s only $12.99 (and would ship for $4.98, if purchased alone). 

Next, take advantage of the current Amazon Gold Box Lightning Deal, a 5-lb bag of YummyEarth Organic Lollipops in assorted flavors. You&apos;ll receive approximately 325 lollipops in flavors like Pomegranate Pucker and Wet-Face Watermelon. 

They are not only organic, they&apos;re allergen-free, gluten-free, GMO-free, egg-free, soy-free, nut-free, casein-free and dairy-free, and this big assortment is only $14.94. Good thing they&apos;re flavor-full. 

&quot;Claim It&quot; on this page. If you want the lollipops only, be prepared to take a free trial of Amazon prime OR pay the regular Amazon price of $24.40.

Buy both, choose free Super Saver shipping, and you&apos;ll get the best possible pricing.
