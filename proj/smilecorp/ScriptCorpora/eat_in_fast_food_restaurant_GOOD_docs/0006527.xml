 Nancy Joseph 6/21/12 
 Good evening,
My name is Nancy Joseph. I am writing from fort Lauderdale FL and I would like to know when or if you all will be bringing the blue Berry cheese cake Sunday ice cream back! I was an absolute fan of the flavor. I honestly believe it was one of the best items on your menu and im sure im not the only person who would agree. Thank-you for your time.
Sincerely Nancy Joseph

 I wish there was an option for no stars! I&apos;m a former employee of checkers. Its been a month since i quit and havent yet recieved any money for working there. I&apos;m filing a lawsuit. 



 Roberta williams 2/17/12 
 I am very disappointed that checkers left my town so many years ago I drive over 50 miles at least twice a month to go to checkers I would like to know if it would be possible to bring checkers back to North Fort Myers florida the building that originally was checkers is still there and is empty I know there are several burger joints here it&apos;s just not checkers please consider coming back. I was an employee at the checkers when it was here due to a accident I was unable to continue there thank you for listening to me

 The checkers on 232 W. Lehigh Ave Philadelphia, Pa 19133 is the absolute worst place I ever ate at. First the male worker try to rip me off for $5, then he said there was no paper to print a receipt, and also i seen that the fries had been just sitting in the mettle basket ready to be poured into the oil, in other words they were pre-cooked since it only took 30 seconds to warm up. The food was terrible i will report this to the district and regional managers as well as the corporate office and the health department 



 Disgruntled by Checkers 1140 Woodbourne Road, Levittown 11/15/11 
 For the first time, ever, I went to Checkers to try their food. I ordered food for my entire family which included an order of the loaded fries with cheese and bacon. When I returned home the fries weren&apos;t in the bag. Because it was rush hour and the Checkers is not close to my home, I decided not to run all the way back to get the fries. Last night, I returned to Checkers and was ready to place another large order with them, at the same location. I spoke to a manager about replacing the fries for me. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t have my receipt. So, she made me wait while she checked &quot;the cameras&quot; and interrogated me about what day I placed my original order. Needless to say, I didn&apos;t end up with a replacement order of fries because I couldn&apos;t prove that they had screwed up. It seems to me that Checkers has no trust in their customers and could care less about whether they are satisfied and if they will ever be return customers. If I went to any other fast food restaurant, I would have had a replacement order of fries! I will never eat at Checkers EVER AGAIN!

 I went to the Checkers in the Snellville are in Georgia on the 8/20. The employee&apos;s where not wearing any hair net and gloves. I bought a spicy chcken meal and found a hair in my sandwich. Then I later got food poison real bad and they treated me real bad. They ignore my phone calls and all my messages. I am being treated real bad and it hurt because I did not ask for this. 



 Bernice Stephens 7/31/11 
 I visted the Checker Restaurant located on Riverdale Road, College Park Georgia 30349 on July 31, 2011, Sunday afternoon around 4:15 pm. I ordered the Big Chicken combo. It was a complete mess. The bacon was entirely raw and I removed it from the sandwich, the lettuce was brown and limp and I removed it from the sandwich. The sandwich had too much mayo causing a complete mess and it was tastely so I ended up dumping the whole sandwich in the trash along with the cold french fries. The tea was overly sweet. Usually I take back such mess as this, but I was too tired and did not want to waste more gas. 



 e polite 5/14/11 
 I called the drive thru back because my order was so old my fish sandwich was hard as a brick. My fries tasted like Fart. They told me to call back in five minutes and i did then the manager eric hung up in my face. i called back and no answer. the worse service i&apos;ve received yet!!!

 I live in Palm Bay Florida we used to have two Checkers Drive In but suddenley they closed we keep seeing all your good adds on TV wishing we could go just like we used to.
Are there any plans to open any Checkers in the Palm Bay- Melbourne area in the near future. We hope so. Thank You.

Sincerly, Chris Ingram

 I went to the brand new location located on North Market in Shreveport, Louisiana. The food was horrible. First of all, these burgers are no bigger than a happy meal burger you would get from Mcdonalds,totally unlike the picture used to represent it on the dive thru menu board. The bun was soggy, soaked with mayo, and the meat was thin and tasteless, The Tea was like snow cone syrup...I could go on and on but I won&apos;t, the food sucks...I will never return. 



 Shaden Thompson 11/3/10 
 I went to the checkers on Alpine in the Walker District drive thur, in the food was cold and nasty. In went I asked to remake my sandwich they were mad about the sandwich that they messed up. In on top of that they have no people skills. The corporate office need to do in undercover stink operations on their stores,so they can see how they act in how nastry the food and work place is. 



 Mark Richardson 10/12/10 
 I went to the checkers in Mobile, AL in Tillman&apos;s Corner. I was hungry and went thru the drive up. I got my food and went home. When i took a bit of the burger the meat was raw and not cooked. I was sick to my stomach and worried about the problems of eating raw beef. I have pictures of the hamburger,

 Long Beach, CA Checkers (Cherry Street&amp;PCH) 8/20/10 
 Although I am a HUGE fan of the taste and quailty of the food, getting to it with those HORRIBLE employees, proves more than just a feat!

Rally&apos;s have been offering a &quot;FREE MILKSHAKE WITH ANY PURCHASE&quot; coupon. Trying to redeem that puppy, is a whole other story! Since I go there often, each one of my experiences with each shift, proves to be different but collectively, resulting in the same nasty experience each time. Its real simple math that if your milkshake machine is broke but offer a free product which you cannot honor, then OFFER SOMETHING ELSE IN ITS PLACE! WOW, getting them to understand that (including management) however, is something that requires the patience of JOB from the Bible. Other times is when the machine is working, and they argue whether you are eligible. Coupon says &quot;Free with ANY purchase&quot;. What part of ANY, doesn&apos;t translate people??? So, instead of getting my food, I have to order, in fear that it will come with a free side of aggrivation!! And as a result, the corporation lost a loyal customer, why?...... Long story short, Hire employees that understand even a little English, or, clearly spell out the language where it reads that if you&apos;re a rude and nasty employee, then you have no dealings with our establishment! No need for employees, if they have no customers to serve, PERIOD!!
