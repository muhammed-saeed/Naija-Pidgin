Wong Burger
 Edit this page 
 History 
 Added by LeoMathews Wong Burger is an Asian fast food restaurant. It appears in Dickesode and Hands on a Hamburger . Carl and the Aqua Teens order from this restaurant. When Carl buys a medium sized drink, he enables a binding contract that allows them to rip off his dick. Also, when you order a drink from Wong Burger, you are able to get a discount on your next order, or a new car by simply ripping off the bottom of your cup, and read what prize you get off of it. All the cups are winners. They often refer to it as a &quot;rip-n-win&quot;. Little did they know that one of the &quot;prizes&quot; is a 1 in 3 chance of getting your dick ripped off.



 Food they sell Edit 

 Wasabi and Teriyaki Fries (French Fries filled with sauce through a high-tensil needle.) Drinks-(small, medium, large, and &quot; the super sized trough&quot;) Edible Hand Truck with chocolate tires
