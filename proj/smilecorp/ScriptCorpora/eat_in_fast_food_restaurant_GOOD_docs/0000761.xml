Accesories store and makeup boutique open at CherryVale Mall
 Posted on June 2, 2011 at 7:50 pm by Melissa Westphal Tweet 
Two new stores are open at CherryVale Mall, 7200 Harrison Ave., in Cherry Valley.

 Bare Escentuals specializes in cosmetics, specifically its bareMinerals line of mineral makeup, and is open on the mall’s upper level near Macy’s. The store opened last month.

 Charming Charlie is a fashion accessories store that sells earrings, necklaces, bracelets, handbags, scarves and more. The store is open on the mall’s upper level near Ann Taylor Loft and just opened a few weeks ago.

 

For both stores, the locations are some of the only in Illinois outside of the Chicago and suburban Chicago area. Charming Charlie has a store in Peoria, and there are a limited number of official Bare Escentuals boutiques.

Visit CherryVale’s website for more information.
