Parisian-themed cafe open in Loves Park
 Posted on June 21, 2010 at 2:23 pm by Melissa Westphal Tweet 
 

The new Parisian-themed Rue la Paris Cafe opened for business today.

The cafe shares building space with several other local businesses including Dahlgren Johnson Kitchen and Bath and Canyon Flooring at 4001 N. Perryville Road in Loves Park, at the northeast corner of Riverside Boulevard and Perryville Road. It’s located in Suite D.

Royal Crown Events runs the restaurant, and the catering company itself just started in September. Royal Crown is the exclusive caterer for the Coronado Performing Arts Center and purchased the former River District Catering business.

Vanessa Larsen, Royal Crown’s executive event coordinator, said a restaurant was always in the original business plan for the company. She said the group is excited to get the cafe open and customers through the doors.

Royal Crown’s administrative breakdown is as follows: Rich Hilliard, owner; Dejan Vucic, corporate chef; Jason Wheeler, executive catering chef.

The cafe’s breakfast menu features light pastries and fresh fruit, while lunch features paninis, sweet and savory crepes and salads. The dinner menu features cold and hot appetizers like gourmet cheeses and stuffed mushrooms and entree selections with a European focus like grilled seafood, filet mignon with savory truffle potatoes and pasta carbonara. Several types of wine also are included on the menu.

The decor inside the cafe is designed to look like the outside streets of Paris. There is some outdoor patio space.

Hours are 9 a.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday. The cafe is closed on Sundays but is available for private rental for events like bridal showers, wine tastings, etc.

Patrons can access the cafe easiest by turning on McFarland Road off Riverside and then making the first left on Back Street. Drive around the parking lot, and the cafe entrance faces Perryville.

Call 815-654-2900 for more information or to place call-ahead reservations for tables. Reservations are not required, though.

Having been to Paris I’m really looking forward to trying it.

Rockford is way too blue collar for something like this to“fly.”It’s an unfortunate truth about the city.

Will it last longer then Cafe Patu?
 Rich says: June 21, 2010 at 6:03 pm 
I pass this every day and haven\’t noticed anything. Where is the signage? This place looks like an office building to me. Nothing about this corner says \&quot;hospitality\&quot;. I would love to try Rue La Paris as soon as I find it.

I give it two years at the very best.
Rockford’s a French Fry, French Toast, and French Kiss type of town.

Hi Rich—The cafe is in the portion of the building that faces Perryville, so look for the patio furniture out there. I think the owners are still working on the signage!
 Karen says: June 25, 2010 at 1:26 pm 
Just one question, have any of the blue collar workers in Rockford ever heard of Nippons???????
 Jill says: June 25, 2010 at 3:55 pm 
I have been there for lunch, the food was excellant and the chef came out to meet us. Everyone was very friendly.
 Tiffany says: June 29, 2010 at 3:52 pm 
We went last Friday and it was EXCELLENT! The food was great, the wine was great, the decor was awesome, and they had a 17 year old girl playing guitar and singing who was amazing!

Can walk to it, it’s right on the bike path. Enjoyed dinner Saturday night. GREAT food and wine–reasonably priced. I’ll definitely be a frequent flier.
 Deb says: July 1, 2010 at 10:11 am 
Ate lunch there last week. I thought it was terrible! Crepes looked like an unfried Burrito, too doughy. I won’t be back.
 STEVEIE2 says: July 15, 2010 at 2:29 pm 
I AGREE HAD DINNER THERE IT WAS TERRIBLE AND NOT AUTHENTIC AT ALL

I have been to Paris and stayed a month in France.
Sorry the food did not remind me of these memories. Didn’t even see much in the way of specialty cafe’. The panini bread was extremely thin and dry like a cracker. The crepes were rubbery and tasteless. I can make a better mousse at home with jello pudding.
So sad it is very cute inside and reminded me of Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. If they just had good food, who cares how hard it is to get to with little signage.

Tried to go to Rue la Paris last night for dessert and it appears it has been closed for good. That sure didn’t last long…..
 Melissa Westphal says: October 25, 2010 at 12:37 pm 
erock75: Just called Rue la Paris, and they’re still open. Said they closed a little earlier than usual on Saturday night because the weather was rainy and there were no customers.
 erock75 says: October 26, 2010 at 5:25 am 
Thanks for the update. Will have to try again.
 Mary says: November 21, 2010 at 7:41 pm 
Went there and they most have improved the food, because everything was incredible. The steak was amazing and the owners and service is outstanding. I recommend giving the place a second try, everyone goes through trial and error periods with any place.
 Margaret says: December 23, 2010 at 11:22 pm 
Went there a few weeks ago. Sorry, food is still terrible. Nothing remotely French. Just because you have crepes on a menu doesn’t mean you are serving french food. I don’t recall Cajun crepe being on the menu the last time I went to France a few months ago. I will say on the upside that the decor was cute but I was there to eat good food and this place didn’t deliver. On a side note, there were several Serbian wines? You would never find Serbian wine in a real french restaurant.
