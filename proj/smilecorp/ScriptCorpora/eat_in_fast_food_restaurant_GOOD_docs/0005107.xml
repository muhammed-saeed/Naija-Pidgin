 An
oral order for the deportation of the applicants (three of some 280
Haitian nationals who had landed illegally) was made by the Minister
of Labour and Home Affairs on a date before 9th February 1981. On
10th February, the 280 Haitians were arrested and detained. On 13th
February the Minister signed an order stated to be in exercise of the
powers conferred on him by sections 36 and 37 of the Immigration Act
1967 ordering the 280 Haitians listed in a schedule attached to the
order (which Included the names of the three applicants) to leave the
Bahama Islands and authorising any police or immigration officer to
“arrest and detain” them. The applicants applied for writs of
habeas corpus. On the return to the writs the respondents relied
upon the deportation order, originally made orally but reduced into
writing on 13th February, to justify the detention of the applicants. 

 Held, granting the applications, that - 

 (1)
An order for deportation under section 36(1) of the Immigration Act
1967 must be made in writing; accordingly, no valid deportation order
was in existence prior to the arrest of the applicants on 10th
February and their detention before the order was made on 13th
February was unlawful.

 (2)
The deportation order made on 13th February was not invalid by reason
only that it applied to 280 persons; moreover, there was no onus on
the respondents to establish the existence of the conditions
precedent to the making of the deportation order (section 36(1))
since the court could not enquire on an application for habeas corpus
into the truth of the facts stated to justify the detention.

 (3)
On the true construction of section 37(1) and (4), all order to
detain a person subject to a deportation order until he was removed
from the Islands Could only be made by the Governor-General; although
the Governor-General was required to act in accordance with
ministerial advice, such all order could not be made by the Minister
(article 71(2) of the Constitution of The Bahamas notwithstanding);
accordingly, that part of the order signed by the Minister on 13th
February which related to the detention of the applicants was void.

 Applications 

 Applications
for writs of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum Reno Jean, Michel Dauphin and Sede Decade (alias Sede John) applied
to the Supreme Court of The Bahamas (applications 103, 109 and 137 of
1981) for writs of habeas corpus. The respondents to the
applications 

 2 

 were
the Minister of Labour and Home Affairs, the Director of Immigration
and the Superintendent of Prisons. 

 F
R M Smith for the applicants 

 Neville
Smith Director of Legal Affairs for the respondents 

 Blake
J. The applicants are three out of 280 Haitian nationals who were
arrested and taken into custody by police and/or immigration officers
in the early hours of 10th February 1981. They were arrested at
various places in the island of New Providence and have been in
custody ever since. They are presently detained in the compound of
Her Majesty’s prison at Fox Hill. 

 On
16th February 1981, Reno Jean and Michel Dauphin applied ex parte for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Order 54, rule 1 of The
Bahamas Rules of the Supreme Court 1978. The applications were
supported by affidavits sworn by Mr Alexandre Paul, Consul-General of
the Republic of Haiti, on the ground that the applicants were unable
to make the affidavits themselves because they spoke very little
English and were unable to retain and instruct a legal representative
to act on their behalf. It was alleged in Mr Paul’s affidavits
that the applicants were detained as a consequence of the actions of
the Minister of Labour and Home Affairs, the Director of Immigration
and the acting Superintendent of Her Majesty’s prison at Fox Hill
(“the respondents”). The applications came before the court on
17th February 1981 and were adjourned so that notice could be given
to the respondents under Order 54, rule 2(1)( b )
and (2). 

 On
18th February 1981, Sede Decade (alias Sede John) made a similar
application. His application was supported by all affidavit sworn by
his common law wife (Pressina Joseph) who stated, inter alia, that in
the circumstances of his detention he was unable to make all
affidavit on his own behalf. As in the case of Reno Jean and Michel
Dauphin, it was deponed that the respondents were responsible for the
detention. Sede Decade’s application was heard on 19th February
1981; and an order was made similar in terms to that made in the
cases first mentioned, save that directions were given that the
application be heard four clear days after service of the notice on
the respondents. 

 The
adjourned applications in all three cases were returnable before the
court on 2nd March 1981. At that stage counsel for the applicants
stated that, through an oversight on his part, the affidavit of
Pressina Joseph in support of the third applicant’s application had
not been served on the parties to whom the notices were ordered to be
given. He said that it was impossible for him to proceed in any of
the matters unless he could make reference to Pressina Joseph’s
affidavit and he applied for an adjournment to serve that affidavit. 
The court signified its willingness to accede to this request and
asked counsel to consult amongst themselves and agree upon an early
date in view of the nature of the matter. Counsel were unable to
agree. Counsel for the applicants 

 3 

 suggested
Monday, 9th March. Counsel for the respondents counter-proposed 16th
March. In the circumstances it fell to the court to order that all
three applications be heard on Wednesday, 11th March 1981, and that
counsel for the applicants be at liberty to refer to the affidavit of
Pressina Joseph in the case of Sede Decade in support of his
arguments in relation to the applications of Reno Jean and Michel
Dauphin. I make reference to these matters merely to establish that
the court was always prepared to give the applications the priority
which they deserved, but was prevented from doing so because of the
failure of counsel for the applicants to serve Pressina Joseph’s
affidavit in due time, and his own application for a further
adjournment to enable him to make use of that affidavit. 

 When
the applications finally came to be heard on 11th March 1981 the
respondents relied on two affidavits: one sworn on 23rd February 1981
by Mr Lester McKellar Turnquest, deputy Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs responsible for immigration
matters, and the other sworn on 11th March by the Director of
Immigration. 

 The
cases advanced at the hearing by counsel for the parties centred
primarily around sections 8, 36 and 37 of the Immigration Act 1967,
as amended (“the Act”). Before proceeding to a consideration of
the arguments it may be useful at this point to summarise those
sections. 

 Section
8 empowers any immigration officer or police officer who has
reasonable cause to suspect that any person, other than a citizen of
The Bahamas or a permanent resident, has committed an offence under
the Act or regulations, to arrest that person without a warrant. 
Where such an arrest is effected, the person arrested must be brought
before a magistrate’s court without unnecessary delay, and not
later than forty-eight hours after arrest (unless he is earlier
released on bail by a police officer having power in that behalf
under the Police Act 1965). 

 Section
36(1) of the Act, as amended, provides that the Minister can make a
deportation order requiring any person (other than a citizen of The
Bahamas or a permanent resident) to leave The Bahamas within the time
fixed by the order and to remain out of The Bahamas, if it should
come to the Minister’s knowledge that such person: (i) has landed
or remained in The Bahamas contrary to any provisions of the Act,
(ii) has been convicted of an offence against the Act or any offence
punishable on indictment with death or imprisonment for two years or
upwards, or (iii) is a person whose presence in The Bahamas would (in
the opinion of the Board of Immigration constituted under section 4)
be undesirable and not conducive to the public good. 

 Section
36(2) makes it mandatory for a copy of the deportation order to be
served upon the person concerned in cases where that person was
lawfully in The Bahamas immediately before the order was made. Such
persons are given a right of appeal to the Governor-General against
the making of the deportation order. 

 Section
37(1) deals with the removal from The Bahamas of persons 

 4 

 who
are subject to deportation orders under section 36. It says that
such persons may be placed under the authority of the Governor (now
the Governor-General) on board any ship or aircraft which is about to
leave The Bahamas, and enjoins the master of the ship or the
commander of the aircraft (if so required by an immigration officer)
to take such steps as may be necessary to prevent such persons from
leaving the ship or aircraft before it leaves The Bahamas. 

 Section
37(4) goes on to provide that any person in respect of whom a
deportation order has been made may be detained under the authority
of the Governor-General until he is placed on board a ship or
aircraft pursuant to section 37(1). Where there is an appeal against
the making of the order, the power to place the deportee on board a
ship or aircraft or to detain him is postponed until the time limited
for appealing has expired, or the decision on the appeal is
published. It may be noted in passing that, whereas under the Act as
it stood in 1967 the powers to make the deportation order, remove the
deportee from the jurisdiction or detain him pending his removal were
all vested in the Governor, the effect of the subsequent amendment
has been to divide those powers. The power to make the deportation
order is now in the Minister, but the authority to remove the
deportee from The Bahamas, or detain him until he is removed, is
vested in the Governor-General. That is what the legislature in its
wisdom has chosen to do, and it is trite law that I am not entitled
to assume that there has been any mistake in an Act of Parliament. 
If there has been a mistake it is for Parliament to amend the law. 
My clear duty is to construe and apply the statute as I find it. 

 I
turn then to the arguments which have been addressed to me. To set
them in their proper context I mention here that the respondents rely
on a document entitled a “deportation order” annexed to the
affidavit of Mr Lester McKellar Turnquest. The document is signed by
the Hon Clement T Maynard, the Minister of Labour and Home Affairs,
and it bears the date, 13th February 1981. I shall return to it
later in the course of this judgment. For the moment it is
sufficient to say that the document in question contains a
deportation order against the 280 Haitian nationals whose names
appear on the list attached to the order, and also purports to
authorise their detention pending their removal from The Bahamas. It
is common ground between the parties that the names of the applicants
Michel Dauphin and Sede Decade appear on that list, and that the
applicant Reno Jean is the person described therein as “Renard
Jean” (deportee 138). Both Mr Turnquest and the Director of
Immigration, Mrs Barbara Pierre, depone that the deportation order
was made prior to 13th February 1981, but signed by the Minister on
that date. In fact paragraph 12 of Mrs Pierre’s affidavit states
that: 




‘ The
order for the deportation of Michel Dauphin and Renard Jean was made
and given by the Minister of Labour and Home Affairs prior to 9th
February 1981.’ 




 On
the basis of these statements it was submitted by counsel for the 

 5 

 respondents
that all oral order for the deportation and detention of the
applicants was in existence prior to their arrest on 10th February,
and that the document signed by the Minister on 13th February 1981
was merely evidence of a previous oral order for deportation and
detention. 

 Counsel
for the applicants has pressed me to find as a fact that his clients
were arrested on 10th February 1981 by police and immigration
officers in the exercise of their powers under section 8 of the Act. 
On this basis he contended that, since the applicants were not taken
before a magistrate’s Court by 2.00 a m on 12th February in
compliance with the mandatory provisions of the section, their
detention was, and continues to be, unlawful. That the applicants
were arrested pursuant to section 8 was the assumption which the
Consul-General for the Republic of Haiti chose to make in the
affidavits which he swore on thee 16th February in support of the
applications of Reno Jean and Michel Dauphin for leave to issue the
writ. His affidavits are, however, strikingly devoid of any material
to clothe the assumption with any factual foundation. To the
contrary, this gentleman elected to annex to his affidavits all
article which appeared in the Tribune of the afternoon of Tuesday, 10th February. This quotes him as
saying that he had been waiting for the Government of The Bahamas to
notify him of a date for the repatriation of Haitians who were in The
Bahamas illegally but instead “They went out and arrested them for
what reason I don’t understand”. In the case of Sede Decade, the
affidavit of Pressina Joseph (who incidentally appears barely able to
sign her name), reads more like a reasoned legal argument than a
statement of facts known to the deponent, or based upon information
and belief. Such statements as appear in that affidavit tend merely
to show that a large number of persons of Haitian extraction were
arrested at approximately 2.00 a m on the morning of 10th February in
circumstances in which some of the persons arrested were questioned
as to their status in The Bahamas, and that a number of the persons
who were originally arrested had subsequently been released. 

 The
Act permits persons other than citizens and permanent residents to be
taken into custody in the exercise of a variety of powers, of which
section 8 is only one. I find nothing in the affidavits of the
Consul-General or Pressina Joseph which would enable me to draw a
reasonable inference that the applicants were arrested on 10th
February in exercise of the powers vested in the police and/or
immigration officers under section 8 of the Act. Such a conclusion
would be tantamount to taking a leap in the dark and elevating
speculation into the realm of fact. 

 On
the other hand, I have before me the sworn affidavits of the Director
of Immigration and the deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Labour and Home Affairs. The Director of Immigration has deponed (in
paragraph 12 of her affidavit of 11th March) that an order for
deportation was made and given by the Minister on a day prior to 9th
February 1981. The deputy Permanent Secretary has stated that the
applicants have been detained pending their deportation under a
deportation order made by the Minister and subsequently signed on
13th 

 6 

 February.
 The necessary implication from all this is that the responsible
officials are saying that the Minister made all oral order for
deportation prior to the arrest of the applicants, and that the
arrests and subsequent detentions were effected pursuant to those
oral orders and authorisations which were confirmed by the written
order of 13th February 1981. The facts and circumstances surrounding
the arrests and detentions lie peculiarly within the knowledge of
these parties, and there is no evidence whatever to contradict them. 
Accordingly, I accept these statements and reject the submission of
counsel for the applicants that the arrests and detentions resulted
from the exercise of any powers under section 8 of the Act. 

 If
I am right in the finding of fact which I have made, it follows that
three basic questions arise for further consideration: (A) Does the
Act contemplate or authorise all oral order for deportation? (B) If
not, were the applicants in lawful custody between 2.00 a m of 10th
February 1981 and 13th February 1981 when the order was signed? (C)
If they were not, is the order of 13th February a valid order for
deportation and detention pending the applicants’ removal from The
Bahamas, notwithstanding the fact that their prior detention might
have been unlawful? I proceed to consider these matters in turn. 

 Oral
Order for Deportation 

 Counsel
for the respondents submitted that it was within the competence of
the Minister to make all oral order for deportation under section 36
of the Act. He was unable to produce any authority for this
proposition. He relied, however, on certain dicta of Pickford LJ in R v Chiswick Police Station Superintendent, ex parte Sacksteder [1918] 1 KB 578, and the decision in R v Brixton Prison Governor and the Secretary of State for Home
Affairs, ex parte Pawel Sliwa [1952] 1 KB 169 as lending support to his contention. 

 The Sacksteder case was decided against the background of the Aliens Restriction Act
1914 and article 12 of the Aliens Restriction (Consolidation) Order
1916 of the United Kingdom. Article 12(1) of the Order empowered a
Secretary of State to order the deportation of any alien. It
Stipulated that: 




‘ A
Secretary of State may order the deportation of any alien, and any
alien with respect to whom such all order is made shall forthwith
leave and thereafter or so long as the order remains in force, remain
out of the United Kingdom.’ 




 Article
12(2) authorised the Secretary of State to give directions for the
detention of any alien ordered to be deported, until he could be
conveniently conveyed to and placed on board a ship about to leave
the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State made (what appears from
the report to have been) a written order for the deportation of
Sacksteder. That having been done, he gave directions that the
deportation order be enforced immediately. Prior to that time he had
given general directions 

 7 

 that
any person named in a deportation order which was intended to be
enforced immediately should be arrested and conveyed from the United
Kingdom and detained between the time of his arrest and the sailing
of the ship selected for his passage. An Assistant Secretary in the
Home Office acted under the general directions and caused
instructions to be given to the police for Sacksteder’s arrest and
detention at Chiswick police station until he could be taken to the
ship at Southampton selected for his deportation. Sacksteder was
accordingly arrested and detained. 

 The
question of whether the deportation order was required to be in
writing or not, was never canvassed in the case. What was in issue
was whether the directions to arrest and detain Sacksteder were good
and valid. These directions were referred to in the argument as an
“order for arrest”. The point was taken that the Secretary of
State was required to consider the circumstances of each person
ordered to be deported, and determine whether such person ought to be
detained in custody before the power to detain could be exercised. 
Thus it was said that general directions that all persons ordered to
be deported should be immediately arrested and detained pending their
departure from the United Kingdom were bad, and that nothing appeared
to show that a specific direction had been given for Sacksteder’s
arrest and detention. In that context, Pickford LJ said, [1918] 1 KB
at page 586: 




‘ The
general order that is given is that anybody against whom an order is
made that the deportation shall be enforced immediately is to be kept
in custody and detained until that call be carried out. The
Secretary of State, according to the affidavit, examined into this
particular case and gave a direction that the deportation order
should be immediately enforced. As soon as he had done that it seems
to me that there was a determination by him that this case should
come within the general direction that had been previously given by
him. It is not necessary if he examines into the particular case and
gives a direction which he knows involves a certain consequence that
he should set out that consequence in that direction. It is not for
me again to consider whether it would not have been better that in
the Order of 1916 there should have been some provision as to the
form in which the order should be made. There is none. It seems to
me any direction, whether oral or written, if it be made by the
Secretary of State, is sufficient to satisfy the Order. There is
that direction in this case.’ 




 Pickford
LJ’s above quoted remarks were prefaced by a clear reference to
article 12(2) of the Order of 1916, which dealt exclusively with
directions which the Secretary of State could give for the detention
of persons in respect of whom deportation orders were made under
article 12(1). It seems clear to me, reading his Judgment in its
proper context, that he was nowhere suggesting that a deportation
order under article 12(1) could be oral, but rather that the
directions for detention under article 12(2) could be. 

 If
there be any doubt whether Pickford LJ was discussing the 

 8 

 deportation
order against Sacksteder under article 12(1) or the directions that
had been given for his arrest and detention under article 12(2), it
is resolved by an examination of the judgment of Warrington and
Scrutton LJJ who were the other members of the court. Warrington LJ
said, [1918] 1 KB at pages 588, 589: 




‘ What
we have to decide is whether the man was in lawful custody... The
question that arises ... is whether the Secretary of State has given
a proper and valid direction pursuant to clause 2 of article 12 of
the Order in Council... I will assume that the direction referred
to in clause 2 of article 12 is the direction by the Secretary of
State himself as to the particular man in question, but on that
assumption I am clearly of opinion that such direction was in fact
given in the present case. The direction that the order be enforced
immediately was given in reference to the case of a specific person. 
The Secretary of State gave that direction knowing it would involve
the application of the general directions which had been previously
given in reference to such cases. It
seems to me, therefore, that there was in this case a direction of
the Secretary of State with reference to this particular man that he
should be arrested or detained .’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 And
at Page 591 Scrutton LJ said: 




‘ The
only question, therefore, in this case is whether this alien has been
treated in any illegal way. An order for deportation has been made
against him, and it is in the form held valid by the Court of Appeal
in R v Home Secretary, ex parte Duke of Chateau Thierry [1917] 1 KB 922. The further question is whether the arrest under
that order was justified.’ 




 In
the result I find myself unable to accede to the submission of
counsel for the respondents that Sacksteder’s case lends any support to his argument that a deportation order under
section 36 of the Act, or any comparable legislation, may be oral. 

 In R v Brixton Prison Governor and the Secretary of State for Home
Affairs, ex parte Pawel Sliwa [1952] 1 KB 169, the deportation order was also in writing. The
dispute was whether it was property worded, having regard to certain
changes that had been made to article 12(1) of the Aliens Restriction
(Consolidation) Order 1916 by article 12 of the Aliens Order 1920. 
The objection that was raised by the applicant was a technical one
based on the content of the written order which had been made in
October 1950. It was held that no special form of order was
provided, and nothing was wrong with the particular phraseology which
had been adopted by the Secretary of State in the written order which
he had made. Here again, I find nothing to support the proposition
that a deportation order may be oral. 

 In
the final analysis, whether a deportation order may be oral or not
turns upon the proper construction of section 36 of the Act. 
Deportation is a serious interference with individual liberty. 
Dependent upon the 

 9 

 circumstances,
it may even result in confinement (in a police station or a prison)
until the deportee can be removed from the jurisdiction. A
deportation order when made must be communicated to the person
concerned so that he may comply with its terms. In the ordinary
course of things, the Minister will leave this communication to his
departmental civil servants. They in turn may find it necessary to
pass the content of the order on to a chain of other officials to
ensure that it is enforced. It would be strange indeed if in a
matter of such gravity Parliament intended that the ascertainment of
the precise nature of the Minister’s order should depend upon the
frailties of human recollection and the dangers inherent in the
transmission of the spoken word. 

 It
may be observed that section 36 of the Act does not empower the
Minister “to direct” that a particular person be deported. Nor
does it say that he “may give an order” that a person be
deported. To the contrary, the precise words are: 




‘ The
Minister may make an order requiring such person to leave the Colony
within the time fixed by the deportation order and thereafter remain
out of the Colony.’ 




 To
my mind this language points clearly to an order in writing. This
view is reinforced by the provisions of section 36(2) which stipulate
that when a deportation order is made in respect of a person who was
lawfully in the colony immediately before the order was made “a
copy of the order shall be served upon him”, so that he may appeal
against it if he so wishes. It would be a contradiction in terms for
Parliament to speak of a copy of an oral order. And I do not think
that the legislature intended to leave it to the discretion of the
Minister to make written deportation orders in cases where there was
a right of appeal and oral orders in cases where there was no such
right. I have therefore come to the conclusion that section 36 of
the Act does not contemplate nor authorise the making of oral orders
for deportation as has been suggested, and that no valid deportation
order was in existence prior to the arrest of the applicants on 10th
February 1981. 

 Were
the Applicants in Lawful Custody between 10th and 13th February? 

 The
existence of a valid deportation order is a condition precedent to
the right to place the deportee on the ship or aircraft selected for
his passage under section 37(1) of the Act, as well as of the power
to detain him under section 37(4) pending his departure. 

 If
I am right in holding that a valid order for deportation must be in
writing, and cannot be oral, it follows that the applicants were
unlawfully detained on 10th February 1981 and remained under
unauthorised restraint until 13th February 1981 when the Minister
signed the order of that date. I am satisfied, however, that
although the applicants may have some civil remedy, their subsequent
detention may be justified if the order of 13th February 1981 is in
law a good order for deportation and detention pending their removal
from The Bahamas. 

 10 

 The
Validity of the Written Order of 13th February 1981 

 Counsel
for the applicants has attacked this order on three main grounds. 
First, he says that that part of it which sanctions deportation is
bad on its face because it is an omnibus order for the deportation of
280 Haitians, and such an order is not contemplated by section 36 of
the Act. Secondly, he submits that deportation has been ordered on
the ground that the persons concerned have landed in The Bahamas
contrary to the provisions of the Act. This he argues is a condition
precedent to a good order, and the burden is upon the respondents to
establish that the applicants in fact landed in The Bahamas in breach
of the provisions of the Act. 

 His
third submission deals with the second part of the order which
concerns arrest and detention pending removal from The Bahamas. As I
understand it, the contention is that an examination of the order
indicates that the Minister purported to exercise the powers of
arrest and detention in his own right as Minister, when those powers
are vested by section 37(4) in the Governor-General. Alternatively,
it is argued that, if in fact the Minister attempted to signify by
his signature to the order that the Governor-General had exercised
the powers in question, the signification is a nullity since there is
no evidence to show that the Governor-General had designated the
Minister so to do within the meaning of section 60(1) of the
Interpretation and General Clauses Act 1976. Section 60(1) reads as
follows: 




‘ Where
any Act confers a power or imposes a duty upon the Governor-General
to make any subsidiary legislation or appointment, give any
directions, issue any order, authorise anything or matter to be done,
grant any exemption, remit any fee or penalty, or exercise any other
power or perform any other duty, the exercise of such power or the
performance of such duty may be signified under the hand of a
Minister or Such officer as the Governor-General may, acting in his
discretion, designate.’ 




 I
find no merit in the first submission. An examination of the order
shows that the Minister has addressed his mind to the status in The
Bahamas of the 280 Haitian nationals who are described by reference
to their names, dates of birth, and places of birth in a list which
is attached to the order itself and expressly made part of it. The
circumstances of each such individual must therefore be taken to have
been considered by the Minister. There is no legal reason why the
Minister should be compelled to make 280 separate orders instead of
making an omnibus order in the form in which he did. A similar point
arose in Stuart v Anderson and Morrison [1941] 2 All ER 665. There an order was made under regulation 18B of
the Defence (General) Regulations 1939 for the detention of more than
350 persons whose names appeared in a schedule to the order. It was
objected that the order was on its face a general order made against
more than 350 persons and not directed to the particular 

 11 

 case
of the plaintiff. Tucker J held that the order was not invalid by
reason of the fact that it ordered the detention of a number of
persons. At page 669, he said: 




‘ As
I am unable to find anything in the Regulations requiring the order
to be in any particular form, I find it quite impossible to say that,
because the order applies to a number of people whose names are set
out in the schedule, that must make the order bad on the face of it. 
I reject that contention.’ 




 For
my part, I adopt the reasoning of Tucker J and hold that the instant
deportation order is not bad because it applies to 280 Haitians whose
names are set out in the list attached to it. 

 I
pass then to the second submission of counsel for the applicants, viz
that the burden is on the respondents to establish that the parties
landed in The Bahamas contrary to the Act, this being a condition
precedent to the making of a good order for deportation. Reliance
was placed in the main on three authorities: (i) Cedeno
v O’Brien (1964) 7 WIR 192, (ii) Eshugbayi
Eleko v Nigeria Government (officer administering) [1931] AC 663, and (iii) R
v Brixton Prison Governor ex parte Ahsan [1969] 2 QB 222. On the other hand, counsel for the respondents
relied heavily on the decision of the House of Lords in Greene v Home Secretary [1941] 3 All ER 388. 

 If
I do not refer to the Cedeno case, this is not out of disrespect for the erudition of that
distinguished jurist, the late Sir Hugh Wooding formerly Chief
justice of Trinidad and Tobago, who delivered the judgment of the
Trinidad Court of Appeal in that matter. It is because Cedeno’s case deals with the burden of proof of a condition precedent to a
right to arrest in a civil suit for damages for assault and false
imprisonment, whereas what I am concerned with here is the burden of
proof in habeas corpus proceedings in which the respondents rely on
the content of what they maintain is all order for deportation valid
on its face. It seems to me that a sharp distinction needs to be
drawn between the two situations because in habeas corpus proceedings
a court’s power to go into the evidence to determine whether a
condition precedent has been established may be limited dependent
upon the provisions of the particular Habeas Corpus Act which
constitutes the genesis of the proceedings themselves. 

 Accordingly
before considering the authorities to which I have just referred, it
is important to examine the Habeas Corpus Act of The Bahamas. That
statute was enacted in 1679. It is for all practical purposes
identical with the Habeas Corpus Act of the United Kingdom of the
same year, enacted in the reign of Charles II. It still retains its
state of pristine purity. In the 302 years which have since elapsed,
it has yielded neither to the change of time, nor circumstance. In
contradistinction, the history of the Habeas Corpus Act in England
has been entirely different. In that country as a result of
agitation as to the deficiencies of the 1679 Act, Parliament passed
the Habeas Corpus Act 1816. The effect of the 

 12 

 1816
Act, as Lord Parker CJ pointed out in R v Brixton Prison Governor [1969] 2 QB 222, was to give the Court specific power in a civil
matter to enquire into the facts. The 1816 Act, he said, dealt only
with writs of habeas corpus in cases other than a criminal matter, or
for debt, or civil process. Section 3 specifically provides that: 




‘ In
all cases provided for by this Act, although the return to any writ
of habeas corpus shall be good and sufficient in law, it shall be
lawful for the justice or baron, before whom such writ may be
returnable, to proceed to examine into the truth of the facts set
forth in such return by affidavit or by affirmation ...’ 




 Section
4 provides: 




‘ The
like proceedings may be had in the court for controverting the truth
of the return to any such writ of habeas corpus awarded as aforesaid,
although such writ shall be awarded by the said court itself, or be
returnable therein.’ 




 The
provisions of the Habeas Corpus Act 1816 enabled the courts in
England for the first time to go behind the return to the writ and
make a full enquiry into the facts stated in it. This new situation
inevitably gave rise to questions as to where the burden of proof lay
where, on the return, an order or warrant valid on its face was
produced to justify the arrest and imprisonment. Was it for the
applicant to disprove the facts stated in the return, or was it for
the gaoler or responsible officer to prove that the conditions
precedent for the exercise of the authority existed? 

 Greene
v Home Secretary [1941] 3 All ER 388 and R v Brixton Prison Governor [1969] 2 QB 222 are classic examples of this situation. When Greene’s case went to the House of Lords, Viscount Maugham specifically
approved the view expressed by Goddard LJ in the Court of Appeal to
the effect that where on the return an order or warrant valid on its
face is produced, it is for the prisoner to prove the facts necessary
to controvert it. R
v Brixton Prison Governor went the other way. There a Divisional Court comprising Lord Parker
CJ and Blain and Ashworth JJ held by a majority that Greene’s case had been decided on its special facts and that it could be
distinguished from a case in which there had been a specific
challenge to the validity of an order for detention on the ground
that the conditions precedent had not been satisfied. Reliance was
placed on the reasoning of Lord Atkin in Eshugbayi Eleko v Nigeria Government [1931] AC 662. In the result it was held that, although certain
notices on which the respondents relied were ex facie valid, the onus was on the executive to negative the challenge and
prove beyond reasonable doubt that the conditions precedent to their
validity had been performed. 

 As
to Eshugbayi Eleko’s case, it is sufficient to observe that counsel for the respondents
conceded in the course of his argument that the conditions which had
to be satisfied to make the order for the deportation of the
appellant valid, were cognisable by the courts. It may 

 13 

 be
that this concession was made because the statute law of Nigeria
contained provisions analogous to those of the Habeas Corpus Act 1816
of the United Kingdom. However that may be, the fact remains that it
was never suggested that there was any legal impediment which stood
in the way of all investigation of the facts by the courts. 

 In
my judgment, in so far as burden of proof of the facts stated in a
return are concerned, none of these decisions after 1816 is relevant
to the applications which are before me. In The Bahamas, marching as
we are at a respectful distance behind the United Kingdom in this
branch of the law, it is necessary to look at the legal position of
an applicant before 1816 when he sought a writ of habeas corpus, and
a return good on its face was made to justify the imprisonment. The
position of such a person was succinctly stated by Lord Goddard CJ in R v Board of Control, ex parte Rutty [1956] 2 QB 109. At page 124, he said: 




‘ That
this court has power to examine into the truth of the facts set forth
in the return to a writ of habeas corpus and to examine them by means
of affidavit evidence is clear from sections 3 and 4 of the Habeas
Corpus Act 1816. That Act effected a notable change in the law. 
Previously neither at common law nor by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679
could the court do more than look at the return and decide whether on
its face it showed a lawful cause of detention. The facts could only
be controverted by an action for a false return. The reason for this
is made clear by the opinion of Wilmot CJ delivered before the House
of Lords in 1758, which will be found in the volume in which the
opinions of that great and most learned judge are collected entitled Wilmot’s Notes of Opinions .
 It was because questions of fact were involved and it was only a
jury that could decide them.’ 




 The
matter was further elaborated on by Viscount Maugham in Greene v Home Secretary [1941] 3 All ER 388 at pages 392, 393. Viscount Maugham said: 




‘ Those
who desire to understand the history and practice in relation to the
writ of habeas corpus prior to the Act of 1816 must study the very
learned and elaborate opinion on the writ of habeas corpus delivered
by Wilmot CJ on 9th May 1758, to the House of Lords ( Opinions
and Judgements delivered by Sir John Eardley Wilmot ,
1802, pages 77-129). The tenth question was as to whether the judges
were bound by the facts set forth in the return ‘... although it
should appear most manifestly to the judges by the clearest and most
undoubted proof that such return was false in fact.’ 

 In
his opinion, Wilmot CJ dealt first with the cases of imprisonment for
criminal offences and next with imprisonment in civil matters. In
the former cases, he points out, it is impossible to go out of the
return if the court who dealt with the case had jurisdiction in the
matter, and the court on habeas corpus must accept the facts stated
in it as true. He observes in very simple and apposite language, at
page 

 14 

 107:
‘The court says [to the gaoler] ‘Tell the reason why you confine
him’. The court will determine whether it is a good or bad reason;
but not whether it is a true or a false one. The judges are not
competent to this enquiry; it is not their province, but the province
of a jury, to determine it: ad
questionem juris, non facti judices respondent’ . 

 He
adds, at page 107: ‘... the writ is not framed or adapted to
litigating facts: it is a summary short way of taking the opinion of
the court upon a matter of law where the facts are disclosed and
admitted; it puts the case exactly in the same situation as if an
action of false imprisonment had been brought, and the defendant had
set forth a series of facts to justify the imprisonment, and the
plaintiff had demurred to the plea’. 

 Later
he says, at page 112: ‘I find no authority which warrants a
difference between returns, when filed to writs of habeas corpus in
cases of private custody, and of public custody, where the facts
justifying the imprisonment have been set forth; that is where there
has been a full, complete, sufficient return’. 

 He
then goes through the various cases which justified his view and
showed that a return good on its face and with no affidavit in
support of it could not be disputed on the application for the writ. 
The return he said, at page 127, was ‘sacred’, and could not be
touched but by consent.’ 




 It
is quite clear to me that in the state of the law which now prevails
in The Bahamas, there is no burden on the respondents to prove the
facts necessary to make the deportation part of the order of 13th
February 1981 a good order. The order states quite plainly that the
applicants are ordered deported under section 36, because it has come
to the knowledge of the Minister that they landed in The Bahamas
contrary to the provisions of the Act. That is a lawful cause for
deportation. The existence of an order is of course a condition
precedent to detention under section 37(4). But the applicants
cannot in these proceedings controvert the facts which are stated to
justify the deportation. If they call, they must do so by an action
for a false return. Accordingly, the second submission of counsel
for the applicants (i e that the burden is upon the respondents to
adduce evidence to show that the applicants in fact landed contrary
to the provisions of the Act) fails. I hold that the order of 13th
February 1981 includes a good and valid order for deportation. 

 I
turn then to the question of whether the order is good on its face,
in so far as it purports to authorise the detention of the applicants
until such time as they call be placed on board a ship or aircraft
about to leave The Bahamas. The order states in relevant part: 




‘ Now
therefore in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Minister of
Labour and Home Affairs by sections 36 and 37 of the Immigration Act
it is hereby ordered that the said two hundred and eighty (280)
Haitian nationals as described on the attached list shall 

 15 

 leave
the Bahama Islands immediately from the date hereof and thereafter
remain out of the Bahama Islands. And any police or immigration
officer may under the authority of the Minister of Labour and Home
Affairs hereby conferred arrest and detain the said two hundred and
eighty (280) Haitian nationals as described in the attached list in
custody until such time as under the authority of the Minister of
Labour and Home Affairs the said two hundred and eighty (280) Haitian
nationals as described in the attached list can be placed upon a ship
or aircraft about to leave the Bahama Islands. 

 Clement
T Maynard , 

 Minister
of Labour and Home Affairs.’ 




 It
will be recalled that counsel for the applicants contends that the
power to detain under section 37(4) of the Act is in the
Governor-General, and that the order is bad on its face because the
language used by the Minister indicates that he purports to exercise
those powers in his own right as Minister. In response to this,
counsel for the respondents advanced submissions in the alternative. 
I shall deal first with the main limb of his argument. It was to the
effect that once a deportation order has been made under section 36,
any immigration officer who had knowledge of its existence was
entitled under section 37(1) of the Act to seize the deportee and
place him on board any ship or aircraft that was about to leave The
Bahamas, and no exercise of intermediate discretion by anyone was
required to authorise such arrest and seizure. 

 Similarly,
it was submitted that, once an immigration officer knew of the
existence of a deportation order, he was entitled in like
circumstances to detain the deportee under section 37(4) until he
could be placed on board the ship or aircraft. On this premise it
was submitted that the phrase “under the authority of the
Governor-General” in section 37(1) and (4), conferred no power or
discretion on the Governor-General to authorise anything, but was
introduced solely to validate and make lawful the exercise by the
immigration officer of powers that flowed directly from the very fact
that a deportation order has been made. Consequently, it was said,
the words “under the authority of the Governor-General” in
section 37(1) and (4) were to be construed as synonymous with “under
the authority of the Crown or of the State, or of the Executive”. 
Of course if counsel is right, it was not necessary for the Minister
to make any order at all for detention, and counsel has been driven
to concede that this is so. 

 It
seems to me that there are three basic flaws in this argument. In
the first place, it overlooks the fact that subsections (1) and (4)
of section 37 are independent of section 36. It by no means follows
that once a deportation order has been made, the powers under section
37(1) and (4) automatically become operative. The deportee may be
left at large to comply with the terms of the deportation order, or
he may not. Hence the use of the phrase “may be placed on board
any ship or aircraft” in section 37(1), and “may be detained
until he is dealt with under 

 16 

 subsection
(1)” in section 37(4). These words clearly point to the exercise
of a discretion by someone. There is support for these views in the
judgment of Swinfen Eady LJ in R v Home Secretary, ex parte Duke of Chateau Thierry [1916-17] All ER Rep 523 at page 526. 

 In
the second place the construction contended for would render the
words “under the authority of the Governor-General” in section
37(1) and (4), otiose and a parliamentary excursion into the domain
of superfluity. If the legislature intended to authorise and make
lawful the acts of immigration officers in placing deportees on board
vessels or aircraft about to leave The Bahamas, and detaining them
until they could be so dealt with once a deportation order has been
made, it would have been totally unnecessary to introduce the phrase
“under the authority of the Governor-General” in section 37(1)
and (4) to validate those acts. All that it would have been
necessary to say in section 37(1) was that “any person in whose
case a deportation order has been made may be placed by in
immigration officer on board any ship or aircraft”, etc and in
section 37(4) “any person in whose case a deportation order has
been made may be detained by all immigration officer until he is
dealt with under Subsection (1) of this section”. Nothing more
would be needed to make such acts by immigration officers lawful. 

 In
the third place, the interpretation pressed upon me necessarily
involves reading the phrase “under the authority of the
Governor-General” as meaning “under the authority of all
immigration officer” or, alternatively, striking out the words
“under the authority of the Governor-General”, and substituting
for them “under the authority of an immigration officer”. I know
of no principle of construction which would entitle a court to do
such violence to the language of a statute or any other written
instrument. 

 I
entertain not the slightest doubt that section 37(1) and (4) mean
exactly what they say. They confer upon the Governor-General the
power to: (a) authorise that a deportee be placed on board a ship or
aircraft about to leave The Bahamas (this involves the selection of
the ship or aircraft for the deportee’s departure); and (b) detain
a deportee pending his departure, if in his judgment it is a proper
case so to do. Under the Constitution those powers have (of course)
to be exercised on the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister. 

 In
the result, I am unable to construe section 37(1) and (4) of the Act
in the manner suggested by counsel for the respondents. To do so
would be to ignore the plain meaning of the words used by the
legislature, and invest immigration officers with wide powers and
discretions which the language of the Act makes clear it was never
intended to confer upon them. 

 The
second limb of the argument of counsel for the respondents was based
upon section 4 of the Bahamas Independence Order 1973, and articles
71, 79(1) and 79(6) of the Constitution of The Bahamas. It was
submitted that if the power to authorise detention under section
37(4) of the Act was in the Governor-General, the Minister was
entitled by 

 17 

 article
71(2) to exercise that power since the Minister is an officer
subordinate to the Governor-General within the meaning of article
71(2); alternatively, if he was not, the exercise of the power was
the exercise of executive authority by virtue of article 79(6), and
the Governor-General was bound to exercise it in accordance with the
advice of the Minister. It was accordingly contended that the
conjoint effect of article 79(1) and (6) of the Constitution was to
give the Minister the power to order detention under section 37(4) of
the Act. In the further alternative it was submitted, and here I
quote the ipsissima verba of the submission: 




‘ A
close reading of the order made by the Minister shows that the
Minister is saying that he has under the lawful provisions vested in
him, an authority conferred on him by virtue of the deportation order
and has advised the Governor-General that the particular deportation
orders ought to be further enforced by the immediate detention of the
deportees.’ 




 I
do not appreciate the relevance of section 4 of the Bahamas
Independence Order to the argument, but I concede at once that in the
exercise of executive authority under the Constitution or any other
law, the Governor-General is bound ultimately to act on the advice of
the Cabinet, or a Minister. I part company, however, with counsel
for the respondents when he submits that, wherever a law provides
that the Governor-General has power to exercise the executive
authority, article 71(2) operates so as to enable the Minister to
exercise that authority off his own bat, so to speak. And the
distance between us grows even greater when he further submits that
because the Governor-General is bound to act on the Minister’s
advice, that means that the Minister has the legal authority to
exercise the powers which a statute says are vested in the
Governor-General. The entire argument is predicated upon the
hypothesis that the Governor-General is no more than a constitutional
cipher. Indeed this was underscored in the course of the hearing
when, on 20th March, I had occasion to ask counsel for the
respondents whether the Governor-General was not entitled as a matter
of constitutional right to counsel a Minister against advising that
the executive authority be exercised in the particular manner
recommended or at all. Counsel’s reply was most revealing. It
was, and again I quote: 




‘ The
Governor-General has no such constitutional right. He cannot dissent
when a Minister advises him. If he is allowed to do so, that is a
concession granted him by the Minister.’ 




 I
disagree. In that regard, I think the correct view is expressed by J
M Finnis, LLB, D Phil, of Gray’s Inn, barrister and Rhodes Reader
in the Laws of the British Commonwealth and the United States of
America, University of Oxford, who contributed the title
“Commonwealth and Dependencies” to 6
Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th Edn). At paragraph 825 (page 340), dealing with the
constitutional authority of Governors-General, 

 18 

 and
their relations with Ministers in independent Commonwealth countries
he says: 




‘ Since
the Governor-General occupies in relation to his Ministers
essentially the same constitutional position as the Queen occupies in
relation to her United Kingdom Ministers, he is entitled to be
supplied by them with sufficient information to enable him to exercise his recognised advisory, mediatory and
residual discretionary functions .’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 This
advisory and mediatory function is nowhere expressly formulated in
the Constitution of The Bahamas, but it is clearly assumed in article
80 which requires the Prime Minister to keep the Governor-General
informed concerning the Government of The Bahamas, and further
requires the Prime Minister, in mandatory language, to furnish the
Governor-General “with such information as he may request with
respect to any particular matter relating to the Government of The
Bahamas”. It is clear to my mind that this article has been
inserted in recognition of the Governor-General’s advisory and
mediatory role. 

 In
the interpretation of written constitutions, it is always possible to
concentrate on legalism to the exclusion of their invigorating
spirit. Nowhere is this more dangerous than in interpreting the role
of the Governor-General in the operation of the machinery of
Government. Any interpretation of that role which equates the
authority of the Governor-General with that of a rubber stamp is
erroneous; and even more erroneous is an interpretation which denies
the very existence of his advisory function. Once the existence of
that important function is negated, the bureaucratic usurpation of
the Governor-General’s authority to do something under law becomes
but a short step away. 

 In
my judgment, the fact that the Governor-General’s
constitutionally-recognised advisory functions are interposed between
the tendering of ministerial advice and the ultimate exercise of the
executive authority, makes it manifestly untenable to argue that
since in the final analysis the Governor-General is bound to act on
the Minister’s advice, the Minister can exercise the
Governor-General’s powers, or the Governor-General’s powers
become vested in the Minister. The fact is that the Governor-General
is entitled to counsel against what the Minister proposes. As a
result the Minister may change his mind and take a different course
or adopt the Governor-General’s advice. Surely it must be
illogical to say that if A has powers which he is obliged to exercise
on B’s advice, that means that B has the powers that A has, or that
A’s powers have been transferred to or can be exercised by B. 

 In
so far as the argument based on article 71(2) of the Constitution is
concerned, it is sufficient to say that in my judgment, it cannot be
taken out of its proper context, and utilised to support the
proposition that it authorises the Minister to exercise the
Governor-General’s powers under section 37(4) of the Act, or any
other statute. Nor is it correct to say, as has been submitted, that
the effect of article 71(2) is that if the 

 19 

 Minister
exercises the executive authority it is deemed to have been exercised
by the Governor-General. If one applies the reasoning reductio ad absurdum to this argument, it means that any person in the hierarchy of
Government who is subordinate to the Governor-General, from the
Minister, to the messenger, has a licence to exercise the executive
authority and that authority, when exercised, would be deemed to have
been exercised by the Governor-General. Article 71(2), in my view,
presupposes that the executive authority is to be exercised according
to law. It reads: 




‘ Subject
to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive authority of
The Bahamas may be exercised on behalf of Her Majesty by the
Governor-General, either directly or through officers subordinate to
him.’ 




 It
must therefore be read as subject to article 79(1) and (6), which
expressly provide that, when powers are conferred on the
Governor-General by the Constitution or any other law, those powers
fall to be exercised by the Governor-General in accordance with the
advice of the Cabinet or a Minister. In fact, in relation to powers
exercisable by the Governor under a pre-Independence statute, such as
the Immigration Act 1967, the matter is put beyond doubt by section
4(2) of the Existing Laws Amendment Order 1974, made under section
4(3) of The Bahamas Independence Order 1973. Section 4(3) provides
that: 




‘ When
immediately before the commencement of this Order, a function was
under an existing law expressed to be exercisable by the Governor,
such function shall be exercisable by the Governor-General acting in
accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting
under the general authority of the Cabinet.’ 




 As
to the Submission that a close reading of the order of 13th February
1981 shows that the Minister is saying that he has advised the
Governor-General that the particular deportation orders ought to be
enforced by the immediate detention of the deportees, I have searched
in vain to find anything in that document which remotely suggests
that the Minister is saying any such thing. In fact, the words
“Governor-General” nowhere appear on the face of the order, save
where it can be seen that it has been struck out, and the mention of
any advice to him is conspicuous by its absence. It is therefore
unnecessary for me to consider section 60 of the Interpretation and
General Clauses Act 1976 as there is nothing in the order which shows
that, when the Minister signed it, he was signifying the exercise by
the Governor-General of the Governor-General’s powers under section
37(4) of the Act. Section 81 of the Evidence Act cannot be prayed in
aid to give validity to an act which an official has done in
purported exercise of a power which in law does not inhere in him. 
At a later stage of this judgment 1 will state shortly what in my
opinion is the plain meaning of the words which are contained in the
document of 13th February 1981. Until then, I hold that 

 20 

 for
the reasons I have just stated I am unable to accept the submissions
which counsel for the respondents has made based on The Bahamas
Independence Order and articles 71 and 79 of the Constitution, to
support the validity of the detention order. 

 All
the authorities go to show that when drastic powers are given to
interfere with personal liberty, there must be the strictest
compliance with the letter of the law, be the person affected a
subject by birth or naturalisation, or a stranger within the gates. 
Thus in Musson v Rodriguez [1953] AC 530, where the appellant had been ordered to be removed
from Trinidad and Tobago and was detained in custody meanwhile
pursuant to a decision of the Governor-in-Council that he was an
undesirable inhabitant, Lord Normand, delivering the judgment of the
judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said at page 533: 




‘ The
drastic power given to the Governor-in-Council ... to interfere with
personal liberty may be exercised without any antecedent judicial
enquiry, and without the persons who are affected having had any
opportunity of making representations. It is not subject to any
appeal to a court of law or to any form of review at the instance of
the affected persons. When
such a power is committed to the Governor-in-Council there must be
the strictest compliance with the provisions by which it is granted .’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 Under
the Act, once a valid deportation order is in existence, the power to
detain under section 37(4) can be exercised without any antecedent
judicial enquiry and there is no right of appeal, save in the limited
cases mentioned in section 36(2). 

 In Greene v Home Secretary [1941] All ER 388 at page 403, Lord Wright deals with a number of
circumstances in which a warrant or order has been held bad on its
face in habeas corpus proceedings and the legal consequences that
flow from errors in the order or warrant. He says: 




‘ It
would be superfluous to point out that the basis of the conclusion
here adopted is that the order and statement are good on their face -
that is, that they show a competent exercise of a lawful authority. 
If an order or warrant is bad on its face, it can give no legal
justification for the imprisonment. Thus, in Bushell’s case (1670) Vaugh 135 a commitment which showed that it was to Punish
persons for giving a verdict of which the court did not approve, and
which was said to be contra plenam et manifestam evidentiam et contra directionam curiae
in materia legis ,
was held to be bad as showing a cause which was not lawful. It was
pithily observed that the writ of habeas corpus was then (1670) the
most usual remedy by which a man might be restored again to his
liberty, if he had been against law deprived of it. Similarly, in R v Browne, Corbet, etc (1686) 2 Show 484, a warrant was held to be bad on its face because
the warrant was under the King’s own hand, without seal or the hand
of any secretary or officer of state or justice. In the same way,
where the return consists of a narrative of facts, it 

 21 

 will
be bad if the facts stated do not show a legal cause for the
detention, as in R v Jackson [1891] 1 QB 671.’ 




 When
the order of 13th February 1981 is carefully examined, it will be
seen that the form that was used was the old form which had been in
use prior to 1974, when the powers to deport under section 36, and to
place on board the ship or aircraft and detain pending departure
under section 37(1) and (4), were all vested in the Governor-General.
 The Minister is not a lawyer, and whoever it was who prepared the
order for his signature overlooked the fact that the 1974 amendment
to the Act took away the power to make the deportation order from the
Governor-General and vested it in the Minister, but left the powers
under section 37(1) and (4) where they always had been, viz in the
Governor-General. On the assumption that all of the powers under
sections 36 and 37 were now in the Minister, that person simply
struck out the words “Governor-General” in the four places in
which they appeared in the old form, and substituted for them
“Minister of Labour and Home Affairs”. That was all unfortunate
error. The result is that on its face the order now states that the
applicants are being detained under the authority of the Minister of
Labour and Home Affairs in the exercise of powers conferred upon him
by section 37 of the Act. As I have endeavoured to show the Minister
does not have any such power. That power belongs in law to the
Governor-General. In the light of the authorities, I have no
alternative but to hold that as a consequence, the order for
detention contained in the document dated 13th February 1981 is bad
on its face. 

 In
the result, it is with a degree of reluctance that I feel obliged to
exercise my discretion under Order 54, rule 4, of the Rules of the
Supreme Court 1978 and order that Reno Jean, Michel Dauphin and Sede
Decade be released. When it became clear from the affidavits filed
by the respondents that all the Haitians now detained, were detained
under all omnibus order and for identical reasons, no application was
made to me to join as parties all the others whose names appear on
the list attached to the deportation and detention order. Counsel
have reached no agreement to treat the decision on the three
applications now before me as decisive of the position of the other
detainees, and, consequently, I am not here concerned with them. The
reluctance that I feel in making this order is dictated by the
circumstances. Whilst I sympathise with the applicants who have fled
their country for a better life in The Bahamas, the fact remains that
they have no right to be here. They have come clandestinely to these
shores and are part of a burgeoning population of illegal immigrants.
 They constitute a serious drain upon the limited resources of The
Bahamas in many fields, particularly the social services which are
already stretched to the limit to cater for the needs of citizens,
and permanent residents, and those who are otherwise entitled to be
here. The Consul-General for the Republic of Haiti estimates that at
the present time the number of illegal immigrants in The Bahamas is
of the order of 7000 to 10,000. The 

 22 

 Government
apparently puts the figure at between 20,000 and 40,000. None of
these applicants has come forward to claim that he has any legal
right whatever to be in The Bahamas. The Minister was perfectly
justified and entitled to set about having them deported and removed
from the jurisdiction. It is their good fortune that there has been
a slip of some substance in the wording of the order under which they
have been detained, and that that slip has occurred in a country
whose laws pay more regard to personal liberty than the laws of their
own land appear to do. But unmeritorious as the applications are, I
have come to the conclusion that I would be making bad law to refuse
them. It may well be that the result of this case will prove to be
no more than a Pyrrhic victory for the applicants, because there is
nothing to prevent the Government if it so wishes, from taking steps
to do what is necessary to ensure that they be now properly detained
until they can be removed from The Bahamas. 

 The
applications are allowed and the applicants are ordered to be
released. The applicants are to have their costs from the
respondents to be agreed, or failing agreement to be taxed. It
remains only to add that in the light of my findings, the
applications fall to be treated as arising on the civil side of the
court’s Jurisdiction, and not the criminal, as they were originally
entitled. 

 Applications
granted with costs.

– Notice to furnish information – Form of notice – Whether

12(4) 

 A
notice under the Prevention of Bribery Act 1976, section 12(1)( d ),
does not have to be in any specified form; the only conditions
precedent to its issue are that the Attorney-General should be
satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that all
offence under the Act has been committed and that he is investigating
it. 

 The
immunity of Senators and Members of the House of Assembly from civil
and criminal proceedings in respect of words spoken in the Senate or
the House provided by the Powers and Privileges (Senate and House of
Assembly) Act 1969, section 4, is only available where the essential
gist of the civil or criminal proceedings is words spoken in
Parliament, or things brought by petition, motion or otherwise. 
Hence section 4 does not provide immunity for a Member of the House
from proceedings for all order of the court requiring him to furnish
information under the Prevention of Bribery Act 1976, section 12(4),
even though the order may be based on a notice which was occasioned
by things said in Parliament. 

 Per
Blake CJ .
 The court has powers under the Prevention of Bribery Act 1976,
sections 11(3) and 12(4) (i e orders for the production etc of
documents), which derogate from or curtail a variety of common law
rights and privileges. Nothing in the Act warrants a construction
that the phrase “any other person” in section 12(1)( d )
excludes Members of Parliament.

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Blake
CJ. At the conclusion of the submissions of counsel in this case on 18th
February 1982, I was requested by the parties, in view of the urgency
of the matter, to let them know my decision at the earliest possible
time. It was agreed that the reasons for the decision, whatever it
might be, would be reduced to writing at a subsequent date. 
Accordingly, on 23rd February 1982, I made an order under section
12(4) of the Prevention of Bribery Act, requiring the defendant to
comply forthwith with the terms of a notice which had been served on
him by the Attorney-General on 3rd February 1982, in exercise of the
powers vested in the Attorney-General by section 12(1)( d )
of the Act. I now put my reasons for making that order in writing. 
Hereafter I shall refer to the Powers and Privileges (Senate and
House of Assembly) Act 1969 as “the Powers and Privileges Act”,
and to the Prevention of Bribery Act 1976 as “the Bribery Act”. 

 The
defendant is, and was at all material times, a member of the House of
Assembly of The Bahamas and the Member of Parliament for the
constituency of Marsh Harbour. On 27th January 1982 he moved a
motion in the House for the appointment of a select committee of the
House: 




‘ To
take into consideration all matters pertaining to the peddling or
purported peddling of political influence for personal profit and/or
the misrepresentation as beneficial owners of Bahamian business when
in fact, such ownership is vested in non-Bahamians; with power to
send for persons and papers, with leave to sit from place to place
and with leave to sit during the recess’. 




 25 

 In
the course of his speech he tabled a number of documents and
commented upon their contents. I am here concerned with two only of
those documents. The first purports to be a memorandum of a meeting
which is supposed to have taken place in Manila between 25th and 27th
January 1979, between persons identified only as “E B”, and “A
J L”. This memoradum lists some twenty-six items or matters which
were supposedly discussed between “E B” and “A J L”, at the
meeting. It purports to bear the initials “E B”, and presumably
“A J L”. The second document Which is neither signed, initialled
nor dated is headed “Confidential”. It professes to be
explanatory of some of the matters referred to in the first
memorandum and in some respects enlarges upon them by providing
additional information not spelt out in the first memorandum. 

 Read
together, these two documents suggest, inter alia, that: (i) the
parties to the alleged Manila meeting in January 1979 were one Abe J
Leiber and Everette Bannister; (ii) Leiber is the owner and president
of the Amherst group of companies referred to as “T A G”, which
includes Amherst International Ltd Amherst International is the
holding company of Amford Bank and Trust Co; incidentally, Amford
International and Amford Bank and Trust Co appear to carry on
business in The Bahamas; (iii) Bannister is a senior member of the
National General Council of the Progressive Liberal Party (the
majority political party in The Bahamas House of Assembly and
Senate), and a close personal friend and confidant of the Prime
Minister of The Bahamas; (iv) Bannister was to act as an intermediary
between the Amherst group and the Government of The Bahamas so as to
obtain governmental approval, permits, and other concessions
necessary to facilitate certain business ventures which the Amherst
group contemplated undertaking in The Bahamas; the permits and
concessions included work permits for expatriates who were to be
employed in various of the projects, a licence to operate a casino in
Freeport, Grand Bahama, a commercial banking licence, authority and
permission to erect a convention centre in the Cable Beach area, and
to establish facilities for horse-racing and dog-racing; (v)
Bannister was to arrange for all buildings and vehicles belonging to
the Government to be insured through Amshire Insurance Co, apparently
one of the companies in the Amherst group; (vi) a secret mortgage of
some $600,000 to $650,000 at a nominal rate of interest of 2 per cent
per annum had been given to the Prime Minister on the security of his
home at Skyline Heights in New Providence, to enable him to build a
new house. The money was provided by a Liberian company which is
beneficially owned by Amherst International Ltd; and (vii) an
apartment building belonging to the Hon Darrel Rolle, the then
Minister of Home Affairs whose Ministry was responsible for the issue
of work permits, was to be purchased by the Amherst group for the use
of its employees coming to The Bahamas; by such a purchase Mr Leiber
would ingratiate himself with the Minister. 

 26 

 The
confidential, unsigned and undated explanatory memorandum concludes
as follows: 




‘ Everette
Bannister has been receiving US $1000 per week for over two years
from Amford Bank and Trust. This is paid covertly in cash or by
cheques issued on its clients account, which Everette Bannister
cashes at the casino. He has also received many other cash payments
directly from A J Leiber. In return Everette Bannister has arranged
for several work permits to be given to various persons (most of whom
have now left or been dismissed). Everette Bannister also arranged
for A J Leiber to receive his Permanent resident status although he
has never actually resided in The Bahamas for long periods than a
week or so. In addition Everette Bannister has arranged for A J
Leiber to meet privately with the Prime Minister on several occasions
as well as several other Cabinet Ministers, particularly Mr George
Smith. A J Leiber has made many pay-offs (in cash and gifts) to
officials of the Central Bank, members of the Cabinet and the civil
service although of course this is virtually impossible to prove.’ 




 The
picture thus painted by the defendant’s comments and disclosures in
Parliament, was that Leiber controlled a group of companies which was
desirous of embarking upon large scale business enterprises in The
Bahamas. The implementation of some of those plans required the
blessing and approval of the Government of The Bahamas, and the
granting of approvals, permits and the like by the Government and
other agencies under its control. To that end Leiber had engaged for
reward the services of Bannister who, by reason of his political
connections with the ruling party, had the ear of the Prime Minister
and the ability to arrange meetings with several members of the
Cabinet. A special favour had been granted to the Prime Minister by
way of a covert mortgage, as a consequence of Leiber’s control of
the Liberian company which made the loan. Property belonging to the
Minister of Home Affairs was to be bought by the Amherst group as
part of a scheme to make that Minister disposed to give favourable
consideration to applications by the group for work permits and other
concessions within his power to grant and approve. Bannister had in
fact arranged numerous private meetings with the prime Minister and
many other Ministers of the Cabinet. Work permits had in fact been
granted for the benefit of employees of the Amherst group. Leiber
himself had received permanent resident status in circumstances in
which he was not entitled to it. Members of the Cabinet, officers of
the Central Bank, and civil servants were in Leiber’s pay; and had
from time to time received money and other gifts from him. 

 These
were grave and serious allegations. They were made by an honourable
and ostensibly responsible member of the House of Assembly, based on
information and documents in his possession. Cabinet Ministers,
officers of the Central Bank of The Bahamas and civil 

 27 

 servants,
are public servants within the meaning of the Bribery Act. If any
Cabinet Ministers, officials of the Central Bank or civil servants
received any gift (be it of money or otherwise) or any loan or favour
from Leiber (or any of his companies) as a reward for performing any
act in their respective capacities as such public servants, an
offence under the Bribery Act would have been committed. Such an
offence is punishable on conviction on information by a fine not
exceeding $10,000, or by a term of imprisonment not exceeding four
years, or by both a fine and imprisonment. On summary conviction,
the punishment is a fine not exceeding $5000 or imprisonment for a
term not exceeding two years, or both a fine and imprisonment. 
Leiber, or anyone else who on his behalf offered the gifts, loans or
favours, as an inducement or reward for the performance of any such
acts would be similarly liable. 

 The
revelations made by the defendant were widely publicised in the local
newspapers. They were such as to smear the Cabinet, civil servants
and other officials through whom the executive authority of The
Bahamas is exercised, with corruption. I entertain no doubt that
this was he impression they created in the minds of the ordinary mail
who read the newspaper accounts of what had transpired in the House
of Assembly on 27th January 1982. They constituted reasonable
grounds for suspecting that offences under the Bribery Act had been
committed. 

 At
the close of the debate on the defendant’s motion, the House
appointed a select committee of five members to enquire into the
matters specified. The defendant was named as chairman of the
committee. Notwithstanding the absence of any affidavit evidence on
the point, the following facts were agreed by counsel: (i) the select
committee held a meeting on the day it was appointed, ie 27th January
1982; the meeting was of an informal nature; and (ii) prior to 9th
February 1982, it heard no evidence whatever on any of the matters
falling within its terms of reference. 

 On
3rd February 1982, the Attorney-General served a notice on the
defendant in the following terms: 




‘ Notice
to Furnish Information 

 Whereas
the Attorney-General is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds
for suspecting that an offence or offences have been committed under
the Prevention of Bribery Act 1976: 

 And
whereas the Attorney-General is causing an investigation to be made
under the provisions of section 11 of the said Act into those
suspected offence or offences: 

 And
whereas Section 12(1)( d )
of the Prevention of Bribery Act 1976 provides that the
Attorney-General may by written notice, request to be acquainted with
any facts relevant to such investigation or proceedings to furnish to
him all information in his possession respecting such matters as are
specified in the notice or, as the Attorney-General sees fit, to
appear before the person specified in the notice and to answer orally
on oath or affirmation any questions 

 28 

 relevant
thereto; and, on demand by such other person, to produce or deliver
or otherwise furnish to him the original or a copy of any document in
his possession or under his control which, in the opinion of such
person may be relevant to such investigation or proceedings; for the
purposes of this paragraph such person shall have authority to
administer any oath to take any affirmation: 

 And
whereas the Attorney-General believes that you, Colin Michael
Lightbourn MP, are acquainted with facts relevant to the said
investigation as a result of statements made and documents produced
by you in the House of Assembly on 27th January 1982: 

 Now
therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon the
Attorney-General by the said section 12(1)( d) of
the Prevention of Bribery Act 1976, I, Paul Lawrence Adderley,
Attorney-General, do hereby request you, Colin Michael Lightbourn MP
to furnish to me no later than 5.00 p m on Friday 5th February 1982
all information in your possession including any original documents
which will substantiate, names of persons who have evidence which
will substantiate, all proof in whatever form and every source of any
evidence which will prove the allegation that Abe J Leiber may have
made many pay-offs (in cash and gifts) to officials of the Central
Bank, members of the Cabinet and civil service.’ 




 The
notice was accompanied by a letter of the same date addressed to the
defendant. The Attorney-General pointed out that in view of the
allegations made by the defendant in his speech on 27th January 1982
and the presentation by him of the documents to which reference has
already been made, he considered it his duty to investigate the
matters raised. 

 On
5th February 1982 (the day fixed by the Attorney-General’s notice
for compliance with the request which it contained), the defendant
assured the Attorney-General by letter that he wished to assist him
fully in every possible way in the investigations. He said, however,
that he was worried whether, by so doing, he might expose himself to
penalties under section 25( g )
and ( i )
of the Powers and Privileges Act. He intimated that he had consulted
his attorney on the point, awaited his advice, and would communicate
further with the Attorney-General as soon as he had received it. I
confess that I am unable to appreciate the relevance of Section 25( g )
and ( i )
of the Powers and Privileges Act to the Attorney-General’s request.
 I concede, however, that the provisions of section 25( g )
could conceivably have been a matter of genuine concern to a layman. 
That subsection reads as follows: 




‘ Any
person who ... ( g )
without the permission of the President or Speaker, as the case may
be, publishes outside a committee any evidence taken by, or document
presented to, that committee, where such evidence has been taken
within closed doors, and which has been expressly prohibited by such
chamber or the committee; shall be guilty of an offence and shall be
liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding six hundred
dollars or to imprisonment for a term not 

 29 

 exceeding
six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.’ 




 By
section 33 of the Powers and Privileges Act prosecutions for criminal
offences under that Act cannot be instituted except in pursuance of
the Attorney-General’s fiat .
 The Attorney-General replied to the defendant’s letter of 5th
February 1982, on the same day. He gave the defendant his
unqualified assurance that, by complying with the request contained
in the notice of 3rd February, he would not commit any offence under
the Powers and Privileges Act or any other law, and intimated that he
was not prepared to wait any longer for the defendant to obtain legal
advice. He signified his intention to make an application to the
court on Monday, 8th February 1982, under section 12(4) of the
Bribery Act for an order requiring the defendant to comply with the
terms of the notice of 3rd February 1982. An originating summons was
duly filed by the Attorney-General asking the court to make such an
order. 

 Counsel
for the defendant opposed the application on four broad grounds. 
These, I trust, may be summarised as follows without doing any
injustice to his arguments. (i) The notice of 3rd February 1982 was
invalid and of no effect because it did not specify with sufficient
particularity or at all the particular offences under the Bribery Act
which the Attorney-General was investigating. (ii) Alternatively, if
the notice were valid, civil proceedings by the Attorney-General
seeking to compel the defendant to comply with its terms, constituted
a breach of parliamentary privilege, in particular the right to
freedom of speech in Parliament. (iii) The Bribery Act does not make
it irresistibly clear that it was the intention of the legislature to
authorise the courts to entertain proceedings which involved a
trespass upon the privileges of Parliament or a Member of Parliament,
and to make orders the effect of which would be to infringe those
privileges. That Act should be construed so as to preserve
parliamentary privilege. And (iv), if the Bribery Act authorised the
invasion of parliamentary privilege, the court had a discretion under
section 12(4) and, on the facts and circumstances of the instant
case, that discretion should be exercised against making the order
sought by the Attorney-General. 

 I
proceed to examine these submissions and the authorities cited to
support them. I find no merit in the first submission. A notice
under Section 12(1)( d )
of the Bribery Act is not of the nature of an information or
indictment in criminal proceedings. It does not charge the person to
whom it is addressed with any offences. The Act does not require
that the notice should be in any specified form. The only conditions
precedent to its issue are that the Attorney-General should be
satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an
offence under the Act has been committed and that he is investigating
the matter. In my judgment the disclosures made by the defendant in
Parliament provided reasonable grounds for such suspicion, and the
Attorney-General’s notice states that he is causing an
investigation to be made. The 

 30 

 notice
clearly identifies the matters in respect of which the defendant was
requested to furnish information. It was a good, sufficient and
valid notice in the circumstances. 

 I
turn now to the second submission, viz that civil proceedings to
enforce compliance with the terms of the notice constitute a breach
of parliamentary privilege. It may be convenient to begin by
referring to sections 3 and 4 of the Powers and Privileges Act. 
Section 3 provides that: 




‘ Senators
and Members shall have the like privileges and immunities as are
enjoyed for the time being in the United Kingdom by Members of the
Commons House of Parliament, and, without derogation from the
generality of the privileges and immunities conferred by this
section, in particular shall have such privileges and immunities as
are provided hereafter in this Act.’ 




 Section
4 enacts that: 




‘ No
civil or criminal proceedings may be instituted against any Senator
or Member for words spoken before, or written in a report to, the
Senate or the House respectively or a committee, or by reason of any
matter or thing so brought by him by petition, Bill, motion or
otherwise.’ 




 Section
4 would seem therefore to incorporate the spirit and tenor of section
1 (ninth paragraph) of the Bill of Rights 1688: 




‘ The
freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not
be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.’ 




 [spellings
modified] 

 The
gravamen of Mr Duncombe’s argument was that civil proceedings which
seek to compel a Member of Parliament to disclose information in his
possession to substantiate statements and allegations made by him in
a speech in Parliament, are civil proceedings within the ambit of
section 4 of the Powers and Privileges Act. Such proceedings (he
contended) seek to question or impeach the Members right to freedom
of speech in Parliament, and debates or proceedings in Parliament. I
was referred to Bradlaugh v Gosset [1884] 12 QB 271, Dingle
v Associated Newspapers Ltd [1960] 2 QB 405, British
Railways Board v Pickin [1974] AC 756 and Church of Scientology of California v Johnson-Smith [1972] 1 QB 522 in support of the scope of Parliamentary privilege. 

 In Bradlaugh v Gossett [1884] 12 QB 271 the plaintiff Bradlaugh had been duly elected a
burgess to serve in the House of Commons for Northampton. As such,
he was entitled to take the oath prescribed by the Parliamentary
Oaths Act 1896, for members of the House of Commons, and to sit and
vote in the House as one of the representatives of Northampton. 
Apparently there had been a previous incident in which he was alleged
to have disturbed the proceedings of the House. The Speaker declined
to call him to the table to take the oath, and the House upon motion
resolved that the sergeant-at-arms should exclude him 

 31 

 from
the House until he engaged not to disturb its proceedings further. 
Mr Bradlaugh thereupon brought an action against the sergeant-at-arms
for an injunction restraining him from carrying out the resolution. 
The contention was that the resolution was beyond the power and
jurisdiction of the House to make, and void. It was held that the
House of Commons was not subject to the control of the courts in its
administration of that part of the law which relates to its own
internal procedure. In that context Lord Coleridge CJ stated, 12 QBD
at page 275: 




‘ What
is said or done within the walls of Parliament cannot be enquired
into in a court of law. On this point all the judges in the two
great cases which exhaust the learning on the subject - Burdett
v Abbott ,
14 East 1 148 and Stockdale v Hansard ,
9 Ad&amp;El 1 are agreed, and are emphatic. The jurisdiction of
the Houses over their own Members, their right to impose discipline
within their walls, is absolute and exclusive.’ 




 Stephen
J, at page 279, cited with approval the observations of Lord Denman,
Littledale, Patterson and Coleridge JJ in Stockdale v Hansard [1839] 9 Ad&amp;El 1 to the effect that (i) whatever is done within
the walls of either the House of Lords or the House of Commons must
pass without question in any other place; (ii) the House of Commons
is the sole judge of its own privileges; (iii) the proceedings of
each House of Parliament should be entirely free and unshackled, and
that whatever is said or done in either House should not be liable to
examination elsewhere; and (iv), the House of Commons should have
exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the course of its own proceedings
and animadvert upon any conduct there in violation of its rules or
derogation from its dignity. 

 In Dingle v Associated Newspapers Ltd [1960] 2 QB 405, the principle laid down in Bradlaugh v Gosset was applied. It was held that it was not permissible to impugn in a
court of law the validity of the report of a select committee of the
House of Commons which had been accepted by the House and printed in
the House of Commons’ Journal .
 To do so would be to violate section 1 (ninth paragraph) of the Bill
of Rights 1688, since such a course of action would involve an
enquiry into the propriety of what had been done within the walls of
Parliament. 

 In Church of Scientology v Johnson-Smith [1972] 1 QB 522, the plaintiffs claimed damages for libel against a
Member of Parliament for statements which he had made in a television
broadcast. The television programme followed a written answer by the
Minister of Health to a question which the defendant had asked in the
House of Commons. The defendant pleaded fair comment. The
plaintiffs sought (by paragraphs (ix) and (x) of their reply) to
refute the plea of fair comment by introducing extracts from Hansard of what the defendant had said in Parliament to establish malice. 
Browne J held that what the defendant said or did in the House could
not be examined outside Parliament to 

 32 

 show
that he acted improperly or with an improper motive in Parliament. 
He said, [1972] 1 QB at page 530, that a Member of Parliament - 




‘ must
have a complete right of free speech in the House without any fear
that his motives or intentions or reasoning will be questioned or
held against him thereafter.’ 




 In British Railways Board v Pickin [1974] AC 756, the respondent Pickin attempted to establish that
Parliament had been misled by the fraud of the appellants to pass the
British Railways Act 1968, and in particular section 18, the effect
of which was to vest in the appellants certain lands which he
claimed. He contended that in the circumstances, the section was
ineffective to deprive him of his title to the lands in question. 
The House of Lords held that, in the course of litigation, it was not
lawful to impugn the validity of a statute by seeking to establish
that Parliament in passing it was misled by fraud or otherwise. 
Neither could a litigant seek to establish a claim in equity by
showing that the other party, by fraudulently misleading Parliament,
had inflicted damage on him. Any investigation into the manner in
which Parliament had exercised its functions would or might result in
an adjudication by the courts, bringing about a conflict with
Parliament. 

 The
application which is before me is not concerned with the validity of
the proceedings in the Bahamas House of Assembly on 27th January
1982. There is no challenge by the Attorney-General to the
defendant’s right to have said what he said, nor to his right to
have produced the documents which he produced on that occasion. What
he said is not being examined for the purpose of showing that he has
infringed any right claimed by the Attorney-General, or any one else.
 His motives, intentions and reasoning in the House are not
questioned in this court. That he was entitled to say what he said
and-to do what he did is fully accepted. 

 Mr
Duncombe conceded that in these proceedings the Attorney-General was
not challenging the defendant’s actions in the House. He further
conceded that the Attorney-General was not seeking to use what the
defendant said to advance any cause of action, as in Church of Scientology v Johnson-Smith [1972] 1 QB 522. He submitted, however, that if a Member of
Parliament has the privilege of free speech in Parliament, that
privilege extends to protect from disclosure by him the sources of
the information on the basis of which he speaks in Parliament, even
if the effect of his speech is to suggest that Cabinet Ministers and
public officials have committed grave criminal offences. He was
unable to produce any authority to support this proposition. For my
own part I would find it difficult to believe that if a member of the
United Kingdom House of Commons were to make a speech in the House
suggesting that Cabinet Ministers and other officials had been guilty
of the offence of bribery in the discharge of their duties, the House
would regard it as a breach of privilege if the Director of Public
Prosecutions 

 33 

 were
to demand of that Member all information in his possession to enable
him to investigate, with a view to instituting criminal proceedings,
if necessary. 

 In
my judgment, the immunity conferred by section 4 of the Powers and
Privileges Act on Members of Parliament only arises where the
essential gist of civil or criminal proceedings is words spoken in
Parliament, or things brought by petition, motion or otherwise. That
is not the position on the facts of the case before me. The gist of
the instant proceedings is the defendant’s failure to comply with a
notice served upon him under the Bribery Act. It is true that that
notice has been occasioned by things said and done in Parliament; but
the propriety of the disclosures and speech are in no way challenged
or impugned. They are mere matters of historical background to the
request contained in the notice. 

 It
was never the intention of the Attorney-General’s notice of 3rd
February 1982 that the defendant should reveal information which had
come to his knowledge subsequent to 5th February 1982. The select
committee had not heard any evidence up to that time. They had met
only informally on 27th January 1982. In so far as section 25( g )
of the Powers and Privileges Act is concerned, no evidence was
produced to show that the defendant had up to the date of my order,
testified before the select committee of the House, touching or
concerning the matters specified in the notice. There was no
evidence either that he had produced any document to the committee
relating to those matters. Were he now to be ordered to comply with
the Attorney-General’s notice limiting compliance to the state of
his knowledge and the information in his possession up to and
including 5th February 1982, no question of him committing any
offence under section 25( g )
of the Powers and Privileges Act can arise. It is suggested that,
apart altogether from section 25( g )
of the Powers and Privileges Act, the defendant might possibly be
punished by the House itself for breach of privilege were he to
comply with the request contained in the notice. But, here again,
nothing has been put before me to indicate that such action on his
part would prima facie be regarded by the House as a breach of
privilege. I have been left completely in the dark as to the rules
and practice of the Bahamas House of Assembly in such matters. 

 In
these circumstances the case could be disposed of on the narrow
ground that section 4 of the Powers and Privileges Act is not
relevant to the proceedings before me, and no interference with the
powers of the House in matters relating to its own internal
procedures or its right to discipline its own members has been shown
to be involved. On that basis, the only question that would arise
would be whether I ought to exercise my discretion to make the order
sought by the Attorney-General. 

 I
will assume, however, in the defendant’s favour that he is
protected by section 4 of the Powers and Privileges Act from
disclosing the sources of the information which led him to speak in
Parliament on 27th January 

 34 

 1982,
and that consequently any order compelling him to comply with the
notice of 3rd February 1982 would be a breach of his privilege of
freedom of speech in Parliament. On that hypothesis, the critical
question is whether the Bribery Act is to be construed as abridging
that privilege, or as preserving it. 

 I
was told by counsel for the Attorney-General that The Bahamas Bribery
Act is based on a similar Hong Kong Ordinance enacted prior to 1976. 
No copy of the Hong Kong Ordinance was made available for my perusal
up to the date I made my order (Hong Kong Ordinances are not to be
found in the library of our Supreme Court). No decisions of the
courts of Hong Kong on the interpretation of their Ordinance as it
affects parliamentary privilege have been produced. The reports of
the decisions of those courts are not available here either. I was
further informed that this is the first time that the
Attorney-General’s powers under the local Bribery Act have been
invoked against a Member of Parliament. This, therefore, is the
first occasion on which a court in The Bahamas has been asked to
decide the very important question of whether the Bribery Act
abridges the essential privilege of freedom of speech. 

 Section
2 of the Act defines a “public body” as including the Senate or
the House of Assembly of The Bahamas. Members of the Senate and of
the House of Assembly are public servants within the meaning of the
Act, and as such are liable to prosecution for offences under
sections 3(2) and 4(2) of the statute. 

 Sections
11 and 12 clothe the Attorney-General with wide-ranging powers of
investigation when he has reasonable grounds to suspect that an
offence under the Act has been committed. For example, under section
11(1) he may authorise a police officer of or above the rank of
inspector, or any public servant, to request any person other than
the person suspected of having committed an offence, to produce any
of the suspect’s accounts, books, documents, safe deposit box or
other articles which may be required for the purposes of the
investigation, subject to the suspect’s consent. If the person to
whom the request is addressed declines to comply, either of his own
volition, or because the suspected person has withheld consent, the
Supreme Court may (under section 11(3) on the Attorney-General’s
application) make an order compelling compliance “notwithstanding
the provisions of any other law to the contrary” (my emphasis). In the ordinary course of things, there is no power
at common law in a court to compel persons to produce documents
belonging to a suspected person to enable the Attorney-General to
examine them with a view to determining whether an offence has been
committed. To that extent, therefore, section 11(3) of the Bribery
Act clearly abridges the common law. 

 Section
12(1)( a )
(i) to (iii) enables the Attorney-General to request from the suspect
extensive information concerning his assets: how he came by them, and
when; and, if he has sold any of his property, to whom it has been
sold, and for how much. The right of the suspected 

 35 

 person
to decline to co-operate is not, however, invaded by any provision of
the Act. 

 Section
12(1)( d )
states that, in the course of any investigation into an offence
suspected to have been committed under the Act, the Attorney-General
may by written notice request any person other than the suspect (my
emphasis), whom he believes to be acquainted with any facts relevant
to such investigation, “to furnish him with all information in his
possession respecting such matters as are specified in the notice”.
 There is additional power to request any such person to submit
himself to interrogation by a person authorised to administer oaths
or take affirmations and to answer on oath any questions relevant to
the matters specified in the notice, and to produce documents which
in the opinion of the interrogator are relevant to the investigation. 

 Section
12(1)( e )
and ( f )
empower the Attorney-General by written notice to request: (a) the
person in charge of any public body to produce or furnish to him any
document which is in his possession or under his control; and (b) the
manager of any bank, subject to the suspect’s written consent, to
furnish to him copies of the suspect’s accounts at the bank, or the
accounts of the suspect’s spouse, parents or children. Section
12(4) states that: 




‘ Notwithstanding
the provisions of any other law to the contrary, where any person,
other than the person referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
subsection (1), on whom a notice under subsection (1) is served fails
or neglects, or by reason of the absence of consent required under
subsection (1)( f )
is unable, to comply with the terms of that notice within such time
as may be specified therein or within such further time as the
Attorney-eneral may in his discretion authorise, the Attorney-General
may apply to the Supreme Court for an order directing such person to
comply with the terms of the notice.’ 




 The
classes of persons upon whom notices may be served under section
12(1)( d )
are in no way qualified or restricted by the language of the Bribery
Act. No person, nor class of persons, is exempted. Thus a notice
could be served upon a suspect’s-attorney or on his or her spouse. 
Compliance with such a notice might necessitate revealing the
subject-matter of communications between attorney and client, and
husband and wife during the marriage, both of which are privileged
from disclosure. Notwithstanding this, the court may in the exercise
of its discretion under section 12(4) order the disclosure. 

 As
has already been observed, both the Senate and the House of Assembly
are public bodies within the ambit of the Act. The President is the
person in charge of the Senate. The Speaker is the person in charge
of the House of Assembly. The House of Commons has upon many
occasions declared that the publication of its proceedings without
the authority of the House is a breach of privilege, and it may
prohibit the publication of its proceedings. One of the incidents of
that privilege is the power to prevent the publication of evidence
taken by a select 

 36 

 committee
before it has been reported to the House, or the publication of
proceedings of committees conducted with closed doors. That power is
exercised in The Bahamas by the Speaker of the House, or the
President of the Senate, who may refuse permission for such
publication. It is expressly recognised by section 25( g )
of the Powers and Privileges Act. Nonetheless, the President and the
Speaker may be called upon by a notice from the Attorney-General
pursuant to section 12(1)( e )
of the Bribery Act to furnish any document whatsoever in their
control. There is nothing in the Act to exclude from production
documents presented to select committees which have not yet reported
to the House or the Senate. The evidence taken by those committees
if reduced to writing and contained in a document may similarly be
called for, even though the committee is still sitting. If the
President or the Speaker refuses to do so, on the ground that
compliance would involve a publication contrary to the privilege of
the Houses of Parliament, the Supreme Court has power under section
12(4) of the Act to order the production. 

 I
turn next to the power to request a bank to produce the ,accounts of
a suspect, his spouse or children and the right of the court to order
their production if the suspect refuses his consent. At common law a
bank is under a legal duty to observe secrecy in relation to its
customer’s affairs. That duty is, however, qualified to the extent
that under the Bankers’ Books Evidence Act 1879, a court can order
copies of a customer’s account to be taken for the purposes of
legal proceedings. Legal proceedings within the contemplation of
that statute are civil or criminal proceedings in which evidence is
or may be given. An investigation to determine whether a crime has
or has not been committed are not legal proceedings of such a
character. 

 But
that notwithstanding, section 12(4) of the Bribery Act empowers the
court to make an order compelling the bank to produce its customer’s
accounts to enable the Attorney-General to investigate a suspected
offence. Here then is another example of a situation in which the
court can make an order under the Bribery Act which the law does not
otherwise countenance nor contemplate. 

 One
last provision of the Bribery Act may be noticed. Section 13 (1)( b )
provides that: 




‘ Any
police officer of or above the rank of inspector and any public
servant conducting an investigation into an offence alleged or
suspected to have been committed under this Act- ... ( b )
may for the purposes of such investigation, with the written consent
of the Attorney-General and after obtaining a warrant from a
magistrate and with such assistance as may be necessary, enter and
search any office, registry or other room of or used by a public
body: Provided that the Governor-General may by order exempt any
office, registry, or room from entry and search under the provisions
of this paragraph.’ 




 37 

 Counsel
stated that no order has been made by the Governor-General since 1976
exempting the Senate and the House of Assembly from search under this
subsection. 

 Section
13(2) makes it a criminal offence punishable by a fine or
imprisonment (or both fine and imprisonment) for anyone to obstruct
an entry and search authorised by section 13(1)( b ).
 It is one of the privileges of the United Kingdom Parliament to
exclude strangers from its walls and to debate behind closed doors. 
Powers in this regard appear to be conferred upon the President and
Speaker of The Bahamas Senate and House of Assembly by sections 9, 12
and 13 of the Powers and Privileges Act. These powers, however, are
curtailed by the express language of section 13(1)( b )
and (2) of the Bribery Act. Neither the President nor the Speaker
could lawfully exclude any properly authorised police officer of or
above the rank of inspector who with his subordinates, invaded the
chamber whilst in session be the sittings in public or behind closed
doors, or conducted a search in furtherance of an investigation into
a suspected offence of bribery. 

 In Re Parliamentary Privilege Act 1770 [1958] AC 331 the London Electricity Board threatened to institute
proceedings for libel against a Member of Parliament in respect of
statements made by him in a letter to the Paymaster-General. The
matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges of the House of
Commons. The committee concluded that in writing the letter
impugned, the member was engaged in “a proceeding in Parliament”
within the meaning of the Bill of Rights 1688, section 1 (ninth
paragraph) of which declares that “the freedom of speech and
debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or
questioned in any court or place out of Parliament” (spellings
modified). The Parliamentary Privilege Act 1770 provided that any
person might at any time commence and prosecute any action against
any person entitled to the privilege of Parliament and no such action
was to be at any time impeached, stayed or delayed by or under colour
of pretence of any privilege of Parliament. The Committee of
Privileges recommended that the opinion of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council should be sought on the question of whether the
House would be acting contrary to the Act of 1770 if it treated the
issue of a writ against a Member of Parliament in respect of a speech
or proceeding by him in Parliament as a breach of its privileges. It
was held that, although the language of the 1770 Act was apt to cover
any suits (including suits for defamation, whether in or out of
Parliament) and to bar the plea of any privilege of Parliament, there
were considerations inherent in the Act itself pointing to a
necessary limitation of its meaning. In the result the Act applied
only to proceedings against Members of Parliament in respect of their
debts and actions as individuals, and not in respect of their conduct
in Parliament as Members of Parliament. The 1770 Act therefore did
not abridge or affect the ancient and essential privilege of speech
in Parliament. If it were read so as to have any application to such
speeches, the effect would be substantially to repeal section 1
(ninth 

 38 

 paragraph)
of the Bill of Rights 1688, and such a conclusion could not be
lightly reached. 

 When
I examine the Bribery Act 1 find that the court has power to make
orders the effect of which is to derogate from, or curtail, a variety
of common law rights and privileges, under sections 11(3) and 12(4). 
I find nothing in the Act which warrants a construction that the
phrase “any other person” in section 12(1)( d )
is to be construed as excluding Members of Parliament who by reason
of their speeches and actions in Parliament are believed to be
acquainted with facts relevant to an investigation into an offence
under the Act. I find that the Act expressly provides that the right
of Parliament to control the admission of strangers to its chambers
may be invaded. I further find that the right of Parliament through
the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House to withhold
publication of documents relating to the proceedings of either
chamber may be abridged. 

 Parliament
is assumed to know the law. I am therefore bound to assume that when
the Parliament of an independent Bahamas passed the Bribery Act in
1976 it was fully cognisant of its own privileges and the privileges
of its Members. It appears to me that with that knowledge,
Parliament clothed the Attorney-General and the courts with Draconian
powers, the effect of which was to subordinate privileges and rights
of all sorts to the greater good of cleansing the body politic of
bribery and corruption. Other than the claim that the parliamentary
privilege of freedom of speech extended to protect the defendant from
disclosing information in his possession on the basis of which he
spoke in Parliament, no other ground was advanced as to why I should
not make the order asked for by the Attorney-General. It was not
suggested that the speech and disclosures did not constitute
reasonable grounds for suspecting that Cabinet Ministers, civil
servants, and officials of the Central Bank had committed offences
under the Bribery Act. In the circumstances even if the
parliamentary privilege claimed by the defendant under section 4 of
the Powers and Privileges Act were as wide as contended for, no good
reason was advanced as to why I should not exercise my discretion in
favour of the Attorney-General. 

 It
appeared to me that if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting
that Cabinet Ministers and other public servants have been corrupt,
it is in the public interest that the matter be thoroughly
investigated to the end that either their names be cleared, or they
be brought to justice. Consequently, I made the order of the 23rd
February requiring the defendant to comply forthwith with the terms
of the Attorney-General’s notice of 3rd February 1982. 

 Order
accordingly.

 Federal
Bookmakers Ltd v Joseph And Another 

 HIGH
COURT OF BARBADOS 

 SIR
WILLIAM DOUGLAS CJ 

 6TH
JANUARY 1978 

 Copyright
– Breach – Evidence – Failure to establish that infringing work
derived from literary work in which plaintiff had an interest –
Need for court to compare original work with work alleged to infringe
copyright 

 Trespass
– Trespass to land – Physical presence on premises of another –
Trespasser pirating information – Injunction and damages 

 The
plaintiff company operated a betting shop. It claimed that the
copyright in the racing calendar, the forfeit list and the final
overnight lists of declared runners had been assigned to it by the
Jockey Club of Great Britain. Also, it had arranged with an agency
in London to be supplied with information relating to races. From
this information the plaintiff selected races and produced programmes
with the aid of which its clients could place bets. The agency also
provided simulated commentaries on the races. The plaintiff
broadcast the commentaries in its shop and displayed the results of
the races on a board. The defendants operated a rival betting shop. 
The plaintiff maintained that an employee of the defendants had sat
on a window sill of the plaintiff’s shop or stood on the pavement
outside to obtain information from the plaintiff’s public address
system and relayed the race commentaries by radio transmitter. The
plaintiff had a photograph of one of the defendants’ employees
sitting on the window sill with a walkie-talkie. The defendants also
produced race programmes and these contained information, the
plaintiff asserted, that could only have been derived from the
plaintiff. The plaintiff sued the defendants for breach of copyright
and in trespass. 

 Held, (1) Although there was a similarity between the programmes published
by the plaintiff and those published by the defendants and the
plaintiff’s programmes were based on information supplied from
London, no evidence had been adduced to show that the information
transmitted from London comprised in whole or in part the literary
works in respect of which the copyright had been assigned to the
plaintiff; moreover, the court had not been given an opportunity to
compare the copyright material with the works which allegedly
infringed the copyright in order to establish whether the latter was
a substantial reproduction of the former; accordingly, the claim in
respect of copyright failed. 

 40 

 (2)
It had been established by the photograph that an employee of the
defendants had sat on the plaintiff’s window sill to transmit
information; the claim in trespass had, therefore, been established
and the plaintiff was entitled to damages and an injunction.

 Action

against Attie Saffie Joseph and Saffie Anthony Joseph (trading under
the name Tote Investments Racing Services) for breach of copyright
and trespass. 

 J
Connell and M Pierce (instructed by Browne&amp;Chapman) for the plaintiff 

 L
Luckhoo QC and J Dear QC (instructed by R G Mandeville&amp;Co) for the defendants 

 Sir
William Douglas CJ. The plaintiff company operates a betting shop in Marhill Street in
the city of Bridgetown. The defendants have a betting shop in
Marhill Street across from the plaintiff’s which they carry on in
partnership under the name “Tote Investments Racing Service”. 
The premises which the plaintiff rents comprise a wall building at
the corner of Marhill Street and Palmetto Street and there is a
pavement approximately 6 feet wide running alongside the building in
Marhill and Palmetto Streets. 

 The
plaintiff’s claim is for relief by way of injunction and damages
for the infringement of the copyright (of which it is the assignee)
in a number of literary works in the nature of periodical
publications, namely the programmes of racing contained in the racing
calendar, the four-day forfeit lists and the final overnight lists of
the declared runners. The plaintiff also claims, in respect of
trespass, that: 




‘ the
defendants by their servants and agents have on divers occasions
during 1976 trespassed on the aforesaid pavement, and Marhill Street
aforesaid and on Palmetto Street and received and transmitted
information concerning the plaintiff’s racing service without the
licence or consent of the plaintiff, to wit: information contained in
the copyright works aforesaid to the defendants’ place of business
on Marhill Street and thereby caused the depreciation of the value of
the premises in possession of the plaintiff as a place for carrying
on business as a bookmaker and proprietor and operator of a racing
service.’ 




 41 

 By
their defence, the defendants deny that the pavement is on land
occupied by the plaintiff and allege that any pavement as described
is a public pavement and thoroughfare open to be used by any member
of the public. The defendants deny that the plaintiff is the
assignee of copyright in the copyright works described in the
statement of claim, and deny that there was infringement of any
copyright. They also deny trespass as alleged. 

 In
his evidence, Mr Elias Haloute, the managing director of the
plaintiff company, stated that the copyright in the racing calendar,
the forfeit list, and the final overnight lists of declared runners
was vested in the Jockey Club of Great Britain. He produced a deed
of assignment dated 1973 from the Jockey Club to himself. He also
produced an assignment dated 1976 from the Jockey Club to the
plaintiff and himself. The consideration rose from £1600 for the
first year to £2000 in the third. The company had to have legal
representation in the United Kingdom. This cost £1200 per annum. 

 The
witness described the arrangement whereby the compiling, transmission
and receiving of information were done by Sporting Consultants and
Services Ltd, for which the plaintiff paid £15,300 per annum. The
plaintiff rented telex equipment from Cable and Wireless. The local
segment was £5,200 per annum, which included telex rental, line
rentals, electricity, clerks and supervision in receiving, checking,
re-checking and disseminating information. Insurance came to £50
and the rental of floor space cost £600 per annum. The telex system
had to be backed up by telephone in case of breakdown; and this
worked out at £1000 a year. The witness put the value of goodwill
attaching to his business at £600 per annum. 

 The
system adopted by the plaintiff is as follows: one day prior to the
running of races, information on the races to be held at the various
race-tracks came through on the telex. The witness selected the
races he wished to put on the programme for the particular day’s
racing. The information in relation to the selected races was typed
and stencilled and the programme circulated to the betting shop’s
clients at about 1.30 to 2.00 pm. On receipt of these programmes
clients could place their bets. When the races were run, the results
were published first in a commentary and later in written form on a
display board. 

 The
witness’s further evidence was that in 1975 the defendants had an
agreement with him for the supply of information compiled by the
plaintiff, and also of starting prices and results. For this the
defendants paid $3050 per month. That agreement expired on 31st
December 1975. The defendants applied for a renewal and negotiations
took place between the parties. These negotiations involved the
witness and Mr Springer, a director, travelling to the United
Kingdom. The negotiations failed and the 1975 agreement was never
renewed. Mr Haloute stated that the current assignment from the
Jockey Club to the plaintiff was perfected on 28th May 1976 and it
was in relation to the rights conferred in that assignment that the
plaintiff sought relief. 

 42 

 The
witness produced sample programmes from the plaintiff’s betting
shop and from that of the defendants. His evidence was: 




‘ The
lists are not identical in that the information is not complete. 
There is more information on their sheet than there is on ours. But
the lists of runners are identical. Betting forecast as prepared by
our representative in London has been reproduced. Distance of events
along with post times have also been reproduced.’ 




 The
witness went on to say that the information transmitted to the
plaintiff from London came on a private, leased circuit and stated
that the only way that the copyright material could get into Barbados
was through the plaintiff. 

 In
regard to this last point, the witness was cross-examined as regards
publication of information concerning English racing in the Sporting Chronicle Handicap Book ,
in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, in the Trinidad Guardian and the Trinidad Express ,
in the Time-Form publication, and in Race-Form up to Date ,
all of which are in general circulation. 

 Mr
Haloute, in testifying on the allegation of trespass said: 




‘ I
have seen the servant of the defendants on numerous occasions on the
window sill and on pavement with a walkie-talkie on Palmetto Street
receiving information from our public address system and relaying
through walkie-talkie the commentaries. There were two servants, one
Keith Griffith and one ‘Turn-key’.’ 




 Station
Sergeant Holder, a witness for the plaintiff, stated that on 1st June
1976 he received a complaint from Mr Haloute and visited the
plaintiff’s betting shop where he saw a young man by the doorway
operating a walkie-talkie. He then visited the defendants’ betting
shop where he spoke to one of the defendants who told him: 




‘ There
is nothing wrong with the communication set. I have a licence to
operate it. All my employee is doing is just giving me the results
from [the plaintiff].’ 




 The
station sergeant advised him against the practice and left. 

 Mr
Ronald Carrington, the photographer, referred to a conversation he
had with Mr Haloute in August 1976. As a result he took certain
photographs at the plaintiff’s building in Marhill Street. One
photograph shows the person known as Alias Turn-key (who is a servant
of the defendants according to Mr Haloute) sitting on the window sill
of the plaintiff’s building with a walkie-talkie in his hand as if
he was speaking into it. The witness Robert Mann related that he
noticed a young man sitting in the window repeating the commentary
coming over the plaintiff’s public address system. He also
described how he went across to the defendants’ betting shop and
heard the results coming over their radio system. 

 43 

 Apart
from putting in certain documents, no evidence was led on behalf of
the defendants. Mr Luckhoo submitted that there was no evidence of
the publication of the racing calendar or the four-day forfeit list,
nor was there evidence of the format, contents and details of the
overnight list of declared runners as issued by the Jockey Club. On
the issue of trespass his submission was that there was no breach of
law in conveying information from such premises by walkie-talkie. 

 On
the first of these issues, counsel referred me to Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 All ER 465 where the House of Lords held that the correct
approach in deciding if there were an infringement of copyright in a
literary compilation was first to determine whether the work as a
whole was entitled to copyright and second, to enquire whether the
part reproduced by the defendant was a substantial part of the whole.
 Persaud J adopted the same approach in Demerara Turf Club Ltd v Phang [1966] 6 WIR 177 at page 182. 

 The
literary compilations to which copyright is alleged to attach in this
case are: 




‘ literary
works in the nature of periodical publications which are regularly
produced in connection with racing in the United Kingdom namely the
programmes of racing contained in the racing calendar, the four-day
forfeit lists and the final overnight lists of the declared runners.’ 




 The
evidence is that the compiling, transmission and receiving of
information is done by Sporting Consultants and Services Ltd, who are
under contract to supply the plaintiff with “a full comprehensive
racing service to include overnight runners, jockeys, betting
forecasts, post positions, results, simulated commentaries, betting
‘shows’ etc.” What has been shown in this case is that there is
a similarity between the programmes published by the plaintiff and
those published by the defendants. It has further been proved that
the plaintiff’s programmes are made up from the information
transmitted from London by Sporting Consultants and Services Ltd. 
What has not been shown is that the information transmitted from
London comprises in whole or in part the literary works in respect of
which the copyright has been assigned to the plaintiff. 

 Further,
in copyright cases the court must be in a position to compare the
copyright material with the works which allegedly infringe that
copyright, in order to establish whether the latter is a substantial
reproduction of the former. I have no material before me on which I
can make any such comparison. For these reasons the claim in respect
of copyright fails. 

 In
regard to trespass I consider the admission made by Mr Saffie Joseph
to Station Sergeant Holder most damaging. It is clear that the
defendants were pursuing a deliberate policy of pirating information
from the plaintiff and sending their employees on to the plaintiff’s
premises to that end. I need not address myself to the question of
the 

 44 

 rights
of members of the public to pass and repass; because here the
picture, as recorded by Mr Ronald Carrington, is of the defendants’
employee sitting on the plaintiff’s window ledge transmitting
information. My view is that the claim for trespass has been amply
made out. 

 There
will be judgment for the plaintiff on the issue of trespass. There
will be an order for an injunction as prayed and for damages in the
sum of $1000. And the plaintiff will have costs to be taxed. 
Certificate for two counsel. 

 Order

 6TH
JANUARY 1978 

 Trust
– Resulting trust – Property transferred into name of another –
Land purchased in name of mistress – Subsequent marriage – No
presumption of advancement 

 Matrimonial
home – Beneficial interests – House in names of both parties –
Both contribution substantially to cost – No evidence of proportion
of contributions – House purchase by man and mistress –
Subsequent marriage – Interests treated as equal 

 The
first plaintiff and the defendant lived together in a common law
union from 1942. The second plaintiff was born to them in 1953. In
1962 a parcel of land was bought in the names of the first plaintiff
and the defendant, the defendant providing the purchase money. In
1963 a dwelling-house was erected on part of the land; both the first
plaintiff and the defendant made substantial contributions towards
its construction, although neither could state at a later date what
had been their respective contributions. In 1967 the defendant sold
to the second plaintiff a half share in the land which had been
purchased in 1962 and a half share in the house. The land was
divided into lots for development on a plan certified by a surveyor
in 1970; the plan was approved-by the chief town planner in 1971. 
The house was sited on one of the lots. The first plaintiff and the
defendant were married in 1970 and lived together until 1974 when
they separated. Subsequently their marriage was dissolved. On the
question of the respective interest of the three parties in the land
and the house. 

 Held - (1) On the purchase of the land in 1962 no presumption of,
advancement had arisen since at that time the first plaintiff had
been the defendant’s mistress and not his wife; accordingly, the
first plaintiff held her moiety of the land purchased in 1962
(subject to holdings (2) and (3) below) on a resulting trust for the
defendant. 

 Dyer
v Dyer (1788) 2 Cox Eq Cas 92 and Pettit v Pettit [1970] AC 777 applied. 

 (2)
As both the first plaintiff and the defendant had made substantial
contributions to the acquisition of the house and in the absence of
any evidence by which their shares could be quantified, their
beneficial 

 46 

 interests
in the house up to 1967 would be treated as equal; when, however, the
defendant conveyed his interest in the house to the second plaintiff
he divested himself of his entire interest. 

 Rimmer
v Rimmer [1952] 2 All ER 863 and Cooke v Head [1972] 2 All ER 38 applied. 

 (3)
Although the plan for dividing up the land as a whole into individual
building plots was drawn up after the house had been built, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary it could be inferred that the
parties had intended that the house should occupy only the single
plot on which it stood; accordingly, the disposition in 1967 by the
defendant of his half share in the house only transferred the plot on
which it stood, and not the land as a whole.

 Action 

 Action Daphne Eileen Austin and Rosina Noreen Austin applied to the Supreme
Court (case 627 of 1974) for an order for possession of certain land
and an injunction to restrain Cecil M R Austin from entering upon the
land. 

 W
H A Hanschell QC (instructed by R S Nicholls) for the plaintiffs 

 E
D Mottley (instructed by Carrington&amp;Sealy) for the defendant 

 Worrell
J. The first plaintiff is the former wife of the defendant. The second
plaintiff is the daughter of the first plaintiff and the defendant. 

 The
plaintiffs are seeking an order for possession of a parcel of land
being 74,845 square feet situate at Carter’s Gap, Christ Church,
and an injunction to restrain the defendant from entering upon the
land. On a portion of this land there is a dwelling-house called
“Rosnor”. 

 The
defendant does not dispute that the freehold estate to the land is
vested in the plaintiffs; but he alleges that he is an equitable
co-tenant with the second plaintiff and that he is jointly entitled
to possession of the land and the dwelling-house. He further alleges
that the first plaintiff, the legal co-tenant, holds the moiety in
fee simple vested in her as trustee for him, and he seeks a
declaration to this effect. 

 From
1942, the first plaintiff lived with the defendant as his mistress. 
In 1953, she bore him a daughter who is the second plaintiff in this
case. In 1962, a portion of land being 74,845 square feet in area
was purchased in the joint names of the first plaintiff and the
defendant for $6820.55. The defendant advanced all the purchase
money. In the following year, 

 47 

 a
dwelling-house of stone called “Rosnor” was erected on part of
this land. This house was insured in the joint names of the first
plaintiff and a the defendant for $20,000. Thereafter, the first
plaintiff and the defendant moved into the dwelling-house “Rosnor”
and lived together as man and wife. During this period the lawful
wife of the defendant was alive. 

 On
12th January 1967 the defendant conveyed to the second plaintiff a
half share in the land which was purchased in 1962 in the joint names
of the first plaintiff and the defendant, and a half share in the
dwelling-house “Rosnor” for $4000. On the same date he
transferred his interest in the policy of insurance on the
dwelling-house to the second plaintiff. Taking into consideration
the price paid for the land in 1962 and the insured value of the
dwelling-house, it is obvious that there was an almost overwhelming
element of gift. Whatever might have been the defendant’s motive,
it did not make the transaction other than it was, because there was
a genuine passing of the legal estate. 

 After
1967, the first plaintiff continued to live as the defendant’s
mistress until he obtained a divorce from his wife. In 1970, they
got married and they lived together until 1974, when they separated. 
Divorce proceedings were subsequently instituted and their marriage
has been dissolved. 

 In
ascertaining the rights and interests of the parties in the property
in dispute, it will be necessary to examine the history of the
transactions relating to the purchase of the land and the erection of
the dwelling-house. For the sake of convenience it will be necessary
to divide this period into three stages: (a) the time when the land
was purchased in 1962; (b) the time when the dwelling-house was
erected; and (c) the time when the defendant conveyed his share in
the property to the second plaintiff. 

 Turning
now to the first stage. At the time when the land was purchased the
defendant advanced all of the purchase money. In the conveyance
dated 20th August 1962 the land was conveyed to the first plaintiff
and the defendant as joint tenants. It is clear that the legal
estate was vested in these parties jointly; but was there any
question of a resulting trust arising out of this transaction? 

 In Pettit v Pettit [1970] AC 777 at page 814, Lord Upjohn in the course of his judgment
in dealing with the doctrine of resulting trusts remarked: 




‘ ...
in the absence of evidence to the contrary if the property be
conveyed in the name of a stranger he will hold it as trustee for the
person putting up the purchase money and if the purchase money has
been provided by two or more persons the property is held by those
persons in proportion to the purchase money that they have provided.’ 




 He
then went on to support this proposition by long-standing authority
when he said: 

 48 




‘ My
Lords, all this is trite law but I make no apology for citing the
judgment of Eyre CB in 1788 in the leading case of Dyer v Dyer (1788) 2 Cox Eq Cas 92 at pages 93, 94, set out in full in White and Tudor’s Leading Cases in Equity (9th edn.) (1928) Vol 2, page 749: ‘The clear result of all the
cases, without a single exception, is that the trust of a legal
estate, whether freehold, copyhold, or leasehold; whether taken in
the names of the purchasers and others without that of the purchaser;
whether in one name or several; whether jointly or successive -
results to the man who advances the purchase money. This is a
general proposition, supported by all the cases, and there is nothing
to contradict it; and it goes on a strict analogy to the rule of
common law, that where a feoffment is made without consideration, the
use results to the feoffor. It is the established doctrine of a
court of equity, that this resulting trust may be rebutted by
circumstances in evidence. The cases go one step further, and prove
that the circumstance of one or more of the nominees being a child or
children of the purchaser, is to operate by rebutting the resulting
trust; and it has been determined in so many cases that the nominee
being a child shall have such operation as a circumstance of evidence
that we should be disturbing landmarks if we suffered either of these
propositions to be called in question, namely, that such circumstance
shall rebut the resulting trust, and that it shall do as a
circumstance of evidence.’ 

 The
remarks of Eyre CB in relation to a child being a nominee are equally
applicable to the case where the wife is the nominee. Though
normally referred to as presumption of advancement, it is no more
than a circumstance of evidence which may rebut the presumption of
resulting trust, and the editors of White and Tudor were careful to remind their readers at page 763 that ‘all
resulting trusts which arise simply from equitable presumptions, may
be rebutted by parol evidence ...’ This doctrine applies equally to
personalty.’ 




 On
the purchase of the land in the joint names of the defendant and the
first plaintiff, the question of advancement does not arise, she
being at the time only his mistress; and on the evidence I find
nothing to indicate otherwise than that there was a resulting trust
of the moiety in fee simple vested in her as legal co-tenant, for the
defendant. 

 I
turn now to the erection of the dwelling-house on a portion of the
land. According to the first plaintiff, at the time when the
dwelling-house was being erected, she owned a supermarket business
and she used the income from that business to meet some of the costs
of construction. She states that she contributed to some of the
costs of building materials and labour and she produced a number of
bills and receipts in support. Vernon de Lacey Jones, the
contractor, who built the dwelling-house, corroborates her story in
this regard. He also states that the defendant supplied some of the
building materials and sometimes paid the cost of labour. Although
the first plaintiff admits that the defendant made a 

 49 

 contribution
to the building of the dwelling-house, she is unable to state in what
amount he contributed. When asked what was the extent of her a
contribution she says that she does not remember. 

 In
his evidence, the defendant states that he and the first plaintiff
became friendly in 1942. She used to assist him at his business
place which he describes as a “menu parlour”, I think what he
means is a restaurant. After the land was purchased in 1962, he
states that he started to collect material to erect a dwelling-house
on part of the land. He states that after he had accumulated $7000
in cash construction work was commenced on the dwelling-house. He
does not deny that the first plaintiff contributed to the erection of
the dwelling-house. He says further that he has no accounts to show
how much money he contributed or how much money she contributed. I
accept his story as genuine, and I therefore find that by their joint
efforts they acquired the dwelling-house to be used for their joint
benefit. 

 It
is now necessary to determine what were the beneficial interests of
the first plaintiff and the defendant in the dwelling-house on its
completion. The evidence discloses that each party made a
substantial contribution, and in the absence of any evidence to
quantify their shares I would adopt the principle stated by Sir
Raymond Evershed MR in his judgment in Rimmer v Rimmer [1952] 2 All ER 863 at page 867 as a guide in determining their
respective beneficial interests. The principle is stated thus: 




‘ Where
the court is satisfied that both the parties have a substantial
beneficial interest and it is not fairly possible to assume some more
precise calculation of their shares I think that equality necessarily
follows.’ 




 In
a later case, Cooke
v Head [1972] 2 All ER 38 at page 41, Lord Denning MR said: 




‘ The
particular case of a man and his mistress came before the Court of
Appeal in Diwell v Farnes [1959] 2 All ER 379. The court was divided in opinion. The majority
thought that a mistress was not in the same position as a wife. She
could recover her actual contributions to the purchase price, but
could not claim any part of the windfall on resale. Willmer LJ
approached the case much as we approach cases between husband and
wife. He would have given the mistress one-half. His approach is
more in accord with recent developments’. 




 In
regard to the area of land on which the dwelling-house stands, the
evidence shows that the dwelling-house is sited on a lot being one of
several lots on a plan of some 74,260 square feet of the land
certified by Compton Frazer (a sworn surveyor) on 15th June 1970, and
approved by the chief town-planner for development on 15th September
1971. It may be observed that this plan was only prepared after the
dwelling-house was erected. However, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary, the inference I draw is that it was the parties’
intention that the dwelling-house 

 50 

 should
only occupy the portion of land defined in that lot. In this
connection it is clear from the evidence of both parties that they
intended to use a portion of the land purchased in 1962 to erect a
dwelling-house and to develop the remainder into building-lots for
sale. 

 As
I see it, therefore, prior to the execution of the conveyance in 1967
by the defendant, the position of the first plaintiff and the
defendant with regard to their respective interests in the
dwelling-house and the lot on which it is sited, was that each party
was entitled to one half of the beneficial interest in the
dwelling-house and the lot. On the execution of the conveyance by
the defendant in 1967, the half share which he held in the
dwelling-house and the lot was transferred to the second plaintiff so
that he does not now hold any legal estate or beneficial interest in
the dwelling-house and the lot. 

 In
relation to the remainder of the land, the first plaintiff holds the
legal estate vested in her in trust for the defendant (see Dyer v Dyer (1788) 2 Cox Eq Cas 92). The second plaintiff and the defendant are
therefore tenants in common in equity, and they are both equally
entitled to occupation (see the judgment of Lord Denning MR in Jones v Jones [1977] 2 All ER 231). 

 It
is therefore ordered that the defendant give up possession of the
dwelling-house “Rosnor” on or before 15 January 1978. It is
further ordered that as from 16th January 1978 the defendant, his
servants or agents, be restrained from entering upon the
dwelling-house “Rosnor” and the lot of land on which it is
situated at Carter’s Gap, Enterprise, Christ Church. The
declaration sought by the defendant in his counter claim is refused. 
Each party will bear his own costs. 

 Order
accordingly.

 Negligence
– Duty of care – To whom duty owed – Road users – Obstruction
on highway – Signal to other road user – Contributory negligence 

 The
plaintiff rode his motor cycle into a sharp bend on a country road
and collided with a motor lorry which was being driven by the first
defendant on its off side in order to overtake a stationary car. The
car driver had signalled to the first defendant to overtake the car. 
The defendants were liable to the plaintiff for negligence and they
issued a third-party notice claiming contribution from the car
driver. 

 Held - The third party owed a duty of care to the first defendant by
reason of his having created a dangerous situation by parking his car
in that position and by reason of signalling to the first defendant;
he had failed to discharge that duty of care and his contribution to
the defendants’ liability was 50 per cent.

Moseley for the third party 

 Husbands
J. On 18th August 1976, the plaintiff was riding his motor cycle along
a country road in the direction of Bridgetown. As he rode into a
sharp left bend (described as a “blind corner”) on that road he
met and collided with a motor lorry on its off-side. The motor lorry
was owned by the first defendant and driven by the second defendant. 
To the left of the motor lorry there was a motor car parked on its
off-side facing towards Bridgetown. This car was driven by the third
party. The 

 52 

 plaintiff
was severely injured in the collision and sues the second defendant,
as the servant or agent of the first defendant, for negligence. 

 The
first and second defendants sought and were granted leave to issue a
third party notice. In their defence the defendants denied that they
were negligent and alleged that the collision was due wholly or in
part to the plaintiff’s negligence. In the alternative they
claimed the collision was caused wholly or in part by the negligence
of the third party, among other things, in parking his motor car
where it was and in signalling to the second defendant to overtake
when it was not safe to do so. 

 I
am satisfied that the plaintiff at the time of the accident was on
his left and proper side and was not riding at an excessive speed. 
He was not shown to have been negligent in any way. I find that the
collision occurred because the defendants’ motor lorry was in the
plaintiff’s path as he rounded the sharp left bend. 

 Why
was the motor lorry in this position? The second defendant stated
that as he was approaching this bend (a right-hand one in his
direction) he saw the third party’s car parked in the bend on its
off-side. As the car was in his path and his vision around the
corner was obstructed, he stopped his motor lorry and blew his horn. 
The driver of the car signalled him to overtake and as he moved from
his left side over to the right to pass the car, the cyclist came
around the corner and collided with this lorry. 

 The
third party’s version was as follows. He had parked his car
momentarily on its off-side in the bend to speak to someone. The
defendants’ truck, travelling in the opposite direction, stopped
some 15 to 20 yards in front of him. He looked back, saw that the
road behind was clear for some 150 yards and beckoned the second
defendant to drive on. The second defendant hesitated for about
twenty seconds before moving over to the right. The third party
continued: 




‘ While
he was coming forward I heard a noise coming behind. I looked back
and saw this motor cycle travelling very quickly. The cycle was
ridden by the plaintiff. He was going towards Bridgetown. When I
first saw the cycle it was about 20 yards away. The cycle was on his
left side. The cycle came and struck the truck which had stopped.’ 




 Cross-examined
about what he did before signaling to the second defendant he said: 




‘ I
did not look through the rear view mirror. I looked to the left
through the back window for a matter of seconds. I looked forward
for about five seconds before I beckoned the driver. The driver
hesitated another ten seconds and then moved off.’ 




 Measurements
taken by Station Sergeant McGeary of the Royal Barbados Police Force
were to the following effect: the width of the road at the point of
the impact as pointed out by the third party was 17 feet 8 inches;
the width of the motor lorry was 7 feet 5 inches, its overall 

 53 

 length
being 24 feet; from the left front wheel of the motor lorry to the
left gutter measured 9 feet 5 inches; from the left rear wheel to the
left gutter was 7 feet 9 inches; from the right front wheel to the
right gutter measured 2 feet 8 inches; from the right rear wheel to
the right gutter was 3 feet 9 inches. The station sergeant said that
he spoke with the third party at the scene and the third party told
him that he had parked his car on the right or off-side to give a
message to someone and, whilst there, the truck came up the road
going to the country; he signalled the driver to come out and the
driver of the truck did so. 

 On
the question of negligence I am of the view that the second defendant
was negligent in attempting to negotiate a blind corner on his
off-side without ensuring that it was safe to do so. He is therefore
liable for the damage caused by his neglect. 

 The
extent to which he may be entitled to a contribution from the third
party will depend on whether it can be shown that the third party was
under a duty of care to him and was negligent in the performance of
that duty. I find that the third party created a dangerous situation
by parking his vehicle in that sharp bend and on its off side. Not
only did he obstruct the free flow of traffic but, so long as his
vehicle was parked in that position he made it impossible for
country-bound traffic to proceed without encroaching on that part of
the carriageway reserved for on coming traffic. Having voluntarily
and for his own convenience obstructed the second defendant’s
portion of the carriageway, thereby reducing considerably whatever
visibility there might have been around the bend for the second
defendant at that point, what did the third party do on the approach
of the second defendant? He did not move his vehicle on to its left
and proper side but instead held his hand out, as it were, to his
unsighted fellow driver and undertook to direct him safely around the
obstruction he had created. 

 It
was urged that the second defendant was tardy by some twenty seconds
in responding to the third party’s signal and that this delay was
responsible for the accident. I have not been persuaded by this
argument. Anyone in the circumstances of this case who voluntarily
creates a hazard on the carriageway and takes it upon himself, acting
the part of a good neighbour, to guide a fellow traveller away from
that hazard assumes a duty of care to him in the discharge of which
he must act with reasonable diligence. Lord Atkin in the celebrated
case Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562 at page 580, in dealing with the duty of care owed to
one’s neighbour, put it this way: 




‘ You
must take reasonable care to avoid acts and omissions which you can
reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who,
then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who
are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought
reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I
directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in
question.’ 




 54 

 On
the evidence I find that the precaution taken by the third party
before signalling to the second defendant that it was safe to proceed
fell far short of what was required of him in the circumstances. The
results were disastrous and he must bear a substantial part of the
defendants’ liability to the plaintiff. I would assess this at 50
per cent. 

 [Husbands

 Order
accordingly.

 Action

of 1977) claiming damages from Charles Grant and seeking an
injunction restraining him from obstructing the access to the
plaintiff’s business premises. 

 D
Rawlins for the plaintiff 

 E
Mottley for the defendant 

 Williams
acting CJ. The plaintiff, Lewis Boxill, and the defendant, Charles Grant, are
neigbours, living at Tichbourne, St Michael. The public road,
Tichbourne Road, runs directly in front of their respective homes. 

 There
are two entrances to the plaintiff’s premises: one which is nearer
to the defendant’s home and leads to the plaintiff’s garage where
he keeps his car; and the other leading to that part of his premises
where he repairs vehicles. The plaintiff is a motor mechanic and his
main customer is Plantations Trading Co, whose vans and trucks he
maintains. 

 His
claim against the defendant is for an injunction and damages; and it
is put forward on the following basis (I quote from paragraphs 6, 7
and 8 of his statement of claim): 

 56 




‘ 6.
The only means of access to the said workshop for vans, lorries and
other vehicles is by entrance from the said Tichbourne Road to the
plaintiff’s property. 

 7.
From on or about the month of February 1968, and onwards and more
particularly on or about 4th February 1977, the defendant began and
has continued to block up the said entrance, passage and yard by
parking or permitting his vehicles to be parked at the entrance to
the said passage and to remain there at all hours of the day and
night so that on many occasions a passage of 1 or 2 feet only was
left and on numerous occasions there was no room for a vehicle to
pass, whereby the plaintiff was prevented from using the same for the
purpose of taking into or removing from the plaintiff’s yard,
workshop any vehicles and from enjoying such right of access as for
the purpose of any business which right I am entitled to enjoy. 

 8.
On or about 4th November 1977, the defendant also parked his vehicle
M 5444 in the middle of the said public road intentionally blocking
the plaintiff and preventing the use of the said public road. On the
said day the defendant also blocked the said public road with his
said vehicle and thereby prevented a customer of the plaintiff from
reaching the plaintiff’s workshop by the said public road.’ 




 The
plaintiff in his evidence complains of a state of affairs going back
to 1968-69 whereby the defendant and his brothers would park their
vehicles in front of his house and hinder his use of his two
entrances. As far as his business entrance is concerned his
complaint is that they would park near the entrance and would cause
him difficulty in taking vehicles out of his workshop. This, he
said, continued up to 4th November 1977, In reply to questions from
counsel for the defendant, the plaintiff admitted more than once that
the defendant had not blocked the entrance since 4th November. 

 It
is abundantly clear to me that this case is a direct consequence of
the incidents which occurred on 4th November 1977. The plaintiff
when asked if he had taken any action before that date to put an end
to the alleged nuisance, spoke of a communication by his attorney to
the defendant. No evidence was given about this. Indeed no evidence
was given about any particular incident before 4th November 1977. 
And the witnesses for the plaintiff spoke only of what happened on
4th November. The plaintiff’s explanation for his inaction before
4th November was, in his words, “I did not do anything else because
I figure we are neighbours”. 

 After
much hesitation the plaintiff admitted to the defendant’s counsel
that he did not like the idea of the defendant parking in front of
his residence, even in a position which caused no impediment to
either entrance. And in my view it is this attitude of his which
started the ball rolling on 4th November. I turn now to the events
of that day. 

 The
defendant had parked his car overnight in front of the plaintiff’s
residence. There was no obstruction of either of the entrances, but
the 

 57 

 plaintiff
did not like it. Accordingly, he moved two vehicles from his
premises on to the road, driving one to the front of the defendant’s
car and pushing the other, a damaged car, to a position close behind
it. When the defendant came to remove his car he had great
difficulty in removing it. 

 I
reject the plaintiff’s evidence that he had no intention of
blocking the defendant’s car. I also reject his testimony that he
was never asked by the defendant to allow him to move his car. My
finding is that when the defendant made this request, the plaintiff
refused. 

 Then
the defendant decided to get his own back on the plaintiff. After
extricating his car from its position between the two vehicles, he
kept it in the road for about ten minutes. He moved it when Mr
Drakes intervened. I reject his story that the car developed a fault
which he proceeded to fix. Even if he had heard a noise from his
car, that was no reason why the road should have been obstructed. 
The defendant was acting in retaliation against the plaintiff for
what the plaintiff had earlier done. 

 Later
on in the day Mr James Maynard came towards the plaintiff’s
premises driving a truck belonging to Plantations Trading Co which he
was taking for repair. The defendant’s car was blocking the road. 
Mr Maynard sought an alternative route to the plaintiff’s premises
and again found that he could not get in the entrance to the
plaintiff’s workshop. He had to park the truck nearby and leave
it. Mr Maynard also spoke of seeing the defendant manoeuvring his
car to prevent the plaintiff’s Land Rover from leaving the
plaintiff’s premises and going into the road. Strangely enough,
the plaintiff give no evidence of this but I tend to accept that
there was this interference with the plaintiff’s vehicle when it
attempted to leave the workshop entrance. 

 So
that, as I see it, there was on 4th November, an obstruction of the
highway by the defendant; and there was also an obstruction by the
defendant of the plaintiff’s free use of the entrance to, and exit
from, his premises to the public road. 

 What
is the law which I have got to apply? Many cases set out the
applicable principles and I can hardly do any better than quote from
the judgment of Lord Hanworth MR in Harper v G N Haden&amp;Sons Ltd [1933] 3 Ch 298 at page 304 where, after examining the authorities,
he set out the propositions which the cases established: 




‘ (1)
A temporary obstruction to the use of the highway or to the enjoyment
of adjoining premises does not give rise to a legal remedy where such
obstruction is reasonable in quantum and duration. 

 (2)
If either of those limitations is exceeded so that a nuisance to the
public is created the obstruction is wrongful, and an indictment to
abate it will lie. 

 (3)
If an individual can establish (a) a particular injury to himself
beyond that which is suffered by the rest of the public; (b) that the
injury is directly and immediately the consequence of the wrongful 

 58 

 act;
(c) that the injury is of a substantial character, not fleeting or
evanescent, he can bring his action and recover damages for the
injury he has suffered.’ 




 These
propositions had earlier been stated in similar terms by Brett LJ in Benjamin v Storr (1874) LR 9 CP 400. In Fritz v Hobson (1880) 14 Ch D 542 Fry J considered not only these principles, which
are applicable when an individual suffers private injury from a
public nuisance, but he also considered the principle applicable
where there is interference with the private right of entrance from
the highway to adjoining property. He stated at pages 553, 554: 




‘ The
cases of Rose v Groves (1843) 5 Man&amp;G 613 and Lyon v Fishmongers’ Co (1876) 1 App Cas 662 appear to me to establish this, that where the
private right of the owner of land of access to a highway is
unlawfully interfered with, he may recover damages from the wrongdoer
to the extent of his loss of profits in his business carried on at
the place.’ 




 Turning
to the facts of this case and to this latter principle first, there
is no doubt that the plaintiff’s right of access to Tichbourne Road
was interfered with, first when Mr Maynard was unable to drive the
truck into the workshop entrance and, secondly, when the Land Rover
was unable to leave the premises owing to the defendant’s
manoeuvres with his car. But what loss did the plaintiff suffer to
his business? None has been proved. Mr Maynard parked the truck
outside the premises and left it; presumably the plaintiff drove it
into his workshop later in the day. As far as the Land Rover is
concerned, the plaintiff did not speak specifically of this incident
and one would assume therefore that it had no undue significance for
him businesswise. 

 Turning
to the other principle and to the propositions set out by Lord
Hanworth MR, a nuisance to the public was created; but, on the
evidence, the plaintiff can point to nothing constituting an injury
to his business. The truck arrived at his premises, albeit via a
slightly longer route. The access to his premises was obstructed for
a short while but the plaintiff has not shown any way in which his
business would have suffered. If indeed there was injury, there can
be no escape from the conclusion that it would not have been of a
substantial character. 

 The
action is dismissed and judgment is given for the defendant with
costs to be taxed or agreed. 

 Action
dismissed. Costs to the defendant.

COURT OF BARBADOS 

 SIR
WILLIAM DOUGLAS CJ 

 1OTH
APRIL 1978 

 Negligence
– Duty of care – Extent of duty – Safe working arrangements - -
Supply of contaminated pallets to unload cargo of rice 

 In
December 1973 the second defendant’s pallets were used to unload
weedkiller from a ship. The second defendant’s employees and the
stevedores were paid extra for working with an irritant substance. 
The pallets were thereafter set on one side. Later that month the
pallets were, inexplicably, supplied by the second defendant to the
third defendant for use in unloading a cargo of rice. Dust was seen
by the third defendant’s foreman on the pallets; this was assumed
to be flour. The dust from the herbicide which was whitish in
colour, however, could be mistaken for flour. As a result of the use
of the contaminated pallets by the third defendant, part of the cargo
of rice was contaminated and condemned as unfit for human
consumption. On the issue of liability between the second and third
defendants, 

 Held - Even had the third defendant had an opportunity of inspecting the
pallets before use, visual inspection alone would not have enabled
the herbicide to be distinguished from flour or certain other
substances normally found on pallets; the system of work adopted by
the second and third defendants depended on the provision of safe
working equipment and it was clear on the facts that the pallets
supplied by the second defendant were known to be contaminated;
accordingly, the second defendant was entirely responsible for the
contamination of the rice.

 Action 

 Action Shamrock Trading Co Ltd instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court
(case 191 of 1974) against the Attorney-General, the first defendant,
Port Contractors Ltd, the second defendant, and Eric Hassell&amp;Co, the third defendant, for damages for loss occasioned by the
condemnation of part of a cargo of rice as being unfit for human
consumption. The plaintiff, by leave, withdrew from the proceedings
pending the determination of liability between the second and third
defendants. 

 J
Dear QC and C Chenery (instructed by Carrington&amp;Sealy) for the second defendant 

 D
Simons for the third defendant 

 Sir
William Douglas CJ. By an order of this court dated 4th April 1978 the plaintiff was
given permission to withdraw from these proceedings pending the
determination of the substantive issue outstanding in this case,
namely the extent and apportionment of the responsibility for
unloading, shore handling and warehousing the cargo of rice in
question as between the second and third defendants. 

 By
their amended defence, the second defendants plead that any damage
done to the rice occurred prior to the delivery to the second
defendant and was caused by the negligence of the third defendant. 
The particulars of the negligence pleaded are the following. (a) The
third defendant, its servants and/or agents, used pallets on which
the rice was placed for the purpose of removing the rice from the
holds of the vessel which were unsafe in that they contained a
contaminating agent. (b) The third defendant, its servant or agents,
used pallets to unload the rice which they knew (or ought to have
known) were unsafe to use in unloading the rice, which they knew (or
ought to have known) was to be used for human consumption. And (c)
the third defendant, its servants and/or agents, failed to inspect
the pallets to discover whether they were safe for use in unloading
the rice, which it knew was to be used for human consumption. 

 The
third defendant denies negligence and pleads that any loss or damage
was caused wholly by, or was contributed to by, the negligence of the
second defendant. The particulars of the second defendant’s
negligence, as pleaded, are these. (a) The second defendant, its
servants and/or agents, was negligent in that it supplied pallets to
the third defendant, which pallets were contaminated by herbicide
and/or insecticide and/or other contaminating agent deleterious to
health. (b) The second defendant failed and/or neglected and/or
refused to ensure that the pallets supplied to the third defendant
were free from herbicide and/or insecticide and/or other
contaminating agent deleterious to health. (c) The second defendant,
its servants and/or agents, failed and/ or neglected and/or refused
to wash or howsoever otherwise clean the pallets, which had been
previously used to unload herbicide and/or insecticide or other
contaminating agent deleterious to health; and the 

 61 

 second
defendant, its servants and/or agents, well knew (or ought to have
known) that at the material time the bags of rice were to be unloaded
from ss Mabiri by the third defendant, its servants and/or agents. (d) The second
defendant, its servants and/or agents, failed to inspect the pallets
before allowing and/or causing them to be sent to the ss Mabiri to unload the rice and/or to be used for the handling or transporting
and delivery of the rice. (e) The second defendant, its servants
and/or agents, failed to heed or observe the presence of herbicide
and/or insecticide and/or other contaminating agent injurious to
health on the pallets. And (f) The second defendant with full
knowledge (or the means of knowledge) that the pallets were unsafe
for use in the unloading and/or shore-handling and/or transporting
and/or delivery of the bags of rice failed to give any (or any
adequate) warning to the third defendant of the unsafe condition of
the pallets and with the aforesaid knowledge caused and/or permitted
and/or authorised the pallets to be used by the third defendant for
the unloading of the rice. 

 In
evidence given on behalf of the plaintiff at an earlier hearing, it
was shown that in December 1973 a shipment of rice consisting of 6000
bags arrived on the ss Mabiri consigned to the plaintiff. Some 1472 bags of this shipment were
subsequently condemned by the port health department as unfit for
human consumption. Evidence was also adduced that the contamination
of the rice bags arose from a chemical on the pallets which were used
to unload and store them. 

 Mr
Peter Parker, the manager of the second defendant, stated in evidence
that on 18th December 1973 a cargo of weedkiller was discharged from
the vessel Brunsness and stored on the second defendant’s pallets because the shipper’s
pallets were defective. On 29th December 1973 the weedkiller was
transhipped in the vessel Dorothea Boltin .
 In both these operations the stevedores and the second defendant’s
employees claimed, and were paid, fringe benefits for working with an
irritant substance. The pallets on which the weedkiller had been
stored were set aside and Mr Parker gave certain instructions in
relation to them. On 28th December 1973 the ss Mabiri arrived and discharged its cargo of rice using the second defendant’s
pallets. 

 Mr
Parker described with the help of photographs exhibited in the case
the procedure in respect of the supply of pallets at the port. 
Pallets are brought alongside the ship by the second defendant’s
fork-lift drivers. Immediately the ship’s lifting gear is attached
to the pallet, it becomes the responsibility of the ship. On board,
the pallets are lowered directly into the hold to be laden by the
stevedores. Mr Parker’s further evidence is that the stevedoring
companies have no say in the allocation of the stevedoring gangs and
that it is the responsibility of the second defendant to see that
pallets are in good repair. 

 Mr
Jordan, an employee of the second defendant, who worked alongside the
ss Mabiri on 28th December 1973, had no knowledge that the contaminated pallets
had been set aside. He also said that if there was a little flour on
a pallet, he would allow it to go on board. 

 62 

 Mr
Waithe, an assistant shed manager employed by the second defendant in
1973, saw the unloading of the ss Mabiri and stated that the pallets were clearly visible in the hold of the
vessel, and presumably could be inspected by the stevedores. 

 Mr
Hassell, managing director of the third defendant, described the
relationship between the second and third defendants. According to
him, the second defendant provided gear and equipment for the third
defendant to unload ships. His foreman, Mr Osborne, stated that he
saw dust on the bags unloaded by the ss Mabiri and also on the pallet
sent back out of the hold by the stevedores. He described it as
looking like flour, with a dirty white colour. In this regard, it
may be recalled that the evidence was that the herbicide dust was
whitish in colour and could be mistaken for flour, cement, lime or
fertiliser. 

 Mr
David Simmons submitted that it was an implied term of the agreement
between the parties arising by reason of the course of dealing f the
parties that the second defendant would supply the third defendant
with pallets that were free from herbicide or other contaminating
agent. He cited The Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64 in which damage was caused to the plaintiffs vessel
moored at the defendant’s wharf. It was held that there was an
implied undertaking on the part of the defendants that they had taken
reasonable care to ascertain that the bed of the river was safe for
the vessel. 

 Mr
Dear, on the other hand, referred to Caledonian Railway Co v Mulholland [1898] AC 216 in which railway wagons belonging to the appellants
were used by another railway company, and the question arose whether
the appellants were under a duty to ensure that the wagons were in a
condition suitable for use by the other company. It was held in the
House of Lords that, on the facts of that case, no such duty arose. 
Mr Dear also referred to Chapman (or Oliver) v Saddler&amp;Co [1929] AC 584, another House of Lords decision. In this latter case,
Lord Atkin stated: 




‘ I
cannot agree with the opinion expressed below that the stevedores in
these circumstances were in the same legal position as though they
were gratuitous bailors. If such had been the relation simpliciter ,
I agree that the bailor would only have been liable for a defect
actually known to him. In the present case the porters were possibly
entrusted with the sling but merely to be used in a particular way,
to be returned forthwith to the bailors in an operation, the speedy
completion of which was of vital importance to the bailor’s
business, where bailor and bailee, to the knowledge of both, relied
for their safety on the care of the bailor.’ 




 Lord
Atkin distinguished Caledonian Railway Co v Mulholland on the ground that, in that case, the railway handed over trucks at
rest to another railway company for an indefinite detention with
ample opportunities for inspection. 

 In
my view, the instant case must be distinguished from the Caledonian 

 63 

 Railway case. The third defendant’s employees, even if they had an
opportunity to inspect the pallets supplied to them by the second
defendant, would have been unable, by visual inspection alone, to
distinguish weedkiller from flour, cement, lime or fertiliser,
materials normally found on the pallets supplied. There is no doubt
that the system of work adopted by the second and third defendants
was to their mutual financial advantage and depended on the provision
by the second defendant of safe working equipment. The pallets were
not safe according to the second defendant’s own admission when the
manager of the company ordered that they should be put to one side
and gave further directions about them. It is clear that his
instructions were not carried out and that by some unexplained
process they were back in use in the unloading of the Mabiri’s cargo. This constitutes negligence on the part of the second
defendant. It seems clear to me that the arrangement between the
parties is analogous to that in Oliver v Saddler [1929] AC 584 and required the second defendant to prevent the re-use
of the contaminated pallets until they could be cleansed, especially
as their re-use might attract a claim for “fringe benefits” by
the men who worked with them. I can find no negligence in the third
defendant and I hold the second defendant entirely responsible,
through its negligence, for the contamination of the shipment of rice
consigned to the plaintiff. 

 Order
accordingly.

 29TH
MAY 1978 

 Aviation
– Liability for damage – Liability independent of tort of
neglience – Successive carriers – Single operation –
Proceedings against first carrier – Indemnity by third party –
Warsaw Convention 1929, articles 1 (3), 30 

 The
plaintiff consigned garments to the defendant airline in the middle
of 1976 for transmission to Curaçao. Although the carriage was to
be performed by successive carriers, the conditions of carriage
stated that the carriage was to be regarded as a single operation. 
The garments were flown by the defendant to Trinidad and, after two
months, were handed over to the third party representing another
airline. The garments were uaccountably held by the third party for
an extended period and were eventually delivered to the consignee in
Curaçao too late for the Christmas season. The consignee refused to
accept the garments and the plaintiff sued the defendant for damages.
 The defendant issued a third-party notice claiming indemnity or a
contribution from the third party. The plaintiff was not able to
establish negligence on the part of the defendant. 

 Held - (1) Even though the plaintiff could not establish that the
defendant had been negligent, it could recover damages up to the
prescribed amount from the defendant since the conditions of carriage
stated that the carriage was to be regarded as a single operation
and, under articles 1 (3) and 30 of the Warsaw Convention, the
defendant was liable as the first carrier in the single operation. 

 (2)
Although the third party had no contractual relationship with the
defendant, it had been negligent in holding the garments for an
extended period; accordingly, it should indemnify the defendant for
the damages and costs awarded to the plaintiff. 

 No
cases were referred to the judgment. 

 Action 

 Action Yankee Garments Ltd, a garment manufacturer, instituted proceedings
in the Supreme Court (case 345 of 1977) against British West Indian
Airways Ltd for damages for loss occasioned by the refusal of a
consignee of garments to accept them on the ground of unreasonable 

 65 

 delay.
 Piarco Air Services Ltd was joined as third party on the application
of the defendant who sought an indemnity or a contribution from the
third party. The third party did not enter an appearance.

Moseley for the plaintiff 

 J
Dean QC (instructed by R G Mandeville&amp;Co) for the defendant 

 The
third party did not appear and was not represented. 

 Williams
J. The plaintiff is a local company carrying on business as
manufacturers and exporters of garments. The defendant is a company
registered in the Island and carries on the business of a common
carrier transporting goods and passengers by air into and out of the
Island. 

 This
action arises out of the consignment by the plaintiff of six cartons
of garments from the Island to Curaçao in mid-1976. Under the air
waybill the garments were to be transferred from Seawell to
Port-of-Spain by a flight by the defendant airline and from
Port-of-Spain to Curaçao by a Dutch Antillean Airlines (“ALM”)
flight. 

 The
case of the plaintiff is that the consignment consisted of fashion
garments specially made for the consignee in Curaçao as part of the
consignee’s 1976 Christmas stock. The garments were shipped at the
end of May 1976 but did not reach the consignee until the latter part
of January 1977, at which time the consignee refused to accept them. 
The plaintiff’s action against the defendant alleges negligence in
the defendant and the claim is for $8580 representing the value of
the goods plus 10 per cent insurance over value. 

 The
defendant sought and obtained leave to issue and serve a third party
notice on Piarco Air Services Ltd, the servant or agent of ALM in
Trinidad. In this notice the defendant claimed against Piarco Air
Services Ltd to be indemnified against the plaintiff’s claim and
costs of the action, or for a contribution to the extent and/or the
major share of the plaintiff’s claim, on the grounds that the third
party caused and/or contributed to the loss in the value of the
plaintiff’s goods due to the third party’s negligence and/or
delay in the carriage by air of the goods. No appearance was entered
for the third party. 

 The
negligence alleged against the defendant is as follows: 




‘ (a)
Failure to make any or any sufficient or effective arrangements for
the onward transportation of the plaintiff’s goods from Piarco,
Trinidad, to Curaçao so that the said goods should arrive at Curaçao
within a reasonable time. 

 (b)
Failure to give sufficient or any notification in good time to the
plaintiff that the onward transmission of the said goods from Piarco,
Trinidad, to Curaçao had been delayed. 

 (c)
Failure to locate the said goods at Piarco, Trinidad, within a
reasonable time after having been notified by the plaintiff on divers
occasions prior to 21st September 1976 that the said goods had not
reached Curaçao, the agreed ultimate destination of the goods.’ 




 66 

 There
can be no question about the defendant’s promptness in transporting
the goods to Trinidad. The air waybill is dated 31st May 1976 and
the goods were taken to Trinidad on the following day. The defendant
called as a witness Mr Rousseau, its mail and cargo officer at
Piarco, Trinidad. His evidence was that Piarco Air Services Ltd was
the agent for ALM as well as for Surinam Airways (“SLM”). He
testified that he was well acquainted with this case. The cargo
arrived in Trinidad on 1st June and was stored in the defendant’s
customs bond at Piarco for transfer to Piarco Air Services Ltd. It
was not until 9th August that he was able to hand it over to the
third party. He explained that ALM and SLM aircraft were small and
that no cargo was taken when the passenger capacity was fully
utilised. When there was room for cargo, priority was given to cargo
which ALM or SLM had for transhipment. Mr Rousseau’s evidence was
that he tried unsuccessfully to despatch the cargo to Curaçao before
9th August. He produced a copy of an SLM manifest showing that the
cargo was accepted for transport on SLM flight LM 942 of 11th August
1976. 

 On
this evidence, which is not contradicted, my view is that the first
allegation of negligence against the defendant has not been
substantiated; and I so find. 

 According
to the second allegation of negligence, the defendant failed to
notify the plaintiff of the delay in the onward transmission of the
goods from Piarco to Curaçao. But, according to Mr Rousseau, he got
the goods accepted for transfer on 9th August and they were
manifested out of Piarco on 11th August. This was just over two
months after arrival; and I find it difficult to find that within
that time the defendant should have given notice to the plaintiff. I
should also say that it is clear that if the goods had gone to
Curaçao on 11th August, the consignee would have had them in ample
time for Christmas display and sale. 

 With
respect to the third allegation of negligence, there is an
inconsistency in Mr Rousseau’s statements concerning the goods
after he had delivered them to the Piarco Air Services Ltd. In
evidence he said that in the latter part of the year he went over to
their bond to see about the transfer of other goods and he noticed
that the six packages which had been manifested out of Piarco on 11th
August were still there. He drew it to the attention of Mr Jemmott,
the manager, who was surprised that the packages were still there. A
letter from the defendant to the plaintiff of 30th March 1977
incorporated a report from Mr Rousseau to the effect that it was only
when the plaintiff’s managing director spoke to him on 21st January
1977 that he realised that the packages had probably been delayed at
Piarco. In my view, however, this inconsistency does not affect the
matter. The substance of the allegation is that on many occasions
prior to 21st September 1976 the plaintiff notified the defendant
that the goods had not reached Curaçao and the defendant failed to
locate the goods at Piarco within a reasonable time after such
notification. No adequate basis had been laid on which the court can
find negligence under this head. It is noted that according to 

 67 

 the
further and better particulars of the telephone calls supplied by the
plaintiff, in the period before 21st September 1976 two calls were
made a to the defendant’s cargo shed at Barbados, and the others
were made to Curaçao. No evidence was given concerning these two
calls. The calls to the defendant’s cargo shed at Piarco were made
early in 1977. 

 But
failure to prove negligence is not an end of the matter as far as the
defendant is concerned. There is an issue in this case as to the
relevance or application of the Warsaw Convention. Article 30 of the
convention provides as follows: 




‘ (1)
In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive
carriers and falling within the definition set out in the third
paragraph of article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage
or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this convention, and is
deemed to be one of the contracting parties to the contract of
carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the
carriage which is performed under his supervision. 

 (2)
In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his
representative can take action only against the carrier who performed
the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in
the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed
liability for the whole journey. 

 (3)
As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a
right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or
consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action
against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against
the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction,
loss, damage or delay took place. Those carriers will be jointly and
severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.’ 




 Article
1 (3) is as follows: 




‘ Carriage
to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the
purposes of this convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has
been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had
been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series
of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely
because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed
entirely within the territory of the same state.’ 




 In
this case under paragraph (1) of the conditions of contract it is
stated, “Carriage to be performed hereunder by several successive
carriers is regarded as a single operation”. Consequently, by
virtue of the combined effect of articles 30 and 1(3) the plaintiff,
the consignor of this cargo from Barbados to Curaçao, has a right of
action against the defendant, who was the first carrier. 

 As
it is put in Chitty on Contracts (24th Edn) Vol 2, paragraph 2745: 

 68 




‘ Successive
Carriers .
 If the carriage is performed by several successive carriers under
one undivided carriage as defined by the convention and the cargo
suffers destruction, loss, damage or delay, the consignor can sue the
first carrier, the consignee who is entitled to delivery can sue the
last carrier, and each may sue the carrier who performed the carriage
during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place.’ 




 And
at paragraph 2749, speaking of the carrier’s defences, it is said
that the carrier can escape liability by proving, in the case of
successive carriage, that he was neither the first carrier nor the
last carrier nor the carrier who performed the carriage during which
the destruction, loss, damage or delay occurred. 

 As
to quantum paragraph (4) of the conditions of contract is relevant. It states: 




‘ Except
as the convention or other applicable law may otherwise require (a)
carrier is not liable to the shipper or to any other person for any
damage, delay or loss of whatsoever nature (hereinafter collectively
referred to as ‘damage’) arising out of or in connection with the
carriage of the goods, unless such damage is proved to have been
caused by the negligence or wilful fault of carrier and there has
been no contributory negligence of the shipper, consignee or other
claimant; ... (c) the charges for carriage having been based upon the
value declared by the shipper, it is agreed that any liability shall
in no event exceed the shipper’s declared value for carriage stated
on the face hereof and in the absence of such declaration by shipper,
liability of carrier shall not exceed 250 such gold francs or their
equivalent per kilogram of goods destroyed, lost, damaged or delayed;
all claims shall be subject to proof of value ...’ 




 As
indicated above, the combined effect of articles 30 and 1(3) of the
convention imposed liability on the defendant irrespective of any
negligent or wilful act on its part. As far as quantum is concerned,
the plaintiff having declared on the air waybill the value of the
goods as US $3900 is entitled to recover up to that amount from the
defendant. This is pursuant to article 22(2) ( a )
of the convention which states: 




‘ In
the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the
carrier is limited to a sum of 250 francs per kilogram, unless the
passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was
handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in
delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case
so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum
not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is
greater than the passenger’s or consignor’s actual interest in
delivery at destination.’ 




 Judgement
then is given for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of
Barbados $7800 and costs to be taxed. The only remaining 

 69 

 question
relates to the third party and the indemnity and/or contribution
sought by the defendant. 

 The
third party was not a carrier but the servant or agent of a carrier. 
There can therefore be no question of any contractual liability on
its part to either the plaintiff or the defendant. Any liability on
the part of the third party would have to be in tort and on the
establishment of a duty of care owed to the person seeking to
establish liability. The third party entered no appearance and took
no part in the proceedings and thus no opportunity was taken to
contest any such issue. 

 On
the evidence led by the defendant, and which has not been contested,
the goods were unaccountably kept at the third party’s bond for an
extended period and the manager of the bond was himself surprised
when it was discovered that they had not been sent to Curaçao. My
finding is that there was negligence on the part of the third party’s
employees and my order is for the defendant to be indemnified by the
third party of respect of the damages and costs payable hereunder by
the defendant to the plaintiff. 

 Orders
accordingly.

COURT OF BARBADOS

 7TH
JUNE 1978 

 Will
– Construction – Gift to children – To “all my children in
equal shares for their absolute use” – Child dying before will
executed – Natural meaning of words of bequest – Intention of
testator – Succession Act 1975, No 46 [B], section 83 

 In
1967 the testator (who was aware that his daughter S had died
previously) made a will containing a gift to “all my children in
equal shares for their absolute use”. The testator died in 1976)
and his executor took out a summons to determine whether S’s
children were entitled to share in the gift in accordance with
section 83 of the Succession Act 1975. 

 Held - The words used by the testator did not include a child who had died
before the execution of the will; accordingly, there was no gift to S
under the will and the provisions of section 83 were not applicable.

 Originating 

 Originating
summons James Archibald Laurence Worme, the sole executor of the will of
Laurence Archibald Worme (deceased), applied to the Supreme Court
(case 519 of 1977) for the determination of the question whether
Dudley Hamilton Barrow O’Neal, Leslie Anthony O’Neal and Sheila
Joycelyn O’Neal were beneficially interested in a gift under the
testator’s will. The defendants were the surviving daughters of
the testator (Dorothy Ada Cook, Brenda Edith Proverbs and Sylvia
Laurence Allen) and the three members of the O’Neal family; the
first named of whom had been married to Sheila Audrey O’Neal, a
daughter of the testator who had died in 1957; and the other O’Neals
were the children of that marriage.

 The
other defendants did not appear and were not represented. 

 Worrell
J. This is a summons by James Archibald Laurence Worme, the sole
executor of the will of Laurence Archibald Worme, deceased. In it he
seeks the court’s determination of the question: 




‘ Whether
in the events which have happened the defendants, Dudley Hamilton
Barrow O’Neal, Leslie Anthony O’Neal and Sheila Joycelyn O’Neal
are beneficially interested and entitled under the said will; and if
so, what is the share of the estate of the deceased to which each of
them is respectively entitled?’ 




 When
this summons came on for hearing, Sylvia Laurence Allen was the only
defendant represented. The other defendants did not enter
appearance; nor were they present or represented at the hearing. 

 Laurence
Archibald Worme (“the testator”), died on 23rd April 1976. In
his will, dated 13th September 1967, he made the following direction: 




‘ I
give devise bequeath and appoint all my estate and property be the
same real personal or mixed and whether in possession reversion
remainder or expectancy and whether situate in this Island or
elsewhere unto my wife Edith Hutson Worme for her absolute use but in
the event of my said wife predeceasing me then I give devise bequeath
and appoint the same unto all my children in equal shares for their
absolute use.’ 




 The
testator’s wife, Edith Hutson Worme, died during his lifetime. He
had five children, namely James Archibald Laurence Worme, Dorothy Ada
Cook, Brenda Edith Proverbs, Sylvia Laurence Allen and Sheila Audrey
O’Neal. Of these children four only were living at the date of the
execution of the will. These survived the testator. Sheila, who had
been married to the defendant Dudley Hamilton O’Neal, died in this
Island on 23rd January 1957; and it is shown in the affidavits filed
that the testator was fully aware of this. At her death Sheila left
issue, namely Leslie Anthony O’Neal and Sheila Joycelyn O’Neal. 
These survived the testator. 

 Mr
Williams for the plaintiff submitted that, the gift in the will to
the testator’s children being a class gift, it would appear that by
virtue of section 83 of the Succession Act 1975 the issue of the
deceased child Sheila are entitled to her share of the gift under the
will. He pointed to the similarity of expressions used in section 83
of the Succession Act and the former section 29 of the Wills Act, Cap
111, and contended that the fact that Sheila died approximately ten
years before the date of the execution of the will was immaterial
since section 83 speaks of a child who dies in the lifetime of the
testator. He referred to section 33 of the Wills Act 1937 [UK] and
the cases Mower v Orr (1849) 7 Hare 473 and Wisden v Wisden (1854) 2 Sm&amp;G 396, and he argued that by analogy support for
his contention can be found in the cases referred to. 

 72 

 Mr
Williams’s final submission was that, unless there was a contrary
intention shown in the will, the gift to the deceased child Sheila
should go to her issue who survived the testator. 

 Mr
Allen, for the defendant Sylvia Laurence Allen, submitted that from
the language used in the will the testator never intended a gift to
the deceased child Sheila. He cited Gorringe v Mahlstedt [1907] AC 225. He argued that, since it was a class gift, only the
children of the testator who survived him should benefit under the
will; and he contended that section 83 of the Succession Act did not
apply to the circumstances of this case. 

 As
I see it, prior to the passing of the Succession Act 1975, the
general principle of law applicable to class gifts of this nature was
that a devise or bequest to children as a class distributable at the
death of some other person vested in all the children in existence at
the death of the testator. In a case where one of the members of the
class died in the lifetime of the testator, strictly speaking there
was no lapse since members of the class antecedently dying were not
objects of the gift. However, section 83 of the Succession Act
modified this general principle of law in that it extended the class
of persons who might benefit under class gifts by including the
living issue of a member of that class who pre-deceased the testator.
 Section 83 of the Succession Act 1975 reads as follows: 




‘ Where
a person, being a child or other issue of the testator to whom any
property is given (whether by a devise or bequest or by the exercise
by will of a power of appointment, and whether as a gift to that
person as an individual or as a member of a class) for any estate or
interest not determinable at or before the death of that person, dies
in the lifetime of the testator leaving issue, and any such issue of
that person is living at the time of the death of the testator, the
gift shall not lapse, but shall take effect as if the death of that
person had happened immediately after the death of the testator,
unless a contrary intention appears from the will.’ 




 However,
before turning to the provisions of this section to ascertain its
effect on the will, it will be necessary to dispose of the
preliminary question, “who are the persons that it was intended to
benefit under the will?”. It is for this reason that the cases Mower v Orr (1849) 7 Hare 473 and Wisden v Wisden (1854) 2 Sm&amp;G 396 cannot be regarded as authority for the
proposition (put forward by counsel for the plaintiff in the instant
case) that the fact that one of the children of the testator died
before the date of the will is immaterial. 

 It
must be observed that the decisions in these cases turned on a
construction of the words in section 33 of the Wills Act 1837 [UK]. 
Corresponding provisions were contained in the former section 29 of
the Wills Act, Cap 111, and are now re-enacted in section 83 of the
Succession Act 1975 to include class gifts for the first time. In
each of those cases a testator had a son who lived abroad. He made a
devise to the son nominatim .
 It so transpired that at the date of the execution of the will 

 73 

 the
son was already dead. It was held that the words of section 33 of
the Act were very comprehensive and seemed to include a devise to any
child who should die at any time in a testator’s lifetime, and that
the living issue of the deceased son was entitled to benefit under
the will. 

 In
considering what answer I should give to the question raised in the
summons, I have to examine the will with a view to ascertaining the
meaning to be attached to the words used by the testator. A passage
taken from the judgment of the Earl of Halsbury in the case Gorringe v Mahlstedt [1907] AC 225 will afford some guidance as to how this task should be
approached. This is what he said: 




‘ Unless
there is something in the context of a will which prevents the
ordinary and proper construction of the words in their natural
meaning, I believe that any court ought to adhere to that meaning and
to give effect to it.’ 




 In
the instant case, if the words “all my children in equal shares for
their absolute use” are to be given their natural meaning, it
appears from these words that the testator used language of such
restricted import as to be inapplicable to any children but such as
were living at his death. In my view these words mean precisely what
they say. They do not include a child who was dead at the date of
the execution of the will. Furthermore, there is the
well-established canon of construction that testators do not make
bequests in favour of persons whom they know to be dead. Authority
in support of this may be found in the judgment of Viscount Simon in Mackintosh v Gerrard [1947] AC 461 at page 466 where he said: 




‘ Granted
that, alike by English and Scots law, a will, ‘speaks from death’,
we are entitled, and indeed bound, for the purpose of giving the
proper meaning to the words used, to consider the family situation
when the settlement was made. At that date, as already stated, the
testatrix had six sisters living, and I cannot entertain any doubt
that when she directed her trustees to divide the residue of her
estate ‘equally between my sisters’, her words meant that if
these six sisters were living at her death each would receive a
one-sixth part. It is, in my opinion, inconceivable that she
intended her dead sister to be counted among ‘my sisters’: a
bequest to a person known to be dead seems to me to be an absurdity. 
As Lord Cockburn said in Sturrock v Binny (1843) 6 Dunl (Ct of Sess) 117 (where a testator provided that the
residue of his estate ‘shall belong equally to all my nephews and
nieces’): ‘How is it possible that the testator ... could
describe Isabel who was dead as one of his nephews and nieces?’.’ 




 Applying
these canons of construction and having regard to the family
situation at the date of the execution of the will, it cannot be said
that the testator by the words he has used intended to make a gift to
a child who was dead at the date of the execution of the will. I am
therefore of the opinion that there was no gift to the deceased child
Sheila under the 

 74 

 will.
 In the absence of any such gift, the provisions of section 83 of the
Succession Act 1975 will not apply. 

 On
the evidence before me I propose to answer the question in the
summons by saying that none of the persons mentioned in the question
is beneficially interested or entitled under the will of the
testator. In accordance with the established practice in matters of
this kind, the costs of all parties will be borne by the estate. The
costs to be taxed as between attorney-at-law and client. 

 Order
accordingly.

 16TH

 Highways
– Blackguarding – Meaning of “blackguard” – Highways Act,
Cap 289 [B], section 44(1) 

 The
offence of blackguarding under the Highways Act, section 44(1),
involves the use of coarse and vulgar language which has the effect
of annoying lawful users of the highway or disturbing their free
passage on it; proof of the offence does not involve consideration of
whether the language was heard by passers-by or was likely to result
in the denigration of any person in the minds of the hearers. 

 Case
referred to in the judgment 

 Brutus
v Cozens [1973] AC 854, [1972] 2 All ER 1297, [1972] 3 WLR 521, HL 

 Appeal 

 Appeal Doreen Redman appealed to the Divisional Court of Barbados (case 14
of 1978) against the dismissal by a magistrate of an information
brought by her against the respondent, Janette Thorne, charging her
with blackguarding, contrary to the Highways Act, section 44(1). 

 E
Mottley for the appellant 

 R
Cheltenham for the respondent 

 Sir
William Douglas CJ. This is an appeal from an order by a magistrate sitting at District
“A” dismissing an information brought by the appellant charging
the respondent with blackguarding, contrary to section 44(1) of the
Highways Act. 

 In
the evidence at the trial, the appellant said that at 9.30 a m on
17th May 1977 she was on Tichborne Road, St Michael, and she saw the
respondent coming up the road. She said there was some talk about
children, and that the respondent said to her “You are a worthless
married whore fucking all about”. The respondent denied using
those words. 

 The
magistrate gives the following reasons for dismissing the case: 




‘ For
the offence to be committed the court considers it necessary to
establish not only that some foul and scurrilous language was used
and 

 76 

 that
the informant felt bad but that: (1) the words were said in a loud
offensive manner; (2) persons were about who heard the language. The
court considers (2) an essential, for certainly the informant must as
a result of the words, suffer or be likely to suffer denigration in
minds of the hearers.’ 




 Mr
Mottley on behalf of the appellant submitted that the magistrate
misdirected himself in applying the requirements of civil slander to
the offence. Dr Cheltenham submitted that the words spoken must be
heated, noisy and vulgar to constitute a breach of the peace. 

 Section
44(1) of the Highways Act provides: 




‘ Any
person who on or near a highway or in any public place, or on or near
to any road over which the public are allowed to pass, makes use of
obscene or indecent language or blackguards, swears, quarrels or
makes or causes to be made any disturbance or annoying noise may be
apprehended without warrant by a justice of the peace, police
constable or parish constable and shall be liable on conviction
before a magistrate of the district to a fine of ten dollars or to
imprisonment for one month: 

 Provided
always that if the magistrate upon the hearing of any such charge
deems the offence to be so trifling as not to merit any punishment he
shall dismiss the information and shall on such dismissal, if he
deems fit, require the costs of the proceedings to be paid by the
informant.’ 




 Counsel
put forward various definitions of the term “blackguards” found
in different dictionaries. We do not think that recourse to
dictionaries is particularly helpful in construing this section. As
Lord Reid pointed out in Brutus v Cozens [1972] 3 WLR 521 at page 525: 




‘ When
considering the meaning of a word one often goes to a dictionary. 
There one finds other words set out. And if one wants to pursue the
matter and find the meaning of those other words the dictionary will
give the meaning of those other words in still further words which
often include the word for whose meaning one is searching... But we
have been warned time and again not to substitute other words for the
words of a statute. And there is very good reason for that. Few
words have exact synonyms. The overtones are almost always
different.’ 




 In
our view the meaning of the word “blackguards”, which is a term
in common usage in Barbados, is perfectly clear; and the ordinary,
sensible Barbadian would have no difficulty in knowing blackguarding
language when he hears it. He might be hard put to find a close
approximation because, although it usually involves abusing somebody
in scurrilous terms, it has a connotation of its own as pertaining to
the dregs of the community and to low, worthless persons. 

 The
magistrate seems to have treated the charge as a sort of summary, 

 77 

 poor
person’s, slander action in holding that the complainant had to
prove that there were persons about who heard the language and that,
as a result of the words, she has suffered or is likely to suffer
denigration in the minds of the hearers. We think that that is a
strained interpretation of the provisions of the section. 

 In
our judgment, a court must have regard to the objects of the statute;
in this case, to ensure the free passage of persons on the highway
without danger, molestation or annoyance. Further, the word
“blackguards” must be construed in the context of section 44 as
being in pari materia with “makes use of obscene or indecent language”, “swears”,
“quarrels”, and “makes or causes to be made any disturbance or
annoying noise”. Thus it must involve coarse and vulgar language
which will have the effect of annoying lawful users of the highway or
disturbing their free passage on the highway. 

 The
magistrate made no findings of fact. He did not, for instance,
determine whether the words complained of had been spoken, and if so,
whether the conduct before the court fell within the meaning of
section 44(1); this latter also being a question of fact (see Brutus v Cozens ).
 We are of opinion that he fell into error in importing into this
section concepts which properly belong in the civil law relating to
slander. To this extent he misdirected himself. We shall set aside
the order for dismissal and remit the case to the magistrate to be
reheard and re-determined in the light of the interpretation of
section 44(1) of the Highways Act which we have set out in this
judgment. The appellant will have her costs ($35). 

 Appeal
allowed. 

 Case
remitted for rehearing.

 Bushell
v Chefette Restaurants Ltd And Another 

 HIGH
COURT OF BARBADOS 

 SIR
WILLIAM DOUGLAS CJ 

 19TH
JUNE 1978 

 Insurance
– Employers liability – Liability arising in course of employment
– Employee receiving lift in employer’s vehicle – Accident for
which employer vicariously liable – No obligation to travel in
employer’s vehicle 

 Insurance
– Motor insurance – Liability for passenger carried under
contract of employment – Employee receiving lift in employer’s
vehicle – Accident for which employer vicariously liable - Meaning
of “by reason by ... contract of employment” 

 The
second defendant was employed by the company as the manager of a
restaurant. He had the use of a van owned by the company to deposit
the takings from the restaurant at a bank. The staff of the
restaurant were given lifts in the van. Although the company knew of
the lifts and approved the practice of giving them, it was not under
any obligation to provide transport for its staff to and from the
restaurant; nor were the staff obliged to travel in the van. The
company had taken out two policies of insurance. Under an employers’
liability policy it was entitled to indemnity if any employee
sustained injury, etc “arising out of and in the course of his
employment”. The van was insured under a commercial vehicle policy
which specified, inter alia, the van’s registration mark and gave
its seating capacity as two. The latter policy excluded from cover
death or injury to “any person (other than a passenger carried by
reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment) being carried
in ... the motor vehicle”. The uses to which the vehicle might be
put under the commercial vehicle policy was described under a heading
“Limitations as to Use” which permitted the use of the van on the
company’s business, but imposed no restriction as to the number of
passengers. Early one morning the deceased and a number of other
members of the restaurant staff boarded the van which was to take the
restaurant’s takings to the bank. The second defendant was the
driver. It was raining. On the journey the vehicle skidded and
crashed. The deceased was injured and died. The second defendant,
apart from stating that the road was wet, offered no explanation for
the skid. The administrator of the deceased’s estate instituted
proceedings for negligence against the company and the second
defendant. The insurers were joined as third parties and the court
was asked, in the event of finding negligence, whether the insurers
had any obligation to 

 79 

 indemnify
the company and the second defendant. 

 Held - (1) The second defendant was, in the absence of any explanation for
the skid, liable for the death of the deceased and, in the
circumstances, the company was vicariously liable for his negligence. 

 Ormrod
v Crossville Motor Services Ltd [1953] 2 All ER 753 and Richley v Faull [1965] 3 All 109 applied. 

 (2)
There was no entitlement to indemnity under the employers’
liability policy since the deceased was not obliged to travel the
company’s van and hence was not acting in the course of her
employment at the time of the accident. 

 Vandyke
v Fender [1970] 2 All ER 335 applied. 

 (3)
Although the commercial vehicle policy stated that the seating
capacity of the van was two persons, this reference was merely
descriptive of the vehicle and, as it did not appear under the
heading “Limitations as to Use”, it could not restrict the ambit
of the company’s concession of travel facilities to its staff;
moreover, the expression “by reason of ... a contract of
employment” (being wider in scope than the expression “in the
course of employment”) brought the deceased within the scope of the
commercial vehicle policy; accordingly, the liability of the company
and the second defendant was covered by that policy.

 Action 

 Action Fitzgerland Bushell, the administrator of the estate of Corene Yvette
Butcher (deceased), instituted proceedings in the High Court of
Barbados (case 515 of 1977) against Chefette Restaurants Ltd (“the
company”) and Sherwin Gilkes (the second defendant) under the Fatal
Accidents Act and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. By
consent of the parties, Barbados Fire and General Accident Insurance
Co and General Accident Fire and Life Insurance Corporation Ltd were
joined as third parties. 

 D
Simmons (instructed by Smith&amp;Smith) for the plaintiff 

 J
Dear QC and T Carmichael for the company and Barbados Fire 

 J
Connell for the second defendant 

 H
Moseley for General Accident 

 Sir
William Douglas CJ. This is an action by the administrator of the estate of Corene
Yvette Butcher, deceased, who died as a result of a motor vehicle
accident on 13th September 1976, brought under the provisions of the
Fatal Accidents Act and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act. The deceased was a passenger in a van owned by the first
defendant (“the company”) and driven by the second defendant. It
is alleged that the accident was caused by the second defendant’s
negligence. 

 By
its amended defence, the company admits that the deceased was a
passenger in the van on 13th September 1976, but denies that the
second defendant was acting in the course of his employment or was
its agent when he was driving the van. There is a denial of
neligence on behalf of both the company and the second defendant. 

 The
third parties were joined by consent of all the parties. The first
third party, Barbados Fire and General Insurance Co (“Barbados
Fire”), are insurers of certain liabilities of the company under an
employers’ liability policy. The second third party, General
Accident Fire and Life Insurance Corporation Ltd (“General
Accident”) are insurers of certain liabilities of the company under
a comprehensive commercial vehicle policy. In the event that the
plaintiff succeeds on the issue of negligence and agency, the court
is asked to determine the obligations, if any, of the third parties
under the provisions of the policies mentioned above. 

 The
deceased was employed as a cashier by the company which owns a
restaurant at Rockley, Christ Church, and other restaurants in the
city and at Fontabelle. At 1.50 on the morning of 13th September
1976 she boarded her employer’s van at Rockley, along with other
members of the staff. The second defendant, who at the relevant date
was an assistant manager at the Chefette restaurant at Rockley, drove
the van. Mr Philip Hinds, one of five employees in the van describes
what happened in these terms: 

 81 




‘ ...
van drove off towards Bridgetown. Bend near Accra Beach Hotel. Rain
was falling. We were coming down. When we got in the corner, I felt
the van move like a home-made scooter hitting a rock and skidding
across the road. I heard a crash. I heard voices. Next thing I
remember I was in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.’ 




 Constable
Miller’s evidence is that when he went to the scene on the morning
of 13th September he saw the deceased lying on the floor of the van,
appearing to be trapped. She was taken to hospital and it was seen
that she was bleeding from her head. It is pleaded (and not denied)
that she died the same day from her injuries. 

 In
giving evidence on his own behalf, the second defendant describes the
accident thus: 




‘ As
I approached the bend in the road by Ascanio’s restaurant, the road
was wet. It was raining. I was travelling at 20 mph when the rear
of the van started to skid to its left and struck the left-side kerb.
 As a result of the collision with the kerb, I completely lost
control of the steering. The van travelled across the road to the
right. It happened suddenly and collided with a guard-wall. Of
course I tried to get it under control but it was so sudden. I heard
a loud crash. 

 Next
time I remember I was in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.’ 




 The
second defendant ascribed the skid to the condition of the road; but
apart from its being wet, there is no evidence about the road surface
to support the second defendant’s explanation. 

 The
foregoing is the evidence led on the issue of negligence. Mr Simmons
submitted that on this evidence the plaintiff had proved negligence. 
He cited Richley v Faull [1965] 3 All ER 109 in support. In that case, the defendant’s car
suddenly went into a violent skid and came into collision with
another vehicle on its proper side of the road. After referring to Laurie v Raglan Building Co Ltd [1941] 3 All ER 332, MacKenna J observed: 




‘ I,
of course, agree that where the respondents’ lorry strikes the
plaintiff on the pavement or, as in the present case, moves on to the
wrong side of the road into the plaintiff’s path, there is a prima
facie case of negligence, and that this case is not displaced merely
by proof that the defendant’s car skidded. It must be proved that
the skid happened without the defendant’s default. But I
respectfully disagree with the statement that the skid by itself is
neutral. I think that the unexplained and violent skid is in itself
evidence of negligence.’ 




 In
the instant case it is clear that the accident was caused by the van
suddenly skidding, striking the left kerb and then going out of
control across the carriageway. The second defendant’s
explanation, apart from his saying that the road was wet, is no
explanation at all. The result is that all the evidence points to
the accident being caused by a sudden, violent and unexplained skid,
which is (without more) evidence of 

 82 

 negligence.
 On the issue of negligence the plaintiff must, therefore, succceed
as against the second defendant. 

 I
turn now to the question of whether the company is vicariously liable
for the second defendant’s negligence. In order to resolve that
issue, enquiry must be made whether in driving the van the second
defendant was acting as the servant or agent of the company. 

 Mr
Haloute, the company’s managing director, gave evidence of the
second defendant’s duties. He said that after the restaurant at
Rockley closed at night, either the manager or assistant manager was
required to carry the day’s taking to a bank in Bridgetown. He
could do so either in his own car or by using the company’s van. 
If he used the van, he had to return it to Rockley. The vehicle was
not available to him to get to and from work; that is, it was not
open to him to taken the van home. This is supported by the second
defendant’s own evidence that his duties included transporting the
day’s takings to the bank. It is common ground that on the night
of the accident the second defendant drove the van for the purpose of
depositing the day’s takings in a bank in Bridgetown and that the
accident occurred on that journey. 

 In
dealing with the vicarious liability of owners of motor vehicles,
Denning LJ said in Ormrod v Crossville Motor Services Ltd [1953] 2 All ER 753 at page 755: 




‘ The
law puts an especial responsibility on the owner of a vehicle who
allows it to go on the road in charge of someone else, no matter
whether it is his servant, his friend, or anyone else. If it is used
wholly or partly on the owner’s business or for the owner’s
purposes, the owner is liable for any negligence on the part of the
driver. The owner only escapes liability when he lends it or hires
it to a third person to be used for purposes in which the owner has
no interest or concern ...’ 




 In
the instant case there is no question but that the van was being used
on the company’s business, and I hold that in driving it the second
defendant was acting as the company’s agent. 

 I
turn now to the consideration of the question whether, in offering
lifts to the company’s employees, the second defendant was acting
in the course of his employment. In his evidence, Mr Haloute stated
that his staff were members of a union and that their terms and
conditions of employment were regulated by agreement between his
company and the union. Under that agreement there was no obligation
on the company to transport employees to or from their places of
work. On the other hand, he knew that lifts were given to employees
in the company’s van, and the giving of lifts was discussed at a
meeting of managers of the company and, according to the second
defendant, approved. Mr Haloute said: 




‘ The
only reason I extended the facility was because of the union issue
They were pressing for the company to supply transport after 

 83 

 hours.
 I can’t tell you how often it was done. It was being done. That
was known to management.’ 




 And
the second defendant said: 




‘ The
van was not really used as a passenger van. After balancing, I would
take staff members while travelling to the bank and give them lifts
along the route if they so desired.’ 




 In
my view, this is a far cry from the sort of case where the issue is
whether the driver is or is not authorised to take passengers in his
vehicle, eg Twine v Bean’s Express Ltd [1946] 1 All ER 202 or Conway v George Wimpey&amp;Co Ltd [1951] 1 All ER 363 where the drivers were expressly forbidden to
carry unauthorised persons as passengers in their vehicles. Indeed,
the plaintiff in the instant case is in a stronger position than the
plaintiff in Young v Edward Box&amp;Co Ltd [1951] 1 TLR 789 where, in accordance with a practice which had
existed for a number of Sunday evenings (when the public omnibus
service was crowded), the plaintiff and follow workmen were given a
lift on one of the defendants’ lorries with the consent of his
foreman and of the driver of the lorry. The Court of Appeal held
that the defence that the plaintiff was a trespasser on the lorry
failed. Somervell and Singleton LJJ so held on the ground that the
right to give the plaintiff leave to ride on the lorry was within the
ostensible authority of the foreman, and that the plaintiff was
entitled to rely on that authority and, in that respect, was a
licensee; Denning LJ on the ground that the driver was acting in the
course of his employment in giving the plaintiff a lift and thereby
made his employers liable. 

 A
large number of authorities on vicarious liability were reviewed in Rose v Plenty [1976] 1 WLR 141. In discussing the general principle of vicarious
liability, Scarman LJ observed (at page 147): 




‘ I
think it important to realise that the principle of vicarious
liability is one of public policy. It is not a principle which
derives from a critical or refined consideration of other concepts in
the common law, for example the concept of trespass or indeed the
concept of agency. No doubt in particular cases it may be relevant
to consider whether a particular plaintiff was or was not a
trespasser. Similarly, when, as I shall indicate, it is important
that one should determine the course of employment of the servant,
the law of agency may have some marginal relevance. But basically,
as I understand it, the employer is made vicariously liable for the
tort of his employee not because the plaintiff is an invitee, nor
because of the authority possessed by the servant, but because it is
a case in which the employer, having put matters into motion, should
be liable if the motion that he has originated leads to damage to
another.’ 




 In
the instant case, no problem arises necessitating an enquiry whether
or not the giving of lifts to employees was within the course of the 

 84 

 second
defendant’s employment. Not only did the company put the second
defendant in the position to drive the van, but also to give lifts to
the company’s employees. Indeed the company, as a matter of
policy, approved the practice of giving lifts to its employees. It
was in the company’s interest to do so, and the second defendant in
giving the deceased a lift on the night of the accident was carrying
out the company’s policy and acting in furtherance of the
particular purposes which the company assumed so far as their
employees were concerned. In those circumstances the company is
vicariously liable for the negligence of the second defendant. 

 There
remains the question of whether either of the third parties is under
obligation to indemnify the company and the second defendant, or
either of them. Under their employers’ liability policy with the
company, Barbados Fire must indemnify the company if any employee
sustains injury” ... arising out of and in the course of his
employment”. General Accident’s commercial vehicle policy with
the company contains the following exception: 




‘ [General
Accident] shall not be liable in respect of ... (ii) death of or
bodily injury to any person in the employment of the [company]
arising out of and in the course of employment; (iii) death of or
bodily injury to any person (other than a passenger carried by reason
of or in pursuance of a contract of employment) being carried in or
upon or entering or getting on to or alighting from the motor vehicle
at the time of the occurrence of the event out of which any claim
arises.’ 




 In
order to establish liability in Barbados Fire to indemnify the
company under its employers’ liability policy, it must be shown
that the deceased’s travelling in the company’s van arose out of
and in the course of her employment. The evidence is that the
deceased was employed as a cashier, that the company was under no
obligation to provide transport for the deceased, and that the
deceased was under no obligation to travel in the company’s van on
leaving the company’s premises. 

 In Vandyke v Fender [1970] 2 All ER 335 at page 340, Lord Denning MR stated: 




‘ The
words injury ‘arising out of and in the course of his employment’
were used in the old Workmen’s Compensation Acts from 1897 to 1945.
 The selfsame words have been used in the Road Traffic Acts 1930 and
1960. They have also been used in employers’ liability policies. 
In my opinion they should receive the same interpretation in all
three places for they are all so closely connected that they ought,
as a matter of common sense, to receive the same interpretation in
each. The words were construed and applied in thousands of cases
under the Workmen’s Compensation Acts and I think we should follow
those cases. The two leading cases, most apposite for present
purposes, are St Helen’s Colliery Co Ltd v Hewitson [1923] All ER Rep 249 and Weaver v Tredegar Iron and Coal Co Ltd 

 85 

 [1940]
3 All ER 157. They show, to my mind quite conclusively, that when a
man is going to or going from work, along a public road, as a
passenger in a vehicle provided by his employer, he is not then in
the course of his employment - unless he is obliged by the terms of his employment to travel in that vehicle. It is not
enough that he should have the right to travel in the vehicle, or be
permitted to travel in it. He must have an obligation to travel in it. Else he is not in the course of his employment ...’ 




 Applying
the law thus set out to the facts of the instant case, Barbados Fire
is under no obligation to indemnify the company in respect of any
claim arising out of the death of the deceased. 

 In
regard to General Accident’s commercial vehicle policy, Mr Moseley
conceded that the law provides adequately for avoiding a policy in
section 9 of the Motor Vehicles Insurance Act. He submitted that
unless the court found that the death of the deceased was as a result
of her being carried by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of
employment, General Accident was not liable to indemnify the company
nor the second defendant, having regard to exception (iii) in the
commercial vehicle policy set out above. 

 Counsel
cited Baker v Provident Accident&amp;White Cross Insurance Co [1959] 2 All ER 690. In that case, the owners of a laundry had given
permission to their employees to travel on their vans to B and no
further. It was held that, beyond B, the plaintiff was not riding in
the van as a passenger with the permission or authority of the
employers. The carriage of the plaintiff beyond that point was not
therefore a carriage by reason of or in pursuance of her contract of
employment; and the insurance company incurred no liability under the
policy. In the case before me, there is no question of the deceased
travelling beyond the limits of the transport facilities authorised
by the employers. But Mr Moseley argued, by analogy, that there was
a limitation in the policy as to the number of passengers that the
van could carry and that the company’s concession of transport
facilities to its staff must be limited by the terms of the policy. 

 In
considering this far-reaching submission I remind myself of the
approach adopted by Vaughan Williams LJ in Re Etherington and Lancashire&amp;Yorkshire Accident Insurance Co [1908-10] All ER Rep 581 at page 584 where he said: 




‘ There
is one other word I wish to say before I try to construe this policy,
and that is this - that one must not construe it merely in reference
to this particular case. One must recollect that this sort of
document is regularly issued by insurance companies to persons who
are desirous of effecting insurances against accidents, and one must
consider where the construction which is urged upon us on behalf of
the insurance company would lead if we were to adopt it.’ 




 The
limitation urged by Mr Moseley appears in the schedule under 

 86 

 the
head ‘Motor Vehicle: Any of the following:–...” Under the
sub-heads “registration mark”, “make” and “carrying or
seating capacity including driver” appear the entries “M.8383”,
“Ford Transit 130 Van” and “2”. Further on under the head
“Limitations as to Use” appear the following entries: 




‘ Use
in connection with the [company’s] business 

 Use
for social domestic and pleasure purposes 

 The
Policy does not cover (1) Use for hire or reward racing pacemaking
reliability trial or speed testing. (2) Use whilst drawing a trailer
except the towing of any one disabled mechanically propelled
vehicle.’ 




 I
do not construe these entries as being capable of bearing the
interpretation contended for by Mr Moseley. The entries under “Motor
Vehicle ...” are merely descriptive of the vehicle in respect of
which the policy is issued. There is nothing in the “Limitations
as to Use” which in any way restricts the number of passengers to
be carried in the van, an exception which could have been provided
for in the policy (see Hardy Ivamy, Fire
and Motor Insurance (3rd Edn) page 242). 

 Having
disposed of this argument, I need only point out that exception (iii)
above in the commercial vehicle policy avails nothing to General
Accident. There is clear authority in Izzard v Universal Insurance Co Ltd [1937] 3 All ER 79 and Vandyke v Fender [1970] 2 All ER 335 to support the proposition that the deceased was
being carried “by reason of a contract of employment”. In the
latter case, Lord Denning MR stated (at page 341): 




‘ Those
words [by reason, etc] are much wider than the words ‘in the course
of his employment’. I think that passengers are carried in a
vehicle ‘by reason of’ a contract of employment whenever such a
contract is the cause, or one of the causes, of their being carried.’ 




 In
my view, the deceased came within the exception to the exception, and
General Accident cannot escape its obligation to the company and the
second defendant by seeking to. rely on exception (iii) in the
commercial vehicle policy. 

 Sir
William Douglas CJ then (referring to Cookson v Knowles [1977] 2 All ER 820) dealt with damages, which had been agreed, and
interest.

 Equity
– Licensee of land – Money expended in improvements –
Expenditure to the knowledge of the owner of land – Equity of
licensee – Right of occupation – Extension of equity to
licensee’s widow after his death 

 H
owned a parcel of land on which a wall house had been erected. The
house was rebuilt by H’s son-in-law, LB, largely at his own expense
and in the knowledge that the land belonged to H. H together with LB
and his wife Mrs B (H’s daughter) lived in the house during the
reconstruction and they continued to live there until H died in 1973.
 In her will H bequeathed the land to her grandson, the defendant;
but the will made express reference to the wall house in which H
resided which was stated to be the property of LB who occupied the
land on which the house stood. On the question whether Mrs B
retained any interest in the wall house after LB’s death, 

 Held - An equity had arisen in favour of LB as a consequence of the
reconstruction of the house at his own expense in the expectation of
being allowed to continue to live there; H must be taken, In the
circumstances, to have encouraged and approved the reconstruction and
LB must be taken to have expected his widow not to be in jeopardy of
dispossession in the event of his death; accordingly, equity required
that Mrs B should enjoy the protection to which LB would have been
entitled and should be allowed to remain in the house so long as she
wished to use it as her home.

 Action 

 Action Lawrence De Vere Barnett, the defendant, sought to acquire title to
land devised to him in the will of his grandmother, Mercy Ann Hurdle,
in foreclosure proceedings in the High Court of Barbados (case 19 of
1977). The other claimants to the land were the defendant’s
mother, Mrs Gwendolyn Marcella Barnett, and his aunt, Mrs Edna
Gertrude Greenidge (both daughters of Mercy Ann Hurdle). 

 C
Williams for the defendant 

 D
Rawlins for Mrs Barnett and Mrs Greenidge 

 Williams
J. There is a parcel of land at Gall Hill, St John, with the following
description and boundaries: 




‘ All
that certain parcel of land situate at Gall Hill in the parish of
Saint John in this Island containing by estimation one half of an
acre butting and bounding on lands now or late of the estate of
Adolphus Massiah deceased on lands now or late of John Foster on
lands now or late of Eastmont Plantation and on the public road known
as Gall Hill No 1 which leads to Gall Hill or however the same may
butt and bound.’ 




 A
wall dwelling-house is on this land. 

 The
defendant, Lawrence Barnett, claims title to the land under the
following clause in the will of his grandmother: 




‘ I
give, devise and bequeath unto my grandson, Lawrence De Vere Barnett,
who at present resides in the United Kingdom of Great Britain all of
that portion of land containing by estimation one half acre more or
less situated at Gall Hill in the parish of Saint John and Island
aforesaid for his absolute use and benefit. On portion of the said
land stands a wall house where I reside. The said house is the
property of Linley Barnett who occupies that portion of land that the
said house stands on’. 




 When
the defendant was unable to discover a plot and sale for the land, he
sought legal advice and the present suit is the consequence. He
seeks title to the land through the court. 

 The
first claimant is the defendant’s mother, Gwendolyn Marcella
Barnett, and the second claimant is his aunt, Edna Gertrude
Greenidge. Both claim possessory titles to portions of the land. 

 The
half acre of land is made up of two adjoining pieces which on the
evidence were long in the possession and control of the defendant’s
grandmother, Mercy Ann Hurdle. One piece, referred to time and again
as “Mercy Hurdle’s land”, belonged to Mercy Ann Hurdle in her
own right. The other piece called “Abel Dottin’s land”, was
long under the control of Mercy Ann Hurdle under some other title or
pretext. The defendant at present lives on Abel Dottin’s land; and
there is no dispute 

 89 

 in
this case in relation to Abel Dottin’s land. 

 The
dispute relates to “Mercy Hurdle’s land”. On a portion of this
stands a wall dwelling-house in which Mrs Barnett lives. On the
other portion Mrs Greenidge lives in a chattel house. As stated
above, both claim possessory titles. 

 Mrs
Barnett’s claim is to all of Mercy Hurdle’s land; but it clearly
cannot be sustained to that extent since the evidence does not
disclose occupation by Mrs Greenidge on Mrs Barnett’s behalf. On
the evidence any claim to a possessory title by Mrs Barnett could
only relate to the premises which she occupies; and likewise any
claim by Mrs Greenidge could only relate to the portion of land in
her occupation. 

 In
truth and in fact, the evidence does not support one or the other. 
It seems clear to me that Mrs Greenidge cannot be considered as
having been in possession adverse to her mother. Mercy Ann Hurdle
only died in 1973. In 1965 she sent for Mrs Greenidge and allowed
her to place her chattel house on the land. Although Mrs Greenidge
never paid rent to Mercy Ann Hurdle, her occupation of the house
during the lifetime of a her mother cannot on the evidence support a
possessory title. She was clearly occupying as Mercy Ann Hurdle’s
daughter. 

 Mr
Rawlins submits that Mrs Greenidge was the tenant at will of her
mother; that after a year, not having paid any rent to her mother,
time began to run in her favour from about 1966. He submits that ten
years have elapsed since then and it is now too late to recover the
land from her. There is instructive authority on this point. In Booker v Palmer [1942] 2 All ER 674 at page 677 Lord Greene MR said: 




‘ There
is one golden rule which is of very general application, namely, that
the law does not impute intention to enter into legal relationships
where the circumstances and conduct of the parties negative any
intention of the kind.’ 




 In Facchini v Bryson [1952] 1 TLR 1386 at page 1389 Denning LJ said: 




‘ In
all the cases where the occupier has been held to be a licensee there
has been something in the circumstances, such as a family
arrangement, an act of friendship or generosity, or such like, to
negative any intention to create a tenancy. In such circumstances it
would be obviously unjust to saddle the owner with a tenancy, with
all the momentous consequences that that entails nowadays, when there
was no intention to create a tenancy at all.’ 




 In Callender and Callender v Dottin (1965) 8 WIR 429 at page 434 Archer P, after referring to the above
passages, said: 




‘ In
this case the evidence is meagre and the circumstances from which
inference can be drawn are few. Undoubtedly, Rose Bynoe intended to
give Winston (Callender financial assistance and her method of doing
so was to allow him the use of a portion of her land rent-free. This
was an act of generosity and as the evidence discloses little else, 

 90 

 the
greater probability is certainly that she did not intend to enter
into the relationship of landlord and tenant with her son. In
referring to the injustice in saddling an owner of premises with a
tenancy when he had no intention to create one Denning LJ, in Facchini v Bryson cited above, obviously had in mind the restrictions on a landlord’s
common law rights imposed by the Rent Acts. How far the decisions in
cases in which there were exceptional circumstances of the kind
mentioned by Denning LJ were influenced by this consideration is
immaterial for it would be equally unfair to saddle Rose Bynoe with a
tenancy, even though the subject-matter is agricultural land and not
a house, when she was merely doing an act of kindness and, what is
worse, with a tenancy which her son now claims has ripened into
ownership.’ 




 The
evidence in this case is that an incident took place at Mrs
Greenidge’s former residence in St Michael which made Mercy Ann
Hurdle send for her. Mercy Ann Hurdle permitted Mrs Greenidge to put
her chattel house on the land. Mrs Greenidge never paid rent. She
continued to be friendly with her mother until the time of the
latter’s death. Mercy Ann Hurdle devised the land to the defendant
and apparently did not think that, in relation to Mrs Greenidge at
least, it was encumbered in any way. This is one of the
circumstances Archer P took into account in Callender&amp;Callender v Dottin (1965) 8 WIR at page 435 in upholding the judge’s finding that a
mere licence was granted. 

 My
finding in this case is that Mrs Greenidge had a mere licence and no
greater interest. Mercy Ann Hurdle’s act was one of generosity to
her daughter and, as Mrs Barnett deposed, she devised the land to the
defendant relying on him to look after his elderly relatives. 

 As
far as Mrs Barnett’s allegedly possessory title is concerned, she
is on much weaker ground. She remained living in the house with her
mother until her mother’s death. Up to then she could not be
considered as having possession adverse to her mother. her mother
was in possession and she was her mother’s guest. She was living
in the house with the permission of her mother. Her mother died in
1973 and it is now 1978. That disposes of Mrs Barnett’s claim to a
title through adverse possession. 

 Has
Mrs Barnett any other claim to remain in the house? Mr Rawlins
submits that in equity she has. The wall house where she lives was
constructed with funds to which (according to her) she contributed. 
His submission is that she has an equitable interest in the house and
the land on which it is built. 

 The
first question which arises for decision is this. The general rule
is that what is affixed to land is part of the land so that the
ownership of a building constructed on land would follow the
ownership of the land on which the building is constructed. Since
the building was constructed on Mercy Ann Hurdle’s land, it would
in law belong to her. But it was constructed by Linley Barnett
substantially with his funds. The 

 91 

 question
is, has the legal position been in any way affected by equitable
considerations? 

 The
factual position seems to be as follows. First, the house was
constructed by Linley Barnett substantially with his own funds. 
Second, like the other members of the family who gave evidence before
me, Linley Barnett would have known that the land on which he
constructed the house belonged to Mercy Ann Hurdle. Third, Mercy Ann
Hurdle lived in the house throughout the time when it was rebuilt. 
Fourth, Mercy Ann Hurdle recognised that it was Linley Barnett who
had done the reconstruction. In her will she spoke of the house
being “the property of Linley Barnett who occupies that portion of
the land that the said house stands on”. 

 I
will now turn to Inwards v Baker [1965] 1 All ER 446. In that case the defendant was thinking of
building a bungalow on a piece of land. His father suggested that
the defendant should build the bungalow on some land which the father
owned. The defendant accepted the suggestion, built the bungalow and
lived in it. Twelve years after his father’s death, the trustees
of his father’s will claimed possession of the bungalow. It was
held that since the defendant had been induced by his father to build
the bungalow on his father’s land and had expended money for that
purpose in the expectation of being allowed to remain there, equity
would not allow the expectation so created to be defeated and,
accordingly, the defendant was entitled to remain in occupation of
the bungalow as against the trustees. 

 Lord
Denning MR, after referring to Dillwyn v Llewellyn [1861-73] All ER Rep 384, Plimmer
v Wellington Corporation (1884) 9 App Cas 699 and Ramsden v Dyson [1866] LR 1 HL 129, went on to say ([1965] 1 All ER at 448): 




‘ It
is quite plain from those authorities that if the owner of land
requests another, or indeed allows another, to expend money on the
land under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that
he will be able to remain there, that raises an equity in the
licensee such as to entitle him to stay. He has a licence coupled
with an equity. Counsel for the plaintiffs urged before us that the
licensee could not stay indefinitely. The principle only applied, he
said, when there was an expectation of some precise legal term; but
it seems to me, from Plimmer’s case in particular, that the equity arising from the expenditure on
land should not fail ‘merely on the ground that the interest to be
secured has not been expressly indicated ... the court must look at
the circumstances in each case to decide in what way the equity can
be satisfied’. So in this case, even though there is no binding
contract to grant any particular interest to the licensee,
nevertheless the court can look at the circumstances and see whether
there is an equity arising out of the expenditure of money. All that
is necessary is that the licensee should, at the request or with the
encouragement of the landlord, have spent the money in the
expectation of being 

 92 

 allowed
to stay there. If so, the court will not allow that expectation to
be defeated where it would be inequitable so to do. In this case, it
is quite plain that the father allowed an expectation to be created
in the defendant’s mind that this bungalow was to be his home. It
was to be his home for his life or, at all events, his home as long
as he wished it to remain his home. It seems to me that in the light
of that equity, the father could not in 1932 have turned to the
defendant and said ‘You are to go. It is my land and my house’. 
So here too, the plaintiffs the successors in title of the father,
are clearly themselves bound by this equity. It is an equity well
recognised in law. It arises from the expenditure of money by a
person in actual occupation of land when he is led to believe that,
as a result of that expenditure, he will be allowed to remain there. 
It is for the court to say in what way the equity can be satisfied. 
I am quite clear in this case that it can be satisfied by holding
that the defendant can remain there as long as he desires to use it
as his home.’ 

 Applying
this principle to this case, the question is whether an equity arose
in favour of Linley Barnett. In my view an equity did arise. He
must have reconstructed the house with his money in the expectation
that he would be allowed to continue to live there and, although
there is no evidence that Mercy Ann Hurdle suggested that he should
reconstruct the house, yet she was living there and on the evidence
she clearly allowed him to do the reconstruction. Considering that
Linley Barnett reconstructed and improved a house that belonged to
her and was the place where she lived, I do not think that it is too
much to say that she must have approved and encouraged the
reconstruction. 

 An
equity having arisen, how could it be satisfied? Clearly Mercy Ann
Hurdle could not, before Linley Barnett’s death, have told him to
leave her land and house. Can Mercy Ann Hurdle’s successor in
title tell Linley Barnett’s widow to pack her things and go? In
the words of Denning LJ in Inwards v Baker [1965] 1 All ER 446, the court must look at the circumstances in each
case to decide in what way the equity can be satisfied. Here Linley
Barnett lived with his wife in the house throughout the period in
which it was reconstructed. His wife was Mercy Ann Hurdle’s
daughter. He could not have expected that someday in the future she
would be in danger of being ejected. In other words, his intention
would most certainly have been to create a permanent home for his
wife and himself and in the circumstances equity can hardly be
satisfied unless the protection which Linley Barnett would have had,
had he been alive, is extended to his widow. My view is that Mrs
Barnett is entitled to remain in occupation of the house as long as
she desires to use it as her home. 

 The
other aspect to which I must advert is Mrs Barnett’s claim in
equity on the ground of her contribution to the cost of
reconstruction of the house. There is no merit in this claim. I
tend to accept the evidence of the defendant, supported as it is by
the other circumstances and by 

 93 

 the
statement in Mercy Ann Hurdle’s will, that it was substantially
Linley Barnett’s money which went to reconstruct the house. Linley
Barnett was an overseer on a plantation. Mrs Barnett was in a much
more lowly and far less remunerative occupation. It is of no
significance to this aspect of the case that, when she first began to
work, she used to give all her money to her mother. Mercy Ann
Hurdle’s statement in her will that it was Linley Barnett’s house
is in my view good evidence as a statement against her interest. And
that evidence confirms my view on the evidence that the house was
rebuilt with Linley Barnett’s money. 

 In
my judgment Mrs Barnett has a licence to remain in occupation of the
house and its appurtenants for as long as she wishes. Her claim is
allowed with costs to be taxed. Mrs Greenidge’s claim is dismissed
with costs to be taxed. The appurtenants of the house to be
determined with reference to the pig pen situated to the back of the
house. 

 Order
accordingly.

 Motion 

 Motion Richard Christopher Haynes, having instituted proceedings in the High
Court of Barbados (case 620 of 1978) against Victor Johnson for
slander, applied to the court for an interlocutory injunction to
restrain the defendant from repeating or otherwise publishing certain
allegedly defamatory remarks pending trial. 

 C
A Phillips SC, J Connell and P Greaves for the plaintiff 

 J
Dear QC and R Cheltenham (instructed by Yearwood&amp;Boyce) for the defendant 

 Sir
William Douglas CJ. This is an application on behalf of the plaintiff, a medical
practitioner and a candidate in the forthcoming bye-election in the
St Michael South Central constituency, seeking an interim injunction
to prevent the defendant repeating or otherwise publishing certain
allegedly defamatory statements, the subject-matter of this suit. 

 In
his statement of claim the plaintiff alleges that on 18th June 1978
at a political meeting, the defendant made statements defamatory of
him 

 95 

 in
the way of his profession. For the purposes of this motion it is
submitted that the following passages contain the imputations
complained of: 




 (i)
‘I happen to know that my father-in-law has been attending [the
plaintiff] now for the longest time. He died three weeks ago. He
has been attending [the plaintiff] now for years, and the smallest
piece of change he ever paid was $45.00.’ 

 (ii)
‘And the last thing [the plaintiff] asked ... just before the old
man died, how he stop for coppers... He wanted to find out from my
wife how much coppers he got left, to figure out probably how much
money he could afford to hit him then, I suppose ...’ 

 (iii)
‘Can you now call [the plaintiff] and tell him to come up here in
Delamere land or come up here in Brittons Hill and see me 2.00 in the
morning, because I ain’t feeling so good and I can’t get out. 
You think he going come? ... The only reason he might come is if he
think that we will hear that he don’t go and I would get up here
and say he didn’t come. He might come now but on 7th July ... he
is not coming to see anybody in Cummins Road.’ 




 In
his affidavit in reply to the plaintiff’s affidavit supporting the
motion, the defendant admits making these statements; but he denies
making them falsely or maliciously. He also denies that he spoke the
words of the plaintiff in the exercise of or by way of his profession
as a physician. He states on oath that the statements were intended
to, and did in fact, refer to the plaintiff in his capacity as a
candidate for the bye-election and in his capacity as a politician. 

 Mr
Dear submitted on behalf of the defendant that the law applicable in
this case was the law of slander as it existed at common law in
England prior to the Defamation Act 1952 [United Kingdom]. That is
so. In Barbados there is no legislation equivalent to the English
1952 Act. He contended that all the allegations go to show is that
the plaintiff was a greedy man, and he pointed out that there was no
allegation that the plaintiff was not a competent doctor. He cited Dauncey v Holloway [1901] 2 KB 441, Jones
v Jones [1916] 2 AC 481 and Hopwood v Muirson [1945] 1 KB 313. In the last-named, Goddard LJ observed (at page
317): 




‘ It
is not enough that the words are spoken of a plaintiff in his
calling; they must also impute to him unfitness for, or misconduct in
that calling.’ 




 Based
on these authorities, the question which I must resolve is this: “Do
the words in the passages set out above reasonably convey any
imputation of impropriety or misconduct on the part of the plaintiff
in relation to or in connection with his profession or of unfitness
to carry on his profession in a proper and satisfactory manner?” 
(See the judgments of Goddard and du Parcq LLJ in Hopwood v Muirson ,
supra.) 

 Referring
to the first passage, the ordinary, sensible person hearing those
words would, in my view, understand them to mean that not only 

 96 

 was
the plaintiff charging high fees, but he was charging fees which were
excessive. No mention is made in the passage of the services in
respect of which the fees were charged, but the clear implication is
that the plaintiff was in the habit of overcharging his patients. 

 As
to the second passage, the words there convey to me the imputation
that the plaintiff was trying to wring every cent he could from his
patient. The use of the word “hit” is especially harsh and
connotes extreme callousness on the part of the plaintiff in the
matter of seeking remuneration for his professional services. The
words suggest that the plaintiff was using his profession as a cloak
for extracting as much money as possible from his patients. They are
very disparaging and if believed would cause severe damage to the
plaintiff. 

 As
to the third passage, the words tax the plaintiff with failing to
attend on persons who are ill and who call him at night. The
suggestion is that medical ethics oblige him to do so and by his
failure he is in breach of the ethical standards of his profession. 

 In
considering whether the words convey imputations of impropriety,
misconduct or unfitness, it must be borne in mind that the medical
profession is one which requires of its members high standards of
honour. In this regard I need only draw attention to the provisions
of the Medical Registration Act, so far as they relate to the
recovery of reasonable fees for professional services (section 15)
and to the punishment of medical practitioners found guilty of
professional misconduct (section 12). 

 It
is to be noted that Clifford Weekes in his affidavit states that he
understood the words to mean that the plaintiff was unfit to practise
his profession as a physician. This is not an unreasonable
conclusion having regard to the esteem in which, so it seems to me,
the medical profession is held in Barbados. 

 The
many issues of law and fact which have arisen and will arise in this
case will be finally resolved when this case comes on for trial. For
the purposes of this application, all I need say is that the passages
I have set out above convey imputations of impropriety, misconduct
and unfitness on the part of the plaintiff in relation to his
profession. In these circumstances the court will intervene and
grant the relief sought in terms of the notice of motion limited to
the passages to which I have referred. 

 Costs
will be costs in the cause. 

 Application
granted.

Council) Order in Council 1962, SI 1962 No 1087

law – New trial – Delay – Delay in determination of appeal –
Whether delay such as to invalidate order for new trial 

 The
petitioner was married to the deceased, Mrs H. At a time when they
were not living together he was seen to enter her house one evening
(1st September 1974); she was not seen alive afterwards. Her dead
body was discovered on 4th September and a pathologist stated that
the earliest time of her murder was 3.00 p m on 2nd September. On
10th September the petitioner confessed to murdering her; but he
later asserted that he had been delirious at the time. At the
petitioner’s trial for murder no objection was raised to the
admission of evidence by L, a neighbour of Mrs H, of shouts which he
had heard on the night of 1st September; these had been made by Mrs
H, suggested that she was being murdered and connected the petitioner
with the attack on her. The petitioner’s alleged confession was
also admitted in evidence. The pathologist was not asked whether it
was possible that Mrs H might have been murdered on 1st September. 
The petitioner was convicted of murder on 6th February 1975. He
appealed to the Court of Appeal of Barbados on 19th February. In
December 1976 his appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered,
although the Court of Appeal ruled that L’s evidence and the
alleged confession had been properly admitted. No reasons for the
delay in the determination of the appeal were given. In January 1977
the petitioner applied to the Court of Appeal and was granted leave
to appeal to the Privy Council under the British Caribbean (Appeal to
Privy Council) Order in Council 1962. In June 1978 the petitioner
lodged a petition with the Privy Council for special leave to appeal
on the grounds that, in view of the passage of time, the interests of
justice did not require a new trial and that the evidence of L and
the alleged confession were not admissible and, without such
evidence, there was no case for the petitioner to answer. 

 Held - (1) The Court of Appeal of Barbados had no jurisdiction to grant 

 98 

 leave
to appeal to the Privy Council in a criminal matter. 

 Oteri
v R [1976] 1 WLR 1272 followed. 

 (2)
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was not prepared to hold
that the decision of the Court of Appeal to order a new trial was
wrong on account of the time that had elapsed before that decision
was given; nor were there grounds to interfere with that court’s
exercise of its discretion in making that order; further, it had not
been suggested that a proper trial could not now take place;
accordingly, since even if L’s evidence were excluded there would
be a case for the petitioner to answer, there was no reason to grant
special leave to appeal from the order of the Court of Appeal.

 Petition 

 Petition Dudley Holder petitioned Her Majesty in Council for special leave to
appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal of Barbados in R v Holder (1976) 28 WIR 71 so far as, on allowing his appeal against a
conviction for murder, it ordered a new trial. The Judicial
Committee stated on 11th July 1978 that Her Majesty would be advised
to refuse special leave to appeal; but that the reasons of the
Judicial Committee would be given at a later date. 

 Louis
Blom-Cooper QC and Richard Plender for the petitioner 

 Stuart
McKinnon for the Crown 

 The
Board reserved its reasons. 

 Viscount
Dilhorne delivered the reasons of the Judicial Committee. On 6th February
1975 the petitioner was convicted of the murder of his wife,
Geraldine Holder, and sentenced to death. On 19th February, he gave
notice of appeal and his appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal of
Barbados on 30th September and 1st and 8th October 1976; the judgment
of that court being delivered on 17th December 1976. The court
allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction, set aside the sentence
and ordered a new trial. Their Lordships were not told why it was
that so long a period elapsed between the giving of the notice of
appeal and 

 99 

 its
determination two years and four months after the murder was alleged
to have been committed. 

 On
7th January 1977 the petitioner lodged a petition with the Court of
Appeal asking their leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council. On 25th March 1977 the Court of Appeal granted leave
by virtue of the British Caribbean (Appeal to Privy Council) Order in
Council 1962. That court may grant leave to appeal from a- 




‘ judgment
... if, in the opinion of the court, the question involved in the
appeal is one which, by reason of its great or general importance or
otherwise, ought to be submitted to Her Majesty in Council for
decision.’ 




“ Judgment”
is defined in section 2(1) of the Order as including “a decree,
order, ruling, sentence or decision of the court”. This Order in
Council has remained in force since Barbados became independent. 

 A
similar Order in Council was considered in Chung Chuck v R [1930] AC 244 where it was held that it did not confer a new right on
the Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal to the Privy Council in
a criminal matter. In Oteri v R [1976] 1 WLR 1272 the Full Court of Western Australia purported to
grant leave to appeal to the Privy Council in a criminal matter and
Lord Diplock, delivering the judgment of the Board, pointed out that
an appeal to the Privy Council in a criminal matter lay only with the
special leave of Her Majesty granted upon the advice of the Judicial
Committee. 

 Just
as in that case so here, the Court of Appeal has no power by virtue
of the Order in Council to grant leave in a criminal matter and their
decision to do so is consequently a nullity. On 22nd June 1978 the
petitioner lodged a petition for special leave to appeal to Her
Majesty in Council, and the matter came before their Lordships as an
application for such leave. 

 The
Federal Supreme Court Regulations 1958, by regulation 22(1), provided
that the Supreme Court should on an appeal against conviction allow
the appeal if they thought that the verdict of the jury should be set
aside on the ground that it was unreasonable, or could not be
supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the
court before whom the appellant was convicted should be set aside on
the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any
ground there was a miscarriage of justice; and that in any other case
the court should dismiss the appeal. This regulation contained the
proviso that the court might, notwithstanding that they were of
opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they considered that
no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. 
Regulation 22(2) reads as follows: 




‘ Subject
to the special provisions of this Part of these Regulations the
Federal Supreme Court shall, if they allow an appeal against
conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of 

 100 

 acquittal
to be entered or if the interests of justice so require, order a new
trial.’ 




 These
regulations were made applicable to the British Caribbean Court of
Appeal by section 12 of the British Caribbean Court of Appeal Order
in Council 1962 and to the Barbados Court of Appeal by the Supreme
Court of Judicature Act 1966. 

 The
petitioner sought special leave to appeal from the order of the Court
of Appeal on the ground that, in view of the passage of time since
the killing of his wife, the interests of justice did not require a
new trial. It was also contended on his behalf that the Court of
Appeal was wrong in its conclusion that certain evidence given by a
witness for the prosecution at the trial, Mr Everton Licorish, and
evidence of an alleged confession made by the petitioner was
admissible. It was contended that without such evidence there was no
case for the petitioner to answer and that therefore the new trial
should not have been ordered. 

 Regulation
22(2) does not impose any fetter on the exercise by the court of its
discretion to order a new trial or lay down any guidelines as to the
exercise of that power. Their Lordships do not intend to attempt to
lay down any guidelines or desire to impose any fetter on its
exercise. No doubt the court entrusted with the power to order a new
trial will, when considering the exercise of its discretion, have
regard to many matters, including the gravity of the charge, the time
that has elapsed since the alleged commission of the offence and
whether it is possible to hold a proper new trial were one ordered. 
As Lawton LJ said in R v Turner (1975) 61 Cr App Rep 67 at page 79: 




‘ It
is in the interests of the public that criminals should be brought to
justice, and the more serious the crimes the greater is the need for
justice to be done.’ 




 In Nirmal v R [1972] Crim LR 226 the Judicial Committee did not uphold an order for
a new trial made by the Fiji Court of Appeal when the only object of
the new trial would have been to have given the prosecution an
opportunity to make out a new case or to fill gaps in the evidence. 
In R v Saunders (1973) 58 Cr App Rep 248 at page 255 Lord Widgery said: 




‘ ...
it is not in the court’s knowledge that it has ever before been
contemplated that a retrial should take place some three and a half
years after the original offence was committed. A delay of one year,
perhaps two years, is not uncommon, but none of us can remember a
case in which it has been thought right to order a retrial after such
a long period when regard is had to the fact that this appellant has
already stood his trial once, and has been in prison for a number of
years and would, if a new trial is ordered, have to run the gauntlet
and the hazards and prejudice of being tried, again.’ 




 Lord
Widgery CJ’s observations were related to England. In some other
territories the process of justice may operate more slowly. Their 

 101 

 Lordships
would not be prepared to hold that the decision of the Court of
Appeal was wrong on account of the time that had elapsed when that
decision was given They would not think it right to interfere with
the exercise of discretion by that court unless it was clear that
that court had erred by taking into account matters to which it ought
not to have had regard or by not taking into account matters to which
it should have paid attention. To order a new trial merely to enable
the prosecution to present a new case would not in their Lordships’
view be a proper exercise of discretion. Their Lordships do not know
to what matters the Court of Appeal in this case had regard when
making its decision but they see no reason to conclude that that
court either failed to have regard to matters to which it should have
had regard, or erred in taking into account matters which it should
not have done. 

 Unfortunately,
neither counsel for the petitioner nor counsel for the prosecution
was able to give any information as to the causes of the delay in the
determination of the appeal. When one of the grounds of appeal is
delay, it is desirable that counsel should be provided with
information as to the reasons for it. A petitioner cannot rely on
the passage of time that has occurred which has been brought about by
dilatoriness on his part. An undue length of time has passed since
the determination of the appeal due in part to the application for
leave to appeal being made to the Court of Appeal and to the delay
until June 1978 in lodging the petition for special leave to appeal. 
Mr Blom-Cooper did not seek to rely on such delay as a ground for
reversing the order for a new trial. 

 The
case for the prosecution at the trial can be summarised as follows:
the petitioner was charged with the murder of his wife “sometime
between 1st September 1974 and 4th September 1974”. Mrs Holder was
last seen alive on 1st September. Her dead body was discovered on
4th September. Mr Licorish testified that he had seen Mrs Holder
enter her house a little after 10.00 p m on the night of 1st
September. He lived on the opposite side of the road to her. That
was the last time she was seen alive. A little later Mr Licorish saw
the petitioner lurking behind the fence to his, Mr Licorish’s,
house and saw him go into his wife’s house through the front door. 
The petitioner was not living there then. At about 11.20 p m Mr
Licorish said he heard Mrs Holder shout, “Murder, murder, I beg you
Dudley don’t kill me, Lord have mercy”. In cross-examination Mr
Licorish said that he did not take this shouting seriously because he
was accustomed to “hearing her hollering for murder at night. 
Sometimes she inside hollering for murder and sometimes she outside
by the gate”. On the evening of 4th September the body of Mrs
Holder was found in the bedroom of her house. She had been stabbed
four times in the chest. 

 At
the time no objection was taken to Mr Licorish testifying as to what
he heard Mrs Holder shout; but on appeal to the Court of Appeal it
was contended that this evidence should not have been admitted. This
contention was based on evidence later given by Dr Brathwaite. He
first saw the body of Mrs Holder at 9.00 p m on 4th September. The
next day 

 102 

 at
9.00 a m he performed a postmortem. The body was in a state of
decomposition. In his evidence-in-chief he said that she had been
dead for more than 48 hours. In cross-examination he said that the
probable number of hours which had elapsed since her death was 36 to
48 and that he was prepared to put the upper limit at 54 hours, i e
3.00 p m on Monday 2nd September. He was not prepared to say that
she had died at the earliest that Monday night or at the latest the
Tuesday morning. He was not asked whether in his opinion the state
of her body was consistent with her having been killed on the Sunday
night. In the course of his evidence he drew a distinction between
what was probable and what was possible. 

 If
Mrs Holder could only have been killed after 3.00 p m on 2nd
September then the evidence of Mr Licorish as to what he had heard
Mrs Holder say on the night of 1st September was not admissible as
evidence, for it was not evidence relevant to murder after that time
on 2nd September having been committed by the petitioner. 

 If,
on the other hand, the state of her body on 5th September was
consistent with her having been killed on the night of 1st September,
Mr Licorish’s evidence as to the shouts he had heard and what he
had heard said was clearly relevant. 

 In Ratten v R [1972] AC 378 at page 387 Lord Wilberforce, delivering the judgment
of the Board, said: 




‘ The
mere fact that evidence of a witness includes evidence as to words
spoken by another person who is not called, is no objection to its
admissibility. Words spoken are facts just as much as any other
action by a human being. If the speaking of the words is a relevant
fact, a witness may give evidence that they were spoken. A question
of hearsay only arises when the words spoken are relied on
‘testimonially’, ie as establishing some fact narrated by the
words.’ 




 He
cited the following passage from the judgment of the Board in Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor [1956] 1 WLR 965 at page 970: 




‘ Evidence
of a statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself
called as a witness may or may not be hearsay. It is hearsay and
inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the
truth of what is contained in the statement. It is not hearsay and
is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not
the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made.’ 




 In Ratten it was held that evidence that the deceased had a few minutes before
her death sought to speak to the police on the telephone and that her
voice was hysterical and that she sobbed was admissible. Lord
Wilberforce referred to a statement made by a victim of an attack or
by a bystander indicating directly or indirectly the identity of an
attacker and said ([1972] AC at page 389): 




‘ The
test [as to admissibility] should not be the uncertain one, 

 103 

 whether
the making of the statement should be regarded as part of the event
or transaction. This may often be difficult to show. But if the
drama, leading up to the climax, has commenced and assumed such
intensity and pressure that the utterance can safely be regarded as a
true reflection of what was unrolling or actually happening, it ought
to be received.’ 




 Later
he said (at page 391): 




‘ On
principle it would not appear right that the necessary association
should be shown only by the statement itself... Facts differ so
greatly that it is impossible to lay down any precise general rule:
it is difficult to imagine a case where there is no evidence at all
of connection between the statement and principal event other than
the statement itself, but whether this is sufficiently shown must be
a matter for the trial judge. Their Lordships would be disposed to
agree that, amongst other things, he may take the statement it self
into account.’ 




 In
the present case, as has been said, Mr Licorish heard Mrs Holder
shouting. “Murder, murder I beg you Dudley don’t kill me, Lord
have mercy”, and the case is complicated by the fact that he was
accustomed to “hearing her hollering for murder at night”. In
the light of that evidence, even if the evidence of what she said was
admissible and admitted in the exercise of judicial discretion, it is
clear that the jury should have been warned that it might not be safe
to conclude that at the time her husband was in the process of
killing her or about to kill her; and that, if they accepted evidence
as to what she shouted, it might be safe only to conclude that there
was a row between her and her husband. They might, if they accepted
the evidence as to what she shouted, hold that it was her husband who
was in the house with her. The naming of her husband supported Mr
Licorish’s evidence that he had seen the petitioner, who was not
then living there, enter the house. 

 The
Court of Appeal held that Mr Licorish’s evidence as to the shouts
was rightly admitted by the trial judge. They said that the jury was
not bound to accept Dr Brathwaite’s upper limit as the time within
which the murder took place and that the shouts were in essence part
of something that was going on. That they were part of something
going on does not of itself render them admissible as evidence. To
be admitted it had to be shown that what was going on was the drama
which culminated in Mrs Holder’s death, and in the light of Dr
Brathwaite’s evidence that was not shown. 

 It
is indeed unfortunate that Dr Brathwaite was not asked whether it was
possible or probable that she might have been killed on the night of
1st September. That not having been asked, their Lordships are
inclined to the view that the evidence as to what Mrs Holder shouted
was not rightly admitted. If admissible, that does not of itself
show that the order for a new trial should not have been made. 

 On
10th September Mrs Pierce saw the petitioner lying in the bush. 

 104 

 He
had one hand in a sock. It was later found that he had a badly
infected wound in his left arm. He asked her to can an ambulance for
him and said that he had had nothing to eat for six days and had six
black-outs. He was taken to hospital where he was seen between 4.30
and 5.00 p m by Dr Sears. Dr Sears said that he was conscious and
well orientated but could have been delirious before he examined him.
 At 11.20 that morning Inspector Whittaker saw the petitioner in the
hospital. He had taken a long statement from the petitioner at the
mortuary on 5th September. On 10th September Inspector Whittaker
asked the petitioner if he knew him. The answer was. “Yes
Inspector. I glad you come. I killed my wife and I feel I should
dead too”. Inspector Whittaker said the petitioner appeared fully
conscious and Corporal Trotman, who was present, said that he
appeared to be quite normal. 

 Admission
in evidence of this confession was objected to on the ground that it
was not the product of a conscious and deliberate will, evidence
having been given that in view of his condition the petitioner had
“almost definitely” been delirious at times. After a trial
within the trial the judge admitted the confession, observing that
there was no medical evidence that he was delirious when he made it. 
The Court of Appeal upheld his conclusion. In their Lordships’
view on the evidence given at the trial, it is not possible to
conclude that they were wrong in doing so. 

 The
petitioner did not give evidence but made a statement from the dock. 

 In
their Lordship’s view the passage of time that occurred between the
murder and the decision of the Court of Appeal is not such as to show
any error on the part of the Court of Appeal in the exercise of their
discretion to order a new trial. It was not suggested that a proper
trial cannot now take place. Even if Mr Licorish’s evidence as to
what he heard Mrs Holder shouting is excluded, there would appear to
be a case for the petitioner to answer. He was seen to go into her
house late on 1st September after she had entered it. That was the
last time she was seen alive. She was stabbed in the chest and on
10th September the petitioner confessed to having killed her. 

 In
these circumstances their Lordships saw no reason to grant special
leave to appeal from the order of the Court of Appeal. They regard
it as important that the trial should take place without delay. At
that trial it will be for the trial judge to rule on the
admissibility both of the evidence as to what Mrs Holder shouted and
as to the confession in the light of the evidence as it then emerges.
 In reaching his conclusions on those questions he should not allow
himself to be influenced in any degree by the conclusions reached on
them at the earlier trial or by the Court of Appeal. If he should
decide that the evidence of what Mrs Holder said is admissible he
should then, of course, go on to consider whether in the exercise of
his discretion he should exclude it on the ground that its admission
would be unduly prejudicial to the petitioner. Their Lordships,
however, would not wish anything that they have said 

 105 

 to
be taken as an indication as to the manner in which his discretion
should be exercised. For these reasons their Lordships humbly
advised Her Majesty to refuse the application for special leave.

that application for leave to appeal be refused .

 COURT
OF APPEAL OF BELIZE 

 BLAIR-KERR
P, SIR CLIFFORD INNISS AND GEORGES JJA 

 30TH
OCTOBER 1980, 5TH MARCH 1981 

 Defamation
– Innuendo – Suspicion of crime – Whether statement capable of
constituting allegation of guilt 

 Defamation
– Damages – Quantum of award – Comparable cases – Cases from
other jurisdictions – Relevance in Belize 

 The
respondent sued the appellant, who was the editor, printer and
publisher of a newspaper, for libel contained in an article published
in the newspaper. The appellant had been a candidate for the
opposition party at the Belize City Council elections and the
respondent was closely associated with the governing party. The
article, which was published a few days before the elections,
concerned a physical attack shortly after a political rally on the
leader of a political movement which supported the opposition party. 
The article stated that the attack was politically motivated and that
the respondent was a prime suspect; it referred also to the
respondent’s “gang of paid henchmen”. The appellant admitted
the publication but denied that the article implied that the
respondent had been guilty of the attack. The trial judge ruled that
the words were capable of meaning that the respondent had committed
the crime and, accordingly, the article was defamatory in that
respect and also in its reference to the respondent’s leadership of
a gang of paid henchmen. The judge awarded the respondent $2500
damages. On appeal and cross-appeal, 

 Held, dismissing the appeal and the cross-appeal- 

 (1)
(Sir Clifford Inniss dissenting) The allegation of grounds for
suspicion did not import an allegation of guilt for, unless the
author was plainly not being frank in his use of words (which was not
the case here), he should not be taken to mean something other than
what he clearly appeared to have said. 

 (2)
Nevertheless, the article was defamatory of the respondent in its
reference to his being the leader of a gang of paid henchmen. 

 (3)
The quantum of the award of damages could not properly be attacked by reference
to the size of awards in comparable cases of political libels in
Barbados and Guyana since larger sums might be awarded in
jurisdictions where there was greater commercial activity and
newspapers had a wider circulation than they had in Belize; and
comparisons were not possible unless such factors could be assessed.

 Georges
JA. The appellant who is the editor, printer and publisher of the
newspaper The Reporter appeals against a judgment awarding damages against him for an
article in that newspaper dated 4th December 1977, which was found to
be libellous of the respondent. 

 The
article complained of read as follows: 




‘ YPF
LEADER BASHED AND STABBED RAY LIGHTBURN AND GANG ARE SUSPECTS 

 One
of the Leaders and founders of the Youth Popular Front movement,
23-year-old Bobby Smith was attacked and stabbed with an ice-pick
shortly before midnight on Thursday following a huge pre-election
rally sponsored by the YPF at the Courthouse wharf. 

 Reports
say he was attacked by a group of young men one of whom bashed him
over the forehead with a piece of lumber while another stabbed him in
the abdomen with an ice-pick. His attackers fled, leaving him
bleeding in the street with severe stomach cramps. 

 The
attack took place on East Canal Street between Orange and Church. It
has been established beyond a doubt that it was a political crime. 

 Smith,
who was hospitalised and had to take an operation to patch 

 108 

 up
his punctured intestines, later related that he heard someone call
his name ‘Bobby’. He looked around to receive a terrific blow
across his forehead, causing his knees to buckle. Then he felt the
puncture-wound in his abdomen. 

 Earlier
Smith and a party of friends were at the Melting Pot Disco
celebrating their successful meeting when Ray Lightburn and his gang
of paid henchmen walked in and looked around. They each had a beer
and walked out. Lightburn, an associate of gunman Silky Stuart, has
become the prime suspect in the ‘bash&amp;juk’ incident, the
first violence to erupt in the current political campaign. 

‘ We
have not reported the matter to the police’ a YPF spokesman told The Reporter ,
‘because we have no faith in their effectiveness under the present
circumstances.’ It is not known whether Smithrecognised any of his
attackers.’ 




 The
statement of claim averred in paragraph 3 that the words published in
their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean:
(a) that the respondent was the leader of a criminal gang of paid
henchmen; (b) that the respondent and his gang were the suspected
attackers who bashed and stabbed Bobby Smith, one of the leaders of
the Youth Popular Front (“YPF”); and (c) that the attack was a
politically-motivated crime and that the prime suspect of this crime
was the respondent. Two extended meanings were also pleaded in
paragraph 4: (a) that the respondent was guilty of organising and
participating in a shameless and vicious assault and wounding on a
young political opponent; and (b) that the respondent was the prime
suspect to the crime but that the police, despite the evidence, would
not arrest him. 

 The
appellant in his defence admitted the publication but denied that the
words bore any of the meanings set out in the statement of claim. 
Further, he stated that the words without those meanings were true in
substance and in fact. 

 The
claim was one for exemplary damages on the ground that the
publication was motivated by malevolence and spite toward the
respondent. The respondent averred that the appellant was a
candidate for the opposition patty in city council elections which
were held on 7th December (three days after the publication), that
the respondent was a former trade union leader closely identified
with the Peoples’ United Party, and that the article was completely
without foundation and calculated to embarrass the respondent and the
party with which he was associated, thus influencing the results of
the election. The appellant denied this and stated that the article
was published in good faith and was based on an interview between
himself and the victim of the attack, Bobby Smith. 

 The
appellant himself admitted in cross-examination that in their natural
and ordinary meaning the words published conveyed that the respondent
and his gang were the suspected attackers who had bashed 

 109 

 and
stabbed Bobby Smith, one of the leaders of the YPF, and that the
attack was politically motivated and that the prime suspect of the
crime was the respondent. 

 It
was argued for the appellant that it was not libellous to say of
someone that he was suspected of having committed a crime. The judge
appears to have rejected this contention, and rightly so. The test
is not one of pure logic and involves the prediction of the likely
reactions of reasonable persons. Friends and acquaintances may well
shun a person who is known to be suspected of a serious crime. His
reputation will almost certainly fall in the estimation of reasonable
right-thinking persons even when guilt has not been established. The
well-known aphorism that there is no smoke without fire is rooted in
experience; and it is on that basis that the statement that one is
suspected of having committed a crime will be damaging, although not
as damaging as the statement that one has committed a crime. The
judge, however, held that the publication that the respondent was a
suspect had been justified. 

 The
judge went on to hold that the words were capable of bearing the
extended meaning averred in paragraph 4(a), that the respondent had
in fact committed the crime. It followed from this that the natural
meaning set out in paragraph 3(a) (ie that the respondent was the
leader of a criminal gang of paid henchmen) had also been
established. 

 In
determining whether or not the article conveyed the extended meaning
averred, the judge applied the test laid down in Capital and Counties Bank v George Henty&amp;Sons (1882) 7 App Cas 745: what meaning would the article convey to the
ordinary man? 

 This
aspect of the law of libel was considered at some length in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234. Lord Reid quoted with approval the words of Lord
Halsbury in Nevill v Fine Art and General Insurance Co Ltd [1897] AC 68 at pages 72, 73:- 




‘ What
is the sense in which any ordinary reasonable man would understand
the words of communication so as to expose the plaintiff to hatred or
contempt or ridicule ... it is not enough to say that by some person
the words might be understood in a defamatory sense.’ 




 Having
stated that the test was the meaning which the article complained of
would convey to the ordinary man, the judge added: “Further I bore
in mind that the ordinary man is not likely to distinguish between
hints and allegations, suspicion and guilt”. 

 This
statement comes from the speech of Lord Devlin in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234, a case in which the issue was whether a report that
the fraud squad was investigating a company and its subsidiaries
could be held to contain an imputation that the chairman of the
company (who was named in the report) was guilty of fraud. The
decision was not without difficulty, but the majority in the Court of
Appeal and the House of Lords held that the imputation ought not
properly to be drawn by the reasonable man. Lord Devlin stated at
pages 284, 285: 

 110 




‘ When
an imputation is made in a general way, the ordinary man is not
likely to distinguish between hints and allegations, suspicion and
guilt. It is the broad effect that counts and it is no use
submitting to a judge that he ought to dissect the statement before
he submits it to the jury. But, if, on the other hand, the
distinction clearly emerges from the words used it cannot be ignored.
 If it is said of a man ‘I do not believe that he is guilty of
fraud but I cannot deny that he has given grounds for suspicion’,
it seems to me wrong to say that in no circumstances can they be
justified except by the speaker proving the truth of that which he
has expressly said he did not believe. It must depend on whether the
impression conveyed by the speaker is one of frankness or
insinuation.’ 




 Seen
in context, the part of Lord Devlin’s speech used by the judge is
significantly qualified by the remarks which follow. It may be made
clear from the way in which an article is written that the meaning
intended to be conveyed is that there is ground for suspicion but not
proof of guilt. 

 In
expanding on the concept of the test of what the reasonable man would
gather to be the sense of a report that the fraud squad was
investigating the affairs of a company, Lord Reid stated at pages
259, 260: 




‘ Ordinary
men and women have different temperaments and outlooks. Some are
unusually suspicious and some are unusually naïve. One must try to
envisage people between these two extremes and see what is the most
damaging meaning they would put on the words in question. So let us
suppose a number of ordinary people are discussing one of these
paragraphs which they had read in the newspaper. No doubt one of
them might say - ‘Oh, if the fraud squad are after these people you
can take it they are guilty’. But I would expect the others to
turn on him, if he did say that, with such remarks as - ‘Be fair. 
This is not a police state. No doubt their affairs are in a mess or
the police would not be interested. But that could be because Lewis
or the cashier has been very stupid or careless... The police arc
fair and know their job and we shall know soon enough if there is
anything in it. Wait till we see if they charge him. I wouldn’t
trust him until this is cleared up, but it is another thing to
condemn him unheard’.’ 




 Thus,
although it would be wrong to analyse each word of an article in
order to determine its meaning, a writer should not be taken to mean
something other than what he clearly appears to have said unles it is
plain that he is not being frank in his use of words. There is no
indication that this is the situation here. 

 The
bold headline was that the respondent and his gang were suspects. In
the body of the article they were referred to as the prime suspects. 
The grounds of the suspicion were stated: the fact that the crime was 

 111 

 politically
motivated and that the respondent and his gang were aware of Bobby
Smith’s movements that night, having seen him at the Melting Pot
Disco. Finally, there was the statement that it was not known
whether Smith had recognised any of his attackers. This final
statement seems to do no more than reinforce the tenor of the
article: that there were grounds for suspicion, although no evidence
of guilt. 

 Unless
an allegation of grounds for suspicion necessarily imports an
allegation of guilt the article was not capable of bearing the
interpretation that Bobby Smith had been bashed and stabbed by the
respondent. Accordingly, the trial judge erred in holding that it
did. 

 Because
he held that the report bore the meaning that the respondent had
committed a crime the judge held that the article was capable of
bearing the meaning alleged in paragraph 3 (a), that is that the
respondent was the leader of a criminal gang of paid henchmen. 

 The
question (to which the judge did not have to address his mind)
remains: whether the article is capable of bearing the meaning
averred in paragraph 3(a) of the statement of claim if the extended
meaning averred in paragraph 4(a) is rejected? Although we were
referred to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language which defined “henchman” as (among other things) “a paid
associate in crime”, we do not accept that the word is generally
understood to convey a criminal connotation. The Lexicon Webster Dictionary (1977) published in the United States of America in association with
the Encyclopedia Britannica defines it in its most pejorative sense as “a close and obedient
adherent, especially one who carries out without demur or scruple the
instructions of a leader, usually for personal gain”. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English (6th Edn) (1976) defines it more neutrally as “Trusty follower:
political supporter”. The word “gang” does, however, carry a
criminal connotation. The Concise Oxford Dictionary itemises as one of its meanings “band of persons acting or going
about together esp for criminal purpose or (colloq) other purpose
causing disapproval.” 

 Independently,
therefore, of the extended meaning pleaded in paragraph 4(a), the
ordinary meaning pleaded in paragraph 3(a) is sustainable and that
meaning is clearly libellous. The trial judge was correct in finding
that it had not been justified. 

 Accordingly,
the respondent has succeeded in establishing that the article was
libellous in relation to him. 

 In
considering the issue of damages the judge held that the evidence did
not disclose any manner of publication or other conduct on the part
of the appellant to justify the claim for exemplary damages. This
has been challenged on appeal. 

 In
the course of the trial the respondent sought to tender in evidence
an article published in The Reporter of 9th March 1980, purporting to be an account of the first day of
the hearing. The article in part repeated the libel and also stated
that, although counsel for the respondent had sought an adjournment
of the hearing on the ground that the respondent was ill, the
respondent had been seen a few minutes after the midday 

 112 

 adjournment
hale and hearty at the Playboy Club in King Street. The trial judge
refused to admit the report on the ground that it was irrelevant. 
That ruling was erroneous and counsel for the appellant here has
conceded this. Subsequent publications which may go to show malice
on the part of a person publishing a libel are admissible for that
purpose. 

 In Mayne and McGregor on Damages ,
paragraph 892, the principle is stated thus: 




‘ Other
derogatory statements are admissible whether prior or subsequent to
the statement sued upon. Where subsequent, they may even be after
action has been commenced... Most cases have indeed concerned
subsequent statements.’ 




 It
would be derogatory to say of someone that he instructs his counsel
to make an application for an adjournment on the ground that he is
ill when in fact he is hale and hearty. 

 As
evidence of aggravation it has been argued that the appellant
persisted in his plea of justification. The persistence must,
however, be an unreasonable persistence. The trial judge found that
three of the five libellous meanings pleaded had been justified and
there has been no challenge to that finding. The extended meaning
pleaded in paragraph 4(a) which the respondent thought the words
capable of bearing was one that the appellant persistently denied
that he ever intended. It cannot be said, therefore, that there was
an unreasonable persistence in the plea of justification. 

 The
same considerations apply to the absence of an apology. There is no
evidence that an apology was asked for and refused. The appellant
asserted that the respondent was the prime suspect in the incident,
that the article said that and no more, so that there was no
reasonable occasion for an apology. 

 It
was also alleged that the appellant was negligent in failing to check
his story with the police. Had he done so, he would have been aware
of the statement made by Bobby Smith and he would at least have
modified his story. There is no reason to believe that the police
would have made available to the appellant the statement they had
recorded from Bobby Smith. 

 The
article in The Reporter of 9th March 1980, repeated the libel only to the extent of asserting
that the original article had alleged that the respondent and his
gang were the prime suspects in the “bash and juk” incident. 
There is no reason to think that that would have affected the trial
judge’s assessment. It may have been established, had the article
been admitted, that the allegation that the respondent had been seen
hale and hearty at a club on the opening day of the trial was an
untruth. This would have been evidence of malice. The issue does
not appear so crucial to the assessment as to merit a re-opening of
the issue to investigate the factual basis. 

 It
has also been alleged that there was an improper purpose in the 

 113 

 publication
of the story. The real intention was to affect the result of the
elections which were then pending. There is no evidence of this. 
The appellant agreed that the story may have affected the elections,
but there is no admission that it was published for that purpose. 
The fact that Bobby Smith had been attacked immediately after a rally
was news that would normally require publication; that the respondent
was a suspect was also information of public interest. The judge has
found that this allegation was justified. The story may have been
presented with a degree of sensationalism which laid it open to the
interpretation that the respondent was the leader of a criminal gang;
but it cannot be said that the judge erred in not regarding this as
evidence of malice. The finding that there was no evidence of malice
which could form the basis of an award of exemplary damages is
correct and must be supported. 

 Finally
the quantum of damages itself was attacked on the novel ground that it appeared
out of line with awards in what could be termed comparable cases of
political libels in Barbados and Guyana. 

 In
directing himself on the issue of quantum the judge stated: 




‘ I
have considered all the circumstances of the case and took
particularly into account the position and standing of the
[respondent], that the incident in which it was imputed the
[respondent] was involved created a sensation in Belize City, the
extent of the circulation of the newspaper The Reporter ,
and the distress and suffering that the [respondent] must have
suffered as a result.’ 




 This
appears to be a comprehensive and correct direction. In territories
where there is much greater commercial activity and newspapers have
wider circulation larger sums may well be awarded. Comparisons are
not possible unless all these factors can be assessed. 

 In
the result the appeal and cross-appeal must both be dismissed. There
will be no order as to costs on either, since, in effect each party
has succeeded on at least one ground of appeal. 

 Sir
Clifford Inniss JA. after recounting the facts and the findings of the trial judge,
continued: In his appeal the appellant seeks to have the decision set
aside or alternatively to have the award of damages substantially
reduced. The grounds of his appeal are now as follows: 




‘ (1)
The trial judge was wrong in holding that the words complained of in
paragraph 2 of the statement of claim bore the meanings attributed to
them in paragraph 3(a) and paragraph 4(a) of the statement of claim
... 

 (3)
The learned trial judge erred in law when, in assessing the quantum of damages, he omitted to have regard to the fact that the appellant
had been given a statement by Robert Smith saying that the
[respondent] was one of the persons who attacked and stabbed him, and
that the [appellant] had published the words complained of in the 

 114 

 honest
belief that what Smith had told him was true.’ 




 Ground
(2), which complained that the trial judge was wrong in rejecting the
evidence of the witness Bobby Smith to the effect that he recognised
the respondent as one of the persons who had attacked and stabbed
him, was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal. 

 I
will first deal with a submission made by Mr Godfrey, counsel for the
respondent, as to the principles to be applied by the court in
determining the questions raised in ground (1). This was in effect
that the function of this court was only to decide whether the words
were capable of such a meaning as that attached to them by the trial
judge, and not whether in its opinion the words had that particular
meaning. In support of his submission, he referred to the speech of
Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in the House of Lords in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1963] 2 WLR 1063 at page 1080, where he said: 




‘ It
is not for me to say what I think was the meaning which the words
conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader of a newspaper, nor is it
for me to express any opinion as to what conclusion a jury should
reach as to this matter, but I do not consider that that meaning
which involved that there had been fraud or dishonesty was a meaning
which the jury should have been prohibited from considering on the
basis that it was a meaning of which the words were not capable.’ 




 In
jury trials, if the judge is of the opinion, as a matter of law, that
the words complained of are incapable of the meaning alleged, it is
his duty to withdraw that meaning from the jury. 

 In
my opinion, the words of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest are not of
assistance in the instant case. In the first place he was speaking
in the House of Lords, and not purporting to lay down any principle
to be applied by the Court of Appeal. Further, he was speaking with
reference to a case in which there had been a jury trial, whereas in
the instant case the trial was by a judge sitting alone, who was
consequently judge both of law and of fact. 

 In
my opinion the principle to be followed by this court was indicated
by Salmon LJ in his observations in Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1968] 2 QB 157 at pages 186, 187, in a passage which was cited in Maxwell v Forde, St John (1974) 22 WIR 12 at page 17. In this passage, Salmon LJ said: 




‘ No
doubt, even when a libel action has been tried by a judge alone an
appellate tribunal may sometimes approach the case by considering, as
a matter of law, whether the words complained of are capable of the
defamatory meaning which they have been found to bear. If they are,
the appellate tribunal will not lightly interfere with the judge’s
finding of fact. If, however, the appellate tribunal is satisfied
that the judge’s finding of fact is wrong, it is its duty to
reverse him. There is no sensible reason why a judge’s finding of
fact in a libel action should be more sacrosanct than in any other
action.’ 




 115 

 It
will be convenient to approach the matter in the same way as did the
trial judge, and I will deal first with the complaint about the trial
judge’s finding in regard to the imputation pleaded in paragraph
4(a) of the statement of claim. 

 As
I understood him, Mr Barrow for the appellant contended that in
sustaining this imputation the trial judge had relied almost
completely on a passage from the speech of Lord Devlin in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1963] 2 WLR 1063, at page 1095, and overlooked a portion of his
other observations at page 1094. On page 1095 Lord Devlin said: 




‘ It
is not, therefore, correct to say as a matter of law that a statement
of suspicion imputes guilt. It can be said as a matter of practice
that it very often does so, because although suspicion of guilt is
something different from proof of guilt, it is the broad impression
conveyed by the libel that has to be considered and not the meaning
of each word under analysis. A man who wants to talk at large about
smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to
exclude the suggestion that there is also a fire; but it can be done.
 One always gets back to the fundamental question what is the meaning
that the words convey to the ordinary man: you cannot make a rule
about that. They can convey a meaning of suspicion short of guilt;
but loose talk about suspicion can very easily convey the impression
that it is a suspicion that is well founded.’ 




 At
page 1094, going over to page 1095, Lord Devlin had said: 




‘ When
an imputation is made in a general way, the ordinary man is not
likely to distinguish between hints and allegations, suspicion and
guilt. It is the broad effect that counts and it is no use
submitting to a judge that he ought to dissect the statement before
he submits it to the jury. But, if, on the other hand, the
distinction clearly emerges from the words used it cannot be ignored.
 If it is said of a man ‘I do not believe that he is guilty of
fraud but I cannot deny that he has given grounds for suspicion’,
it seems to me to be wrong to say that in no circumstances can they
be justified except by the speaker proving the truth of that which he
has expressly said he did not believe. It must depend on whether the
impression conveyed by the speaker is one of frankness or one of
insinuation.’ 




 As
I understood him, Mr Barrow contended that on a balance of
probabilities the ordinary man would not have arrived at the
proposition that when the article said that the respondent was the
prime suspect, it was intended to impute or hint at the proposition
that the respondent was guilty. That contention, he submitted, was
supported by the vey factor which the trial judge rejected, namely
the addition at the end of the article of the words: “It is not
known whether Smith recognised any of his attackers”. The addition
of those words was clearly to put the public on notice that while
they said that the respondent was the prime 

 116 

 suspect,
they also said that they did not have any proof that he was guilty
nor did they have any material for inferring guilt. The appellant,
he submitted, was at pains to point out the difference between proof
of guilt and the imputation of guilt, and this fell squarely into the
category mentioned by Lord Devlin: that it was wrong to ask a man to
justify the truth of that which he had expressly said that he did not
believe. 

 I
am unable to accept this contention. Lord Devlin, as I understood
him, spoke of a case in which the writer of the article complained of
had expressly said that he did not believe that the complainant was
guilty, so that the distinction between an allegation of suspicion
and an allegation of guilt clearly emerged. In the instant case, I
can find no statement, either express or implied, in which the writer
said he did not believe in the guilt of the respondent. 

 Further,
as I understand it, the matter is not proof of what meaning the
ordinary man would attach to the article, so as to raise the question
of a balance of probabilities. What we are here dealing with is a
question of construction. The nature of the question was indicated
by Lord Reid in Lewis v Telegraph Ltd [1963] 2 WLR 1063 at page 1069, where he said: 




‘ The
leading case is Capital and Counties Bank Ltd v George Henty&amp;Sons (1882) 7 App Cas 741 at page 745. In that case Lord Selborne LC
said: ‘The test, according to the authorities, is, whether under
the circumstances in which the writing was published, reasonable men,
to whom the publication was made, would be likely to understand it in
a libellous sense ...’ In Nevill v Fine Art and General Insurance Co Ltd [1897] AC 68 at pages 72, 73 Lord Halsbury said: ‘... what is the
sense in which any ordinary reasonable man would understand the words
of the communication so as to expose the plaintiff to hatred or
contempt or ridicule ... it is not enough to say that by some person
or another the words might be understood in a defamatory sense’. 
These statements of the law appear to have been generally accepted
and I would not attempt to re-state a general principle. 

 In
this case it is, I think, sufficient to put the test in this way. 
Ordinary men and women have different temperaments and outlooks. 
Some are unusually suspicious and some are unusually naïve. One
must try to envisage people between these two extremes and see what
is the most damaging meaning they would put on the words in
question.’ 




 What
did the trial judge have before him in the present case? First,
there was the bold headline: “YPF LEADER BASHED&amp;STABBED. RAY
LIGHTBURN AND GANG ARE SUSPECTS”. After giving an account of the
crime, the article proceeded: “It has been established beyond a
doubt that it was a political crime”, thus narrowing the field of
persons who had committed the crime to some of Smith’s political
opponents. Later on, the respondent is said not merely to be a
suspect but to have become the prime suspect. This pin-pointed the respondent. 

 117 

 It
also said that the respondent was an associate of Silky Stuart who
was a gunman. Additionally, the account of how the respondent and
his gang of paid henchmen walked into the Melting Pot Disco when
Smith and a party of friends were there celebrating their successful
meeting, looked around, had a beer each, and walked out, to my mind,
carried with it a veiled suggestion of premeditation. 

 The
appellant himself apparently realised that readers might interpret
the article as saying that the respondent and his gang had stabbed
Bobby Smith, for he said in evidence that the last line of the
article “was put in to prevent precisely such all interpretation”.
 This last line, it will be remembered, read: “It is not known
whether Smith recognised any of his attackers”. The trial judge
did not accept that this addition had had the effect of cancelling
the broad impression otherwise conveyed by the article, and I agree
with him. The last line does not say that the writer did not think
that the respondent had committed the crime. It does not even go so
far as to say that there was no proof that the respondent had
committed it. The question of proof, in my view, was left open, for
the article said merely: “It is not known whether Smith recognised
any of his attackers”. In other words, he might or might not; we
do not know as yet. There might also have been evidence other than
Smith’s. 

 In
my opinion, the words of the article were certainly capable of having
the meaning alleged in paragraph 4(a) of the statement of claim, and
I see no good reason for disturbing the finding of the trial judge
that they in fact had that meaning. 

 I
turn now to the complaint as to the finding of the trial judge in
regard to paragraph 3(a) of the statement of claim. It will be
remembered in this respect that the trial judge held that the words
of the article in their natural and ordinary meanings meant and were
understood to mean that the respondent was the leader of a criminal
gang of paid henchmen, as alleged. 

 The
article in terms referred to the respondent “and his gang of paid
henchmen”; and the crux of the issue, as I understand it, is
whether the trial judge was wrong in holding that the words of the
article meant that the gang referred to was a criminal gang. The
trial judge appears to have based his finding that the article meant
a criminal gang of paid henchmen on his previous finding that the
broad effect of the article read as a whole was that the respondent
and his gang had bashed and stabbed Bobby Smith. “The impression
given by such a statement,” he said, “in an article which imputes
that the gang has committed a crime is that it is a criminal gang”. 

 Mr
Barrow submitted that to make such a finding was to expand the
meaning which the ordinary man would have placed on the words. The
essence of his argument was that because the gang had committed one
crime, that does not make them a criminal gang. In support of his
contention, he referred to Gatley on Libel and Slander (6th Edn), paragraph 1314, where it is stated: 

 118 




‘ A
general charge of misconduct cannot be justified by an isolated
instance of the conduct imputed. Thus one conviction for libel has
been held to be no justification of a charge that a newspaper
proprietor is a ‘libellous journalist’ ( Wakley
v Cook (1849) 4 Exch 511).’ 




 In
my opinion this reference does not assist on the present issue, for
it refers to the question what evidence is sufficient to justify a
general charge of misconduct, and not to the interpretation of
allegations appearing in an article. In the instant case, in my
view, the fact that the text of the article refers to the commission
by the respondent and his gang of only one crime does not necessarily
mean that the phrase “gang of paid henchmen” was coined by
reference only to that crime. To my mind, the important point, and
the point taken by the trial judge as I understand him, is that the
phrase is used in a context which includes an allegation that that
gang had committed a crime; and so used, it would convey to the
ordinary man the impression that the gang referred to was a criminal
gang. 

 For
the reasons I have given, I agreed with the view taken by the trial
judge on this issue, but the matter does not end there. In the
course of argument, reference was made to a number of dictionaries as
to the meaning of the word “henchman”, the question being, be it
remembered, what meaning that word would convey to the ordinary man
or woman in the context in which it was used. 

 Among
the meanings of the word given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary are “a stout political partisan” and “a mercenary adherent”. 
One of the meanings given to the word in Webster’s New International Dictionary is “a political follower giving active support, especially one
whose support is a matter of personal advantage”. In the Random House Dictionary of the English Language ,
which counsel informed the court is a reputable American dictionary,
“Henchman” is defined as follows: 




‘ an
unscrupulous supporter of a political figure or cause, esp one
motivated by the hope of personal gain: Hitler and his henchmen. 2 a
trusted attendant, supporter or follower. 3 an associate in crime. 
4 Obs a squire or page’. 




 How
is this court to say that the trial judge was wrong in his finding in
question when one of the meanings attributed to the word “henchman”
in a reputable dictionary (particularly of English as used in this
part of the world) is “an associate in crime”? Here again I see
no reason for disturbing the finding of the trial judge; and, in my
opinion, for the reasons I have given, there is no substance in
ground (1) of the grounds of appeal. 

 Alternatively,
the appellant complains that the award of damages made by the trial
judge was too high. In support of that contention he alleges that
the trial judge in assessing the damages erred in law in that he
omitted to have regard to the fact that the appellant had been given
a statement by Bobby Smith saying that the respondent was one of the 

 119 

 persons
who attacked and stabbed him, and that the appellant had published
the words complained of in the honest belief that what Bobby Smith
had told him was true. 

 Mr
Barrow submitted that it is a principle of law that where a defendant
publishes material which he honestly believes to be true, this
justifies a jury in giving nominal damages. In support of his
submission he referred to two cases, Smith
v Scott (1847) 175 ER 241 at page 244 and Davis v Cutbush (1859) 175 ER 820. He added that nowhere in the judgment does it
appear that the trial judge, in assessing the damages, adverted to
that principle. 

 In Smith v Scott the defence was that the report was a fair account of what took place
before the judges when acting in a judicial capacity. Coleridge J
directed the jury, inter alia, as follows: 




‘ If
the defendants publish that which professes to be an account of what
occurred in a court of justice, and it be not correct ... then there
is no justification for its publication. If you should think that
this report, though not correct, is an honest one, and intended to be
a fair account of what happened, that would be a ground for reducing
damages’. 




 I
agree that in the instant case there is nothing in the judgment to
indicate that the trial judge adverted to the principle in question
in assessing the damages. Mr Godfrey submitted that that does not
mean that he did not consider the point; and it would certainly be
strange if he did not do so, for the point was not only pleaded but
argued before him. If it be that he did consider the point and
rejected it, in my opinion he would have been right because the
evidence does not support the contention. 

 It
is true that the appellant said in evidence: 




‘ If
Bobby Smith had not said that he had recognised his attackers, I
would not have published it. I was relying on the truth of Smith’s
statement;’ 




 and
earlier he had said: 




‘ I
did not print exactly what Smith said because journalism experience
taught me I must be very cautious and out of caution and out of
fairness, I refrained from saying specifically that Robert Smith
recognised [the respondent].’ 




 The
fact remains that he did not publish in the article any statement to
the effect that Bobby Smith had slid that he had recognised the
respondent as one of his attackers. Instead he said: “It is not
known whether Smith recognised any of his attackers”. In
cross-examination he said he would not call that statement a lie, and
that a newspaper is not obliged to divulge all its information. 

 If
that statement was not a lie, then it seems to me that its
publication must cast doubt on whether Bobby Smith had indeed told
the appellant 

 120 

 that
he had recognised the respondent as one of his attackers. 

 In
evidence, Michael Myvett said that he had seen Bobby Smith in pain at
the hospital and “he mentioned a few things to me. I came to
conclusion that [the respondent] had inflicted injuries as a result
of what Smith said”. He did not say that Bobby Smith had told him
directly that the respondent was one of his attackers. Myvett’s
evidence suggests that he had to go through a process of thought
before reaching the conclusion that the respondent had inflicted the
injuries. There was also evidence that Bobby Smith had not named any
of his attackers in his statement to the police; and, for reasons
which I have already set out, the trial judge did not accept Smith’s
evidence that he had recognised the respondent as one of his
attackers. I think this is clearly said in the judgment. Further,
the appellant for his part had discredited himself by admitting his
improper efforts to get a US visa for Bobby Smith “just before he
[ie Smith] testified in this case”. 

 If,
on the other hand, the statement in question was a lie, and Bobby
Smith had indeed told the appellant that he had recognised the
respondent as one of his attackers, the publication of that statement
as well as the appellant’s evidence, would indicate that he had
some doubts about relying too much on the truth of Bobby Smith’s
statement. Nevertheless, by a process of insinuation, he succeeded
in writing an article which conveyed exactly the same imputation. 

 The
burden, of course, would have been on the appellant to prove, on a
balance of probabilities, that he had written the article on the
basis of a statement made by Bobby Smith and that his report was an
honest one and intended to be a fair account of what had happened. 
In my opinion, for the reasons which I have given, he did not
discharge that burden. 

 In
this connection, counsel for the respondent submitted, as I
understood him, that even if the appellant had received the report in
question from Bobby Smith, he had been reckless in not checking with
the police before publishing the article. This would not only show
that his report was not an honest one but was a factor which would
lead to an increase in the damages. In support of this submission,
he referred to the comments of Crane JA in Jagan v Burnham (1973) 20 WIR 96 at page 136. 

 The
evidence was that the appellant had checked with the police over the
telephone at about 10.30 a m on the Friday morning. Evidently he
drew a blank, because the recording of the statement which Cpl
Garnett obtained from Bobby Smith at the hospital was not begun until
11.00 a m that day. The appellant said that it did not occur to him
to check with the police again. Apart from Bobby Smith, he spoke
with a number of other persons, Bobby Smith’s wife, other leaders
of the YPF, other leaders of the opposition party, and Mr Rodriguez,
all of whom were very strong that the respondent was responsible for
the stabbing. Further, several people stopped him On the street and
expressed this opinion. There is no suggestion that any of these
(apart from Bobby 

 121 

 Smith)
had been present at the scene, so that their views would be no more
than suspicion. The
Reporter was due to come out that very evening, Friday; and there is no
knowing whether, if the appellant had made another enquiry from the
police, they would have given him their information. It also appears
that in the last sentence of the article, the appellant took some
steps, although unsuccessful ones, to tone down the effect of the
article. In the circumstances, I do not think that his conduct in
publishing the article could actually be described as reckless. That
does not mean, however, that he should not have been more cautious in
what he wrote, making it quite clear that he was not accusing the
respondent of the crime. 

 In
my view, there is no substance in ground (3) of the appeal, and for
the reasons I have given, I would dismiss the appeal. 

 That,
however, does not end the matter. There is a cross-appeal. In it,
the respondent seeks to have the judgment of the court below varied
by a substantial increase in the award of damages. The grounds of
the cross-appeal are as follows: 




‘ (1)
That the trial judge erred in law in holding that the case before him
was not an appropriate one for an award of aggravated damages. 

 (2)
That the trial judge erred in law when, in assessing the quantum of damages, he omitted to have regard to the fact that, as the
evidence showed, the appellant was motivated by malice and spite in
the publication of the article complained of. 

 (3)
That the trial judge erred in law in ruling that an article in the
9th March 1980 issue of The Reporter was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible in that the said article
was relevant to prove aggravation of damages. 

 (4)
That the award of $2500 is unreasonably low having regard to awards
in similar cases in comparable jurisdictions.’ 




 Grounds
(3) and (4) were added at the hearing of the appeal. 

 Counsel
for the respondent, Mr Godfrey, first argued ground (3); but as I
understand the matter, this is really associated with ground (1). 
Copies of the article rejected by the trial judge were made available
to the court without objection from counsel for the appellant. The
article in question appeared in The Reporter of 9th March 1980, while the trial was in progress. 

 In
support of his submission, Mr Godfrey referred to Jagan v Burnham (1973) 20 WIR 96 at page 120 in the Court of Appeal of Guyana where
Bollers CJ said: 




‘ Notwithstanding
that the evidential burden had not shifted onto him, the respondent
nevertheless strengthened his position in relation to the presence of
malice in the mind of the appellants, by introducing into the
evidence issues of the same newspaper published both before and after
the offending publication, which showed that the appellants were
carrying on a campaign of acrimonious attacks on the policy of 

 122 

 the
peoples National Congress Government which is the ruling political
party in power in the country and of which the respondent is the
leader and as a result Prime Minister of this country. 

 The
learned trial judge, however, thought quite erroneously and I quote
his language: ‘to say that these derogatory statements made against
the party of which the Prime Minister is the leader are defamatory
against the Prime Minister as a person would be stretching it too
far, and it cannot be said that anything derogatory of the party is
derogatory of the leader of that party.’ 

 In
so saying the learned judge missed the point completely as to the
purpose for which these articles were tendered in evidence. They
were not tendered as statements defamatory of the Prime Minister as a
person or otherwise, they were tendered for the purpose of showing
the animosity that the appellants held for the respondent, in order
to establish the malice that existed in their mind at the time of the
offending publication. In attacking the policy of the peoples
National Congress Government, of which the respondent was leader, the
appellants were by inference including an attack on the respondent
who as leader of the party must bear some responsibility for its
policy; nor according to the law need those articles include
statements defamatory of the respondent, it would be enough if they
were derogatory statements which would reveal the animus of the appellants towards the respondent. As long ago as 1843 Tindal
CJ in the celebrated case of Pearson v Lemaitre 134 ER 742 laid down the correct rule that: 

‘ Either
party may give evidence to prove or disprove the existence of a
malicious motive in the mind of the publisher of defamatory matter,
but that, if the evidence given for that purpose establishes another
cause of action, the jury should be cautioned against giving any
damages in respect of it. And if such evidence is offered merely for
the purpose of obtaining damages for such other injury, it will be
properly rejected.’’ 




 In McGregor on Damages (13th Edn) page 873, paragraph 1307, it is said: 




‘ [the
jury] may consider what [the defendant’s] conduct has been before
action, after action, and in court during the trial. The defendant’s
conduct is relevant in this way to show whether he has acted with or
without malice. Generally, this is malice in the perpetrating of the
libel, but conduct subsequent to this is relevant either as evidence
of the existence or absence of malice at the time of the tort or
merely as showing that the defendant has behaved well or behaved
badly since the tort. The practical effect is that damages will
fluctuate up or down, with the degree of culpability of the
defendant’s behaviour.’ 




 In
the next paragraph McGregor points out that evidence as to the 

 123 

 existence
or absence of malice in this wide sense is allowed without any clear
division between its relevance to compensatory and to exemplary
damages. 

 Dealing
with evidence to prove malice in aggravation of damages, the author,
in paragraph 1309, states that: 




‘ Malice
may be shown by the defendant’s conduct generally, but there are
two particular ways in which it has come to be shown: by other
derogatory statements made of the plaintiff by the defendant and by
the defendant’s persistence in the accusation, such persistence
being either by way of an unreasonable plea of justification or by
lack of any, or any adequate, apology.’ 




 Returning
to the article in The Reporter newspaper of 9th March 1980, in so far as it was a correct report of
proceedings in a court of justice I do not see how it would have
assisted on the issue of malice. In the second column of the
article, however, the following appeared: 




‘ As
the case opened before Justice George Moe in the appeals courtroom
Wednesday morning the attorney representing [the respondent] Mr Glen
Godfrey of the law firm of Musa and Balderamos applied for an
adjournment on the grounds that his client, [the respondent], was
ill. He said his case would be seriously prejudiced if he were to
proceed without his client. 

 Mr
Dean Barrow, representing The Reporter ,
while sympathetic to the request for adjournment, insisted that the
evidence of the witness Bobby Smith be taken that day since Smith was
leaving the country the following day. 

 After
arguments back and forth Justice Moe ruled that Smith’s
evidence-in-chief would be taken in the morning, and the lunch break
adjournment would be used to allow counsel to consult with his
client, [the respondent]. 

 A
few minutes after the midday adjournment [the respondent] was seen,
hale and hearty, at the Playboy Club in King Street. He entered,
went through a side door, as though looking for somebody, and left
almost immediately.’ 




 Mr
Godfrey submitted, as I understood him, that this part of the article
carried the imputation that the respondent was feigning illness in
order to prevent Bobby Smith from testifying. This, unless justified
on investigation before the court, was libellous of the respondent,
and the article ought to have been admitted in evidence on the
question whether malice existed in the mind of the appellant when he
wrote the article complained of in the action. 

 Having
regard to the principles stated above, I accept this submission. In
my opinion, the article ought to have been admitted in evidence by
the trial judge so that its truth or otherwise and its general effect
could have been gone into. The fact remains, however, that it was
not admitted and made the subject of investigation; and this court is
not in 

 124 

 a
position to say whether or not it was evidence of malice in the mind
of the appellant when he wrote the article complained of. It seems
to me that the only way of having the statements in the article of
9th March 1980 investigated would be to order a retrial. I will
return later to the question whether this should be done. 

 In
arguing grounds (1) and (2) of the cross-appeal, Mr Godfrey urged
that there were other elements of aggravation He mentioned the
absence of any apology and the insistence on the plea of
justification. He conceded that logically these would have to be
linked together and also that the persistence in justification must
have been unreasonable. He submitted that it was unreasonable
because the appellant could have found out from the police about
Bobby Smith’s statements and could then have apologised. 

 It
seems to me that this submission indicates some misapprehension as to
the nature of the defence. In his defence as pleaded, the appellant
did not seek to justify the meanings of the article complained of
which were alleged in paragraphs 3(a) and 4(a) of the statement of
claim. His plea of justification was partial only and limited to the
words without the said meanings. For the rest, his line of defence
was that the words did not bear the meanings alleged. In paragraph 3
of his defence, the appellant pleaded: “The appellant did not mean
and was not understood to mean what is alleged in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the statement of claim”; and in paragraph 4 he pleaded: “The
said words without the said alleged meanings are true in substance
and in fact”. As it was, the trial judge found that the words did
in fact bear the meanings alleged in paragraphs 3(a) and 4(a) of the
statement of claim, and that those meanings had not been justified;
but that otherwise the meanings alleged had been justified. In these
circumstances, in my view, the limited plea of justification put
forward by the appellant could not be said to have been unreasonable,
and I do not attach much weight to his failure to make an apology. 

 Presumably
with reference to ground 2 of the cross-appeal in which it was
alleged that the appellant was motivated by malice and spite in the
publication of the article complained of, Mr Godfrey referred to the
evidence of the appellant in which he admitted that the publication
of the article would have been good for his party and bad for the
other party. In the passage referred to, it is recorded that the
appellant said: 




‘ I
can’t be sure what the effect would be on the elections. It would
not be a good thing for PUP nor for the UDP nor for the country. In
my opinion article would have bad effect on PUP. It could have
helped the UDP.’ 




 As
I understood him, Godfrey submitted that this was evidence that the
appellant had an improper purpose in publishing the article: that
purpose being not to make an honest report of the occurrence, but to
influence the result of the then pending elections to the Belize City
Council by embarrassing the People’s United Party. If that were
so, it 

 125 

 appears
that it would be evidence of express malice which would be a ground
for exemplary damages. In Gatley on Libel and Slander (6th Edn) paragraph 762, it is stated: 




‘ The
plaintiff will succeed in proving the existence of express malice if
he can show that the defendant was not using the occasion honestly
for the purpose for which the law gives protection, but was actuated
by some indirect motive not connected with the privilege.’ 




 In
his evidence, the appellant said: 




‘ I
don’t agree that article was without foundation nor that it was
with malevolence and spite. It was not purpose of publication to
cause political embarrassment to the [respondent] and the party he is
associated with so as to influence the results of the said
elections.’ 




 To
my mind there is a clear distinction between the occurrence of a
result and an intention to cause that result. It is true that,
according to the evidence, when the article was published, the city
council elections were not more than one week away and also that at
the time the respondent was a close associate (or “man of action”
according to Bobby Smith) of the PUP while Bobby Smith was leader of
the Youth Popular Front, which was supporting the UDP. It was also
true that the appellant was a candidate in the city council
elections, in which he was supporting the UDP. But when all is said
and done, the stabbing of Smith did occur; it did create a sensation
in Belize City; and there was evidence, and indeed it was conceded by
the respondent himself, that even before The Reporter came out on the evening in question, a considerable number of persons
suspected the respondent of having committed the crime. The trial
judge also found that the allegation in the article that the stabbing
of Bobby Smith was a politically-motivated crime was justified. 
Further, in cross-examination, the witness Michael Myvett said: “I
don’t think article had anything to do with the election. UDP was
on the way to winning the election”. 

 In
the circumstances, the trial judge evidently found himself unable to
draw (from the mere fact that the publication of the article at that
time might have embarrassed the PUP and benefited the UDP) the
inference that the appellant’s object in publishing it was in fact
to cause embarrassment to the PUP with a view to influencing the
elections, for he said in his judgment: 




‘ The
[respondent] asked for damages on the basis of aggravated or
exemplary damages. I do not find that this is an appropriate case
for 

 such
an award.’ 




 I
see no reason for disturbing his finding in this connection. 

 Mr
Godfrey further submitted that the article complained of was spiteful
in that it referred to the respondent as an associate of Silky
Stuart, who was described as a “gunman”; and that the wording of
the article was excessively strong and violent. He referred to Jagan v Burnham (1973) 20 WIR 96 at page 118 where Bollers CJ said: 

 126 




‘ The
indirect or improper motive may be proved by intrinsic evidence which
consists of the terms of the defamatory statement itself, and which
indicates the mind of the writer at the time of publication. In this
case the language of the writer was so excessively strong and violent
against the respondent, who happened to be the head of the
Government, that in my opinion it can be safely presumed that there
was malice existing in the mind of the appellants who, on the
pleadings, admitted the publication.’ 




 In
the instant case there was evidence, which was not disputed, that the
respondent was a good friend of Silky Stuart, being seen frequently
with him, and that the latter had pulled a gun during a public
meeting and shot four or five persons. It also appears from the
evidence that the word “gang” as used locally did not in itself
necessarily convey a derogatory meaning. Bobby Smith in evidence,
referring to his own associates, said: “I left the gang and took
off”. There was also evidence that there was a group with whom the
respondent was closely associated. According to Michael Myvett- 




‘ As
far as I am concerned [the respondent] is always with a group
particularly Spooky, Thousand and Ideas. I would see them at disco,
on street, football, boxing.’ 




 He
also referred to them as a “gang”. Later in his evidence he
said: 




‘ Before The Reporter hit the streets, I had a meeting with members of public as to
stabbing incident. There was a consensus as to who might be
responsible. [The respondent] and his gang.’ 




 There
was also an admission by the respondent that Ideas and Spooky were
associates of his, although he said in effect that it was a limited
association. In his evidence he said: 




‘ Ideas
and Spooky worked along with me. I moved with them, not frequently
but when we had a job to do. Painting or building. We moved
socially a couple of times. We don’t move as a group.’ 




 In
the circumstances, the trial judge evidently came to the conclusion
that the wording of the article complained of, while defamatory of
the respondent, was not so excessively strong and violent against him
that it could be safely presumed that there was malice existing in
the mind of the appellant when he wrote the article, for he found (as
I have already pointed out) that this was not an appropriate case for
the award of aggravated or exemplary damages. 

 This
court will not lightly disturb a finding of fact made by the court
below and I see no good reason for disturbing what appears to have
been the finding of the trial judge in this particular respect. 

 Counsel
next returned to his contention, as I understood him, that aggravated
damages ought to have been awarded with one further submission This
was in connection with the conduct of the appellant 

 127 

 in
writing a letter to the American consul, shortly before Bobby Smith
testified, in which he gave a wrong impression about Smith for the
purpose of helping him to get a visa to go to the United States of
America. Counsel referred to this as the price of Bobby Smith giving
evidence as he did, ‘remembering what he did not remember in his
statement to the police,” and submitted that this conduct on the
appellant’s part would amount to aggravation, meaning (as I
understood him) that it showed the length to which the appellant was
prepared to go to persist in the libel. As I see it, however, it
could also (and is more likely to) indicate no more than that the
appellant sought to defend himself against the allegation in
paragraph 4(a) of the statement of claim, but went to improper
lengths to do so. Further, the record does not indicate that the
submission made to this court in this connection was made to the
trial judge and it seems to be an after-thought. This supports my
view that the inference from the appellant’s conduct now suggested
by counsel is not the most likely one. Certainly it does not appear
to have occurred to the trial judge, for he did not find that this
was an appropriate case for an award of aggravated damages; and that
in spite of the fact that the appellant’s conduct in question must
have been very much in his mind, being one of the grounds on which he
rejected Bobby Smith’s evidence about recognising the respondent as
one of his attackers. 

 In
support of ground (4) of the cross-appeal counsel for the respondent
referred to four cases: (1) Jagan
v Burnham (1973) 20 WIR 96 in which the Prime Minister of Guyana was awarded
damages in the sum of $25,000; (2) D’Aguiar
v New Guiana Co Ltd [1963] LRBG 365 in which the plaintiff was awarded $14,400; the
report is not available and there is only a very brief reference to
this case in Jagan v Burnham (1973) 20 WIR 96 at page 110; (3) Maxwell
v Forde, St John (1974) 22 WIR 12; in this case both the respondents were
barristers-at-law in Barbados and there were imputations against each
in a newspaper article of grave professional impropriety, unfitness
to serve in the legislature, and unpatriotic conduct; the trial judge
awarded $35,000 to St John and $30,000 to Forde; an appeal to the
Court of Appeal of Barbados was dismissed; and (4) Advocate
Co Ltd v Husbands (1969) 15 WIR 180; in this case the respondent, a barrister-at-law,
held the office of Director of Public Prosecutions in Barbados; an
article was published in the appellants’ newspaper which, it was
alleged, imputed that the respondent had been neither honest nor
straightforward in the execution of the functions of his office; the
trial judge awarded the respondent $20,000, and an appeal to the
Court of Appeal of Barbados was dismissed. 

 Counsel
for the respondent also referred to Ramsahoye v Taylor (unreported) in which there was an award of $20,000 damages. This
case is only very briefly mentioned in Jagan v Burnham (1973) 20 WIR 96. Counsel informed the court that Dr Ramsahoye was a
university lecturer. 

 Mr
Barrow for the appellant commented that in all the above- 

 128 

 mentioned
cases the damages awarded were high. That would not mean, he
submitted, that the damages awarded in them were the going figures
for libel in these jurisdictions. In this connection I note that in Jagan v Burnham mention was made of two other cases not referred to by counsel for
the respondent in which the damages were low. At page 110 Luckhoo C
stated: 




‘ In D’Aguiar v Jagan [1963] BGLR 404, the sum of one thousand dollars ($1000) was awarded
whilst in Ramsahoye v Peter Taylor [1964] LRBG 329, where plaintiff did not suffer any humiliation, the
sum of one thousand four hundred and forty dollars ($ 1440) was
awarded.’ 




 Mr
Barrow further submitted that there was no principle of law or of
practice which required some comparability of awards in the different
territories in this region. For one thing, there would be
differences between territories in levels of population and the
degree of circulation of the libel. I am not aware of any such
principle or practice. It is true that in Jagan v Burnham (1973) 20 WIR 96 at page 110, it appears that the trial judge
considered the cases to which he had been referred; but on the appeal
Luckhoo C said (at page 106): 




‘ It
is well settled law that an appellate court is always reluctant to
interfere with a finding of the trial judge on any question of fact,
but it is particularly reluctant to interfere with a finding on
damages, especially in cases where damages are a matter of impression
and common sense. Of course if it is out of all proportion to the
circumstances of the case, that would be another matter. In an
action for defamation, the award of a judge is so much a matter of
individual choice involving the exercise of a discretion, that an
appellate court would be particularly slow to disturb it except [if]
satisfied that he acted on a wrong principle of law, or has
misapprehended the facts, or has, for these or other reasons, made a
wholly erroneous estimate of the damages (see Davies v Powell Duffryn Associated Colleries Ltd (No 2) [1942] 1 All ER 657). It is not enough that there exists a
difference of opinion or preference. The scale must go down heavily
against the figure attacked if the appellate court is to interfere,
whether on the ground of excess or insufficiency. (See Flint v Lovell [1935] 1 KB 354). 

 As
Lord Radcliffe so eloquently put it in Associated Newspapers Ltd v Dingle [1962] 2 All ER at page 742: 

‘ A
trial judge awarding damages for this kind of tort (defamation) is
habitually allowed a certain pre-eminence for his assessment above
the assessments that might independently commend themselves to an
appeal court... An appeal court rejects his figure only in ‘very
special’ or ‘very exceptional’ cases.’’ 




 On
page 107 Luckhoo C continued: 




‘ It
would, therefore, be quite wrong to think that damages can be
categorised within the confines of levels of awards previously made 

 129 

 in
other cases as if those constituted precedents to be followed. No
such limitation in law exists, for each case must be considered in
the light of all its relevant factors and prevailing circumstances,
and without the impediments of inapplicable restraints. That is why
in recognition of this freedom, the law says that damages are to be
‘at large’ - judged on the merits and the impression and common
sense of the particular case, which would take into account its
special features, that is, the heinous nature of the defamation, the
position and standing of the person defamed, the resulting harm and
hurt caused, the motivation behind the publication, the extent of its
falsity and circumstances of aggravation, and the conduct of the
defamers before action, after action and in court during the trial,
etc.’ 




 To
my mind, the instant case has a very special feature. This is the
evidence, including the admission by the respondent himself, that he
was widely suspected of the crime even before The Reporter newspaper with the article complained of appeared on the streets. In
the record, the cross-examination of the respondent reads as follows: 




‘ I
would agree that I was one of the persons suspected in the incident
before the paper was out. 

 Q
Would you agree that paper goes no further than saying you were a
suspect. A I feel it goes further. It hints because of what people said. 

 Q
If it had said that you were a suspect among other suspects would it
have reflected prevailing opinion. A If it had done only that it would have reflected prevailing opinion. 
Maybe especially malicious people. When I heard that Smith was
stabbed, I heard that I was a suspect ...’ 




 and
in re-examination the respondent said: 




‘ It
was a large group that felt I was a suspect. People who went to
political meetings. After paper, the group got larger. When I say
prevailing opinion. Before paper came out, I heard from one person. 
When I said prevailing opinion I meant after paper came out.’ 




 It
will be seen that in the last three sentences, the respondent made an
attempt to whittle down what he had said; but in my view it was
unsuccessful. He plainly admitted (and in re-examination) that he
was suspected by a large group, and after the paper it got larger. 
In other words, the damage done to his reputation by the article
complained of was only additional to the damage which had been caused
to it before the article appeared. No doubt the trial judge took
that into account. 

 In
one respect, however, in my opinion, the trial judge erred in law. 
As I have already pointed out, this was in his failure to admit in
evidence the article which appeared in The Reporter dated 9th March 1980 on the question whether there was malice in the
mind of the appellant when he wrote the article complained of; and,
if so, whether the damages should 

 130 

 be
increased. I have already dealt with this matter, and the question
now for consideration is whether a re-trial should be ordered so that
this evidence may be admitted and gone into. 

 Section
22(2)( a )
of the Court of Appeal Ordinance 1967 is in the following terms: 




‘ On
the hearing of an appeal in any civil cause or matter, the following
provisions shall apply - ( a )
a new trial shall not be ordered on the ground of misdirection, or of
the improper admission or rejection of evidence unless in the opinion
of the court some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
been thereby occasioned;’. 




 The
question for this court accordingly, as I see it, is whether a
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has been occasioned to
the respondent by the rejection of the evidence in question. As I
have pointed out, on investigation of the matter before the trial
judge, the result might have gone either way. Let us assume,
however, that it turned out in favour of the respondent and that the
effect of the article was found to indicate malice in the mind of the
appellant at the time he wrote the article complained of. I ask
myself whether there would have been a substantial increase in the
damages awarded? 

 As
I have already pointed out, one of the most striking features of this
case is the evidence, including the admission by the respondent
himself, that the respondent was suspected of the crime by a large
group of people even before The Reporter newspaper, with the article complained of, appeared on the streets. 
The effect of the article was therefore merely to extend and increase
the humiliation to which he was already subject. In my view, this
was a circumstance which could not have failed to weigh heavily with
the trial judge; and I do not think that any increase in the damages
which might have resulted from the article of 9th Match 1980 would
have been large. Consequently, I am unable to say that any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has been occasioned to
the respondent by the failure of the trial judge to admit that
article in evidence. 

 For
the reasons I have given, I would dismiss both the appeal and the
cross-appeal and would order that the appellant and the respondent
should each bear his own costs of the proceedings in this court. 

 Blair-Kerr
P. At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal? I was clearly of
the opinion that the appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed; and
I recorded my reasons for reaching this conclusion. 

 Since
then I have had the advantage of studying in draft the views of my
brothers. With the greatest respect to Sir Clifford Inniss JA, I am
unable to agree that the words of the article complained of were
capable of having the extended meaning alleged in paragraph 4(a) of
the statement of claim. 

 I
find myself in substantial agreement with the views expressed by 

 131 

 Georges
JA and with the order proposed, that is to say that the appeal and
cross-appeal be both dismissed and that there be no order as to
costs.

 SIR
ALASTAIR BLAIR-KERR P, SIR JAMES SMITH AND DA COSTA JJA 

 8TH
17TH NOVEMBER 1982, 26TH JANUARY 1983 

 Fundamental
rights and freedoms – Fair trial within a reasonable time –
Person charged with criminal offence – Meaning of “charged” –
No undue delay – Constitution of Bermuda, section 6(1) 

 The
appellant, who had been under police surveillance since February
1981, was arrested on suspicion of drugs offences on 6th August 1981
Four others were arrested at the same time. The appellant was
granted bail by the police immediately under the Criminal Code,
section 462(2), whilst they pursued their enquiries. On 28th April
1982, a police inspector swore an affidavit before a justice that the
appellant had had a controlled drug in his possession on 6th August
which was intended for supply. A summons was issued on that day
requiring the appellant to answer the charge. The appellant was
initially remanded in custody, but was later released again on bail. 
The magistrate adjourned the case, which had involved a great deal of
preparation, until 28th June. On 21st June the appellant applied to
the Supreme Court for redress under section 15 of the Constitution,
alleging that his right to a fair hearing of a criminal charge within
a reasonable time under section 6(1) of the Constitution had been
infringed. The Chief Justice dismissed the application. On appeal, 

 Held dismissing the appeal that - 

 (1)
The appellant had not been “charged with a criminal offence”
(section 6(1) of the Constitution) until 28th April 1982;
accordingly, the complaint of delay in bringing him to trial was
ill-founded. 

 R
v Norfolk Quarter Sessions, ex parte Brunson [1953] 1 All ER 346 applied. 

 (2)
Even had the appellant been “charged” for the purposes of section
6(1) on 6th August 1981, the delay in bringing him to trial (on the
facts of the case) could not properly be said to have amounted to
undue delay.

 Appeal 

 Appeal The appellant, Alvin Eugene Chapman, applied by originating summons
dated 21st June 1982 to the Supreme Court for a declaration that his
right to a fair trial on a criminal charge within a reasonable time
(under the Constitution of Bermuda, section 6(1)) had been infringed.
 Sir James Astwood CJ dismissed the application and the appellant
appealed to the Court of Appeal for Bermuda (civil appeal 15 of
1982). The Attorney-General and the Commissioner of Police were the
respondents to the appeal. The court dismissed the appeal on 17th
November 1982, but reserved its reasons. 

 Mrs
de Soysa for the appellant 

 Quin for the respondents 

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Sir
Alastair Blair-Kerr P. From the papers placed before us on this a appeal, it would appear
that the police began observing the appellant’s activities about
1st February 1981. Detective Constable Henry states that on 10th
June 1981 he began a period of surveillance on the alleged unlawful
activities of the appellant and others at Parsons Road, Pembroke;
that he continued regular weekly and sometimes daily surveillance
there and that the appellant was present on these occasions; that
these unlawful activities were of a continuing nature; and that he
observed unlawful activities on the part of the plaintiff from June
1981 to 14th January 1982, when these activities appeared to cease. 

 We
also have Detective Constable O’Meara’s affidavit. He states
that he began observing the alleged unlawful activities of the
appellant and others on 19th June 1981; that his surveillance
continued weekly, sometimes daily; that the appellant was present on
those occasions; and that from June 1981 until late November 1981 he
took 1664 photographs of activities, unlawful under the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1972, involving the appellant and others in relation to the
charges now before the court. 

 There
is also an affidavit by Sergeant Farrell, who states that between
June 1981 and January 1982 the police photographic department
received from narcotics officers forty rolls of 35-millimetre films
for processing in respect of observations which had been carried out
in the Parsons Road district of Pembroke; that these observations
were specifically related to the appellant; that the processing
involved a great deal of work; that, due to the number of defendants,
the potential number of defence counsel and the normal court
requirements, it is antiticpated that at least eighteen albums of
photographs will be required and that there will be over 5000
photographs. 

 It
appears that the appellant was arrested on 6th August 1981. In his
affidavit of 29th June 1982, Sergeant Arnfield states that on that
day he saw certain things which gave him reasonable grounds for
causing the arrest of the appellant and four others “on suspicion
of certain offences 

 134 

 under
the Misuse of Drugs Act”. He was immediately put on police bail. 
We have before us a “recognisance of bail granted by a police
officer” dated 21st December 1981, from which it appears that the
appellant bound himself to appear at Hamilton police station on 25th
January 1982, in default of which he bound himself to forfeit $500. 

 He
did not report to the police on 25th January 1982. The appellant
left Bermuda on 14th January 1982 and returned to Bermuda on 14th
April 1982. In his affidavit of 17th June 1982, he states that he
left Bermuda to obtain medical treatment. The only evidence of
medical treatment before us is a health insurance claim dated 31st
January 1982, which indicates that he had an x-ray of the colon in
Hawaii on 27th January 1982 at a cost of $145.08. From an
examination of his passport, it appears that the appellant spent a
week in the Bahamas (14th January 1982), ten days in Hong Kong (5th
February 1982), two weeks in Bangkok (14th February to 1st March
1982) and that he also visited England, Hawaii and the United States
of America. 

 The
appellant had been on police bail from the date of his arrest; and
between that date and 21st December 1981 he reported at Hamilton
police station on four occasions. 

 On
28th April 1982 (i e fourteen days after the appellant had returned
to Bermuda) Inspector Flook swore an information before a justice of
the peace. In it, he alleged that on 6th August 1981 the appellant
had in his possession a controlled drug, namely diamorphine ,
which was intended for supply in contravention of sections 5(1) and
6(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972; and the summons to the
appellant dated 28th April 1982, containing this charge, required him
to appear before the magistrate on 30th April 1982 “to answer to
the said charge”. 

 The
appellant appeared with his attorney on 30th April. The
Attorney-General appeared for the Crown. He opposed bail; and the
appellant was remanded in custody. The magistrate ordered that the
case should come up for mention on 14th May 1982. Upon his
application to a judge of the Supreme Court, the appellant was
granted bail on 3rd May 1982. 

 On
14th May the magistrate adjourned the case for mention on 28th May
1982. It was further adjourned by the magistrate for mention on 10th
June and 24th June 1982. 

 Chapter
1 of the Constitution of Bermuda provides for the protection of the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Section 1 states
that those fundamental rights and freedoms are: (a) life, liberty,
security of the person and the protection of the law; (b) freedom of
conscience, of expression, and of assembly and association; and (c)
protection for the privacy of his house and other property and from
deprivation of property without compensation. Section 2 deals with
“protection of the right to life”. Section 3 provides for
protection from inhumane treatment. Section 4 provides for
protection from slavery and forced labour. Section 5 provides for
protection from arbitrary arrest or detention; and in section 6 there
arc provisions to secure the protection 

 135 

 of
the law. Section 6(1) provides as follows: 




‘ If
any person is charged with a criminal offence, then, unless the
charge is withdrawn, the case shall be afforded a fair hearing within
a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established
by law.’ 




 And
section 15(1) and (2)( a )
read: 




‘ (1)
If any person alleges that any of the foregoing provisions of this
Chapter has been, is being or is likely to be contravened in relation
to him, then, without prejudice to any other action with respect to
the same matter which is lawfully available, that person may apply to
the Supreme Court for redress. 

 (2)
The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction - ( a )
to hear and determine any application made by any person in pursuance
of subsection (1) of this section;’ 




 By
his originating summons dated 21st June 1982, the “redress”
sought by the appellant was as follows: 




‘ (1)
A declaration that: (a) the [appellant’s] constitutional rights
have been infringed under section 6(1) of the Bermuda Constitution
Order 1968 in that the [appellant] has not been afforded a fair
hearing within a reasonable time. 

 (2)
An order that: (a) The [appellant] be discharged from all further
and/or pending proceedings arising out of the same facts and/or
issues based on the charges contained in the summons dated 28th April
1982...’ 




 On
28th June 1982, Inspector Flook swore another information. This
information alleged offences against the following persons: The
appellant (Chapman), Robert F Trott, Raymond M Grant, Earlston S
Young, Ervin E Young, and Kirk H de Rosa. The information alleged
that these six persons, being concerned together, between 1st
February 1981 and 14th April 1982, committed the following offences: 




‘ 1.
 Did conspire together to supply to others a controlled drug, namely diamorphine ,
contrary to section 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972, as read with
section 5(3)( a )
of the said Act. 

 2.
 Did conspire together to supply to others a controlled drug, namely
cannabis resin, contrary to section 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act
1972, as read with section 5(3)( a )
of the said Act. 

 3.
 Being concerned together did supply to others a controlled drug,
namely diamorphine ,
contrary to section 5(3)( a )
of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972. 

 4.
 Being concerned together did supply to others a controlled drug,
namely cannabis resin, contrary to section 5(3)( a )
of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972. 

 136 

 5.
 Being concerned together did knowingly handle a controlled drug,
namely diamorphine ,
which was intended for supply in contravention of section 5(1) of the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1972, contrary to section 7(1) of the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1972. 

 6.
 Being concerned together did knowingly handle a controlled drug,
namely cannabis resin, which was intended for supply in contravention
of section 5(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972, contrary to section
7(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972. 

 7. Alvin
E Chapman on 6th August 1981 in Pembroke parish did have in your possession a
controlled drug, namely diamorphine ,
which was intended for supply in contravention of section 5(1) of the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1972, contrary to section 6(3) of said Act. 

 8. Robert
F Trott on 6th August 1981 in Pembroke parish did misuse a controlled drug,
namely diamorphine ,
contrary to section 8(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972, as read
with section 33(2) of said Act.’ 




 On
28th June 1982, summonses were issued against all six persons. So
far as the appellant is concerned, the seventh charge is in precisely
the same terms as the charge in the summons dated 28th April 1982. 
The summonses dated 28th June 1982 required the appellant and the
five other persons to appear before the magistrate on 29th June 1982
to answer to the charges. On 29th June, all six persons appeared and
the appellant was charged with the seven offences in the summons date
28th June. Sergeant Arnfield applied to the magistrate to withdraw
the original information sworn on 28th April 1982, as the charge in
that information was identical to the seventh charge in the summons
dated 28th June 1982. The application was opposed by counsel for the
appellant; and the application was not granted. The magistrate
remanded the appellant on bail to 22nd July 1982. 

 The
returnable date of the originating summons was 30th June 1982. Sir
James Astwood CJ heard the summons on 14th July 1982. Mrs de Soysa
appeared for the appellant. Sir James Astwood CJ recorded counsel’s
submissions in paragraphs. The following is Sir James’s note of
some of Mrs de Soysa’s submissions: 




‘ 15.
 ... that on the charge for which the [appellant] was arrested on 6th
June 1981 he should have been afforded a fair hearing by now ... 

 20.
 Submits that in June 1982 the Attorney-General not ready to proceed
and he wanted [the appellant] remanded in custody. This, she
submits, is the start of oppression ... 

 23.
 Submits that in her original originating summons she asked for an
order on one charge. That charge still here on file. It has not
been withdrawn to date. 

 24.
 Refers to originating summons (2)( a ),
and submits that new charges come under the order sought here. 

 137 

 25.
 Submits that it has gone undenied that the new charges are based on
same facts. 

 26.
 Submits that the [appellant] does not have any new facts and the
respondents have not denied this in their affidavits. Therefore the
declaration sought is equally relevant to the new charges ... 

 39.
 Submits ‘charge’ in section 6(1) of Constitution must mean
‘accusation’. He was arrested and bailed on charges on 6th June
1981. Submits time must run from 6th June 1981. Date of arrest ... 

 52.
 ... Submits: look at charges in new information and submits that
they are all base [sic] on same facts and issues.’ 




 From
these notes it would appear that counsel for the appellant sought a
declaration from the court that the appellant’s constitutional
rights had been infringed in that he had not been afforded a fair
hearing within a reasonable time of all the charges contained in both informations . 

 Sir
James Astwood CJ gave judgment on 20th July 1982. He refused the
relief sought and dismissed the summons. 

 The
appellant appealed to this court, and the appeal was heard on 8th
November 1982. Mrs de Soysa appeared for the appellant. Her
submissions to this court differed materially from her submissions to
Sir James Astwood CJ. The last words in her reply were: 




‘ We
ask for a declaration on the holding charge. We can not ask for a
declaration on any other charges. We ask for an order discharging
the appellant in respect of the charge in the summons dated 28th
April 1982 and the seventh charge in the summons dated 28th June
1982.’ 




 Accordingly
the relief sought in the notice of appeal was amended to read: 




‘ (a)
A declaration that the appellant’s constitutional rights have been
infringed under section 6(1) of the Bermuda Constitution Order 1968
in that the appellant has not been afforded a fair trial within a
reasonable time in respect of the charge of possession of diamorphine with intent to supply, contrary to sections 5(1) and 6(3) of the
Misuse of Drugs Act. 

 (b)
An order that the appellant be discharged from all further and/or any
pending proceedings arising out of the same facts and/or issues based
on the charge contained in the summons dated 28th April 1982 and the
seventh charge contained in the summons dated 29th June 1982. 




 On
17th November 1982 we gave judgment. We refused to make the
declaration and order sought; and we dismissed the appeal with costs,
indicating that we would give our reasons in writing as soon as
possible. 

 Before
the magistrate on 29th June 1982, the Crown had stated that it was
ready to proceed with the preliminary enquiry in respect of the seven
charges on 22nd July 1982. The file relating to the investigation of
the seven charges was complete and ready for service on the appellant
before 22nd July 1982. However, counsel for the respondents informed 

 138 

 Sergeant
Arnfield that on 22nd July counsel for the appellant would apply for
a stay in the proceedings until the determination of the appeal
relating to the originating summons; and on 22nd July counsel for the
appellant applied to the senior magistrate for an order staying the
proceedings until the determination of this appeal. A similar
application was made by counsel for the appellant on 12th August
1982. The magistrate granted the appellant’s application and
adjourned the matter until 29th October 1982. 

 Therefore,
when considering that question whether there has been delay in
bringing the appellant to trial, the period July to November 1982 may
be disregarded and, of course, having regard to the approach of
counsel for the appellant before this court, we were concerned only
with the one charge of possession of heroin intended for supply
which, according to counsel for the appellant, was preferred against
the appellant not on 28th April 1982, but on 6th August 1981. 

 But
was the appellant “charged” on 6th August 1981? Mr Quin informed
us that the appellant was not charged when arrested; that he was
arrested “on suspicion”; and that he was not charged until 28th
April 1982. 

 The
statutory authority for the grant of police bail is contained in
section 462 of the Criminal Code. Section 462(1) and (2) read as
follows: 




‘ (1)
Notwithstanding anything in the last foregoing section, on a person
being taken into custody upon a charge of an offence where the person
has been arrested without a warrant, a police officer not below the
rank of sergeant may in any case, and shall, if it will not in his
opinion be practicable to bring such person before a court of summary
justice within twenty-four hours after he was so taken into custody,
enquire into the case, and unless the offence appears to such police
officer to be of a serious nature, shall release the person upon his
entering into a recognisance with or without sureties of a reasonable
amount to appear before a court of summary jurisdiction at the time
and place named in the recognisance; but where such person is
detained in custody he shall be brought before a magistrate as soon
as practicable. 

 (2)
Where, on a person being taken into custody for an offence without a
warrant, it appears to any such officer as aforesaid that the enquiry
into the case cannot be completed forthwith, he may release the
person on his entering into a recognisance with or without sureties
for a reasonable amount, conditioned for his appearance at such a
police station and at such a time as is named in the recognisance
unless he previously receives a notice in writing from the officer in
charge of that police station that his attendance is not required;
and any such recognisance may be enforced as if it were conditioned
for the appearance of that person before a court of summary
jurisdiction.’ 




 The
difference in phraseology between section 462(1) and (2) is apparent.
 What is contemplated by section 462(1) is the situation of a 

 139 

 person
“taken into custody upon a charge of an offence”. The
corresponding phrase in section 462(2) is “taken into custody for
an offence”. In the one case, the person arrested, upon being
released on bail, binds himself to appear before a magistrate at a
time and place named in the recognisance (section 462(1)). If “the
enquiry into the case” cannot be completed forthwith, when released
on bail, the person arrested binds himself to appear at the police
station at such time as is named in the recognisance. 

 Section
462(1) is, for all practical purposes, in the same terms as section
22 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act 1914. Section 45 of
the Criminal Justice Act 1925 reads as follows: 




‘ The
section substituted by section 22 of the Criminal Justice
Administration Act 1914 for section 38 of the Summary Jurisdiction
Act 1879, shall have effect as though the following subsection were
added thereto ...’ 




 And
the “following subsection” is, for all practical purposes, in the
same terms as section 462(2) of the Criminal Code. The side note to
section 45 of the 1925 Act reads: “Power to release on bail before
charge is accepted”. 

 The
form of recognisance used by the police appears to be one they use
when the person arrested is bailed either under section 462(1) or
under section 462(2). It reads as follows: 




‘ Recognisances
of Bail Granted by a Police Officer under the authority of Section 262 of the Criminal Code. 

 I
of having been taken into custody for an offence of 

 and
in order that I maybe released from custody being required to enter
into my own recognisance to appear at the magistrate’s court/
police station ... hereby bind myself to appear at the magistrate’s
court/police station aforesaid at ... a m/p m on the ... day of ...
19... in order to be dealt with according to law, and in case of my
making fault herein, I bind myself to forefeit the sum of ...’ 




 Between
6th August 1981 and 21st December 1981, the appellant signed four
recognisances in which the words “magistrate’s court” were
deleted and the word “Hamilton” was written after “police
station”. The words “possession of controlled drug w/i to
supply” were written on the recognisance after the words “for an
offence of”. 

 The
word “charged” has been considered by the courts on a number of
occasions. R
v Norfolk Quarter Sessions, ex parte Brunson [1953] 1 All ER 346 was a case in which section 22 of the Criminal
Justice Administration Act 1914 and section 45 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1925 

 140 

 were
considered. Pearson J said at page 349: 




‘ In
a sense a prisoner may be charged at the moment when a policeman
arrests him without warrant on suspicion of felony and there is some
obligation to inform the arrested person for what he is being
arrested. There may be further action taken by the police at the
police station, but it does not follow that what happens at those
earlier stages makes the person arrested charged in the relevant and
material sense, which I should have thought means that an information
has been laid against him so that the proceedings against him have at
that stage been started. I am not satisfied that he can be said to
be charged [within section 17 of the Indictable Offences Act 1848]
... until an information has been laid.’ 




 In
our view the appellant was not charged with a criminal offence on 6th
August 1981. He was charged with a criminal offence for the first
time on 28th April 1982. We do not know, but it may be that he would
have been charged sooner had he not been abroad from 14th January to
14th April. He was in fact charged two weeks after his return. 

 But
even if we are wrong in concluding that the appellant was not
“charged” on 6th August 1981, we do not agree that there has been
undue delay in bringing that one offence to trial. The object of the
prosecution is, clearly, that the appellant should be brought to
trial in respect of offences arising out of his activities extending
over the whole period, 1st February 1981 to 14th April 1982. How he
came to be arrested on 6th August 1981 is not clear. It may be a
case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. But,
whatever the reason, we see nothing in Mrs de Soysa’s submission
that it was improper for the police to arrest the appellant and then
release him in order to observe his activities in order to lay
further charges. 

 Of
course, we are speaking very much in the dark at present as we have
not seen the evidence; but it would appear that the case which is
coming up for trial (of which the seventh charge in the information
will form a part) involved a great deal of preparation. Even if it
could be said that the appellant was “charged” on 6th August
1981, we agree with the Chief Justice that there has not been any
undue delay on the part of the police in bringing the appellant to
trial. Moreover, even if we had thought fit to make the declaration
and order sought in respect of the charge said to have been made on
6th August 1981, but which was not reduced to writing until 28th
April 1982, we would not have been disposed to make a similar order
with respect to the seventh charge in the summons dated 28th June
1982. No matter how one looks at it, it could not have been other
than a Pyrrhic victory for the appellant. 

 Sir
James Smith JA. On 17th November 1982 the appeal of Alvin Eugene Chapman was
dismissed, with reasons for judgment to be delivered later. 

 I
have had the opportunity of considering the reasons for judgment 

 141 

 prepared
by Sir Alastair Blair-Kerr P with which I entirely agree. 

 I
would merely add that the appellant failed to prove any infringement
of his rights under the Constitution of Bermuda. 

 da
Costa JA. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for
judgment prepared by Sir Alastair Blair-Kerr P. I entirely agree
with his reasons. Section 6(1) of the Constitution of Bermuda is in
fact a “due process” clause, to provide procedural safeguards to
protect the liberty of the subject. As Frankfurter J observed, “the
history of liberty has largely been the history of the observance of
procedural safeguards” ( McNabb
v United States ,
318 US 332 at 347). In England, as in the United States, the history
of the writ of habeas corpus demonstrates the importance of
procedural safeguards in preserving the liberty of the subject. But
the subject must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that
his right is being contravened. In my judgment, on the facts of this
case, the appellant has entirely failed to prove any infringement of
his constitutional right and, accordingly, his appeal was dismissed. 

 Appeal
dismissed with costs.

 Hotel
Employers Of Bermuda v Bermuda Industrial Union And Others 

 SUPREME
COURT OF BERMUDA 

 SIR
JAMES ASTWOOD CJ 

 17TH
MARCH 1983 

 Labour
relations – Unlawful industrial action – Injunction –
Entitlement to relief – Sufficient interest in relief sought –
Employers’ association – abour Relations Act 1975, No 15
[Bermuda], section 40(1), (2)( a ) 

 The
definition of a “person having sufficient interest in the relief
sought” in section 40(2)( a )
of the Labour Relations Act 1975 is sufficiently wide to allow a
registered unincorporated trade union of employers in the relevant
industry to institute proceedings under section 40(1) to restrain
unlawful industrial action. 

 No
cases were referred to in the judgment. 

 Action 

 Action The plaintiff, the Hotel Employers of Bermuda (a registered
unincorporated trade union), instituted proceedings (civil case 252
of 1981) under section 40(1) of the Labour Relations Act 1975 to
restrain the Bermuda Industrial Union (the first defendant) and six
persons who at the material time held office in the union, Ottiwell
Simmons, Eldridge Brimmer, Helena “Molly” Burgess, Kenneth
Pilgrim, Carolyn Franklin and Dr Barbara Ball (the second, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants) from taking industrial
action. 

 Section
40(1) and (2)( a )
read as follows: “(1) ... any person having a sufficient interest
in the relief sought shall be entitled, upon making application to
the Supreme Court and upon satisfying the court that there are
reasonable grounds for apprehending a contravention of this Act by
any person or by any trade union, to an injunction restraining that
person or union from so contravening this Act. (2) For the purposes
of this section - ( a )
‘ person having a sufficient interest in the relief sought’
includes - (i) any person whose person, property or business or any
right or interest of whom has been or is being or is likely to be
injured or damaged by any act which is, or the continuation or
repetition of which, is threatened or reasonably apprehended; and
(ii) any person whose house or place of residence, working or
business has been unlawfully watched, beset or picketed;”. 

 R
J Harvey QC (of the English Bar) and A Gunning for the plaintiff 

 143 

 J
Hall and M Scott for the defendants 

 Sir
James Astwood CJ. 1. In this action it is admitted that the plaintiff, a registered
unincorproated trade union of hotel employers who operate hotels in
Bermuda, is entitled to bring this action in these courts and may
have actions likewise brought against it. However, the defendants
question in the instant case whether the plaintiff has shown that it
is a person with a sufficient interest in the relief sought in this
action to be able to maintain this suit. The first defendant, on the
other hand, is a registered trade union representing workmen in many
trades and industries in Bermuda, with one of its divisions
representing workmen employed in the hotels doing business in
Bermuda. The other defendants held certain offices in the first
defendant at the material time. 

 2.
 The plaintiff, at paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of its statement of claim,
sets out what is in essence the crux of its case: 




‘ 9.
 On or before 28th April 1981, the defendants and each of them,
wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff, conspired and
agreed together and/or with persons unknown to the plaintiff, to
induce and/or solicit and/or intimidate and/or procure the hotel
workers employed by the plaintiff’s members to: (i) break their
contracts of employment with the plaintiff’s members by refusing to
work on or after, or about the 28th April 1981; (ii) organise picket
lines and adopt other means to persuade other hotel employees not to
work in breach of their contracts of employment or to prevent them
from so doing; and (iii) to persuade and/or to prevent other persons
from performing their commercial contracts to deliver goods to and/or
perform services for the plaintiff’s said members. 

 The
plaintiff is unable to give full particulars until discovery herein. 

 10.
 On or about 28th/29th April 1981, the defendants and each of them
induced and/or solicited and/or intimidated and/or procured the hotel
workers employed by the plaintiff’s members to break their
contracts of employment. 

 11.
 By reason of the aforesaid matters referred to in paragraphs 9 and
10 herein, on or about 28th April 1981, a large number of hotel
workers, in breach of their respective contracts of employment with
the plaintiff’s members, failed to attend for work, thereby
repudiating the same. Further, many hotel workers, represented by
the [first defendant], organised and/or participated in picketing at
the hotels to persuade other employees at the hotels not to work.’ 




 3.
 Paragraph 18 of the statement of claim is framed in the following
terms: 




‘ The
defendants and each of them, threaten and intend, unless restrained
by this court, to interfere with the plaintiff’s members in the
conduct of their trade by means of similar threats to persons and
firms dealing with the plaintiff’s members thereby contravening 

 144 

 section
34 of the Labour Relations Act 1975. 

 And
the plaintiff claims - 

 (1)
Against all the defendants, and each of them - an injunction to
restrain the defendants and each of them, whether by themselves or
their servants or agents or otherwise howsoever from further
conspiring and/or procuring any breach of contract and/or wrongfully
interfering with any of the plaintiff’s contractual relationships
as aforesaid, and from ordering, soliciting, procuring, intimidating,
and/or inciting the workmen employed by the plaintiff to break their
contracts of employment by striking or taking irregular industrial
action, short of a strike, in contravention of the Labour Relations
Act 1975. 

 (2)
Costs. 

 (3)
Further or other relief.’ 




 4.
 Depending on the findings which the court concludes to be the facts
in this case, the plaintiff invites the court to make a declaration
that a certain type of conduct, if proved as a fact to be
established, amounts to unlawful conduct by the defendants under the
Labour Relations Act 1975. 

 5.
 The defendants have put the plaintiff to proof of its allegations
and have asserted very forcefully at the trial of this matter that
such withdrawals of labour by workmen at any of the plaintiff’s
member properties which may have occurred took place by the
individual workmen exercising their democratic right to withdraw
their labour at any time and that, moreover, they must have been
provoked to spontaneous action by unfavourable media reporting and/or
misrepresentation of the various events which were happening in
Bermuda in April and early May 1981. 

 6.
 On 11th April 1981, a lawful strike was called in the Bermuda
hospitals and in certain departments of the Government of Bermuda. 
This strike involved certain categories of workmen employed in the
hospitals and in government departments. These categories of workmen
were represented in their negotiations for new contracts of
employment affecting their wages and other conditions of employment
by the first defendant. It seems that these workmen, by April, had
worked for several months without contracts, the old contracts having
expired some months earlier; and it seems to me also that the
negotiations were allowed to become bogged down with the parties
coming to a stalemate. Apparently, on 28th April 1981, the
Government made an offer concerning their workmen (through the first
defendant) on what was interpreted as a “take-it-or-leave-it”
basis. On the evening of 28th April 1981, certain events were
deponed as having taken place at certain hotels, and by the next
morning withdrawals of labour took place at those hotels and at
others, with the result that a number of hotels began to wind down
their businesses and eventually closed down their operations. Out of
this situation the present case was spawned. 

 145 

 7.
 Some forty-nine witnesses in all gave evidence and a number of
exhibits were presented and I will now proceed to review the
evidence. 

 [Sir
James Astwood CJ reviewed the evidence (paragraph 8 of his judgment)
and then continued:] 

 9.
 Having considered all the relevant evidence in this case and the
submissions made to me, I have come to the following decision on a
balance of probability on the facts and inferences from such facts as
I found proved. (a) On 28th April 1981, unionised workers at the
Grotto Bay Hotel and at the Holiday Inn Hotel withdrew their labour
and repudiated their contracts of employment. (b) On 29th April,
unionised workers at the Elbow Beach Hotel, the Inverurie Hotel, the
Southampton Princess Hotel, the Mermaid Beach and Racquet Club, the
Belmont Hotel, the Palmetto Bay Hotel, the Ariel Sands, the Sonesta
Beach Hotel, the Pompano Beach Club, the Hamilton Princess Hotel and
the Castle Harbour Hotel withdrew their labour and repudiated their
contracts of employment. (c) The withdrawals of labour by the
workmen from the hotels was a concerted stoppage of work carried out
by the workmen in furtherance of the labour dispute between the
hospitals board and the first defendant and the Bermuda Government
and the first defendant, there being no labour dispute in the hotels
with their workmen. (d) The withdrawal of labour was organised by
the shop stewards in the hotels, who were appointed under the terms
of the collective bargaining agreement in force at the time
(agreement dated 11th April 1979). (e) The first, second, third,
fourth, fifth and sixth defendants knew of the withdrawals of labour
and were parties to the withdrawals of labour by the workmen in the
hotels. (f) The seventh defendant was not on the evidence personally
involved in the withdrawal of labour from the hotels. (g) The
withdrawals of labour from the hotels severely damaged the hotel
industry of Bermuda and caused the plaintiff’s members loss, damage
and inconvenience. (h) The withdrawals of labour from the hotels by
the workmen severely reduced the services which could be provided to
the guests in the hotels. (i) The first, second, third, fourth,
fifth and sixth defendants on or before 28th April 1981 wrongfully
and with intent to injure the plaintiff’s members conspired and
agreed together, and with persons unknown, to induce, solicit and
procure the hotel workers to break their contracts of employment with
the plaintiff’s members by refusing to work on or after 28th April
1981. (j) The first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth
defendants, and each of them, on or about 28th/29th April 1981
induced, solicited and procured the hotel workers employed by the
plaintiff’s members to break their contracts of employment. (k)
The plaintiff’s members, on or about 1st May 1981 accepted the
repudiation of the hotel workers’ contracts, that is, the contracts
of those workers who with-drew their labour and repudiated their
contracts. (1) The objects of the first, second, third, fourth,
fifth and sixth defendants in inducing, soliciting and procuring the
withdrawal of the hotel workers were: (i) designed to coerce the
Government directly by causing or threatening 

 146 

 to
cause damage to the economy; or (ii) to cause damage to the hotel
industry and the economy, thereby inflicting severe hardship on the
community, and thereby indirectly coercing the Government. (m) The
objects of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth
defendants in or organising the withdrawal of the hotel workers from
the hotels including the plaintiffs members’ hotels, was not the
furtherance of a labour dispute within the Bermuda hotel industry,
which is the trade or industry in which the strikes were engaged
within the meaning of “labour dispute” in sections 1 and 34(2) of
the Labour Relations Act 1975. (n) the plaintiff property owners
were without hotel staff on 28th, 29th and 30th April 1981, caused by
the withdrawals of labour by the workmen starting on the 28th April
1981. (o) The plaintiff’s members were compelled to close their
hotels in the light of the withdrawals of labour, but could have
pursued their remedy for an ex parte injunction under section 40 of the Labour Relations Act 1975 before
closing, which may have had the effect of convincing the workmen who
had walked out to return to work immediately, which may have removed
the necessity to close down the hotels and would have lessened the
damage to the hotels and to the community at large. 

 10.
 Having made the findings at paragraph 9, 1 have now to decide
whether the withdrawals of labour were unlawful under the Labour
Relations Act 1975 (“the Act”) Section 34 of the Act enacts: 




‘ (1)
It is hereby declared that any lock-out, strike or irregular
industrial action short of a strike shall be unlawful if - 

 ( a )
it has any object other than or in addition to the furtherance of a
labour dispute within the trade or industry in which the strikers,
persons taking irregular industrial action short of a strike or
employers locking-out, as the case may be, are engaged; or 

 ( b )
it is designed or calculated to coerce the Government either directly
or by inflicting severe hardship upon the community, and it is
further declared that it is unlawful to commence, or continue, or to
apply any sums in furtherance or support of, any such illegal
lock-out, strike or irregular industrial action short of a strike: 

 Provided
that - 

 ( a )
A lock-out, strike or irregular industrial action short of a strike,
the purpose of which is merely to alter or maintain the terms and
conditions of employment of strikers or workmen locked out, as the
case may be, shall not be deemed to be designed or calculated to
coerce the Government, and 

 ( b )
a lock-out, strike or irregular industrial action short of a strike
shall not be deemed to be calculated to coerce the Government unless
such coercion ought reasonably to be expected as a consequence
thereof. 

 (2)
For the purposes of subsection (1), a labour dispute shall not be
deemed to be within a trade or industry unless it is a dispute
between employers and workmen, or between workmen and workmen, in 

 147 

 that
trade or industry, which is connected with the employment or
non-employment or the terms of employment, or with the conditions of
work, of persons in that trade or industry. 

 (3)
Any person who takes part in, incites or in any way encourages,
persuades or influences any person to take part in, or otherwise acts
in furtherance of, a lock-out, strike or irregular industrial action
short of a strike declared by this section to be unlawful shall be
guilty of an offence and shall be liable - 

 ( a )
on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding two thousand
dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to
both such fine and imprisonment; 

 ( b )
on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months: 

 Provided
that no person shall commit an offence under this section by reason
only of his having ceased work or refused to continue to work or to
accept employment.’ 




 11.
 On the evidence which I accept, the withdrawal of labour from the
hotels was not within the trade or industry in which the hospital
workers and the Government workers were employed. Hotels are in the
trade or industry which provides sleeping accommodation, and may or
may not provide food, drink and recreation facilities; but the
hospitals provide medical care for the sick and elderly. The
Government blue-collar workers who were on an official strike
provide, according to the evidence, many services such as
transportation; but I have no evidence that they provide the services
that a hotel is expected to provide. Moreover, I have come to the
conclusion on the evidence that the withdrawals of labour had no
other purpose than to coerce the Government directly to settle the
dispute with their workmen, which was accomplished some days after
the walk-out of the hotel workers; and the defendants I have named
and the workers who withdrew their labour, on the evidence,
reasonably expected that the Government would be coerced to settle
the dispute. 

 12.
 Those workmen who withdrew their labour in furtherance of the strike
in the hotels, and the defendants I have named, were all in my
opinion in breach of section 34(3) of the Act as their conduct was
clearly unlawful. 

 13.
 On the question of whether the plaintiff has a sufficient interest
in the relief sought to be able to maintain this action, I decide it
this way. The provisions at section 40 of the Act are very wide and
the definition of “person having a sufficient interest in the
relief sought” is so wide that it would almost embrace any person
connected in any way with the hotel industry. Therefore, on the
evidence, the plaintiff clearly fits into the definition. I,
therefore, find that the plaintiff has sufficient interest to
maintain this action. 

 14.
 The declaration which I make is this: (a) the first second, third,
fourth, fifth and sixth defendants on or before 28th April 1981 

 148 

 wrongfully
and with intent to injure the plaintiff conspired and agreed
together, and with persons unknown, to induce, solicit and procure
the hotel workers to break their contracts of employment with the
plaintiff’s members by refusing to work on or after 28th April
1981; (b) the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth
defendants, and each of them, on or about 28th/29th April 1981
induced, solicited and procured the hotel workers employed by the
plaintiff’s members to break their contracts of employment; and the
conduct of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth
defendants was unlawful under section 34(3) of the Act; and the
conduct of any of the workmen who withdrew their labour and
repudiated their contracts, having been induced or encouraged to do
so, was also unlawful under section 34(3) of the Act. 

 15.
 The evidence which I accept in this case indicates that there are
not now any reasonable grounds for apprehending a contravention of
the Act. In fact, the evidence indicates that there is a kind of
harmony in the hotel industry. The court does nothing in vain. If
an ex parte injunction had been applied for in 1981, on the facts presented in
this case, it would be my Opinion that it would have been granted;
and if an application had been made shortly thereafter to have it
removed, such an application in my view would have been rightly
refused. However, if an application were made at this present time
to remove it, in the light of the present state of the evidence, it
would very probably be removed. Therefore, it does not make good
legal sense now to grant an injunction, since there are no reasonable
grounds for apprehending a contravention of the Act. I therefore
refuse the application for the injunction. 

 16.
 No case is made out against the seventh defendant and the case
against the seventh defendant is dismissed. 

 Order
accordingly.

 John
And Others v Director Of Public Prosecutions For Dominica 

 COURT
OF APPEAL OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES, CRIMINAL DIVISION 

 SIR
NEVILLE PETERKIN CJ, BERRIDGE AND ROBOTHAM JJA 

 27TH
28TH SEPTEMBER 7TH DECEMBER 1982 

 Criminal
evidence – Handwriting – Comparison with genuine handwriting –
Comparative document genuine to satisfaction of judge – Standard of
proof – Evidence Act, Cap 64 [Dominica], section 19 

 Criminal

[Dominica], section 37(2) – West Indies Associated States Supreme
Court (Dominica) (Amendment) Act 1981, No 16 [Dominica] 

 Criminal
law – Appeal – Point of law – Submission of no case to answer 

 Four
accused were charged, in the alternative, with conspiring with others
to overthrow the Government of Dominica by force and conspiring with
others to assault police officers in the execution of their duties. 
The State sought to admit in evidence a passport application form
completed by one accused and a diary written up by another to prove
their handwriting in documents before the court. The trial judge
ruled that he was not satisfied (in accordance with section 19 of the
Evidence Act) that the passport application form and the diary had
been written by the accused; both were excluded and their exclusion
materially weakened the State’s case against the accused. At the
close of the State’s case the accused submitted that there was no
case for them to answer. The trial judge, ruling that the evidence
admitted was unreliable and such that the jury could not properly
convict on it, acquitted the four accused. The Director of Public
Prosecutions appealed by special case to the Court of Appeal (in
accordance with the West Indies Associated States Supreme Court
(Dominica) Act 1969, sections 36, 37) against the exclusion of the
passport application form and the diary and the acquittal of the
accused following their submission of no case to answer. On the
appeal, the accused raised two preliminary objections, namely (a)
that the appeal against the acquittals did not raise a point of
substantive law or adjectival law relating to the evidence and was
therefore incompetent, and (b) that the amendment to section 37(2) of
the 1969 Act by the West Indies Associated States Supreme Court
(Dominica) (Amendment) Act 1981 was unconstitutional in that it
removed from the Court of Appeal 

 150 

 its
discretion as to ordering or otherwise a retrial following a
successful appeal. 

 Held - allowing the appeal and ordering a retrial in respect of three of
the accused - 

 (1)
Before any writing of all accused could be admitted for comparison
with a disputed writing under section 19 of the Evidence Act the
judge had to be satisfied that it was genuine; in satisfying himself
on this score, the judge should apply the civil standard of proof and
the document need not be relevant to the proceedings before him;
accordingly, the passport application form and the diary should have
been admitted. 

 Birch
v Ridgeway (1858) 1 F&amp;F 270 and R v Angeli [1978] 3 All ER 897 applied. 

 (2)
The wrongful exclusion of the evidence of handwriting raised a
question of law which entitled the Director of Public Prosecutions to
appeal against it. 

 Bracegirdle
v Oxley [1947] 1 All ER 1 26 applied. 

 (3)
Section 37(2), as amended in 1981, did not (on its true construction)
remove from the Court of Appeal its discretion to order a retrial and
hence was not unconstitutional. 

 Liyanage
v R [1966] 1 All ER 650 distinguished. 

 (4)
The trial judge was, in all the circumstances, wrong to accede to the
submission of no ease to answer (in respect of three of the accused)
and, as such a submission involved a question of law, an appeal
properly lay from his decision.

 Appeal 

 Appeal The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed by special case to the
Court of Appeal from a ruling of Mitchell J excluding evidence in the
trial of Patrick John, Malcolm Reid, Dennis Joseph and Julian David
for conspiracy to overthrow the Government by force and conspiracy to
assault police officers in the execution of their duties. The
Director of Public Prosecutions also appealed against the acquittal
of the four accused following a submission of no case to answer. The
facts are set out in the judgment of the court. 

 E
Mottley QC and L Barnett (instructed by S Bertrand) for the State 

 B
Macaulay QC and R Williams (instructed by M Macaulay) for the accused 

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Robotham
JA delivered the judgment of the court. This is an appeal by the
Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of Dominica in the
exercise of a right conferred by sections 36 and 37 of the West
Indies Associated States Supreme Court (Dominica) Act 1969, as
amended by the West Indies Associated States Supreme Court (Dominica)
(Amendment) Act 1981. 

 The
four accused were on 12th May 1981 jointly arraigned before Mitchell
J and a jury on two counts of an indictment. The first count charged
that they on divers days between 19th September 1980 and 29th April
1981, in the Commonwealth of Dominica and elsewhere, conspired
together with Michael Perdue and Wolfgang Droege and with other
persons unknown to overthrow the lawfully constituted Government of
Dominica by force of arms. The second count which was framed as an
alternative to count one charged them with conspiring together with
Michael Perdue and Wolfgang Droege and other persons unknown, to
assault police officers in the execution of their duties of guarding
the police headquarters at Roseau, Dominica. 

 The
trial continued until 19th May 1981 when, the State having closed its
case, a submission of no case was made in respect of each of the four
accused. On 20th May Mitchell J upheld the submissions and directed
the jury to return a formal verdict of “Not Guilty” in respect of
each of the accused. They were all duly discharged on both counts,
and on that same day, the Director of Public Prosecutions lodged this
appeal. The right of appeal is given by section 37(2), as amended,
in these terms: 




‘ Where
during the trial of a person on indictment the trial judge decides on
a point of law or evidence, the Director of Public Prosecutions, if
dissatisfied with the trial judge’s decision may appeal by way of
special case to the Court of Appeal for a determination of the point
in issue: Provided that where a jury has deliberated and 

 152 

 returns
a verdict of Not Guilty there shall be no appeal against such a
verdict.’ 




 The
conduct of the case for the State would have necessitated the calling
of two expert witnesses on handwriting, to prove that a document
found in the possession of Michael Perdue when apprehended in the
United States of America, was signed by the accused Patrick John, and
that other documents were in the handwriting of the accused Malcolm
Reid. Towards this end, it was sought to put in evidence passport
application forms alleged to have been written up and signed by
Patrick John, so as to form the basis of the comparison with the
disputed writing found in the possession of Michael Perdue. The
trial judge, however, refused to admit these documents in evidence on
the ground that they had not been proved to his satisfaction (in
accordance with section 19 of the Evidence Act) to be in the genuine
writing of Patrick John. In respect of Malcolm Reid, the State
sought to put in a diary alleged to have been written by him, but
this attempt met with a similar fate. It might here be mentioned
that section 19 of the Evidence Act is in identical terms to section
8 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865 [UK]. 

 The
effect of these rulings precluded the State from putting the evidence
of the handwriting experts before the jury and, as counsel for the
State puts it, whilst it did not demolish its case in the light of
the evidence remaining, it substantially strengthened the submission
of no case. The questions therefore which the Director of Public
Prosecutions asks this court to answer are: (1) did the trial judge
err and misdirect himself in law in refusing to admit the comparative
documents in respect of (a) John, and (b) Reid; and (2) did he err
and misdirect himself in law in upholding the submission of no case
on the ground that the evidence for the prosecution was manifestly
unreliable and it was unsafe that the case should be left to the
jury? 

 These
questions are inter-related and will, of necessity, involve an
examination of the evidence adduced on behalf of the State. The two
preliminary objections raised on behalf of the accused will also have
to be dealt with in due course. For completeness we state them at
this stage. They are: (1) that the purported special case does not
raise a question of interpretation or construction of a point of
substantive law, nor any point of adjectival law relating to the
evidence; and (2) the amendment giving the Director of Public
Prosecutions the right of appeal is unconstitutional null and void. 

 Robotham
JA then summarised the factual basis of the State’s case against
the accused. In relation to the State’s first witness, Maffie, the
judge commented that Maffie would have had to be treated not only as
an accomplice but as a person who had an interest to serve. The
judge concluded this part of his judgment: Such then was the factual
evidence which the State tendered in support of the two counts of the
indictment. It was proposed to bolster this body of evidence with
the evidence of 

 153 

 two
handwriting experts; but, as previously indicated, the State was not
in a position to do this, once they were not permitted to put the
comparative documents in evidence. It is therefore on the basis of
the evidence which has been summarised above that the submission of
no case was made and upheld. The correctness or otherwise of that
decision is one of the answers sought by the Director of Public
Prosecutions. 

 The
disputed writings and admissibility of the comparative documents 

 The
disputed writing in respect of the accused Patrick John was a
typewritten agreement dated 20th September 1980 addressed to Michael
Perdue and signed “Patrick John”. This was one of the documents
found in the briefcase of Perdue by the US agent, Osburg, upon his
apprehension. 

 The
disputed documents in respect of Malcolm Reid were (1) the small
sheet of notepaper with writings which was also found in the
briefcase of Michael Perdue at the same time as the typewritten
agreement was found; and (2) an undated note addressed to “Fred”,
which was handed over to PC Pacquette at the Dominica police
headquarters on 5th March 1981 by Ronnie Roberts, a prisoner then in
custody at the lock-up where Malcolm Reid was also confined, and
purporting to have been written by Reid. Roberts was not called as a
witness to say from what source the document came. 

 Oliver
Phillip, the Commissioner of Police for Dominica, was called to give
evidence relating to the passport application form of the accused,
Patrick John, which was sought to be put in evidence for comparison
with the signature “Patrick John” on the typewritten agreement. 

 The
judge ruled the document to be inadmissible, and the circumstances
surrounding the ruling can best be recaptured by quoting from
extracts of the judge’s notes. Oliver Phillip said, in answer to
counsel for the State: 




‘ ...
In addition to my office as Commissioner of Police, I hold the office
of Chief Immigration Officer. Applications for passports are made to
my office ... after the passport is issued the form is filed in the
immigration office under my control ...’ 




 He
was then shown a passport application form dated 19th June 1979 by
counsel for the State and counsel for the accused objected to its
admissibility, stating that the proper officer to put in the document
should be the person who processed the application; and, further,
that it was irrelevant. Counsel for the State in answer to the court
said that the Witness did not make the document nor did he see it
made. The judged ruled that the document was inadmissible as coming
from a witness who knew nothing about it and the circumstances of its
making; and that it had not been proved to his satisfaction to be the
writing of Patrick John. 

 Counsel
for the State then referred the court to paragraph 1262 of Archbold (39th Edn) which states that the methods of proving the 

 154 

 handwriting
of a person may be: (1) by a person having knowledge of it; (2) by
some person who has a knowledge of it from having seen him write even
once only; (3) by someone having been in the habit of corresponding
with him, or of acting Upon his correspondence with others. He
referred the court to section 19 of the Evidence Act and launched a
second attempt to have the document admitted. On further
examination, Oliver Phillip said: 




‘ ...
I am familiar with the handwriting of Patrick John. Mr John has been
a member of Government. He has been Premier and Prime Minister of
the Government. During the period he was Premier and Prime Minister
he was also Minister responsible for National Security. As Minister
of National Security I was responsible to him for national security. 
I therefore had during that period occasion to see Mr John’s
handwriting, to witness him write and sign his name. That is how I
became familiar with his signature. From time to time I received
minute papers from his office.’ 




 Counsel
again sought to tender the document, but the judge remained unmoved. 
The application to admit the document was refused. The reason given
being the same, that “it is not proved to have been signed or
written by the [accused]”. 

 Undaunted,
counsel sought to put in some other documents allegedly received by
Oliver Phillip from Assistant Superintendent of Police Blanchard. It
is not clear what those documents were, but apparently they were
directed also at proving the handwriting of Patrick John. His
efforts proved equally fruitless, and the benefit of the evidence of
the handwriting expert (in so far as Patrick John went) was lost to
the State. Nothing more need be said at this stage, other than that
it appears to us that the witness Oliver Phillip from his evidence
satisfied all the tests of competence to speak of his knowledge of
the handwriting of Patrick John. To what extent it had to be “proved
to the satisfaction of the judge to be genuine” in the terms of
section 19 of the Evidence Act remains to be considered. 

 The
efforts of counsel for the State to put in evidence a comparative
document in the form of a diary purporting to have been written by
the accused Malcolm Reid, proved equally unsuccessful. In this
respect Gene Pestinna testified: 




‘ I
am an inspector of police (No 161 of the Commonwealth of Dominica
Police Force) ... presently in charge of the Eastern District. On
15th January 1981 I was attached to the special branch. I know the
accuse Captain Walter [ sic ]
Reid. He was a member of the Defence Force. Whilst a member of the
police force I have visited Reid at Defence Force headquarters on
many occasions. On many of those visits I have seen his writing. I
know his handwriting very well. I have seen him write. Captain Reid
and I are very good friends. I look at this diary... I did not see
Captain Reid write this diary particularly ...’ 




 155 

 Objection
was taken by counsel for the accused at this stage to the production
of the diary on the grounds that: (1) the prosecution had not shown
the relevance of the diary; (2) it had not been produced from proper
custody; and (3) the witness said that he had not seen the accused
write the particular document. 

 The
legal argument which ensued, resulted in the ruling of the court in
these terms: 




‘ The
court rules that it is not proved to the satisfaction of the court
that the writing in question, the diary, is proved to the
satisfaction of the court to be that of Malcolm Reid in accordance
with section 19 of the Evidence Act.’ 




 Here
again it would seem to us that this witness was hardly any less
competent to speak of his knowledge of the handwriting of Malcolm
Reid than was Oliver Phillip to speak of that of Patrick John. 

 Section
19 of the Evidence Act states: 




‘ Comparison
of the disputed writing with any writing proved to the satisfaction
of the judge to be genuine shall be permitted to be made by witnesses
and such writings and evidence of the witnesses respecting the same
may be submitted to the court and jury as evidence of the genuineness
or otherwise of the writing in dispute.’ 




 It
is identical in terms to section 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act
1865. 

 Both
Phillip and Pestinna testified that they had respectively seen
Patrick John and Malcolm Reid write. Phillip as the Commissioner of
Police would have worked in close conjunction with Patrick John as
the Prime Minister and Minister of National Security, and the same
relationship would have existed between Pestinna as head of the
special branch and Reid, the second-in-command of the Defence Force. 

 The
methods of proof of the handwriting are not only set out in paragraph
1262 of Archbold (39th Edn) but similar provisions are to be found in all the standard
works on evidence. A statement that a witness is acquainted with the
party’s handwriting has more often than not been held to be
sufficient in chief, it being for the opponent to cross-examine as to
the means and extent of the knowledge ( Doe
d Mudd v Suckermore (1837) 5 Ad&amp;El 703 at page 730, 731). There was no
cross-examination of either Phillip or Pestinna on this aspect. 

 It
must be remembered that in the final result, it is the jury who are
invited to make a comparison of the handwriting on the two documents,
and the opinion of the expert is merely to assist them. On a proper
direction, the trial judge would still have to direct them that they
should be satisfied that the comparative document put forward was in
the handwriting of the accused, before using it as a basis of
comparison with the questioned document. The standard which the jury
has to apply is the standard applicable to all criminal matters of
which they are seized, 

 156 

 that
is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Can it be said, however, that
the judge when called upon to admit the document in accordance with
Section 19 of the Evidence Act has got to apply the same standard of
proof? 

 In R v Angeli [1978] 3 All ER 950 it was held that the standard of proof to be
applied by a trial judge in deciding whether (pursuant to section 8
of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865 [UK]) writing is proved to his (ie
the judge’s) satisfaction to be genuine, is the civil standard of
proof, that is the judge need only be satisfied that the writing is
genuine; the matter being covered by the statute, the criminal
standard of proof is inapplicable. 

 Counsel
for the accused had submitted before this court that the criminal
standard was applicable. It was pointed out by counsel for the State
that the provision is contained in the Evidence Act (which is
applicable to both civil and criminal proceedings) so that the
criminal standard of proof could hardly be acceptable. There is much
merit in this submission and this court sees no difficulty in
agreeing with and accepting the standard of prooflaid down in R v Angeli . 

 On
the question of relevance it is well established that the documents
being sought to be tendered for comparative purposes need not be
relevant to the case ( Birch
v Ridgeway (1858) 1 F&amp;F 270). The court is firmly of the view that on the
basis of the evidence given by Oliver Phillip and Gene Pestinna and
the authorities, the trial judge ought to have admitted in evidence
the passport application form purported to have been completed and
signed by Patrick John, and the diary purported to have been written
up by Malcolm Reid. In this respect therefore, there was a wrongful
exclusion of evidence. 

 Despite
this however, the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot maintain an
appeal under the Act as amended if either of the two preliminary
objections taken is successful, namely (1) that the appeal does not
raise a question of the interpretation or construction of a point of
substantive law or adjectival law relating to the evidence, or (2)
that the purported amendment is unconstitutional, null and void. 
Before dealing with the submission of no case the preliminary
objections should now therefore be dealt with. 

 The
preliminary objections 

 There
are many statutes which give a right of appeal by way of case stated
on the ground that the determination is erroneous in law. It not
infrequently happens that magistrates come to a decision which no
reasonable Bench could have come to. In such a case the High Court
on an appeal can interfere on a point of law ( Bracegirdle
v Oxley [1947] KB 349). 

 If
wrong legal principles are applied in making a decision, or in
accepting or rejecting evidence, both raise questions of law. There
can hardly be any room for dispute when it is said that the wrongful
admission and/or the wrongful exclusion of evidence raise questions
of 

 157 

 law
which in a Court of Appeal can lead to the quashing of a conviction. 
I have already indicated the court’s view that the trial judge
wrongfully excluded the passport form and the diary. This wrongful
exclusion of evidence in our view raises a point of law and is
sufficient to ground the right of appeal of the Director of Public
Prosecutions, unless it can otherwise be shown that the amendment is
unconstitutional, null and void. The first preliminary objection
therefore fails. 

 Turning
now to the second preliminary objection, section 8(5) of the
Commonwealth of Dominica Constitution Order 1978 reads: 




‘ A
person who shows that he has been tried by a competent court for a
criminal offence and either convicted or acquitted shall not again be
tried for that offence or for any other criminal offence of which he
could have been convicted at the trial save upon the order of a
superior court in the course of appeal or review proceedings relating
to the conviction or acquittal.’ 




 This
provision in the Constitution has not in any way enlarged, or
abridged the Common law right of an accused to avail himself of the
pleas of autrefois acquit or convict. The right of an accused person
to avail himself of this plea, can be taken away by a Court of Appeal
who can order his retrial. Counsel for the accused submitted that
this power to order a retrial, or the exercise of the power, is
vested in the Court of Appeal, and not in Parliament. Counsel then
invited the court to read section 37(3) of the Amendment Act 1981
which states: 




‘ The
Court of Appeal in such appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions
shall allow the appeal if it thinks the decision was wrong in law and
order a retrial and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.’ 




 He
submitted that by the use of the words “shall allow the appeal ...
and order a retrial”, Parliament assumed the power and directed the
Court of Appeal, thereby taking away from it the exercise of any
discretion in the matter. If, therefore, it was the intention to
divest the Court of Appeal of its discretionary power to deprive the
accused of his protection of the plea of autrefois acquit, section
8(5) of the Constitution should first have been amended in accordance
with the special provisions laid down in its section 42(2). This was
not done; therefore the next question which, he submitted, had to be
decided was whether or not section 37(3) was severable from section
37(2) which gives the right of appeal. A look at both subsections,
he submitted, shows that they are inextricably bound up with each
other and form a scheme which was intended by the legislature. Any
attempt at severance would destroy this scheme and, therefore, the
amendment as a whole should be declared unconstitutional and a
usurpation of the judicial power of the Court of Appeal. He referred
to Liyanage v R [1967] 1 AC 259. 

 In
response, counsel for the State submitted that section 8(5) of the
Constitution does not contain any implied provision that an order for 

 158 

 retrial
by the Court of Appeal must have been made in the exercise of an
unfettered discretion. On the contrary, the establishment and
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as well as the powers of the
court are fixed by law, and not by the Constitution. Counsel
referred the court to section 9(2) of the West Indies States Supreme
Court Order 1967, which reads: 




‘ The
Court of Appeal shall have in relation to the State such jurisdiction
to hear and determine appeals and to exercise such powers as may be
conferred upon it by the Constitution or any other law of the State.’ 




 He
submitted that Liyanage v R was inapplicable to the present circumstances. That involved a
special court being set up to deal with special persons, under rather
special circumstances, and novel rules of evidence. 

 In
our view, these submissions of counsel for the State are a complete
answer to this second preliminary objection. The Amendment Act 1981
creates a new right of appeal and confers upon the Court of Appeal a
power to deal with it. Whilst recognising the necessity to
scrutinise legislation of this nature closely, we do not consider the
Act unconstitutional, and this point also fails. 

 There
now remains to be considered the ruling on the submission of no case,
and whether or not that raises a question of law. For reasons which
will become obvious shortly, we will refrain from commenting or
expressing an opinion on the evidence, other than is necessary for
the purpose of this decision. 

 The
submission of no case 

 In
February 1962, Lord Parker CJ issued the following Practice Note [1962] 1 All ER 448: 




‘ A
submission that there is no case to go to a jury may properly be made
and upheld: ( a )
when there has been no evidence to prove an essential element in the
alleged offence; and ( b )
where the evidence adduced by the prosecution has been so discredited
as a result of cross-examination or is so manifestly unreliable that
no reasonable tribunal could safely convict on it.’ 




 In
1975, Lord Widgery CJ in R v Barker (1975) 65 Cr App Rep 287 at page 288 said: 




‘ It
cannot be too clearly stated that a judge’s obligation to stop the
case is an obligation which is concerned primarily with those cases
where the necessary minimum evidence to establish the facts of the
crime has not been called. It is not the judge’s job to weigh the
evidence, decide who is telling the truth and stop the case merely
because he thinks the witness is lying. To do that is to usurp the
functions of the jury ...’ 




 159 

 Counsel
for the State submitted to this court that the nature of this case
and the evidence adduced in support of the charges, were not such as
to justify in law the decision of the judge to uphold the submission.
 The principal witness (he submitted) was Maffie. His true character
was not hidden, and indeed it was attacked; but whether or not he was
telling the truth was (counsel submitted) essentially a matter for
the jury. He did not resile from the fact that Maffie was an
accomplice and had an interest to serve; but in these circumstances
the judge’s duty to give an accurate and appropriate warning was
clear. 

 He
further submitted that the very nature of his character and his close
association with the plot made him a natural ally, and his story may
thus have appeared credible to the jury. Counsel pointed out that
there were many factors emerging from the evidence which tended to
give credence to Maffie’s account. He specifically mentioned the
evidence of Osburg as to the thwarting of the expedition, the
declarations made by Perdue and others to Osburg, the remittance of
funds from Perdue through the account of Julian David at the Royal
Bank of Canada, the frequent visits of Perdue to Dominica, and the
evidence of the meeting in Antigua. 

 Finally,
counsel submitted that the upholding of the submission of no case was
wrong in law and, as such, raised a point of law upon which the court
could pronounce. He relied on Ross v Rivenall [1959] 2 All ER 376 and Tibbets v Eldemire (1975) 13 Jamaica LR 241. 

 In
reply, counsel for the accused submitted that not every submission of
no case can be treated as a point of law. At the highest, the
decision here of Mitchell J raises only a question of mixed law and
fact, and does not ground the appeal of the Director of Public
Prosecutions. The court is not in agreement with this. We are of
the opinion that a submission of no case involves a point of law as
was clearly shown in Ross v Rivenall . 

 Counsel
for the accused referred us to R v Galbraith [1981] 2 A11 ER 1060 which set out guidelines to be followed by a
trial judge on a submission of no case to answer. This case applied
the principle laid down by Lord Widgery CJ in R v Barker (1975) 65 Cr App Rep 287. If it does nothing else, it appears that R v Galbraith [1981] 2 All ER 1060 strengthens and re-affirms the directions given
by Lord Parker CJ in 1962. Lord Lane CJ said: 




‘ ...
Where the judge comes to the conclusion that the Crown’s evidence,
taken at its highest, is such that a jury properly directed could not
properly convict on it, it is his duty, on a submission being made,
to stop the case. Where, however, the Crown’s evidence is such
that its strength or weakness depends on the view to be taken of a
witness’s reliability, or other matters which are generally
speaking within the province of the jury, and where on one possible
view of the facts there is evidence on which a jury could properly
come to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty, then the judge
should allow the matter to be tried by the jury ...’ 




 160 

 This
statement is very relevant to the circumstances of this case. The
reliability of the witness Maffie featured largely in the ease. On
the basis of the evidence adduced and the authorities, we are of the
view that the case should have been left to the jury, and that the
trial judge erred in that respect. 

 At
the close of his submissions and in answer to the court, counsel for
the State guardedly admitted that the decision of Mitchell J to
uphold the submission of no ease in respect of the accused Dennis
Joseph only, could be justifiable in law. We are entirely in
agreement with this. We find that there was no evidence to go to the
jury in respect of Joseph. In so far as the other accused (Patrick
John, Malcolm Reid, and Julian David) are concerned, we are of the
view that there was evidence against them on which a jury properly
directed could convict, and that Mitchell J was wrong in law in
upholding the submission in respect of these three. This too, in our
opinion, raises a point of law sufficient to ground the appeal of the
Director of Public Prosecutions. 

 It
follows therefore that the three questions submitted by the Director
of Public Prosecutions to this court for determination must each be
answered in the affirmative. The Court’s decision is as follows:
(1) the appeal of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of
the accused Dennis Joseph is dismissed, and the verdict of acquittal
entered in his favour on both counts of the indictment is sustained;
(2) the appeal of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of
the accused Patrick John, Malcolm Reid and Julian David is allowed,
and the verdicts of acquittal entered against each of them on both
counts of the indictments, are set aside; (3) that there should be a
retrial of the accused Patrick John, Malcolm Reid, and Julian David
in accordance with section 37(3) of the Act of 1981 Upon a fresh
indictment; and (4) that the accused Patrick John, Malcolm Reid, and
Julian David should be retaken into custody, and that they should
each be offered bail in the sum of $10,000, with one or two sureties. 

 Appeal
allowed in respect of three accused. New trial ordered. 

 Editorial
note. An appeal in this case was dismissed by the Privy Council on 27th
February 1985; see note at 129 SJ 332. The decision of the Privy
Council will be reported in a subsequent volume.

 COURT
OF APPEAL OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES, CIVIL DIVISION 

 SIR
NEVILLE PETERKIN CJ, BERRIDGE AND ROBOTHAM JJA 

 19TH
20TH OCTOBER 1982, 1ST FEBRUARY 1983 

 Insurance
– Claim against insurers – Election of defence – Material
alteration to risk – Non-disclosure not pleaded – Insurers unable
to raise issue of non – disclosure at trial 

 Damages
– Loss of profits – Claim against insurance company – No
insurance cover for loss of profits 

 Judgment
– Interest – Debt – Interest payable from date debt due 

 The
plaintiff’s bakery was insured under a policy of insurance issued
by the defendants. Equipment and furniture were destroyed by fire in
February 1978 and the plaintiff claimed under his policy for the
loss. Loss adjusters were appointed by the defendant. On 7th July
1978 the manager of the defendant’s local agents wrote to the loss
adjusters stating that the fire had been caused as a result of
interference with a fail-safe device and that, in view of that, the
defendant would deny liability but would consider making an ex-gratia
payment. On 13th July, the loss adjusters wrote to the plaintiff’s
solicitors and stated that the plaintiff was under a duty to disclose
any alteration in the risk and failure to do so constituted a
contravention of clause 2(a) of the policy (relating to alterations
made after the policy had come into force); for that reason the
defendant repudiated liability but would consider making an ex gratia
payment in settlement of the claim. A copy of this letter was sent
to the defendant. In November 1978 the plaintiff accepted an offer
of $60,967 from the loss adjusters in settlement. This sum was not
paid and the plaintiff sued for its recovery and for damages for
consequential loss of profits. In its defence the defendant pleaded
avoidance of liability under clause 2(a) of the policy by reason of
the removal of the protection device after the policy of insurance
had come into operation. The plaintiff denied (in its reply) that
any device had been removed after the insurance had been effected. 
In a rejoinder the defendant pleaded, inter alia and as an
alternative, that the plaintiff had failed to report the absence of
the protective device and that the non-disclosure prejudiced the
defendant. At the trial the defendant adduced no evidence to show
that the protective device had been removed after the policy of
insurance had come into operation. The trial judge ruled that the
defendant could not rely on any non-disclosure of a material act as
entitling it to repudiate 

 162 

 the
contract of insurance in accordance with clause 1 of the policy. The
plaintiff was awarded $60,967 but the judge refused to award damages
or interest on that sum. The defendant appealed and the plaintiff
cross-appealed against the refusal to award damages or interest. 

 Held, dismissing the defendant’s appeal and allowing the plaintiff’s
cross-appeal in part - 

 (1)
The defendant elected to repudiate liability under clause 2(a) of the
policy on 7th July 1978 when the manager of its local agents wrote to
the loss adjusters repudiating liability; as at that time the
defendant was in possession of the full facts no question of estoppel
from pleading non-disclosure under clause 1 of the policy arose. 

 (2)
The reference to non-disclosure in the rejoinder did not adequately
raise the issue of non-disclosure under clause 1 in the pleadings
when the defendant, up to the close of the pleadings, had relied on
repudiation under clause 2(a) of the policy; the plaintiff had not
had an opportunity to plead to this issue, and the omission could not
be treated as a mere technicality. 

 Waghorn
v Geo Wimpey&amp;Co Ltd [1970] 1 All ER 474 applied. 

 (3)
The plaintiff was entitled to interest on the sum agreed with the
loss adjusters from the date of his acceptance of the offer; interest
should be paid at 6 per cent; however, the plaintiff was not entitled
to damages for consequential loss of profits since the policy of
insurance did not cover this head of loss.

Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean States from a decision of
Glasgow J in the Eastern Caribbean Court, St Lucia, awarding
$60,967.72 to Zepherin Bakeries Ltd (the plaintiff). The plaintiff

 Robotham
JA delivered the judgment of the court. This is an appeal and a
cross-appeal from a judgment of Glasgow J delivered on 23rd November
1981, in which he awarded $60,967.72 to the plaintiff, being the
amount payable under a policy of insurance in respect of the
destruction by fire of bakery equipment and furniture on 2nd February
1978. Costs and a certificate for two counsel were also awarded. A
claim for damages was disallowed. The sum awarded represented the
amount which Toplis and Harding (West Indies) Ltd, an international
firm of adjusters, had recommended that the defendant should pay to
the plaintiff in settlement of the claim. The plaintiff had agreed
to accept this sum. It is the non-payment thereof which led to the
filing of this action in which, in addition, interest at the rate of
10 per cent from 29th November 1978 (the date on which the form of
acceptance was signed) until the date of payment, and general damages
were claimed. 

 The
defence in paragraphs 5 and 6 was a repudiation of liability based on
the alleged wrongful removal by the plaintiff, its servants or
agents, of a fire-protection relay mechanism attached to a Brandford
oil-burning oven (known as a “Honeywell Flame Safeguard Primary
Control”), the removal of which altered the circumstances affecting
the building insured in such a way as to increase the risk of loss or
damage by fire, without such alteration having been admitted by
memorandum signed by or on behalf of the defendant, as required by
clause 2(a) of the policy of insurance. 

 I
have deliberately refrained from stating the defence in terms any
wider than the above, because of the two main issues which this
appeal embraces. The first issue is: did the defendant base its
repudiation on the condition dealing with alteration to be found in
clause 2(a) of the policy (which relates to any alteration made after the commencement of the policy), or did it base it on clause 1 of the
policy (failure of the insured to disclose a material fact at the time of signing of the policy, such non-disclosure being the absence or
non-functioning of the Honeywell flame-control device)? The second
issue is: in view of the past conduct of the defendant and the
correspondence which passed between that company, the adjusters and
the plaintiff, what issues was the defendant permitted to raise
specifically by way of defence; and, generally, what issues were
raised on the pleadings as a whole, as at 29th January 1981 when the
case came on for trial before Glasgow J? 

 Some
of the pleadings will have to be examined in detail at a later stage,
but in order to present a true picture at the outset, I will refer to
them briefly in chronological sequence. The policy of insurance was
taken out on 3rd June 1977 for a period of one year. The fire took
place on 26th February 1978. The writ was filed and a statement of
claim delivered on or about 3 rd October 1979. 

 8th
October 1979 

 A
defence was delivered. In clear and unmistakable terms, paragraphs 

 164 

 5
and 6 of this defence pleaded an avoidance of the policy under clause
2(a). 

 16th
October 1979 

 Arising
out of the defence, further and better particulars were requested of
paragraph 6: (a) identifying the “protection relay mechanism”;
and the answer was, “the Honeywell Flame Safeguard Primary Control
RA 890; the Honeywell intermittent oil-burner control, and the fire
valve”; (b) all facts and matters relied on in support of the
allegation of removal by Edwin Zepherin (the managing director), his
servants or agents, of the protection relay mechanism; and the answer
was, “at the time of the fire the control unit on the diesel oil
burner had been removed”; and (c) when did the fact of the removal
come to the knowledge of the defendant; and the answer was “on or
after 13th March 1978”. 

 It
is of importance to note that, on the basis of these answers given by
the defendant’s solicitor, the defendant was aware from 13th March
that the Honeywell Flame Safeguard was not on the oven at the time of
the fire, but there was nothing then to indicate whether it had been
removed before the policy was taken out, or after. 

 5th
December 1979 

 A
reply was filed in which the plaintiff pleaded that it was aware of
the proviso in clause 2(a) of the policy, but denied the removal of
the mechanism as alleged by the defendant in paragraphs 5 and 6 of
the defence. In this reply, the plaintiff also pleaded that the
defendant was estopped from denying its liability under the policy of
insurance, by virtue of its having appointed Toplis and Harding Ltd
to carry out investigations relating to the fire and by the general
conduct of that company in arriving at a settlement with a
recommendation for payment. 

 15th
January 1980 

 The
defendant filed the controversial rejoinder in the case. Being a
pleading filed subsequent to the reply, leave of the court should
have been obtained before it could be served. No such leave was ever
sought or obtained; nor was any objection taken to the pleading. By
the time this document came to be filed, the defendant had (from 7th
July 1978) repudiated liability in a letter to Minvielle and
Chastanet Ltd, agents in St Lucia for Toplis and Harding Ltd, with a
request for them to communicate their repudiation to the plaintiff. 
A letter dated 13th July 1978 signed by G Jennings-Clarke, insurance
manager for Minvielle and Chastanet Ltd, was duly despatched to the
plaintiff’s solicitors (Montplaisir and d’Auvergne) informing
them of the position taken by the defendant in these terms: 




‘ We
are instructed to summarise the position taken by the [defendant] as
follows: ‘The oven-firing system was altered from the original 

 165 

 specification
of the manufacturers and this amounts to an increase of risk. The
[plaintiff] is under a duty to disclose any alteration and [its]
failure to do so contravenes [clause] 2(a) of the policy. The
[defendant has] therefore repudiated liability but nevertheless [is]
prepared to consider making an ‘ex gratia’ settlement’.’ 




 A
copy of this letter was sent to the defendant. Counsel for the
plaintiff submitted before this court that it was clear that at this
point in time the defendant had made its election to repudiate
liability under clause 2(a) of the policy (which related to
alterations made after the policy was in force) and that there was no
mention whatsoever of repudiation under clause 1 (which related to
non-disclosure of a material fact at the time of the proposal),
albeit that the defendant was then in possession of the full facts. 
No application was made to amend the defence; and the rejoinder,
after repeating paragraphs 5 and 6 of the defence, stated: 




‘ (3)
The defendant states that had the protection relay mechanism not been
removed, the risk of fire occurring would have been greatly reduced. 
The increased risk which existed was the result of the act of the
plaintiff, his servants or agents in removing the said protection
relay mechanism. Alternatively,
the plaintiff failed to report to the defendant the absence of the
protection relay mechanism which such non-disclosure prejudiced the
defendant’ . 




 The
controversial part of the rejoinder is that which is italicised. 
Counsel for the defendant contended that it was couched in terms
sufficient to show that it was intended to be a pleading of
non-disclosure of a material fact in a contract uberrima fides .
 On the other hand, counsel for the plaintiff contended that, if the
defendant’s solicitor had intended to raise the issue of
non-disclosure, it could not be done by way of a rejoinder as that
would amount to a misuse of the pleading. The proper course should
have been to apply to the court to amend the defence, setting out
fully and clearly therein, without any equivocation, the plea of
non-disclosure. He submitted that what was contained in paragraph
(3) was a “bald statement” which could not possibly be construed
as raising a defence as severe and far-reaching in its effect as the
non-disclosure of a material fact. In any event, he further
submitted that non-disclosure under clause 1 of the policy could not
have been raised as a defence at that stage, as the defendant had
already elected to repudiate liability under clause 2(a). 

 It
is noteworthy that Glasgow J in his judgment made no reference
whatsoever to the rejoinder, and it would appear that he did not
regard it as raising a defence of non-disclosure. He found that the
plaintiff was never informed that the defendant had repudiated the
policy under clause 1 by reason of any omission or concealment of a
material fact on the part of the plaintiff, and held that it was not
open to the defendant to rely on any such omission or concealment at
the trial before him. 

 The
last pleading to which reference will be made is the interrogatories 

 166 

 filed
by the defendant on the same day as the rejoinder (ie 15th January
1980). Question 4 asked: “Was the RA 890F (Honeywell Flame
Safeguard Primary Control) fitted into the Brandford oven on 26th
February 1978”? The answer filed on 1st August 1980 was: 




‘ The
RA 890F was attached to the Brandford oven on 26th February 1978, but
it was not functioning in one way but was functioning in another way.
 It had ceased to function two months after it was installed in
February 1977.’ 




 This
answer was only given in August 1980, by which time the matter was in
the trial list. The trial did not commence until 29th January 1981,
yet despite these answers there still was no application to amend the
defence. The judge heard evidence for the plaintiff from Edwin
Zepherin, the managing director, Carlysle Elezya, the manager of the
bakery, and from Geoffrey Jennings-Clarke, the insurance manager of
Minvielle and Chastanet Ltd, the agents in St Lucia for the adjusters
Toplis and Harding Ltd. 

 The
only witness for the defence was Roderick Clarke by then insurance
manager for Julian R Hunte and Co Ltd, the local agents for the
defendant. It is to be noted that Roderick Clarke was the person who
interviewed the managing director (Edwin Zepherin) and inspected the
bakery in June 1977 for the purpose of effecting the insurance
policy. He was only appointed manager in November 1979. 

 The
trial judge found as follows: 




‘ In
the instant case, it might have been open to the defendant to
repudiate the policy if [it] had wished to do so. The defendant elected to allege a
contravention of [clause] 2(a) of the policy as justification for
repudiating the plaintiff’s claim. In as much as [clause] 2(a) of
the policy applies to alterations made after the commencement of the insurance, it does not assist the defendant. 
The plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover the $60,967.72
claimed.’ 




 He
disallowed the claim for interest as not having been pursued. This
was not strictly correct, as the record shows. He also disallowed
the claim for general damages as being too remote. 

 The
appeal of the defendant was first in time and the relevant grounds
are: (2) the trial judge erred in law and/or in fact when he ruled
that the [defendant] elected to repudiate the plaintiff’s claim and
not to repudiate the policy; (3) The trial judge misdirected himself
in failing to hold that the [defendant] repudiated the policy and
also the claim; (4) the trial judge misdirected himself in failing to
hold that an allegation that an insured had failed to disclose a
material statement if made in pleadings in a suit is a good and
sufficient notice to the insured that the insurer had repudiated the
policy of insurance; and (5) the trial judge misdirected himself when
he held that the costs in this action were fit for two counsel. The
later appeal of the plaintiff was limited to the failure of the judge
to award general damages and interest as prayed in the statement of
claim. 

 167 

 Grounds
(2) and (3) of the defendant’s appeal relate to the first issue,
namely did the defendant repudiate liability under clause 2(a) of the
policy, or under clause 1? 

 Clause
1 of the policy provides that the policy should be voidable in the
event of any mis-statement, omission, or concealment of any material
fact or any misrepresentation or misdescription in any particular
material to be known for estimating the risk. Clause 2(a) reads: 




‘ Alteration: 

 This
policy shall be avoided with respect to any item thereof in regard to
which there be any alteration after the commencement of this
insurance. 

 (a)
If the trade or manufacture carried on be altered or if the nature of
the occupation of, or other circumstances affecting the building
insured or containing the insured property be changed in such a way
as to increase the risk of loss or damage by a peril insured against
by this policy: ... unless such alteration be admitted by memorandum
signed by or on behalf of the company’. 




 After
the fire on 26th February 1978, the defendant appointed Toplis and
Harding Ltd, adjusters for the purpose of the claim. They in turn
contacted their agents in St Lucia, Minvielle and Chastanet Ltd, and
Geoffrey Jennings-Clarke (the manager of this company) piloted the
investigations. Some days after the fire he made a further visit to
the damaged premises accompanied by Mr Hodge, an official from the
regional head office of Toplis and Harding in Trinidad, and Mr
Rees-Watkins, also from Trinidad. 

 Before
Glasgow J Jennings-Clarke said: 




‘ These
men [that is Hodge and Rees-Watkins] had conversations with Mr Edwin
Zepherin. I was present at some of these. I recall a conversation
about a Honeywell protective relay system. When I attended the day
after the fire and again during the visit some days later, I think
with Mr Hodge from Trinidad, Mr Zepherin related to us what he had
done since he acquired the baking machinery about eighteen months
previously. He stated that he had continually had trouble with the
Honeywell equipment which he had at some stage purchased for fitting
to the other one. I recall him saying that the Honeywell had been
working on the oven at various times but it continually had given
trouble and I recall that he said that it was not working for one or
two months at least before he took the insurance ...’ 




 Jennings-Clarke
was then shown his letter dated 13th July 1978 in which he advised
the plaintiff’s solicitors (Monplaisir and d’Auvergne) that the
defendant had repudiated liability under clause 2(a) of the policy. 
He said “By repudiating liability I understand it to mean rejection
of the claim as opposed to rejection of the policy”. In
cross-examination he said: 

 168 




‘ Prior
to my letter of 13th July 1978 to Monplaisir and d’Auvergne the
[defendant] had clearly repudiated liability under the policy and had
instructed Toplis and Harding to consider making an ‘ex gratia’
settlement’. 




 When
the letter of 13th July was written to the plaintiff’s solicitors
and signed by Jennings-Clarke, he was acting on a letter which he had
received dated 7th July 1978 and signed by Michael Mason, then the
insurance manager for Julian R Hunte and Co Ltd, the local agents for
the defendant. This letter must be quoted in full because it has a
distinct bearing on both the circumstances under which the
repudiation was made and the pleadings. 




‘ We
refer to our letter of 28th June 1978, and our subsequent
conversation with Mr Hodge on 29th June, and telephone conversation
with Mr Rees Watkins, on 6th July 1978. 

 Mr
Zepherin has complained to us that he has not been kept informed of
the recent development in this matter, and we therefore attempt below
to set out the facts as we see them. (1) The fire was caused by an
explosion of fuel oil in the already hot chamber of the boiler. (2)
Unignited fuel was allowed into the chamber because the [plaintiff]
had interfered with the manufacturer’s fail-safe device. (3) The
[plaintiff] had been advised that such interference given the right
circumstances would inevitably result in a fire. (4) Whether such
interference took place prior to the granting of cover or afterwards,
it was a material fact that should have been disclosed to the
[defendant]. Notwithstanding the fact that the [defendant’s]
agents did carry out cursory examination of the premises, prior to
the granting of cover the [plaintiff] had a duty to disclose the full
facts given his superior knowledge of the operation. 

 In
view of the above we must maintain our denial of liability as we feel
we have sufficient evidence to prove a serious breach of the
principle of the utmost good faith on the part of the [plaintiff]. 

 Please
therefore appraise Mr Zepherin of our position, in writing at the
earliest opportunity. 

 Consideration
of an ‘ex gratia’ settlement must depend on the [plaintiff’s]
co-operation.’ 




 The
question that arises for consideration here is whether or not the
defendant at the time when it wrote this letter was in possession of
the full facts to enable it to make an election either to repudiate
the policy ab initio, or merely to repudiate the claim under clause
2(a). Counsel for the defendant conceded that if an insurer decided
to affirm a policy as valid, but to repudiate a claim on the ground
that a condition had been breached, he cannot at a later stage recant
and attempt to repudiate the policy. In other words the company
would be bound by its election once it has been made ( West
v National Motor and Accident Insurance Union Ltd (1955] 1 All ER 800). He submitted, however, that the insurers were 

 169 

 entitled
to investigate and must be in possession of all the facts before
deciding to repudiate. He further submitted that it is only when the
adjuster puts his findings before the insurers that they are called
upon to make an election and they must be given a reasonable time in
which to do so. In so far as the letter of 13th July 1978 written by
Jennings-Clarke to the plaintiffs solicitors could be elevated to the
status of a letter from the defendant, it was not capable of taking
on the meaning of an election by the company. 

 On
behalf of the plaintiff it was agreed that once there has been a
failure to make full disclosure an insurer may, on the discovery of
the full facts, elect to avoid the poliocy ab initio. It was also
admitted that a reasonable time should be given to make the election,
which is binding when made ( Allen
v Robles [1969] 3 All ER 154). Counsel for the plaintiff, however, submitted
that the defendant must have been in possession of the full facts
when it wrote the letter on 7th July 1978, and was therefore in a
position to make an election to avoid for non-disclosure, or
otherwise. This, he said, was based on the fact that
Jennings-Clarke, the adjuster, had been told by Zepherin that the
Honeywell device was not working for one or two months before the
insurance was taken out, and that a by-pass had been installed. 
Zepherin himself gave evidence of the nature of this alternative
safety device. That all this information, he said, must have been
communicated to Michael Mason the insurance manager, was clear from
the very terms of his letter. There was, he submitted, no evidence
in the entire case to show that the Honeywell device was removed
after the policy was taken out. 

 It
appears to me that the first paragraph of this letter shows quite
clearly that the defendant was kept up to date by the adjusters, and
that they could only have written that letter if they were fully
appraised of the facts and circumstances prior to and subsequent to
the fire. Although counsel for the defendant submitted that the
letter of repudiation written by Jennings-Clarke to the plaintiff’s
solicitor on 13th July was not capable of being elevated to the
status of an election by the defendant, it must be borne in mind that
this letter was copied to the defendant and it took no steps to
countermand what was stated in it. Even when the defence was filed
some three months later, it was still alleged (in paragraphs 5 and 6)
that there was a breach of clause 2(a) of the policy. 

 I
think that if there was any doubt as to what stand was being taken by
the defendant at that stage, that the very last answer given by
Roderick Clarke (the only witness for the defence), in response to a
question which was put to him in cross-examination, puts the matter
to rest. That answer is recorded in the judge’s notes: “This is
a telex of 3rd July 1978 which directs Julian R Hunte and Co to deny
liability under clause 2(a) of the policy”. The final answer given
in cross-examination after being shown the telex was diametrically
opposed to the answer given in the final stage of his
examination-in-chief: “Defendant has denied liability to the claim
because a material fact was not disclosed at the time the insurance
was taken out”. This telex did not form a part 

 170 

 of
the exhibits in the case and this note on the record was not referred
to by either counsel during the hearing of the appeal. 

 Before
passing on, however, the question may very well be asked: “If the
defendant wanted to repudiate liability under clause 1 of the policy,
why was it willing to consider an ‘ex gratia’ payment depending
on the plaintiffs co-operation”? A person who is in the position
of manager of an insurance company must be aware that the
consequences of a policy which is avoided for non-disclosure are that
the policy is set aside ab initio, and the premium payable is
refundable. Although the defendant expressed this willingness, it
seems strange that by 29th November 1978 (after the adjusters Toplis
and Harding Ltd had arrived at the figure claimed in this action as a
reasonable ex gratia settlement and the plaintiff had signed the form
of acceptance) the defendant refused to pay anything at all. 

 I
am of the view, when all the facts and circumstances are taken into
account, that the defendant elected to repudiate the policy under
clause 2(a). There was no evidence in the case to support the
allegation in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the defence that any alteration
was made after the commencement of the insurance and the trial judge
was quite correct in holding that clause 2(a) could not assist the
defendant in its defence. The date of its election would have to be
7th July 1978, the date on which Michael Mason, the insurance manager
for Julian Hunte and Co Ltd, wrote to Toplis and Harding Ltd
repudiating liability, and requesting them to apprise Zepherin of the
position. This act of repudiation was communicated by
Jennings-Clarke to the plaintiff’s solicitors on 13th July, and a
copy was sent to the defendant. The election of the defendant was
then an accomplished fact, so much so that it formed a part of its
defence filed on 8th October 1979. Grounds (2) and (3) therefore
fail. 

 This
now brings me to ground (4) and a consideration of the second issue
which can now be re-stated thus: (a) if the defendant had in fact
made its election to repudiate liability on 7th July 1978 under
clause 2(a) of the policy, was it estopped from subsequently pleading
non-disclosure under clause 1? (b) assuming that the defendant could
have pleaded non-disclosure of a material fact under clause 1, did
the rejoiner raise such an issue? 

 Counsel
for the defendant conceded at the hearing of the appeal that his
defence as filed on 8th October 1979 did not raise the issue of
non-disclosure. Paragraph 5 of the defence reads: 




‘ The
policy of insurance referred to in paragraph 2 hereof was subject to
a proviso that the policy shall be avoided with respect to any item
in regard to which there be any alteration after the commencement of
the insurance if the trade or manufacture carried on be altered or if
the nature of the occupation or other circumstances affecting the
building insured or containing the insured’s property be changed in
such a way as to increase the risk of loss or damage by fire, unless
such alternative be admitted by memorandum signed by or on behalf of
the company.’ 




 171 

 Paragraph
6 of the defence reads: 




‘ The
loss in respect of which the claim of the plaintiff is made was
caused by, or happened through, or in consequence of the said Edwin
Zepherin by himself his servants and/or agents removing or causing to
be removed a protection relay mechanism which said removal altered
the circumstances affecting the building insured and increased the
risk of loss or damage by fire.’ 




 Counsel
for the defendant submitted that an estoppel by waiver should not be
visited on the company unless all the previous conduct of the company
was of such a nature as to show that it had thrown away its rights. 
In this particular case, he submitted that the defendant became
entitled to plead non-disclosure only when the answer to the
interrogatories was filed on 1st August 1980. The finding that the
defendant was in possession of all the facts on 7th July 1978
disposes of this submission, and I am further of the opinion that,
having elected to repudiate liability under clause 2(a), the
defendant could not at a later stage be allowed to plead avoidance of
the policy ab initio for non-disclosure under clause 1. 

 Even
if this was not so, did the rejoinder (in particular) and the
pleading (as a whole) raise the issue of non-disclosure under clause
1? As I have already indicated Glasgow J was not of that opinion. 
Under Order 18(4) of the West Indies Associated States Supreme Court
Rules 1970 no pleading subsequent to a reply may be served except
with the leave of the court. No leave was obtained in this case. 
Upon the hearing of an application for leave to serve a rejoinder,
the pleading should be produced to the court so that it can be
examined to see if it is necessary. The function of pleadings is to
ascertain with precision the matters in dispute or in agreement, and
thus to arrive at certain clear, issues on which a judicial decision
is sought. It may very well be that, had leave been sought and the
rejoinder exhibited to the judge in its present form, this situation
might never have arisen. 

 In The Law of Insurance (3rd Edn) by Colinvaux, Chapter 5, paragraph 143, the effect of
non-disclosure is stated thus: 




‘ Where
the assured conceals something he knows to be material such
concealment is fraud. But in any case the effect of mere
non-disclosure on an insurance contract is to some extent the same as
the effect of fraud; the party aggrieved when the matter comes to his
knowledge may choose to carry on with the contract or not. It is
voidable at the election of the aggrieved party as opposed to that
class of contract which is void by operation of law.’ 




 Non-disclosure,
therefore, being akin to fraud should be specifically pleaded and not
be left to the imagination. The rejoinder commenced by repeating
paragraphs 5 and 6 of the defence. These related solely to the
removal of the Honeywell Flame Safeguard Primary Control after 

 172 

 the
policy had become effective. Then came paragraph (3), which is in
two parts. The first part reads: 




‘ The
defendant states that had the protection relay mechanism not been
removed, the risk of the fire occurring would have been greatly
reduced. The increased risk which existed was the act of the
plaintiff his servants, or agents in removing the said protection
relay mechanism.’ 




 This
surely is nothing more than a repetition of paragraph 6 of the
defence. The second part went on to state: “Alternatively, the
plaintiff failed to report to the defendant the absence of the
protection relay mechanism which such non-disclosure prejudiced the
defendant”. Can it be said that this was sufficient to raise a
defence of non-disclosure? The pleadings up to this stage bore the
stamp of particularity and I cannot see how the defendant, if it
wished to avoid the policy for the non-disclosure of a material fact
under clause 1 of the policy, could have failed either to plead such
non-disclosure with precision and clarity, or applied to amend the
defence to include such a plea. All the facts of this case coupled
with the correspondence and the pleadings point to the fact that the
defendant, up to the time when the pleadings were finally considered
closed, relied on a repudiation under clause 2(a) and not clause 1 of
the policy. If it were otherwise, why (for example) would it in its
letter of 7th July 1978 to Toplis and Harding Ltd repudiating
liability have expressed a willingness to consider an “ex gratia”
settlement depending on the plaintiff’s co-operation? 

 I
am of the opinion that the allegations contained in paragraph (3) of
the rejoinder could not be construed as raising a plea of
non-disclosure of a material fact under clause 1 of the policy so as
to avoid the policy ab initio. A cardinal rule is that a party is
bound by his pleadings. If he wishes to depart from them and the
circumstances allow such a course of action, he must apply to amend. 
A case in point is Waghorn v Geo Wimpey&amp;Co Ltd [1970] 1 All ER 474. There, the defendants were engaged in
installing and maintaining the pipe work on an oil refinery site. 
There was on the site a number of large-capacity tanks grouped in
blocks of four, each block being surrounded by an earthwork or bank
4½ feet high with sides sloping at an angle of 30 degrees or
thereabout. Mobile mess-rooms were provided at specific points on
the site for the employees who, on various occasions during the
course of the day, had to cross the earthworks to get to the
mess-rooms. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries he received
when (he said) he fell down the side of the 30-degree slope while
returning to the caravan housing the mess-room. The allegation of
negligence against the defendants was that they must have known that
the slope which their employees had to cross was dangerous, and
accordingly they should have taken precautions. The trial judge
found that the accident had occurred by the side of the caravan (but
nowhere near the earthwork) and that the plaintiff had not been
traversing the earthwork immediately before or after the accident. 
Lane 

 173 

 J
held that the pleaded allegations were irrelevant, and that it was
not a case which was just a variation, modification, or development
of what had been averred; it was new, separate and distinct, and not
merely a technicality; and it constituted a radical departure from
the case as pleaded so as to disentitle the plaintiff to succeed. He
said (at page 479): 




‘ One
often listens sympathetically to applications to amend in those
circumstances. Here there is nothing technical at all. A man is
said to have slipped... One must test the plaintiff’s submission
in this way. If these allegations had been made on the pleadings in
the first place, namely allegations based on the facts which have now
emerged, would the defendants’ conduct of the preparation of the
case and of the trial have been any different? The answer to that is
undoubtedly ‘yes’.’ 




 The
whole burden of the plaintiff’s case and the whole burden of the
defence to that claim was the safety or otherwise of the earthmound. 
In this case, the whole burden of the defence was an allegation of, a
breach of clause 2(a) of the policy. What the defendant attempted to
do here, was to introduce a plea of the non-disclosure of material
facts under clause 1 of the policy at the trial, a matter which it
did not plead. The plaintiff as a result never pleaded to this
issue. It was no mere technicality but a radical departure from the
defence as pleaded, and opened up a new avenue of law and fact. This
the defendant could not be allowed to do. It would be contrary to
all the rules of pleading and Glasgow J was, in my view, right in his
finding that the defendant having failed to inform the plaintiff that
it had repudiated the policy under clause 1, could not rely on an
alleged breach of clause 1 before him. Ground (4) of the appeal
therefore fails. But for the question of costs fit for two counsel
(ground (5)), which will be dealt with at the end of this judgment,
the appeal of the defendant fails. 

 Turning
now to the appeal of the plaintiff, counsel submitted that the trial
judge was wrong when he failed to award the plaintiff damages. 
Whilst the plaintiff, he said, did everything possible to mitigate
its loss, the failure of the defendant to pay the amount agreed
between the plaintiff and the adjuster, was the direct cause of its
subsequent damage. Such damage mainly consisted of its loss of
profits and the effect of the Bank of Nova Scotia having put the
plaintiff into receivership. 

 Counsel
for the defendant submitted that-after the fire the plaintiff
continued baking operations in a smaller way at alternative
accommodation, but elected to retain the business premises on which
the fire took place, paying $800 per month rent, even though the
owners had asked it to leave. He referred the court to article 536
of the Commercial Code (Insurance) which states that losses in the
nature of loss of profits are not recoverable unless expressly
covered. 

 Consequential
loss insurance was devised for the purpose of giving protection to
the insured against losses which, although consequent upon the loss
of his property by a peril insured against (such as fire), are 

 174 

 not
covered by an ordinary form of policy (22 Halsbury’s
Laws of England (3rd Edn) page 402, paragraph 823). There was no evidence to suggest
that the plaintiff carried such a policy, or that the policy issued
to it contained any clause about loss of profits. It would seem to
me therefore that the company is precluded from recovering any such
damages. This segment of the plaintiff’s appeal therefore fails. 

 On
the question of the judge’s failure to award interest at the rate
of 10 per cent as from 29th November 1978, counsel for the defendant
submitted that if a party pursues a legitimate defence, and if having
lost, interest is to be awarded, it should only run as from the date
of the judgment. This may be a laudible suggestion in so far as the
insurance company is concerned, but is the plaintiff to suffer for
having been deprived up until now of the money agreed upon with the
adjuster? Whilst not for one moment suggesting that the defendant
was guilty of sharp practice, I consider its action in the matter to
have been ill-conceived, and not entirely blameless. I would
therefore allow the plaintiffs appeal on the question of interest,
and award it interest at the rate of 6 per cent from 29th November
1978, until the date of payment. 

 Finally
ground (5) of the defendant’s appeal was that the judge misdirected
himself when he held that, in relation to costs, the action was fit
for two counsel. It has never been otherwise than that costs are
within the discretion of the court. Whilst it cannot be arbitrarily
exercised, there are many matters which must be considered. These
are set out in Order 62, Part IX of Appendix 1 of the Rules of the
Supreme Court 1970. They include such matters as the complexity of
the cause or matter, the skill and responsibility required of and the
time and labour expended by counsel, and the amount of the money
involved. This matter had been in the hands of the plaintiff’s
solicitors from 1978 until it came to trial in 1981. I do not
consider it unreasonable that costs for two counsel were awarded, and
this ground of the defendant’s appeal also fails. 

 In
the final analysis I would: (1) dismiss the appeal of the defendant
in its entirety; (2) dismiss the appeal of the plaintiff as to
damages and affirm the award of the trial judge to the plaintiff of
$60,967.72; and (3) allow the plaintiff’s appeal as to interest,
and award interest at the rate of 6 per cent from 29th November 1978
until the date of payment. 

 The
burden of this appeal was on the defendant, and it failed. The only
issue on which the plaintiff failed was damages. I do not think that
this is sufficient cause to deprive the plaintiff of its full costs
of this appeal. The final order in my view should be that judgment
be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $60,967.72, with interest
at the rate of 6 per cent from 29th November 1978 until the date of
payment, and that the plaintiff be granted costs of this appeal to be
taxed. 

 Appeal
of the defendant dismissed. 

 Appeal
of the plaintiff allowed in part.

 Appeal 

 Appeal The Attorney-General of St Christopher and Nevis appealed to the
Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean States against declarations
made by Bishop J in the Eastern Caribbean Court, St
Christopher-Nevis, on the application of Edmund W Lawrence. The
facts are set out in the judgment of Sir Neville Peterkin CJ.

 L
Moore (instructed by F Bryant) for Lawrence. 

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Sir
Neville Peterkin CJ delivered the judgment of the court. This is an appeal from the
decision of Bishop J granting to Edmund W Lawrence a declaration that
the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd (Special Provisions)
Act 1982 is unconstitutional, void, and of no effect since it
contravenes the fundamental right to protection from deprivation of
property, as set out in section 6 of the Constitution of St
Christopher and Nevis. Also granted was the ancillary declaration
that all acts already done and any future acts which may be purported
to be done by anyone under the provisions of that Act are and shall
be null and void and of no effect. 

 On
15th March 1982, the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd and
Edmund W Lawrence, through their solicitors, filed a motion seeking
redress in respect of an alleged contravention of section 6 of the
Constitution. When the motion came before the trial judge on 1st
April 1982 he suggested that the application by Edmund Lawrence be
heard and determined and that of the bank be deferred. This
suggestion met with the agreement of counsel for all parties. 
Accordingly, the only matter left before the court is the application
of Edmund Lawrence. 

 The
application was made under section 16 of the Constitution of St
Christopher and Nevis. It sought the following declarations: 




‘ (1)
That the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd (Special
Provisions) Act 1982, passed by the House of Assembly of St
Christopher and Nevis on 8th March 1982 contravenes section 6 of the
Constitution and is therefore unconstitutional, null, void and of no
effect. 

 (2)
That the purported appointment of six persons to constitute the board
of directors of the bank on 8th March 1982 by the Minister of
Finance, is unconstitutional, void and of no effect. 

 (3)
That the purported assumption of the management, control and
administration of the business and affairs and assets of the bank on
8th March 1982 by the six persons appointed by the Minister, is
unconstitutional, void and of no effect. 

 (4)
That the purported termination of the services of Edmund W Lawrence
with the bank on 8th March 1982 by the six persons appointed by the
Minister, is unconstitutional, void and of no effect. 




 In
short, the application was one under section 16 of the Constitution
challenging the legislation in question. The material and
substantial facts were not seriously in dispute. 

 On
13th September 1958, the St Kitts Industrial Bank Ltd was duly
incorporated under the laws of the country and some eleven years
later Edmund W Lawrence commenced working with the company. On 16th 

 177 

 March
1970, he was appointed managing director. His appointment to that
position was the result of a resolution of the board of directors
whereby it was also agreed that he should hold such office until he
resigned, or until he ceased to hold the office because he ceased to
be a director. This was by virtue of the provisions of the company’s
articles of association. On 15th February 1971, the company came to
be known as the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd. Lawrence
was its managing director and chairman of the board of directors. 

 On
8th March 1982, a notice was issued convening a meeting of the House
of Assembly of St Christopher and Nevis on that same day. The
meeting was held and the House of Assembly passed through all of its
stages, a Bill shortly entitled “the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla
National Bank Ltd (Special Provisions) Act 1982”. It received the
assent of the Governor later that same day. At about five minutes
before 5 o’clock that afternoon, a letter was delivered by
Constable Rawlins to Lawrence. It was dated 8th March 1982. It
informed him of the enactment and continued in part: 




‘ As
a consequence of the enactment of the above legislation, the
directors of St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd have ceased to
hold office and a new board has been appointed to manage and control
the affairs of the bank.’ 




 The
letter was signed by the Minister of Finance, and it is not in
dispute that it purported to remove Lawrence as a director of the
board of directors of the bank, a position to which he had been
elected by the members of that company in general meeting. 

 At
5.00 p m on that same day Lawrence received another letter. It
informed him that in consequence of the enactment a new board of
directors had been appointed under the Act. It then continued: 




‘ I
am therefore to inform you that the board of directors of the bank
requires you forthwith to surrender the keys, documentation and
property of the bank to the chairman.’ 




 It
was signed by William Liburd as chairman. 

 At
5.20 p m Lawrence received yet another letter from William Liburd as
chairman. It read: 




‘ I
write to inform you that the board of directors has taken a decision
to terminate your services with immediate effect. You are therefore
required to vacate the premises immediately.’ 




 The
following is a statement of facts agreed by counsel: 




‘ That
same day somewhere near 5.00 p m some six members of the State’s
police force, including the Commissioner of Police, claiming to have
been appointed by the Minister of Finance, entered the head office of
the company at a comer of Church and Central Streets, Basseterre, and
proceeded to take certain action including purporting 

 178 

 to
hold meetings, purporting to terminate the appointment of Mr Lawrence
as managing director of the company, ejecting [Lawrence] from the
premises and demanding and receiving from him keys and vehicles
belonging to the company but held by him in right of his office in
the said company. Ever since 8th March 1982 these same six persons
have been holding meetings from time to time and purporting to act
for and on behalf of the company, St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National
Bank Ltd, and have remained in control of the business, affairs and
assets of the said company.’ 




 Lawrence
complied with all the requests made of him. There was no mention of
any arrangement for remuneration or compensation, and the Act itself
is silent in this regard. It was in these circumstances that he
ceased to be a director and his services as managing director of the
bank ended. He was from then on left in the position of an ordinary
shareholder in the company. 

 The
obligation for payment of just compensation is a necessary incident
of the power of compulsory acquisition of property both under the
doctrine of the English common law as well as under the Continental
doctrine of eminent domain subsequently adopted in America. The
Constitution of St Kitts and Nevis raised this obligation to pay
compensation for the compulsory acquisition of property to the status
of a fundamental right. Section 6 of that Constitution reads in
part: 




‘ No
property of any description shall be compulsorily taken possession
of, and no interest in or right over property of any description
shall be compulsorily acquired, except by or under the provisions of
a law that prescribes the principles on which and the manner in which
compensation therefor is to be determined and given.’ 




 The
right of enforcement of protective provisions is contained in section
16 which reads in part: 




‘ If
any person alleges that any of the provisions of sections 2 to 15
(inclusive) of this Constitution has been, is being or is likely to
be contravened in relation to him (or, in the case of a person who is
detained, if any other person alleges such a contravention in
relation to the detained person), then, without prejudice to any
other action with respect to the same matter which is lawfully
available, that person (or that other person) may apply to the High
Court for redress.’ 




 The
Constitution expressly confers upon the court the powers of judicial
review. As regards fundamental rights, the court has been described
as being in the role of a sentinel on the “ qui
vive ”.
 In determining the question of constitutionality of a statute, what
the court is concerned with is the competence of the legislature to
make it, and not its wisdom or motives. The court has to examine its
provisions in 

 179 

 the
light of the relevant provisions of the Constitution. The
presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of an
enactment, and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that
there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional
principles. 

 The
trial judge has given in the course of his judgment what I consider
to be a fair and accurate interpretation of the impugned Act of 1982.
 I propose to adopt it as in my view it suffices for the purposes of
this appeal. It reads: 




‘ As
I interpret the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd (Special
Provisions) Act 1982, from the moment that it commenced (on 8th March
1982) the directors of the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd,
who had been appointed by the shareholders and who had conducted the
business and affairs of that company, were automatically dismissed
and ceased to hold office. The word ‘bank’ then came to mean the
St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd incorporated under the
Companies Act and all subsidiary, affiliated or related companies to
the extent that they are wholly or partially owned by the St
Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla Bank Ltd, including the National Bank Trust Co
(St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla) Ltd, National Caribbean Insurance Co Ltd,
National Investments Ltd, National Investments Repurchase Ltd,
National Properties Ltd and National Insurance Brokers Ltd. It then
became necessary to appoint a board of directors under this new
legislation. It called for a board of ten directors, six of whom
were to be appointed by the Minister charged with the responsibility
for Finance on behalf of the Government of the State (a shareholder
in the company) and four of whom were to be appointed by the
shareholders on behalf of the remaining 622 non-governmental
shareholders. Until ten directors were so appointed, a board of
directors could not, in my opinion, be deemed to have come (properly
and legally) into existence. These ten directors having been
appointed as required by the legislation, they would then be in a
position to fulfil the further legislative requirement of appointing
a chairman of the board of directors from among their number. 
Thereafter the management, control and administration of the business
and of the affairs of the bank would vest (by virtue of the
legislation) in the board of directors which could exercise,
discharge and perform the powers, functions and duties of the bank
for the purpose of carrying on the business and of administering the
affairs of the bank. If after the board was appointed, there was a
change in the shareholding from that which existed at the start of
the Act, then the composition of the board would have to be altered
in order to reflect the actual proportions brought about by that
change. The legislation also gave the power to fill temporary
vacancies caused through illness, absence or any other cause, of any
of the directors, to the Minister of Finance, where the illness or
absence concerned any of the six directors appointed by the Minister
of Finance, and to the 

 180 

 shareholders,
where any of the four directors appointed by the shareholders was
involved. So, too, the power of removal of a director from office
was given to the Minister of Finance in respect of the directors
appointed by the Minister of Finance and to the shareholders in
respect of those four directors appointed by the non-governmental
shareholders. In my view, under this legislation the Minister could
not fill temporary vacancies which arose among the four directors
appointed by the non-governmental shareholders, nor could the
Minister remove from office any of those particular directors. Nor
could the non-governmental shareholders fill any temporary vacancies
arising among the six directors appointed by the Minister or remove
any of them from office. I hold the views I have just expressed
about the power of filling temporary vacancies and of removal because
the paragraphs of the section dealing with such powers indicated that
they were vested in ‘the Minister or the shareholders as the case
may be’ and not in the Minister or the shareholders. In other
words, the expression ‘as the case may be’ could not be ignored
and the interpretation which ought to be given to it was, ‘the
Minister in the case of the six directors and the shareholders in the
case of the four directors’. The St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National
Bank Ltd (Special Provisions) Act 1982 did not give any guide-lines
whereby the removal of a director might be made, and so the power of
removal in the Minister, where the six directors was concerned, was
unrestricted. From the afternoon of 8th March 1982 the Minister of
Finance on behalf of one shareholder (the Government of the State)
holding 60 per cent of the shares, could appoint a majority of the
directors to the board of directors. Immediately before the Act
became law the directors were appointed by the shareholders. 

 The
legislation debarred or disqualified a Member of the House of
Assembly from being a director and it also laid down the duration of
tenure of office, of every director, as well as the manner in which
he could resign from office. A director who resigned or served his
full period of office was made eligible for re-appointment. 

 Meetings
of the board of directors were also governed by the St
Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd (Special Provisions) Act 1982.
 A quorum was constituted if five members were present at any meeting
of the board of directors, and meetings were required to be held at
least once in every month. There was provision for additional
meetings and for a chairman to preside at each meeting. It was clear
from the legislation that if only the directors appointed by the
Minister of Finance attended a meeting after the board of directors
had been constituted, a quorum would be satisfied; however, the
directors appointed by the non-governmental shareholders could never
(by themselves alone) form a quorum. At least one of the directors
appointed on behalf of the Government of the State would have to
attend the meeting. Decisions in relation to the management, control 

 181 

 and
administration of the business and affairs of the bank were to be
reached by a majority of those present and voting and a quorum
required the presence of five directors. So that under the
legislation, there was the distinct situation in which it was
possible for decisions to be made by a majority of the directors
appointed by the Minister of Finance; and participation by those
directors appointed by the shareholders could be shut out when
decisions concerned management, control and administration of the
business and affairs of the bank. However, there could never be a
meeting at which decisions could properly be made without the
presence and participation of at least one director appointed by the
Minister of Finance. 

 The
Act permitted the funds of the bank to be used as the source of
remuneration of the directors, with the rates being fixed by the
board of directors, although paid from the funds of the company, the
sums were determined by the company in general meeting (article 53 of
the articles of association). The company in general meeting was
also given the power, by article 62 of the articles of association,
to alter the remuneration and, indeed, the number of directors. 

 The
Act saved the proceedings of the board of directors in the situation
where it was found that a vacancy existed among its members or there
had been a failure to appoint a member as required by the legislation
or a defect in the appointment of a member of the board of directors.
 Such a validation, in my view, would apply only after there had been
a proper appointment of the board of directors, that is the ten
directors. It could not be relevant nor could the provisions be
relied upon in the initial appointment of a board of directors. 

 This
legislation also gave to the board of directors the power to make
regulations and to amend the memorandum and articles of association
of the bank so as to achieve the purposes and give effect to the
principles embodied in the Act. Finally, the Act gave to itself a
measure of supremacy where there might be a conflict with the
memorandum and articles of association of the bank, the Companies
Act, and any other Act; and it indicated that the bank should still
be seen to be a company under the Companies Act.’ 




 At
a later stage of his judgment, in dealing with section 6 of the
Constitution, he stated: 




‘ I
come now to section 6(5) of the Constitution, which counsel for [the
Attorney-General] invited me to consider in order to be able to
ascertain the thinking of the framers of the Constitution. As I
understand the subsection, it sets out an-exception to section 6(1)
and so it describes the circumstances in which there may be a lawful
deprivation of property without payment of compensation. By the
subsection a law may be promulgated which allows for compulsory
taking possession of any property or for compulsory acquisition of
any interest in or right over property provided that that property,
that 

 182 

 interest
or that right is held by a body corporate that has been established,
by law, for public purposes and in which no moneys have been invested
apart from moneys provided by the legislature. The St
Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd (Special Provisions) Act 1982
clearly does not fall within the subsection. I believe that I have
dealt sufficiently with that Act to demonstrate why I so find.’ 




 I
would agree. 

 He
then commented as follows: 




‘ It
was the view of counsel for [Lawrence] that the Act has transformed
the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla National Bank Ltd into a statutory board
largely appointed by the Minister, responsible to the Minister and
removable by the Minister. I think that there is merit in that
view.’ 




 In
conclusion he said: 




‘ In
addition to the reasons that I have already mentioned, I am of the
opinion that Lawrence as managing director and as director was
entitled to challenge the validity of the St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla
National Bank (Special Provisions) Act 1982 on the basis that it
infringed the fundamental right of the company to protection from
deprivation of property. He was entitled to challenge the authority
of the directors appointed by the Minister of Finance. These
directors could only act by virtue of authority bestowed upon them by
the Act and if that Act was found to be void then those persons would
have no authority to act as directors of the company, or to do what
they in fact did on 8th March this year where the company’s affairs
were concerned.’ 




 He
then went on to grant the declarations already mentioned. 

 For
the purposes of this appeal I propose to deal only with two of the
points argued. Not only did counsel set much store by them, but also
in my view they form the heart of the matter to be decided. Suffice
it to say that in my opinion there is no merit in any of the other
points raised. In deference to brevity, I do not propose to mention
and deal with all of them. It has for instance been contended for on
behalf of the Attorney-General that the trial judge did not set his
mind to the question of exercising his discretion, as provided in the
proviso to section 16 of the Constitution. I do not agree. The
proviso does give the court a discretion to decline the duty. In
such a case the court would be in duty bound to state its reasons for
so declining, and the trial judge would have to show that he had
acted judicially in so doing rather than capriciously. In the
instant matter he did not so decline. In my view, by declaring as he
did, he must be taken to have adverted to the question. 

 This
appeal is primarily concerned with two aspects of the matter before
the court. They have been described by counsel for the
Attorney-General as two hurdles to be overcome by Lawrence. The
first is related 

 183 

 to
section 16 of the Constitution and deals with the question of locus standi .
 The second is related to section 6 and deals with the question of
“property” in the light of that section. 

 I
propose to deal with these two aspects in reverse order as, in my
opinion, it is first necessary to find whether Lawrence can allege an
infringement in relation to him. In other words, whether his
application is well founded in relation to himself. This he must
first show. 

 First
of all, we know that he was a director and a shareholder. Further to
this, we know that he was not just a paid employee of the bank, but
that he drew a percentage of the profits annually. At one stage this
was as high as 50 per cent. We know that this was subsequently
varied; but it is not my understanding that it is alleged that he
ever became a mere paid employee of the bank; and it is reasonable to
infer that his original status continued, perhaps at something less
than 50 per cent. 

 We
have been urged by counsel for the Attorney-General to follow the
decision in Chiranjit Lal v India ,
AIR (1951) SC 41. While these Indian cases may not be binding,
certainly they may be regarded as being persuasive. In that case,
which was the earliest Supreme Court case on the question of
“property”, the right of voting enjoyed by the shareholders of a
company, or there right to select the directors, or their right to
pass resolutions or to institute winding-up proceedings, were held as
not property. The facts show, that owing to mismanagement, Sholapur
Mills had closed down. It was one of the largest cotton textiles
mills employing a large labour force. Parliament passed the Sholapur
Spinning and Weaving Co (Emergency Provisions) Act empowering the
Indian Government to take over the control and management of the
company and its properties by appointing their own directors. This
Act was challenged by a shareholder. By a majority, however, the
court upheld the validity of the Act. In commenting on this
decision, the author of Indian Constitutional Law (M P Jain) records at page 368 “it will appear that the Chiranjit Lal case can be justified only on the exceptional circumstances and the
social interest involved therein”. Again, at page 408, he states: 




‘ The
view expounded above was very restrictive. It strikes at the root of
the protection of incorporeal rights. Further, the right of
management of the company, ordinarily vested in the shareholders, was
affected by the law in question and so the right to hold property was
affected.’ 




 In
course of time, however, the Indian Supreme Court has, to some
extent, moved away from these restrictive interpretations of the word
“property”. In Dwarka v Sholapur Mills ,
AIR (1954) SC 119, Das J held specifically that the mills, machinery,
stocks, etc, were “property”, as also were any contract or
agreement which a person might have with another. The matter has,
however, been clarified now by judicial pronouncements and the word
“property” is given a broad scope. It has been held that there
was no reason why the word “property” should not 

 184 

 be
given a liberal and wide connotation or should not be extended to
those well-recognised types of interest which have the insignia or
characteristics of proprietary rights. In our jurisdiction, it has
been extended to include money (see Inland Revenue Commissioner and Attorney-General v Lilleyman (1964) 7 WIR 496). I am of the view that section 6 applies equally
to concrete as well as abstract rights of property, and I would hold
that management is an important incident of holding property. 
Accordingly, I would accept that the trial judge was right in
concluding that such deprivations as Lawrence had alleged and shown
fell within the purview of section 6 of the Constitution. 

 I
turn now to the second aspect, namely did Lawrence have a locus standi in the constitutionality of the impugned Act? It is submitted not. 
To make out a case as alleged, it is incumbent upon Lawrence to
establish not merely that the law complained of affects or invades
his fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, but also that
it is beyond the competence of the legislature. 

 No-one
but one whose rights are directly affected by a law can raise the
question of the constitutionality of that law. A corporation has a
legal entity separate from that of its shareholders. Hence, in the
case of a corporation, whether the corporation itself or the
shareholders would be entitled to impeach the validity of the statute
will depend upon the question whether the rights of the corporation
or of the shareholders have been affected by the impugned statute. 
But it may happen that while a statute infringes the fundamental
rights of a company, it also affects the interests of its
shareholders; in such a case, the shareholders also can impugn the
constitutionality of the statute (see Cooper v Union of India (1970) 1 SCC 248). In the instant matter, as I see it, if Lawrence
can allege and show an infringement in relation to him, then he gains locus standi ,
and he becomes entitled thereby to raise the constitutionality of the
entire law in relation to the property of the company. Having
concluded that his application was well founded in relation to
Lawrence, the trial judge was quite right in my opinion to consider
the law in its general application and to declare as he did on the
question of its validity. 

 In
the final analysis the remaining question is of course whether there
was a valid dismissal. The dismissal could only be legal if the law
was constitutional. Lawrence was in my view entitled to the
declaration granted. 

 Accordingly,
for these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal, and affirm the
decision of Bishop J along with its consequential declarations. 
Lawrence should have his costs of this appeal. 

 Appeal
dismissed.

appellant demanded re-imbursement in the amount in which the cheque
was issued, but this demand was refused. In an action by the
appellant to recover damages judgment was given for the bank. On
appeal, 

 Held, allowing the appeal - 

 (1)
The alteration which was apparent on the face of the cheque was a
material alteration. 

 (2)
The mandate of the appellant, the drawer of the cheque, had not been
substantially carried out. 

 (3)
The bank was not a holder in due course and could not therefore avail
itself of the proviso to section 64(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act. 

 (4)
The appellant, who had not been able to show that he had suffered any
damage, was only entitled to nominal damages.

from a decision of Robotham J in the High Court, Antigua and Barbuda,
dismissing his claim against the Bank of Nova Scotia for damages in
negligence and for breach of duty. The facts are set out in the
judgment of Berridge JA.

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Berridge
JA delivered the judgment of the court. This is an appeal from a
decision of Robotham J dated 18th June 1980 in which judgment was
given for the respondent bank in respect of a claim by the appellant
alleging negligence and breach of duty in the sum of $6000 and
interest, together with costs. 

 The
brief facts of the case are that sometime in 1974 the appellant, an
architect by profession, engaged one Barbara Hill of Barbados,
herself an architect, to assist him in Antigua by doing specific
architectural work. Hill took up her assignment with the appellant
who gave her an advance of $6000 payable by cheque drawn on the St
John’s, Antigua, branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia for work already
done and to be done in the future. Shortly thereafter Hill returned
to Barbados following differences which arose between her and the
appellant and in respect of which there is litigation which is not
before the court. 

 The
cheque was dated 16th January 1974 and made payable to “Barbara
Hill”; but it was altered on the face of it by the addition of the
word “Associates” as payee, endorsed “Barbara Hill” and
deposited at the branch of the respondent bank at Worthing,
Christchurch, Barbados, on 23rd January 1974 to the credit of
“Barbara Hill Associates”. 

 On
January 29th 1974, the cheque was returned to the Antigua branch of
the bank who deducted $6000 from the appellant’s account and in due
course the cancelled cheque was forwarded to the appellant who, by
letter dated 7th May 1974, drew the bank’s attention to the
alteration and demanded re-imbursement on the grounds that (i) it was
negligent in not observing the alteration in which event it should
not have paid’ and (ii) it had not carried out his instructions. 
The bank refused to re-imburse the appellant and as a consequence
proceedings were instituted by the appellant. 

 The
grounds of appeal are that: (i) the trial judge gave no consideration
to the admission of the bank that the cheque was forged; (ii) the
trial judge was wrong in finding that the bank had substantially
carried out the appellant’s instructions; (iii) the trial judge
misdirected himself on the facts and was wrong in law; and (iv) the
decision could not be supported by the evidence and ought to be set
aside. 

 At
the outset counsel for the appellant submitted that the bank having,
in its defence, avoided the allegations in the statement of claim
that (i) the bank had neglected to carry out the instructions of the
appellant, and (ii) the cheque was forged and thus void, must be
deemed to have admitted them. Both these allegations bear on the
issue whether the alteration was material which, as counsel for the
bank contended, is a question of law and need not be pleaded (Rules
of the Supreme Court 1970 Order 18, rule 11 refers). 

 187 

 As
far as ground (i) is concerned, assuming (without deciding at this
stage) that the alteration was material there is no evidence of
fraudulent intent on the part of Barbara Hill in that she has made no
further claim on the appellant in respect of the amount stated on the
cheque. Indeed, had she decided to do so any such claim would have
been barred by statute. This ground of appeal must accordingly fail. 

 In
arguing the other grounds of appeal counsel submitted that the
alteration was a material alteration on the face of the instrument
which avoided it under section 64 of the Bills of Exchange Act
[Antigua and Barbuda] the provisions of which are similar to, if not
identical with, comparable legislation throughout the Commonwealth. 
Counsel further contended that (i) the mandate of the drawer of the
cheque was not substantially carried out, (ii) the alteration was
apparent, (iii) the bank was not a holder in due course, and (iv) the
damage suffered was the debiting of the appellant’s account with a
payment to someone other than the payee stated by the appellant. 

 It
is pertinent at this stage to set out the provisions of section 64 of
the Bills of Exchange Act which reads as follows: 




‘ (1)
Where a bill or acceptance is materially altered without the assent
of all parties liable on the bill the bill is avoided except as
against a party who has himself made, authorised, or assented to the
alteration, and subsequent indorsers. Provided that, where a bill
has been materially altered, but the alteration is not apparent and
the bill is in the hands of a holder in due course, such holder may
avail himself of the bill as if it had not been altered, and may
enforce payment of it according to its original tenor. 

 (2)
In particular the following alterations are material, namely, any
alteration of the date, the sum payable, the time of payment, the
place of payment, and where a bill has been accepted generally, the
addition of a place of payment without the acceptor’s assent.’ 




 In Vance v Lowther (1876) 1 Ex D 176 where an alteration related to the date of the
cheque, it was held that it was material and invalidated the cheque;
and that the circumstance that the plaintiff had not been guilty of
negligence in taking it was immaterial. At page 178 Pollock B said: 




‘ Any
material alteration of a bill or note invalidates it, and the
question is, what is the true principle on which the materiality must
be determined. The county court judge seems to have thought that it
was necessary to consider the surrounding circumstances in each case.
 In that I think he was wrong, and that we ought to look at the
question of materiality with reference to the contract itself, and
not with reference to the surrounding circumstances.’ 




 But
it would be unreasonable if the alteration to an earlier date
debarred the banker from debiting the customer, if paid after the
original date. 

 Similar
in a number of respects to the facts in the instant case are those 

 188 

 in Slingsby v District Bank Ltd [1931] All ER Rep 143 where words were inserted between the payee’s
name and the words “or order” and endorsed to conform with the
designation of the payee as altered. It was held that the cheque had
been materially altered within the body of section 64(1) of the Bills
of Exchange Act and therefore the cheque had been avoided. 

 The
materiality of the alteration being dependent upon its character and
effect, it necessarily follows that if the mandate of the customer
has been substantially complied with then the banker can charge the
customer, the alteration notwithstanding. Authority for the
foregoing is to be found in 2 Halsbury’s
Laws of England .
 (3rd Edn) page 205, paragraph 380. 

 I
am of the opinion that the cheque was materially altered without the
assent of the appellant. 

 To
constitute an apparent alteration within the meaning of the Bills of
Exchange Act it should be apparent upon inspection of the bill that
its text has undergone a change. The document itself must show that
some revision of the text has taken place and its appearance must be
consistent with the revision having occurred after completion or
issue, although it may also be consistent with the revision having
occurred before completion ( Automobile
Finance Co of Australia Ltd v Law (1933) 49 CLR 1 refers). 

 An
inspection of the cheque reveals that the alteration is obviously in
a different handwriting from that in which the rest of the document
was drawn and it should have been observed that it had undergone a
change. 

 In
regard to the difference between the rights of a “holder in due
course” and a “holder” I can do no better than quote from the
words of Denning LJ in Arab Bank Ltd v Ross [1952] 1 All ER 709 at page 717: 




‘ The
difference between the rights of a ‘holder in due course’ and
those of a ‘holder’ is that a holder in due course may get a
better title than the person from whom he took, whereas a holder gets
no better title. In this regard a person who takes a bill, which is
irregular on the face of it, is in the same position as a person who
takes a bill which is overdue. He is a holder, but not a holder in
due course. He does not receive the bill on its own intrinsic
credit. He takes it on the credit of the person who gives it to him:
cf Brown v Davies per Buller J, 3 Term Rep 82. He can sue in his own name but he takes it
subject to the defects of title of prior parties: see section 38 of
the Act of 1882.’ 




 In
the instant case the bank took the cheque which was irregular on the
face of it. The bank was not a holder in due course and cannot avail
itself of the proviso to section 64(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act. 

 On
the question of damages, the appellant’s claim is in contract. It
is a well-established principle that whenever a party proves a breach
of contract but no actual damage (as was contended by learned counsel
for the bank) he recovers as a rule nominal damages only. 

 In
the instant case the appellant claims that the damage suffered by him 

 189 

 is
the debiting of his bank account with an amount payable by cheque
drawn by him to “Barbara Hill” and not “Barbara Hill
Associaties”; but, as indicated earlier, the possibility of the
duplication of this payment is non-existent and I am unable to
perceive what damage the appellant has suffered on account of the
alteration of the cheque. 

 Accordingly
I have come to the conclusion that (i) the alteration of the cheque
was a material alteration; (ii) the mandate of the drawer was not
substantially carried out; (iii) the alteration was apparent on the
face of the cheque; (iv) the bank was not a holder in due course and
cannot therefore avail itself of the proviso to section 64 of the
Bills of Exchange Act; and (v) the appellant is entitled to recover
nominal damages only. 

 In
the circumstances, I would allow the appeal and vary the order of the
trial judge by entering judgment for the appellant in the sum of $5
nominal damages. 

 In
the particular circumstances of this case, I would order the bank to
pay to the appellant his taxed costs, both here and in the court
below. 

 Appeal

 Appeal 

 Appeal The US Naval Facility appealed to the Court of Appeal of the Eastern
Caribbean States from a decision of the Industrial Court, Antigua and
Barbuda, holding that the respondents, Edison Lewis and Clive
Ambrose, had been unfairly dismissed by the appellant. The facts are
set out in the judgment of Sir Neville Peterkin CJ. 

 C
Phillips QC (instructed by A W Archibald) for the appellant 

 A
Alexander (instructed by J Simon) for the respondents 

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Sir
Neville Peterkin CJ delivered the judgment of the court. This is an appeal from the
judgment of the Industrial Court making an order declaratory of the
rights of the respondents that each is entitled to be re-instated in
the position which he was occupying on the date of the termination of
his services, or a similar position, along with a concomitant order
that each is entitled to receive from the appellant such pay as he
would have received had his services not been terminated. 

 The
facts and circumstances are as follows. The appellant is a
sub-department of the US Navy. It occupies an area of land in
Antigua under 

 191 

 treaty
arrangements between the Government of the USA and the Government of
the United Kingdom (Antigua and Barbuda being the successor to this
arrangement). There is local legislation giving effect to this
treaty arrangement. It is the US Defence Area (Agreement) Act 1969,
No 7 of 1969 as amended by No 25 of 1969. Under this legislation an
area had been leased to the USA, and within that area the laws of the
USA apply. The area is under military regulations. 

 Among
the functions of the appellant is to provide various services for US
Navy personnel, such as restaurant and shopping facilities, at
reasonable prices. The appellant is managed and operated by military
personnel with the assistance of local civilian employees in such
areas as are permitted by military regulations and the needs of the
naval station. 

 The
respondents were employed as general clerk and service station
attendant respectively. Some time before the termination of their
services the appellant carried out a survey to examine the structure
and cost of the operation. At its conclusion it decided there was
need to make economies, one of which being the transfer of the
functions performed by the respondents to military personnel. The
respondents immediately reacted by contending that their dismissals
were unfair on the ground that the appellant should not use US Naval
personnel to do their jobs and they challenged the appellant’s
position that they were redundant. The point at issue, therefore, in
the Industrial Court was whether a redundancy situation existed at
the time of the termination of the employment of the respondents. 

 The
respondent Clive Ambrose was engaged in August 1977 as a janitor, but
was later (on 1st May 1978) transferred to work at the gas station as
a gas attendant. His employment was terminated on 28th October 1978.
 He was told in the letter terminating his employment that his duties
would be assumed by military personnel at the Navy Exchange, Antigua. 

 The
employee Edison Lewis began work on 3rd May 1977 as a general clerk. 
On 27th October 1978, he received a letter terminating his employment
in which he too was told that his duties would be assumed by the
military personnel at the Navy Exchange in Antigua, and would no
longer be required. Then, there is the evidence of Bruce Davio, the
appellant’s only witness. It should be allowed to speak for
itself: 




‘ From
my researches, I discovered that two employees were made redundant in
October 1978 and these were Lewis and Ambrose. 

 The
functions that Mr Lewis was performing are now being performed by a
military person. This same individual on occasion assists in pumping
gas, receiving retail merchandise, assisting in collecting money from
vending machines, helping in maintaining sanitary conditions on the
Navy Exchange base. This person also stands week-end duty manager
and so ensures that the employees are issued their charge funds to
operate. He also ensures that there is merchandise for sale in the
different areas open on week-ends.’ 




 192 

 In
short, the service station at the appellant is still in operation,
and the job of service station attendant is still performed by
someone. Further to this, in the case of Edison Lewis the court has
found that his services were not only necessary for the esse but also for the bene esse of the business, and that such tasks as he performed would have to
continue. The court, after a review of this evidence, concluded: 




‘ From
the evidence of these witnesses we have come to the very clear
conclusion that a redundancy situation did not exist when the
services of the [respondents] were terminated, because the tasks
which they were last engaged to perform did not cease to exist.’ 




 The
court then went on to declare: 




‘ ...
the [appellant] having failed to justify their dismissal on the
ground of redundancy, which was the ground on which it relied, we are
constrained to hold that the [respondents’] dismissal was unfair,
and we so declare.’ 




 From
this decision the appellant has appealed on the following grounds: 




‘ (1)
The Industrial Court is mistaken in confining the interpretation of
the word ‘redundancy’ to situations where the tasks the employee
was last employed to perform no longer exist at the time the services
were terminated. 

 (2)
The Industrial Court was wrong in not giving effect to and/or not
considering the effect of the evidence relating to the economic
situation of the business in its relationship to the question as to
whether or not there was a redundancy within the meaning of the
Antigua Labour Code 1975.’ 




 In
my view there was ample evidence from which the court could conclude
that the tasks which the respondents were last engaged to perform did
not cease to exist at the time their services were terminated; on the
contrary, they continue to exist and are still being performed. I
would accept its findings of fact. What falls to be considered by
this court is whether or not on the facts as found a redundancy
situation may be said to have existed at the time of the termination
of the employment of the respondents. The heart of the matter as I
see it lies in the true construction of the word “redundancy” as
set out in the Antigua Labour Code. It is defined in section C3 as
meaning: 




‘ a
situation in which, by virtue of a lack of customers’ orders,
retrenchment, the installation of labour-saving machinery, an
employer’s going out of business, a force majeure, or any other
reason, tasks which a person was last employed to perform no longer
exist.’ 




 In
adumbrating his argument counsel for the appellant referred the court
to United Kingdom legislation and cases which he stated were in 

 193 

 pari
materia .
 Among the cases referred to were: 

 Dixon
v Everden (1966) 1 ITR 248, Ewen
v Ambrose (1967) 2 ITR 200, Sutton
v Revlon [1973] IRLR 173, and Scarth v Economic Forestry Ltd [1973] IRC 322. 

 While
conceding that the definition of”redundancy” in the United
Kingdom was not the same as in the Antigua Labour Code, he urged that
every word in the section should be given some meaning in which case
the word “redundancy” would have the same meaning here as in the
United Kingdom. He referred the court to Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edn) page 36, and submitted that on a true interpretation of
the section it meant, “no longer any need for the person’s
services”. He argued that the instant case was one of retrenchment
and re-organisation, and that while the respondent Lewis’s work was
redistributed among others, in the case of the respondent Ambrose the
appellant had taken over the work in the interests of economy. 

 Counsel
for the respondents argued to the contrary. In propounding an
analysis of section C3 of the Antigua Labour Code he suggested that
the definition did two things from a point of view of syntax. First,
it delimited and prescribed the parameters of the concept of
redundancy, and secondly, it set out the grounds which were
permissible or the reasons which were available to an employer to
justify a redundancy. He argued that prima facie there was a
potential redundancy situation where the tasks no longer existed; but
if the tasks existed there would be no need to look at the series of
events which would transform the potential to the real. He contended
that the United Kingdom provision was totally different as there the
tasks can continue to exist in a redundancy situation. He finally
submitted that a pre-requisite to a redundancy situation in the
Antigua Labour Code is the non-existence of the tasks. I would
agree. 

 In
regard to the United Kingdom legislation and cases cited it is
manifest that they do not apply in this situation, and so are not of
any assistance. The legislation is different and, significantly in
the majority of cases cited, the worker actually contended for a
situation of redundancy as the protection afforded by the Act is
different. The United Kingdom worker is given the protection of
payment for redundancy. 

 But
the essence of the matter is the true construction of the word
“redundancy” as defined in the Antigua Labour Code. Counsel for
the respondents submitted that in interpreting the statute the court
performed a judicial function and not a legislative one, and that the
court should not add or take away anything except in the case of a casus omissus .
 Again, I would agree. Where it is unambiguous, as in the instant
case, the court’s duty is to give the words their natural and
ordinary meaning having regard to the context in which the words are
used. 

 Accordingly,
I would hold that a pre-requisite to a redundancy situation is the
non-existence of the tasks, and that the appellant in the 

 194 

 instant
matter has failed to overcome that hurdle. The court has made a
finding of fact to the contrary which ought to be accepted. 

 I
would also agree with the conclusion reached by the Industrial Court,
namely that the appellant having failed to justify the dismissal of
the respondents on the ground of redundancy, which was the ground on
which it relied, their dismissal was unfair. 

 I
accordingly affirm their decision, and dismiss this appeal with costs
to be taxed. 

 Appeal
dismissed.

Liquidated sum – Claim under insurance policy – Limitation Act,
Cap 7:02 [G], section 3 – Civil Law of Guyana Act, Cap 2:01 [G],

 Section
3 of the Limitation Act provides: “Every action and suit upon any
bill of exchange, promissory note, or other writing not relating to
lands or immovable property or the produce thereof, shall be brought
within six years next after the time at which the amount claimed in
respect of that bill, note, or other writing has become due”. 

 Section
13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act provides: “In every suit, action,
and cause having reference to questions of fire and life assurance
which are henceforth brought in the High Court, or in any other

 On
the true construction of section 3 of the Limitation Act, the
expression “other writing” does not fall to be construed ejusdem generis with the words “bill of exchange, promissory note” and includes a
claim for a liquidated sum claimed under an insurance policy. 
Moreover, ( per Crane C and Fung-A-Fatt JA) in view of the savings clause in section
13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act there is no conflict between that
section and section 3 of the Limitation Act.

 Appeal 

 Appeal Badri Prasad, the executor of the estate of Chandrauti Prasad
(deceased), appealed to the Court of Appeal of Guyana (civil appeal
68 of 1978) against the dismissal of his claim against the Demerara
Mutual Life Assurance Society for money due under insurance policies
on the death of the deceased. 

 Sir
Lionel Luckhoo SC and Miss Carolita Luckhoo for the appellant 

 J
A King SC for the company 

 Crane
C. Before considering the merits of this appeal, it will be necessary
to advert to an undesirable state of affairs which, in the interests
of justice, I can only hope will not occur again. It concerns the
unwillingness of the trial court to perform its duty by ruling on a
preliminary objection that had been fully argued before it. 

 In
limine ,
counsel for the defendant took the preliminary point that the action
was statute-barred and there was no jurisdiction to entertain it. 
After hearing arguments on both sides on the law, the judge recorded
the agreement of both parties that his “ruling should be postponed
until the conclusion of all the evidence”. At the conclusion of
all the evidence no ruling on the preliminary point was given save
that in his judgment the trial judge said: 




‘ Judgment
for the defendant is therefore entered with costs to be taxed. As I
have decided this case in favour of the defendant, I do not think it
necessary to rule on the preliminary objection raised by the
defendant and would defer my opinion for another occasion. As it is
a pure question of law in the event of an appeal, that distinguished
court can deliver its opinion.’ 




 While
there can generally be no harm in deferring a ruling on a 

 197 

 preliminary
objection until all the evidence in the case has been taken, it is
sometime better to dispose of it at the outset; but the matter is
always one for the discretion of the trial judge. However, we have
more than once in the past had occasion to advise against the
practice of encouraging points of law being raised for the first time
in this court. At all times in the interest of justice, it is most
desirable that we, particularly as we are a court of last resort,
should have the benefit of the views or other assistance of both
judge and counsel in the court below. In Jaipergas v Jaipergas (1974) 21 WIR 160 Luckhoo C held that it was counsel’s duty to take
and argue all available points of law in the Full Court so as to
enable the Court of Appeal to have the benefit of that court’s
views on those points. He said (at page 162): 




‘ This
court has on previous occasions said that it would not shut out
arguments on a matter of legal import which appears to be worthy of
consideration, but the exercise of this discretion does not mean that
counsel should be remiss in his duty to take and argue all available
points of law before the Full Court so as to enable this court to
have the benefit of that court’s views on such questions. I can
only hope that greater care would be taken in future to avoid legal
points being argued for the first time in this court in appeals from
the magistrate’s court.’ 




 Now
we have a slightly different but nonetheless analogous situation, in
that while in Jaipergas v Jaipergas the views of counsel were not ventilated in the court below, in the
present case it is the trial judge who has not spoken although
counsel’s views had been fully and ably ventilated. Luckhoo C in
the above passage, spoke of counsel being remiss in his duty. Now it
is the trial judge who is remiss in his duty to the Court of Appeal
and to the cause of justice. As a court of final instance we must be
informed to the fullest possible extent of all arguments of counsel
and of the trial judge’s opinion on all points of law, and nothing
will exonerate a trial judge from his task of pursuing diligently,
intellectually and intelligently all points of law that have been
argued before him with a view to giving his opinion and offering the
maximum possible assistance to the highest court in the land in the
cause of justice and the development of the law; even though the
judge might have been understandably unappreciative, as I certainly
am, of an insurance company’s attempt to take advantage of the
Statute of Limitation to avoid payment of a debt. The trial judge,
however, considered it was “not necessary” to rule on the
preliminary point, but that he should defer his opinion for another occasion, probably after the Court of Appeal will
have delivered its opinion on the point. But exactly what help that
approach can ever be to us, I am at a loss to know. I can only hope
we will not see or hear of such an approach in the future for it
certainly does not assist the progress of our hierarchical system of
justice, and does not savour of good adjudication. 

 Now
the preliminary point which we have been injudiciously left to 

 198 

 solve
all on our own arose in this way. During her lifetime Chandrauti
Prasad took out two life insurance policies with the defendant, the
Demerara Mutual Life Assurance Co Ltd (“the company”), a body
corporate incorporated by the laws of Guyana. The first policy dated
13th December 1967 (No 34356) was for $10,000, and the second (No
35009) for $15,000. Chandrauti died on 27th September 1971. The
preliminary point that was argued before the trial judge concerned
the question of the limitation of actions: whether in Guyana life
insurance policies are statute-barred after three years or six years
from the time when they become due and payable, which (according to
the first schedule to the policy) is “on the death of the life
assured ...” i e on 27th September 1971. 

 Following
on Chandrauti’s death her husband and executor, Badri Prasad (the
appellant), unsuccessfully sought to recover the insured sum of
$25,000 that had become due and payable. The company, however,
refused payment contending that Chandrauti had made materially untrue
statements of fact in her proposal forms in the following respects:
(i) that she had never in her life consulted a doctor for any disease
of the nervous system or stomach, nor had she consulted a doctor at
any time during the previous five years about her health (concerning
which full particulars had not been given); whereas in truth and in
fact she suffered from such symptoms; (ii) that she stated that she
did not use beer, wines nor spirits; when she did so to an immoderate
extent; and (iii) that she stated she had never suffered from
diabetes or been told that she had sugar in her urine; when in truth
and in fact she had been so told and was in fact treated for diabetes
by a government dispenser. 

 On
being unable to effect a settlement with the company, the appellant
issued his writ dated 11th April 1975, some three years and seven
months after Chandrauti’s death. Mr King, for the company,
contended, as he did before the trial judge, that the claim is
statute-barred and that the ejusdem generis rule of interpretation applied to exclude the life insurance policies
from the genus of bills of exchange and promissory notes in section 3 of the
Limitation Act and from the operation of that section, just as
hire-purchase agreements were once excluded from that genus and that section and relegated to section 6 of the Act in British Guiana Rice Marketing Board v Sukhai (1957) unreported. In the same way, counsel for the company relying
on Sukhai’s case now contends that the life policies should fall within the terms
of section 6 of the Limitation Act, i e within the period there
declared (three years next after the cause of action or suit has
arisen). Section 6 reads as follows: 




‘ Every
action and suit for any movable property, or upon any contract ,
bargain, or agreement relating to movable property, or to recover
money lent without written acknowledgement or upon any account or
book debt, or to recover any salary, or the value of any goods sold
and delivered, shall be brought within three years next after the
cause 

 199 

 of
action or suit has arisen.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 Counsel
for the appellant, on the other hand, contends that the action is
entirely within time because, when section 3 of the Act is read
together with section 13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act, it is clear
that a construction must be employed wider and apart from the ejusdem generis rule, so that the general words “or other writing has become due”
involving as they do a life insurance policy can be included within
section 3. Section 3 of the Limitation Act reads as follows: 




‘ Every
action and suit upon any bill of exchange, promissory note, or other
writing not relating to lands or immovable property or the produce
thereof, shall be brought within six years next after the time at
which the amount claimed in respect of that bill, note, or
other writing has become due. ’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 And
section 13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act is in the following words: 




‘ In
every suit, action and cause having reference to questions of fire
and life assurance which are henceforth brought in the High Court, or
in any other competent court of [Guyana], the law administered for
the time being by the High Court of Justice in England, so
far as that law is not repugnant to, or in conflict with any Act now
in force in [Guyana] ,
shall be the law to be administered by the High Court or other
competent court.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 The
contest in the present appeal is therefore concerned with the
question whether a document in the nature of a life insurance policy
properly falls within section 3 or section 6 of the Limitation Act,
in the same way as hire-purchase agreements were considered in British Guiana Rice Marketing Board v Sukhai (1957), When those sections were judicially considered by the High
Court. There, Date J employed the ejusdem generis rule of interpretation in relation to section 3 to exclude three
hire-purchase agreements from the genus of bills of exchange and promissory notes and, in so doing, came to
the conclusion that section 6 of the Limitation Act applied and not
section 3. So he thought that the hire-purchase agreements were
statute-barred since three years had elapsed from the time when the
cause of action on them had arisen. In reaching that conclusion the
judge reasoned thus: 




‘ It
was agreed that the sole question for determination by the court is
whether the instalments and balances of instalments which became due
on or before 11th September 1953 are statute-barred and that that
question in turn depends on whether this action falls to be governed
by section 3 or by section 6 of the Limitation Ordinance... In a
nutshell the plaintiff’s contention is that the words ‘or other
writing not relating to lands or immovable property or the produce or
usufruct thereof’ in section 3 of our Limitation Ordinance should
be given their wide general meaning and construed as comprehending
the hire-purchase agreements entered into between the parties; the 

 200 

 defendants,
on the other hand, say that the words should be construed ejusdem generis with the words ‘bill of exchange, promissory note’ which precede
them, thus limiting their meaning to other writings of the same type
or class as bills of exchange and promissory notes, postal orders,
British and foreign bonds, share warrants. In
my opinion, the latter contention is the correct one .
 Obviously, there is a common bond between the words ‘bill of
exchange’ and ‘promissory note’, they belong to the same genus ;
and the setting out of the particular instances before the general
word[s], must have been done with some object. It seems to me that
the only reason for their insertion in the section is to indicate the
type or class of writings contemplated by the general words. If it
was intended that the section should comprehend all writings other
than those relating to lands or immovable property or the produce or
usufruct thereof, there would have been no need to mention bills of
exchange or promissory notes. 

 I
can find nothing in the Ordinance read as a whole to justify the
non-application of the ejusdem generis rule of construction to section 3. 

 I
hold that this action falls to be governed by section 6 of the
Ordinance and not by section 3 and that the instalments and balances
of instalments under the hire-purchase agreements which became due
over three years ago are statute-barred.’ 




 The
approach of Date J was clear; he applied to the ejusdem generis rule the principle that “other” means “similar”. He did not
advert to section 5(1) of the now repealed Interpretation Ordinance
(see now section 5(1) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act)
which laid down that the expression “‘or’, ‘other’ and
‘otherwise’ shall be construed disjunctively and not as implying similarity, unless the expression ‘similar’
or some equivalent expression is added” ( emphasis
supplied ).
 And the question arises: was he justified in so doing? 

 It
is clear from the excerpt from his judgment that Date J never
considered that the general words “or other writing has become due”
were capable of a disjunctive and wider construction that would
support hire-purchase agreements under section 3, and that the ejusdem generis rule should only prima facie be applied to restrict general words to
the common characteristics of those in the genus .
 In the case of hire-purchase agreements, and so with life insurance
policies, neither is capable of falling within the genus of a bill of exchange or a promissory note since the common
characteristic of both the latter is negotiability .
 A negotiable instrument is one the transfer of which passes a good
title to a transferee who takes in good faith and for value, free
from any defects or equities affecting the title of the transferor. 
It follows that hire-purchase agreements and likewise life insurance
policies are not negotiable instruments, although the latter are
capable of assignment. However, there is a clear distinction between
negotiability and assignment. 

 The ejusdem generis rule is stated (see 36 Halsbury’s
Laws of England 

 201 

 (3rd
Edn), page 397, paragraph 599) to be that: 




‘ Where
in a statute there are general words following particular and
specific words, the general words must be confined to things of the
same kind as those specified, although this, as a rule of
construction, must be applied with caution, and subject to the
primary rule that statutes are to be construed in accordance with the
intention of Parliament. For the ejusdem generis rule to apply, the specific words must constitute a category, class
or genus ;
if they do, then the only things which belong to that category, class
or genus fall within the general words; for example, a superior thing will not
be held to be within a class of inferior things. If the particular
words exhaust a whole genus ,
the general words must be construed as referring to some larger genus .’ 




 Of
course the doctrine is by no means an absolute one, for if it can be
seen from a wider interpretation of the scope of the particular deed,
instrument or piece of legislation under consideration that the
general words ought, by necessary intendment, to be construed
generally, they must be so construed notwithstanding that they follow
more particular expressions. This was certainly the thinking of Lord
Esher MR in Anderson v Anderson [1895] 1 QB 749 at 753. After referring to the “modern tendency”
of the courts to construe general words in their ordinary sense, Lord
Esher MR went on to cite Church v Mundy (1808) 15 Ves 396 at 406, where Lord Eldon LC said that: 




‘ the
best rule of construction is that which takes the words to comprehend
a subject that falls within their usual sense, unless there is
something like declaration plain to the contrary’ 




 and
Lord Esher MR went on to say (at page 753): 




‘ As
I understand [Lord Eldon], prima facie you give the words their
larger meaning unless you find something which plainly shows that they were intended
to be read in a more restricted sense ... Nothing can well be plainer than to show that prima facie,
general words are to be taken in their larger sense, unless you can
find that in the particular case the true construction of the
instrument requires you to conclude that they are intended to be used
in a sense limited to things ejusdem generis with those which have been specifically mentioned before.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 It
seems to me it was in the pursuit of the “modern tendency”, of
which Lord Esher MR spoke above, that our legislature was motivated
to include in section 5(1) of our now repealed Interpretation
Ordinance 1891 the need to construe general words introduced by
“‘or’, ‘other’, or ‘otherwise’” prima facie as not
implying similarity ,
but widely and disjunctively .
 It is my respectful view, however, that the decision of Date J to
consider hire-purchase agreements as falling under section 6 (the
three-year period) instead of under section 3 (the six-year period)
in 

 202 

 Sukhai’s case (1957) was right. In 1957 when Sukhai’s case was decided by him, he could only have been justified in
applying section 5(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance to such
Ordinances as were passed after 15th July 1891 (the date of its commencement). (See the enacting
part of that section.) There was therefore no obligation for him to
consider the expression “or other writing has become due” in
section 3 of the Limitation Act prima facie as not implying
similarity and for him to construe it disjunctively in a Limitation
Act that was passed in 1856, that is to say, some 35 years before the Interpretation Ordinance came into force; although, if the judge
had to decide Sukhai’s case after the 23rd February 1970, he might have reached a contrary conclusion
on the application of section 3(1) and (2) of our new Interpretation
and General Clauses Act, which provides: 




‘ (1)
This Act shall not apply to the constitutional instruments and to
applied laws and, notwithstanding the definition of ‘written law’
and ‘Act’ in section 5, the expressions ‘written law’ and
‘Act’ in this Act shall not include the constitutional
instruments and applied laws. 

 (2)
Subject to subsection (1), this Act shall; unless it is otherwise
expressly provided, apply to this Act and to all written law whether
made before or after the coming into operation of this Act.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 It
is obvious that section 3(1) and (2) of the Interpretation and
General Clauses Act has changed the law since Date J decided Sukhai’s case to include retrospective consideration of statutes and, had he
been seised of that case today, his decision would in all probability
have gone the other way. The decision in Sukhai’s case is for the above reasons affirmed. 

 The
position is otherwise in the old case Lopes v Santos [1897] LRBG 39, which must be overruled. In that case a man named
D’Aguiar handed over to Santos, one of his creditors, certain
movable property to be sold for the benefit of Santos and other
creditors. The property was sold, and the proceeds were in the
possession of Santos. Lopes, another creditor, proceeded to judgment
against D’Aguiar and instructed the bailiff to levy on the money in
Santos’s possession. Section 44 of the Petty Debt Recovery
Ordinance 1893 provided: 




‘ Every
bailiff executing any process of execution issuing out of the court
against movable property of any person may also attach any ‘salary,
wages, or other sums of money due to such person’ .’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 (See
now section 44 of the Petty Debt Recovery Act.) 

 Without
assigning any reasons, Kirke acting J merely said autocratically in
his judgment that “the words ‘other sums of money’ mean sums of
money ejusdem generis with wages and salary, and are therefore not attachable under section
44”. I respectfully think, 

 203 

 however,
that Kirke J, unlike Date J, was wrong to have decided that the ejusdem generis rule applied in the teeth of section 5(1) of the Interpretation
Ordinance 1891, which was then in full force and effect. He appeared
to have overlooked section 5(1) and reasoned this way: 




‘ To
be attachable ‘other sums of money’ must be similar to those in the foregoing genus ;
and as the proceeds of sale of the movables are not of the identical
character of ‘salary or wages’, I will apply the rule to exclude
the proceeds of sale from attachment.’ 




 But
had he looked wider and beyond the ejusdem generis rule, he could not have failed to see that, in 1897, section 5(1) of
the Interpretation Ordinance 1891 was applicable to the Petty Debt
Recovery Ordinance 1893, because the latter was passed after 1891, and that a bailiff executing the process of execution is given
a wide mandate in section 44 in relation to the seizure of (a)
movable property; (b) monetary securities, salary, wages, or any
other liquidated sums due to the judgment-debtor. 

 Lopes
v Santos [1897] LRBG 39 and Sukhai’s case (1957) provide concrete examples of the idea I meant to convey
in my recent address to the Bar Association when I counselled the
citation of locally decided cases for approval or rejection, particularly at Court of
Appeal level. Here, local precedents will be considered and either
affirmed or disapproved; and in this way we will be able to build a
virile and reliable jurisprudence of which we, like the other
Commonwealth countries, can be proud. For the reason that we have
made use of local (with the assistance of foreign) materials, this
appeal must rank as one of the most important in recent times. 

 So,
merely because the proceeds of sale of D’Aguiar’s property were
not of the genus and of a similar common characteristic to salary or wages, the ejusdem generis rule was applied and the proceeds of sale were considered to be not
attachable. This approach, we have observed above, was the same
taken by Date J in Sukhai’s case (1957) where the word ‘other’ was read prima facie as
implying similarity and as excluding from the operation of the
section things not within the preceding genus .
 But the remarkable thing is that, whilst this approach was the right
one in Sukhai’s case, for the reasons already given, it was wrong in Lopes v Santos [1897] LRBG 39 because section 44 of the Petty Debt Recovery
Ordinance 1893 having been enacted (unlike the Limitation Act) after the Interpretation Ordinance 1891, a disjunctive construction was
compelling. Thus, Lopes was denied the benefit of a disjunctive and
wider construction of the general words to which the law decreed he
was prima facie entitled, and which would have enabled him to share
in the proceeds of D’Aguiar’s property that was sold for his
benefit and that of the other creditors. 

 In Quazi v Quazi [1979] 3 All ER 897 at 902, Lord Diplock counselled against the
“regrettable” habit of prima facie reading “ other ”
as if that word meant “ similar ”
when (at page 902) he spoke on the construction of a statute: “This
involves reading ‘ other ’
as if it meant ‘ similar ’”,
his 

 204 

 Lordship
said, “and, it seems to me, is based on a misunderstanding of that
well-known rule of construction that is regrettably common ”. 

 Now,
it being perfectly clear that the ejusdem generis rule does not apply to the matter in hand, it will now be considered
whether it was the intention of the legislature that writings like
hire-purchase agreements and life insurance policies should fall
within the six-year period of limitation in section 3 of the
Limitation Act 1856, On the plain wording of section 3 it appears to
me the “writing” spoken of must not relate either to lands or
immovable property or the produce thereof, such as amounts due for
emblements, crops or rents. The writing or document must be wholly
written or wholly printed or partly written and partly printed and
the amount for which a claim is made must have become due, i e must
be for a liquidated sum (such as may be claimed on a
specially-indorsed writ). 

 On
the other hand, it appears to me that section 6 will apply to any
oral or written contract in which unliquidated damages are claimed and in which there is some fact or thing yet to
be made clear in court either from documents or through the
examination of witnesses before the amount claimed can be said to
have become due and payable. In such a case, the law says the case
must be brought within three years next after the cause of action or suit has arisen. 

 Where,
however, the amount claimed is liquidated, i e it has become clear
because nothing remains to be done nor any fact remains to be
ascertained so as to render it due and payable, the action or suit
should be brought within six years next after the time at which the amount claimed in respect of
the writing has become due. All this is in keeping with the policy
of the law relating to the limitation of actions, and the season
behind it is that there should be an end to litigation as early as
possible. 

 But
where the amount claimed is unliquidated, litigants must bear in mind
the shorter period of three years and be speedier in asserting their
claims because of the inevitable effect of lapse of time on the
memory of witnesses. As William W Bishop Jr says in his International Law, Cases and Materials (3rd Edn), page 44: 




‘ Very
early it was perceived that with the lapse of time the defendant
through death of witnesses and destruction of vouchers [and I would
respectfully add through lapse of memory, as the evidence of the
witnesses Nurse Barry and Mohan Rai Singh so vividly shows] became
less able to meet demands against him, and the danger of consequent
injustice increased, while no hardship was imposed upon the claimant
in requiring him within a reasonable time to institute his suit. In
addition, another view found its expression with relation to the
matter in the maxim interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium .’ 




 Thus,
the rationale of the law is clearly discernible in cases where there
is an agreement in writing evidencing a certain and ascertainable
debt that has become due and payable (i e liquidated), and an
agreement, oral 

 205 

 or
in writing for an amount to be proved by witnesses (i e
unliquidated). On the above principle, the limitation period for the
bringing of suits for unliquidated damages must be shorter because of the policy of the law. The principle is that it is the
concern of the State that lawsuits be not protracted because the law
does not encourage litigation. Any action or suit under section 3
that has become due and payable will require comparatively few or
perhaps no other witness than he who produces the required writing. 
This should be compared with section 6, where several witnesses whose
memory may prove faulty through lapse of time will probably be
required to testify at an unliquidated action. It is suggested that
it is for the reason that the law is intent on quieting litigation
(as it does in cases of adverse possession of land) that it imposes
the shorter period of limitation where it is obvious that the
testimony of many witnesses might be required and prove faulty
through lapse of time in the action or suit. 

 It
appears to me that, on a wide construction of the general words under
consideration, any action or suit relating to a hire-purchase
agreement or life insurance policy, provided that the above-mentioned
conditions are fulfilled, can also be brought within the embrace of
section 3. In my view, they ought not peremptorily to be excluded
from the operation of that section only because the general words in
which they are contained are not similar or ejusdem generis with the foregoing genus .
 That general words are not capable of being read ejusdem generis with those in the foregoing genus ,
seems to me no valid reason for concluding they must necessarily be
excluded from the operation of section 3 in which they are contained,
and relegated to section 6, so long as on the true construction of
the whole instrument it is found to be the intention of the
legislature that they should be so included. It has been said that
the rule does not apply in Guyana because of what is said, about the
disjunctive construction to be given to the expression “‘or’,
‘other’ and ‘otherwise’ “ in section 5(1) of the
Interpretation and General Clauses Act; and some judges,
surprisingly, have taken this view. I, however, think that view is
wrong. But was it not this view Lord Diplock counselled against as a
“misunderstanding . . . that is regrettably common”? There is no
compulsion about it; if the general words, after having been
construed in their widest context, are shown to be similar in every
respect and related by common characteristics to those in the
preceding genus ,
the rule must apply so as to restrict those words to those bearing
common characteristics in the preceding genus .
 But even so, the intention of the legislature is the predominating
factor, and if it can be seen from a wider inspection of the scope of
the legislation that the general words ought to be construed
generally, they must be so construed, notwithstanding that they
follow more particular expressions. 

 Before
concluding this segment of the judgment, it is convenient here to
deal with an important submission by counsel for the company. 
Counsel contended that the disjunctive construction directed by law
to 

 206 

 be
given the expression “‘or’, ‘other’ or ‘otherwise’”
in section 5(1) of the repealed Interpretation Ordinance 1891, was prospective and not retrospective in operation because it was enacted that: 




‘ In
this Ordinance and in every Ordinance passed after the commencement of this Ordinance, and in every official document
made or executed after the commencement of this Ordinance, unless the contrary intention
appears, ‘or’, ‘other’ and ‘otherwise’ shall be construed disjunctively and not as implying similarity, unless the expression ‘similar’
or some equivalent expression is added.’ 




 Counsel’s
argument amounts to this. The decision in British Guiana Rice Marketing Board v Sukhai (1957) is good in law, notwithstanding that section 5(1) of the
Interpretation Ordinance 1891 was not considered by the trial judge. 
It was not considered because our then Limitation Ordinance was
enacted in 1856. Our then Interpretation Ordinance had only a
prospective application and there appeared no contrary intention in
the statute that would justify a disjunctive construction of section
3 of the Limitation Ordinance, and so give a wider interpretation
apart from the ejusdem generis rule. This is why I think that Date J was right in ruling as he did
in 1957 with respect to the hire-purchase agreements. However, today
(as we have seen) he would have been obliged to apply section 3(2) of
the new Interpretation and General Clauses Act 1970, which applies
“to all written law whether made before or after the coming into operation of this Act”. To my mind, this provision
would have made all the difference to Date J in Sukhai’s case since the Limitation Ordinance, section 3, would have been
caught. A disjunctive and wider constructive approach would have
been compelling on him, and the expression “or other writing has
become due” in section 3 aforesaid would assuredly have received a
different interpretation. 

 No
injustice has, however, been done by the new section 3(2) of the
Interpretation and General Clauses Act, simply because nobody has a
vested right in any course of procedure. He has only the right of
prosecution and of defence in the manner prescribed for the time being by or for the court in which he appears. And if any Act of
Parliament alters that mode of procedure (as section 5(1) of the
Interpretation and General Clauses Act has now done both
prospectively and retrospectively), he has no other right than to
proceed according to the altered mode (see Bata Shoe Co Guyana Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1976) 24 WIR 172, and per Mellish in Republic of Costa Rica v Erlanger (1876) 3 Ch D 62). 

 The
limitation of actions, as perceived in sections 3 and 6 of our
Limitation Act, is the procedural equivalent of the prescription of
rights. The former is the operation of time in severing the bond
between right and remedy; the latter is the operation of time in
destroying the right. The former leaves an imperfect right
subsisting; while the latter leaves no right at all. 

 There
is another aspect of this matter with which I find it necessary to
deal in view of Luckhoo SC’s contention that the limitation period 

 207 

 for
life insurance policies in Guyana is not six, but twelve years. His
argument, as I understand it, is based on the conjoint operation of
section 3 of the Limitation Act and section 13 of the Civil Law of
Guyana Act. It is contended that “the law administered for the
time being by the High Court of Justice in England” (section 13)
means exactly what it says: law of every description; not only the
common law of contract relating to life insurance, but also statute
law which will include the Limitation Act 1939 [UK], section 2 of
which, in so far as material, reads as follows: 




‘ Limitation
of actions of contract and tort, and certain other actions ... (3) An action upon a specialty shall not be brought after the expiration of twelve years from the date on which the cause of action accrued: Provided that
this subsection shall not affect any action for which a shorter
period of limitation is prescribed by any other provision of this
Act.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 Accordingly,
counsel for the appellant argued that inasmuch as both insurance
policies under consideration were under seal, they were specialties. 
They were, therefore, deeds and so must be governed by the Limitation
Act 1939 [UK], which provides a period of twelve years’ limitation
for such documents. We are, however, told that sealing is a device
which was adopted for the authentication of instruments in the days
when handwriting was a rare accomplishment. It was Bovill CJ who
reminded us in R v Morton (1873) LR 2 CCR 22 at 27 that “Many documents under seal are not
deeds; for instance, an award, though sealed”. Moreover, in
addition to being sealed, the document must have been delivered and
intended to be a deed. As Bovill CJ further said, “delivered as a
deed” meant as the act and deed of its maker. 

 In
view of section 13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act, the problem for
resolution appears to be this. In view of the acceptance of the law
of England that is administered by the High Court of Justice in
England in actions and suits having reference to questions of life
assurance in Guyana, what is the exact effect of section 13 of that
Act on section 3 of the Limitation Act? In view of the reception of
English law on life assurance law, can these two sections wholly or
in part stand together? In re Williams, Jones v Williams (1887) 36 Ch D 573 at 578, North J said: 




‘ The
provisions of an earlier Act may be revoked or abrogated in
particular cases by a subsequent Act, either from the express
language used being addressed to the particular point, or from
implication or inference from the language used.’ 




 The
condition for the reception of English law in actions and suits
having reference to questions of fire and life insurance is clear
enough; but what is the true position in view of the savings clause
in section 13: “so far as that law is not repugnant to, or in
conflict with any Act now in force in Guyana”? Now the point in
issue being the period of limitation of actions in respect of a life
policy of assurance, there is section 3 of our Limitation Act, which
(as we have seen) provides for 

 208 

 a
period of six years in the case where a specialty debt has become
due, whereas in contrast section 2(3) of the Limitation Act 1939 [UK]
provides for a period of twelve years from the time the cause of
action accrued. 

 The
question arises whether, in terms of section 13 of the Civil Law of
Guyana Act, there is any repugnance or conflict between section 2(3)
of the Limitation Act 1939 [UK] and section 3 of our Act, in relation
to the limitation period for specialty debts, when within the savings clause of section 13 it is plainly
stated there is to be no repugnancy or conflict between the received
and the local law (see above). 

 It
is trite that a later statute may repeal an earlier one either
expressly or by implication; but repeal by implication is not
favoured by the courts. If, therefore, an earlier statute like our
Limitation Act 1856 and the received Limitation Act 1939 [UK] in so
far as life insurance matters are concerned, can reasonably be
construed in such a way that both can be given effect to, the rule is
that this must be done. In Kutner v Phillips [1891] 2 QB 267 at 271, the court said: 




‘ Now
a repeal by implication is only effected when the provisions of a
later enactment are so inconsistent with or repugnant to the
provisions of an earlier one, that the two cannot stand together... 
Unless two Acts are so plainly repugnant to each other that effect
cannot be given to both at the same time, a repeal will not be
implied, and special Acts are not repealed by general Acts unless
there is some express reference to the previous legislation, or
unless there is a necessary inconsistency in the two Acts standing
together.’ 




 The
principle in Kutner v Phillips was considered and followed in The Danube II [1921] P 183. That was a case near to the exercise in which I am now
engaged. Section 1 of the Public Authorities Protection Act 1893
laid down a six months’ period of limitation for actions brought in
respect of things done in execution of an Act of Parliament or of any
public duty or authority. Under the Maritime Conventions Act 1911,
sections 8 and 9, no action is maintainable to enforce any claim
against a vessel or her owners, or any other person responsible for
the fault of the vessel, unless the proceedings are commenced within two years .
 In an action against an officer in charge of one of His Majesty’s
ships for damage by collision, it was held that the limitation period
of six months was applicable, and that the 1893 Act had not been pro tanto repealed. Lord Sterndale MR said: 




‘ There
may very well co-exist a general limitation of all actions in respect
of maritime damage to two years ,
and a further limitation where the action is brought against persons of a specific class to six months in the case of those persons.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 On
the above authorities, I think that section 3 of our Limitation Act,
referring as it does to “ all
other writing that has become due ”,
may well be regarded in the nature of a special enactment, for
besides bills of 

 209 

 exchange
and promissory notes, section 3 is inclusive of both specialty and simple contract debts in writing such as liquidated amounts due
on life insurance policies, hire-purchase agreements, etc. A bill of
exchange is included under the head of simple contract; it is not a
specialty; if any instrument is under seal it is not a bill of
exchange at all, unless the drawing of a bill of exchange under seal
is authorised by statute. It seems to me that section 3 is in direct
contrast to section 6 which speaks of actions and suits on “ any
contract ”,
which I construe to include both written and oral contracts, for any
movable property for unliquidated damages .
 For these reasons I think that section 3 of the Limitation Act must
be considered a special enactment and section 13 of the Civil Law of
Guyana Act a general enactment to which the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant is applicable. In view of the savings clause in section 13 there can
be no conflict between section 3 and section 13, and like Scrutton LJ
in The Danube II [1921] P 183, I can see no repugnance or conflict, nor any reason why
those two sections of the two laws cannot stand and be administered
together. 

 I
accordingly hold that life insurance policies are not statute-barred
until a period of six years elapses from the time the amount claimed
becomes due and payable, ie on the death of the assured, and so the
appellant being well within that time, I must now consider the case
on its merits. 

 Crane
C having reviewed the evidence in the case, concluded: In my
judgment, the defence have signally failed on all three points to
establish that the proposals contained materially untrue statements,
and the appeal must be allowed with costs here and below. 

 Fung-a-Fatt
JA. I concur. 

 George
CJ. I agree with the analysis and conclusion of Crane C as regards the
trial judge’s findings of fact and would have been contented to say
no more but for the general importance of the other ground of appeal
and the challenge which has been made to a previous decision of a
judge of the High Court on the very issue. I refer to the period of
limitation within which an action relating to a policy of insurance
should be brought. The solution to this problem would depend on the
proper construction to be placed on sections 3 and 6 of the
Limitation Act, which is a statute that provides for the periods of
limitation within which proceedings may be brought (other than in
respect of certain matters specified in section 15). The more
important of these exceptions are the title to immovable property,
mortgages and judgments. 

 The
facts which make a resolution of the issue of limitation crucial are
very simply stated. By two policies of insurance made between the
appellant’s wife, Chandrauti Prasad, and the insurance company on
13th September 1967 and 10th August 1968, the latter agreed to insure
her life in the sums of $10,000 and $15,000, respectively, upon the
terms and conditions specified in the policies (including the payment
of the agreed 

 210 

 premiums).
 The insured sums were payable to Chandrauti’s estate, or her
assigns, upon proof of her death. This occurred on 27th September
1971; but despite a notification to that effect accompanied by the
required proof the company failed to pay the sums stipulated. 
Accordingly, the deceased’s husband filed an action on 19th May
1973. For reasons which are not quite clear, that action was
discontinued and a new action dated 11th April 1975 instituted. It
is from the decision in this second action that the appellant has
appealed. 

 The
submission of counsel for the company is that, as the cause of action
arose on the death of Chandrauti on 27th September 1971, the action
filed in April 1975 was statute-barred. More particularly, he
submitted that the limitation period within which an action to
enforce an insurance policy agreement may be brought is governed by
section 6 of the Limitation Act. Under this section the period is
three years. Counsel for the appellant, on the other hand, contended
that the Act made no provision for any period of limitation in
respect of actions such as the present one. Accordingly, he argued
(by virtue of section 13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act) the
Limitation Act 1939 [UK], and more particularly section 2(3) which
provided for the limitation period for actions in respect of
specialty, would apply. Section 13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act
reads as follows: 




‘ In
every suit, action and cause having reference to questions of fire
and life assurance which are henceforth brought in the High Court or
in any other competent court in [Guyana], the law administered for
the time being by the High Court of Justice in England, so far as
that law is not repugnant to, or in conflict with any Act now in
force in [Guyana], shall be the law to be administered by the High
Court or other competent court.’ 




 In
support of this submission counsel noted that the company had affixed
its seal to the policies. This, he contended, made them specialty
contracts, notwithstanding the fact that the affixing of the seal was
done in pursuance of the provisions of the Demerara Mutual Life
Assurance Society Ordinance, under which the company was
incorporated. And, he went on, if the policies were specialty
contracts, then applying the provisions of section 2(3) of the 1939
Act, the period of limitation would be twelve years. 

 Even
assuming that the affixing of the seal makes the policy agreements
contracts of specialty, and that the words “the law administered
for the time being by the High Court of Justice in England” in
section 13 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act are wide enough to embrace
the general English law of limitation of actions, I am of the opinion
that that law is inapplicable as it would be repugnant to the
provisions of our Limitation Act. His alternative submission is
that, if the Act is applicable, the governing provision is section 3,
which provides for a limitation period of six years. It is to this
contention that I must now address my attention. 

 211 

 The
Limitation Act first became law as the Limitation Ordinance on 24th
September 1856 and, although it had been amended during 1952 and
1954, these amendments have not affected either section 3 or section
6. These sections read as follows: 




‘ 3.
 Every action and suit upon any bill of exchange, promissory note, or
other writing not relating to lands or immovable property or the
produce thereof, shall be brought within six years next after the
time at which the amount claimed in respect of that bill note or
other writing has become due... 

 6.
 Every action and suit for any movable property, or upon any
contract, bargain, or agreement relating to movable property, or to
recover money lent without written acknowledgement or upon any
account or book debt, or to recover any salary, or the value of any
goods sold or delivered, shall be brought within three years next
after the cause of action or suit has arisen.’ 




 Under
section 2 the word “writing” in the Act is interpreted to mean
“any document wholly written or wholly printed or partly written
and partly printed.” 

 As
regards section 3 it is the submission of counsel for the company
that the words “or other writing not relating to lands etc”
should not be construed as widely as to embrace all writings but as
being circumscribed by the words which precede them; viz “bill of
exchange” and “promissory note”. In other words his submission
is that the words “or other writing etc” should be construed ejusdem generis with the specific categories which precede them and should be limited
to writings which possess similar characteristics. If his contention
is right, section 3 would clearly not apply to an agreement such as
those under consideration. He then directed his attention to section
6, and in particular to the reference therein to “contract” and
“agreement relating to movable property”. The word “contract”
or “agreement”, he submitted, was wide enough to include a
contract or agreement of any kind whether oral or in writing, and
accordingly would include a policy of life insurance. Therefore he
submitted that the limitation period must be three years. 

 In
support of his contention counsel drew attention to the unreported
case of British Guiana Rice Marketing Board v Sukhai (1957), the ratio decidendi of which, he submitted, was applicable to the present case. In Sukhai’s case the issue for determination was the period of limitation within
which an action to enforce the provisions of a hire-purchase
agreement might be brought. This involved a consideration of section
3 and 6 of the Limitation Act; and, in holding that section 6
governed and that accordingly the period of limitation was three
years, Date J had this to say: 




‘ In
a nutshell the plaintiff’s contention is that the words ‘or other
writing not relating to lands or immovable property or the produce 

 212 

 or
usufruct thereof’ in section 3 of our Limitation Ordinance should
be given their wide general meaning and construed as comprehending
the hire-purchase agreements entered into between the parties; the
defendants, on the other hand, say that the words should be construed ejusdem generis with the words ‘bill of exchange, promissory note’ which precede
them, thus limiting their meaning to other writings of the same type
or class as bills of exchange and promissory notes, postal orders,
British and foreign bonds, share warrants. In my opinion, the latter
contention is the correct one. Obviously, there is a common bond,
between the words ‘bill of exchange’ and ‘promissory note’,
they belong to the same genus ;
and the setting out of the particular instances before the general
word[s], must have been done with some object. It seems to me that
the only reason for their insertion in the section is to indicate the
type or class of writing contemplated by the general words. If it
was intended that the section should comprehend all writings other
than those relating to lands or immovable property or the produce or
usufruct thereof, there would have been no need to mention bills of
exchange or promissory notes. 

 I
can find nothing in the Ordinance read as a whole to justify the
non-application of the ejusdem generis rule of construction to section 3. 

 I
hold that this action falls to be governed by section 6 of the
Ordinance and not section 3 ...’ 




 It
is clear from the above passage that the trial judge was of the view
that the ejusdem generis rule formed part of the law of Guyana. It should be noted, however,
it does not appear that his attention was directed to section 5(1) of
the Interpretation Ordinance which was then in force. The relevant
part of that section read as follows: 




‘ In
this Ordinance and in every Ordinance passed after the commencement of this Ordinance and in every official document made or executed after the
commencement of this Ordinance, unless the contrary intention appears
. . . ‘or’, ‘other’ and ‘otherwise’ shall be construed
disjunctively and not as implying similarity, unless the expression
‘similar’ or some equivalent is added.’ 




 However,
in view of the fact that the Ordinance was passed in July 1891 and
the Limitation Ordinance in 1856, it is doubtful whether it would
have made any difference to the decision, had the former been brought
to the trial judge’s attention. Be that as it may, on 23rd
February 1970 the Interpretation Ordinance was repealed; but several
of its provisions were re-enacted by the Interpretation and General
Clauses Act. Section 5(1) was one of the provisions which was
re-enacted, but in a modified form. The words in the opening part of
the repealed provision beginning from “In this Ordinance” and
ending with “appears” were omitted; and in their place were
substituted the words “In any law and in any public document”. 
However, in order to avoid 

 213 

 the
possibility of any absurdity in construction which might have arisen
if words as defined in the subsection were construed in every
instance in accordance with their several meanings in the new
subsection, section 4(1) was introduced. The effect of section 4(1)
is to make the defined words in section 5(1) applicable in the
construction of a statute or public document provided that “the
contrary intention did not appear”. In the result the only real
change which has been effected to section 5(1) by the new Act is to
remove, as from the date of its enactment, any difference in the
construction of statutes which had been passed before 1st July 1891. 
But if this change results in any contraction in the period within
which a claim for damages may be brought, the party affected cannot
be heard to complain, for as has been observed by Jackson J in Credit Corporation v Deen [1965] LRBG 249 at 255: 




‘ No
such right [i e a vested right] has been assailed or prejudicially
affected by the Limitation Ordinance, nor is there a semblance of the
imposition of any penalty, new duty or obligation. The enquiry as to
whether the defendant is or is not afforded the advantage of the fact
that the plaintiff slept on his rights for six years is not one which
is involved in the substance of the contract for that is not an
interest in the contract but something de hors the contract. No vested or substantive right of the borrower is
interfered with... All the [Act] does is incidentally to deprive
the defendant of the chance to escape from enforcement by the
plaintiff of his legitimate claim in court.’ 




 Accordingly,
as the deceased died after the new interpretation statute came into
force, the construction to be given to the Limitation Act, and more
particularly to section 3, for the purposes of determining the
meanings of the general words used must be governed by it. However,
before I assay an analysis of the effect, if any, of section 5(1) of
the new Interpretation Act on the meaning to be given to the general
words in section 3 of the Limitation Act, I propose to take a fresh
look at the validity of the submission that the trial judge in British Guiana Rice Marketing Board v Sukhai (1957) was in error in construing the general words in the latter
provision as being ejusdem generis with the words “bill of exchange” and “promissory note”. 

 But
prior to embarking upon this examination it may be apposite to note
that in Guyana there are two statutes of general application which
seek to prescribe the time within which civil actions may be brought
to vindicate a right. These are the Limitation Act and the Title to
Land (Prescription&amp;Limitation) Act. The former is concerned
with actions to enforce rights to movable property including choses
in action and the latter to enforce rights to title of immovable
property, including servitudes. Together they seem to have been
intended to encompass most, if not the whole range of, actions which
may from time to time engage the attention of the courts. Succinctly
stated their purpose and intent is to discourage, indeed to put quietus to stale claims. And the reason must be obvious. The longer the
delay in vindicating what is 

 214 

 perceived
to be a right, the greater is the likelihood that the evidence
proferred would be unsatisfactory, and this, in turn, must
necessarily adversely affect the quality of justice to the
disputants. In 24 Halsbury’s
Laws of England (3rd Edn), page 181, three reasons have been given for the enactment
of such statutes. These are: (i) that long dormant claims have more
cruelty in them; (ii) that a defendant might have lost the evidence
to disprove a stale claim; and (iii) that persons with good causes of
action should pursue them with reasonable diligence. And it is with
this perception of their scope and underlying purpose that I now turn
to a consideration of sections 3 and 6 of the Limitation Act, and
more especially the applicability of the ejusdem generis rule in the construction of the former provision. 

 In Quazi v Quazi [1979] 3 All ER 897, one of the principal issues was whether the
words “or other proceedings” must be read ejusdem generis with the word “judicial” which preceded it in section 2 of the
Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations Act 1971. Lord Diplock
explained the rule in the following words (at page 902): 




‘ The
argument of the wife is that these words, which on the face of them
include any proceedings that were not judicial are to be read as
limited to proceedings that are quasi-judicial, by application of the ejusdem generis rule. This involves reading ‘other’ as if it meant similar and,
as it seems to me, is based on a misunderstanding of that well-known
rule of construction that is regrettably common. As the later words
of the label attached to it suggest, the rule applies to cut down the
generality of the expression ‘other’ only when it is preceded by
a list of two or more expressions having more specific meanings and
sharing some common characteristics from which it is possible to
recognise them as being species belonging to a single genus and to identify what the essential characteristics of that genus are. The presumption then is that the draughtsman’s mind was
directed only to that genus and that he did not, by his addition of the word ‘other’ to the
list, intend to go beyond its boundaries, but merely to bring within
the ambit of the enacting words those species which complete the
genus but have been omitted from the preceding list either
inadvertently or in the interests of brevity.’ 




 And
in the earlier case Skinner&amp;Co v Shew&amp;Co [1893] 1 Ch 413 at 424 Bowen LJ expressed his understanding of the ejusdem generis rule thus: 




‘ There
is no doubt of the existence of the rule of ejusdem generis ,
and it cannot be denied that general words ought to be construed with
reference to the words which are immediately around them. But there
is an exception to that rule (if it be a rule and not a maxim of
common sense), which is that although the words immediately around
and before the general words are words which are prima facie confined, yet if you can see from a wider inspection of the scope of
the legislation 

 215 

 that
the general words, notwithstanding that they follow particular words,
are nevertheless to be construed generally, you must give effect to
the intention of the legislation as gathered from the entire
section.’ 




 In
the present case it is clear that the expressions “bill of
exchange” and “promissory note” possess similar characteristics
and, had the general words which follow them been merely “other
writings” without more, the force of the inference that it was the
intention that they should be circumscribed to writings of the same genus would have been almost irresistible. In fact, however, the words
used are “[any] writing not relating to lands or the produce
thereof”, and the question to be resolved, is whether this
notwithstanding, the intention and purpose of the section as
expressed, was to limit the writings to those possessing similar
characteristics as the specific words. In order to determine this
question, it would be useful to examine more closely the nature of a
bill of exchange and a promissory note. 

 In
section 3 of the Bills of Exchange Act, a “bill of exchange” is
defined as an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person
to another, by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it
is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future
time a sum certain in money or to the order of a specified person or
bearer. And in Byles on Bills of Exchange (24th Edn), page 3, a bill of exchange is described as an instrument
or document by means of which a series of debts may be discharged
without the use of cash, or payment may be postponed by the granting
of credit. “A promissory note” is defined in section 85 of the
Act as: 




‘ an
unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another signed
by the maker engaging to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable
future time a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified
person or to bearer.’ 




 From
the above definitions it is clear that the common characteristic of
both documents is that they are concerned with the unconditional
payment of money, a requirement which is not a necessary attribute of
other enforceable writings not relating to other immovable property. 
Accordingly, when the draughtsman of section 3 of the Limitation Act
went on to describe the other writings so as to encompass all
documents other than those relating to immovable property and
interests therein, I do not think that it was the intention that they
should be construed ejusdem generis with a bill of exchange or a promissory note. In my opinion the
words were intended to refer to a category of document other than a
bill of exchange or promissory note. But the analysis of the section
does not end here, for there are certain other words which are of
critical importance. There are “the time at which the amount claimed in respect of that bill, note, or other writing has become due .”
The crucial 

 216 

 words
are “amount claimed ... has become due”. In my opinion these
words can only refer to a sum certain payable under the writing. 
Such an amount cannot therefore be construed to include an
unliquidated sum which by definition is a sum at large and not one
determined or determinable at the time of the action. Accordingly, I
hold the view that the “writing” to which section 3 refers,
although not ejusdem generis with the preceding words must nonetheless be limited to writings in
respect of which a liquidated sum can be claimed. And moneys due
under a policy of insurance is such a claim. 

 But
how would this construction affect the provisions of section 6 of the
Act, which provides for a limitation period of three years within
which any action or suit may be brought upon, inter alia, a contract,
bargain, or agreement relating to movable property? In attempting a
resolution of this question, it is necessary to examine the two
sections together. As with all other provisions of the Act, the
categories of actions in both sections 3 and 6 relate to “movable
property”. Indeed in section 6 this actual expression appears
twice. The definition of “movable property” in the section is to
be found in section 2 of the Civil Law of Guyana Act. It is there
provided that, unless the context otherwise determines, these words
are ordinarily “to mean and include personal property, inclusive of
choses in action but exclusive of chattels real, as understood by the
common law of England”. This definition is clearly ample enough to
include both promissory notes and bills of exchange, as indeed any
other writings which may be the subject-matter of an action. 

 In
other words, the two provisions would seem to overlap each other. 
The resulting untenable consequences can only be averted by limiting
the categories of “movable property” or agreements or bargains
relating thereto in section 6 to those not specifically provided for
in section 3, i e those for which a liquidated amount could not be
claimed. The result would be that the longer period of limitation
would govern actions relating to written agreements, choses in action
and other writings in respect of which a fixed sum can be claimed,
whilst the shorter period would govern actions (whether or not based
on any writing) in which the claim is for an unliquidated sum. It is
with these latter that section 6 is concerned. It is, therefore,
with much regret that I find myself unable to follow the decision of British Guiana Rice Marketing Board v Sukhai (1957) unreported. 

 I
now turn to examine what effect, if any, the meaning given to “or”
or “other” in section 5(1) of the Interpretation and General
Clauses Act would have on the above analysis. As I have already
noted, the combined effect of sections 4(1) and 5(1) of the Act is
that those expressions which are defined in the latter subsection
would ordinarily bear the meaning ascribed to them unless the context
in which they are used otherwise determines. More specifically, as
regards the meaning of the words “or”, “other” or “otherwise”
prima facie they exclude the application of the ejusdem generis rule and, when used, they are not to be construed 

 217 

 as
being of the same genus as specific words which precede them, unless the expression “similar”
or some equivalent expression is used, or unless the context so
determines or requires (see Attorney-General of Palestine v Fakhry Ayyas [1947] AC 332). I can find no compelling reasons to construe the
omnibus words in section 3 as being ejusdem generis with the specific words which precede them. Accordingly, it is my
opinion that the new Interpretation and General Clauses Act has not
in any way affected the interpretation of section 3 of the Limitation
Act.

 Criminal
law – Appeal – Court of Appeal – Jurisdiction – Indictable

 (Luckhoo
JA dissenting) On its true construction, section 2 of the Criminal
Law Act 1980 (apart from its provisos) merely excludes the
application of sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Administration of
Justice Act 1978 from the law relating to hybrid offences in so far
as a defendant’s liability to punishment on summary conviction on a
summarily-laid charge is concerned. Moreover, before 1978 a
prosecutor had no right to request a magistrate to deal summarily
with an indictably-laid hybrid charge; and section 2 of the Act of
1980 did not alter this position. 

 Kwame
Apata v Roberts (No 1) 29 WIR 69 explained. 

 (Luckhoo
JA dissenting) Where an indictable offence, or a hybrid offence which
had been laid on indictment, has been tried summarily, appeal lies to
the Court of Appeal under section 7 of the Administration of Justice
Act 1978 rather than to the Full Court. 

 Per Crane C and Fung-a-Fatt JA. On a charge under section 23(1) of the
National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, e g of possession
of a firearm without lawful authority, the prosecution was not called
upon to show that there was any peril to public order or public
safety.

 Motion 

 Motion Kwame Apata, the applicant, applied to the Guyana Court of Appeal
(criminal appeals 40 and 41 of 1980), for leave to extend the time in
which to file and serve notice of appeal against his conviction for
the possession of a firearm and ammunition without lawful authority,
contrary to the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,
section 23(1), by a magistrate, Mr Oslen Small. His conviction
followed the remission of the case to another magistrate by the
Guyana Court of Appeal in Kwame Apata v Roberts (No 1) (1980) 29 WIR 69.

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Crane
C. The cases out of which these two applications arose for an extension
of time within which to file and serve notices of appeal are not new
to us. It will be recalled that on 26th February 1980, this court
allowed the appeals of the applicant from convictions and sentences
in the East Demerara magistrate’s court on two indictable charges
under section 23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act, and remitted them to be heard de novo by another magistrate ( Kwame
Apata v Roberts (No 1) (1980) 29 WIR 69). These consolidated appeal cases for convenience
may be called “ Apata
No 1 ”.
 One of those two charges concerned the possession of a firearm
without lawful authority; the other possession of six bullets without
lawful authority. After their remission they were consolidated,
heard together by consent, and the applicant was again convicted and
sentenced on both of them. 

 The
present applications are brought from the magistrate’s decision on
the remission; they may also for convenience be referred to as “ Apata
No 2 ”,
and they occurred in this way. As indicated on the remit for
retrial, the applicant was convicted on the self-same charges for a
second time, but he did not appeal directly to this court as he had
done in Apata No 1 .
 The rubric of the proceedings shows that the jurisdiction of the
Full Court of the High Court was invoked and in his affidavit it is
alleged that he and his counsel appeared and claimed that they had
wrongly done so through the fault of a clerk who in error typed “In
the full court” for “In the court of appeal”. The applicant
therefore asked leave to 

 220 

 withdraw
the proceedings before that court so that he might proceed afresh in
this court on a motion for an extension of time to do so. In his
affidavit in support, he alleges that the Full Court disclaimed
jurisdiction to entertain appeals from the convictions following on
the remit, gave him leave to withdraw them and affirmed the
convictions and sentences. 

 In
the course of the argument Luckhoo JA expressed a doubt and very
prudently inquired of both parties whether in fact this court had
jurisdiction to entertain these applications in view of the
provisions of the Criminal Law Act 1980, which became law on 1st
April 1980, during the time when the magistrate was adjudicating on
the remit. This was the occasion for Mr Jackman, the deputy Director
of Public Prosecutions, for the respondent, strenuously to assert
that he was not taking any point of jurisdiction in this court to
entertain the applications; in fact he considered that we had
jurisdiction to do so; and, speaking for myself, I then and there
agreed with him. Whereupon the court, with the concurrence of
Fung-a-Fatt JA, proceeded to hear the merits of the two applications
and granted counsel for the applicant permission to argue what he
termed his sole ground of appeal, that. 




‘ All
the constituent elements of the offence charged were not proved in
that there was no proof that the alleged possession by the
[applicant] of a firearm and ammunition occurred in circumstances
where it affected the national security of the State as required by
the Act.’ 




 Before
dealing with this point, I will refer to the one taken by Luckhoo JA
in the course of the argument, viz that we were without jurisdiction
to entertain this matter in view of the provisions of section 2 of
the Criminal Law Act 1980. I have already indicated that our
jurisdiction to hear these applications was raised by neither
contestant, but by a member of the Bench instead. However, there is
nothing strange about this. I have always understood the question of
the want of jurisdiction in a court to deal with any matter before it
is so fundamental that anyone concerned in the conduct of the case
can properly take the point that there is a want of it, irrespective
of whether he be litigant, counsel or judge. And here I think that
the following dictum of Richards CJ in Dhajoo v Thom [1939] LRBG 262 would amply support the course taken by Luckhoo JA: 




‘ It
is the first duty of every court whether of first instance, or
on appeal ,
before adjudicating upon any given cause or matter, to satisfy itself
on its jurisdiction and if the court is of opinion that it does not
possess jurisdiction, in whatever manner any given matter may be
brought before it, it
is the duty of the court, whether the question of jurisdiction is the
subject of formal appeal or not, of its own motion to pronounce
accordingly. ’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 I
think that the point of our jurisdiction to entertain these
applications is of the utmost importance. It must necessarily be
settled once and for all in view of the dilemma in which the
profession is caught since the 

 221 

 passing
of the Criminal Law Act 1980. In order to make doubly sure that they
have invoked the jurisdiction of the right forum, lawyers are now
filing appeals from magisterial decisions both in the Full Court of
the High Court and in the Guyana Court of Appeal. That, however,
will not do; we must find the correct answer to their problem. 

 In
demonstrating that the Guyana Court of Appeal is possessed of
jurisdiction to entertain these applications for an extension of time
and that we are justified in proceeding in the same way as we did in
the Apata No 1 appeal (1980) 29 WIR 69, I think that our starting-point must
necessarily be section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1980, which provides
as follows: 




‘ Nothing
in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Administration of Justice Act 1978
shall be deemed to affect or ever to have affected any law (whether
enacted before or after the enactment of this Act) providing for the
punishment of any person on summary conviction of any offence in
respect of which that person could under that law, be liable to
punishment either on summary conviction or on conviction on
indictment or which provided for the prosecution, trial, conviction
or sentencing of any person charged summarily under any such law or
for any appeal in respect of any charge brought summarily as
aforesaid: 

 Provided
that in the case of any proceedings (including any appeal
proceedings) pending before any court immediately before the date of
the enactment of this Act in respect of any charge brought summarily
as aforesaid, the court, on application of any party, may, without
prejudice to any other powers which it has, take any steps, including
allowing any party to call or recall any witnesses, or hearing fresh
arguments, or granting any adjournment or discontinuing the hearing
and ordering a new trial, if in the opinion of the court it is
necessary by reason of the application of this section to the case to
do so in order to ensure a fair hearing, and, if in its opinion a
fair hearing cannot in all the circumstances of the case be ensured
by taking any such steps, dismiss the case; 

 And
provided further that the punishment of any person on summary
conviction as aforesaid of any offence committed between 2nd November
1978 and the date of the enactment of this Act shall not exceed the
most severe penalty which could have been imposed on him if the
offence had been dealt with as an indictable offence triable
summarily under the provisions of section 61 of the Summary
Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act.’ 




 Section
7(1) of the Act of 1978 is also of importance. It reads as follows: 




‘ Anything
in the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act to the contrary
notwithstanding, any appeal from any decision given by a magistrate
after the coming into operation of this Part in respect of an
indictable 

 222 

 offence
dealt with summarily shall lie to the Court of Appeal.’ 




 It
is obvious that section 2 of the above-mentioned Act (hereinafter
called “the Act of 1980”), referring as it does to sections 4, 5,
6 and 7 of the Administration of Justice Act 1978 (“the Act of
1978”), must be read in conjunction with those sections. As its
long title indicates, the Act of 1980 is: “An Act to clarify the procedure relating to summary trial in indictable
offences and to provide for certain other matters relating to the criminal
law” ( emphasis
supplied ). 

 Now,
in view of the fact that the Act of 1980 was passed during the
hearing of the remit to the magistrate’s court, I think that it
would be appropriate to adopt the historical method of construction,
just as I did in the appeal case, Bata
Shoe Co v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1976) 24 WIR 172. According to this method it is necessary to
consider how the law stood when the Criminal Law Act 1980 was passed,
what was the mischief for which the Administration of Justice Act
1978 did not provide a remedy, and the remedy provided 1980 to cure
that mischief. 

 There
can be no doubt that the Act of 1980 was passed as a result of the
decision of this court in Apata No 1 (1980) 29 WIR 69, in which we unanimously held (a) that all hybrid
offences were indictable in nature; and (b) that, after 2nd November
1978 (when the Act of 1978 came into force), all
hybrid offences ,
by virtue of being indictable, were caught by the terms of the
remodelled section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act. 
As I have observed from the long title, the Act of 1980 was to make
clear the procedure in respect of the summary trial of indictable
offences; and this procedural question was considered in the judgment
in Apata No 1 .
 It was the legislature’s desire to clarify the effect of the
judgment in Apata No 1 that inspired the enactment of the act of 1980 after the Guyana Court
of Appeal had declared in that judgment (29 WIR at page 82): 




‘ The
right to consent to summary trial, which he formerly had when the
prosecutor initiated the matter, no longer exists, nor does the
prosecutor’s right of initiating summary trial in the case of a
so-called ‘hybrid offence’. That too has gone.’ 




 Initiating
summary trial means, of course, preferring a charge for summary
conviction. It is quite clear that section 2 of the Act of 1980 is
drafted in the nature of a typical savings clause (see Legislative Drafting and Forms (4th Edn) page 476, by Sir A Russell KC). 

 As
I see it, what the legislature has endeavoured to save from the
operation of sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act of 1978 is the liability of a defendant to punishment on summary conviction on a summarily-laid charge for a hybrid offence which the Court of
Appeal in Apata No 1 had declared to have been abrogated (see the quotation immediately
above, and the expression “any law ... providing for the punishment of any person on summary conviction of any offence ...” in the
enacting part 

 223 

 of
section 2 of the Act of 1980). And the idea behind it all is the
intention that, whilst the law relating to hybrid offences is to
continue in full force and effect, nothing said in sections 4, 5, 6
and 7 of the Act of 1978 must be considered ever to have affected
hybrid law (whether enacted before or after 2nd November 1978), in so
far as a defendant’s liability to punishment on summary conviction on a summarily-laid
charge is concerned. 

 One
of the most telling criticisms of the language of the law is that it
habitually wraps its meaning in a mist of unnecessary jargon. This
obscures the matter so far as the man in the street is concerned and
irritates him. Of course, some legal concepts are not capable of
being communicated briefly without the use of lawyers’ jargon, but
this is quite a different matter. The jargon to which the critic
justifiably objects is the result of unnecessary deviation from words
in general use to words commonly used only by the legal profession. 
Perhaps it might have been easier from the lawyers’ standpoint, but
certainly more difficult for the layman, had the draftsman resorted
to the use of the term “hybrid offence” in order briefly to
describe the expression “any law” in section 2 of the Act of
1980. But the draftsman had obviously been at pains to avoid the use
of lawyers’ jargon judging from his description of “any law” by
the circumlocutory use of the words “in respect of which ... on
indictment” in the enacting part of section 2 of the Act of 1980. 

 When
one reads section 2 up to the word “offence”, all that can be
gathered at that stage about the nature of the law which the
legislature seeks to save is that it is a law providing for
punishment on summary conviction. But, as it seems to me, the words
immediately following “offence” give the clue to the particular
kind of law providing punishment on summary conviction that is intended. I am referring to the words
“in respect of which ... on indictment”. In my judgment these
latter words are merely descriptive of what is commonly called a
hybrid offence; they show beyond peradventure that punishment on proceedings for summary conviction in relation to that offence was
what the legislature sought to save. Those decriptive words do not
refer to, and are not intended to affect the pre-1978 manner of
proceeding in respect of hybrid charges laid indictably. 

 And
the Act of 1980 provides, further, that nothing in sections 4, 5, 6
and 7 should be deemed ever to have affected the procedure relating
to the prosecution, trial, conviction or sentencing with respect to
summarily-laid charges; and, finally, that nothing in sections 4, 5,
6 and 7 must be deemed ever to have affected the procedure relating
to appeals on such summarily-laid charges. 

“ Deem”
is a useful word to establish a legal fiction, either positively by
“deeming” something to be something that it is not, or negatively
by “deeming” something not to be something which it is. In my
judgment, the intention of the legislature was plainly to keep intact
the provisions of sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act of 1978 in
relation to all indictably-laid charges (including hybrid indictables), but at the
same time to save only summary-conviction charges of the
hybrid-offence 

 224 

 type
from the operation of those sections. But the legislature has
certainly evinced no intention of saving any pre-1978 practice, if
indeed such existed, whereby a prosecutor could have preferred hybrid
indictably-laid charges and applied to have them dealt with summarily. The truth is, there was never any pre-1978
right in a prosecutor to request a magistrate to deal summarily with
an indictably-laid hybrid charge; and I say without fear of
contradiction that if such a practice ever existed there was no
warrant for it. What is said to the contrary in this regard in one
passage in the leading judgment in Apata No 1 (1980) 29 WIR 69, with reference to section 12(1)( b )
of the Prevention of Crimes Act, must be disregarded. It is clearly
not in unison with other relevant passages in the same judgment. If
a prosecutor before 1978 was desirous of having a summary charge proceeded with when what
was before the court was an indictably-laid charge for a hybrid
offence, the proper course for him to follow was, on the withdrawal
of the indictable charge, to introduce a summary one leading to
summary conviction. This is so because the law provides for a
summary-conviction charge to be laid in the case of every hybrid
offence. 

 The
laying of a summary charge, if summary trial is requested, is of
importance for the reason that the defendant had to plead to the
summary charge; and if he pleaded guilty (or was found guilty)
sentence would have had to be imposed under the summary arm of the
hybrid offence. Before 1978, if the hybrid indictable charge were
not withdrawn and the defendant were to be dealt with summarily at
the prosecutor’s request, that course would have been, in effect,
to apply the repealed section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction
(Procedure) Act to a hybrid offence, a procedure for which there was
no warrant and I would here correct, as indicated, anything said to
the contrary in Apata No 1 . 

 But
the substituted section 61(2) of the Act of 1978 can, I think, afford
some assistance to the matter by way of analogy since it shows that
an indictable charge must be withdrawn and a summary one instituted. 
From that section, it will be seen that the court can, when hearing
an indictable charge, deal with the case summarily if it is expedient
to do so after hearing representations from the prosecutor and the
accused. The court will then cause the summary charge to be reduced
into writing (if that has not already been done), read it to the
defendant and ask him to plead to it. 

 There
are two provisos to section 2 of the Act of 1980. The first deals
with the procedure in proceedings relating to summarily-laid charges pending before the court immediately before the enactment of the Act
of 1980. On the judgment in Apata No 1 ,
all such proceedings would have been rendered void and of no effect;
but they are saved in terms of the proviso. The court is empowered
on the application of either party to call or recall any witnesses,
to hear fresh arguments, to grant adjournments, to discontinue the
hearing, to grant a new trial to ensure a fair hearing, or to dismiss
the case. 

 The
“further” proviso also relates to punishment on summarily-laid 

 225 

 charges
of hybrid offences committed between the passing of the Act of 1978
and the date of enactment of the Act of 1980 Punishment, it is
stipulated, must not exceed the maximum that could be imposed on a
defendant who is tried summarily for an indictable offence under
section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act. I think that
it is evident from this proviso that the substituted provision
embraces hybrid indictable charges dealt with summarily. 

 At
the risk of repeating myself it seems very clear to me that the main
object of the Act of 1980 is to restore the status quo ante only in respect of summarily-laid hybrid charges. It is an Act to
clarify by restoring the procedure with regard to summarily-laid
charges of hybrid offences to what it was before the Act of 1978 was
passed. On the clear wording of section 2 of the Act of 1980, it
could not have been the legislature’s intention to restore summary
trial of hybrid indictable charges, simply because that mode of
procedure had never been authorised by law before 1978. The
procedure under the repealed section 61 had never embraced the summary trial of indictably-laid
charges for hybrid offences, albeit the latter were indictable
offences. Section 61 as repealed embraced only those indictable offences “specified in the ‘First
Schedule’” to the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act, i e those
specified indictable offences contained in the Criminal Law
(Offences) Act, none of which in the First Schedule was in the nature
of a hybrid offence (save and except section 80 of the Post and
Telegraphs Act). This was made clear in the judgment of this court
in Apata No 1 (1980) 29 WIR 69 at page 83 where it is clearly stated: “ Before 1978, save and except for section 80 of the Post and Telegraphs Act, all hybrid-type offences were unaffected by the provisions of the repealed section 61(1)”. In my view, the mere fact that the legislature
(which is deemed to know the law) saw fit to include section 80
aforesaid in the First Schedule under the heading of indictable
offences established beyond doubt that a hybrid offence is
indictable. The English authorities relied on ( Hastings
and Folkestone Glassworks Ltd v Kalson [1949] 1 KB 214 and R v Fussell [1951] 2 All ER 761) in Apata No 1 were, strictly speaking, not necessary to establish the indictable
nature of a hybrid offence. 

 It
is important to bear in mind the idea behind the expression “hybrid”
is the susceptibility of that offence to two modes of proceedings on
charges for what is in reality only one offence. Following on this
observation, it seems to me an important fact in elucidating the
legislature’s intention in the “further” proviso to section 2
of the act of 1980 that the infliction of punishment under a
summarily-laid charge for a hybrid indictable offence is brought into
comparison with the infliction of punishment under an indictably-laid
charge, tried summarily. Does this include the hybrid indictable
offence tried summarily? In resolving the issue, I think that it is
important to note that quantum of punishment under the summarily-laid charge is restricted to the
maximum that could be imposed (in the words of the “further”
proviso) if “ the
offence ”
(ie the same offence, the hybrid offence) had instead been dealt with as an 

 226 

 indictable
offence triable summarily under section 61 of the Summary
Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act. It appears to me this restriction or
limitation as to the punishment between the two modes of summary
trial for what is, in effect, one and the same offence ,
leads me to the irresistible conclusion that the summary procedure
for a hybrid indictable offence has been expressly stated to be
within, and is intended to be controlled by, section 61 as
substituted. To my mind, this is clearly another instance where the
intention of the legislature has been clearly and unequivocally
expressed: that there should be only a pro tanto restoration of the status quo ante ;
i e solely with respect to summarily-laid charges, and not otherwise. 

 To
my mind, the legislature’s intention in section 2 of the Act of
1980 is plain enough. With respect to summarily-laid charges of
hybrid offences, these (as we have noted) must be preferred by the
prosecution as they were before 2nd November 1978 (the date when the
Act of 1978 was passed into law). That type of charge is saved by
section 2 from the operation of sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act of
1978. The mode of prosecuting them, trying them, obtaining
convictions, imposing sentences and prosecuting appeals in respect of
them is restored. That is the extent of the restoration by
retrospectivity which the Act of 1980 permits, a method sometimes
referred to as retrospective legislation. But such legislation does
not, as some have complained, provide for punishment for an offence
which, at the time when the act was committed, was not punishable,
and so contrary to the Constitution. I well agree in one sense that
it is retrospective; yet, in another, it is not. No-one, however,
has any vested right in procedure; he has only the right of
prosecution and of defence in the manner prescribed for the time being by or for the court in which he appears; and if any Act of Parliament
alters that mode of procedure, he has no other right than to proceed
according to the altered mode (see Bata Shoe Co v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1976) 24 WIR 172 at page 183). The presumption against a
retrospective construction has no application to enactments like the
Act of 1980 which affect only the procedure and practice of the courts (see Wright v Hale (1860) 30 LJ Ex 40 at page 43, per Wilde B). 

 For
the above reasons, I think that it must follow that the Guyana Court
of Appeal is competent to entertain these applications. In all cases
where convictions are obtained on summarily-instituted charges of
hybrid offences, appeals therefrom will lie to the Full Court of the
High Court; while in all cases where there have been summary trials
of any indictable offence (including hybrid-laid indictables, as in the instant case, or those
under the Criminal Law (Offences) Act), appeals therefrom from
magisterial decisions given after 2nd November 1978 (when the Act of 1978 came into force) will lie, in
accordance with section 7 of the Act of 1978, to the Guyana Court of
Appeal. 

 The
only remaining question is the sole point argued by counsel for the
applicant: that the charge having been brought under the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act and not under the Firearms
Act, 

 227 

 it
was incumbent on the prosecution to prove as a constituent element in
the offence that public order and security were imperilled by reason
of the applicant’s possession of the revolver and six bullets that
were found in his possession. 

 To
buttress his contention, counsel for the applicant called in aid
sections 17 and 24 of the National Security (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act which provide as follows: 




‘ 17.
 (1) A policeman not below the rank of inspector, accompanied by such
persons as he thinks fit, may, without warrant - 

 ( a )
enter, examine and search any premises or place for the purpose of
ascertaining pursuant to the reasonable requirements of public safety or order whether - (i) there are in such premises or place any firearms,
ammunition or explosives; (ii) any place or premises in which any
firearm, ammunition or explosive is kept or stored is or are adequate
to ensure its safe custody and whether the conditions under which it
is kept or stored are adequate for that purpose; 

 ( b )
seize and detain any firearms, ammunition or explosives found therein
in respect of or in connection with which he has reasonable grounds
for suspecting an offence prejudicial to public order or safety has
been or is about to be committed. 

 (2)
Any power exercisable by a policeman not below the rank of inspector
in respect of any place or premises under subsection (1) may be
exercised by a policeman below that rank if he is in charge of the
police station nearest to such place or premises. 

 24.
 (1) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, it shall be lawful
for any policeman to stop and search any person whom he finds in any
street or other public place and reasonably suspects of having any
firearm, ammunition or explosive in his possession contrary to
section 23 or of having committed or being about to commit any other
offence prejudicial to public safety or order.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 It
must be pointed out, however, that when Detective Assistant
Superintendent of Police Vernon Gentle of the Criminal Investigation
Department went to search the applicant’s premises at 144
Friendship, Middle Walk Dam, on 11th July 1979, he told the applicant
that it was his intention to search his premises under the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. Under cross-examination
Gentle further explained that he so informed the applicant, because a
search by an officer of his rank under the National Security
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act did not require a warrant to have been
issued. This being so, in my view that was sufficient proof by the
prosecution that Gentle, in accordance with law, purported to enter
and search the applicant’s premises “pursuant to the reasonable
requirement of public safety or order”. One is entitled to
conclude from the information conveyed by the assistant
superintendent to the applicant that the former was holding out to
the latter that the consideration of public safety or order made it
essential to ascertain whether there was on his premises any
firearms, 

 228 

 ammunition
or explosives. 

 There
is no specific requirement under section 23(1) that peril to public
safety or order must directly be proved by the prosecution, only that
the defendant should have been found in physical and mental
possession of the revolver and six bullets, and also that he failed
to discharge the burden of proving lawful authority for his
possession on a balance of probabilities. And it suffices if the
defendant be told (as indeed it appears that Superintendent Gentle so
told the applicant), that the search was intended to be made under
the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. This statutory
power to search premises for firearms, ammunition and explosives
without warrant is drastic and is restricted generally to police
officers not below the rank of inspector; although any policeman in
charge of a police station nearest to such place or premises may
exercise the power of search. It will be convenient here to set out
section 23(1) and (2) of the National Security (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act so as to show that if the legislature intended peril
to public order or public safety to be an ingredient in section 23(1)
as it is in section 23(2), it would have clearly and unequivocally so
declared: 




 (1)
Subject to section 29, any persons who, without lawful authority, the
burden of proof of which shall lie upon him, purchases, acquires or
has in his possession any firearm, ammunition or explosive shall be
liable on summary conviction to a fine of one thousand dollars and to
imprisonment for three years and, on conviction on indictment, to
imprisonment for life. 

 (2)
Any person who consorts with or is found in the company of another
person who, without lawful authority, has in his possession any
firearm, ammunition or explosive in circumstances which raise a
reasonable prsumption that he intends or is about to act or has
recently acted with such other person in a manner prejudicial to public order or public safety ,
shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of one thousand
dollars and to imprisonment for three years and, on conviction on
indictment, to imprisonment for ten years.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 Section
24, referred to by counsel, is clearly not relevant since it applies
to stopping and searching a vagrant type of person found carrying
firearms, ammunition or explosives “in any street or other public
place”, a situation with which the instant cases are not concerned. 

 The
applications for extension of time are-dismissed for want of merit. 

 R
H Luckhoo JA. At the outset of the hearing of the two applications for extension
of time within which to lodge appeals, I felt it my duty, having
regard to the far-reaching effects of section 2 of the Criminal Law
Act 1980, to take notice of the question of jurisdiction and to ask
whether this court is competent to adjudicate on the matters before
it, and whether the right forum for an appeal from the conviction of
a magistrate for an offence falling under section 23(1) of the
National 

 229 

 Security
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act should not be the Full Court. Both
counsel expressed the view that on their reading and interpretation
of the relevant provisions of the Administration of Justice Act 1978
(hereinafter called “the Act of 1978”) and of the Criminal Law
Act 1980 (hereinafter called “the Act of 1980”), the applications
were properly before the court. With every respect for their view I
find myself unable to agree with their construction of the relevant
provisions for consideration. The deputy Director of Public
Prosecutions has stated that there exists a difference of opinion in
the profession on the proper interpretation of section 2 of the
Criminal Law Act 1980, and that a written ruling on the point from
this court would be most welcome. I have, therefore, acceded to that
request, and, in doing so, I find myself constrained to give a
historical setting to the relevant legislation and the changes
thereby effected. The offence under consideration is worded in this
way: 




‘ 23.
 (1) Subject to section 29, any person who, without lawful authority,
the burden of proof of which shall lie upon him, purchases, acquires
or has in his possession any firearm, ammunition or explosive shall
be liable on summary conviction to a fine of one thousand dollars and
to imprisonment for three years and, on conviction on indictment, to
imprisonment for life.’ 




 The
history of the relevant legislation would have, it seems to me, to be
examined in this light. Prior to the Administration of Justice Act
1978, criminal offences would normally fall into one of four
categories, namely: (1) offences which may be described as purely
indictable, eg murder, manslaughter, rape and such others, which
could be tried only by judge and jury; (2) indictable offences which
could be proceeded with against an adult accused either by trial by
judge and jury or be dealt with by a magistrate, in the latter case
only if the court thought it expedient to do so, having regard to the
provisions of section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act;
those offences were set out in the First Schedule to that Act; the
consent of the accused to a summary trial was then necessary; (3)
summary offences in respect of which summary trial alone would lie, e
g offences under the Summary Jurisdiction (Offences) Act; and (4)
indictable offences (not falling within the First Schedule to the
Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act) which could be proceeded
against either summarily or indictably at the election of the prosecution ,
eg offences such as those coming under section 23(1) of the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act; the accused here had no
option on the election of the prosecution to proceed summarily
against him; his consent was not needed: 

 THE
POSITION AS IT STOOD FROM THE PASSING OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF
JUSTICE ACT UP TO THE PASSING OF THE CRIMINAL LAW ACT 

 The
Administration of Justice Act 1978 has (inter alia) repealed section 

 230 

 61
of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act and substituted another
section 61, while at the same time deleting the First Schedule to
that Act and substituting another First Schedule. These changes have
considerably extended the criminal jurisdiction of magistrates by,
among other things, obviating the necessity to get an adult accused’s
consent to a summary trial of an indictable offence, and by enlarging
the range of indictable offences amenable to a summary trial. 
Categories of offences listed above (heads (1), (2) and (4)) have
thus been affected by these changes. The number of purely indictable
offences to be tried only by judge and jury has been reduced. The
powers of a magistrate to deal summarily with indictable offences
listed in the new First Schedule have been extended. Offences coming
within head (4) were included in the new First Schedule and were
governed by the provisions of the substituted section 61 of the
Administration of Justice Act (see Kwame Apata v Roberts (No 1) (1980) 29 WIR 69).

 THE
POSITION AS IT STANDS ON THE PASSING OF THE CRIMINAL LAW ACT 1980 




‘ 1.
 This Act may be cited as the Criminal Law Act 1980. 

 2.
 Nothing in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Administration of Justice 

 231 

 Act
1978 shall be deemed to affect or ever to have affected any law (whether enacted before or after the enactment of this Act) providing
for the punishment of any person on summary conviction of any offence in
respect of which that person could under that law be liable to
punishment either on summary conviction or on conviction on
indictment or which provided for the prosecution, trial, conviction or sentencing
of any person charged summarily under any such law or for any appeal in respect of any charge brought summarily as
aforesaid: 

 Provided
that in the case of any proceedings (including any appeal
proceedings) pending before any court immediately before the date of
the enactment of this Act in respect of any charge brought summarily
as aforesaid, the court, on application of any party, may ... 

 And
provided further that the punishment of any person on summary
conviction as aforesaid of any offence committed between 2nd November
1978 and the date of the enactment of this Act shall not exceed the
most severe penalty which could have been imposed on him if the
offence had been dealt with as an indictable offence triable
summarily under the provisions of section 61 of the Summary
Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act.’ 




 As
the marginal note to section 2 of the Act of 1978 has correctly
stated, section 2 is an interpretation of certain provisions of the
1978 Act. The draftsman has phrased the opening sentence of section
2 as if the relevant sections of the Act of 1978 referred to had been
construed by the court as “deeming” to affect the so-called
“hybrid offences”. There was nothing in the judgments in Kwame Apata v Roberts (No 1) (1980) 29 WIR 69 to indicate either that Parliament had resorted to
the statutory fiction in the language used in the Act of 1978 to
effect the changes under consideration, or that the court was
adopting a non-natural construction. On the contrary, the court had
made it abundantly clear that the interpretation given to the words
of the sections of the Act of 1978 under scrutiny was the commonsense
interpretation of clear words taken in their ordinary signification. 
Crane C, with whose judgment Massiah JA expresed his concurrence,
said at 29 WIR 69 at page 83 When referring to the right of election
in a prosecutor in the trial of offences falling under section 23(1)
of the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act: 




‘ But,
as I have indicated above, it
was the undoubted right of a prosecutor formerly to have a magistrate
proceed summarily in the case of a ‘hybrid offence’ apart from the provisions of the repealed section 61(1). That right
has now been abrogated by the clear provisions of the substituted
section 61. ‘All indictable offences against any law’ are now
within the embrace of section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction
(Procedure) Act as substituted.’ 




 Earlier
Crane C had said (at page 82): “In my judgment, section 61 

 232 

 of
the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act, as substituted, must be
considered to mean exactly what it says”. He was there giving
effect to what he conceived to be the duty of a court of law to
construe the words by which the intention of Parliament was made
manifest in such a way as would not stultify it. It was not a case
of finding any ambiguity or obscurity in the language of the
provisions; nor was it a case of the court giving to the words of the
legislature an artificial (or strained) meaning. The meaning of the
words “all indictable offences against any law” appearing in the
substituted First Schedule was clear beyond a peradventure, and the
court gave effect to statutory words that were plain and unambiguous
and declined “to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse for
failing to give effect to the plain meaning”. To do otherwise
would have savoured of judicial distortion of language which could
have been remedied only by legislation. What this court had done in
the Apata No 1 appeal was to observe the golden rule of construction. It held that
the legislature had intended literally what it had said expressly. 

 I
venture to think that the purists in style might feel that in the
enactment of section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1980 the legislature
had used language in the opening lines to express its thoughts with
less than its accustomed felicity. Nevertheless, the position is
clear that Parliament has now, by section 2, declared its
interpretation of the provisions of the earlier Act of 1978. It has,
in my opinion, not merely showed its intention to alter the law, but
has in fact done so. It is true that its declaration has offended
the plain language of the earlier Act and has put a non-natural
construction on the words of that Act. But it is competent for
Parliament to do so. It has by section 2 of the Act of 1980 given a
special meaning or colour to the words “all indictable offences
against any law” as they appear in the Administration of Justice
Act. It has expressly placed a particular interpretation on the
terms of the earlier Act, and has, further, made its declaration as
to that interpretation retrospective. Section 2 of the Act of 1980
is, in effect, a retrospective amendment of the provisions of the Act
of 1978 referred to. The enactment of 1980 must not be taken to mean
that Parliament has overruled this court’s judgment in the Apata No 1 case. The court’s judgment was final, binding and effective; and
the court’s interpretation of the Act of 1978 remained the only
correct interpretation until the law was altered by the Act of 1980. 
The legislature recognised the finality and supremacy of that
judgment. To hold otherwise would be to act in a manner that was
unconstitutional by denying the highest court in the land its
rightful constitutional powers as an independent body with the
supreme right to interpret the laws of the land. It was in
recognition of those powers that Parliament decided to amend the law
in order to give effect to what it might have intended on the passing
of the Act of 1978 but which it had defectively left unexpressed. 

 There
are three separate and distinct clauses set out in section 2 of the
Criminal Law Act 1980, and each is governed by the opening words 

 233 

“ nothing
in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Administration of Justice Act 1978
shall be deemed to affect or ever to have affected” namely: (a) any
law providing for the punishment of any person on summary conviction
of any offence in respect of which that person could under that law
be liable to punishment either on summary conviction or on conviction
on indictment; or (b) which provided for the prosecution, trial, conviction or
sentencing of any person charged summarily under any such law; or (c) for any appeal in respect of any charge brought summarily as
aforesaid. 

 The
deputy Director of Public Prosecutions in construing section 2 said
that the purpose of the legislation was to affect the “hybrid”
law only where a summary charge was instituted for such an offence. 
In doing so he attracted attention to the wording of the latter two
clauses of the section. He said that clause (a) must be construed as
being saved from the operations of sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act
of 1978 only in cases where a summary charge was instituted for the
offence. If he is right, it would follow that the draftsman was
re-iterating in clause (b) what he had already said comprehensively
in clause (a); and clause (b) would then be mere surplusage. 
Similarly, clause (c) dealing with appeals would be surplusage
because clause (a) had already exempted from the provisions of
section 7 of the Act of 1978 (dealing with appeals) cases in which
charges were instituted summarily for the “hybrid” offence. 
Clause (a) would have been sufficiently widely framed to cover all
aspects referred to in clauses (b) and (c) and to validate all such
proceedings. If counsel’s argument was that the first clause was
to be construed as affecting only the punishment of offenders of such
a law (whether they were charged summarily or were charged indictably
but dealt with summarily under the Act of 1978), it meant that when a
magistrate came to the punishment stage he must exclude from his mind
the punishment prescribed in the new section 61 substituted by the
Act of 1978, and must look to the penalty provision in the law itself
under which the person was charged. Other than on the aspect of
punishment the provisions of sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act of
1978 would have relevance depending on how a person was charged. If
charged indictably, the provisions of the sections would apply; if
charged summarily, they would not. That line of construction would
be treating clause (a) as having its own content quite separate from
the two other clauses, not controlled or qualified by them, and as
dealing only with the aspect of punishment. With this construction
one would be forced to ask why would the legislature want to provide
two separate procedures for summary trials of the “hybrid”
offence: one which was subjected to all the provisions of section 61
of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act, save the penalty
provision; and the other which was in no way fettered by any of those
provisions when, on summary conviction by either mode, the punishment
provision was the same. Again, if the draftsman was confining the
enactment of the first clause to punishment alone, why would he
include provisions other than that provision (section 4 of the Act of
1978) dealing with punishment to 

 234 

 govern
the clause? To give effect to that line of construction the court
would have to ignore sections 5, 6 and 7, which the draftsman had
expressly included as also affecting the clause. 

 I
should think that the only sensible approach to the interpretation of
the first clause of section 2 would be to give the words used their
plain, ordinary meaning. I pose the question: which “law” is
there being referred to? The answer seems obvious: that is, the law
contained in sections such as section 23(1) of the National Security
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, the law relating to the so-called
“hybrid” offences. The language used, to wit: 




‘ any law ... providing for the punishment of any person on summary conviction
of any offence in respect of which that person could under that law be liable to punishment either on summary conviction or on conviction
on indictment’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 describes
and identifies the particular class of enactments (or laws) affected.
 Section 2 was concerned with the “hybrid” type of law. It was
necessary, therefore, for the legislature to identify the law in the manner in which it did by so describing it as to distinguish
it from other laws also creating indictable offences. The law
concerned was the type of enactment in which by a legislative
technique provision was made in the law itself for two modes of
trial, an inlaid authority making the indictable offence amenable,
like other indictable offences, to a summary trial, and which also
made provision for punishment when that offence was tried summarily. 
The offence therein contained has been judicially held to be one
offence, an indictable offence, and not divisible into two separate
offences: a summary offence and an indictable offence. The language
distinguished this class of indictable offence from the class of
indictable offences caught by section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction
(Procedure) Act in which a person was also liable to punishment on
summary conviction or on conviction on indictment but which was
contained in laws that made no provision for punishment on summary
conviction. It is essential to consider the complete wording of the
clause describing the law affected, otherwise the law affected would
not be properly identified. The scope of the language was
descriptive of the law saved from the Act of 1978. It went no
further. It did not limit or confine its meaning to cases where only
“summary charges” were instituted under such an enactment, which
meaning could have been so easily conveyed in the simple use of the
phrase “on conviction on a summary charge ...” instead of the use
of the phrase “on summary conviction ...”. As we know, a summary
conviction could be achieved on trial of a “hybrid” offence
whether “charged” or “brought” summarily or charged or
brought indictably. The first clause made reference neither to the
procedure adopted on trial of such an offence, nor to the laying of
charges, whether by way of “summary process” or by “indictable
process”, and it would be impermissible to read any such words into
language which was clear and unambiguous. The first clause of
section 

 235 

 2
of the Act of 1980 described in specific terms the law Parliament was excluding from the operation of the relevant
provisions of the Act of 1978. It was Parliament’s way of
declaring and interpreting the position on the passing of the Act of
1978 and of showing that it was not, and never had been, its
intention in that Act to affect the “hybrid” type of law, but
that such a law was to remain untouched by the Act of 1978. 
Parliament’s meaning of the language used in the first clause, when
spelt out, is this: nothing contained in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of
the Act of 1978 was ever intended to apply to laws creating indictable offences and in which laws there is in-built a
provision (an authority) for those indictable offences to be tried
summarily, and in which laws punishment is provided on summary
conviction. This particular drafting style is employed often as
descriptive of the subject-matter under consideration. A similar
technique has been employed by draftsmen in the use of the phrase
“relating to ...” (see Harker v Brittanic Assurance Co Ltd [1928] 1 KB 766). What was under consideration in section 2 was a law of a certain kind. Section 23(1) of the National Security
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act is exactly that kind of law described.
 This court has made it abundantly clear that section 23(1) of that
Act is one law containing one offence and not two laws, or two limbs of one law, containing separate
offences. Section 23(1) has also in-built a provision for the
offence to be dealt with summarily, and it is a law in which
punishment is provided for on summary conviction. Section 2 of the
Act of 1980 dealt only with indictable offences of a certain class
and section 23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act answers correctly to that description. 

 Crane
C had this to say in the Apata No 1 appeal (1980) 29 WIR 69 at page
78: 




‘ I
believe I have sufficiently shown that the term ‘hybrid offences’
is really a misnomer; for the idea is obviously meant to be expressed
in the terms ‘hybrid procedure’, because there is really only one
type of offence in laws drafted like section 23(1) of the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, under which the charges were
preferred, namely an indictable offence ;
although it may be proceeded with either summarily or on indictment.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 In
the passage at page 83 referred to, Crane C used language which
showed the manner in which a summary trial was invoked. He said in
particular (and, I think, quite correctly) “it was the undoubted
right of a prosecutor formerly to have a magistrate proceed summarily in the case of a ‘hybrid offence’”. Note the use of the words
“to have a magistrate proceed summarily”. They connote the
exercise of a right by a prosecutor under that law to call upon a
magistrate to deal summarily with the charge and it was not the case of holding that the
legislature was laying down a law that a summary charge or complaint
was to be instituted for the offence. The provision in the law
itself for summary conviction was Parliament’s authority that that indictable offence may 

 236 

 also
be tried summarily. Parliament had already laid down its laws as to
how indictable offences were to be brought before the court, and how
and for what summary charges or complaints were to be instituted. 
With that I will deal later. 

 It
was no in doubt, at least up to the time of the decision in the Apata No 1 appeal, that the procedure to be adopted depended entirely on the
election of the prosecution, neither magistrate nor defendant having
any voice or discretion in the matter. When a defendant appeared
before a magistrate in answer to an indictable process being served
upon him the prosecution could, before the hearing was commenced,
make its election for a summary trial. If a defendant appeared in
obedience to a “summary” charge laid, it meant that the
prosecution had by this means indicated its election for a summary
trial. The process by which a defendant was summoned before a
magistrate to answer for the alleged commission of an offence did
not, and could not, determine or change the nature and quality of the
offence. The Director of Public Prosecutions at the hearing of the Apata No 1 appeal in this court had correctly observed, in relation to the point
whether an offence was a summary offence or an indictable one, that
the method of bringing a person to court did not determine the
question. He cited in support Jairam v Fowler (1972) unreported, a decision of the Full Court. The authorities to
which reference was made in the Apata No 1 case, namely Hastings and Folkestone Glassworks Ltd v Kalson [1948] 2 All ER 1013 and R v Fussell [1951] 2 All ER 761 had sufficiently emphasised the point that only
one offence was created by laws of the section 23(1) of the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act type, an indictable offence. 
Further support for that view is to be found in R v Guildhall Justices, ex parte Marshall [1976] 1 All ER 767. It is important to bear in mind that a
magistrate had no power of his own to deal summarily with an offence
laid under section 23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act. His
assumption of jurisdiction to try the offence summarily would be only at the election of the
prosecution. If the prosecution did not wish the magistrate to deal
with the offence summarily, the
court was powerless of its own motion to do so .
 Unless and until the prosecution elected to have the magistrate
proceed summarily, either by expressing its election in the
institution of a “summary charge” or by laying an indictable
charge and electing at trial to proceed summarily, the offence (being
indictable and excluded from the scope of the old First Schedule to
the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act) was not triable by a
magistrate. The position was unlike, say, a case of simple larceny:
if charged under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, that was a summary offence ;
but if charged under the Criminal Law (Offences) Act, it was an indictable offence .
 The two statutes created two separate offences ,
one summary, the other indictable, whereas section 23(1) of the
National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act was one law creating only one offence but providing an authority for that indictable offence to be dealt
with summarily. It is erroneous to reason that because a magistrate
could 

 237 

 make
an order on conviction on a summary trial of an offence such as one
falling under section 23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act the offence thereby lost its character, its quality,
of an indictable offence, and became a summary offence. If that
reasoning were sound, then all indictable offences dealt with
summarily under section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure)
Act would automatically become, on conviction, convictions of summary
offences. The character of the offence charged did not change with
the method of trial employed. An indictable offence retained its
indictable character, even though it was tried summarily and an order
of conviction was made in the magistrate’s court. 

 Perhaps
the procedure in relation to the trial of a hybrid offence (as it had
always been prior to the Act of 1978) might be better understood if a
comparison were made with the procedure in relation to the trial of
all other indictable offences save those now specifically set out in
the First Schedule to the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act. By
virtue of section 61 of that Act, the latter indictable offences
could also be tried summarily having regard to the provisions therein
set out. The laws creating those indictable offences did not, it was
true, say anything about summary conviction for such offences nor
what punishment could be imposed. Section 61 made them offences
punishable on summary conviction; but it did not change their nature
or quality as indictable offences nor convert them on summary trial
into “summary-conviction offences”. In other words, the fact
that provision was made, albeit not in the same law under which the
charge was laid, for summary trial did not change the offence into a
summary-conviction offence; it remained an indictable offence. It
had to be charged as such, even though it was amenable to the summary
jurisdiction procedure for trial. The so-called “hybrid”
offence, likewise, is, and has always been, an indictable offence
only; and not two separate offences. Before the Act of 1978 was
passed the so-called “hybrid” offence (save in only one instance)
was not governed by section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction
(Procedure) Act procedure. One could understand the reason for this.
 Built into the section (or law) creating the offence was the
legislature’s authority for a summary trial of the offence. The
legislature had made that indictable offence amenable to a summary
trial. It did not stipulate, in the manner in which section 61 of
that Act had done, how a summary trial was to be invoked. But the
practice had evolved from the earliest time, and had been relied upon
in its long history in numerous cases as to how a summary trial could
be invoked in such matters. That practice had become established
with a long history behind it, and might well have influenced the
courts of this country in the interpretation that they have placed on
such legislation. It was a practice accepted and recognised by the
prosecuting officers formerly of the Crown and now of the State. The
Director of Public Prosecutions in the Apata No 1 appeal (1980) 29 WIR 69 (and this is also the view held by the deputy
Director of Public Prosecutions) correctly stated what had, from the
inception of the 

 238 

 enactment
of the so-called “hybrid” law, been the practice adopted when a
person was charged with an offence created by such a law and the
prosecution wanted to invoke a summary trial authorised in the law
itself. It is reflected early in the judgment of Crane C in the Apata No 1 appeal where he said at page 72: 




‘ On
19th October 1979, the Director of Public Prosecutions appeared at
Vigilance in person. He addressed the magistrate and elected to
proceed with the charge as it stood as a summary instead of the
indictable one; and made representations, as he was entitled to do,
that the court should proceed in that manner. But counsel for the
appellant immediately objected, emphasising that as from 2nd November
1978 the procedure set out in section 4 of the Act of 1978, which
repeals and re-enacts section 61(1) of the Summary Jurisdiction
(Procedure) Act, must be followed before any indictable charge could
be dealt with summarily. The magistrate however ruled that the Act
of 1978 did not apply to criminal offences of the nature of section
23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, i e
such offences that may be tried by either summary or indictable
procedure; and he further ruled, in agreement with submissions of the
Director of Public Prosecutions, that section 23(1) of the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act was not caught by the
provisions of the Act of 1978 because the matter is one for the
election of the State prosecutor and not for him, the magistrate, as
to how he ought to proceed with the case.’ 




 Note
that an indictable process was used in that case, as it should be,
being the proper process to be used to have the person brought before
the court on a charge laid under section 23(1) of the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. The Director of Public
Prosecutions followed the rule of practice of electing to have the
magistrate proceed summarily with the matter. He did not ask to have
the indictable charge withdrawn and to have a summary complaint or
charge substituted. Nor did he seek to institute a summary charge
and ask to have the indictable one stayed. He sought to exercise a
right of election which up to the passing of the Act of 1978, the
courts of the land have interpreted the legislation to have given to
him to invoke a summary trial. Lawyers with experience practising
over a wide span of time know that an election was made before the
presiding magistrate by the prosecutor simply telling the magistrate
that he wanted a summary trial of the charge. Sometimes, the
election was indicated by the institution of a “summary charge”. 
The exercise of a right of election to have the case tried summarily
by merely informing the magistrate to that effect was clearly stated
in the judgment of Crane C in the Apata No 1 appeal (1980) 29 WIR 69 at page 74 when he used words in a passage of
his judgment which did not contemplate the need for the institution
of a “summary charge” in place of an indictable charge. The
words he used were: 




‘ It
seems to me the magistrate’s way of thinking was that the power 

 239 

 of
election to proceed summarily, as it formerly used to be ,
was still resident in the Director of Public Prosecutions; that as he
was traditionally entitled to elect summary trial in ‘hybrid offences’ before the passing of the Act of 1978, he should continue to do so.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 These
words were uttered in the context of the facts of the case before the
magistrate which were set out earlier (see page 72 of the judgment). 
Crane C was restating what had become a rule of practice. It was a
practice which the magistrate in the instant matter had said (in his
memorandum of reasons for decision) was unquestioned and settled. He
said: 




‘ It
was clear from the language of the enactment that sets up a hybrid
offence that Parliament intended that the summary procedure could be
used as an alternative to the indictable mode of trial; in the
absence of express provision as to the procedure to be adopted to
have the offence tried summarily, the courts in order not to
frustrate the intention of Parliament evolved the practice of leaving
it to the prosecution to elect whether or not to have the matter done
summarily. The practice in England and that in Guyana were therefore
basically the same. There is no doubt that it became the
unquestioned and settled practice in the courts for 40 years or more
for the prosecution to elect to have a hybrid offence done summarily.
 As I understand it, in such a situation only an Act of Parliament
should abrogate the practice.’ 




 The
magistrate was there answering the submission made by counsel that
the prosecution did not have the right to elect to have the
magistrate deal summarily with a charge brought indictably for a
“hybrid” offence. He said to agree with that submission would be
to fly in the face of strong dicta by the Court of Appeal in the Apata No 1 case. The concept of election could only properly be understood in
this light. It was so understood by the office of the Director of
Public Prosecutions, by magistrates over the years, and by the
appellate courts. It is, I am afraid, much too late in the day to
deny that unquestioned and invariable rule of practice. 

 Another
mode of indicating the election to have a magistrate proceed
summarily was by the institution of a “summary charge”. Crane C
said so at page 78 of his judgment in the Apata No 1 appeal, and also stated in effect at page 82 that since the passing
of the Act of 1978, the institution by a prosecutor of a “summary
charge” was no longer to be treated as the exercise of a right of
election but was to be “regarded as a basis for making
representations under the substituted section 61(1)”. The judgment
of Crane C in the Apata No 1 appeal in reference to the institution of a “summary charge” must
be considered in the context of the whole judgment. The subject was
treated solely in the sense of a mode of indicating the prosecutor’s
exercise of his right of election. Nowhere 

 240 

 in
the judgments of the court would there be found anything to show that
the court accepted the argument that within the framework of the
“hybrid” law, two offences were conceived, namely a summary
conviction offence and an indictable offence, which would necessitate
the laying of two different kinds of complaints or charges. If there
was anything said by the court which might be taken to mean that a
summary charge could legitimately be instituted for the offence, it
would be a dictum which would be erroneous, as it would have been in direct
contravention of the express laws of the land. When the court used
language such as the institution of a “summary charge” or
preferring a “summary charge” it was in reference to the mode by
which the prosecution indicated the exercise of its right to have the
magistrate deal with the matter summarily. The courts could not
properly sanction the institution of a summary charge for an
indictable offence when the laws of the land do not permit that. 
Taken out of its context the use of language in the Apata No 1 judgment about a person being “charged summarily”, or proceedings
being “preferred summarily” could be misleading and might well
have misled some persons into thinking that there could be a valid institution of a “summary charge” for an indictable offence
falling under section 23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act. As is the case with other indictable offences tried
summarily, a person would be brought to court by way of an indictable
process, e g by way of summons or on an arrest warrant. 

 If
I am right in saying that Mr Jackman’s construction of the first
clause of section 2 of the Act of 1980 does not appeal to me for the
reasons given, and that the clause is expressed in comprehensive
language, not in terms of art, not in the use of words bearing a
technical meaning, not in words hard to understand in their full
literal sense, and should be construed according to the ordinary
rules without giving it a limited meaning, the clause would be an
exempting clause. It would be exempting the trial of offences
committed contrary to “hybrid” law from the provisions of
sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the Act of 1978. One is then faced with
the next question, which is: why was it necessary to have inserted in
section 2 of the Act of 1980 the remaining two clauses and provisos
which appeared to limit the exclusion of the operations of sections
4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act of 1978 to particular situations? It might
be reasoned thus: if clause (a) comprehensively covered all that was
contained in clauses (b) and (c), why insert the latter clauses? 
Similarly, if clauses (b) and (c) and the provisos dealt fully with
the purpose of the legislation, why insert clause (a)? One would not
like to accuse a draftsman of being guilty of surplusage. One should
endevour to look for the reason or reasons for the enactment in the
way it was framed. If I am right in construing clause (a), complete
in itself, to mean exactly what it said, and which was that neither
before the Act of 1978, nor since, was there ever any intention on
the part of the legislature to affect the “hybrid” law by any
provision contained in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act of 1978,
that law would be completely excluded from the operations 

 241 

 of
those sections and all proceedings including appeals taken or lodged
in contravention of those provisions would be valid and effective. 
Why then clauses (b) and (c) and provisos? To discern the reason for
clauses (b) and (c) one must keep constantly in mind the approach of
the prosecuting officers of the State in the arguments advanced in
the Apata No 1 case (1980) 29 WIR 69, the judgment of this court in that appeal, and
the rationes decidendi .
 The contention of the Director of Public Prosecutions ws that, once
a “hybrid” offence was proceeded with summarily, the offence was
a “summary offence”. This court ruled otherwise. It held the
offence was one offence, an indictable offence, and remained so, even
though prior to the act of 1978 it could have been dealt with
summarily by a magistrate at the election of the prosecution. That
judgment was not impugned; and it is accepted by the prosecution in
the instant matter that only one offence is contained in section
23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, an
indictable offence. One has to sit in the draftsman’s chair, and
to try to visualise what he must have had before him and what must
have been passing through his mind. This court’s judgment in the Apata No 1 appeal must have been prominent. That decision had considered the
“hybrid” law in the light of the Act of 1978 and had ruled that
it was caught in the broad sweep of the draftsman’s pen in the new
section 61 provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act and
the First Schedule, a view that had been disavowed by the Director of
Public Prosecutions who had maintained that his right of election
hitherto enjoyed was in no way affected. There was thus a
revolutionary change in procedure in the conduct of trials of the
“hybrid” offence. No longer was there vested in the prosecution
the right of election to have a magistrate proceed with the charge
summarily. In the language of Crane C in the Apata No 1 appeal, that undoubted right of a prosecutor formerly to have a magistrate proceed
summarily was abrogated .
 Any institution of a “summary charge” since the Act of 1978 for
a “hybrid” offence could no longer be indicative of the
prosecution’s exercise of his right of election, but could only be
regarded as a basis for making representation under the substituted section 61 of the
Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act. 

 I
also have to bear in mind the rule that construction is to be made of
all the parts of section 2 of the Act of 1980 together and not of one
part only by itself. Equally important to remember is the canon of
construction that where the usual meaning of words taken in their
literal sense falls short of the object of the legislature a more
extended meaning may be attributed to them, if they are fairly
susceptible of it. Maxwell
on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edn), Chapter 4, deals with this aspect and refers to this
relaxation of the strict, literal, principles of interpretation as
beneficial to construction. The author noted that the modern cases
provided many instances of what he termed “the judges’ reluctance
to stand upon the letter of a statute”. When the draftsman used
language such as he used in clause (b) and clause (c) and the first
proviso, namely “person charged summarily”, appeal in respect of
any 

 242 

“ charge
brought summarily”, he was, in my view, using language to be taken
neither in a literal nor a technical sense. I say this because the
court by its interpretation of the section 23(1) of the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act type of law had made the
position clear that that law contained only one offence, an
indictable offence, and was not a law with two arms or branches to it
creating two separate offences, one a summary conviction offence and
the other an indictable offence. It is to be assumed that the
draftsman had not overlooked that ruling. It would be
jurisprudentially unsound and incorrect for one to speak of a person
being “charged summarily” for an indictable offence. The laws of
the land have laid down that a summary charge could properly be laid
or instituted only for a summary conviction offence, eg an offence
falling under the Summary Jurisdiction (Offences) Act. I advert to
the relevant sections of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act and
of the Criminal Law (Procedure) Act to demonstrate my point. 
Sections 4, 11(1) and 14 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act
read as follows: 




‘ 4.
 Every proceeding in the court for the obtaining of an order against
any person in respect of a summary conviction offence shall be instituted by a complaint made before the magistrate of the
court. 

 11.
 (1) Whenever a complaint is made before a magistrate that any person
has committed, or is suspected to have committed, any
summary conviction offence within his jurisdiction, the magistrate may issue his summons
directed to that person, stating concisely the substance of the
complaint, and requiring him to appear at a certain time not less
than forty-eight hours after the service of the summons and at a
certain place, before the court of the magistrate to answer the
complaint, and to be further dealt with according to law. 

 14.
 On a complaint in writing and upon oath being made before a
magistrate for any summary conviction offence ,
the magistrate may, on good cause being shown to him for so doing,
and on oath being made before him substantiating the matter of the
complaint to his satisfaction, instead of issuing a summons, issue in
the first instance a warrant to apprehend the person against whom the
complaint has been made and to bring him before the court of the
magistrate to answer the complaint, and to be further dealt with
according to law.’ 




 [emphasis

 Sections
48, 51, 52 and 56 of the Crimial Law (Procedure) Act read as follows: 




‘ 48.
 Every magistrate may issue a summons or warrant as hereinafter mentioned to compel the appearance of an
accused person before him for the purpose of preliminary inquiry, in
any of the following cases: ( a )
if the person is accused of having committed in any place whatever an indictable offence triable in Guyana, and is, or is suspected to be, within the limits
in which the magistrate 

 243 

 has
jurisdiction, or resides or is suspected to reside within those
limits... 

 51.
 Upon any complaint or information given to a magistrate that an indictable offence has been committed by any person whose appearance he has power to
compel, the magistrate shall consider the allegations of the
complainant or informant, and, if he is of opinion that a case for so
doing is made out, he shall issue a summons or warrant, as the case
may be, in the manner hereinafter mentioned; and he shall not refuse
to issue the summons or warrant only because the alleged offence is
one for which an offender may be arrested without warrant. 

 52.
 (1) The magistrate may issue a summons although there is not any
complaint or information in writing or upon oath. 

 (2)
The summons shall be directed to the accused person, and shall
require him to appear at a certain time and place to be therein
mentioned. 

 (3)
The summons shall not be signed in blank. 

 56.
 When any person is apprehended upon a warrant he shall be brought
before a magistrate as soon after he is so arrested as practicable, and the magistrate shall either proceed with the preliminary inquiry or
postpone it to a future time, in which latter case he shall either
commit the accused person to prison, or admit him to bail, or permit
him to be at large on his own recognisance, according to the
provisions hereinafter contained.’ 




 [emphasis

 These
sections clearly show the different ways in which proceedings are to
be instituted for a summary conviction offence and for an indictable
offence. It is unfortunate that the draftsman used those words or
phrases in clauses (b) and (c) and the first proviso, which similar
words when used in the judgment of the Apata No 1 appeal (1980) 29 WIR 69 might have been inoffensive in the context of
signifying the election of the prosecution prior to the Act of 1978
to have a magistrate proceed summarily with the trial of the offence;
but which could, in construing section 2 of the Act of 1980, mislead
into treating of the “hybrid” law as creating a summary
conviction offence and an indictable offence. I should think that a
fair and sensible reading of clauses (b) and (c) and of the first
proviso would be to interpret the words in the sense in which they
were intended to be interpreted, that is “charge proceeded against
summarily” or “dealt with summarily”. In this way both modes
of election for a summary trial would be effectively covered, as, it
would seem, they were intended to be, and there would be the
achievement of harmony in the construction of all the parts of
section 2 taken together. At the same time there would be an
avoidance of a construction which would be productive of anomalies,
absurdities and a repugnance to the laws laid down for the
institution of summary charges or complaints and for the institution
of indictable proceedings. To construe the section as meaning that
the legislature was excluding the “hybrid’ offence from the 

 244 

 operation
of the provisions of the Act of 1978 only where a charge was
“instituted summarily”, and not where indictable proceedings were
instituted for the offence, would now result in the section 23(1) of
the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act type of offence
being subjected to three separate procedures for trial. When a summary charge was instituted,
it would be tried summarily with no requirement for the supply of
copies of statements, etc. When indictable proceedings were
instituted, that charge could also be tried summarily under section
61 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act, in which case the
mandatory requirements of that section would have to be complied
with. The third procedure for trial would be trial by judge and
jury. Whereas prior to the Act of 1978 only two forms of trial were
open for trial of the offence, three forms have now emerged on this
construction, and with three different punishment provisions; the two
summary trial convictions would carry different punishments, the one
prescribed under section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure)
Act, the other in the charging section of the law itself. Another
anomaly or absurdity that would be apparent would be this: a
prosecutor who, on the appearance of a defendant in court on an
arrest warrant obtained under the Criminal Law (Procedure) Act for an
offence committed contrary to section 23(1) of the National Security
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (the proper process for indictable
offences and which would constitute the initiation of proceedings),
desired to request a summary trial, could only obtain his wish at the
discretion of the presiding magistrate and subject to the mandatory
provisions set out in section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction
(Procedure) Act, when at all times before the appearance of the
defendant in court the right to invoke a summary trial by the
institution of a summary charge resposed in him alone without the
need for him to supply the court with copies of statements of
witnesses, etc. As can be discerned from the sections referred to of
both procedural Acts, the scheme of those Acts showed a separate and
distinct treatment of summary conviction offences and of indictable
offences, and laid down the manner in which each type of offence was
to be charged. The construction sought to be placed on the phrases
used in clauses (b) and (c) and the first proviso would constitute a
violation of the whole scheme of the Summary Jurisdication
(Procedure) Act and the Criminal Law (Procedure) Act and would
vitally affect the juridical concept of the character of the offence
under consideration. To adopt the language of the author of Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edn), page 231, where the sense of the statute demanded it, a
court would be prepared to substitute another word or phrase for that
which actually appeared in the text of the Act. It would be a
modification of language to meet the intention without doing violence
to the language used. 

 Clauses
(b) and (c) with the proviso were, in my view, specifically inserted, ex
abundanti cautela ,
to make it clear that the trial, prosecution, etc, of charges dealt
with under that law (the “hybrid” type of law in 

 245 

 breach
of the section 61 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act
procedure, and appeals lodged in respect of charges dealt with
summarily were not intended to be affected by the Act of 1978, and
(in the former case) prosecutions, trials, etc, were valid and
effective and (in the latter) appeals lodged were valid and
effective. Although it is true that clause (a) in effect validated
all pending proceedings and appeals of “hybrid” matters tried
summarily, or being tried summarily, in non-compliance with the
section 61 procedure, the legislature felt it necessary to make
specific reference to those matters in clauses (b) and (c) and the
first proviso; and this might no doubt have been due to the confusion
which existed in the minds of some following upon the decision in the Apata No 1 appeal (1980) 29 WIR 69. On a sensible reading of the whole of the
section, one perceives the object or purpose behind the legislation. 
It was sought to exclude the procedural requirements of the 1978 law
(inclusive of the procedure for appeals) on the summary trial of
indictable offences from the summary trial of indictable offences of
the “hybrid” kind. The procedure for other indictable offences
taken summarily had to conform to the procedure laid down in sections
4, 5, 6, and 7 of the Act of 1978; not so the procedure for the
“hybrid” offence tried summarily. By this exclusion the
procedure for summary trials and for appeals of the so-called
“hybrid” offences were to continue just as they had always been
prior to the Act of 1978. Clause (a) is the substratum, the
all-embracing provision of the section governing the whole of the
section and not governed or controlled or cut down by any of the
other parts of the section. It revealed the legislative policy of
the enactment in taking the “hybrid” law outside the purview of
the Act of 1978. 

 The
record reveals that the prosecution opted for summary trial of the
charges at the outset before the charges had been entered upon. 
Although when the matters were commenced the section 61 of the
Summary Jurisdiction (Procedure) Act procedure was applicable by
virtue of the court’s decision in the Apata No 1 appeal, with the coming into force of the 1980 Act before the hearing
was concluded and because of the retrospective effect of the
legislation, the trial was to be held as not having been in any way
governed by the provisions of the 1978 Act, and was to be treated in
the same manner as a summary trial taking place before the passing of
the 1978 Act on the exercise of the prosecution’s right of election
to a summary trial. Prior to the passing of the 1978 Act, the
decision of a magistrate on the trial of such a charge, whether “laid
summarily” or laid indictably but heard summarily, was appealable
to the Full Court. In my view, section 2 of the Criminal Law Act
1980 has restored the procedure for appeals by excluding the
provisions of section 7 of the Act of 1978 from their application to
laws creating the so-called hybrid offences. 

 For
these reasons, I am of the view that this court is not competent to
adjudicate on the application before it, and I find myself
respectfully having to decline jurisdiction. 

 246 

 Fung-a-Fatt
JA. On 28th April 1980, the applicant was convicted of being in
possession of a firearm and ammunition without lawful authority on
11th July 1979, contrary to section 23(1) of the National Security
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. 

 From
these convictions the applicant appealed to the Full Court of the
High Court and, on 28th November 1980, that court declined
jurisdiction to hear the matter and gave leave to the applicant to
withdraw the appeal. The conviction and sentence of the magistrate
were affirmed. 

 On
3rd December 1980, as a result of this conviction, the applicant
filed a notice of motion addressed to this court, seeking an
extention of time of fourteen days (or such further time as the court
may deem just) within which to file and serve a notice of appeal from
the decision of Mr Oslen Small, the magistrate of the East Demerara
magisterial district. 

 During
the course of the hearing of this motion Luckhoo JA raised the
important question of whether or not this was the correct forum to
hear and detemine the application in view of the provisions of
section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1980, which became law on 1st April
1980. The deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, who appeared for
the respondent, expressed the view that this court had jurisdiction
to hear the matter. On the other hand, Mr Stephenson, who appeared
for the appellant, said that there was some confusion among the legal
practitioners whether the Full Court or this court was the correct
forum to which any such appeal and matter incidental thereto should
be brought. 

 The
question of the jurisdiction of this court to entertain this
application was not argued and counsel was granted leave to continue
with his sole ground of appeal. 

 The
contention of counsel for the applicant was that the prosecution had
failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt an essential ingredient of
the offence under which he was charged, to wit that the possession of
the firearm and ammunition by the applicant jeopardised the national
security of the State. He conceded that the section did not
expressly so provide, but invited us to hold that such an intent must
necessarily be implied in view of the long title of the National
Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which is “An Act to make
provision for diverse matters touching on national security”. 

 Section
23(1) of the National Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act reads
as follows: 




‘ Subject
to section 29, any person who, without lawful authority, the burden
of proof of which shall lie upon him, purchases, acquires or has in
his possession any firearm, ammunition or explosive shall be liable
on summary conviction to a fine of one thousand dollars and to
imprisonment for three years and, on conviction on indictment, to
imprisonment for life.’ 




 Despite
the long title of the statute, however, section 23(1), unlike 

 247 

 section
23(2), omits any reference to matters of national security. Section
23(2) reads as follows: 




‘ Any
person who consorts with or is found in the company of another person
who, without lawful authority, has in his possession any firearm,
ammunition or explosive in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that he intends
or is about to act or has recently acted with such other peson in a
manner prejudicial to public order or public safety ,
shall be liable on summary conviction ...’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 It
seems clear to me from reading the whole of section 23 that the
legislature specifically inserted the words “intends or is about to
act or has recently acted” in subsection (2) so as to make this
intent an ingredient or element of the offence. Were these words
present in subsection (1), the section under which the appellant has
been charged, then counsel’s submission would have been in my
opinion on firmer ground; but in my view the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius is applicable and therefore I find myself unable to agree with the
submission of counsel for the applicant. On this ground the
application must therefore be refused. 

 Turning
my attention now to the question of jurisdiction, let me say at the
outset that I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of
Crane C and I am in agreement with the reasons and conclusions on the
aspect of jurisdiction. I am of the view that, prior to the coming
into operation of the Administration of Justice Act in November 1978,
a “hybrid offence” could have been proceeded with either
summarily or indictably at the election of the prosecution, by virtue
of the provisions of the particular enactment. If the prosecution
elected to have a summary trial, it is my view that a summary charge
must be laid. If, however, the prosecution elected to have the
charge tried indictably before a judge and jury, and instituted an
indictable charge, the charge must proceed indictably. It is my
considered opinion that, prior to the Administration of Justice Act
1978, the prosecution could not have elected to have an indictably
laid charge in respect of a hybrid offence (as the present one) taken
summarily by the magistrate. The election of the prosecution to have
the charge taken indictably or summarily must have been exercised in
the laying of the charge. If a summary trial was desired, a summary
charge would have had to be laid; so also, if the desire was to
proceed indictably, an indictable charge would have had to be
preferred. One of my reasons for reaching this conclusion is to be
found in the old First Schedule to the Summary Jurisdiction
(Procedure) Act, which was substituted by section 4 of the
Administration of Justice Act 1978. 

 In
its predecessor Schedule appears the only “hybrid offence” (see
section 80 of the Post and Telegraph Act) which, if laid indictably,
was permitted to be taken summarily on an application under section
61 of the Act. Again applying the legal maxim referred to earlier,
this (to my mind) shows clearly that any other “hybrid offences”
when charged indictably must be proceeded with as such, as neither
the prosecution 

 248 

 nor
the magistrate was empowered under that provision (or indeed under
any other law) to have the matter tried summarily. 

 The
Administration of Justice Act 1978 was passed to extend the criminal
jurisdiction of magistrates, and the substituted First Schedule now
includes all hybrid offences, which this court has ruled are
indictable offences; see Kwame Apata v Roberts (No 1) (1980) 29 WIR 69, where the applicant’s appeals were allowed as the
prosecution had failed to comply with section 61(6) at the instance
of the magistrate. This court also ruled that an appeal from a
decision of a magistrate in respect of such an offence, even if taken
summarily, must lie to the Court of Appeal by virtue of section 7(1)
of the Administration of Justice Act 1978. 

 About
a month after the decision of this court in the Apata No 1 case, the Criminal Law Act 1980 was passed to clarify the procedure
relating to the summary trial of indictable offences and to provide
for certain other matters relating to the criminal law. Crane C has
dealt fully with the interpretation of section 2 of this Act, and I
am fully in agreement with his analytical construction of the
section; and I find myself unable to add anything useful to his
analysis. It is my considered judgment that section 2 of the
Criminal Law Act 1980 refers only to summarily-laid hybrid offences
and does not in any way relate to or affect indictably-laid hybrid
offences, whether tried indictably or taken summarily by the
magistrate. I am, therefore, of the view that an appeal from the
decision of a magistrate in respect of an indictably-laid (hybrid)
offence which is tried summarily lies to this court. 

 For
the foregoing reasons I would refuse the application and dismiss the
motion. 

 Motion
dismissed.

 A
village council, in accordance with its power under section 102(2) of
the Local Government Act to authorise in writing any person to seize
and impound stray animals, gave S written authority to “impound all
strays found in local authority reserves”. S, acting under that
authority, drove 60 to 70 head of cattle along a public road to a
police pound. On the way to the pound a collision occurred between a
lorry owned by the plaintiff and the cattle. Very substantial damage
was caused to the lorry and the plaintiff sued the village council
and S for negligence. S did not enter an appearance to the
proceedings. At the trial, the driver of the lorry stated in
evidence that, when he first saw the cattle in the road, he reduced
his speed from 48 km p h to 24 km p h. The trial judge held that S
was employed by the village council as a servant and that the latter
was liable for S’s negligence. He further stated that, even had S
been an independent contractor, the village council would have been
liable for his negligence by reason of the dangerous nature of the
task undertaken. Damages were awarded jointly and severally against
the village council and S. On an appeal by the village council, 

 Held allowing the appeal - 

 (1)
on the proper construction of the written authority given to S by the
village council, it conferred no obligations on S, the village
council had no right to control the manner in which S performed the
task and the authority could be withdrawn at will; accordingly, S was
not the 

 250 

 servant
of the village council, nor was he an independent contractor, but he
was merely a licensee who was permitted by the village council to
enter its reserves to catch stray animals; accordingly, the village
council was not liable for any negligence by S in the performance of
the task. 

 Performing
Right Society Ltd v Mitchell [1924] 1 KB 762 applied. 

 (2)
The award of damages should be apportioned 50-50 between S and the
plaintiff since the driver had admitted negligence in not slowing the
lorry down to walking pace (if not actually stopping it) when
confronted by the cattle; even though contributory negligence had not
been pleaded (S not having entered an appearance), where contributory
negligence was admitted in evidence it was appropriate as a matter of
justice that a finding should be made as to degrees of fault.

 Appeal 

 Appeal The village council of the East Coast Berbice Village District
appealed to the Court of Appeal of Guyana (civil appeal 15 of 1980)
against a decision of the High Court that it was vicariously liable
for the negligence of a stray-catcher, Patrick Sancho, appointed by
it and was accordingly liable to pay damages to the plaintiff,
Shambool Hussain. Sancho did not enter an appearance to the
proceedings. The facts are set out in the judgment of Crane C.

 M
R Persaud for the plaintiff 

 Sancho
did not appear and was not represented. 

 Crane
C. The decision in this appeal will be of some moment to stray-catchers
and to local authorities within whose boundaries stray animals roam. 
Section 102(1) to (5) of the Local Government Act provides as
follows: 




‘ (1)
If any animal grazes, or strays, on or in any main drain, or on a
public road, street, dam, bridge, or other public place, within the
boundaries of the district of a local authority, the person having
the possession or control of the animal shall be liable on summary
conviction to a fine of ten dollars, unless he proves that the animal
was so grazing or straying through no act or default on the part of
himself or his servants or agents. 

 (2)
Any animal grazing or straying on any place mentioned in subsection
(1), may be seized and impounded by any member of the police force or
of the rural constabulary, or by any officer of the rural authority, or
by any person authorised in writing by the local authority . 

 (3)
Swine straying on any place mentioned in subsection (1) may be
destroyed by any of the persons mentioned in subsection (2), and the

 In
conformity with the law as above stated, the chairman of the village
council of the East Coast Berbice Village District (lots 1 to 37)
issued the under-mentioned authority to Patrick Sancho, a
professional stray-catcher on loth February 1977: 




‘ The
... local authority hereby authorise Patrick Sancho of ... to impound
all strays found on local authority reserves at Seawell and No 7
villages, for the year ending 1977.’ 




 On
Friday, 29th April 1977, Sancho, acting in accordance with the above
authority, was driving about 60 to 70 head of cattle on the No 19
public road to the police pound at Albion on the Corentyne. He was
driving them from the village council’s reserves at No 7 where he
had seized them. The pound-keeper’s register is evidence of this
fact. As Sancho reached a place called “Industry” (on No 19
village public road near to “Wind Dam”), a collision occurred
between a Bedford motor lorry owned by the plaintiff and the herd of
cattle driven by Sancho. John Samarco was the driver of the motor
lorry at the time and two passengers were seated beside him in the
cab of the Bedford lorry at the time of the collision. All three of
them gave evidence in the action which followed in the High Court
between the lorry’s owner, Shambool Hussain (the plaintiff), and
the first-named defendants, the village council of the East Coast
Berbice Village District (“the village council”) and the
second-named defendant, Patrick Sancho. 

 In
the High Court, the plaintiff, a businessman who hails from Bohemia,
Corentyne, Berbice, claimed from the defendants jointly and
severally, the sum of $30,000 as damages suffered as the result of
the negligence of both defendants. At the time of the collision, it
is alleged that Sancho, a stray-catcher employed as a servant by the
village council, had so negligently managed or controlled the herd of
cattle he had in charge (driving to the Albion pound on the village
council’s behalf) that the animals rushed across the path of the
plaintiff’s lorry as it was being driven to New Amsterdam. 

 The
lorry, it is claimed, was completely wrecked, damage having been
sustained to its chassis, engine, generator, steering, fenders,
headlamps, hood and electric wiring. In the particulars of
negligence, it is alleged that the herd of cattle was being driven on
the Industry public road at No 19 village during the hours of
darkness without proper control and by an inadequate number of men. 
Sancho, it is said, was seated astride a horse at the time he was
driving the animals on the highway and was assisted only by his son
on foot. To restore the lorry to good working order and condition,
spare parts had to be acquired at 

 253 

 the
cost of $18,402, For this, together with the cost of miscellaneous
repairs, amounting to $6598 and loss of use of $5000 in respect of
the lorry, a round claim for $30,000 was made. 

 In
the court below, the village council had categorically denied
employing Sancho as its servant or that the latter was at the time of
the collision acting in the course of employment with them. They
contended that Sancho was an independent contractor and that, in that
capacity, he could not be considered to have been their servant; and
for this reason they have pointedly disclaimed vicarious
responsibility for any negligence Sancho may have committed, if he
did indeed negligently cause the animals to dash across the highway
into the path of the plaintiff’s lorry on the public road. 

 After
hearing the evidence of eight witnesses for the plaintiff, including
the driver of the Bedford motor lorry and his two passengers as to
how the accident occurred and evidence from mechanics and other
workers on the cost of the repairs done to rehabilitate the lorry,
the trial judge awarded judgment jointly and severally against both
the village council and Sancho in the sum of $25,850 with costs
($800). He awarded the full amount claimed in respect of the
particulars of damage mentioned above, but made no award in respect
of the claim for $5000 for the loss of use of the lorry. 

 In
arriving at his conclusion that the village council was vicariously
liable for Sancho’s negligence, the judge held that Sancho was not
an independent contractor in the village council’s employ; but he
was employed in the capacity of a servant. The judge considered that
the village council had not been exercising control over the manner
in which Sancho worked. I have indicated that there arose on the
pleadings the issue whether Sancho was employed by the village
council as a servant or an independent contractor. The plaintiff
asserted that Sancho was employed in the capacity of a servant, while
the village council contended that he was an independent contractor. 
Sancho, however, did not plead; he did not enter an appearance to the
writ, although he had been served with process. Perhaps the
remarkable feature about this case is that, although he ignored the
court by withholding his presence from it (thus forcing the court to
conduct the proceedings in his absence) it was found necessary in the
interest of justice to investigate his degree of fault and to reduce
the damages for which he would otherwise have been liable. 

 And
so the question of liability was fought out and decided on that
basis, with the judge deciding that Sancho was a servant of the
village council. His reasons for so concluding are not altogether
clear, but it is astonishing to see that he made this finding in the
teeth of the evidence that two of the elementals of the master and
servant relationship were wanting, viz (i) that Sancho did not in
fact receive his remuneration from the village council, and (ii) that the village council did not
exercise any control over the manner in which he performed his work. So it is surprising
to see the conclusion was reached that the relationship of 

 254 

 master
and servant was proved. The judge came to the conclusion, it
appears, for the reason that as the village council was the person
entitled in law to receive the fees for the impounded strays and not
Sancho, an implied agreement had been concluded whereby he should be
remunerated directly by the pound-keeper. Section 4 of the Pounds
Act provides as follows: 




‘ The
owner or person in possession of any private premises or land whereon
any stray is found trespassing may take, or by someone authorised by him in writing send ,
the stray to the nearst pound, and for so doing he shall receive from
the keeper thereof the sum of fifty cents for every horse, mare,
gelding, pony, mule, bull, cow, ox, heifer, or steer, thirty-five
cents for every ass, and twenty-five cents for every calf, sheep or
goat.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 On
the other hand, as the judge saw it, assuming (although not
admitting) that Sancho was an independent contractor, the village
council would still be liable for gross negligence because of the
dangerous nature of the task that was undertaken (i e driving such a
large herd of cattle on the highway on horseback in darkness and
without adequate assistance), a task the village council could not in
law legally delegate to anyone (see Sattaur v Rupununi Development Co Ltd [1952] LRBG 113, which was cited). 

 As
I have indicated, the case was pleaded, contested and decided on a
master and servant/independent contractor basis, with the trial judge
coming down on the side of the master and servant relationship. But
it is well known that one of the ways, although not an entirely
conclusive way, of determining the true nature of the relationship is
to ask oneself whether there is a contract of service (master and servant) or a contract for services (independent
contractor) (see per Hilbery J in Collins v Hertfordshire County Council [1947] KB 598 at page 615). 

 For
myself, I believe that the solution to this matter is one of law and
lies in the true construction to be given to the village council’s
letter authorising Sancho “to impound all strays found on the local
authority reserves at Seawell and No 7 villages, for the year ending
1977”. As McGardie J said in Performing Right Society Ltd v Mitchell [1924] 1 KB 762 at page 766: 




‘ The
question whether a man be a servant or an independent contractor is
often a mixed question of fact and law. If, however, the
relationship rests upon a written document only, the question is primarily one of law. The contract is
to be construed in the light of the relevant circumstances.’ 




 Now,
looking at the terms of Sancho’s authority, can it be said that a
contract in the jurisprudential sense of the word arises between him
and the village council? Can it be said that the village council’s
mandate to Sancho created any obligation between him and the village
council 

 255 

 such
that it gave rise to legal relations, so that (if Sancho refused or
neglected to impound strays on the village council’s reserves) the
village council could properly sue him for not so doing, or (if he
performed the job of work) he could legally sue the village council
for wages earned for so doing (supposing he did not receive them from
the pound-keeper)? 

 The
word “contract” is sometimes used in a sense similar to that of
“agreement” in its primary sense, namely the common intention of
two persons with regard to a certain subject. But all agreements are
not contracts. To be a contract an agreement must, among other
things, be directed to the creation of legal obligations .
 I am adopting this approach because, unless the authority to Sancho
can be said to be ( stricto
jure )
in the nature of a contract ,
neither a master and servant nor an independent contractor’s
relationship can be a juristic basis on which to found judgment. 

 In
my view, on the true construction of Sancho’s authority, he was
merely given a licence, permission or bare authority by the village
council to enter its reserves at Seawell and No 7 villages and catch
such stray animals as he could find trespassing on those reserves for
the period mentioned in the authority. His authority is derived from
section 102(2) of the Local Government Act, set out above. 

 Sancho’s
authority directly originates from the language of section 102(2)
above, viz the words “or by any person authorised in writing by the local authority” which expression (by virtue of
section 5(1) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act) is to be
construed disjunctively and not as implying similarity, i e with the
words in the preceding genus of section 102(2). I think that this means to say that, apart from
any officer as expressed in the foregoing genus ,
the village council may authorise any stray animal-catcher in writing
to seize and impound animals of the kind indicated at the nearest
police pound. Section 42 of the Local Government Act authorises the
local authority to employ servants; but in my view this appears to
assume that a valid contract of service must have come into
existence. See Co Litt 49 b ,
52 b ,
113 a ,
181 b : 




‘ A
mere, bare or naked authority is an authority which exists only for
the benefit of the principal, and which, therefore, the agent must
execute in accordance with his directions, as opposed to an authority
coupled with an interest where the person vested with the authority
has a right to exercise it partly or wholly, for his own benefit.’ 




 It
appears to me the village council’s authority constituted neither a
valid contract of service nor a contract for services in relation to Sancho and the village council, because there
was no contract in the proper sense obliging him to impound strays found trespassing on the village council’s
reserves at Seawell and No 7 villages. The authority was only in the
nature of a loose agreement granting a permission or licence to
Sancho to do what he would otherwise have had no authority to do. In
the words of Vaughan CJ, spoken over 300 years ago (see Thomas v Sorrell (1673) 

 256 

 Vaugh
330 at page 351): 




‘ A
dispensation or licence properly passeth no interest, nor alters or
transfers property in anything, but only makes an action lawful,
which without it had been unlawful.’ 




 And
even if it can be said that there was an implied arrangement between
the parties to remunerate Sancho for his services, as the judge
thought, by letting him keep the reward paid him by the pound-keeper,
the village council clearly did not purport to exercise any power of
control over him in the manner in which he should exercise his
calling of taking the strays to the pound. As I said, the
“agreement” between the parties was only in the nature of a bare
licence or permission; it conferred no grant and could, without legal
obligation, be withdrawn at will. 

 In
deciding whether a man is a servant or an independent contractor, I
can think of no better authority to consult, particularly when the
relationship rests upon a written document, than the judgment of
McCardie J in Performing Right Society Ltd v Mitchell [1924] 1 KB 762. In that case, the defendants were occupiers of a
dance-hall and engaged a five-piece band to provide the necessary
music. The agreement between the defendants and the band provided
that the band would not infringe any copyright and that, if they did
so, they would be liable for damages and costs occasioned by such
infringement. Without the knowledge of the defendants the band
played music which infringed the plaintiffs’ copyright. It was
held that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages and an injunction
against the defendants because, at the material time, the members of
the band were the defendants’ servants and were acting in the
course of their employment. The question of master and servant was
dependent on the true construction of the written contract between
the defendants and the performing band, and the determination of the
problem whether the performing band was a servant or independent
contractor in the employ of the defendants was so well analysed by
the judge that I consider that I might perhaps be excused if I set
out at some length his account of how he approached the matter. He
said ([1924] 1 KB at page 766): 




‘ It
seems convenient, when examining the agreement with the band, to
consider the tests to be applied in deciding whether a man be a
servant or an independent contractor. Those words have been
discussed in many cases. Definition has been difficult: see Macdonell’s Master and Servant (2nd Edn) page 9. The word ‘servant’ has been used in many
aspects and in many statutes. Here we are freed from any question of
the context or purpose of an Act of Parliament. The case is to be
decided on general principles. The decisions are numerous and not
always easy to follow. The distinction between ‘servant’ and
‘independent contractor’ does not seem to rest merely on the
magnitude of the task undertaken. Thus, whilst a labourer employed
to cleanse drains at 5s for the job was held to be 

 257 

 a
servant and not a contractor: see Sadler v Henlock (1855)4 E&amp;B 570, a plumber called in by a landlord to mend a
leaky cistern was held to be an independent contractor and not a
servant: see Blake v Woolf [1898] 2 QB 426. A licensed drover has been held to be an
independent contractor and not a servant: see Milligan v Wedge (1840) 12 Ad&amp;El 737, on the ground that he exercised an
independent calling. So, too, in Rapson v Cubitt (1842) 9 M&amp;W 710 a gas fitter was held to be an independent
contractor. On the other hand, I conceive that a general manager, at
a high salary, of a partnership, or the managing director of a
limited company at an even higher salary, are usually servants and
not independent contractors, and in many cases a partnership or a
limited company has been liable for their negligence or breach of
duty. The word ‘salary’ may be as applicable to a servant as the
word ‘wages’, for the use of the word ‘salary’ in only a
matter of fashion and etiquette: see per Lord Sumner in Great Western Railway Co v Bater [1922] 2 AC 1, and see also Moriarty v Regent’s Garage [1921] 2 KB 766 and Re Countess of Rosse (1923) 93 LJ Ch 8. The nature of the task undertaken, the freedom of
action given, the magnitude of the contract amount, the manner in
which it is to be paid, the powers of dismissal and the circumstances
under which payment of the reward may be withheld, all these bear on
the solution of this question. But it seems clear that a more
guiding test must be secured. In Macdonnell’s Master and Servant (2nd Edn) page 7, a servant is defined as ‘one who for a
consideration agrees to work subject to the orders of another’. 
This is useful but not, I venture to think, complete. The following
words from Smith’s Master and Servant (7th Edn) page 238, give point to that remark: ‘The employer (i e
of an independent contractor) may nevertheless reserve to himself by
contract general rights of watching the progress of the works which
the contractor has agreed to carry out for him, of deciding as to the
quality of materials and workmanship, of stopping the works or any
part thereof at any stage, and modifying and altering them, and of
dismissing disobedient or incompetent workmen employed by the
contractor, and yet he will not thereby of necessity render himself
liable to third persons for the negligence of the contractor in
carrying out the works’. I may refer to Reedie v London and North Western Railway Co (1849) 4 Exch 244, Steel
v South Eastern Railway Co (1855) 16 CB 550 (a striking case); and Hardaker v Idle District Council [1896] 1 QB 335. That passage in Smith’s Master and Servant shows the difficulty of decision in certain cases. It seems,
however, reasonably clear that the final test, if there be a final
test, and certainly the test to be generally applied, lies in the
nature and degree of detailed control over the person alleged to be a
servant. This circumstance is, of course, one only of several to be
considered, but it is usually of vital importance. The point is put
well in Pollock on Torts (12th Edn) pages 79, 80: ‘The relation of master and servant exists
only between persons of whom the one has the order and control of the
work done by the other. A master is one who not only prescribes to 

 258 

 the
workman the end of his work, but directs or at any moment may direct
the means also, or, as it has been put, ‘retains the power of
controlling the work’: see per Crompton J in Sadler v Henlock (1855) 4 E&amp;B 570. A servant is a person subject to the command
of his master as to the manner in which he shall do his work: see per Bramwell LJ in Yewens v Noakes (1880) 6 QBD 530, and the master is liable for his acts, neglects and
defaults, to the extent to be specified. An independent contractor
is one who undertakes to produce a given result, but so that in the
actual execution of the work he is not under the order or control of
the person for whom he does it, and may use his own discretion in
things not specified beforehand’. The rule is stated in much the
same way in Salmond’s Law of Torts (6th Edn) page 96, where that able jurist says: ‘A servant is an
agent who works under the supervision and direction of his employer;
an independent contractor is one who is his own master’; and he
illustrates his statement as follows: ‘Thus, my coachman is my
servant, and if by negligent driving he runs over someone in the
street, I am responsible. But the cabman whom I engage for a
particular journey is not my servant; he is not under my orders; he
has made a contract with me, not that he will obey my directions, but
that he will drive me to a certain place; if an accident happens by
his negligence he is responsible, and not I’. I need not here
mention the cases quoted by the author on the points he is dealing
with. So, in like fashion also is the matter dealt with in Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (7th Edn) pages 65, 66, where it is added: ‘Those agents of the
former class whose employment is more or less continuous are usually
styled servants, whilst those whose employment is intermittent or
confined to a particular occasion, are usually called by the generic
name of agents. Between servants, however, and other agents over
whom the employer reserves control, there is no distinction in point
of law; the employer is liable for the torts of the one to the same
extent and subject to the same conditions as he is liable for the
torts of the other’. I need only refer further to the words of
Bowen LJ in Donovan v Laing, Wharton and Down Construction Syndicate Ltd [1893] 1 QB 629. They are these: ‘By the employer is meant the
person who has a right at the moment to control the doing of the
act.’ This judgment of Bowen LJ was approved by the Privy Council
in Bain v Central Vermont Railway Co [1921] 2 AC 412. It is not without interest to observe that much the
same rule prevails in criminal as in civil law, and many of the
decisions are instructive. I need only make reference to Archbold’s Criminal Pleading (26 Edn) pages 601, 612, and to the judgment of Blackburn J in R v Negus (1873) LR 2 CCR 34 where he says: ‘The test is very much this, viz
whether the person charged (that is, as a clerk or servant) is under
the control and bound to obey the orders of his master. He may be so
without being bound to devote his whole time to this service; but if
bound to devote his whole time to it, that would be very strong
evidence of his being under control’.’ 




 259 

 In Sattaur v Rupununi Development Co Ltd [1952] LRBG 113, cited during the argument, the headnote reads: 




‘ The
defendant company received at New Amsterdam, a shipment of fourteen
cows from their Rupununi ranch. An independent contractor, in
conformity with their usual practice, took delivery of the animals
and a servant of his was driving them along the highway when a steer
attacked and injured the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed damages
for personal injuries on the ground of neligence and alternatively
statutory negligence, to wit, a breach of the New Amsterdam Town
Council Ordinance. The principal defence was that the animals were
in charge of an independent contractor. 

 It
was held - The defendant’s animals were in charge of an independent
contractor but as the work contracted to be done was necessarily
dangerous and from its nature likely to cause danger to others the
defendant company should have ensured that precautions were taken by
the independent contractor to prevent such danger. As the defendant
company had failed to do this it was liable.’ 




 If
only for the reason that in both Sattaur’s and the instant case, there are situations where cattle-drovers were
in charge of animals that occasioned damage to third parties, one
might be tempted to say the ratio decidendi is coincident, and they are on all-fours with each other; but that is
not so. The fact remains that it is impossible to say in both cases
that both cattle-drovers were employed as independent contractors. 
It is not possible to agree with the trial judge that, even if Sancho
were an independent contractor, he would still be liable for the
reason that he was engaged to do something dangerous which the
village council could not legally delegate to him. To my mind, it
all goes back to what McCardie J said in the Performing Right Society Ltd case [1924] 1 KB 762 at page 766, that (in the event of the
relationship resting upon a written document only) the matter is
primarily one of law, and the writing must be construed in the light
of the relevant circumstances. So while there was a contract in the true sense of the word, i e one creating legal obligations and
relations between the parties, in Sattaur’s and the Performing Right Society Ltd cases, there was no such contract in the instant case creating a
binding obligation between the parties. 

 The
practical result of my reaching this conclusion is far-reaching in so
far as the village council is concerned. It means in theory of law
that Sancho’s negligence in driving the herd in darkness along the
highway cannot affect the village council with liability. The
conclusion at which the trial judge ought to have arrived is that
only Sancho could, in law, have been responsible for the damage done
to the plaintiff’s motor lorry. 

 But
there is another side to the case which went unobserved, and it is so
patent on the record. There is evidence on the record of
contributory negligence on the part of the driver of the plaintiff’s
lorry. There is no rule or principle which lays it down that a
defendant who 

 260 

 does
not take the trouble to respond to a writ of summons when it is duly
served on him must be taken to have admitted and so be liable for
everything that has been pleaded by the plaintiff. Counsel for the
village council has made it clear to us that, although the village
council is disclaiming liability ,
it is not disputing the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiff. But I strongly doubt whether a
finding of liability, the defendant being absent from court, would,
invariably justify an award of the entirety of the damages claimed. 
Speaking for myself, I do not think so. As I see it, even though a
defendant be absent from court and has not pleaded to the statement
of claim, the court owes him a duty; it must protect him
notwithstanding, and can never be justified in awarding the maximum
of a claim against him for negligence unless it takes into account
such acts of contributory negligence as appear on the record which,
had the defendant entered appearance, he would most likely have
pleaded in defence. 

 Pleadings,
of course, are (strictly speaking) a guide to the court in framing
issues. The whole object of them is to bring the parties to a clear
issue and thus to ensure that they both know (before the action comes
on for trial) what is the real point to be discussed and decided. 

 In
the instant case, the plaintiff charged the defendant stray-catcher
and another with being negligent in the handling of the animals in
his care and control, and so pleaded. The defendant stray-catcher
was in default of appearance and so did not plead. There appears
clear evidence on the record, however, that the plaintiffs driver was
himself negligent in bringing about, and so increasing, the damages
he claims from the defendant stray-catcher. It seems to me that the
duty of the trial judge was clearly to have taken the plaintiff’s
driver’s own negligence on record into account in assessing the
damages which the plaintiff will become entitled to receive,
notwithstanding the absence of any pleading of contributory
negligence. Failure to do so for the reason that there is no
pleading of contributory negligence from an absent defendant, will
assuredly result in the plaintiff benefiting by his driver’s
wrongdoing. 

 That
we have the power to make an order in the interest of justice and to
do what the trial judge ought to have done, I cannot doubt; see
section 7(1)( a )
and (2) of the Court of Appeal Act, which provides as follows: 




‘ (1)
On the hearing of an appeal from any order of the High Court in any
civil cause or matter the Court of Appeal shall have power to - ( a )
confirm, vary, amend, or set aside the order or make any such order
as the court from whose order the appeal is brought might have made,
or to make any order which ought to have been made, and to make such
further or other order as the case may require; ... 

 (2)
The powers of the Court of Appeal under the foregoing provisions of
this section may be exercised notwithstanding that no notice of
appeal or respondent’s notice has been given in respect of any
particular part of the decision of the court from whose order the
appeal is brought or by any particular party to the proceedings in
that court, 

 261 

 or
that any ground for allowing the appeal or for affirming or varying
the decision of that court is not specified in such a notice; and
the Court of Appeal may make any order, on such terms as the court
thinks just, to ensure the determination on the merits of the real
question in controversy between the parties .’ 

 The
driver of the Bedford lorry said that he was proceeding west on the
southern side of the Industry public road approaching Wind Dam at a
speed of 40 to 48 kill p h when he saw many cows spread out for a
distance of 55 metres. They were on the southern parapet of the road
and at the time when he first saw them, he was some 55 to 57 metres
away. Sancho was then riding a horse on the northern side of the
road but, as he rode across southwards in an attempt to head off some
that were entering Wind Dam, he swung the horse round and about. 
This manoeuvre cause the animals to stampede wildly and to rush on to
the lorry and caused damage to it. Eight cows died as a result of
the impact; the lorry’s steering broke loose and the brakes seized;
control was lost and the lorry ended up in 8 feet of water in a
nearby trench. The entire machine was a wreck. Under
cross-examination the driver revealed he had reduced his speed from
48km p h to 24 km p h. In my judgment, however, supposing the driver
did do so, but this seems exceedingly doubtful, a reduction of speed
from 48 to 24 km p h was obviously not enough in the circumstances .
 According to the driver, when he first saw Sancho on the northern
side of the road the distance between him and the lorry was about 51
to 55 metres. Therefore it is inconceivable that he could have seen
Sancho without seeing the animals at one and the same time. If
I am right, I am forced to conclude that he should have stopped his
lorry when he saw the stampeding animals, for out of his own mouth
that was an admission of contributory negligence because, by
inference, there was enough distance and time to do so .
 As Lord Greene MR said in Laurie v Raglan Building Co Ltd [1941] 3 All ER 332 at page 336: 




‘ If
roads are in such a condition that a motor car cannot safely proceed
at all, it is the duty of the driver to stop. If the roads are in
such a condition that it is not safe to go at more than a foot pace,
his duty is to proceed at a foot pace.’ 




 At
all times it is the duty of a driver of a motor vehicle to adjust his
speed to prevailing road conditions. I think that is the lesson
intended by Lord Greene MR; but
the driver of the plaintiffs Bedford lorry did not stop, and for that
reason I consider him guilty of contributory negligence .
 The possibility of danger ought to have been reasonably apparent to
the driver when he was faced with the likelihood of a collision with
a large herd of stampeding animals. I
think that the driver was negligent in not taking the precaution of
slowing down his lorry to a walking pace or stopping it altogether .
 Had he stopped or effectively reduced the speed of his lorry, the
impact caused by the combined effect of two opposing forces in
forward motion would have been considerably lessened and so the 

 262 

 damage
to his lorry would have been reduced. Justice demands that he should
not receive compensation for his own fault. 

 Negligence
is the failure to take reasonable care and he was wanting in that
regard. Thus, whether in any case a driver has been negligent is a
decision on the facts of the particular case, but there exists the
principle of the duty to take precautions. So long as - 




‘ the
possibility of danger emerging is reasonably apparent, then to take
no precautions is negligence; but if the possibility of danger
emerging is only a mere possibility which would never occur to the
mind of a reasonable man, then there is no negligence in not having
taken extraordinary precautions.’ 




 See per Lord Dunedin in Fardon v Harcourt-Rivington [1932] All ER Rep 81 at page 83; also Shalim Ghanie v Bookers Shipping (Demerara) Ltd (1970) 15 WIR 403. 

 In
the instant case the emergence of danger was not a mere possibility
but a reasonable probability. 

 In
my view a reasonable man, placed in the position of the lorry driver,
woud have stopped his vehicle in the circumstances. With some 60 to
70 animals stampeding on the highway, stopping or slowing down to a
walking pace was the only thing for a reasonable driver to do. 
Examining the record, I have found that he had adequate time to do
so. On the driver’s own testimony, he must have been proceeding at
a speed far in excess of the 24 km p h that he swore he was making,
because after killing eight cows “the lorry went on for a distance
of about 5¼ rods” (some 18 km) “after the impact before ending
up in the trench”. I would therefore hold that the village council
not liable vicariously, and assess the respective degrees of fault on
a 50-50 basis between the plaintiff and Sancho, the stray-catcher. 
The village council’s appeal must be allowed with costs, and Sancho
will bear one-half the damages awarded, ie $12,925. 

 30th
January. On the very next day after judgment was handed down in this
matter, the case Fookes v Slaytor [1979] 1 All ER 137, came to hand for the first time. It is a
decision of the English Court of Appeal and appears to be clear
authority for the view that, unless contributory negligence is
pleaded by a defendant, there will be no issue between the parties
and, consequently, no basis on which a trial court can apportion
degrees of fault so as to enable it to arrive at the quantum of damages to award the parties. 

 The
short facts as they appear from the headnote of the case are that on
a dark night a motor vehicle driven by the plaintiff ran into the
rear of an unlighted articulated vehicle parked by the roadside. As
a result, the plaintiff sustained personal injuries. He brought an
action for damages against the driver of the articulated vehicle,
claiming that he had been negligent. The defendant filed no defence,
even though ordered to do so by the court; and was accordingly
debarred from 

 263 

 defending
the action. He was given notice of the date and time of the hearing
of the action, but did not attend. The judge found that the
plaintiff was one-third to blame for the accident and reduced the
damages accordingly. 

 The
plaintiff appealed, contending that the judge was not entitled to so
find because contributory negligence had not been pleaded. The Court
of Appeal held that the defence of contributory negligence was only
available if it had been pleaded. It followed that, in the absence
of a pleading by the defendant of contributory negligence, the judge
had no jurisdiction to make a finding of such negligence on the part
of the plaintiff. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the
plaintiff awarded the full amount of the damages. 

 The
first observation I make on Fookes v Slaytor is that the case does not appear to lay down any invariable rule of
pleading, but it is intended (like the Scottish precedent that it
followed) that it should be restricted to “ the
peculiar circumstances of this case ”. 

 The
second and equally important observation is that the decision is not
based on any admissions, as in the instant case, in the plaintiff’s
evidence from which it could be seen from the manner in which he
conducted himself that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory
negligence. In my view, there lies the crucial difference between Fookes v Slaytor and the instant case. 

 I
will readily agree that if an absent defendant pleads contributory
negligence an issue clearly arises, his absence notwithstanding. 
But, I ask, will not that issue also arise if a plaintiff has
virtually admitted being contributorily negligent or is forced, as he
has been in the instant case, to make such admissions in
cross-examination and thus impels the trial judge to that conclusion?
 Speaking for myself, I would think so. As I understand it, the
decision in Fookes v Slaytor was not based on any crucial admission of facts elicited from the
plaintiff under cross-examination as in the instant case. It was
based simply on the fact that no issue was capable of being framed on
the pleadings because the defendant had not pleaded. 

 Section
9(1) of our Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (very much like
its English counterpart, the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act
1945, on which it is modelled) is in the following words: 




‘ Where
any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and
partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in
respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault
of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in
respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks
just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the
damage .’ 




 So
on the very words of the statute, the plaintiffs “share in the
reponsibility for the damage” must not be overlooked; it must be
brought to book, notwithstanding that the plaintiff himself has been 

 264 

 negligent.
 Formerly, he could not recover if he were negligent. I am wholly in
agreement with Sir David Cairns that the above wording of the Act
“leaves open the question of whether the court can only make a
finding of contributory negligence if there is a plea to that effect”
(see [1979] 1 All ER at page 138). It is, however, clear to me on a
fair reading of his Judgment, that it was not Sir David’s intention
that Fookes v Slaytor should conclusively decide this “open question” for all time and
for all cases, i e wherever there is an absent defendant who has
failed to plead contributory negligence. That is how I understand
his decision. Just as in the Scottish decision, Taylor
v Simon Carves Ltd 1958 SLT (Sh Ct) 23, the sheriff-substitute restricted himself to
“the peculiar circumstances of this case”; so did Sir David
Cairns when he said [1979] 1 All ER at page 140): 




‘ It
appears to me that, with all respect to judge McDonnell, it was not
right ‘ in
this case ’
to treat the matter as if there were a plea of contributory
negligence before the court. That seems to me to be the rule in
relation to procedure.’ 




 We
have, however, closed the question in the name of justice, because in
the instant case we think it is right so to “treat the matter”. 

 Clearly,
Sir David Cairns confined his decision to the particular case before
him. And rightly so, I think, because (unlike in the instant case)
there was no admission of negligence either in the plaintiffs
evidence-in-chief or in his cross-examination (as there is in the
instant case). 

 As
the English Court of Appeal said, Judge McDonnell did not appear to
address his mind to whether the issue of contributory negligence
arose. “There is no indication in his Judgment,” said the Court
of Appeal, “as to the view he took about it [the issue]”. It is
implied that he rejected it because he simply said ([1979] 1 All ER at page 138): 




‘ I
reach the conclusion that the plaintiff must have been contributorily
negligent and that the blame for the accident should be apportioned
as to one-third to the plaintiff and two-thirds to the defendant.’ 




 As
I see it, once a plaintiff claims that the defendant is negligent and
the plaintiff appears on record to admit his own negligence either in
chief or in cross-examination, then ( ex
lege )
a clear issue arises, notwithstanding the absence of a plea of
contributory negligence on the part of the defendant. In that case,
I think that the trial judge would be entirely justified in
apportioning degrees of fault. It is evident in the instant case in
which there were two defendants one of whom was absent, there was a
difference from Fookes v Slaytor [1979] 1 All ER 137 where there was only one defendant. However, in
both cases, the absent defendants had failed to plead contributory
negligence. In Fookes’s case, however, there was no admission of negligence and, if that case
is intended to lay down all invariable rule to the contrary, then I
must respectfully disagree with it, for the reason that it would
posit a rule tending to do injustice; although, as I have said, I do
not think that it 

 265 

 was
the intention to do so. 

 I
hope from what I have said, I shall not be understood as intending in
any way to impair the utility of pleadings as a means of demarcating
issues for trial, or to belittle the principle of it; pleadings,
although useful, are not indispensably necessary for the decision in
a case, once an issue is otherwise discernible. It is a fact that
today strict adherence to the rules of pleadings, like the forms of
action, is not as demanding as it once used to be. So long as the
issues are discernible from pleaded material facts, notwithstanding
the absence of an allegation of “contributory negligence” as
such, a court of trial must not permit that defect to defeat the
rights of the parties; but must pay due respect to the maxim that
no-one should benefit from his own wrongdoing. A trial court will
always, on request and subject to an award of costs, permit an
amendment to the pleadings so as to include an allegation of
contributory negligence or, in the interests of justice, decide the
case without that allegation so long as the issue is clear on the
record. 

 Take
the case of an estoppel. Every lawyer should know that that plea,
like one of contributory negligence, should be pleaded by a
defendant. The case Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd [1967] 1 All ER 518 is, however, to the effect that, in the case of
estoppel by conduct, failure to plead it expressly is not necessarily
fatal to the defence. In that case Diplock LJ said (at page 528): 




‘ In
the event I agree with Russell LJ that the plaintiff is estopped by
his conduct from denying the defendants’ title to the car. As the
defendants were unaware that he intended a sham, it
would be a travesty of justice if he were not ,
and in view of the terms in which this claim is pleaded, I do not
think that the defendants are debarred from relying, if it be
necessary, on this estoppel, although it is not expressly pleaded as such in the
defence. All the facts necessary to establish it were proved .’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 I
think that the italicised words in the above passage from the
judgment of Diplock LJ are of crucial significance in all cases of
unpleaded estoppels in pais ,
and, I would add, of unpleaded contributed negligence, as in the
instant case. I think that the guiding light for the court to follow
in such cases is the cause of justice and not as Fookes’s case appears to lay down, on whether an issue is disclosed on the
pleadings. It needs no emphasis in stating that it would be
manifestly unjust if the plaintiff in the instant case were to be
awarded the full amount of damages claimed when, on his driver’s
own admission, he has been clearly guilty of contributory negligence. 

 So
I regard the English case Fookes v Slaytor [1979] 1 All ER 137 as distinguishable on its own facts. I do not
understand that decision as intending to lay down any
incontrovertible rule of law that contributory negligence” must be pleaded in all cases before liability can properly be apportioned between tortfeasors. As
I see it, if the court is satisfied on the material before it (as in Snook v London and West Riding 

 266 

 Investments
Ltd [1967] 1 All ER 518, i e of an estoppel by conduct) that the
justice of the case is involved and must be attended to
notwithstanding that there is no such plea, then damages may be
apportioned regardless of the absence of the pleading. The court
must then proceed with the apportionment, for justice demands that
nobody should stand to profit by his own wrongdoing. Nemo
ex suo delicto meliorem suam conditionem facere potest is a maxim that is deeply rooted in the law and must be applied. 

 So
what we decided yesterday must be considered to be in no way in
conflict with, or qualified by, what Fookes v Slaytor has decided. 

 Fung-a-Fatt
JA. I agree with Crane C’s decision in its entirety. 

 Gonsalves-Sabola
JA. Round about dawn on 29th April 1977, the plaintiff’s lorry, driven
by John Samaroo, was travelling west from Port Mourant towards New
Amsterdam. When it reached the No 19 public road it became involved
in an accident with an approaching herd of cows which were being
driven along the same road by a stray-catcher on horseback en route to the pound at the Albion police station. The stray-catcher was
Patrick Sancho. By reason of Sancho’s manoeuvring his horse in an
attempt to turn back some of the cows which were straying on to a dam
branching southwards from the public road, the animals panicked and
scattered over the highway. The cows were estimated to number about
60 to 70. Several of them passed the on-coming lorry, but others
collided with it and so damaged its steering and braking mechanism
that the driver lost control of the lorry and it careered down the
southern parapet of the road and ended up in a trench containing
water. Considerable damage was done to the lorry. The upshot of
this accident was that a suit was brought against the village council
of East Coast Berbice Village District and Sancho by Shambool Hoosain
for damages for negligence. 

 The
citation of the village council as a defendant was inspired by the
fact that Sancho was the holder of a written authority from the
village council “to impound all strays found on local authority
reserves at Seawell and No 7 villages, for the year ending 1977”. 
On the strength of that writing, the stray-catcher Sancho, in the
action brought by the plaintiff, was alleged to be a servant or agent
of the village council. Sancho declined to enter an appearance to
the writ, or to take any part in the hearing of the action; but the
village council did both. At the hearing it called no evidence,
relying on the evidence of the witnesses of the plaintiff as
supporting its defence that Sancho was an independent contractor and
not a servant of the village council. The trial judge, in a
thoughtful judgment, held Sancho to have been a servant of the
village council and, further, that (even if Sancho were not a servant
but an independent contractor) the village council was still liable
at common law for his gross neligence because the task Sancho was
engaged by the village council to perform gave rise to an exception
to the rule that an 

 267 

 employer
is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor. The
plaintiffs contention was that the task to be performed involved
danger or potential danger, and a non-delegable duty of care to users
to the public road was cast upon the village council as employer. 
Acting on his view of the legal position, the trial judge gave
judgment for the plaintiff and awarded damages against both
defendants jointly and severally. The village council appealed to
this court from the decision of the trial Judge. Understandably,
Sancho, no doubt a stray-catcher of exiguous means with nothing to
lose or gain from participation in the instant proceedings, remained
aloof from them. 

 The
defendants did not challenge on the appeal the trial judge’s
finding of negligence against Sancho, nor the quantum of damages awarded. The real live issue raised in the several
grounds of appeal could be put in a nutshell: was the village council
liable for the negligence of the stray-catcher on any principle of
law? 

 The
trial judge decided that Sancho was a servant of the village council
although he received no remuneration from the village council and
despite the lack of control by the village council over the manner in
which he worked as a stray-catcher. The trial judge put it this way: 




‘ Sancho
obtains a living by catching strays within the boundaries of the
village council’s district which extends from No 1 to No 37
village. This incident took place at No 7 village, clearly within
those confines. He is paid $5 for each animal impounded, but he is
only entitled to receive this remuneration by virtue of the village
council’s written authority in accordance with section 102(2) of
the Act. It is to be noted that the village council’s authority
and Sancho’s right to seize and impound is governed by section 102
of the Local Government Act and not by sections 4 and 6 of the Pounds
Act. Section 4 relates to the impounding of strays found on private
premises, whilst section 6 relates to the impounding of strays found
on public premises or land ( other
than a public road or bridge ).
 To that extent, therefore, Sancho’s power and authority to seize
and impound are limited. I am inclined to agree with Mr Persaud that
it is the village council who should properly receive the fees for
impounded strays and not the person so authorised by them. If Sancho
had been paid a fixed wage, it could not be expected that he would
also receive pound fees, and his right or privilege to receive such
fees was clearly a matter of agreement, express or implied, between
himself and the village council.’ 




 Authorities
were duly cited by counsel for the defendants illustrating the
well-known common law test of a contract of service, and
distinguishing a servant from an independent contractor. On the
record the only oral evidence that tended to show that Sancho was a
servant came from Sankar Rajkumar who was, at the material time, the
assistant overseer of the village council. In his evidence-in-chief
he said: “Cows were impounded for the local authority by one
Patrick Sancho. He was employed by the local authority as a
stray-catcher”. In cross-examination, 

 268 

 Rajkumar
answered: 




‘ Sancho
did not receive pay from the local authority. He was paid by the
police whenever he impounded strays. The local authority never
supervised Sancho whenever he impounded animals caught by him
straying.’ 




 The
asseverations by Rajkumar in his evidence-in-chief about Sancho’s
impounding for and his employment by the local authority stand
modified to the point of virtual retraction in cross-examination. 
Rajkumar’s testimony-in-chief on the point reveals uninformed, even
if honest, inferences that were really inferences of law drawn by him
from the facts he swore in evidence. This court is in as good a
position as the trial judge to arrive at the conclusions of law
justified by those facts. Counsel for the plaintiff conceded, and
rightly so, that the use of the word “employed” by Rajkumar could
not be relied on to establish a contract of service between Sancho
and the village council. Therefore the plaintiff must now place
reliance exclusively on the village council’s written authority to
Sancho as constituting a contract between them. 

 On
the question whether Sancho was in law a servant of the village
council, it is necesary to construe section 102(2) of the Local
Government Act, because it is on the construction of that provision
that the trial judge held him to be a servant. That section reads as
follows: 




‘ Any
animal grazing or straying on any place mentioned in subsection (1),
may be seized and impounded by any member of the police force or of
the rural constabulary, or by any officer of the local authority, or
by any person authorised in writing by the local authority.’ 




 What
the legislature has done in section 102(2) is to specify four
categories of persons who may lawfully impound animals grazing or
straying in public places within the boundaries of the district of a
local authority. These categories are: (a) a member of the police
force; (b) a member of the rural constabulary; (c) an officer of the
local authority itself; and (d) any person authorised in writing by
the local authority. Each of these four categories is patently
different from any of the others by virtue of the repetitive
employment by the draftsman of the disjunctive “or” in itemising
them. A genus was not intended to be established: see the definition of the word
“or” in section 5(1) of the Interpretation and General Clauses
Act. 

 I
would also refer to the leading judgment in this court which Crane C
recently handed down in Badri Prasad v Demerara Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (1981), page 196, ante ,
which supports the general proposition that the interpretation of the
word “or” excludes the ejusdem generis rule unless the context, reflecting the intention of the legislature,
dictates otherwise. This is in keeping with section 4(1) of the
Interpretation and General Clauses Act, which reads thus: 




‘ Where
expressions are defined in or for the purposes of or used in 

 269 

 any
written law or public document, such expressions shall have the meanings assigned
to them, unless there is anything in the subject or context repugnant
to or inconsistent with such meaning.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 Section
3(2) of the Act makes it clear that section 4(1) applies to the Act
itself and therefore governs the meanings and constructions
prescribed in section 5(1). 

 Returning
to section 102(2) of the Local Government Act, the expression “any
person authorised in writing by the local authority” must be
construed disjunctively to exclude an “officer” of the local
authority. And Section 2 of the Act defines “officer” as
including “any person employed temporarily or otherwise by [the]
local authority to perform any duty”. Another pertinent section is
section 42 of the Act which provides: 




‘ Every
overseer, assistant overseer, clerk or other officer, and every
servant, shall receive the salary, remuneration, or wages assigned to
him by the local authority with the sanction of the Minister.’ 




 The
foregoing provisions of the Act, when read and construed together and
applied to the evidence led at the trial, would appear to deny Sancho
the status of officer or servant of the village council. But further
analysis is expedient to put the matter beyond doubt. 

 Nowhere
in any of the provisions referred to is it required or envisaged that
the rewards paid to persons authorised to impound strays should go to
anybody but those persons themselves. There is no provision
requiring the payment over of the reward to the local authority by an
impounder who is authorised tinder section 102(2) by the local
authority to impound strays found in any public place within the
boundaries of the district of the local authority. It is not without
some significance that the legislature chose the term “reward” in
referring to the money paid to the person impounding strays. The
trial judge’s view was that the reward was properly receivable by
the village council which, by express or implied agreement beween
itself and Sancho, allowed the latter to retain the money in lieu of
a fixed wage. In my opinion, not only does the evidence not support
this conclusion but it is hardly consistent with the precise
accounting procedures laid down in Part XI of the Local Government
Act. Those procedures embody the kind of scheme of financial
accounting and surveillance which is customary in public
administration at central and local government levels. Rewards paid
for impounding strays are, on the evidence in the case, paid by the
police to the person impounding and are completely outside this
accounting system. The system, in turn, makes no provision for
accounting to or by a local authority for the receipt of poundage
fees. Favour, therefore, cannot be found with the trial judge’s
inclination to agree that it is the village council that should
properly receive the fees for impounding strays. On the evidence and 

 270 

 according
to section 4 of the Pounds Act, the money is paid by the pound-keeper
directly to the impounder, obviously in payment for the service
personally rendered in restraining cattle trespassing in public
places. Some implied arrangement between the village council and
Sancho that Sancho, in lieu of being paid a fixed wage by the village
council, was entitled to receive the statutory reward which he earned
by impounding strays, is not in keeping with the scheme of financial
regularity prescribed in the Local Government Act and is too
unorthodox a business arrangement to be attributed to a local
authority so strictly regulated by statute in fiscal management. 

 No
disrespect is intended for the contrary view of the trial judge; but
to hold that Sancho was the servant of the village council merely
because the village council did what amounted to no more than
licensing him to impound strays, seems to stretch the concept of
master and servant beyond its legal limits. Clearly, Sancho was not
under the control of the village council in the performance of the
activity of impounding strays but, as was said by Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security [1969] 2 WLR 1 at page 8 - 




‘ I
think it is fair to say that there was at one time a school of
thought according to which the extent and degree of the control which
B was entitled to exercise over A in the performance of the work
would be a decisive factor. However, it has long been apparent that
an analysis of the extent and degree of such control is not in itself
decisive.’ 




 The
judge went on to refer to Somervell LJ in Ca sidy v Ministry of Health [1951] 2 KB 343 at page 352, and Lord Parker CJ in Morren v Swinton and Pendlebury Borough Council [1965] 1 WLR 576 at page 582, to show the inadequacy of the test of
control as the distinguishing feature of a contract of service. To
quote Cooke J again ([1969] 2 WLR at page 9): 




‘ If
control is not a decisive test, what then are the other
considerations which are relevant? No comprehensive answer has been
given to this question, but assistance is to be found in a number of
cases.’ 




 In Montreal v Montreal Locomotive Works Ltd [1947] 1 DLR 161 at page 169 Lord Wright said: 




‘ In
earlier cases a single test, such as the presence or absence of
control, was often relied on to determine whether the case was one of
master and servant, mostly in order to decide issues of tortious
liability on the part of the master or superior. In the more complex
conditions of modern industry, more complicated tests have often to
be applied. It has been suggested that a fourfold test would in some
cases be more appropriate, a complex involving (1) control; (2)
ownership of the tools; (3) chance of profit; (4) risk of loss. 
Control in itself is not always conclusive. Thus the master of a
chartered vessel is generally the employee of the shipowner though
the charterer can direct the 

 271 

 employment
of the vessel. Again the law often limits the employer’s right to
interfere with the employee’s conduct, as also do trade union
regulations. In many cases the question can only be settled by
examining the whole of the various elements which constitute the
relationship between the parties. In this way it is in some cases
possible to decide the issue by raising as the crucial question whose
business is it, or in other words by asking whether the party is
carrying on the business, in the sense of carrying it on for himself
or on his own behalf and not merely for a superior.’ 




 In Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart NV v Slatford [1953] 1 QB 248 at page 295 Denning LJ said: 




‘ The
test of being a servant does not rest now-a-days on submission to
orders. It depends on whether the person is part and parcel of the
organisation.’ 




 Cooke
J cited United States v Silk ,
331 US 704 (1946) which propounded that the test whether men were
“employees” under a certain statute was not “power of control,
whether exercised or not, over the manner of performing service to
the undertaking”, but whether the men were employees “as a matter
of economic reality”. 

 Blending
the dicta of Lord Wright, Denning LJ and the judges of the US Supreme Court,
Cooke J then suggested that the fundamental test to be applied was:
is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services
performing them as a person in business on his own account? 

 Sancho
falls completely to satisfy the Denning test in the Bank voor Handel case [1953] 1 QB at page 295 of being part and parcel of the
organisation, that is to say the establishment of the local
authority. 

 I
adopt and apply the neat test which Cooke J suggested was the
fundamental one to determine the existence of a contract of service:
was Sancho, as a duly authorised stray-catcher, in business on his
own account? My answer is in the affirmative. In the result, any
view of him as a servant of the village council is, by every test,
misconceived. 

 It
is but right that I should acknowledge that the reference to excerpts
from the judgment in the Market Investigations Ltd case [1969] 2 WLR 1 and the cases referred to therein, has been
lifted from the Full Court’s decision in Wieting&amp;Richter Ltd v Paul (unreported) where those authorities were considered and used as a
basis of the judgment of that court on a generally similar issue to
the one raised in this appeal. 

 The
trial judge, despite his holding Sancho to have been a servant,
considered that (even assuming that Sancho was an independent
contractor) the village council would still be liable at common law
for his negligence, since the case came within the exception where
the employer was liable for the negligence of an independent
contractor employed to perform a task involving danger or potential
danger. The judge applied the principle that, if a duty were cast on
the local authority 

 272 

 to
impound strays, that duty was not avoided by its employing someone
else to effect the impounding. If the person so employed was
negligent in the exercise, the local authority was answerable. 

 Two
questions arise: was the driving of strays on the public road to the
pound an activity that was necessarily dangerous? Assuming (though
not deciding) that it was, was the negligent Sancho an independent
contractor at all? If indeed Sancho was not an independent
contractor, a decision of the question whether or not his driving the
strays on the public road to the pound was an inherently dangerous
activity attracting the principle applied by Bell CJ in Sattaur v Rupununi Development Co Ltd [1952] LRBG 113, is academic. Therefore, let the second question be
considered first. 

 Since
all that the village council did was, as it were, to license Sancho
to impound strays (thereby bringing him within the fourth category of
persons authorised to impound under section 102(2) of the Local
Government Act) there would be some difficulty in perceiving Sancho
as being, in a legal sense, an independent contractor to the village
council. On first principles a condition precedent to a person being
an independent contractor is the existence of a contract whereunder
the contractor is employed by an employer to do some particular work.
 If Sancho were not employed by the village council at all but was merely authorised by that
council to go into business on his own account as a stray-catcher, an
essential feature of a contractual relationship between him and the
village council is absent. 

 If
no contractual relationship existed between Sancho and the village
council, the plaintiff’s last remaining hope of being able to fix
vicarious liability on the village council for Sancho’s negligence
begins to vanish. 

 The
existence or non-existence of a contract of any sort between the
village council and Sancho can be tested in another way. If there
existed a contract between them, breach of it by either party would
attract liability to suit at the instance of the other. Now, let us
suppose that (after Sancho was issued by the village council with the
written authority to impound) he suffered strays to roam at will over
the territory mentioned in his authority and refrained from
impounding them. Would the village council have been able to sue
Sancho for breach of contract? If the written authority is relied on
as a contractual document, does it evidence (as it should) the moving
of any consideration from either party to the other? Suppose the
village council had revoked the authority, could Sancho have sought
redress by way of a lawsuit claiming damages? These questions have
only to be posed to be immediately answered in the negative. The
inevitable conclusion is that the written authority lacked the legal
nature of a contract. 

 The
only provision of the Local Government Act which deals with the
subject of straying of animals is section 102(2). It carries a
marginal note in those very terms. An examination of its language
discloses that it does not cast upon the local authority a duty to impound strays. So far as the fourth category of persons in the
section is concerned, the village 

 273 

 council
is merely clothed with the power to give them permission to impound strays. The village council is no
different in the exercise of that power from any other licensing
authority. It would be ridiculous to suggest that such an authority
can be vicariously liable for the negligence a licensee commits
during the performance of the act licensed to be done. 

 Having
regard to the view taken with respect to the question of vicarious
liability, adjudication is rendered unnecessary on other grounds of
appeal argued. However, since the court had the benefit of full
argument on the admissibility in evidence of entries in the pound
book, it may be well to express the opinion which I have formed on
the question. It was argued that the pound book was not a public
document because the four criteria set out in Sturla v Freccia (1880) 5 App, Cas 623 and endorsed by R v Rawlins [1966] GLR 314 were not satisfied. It was contended that (in
particular) the condition that there should be a duty to inquire and
record was not fulfilled in the compilation of the pound book. That
book is kept in compliance with section 12(1) of the Pounds Act which
reads as follows: 




‘ Every
pound-keeper shall keep a book in which he shall enter the date when
each stray is received, the name of everyone sending it, and also the
name of the person taking or delivering it to the pound, with its
colour, description and marks, the place whence it was sent, and the
sum paid to the party impounding; and the book is open to inspection
by anyone during the day without fee.’ 




 On
a reasonable reading of the subsection, it requires the pound-keeper
to do precisely what counsel for the defendants argued that he had no
duty to do, namely to inquire and record. How else but by inquiry
would the pound-keeper be able to elicit and enter in his book the
specific data which he is enjoined, on pain of a fine, to compile
therein? Apart from section 12(1) of the Pounds Act, does the book
not satisfy the requirements of the Evidence Act relating to the
admissibility of public documents? Sections 46 and 47 of that Act
fall under a division thereof entitled “Proof of Public Documents”.
 Section 57(1) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act provides
as follows: 




‘ Where
any written law is divided into Parts, Titles or other divisions, the
fact and particulars of such divisions shall be taken notice of in all courts and for all purposes
whatsoever. ’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 So
if the pound book satisfies section 46 which (for present purposes)
should be read and construed in the light of section 47, it is a
public document and the entries made in it are admissible. The two
sections read as follows: 




‘ 46.
 Where, by this Act or by any other written law for the time being in
force, an authenticated or certified copy of any document is
admissible in evidence, the original document shall not, unless the
judge otherwise expressly orders, be received in evidence. 

 274 

 47.
 Any copy of or extract from any writing, document, or record in the
custody of any public officer, required by any written law to be
written or made and delivered to that officer or to be recorded, is,
if it purports to be signed and certified as a true copy or extract
by the officer to whose custody the original is entrusted, admissible
as proof of the contents of the writing, document or record, and
as prima facie evidence of the matter or transaction therein
mentioned. ’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 By
reason of the considerations just mentioned, I hold that the pound
book duly kept in accordance with section 12(1) of the Pounds Act is
a public document and its contents were admissible as proof thereof
and as prima facie evidence of the transactions recorded therein. 
This opinion involves the rejection of a submission to the contrary
effect made and strenuously argued by counsel for the defendants. 
The determination of this evidential point against the defendants
does not, of course, affect the outcome of the appeal, but it may
prove to be of utility to record a judicial opinion on it and the
reasoning by which it was arrived at because the serious debate it
engendered in this court tended to suggest that the question of what
constitutes a public document was not regarded as being free from
doubt. 

 It
is true that that issue of contributory negligence on the part of the
plaintiff’s driver was neither raised in the pleadings nor,
naturally, was the case fought out on that ground at the hearing. 
But the evidence called by the plaintiff discloses that there was
such negligence. Can this court ignore that fact in rendering its
Judgment in this appeal? Does the fact that Sancho did not defend
the action entitle the plaintiff in the court below to recover the
full global damages proved to have resulted from the damage done to
the plaintiffs lorry? 

 The
point is not entirely untouched by authority. In a running-down
action ( Jaikaran
v Sheik Zahoor Bacchus ,
unreported), Vieira J considered that it was not absolutely necessary
(but always advisable) to raise the issue of contributory negligence
specifically in the pleadings “once there is positive evidence of
facts that would or could amount to contributory negligence from
either or both sides”. What the judge was there dealing with was a
contested action in which (both on the pleadings and the arguments on
the question of damages) he held that the plea of contributory
negligence was raised “albeit indirectly”. He referred to The Owners of the SS Pleiades v Page [1891] AC 259 in which the Board of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council did not entertain the question of contributory
negligence in a case involving the collision of two ships. 
Contributory negligence was being raised for the first time before the Board. Lord Watson delivering the advice of the Board
said (at page 263): 




‘ The
point was not taken in the court below, where no reference was made
to the 18th article [of the Collision Regulations then in force]
either in the preliminary acts, the pleadings, the evidence, or in
the argument.’ 




 275 

 There
seems to be an underlying implication that the question of
contributory negligence, in a fit case naturally, is capable of
arising from the evidence and the argument; that is to say, dehors the pleadings. 

 There
is the case Fookes v Slaytor [1979] 1 All ER 137 decided by the English Court of Appeal which
unequivocally declares it to be the rule that contributory negligence
needs to be pleaded before it can be considered by the court. Now, a
decision of the English Court of Appeal, although not binding on this
court, is persuasive authority and unless its ratio decidendi (in the opinion of this court) is flawed, it would provide guidance
that would be heeded. When the reasoning in that case is analysed it
is discovered that the court acknowledged that - 




‘ There
appears to be no direct English authority on the question of whether
in the absence of a pleading of contributory negligence the court has
jurisdiction to make a finding that there was negligence on the part
of the plaintiff.’ 




 The
void was filled by extracting what their Lordships felt was the
principle yielded by a Scottish case thought to be directly on the
point, as well as two English authorities. 

 The
Scottish case was Taylor v Simon Carves Ltd 1958 SLT (Sh Ct) 23 where a civil jury were of the view that both
parties were to blame for all accident. The sheriff-substitute held
that the jury must be directed that if they found the defenders to
blame they must disregard any fault on the part of the pursuer. 
Section 1(1) of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945
(section 9(1) of our Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act) was
held not to require an apportionment of liability if contributory
negligence was not in issue between the parties. Indeed,
contributory negligence was not in issue for the simple reason that
the defenders’ counsel had intimated prior to opening his case that he was not insisting on a plea of contributory negligence .
 The sheriff-substitute spoke of an unreported case mentioned in the
arguments where a judge had allowed contributory negligence to go to
the jury although not pleaded; but there was no report of the case
available and the circumstances in which that was done were not
explained. The sheriff-substitute therefore expressly said: “I had
to decide the point on a reading of the subsection as applied to the peculiar
circumstances of this case ”.
 In view of this cautious and qualified statement it is not easy to
appreciate how the English Court of Appeal could be so confident that
this Scottish case “is directly on the point and is in favour of
the proposition on which the plaintiff relies here”. In the case
before their Lordships, the defendant did not deliver any defence and
was absent from the hearing, yet the trial judge reached the
conclusion that “the plaintiff must have been contributorily
negligent”. So, in procedural essentials, the case was on all
fours with the instant one. The English Court of Appeal referred to
the decision of Asquith J in Dann v Hamilton [1939] 1 KB 509, in which that judge rejected the defence of volenti non fit injuria where a plaintiff, 

 276 

 knowing
of a driver’s intoxication, had nevertheless chosen to travel by
his car. The judge had encouraged counsel for the defendant to amend
his pleadings to add the plea of contributory negligence. Counsel
declined to do so and the action was decided on the issue joined of volenti .
 Denning LJ in Slater v Clay Cross Co Ltd [1956] 2 All ER 625 (Birkett and Parker LJJ agreeing) approved
Asquith J’s decision in Dann v Hamilton in these words: 




‘ In
so far as he decided that the doctrine of volenti did not apply, I think the decision was quite correct. In so far as
he suggested that the plea of contributory negligence might have been
available, I agree with him.’ 




 Denning
LJ then proceeded to affirm the court’s agreement with the trial
judge’s apportionment of responsibility for the damage suffered by
the plaintiff and a reduction accordingly of the damages to which she
would otherwise have been entitled. 

 In Fookes v Slaytor [1979] 1 All ER 137 Sir David Cairns (speaking with the concurrence
of Orr and Stamp LJJ) interpreted the passage fron Denning LJ’s
judgment quoted above in these words (at page 140): 




‘ I
think by implication Denning LJ was saying in effect there that the
plea of contributory negligence would be available if, and only if,
it was pleaded.’ 




 I
beg with respect to differ. Denning LJ cannot fairly be understood
to have been dealing with a point of pleading. He was addressing a
point of substantive law, namely whether the facts of the case before
the Court of Appeal (as in Dann v Hamilton [1939] 1 KB 509) were capable of disclosing contributory negligence
in the plaintiff. Denning LJ could hardly have had in mind the
pleading aspect of the matter, for the simple reason that
contributory negligence was in fact pleaded in the defence. And in
giving his approbation to the decision of Asquith J in Dann v Hamilton on the point of contributory negligence, he saw fit to quote from a
note on the case written to the Law Quarterly Review by Asquith J himself explaining how at the trial the issue of
contributory negligence did not avail the defendant. The judge’s
encouragement of counsel to raise the issue was rebuffed. On
principle, the judge was right not to foist upon the defendant a
relief which her counsel deliberately declined to seek. The decision
in Fookes v Slaytor [1979] 1 All ER 137 purports to derive its ratio from the three cases discussed above. In my opinion, those cases do
not authorise a broad and absolute principle that a court can only
make a finding of contributory negligence if that plea is
specifically raised in the defence. Indeed, in the leading judgment
of Sir David Cairns the raison d’être of a specific plea of contributory negligence is explained (at page
140) as follows: 




‘ It
appears to me that, with all respect to Judge McDonnell, it was not
right in this case to treat the matter as if there were a plea of 

 277 

 Contributory
negligence before the court. That seems to me to be the rule in
relation to procedure. The
opposite view would mean that a plaintiff in any case where
contributory negligence might possibly arise, even though it was not
pleaded, would have to come to court armed with evidence that might
be available to him to rebut any allegation of contributory
negligence raised at the trial. ’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 A
plaintiff needs to be fore-warned so that he could be fore-armed. It
follows that, where a finding of contributory negligence necessarily
arises out of the evidence called on behalf of the plaintiff himself,
the reason for giving him notice of the plea is not applicable; cessante
ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex . 

 To
attribute to a rule of adjective law the capacity to transcend a rule
of substantive law (section 9(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act) in defiance of common sense and the patent
requirements of justice is to defeat the ends of justice themselves. 
The course taken by this court in the particular circumstances of the
case produces a result which avoids distortion of the merits by the
enforcement of an irrelevant general rule of pleading. 

 Section
9(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act provides: 




‘ Where
any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and
partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in
respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault
of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in
respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks
just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the
responsibility for the damage.’ 




 It
is my opinion that since the plaintiff’s own case showed that
section 9(1) was applicable, the trial judge ought to have applied
it, and (on his failure to do so) this court has power under section
7(1)( a )
of the Court of Appeal Act, “to make any order which ought to have
been made” by the trial judge. 

 I
therefore agree, for the reasons mentioned above, that the appeal
should be allowed and specifically agree with the conclusion reached
by Crane C as to the apportionment of responsibility for the damage
as between the plaintiff and Sancho. In the result, I agree with the
order which His Honour proposes in his judgment. 

 Appeal
allowed.

 Kerr
JA delivered the judgment of the Court. This was all appeal by each
defendant from conviction and sentence in the resident magistrate’s
court for the parish of Portland. The appellants were charged on an
indictment with - 




‘ conspiracy
to export foreign currency in contravention of the requirement
imposed by section 24(1)( a )
and contrary to paragraph 1(1) of part II of the Fifth Schedule to
the Exchange Control Act [for that they] on 27th July 1977 in the
Island conspired together and with other persons unknown to export
from the Island foreign currency amounting to US $2500 without the
permission of the Minister.’ 




 We
allowed the appeals and quashed the convictions; and promised to put
our reasons in writing. 

 On
Monday, 27th July 1977, the cruise ship The Norodic Prince arrived at
Port Antonio with tourists and docked at the Ken Wright pier. Among
the passengers were the appellant Mirchandani and her husband. They
disembarked and went sightseeing in Port Antonio and its environs
guided by the appellant Tolani, a family friend of many years who had
journeyed from Montego Bay for that purpose. Mirchandani returned by
car to the pier at about 5.00 p m. In the car were Tolani, a Mr
Vaswani and her husband. On duty at the pier were Sgt de Cardova
Hibbert, Sgt Christopher Barnaby and Sgt Stewart of the Financial
Intelligence Unit. 

 Sgt
Hibbert in evidence said that, while in the covered walkway which
leads from the road to the main terminal building of the pier, he saw
the car drive up with the appellants and two others including the
driver, Tolani. The driver came out and opened the back door for
Mirchandani. Sgt Stewart and Sgt Barnaby were then by the car, and
he saw Sgt Stewart speaking to her. Mirchandani and others went from
the car to the immigration section where Sgt Stewart asked to see
what was in her handbag; she opened it and he took therefrom a bundle
of US notes. 

 Sgt
Barnaby’s evidence was to the effect that he saw when the car
driven by Tolani arrived. Mirchandani was sitting at the left rear. 
Tolani went around and opened the door and when she came out he
handed her some money which she placed into a handbag which she was
carrying. He was then six or seven yards away. Sgt Stewart was
nearer and asked her for the money which Tolani gave her. She denied
receiving any money. On her opening the bag he saw a bundle of US
notes. He admitted in cross-examination that Mirchandani maintained
that the money was hers. 

 Sgt
Stewart in evidence said that he saw when Tolani, the driver of the
car, came out and went and opened the left rear door for Mirchandani
and, after she came out, Tolani handed her a bundle of notes which
she placed in her handbag; he was then about four yards away. Tolani
got back in the car and “sped away”. He spoke to Mirchandani in
the terminal building as she was going towards the ship; he cautioned
her 

 280 

 and
told her that he had seen Tolani hand her US currency. She denied
receiving any money. At his request she opened her handbag and in it
he saw a bundle of US notes (which he tendered and were admitted in
evidence). He arrested her for a breach of the Exchange Control Act.
 Mirchandani maintained that the money was hers and gave an accurate
account of how the amount was “made up”. On 29th July 1977, he
arrested Tolani on a warrant. 

 The
cross-examination of the police was aimed at challenging their
account as to the handing over of the money by Tolani. Tolani gave
evidence of journeying from Montego Bay to meet his old friends the
Mirchandanis, of showing them around Port Antonio and returning to
the pier with them. He drove to the entrance to the pier and, after
the passengers came out, he drove the car and parked it in the
parking lot; he went and shook hands with them and then returned to
the car and drove away. He left to buy gas. Fred Dawson, a gas
station operator, corroborated him concerning the purchase of petrol
at his station. Lashu Vaswani was the other person in the car. 
Vaswani gave evidence to the same effect. Tolani denied giving
Mirchandani any money, or of opening the door for her, or jumping in
the car and driving away. Mirchandani in evidence said that the
money in her handbag was hers. She got no money from Tolani. In
cross-examination she said that she had left Dubai on 7th July with
US $5000. She gave $2500 to her husband in London and kept the other
$2500, and that was the money which the police found in her handbag. 
In her tour (which had included New York, Montreal, Los Angeles, San
Juan, the Virgin Islands and Martinique) she had spent no money. 

 Mirchandani’s
husband corroborated her; he said that he had on him that day US
$13,000. 

 The
resident magistrate recorded the following findings: 




‘ (1)
I accept evidence of the sergeants that they saw money handed over by
Tolani to Mirchandani; (2) I reject completely the defence that any
one could have US $2500 in a handbag in that condition for
twenty-five days; and (3) I am satisfied beyond doubt that the
policeman saw what they say they saw.’ 




 For
each appellant, the following additional grounds were fully argued: 




‘ 1.
 The indictment charged is conspiracy to export United States
currency notes which is not the offence contemplated by section
24(1)( a )
of the Exchange Control Act. (a) It is submitted that section
24(1)( a )
of the Exchange Control Act imposes a restriction on the exportation
of the United Kingdom notes and not United States notes. (b) It is
further submitted that there can be no conspiracy to export United
States notes in contravention of section 24(1)( a )
of the Exchange Control Act.’ 




 In
relation to head 1(a) above, Mr Phipps submitted that the ejusdem 

 281 

 generis rule applied to the following words in section 24(1)( a ):
“In the United Kingdom or any part of the United Kingdom or in any
other territory” and, accordingly, the expression “any other
territory” was limited to the United Kingdom. In respect of head
1(b) above, that (in any event) a note is legal tender in a
particular territory by the law of that territory and in the instant
case there was no evidence of the foreign law making US dollar bills
legal tender. 

 The
Director of Public Prosecutions contended in reply that the ejusdem generis rule did not apply and that there was sufficient evidence from which
the resident magistrate could hold that a US dollar bill (like those
exhibited) was legal tender, not merely on the face of it but on the
presumption that the law of the United States (in the absence of
anything to the contrary) was the same as Jamaican law. In the
alternative, the bills fell under Section 24(1)( e )(iii)
of the provisions restricting the export of foreign Currency and a
simple amendment to the indictment would regularise the pleadings. 
Section 24(1) provides: 




‘ The
exportation from the Island of - ( a )
any notes of a class which are or have at any time been legal tender
in the United Kingdom or any part of the United Kingdom or in any
other territory; and ( b )
any notes of a class which are or have at any time been legal tender
in Jamaica; and ... ( e )
any of the following documents (including any such document which has
been cancelled), that is to say - ... (iii) any bill of exchange or
promissory note expressed in terms of a currency other than that of a
scheduled territory and payable otherwise than within the scheduled
territories; and ... 

 is
hereby prohibited except with the permission of the Minister.’ 




 The
Exchange Control Act like its English model and counterpart was the
successor to provisions of similar tenor and effect in the Jamaica
Defence Regulations 1939/1940. 

 In
December 1954 when the original Act (Law 50 of 1954) came into
effect, Jamaica was a colony, the monetary denomination was the pound
sterling, the Island was part of the Sterling Bloc and our rate of
exchange was tied to the English pound. Since then, in 1962 Jamaica
became an independent country; in 1969, by the Decimal Currency Acts,
the denomination of the moneys was changed to dollars and cents; and
in 1974, by the Exchange Control (Amendment of First Schedule) Order
1974 (made pursuant to section 3 of the Exchange Control Act),
Jamaica detached itself from sterling and tied its rate of exchange
to the US dollar (in accordance with the power conferred by section
11 of the Bank of Jamaica Act). 

 Accordingly,
the protective purpose of the Act is now no longer aimed at sterling
but at the Jamaican dollar and the Jamaican economy; and it is
against this background that the provisions of the Act should be
interpreted. In our view on the face of it the words of the section
referred to in argument do not form a class, and the ejusdem generis rule 

 282 

 does
not apply. It was necessary to include the words or “any part of
the United Kingdom” because a note may be legal tender in one part
of the United Kingdom and not in another: see 2 Halsbury’s
Laws of England (3rd Edn) page 155. Accordingly, the words “in any other
territory” (giving meaning and effect to “any”) were clearly
intended to apply the prohibition to notes which were legal tender in
territories other than the United Kingdom. We are fortified in so
holding by the fact that, originally, the provisions designating for
preferential treatment certain territories as “scheduled
territories” included countries outside the United Kingdom; and in
the English Act (from which the wording was borrowed), “scheduled
territories” included far-off Iceland. It is therefore not
necessary for the purposes of this appeal to determine whether
“United Kingdom” should be interpreted as limited by the Royal
and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 to Great Britain and Northern
Ireland or should include such places as the Channel Islands. 

 A
note is given the status of legal tender by the law of the particular
place in contemplation. Jamaican currency notes are legal tender in
Jamaica for any amount; see section 15(1)( a )
of the Bank of Jamaica Act. In our view whether or not a particular
note is legal tender in any foreign territory has to be proved by
admissible evidence; usually from some person whose knowledge and
experience render him competent. However, section 24 casts a wide
net to bring within its fold notes and species of many descriptions. 
A “note” inherently, manifestly and within the definition of
section 83 of the Bills of Exchange Act is a promissory note and a US
dollar bill would clearly fall under section 24(1)( e )(iii)
as a “promissory note expressed in terms of a currency other than
that of a scheduled territory and payable otherwise than within the
scheduled territories”. The term “scheduled territory” in the
First Schedule to the Act is now confined to Jamaica. 

 Although
the various species, design, class of currency or security are set
out in the subsection under lettered sub-heads and numerals, it
clearly was not intended thereby to create separate offences since it
is the act of exportation of all or any of the prohibited things that
is the fulcrum of the offence. The parcel for exportation may
contain different types or classes of things prohibited by the
section. It would be contrary to reason and good sense to hold that
there should be a separate count for each type or class. Again, a
thing may meet the description of more than one sub-head. In our
view the lay-out of the section is merely for convenience and ease of
reference. 

 The
US notes were tendered and admitted in evidence and were accurately
described in the “particulars of offence” in the indictment. The
fact that in the “statement of offence” there was a wrong letter
or numeral would be a false description that could do no harm. Of
more anxious concern is whether a conspiracy to export “foreign
currency” is a conspiracy to contravene the Exchange Control Act. 
The general provisions as to offences are contained in Part II of the
Fifth Schedule to the Act: 

 283 




‘ 1.
 (1) Any person in or resident in the Island who contravenes any
restriction or requirement imposed by or under this Act, and any such
person who conspires or attempts, or aids, abets, counsels or
procures any other person, to contravene any such restriction or
requirement as aforesaid, shall be guilty of an offence punishable
under this Part: 

 Provided
that an offence Punishable by virtue of Part III shall not be
punishable under this part.’ 




 Part
III of the Schedule deals with “Import and Export” thus: 




‘ 1.
 (1) The enactments relating to customs shall, subject to such
modifications, if any, as may be prescribed to adapt them to this
Act, apply in relation to anything prohibited to be imported or
exported by any of the provisions of Part IV of this Act except with
the permission of the Minister and imported or exported without such
permission as they apply in relation to goods prohibited to be
imported or exported by or under any of the said enactments, and any
reference in the said enactments to goods shall be construed as
including a reference to anything prohibited to be imported or
exported by any of the provisions of the said Part IV except with the
permission of the Minister and imported or exported without such
permission. 

 (2)
Reference in this paragraph to the enactments relating to customs
shall be taken as including references to the Customs Act and to the
Post Office Act... 

 3.
 If anything prohibited to be exported by any provision of the said
Part IV is exported in contravention thereof, or is brought to a quay
or other place, or water-borne, for the purpose of being so exported,
the exporter or his agent shall be liable to the same penalty as that
to which a person is liable for an offence to which section 210 of
the Customs Act applies.’ 




 Section
24 is within Part IV of the Exchange Control Act. Accordingly, by
express terms the exportation of the things prohibited by section 24
are excluded from the general provisions of Part II of the Fifth
Schedule, paragraph 1(1), and equally in express terms by the
provisions of Part III consigned to the Customs Act for liability and
penalty. Sections 151 and 210 of the Customs Act provide: 




‘ 151.
 If any person shall . . . export any goods prohibited to be
exported, or any goods the exportation of which is restricted,
contrary to such restriction, or attempt to perform or be knowingly
concerned in the performance of any of the aforesaid acts, he shall
(except as otherwise provided in section 144) incur a penalty of one
thousand dollars, or treble the value of such goods, at the election
of the Collector-General; and all such goods shall be forfeited. 

 210.
 (1) Every person who shall . . . or shall be in any way knowingly
concerned in any fraudulent evasion or attempt at evasion of any
import or export duties of customs, or of the laws and 

 284 

 restrictions
of the customs relating to the importation, unloading, warehousing,
delivery, removal, loading and exportation of goods, shall for each
such offence incur a penalty of two hundred dollars, or treble the
value of the goods, at the election of the Collector-General; and all
goods in respect of which any such offence shall be committed shall
be forfeited.’ 




 Thus
the substantive offences in relation to exporting foreign currency
are offences in breach of the Customs Act (sections 151 and 210) and
punishable thereunder and not offences punishable under the
provisions of the Exchange Control Act; see R v Goswami (1968) 52 Cr App Rep 197. 

 It
follows therefore, that a conspiracy to export foreign currency is a
conspiracy to contravene the Customs Act. Had the exportation of
foreign currency not been expressly excluded by the proviso to
parargaph 1(1) of Part II of the Fifth Schedule and made an offence
under the Customs Act then the common law principle that ( R
v Hall [1891] 1 QB 747) - 




‘ where
a statute prohibits a matter of public grievance or commands a matter
of public convenience all acts or omissions contrary to the
prohibition or command are indictable misdemeanours’ 




 would
apply; but this is only applicable when the statute is, on the face
of it, a lex imperfecta in not providing procedure and remedy; and, since this Act provides
that breaches of these prohibitions are to be dealt with under the
Customs Act, this general principle is inapplicable to the instant
case. As was observed in R v Goswami (1968) 52 Cr App Rep at page 202: “It is a great pity that
simplicity and clarity is so often sacrificed, as here, to a
pernicious fetish - legislation by reference”. 

 Accordingly,
the jurisdictional competence of the resident magistrate to try the
offence of conspiracy to export foreign currency lies neither in the
Exchange Control Act (because of the exclusionary provisions referred
to above) nor in the Customs Act (because of an absence of specific
provisions for conspiracy), but Under Section 267(1)( f )
of the Judicature (Resident Magistrate’s) Act as for an indictable
misdemeanour at common law, i e conspiracy to commit a statutory
offence (see R v Connolly and Costello (1910) 3 Cr App Rep 27; R
v Blamires Transport Services Ltd [1964] 1 QB 278) and punishable accordingly; See Section 268(2) of
the Judicature (Resident Magistrate’s) Act, as amended by the
Criminal Justice (Reform) Act 1978. 

 The
substantive offence of exporting foreign currency in breach of the
Customs Act is triable summarily; see Section 240(1) Of the Customs
Act. On an information charging the substantive offence the accused
may be convicted of an attempt; see section 50 of the Interpretation
Act. However, there are specific provisions for an attempt to export
prohibited articles; see section 151 of the Customs Act. An alder
and 

 285 

 abetter
is liable to be convicted and punished in the same manner as a
principal offender; see section 6 of the Justices of the Peace
Jursidiction Act. 

 Henceforth
it would seem prudent that where, as in this case, adducible evidence
would support the offence of attempting to export foreign currency in
contravention Of the Customs Act as indicated above, the accused
should be so charged. This would be in keeping with the course
advocated in R v Russell and Russell (1970) 16 WIR 151 at page 156 per Smith JA: 




‘ The
result of these appeals demonstrates that it seldom serves any useful
purpose to charge a conspiracy to commit an offence where, as in this
case, a charge for the substantive offence can be proved without
difficulty. In this case the needless exercise of charging and
proving a conspiracy has only worked to the advantage of the
appellants.’ 




 One
final question: should the indictment be amended to charge the
appellants with conspiracy to contravene the Customs Act? 
Technically this would be substituting one offence for the other and
we would be unwilling to entertain such an application at this late
stage especially in the particular circumstances of the case. 

 For
these reasons the appeals were allowed. Because of our decision on
this aspect of the case it seemed unnecessary to deal with the
alternative ground that the verdict was unreasonable having regard to
the evidence. It is enough to say that the handing over of the money
by Tolani to Mirchandani virtually in the face of the police who were
in uniform seems inexplicably imprudent in view of the fact that this
could have been done in the many hours the appellants were together
sightseeing.

 9TH
MARCH 1978, 1ST FEBRUARY 1980 

 Equity
– Acquiescence – Expenditure on land of another – Enforcement
of equitable right – Payment in satisfaction of equity 

 In
1956 Miss B gave a written undertaking to pay M 5s a week until death
and to give him a “good burial” (if there was any unwritten
agreement between them, its terms could not later be discovered). 
Miss B entered M’s land and built a three-apartment house at a
place indicated by M She collected rent from the tenants of the
apartments. Miss B paid 5s a week to M until 1970 or 1971 when, in
circumstances which could not be established, (i) the payments
ceased, and (ii) M took possession of the house. In March 1972 M
conveyed the land to the defendant. Miss B died in July 1972 and M
died in 1973. In proceedings instituted by the administratix of Miss
B’s estate regarding the land, 

 Held - (1) effect could not be given to any equity arising out of an oral
agreement between Miss B and M since there was no clear evidence of
the nature of any such agreement. 

 (2)
However, when the land was conveyed to the defendant in 1972 he was
aware of Miss B’s equity arising out of her expenditure on the
land; accordingly, the court would require the defendant to make a
payment to Miss B’s estate to satisfy that equity and the payment
would be calculated by reference to the ammount of her expenditure,
the present value of the house and the amount that she had received
in rent.

 Appeal 

 Appeal Arthur Roberts, the defendant, appealed to the Court of Appeal of
Jamaica (resident Magistrate’s civil appeal 69/77) against an order
of Mrs E J Collymore Woodstock, resident magistrate for St Andrew,
granting possession of certain premises to Etheline Bourke, the
plaintiff who was the administratrix of the estate of Ruth Christiana
Bourke, deceased, on the payment of $100 to the defendant, and also
granting an injunction restraining the defendant, his servants and
agents, from entering the premises. The facts are set out in
judgment of the court delivered by Henry JA. 

 Dennis
Daley for the defendent 

 Horace
Edwards QC for the plaintiff 

 Henry
JA delivered the judgment of the court. This is an appeal from a
judgment by Mrs E J Collymore Woodstock, resident magistrate for St
Andrew, given in favour of the plantiff. By that judgment the
resident magistrate made an order for possession by 15th November
1975 of premises known as 1 or 1½ Bryce Hill Road, or payment by the
plantiff of $100 to the defendant, and costs to be agreed or taxed. 
In addition, an injunction was granted restraining the defendant and
his servants or agents from entering the premises after the date of
possession. 

 The
land which is the subject-matter of the action was formerly owned by
Samuel Mais, who died on 25th January 1973. On 6th September 1956,
Ruth Bourke signed an agreement in the following terms: 




‘ I
Ruth Bourke of August Town in the parish of St Andrew do hereby agree
to give Samuel Mais of the said August Town 5s per week until death. 
I also agree to give him a good burial and to take possession of his
room.’ 




 The
room referred to in the agreement was built on the land and was
occupied by Mr Mais up to the time of his death. Some time in 1956
Miss Bourke employed Robert Fyffe to build a three-apartment house on
the land at a spot pointed out by Mr Mais, and she collected rent
from tenants of this house up to 1970 or 1971. She also continued to
make the agreed weekly payments to Mr Mais up to that time. Miss
Bourke died on 10th July 1972. On 14th March 1972, Mr Mais executed
a conveyance to the defendant of the land, including that which is
the subject of this action. There is a dispute as to the reason for
Miss Bourke ceasing to make the agreed weekly payments to Mr Mais. 
The plaintiff alleges that, upon a tenant vacating the house built by
Miss Bourke, Mr Mais with the assistance of the defendant took the
opportunity of gaining possession of it in 1971; and he thereafter
prevented Miss Bourke from entering or renting the house. This (she
alleges) was in breach of his 

 288 

 agreement
with Miss Bourke, who thereafter made no further payments to him. 
The defendant on the other hand alleges that Miss Bourke, because of
age and illness, was unable to carry out her agreement to make weekly
payments to Mr Mais and he therefore repossessed the house in 1970. 
He further alleges that he assumed responsibility for the weekly
payments to Mr Mais and took care of him thereafter; - hence the
conveyance. 

 The
trial judge came to the conclusion that the land had been given to
Miss Bourke by Mr Mais and, in return, she entered into the 1956
agreement. She further found that fulfilment of the 1956 agreement
was not a condition precedent to the gift of the land and that Miss
Bourke “would have acquired by adverse possession rights to the
land ... prior to the purported conveyance [in 1972]”. Having also
found that Miss Bourke had failed to comply with the 1956 agreement
for two years prior to Mr Mais’s death and had also failed to
provide a good funeral for him, the resident magistrate made her
order for possession subject to the payment of “a reasonable sum
$100” for Mr Mais’s funeral expenses. 

 Counsel
for the defendant complains against this judgment on two main
grounds: (a) that the findings (in particular, in relation to the
nature of the agreement) are unsupported by the evidence; and (b)
that no adverse possession arises on the facts. 

 Counsel
for the plaintiff supports the judgment on the basis that it does
substantial justice between the parties. He submits that there are
two equities: one based on the 1956 agreement, and the other on the
building of the house by Miss Bourke; that there is abundant evidence
that the defendant had notice of both, and that any legal estate
vested in him by the conveyance in 1972 was therefore subject to the
prior equitable interest of Miss Bourke; it is for the court to say
in what way the equity can be satisfied. This, he submits, the
resident magistrate did in her judgment. He cites in support of his
submissions Inwards v Baker [1965] 1 All ER 446 and Wakeham v MacKenzie [1968] 2 All ER 783. Inwards
v Baker is authority for the proposition that, where an occupier of land is
induced or encouraged by the owner to spend money on that land in the
expectation that he will acquire ail interest in it, equity will not
allow that expectation to be defeated. That principle was recognised
by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Wellington Corporation (1884) 9 App Cas 699 which expressly approved the statement of it by
Lord Kingsdown in Ramsden v Dyson (1866) LR 1 HC 129 as follows: 




‘ If
a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain
interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an
expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have
a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of
the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with
the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out
money upon the land, a court of equity will compel the landlord to 

 289 

 give
effect to such promise or expectation.’ 




 It
has also been followed in a number of other cases and most recently
in Jones v Jones [1977] 1 WLR 438. 

 Wakeham
v McKenzie [1968] 2 All ER 783 is cited in support of the proposition that a
payment of money may amount to a sufficient act of part performance
to call that equitable doctrine into play; and, in the instant case,
that the conduct of Miss Bourke in erecting a house on Mr Mais’s
land pointed irresistibly to the conclusion that there was some
contract with him for the secured occupation of that house by her. 

 No
doubt acts of part performance may be prayed in aid for the purpose
of confirming the existence of an alleged oral agreement. This
matter was considered in Steadman v Steadman [1976] AC 536 by the House of Lords at some length. The difficulty
in this case is to ascertain the terms of the alleged oral agreement,
both parties to it being now dead. The plaintiff said: 




‘ In
1956 Samuel Mais came to Ruth Bourke’s house and made arrangements
with her to care for him until he died in a return for the land at 1
Bryce Hill Road and she was to build her house on the said land; and
Miss Bourke to pay 5s per week.’ 




 Then
in cross-examination, having had the 1956 agreement read to her, she
said: 




‘ I
know of all agreement between Mr Mais and Ruth Bourke about the house
I am now claiming. I also know of agreement about the room; and it
is one agreement they make from the beginning’ 




 and
a little later: 




‘ I
say the agreement was that she care for Mr Mais until he dies and
then he gave her spot to build her house and when he dies she to give
him a good funeral and take over his house’ 




 It
is by no means clear whether this evidence as to the agreement was
her interpretation of the 1956 agreement or mere hearsay; certainly
she did not state that she was present when any oral agreement was
made. The only other witness who purported to give evidence of the
terms of an oral agreement was Imogene Buchanan. She said: “Mr
Mais will out the land to Miss Bourke and Miss Bourke gave Mr Mais 5s
every week”. Then in cross-examination she said: “I not present
when land will out. Mr Mais come and tell me after he did it”. It
is not uncommon in Jamaica for a person who owns land but is unable
to cultivate it and has no other means of livelihood to obtain
financial support from some other person, With the understanding that
on the death of the owner the land will pass to that other person. 
If, however, this is the sort of arrangement to which Miss Buchanan
referred when she said “Mr Mais will out the land” it is clear
that the resident magistrate did not accept her evidence in this
regard since she found that there was all outright immediate gift to
Miss 

 290 

 Bourke
of the land, in return for which Miss Bourke agreed to pay a regular
weekly amount to Mr Mais while allowing him to remain In occupation
of the room on the land. It may be that the resident magistrate was
led to tills conclusion because the 1956 agreement was all
undertaking by Miss Bourke rather than all agreement between the two
parties. It seems to us, however, that the 1956 agreement is equally
consistent with all agreement for Miss Bourke to pay a weekly amount
as rental or in return for the right to build on the land. In the
absence of any clear evidence as to the nature of the oral contract
between Miss Bourke and Mr Mais it is impossible for a court to
attempt to uphold any equitable right to enforce it. We agree,
however, that an equity arises as a result of the expenditure by Miss
Bourke of money for the purpose of erecting the house on Mr Mais’s
land and maintaining it thereafter. It is clear on the evidence that
the defendant had notice of this equity when the conveyance was
executed in 1972. In our view that equity can be best satisfied by
the payment to the plaintiff of such amount as may be assessed having
regard to the amount spent by Miss Bourke, the present value of the
house and the rent received by her. Evidence would have to be led
for this purpose. In so far as adverse possession is concerned, this
clearly does not arise on the evidence. We therefore allow the
appeal, set aside the judgment and order for possession and direct
that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for such amount as may be
assessed by the resident magistrate in the light of such evidence. 

 In
the circumstances there will be no order as to the costs of the
appeal.

 Appeals 

 Appeals Elijah Kerr and Louis Cooper applied to the Court of Appeal of
Jamaica (criminal appeals 284/77, 285/77) for leave to appeal against
convictions for murder at the St James circuit court. The facts are
set out in the judgment of the court delivered by Melville JA. This
was an appeal from a retrial consequent on an earlier appeal (see 24
WIR 484). 

 Howard
Hamilton for Kerr 

 Lloyd
McFarlane for Cooper 

 Donald
McIntosh for the Crown 

 Melville
JA delivered the judgment of the court. On 8th December 1977 the
applicants were convicted in the St James circuit court of the murder
of Sydney Whittingham on 4th September 1975. 

 Mr
Whittingham had been posted as a security guard at 328 Charles 

 292 

 Avenue
in the lronshore Estate, Montego Bay, at 8.00 p m on 3rd September
1975. He had been issued with a shotgun and four cartridges, no
doubt as part of his duties. Between 3 and 4 o’clock of the early
morning Of 4th September he was found dead on the patio Of 328
Charles Avenue. Up to 1.30 a m he had been seen alive and well. He
had been shot, no doubt more than once, from shotgun blasts. Some
five shotgun shells were found in the vicinity of his body and the
shotgun and ammunition issued to Mr Whittingham were missing. 

 Mr
Peterkin, who was employed as a gardener at the Charles Avenue
premises, said that between 3 and 4 o’clock on the morning Of 4th
September he awoke and, feeling thirsty, he went to the refrigerator
in the dining-room to get a drink of water. The dining-room faces
the patio on which Mr Whittingham’s body was found and, beyond the
patio, there was a swimming pool. Glass doors separated the
dining-room from the patio. Drapes were hung over these doors and
were of such material that, unless the drapes were removed, one could
not see on to the patio from the dining-room. After having his
drink, Mr Peterkin said that he pulled the drapes aside and looked
out onto the patio. There he saw the applicant Cooper some four or
five yards away from him and the applicant Kerr near to some steps. 
Kerr had two “long guns”, one strung over his back with the other
in his hands. Cooper, who was also armed with a “long gun”,
fired at Mr Peterkin, shattering the glass door and injuring Mr
Peterkin in his abdomen. Whereupon Mr Peterkin took to his heels. 
It was some twenty minutes after this incident that Mr Whittingham’s
body was discovered on the patio. At different identification
parades held subsequently Mr Peterkin identified both the applicants. 

 Prior
to this incident at about 10 o’clock on the same night, another
Security guard (Mr Haughton) was on duty at another cottage at Sugar
Mill Road in the same Ironshore estate and some one mile away from
the Charles Avenue cottage when he was shot, and his shotgun and four
cartridges stolen from him. Mr Haughton subsequently identified
Cooper, as the person who had shot him. There was no evidence of any
other person being involved with Cooper in this incident, at least at
this trial, there having been two previous trials. 

 To
complete the picture, although no evidence of this incident was given
at the trial, it seems that some three weeks later both the
applicants and others were seen travelling in a motor car at Ramble. 
The men apparently made their escape, but not before Kerr was seen
with a shotgun. Mr Haughton’s shotgun was recovered from that car. 

 This
last incident (the “Ramble incident”) was not given in evidence
at the trial as a preliminary objection was taken (before the trial
commenced and in the absence of the jury), that the facts of this
incident and also those relating to Mr Haughton (the “Sugar Mill
Road incident”) should not be put before the jury. In the exercise
of his discretion the trial judge allowed evidence of the Sugar Mill
Road incident, but not that of the Ramble incident to be put before
the jury. 

 293 

 What
was argued before us was that the evidence Of the Sugar Mill Road
incident was also inadmissible. Alternatively (if it was admissible
as against Cooper), it was so prejudicial to Kerr that the trial
judge erred in law in allowing that evidence to be put before the
jury. In the further alternative (it was said), Kerr should at least
have been ordered to be tried separately from Cooper. 

 For
evidence of this nature to be admissible it must be based on Lord
Herschell’s classic statement in Makin v Attorney-General for New South Wales [1894] AC 57 at page 65: 




‘ It
is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence
tending to show that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts
other than those covered in the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from
his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for
which he is being tried. on the other hand, the mere fact that the
evidence adduced tends to show the commission of other crimes does
not render it inadmissible if it is relevant to all issue before the
jury and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the question whether
the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the indictment
were designed or accidental, or to rebut a defence which would
otherwise be open to the accused.’ 




 As
judicially interpreted, to be admissible the evidence must fall
within what has been compendiously referred to as the “similar
facts” rule, and it cannot be doubted at this stage that evidence
which goes to the identity of an accused person comes within the
rule; see R v Robinson (1953) 37 Cr App Rep 95 and R v Davis and Murphy (1972) 56 Cr App Rep 249. The difficulty has always been to
correctly apply the rule to the circumstances of a particular case. 
In this regard Director, of Public Prosecutions v Boardman (1974) 60 Cr App Rep 165 offers invaluable assistance. A part of the
headnote states: 




‘ There
are circumstances in which, contrary to the general rule, evidence of
certain acts of the defendant other than those charged is admissible
because of their similarity to the acts being investigated and by
reason of their probative force. It is for the judge to rule whether
such evidence is admissible and in his discretion to decide whether
in the circumstances such evidence should be admitted.’ 




 Lord
Cross of Chelsea puts the test this way (at page 185): 




‘ As
Viscount Simon said in Harris v Director of Public Prosecutions (1952) 36 Cr App Rep at page 51, [1952] AC 694 at page 705, it is not
possible to compile all exhaustive list of the sort of cases in which
‘similar fact’ evidence-to use a compendious phrase-is
admissible. The question must always be whether the similar fact
evidence taken together with the other evidence would do no more than
raise or strengthen a suspicion that the accused committed the
offence with 

 294 

 which
he is charged or would point so strongly to his guilt that only all
ultra-cautious jury, if they accepted it as true, would acquit in
face of it. In the end although the admissibility of such evidence
is a question of law not of discretion the question as I see it must
be one of degree.’ 




 Applying
that test to the circumstances of this case what are the similarities
between the Sugar Mill Road incident and the Charles Avenue incident?
 In both instances a security guard is shot by a shotgun and his
shotgun and cartridges stolen, empty shotgun cartridge shells are
discarded at the respective scenes, both are shot in the same area of
the respective houses and, for good measure, the incidents occurred a
mere five hours apart on the same night approximately one mile apart
in the same housing estate. Cooper was identified as the person who
discharged the firearm at Sugar Mill Road and also at Mr Peterkin at
Charles Avenue. In the circumstances the evidence of the Sugar Mill
Road incident was relevant evidence which could support the
identification of Cooper at the Charles Avenue incident by Mr
Peterkin. 

 On
the question of prejudice to Kerr, it cannot be doubted that the case
which the Crown put forward was that both the applicants were engaged
in a joint enterprise. Before the trial judge great emphasis was
laid on the prejudicial nature of the Sugar Mill Road incident in so
far as Kerr was concerned, as also the Ramble incident. Having
listened to the rival contentions, the trial judge excluded evidence
of the Ramble incident but allowed evidence of the Sugar Mill Road
incident. It was a matter for the discretion of the trial judge; and
it has been said time and time again that this court will not lightly
interfere with the exercise of such a discretion. 

 On
the question whether there should have been separate trials, Mr
Hamilton tried valiantly to show that such an application had been
made at the trial. We are unable to accept that. Mention of the
possibility of a separate trial was made only in the context of the
difficulty in which the Crown would be placed in furthering the
argument that evidence of the Sugar Mill Road and Ramble incidents
Should be excluded. At all events it was much too late in the day
for us to entertain such an application in the circumstances; and if
an application had been made and refused, one would have seen no
reason to interfere. 

 Mr
Hamilton’s other complaint was that the jury had been misdirected
in that, by the repeated use of the phrase “the two accused or
either one of them who killed the deceased”, the trial Judge failed
sufficiently to bring home to the minds of the jury the importance of
distinguishing the case of each applicant. In particular, the
passage: 




‘ And,
if You accept the evidence of identification given by Mr Haughton and
Mr Peterkin, then you will ask yourself what were Cooper and Kerr
doing on that patio at 3 o’clock that morning, armed with shotguns;
what happened to Mr Whittingham’s shotgun; who shot Mr
Whittingham?’ 




 295 

 would
lead the jury to use the evidence of the Sugar Mill Road incident to
link Kerr with what happened at Charles Avenue, thereby creating
grave prejudice against Kerr. With Mr Hamilton we have been through
the summing-up very carefully; and we find this ground untenable. In
the passages immediately preceding that complained of, it was made
abundantly clear to the jury that the evidence of the Sugar Mill Road
incident only affected Cooper. We are satisfied that, on the
summing-up as a whole, there was no room for doubt that the case of
each applicant was separately left for the jury’s consideration; so
there is no merit in this ground. 

 Mr
McFarlane, who adopted the arguments of Mr Hamilton, added one other
ground and it was: 




‘ that
the trial judge failed to direct the jury properly as to the weight
which was to be attached to the fact that the witness Mr Peterkin had
admitted that he could have said that it was Mr Whittingham who had
shot him.’ 




 We
find no substance in this ground. In the first place, there was no
evidence before the jury that he had in fact said so; and, secondly,
at all events the trial judge adequately left the matter to be
considered by the jury as affecting the credibility of the witness Mr
Peterkin. Accordingly, the hearing was treated as the hearing of the
appeal and the appeals of both applicants dismissed. 

 Appeals
dismissed.

v Livingston (1952) 6 Jamaica LR 95 

 Appeal 

 Appeal Rupert Johnson applied to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica (criminal
appeal 236/76) for leave to appeal against his conviction by Carey J
in the Gun Court for the unlawful possession of a firearm. The Court
of Appeal treated the application as all appeal; allowed the appeal
and reserved its reasons. The facts are set out in the judgment of
the court delivered by Kerr JA.

 Kerr
JA delivered the judgment of the court. This was all application for
leave to appeal from a conviction in the High Court Division of the
Gun Court before Carey J sitting without a jury for the offence of
illegal possession of a firearm, contrary to section 20(1)( b )
of the Firearms Act. At the hearing the application was treated as
all appeal, the appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed and a
judgment and verdict of acquittal entered. We now set out the
reasons for so doing. 

 The
appellant was originally charged on all indictment containing two
counts: the first for the offence for which he was convicted, and the
second for shooting at Robert Johnson with Intent to do grievous
bodily harm, contrary to section 20 of the Offences against the
Person Act. At the end of the case for the prosecution the trial
Judge acquitted the appellant of the second count. 

 At
4.00 p m on 1st August 1976 Robert Johnson, the complainant, was at
Slipe in the parish of St Elizabeth. He had ridden there on his
motor cycle. There he had all altercation with the appellant. This
developed into fisticuffs and wrestling about three or four yards
from the back of Lloyd Dunkley’s shop. After they disengaged
(according to the complainant) the appellant went into Dunkley’s
shop, came to the back door with a shotgun in his hands and fired it
at him. However, he was not injured. The complainant denied that he
was the aggressor; but he admitted flinging a stone which hit the
appellant on the shoulder, but said that it had occurred after the
appellant had flung a hammer at him. He also admitted taking out the
switch-key from the appellant’s motor cycle. Lloyd Dunkley, the
shopkeeper, was the owner of the shotgun (for which he held a
licence). He had tried to stop the fight between complainant and
appellant. After they disengaged (and while he, apparently, was in
front of the shop) he heard a shot and, on going to the back, he saw
the appellant with his shotgun Which he took from him and handed to
Special Constable Orville Campbell. Dunkley said that he saw there a
crowd of twenty to twenty-five persons; and they were hostile to the
appellant. Special Constable Campbell said that he saw the fight
between the appellant and the complainant. The appellant ran into
the shop and returned to the door with a shotgun, which he fired; but
“nobody was in the way”. The appellant in his sworn testimony
said that, while at Dunkley’s premises, the complainant had accused
him of killing his goat, punched him, kicked him in the belly and, as
he ran, flung a stone at him. He ran into the shop because he was
afraid of the crowd. While in the shop the heard the complainant
calling for a machete and the crowd shouting “Hit him! Hit him”. 
He took up the gun which was in the shop and fired it into the ground
because he was afraid. He did not know that Dunkley had a gun when
he ran into the shop. At that time the complainant had the
switch-key for his motor cycle. 

 Of
the grounds filed the following was the only one argued: 




‘ The
trial judge wrongly overruled the appellant’s counsel’s
submission of ‘no case’ on count 1 of the indictment, and in 

 298 

 proceeding
to convict the appellant of the offence in that Count, he unwittingly
erred in law for the following amongst Other reasons: (a) (i) a
defence at common law is not taken away by statute unless by express
words or by necessary implication; (ii) the burden of proving every fact in a criminal case lies on the prosecution unless cast on the
defendant, by express words in a statute or by necessary implication
therefrom; (iii) section 20 of the Firearms Act has relieved the
prosecution of the burden of proving the absence of a licence. It
has not, however, taken away the common law defence of self-defence;
nor the defence of reasonable excuse; and (iv) the apparent failure
of the trial judge to draw the distinction between (i) and (ii)
above, and consider (iii) above, in that light occasioned a
miscarriage of justice.’ 




 In
support, Mr Macaulay submitted that self-defence was a common law
defence and, in the absence of express words in a statute, was always
a lawful excuse; the appellant took possession of the gun to defend
himself and, accordingly, his possession was not unlawful. Further,
it was clear from the record that the trial judge did not direct
himself on this question, which clearly arose having regard to the
evidence. Mr Smith for the Crown contended that, even if it could be
said that in defending oneself a firearm snatched up in the agony of
the moment was not in contravention of section 20 of the Firearms
Act, this was not so in the instant case. 

 Having
regard to the exchanges between Bench and Bar and the evidence of
Special Constable Campbell, it is reasonable to assume that the trial
judge did not call on the appellant to answer count 2 on the basis
that there was not sufficient credible evidence that he shot at any person. 

 The
offence of unlawful possession of a firearm is created by a statutory
prohibition and, as is in the nature of such offences, liability is
inherently strict. Possession is a state or condition, “not ail
act done at a particular moment; it is a continuing state of things”;
see R v Bentham [1972] 3 WLR 398 at page 403. 

 Generally,
self-defence is in issue when an accused, in the act of defending
himself against an actual or imminent attack incidentally causes
injury or damage which is the subject of the charge. Accordingly,
were a person to obtain the possession of a firearm without such
transaction being covered by the appropriate permit or licence, using
it on a subsequent occasion in self-defence would not excuse the
possessor on a charge of unlawful possession under section 20 of the
Firearms Act, although it could have been successfully pleaded in
relation to offences arising out of the use of the firearm. In the circumstances the following questions arose
for our consideration. (1) Whether or not it could be said that a
person is in possession of a firearm if, in the emergency of
defending himself from ail actual or imminent attack and apprehending
serious injury, he takes up a firearm (of which he previously had
neither ownership nor possession or in relation to which he was not,
at the material time, in criminally culpable association with the
owner or 

 299 

 possessor?
(2) Apart from the exceptions created by the Act, can one be in
possession without contravening the provisions of section 20 of the
Firearms Act? (3) If the answer to either question (1) or (2) is in
the affirmative, in the instant case did the question arise for
consideration? And (4) if it did, was it given due consideration by
the trial judge? 

 So
far as is relevant, Section 20 of the Firearms Act provides: 




‘ (1)
A person shall not - ( a )
save as authorised by a licence which continues in force by virtue of
any enactment, be in possession of a prohibited weapon; or ( b )
subject to subsection (2), be in possession of any other firearm or
ammunition except under and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of a firearm user’s licence ...’ 




 Subsections
(2) and (3) set out certain exceptions which are not applicable to
the present case. 

 Question
1 

“ Possession”
is a word of variable meaning and there seem to be irreconcilably
different interpretations in various branches of the law. However,
whether the interpretation includes “knowledge” as in Director of Public Prosecutions v Brooks (1974) 21 WIR 411 and/or animus possidendi as in Hobson v Impett (1957) 41 Cr App Rep 138 will depend upon the legislative intent of
the particular Act and the mischief at which it is aimed. In any
event, it seems clear that, in the criminal law, it may be necessary
to determine whether in certain circumstances in the handling of an
article an accused deliberately exercised the necessary dominion or
control to make him a possessor within the meaning of the particular
statutory provisions. 

 In
our view the sudden and temporary handling of a firearm for the sole
and limited purpose of defending oneself from an attack which is
actual or imminent is not possession within the contemplation of
section 20. There Would be no intention to exercise dominion over
the firearm as the handling was for a brief moment and purely
incidental. 

 Question
2 

 A
person may be in possession for a lawful purpose other than the
exceptions created by the Act. To hold otherwise would lead to
absurdity. The English case R v Hubig (1974) (unreported) referred to in Archbold’s Criminal Pleading , Evidence
and Practice (39th Edn) paragraph 2343 is illustrative: 




‘ H
was shot in the hand at 1.00 a m and having disarmed his assailant
and taken possession of the weapon was found still to be in
possession of it at 5.00 a m When attending hospital for treatment he
maintained that he intended to hand the gun to the police later that
morning. The jury were directed that the Crown had to prove not only
the possession of a firearm and absence of a certificate but further,
that H 

 300 

 had
had no intention of handing the firearm to the police within a
reasonable time. Provision is not made in section 1 (cf section 19)
for the defence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse, however it
would not seem to follow that section 1(1) creates all absolute
offence.’ 




 Accordingly,
we hold that (although the offence is in breach of a statutory
prohibition) having regard to the meaning of “possession” in the
criminal law, the obvious aims of the Act and the heavy mandatory
sentence of life imprisonment, the liability (although strict) is by
no means absolute. 

 Hubig’s case is distinguishable from the instant case by the fact that the
firearm was taken from the attacker and was held for some hours,
while here it was taken from the premises of the owner (a third
person), held for the moment of “brief encounter” and then
delivered up to the owner. In both cases, however, it was in the act
of self-defence. 

 Question
3 

 The
appellant’s attorney at the trial elicited evidence in cross-
examination as to the hostile crowd; and the appellant (in evidence)
said that he did not know of the existence of the firearm when he ran
into the shop, and that he took it up and fired into the ground
because he was afraid (having heard the complainant calling for a
machete and the crowd shouting “Hit him! Hit him”). Accordingly,
it is clear from the evidence that the issue Of possession (or the
illegality of the possession ) was specifically raised on the basis
of emergency action in self-defence. 

 Question
4 

 In
the Course of the trial and during the cross-examination of the
complainant, the following occurred: 




‘ Mr
Brown He was running away when you were fighting him. Complainant .
 Me and him clash. 

 Q
Did he run any at all during the fight, Yes or No? A Him run for a
hammer. 

 Q
Did he run towards the back of the shop? A Him run for a hammer. 

 Q
You saw him run, how you know what he was going for? A I saw a claw
hammer and him coming towards me, that is why I had to stop him. 
When me take away the hammer from him ... 

 Carey
J One moment please. How is the fracas of interest, how call it assist me to determine whether or not this
man had a gun? ... The charge against the accused man is illegal
possession of a firearm, and no amount of argument you call offer in
this court as a defence can alter the charge.’ 




 and,
at the end of the case for the prosecution, the following: 




‘ Mr
Brown I would like to make a submission on the point of count 

 301 

 I
(illegal possession). It is the view of the defence, M’Lord, that
the court must still decide the question of possession. It is the
view of the defence that possession has a particular significance in
law, and it does not follow that, because someone has control or
knowledge of the property of another, possession passes. In this
case the defence is of the opinion that His Lordship should consider
when possession passes. 

 Carey
J It is a little difficult for you to argue at this point what you are
proposing to argue. It seems to me ... well, I assume you are
arguing that it is a fact that the accused man had the gun when it
was fired, and that he fired it, but that doesn’t equate possession
in law. Is that what you are saying? 

 Mr
Brown It Isn’t quite that way I was putting it, M’Lord. What I am
saying is that, although he fired the gun at the time ... [and] the
action might have been illegal, we must first establish possession of
the firearm before the illegal aspect of it is considered. 

 Carey
J So then, what are you saying, what is your argument? 

 Mr
Brown That the owner might have obtained possession although fired by
somebody else. 

 Carey
J What are You saying? Is that the reason why there is no case to
answer? It could be only one of two things: either if the Crown has
failed to establish a case, or if you are saying that no conversation
took place (which is the topic of the Crown’s case), well say so. 
If your submission is that, at the present time it is premature. 

 Mr
Brown What I am saying, M’Lord, is that the owner Of the gun admitted
that he was on the shop premises when the gun was taken out, when the
gun was fired he didn’t leave, and I am saying that the authorities
seem to suggest ... I appreciate it is a difficult ... 

 Carey
J Are You admitting he had the gun? 

 Mr
Brown Yes sir. 

 Carey
J Go in the box and say so and I will follow the legal argument you are
putting forward. If that is so, put the man in the box to say so.’ 




 The
record reveals that, at the end of the final addresses by the
attorneys of either side, the trial judge without further ado entered
a verdict of guilty and, contrary to the practice obtaining in these
cases and to his own custom, he recorded no findings of fact, nor his
decision or ruling on the questions of law as to possession which the
attorney for the appellant endeavoured to raise at the trial. We can
only assume that the trial judge did not think that the attorney’s
endeavours were worthy of honourable mention. This is understandable
as the submissions in relation to possession as presented by him were
based on faulty reasoning and were not in keeping with the lucid
treatment of “possession” in Director of Public Prosecutions v Brooks (1974) 21 WIR 411 at Page 415: 




‘ In
the ordinary use of the word ‘possession’, one has in one’s 

 302 

 possession
whatever is, to one’s own knowledge, physically in one’s custody
or under one’s physical control. This is obviously what was
intended to be prohibited in the case of dangerous drugs. Question
(1) and the reason given for the answer, however, suggest that, in
addition to the mental element of knowledge on the part of the
accused, which the Court of Appeal had chosen to deal with separately
in questions (2) and (3), the word ‘possession’ imported into
this criminal statute as a necessary ingredient of all offence
against public health the highly technical doctrines of the civil law
about physical custody without ownership as a source of legal rights
in the actual custodian against third parties and about the legal
relationships between owner and custodian which bring about the
separation of proprietary and possessory rights in chattels ... These
technical doctrines of the civil law about possession are irrelevant
to this field of criminal law.’ 




 The
questions referred to in this passage were those formulated in R v Livingston (1952) 6 Jamaica LR 95 at page 97 and question (1) reads: 




‘ Could
the temporary dominion or control which the appellant had over the
ganja as baggageman on the bus amount to possession within the
meaning of section 7( c ),
or was it merely custody or charge?’ 




 A
similar reason would support a liberal interpretation of possession
in section 20 of the Firearms Act, a firearm being so lethal a
weapon. Accordingly, the mere presence of the owner would not
preclude the appellant from being in possession of the firearm within
the meaning of the law and the attorney’s submissions along those
lines were devoid of merit. There still remained however, the wider
question: was his sudden snatching up of the firearm in the act of
defending himself, “possession contrary to section 20 of the
Firearms Act”? 

 In
the light of the exchanges between Bench and Bar and the fact that
the trial judge was not addressed along the lines argued before us by
Mr Macaulay or had his attention drawn to R v Hubig (1974) (unreported) we are of the view that due consideration was not
given to this aspect of the matter. Had he done so, in view of his
finding in relation to count 2, the probabilities are he would not
have come to the conclusion he did in relation to this count. 

 Accordingly,
having quashed the conviction, we entered a judgment and verdict of
acquittal. 

 Appeal
allowed.

 Appeal 

 Appeal Oswald Fuller appealed to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica (civil
appeal 29 Of 1977) against the amount awarded to him in the High
Court as damages for wrongful dismissal by the respondent, Revere
Jamaica Alumina Ltd. The facts are set out in the judgment of the
court delivered by Rowe JA 

 Berthan
Macaulay QC instructed by W Bentley Brown for the appellant 

 304 

 R
N A Henriques and Mrs Hudson-Phillips for the respondent 

 Rowe
JA delivered the judgment of the court. For four years the appellant
was employed as a security guard to the respondent company at Magotty
in St Elizabeth. By letter dated 11th August 1975 the appellant was
dismissed with immediate effect for alleged negligence and misue of
the respondent’s vehicle. The appellant felt aggrieved and brought
an action claiming damages for wrongful dismissal and for loss of
severance pay. At the trial the respondent was unable to proceed
with its defence that the termination of the plaintiffs employment
was in the circumstances justified; and the sole question for
resolution was the quantum of damages. 

 The
appellant’s evidence was that he was paid fortnightly but that his
cheque at the end of each month would include his allowance for
travelling for the entire month. He agreed that, after deductions
for income tax, national insurance and credit union, his net monthly
pay (inclusive of travelling) was $557.65. After his dismissal,
which according to his Income Tax Form P.45, became effective on 15th
August 1975, the appellant received from the respondent three
cheques. Two were dated 11th August 1975 for $557.65 and $340.67
(totalling $898.32) and the third was for $458. This latter cheque
was a refund of his pension contributions. In respect of the two
cheques dated 11th August 1975, the appellant said that they could
represent two weeks’ pay to the end of August, three weeks’
vacation pay and one month’s pay in lieu of notice; and he agreed
with the attorney for the respondent that the sum of money which he
was entitled to receive for those three periods was $813.94. 

 In
his statement of claim the plaintiff claimed $681.34 as loss of
earnings from 13th August to 11th October 1975 at the rate of $340.67
per month. After the date “11th October 1975” the word
“continuing” was added, implying that the appellant would claim
loss of earnings for a period beyond that date. At the trial
evidence was led in support of the monthly rate of pay; but not one
word was said as to any continuing loss of earnings. 

 On
the issue of severance pay, the plaintiff gave the following
evidence: 




‘ When
I got the letter [in] evidence I hadn’t heard about the
[respondent] closing down operations. I heard that six days after I
got the letter. I received no notification of closing down. I know
others received severance pay. I have been with the [respondent] for
four years. I knew I would be entitled to $3400 severance pay for
the four years. I have not received any severance pay apart from the
two cheques.’ 




 Then
in cross-examination he said: 




‘ The
[respondent] was still in operation after my dismissal. Revere was
closed down sometime after I was dismissed. It was sometime in 

 305 

 September
that Revere started to lay off all the workers’. 




 In
his very short reasons for judgment, the trial judge said (inter
alia): 




‘ [The
appellant] claims loss of earnings for two months amounting to
$681.34. [The appellant] himself admitted that he received in all,
apart from his normal pay, eight weeks’ pay in lieu of notice,
which amount included any loss of earnings claimed ... [The
appellant] has failed to prove that he suffered any loss whether or
not he was wrongly dismissed, and he has also failed to show that he
was entitled to any severance pay as he was not one of those whom the
Employment (Termination and Redundancy Payments) Act set out to
protect.’ 




 Accordingly,
the trial judge gave judgment for the respondent with costs to be
taxed or agreed. Against this judgment the appellant’s attorney
argued seven grounds of appeal. 

 Grounds
4 and 5 were to the effect that the trial judge had erred in law in
giving judgment for the respondent as the appellant had succeeded in
the essential allegation in the action; and that the judge had failed
to consider the issue of damages adequately, especially as it
affected the loss of pension rights and the prospects of alternative
employment. Mr Macaulay submitted that, where a charge of wrongful
dismissal is made and an attempt is made to justify it, the onus is
on the defendant to prove the justification. If such a defendant
fails, judgment must be given against him. For this proposition of
law he relied on Clouston&amp;Co Ltd v Corry [1906] AC 122. In that case there was a live issue at the trial as
to whether the misconduct proved justified the dismissal; and it was
held that it was for the presiding judge to decide whether there was
any evidence to submit to the jury in support of the allegation of
justifiable dismissal. If there was no such evidence he would
perforce enter judgment for the plaintiff. This case is no authority
for saying that a plaintiff who has been wrongfully dismissed from
his employment but has received full compensation for the wrongful
dismissal before any action brought is still entitled to judgment. 

 Then
he argued that nowhere did the trial judge advert his mind to general
damages and the issues, firstly, of the appellant’s loss of pension
rights and other benefits which he might have received had he
continued to pay his pension contributions and secondly the
possibility of the appellant’s obtaining suitable alternative
employment. 

 We
think that where a judge is trying a civil case he is called upon to
determine the issues raised on the pleadings. The parties are in
control of the issues which they wish to place before the court and a
plaintiff who did not see fit to plead a particular issue of fact
cannot be heard on appeal to complain that the trial judge erred in
not launching out into uncharted waters to discover and identify
remedies for the benefit of such a lax plaintiff. In Bold v Brough, Nicholson and Hall Ltd [1963] 3 All ER 849, the plaintiff’s contract was for a fixed
period of ten years from 

 306 

 March
1959 to March 1969 and could be terminated thereafter with six
months’ notice on either side. There were special pension
arrangements. In July 1962, the plaintiff was summarily dismissed by
the defendant. The plaintiff brought all action for wrongful
dismissal and for damages on a number of heads, including diminution
in the pension which he would have received under the staff pension
and assurance scheme, and the amount of premium payable under the
discretionary pension and life assurance scheme. 

 In
assessing damages for the plaintiff under these heads, Phillimore J
said: 




‘ In
assessing damages, I have to compensate the plaintiff for what he has
lost bearing in mind all the probabilities. No doubt it is probable
that an employer will avail himself of any powers which will serve to
relieve himself of liability and the court must approach the
assessment with that in mind.’ 




 The
judge then went on to consider the facts in the case. He said (at
page 857), “I have not seen the policies in question, but their
effect is summarised in the certificates of the correspondence”. 

 How
very different is the position in the instant case. There was no
specific claim for the respondent’s contribution to the pension
fund or for any other benefit under such a fund. The appellant
showed no dissatisfaction whatsoever with his pension fund refund and
accepted the cheque Without complaint. How then in those
circumstances, without one iota of evidence on which to base a
finding, could the trial judge make an assessment of damages in
favour of the appellant in relation to loss of pension benefits? In Lavarack v Woods of Colchester Ltd [1966] 3 All ER 683 the question of pensions was distinctly raised by
the pleadings and Diplock LJ could rightly say (at page 692): 




‘ The
plaintiff was accordingly entitled to be recompensed for the
likelihood that his employers would have continued to conduct their
business as a whole in such a way as to produce the event which would
have entitled him to claim pension contributions under his service
agreement if it had been performed.’ 




 When
the plaintiff went into the witness-box he gave evidence as to his
loss of earnings and spoke of the period from 13th August to 11th
October 1975. He made no claim to have been out of work at that time
or to have had difficulty in obtaining employment after his
dismissal. He did not complain that he was forced to take a less
remunerative position, or one with reduced status. He was absolutely
silent as to his then employment status or to his prospects of
re-employment. The appellant is quoted as saying in evidence: 




‘ My
loss of earnings for 13th August 1975 to 11th October 1975 amounts to
$340.67. I now say the loss of earnings amounts to $681.34. I ask
for compensation for the wrongful dismissal along with severance pay
and costs.’ 




 307 

 In
this state of the evidence, Mr Macaulay argued that the onus of proof
was on the respondent to show that the appellant, who was wrongfully
dismissed, had so mitigated his damages as not to be entitled to more
than nominal damages. He said that the trial judge ought to have
made a distinction between actual loss of earnings, ie special
damages, and general damages for the loss of prospects of alternative
employment, however small or however large that loss may be in
monetary terms. 

 The
first case cited by Mr Macaulay in support of this proposition is Beckham v Drake (1849) 13 Jur 921 at page 929. Beckham was employed by Drake under a
written contract for a period of seven years. It was agreed that, if
either party was in breach of the contract, he should pay to the
other the sum of £500 by way of (or in the nature of) specific
damages. Beckham was dismissed during the currency of the
contractual term. Subsequently Beckham became bankrupt and the
contest was as to whether the trustee in bankruptcy or the bankrupt
should have the benefit of the damages under the contract. In the
course of his judgment Earle J said: 




‘ The
measure of damages for the breach of promise now in question is
obtained by enquiring what is the usual rate of wages for the
employment here contracted for and what time would be lost before a
similar employment could be obtained. The law considers that
employment in any ordinary branch of industry can be obtained by a
person competent for the place, and that the usual rate of wages for
such employment can be proved and that when a promise for continuing
employment is broken by the master, it is the duty of the servant to
use diligence to find another employment ... If the breach of promise
had arisen because the present defendants retired from business, the
action would have lain, but if the defendants in answer to the claim
of damages, proved that another person carried on the same business
and offered the plaintiff the same situation at the same or higher
wages, the
claim for more than nominal damages would in my judgment ,
be at an end ...’ 




 This
case appears to be authority supportive of Mr Macaulay’s contention
that in addition to special damages (ie actual loss of earnings) the
appellant would be entitled to at least nominal damages for the
wrongful dismissal. But that was a case of a fixed-term contract
which had been breached and the facts and circumstances of which are
immeasurably different from those in the instant case. 

 In Edwards v Society of Graphical and Allied Trades [1970] 1 WLR 379, Edwards lost his membership in the union due to
non-deduction of his union dues by the employer and, as a direct
consequence, lost his employment and found difficulty in obtaining a
similar position. In setting out the principles applicable to the
assessment of the plaintiff’s damages for loss of earning capacity,
Buckley J said: 

 308 




‘ When
I say there is no forseeable likelihood of his obtaining any better
grade of employment I have to consider in relation to what sort of
period I ought to calculate the damage that he must be taken to have
suffered. In that connection I have been invited to apply by way of
analogy the sort of principles that are applied in cases of personal
injury where, having ascertained the loss of earning capacity of the
person injured, the court has then to try to make an estimate of his
probable earning life, and then discounting that, to multiply one
year’s loss of earning capacity by a suitable number of years to
arrive at a lump sum in damages. The burden must, I think, rest upon
the union to show that there is some sort of terminus ad quem at which the prospective period of the plaintiff being out of work in
his proper grade ought to be treated as likely to come to all end,
and they have not unfortunately, succeeded in satisfying me that
there is any such date.’ 




 We
do not find this case in any way helpful in deciding any issue in the
instant case. Edwards had led abundant evidence to show the extent
to which he was handicapped in the labour market so that not only his
past losses but his future pecuniary losses could be quantified. 
Once a plaintiff has shown affirmative loss under a particular head
of damage, then it is for the defendant, if he call, to adduce
evidence to the contrary, or such as would tend to minimise those
damages. Buckley J could have meant nothing more, when he spoke of
the burden on the defendant union to adduce evidence. 

 Grounds
6 and 7 were argued together. They complained that: 




‘ 6.
 The trial judge impliedly did not advert his mind to section 3(5) of
the Employment (Termination and Reundancy Payments) Act which
preserves the common law in relation to breaches of contract of
employment. 

 7.
 Impliedly the trial judge did not advert his mind to the legal
consequences of the [appellant’s] unchallenged evidence as to the
receipt of severance pay by other employees within six days of the
termination of his employment and the admission by the counsel for
the [respondent] that shortly after [appellant’s] dismissal the
[respondent] took a decision to cease operations. In this respect
sections 5(2)( a ),
10(1)( c ),
and the definition of ‘Relevant Date’ in Section 2(1) of the
Employment (Termination and Redundancy Payments) Act, refer.’ 




 At
common law a contract of service could be terminated by the giving of
reasonable notice or the payment of wages in lieu of such notice,
unless there was some stipulation in the contract to the contrary or
the contract was to be interpreted by reason of some special
customary rule. A convenient summary of the common law rules appears
in Fridman’s Modern Law of Employment page 471 where he said: 

 309 




‘ Since
a failure to give reasonable notice is breach of an implied term in
the contract of employment, a dismissal without such notice will be
actionable and the damages recoverable will be the wages which would
have been carried during the period of notice. Hence, payment of
wages instead of the giving of notice will prevent the dismissal from
being wrongful and actionable, for the payment of the wages is the
payment of what are, in effect liquidated damages in advance of an
action.’ 




 Lord
Denman CJ said in Hartley v Harman (1840) 11 Ad&amp;El 798 that, “it appeared to me that the
stipulation as to a month implied a month’s warning or a month’s
wages”. And Hill J in Gordon v Potter (1859) 1 F&amp;F 644, went further in saying: 




‘ A
master had a right to discharge a servant simply by payment of a
month’s wages, in addition to the accruing wages up to the time of
the discharge.’ 




 Of
course all employee who is dismissed by his employer is not compelled
to accept wages in lieu of notice. In that case, however, he would
not be entitled to receive his wages until the expiration of the
notice period. It was held by Swinfen Eady J in W. Dennis&amp;Sons v Tunnard Bros and Moore (1911) 56 SJ 162 that it is not competent for a servant to contend
that he had been wrongfully dismissed when, instead of being given a
week’s notice to quit in accordance with the terms of his contract,
he is paid a week’s salary and dismissed. 

 Moore
had been employed under a written contract which provided for the
termination of the employment by one week’s notice on either side
and contained the usual convenant in restraint of trade. The manager
of the plaintiff’s company summoned Moore to his office, gave him
certain reasons and dispensed with his services forthwith. At the
same time he told Moore that the cashier had been instructed to pay
Moore his next week’s wages. It was contended for Moore that the
transaction amounted to a wrongful dismissal in law, with a tender of
the amount of damages which could be recovered by an action at law
(namely the amount of the wages corresponding to the period of the
notice to quit which was required to be given under the contract) and
that, accordingly, Moore was not bound by the covenant in restraint
of trade. Swinfen Eady J did not accept the argument. He reasoned
thus: 




‘ The
manager in effect says: the company dispenses with your services, and
the cashier is instructed to pay you your one week’s salary in lieu
of notice. The transaction is, in my opinion, as if the manager had
said: ‘I give you one week’s notice now and I will pay you your
one week’s salary now; so you need not come up next week; I will
pay it you now instead’. The plaintiffs thought they were acting
in accordance with the agreement. If the defendant had said: I will
not accept the money in lieu of a week’s notice, he would then 

 310 

 not
have been entitled to his money till the end of the next week.’ 




 In
our view then, Mr Macaulay rightly conceded that at common law the
appellant could properly have been dismissed by being given one
mouth’s notice, or one month’s pay in lieu of such notice. Mr
Macaulay made it clear that his complaints in grounds 6 and 7 were
not addressed to the question of reasonable notice, but rather they
drew upon the several provisions of the Employment (Termination and
Redundancy Payments) Act 1974 (hereinafter called “the Act”) for
validity. 

 By
virtue Of section 3(1)( a )
of the Act an employee with more than four weeks’ consecutive
employment but less than five years’ continuous employment may not
be dismissed with less than two weeks’ notice. This uniform
minimum notice of two weeks is less beneficial to employees who are
paid monthly than the common law rules. Section 3(3)( a )
of the Act provides: 




‘ The
provisions of subsection (1) and (2) shall not be taken - ( a )
to prevent either party to a contract of employment from waiving his
right to notice at the time of termination, or from accepting a
payment in lieu of notice, or from giving or accepting notice of
longer duration than that of the relevant notice specified in those
subsections’. 




 In
our view section 3(3)( a )
of the Act preserves the position at common law in respect of the
giving and acceptance of pay in lieu of notice. The appellant was
perfectly at liberty to have refused to accept the cheque No 82597
for $557.65 dated 11th August 1975, which was attached to his letter
of dismissal, as also the further cheque No 82600 dated 11th August
1975 for $340.67. But the appellant accepted the cheques and the
inescapable inference from the acceptance of those cheques is that
they were accepted in lieu of notice; W
Dennis&amp;Sons V Tunnard Bros and Moore (1911) 56 SJ 162. 

 The
appellant’s attorney attempted to Mount an argument that the
appellant’s dismissal was attributable wholly or partly to the fact
that the respondent had intended to cease to carry on its business in
the place where the appellant was employed. There was no pleading to
this effect by the appellant and no such argument was addressed to
the trial judge. However, Mr Macaulay submitted that whether or not
there was an intention on the part of the respondent to cease to
carry on business is a question of fact to be drawn from the evidence
before the court. A dismissal, he said, by reason of redundancy may
be express or implied, or to be presumed in law. He conceded that
where the nature of the claim was based on either primary facts or
secondary facts, it was necessary that they should be pleaded as the
rules of court require that facts be pleaded. He said that where the
claim was based on a presumption in law, it was not necessary to
plead it, if the presumption appeared on the evidence, because it was
the duty of the court, if evidence was before the court, to give
effect to the presumption in law. 

 Interesting
as these submissions are, we are of the view that they are 

 311 

 irrelevant
in the instant case. There was no admissible evidence of the date
when the respondent ceased to carry on business at the place where
the appellant was employed, nor of the date when the respondent
formed the intention to close down its Jamaican operations. The
evidence of the appellant (which was admitted at the trial) to the
effect that:: 




‘ When
I got the letter [in] evidence I hadn’t heard about the
[respondent] closing down operations. I heard that six days after I
got the letter’ 




 was
clearly hearsay in so far as it purports to prove the date on which
the respondent decided to terminate operations in Jamaica or to pay
severance pay to its employees. What is referred to in ground 7 as
“unchallenged evidence” is really no more than inadmissible
hearsay evidence. 

 The
general rule at common law is that he who alleges Must prove; and
there is nothing in the Act to displace this burden of proof. One
can compare the position in the United Kingdom where the Redundancy
Payments Act 1965, in section 9(2)( b )
provided that: 

‘ An
employee who has been dismissed by his employer shall, unless the
contrary is proved, be presumed to have been so dismissed by reason
of redundancy.’ 




 In
the absence of such a statutory presumption, the general rule
applies. It is our view that the appellant’s dismissal took effect
on 15th August 1975 and this view is supported by the definition of
“the relevant date” in section 2(1) of the Act which provides: 




‘ The
relevant date in relation to the dismissal of all employee means: -
( b )
where his contract of employment is terminated without notice,
whether by the employer or the employee, the date on which the
termination takes effect’. 




 See
also Ryan v Liverpool Warehousing Ltd [1966] ITR 69. 

 We
hold that the instant case falls to be determined on common law
principles because on neither the pleadings nor on the evidence has
the appellant brought himself within the provisions of the Act so as
to enable the court to grant him redundancy payment. We hold
further, that applying common law principles, the appellant has not
proved any loss of future earnings nor any entitlement to pension
funds over and above that which has been paid to him by the
respondent. We hold that, the appellant having accepted the cheques
for four weeks’ payment in lieu of notice and on the concession of
his attorney that he was making no complaint as to reasonable time,
judgment was properly entered for the respondent. Accordingly, the
appeal is dismissed with costs to be taxed or agreed. 

 Appeal
dismissed.

OF APPEAL OF JAMAICA 

 HENRY,

 20TH
MARCH 28TH APRIL 1980 

 Criminal
law – Indictment – Joinder of counts – Capital and non-capital
counts – Irregularity – Evidence on non-capital admissible on
capital count 

 The
applicant was charged with the murder of his concubine (count 1) and
with wounding his infant daughter with intent to murder her (count
2). Both counts arose out of a single incident; and both were
included in the same indictment. The applicant was convicted on both
counts, despite the irregularity of joining a capital charge with a
non-capital charge in a single indictment. On appeal, 

 Held – (1) dismissing the appeal against conviction on count 1, that had
the indictment been confined to a single count for murder evidence in
relation to the injuries inflicted on the child in the course of the
same incident would have been admissible as part of the res gestae ;
accordingly, any prejudice caused to the applicant by that evidence
could not be said to involve a serious risk that the jury’s verdict
was unsafe or unsatisfactory. 

 Cottle
and Laidlow v R (1976) 22 WIR 543 distinguished. 

 (2)
Allowing the appeal against conviction on count 2, that the joinder
of counts relating to capital and non-capital charges in one
indictment was irregular and, in consequence, the conviction on count
2 could not stand.

 Appeal 

 Appeal George McLeish applied to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica (criminal
appeal 232/78) for leave to appeal against his convictions for the
murder of Pansy Miller and for wounding their infant daughter with
intent to murder her. The Court of Appeal treated the application
for leave as an appeal; and on 20th March 1980 the court allowed the
appeal in part and reserved its reasons.

Edwards QC and Lloyd Shackleford for the applicant

 Miss
Hyacinth Walker for the Crown 

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Henry
JA delivered the judgment of the court. The applicant was convicted in
the St Elizabeth circuit court on both counts of an indictment
charging him with murder and wounding with intent to murder. The
charges arose out of all incident in which the applicant is alleged
to have used a machete to inflict some eleven wounds on his concubine
(Pansy Miller) and two on their infant daughter, killing Miss Miller. 

 Counsel
for the applicant very properly conceded that, while it may have been
possible to put forward complaints in respect of certain portions of
the summing-up, the facts were such that (as he put it) any Court of
Appeal would have applied the proviso and dismissed the appeal. The
questions which have engaged our attention in this matter, however,
are the propriety of joining a capital and non-capital charge in one
indictment; and the consequences which flow if the joinder was
irregular. 

 Sections
31 and 44 of the Jury Act read as follows: 




‘ 31.
 (1) On trials on indictment for murder and treason, twelve jurors
shall form the array, and subject to the provisions of subsection (3)
the trial shall proceed before such jurors. 

 (2)
On trials on indictment before the circuit court for any criminal
case, other than murder or treason, seven jurors shall form the
array. 

 (3)
( a )
Where in the course of a criminal trial any member of the jury dies
or is discharged by the court through illness or other sufficient
cause, the jury shall nevertheless, so long as the number of its
members is not reduced by more than one, be considered as remaining
for all the purposes of that trial properly constituted, and the
trial shall proceed and a verdict may be given accordingly. 

 ( b )
Where one juror has died or has been discharged as provided for in
this subsection, the verdict of eleven jurors in a trial for murder
or treason or of six jurors in a trial for any other offence, shall
be deemed to be a unanimous verdict of the jury, and in the case of a
trial – (i) for murder, a verdict of not less than nine jurors of
manslaughter; or (ii) for any offence other than murder or treason, a
verdict of not less than five jurors, may in accordance with the
provisions of section 44, be received and entered as a verdict of the
jury. 

 44.
 (1) On trials on indictment for murder or treason, the unanimous
verdict of the jury shall be necessary for the conviction or
acquittal of any person for murder or treason. 

 (2)
On a trial on indictment for murder, after the lapse of one hour from
the retirement of the jury a verdict of a majority of not less than
nine to three of conviction of manslaughter, or of acquittal of
manslaughter, may be received by the court as the verdict of the
Jury. 

 314 

 (3)
On trials on indictment before the circuit court for offences other
than murder or treason, the verdict of the jury may be unanimous, or
a verdict of a majority of not less than five to two may, after the
lapse of one hour from the retirement of the jury, be received by the
court as the verdict of the jury. 

 (4)
Whenever the verdict of the jury is not unanimous the judge may
direct the jury to retire for further consideration.’ 




 It
is clear from these sections that different modes of trial by jury
are provided for capital and non-capital offences, and that a
non-capital offence cannot be tried by a twelve-man jury. 
Consequently, an indictment charging both types of offences and a
trial on that indictment are irregular. A similar situation arose in Cottle and Laidlow v R (1976) 22 WIR 543. There, however, the charges arose out of separate
incidents about an hour apart. The appellant had been convicted on
count 1 of the indictment for murder (arising out of the first
incident) and on count 3 for shooting with intent (arising out of the
second). In the subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal of the West
Indies Associated States, that court quashed the conviction on count
3 only. On appeal to the Privy Council the conviction on count 1 was
also quashed. Lord Diplock in delivering reasons for the judgment of
the Privy Council said (at page 546): 




‘ [The
Court of Appeal] held, correctly in their Lordships’ view, that the
trial of the appellants by a jury of twelve on the non-capital counts
was contrary to the provisions of the Jury Ordinance. They
accordingly quashed the convictions of the appellants on count 3. 
They did not, however, treat the whole trial as a nullity or
interfere with the conviction on count 1 for the capital offence of
murder. 

 No
argument had been addressed to them by counsel, as it has to their
Lordships’ Board, about the effect that their ruling that the trial
upon counts 2 and 3 was a nullity should have upon the trial for
murder upon count 1. 

 At
the conclusion of their judgment, they dealt briefly with the
question whether the appellants had been prejudiced in their defences
to the charge of murder by the admission of evidence relating to the
charge of wounding Mr Gaymes in a trial which ought to have been
restricted to the charge of murdering Mr Rawle. They pointed out
that the judge in his summing-up had made it clear to the jury that
they were to consider the evidence relating to each count separately.
 In the view of the Court of Appeal this removed any risk ‘that the
jury when considering one count may have been unable to disregard the
evidence relating to the others’. 

 Evidence
tending to show that the appellants had committed another offence of
violence with firearms would be highly prejudicial to them as
suggesting to the jury that they were the sort of men who were likely
to commit a murder. Unless there were grounds on which this evidence
would have been admissible on the charge of murder 

 315 

 of
Mr Rawle if it had stood alone, its admission would constitute a
material irregularity in the course of the trial and the prejudice
thereby inexcusably created would, in their Lordships’ view,
involve a serious risk that the jury’s verdict would be unsafe or
unsatisfactory.’ 




 Following
on this decision, counsel for the applicant submitted that evidence
in relation to the injuries to the applicant’s child was similarly
prejudicial and his conviction on both counts of the indictment ought
to be quashed. We do not agree with this submission. As we have
indicated, the counts arose out of a single incident and, even if the
indictment had been properly confined to a single count for murder,
evidence in relation to the injuries to the applicant’s child would
have been admissible as part of the res gestae .
 There was consequently no improper prejudice created against the
applicant by that evidence so as to “involve a serious risk that
the jury’s verdict would be unsafe or unsatisfactory” in so far
as the charge of murder was concerned. 

 There
remains however the irregularity arising from the joinder of the
counts in the indictment. In our view the consequence of this
irregularity is that, as in Cottle and Laidlow v R ,
the conviction on count 2 of the indictment for wounding with intent
to murder cannot stand. 

 Accordingly
on 20th March the application for leave to appeal was treated as an
appeal. The appeal in relation to count 1 was dismissed and the
conviction and sentence on that count affirmed. The appeal in
relation to count 2 was allowed and the conviction and sentence on
that count set aside. 

 Appeal
allowed in part.

 9TH
JULY 28TH NOVEMBER 5TH DECEMBER 1979, 6TH MAY 1980 

 Criminal
law – Accused – Unsworn statement – Attack on prosecution
witness – Allegation of serious misconduct – Reference in
summing-up to propriety of attack in unsworn statement –
Misdirection 

 Criminal
evidence – Locus in quo – Inspection by jury – Inspection
necessitating presence of accused and witnesses – Request for
inspection after completion of summing-up 

 D
and E made statements under caution to the police and these were
recorded in the presence of a justice of the peace. In the
statements each admitted being present at the scene of a murder but
each denied striking the fatal blow. They were charged with murder
and put on trial. They challenged the admissibility of their
statements on the ground that they had not been made voluntarily. On
a voire dire ,
the trial judge ruled that each statement was admissible. In the
course of the trial the relevant prosecution witnesses were
cross-examined regarding the statements; in particular, on behalf of
D, it was suggested that material facts had been added to his
statement by the police during a temporary absence of the justice of
the peace and that, when he signed the statement, D believed that he
was signing a charge sheet. In an unsworn statement from the dock, D
stated that he had not been near the scene of the murder on the night
in question; nor had he seen the deceased on that night. He further
stated that he had been ill-treated at the police station, part of
his statement had been fabricated by the police, and that when he
signed the statement he believed that it was a charge sheet. In his
summing-up, the trial judge told the jury that D was entitled to make
an unsworn statement from the dock; but that his right to do so did
not extend to making very serious allegations of misconduct against a
police officer; if he wished to make such allegations, he should have
given sworn testimony so that it could be tested in
cross-examination. After the jury had retired to consider their
verdict, they requested an opportunity to visit the locus in quo so that they could see where the deceased’s body had been found and
where it was alleged that D and E had been working previously. The
trial judge ruled that there could be no inspection of the locus after the summing-up had been completed. Both D and E were convicted
and sentenced to death. On appeal, 

 317 

 Held – (1) allowing D’s appeal against conviction and ordering a
retrial, although the trial judge was fully entitled to comment on
D’s election to make an unsworn statement rather than to give
evidence from the witness-box, it was a misdirection for him to have
said that the allegations as to police misconduct made by D were
improper since they were relevant to his defence, in that they
supported the line of questioning in the cross-examination of the
prosecution witnesses, and the misdirection was likely to have
precluded the jury from giving fair consideration to the issue. 

 R
v O’Neill, R v Ackers (1950) 34 Cr App Rep 108 considered. 

 (2)
Dismissing E’s appeal against conviction, the examination of the locus in quo requested by the jury would have required the attendance of D, E and
some of the prosecution witnesses and would have involved
demonstrations or the answering of questions; accordingly, it would
have been tantamount to adducing further evidence after the
completion of the summing-up and the trial judge had properly
rejected the request.

 Appeals 

 Appeals Owen Donaldson and Seymour Edwards applied to the Court of Appeal of
Jamaica (criminal appeals 286/77, 287/77) for leave to appeal against
their convictions and sentences by Willkie J and a jury in the St
Thomas circuit court for murder. The Court of Appeal treated the
applications for leave to appeal as appeals; it allowed Donaldson’s
appeal against 

 318 

 conviction
and Edwards’s appeal against sentence, and reserved its reasons. 
The facts are set out in the judgment of the court delivered by Kerr
JA 

 Dennis
Daly for Donaldson 

 K
D Knight and B E Frankson for Edwards 

 Mrs
Z Holness and M J Dukharan for the Crown 

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Kerr
JA delivered the judgment of the court. The appellants were convicted
in the St Thomas circuit court before Willkie J and a jury of the
murder of Augustus Samuels and were sentenced to death. 

 After
hearing full and careful arguments from the attorneys on both sides
we allowed the appeal against conviction in respect of appellant
Donaldson and ordered a new trial. 

 With
respect to the appellant Edwards we dismissed his appeal against
conviction, but were moved to set aside the sentence of death and
substitute the following: “To be detained during Her Majesty’s
pleasure”. This was in response to the following unchallenged
ground of appeal: 




‘ The
trial judge erred in law in holding that, in as far as sentence as
concerned, the age of the [appellant] was relevant at the time of the
trial and not at the time of the offence.’ 




 It
was conceded by the Crown and as appeared from the record that the
appellant Edwards was at the time of the offence under the age of
eighteen years. Subsequent to the Privy Council’s decision in Baker v R (1975) 23 WIR 463 the legislature by Act 39 of 1975 amended the
Juvenile Act and Section 29(1) thereof now provides: 




‘ Sentence
of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded against a person
convicted of an offence if it appears to the court that at the time
when the offence was committed he was under the age of eighteen
years, but in place thereof the court shall sentence him to be
detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure ...’ 




 It
is obvious that the trial judge’s attention was not drawn to this
comparatively recent amendment and he erred in law in so sentencing
Edwards. 

 Because
of the order made in respect of Donaldson, we do not consider it
necessary or prudent to review in depth nor comment upon the evidence
(or the trial judge’s review of it), except in so far as it is
necessary to deal with the questions raised on appeal. 

 The
deceased up to the time of his death lived in a two-apartment house
on a plot of land at Top Hill, Seaforth, in the parish of St Thomas. 
There he reared and kept goats in a mesh wire pen and cultivated
vegetables. On 14th May 1977, his dead body was found in adjoining
premises near the dividing fence with wounds to his head. Dr Ronald 

 319 

 Lampart
who performed the postmortem found: 

 [ On
external examination -] 




‘ (1)
A laceration of the forehead approximately 2½ inches long extending
to the skull ... 

 (2)
There was all abrasion of his left hand ... 

 (3)
There is a contusion, that is a swelling, and small laceration of
posterior aspect of the skull and neck, that is the back of the neck. 

 [ On
dissection -] 

 (a)
A fracture of the occipital region, that is the back of the skull ... 

 (b)
There was a large haematoma, that is a swelling.’ 




 In
his opinion death was due to concussion following a fracture of the
skull which could have been caused by direct impact (either by being
hit by a stone, or falling and hitting the skull), and the contusion
and abrasion by being hit by a stick. 

 The
case for the prosecution rested in the main on circumstantial
evidence supported in certain vital areas by admissions in
statements: oral and written from the two appellants. Henry Brown, a
lad of fifteen years, said that on Saturday, 14th May, at about 10.00
p m while at home about one-quarter of a mile away from that of the
deceased he heard him bawling out and he recalled the words: 




‘ Lawd
God, oonu bus’ me head, oonu bruck me hand oonu lick Out me eye,
ooi’... I heard him said the same things that I talk little while;
seh, ‘Lawd God, oonu bus’ me head, lick out me eye. Oonu come in
a me house and bruck me hand and lick out me eye’.’ 




 The
following morning (about 7.00 am) as a result of what one Delroy
Samuels had told him, they both went to the home of the deceased and
there on the adjoining premises near the line he saw the dead body of
the deceased. He raised an alarm and others came. He identified the
appellants as persons he had known before: Donaldson for two months
and Edwards over one year; and that, at the time, they were living at
the Johnsons’ yard about one-quarter of a mile from the deceased;
and that on the Thursday before (at about noon) he had witnessed an
incident between the appellants and the deceased. They were on the
land of the deceased cutting his fence and digging his yams; when the
deceased called to them, they threw stones at him. He was
cross-examined as to the opportunity of recognising or identifying
the appellants. 

 Annette
Johnson and her sister Veronica Kerr (who was the girl-friend of
Donaldson) gave evidence that both appellants were living in their
yard at the time and, on that Saturday evening (between 6.30 and 7.00
p m) they both left the home. They described the clothes they were
wearing, down to Donaldson’s tractor-bottom boots. According to
Kerr, Donaldson returned about 9.30 to 10.00 p m and at that time she
also heard Edwards’s voice. The following morning (on her return
from Seaforth) she told Donaldson of the death of the deceased. 
Later she and 

 320 

 Donaldson
went to the police station at Seaforth. She denied in cross-
examination seeing the police beating or ill-treating either
appellant. 

 Norman
Johnson, who shared a room with Edwards said that both appellants
left for Seaforth that afternoon and he never saw Edwards at about
9.30 p m nor Donaldson the following morning. Sergeant V Marshall
(the senior police officer in the investigations on the morning of
15th May) as a result of a report went to the home of the deceased
and his observations at the scene included: (i) all open back door
with impressions on the door facing indicative of being forced open;
(ii) an axe by the steps leading to that door; (iii) the bolt from
the door lying on the floor; (iv) a stone in a bed; (v) a portion of
the mesh wire forming the goat pen chopped down; (vi) the body of
deceased, fully clothed, lying in the adjoining premises; (vii)
wounds to the forehead and back of head; and (viii) impressions of
“tractor-bottom” boots at the goat pen. 

 The
body was removed to the Princess Margaret Hospital. Later that
morning he saw Donaldson and Veronica Kerr on the road near the gate
of the deceased. He took them in his Land-Rover to their home where
he took possession of Donaldson’s “tractor-bottom” boots and,
at his invitation, they accompanied him to the Seaforth police
station. Later Edwards was brought to the station. Both men were
interrogated in each other’s presence. It is unnecessary to review
what transpired, except to note that during the interrogation Edwards
admitted that he gave the deceased one blow with a stick after he
fell over the line. As a result of information received from Edwards
and from Veronica Kerr he returned to the home of the appellants and
took as potential exhibits clothing and two sticks which he had
previously seen in a pit latrine there. On the night of 15th May
(about 7.30 p m) he arrested them for murder and transferred them to
the Morant Bay lock-up. Detective Corporal Wilbert Watson gave
evidence of his assisting in the investigations. He said that, about
11.15 on 16th May, Edwards (who was in the lock-up at Morant Bay)
spoke to him to the effect he would like to give a statement. He
thereupon telephoned Mr C J Todd, a justice Of the peace, who
attended at the station about fifteen minutes later. Edwards was
taken to the criminal investigation department’s office where, in
the presence and hearing of the justice of the peace, under the usual
caution a statement written down by Cpl Watson at Edwards’s request
was taken and witnessed by the justice of the peace. On the
following day (as a result of a message which he had received) he
went to the cell where Donaldson was. Donaldson told him that he had
heard that Edwards had given a statement and, although he was
cautioned, he said that he wanted to tell his side of the story. Mr
C J Todd was again sent for; he attended and in the criminal
investigation department’s office Donaldson (under caution and in
the presence of the justice of the peace) dictated a statement which
Cpl Watson took down in writing, observing the usual formalities. 

 In
a trial within a trial in the absence of the jury, the admissibility
of 

 321 

 both
statements was strongly challenged on the ground that they were not
voluntary; Cpl Watson, Mr Todd and Sgt Marshall were extensively
cross-examined. Mr Todd as to the circumstances of the taking of the
statement and whether, in relation to Donaldson, he was absent from
the room during the taking of the statement. Corporal Watson and Sgt
Marshall denied the suggestions that ill-treatment and/or threats
were meted out to the appellants by themselves, or by any-one to
their knowledge. Edwards gave evidence of being taken to the
guard-room at Seaforth and seeing Donaldson with only his briefs on;
of being made to sit on the floor and of being beaten; that he was
kicked on his testicles and had to be taken to the doctor; and that
the statement which he gave to Cpl Watson was under the fear of being
beaten again. He was cross- examined at length by Counsel for the
Crown. He called Cons Hines, who said that he took him to the doctor
sometime in May; but the medical journal bore the date 20th June
1977. After lengthy submissions on the question of admissibility,
the trial judge admitted the statement of each appellant. 

 It
is unnecessary to refer in any detail to the contents; but each
appellant placed himself on the scene with the deceased at the
material time, but denied striking the fatal blow. 

 There
was in relation to both statements an encore before the jury in the
cross-examination of the relevant prosecution witnesses. In the case
of Edwards, the issue before the jury was simple and clear-cut: what
weight, if any, should be given to the statement, having regard to
the circumstances (such as they may find) under which it was given. 
For Donaldson the issue was more complex: for, in addition, they had
to consider the genuineness or reality of the statement, ie whether
or not the material facts (or some of them) in it came from the lips
of Donaldson or were added or fabricated by Cpl Watson during the
absence of Mr Todd, the justice of the peace who had been
clandestinely lured away, or that when he signed the statement he was
led to believe that he was signing a “charge sheet”. 

 In
his defence Donaldson made all unsworn statement from the dock in
which he spoke of meeting Edwards at Seaforth and, at his request,
going with him along the road towards Top Hill; of (on reaching the
Johnsons’ premises) refusing to go any further with him along a
certain road but turning back and that, some minutes after, Edwards
returned and joined him. He never went near the premises of the
deceased; nor did he see the deceased that night. 

 This
was materially different from the written statement in evidence and,
in particular, that he had gone with Edwards to the premises of the
deceased and had flung a stone at the deceased as he was coming
towards him as he did not know the intention of the deceased. In his
statement from the dock he averred that, at the Seaforth police
station his clothes were taken off, he was put to sit on the floor,
bastinadoed and boxed and, when he denied killing the deceased, Sgt
Marshall kicked him in the side. That while at Morant Bay he was
taken to a room where Cpl 

 322 

 Watson
and the justice of the peace were. Corporal Watson was writing; the
justice of the peace was away for twenty minutes while Cpl Watson
questioned him; when the justice of the peace returned, he asked the
justice of the peace to sign what he was writing; and that he (ie
Donaldson) signed what was purported by Cpl Watson to be a charge
sheet. 

 Edwards
gave evidence on oath of being in Seaforth the night in question and
of meeting Donaldson there; of buying flashlight batteries and of
asking Donaldson to follow him to gather some bean sticks which he
had left by the road; that, on the way, Donaldson complained that it
was too far and turned back; that he collected his sticks and , in
passing a yard, a dog ran at him and then a mail ran at him; and he
flung a stick at him and ran away to his grandfather’s yard. On
the next day he heard of the man’s death; he did not then know his
name. 

 While
on the road four men came and bound him and took him to the police
station where he saw Donaldson “strip naked”. He was told that
if he did not say that it was he who killed the man, they would beat
and kill him; so “because me no want no more lick the tell them say
a me”. Both Cpl Watson and Sgt Marshall were at the Seaforth
police station when he was being beaten. When he was being
transferred to Morant Bay Sgt Marshall threatened him; and the
statement which he gave at Morant Bay was because he was afraid of
getting more beating. He was cross-examined at length against the
background of evidence given by certain witnesses for the
prosecution. He said that he had seen the deceased before, but did
not know he was “Gussie”; he did not know if the stick he flung
caught the deceased. He was unable to account for the blood on the
shirt he wore that night; and he denied the truth of all the
important particulars in the cautioned statement when put to him in
cross-examination. 

 Leave
was sought and granted the attorneys for the appellants to argue a
number of supplementary grounds of appeal in lieu of those filed with
the record. 

 Of
those in relation to Donaldson only the following merited our careful
consideration: 




‘ That
the trial judge’s comments that it was ‘grossly improper for the
accused man to seek the refuge of the dock and at the same time make
serious allegations of criminal misconduct’ by Crown witnesses,
went beyond the permissible boundaries of adverse comment which a
trial judge is entitled to make of all accused who gives an unsworn
statement, and gravely prejudiced the defence.’ 




 As
the basis for his submissions, we were referred to the following
passages in the summing-up: 




‘ I
will, remind you of the evidence in relation to the statements. 
Before doing so, however, you remember, as I told you, Sgt Marshall
was cross-examined rather severely by both counsel and suggestions 

 323 

 were
made to him that he had threatened and beaten Donaldson; the same
thing about Edwards, but you arc concerned about Donaldson now. Now,
some very serious allegations were made by Donaldson through his
counsel on the conduct of Sgt Marshall. Now, Donaldson gave a
statement from the dock as was his right. You remember when he was
called on he was told that he could say nothing at all because there
is no onus on him to prove his innocence; or he could make a
statement from the dock where he would not be cross-examined, or he
could go and give sworn testimony where he would be cross- examined,
and he elected to give an unsworn statement from the dock where he
can’t be cross-examined. As I told you, it is quite proper. He
was exercising his right, but that right does not extend to making
very serious allegations against a police officer of misconduct,
criminal misconduct. If you are going to make those allegations
against the police officer you should give sworn testimony so it can
be tested, just as Sgt Marshall was subjected to cross-examination
and testing of his testimony that these statements were given
voluntarily and freely, and it is grossly improper for the accused
man to seek the refuge of the dock and at the same time make serious
allegations of criminal misconduct on the part of Sgt Marshall, and
you should bear this in mind when you come to consider the evidence
as to whether what this man says is true or what Sgt Marshall says is
true. You should bear in mind that he made a statement about it,
that the statement was not tested in cross-examination, because this
is how you test a statement a person makes, in cross-examination, as
to whether he is telling the truth.’ 




 again,
a little further on: 




‘ As
I told you before, it is improper for him to seek the refuge of the
dock if he is making serious allegations of serious misconduct on the
part of the police.’ 




 and: 




‘ The
accused man has not gone into the witness box where his allegations,
his evidence of these allegations, could be tested. He sought refuge
in the dock to make these allegations against the police officer and
the justice of the peace because if it is so it would be criminal
misconduct on their part.’ 




 Mr
Daly frankly conceded that it was proper for a trial judge to comment
on an accused making a statement from the dock instead of giving
evidence on oath; and, in the instant case, having regard to the
nature of the defence, some comment was to be expected; but he
contended that, in doing so, the trial judge went beyond the
permissible limits by telling the jury in effect that Donaldson had
no right to make certain allegations in his statement from the dock,
and that this misdirection denied the appellant a fair consideration
of a vital issue in 

 324 

 the
case. He sought support for his submissions in pertinent passages
from a number of decided cases including R v Mutch [1973] 1 All ER 178, R
v Sparrow [1973] 2 All ER 129 and Director of Public Prosecutions v Walker (1974) 21 WIR 406. 

 In
reply, counsel for the Crown submitted that the summing-up on this
aspect of the case should be considered as a whole and adverted our
attention to other passages and, in particular, to the following: 




‘ Donaldson
did not give evidence, he made a statement from the dock and, as I
told you before in connection with his defence, it is perfectly
legitimate for him to do so. Remember the registrar called on him
and told him he could do one of three things. He could either say
nothing, and the reason for this is because there is never any burden
on an accused person to prove his innocence in this country. He is
presumed to be innocent unless you, by your verdict, say that he is
guilty. The burden is on the Crown to prove his guilt to your
satisfaction. So he was told that he need not say anything at all;
or he could go in the witness-box and give evidence on oath where he
is liable to be cross- examined; or he could stay in the dock and
give a statement from there. He elected to stay in the dock and give
a statement. It is a right. It is not a privilege, it is a right
that he has, and if any person exercises his rights under the laws of
this country, the exercise of this right cannot be held to his
prejudice. In other words, you can’t say, ‘because him stay
there and talk I going find him guilty’, otherwise the right would
mean nothing. 

 It
was a right that he has and it is a right that he utilised and you
can’t infer anything prejudicial to him in regard to the exercise
of that right. It is for you, however, to say what weight you are
going to place on the statement that he has given because you have to
bear in mind that what he said was not tested in cross-examination. 
This is how you evaluate and assess evidence given by a person, when
it’s tested in cross-examination. So what he has said is not
evidence in the case, it is a statement he has given unsworn. But it
is a matter; - he has said, you have heard, it and you must say what
weight, what value, you place on it.’ 




 Further
she argued that in the light of this passage (which followed those
passages referred to by Mr Daly) such prejudicial effect, if any,
would have been effectively removed. In any event, having regard to
the conduct of the defence the comments were perfectly proper. In
this regard she relied on dicta in R v O’Neill, R v Ackers (1950) 34 Cr App Rep 108. 

 It
is beyond debate that a trial judge may comment on the failure of all
accused to testify. The nature of the comments, understandably, will
depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. The instant
case (having regard to the nature and conduct of the defence) fell
within the type of cases in which comments on the failure of the
accused to testify may be expected, as categorised in Director of Public Prosecutions v Walker 

 325 

 (1974)
21 WIR 406 at page 411. 

 As
was said in R v Sparrow [1973] 2 All ER 129 at page 135: 




‘ ...
if the trial judge had not commented in strong terms on the
appellant’s absence from the witness-box, he would have been
failing in his duty. The object of a summing-up is to help the jury
and in our experience a jury is not helped by a colourless reading
out of the evidence as recorded by the judge in his notebook. The
judge is more than a mere referee who takes no part in the trial save
to intervene when a rule of procedure or evidence is broken. He and
the jury try the case together and it is his duty to give them the
benefit of his knowledge of the law and to advise them in the light
of his experience as to the significance of the evidence; and when
all accused person elects not to give evidence, in most cases but not
all, the judge should explain to the jury what the consequences of
his absence from the witness-box are and if, in his discretion, he
thinks that he should do so more than once, he may; but he must keep
in mind always his duty to be fair.’ 




 The
question to which we gave our anxious consideration was whether or
not the directions of which complaint was made were fair, having
regard to all the circumstances and in the sense that the issue to
which they related was fairly left to the jury for their
determination. 

 The
jury’s careful assessment of the cautioned statement was vital as,
in that statement, there was an admission of being on the scene and
being involved with the co-accused in an incident with the deceased
on the fatal night; and, if this were accepted by the jury, it would
effectively destroy the defence that Donaldson was never on the scene
at the material time. It was an important link, perhaps the most
important one, in the case for the prosecution. 

 In
the attack upon the voluntariness and genuineness of the statement
the appellant’s attorney in cross-examination. put suggestive
questions involving serious imputations on the character and
integrity of police officers Marshall and Watson and the justice of
the peace, Mr Todd Donaldson’s election to make an unsworn
statement denied the prosecution the opportunity of cross-examining
him, not only as to the allegations but (as may be permissible under
the Evidence Act, section 9( f )(ii))
as to his own character. Clearly the situation demanded comments
from the trial judge. In R v O’Neill, R v Ackers (1950) 34 Cr App Rep 108 at page 111, Lord Goddard CJ in the Court of
Criminal Appeal in commenting on a similar situation had this to say: 




‘ In
this case, a violent attack was made on the police. It was suggested
that they had done improper things, and indeed, Ackers repeats that
suggestion in his notice of appeal. The applicants had the
opportunity of going into the box at the trial and explaining and
supporting what they had instructed their counsel to say. They did
not dare to go into the box, and, therefore, counsel, who knew that
they were not going 

 326 

 into
the box, ought not to have made these suggestions against the police.
 It is one thing to cross-examine properly and temperately with
regard to credit, though it is very dangerous to do so unless you
have material on which to cross-examine, and with which you can
confront the witness. It is, however, entirely wrong to make such
suggestions as were made in this case, namely that the police beat
the prisoners until they made confessions, and then, when there is
the chance for the prisoners to substantiate what has been said by
going into the box, for counsel not to call them. The court hopes
that notice will be taken of this, and that counsel will refrain, if
they do not intend to call their clients, from making charges which,
if true, form a defence but which, if there is nothing to support
them, ought not to be pursued.’ 




 We
note with interest that in Archbold’s Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (38th Edn) paragraph 527 the following: 




‘ Rules
Approved by the Bar Council 1960 ... The rules headed ‘cross- examination’ were first published in
November 1950. It is submitted that this may be material in
resolving the apparent conflict between observations of Lord Goddard
CJ in R v O’Neill, R v Ackers (1950) 34 Cr App Rep 108 ... 

 Cross
Examination ... If an accused person instructs his counsel that he is not guilty
of the offence or offences with which he is charged but decides not
to give evidence upon his trial, it is nevertheless the duty of
counsel to put his defence before the court to the extent, if
necessary, of making positive suggestions to witnesses. 

 CROSS-EXAMINATION
WHICH GOES TO A MATTER IN ISSUE 

 (2)
In such cross-examination it is not improper for counsel to put
questions suggesting fraud, misconduct or the commission of any
criminal offence (even though he is not able or does not intend to
exercise the right of calling affirmative evidence to support or
justify the imputation they convey), if he is satisfied that the
matters suggested are part of his client’s case and has no reason
to believe that they are only put forward for the purpose of
impugning the witness’s character.’ 




 The
phrase “the shelter of the dock” used by the trial judge occurred
in James v R (1959) 1 WIR 117 at page 125: 




‘ In
the present case the trial judge did point out to the jury that the
appellant was not bound to give evidence and that it was for the
prosecution to make out the case beyond reasonable doubt. He also
told the jury his reason for making the comment that the appellant
had not given evidence on oath, that is that Ogle and other witnesses
had been accused by the appellant of a conspiracy to frame him and
that this accusation had only been made from the shelter of the
dock.’ 




 327 

 We
note, however, that in the extract from the trial judge’s
summing-up as set out in the judgment no such phrase occurs and such
passages as were quoted therein seem to us impeccable and within the
permissible limits. 

 In
the instant case the attorney for Donaldson in cross-examination
having put questions impliedly casting imputations on the character
of the witnesses for the prosecution, had Donaldson failed to support
them with assertions from the dock then those suggestions having been
denied by the witnesses would be empty and unworthy of any
consideration whatsoever. It has been laid down in a number of cases
including Director of Public Prosecutions v Walker (1974) 21 WIR 406 (and as the jury were directed in this case by the
trial judge) that the jury should give the statement from the dock
such weight as they, the jury, thought it deserved. Had Donaldson
not included these allegations in his statement from the dock there
would be nothing front him to be considered by the jury in relation
to this important issue. 

 The
trial judge in dealing with Donaldson’s failure to testify told the
jury (in effect) that his right to make a statement from the dock did
not extend to include those assertions which (to us) were clearly in
keeping with the questions put in cross-examination. In our view
those assertions were relevant to the particular issue and,
generally, were in keeping with his defence; and telling the jury
that he had no right so to do was a misdirection. 

 It
is not always easy to determine whether or not the comments of a
trial judge are likely to preclude a jury from giving a fair
consideration to all issue. In the first passage quoted front the
summing-up the trial judge may very well have intended the remarks to
be treated as comments; but, by making them a part of his directions
on the right to make a statement from the dock and by telling them
those assertions were outside that right, he clothed them with the
mantle of directions on the law. Comments by a trial judge may be
disregarded by the jury but directions on the law (and as they were
in effect told by the trial judge) must be accepted without
reservations. Whether or not there is merit in the implied criticism
in the Bar Association Rules ( supra )
in relation to the dicta in R v O’Neill, R v Ackers (1950) 34 Cr App Rep 108, as was intimated by this court in R v Hart (1978) 27 WIR 229, the didactic dicta of all appellate tribunal may not always be appropriate in a
summing-up to a jury. 

 Accordingly,
notwithstanding that the summation was in all other respects full,
fair and free from fault, we were of the view that this misdirection
deprived Donaldson of the fair and careful consideration by the jury
of an issue which was vital to the determination of guilt or
innocence. For these reasons we treated Donaldson’s application
for leave to appeal as the hearing of the appeal, we allowed the
appeal but held that the interests of justice would be best served by
ordering a new trial. 

 We
now turn to the ground of appeal argued on behalf of Edwards: 

 328 




‘ Supplementary
ground 1 (filed 7th June 1979) 

 The
trial judge erred in law when he told the jury pursuant to their
request, ‘that there can not be any inspection of the locus in quo after completion of the summing-up’, thus depriving the jury of
vital assistance which they sought to properly assess the defence and
to the prejudice of [Edwards].’ 




 In
support Mr Knight referred to the following passage from that
venerable case, R
v Martin (1872) LR 1 CCR 378: 




‘ The
first objection to the conviction was, that the jury were permitted
to view the urinal after the summing-up of the learned judge. We are
unanimously of opinion that there was no irregularity, and no
impropriety in the learned judge allowing the jury to have that view.
 It must always be discretionary on the part of the judge to allow a
view, and he should grant it with proper caution to the jury not to
receive any communications from the witnesses or otherwise whilst
having the view- per Bovill CJ’ 




 He
submitted that a visit to the locus in quo simpliciter should be distinguished from a visit at which witnesses attended and
gave a demonstration. 

 The
following appears from the record: 




‘ Jury

 Willkie

a pity you didn’t request this before I completed my summation. It
means that we have to get all the witnesses again, to point out these
places. 

 Foreman The following jurors have said they would like to see these things. 

 Willkie
J Well, I will think about it and I will tell you in a few minutes,
while we see whether we can get transportation or not ... 

 Resumption
at 11.00 a m ... 

 Willkie
J Mr Foreman, members of the jury, I took the question on advisement
and I have discussed the matter with the counsel the case for the
Crown and for the [appellants], and they are in agreement with my
view of the law, that there cannot be any inspection of the locus in quo after the completion of the summing-up. So, I am afraid you will
have to retire and come to a verdict on the evidence that is before
you. So will you please retire. Please follow the police officers.’ 




 At
the outset may we say that from the passage quoted from R v Martin (1872) LR 1 CCR 378 it does not follow that a view of the locus in quo by the jury alone after the conclusion of the summing-up is the
desirable practice. R
v Martin was cited in Karamat v R [1956] 1 All ER 415 at page 417, but not for the dicta referred to herein. Whether or not a visit to the locus in quo is merely an aid to assessing or appreciating the evidence or is in
fact evidence in a case depends on what transpires at the locus. 

 In James v R (1959) 1 WIR 424, it was held: 




‘ (i)
on a simple view without witnesses the jury may carry out
demonstrations among themselves with a view to testing the
credibility or accuracy of the testimony of a witness. 

 (ii)
on a visit of a jury to a locus in quo the removal and replacement of an object there at the trial judge’s
direction is not the giving of evidence and the absence of the
accused when those acts are done does not constitute all
irregularity. 

 (iii)
where a simple view without witnesses is had by a jury it is not
necessary for evidence to be given on oath of what the jury did or
were shown at the view.’ 




 In Tameshwar v R (1957) 41 Cr App Rep 161 at page 169 the Privy Council held: 




‘ if
witnesses give demonstrations or answer questions at a view, that 

 330 

 is
undoubtedly part of the trial and must be had before the judge and
jury. These observations do not apply to a simple view without
witnesses. It is rather like their examination of an exhibit or a
plan in the jury room without the judge being present, but the judge
usually sees it himself too.’ 




 However
in the three modern cases referred to above, the question of the view
being taken after the summing-up did not arise. On the other hand in R v Lawrence (1968) 52 Cr App Rep 163 it was held: 




‘ The
strict rule of procedure that no further evidence shall be adduced in
a trial after the jury have retired to consider their verdict extends
to the inspection by the jury of an object such as a motor vehicle
referred to in the evidence during the trial, even though no oral
evidence is given at the time of the inspection; and where there has
been all inspection by the jury in such circumstances, the conviction
will be quashed.’ 




 In
the instant case the request of the foreman of the jury clearly
required the attendance at the locus in quo of the appellants and the prosecution witnesses Sgt Marshall and/or
Henry Brown and would involve demonstrations or the answering of
questions at the view. This would certainly be the tendering of
further evidence after the close of the summing-up. The record
indicates that the trial judge was certainly not unaware of the
problem. In the circumstances he came to the correct decision when
he ruled that there could not be any inspection of the locus in quo at that stage of the proceedings for the purpose stated by the jury. 




‘ Ground
2(i) 

 The
trial judge erred in law in the following instances: (i) In admitting
the evidence by the witness Henry Brown as to the alleged events ‘of
the Thursday before 14th May’ in that the prejudicial effect of
same outweighed the probative value and that the warning of the trial
judge was contradictory and that further, the evidence tended to show
a criminal propensity.’ 




 On
this aspect of the case the trial judge directed the jury as follows: 




‘ Now
you bear in mind, Mr Foreman and members of the jury, that this
evidence is led (if you believe the boy’s evidence) to show that
the two [appellants] intended stealing yams and wire of the deceased.
 This Would be a criminal offence, stealing of the man’s yams or
the stealing of his wire, or the destruction of his wire. Both of
these men are not charged with stealing yams or destroying the wire
or trying to steal the wire, so you have to disregard that piece of
evidence for that purpose. You cannot say, well, these fellows are
thieves and because they are thieves they might very well have
injured this man and have committed this crime. You cannot do that. 
You have persons who call come and steal something and yet will not
hurt somebody. It would be prejudicial, and it would be wrong, and
it would be biased on your 

 331 

 part
to use the fact (if You accept the boy’s evidence that these people
were doing what they did) to use that to say that they must be guilty
of murder, because they did that. The evidence is led by the Crown
merely to show that these two [appellants] knew this man’s place,
Augustus Samuels who is called ‘Gussie’, that they knew his place
and that they knew him, that they also knew what he planted on the
place and what he kept on the place. This is the purpose of the
evidence being put before you. For that limited purpose. There was
no other way that they could put that evidence before you without
revealing what the fellow said that he saw, but the Crown does not
intend (and I am directing you as a matter of law, that you cannot
use the fact, if you accept it) that they were interfering with this
man’s property. You cannot use that to ground your conclusions
that they must be bad men and as a result they are capable of doing
what has been charged to them. So bear that in mind. So that is the
purpose that the evidence has been put forward and that is the only
consideration you should give to that piece of evidence.’ 




 We
were surprised that in the light of directions so manifestly
favourable to the appellants there should be such a ground of appeal.
 It is enough to say we found no merit in this ground. 

 Supplementary
grounds were filed on 27th November 1979 and argued by Mr Frankson: 




‘ 1
(a) That the trial judge erred in allowing hearsay evidence of the
words alleged to have been used by the deceased on the night prior to
the body of the deceased being found by Henry Brown. 

 (b)
The trial judge failed to direct the jury that the words used were
not evidence of the truth of the fact stated herein but merely of the
fact that the statement was made.’ 




 Having
regard to the evidence of Dr Lampart and in particular to the
injuries which he found on external examination of the body of the
deceased and to Sgt Marshall’s observations at the scene (as
described by him) the inference is inescapable that, if the jury
accepted Henry Brown’s evidence as to the words he heard the
deceased crying out that night, they were uttered contemporaneously
with the infliction of the injuries by persons there and were
admissible as part of the res gestae .
 In our view the admissibility of this evidence would seem to rest on
even stronger grounds than that in Ratten v R [1971] 3 All ER 801. In that case the appellant was charged with the
murder of his wife. 




‘ ...
At about 1.15 p m a telephone call was made from the house; the
telephonist at the local exchange who answered it, stated in evidence
at the trial: ‘I plugged into a number at Echuca, 1494 (the
appellant’s number) and ... I opened the speak key and I said to
the person ‘Number please’ and the reply I got was ‘Get me the
police please’. I kept the speak key open as the person was in an
hysterical state and I connected the call to Echuca 41 which is the
police station. 

 332 

 As
I was connecting the call the person gave her address as 59 Mitchell
Street’. The telephonist added that, as she was connecting the
call to the police station, the caller hung up and she (the witness)
then told the police that they were wanted at 59 Mitchell Street. At
about 1.20 p m a police officer telephoned the appellant’s house
from the local police station and spoke to him. By this time the
deceased had been shot. The shooting, from which she had died almost
immediately, had therefore, taken place between 1.12 p m and 1.20 p
m. 

 Held:
(dismissing appeal) (i) The evidence of the telephonist was not
hearsay evidence and was admissible as evidence of fact relevant to
an issue, ie as evidence that, contrary to the appellant’s account,
a call was made only some three to five minutes before the fatal
shooting by a woman who could only have been the deceased; it was
also relevant as possibly showing (if the jury thought fit to draw
the inference) 

 that
the deceased woman was at the time in a state of emotion or fear ...’ 




 In
the instant case the witness Brown recognized the voice of the
deceased and the injuries which caused his death and the damage to
his house were consistent with his outcries. Accordingly, we found
no merit in this ground. 

 For
these reasons we treated the application for leave as the hearing of
the appeal and as set out earlier we affirmed the conviction but
varied the sentence. 

 Donaldson’s
appeal, against conviction allowed; new trial ordered. 

 Edwards’s
sentence varied; his appeal against conviction dismissed.

 COURT
OF APPEAL OF JAMAICA 

 MELVILLE
AND CARBERRY JJA, WHITE ACTING JA 

 21ST
MAY 27TH JUNE 1980 

 Criminal
evidence – Medical certificate or report – Admission on behalf of
defence – Evidence Act [J], section 50(1) 

 Section
50(1) of the Evidence Act which in certain proceedings allows the
admission in evidence of a certificate or report signed by a medical
practitioner and accompanied by a sworn statement by the medical
practitioner applies equally to the admission of such certificates
and reports by the prosecution and the defence. Accordingly, where a
certificate was admitted on behalf of the prosecution although it did
not meet the formal requirements of section 50(1) and a certificate
tendered by the defence was ruled inadmissible the resultant
conviction should be set side and a new trial ordered. 

 No
case was referred to in the judgment. 

 Appeal 

 Appeal Ezra Hall appealed to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica (resident
magistrate’s criminal appeal 47/80) against his conviction on 6th
March 1980 at the resident magistrate’s court, St Elizabeth, for
wounding. The facts arc set out in the judgment of the court
delivered by Melville JA 

 H
G Edwards QC for the appellant 

 G
Belnavis for the Crown 

 Melville
JA delivered the judgment of the court. The appellant was convicted in
the resident magistrate’s court for the parish of St Elizabeth on
6th March 1980 of wounding Keith Richards on 4th December 1979. 

 Briefly,
the Crown alleged that the appellant threw a stone which wounded the
complainant, a police constable, in the head without any lawful
justification; whilst the defence alleged that it was thrown in
circumstances amounting to self-defence. There was evidence to
support either contention. 

 Nothing
more need be said of the facts as the grounds of appeal argued before
us turned on the admissibility of the medical evidence in the case. 
Firstly, it was said that the resident magistrate wrongly admitted in
evidence a certificate tendered by the prosecution purporting to show
the injuries suffered by the complainant, Mr Richards; and, secondly, 

 334 

 that
he failed to receive in evidence a certificate relating to the
injuries suffered by the appellant. 

 Sections
50 and 51 of the Evidence Act provide as follows: 




‘ 50.
 (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law, but subject
always to the provisions of this Part, any certificate or report, if
accompanied by a sworn statement by the medical practitioner who has
signed the certificate or report, shall be admitted in evidence in
any criminal proceedings before a resident magistrate or justices, or
at any coroner’s inquest, without the medical practitioner being
called upon to attend and to give evidence upon oath. 

 (2)
Where, in any criminal proceedings before a resident magistrate or
justices it is intended to put in evidence a certificate or report as
provided in subsection (1), the prosecution shall, at least three
clear days before the proceedings, serve upon the defendant written
notice of such intention, together with a copy of the certificate or
report, and the defendant, at the commencement of the proceedings,
may object to the admission of the certificate or report, and may
require the attendance of the medical practitioner to give evidence
on oath. 

 51.
 Nothing in this Part contained shall be deemed to prejudice or take
away the rights of the defendant, or of the court or coroner, as the
case may be, at any stage of any proceedings to require the medical
practitioner who has signed a certificate or report to attend and
give evidence on oath.’ 




 What
seems to be clear from the above provisions is that those sections
were enacted to save the time of medical practitioners attending
court to give viva voce evidence in criminal proceedings which are not of a serious nature;
subject, of course, to the right of a defendant or the court to
require the attendance of the doctor to give the evidence in court. 
Once it is shown that the certificate or report is accompanied by a sworn statement by the medical practitioner who has signed the certificate or report (and if the proceedings are criminal in
nature and cognisable before a resident magistrate, justices or a
coroner) such certificate or report becomes admissible in evidence. 
That seems to be the plain effect of section 50(1) of the Evidence
Act. On the face of it section 50, although perhaps originally
intended to assist prosecutions, applies not only to the prosecution
but to the defence also. Section 50(1) refers to “ any certificate or report”, so that this court call see no reason why
it should be confined to the Crown alone or why it should not extend
to the defence, contrary to what was argued in the court below (but
conceded by counsel for the Crown before us). 

 Consequently
in answer to the second point raised by the appellant, it is our view
that the resident magistrate was in error when he refused to admit in
evidence the certificate tendered on behalf of the appellant,
provided that it was signed by the doctor and accompanied by a sworn
statement in compliance with section 50(1) of the Evidence Act. We
should add, however, that on an application by the prosecution, the 

 335 

 court
would have had the right to require the appellant’s doctor to
attend court for cross-examination. 

 Where,
however, it is the prosecution that is seeking to tender the
certificate or report before the resident magistrate or justices, not
only must there be a compliance with section 50(1) of the Evidence
Act, but the requirements of section 50(2) have also to be satisfied.
 And, even where the requirements of both subsections of section 50
have been satisfied, it is still open to an accused person to require
the attendance of the medical practitioner to give the evidence on
oath (although it is the experience of this court that it is very
rarely invoked, and one can only hope that this good and sensible
practice which prevails at the Bar will continue). 

 We
have examined the certificate relating to Mr Richards’s injuries
tendered by the prosecution in this case; and it is clear that it was
not signed by the doctor nor was it contained in the doctor’s sworn statement. What purports to be a certificate is headed “an abstract from card
No 32008” and where it is usual for the doctor to subscribe the
oath there appears “ for
Dr Bapuji ”.
 This certificate was neither signed by nor sworn to by the doctor
himself. There was here a failure to comply with the provisions of
section 50(1) of the Evidence Act and, for that reason, the
certificate ought not to have been received in evidence. 

 It
is idle to speculate what the outcome of this case would have been
but for the misreception of the prosecution’s medical evidence on
the one hand and the non-reception of that of the defence on the
other. For the reasons stated, the appeal is allowed, the conviction
and sentence are set aside; but in the interest of justice there
should be a new trial before another resident magistrate for the
parish of St Elizabeth and we so order. 

 Appeal
allowed. New trial ordered.

 Income
tax – Body of persons – Responsibility of manager and principal
officer – Not personally liable for payment of tax – Meaning of
“answerable” – Income Tax Act [J], sections 41(4), 52(2) 

 The
Income Tax Act, section 52(2), provides: “The manager or other
principal officer of every body of persons shall be answerable for
doing all such acts, matters and things as shall be required to be
done by virtue of this Act for the assessment of such body and the
payment of the tax”. 

 On
the true construction of section 52(2) (by reference to the terms of
section 41(4) and in the absence of clear language to the contrary),
the manager or principal officer of a company is not personally
liable for the income tax charged on the company. In section 52(2),
the word “answerable” means “responsible for”.

 Appeal 

 Appeal K P Chatani appealed to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica (civil appeal
4/79) against the decision of the Full Court on 9th January 1979
dismissing his application for an order of mandamus commanding the Commissioner of Income Tax to withdraw a restriction
notice under rule 4, Part II of Schedule 1 to the Income Tax Law
1954, and to issue 

 337 

 a
certificate that Mr Chatani did not owe any income tax. The Court of
Appeal allowed the appeal on 27th July 1979 and reserved its reasons.
 The facts are set out in the judgment of the court delivered by
Zacca JA.

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Zacca
JA delivered the Judgment of the court. On 27th July 1979, we allowed
this appeal and set aside the order of the Full Court. We granted
the appellant an order of mandamus directed to the Commissioner of Income Tax requiring him to issue a
certificate to the appellant to the effect that Mr Chatani does not
owe any income tax. We also ordered costs in the court below and
costs of this appeal to Mr Chatani, to be agreed or taxed. We
promised to put our reasons into writing. This we now do. 

 This
is all appeal from all order of the Full Court of the Supreme Court
dismissing all application of Mr Chatani in which he had applied for
an order of mandamus directed to the respondent, the Commissioner of Income Tax, requiring
him to withdraw a restriction notice dated 21st May 1976 and also to
issue his certificate stating that Mr Chatani did not owe any income
tax. 

 The
facts which are not in dispute are these. In June 1976, the
Commissioner served on Mr Chatani a restriction notice dated 21st May
1976. This notice was stated to be served pursuant to the provisions
of rule 4, Part II of Schedule 1 to the Income Tax Law 1954. This
rule is now rule 2, Part II of Schedule 2 to the Income Tax Act. The
notice was in the following terms: 




‘ Take
notice that pursuant to the provisions of rule 4 in Part 11 of the
First Schedule to the Income Tax Law, Law 59 Of 1954, you are
required not to leave the Island unless at the time of leaving you
have in your possession a certificate issued by the Commissioner of
Income Tax within the preceding ninety days stating that you: (a) do
not owe any income tax; or (b) have made satisfactory arrangements
for the payment of income tax payable by you, and further take notice
that if you fail to comply with the requirements of this notice, you
may be taken into custody by an immigration officer and render
yourself liable to penalties as provided by the said Income Tax Law.’ 




 When
the notice was served on Mr Chatani he owed income tax in the sum Of
$2970.88. This tax was paid by Mr Chatani in September 1978. On the
payment of the tax the Commissioner was asked to withdraw the
restriction notice by issuing his certificate to the effect that Mr
Chatani did not owe any income tax. This the Commissioner refused to
do on the basis that a company, P Kalidas Ltd, owed income tax
amounting to $89,891.37 for the years 1973 to 1976; and the 

 338 

 Commissioner
contended that Mr Chatani, who was the managing director of that
company and the principal share-holder during the relevant period,
was personally responsible for the payment of the tax by virtue of
section 52 of the Income Tax Act. It is a fact that Mr Chatani was
the managing director of P Kalidas Ltd until March 1976. 

 When
the restriction notice was served on Mr Chatani, the company had not
been assessed; and the assessment did not take place until March
1978. An appeal to the Revenue Court was withdrawn on 17th November
1978; and, therefore, it was not challenged that P Kalidas Ltd, owed
income tax amounting to $89,891.37. This tax had not been paid in
September 1978 when Mr Chatani discharged his liability with respect
to his own individual and personal income tax. At the time of the
hearing of the appeal the tax had still not been paid. These then
were the undisputed facts. 

 On
9th January 1979, the Full Court of the Supreme Court heard arguments
with respect to all application by Mr Chatani asking the Full Court
to order mandamus directed to the Commissioner requiring him to withdraw the
restriction notice and to issue his certificate stating that Mr
Chatani did not owe any income tax. The Full Court dismissed the
application and, in making its order, gave the following reasons
(prepared by the instructing attorney for Mr Chatani and approved by
the presiding judge of the Full Court): (i) comparisons with the
other sections of the Income Tax Act are irrelevant; (ii)
“answerable” means “liable” (ie different from being obliged
merely to co-operate with the Commissioner of Income Tax); (iii)
section 52(2) is quite clear and unequivocal and means that the
manager or the principal officer is answerable or liable or
responsible for doing all such acts, matters and things as shall be
required to be done by virtue of the Act for the assessment of the
body and the payment of the tax; (iv) in the circumstances of this
case, Mr Chatani is liable for payment of the tax and, consequently,
the restriction notice was properly served; (v) application
dismissed; and (vi) costs to the Commissioner. 

 It
is from this order that Mr Chatani now appeals to this court. At the
hearing of the appeal, it was contended by the attorneys for Mr
Chatani that the contention of the Commissioner and the finding of
the Full Court that section 52(2) created a personal liability in Mr
Chatani for the payment of income tax owed by P Kalidas Ltd, was
erroneous. 

 It
was submitted that section 52(2) did no more than to create a
responsibility for the seeing to the payment of the tax owed by the
company. That it is the company which was assessable and chargeable;
and that the Commissioner could only look to the company for the
payment of the tax, either by resorting to the courts or distraining
on the company if the taxes were not paid by the company. It was
also submitted that a statute required clear and unambiguous words to
create a tax liability on an individual; and it was not the intention
of the legislature to do so in section 52(2). The Full Court was in
error in holding that comparisons with other sections of the Income
Tax Act were irrelevant. 

 339 

 The
Commissioner on the other hand contended that the order of the Full
Court was correct and that section 52(2) created a personal liability
in Mr Chatani for the payment of the tax owed by the company as he
was the managing director at the relevant period. That the word
“answerable” in section 52(2) meant “liable” and/or
“responsible”. It was also submitted that the words “for doing
all such acts, matters and things as shall be required to be done by
virtue of this Act” in section 52(2), only qualified the words “for
the assessment of such body” and did not qualify the words “the
payment of the tax”. 

 These
contentions pose the question of the true construction of section
52(2) of the Income Tax Act. Section 52 states: 




‘ (1)
Every body of persons shall be chargeable to tax in like manner as
any person is chargeable under the provision of this Act. 

 (2)
The manager or other principal officer of every body of persons shall
be answerable for doing all such acts, matters and things as shall be
required to be done by virtue of this Act for the assessment of such
body and the payment of the tax’. 




 In
construing section 52(2) we are not assisted by reference to any
previous cases dealing with the interpretation of these provisions. 
It is necessary to look at the Act as a whole, making comparison with
other sections to determine the proper interpretation. The Full
Court was in error in holding that comparisons with other sections of
the Income Tax Act were irrelevant in the interpretation of the
section. 

 It
may also be necessary to look at the relevant sections in the Taxes
Management Act 1970 [UK] dealing with similar provisions. It may
also be useful to recall some of the rules of interpretation to be
applied which were quoted by Lord Donovan in his opinion in Mangin v Inland Revenue Commissioner [1971] AC 739 at page 746. These are: 




‘ First,
the words are to be given their ordinary meaning ... 

 Secondly,
‘ ... one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no
room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is
no presumption as to tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be
implied. One call only look fairly at the language used.’ per Rowlatt J in Cape Brandy Syndicate v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1921] 1 KB 64 at page 71, approved by Viscount Simon LC in Canadian Eagle Oil Co Ltd v R [1946] AC 119 at page 140. 

 Thirdly,
the object of the construction of a statute being to ascertain the
will of the legislature it may be presumed that neither injustice nor
absurdity was intended.’ 




 Section
52(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act is similar to the provisions of
section 71(1) and (2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 [UK]. 
However, whilst the United Kingdom Act provides for a further
subsection (3), this is omitted from the Jamaican Act. Section 71(3)
Of the Taxes Management Act 1970 [UK] provides: 

 340 




‘ Every
such officer as aforesaid may from time to time retain, out of any
money coming into his hands on behalf of the body, so much thereof as
is sufficient to pay the income tax charged upon the body, and shall
be indemnified for all such payments made in pursuance of the Income
Tax Act.’ 




 It
is to be observed that section 56 of the Income Tax Act [J] provides: 




‘ Every
person answerable under this Act in a representative capacity for the
payment of income tax may retain out of any money coming to his hands
in such capacity so much thereof as shall be sufficient to pay such
income tax; and every such person shall be and is hereby indemnified
against every person whatsoever for all payments made by him in
pursuance and by virtue of this Act’. 




 It
is necessary to consider whether “every person . . . in a
representative capacity” (mentioned in section 56) is wide enough
to include the persons mentioned in section 52(2) and whether section
56 would, therefore, be a provision in the Act similar to section
71(3) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 [UK]. It is our view that the
manager or other principal officer of a company could avail himself
of the provisions in section 56 of the Income Tax Act. 

 It
is section 5 of the Income Tax Act which imposes the payment of
income tax by the individual in respect of his income, profits or
gain. If, therefore, the Act seeks to impose on others liability to
pay such tax, then it must be so clearly stated. It will be seen
from other sections of the Income Tax Act that provisions are made
for the payment of income tax by persons who would not normally be
liable for such payment under section 5 of the Act. These sections
state quite clearly who are responsible for the payment of such tax. 

 Let
us now examine some sections of the Income Tax Act which clearly make
certain persons personally liable for income tax. Section 41(4)
makes directors of a company liable for the payment of tax deducted
at source by a company. Section 41(4) states: 




‘ Where
a person who fails to pay or account for any tax by the date required
by subsection (1) is a body corporate by which the tax was in fact
deducted, the persons who on that date were the directors of the body
corporate shall be jointly and severally liable, together with the
body corporate, to pay or account for the tax, increased as provided
by subsection (2)’. 




 Under
section 49(1) the income of a married woman is deemed to be the
income of the husband and such income shall be assessed and charged
to tax in the name of the husband. Section 49(1) states: 




‘ Subject
to section 50 the income of a married woman living with her husband
shall be deemed to be the income of the husband and shall be assessed
and charged to tax in the name of the husband’. 




 341 

 Section
54(1) and (2) provides for non-resident persons to be assessed and
charged in the name of their representatives. Section 54(1) and (2)
states: 




‘ (1)
A person not resident in this Island, whether a Commonwealth citizen
or not, shall be assessable and chargeable in the name of his
trustee, guardian or committee, or of any attorney, agent, receiver,
branch or manager, whether such attorney, agent, receiver, branch or
manager has the receipt of the profits or gains or not, in like
manner and to the like amount as such non-resident person would be
assessed and charged if he were resident in this Island and in the
actual receipt of such profits or gains. 

‘ (2)
A non-resident person shall be assessable and chargeable in respect
of any profits or gains arising, whether directly or indirectly,
through or from any attorneyship, agency, receivership, branch or
management, and shall be so assessable and chargeable in the name of
the attorney, agent, receiver, branch or manager.’ 




 Section
55(1) provides for the income of incapacitated or non-resident
persons to be chargeable to certain categories of persons and for
such persons to be answerable for the payment of income tax
chargeable to such persons. Section 55(1) states: 




‘ Every
trustee, guardian, committee, receiver, attorney, agent, or other
representative shall be chargeable to income tax in like manner and
to the like amount and shall be answerable for the doing of all such
acts, matters or things as are required to be done by virtue of this
Act for the assessment of any person for whom he acts and for the
payment of income tax chargeable on him in respect of the income of
any incapacitated or non-resident person.’ 




 It
is to be noted that the categories of persons mentioned in section
55(1) are chargeable to income tax in like manner as incapacitated or
non- resident persons and are made answerable for the payment of such
tax whilst, in section 52(1), it is the company which is chargeable
to income tax. An officer of the company is not made chargeable for
tax for which the company is liable. 

 Section
57( b )
also creates a personal liability for the payment of income tax. 
Section 57 states: 




‘ With
respect to every person resident in the Island having the receipt,
control and disposal of money belonging to a non-resident person who
derives income from a source in the Island, or to a non-resident
person who is a share-holder, debenture-holder, or depositor in a
company deriving income from a source in the Island, the following
provisions shall apply – ( a )
he shall, when required by the Commissioner, pay the tax due and
payable by the non-resident; ( b )
he is hereby made personally liable for the tax payable by him on
behalf of the non-resident to the extent of any amount that he has 

 342 

 retained
or should have retained under section 56, but he shall not be
otherwise personally liable for the tax.’ 




 The
provisions of section 71(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 [UK] are
subject to section 108 of the same Act. We have no section similar
to section 108 in our Act; and section 52(2) is not subject to any
other section in the Act. Section 108(2) of the Taxes Management Act
1970 [UK] states: 




‘ Corporation
tax or other tax chargeable under the Corporation Tax Acts on a
company which is not a body corporate, or which is a body corporate
not incorporated under the Companies Act 1948 or any other enactment
forming part of the law of the United Kingdom, or by charter, may, at
any time after the tax becomes due, and without prejudice to any
other method of recovery, be recovered from the proper officer of the
company, and that officer may retain out of any money coming into his
hands on behalf of the company sufficient sums to pay that tax, and,
so far as he is not so re-imbursed, shall be entitled to be
indemnified by the company in respect of the liability so imposed on
him’. 




 It
is to be observed that this section states quite clearly that the tax
may be recovered from the proper officer of a company which is not a
body corporate or, if a body corporate, one which is not incorporated
under the Companies Act 1948. Section 108 provides for recovery of
tax payable by the company from the proper officer of the company,
whilst section 72 provides for certain officers of the company to be
answerable for the doing of such acts as are required to be done for
the assessment of the company and for payment of the tax. Is a
distinction drawn in section 108 with respect to the recovery of tax
owed by a company? 

 In
consideration of whether any personal liability has been created in
respect of the payment of income tax of a company by the officers of
the company mentioned in section 52(2), it may also be useful to
examine sections of the Act providing for the collection of income
tax. Section 77(1) states: 




‘ The
Commissioner shall from time to time forward to the Collector-
General for collection of income tax, extracts from the assessment
lists containing the names and addresses of every person assessed in
respect of income together with the amount of income tax payable by
each such person.’ 




 It
therefore follows that only the names of persons, who are chargeable
and assessable, will appear on such a list, enabling the
Collector-General to proceed to the collection of the tax owed. Such
a list could not contain the name of an officer of a company as
mentioned in section 52(2) because he is neither chargeable nor
assessable. 

 It
could, however, contain the names of the categories of persons
mentioned in sections 49, 54, 55 and 57 as these persons are
chargeable 

 343 

 and
assessable, although not in respect of their own income. These
persons could, if they wish, also object, or appeal, to the
assessment made by the Commissioner of Income Tax. No such right of
appeal would exist in the officers of the company who are not
assessed in their own name. The Collector-General could, however,
move to collect any tax owed by a company whose name would be on the
list. 

 What
meaning should be attributable to the word “answerable” in
section 52(2) of the Income Tax Act? In River Wear Commissioners v Adamson (1877) 2 App Cas 743 the word was held to mean “liable”. In Littlewood v George Wimpey&amp;Co Ltd and British Overseas Airways
Corporation [1953] 2 All ER 915, the word “liable” was held to mean
“responsible”. These words were of course interpreted in the
light of the particular Acts being considered. In our view the word
“answerable” in section 52(2) should be given the meaning
“responsible”, because the Act places certain responsibilities on
the manager or other principal officer of the company. Does this
mean, however, that he is responsible to pay income tax owed by the
company out of his own pocket? Is he personally liable to pay such
tax out of his own pocket? 

 The
contention of the Commissioner that the words “the payment of the
tax” are not qualified by the words “for doing all such acts,
matters and things as shall be required to be done by virtue of this
Act”, cannot be accepted. These words must qualify not only the
words “for the assessment of such body” but also the words “the
payment of tax”. A correct reading of the section would be “the
manager or other principal officer of every body of persons shall be
answerable for doing such acts, matters and things as shall be
required to be done by virtue of this Act for the payment of the
tax”. 

 Having
compared section 52 with the other sections of the Income Tax Act and
looking at the Act as a whole it cannot be said that section 52(2)
makes it clear (nor can it be implied) that the manager or other
principal officer of a company is personally liable for the payment
of income tax owed by his company. In our view the section creates
no such personal liability for the payment of income tax and the
Commissioner of Income Tax must look to the assets of the company for
the collection of such tax. If this were not so the whole concept of
company law would be shattered and would create new liabilities for
which directors and other officers of a company have never been
liable. There could be a situation where the manager or other
principal officer of a company is not a principal share-holder, or
even a share-holder at all. Could it be intended that such an
officer of the company should be held personally liable for the
payment of income tax owed by the company? If the legislature wishes
to create a personal liability in officers of a company for the
payment of tax owed by a company, then it must do so in precise and
clear language. This it has not done in section 52(2) of the Income
Tax Act. 

 A
notice under rule 2 of the Income Tax Rules in Part II of the Second
Schedule to the Income Tax Act is only applicable to a person who
owes 

 344 

 income
tax. It is a valid notice if it is served on a person who is
personally liable for the payment of income tax owed by him. The
notice served on Mr Chatani was therefore a valid notice as he owed
income tax in June 1976. This tax was paid in full in September
1978. The assessment on the company was not made until March 1978. 
It is clear, therefore, that when the notice was served on Mr Chatani
it was in respect of the income tax for which he was personally
assessed and which was owed by him. Since Mr Chatani is not
personally liable for the payment of income tax owed by the company
and has paid in full the income tax owed by himself, the Commissioner
was obliged to issue his certificate to the effect that Mr Chatani
did not owe any income tax. 

 Appeal
allowed. 

 Appeal 

 Appeal The Commissioner of Income Tax appealed to the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council (appeal 2 of 1981) from the decision of the Court
of Appeal. 

 Stewart
Bates QC, Robin Mathew and H Hamilton (instructed by Charles Russell&amp;Co )
for the Commissioner of Income Tax 

 Stephen
Oliver QC and Mrs A Hudson-Phillips (instructed by Speechly Bircham) for the taxpayer 

 The
Board reserved its reasons. 

 Lord
Keith of Kinkel delivered the advice of the Board. This appeal, from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of Jamaica dated 27th July 1979, raises questions
as to the proper construction of certain provisions of the Income Tax
Act. Rule 2 of Schedule 2, Part II to that Act provides: 

 (1)
If the Commissioner thinks fit he may serve on any person a notice
requiring that he shall not leave the Island unless at the time of
leaving he has in his possession a certificate issued by or on behalf
of the Commissioner within the preceding ninety days stating that he
– ( a )
does not owe any income tax, or ( b )
has made satisfactory arrangements for the payment of income tax
payable by him. 

 (2)
On the application of any person on whom a notice under paragraph (1)
has been served, the Commissioner shall issue to him within thirty
days after the date of the application, a notice of assessment in
respect of all income tax that will be due by him at the date of his
intended departure from the Island. 

 (3)
Where a notice has been served on a person under paragraph (1), and
it has not been withdrawn by a further notice served on him by the
Commissioner, that person shall, if he leaves the Island in
contravention of the notice, be guilty of an offence and liable on 

 345 

 summary
conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty dollars or to a term of
imprisonment not exceeding three months, or to both. 

 (4)
A person who leaves or attempts to leave the Island in contravention
of these Rules may be taken into custody without warrant by an
immigration officer for a period not exceeding twelve hours.’ 

 In
June 1976 the Commissioner of Income Tax served on Mr Chatani a
notice dated 21st May 1976 issued under this rule. At that time Mr
Chatani owed certain sums in personal income tax. In September 1978
his liability in that respect for a number of years of assessment up
to and including 1977 was agreed at $2970.88. Mr Chatani paid this
sum and obtained from the Commissioner a receipt for it dated 3rd
October 1978. He then asked for the restriction notice served on him
to be withdrawn. The Commissioner refused to do so on the ground
that a company called P Kalidas Ltd, of which Mr Chatani had been
managing director until March 1978, had an undischarged liability for
income tax in respect of the years of assessment 1973 to 1976
amounting to $89,891.37. The Commissioner relied as warranting his
refusal on section 52 of the Income Tax Act, which provides: 




‘ (1)
Every body of persons shall be chargeable to tax in like manner as
any person is chargeable under the provision of this Act. 

 (2)
The manager or other principal officer of every body of persons shall
be answerable for doing all such acts, matters and things as shall be
required to be done by virtue of this Act for the assessment of such
body and the payment of the tax.’ 




 It
was the Commissioner’s contention that the effect of this section
was that Mr Chatani, having been managing director of the company
during the material period, was personally liable for payment of the
income tax to which the company had been assessed, and that he
accordingly “owed” that tax within the meaning of rule 2(1)( a )
of Schedule 2, Part II. 

 Mr
Chatani sought leave to apply to the Supreme Court for an order of mandamus directed to the Commissioner requiring him to withdraw the
restriction notice dated 21st May 1976 and to issue a certificate
stating that Mr Chatani does not owe any income tax. Leave was duly
granted but, on 9th January 1979, the Full Court dismissed the
application. By the judgment now appealed from the Court of Appeal
(Zacca, Henry and Rowe JJA) reversed the decision of the Full Court
and granted the relief sought by Mr Chatani 

 The
only issue in the appeal is whether, as contended by the
Commissioner, section 52(2) of the Income Tax Act upon its true
construction renders Mr Chatani personally liable for the income tax
charged upon the company of which he was managing director. In their
Lordships’ opinion it clearly does not. In the first place, as the
Court of Appeal held, there can be no doubt that the words “the
payment of tax” 

 346 

 are
to be linked, not with the words “answerable for” but with the
words “doing all such acts, matters and things as shall be required
to be done by virtue of this Act for ...”. In that situation the
plain intention is that the manager or other principal officer of a
company or other body is to be responsible (which is what
“answerable” must mean in this context) for taking all
administrative or ministerial action which the Act requires to be
taken for the assessment of the body and the payment of tax to which
it is chargeable. It is the body itself which is made chargeable to
and liable for tax. Their Lordships can find no indication of an
intention that the manager or other principal officer of the body is
to be liable jointly and severally with the body for payment of the
latter’s tax, which is the result which would follow if the
Commissioner’s contention were correct. It is to be observed that
section 41 of the Act, which deals with payment over to the Revenue
of tax deducted at source, provides (by section 41(4)) that, where a
body corporate has deducted tax and failed to pay it over by the due
date, the directors of the body at that date are jointly and
severally liable with it to pay or account for the tax. This
provision is subject to a proviso relieving from liability a director
who proves, inter alia, that there was no negligence on his part. It
thus appears that where in the Act the legislature intended to make
officers of a body corporate jointly and severally liable with it to
pay tax for which the body was accountable, it expressed that
intention explicitly and in clear language. If a similar intention
had existed as regards the content of section 52(2), one would have
expected it to be clearly expressed there also. 

 Their
Lordships have not found it necessary to refer to certain other
provisions of the Act upon which the Court of Appeal relied as
supporting their construction of section 52(2), If any such support
be required, section 41(4) provides all that is needed. 

 It
follows that Mr Chatani does not owe any income tax by reason that P
Kalidas Ltd is subject to an undischarged tax liability, and that the
Court of Appeal rightly granted the relief sought by Mr Chatani. 
Their Lordships will humbly advise Her Majesty that the appeal should
be dismissed with costs. 

 Advice
that appeal should be dismissed.

 The

his will from one place to another is not “property” which is
protected by the “due process of law” provisions of the
Constitution (section 1( a )
of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago 1962).

 The
holder of a public office who does not avail himself of a remedy
provided by legislation when he was aggrieved by an order for his
transfer from one post to another cannot obtain redress under the
Constitution on the ground of entitlement to the protection of the
law (section 1( b )
of the 1962 Constitution). 

 Per

 Appeal 

 Appeal Kemrajh Harrikissoon appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council (appeal 40 for 1977) from the dismissal by the Court of
Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago of his appeal for redress of a
contravention of his constitutional rights. The facts are set out in
the judgment of the Board delivered by Lord Diplock. 

 F
Ramsahoye SC and T Briden (of the English Bar) for the appellant 

 S
McKinnon and I Blackman for the Attorney-General 

 The
Board reserved its reasons. 

 Lord
Diplock delivered the opinion of the Board. These proceedings in which the
appellant claims a declaration that human rights guaranteed to him by
section 1 of the 1962 Constitution had been contravened and seeks
redress from the High Court under section 6, are, in their Lordships’
view, wholly misconceived. 

 His
complaint was that, at a time when, as a member of the Teaching
Service, he was serving in the post of a class I teacher at Penal
government primary school, he had been unlawfully transferred by the
Teaching Service Commission to a similar post at Palo Seco government
primary school. 

 The
notion that whenever there is a failure by an organ of government or
a public authority or public officer to comply with the law this
necessarily entails the contravention of some human right or
fundamental freedom guaranteed to individuals by Chapter 1 of the
Constitution is fallacious. The right to apply to the High Court
under section 6 of the Constitution for redress when any human right
or fundamental freedom is or is likely to be contravened, is an
important safeguard of those rights and freedoms; but its value will
be diminished if it is allowed to be misused as a general substitute
for the normal procedures for invoking judicial control of
administrative action. In an originating application to the High
Court under section 6(1), the mere allegation that a human right or
fundamental freedom of the applicant has been or is likely to be
contravened is not of itself sufficient to entitle the applicant to
invoke the jurisdiction of the court under the subsection if it is
apparent that the allegation is frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of
the process of the court as being made solely for the purpose of
avoiding the necessity of applying in the normal way for the
appropriate judicial remedy for unlawful administrative action which
involves no contravention of any human right or fundamental freedom. 

 The
instant case concerns, and concerns only, the right of a holder of a
public office not to be transferred against his will from one place
to another. In their Lordships’ view it is manifest that this is
not included among the human rights and fundamental freedoms
specified in Chapter 1 of the Constitution. 

 349 

 The
suggestion made on behalf of the appellant that it constitutes
“property” within the meaning of section 1( a ),
viz: 




‘ the
right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and
enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof
except by due process of law’ 




 needs
only to be stated to be rejected. 

 The
only support relied on for this suggestion was a passing phrase to be
found in the judgment of Crane JA in a case in the Guyana Court of
Appeal, Re
Sarran’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 361 at page 366; but the judge was there referring not
to the expression “property” as used in the Constitution of
Guyana, but to what he understood to be the effect of a particular
passage in a textbook dealing with the subject of domestic tribunals
in which the word “property” appeared. It has no relevance to
the meaning of the word “property” in the Constitution of
Trinidad and Tobago. 

 The
only alternative suggestion was that the transfer of the appellant
fom one school to another contravened his right under section 1( b ),
viz “the right of the individual to equality before the law and the
protection of the law”. This too is manifestly untenable. What
the appellant was entitled to under this paragraph was the right to
apply to a court of justice for such remedy (if any) as the law of
Trinidad and Tobago gives to him against being transferred from one
post to another against his will. There is nothing in the material
before the High Court to give any colour to the suggestion that he
was deprived of the remedy which the law gave him. On the contrary,
he deliberately chose not to avail himself of it. 

 He
had been appointed to the post at Palo Seco primary school by the
Teaching Service Commission in the exercise of their functions under
section 99C(1) of the Constitution. This section was added to the
Constitution by the Trinidad and Tobago Constitution (Amendment) Act
1968. It is in the following terms: 




‘ Subject
to the provisions of this Constitution, power to appoint persons to
hold or act in public offices in the Teaching Service (including
power to make appointments on promotion and transfer and to confirm
appointments) and to remove and exercise disciplinary control over
persons holding or acting in such offices shall vest in the Teaching
Service Commission ...’ 




 Prior
to this amendment, the corresponding functions in relation to members
of the Teaching Service were exercised by the Public Service
Commission. 

 The
transfer of the appellant from one school to the other was thus on
the face of it an administrative act performed by the Teaching
Service Commission in the exercise of functions vested in them by
section 99C. The procedure for transfer is dealt with under
regulations made by the Teaching Service Commission under section
102(1) of the Constitution (as amended by the Act of 1968). 

 350 

 By
notice which appeared in the Trinidad and Tobago Gazette on 6th February 1968, the Teaching Service Commission adopted as
their own the Public Service Commission Regulations 1966, with the
substitution of the words “Teaching Service Commission” for the
words “Public Service Commission” wherever they occurred. 
(Unfortunately, in the instant case, this notice was not drawn to the
attention of the Court of Appeal who gave their judgments on the
erroneous assumption that, since the passing of the Amendment Act of
1968, there had been no regulations in existence dealing with the
procedure for transfer of members of the Teaching Service.) 

 The
relevant regulations applicable to the transfer of the appellant are
as follows: 




‘ 134.
 Every application for an appointment on transfer in the Teaching
Service shall be addressed to the director through the permanent
secretary on the prescribed form ... 

 135.
 (1) Where the commission proposes to transfer a teacher ... the
commission shall, except where the exigencies of the Teaching Service
do not permit, make an order of transfer in writing and shall give
not less than three months’ notice to the teacher who is to be
transferred. 

 (2)
Where a teacher has applied for a transfer to a particular public
school and the commission proposes to transfer the teacher, but not
to the particular school, the commission shall, except where the
exigencies of the Teaching Service do not permit, make an order of
transfer in writing and shall give not less than three months’
notice to such teacher. 

 (3)
A teacher who is aggrieved by an order made under paragraph (1) or
(2) may make representation to the commission for a review of the
order in accordance with paragraph (4). 

 (4)
Where a teacher desires to make representation to the commission for
a review of an order made under paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), such
teacher, within fourteen days of the receipt of the order, shall give
notice in writing to the permanent secretary ... and shall submit
with the notice his representations in writing. 

 (5)
The permanent secretary shall, within seven days of the receipt of
any representation made to him in writing under paragraph (4),
forward such representation together with his comments ... thereon to
the commission. 

 (6)
The commission shall consider the representations of the teacher and
the permanent secretary ... submitted to it under paragraphs (4) and
(5) and shall record its decision in writing. 

 136.
 Notwithstanding that a teacher in respect of whom an order has been
made under paragraph (1) or (2) of regulation 29 has made
representation under paragraphs (5) and (6) of the said regulation
the teacher shall assume his duties on transfer pending the review of
the order by the commission’. 




 351 

 These
regulations define the legal rights enjoyed by the appellant in
relation to his transfer from one post to another in the Teaching
Service. It is in the exercise of these rights that he is entitled
to the protection of the law. 

 The
facts in relation to his transfer on which the appellant’s claim
was based can be stated briefly. On 28th January 1975 the appellant,
who was then on the staff of Penal government primary school, was
informed by b the Teaching Service Commission that he had been
allotted for duty to Palo Seco government primary school with effect
from the date of his assumption of duty there; no specific date for
this was given. He took no steps under regulation 135 (3) and (4) to
obtain a review of this order by the commission. On 25th February
1975 he attended for duty at the Penal government primary school and
was told by the principal that he was to discontinue performing his
duties there. On the following day, his solicitor wrote a letter of
protest to the commission. The letter claimed that the transfer was
contrary to the Public Service Commission Regulations 1966, but gave
no reason why this should be so. It requested that the appellant
should be allowed to continue his duties at Penal government primary
school. On 27th March 1975 the appellant received a letter from the
Teaching Service Commission in the following terms: 




‘ I
wish to inform you that the Teaching Service Commission has decided
that you should be, and you are hereby transferred to the Palo Seco
government primary school, in the exigencies of the service. 

 2.
 You should report to the principal, Palo Seco government primary
school for duty on 14th April 1975, the date on which schools are due
to re-open after the Easter vacation. 

 3.
 Kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter on the duplicate attached
and return the signed copy to the person delivering this letter to
you.’ 




 Again,
the appellant made no representations under regulation 135(3) and (4)
to obtain a review of this order. Instead, on 6th May 1975, he chose
to go straight to the High Court purportedly under section 6 of the
Constitution. 

 For
reasons already stated, the adoption of this procedure, instead of
pursuing the remedy given by the regulations to a teacher aggrieved
by an order of transfer, was, in their Lordships’ view,
misconceived. 

 The
grounds on which the appellant claimed that the transfer was unlawful
were diclosed, for the first time, in the affidavit which he swore in
the proceedings in the High Court. They consisted of (1) an
allegation that the transfer was intended as a punishment for his
having made in July 1973 allegations of improprieties at the Penal
government primary school; and (2) an allegation that the exigencies
of the service did not justify his being transferred on less than
three months’ notice. 

 If
he objected to the transfer on these or other grounds such as
personal inconvenience (on which he also relied), the protection that
the law 

 352 

 afforded
him was, in the first instance, to give notice to the permanent
secretary of his desire to make representations to the commission for
a review of the order and to submit his representations in writing to
the permanent secretary for transmission to the commission, together
with the permanent secretary’s own comments thereon. Then, and not
before then, it would become the duty of the commission to consider
any representations against the order that the appellant wished to
make, together with the permanent secretary’s comments on them. 
Having failed to avail himself of this remedy (apparently
deliberately, for he was acting on legal advice) his claim that the
order for his transfer was unlawful, in their Lordships’ view,
fails in limine . 

 Strictly
speaking this makes it unnecessary for their Lordships to decide
whether, if the appellant had followed the procedure laid down in the
regulations, and the commission (after considering his
representations and those of the permanent secretary) had adhered to
their decision to order him to be transferred to Palo Seco government
primary school, the High Court would have had any jurisdiction to
quash the commission’s order, not, as their Lordships have’
indicated, under section 6 of the Constitution, but upon an
application for certiorari .
 Those hypothetical circumstances correspond more closely with those
which the Court of Appeal assumed to exist since they were unaware
that there were regulations applicable to the appellant which gave
him a right to seek a review by the commission of the order of
transfer. 

 One
of the grounds on which both the High Court and the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appellant’s claim was because they regarded
themselves as precluded from adjudicating upon it by section 102(4)
of the Constitution which provides: 




‘ The
question whether ( a )
Commission to which this section applies has validly performed any
function vested in it by or under this Constitution; ... shall not be
enquired into in any court.’ 




 The
ouster of the court’s jurisdiction effected by this section is in
terms absolute. In their Lordships’ view it is clearly wide enough
to deprive all courts of jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to the
validity of an order of transfer on either of the grounds alleged by
the appellant in the instant case; and that is sufficient to support
the dismissal of the appellant’s claim on this ground also. 

 In
all the judgments below, however, there is considerable discussion of
recent English cases dealing with “ouster of jurisdiction clauses”
contained in Acts of Parliament. Section 102(4) does not form part
of an Act of Parliament; it is part of the Constitution itself. 
Their Lordships do not think that the instant appeal provides an
appropriate occasion for considering whether section 102(4) of the
Constitution, despite its unqualified language, is nevertheless
subject to the same limited kind of implicit exception as was held by
the House of Lords in Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 1 All ER 208 to apply to an ouster of jurisdiction clause in
very similar terms contained in an Act 

 353 

 of
Parliament. This question is best left to be decided in some future
case if one should arise, in which the facts provide a concrete
example of the kind of circumstances that were discussed in the
judgments in the Anisminic case. The facts in the instant appeal do not. 

 The
appeal is dismissed with costs.

 (Kelsick

State might be bound by an enactment (formerly enshrined in the
Interpretation Ordinance, section 37) has been preserved by the
Interpretation Act 1965 (despite the omission of any reference to
necessary implication from section 7) in relation to subsequent
enactments and applies to the Police Service Act 1965 so that the
provisions of the latter bind the State. 

 (Phillips
JA dissenting) A police officer is dismissible at pleasure because
( per Sir Isaac Hyatali CJ) the statutory right to dismiss a police officer
in consequence of disciplinary proceedings (Police Service Act 1965,
section 61( a ))
has not affected the implied term as to dismissibility at pleasure in
his contract of service with the State, or ( per Kelsick JA) it is a fundamental rule of the common law that a public
servant is dismissible at pleasure and this rule has not been
abrogated by the Act of 1965 and was impliedly entrenched in section
99 of the 1962 Constitution.

constitute a domestic code for police officers and are not criminal
offences or offences against public law; accordingly, the
promulgation of the 1966 Regulations was not an unconstitutional
attempt to create criminal offences.

 Appeal 

 Appeal The Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and
Tobago (civil appeal 68 of 1976) against the decision of Braithwaite
J on 17th December 1976 on preliminary points raised in the defence
of the Attorney-General to a claim by Endell Thomas (the respondent)
arising out of his dismissal from the Police Service. The facts are
set out in the judgment of Kelsick JA. 

 T
Hosein QC and Ivol Blackman for the Attorney-General 

 M
G Daly for the respondent 

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Sir
Isaac Hyatali CJ. The question whether the respondent Endell Thomas, a former police
officer of the First Division in the Police Service, was dismissible
at the pleasure of the Crown, is a crucial one in this appeal. If he
was, then nothing further falls to be considered; but 

 358 

 if
he was not, the other two questions become highly relevant. All
three questions however, raise extremely important constitutional
issues and I should like at the outset to acknowledge that the court
was greatly assisted by the comprehensive and skilful submissions of
Mr Hosein for the Attorney-General, on the one hand, and the lucid
and able arguments of Mr Daly for the respondent, on the other. 

 Having
had the invaluable advantage of reading beforehand the judgments
delivered by Kelsick and Phillips JJA, respectively, I feel obliged
to express my admiration of the expansive and searching analysis they
have each made of the relevant legislation, authorities and
principles bearing upon the issues in this appeal. It is regrettable
that we have not been able to reach an unanimous decision on them,
especially as they affect the status and fortunes of a highly
disciplined body of officers, of whom much is expected, and on whom
so much more depends, by reason of the vast powers and
responsibilities reposed in them to preserve the peace, to enforce
the criminal law, to repress internal disturbances, and to safeguard
internal security. 

 By
section 37 of the Interpretation Ordinance (“the Ordinance”) it
was provided that: 




‘ No
law shall in any manner whatsoever affect the rights of the Crown
unless it is therein expressly provided or unless it appears by
necessary implication that the Crown is bound thereby.’ 




 In
addition to what might be conveniently described as “dictionary
provisions” in section 2 of the Ordinance, a number of general
rules were prescribed in the remaining thirty-five sections for the
construction of enactments. Almost all of them, however, were
restrained or guarded by the repetition in each section of the
expression, “unless the contrary intention appears”, and like
phrases. 

 The
Ordinance was repealed by the Interpretation Act 1962 (“the 1962
Act”) which, like its predecessor, contained general rules for the
construction of enactments, in addition to “dictionary provisions”.
 Sections 3 and 7 provided as follows: 




‘ 3.
 (1) Every provision of this Act extends and applies to every
enactment passed or made before or after the commencement of this
Act, unless a contrary intention appears in this Act or the
enactment. 

 (2)
The provisions of this Act apply to this Act as they apply to an
enactment passed after the commencement of this Act. 

 7.
 No enactment passed or made after the commencement of this Act binds
or affects ... Her Majesty or Her Majesty’s rights or prerogatives
unless it is expressly stated therein that Her Majesty is bound
thereby.’ 




 I
pause here to observe that the expression “unless a contrary
intention appears” recurred throughout and burdened the Ordinance. 
The tedious repetition of that expression, however, is avoided in the
1962 Act by the employment of the formula contained in section 3(1)
and the provisions 

 359 

 of
section 3(2), which made that formula applicable to the 1962 Act and
enactments passed thereafter. Consequently, the necessity for
qualifying each section of the 1962 Act with the expression “unless
a contrary intention appears” was eliminated. The substance of the
scheme devised by the draftsman therefore was, firstly, to apply the
formula contained in section 3(1) to the whole of the 1962 Act; and,
secondly, to make every section of the 1962 Act applicable to all
statutes passed thereafter, unless a contrary intention appeared. In
my judgment, at least two irrefutable results flow from that scheme. 
Firstly, the rule of construction contained in section 7 must be held
to apply to the 1962 Act, unless a contrary intention appears
therein; and, secondly, the said rule of construction must also be
held to apply to the Police Service Act 1965 (“the 1965 Act”),
unless a contrary intention appears therein. It is to be noted under
the result that a contrary intention is actually expressed in section
9 of the 1962 Act to the effect that it binds the Crown; whereas in
the 1965 Act, except for two sections to which I refer hereafter, no
such intention is actually expressed. But in my view, it necessarily
follows from the second result referred to that, if a contrary
intention appears from the rest of its provisions, effect must be
given to it. 

 I
have thus come to the conclusion that the 1962 Act has reproduced,
albeit in different language, the rule of construction which had been
prescribed in section 37 of the Ordinance to the effect that no
enactment binds the Crown, unless it is therein expressly provided,
or unless it appears by necessary implication that the Crown is bound
thereby. This, in my judgment, is the same as saying that no
enactment binds the Crown unless it is expressly stated that it is
bound or unless a contrary intention appears therein. 

 It
was Mr Hosein’s submission, however, that the doctrine of necessary
implication had been abolished by section 7 of the 1962 Act and, to
establish the validity of that proposition, he referred the court to
paragraph 1(4) of the Schedule thereto which provides as follows: 




‘ No
enactment passed before the commencement of this Act shall in any
manner whatsoever affect the rights of the Crown unless it is therein
expressly provided or unless it appears by necessary implication that
the Crown is bound thereby.’ 




 That
provision reproduces, with minor adaptations, the provisions of
section 37 of the Ordinance, and was made applicable to statutes
passed before the 1962 Act, by section 60 thereof. In my judgment,
however, this provision was unnecessary and was inserted ex abundanti cautela in the Schedule, since by section 3 of the 1962 Act every provision
thereof was made applicable to statutes made or passed both before
and after its enactment. Consequently, the doctrine of necessary
implication which was preserved by the conjoint effect of sections 3
and 7 of the 1962 Act, as I have sought to demonstrate, applied to
statutes made or passed before its enactment. It was therefore
otiose to enact the rule in paragraph 1(4) of the Schedule. 

 360 

 In
any event, it seems to me, that the reproduction of the rule
prescribed in section 37 of the Ordinance and the enactment of a
provision prescribing that it applies to statutes to which the
Ordinance had been applicable before its repeal, provide no warrant
for concluding that section 7 abolished the doctrine of necessary
implication. So to conclude would be tantamount to prescribing that
section 7 was exempted from the imperative directions of section
3(2). It is obviously beyond the competence of this court so to
prescribe. If the legislature wished so to provide it would have
been very easy for it to have said so in plain words. Moreover, the
construction contended for by counsel for the Attorney- General
introduces and sustains a conflict between the two sections, whereas
the construction which Mr Daly proposed (and which I favour) not only
avoids the conflict but makes for their harmonious and congruent
operation on all enactments. In accordance with well-settled
principles, therefore, the former must be rejected and the latter
preferred. 

 It
was also contended that section 3 of the 1962 Act, being a general
provision, could not override section 7 thereof, which was a special
provision, and with which it was in conflict. If as I have held,
however, the conjoint effect of sections 3 and 7 is to preserve and
continue the rule of construction formulated in section 37 of the
Ordinance, then the question whether one section conflicts with the
other and which should prevail does not arise for consideration. 

 Kelsick
JA has drawn attention in his judgment to enactments corresponding to
sections 3 and 7 of the 1962 Act. In particular, he referred to the
Interpretation (Northern Ireland) Act 1954, and a commentary thereon
in the Northern Ireland Law Quarterly ,
Vol 16, No 2, page 218. I had the advantage of reading a photocopy
of the author’s comments, but I am unable to accept his opinion
that the Act had set to rest the doctrine of necessary implication in
Northern Ireland statutes. From my reading of his commentary, it
appears to me that his opinion was formed without giving any or
sufficient consideration to the effect of section 2(1) and (3) on
section 7 of that Act, all of which are in almost identical terms to
sections 3(1) and (2) and 7 of the 1962 Act. 

 I
pass on then to consider the question whether it could be said that
the 1965 Act binds the Crown. I accept that no formula is necessary
to be inserted in a statute to achieve such a result, but (except for
two sections in the 1965 Act dealing with industrial agreements and
disputes) I have been hard put to find any express statement therein
that it binds the Crown. It was contended that the long title was
tantamount to such a statement. That title however, shows that the
Act was passed to achieve four objectives as follows: (1) “to make
provision for the classification of the Police Service”; (2)”to
provide a procedure for the settlement of disputes between the
Government and the Police Service”; (3) “to provide for matters
concerning the relationship between the Government and the Police
Service”; and (4) “to consolidate, amend and revise the law
relating to the Police Service and for matters connected with and
incidental thereto”. 

 361 

 In
my judgment, the objectives set out in that title, fall woefully
short of anything which can reasonably be interpreted or accepted as
such an express statement. I therefore reject the contention that
anything in the nature of, or amounting to, an express statement that
the Crown is bound thereby is contained in the long title. 

 In
Section 16 and 20 of the 1965 Act, however, provision is made to
regulate and control the relationship between Government and the
Police Service with respect to their industrial relations. By
section 16 it is provided that: 




‘ Where
the department and the appropriate recognised association reach
agreement on any of the matters specified in subsection (1) of
section 12, the agreement shall be recorded in writing and shall be
signed by the chief personnel officer on behalf of the Minister of
Finance and shall be binding upon the Government and the police
officers to whom the agreement relates.’ 




 If
there is failure to reach agreement, provision is made for the
industrial dispute arising therefrom to be referred for final
resolution by a special tribunal, whose award is binding not only on
the Government but on all police officers to whom it relates, for the
period specified in the award (being not less than five years). This
is prescribed by section 20(1) in the following terms: 




‘ An
award made by the special tribunal under section 19 shall be binding
on the parties to the dispute and on all police officers to whom the
award relates and shall continue to be binding for a period to be
specified in the award, not less than five years from the date upon
which the award takes effect.’ 




 These
two sections furnish a striking example of what can clearly be
described as express statements binding the Crown. But the fact that
the Crown is named in these two sections does not necessarily, for
that reason, extend to it the operation of the rest of the 1965 Act. 
Indeed, that fact furnishes good ground for inferring, as Mr Hosein
contended, that the other parts of the 1965 Act were excluded from
the express statements made in those two sections. That principle of
interpretation was propounded in Perry v Eames [1891-4] All ER Rep 110 at page 113 where Chitty J held that the
Crown not being named in section 3 of the Prescription Act 1832
(which dealt with easements of light), was not bound by that section,
even though it was bound by sections 1 and 2 thereof, wherein it was
named. That principle was referred to and approved by the Court of
Appeal in Wheaton v Maple&amp;Co 3 Ch 48. For a further example of its acceptance and application see Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co Ltd v Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty [1947] KB 794, where it was held that, although section 1 of the
Merchant Shipping (Salvage) Act 1940 conferred on the Crown the right
to claim for salvage services, it did not have the effect of imposing
on the Crown a corresponding liability for performing those services
negligently. 

 362 

 The
question which therefore arises is whether, from the wording of the
provisions other than sections 16 and 20(1) of the 1965 Act, it can
be irresistibly inferred that the Crown is bound thereby. In my
judgment it is a necessary implication from the statement in the long
title that it is an Act to make provision for matters concerning the
relationship between the Government and the Police Service and the
actual provision in the body therein concerning those matters that
the legislature intended that the 1965 Act should bind the Crown. I
accordingly hold that it does. This conclusion, however, does not
determine the question whether the respondent, who was indisputably a
servant of the Crown dismissible at pleasure prior and up to the
enactment of the 1965 Act, remained subject to that implied term
after it was passed. 

 To
answer that question, one must be able to point to a provision in the
1965 Act which can be said with certainty to have varied or altered
that implied term of employment. This is so because, it must be kept
steadily in view, as I sought to demonstrate in Attorney-General v Toby (1976) 28 WIR 277, that the implied term under reference can only be
varied by statute. If the 1965 Act, therefore, has in fact provided
for a higher or different tenure, the Crown cannot be heard to say
that it is not bound thereby; but if it has not, I will be obliged to
hold that the implied term has remained intact and exposed the
appellant to the peril of dismissibility at the pleasure of the
Crown. 

 The
provisions of the 1965 Act which are germane to this question are
these: 




‘ 9.
 A police officer shall hold office subject to the provisions of this
Act and any other enactment and any regulations made thereunder and,
unless some other period of employment is specified, for an
undeterminable period. 

 10.
 A police officer who is appointed to an office in the Police Service
for a specified period shall cease to be a police officer at the
expiration of that period. 

 61.
 The modes by which a police officer may leave the Police Service are
as follows: ( a )
on dismissal or removal in consequence of disciplinary proceedings;
( b )
on compulsory retirement; ( c )
on voluntary retirement; ( d )
on retirement for medical reasons; ( e )
on resignation; ( f )
on the expiry or other termination of an appointment for a specified
period; and ( g )
on the abolition of office.’ 




 In
reference to these provisions Braithwaite J had this to say: 




‘ Bearing
in mind that one of the purposes of the Act set out in its long title
is to provide for matters concerning the relationship between the
Government and the Police Service, (to adapt the language of the
Privy Council in Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575) ‘the provisions of the Police Act, being manifestly
intended for the protection and benefit of police officers are
inconsistent with importing into their contract 

 363 

 the
term that the Crown may put an end to it at its pleasure’. Take
section 9 of the Act, for example. This section specifically and
expressly provides that subject to the provisions of the Act ... a
police officer, unless some other period of employment is specified
shall hold office for an indeterminable period. Surely this must be
a provision which is ‘inconsistent with importing into a police
officer’s contract of service the term that the Crown (Government)
may put an end to this contract at its pleasure’. Look then at the
provisions of section 61, subject to which section 9 has effect. 
This section sets out seven circumstances in which a police officer
may leave the Police Service, none of which includes dismissal at
pleasure. On the contrary, it would seem that the common law term is
expressly excluded from the list. What the provisions of sections 9
and 10 read together seem to me to do is to achieve a higher and more
secure tenure of office than that which existed prior to the coming
into operation of the Act. ‘What I conceive the true position to
be is that whereas prior to the coming into operation of the statute
a police officer apparently was dismissible at the pleasure of the
Crown, after the coming into operation of the Act, unless one of the
events described in paragraphs ( b )
to ( g )
of section 61 of the Act takes place, a police officer may be
dismissed or removed from office only in consequence of disciplinary
proceedings and not otherwise. This is what Sir Richard Crouch said
in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council at page 576 of Gould v Stuart ’.’ 




 After
quoting extensively from that judgment, he concluded thus: 




‘ I
can see no material difference between the point which I have to
determine and the point determined by the Privy Council in the case
quoted above. Again I state my determination to be that when an Act
of Parliament expressly provides for the method of dismissal of a
servant of the Crown, the Crown’s common law right to dismiss that
servant at its pleasure is thereby abrogated.’ 




 It
was principally on the above-quoted sections of the 1965 Act and the
decision in Gould v Stuart [I896] AC 575, that Mr Daly for the respondent relied to make good
his point that the 1965 Act had varied the implied term of
dismissibility at will, which previously applied to the respondent’s
employment. 

 It
is not in dispute that the respondent’s period of employment was
for an indeterminable period. But all that the word “indeterminable”
means in this context is that the period is not ascertained or fixed.
 Yet the judge held that that period was inconsistent with importing
the implied term into the respondent’s contract of employment. I
cannot see how it is. On the contrary, the converse of that
proposition seems to me to be the more logical conclusion. 

 The
judge then pointed out that section 61, subject to which section 9
had effect, had specified seven circumstances in which a police
officer 

 364 

 may
leave the service; and that the implied term of dismissibility at
pleasure was omitted from those specified. From that specification
and omission, he extracted this principle: that where an Act of
Parliament expressly provides for the method of dismissal of a
servant of the Crown, the Crown’s common law right to dismiss at
pleasure is abrogated. 

 I
do not consider that the omission of dismissibility at pleasure from
section 61 has any significance. Nor does it provide by itself, any
justification for the conclusion tht the implied term was abrogated
thereby. In my judgment, that implied term can only be affected if
it can be said that the provision in section 61( a )
relating to dismissal in consequence of disciplinary proceedings is
inconsistent therewith. 

 In
reference to sections 9 and 10, the judge expressed the view that
they had provided for “a higher and more secure tenure of office
than that which existed prior to the enactment of the [1965] Act.”
But unless section 61( a )
had effected this result, that conclusion cannot in my opinion be
justified. Section 9, as I have already noted, deals with an unfixed
period of employment while section 10 refers to the determination of
an employment after the expiration of any period that may be fixed. 
In this connection, it should be noted that the 1965 Act itself has
not specified any fixed period for the employment of a police
officer. In sum, therefore, the judge held that: (1) barring the
events specified in paragraphs ( b )
to ( g )
of section 61 of the 1965 Act, a police officer may be dismissed or
removed from his office only in consequence of disciplinary
proceedings, and not otherwise; and (2) the express provision of the
method of dismissal in section 61( a )
abrogated the implied term of dismissibility at pleasure. 

 The
crucial question raised by the judge’s conclusions, therefore, is
whether the provision contained in section 61( a )
has altered or abrogated the implied term; or, to put it another way,
is inconsistent with the right of dismissibility at pleasure. 

 If
the principles enunciated in Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575 are applicable to the instant case, the decision of the
judge on the point under reference cannot, in my view, be faulted. 
It is necessary, therefore, to understand what was in issue in that
case and what was decided by the Privy Council. That was a case in
which the New South Wales Civil Service Act 1884 (“the 1884 Act”)
made specific provisions in the body of the Act itself for several
matters, including the conditions which had to be observed to
discipline, or to effect the dismissal of, an officer. For example,
provision was made (inter alia) in section 32 for the suspension of
an officer by the Minister, or a confirmation or removal of such
suspension (if made by an officer); in section 33, for reporting a
confirmed suspension to the Governor, who was then required to call
upon the officer to show cause against his suspension, reduction in
rank, punishment by fine or dismissal; in section 34, for the
punishment by a fine of an officer who is negligent or careless in
discharging his duties; in section 35, for the summary dismissal of
officers convicted for felony 

 365 

 or
any infamous offence; and in section 37, for dismissal in the case of
dishonourable conduct or intemperance. 

 No
such provisions, however, are to be found in the 1965 Act. This at
once distinguishes the instant case from Gould v Stuart .
 In Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55 Latham CJ in commenting on the 1884 Act said that it
contained- 




‘ ...
a series of statutory provisions which brought the matter of the
dismissal of any officer through the Minister to the Governor and
they included provisions which specified in detail what the Governor
[ie the Crown] could do. There are no such provisions in the rules
made under the Act.’ 




 The
Act mentioned in that passage was the Police Regulations Act 1899,
under which rules were made specifying the conditions of admission to
the Police Service and the procedure for enquiring into disciplinary
charges. The distinction drawn beween the 1884 Act and the 1899 Act
of New South Wales by Latham CJ can also be drawn between the 1884
Act and the 1965 Act. I accordingly adopt it for present purposes. 
I also agree with the distinction made between the two enactments and
the conclusion reached by Kelsick JA, save that I do not accept that
the absence of an express statement in the 1965 Act binding the Crown
is a relevant factor in support of his conclusion. In my judgment
therefore, Gould
v Stuart [1896] AC 575 does not assist the respondent’s case and was wrongly
held by the judge to support his decision that the provisions of the
1965 Act (like the provisions of the 1884 Act) had made an exception
to the rule of dismissibility at pleasure, that is to say had
abrogated the implied term of the respondent’s employment with the
Crown. 

 In Dunn v R [1896] 1 QB 116 Kay LJ, in reference to the implied term, likened the
position of a civil servant to that of a military officer and said: 




‘ It
seems to me that the continued employment of a civil servant might in
many cases be as detrimental to the interests of the State as the
continued employment of a military officer. It is impossible not to
see that in remote places on the frontiers of our territory the
question of peace or war might depend on the action of a civil
servant on the spot; and it seems to me that there is as much ground
for the possession by the Crown of an unrestricted right of dismissal
in the case of civil service as there is in the case of military
service. When the authorities are referred to, they appear to be
distinctly to the effect that there is such a right of dismissal. 
Besides the case in the House of Lords in which the expressions used
by the learned Lords seem to be generally applicable to the service
of the Crown, there is the case of Shenton v Smith [1895] AC 229 which was not a case of military service.’ 




 As
reported in [1896] All ER Rep 907 at page 909, Lord Herschell on the
other hand, said that the appointments of such officers- 

 366 




‘ ...
are made for the public good [but] it is essential for the public
good to be able to determine the appointments at pleasure, except in
cases where, for the public good, it has been determined that some
other tenure is better.’ 




 These
observations apply with equal, if not greater force, to members of
the Police Service who, as I have noted earlier in this judgment, are
invested with vast powers and responsibilities to preserve the peace
and safeguard internal security. To remove this implied term from
their contracts of employment is a serious matter, since the removal
could gravely imperil the discipline of the service and result in
dire consequences for order and internal security in the country. 
Accordingly, it is not a step which ought to be taken without mature
deliberation and due consideration for the public good. Hence the
requirement, no doubt, that only a statute can abrogate the term. 

 The
enactment relied on, therefore, must plainly express the abrogation
or must be couched in language from which the abrogation can clearly
be spelled out, or from which it can be irresistibly, inferred. (See
in this connection Attorney-General v Hancock [1940] 1 All ER 32 at page 34 per Wrottesley J.) 

 All
that section 61( a )
says in this regard is that a mode by which a police officer may leave the service is “on dismissal or removal in consequence of
disciplinary proceedings”. In my judgment, that provision is not
inconsistent with dismissibility at pleasure. Moreover, it is not
couched in language from which it can be inferred that for the public
good a higher or different tenure has been substituted. The
provision is intended to ensure against and in fact inhibits
arbitrary or capricious action; but such a safeguard is no warrant
for concluding that a different or higher tenure was substituted. 
This is the clear effect of the decisions in Dunn v R [1896] 1 QB 116, Shenton
v Smith [1895] AC 229, Ryder
v Foley (1906) 4 CLR 422, Fletcher
v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55 and Venkata Rao v Secretary of State for India [1939] AC 248, all of which have been adequately reviewed by Kelsick
JA in his judgment and on which I find it unnecesary to comment
further. 

 In
this connection, Mr Daly referred us to Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation [1971] 2 All ER 1278. In that case the Act of 1882 stipulated, inter
alia, that a resolution of the education authority for the dismissal
of a certificated teacher should not be valid, unless written notice
of the motion to dismiss him had been sent to the teacher not less
than three weeks before the meeting at which the resolution is
adopted. That Act was preceded by an explanation of its purpose
which was- 




‘ to
secure that no certificated teacher appointed by and holding office
under a school board in Scotland shall be dismissed from such office
without due notice to the teacher and due deliberation on the part of
the board.’ 




 It
was held, inter alia, by a majority in the House of Lords, that the 

 367 

 implication
to be drawn from that stipulation was that a teacher was accorded the right to be heard in appropriate
circumstances .
 The dismissal in that case was made without affording the teacher
that right. And, even though he held his office during the pleasure
of the authority, the House of Lords ruled that the dismissal was a
nullity. The decision in that case turned on the failure to observe
the principles of natural justice provided for in the Act. As Lord
Wilberforce said at page 1296: 




‘ the
legislature intended to preserve the status of a teacher as one
holding a public office only to be dismissed after due process, in
1882 described as due deliberation by a body of elected members.’ 




 Also
relevant on this point is Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj v Attorney- General (No 1) (1976) 29 WIR 318. 

 Ridge
v Baldwin [1963] 2 All ER 66, to which we were referred, was also a case
dealing with the observance of the principles of natural justice. It
is sufficient to say that the observance of these principles has
nothing to do with the crucial question to be answered in the instant
case, namely whether the respondent held his office at the pleasure
of the Crown or for a different tenure. 

 For
these reasons I hold that there is no provision in the 1965 Act which
alters or varies, expressly or by implication, the implied term of
employment of the respondent that he holds his office during
pleasure. In my judgment the expression “dismissal ... in
consequence of disciplinary proceedings” is not inconsistent with
dismissibility at pleasure and, in any event, it is not an expression
from which the irresistible inference can be drawn that for the
public good a higher or different tenure was provided for thereby. 

 In
sum, therefore, my conclusions are these: (a) the 1962 Act has
preserved the doctrine of necessary implication, as formulated in
section 37 of the Ordinance; (b) from the wording of the long title
of the 1965 Act and its provisions “concerning the relationship
between the Government and the Police Service” it is a necessary
implication that the Crown is bound thereby; and (c) the stipulation
in section 61( a )
of the 1965 Act that “dismissal or removal in consequence of
disciplinary proceedings” is one of the modes by which a police
officer may leave the service, has not altered the implied term of
dismissibility at pleasure inherent in the respondent’s contract of
employment with the Crown, since it cannot be irresistibly inferred
therefrom that for the public good a higher or different tenure of
employment was substituted. 

 On
the pleadings and before the judge the respondent claimed that the
three offences with which he was charged and convicted did not exist
in law at any material time. The contention was that the purported
creation of them by the Police Service Commission Regulations 1966
(“the 1966 Regulations”) was ultra vires the Constitution on the ground that the power to create offences for
which members of the Police Service were triable, resided in the
Governor-General alone, by virtue of section 13 of the Constitution. 
The judge rejected the contention that 

 368 

 section
13 of the Constitution invested the Governor-General with any such
power and, as I agree entirely with his reasons for doing so, I
endorse and quote the relevant portion of his judgment: 




‘ As
I see it, [he said] the purport and intent of section 13 is to enable
the Governor-General by Order to ensure that members of a commission
carry out these functions fairly and without bias, ill-will or
corruption. In this context the Governor-General could create
criminal offences such as bribery, disclosure of confidential
information, efforts to influence a commission, and similar offences
and could prescribe both the mode of trial of these offences and the
penalties to be attached thereto (see regulations 11 to 13 of the
1961 Regulations). The important words of the section seem to me to
be ‘connected with the functions of [any] commission’, that is to
say connected with the appointment, promotion, transfer,
confirmation, removal and discipline by the commission of persons
subject to its jurisdiction. I can see nothing in this section [ie
section 13 of the Constitution] enabling the Governor-General to
create offences or charges of a disciplinary nature against persons
who are subject to the disciplinary control of the commission.’ 




 The
three leading principles applicable to the construction of statutes
were restated by Lord Salmon in the recent case, Johnson
v Moreton [1978] 3 All ER 37 at page 40 in these terms: 




‘ (1)
If the language of a statute be plain, admitting of only one meaning,
the legislation must be taken to have meant and intended what it has
plainly expressed, and whatever it has in clear terms enacted must be
enforced though it should lead to absurd or mischievous results: Vacher&amp;Sons Ltd v London Society of Compositors [1913] AC 107, 121, per Lord Atkinson. (2) The courts have no power to fill a gap in a
statute, even if satisfied that it had been overlooked by the
legislature and that if the legislature had been aware of the gap,
the legislature would have filled it in: Gladstone
v Bower [1960] 3 All ER 353; Brandling
v Barrington (1827) 6 B&amp;C 467 at page 475, per Lord Tenterden CJ. (3) If the words of a statute are capable,
without being distorted, of more than one meaning, the courts should
prefer the meaning which leads to a sensible and just result
complying with the statutory objective and reject the meaning which
leads to absurdity or injustice and is repugnant to the statutory
objective: River
Wear Commissioners v Adamson (1877) 2 App Cas 743 at page 763, per Lord Blackburn; Attorney
General v HRH Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover [1951] 1 All ER 948 at page 953, per Viscount Simonds; Stock
v Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd [1978] 1 All ER 945 at page 953 per Lord Simon of Glaisdale.’ 




 While
these principles can be of considerable assistance in interpreting a
written Constitution, it is important to remember that we are
concerned here with the interpretation of a constitutional instrument
of 

 369 

 a
particular kind, namely one manifesting a pattern and style of
draftsmanship which Lord Diplock felicitously described as “the
Westminster model” in Hinds, Hutchinson, Martin, Thomas v R (1975) 24 WIR 326 at page 332. In construing such an instrument,
therefore, it is necesssary to keep in view, not only Lord Salmon’s
restatement of the three leading principles applicable to the
interpretation of statutes, but it is essential to superimpose on
that view the principles applicable to the interpretation of
Constitutions on the Westminster model. These were authoritatively
enunciated by Lord Diplock in Hinds’s case, and I would venture to summarise them as follows. (1) A
written Constitution affecting legal rights or obligations, falls to
be construed in the light of its subject-matter and of the
surrounding circumstances with reference to which it was made. (2)
In seeking to apply to the interpretation of Constitutions on the
Westminster model, judicial opinions about other Constitutions which
differ in their express provisions from the former, care must be
taken to distinguish between judicial reasoning based on the express
words used in a particular Constitution and reasoning which depended
on what, although not expressed, is nonetheless a necessary
implication from the subject-matter of the Constitution, its
structure and the circumstances in which it was made. (3) All the
written Constitutions granted to former colonial or protected
territories by an Act of the Imperial Parliament or an Order in
Council have two things in common which have an important bearing on
their interpretation, viz (a) they differ fundamentally in their
nature from ordinary legislation passed by Parliament of a soverign
State, in that they embody what is (in substance) an agreement
reached between representatives of the various shades of political
opinion as to the structure of the organs of Government through which
the plenitude of the sovereign power of the State is to be exercised
thereafter; and (b) they were negotiated as well as drafted by
persons nurtured in that branch of the common law of England that is
concerned with public law and familiar in particular with the basic
concept of the separation of legislative, executive and judicial
power as it had been developed in the unwritten Constitution of the
United Kingdom. (4) Being evolutionary and not revolutionary, the
new Constitutions provided for continuity of Government through
successor institutions which remained similar in character to those
which they replaced. Because
of this, a great deal was left to necessary implication and
consequently the absence of express words to that effect does not
prevent the legislative, the executive and judicial powers of the new
State being exercisable exclusively by the legislative, by the
executive and by the judicature respectively (emphasis supplied). And (5) having regard to the characteristics of
such constitutional instruments and the principles applicable
thereto, it would be misleading to apply the canons of construction
applicable to ordinary legislation in the fields of substantive
criminal or civil law, and particularly those applicable to taxing
statutes which require express words to impose a charge on the
subject. 

 Kelsick
JA has demonstrated in his comprehensive review of the 

 370 

 history
of the legislation preceding the enactment of the 1962 Constitution
on 31st August 1962 that prior to (and up to) that date, the power of
exercising disciplinary control over gazetted officers, of whom the
respondent was one, resided in the Governor. As I accept his
conclusion as sound it would be sheer supererogation on my part to
make my own analysis of those provisions. I only note here that the
exercise of such control over these officers was effected both by
specifying to them the conduct which constituted breaches of
discipline and enforcing disciplinary sanctions against defaulters
for such breaches. 

 The
question therefore is whether that power in its plenitude was
transferred to the Police Service Commission under section 99 of the
Constitution. It was not contested (and rightly so) that the power
to enforce disciplinary sanctions against defaulters was vested in the
commission by section 99, but it was contended that power to specify the conduct which constituted breaches or offences was not. Express words, it
was said, or a provision from which it could be clearly inferred, was
essential to achieve that result. That submission in my view (and
the judge’s acceptance of it) failed to take into account
sufficiently, or at all, the principles enunciated by Lord Diplock in
the Hinds’s case (1975) 24 WIR 326. Adapting in particular the fourth of those
principles (as I have stated it), I hold that the transfer of the
power to specify conduct which constituted breaches of discipline was
left to necessary implication, and consequently, the absence of
express words to that effect is no justification for saying that that
power was not transferred to the commission. In my judgment, section
99 effectively and completely transferred that power to the
commission and it thereupon became entitled to exercise the powers of
the Governor, whom it clearly replaced. 

 What
then is the nature and scope of this power? The judge in his
judgment expressed his views on this question in these terms: 




‘ The
Police Service Commission from the date of its establishment until
possibly 1966 was authorised by the Constitution to exercise
disciplinary control in respect of offences created by statute or by
regulations made by the Governor-General under statute. All that the
Constitution (1962) did in this respect was: (a) in section 99 to re-
establish the commission as the disciplinary controlling body; and
(b) to transfer to the commission the power formerly vested in the
Governor to make regulations for its own procedure. 

 It
did not purport to invest any authority other than Parliament with
the power to create disciplinary offences or, to put it another way,
it did not purport to remove from Parliament the powers which
Parliament had prior to 1966 exercised under its constitutional right
to make laws. If that had been the intention, the Constitution would
have said so expressly. 

 Parliament
by the [1965] Act recognised that it would have to make regulations
for the training and discipline of the Police Service and 

 371 

 spelled
the necessity out in section 65(1)( j )
of the [1965] Act to enable the Governor-General to make regulations
for the discipline of the Police Service and to preserve only
regulations which were made under the [1965] Act and such other
regulations in operation on the date of the coming into force of the
[1965] Act. If therefore the commission without the sanction of the
Constitution purported to create or define disciplinary offences any
such effort must clearly be ultra vires the Constitution.’ 




 In
the event, he answered the question by saying that he was of opinion- 




‘ (a)
that only the Governor-General acting under the provisions of section
65 of the [1965] Act or under the provisions of the former Police
Ordinance has the power to create disciplinary offences in respect of
police officers; (b) that all regulations purported to have been made
under section 102 of the Constitution under which [the respondent]
was supposedly charged, are void, null and of no effect.’ 




 If
by the expression “disciplinary offences” the judge meant
criminal offences or offences against the public law, then I agree
entirely with him that the purported creation by the commission of
such offences was ultra vires the Constitution. It would have been a clear usurpation of power by
the commission to do so since the Governor, the commissioner’s
predecessor, had no such power under the Ordinance, nor had the
Police Service Commission established under section 66B of the
Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Orders in Council 1950 to 1959. 
The only instance in which the Governor was given power to create
criminal offences and to provide for their punishment, was under
section 66G (1)( f )
of those Orders in Council; but this power was limited to the
creation and punishment of offences connected with the functions of
the commission. Those Orders in Council were repealed by the
Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1961; but that
power remained vested in the Governor by virtue of section 86(3)( f )
thereof. 

 This
was a new legislative power expressly delegated to the Governor by
the Queen in Council and, because of this, it could not be said that
this new power to legislate for criminal offences passed to the
commission under what I have identified earlier as the fourth
principle of construction propounded by Lord Diplock in Hinds’s case (1975) 24 WIR 326. Hence the provision in section 13 of the
Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, which
retained that power in the Governor and provided for its exercise by
him under the Constitution (which repealed the Orders in Council
aforesaid). 

 The
commission however, did not usurp any power in making the 1966
Regulations, since it did not create thereunder any criminal offence
or any offence against the public law. What it did was to define
what was misconduct on the part of police officers and police
officers alone, to stipulate the disciplinary sanctions or penalties
that breaches thereof 

 372 

 would
attract, and to prescribe the procedure for discharging its functions
and dealing with disciplinary charges. It is manifest that none of
these so-called disciplinary offences bears any of the
characteristics, elements or sanctions applicable to a criminal
offence, or an offence against public law; and, moreover, the power
which the commission exercised to create them and to provide
penalties for their breach, was no greater than (and well within) the
power exercised by its predecessor, which it replaced. 

 It
was attractively argued by Mr Daly, however, that the prescription of
disciplinary offences by the commission under the 1966 Regulations
constituted the exercise of a legislative power which section 99 did
not confer upon it. In support of that submission he referred to
Professor de Smith’s Judicial Review of Administrative Actions (2nd Edn) page 57 where, in reference to the distinction between
legislative and administrative acts, the author (after observing that
it is usually expressed as being a distinction between the general and the particular) said: 




‘ A
legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of
conduct without reference to particular cases; an administrative act
is the making and issue of a specific direction or the application of
a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the
requirements of policy.’ 




 But
after specifying five criteria by which the distinction may be
detected and the legal consequences which flow from the distinction,
the author made this significant comment (at page 58): 




‘ Since
the general shades off into the particular, to discriminate between
the legislative and the administrative by reference to these criteria
may be a peculiarly difficult task and it is not surprising that the opinions of judges as to the proper
characterisation of a statutory function are often at variance.’ 




 To
illustrate the difficulty reference was made therein to the
conflicting views of the Court of Appeal in Blackpool Corporation v Locker [1948] 1 KB 349 and in Lewisham Borough Council v Roberts [1949] 2 KB 608. In the former ease, Scott LJ employed forceful
language to condemn bureaucratic behaviour and to express the opinion
that a Minister’s instructions (contained in circulars restricting
certain powers delegated to local authorities) were legislative in
character and effect; but in the latter case, where power was
delegated to a local authority to requisition a part of one
particular house, the Court of Appeal held the delegation to be an
administrative (as opposed to a legislative) act, and criticised the
opinion expressed by Scott LJ. As Dr H W R Wade rightly remarked in
his monograph on Administrative Law (2nd Edn) page 308- 




‘ [this]
shows how even judges differ in their opinions of what is
legislation, and how there are only differences of degree to mark it
off from the general run of administrative activity.’ 




 373 

 But
be that as it may, the case R v Whyte, ex parte Byrnes (1964) 109 CLR 655, in particular, and the dictum of Megaw LJ in R v Board of Visitors of Hull Prison, ex parte St Germain [1979] QB 425 quoted by Kelsick JA (to whom I am indebted for drawing
them to my notice), clearly establish the converse of Mr Daly’s
submission and support the contention of Mr Hosein (with which I
agree) that the disciplinary offences contained in the 1966
Regulations are not criminal offences or offences against the public
law but are (in substance and effect) a domestic code of conduct for
police officers made in the exercise of all executive as opposed to a
legislative power for the purpose of enabling the commission to
discharge its functions of removing and exercising disciplinary
control over, such officers. 

 A
point which has disturbed me is that the code of conduct aforesaid
was made with the consent of the Prime Minister under section 102(1)
of the Constitution. Authority is conferred under that subsection
for the commission to make regulations with his consent for the
purpose of regulating its procedure; but there is no authority
thereunder for the prescription of a code, or for such a prescription
either with to without his consent. It seems to me therefore that
the code prescribed in the 1966 Regulations with the consent of the
Prime Minister was improperly made and published under the authority
of section 102(1). 

 As
against this, however, it has to be borne in mind that the power to
charge the respondent (who was an assistant superintendent at the
material time) with breachcs involving neglect of duty and doing
(without reasonable excuse) an act amounting to a failure to perform
in a proper manner a duty imposed on him as a police officer (see the
finding of the judge), and to discipline him therefor if proved, was
a function vested in the Governor immediately before the enactment of
the Constitution (see section 66C of the 1959 Order in Council and
section 82 of the 1961 Order in Council). For the purpose of
exercising that function, the Governor was under no prior obligation
to prescribe disciplinary offences or to publish a code of
discipline. He could have exercised his disciplinary powers without
any such prescription or publication. As this was the power and
function which the commission inherited from the Governor under
section 99 of the Constitution, the respondent has no good ground for
complaint. Moreover, he was not prejudiced by the notification to
him that the breaches aforesaid were contrary to regulation 74(1)( a )
and (2)( d )
of the 1966 Regulations. 

 As
these breaches were specified with certainty and communicated to him
the notification that they were contrary to regulation 74(1)( a )
and (2)( d )
was immaterial, or mere surplusage (as Kelsick JA has put it). 
Subject, therefore, to the consequences of my conclusion that the
respondent was a servant of the Crown dismissible at pleasure, my
opinion on the preliminary point under this head is that the
commission at all material times had exclusive power under section 99
of the Constitution to define matters which constituted disciplinary
breaches 

 374 

 or
offences in the Police Service; that the three offences with which
the respondent was charged were validly defined or created thereunder
by the commission, and that the statement in the charges to the
effect that they were contrary to regulation 74(1)( a )
and (2)( d )
of the 1966 Regulations was mere surplusage and accordingly
immaterial. 

 I
move on now to consider the third point, viz whether the respondent’s
action is maintainable in view of sections 99 and 102 of the
Constitution. I must of necessity approach this question on the
footing that I have answered the first and second questions against
the respondent. It follows from these answers that the commission
was clearly exercising a function vested in it when it charged the
respondent with the three disciplinary breaches or offences under
reference and removed him from the Police Service. The respondent is
accordingly precluded by section 102(4) of the Constitution from
instituting these proceedings. I had occasion to discuss the
principles applicable to the construction and application of that
subsection in Harrikissoon v Attorney- General (1977) (unreported) and for present purposes, it is not necessary for
me to repeat in this judgment what I said then. I would merely state
that, as at present advised, I do not wish to add anything to the
views I expressed in that case. I have considered what Phillips JA
has said on this point and I should like to say that, if his answers
to the first and second questions are correct, then it seems to me
that his conclusion on the third question is also correct. 

 The
last question arose out of an intervening event, namely the enactment
of section 18 of the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and
Tobago Act 1976, the terms of which have been reproduced in the
judgments of Phillips and Kelsick JJA. However, this court as
constituted today had occasion in Faultin v Attorney-General (1978) 30 WIR 351 to consider the meaning and effect of that section
on laws passed prior to its enactment and inconsistent with the
Constitution. It held that the validation of a law by section 18 of
the Act of 1976 is effective only as from the point in time
immediately before 1st August 1976, that is to say the date on which
that Act became operative. It follows that this question, which was
raised by the court, is not material to the issues raised in this
appeal with respect to the validity or otherwise of the 1966
Regulations and certain provisions of the 1965 Act. 

 For
these reasons I would allow the appeal with costs and dismiss with
costs the respondent’s cross-appeal whereby he sought a variation
of the judgment of Braithwaite J in his favour to include (under
Order 33, rule 6, of the Rule of the Supreme Court 1975) an order
which would have the effect of determining the action in his favour. 
A necessary consequence of allowing this appeal on the grounds given
herein is that the respondent’s action against the Attorney-General
must be dismissed with costs and I would so order. There would be an
order accordingly. 

 Postscript 

 As
a postscript to this judgment I should like to add the following 

 375 

 observations.
 Irrespective of the course which the Attorney-General may be advised
to pursue hereafter, it seems to me that the divided opinions
expressed on the extremely important questions raised and discussed
in this appeal, make it essential in the public interest and for the
public good for urgent steps to be taken by Parliament to enact such
amendments to the Constitution and such other laws as may be
relevant, as
would spell out with clarity and, more particularly, place beyond
debate the precise powers and duties of the Police Service Commission, and
indeed of the other commissions established under the Constitution of
the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago 1976. As this can quite properly
be done without prejudice to accrued and subsisting rights, it would
be prudent and eminently desirable in my judgment for the steps
recommended to be implemented with the utmost despatch.

 Introduction 

 The
questions raised by this appeal are of the highest importance,
involving as they do the true nature of the legal relationship that
exists between the State (formerly “the Crown”) and a particular
category of its servants, viz the members of the Police Service,
whose conditions of service are purportedly regulated by the
provisions of the Police Service Act 1965, which came into operation
on 27th August 1966. I have used the word “purportedly” because
the first issue which falls for determination on this appeal is
whether the Act, which was passed by Parliament in December 1965 in
pursuance of its power, contained in section 36 of the former
Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago (“the Constitution”) to “make
laws for the peace, order and good government of Trinidad and Tobago”
and assented to by the Governor-General on behalf of Her Majesty, has
the legislative effect which its compliance with the provisions of
section 44 thereof would prima facie confer upon it. 

 The
questions under reference have received lengthy examination by
counsel for the parties and are such as require the most careful and
searching analysis by this court. They were first subjected to
judicial scrutiny as a result of High Court action 2227 of 1972,
commenced by a writ of summons issued by the respondent on 18th
October 1972. By his statement of claim (which was delivered with
the writ) the respondent alleged that he was at all material times a
public officer and a member of the Police Service of Trinidad and
Tobago, holding the office of assistant superintendent. He further
alleged that by letters dated 29th August 1970 and 10th September
1970, respectively, the Director of Personnel Administration informed
him of the decision of the Police Service Commission (“the
commission”) to interdict him from the performance of his duties on
half-pay and to charge him with three disciplinary offences, contrary
to regulation 74 of the Police Service Commission Regulations 1966
(“the 1966 Regulations”) (Government Notice 131 of 1966), dated
15th October 1966). 

 376 

 Thereafter
a tribunal was appointed under regulation 86 to conduct an enquiry
into the charges, particulars of which had been supplied to the
respondent by the director’s letter of 10th September 1970. On
divers days between 18th November 1970 and 12th January 1971 the
tribunal purported to conduct the enquiry, and by a letter dated
August 1971 the director informed the respondent that the tribunal
had found him guilty of all the charges and that the commission had
decided that he should be dismissed from the Police Service under
regulation 101, unless he could show good cause why he should not be
dismissed. 

 An
application made by the respondent under regulation 106 for a review
of his conviction was later granted and, by a letter dated 31st
December 1971, the respondent was informed that- 




‘ the
commission after considering the report of the review board had
re-affirmed the findings of the tribunal that the [respondent] was
guilty of the charges as aforesaid but had decided not to dismiss the
[respondent] but to remove him from the Police Service in the public
interest in accordance with regulation 99 of the Regulations, such
removal to take effect after the grant to the [respondent] of
vacation leave for which he might be eligible.’ 




 In
accordance with this decision the Commissioner of Police informed the
respondent by a letter dated 13th January 1972 that he had 171 days’
leave accrued to him and that his removal from the Police Service
would be effective from 14th August 1972. 

 The
three disciplinary offences with which the respondent had been
charged and which ultimately resulted in his removal from office were
alleged contraventions of regulation 74(1)( a )
and (2)( d )
of the 1966 Regulations, which purport to be- 




‘ ...
made by the Police Service Commission, with the consent of the Prime
Minister, under the provisions of section 102 of the Constitution of
Trinidad and Tobago.’ 




 Regulation
74 purports to create a large number of disciplinary offences, the
commission of which exposes a police officer to penalties of various
degrees of severity. It is the last of a series of twenty
regulations comprising Chapter VII the theme of which is “Conduct”.
 The regulation is divided into two paragraphs, the first of which is
of a general nature, and the second of which contains a comprehensive
list of nineteen offences, many of which are susceptible of
commission in any of several ways particularised in the regulation. 
At the end of both paragraphs appears the stipulation that a police
officer guilty of any disciplinary offence “is liable to such
punishment as is prescribed by regulation 101 or by any other
regulation”. Regulation 101 prescribes a list of eight different
penalties that may be imposed by the commission in consequence of
disciplinary proceedings brought against a police officer in respect
of an offence. These range in descending order of severity from
dismissal to a mere reprimand. 

 377 

 Regulation
75 is the first of thirty-right regulations Constituting Chapter VIII
which deals with “Disciplinary Procedure”. It reads as follow: 




‘ A
police officer who fails to comply with any regulation, order or
directive for the time being in force in the Police Service or with
any of these regulations, or commits an offence preseribed in these
regulations, shall be liable to disciplinary proceedings in
accordance with the procedure prescribed in these regulations.’ 




 Regulation
80 purports to vest the commission with the power of interdiction
from duty, with all its attendant consequences, of a police officer
for whose dismissal disciplinary proceedings “have been or are
about to be instituted”. 

 Regulation
81 relates to the investigation of allegations that may give rise to
the laying of disciplinary charges by the commission and provides (by
paragraph (8)) as follows: 




‘ Where
the commission, under section 99 of the Constitution, has delegated
to a police officer its duty of deciding under paragraph (6) whether
a police officer shall be charged and of charging such police officer
with an offence, the reference in paragraphs (4), (5), (6) and (7) to
the commission shall be construed as a reference to that police
officer.’ 




 The
foundation of the respondent’s case as pleaded in his statement of
claim was to the effect that the disciplinary offences of which he
had been convicted had no legal validity as the purported creation of
them by the 1966 regulations, was ultra vires the Constitution, void and of no effect. It was alleged that the
sole legitimate repository of the power to create such offences was
the Governor-General; a situation which existed, it was said, by
virtue of section 13 of the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order
in Council 1962 (“the 1962 Order in Council”). 

 A
further and/or alternative plea put forward by the respondent is
couched in the following terms: 




‘ the
tribunal which purportedly derived its authority over the
[respondent] from regulation [86(1)] conducted the enquiry improperly
and without regard for the due process of law in that the procedure
for such an enquiry prescribed by regulation 81 of the Regulations
had not been complied with and/or the [respondent] was deprived of
the rights and/or safeguards given him by the Regulations and in
particular regulation 81.’ 




 Particulars
were given of alleged infringements of regulation 81. 

 After
making some additional allegations, which it is not necessary to set
out, the respondent claimed the following relief: (1) declarations
that: (a) the regulations 74, 80, 81, 86, 99 and 101 were ultra vires the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, null
and void and of no effect; (b) the purported interdiction and
deprivation (of half-pay) and 

 378 

 laying
of charges and enquiry and conviction and removal were ultra vires the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, null
and void and of no effect; (c) the purported laying of charges and
enquiry and conviction and removal were ultra vires the Police Service Commission Regulations 1966, null and void and of
no effect; (d) he was and had at all material times been a public
officer and a member of the Police Service holding the office of
assistant superintendent; (e) he was and had at all material times
been entitled to the full salary, emoluments, rights, leave and other
benefits of that office and service; (f) alternatively to head (d),
that he had been wrongfully dismissed from that office and service;
(2) damages for wrongful dismissal; and (3) costs. 

 The
facts pleaded in the statement of claim were substantially admitted
in the defence, the main thrust of which was to refute the allegation
that the three disciplinary offences under reference had no legal
validity as well as any other allegation as to the impropriety of the
proceedings taken against the respondent. In particular, the
substance of the defence is contained in the pleas put forward in
paragraphs 5, 11 and 12. Paragraph 5 affirmed that the three
disciplinary offences of which the respondent had been convicted were
validly created by the 1966 Regulations and denied that power to
create the offences resided in the Governor-General only, or at all,
by virtue of section 13 of the Order in Council, or otherwise. By
paragraph 11 it was pleaded that “the [respondent’s] action was
not maintainable in view of sections 99 and 102 of the Constitution
of Trinidad and Tobago”. Paragraph 12 is in the following terms:
“Further and/or in the alternative, the [Attorney- General] will
contend that the [respondent] was a servant of the Crown dismissible
at pleasure”. 

 In
reply to the last-mentioned allegation the respondent pleaded as
follows: 




‘ As
to paragraph 12 of the defence the [respondent] will contend that the
[respondent] was not dismissible at pleasure and/or the power of the
Crown to dismiss the [respondent] at its pleasure is and was at all
material times limited and/or restricted by the Trinidad and Tobago
(Constitution) Order in Council 1962 and/or the Trinidad and Tobago
Constitution and/or the Police Service Act 1965 and/or the Police
Ordinance and/or regulations made under the Ordinance and/ or by it
being an implied term of the [respondent’s] employment and/ or
office that he was dimissible only for cause and/or in consequence of
lawful and valid disciplinary proceedings and/or in the manner
lawfully and validly specified in the legislation.’ 




 The
substantial issues between the parties being all questions of law,
the Attorney-General took advantage of the procedure prescribed by
the Rules of the Supreme Court 1946, Order 35, rule 2 (the
counterpart of the English Rules of the Supreme Court 1883, Order 34,
rule 2) and, by application on summons obtained from Maharaj J, an
order was made dated 18th June 1973 to the following effect: 

 379 




‘ ...
that the following preliminary points raised in paragraphs 5, 11 and
12 of the [Attorney-General’s] defence herein be heard and
determined in open court by a judge of the High Court on or before
the hearing of the summons for directions and/or the setting down of
the action on the general list of cases to be tried: (1) Whether the
power to create offences for which the [respondent] was triable
resides in the Governor-General only or whether the three offences
with which the [respondent] was charged were validly and properly
created by the Police Service Commission Regulations 1966 made by the
Police Service Commission with the consent of the Prime Minister
under section 102 of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago and
existed in law at any material time. (2) Whether the [respondent’s]
action is maintainable in view of sections 99 and 102 of the
Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago. (3) Whether the [respondent]
was a servant of the Crown dismissible at pleasure.’ 




 Legal
argument on these questions was heard in open court by Braithwaite J,
who delivered a written determination on 17th December 1976 It is
against that determination that the Attorney-General has appealed. 
Like Braithwaite J, I consider it appropriate to deal first with the
third question to which I shall hereafter refer as “the first
question”, redesignating the first and second questions as the
“second” and “third”, respectively. 

 The
first question: whether the respondent was a servant of the Crown
dismissible at pleasure. 

 The
correct answer to this question turns basically upon the
determination of the issue whether the Police Service Act 1965 has
the legislative effect which is normally associated with an Act of
Parliament, the supreme law-making authority in the land. This issue
arises because, in the submission of counsel for the respondent, the
Act does not contain an express statement to the effect that it binds
the Crown (now “the State”). Counsel’s submission is founded
upon section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1962 (“the Interpretation
Act”) which provides that- 




‘ No
enactment passed or made after the commencement of this Act [19th
July 1962] binds or affects in any manner.. Her Majesty’s rights or
prerogatives unless it is expressly stated therein that Her Majesty
is bound thereby.’ 




 It
may here be stated, in parenthesis, that it is not in dispute that
the respondent was at all material times the holder of a public
office, ie an office of emolument in the public service; and,
therefore, the holder of an office in the service of the Crown in a
civil capacity in respect of the government of Trinidad and Tobago
(see section 105(1) of the Constitution). 

 It
is necessary at the outset to state the relevant common law rule 

 380 

 which
is expressed by the authors of 36 Halsbury’s
Laws of England (3rd Edn) paragraph 652, as follows: 




‘ The
Crown, which means in this connection not merely the Soverign
personally, but also all bodies and persons acting as servants or
agents of the Crown, is not bound by the provisions of any statute
unless the contrary is expressly stated or there is a necessary
implication that it was intended to be bound. In particular, the
Crown is not normally bound by a statute imposing a duty or tax. 

 In
the past, attempts were made to classify the cases in which an
intention to bind the Crown was to be inferred. It was said, for
example, that the necessary implication would arise in the case of
any statute made for the public good, the advancement of religion and
justice, and to prevent injury and wrong. Generalisations of this
nature have received occasional approval in more modern times, but
their validity, particularly in so far as they relate to statutes for
the public good, has been more often, and more powerfully, doubted,
and it is clear that the question whether the Crown is bound by a
statute in which express provision is not made is treated today as
one to be answered by reference purely to the provisions of the
statute in question or the code of which it forms a part.’ 




 Numerous
statutes dealing with a large variety of subjects have in the past
given rise to the question of interpretation whether they were
intended by necessary implication to be binding on the Crown. In one
such case, Province
of Bombay v Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay [1947] AC 58, which was determined by the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council on appeal from the High Court of Bombay, it was held
that: 




‘ (1)
the general principle applicable in England in deciding whether the
Crown is bound by a statute – that it must be expressly named or be
bound ‘by necessary implication’ – applies also to Indian
legislation; (2) The Crown is not bound, either expressly or by
necessary implication, by section 222 (1) and section 265 of the City
of Bombay Municipal Act 1888, which in effect give the Municipality
power to carry water mains for the purposes of water supply through,
across or under any street and ‘into, through or under any land
whatsoever within the city.’’ 




 Delivering
the advice of the Board, Lord du Parcq said (at page 63): 




‘ In
the recent case of Attorney-General v Hancock [1940] 1 KB 427 at page 435 Wrottesley J cited a series of decisions
in which the Crown was held not to be bound although the statute in
question was clearly for the public benefit. A plain and striking
example is the case which their Lordships have already cited, Gorton
Local Board v Prison Commissioners [1940] 2 KB 165 at page 168, where it was held that a by-law, made
under the Public Health Act 1875 and clearly designed 

 381 

 to
safe-guard the health of the public, did not bind the Crown, and gave
the local board no control over one of His Majesty’s prisons. In
the present case the High Court disposed of the submission by a
finding that, on the material before them, it was not shown to be for
the public good that the Crown should be bound by the Municipal Act. 
This is, perhaps, not a wholly satisfactory way of dealing with the
respondent’s contention, which was, not that the court must
consider whether it is for the public good that the Crown should be
bound by a particular Act, but that wherever an Act is ‘for the
public good’ it must be taken to bind the Crown. Their Lordships
prefer to say that the apparent purpose of the statute is one
element, and may be an important element, to be considered when an
intention to bind the Crown is alleged. If it can be affirmed that,
at the time when the statute was passed and received the royal
sanction, it was apparent from its terms that its beneficient purpose
must be wholly frustrated unless the Crown were bound, then it may be
inferred that the Crown has agreed to be bound. Their Lordships will
add that when the court is asked to draw this inference, it must
always be remembered that, if it be the intention of the legislature
that the Crown shall be bound, nothing is easier than to say so in
plain words.’ 




 In
the same case Lord du Parcq had earlier said (at page 61): 




‘ The
Crown may be bound, as has often been said, ‘by necessary
implication’. If, that is to say, it is manifest from the very
terms of the statute, that it was the intention of the legislature
that the Crown should be bound, then the result is the same as if the
Crown had been expressly named. It must then be inferred that the
Crown, by assenting to the law, agreed to be bound by its
provisions.’ 




 The
essence of counsel for the respondent’s submission was that section
7 of the Interpretation Act had the effect of repealing the common
law principle in relation to Acts passed after its commencent, with
the result that the Police Service Act 1965, which is specifically
declared by its long title to be “An Act to make provision [inter
alia] for matters concerning the relationship between the Government
and the Police Service”, is rendered ineffectual for the purpose of
achieving what appear to be its express objects in so far as members of the Police Service are concerned and has no
legislative effect, except in so far as the Crown is entitled to take
advantage of its provisions. 

 The
importance of the issue whether the Crown is bound by the Act lies in
the fact that if it is not so bound the respondent’s position falls
to be determined by the common law whereby, being a servant of the
Crown, he would be dismissible at the pleasure of the Crown. 

 In
support of his submission with respect to the effect of section 7 of
the Interpretation Act counsel referred to the express preservation
of the common law rule in its application to enactments passed before the commencement of the Act by section 60 thereof which, by providing 

 382 

 for
the operation of the Sehedule to the Act in relation to such
enactments, renders applicable thereto paragraph 1(4) of the Schedule
which stipulates that: 




‘ No
enactment passed before the commencement of this Act shall in any
manner whatsoever affect the rights of the Crown unless it is therein
expressly provided or unless it appears by necessary implication that
the Crown is bound thereby.’ 




 This
seemingly plausible submission is, however, gravely affected by the
operation of section 3(1) of the Act which reads as follows: 




‘ Every
provisions of this Act extends and applies to every enactment passed
or made before or after the commencement of this Act, unless a
contrary intention appears in this Act or the enactment.’ 




 At
the hearing of this appeal a prolonged argument took place with
respect to the harmonious construction of the provisions of sections
3(1) and 7 of the Act and paragraph 1(4) of the Schedule set out
above. On behalf of the appellant it was contended that this was a
proper case for the application of the well-known maxim generalia specialibus non derogant and its converse specialia generalibus derogant ,
the effect of which, it was said, was to leave section 7, “a
special enactment”, unaffected by section 3(1) (which was described
as “a comprehensive enactment”). While agreeing that it is
comprehensive I would add that it is fundamental to a proper
understanding and application of the provisions of the Interpretation
Act. 

 I
am unable to accept counsel’s contention which, in my judgment,
fails to give effect to the clearly expressed object of section 3(1),
viz to oust the application of any provision of the Act to any
enactment in any case where a contrary intention appears either in
the Act or in the enactment .
 It is essential to bear in mind that the Act is an Interpretation
Act, the function of which is to assist in the interpretation of
enactments. It appears to me that to seek to invoke for its
construction the rule as to the implied repeal of general provisions
in enactments by special provisions relating to the same subject is
contrary not only to the principle’s upon which that rule is
founded (see Craies on Statute Law (7th Edn) pages 377-382) but also to the clear intendment of sections
3(1) and 4 of the Act. Section 4 is to the following effect: 




‘ Nothing
in this Act shall be construed as excluding the application to all
enactment of a rule of construction applicable thereto and not
inconsistent with this Act.’ 




 It
appears to me that the conjoint effect of these two provisions is to
leave intact the paramount common law rule of interpretation firmly
founded on the requirements of reason and common sense, viz that
instruments must be construed so as to give effect to their
intention. As was said by Lord Watson, delivering his opinion in the
House of Lords in Salomon v Salomon&amp;Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 at page 38: 

 383 




‘‘ Intention
of the legislature’ is a common but very slippery phrase, which,
popularly understood, may signify anything from intention embodied in
positive enactment to speculative opinion as to what the legislature
probably would have meant, although there has been an omission to
enact it. In a court of law or equity, what the legislature intended
to be done can only be legitimately ascertained from that which it
has chosen to enact, either in express words or by reasonable and
necessary implication.’ 




 The
Police Service Act 1965 (“the Police Service Act”) came into
existence on 27th August 1966), ie after the commencement of the
Constitution. It repealed and replaced the Police Ordinance. It is
described by its long title as 




‘ An
Act to make provision for the classification of the Police Service,
to provide a procedure for the settlement of disputes between the
Government and the Police Service, to provide for matters, concerning
the relationship between the Government and the Police Service, to
consolidate, amend and revise the law relating to the Police Service
and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto.’ 




 It
is an enactment passed by the legislative arm of the Government (then
“the Crown”) for the express purpose (inter alia) of regulating
the relations between the “Government” and the “Police
Service”, i e between the Crown and its servants. A perusal of the
Act as a whole, including its long title, leads to the irresistible
conclusion that the legislature intended that the Act should have a
legally-binding effect on those relations. The word “provide”
and cognate expressions are normally used by Parliament for the
purpose of achieving legally- binding results by way of legislation. 
In my opinion, any suggestion that there is not at least a necessary implication that this was the object of the Act is
plainly untenable. No such suggestion was in fact made. 

 The
submission on behalf of the Attorney-General was that the Crown was
not bound by the Act because it did not contain an express statement to that effect as required by section 7 of the Interpretation Act. I
have no hesitation in rejecting this argument. In my judgment, a
statment sufficient for the purposes of section 7 is to be found in
the long title of the Act, which “is undoubtedly part of the Act”
and which “it is legitimate to use for the purpose of interpreting
the Act as a whole and ascertaining its scope” (see Vacher v London Society of Compositors [1913] AC 107 at page 128 per Lord Moulton). 

 In Ealing London Borough Council v Race Relations Board [1972] AC 342 at page 361 Lord Simon of Glaisdale (one of five
members of the House of Lords determining an appeal relating to a
question of interpretation of certain provisions of the Race
Relations Act 1968) listed what he described as “five principal
avenues of approach to the ascertainment of the legislative
intention”, one of them being that the courts must pay- 

 384 




‘ particular
regard to the long title of the statute to be interpreted (and, where
available, the preamble), in which the general legislative objectives
will be stated.’ 




 In
the light of this principle it appears to me to become manifest that
the general legislative objective of the Police Service Act is that
the Crown should be bound by its provisions. In any event, there is
a clear indication by necessary implication from the language of the
Act as a whole of an intention that the Crown should be bound by its
terms. This is sufficient for the purposes of section 3(1) and thus
renders nugatory the operation of section 7. 

 Such
a construction, it was urged, nullifies the object of section 7 to
alter the common law rule in relation to future enactments so as to
provide that the Crown should be bound thereby only in cases where an express statement to that effect is contained in the enactment. The answer to this
ojection is, of course, that it is equally clear that section 3(1)
contemplates exactly this result in appropriate cases. The gravamen
of the matter is that there is no real incompatibility between
sections 3(1) and 7 of the Act. It is obvious that the majority of
statutes are of such a nature as not to have a binding effect upon
the Crown (now “the State”) in the absence of a statement of the
kind contemplated by section 7. In cases like the present, the fact
that the absence of such a statement does not affect the binding
nature of the statute in relation to the crown results from the
over-riding effect of section 3(1) in ousting the operation of
section 7 for the purpose of carrying out the intention of the
legislature. 

 This
is but one illustration of the cardinal rule that instruments are to
be construed as a whole and not in separate bits and pieces. As is
stated in Craies on Statute Law (7th Edn) page 99: 




‘‘ It
is not the duty of a court of law’, said Selwyn LJ in Smith’s case (1869) LR 4 Ch App 611 at page 614 ‘to be astute to find out
ways in which the object of an Act of the legislature may be
defeated’. 

 This
rule of construction, viz exposition ex visceribus actus ,
has frequently been recognised and acted upon by courts of law from
Coke’s time down to the present day. In Brett v Brett (1826) 3 Addams 210 at page 216 Sir John Nicholl MR said as follows:
‘The key to the opening of every law is the reason and spirit of
the law; it is the animus imponentis ,
the intention of the law-maker expressed in the law itself, taken as
a whole. Hence, to arrive at the meaning of any particular phrase in
a statute, the particular phrase is not to be viewed detached from
its context in the statute; it is to be viewed in connection with its
whole context, meaning by this as well the title and preamble as the
purview or enacting part of the statute.’ 

 In Bywater v Brandling (1828) 7 B&amp;C 643 at page 660 Lord Tenterden said: ‘In
construing Acts of Parliament we are to look not only at the language
of the preamble or of any particular clause, but 

 385 

 at
the language of the whole Act. And if we find in the preamble or in
any particular clause an expression not so large and extensive in its
import as those used in other parts of the Act, and upon a view of
the whole Act we can collect from the more large and extensive
expressions used in other parts the real intention of the
legislature, it is our duty to give effect to the larger expressions,
notwithstanding the phrases of less extensive import in the preamble
or in any particular clause.’’ 




 In Colquhoun v Brooks (1889) 14 App Cas 493 at page 506, Lord Herschell said: 




‘ It
is beyond dispute, too, that we are entitled, and indeed bound, when
construing the terms of any provision found in a statute, to consider
any other parts of the Act which throw light on the intention of the
legislature, and which may serve to show that the particular
provision ought not to be construed as it would be alone and apart
from the rest of the Act.’ 




 I
consider that the principles contained in the extracts which I have
quoted provide ample justification for the conclusion that the
intention of section 3(1) of the Interpretation Act makes it operate
in the present case so as to oust the application of section 7. In
this connection specific reference should be made to certain sections
of the Police Service Act which are obviously intended to confer
security of tenure of office on members of the Police Service. They
are as follows: 




‘ 9.
 A police officer shall hold office subject to the provisions of this
Act and any other enactment and any regulations made thereunder and
unless some other period of employment is specified, for an
indeterminate period. 

 10.
 A police officer who is appointed to an office in the police service
for a specified period shall cease to be a police officer at the
expiration of that period. 

 11.
 A police officer may resign his office by giving such period of
notice as may be prescribed by Regulations ... 

 61.
 The modes by which a police officer may leave the Police Service are
as follows: (a) on dismissal or removal in consequence of
disciplinary proceedings; (b) on compulsory retirement; (c) on
voluntary retirement; (d) on retirement for medical reasons; (e) on
resignation; (f) on the expiry or other termination of an appointment
for a specified period; and (g) on the abolition of office.’ 




 In
my opinion, these provisions amply support the judge’s conclusion
which he expressed in the following words: 




‘ Bearing
in mind that one of the purposes of the Act set out in its long title
is to provide for matters concerning the relationship between the
Government [the Crown] and the Police Service, to adapt the language
of the Privy Council in Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575 at page 

 386 

 576
‘the provisions of the Police Service Act, being manifestly
intended for the protection and benefit of police officers are
inconsistent with importing into their contract the term that the
Crown may put an end to it at its pleasure.’ ... 

 What
I conceive the true position to be is that whereas prior to the
coming into operation of the statute a police officer was apparently
dismissible at the pleasure of the Crown, after the coming into
operation of the Act, unless one of the events described in
paragraphs ( b )
to ( g )
of section 61 of the Act takes place, a police officer may be
dismissed or removed from office only in consequence of disciplinary
proceedings and not otherwise.’ 




 The
general principles governing the question of the Crown’s
entitlement to terminate at will the contracts of its servants are
conveniently stated in 8 Halsbury’s
Laws of England (4th Edn) Paragraph 970, as follows: 




‘ In
the absence of special statutory provisions, all contracts of service
under the Crown are terminable without notice on the part of the
Crown. This is so even if there is all express term to the contrary
in the contract, for the Crown cannot deprive itself of the power of
dismissing a servant at will, and that power cannot be taken away by
any contractual arrangement made by an executive officer or
department of state. It has even been held that this rule is only
part of the wider principle that the Crown cannot by contract fetter
its future executive action.’ 




 This
statement may be regarded as the product of the distillation of many
judicial decisions, several of which emanate from the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. Thus, in Shenton v Smith [1895] AC 229 at pages 234, 235, Lord Hobhouse, speaking for the
Committee, stated the rule as follows: 




‘ unless
in special cases where it is otherwise provided, servants of the
Crown hold their offices during the pleasure of the Crown; not by
virtue of any special prerogative of the Crown but because such are
the terms of their engagement, as is well understood throughout the
public service.’ 




 In Kodeeswaran v Attorney General of Ceylon [1970] AC 1111 at page 1118, Lord Diplock spoke for the Board when he
stated that: 




‘ It
is now well established in British constitutional theory, at any rate
as it has developed since the eighteenth century that any appointment
as a Crown servant, however subordinate, is terminable at will,
unless it is expressly otherwise provided by legislation.’ 




 See
also Attorney-General v De Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd [1920] AC 508. 

 Counsel
for the Attorney-General placed reliance on Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55, in which the High Court of Australia affirmed the 

 387 

 judgment
of the Supreme Court of New South Wales ordering that judgment be
entered for the defendant who had been sued by the plaintiff,
Fletcher, for damages for wrongful dimissal from the service of His
Majesty as a member of the police force of New South Wales. It is
sufficient to state my opinion that Fletcher’s case is clearly distinguishable from the present case as well as from Shenton v Smith, as was pointed out by Latham CJ (at page 69). 

 It
seems to me that the long title of the Police Service Act and the
sections to which reference has been made lead irresistibly to the
inference that it was the intention of the legislature to abolish the
common law rule under consideration. In this connection it is of
interest to observe that the terms of section 61 are substantially
similar to those of regulation 46 ( a )
of the 1966 Regulations which provides (inter alia) as follows: 




‘ The
services of a police officer may be terminated only for the reasons
stated hereafter: ( a )
Where the police officer holds a permanent appointment – (i) on
dismissal or removal in consequence of disciplinary proceedings; (ii)
on compulsory retirement; (iii) on voluntary retirement; (iv) on
retirement for medical reasons; (v) on being retired in the public
interest; (vi) on resignation without benefits payable under any
enactment providing for the grant of pensions, gratuities or
compensation; (vii) on the abolition of office.’ 




 The
insertion in this regulation of the word “only” is, in my
opinion, merely in consonance with the legislature’s intention,
necessarily to be implied from section 61 of the Act, not to preserve
the common law rule whereby the Crown had been entitled to dismiss
police officers at its pleasure. 

 The
simple fact is that section 3(2) of the Interpretation Act
unequivocally preserves the common law principle of the paramountcy
of the intention of an enactment for the purposes of its construction and thus curtails what might at
first sight appear to be the effect of section 7. Nor is there any
incongruity about this. In relation to a special enactment like the
Police Service Act, which is intended to regulate the contractual
relations between the Crown and a category of its servants, the
scheme of the Interpretation Act clearly accords with reason and
common sense. In the case of an ordinary enactment which prima facie
has no reference to the Crown, the test to be applied for
determination of the question whether it is binding on the Crown
remains the same whether it is passed or made before, or after, the
date of commencement of the Interpretation Act. The universal test,
as stated in Salomon v Salomon&amp;Co Ltd [1897] AC 22, is the intention of the enactment to be gathered either
from necessary implication or (in cases of enactments where it is not
possible to arrive at the intention by this route) an express
statement thereof. It is only to this latter category that section
7, being unaffected by section 3(1), can aspire to have any
application. 

 It
appears to me that when viewed in this light not only is a 

 388 

 harmonious
construction given to the Interpretation Act, but it is hereby
rendered capable of serving the purpose for which it was intended,
viz as an aid to the proper interpretation of enactments. I am
fortified in this view by the dictum of Byles J in R v Morris (1867) LR 1 CCR 90 at page 95 (cited with approval by Slesser LJ in Lord Eldon v Hedley Bros [1935] 2 KB 1 at page 24) to the effect that: 




‘ It
must be remembered that it is a sound rule to construe a statute in
conformity with the common law rather than against it, except where
or in so far as the statute is plainly intended to alter the course
of the common law.’ 




 The
presumption against the alteration of the common law by statute is
founded upon an abundance of authority. The relevant principles are
conveniently summarized in Craies on Statute Law (7th Edn) page 339 in the following words: 




‘ If
it is clear that it was the intention of the legislature in passing a
new statute to abrogate the previous common law on the subject, the
common law must give way and the statute must prevail; but there is
no presumption that a statute is intended to override the common law.
 In fact the presumption, if any, is the other way, for ‘the
general rule in exposition is this, that in all doubtful matters, and
where the expression is in general terms, the words are to receive
such a construction as may be agreeable to the rules of common law in
cases of that nature, for statutes are not presumed to make any
alteration in the common law further or otherwise than the Act does
expressly declare’. ( per
curiam, Arthur v Bokenham (1708) 11 Mod 150; Secretary
of State for India v Bank of India Ltd (1938) LR 65 Ind App 286 at page 298 per Lord Wright). ‘It is a well-established principle of construction
that a statute is not to be taken as establishing a fundamental
alteration in the general law unless it uses words that point
unmistakably to that conclusion’ ( per Devlin J in National Assistance Board v Wilkinson [1952] 2 QB 648, DC). ‘And if’, as Coleridge J said in R v Scott (1856) 25 LJMC 128 at page 133 ‘there is a seeming conflict between the common law and the provisions of a statute’,
it is not right to begin ‘by assuming at once that there is a real conflict and sacrificing the common law’; we ought rather to
proceed in the first place ‘by carefully examining whether the two
may not be reconciled, and full effect given to both’.’ 




 The
real value of section 7 of the Interpretation Act appears to be that
it serves as a perpetual reminder to legal draftsmen to insert in
enactments intended to be binding on the State an express statement
of such intention for which, it is important to observe, no specific
form of words is prescribed. In this connection it is interesting to
note that the State (formerly “the Crown”) Liability and
Proceedings Act 1966, does not contain an express statement in the
form “this Act binds the Crown”, which is sometimes regarded as
possessing some sort of 

 389 

 magical
quality. With respect to that Act counsel for the Attorney- General
conceded that there was an express statement of intention to bind the
Crown resulting from various expressions used in the Act. It would,
of course, have been fatal to his case to concede the application of
the principle of necessary implication. 

 For
the reasons I have endeavoured to state I am of opinion that the
Interpretation Act does not affect the Police Service Act in the
manner contended for by counsel for the Attorney-General. I am
satisfied that on the true construction of this enactment the Crown
was not entitled to terminate the respondent’s appointment except
in a manner provided for by the enactment. I am therefore of the
view that the judge’s determination of this question was correct. 

 The
second question 

 Having
arrived at this conclusion I now turn to a consideration of the
second question that was determined by the judge. It is in the
following terms: 




‘ Whether
the power to create offences for which the [respondent] was triable
resides in the Governor-General only or whether the three offences
with which the [respondent] was charged were validly and properly
created by the Police Service Commission Regulations 1966 made by the
Police Service Commission with the consent of the Prime Minister
under section 102 of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago and
existed in law at any material time.’ 




 A
useful starting-point for the resolution of this question is an
enquiry into the history of any legal provisions relating to the
discipline of the Police Service that were in existence prior to the
coming into operation of the 1966 Regulations. It is reasonable to
expect that the Police Service Act should contain such provisions. 
By section 65 of the Act it is provided (inter alia) as follows: 




‘ (1)
The Governor-General may make regulations for carrying out or giving
effect to this Act, and in particular for the following matters,
namely – ... ( j )
the enlistment, training and discipline of the Police Service; ...
( n )
Generally, for the good order and government of the Police Service
... 

 (3)
Any regulations and any other regulations respecting the Police
Service in operation at the coming into operation of this Act shall
have effect in relation to police officers under this Act until regulations have been made under this Act.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 The
importance of this section cannot be over-estimated. This is
because, in my opinion, it shows that it was the express intention of
Parliament to vest in the Governor-General the power to make
regulations relating to the several matters enumerated therein,
including regulations governing the discipline of the Service (the
matter with which we are here specifically concerned). Moreover, the
insertion of 

 390 

 the
stipulation that any relevant regulations should continue in
operation until the making of regulations under section 65 indicates
that it was not then contemplated by Parliament that any other
authority would be vested with that power. It may not be otiose to
add that it is manifest that the general power given by section
65(1)( j )
to make regulations for the “discipline of the Police Service”
includes the power to create disciplinary offences susceptible of
commission by members of the service. Prior to the commencement of
the Act there had been in existence the Police Regulations 1954,
(“the 1954 Regulations”) made by the Governor in Council under
section 23 of the Police Ordinance, which had been repealed and
replaced by the Act. 

 It
is imperative at this point to direct attention to the operation of
the Existing Laws Amendment Order 1962, made by the Governor-General
under section 4 of the 1962 Order in Council, in relation to the
Police Ordinance as well as the 1954 Regulations. Section 1 of that
Order provides that the expression “existing laws” should have
the same meaning as that assigned to it by the 1962 Order in Council
and that “existing law” should be construed accordingly. Section
4(5) of the Order in Council defines “the existing laws” as
meaning- 




‘ .
. . all Acts, Ordinances, laws, regulations, orders and other
instruments having the effect of law made or having effect as if they
had been made in pursuance of the existing Order [ie the 1961 Order
in Council] and having effect as part of the law of the colony of
Trinidad and Tobago immediately before the commencement of this
Order.’ 




 Section
4(1) of the 1962 Order in Council provides as follows: 




‘ Subject
to the provisions of this section, the operation of the existing laws
after the commencement of this Order shall not be affected by the
revocation of the existing Order but the existing laws shall be
construed with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and
exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with
this Order.’ 




 Section
3 of the Existing Laws Amendment Order 1962 is to the following
effect: 




‘ (1)
Subject to this Order and the Constitution, a reference in any
existing law to the Governor (meaning thereby a Governor of the
former colony of Trinidad and Tobago) including a reference to the
Governor in Council or the Governor in Executive Council, shall be
read and construed as a reference to the Governor-General. 

 (2)
For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that – ( a )
where immediately before the commencement of this Order a function
was, under an existing law, expressed to be exercisable by the
Governor acting in his discretion, or absolute discretion, then
unless that function is, under the Constitution, expressed to be
exercisable by the 

 391 

 Governor-General
acting in accordance with his own deliberate judgment or in
accordance with the advice of any person or authority other than the
Cabinet, that function is exercisable by the Governor- General acting
in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting
under the general authority of the Cabinet; (b) where immediately
before the commencement of this Order a function was, under an
existing law, expressed to be exercisable by the Governor or any
person or authority and that function is, under the Constitution,
expressed to be exercisable by some other person or authority, then
that function is exercisable by that other person or authority in
accordance with the Constitution.’ 




 The
cumulative effect of the foregoing provisions, in my judgment, was
not only to preserve the Police Ordinance and the 1954 Regulations
made thereunder but also to confer upon the Governor-General, as the
chief executive authority of the State, the power of making any new
regulations in relation to matters concerning the discipline of the
Police Force (later “the service”). In the exercise of this
power the Governor- General would, of course, have to act in
accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under
the general authority of the Cabinet”. (See also section 63 of the
Constitution.) 

 These
were the circumstances in which the Police Service Act came into
existence. While it repealed and replaced the Police Ordinance it
expressly preserved the 1954 Regulations, which, however, did not
provide a comprehensive code of disciplinary offences applicable to
all police officers. No regulations having been made by the
Governor- General in exercise of the powers vested in him by section
65 of the Police Service Act, the 1966 Regulations were issued on
15th October 1966, purporting to be made by the Police Service
Commission in exercise of powers derived from section 102 of the
Constitution. 

 The
Police Service Commission owes its existence to section 98 of the
Constitution and is one of two Service Commissions (the other being
the Public Service Commission) created by the original Chapter VIII
of the Constitution entitled “The Public Service”. Both in the
pleadings and at the trial the Attorney-General relied upon sections
99 and 102 of the Constitution as providing the legal foundation for
the 1966 Regulations which purport (inter alia) to establish a code
of conduct to be obeyed by police officers and, more particularly,
for regulation 74 therof which purports to prescribe a comprehensive
list of disciplinary offences as well as the penalties to which
offenders are exposed. 

 The
respondent, on the other hand, contended, to use the words of
paragraph 11 of the statement of claim, that- 




‘ the
power to create offences for which public officers and/or members of
the Police Service are triable resides in the Governor-General only
by virtue of section 13 of the [1962 Order in Council] and must be
exercised in the manner therein prescribed.’ 




 392 

 Section
13 provides: 




‘ The
Governor-General may by Order at any time within twelve months after
the commencement of this Order make provision for the definition and
trial of offences connected with the functions of any commission
established by the Constitution and the imposition of penalties for
such offences.’ 




 In
rejecting the respondent’s contention the judge stated (inter
alia): 




‘ .
. . the purport and intent of section 13 is to enable the Governor-
General by Order to ensure that members of a commission carry out
these functions fairly and without bias, ill-will or corruption. In
this context the Governor-General could create criminal offences such
as bribery, disclosure of confidential information, efforts to
influence a commission and similar offences and could prescribe both
the mode of trial of these offences and the penalties to be attached
thereto (see regulations 11 to 13 of the 1961 Regulations). The
important words of the section seem to me to be ‘connected with the
functions of [any] commission’, that is to say connected with the
appointment, promotion, transfer, confirmation, removal and
discipline by the commission of persons subject to its jurisdiction. 
I can see nothing in this section [i e section 13 of the
Constitution] enabling the Governor-General to create offences or
charges of a disciplinary nature against persons who are subject to
the disciplinary control of the commission.’ 




 I
am in complete agreement with the judge’s reasoning, in support of
which I would refer to counsel for the Attorney-General’s
submission that the word “offence” prima facie means a criminal offence (see Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary (4th Edn) Vol 3, page 1824). It appears to me that the determination
of this issue is put beyond the shadow of a doubt by reference to the
predecessor of section 13, which appears as section 66G(2) of the
Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) (Amendment) Order in Council 1959
and which (so far as it is material for present purposes) is to the
following effect: 




‘ Subject
to the provisions of this Order, the Governor after consultation with
a commission to which this section applies may make regulations for
giving effect to the appropriate provisions of this Part of this
Order relating to that commission, and in particular and without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, may by such
regulations provide for any of the following matters, that is to say
... ( f )
the definition and trial of offences connected with the functions of
the commission and the imposition of penalties for such offences;
provided that no such penalty shall exceed a fine of five hundred
dollars and imprisonment for a term of one year ...’ 




 It
is, perhaps, useful to add that, in pursuance of this provision,
criminal 

 393 

 offences
were actually created by regulations 11 and 13 of the Police Service
Commission Regulations 1961, (“the 1961 Regulations”) which
relate respectively to the unauthorised disclosure by any person of
(inter alia) any information- 




‘ .
. . which has come to his notice in the course of the performance of
his functions under [the] Regulations in relation to any matter
referred to the commission or to a member’, 




 and
to the wilful giving to the commission or to any member thereof of
any information which he knows to be false or does not believe to be
true”. It must be pointed out, however, that, in any event, the
Governor-General never sought to exercise the power vested in him by
section 13 of the 1962 Order in Council. 

 Having
eliminated this section as a possible source of a power to create a
code of disciplinary offences applicable to the Police Service, I
must now resume a brief historical record of the relevant
legislation. I begin by referring to the Constabulary Ordinance (Cap
88 of the Revised Edition of the Laws of the Colony of Trinidad and
Tobago 1925, which was a codification of several Ordinances
commencing with No 16 of 1905). Section 24 provided (inter alia) as
follows: 




‘ The
Governor in Executive Council may make regulations relating to all or
any of the following matters, that is to say; ... (2) the training
and discipline of the force ... (7) Generally, for the good order and
government of the force.’ 




 Apart
from this, the Ordinance contained a series of sections (36 to 39)
which, conjointly falling under the heading “Discipline”,
prescribed a multifarious number of offences, ranging from the crime
of causing mutiny or sedition, punishable by a term of three years
imprisonment with hard labour after conviction on indictment, to less
serious offences, like insubordination, wilful disobedience of lawful
orders, ill-treating any animal used in the public service, etc.,
punishable, on conviction before the Inspector-General, by any one or
more of the following punishments, namely: 




‘ Imprisonment,
with or without hard labour, for any term not exceeding six months; 

 Dismissal; 

 Reduction
to a lower rank or lower rate of pay; 

 Fine
not exceeding two pounds (to be levied by stoppages from the
offender’s pay) . 




 The
Constabulary Ordinance was repealed and replaced by the Police
Ordinance (Ch 11, No 1, of the Revised Ordinances 1940) which came
into operation on 7th April 1938 as Ordinance No 5 of 1938. This
Ordinance was in its turn repealed and replaced as from 13th April
1950 by the Police Ordinance (Ch 11, No 1, of the Revised Ordinances
1950), the immediate predecessor of the Police Service Act. 

 394 

 By
section 24 of the Police Ordinance (Ch 11, No 1, of the Revised
Ordinances 1940) the Governor in Council was empowered to make
regulations relating to several matters including: ( b )
the training and discipline of the force ... ( h )
generally, for the good order and government of the force.” In
addition to this the Ordinance contained a series of sections (36 to
39 inclusive) falling under the general caption of “Discipline”
and creating a large number of criminal as well as disciplinary offences, ranging from offences punishable by three years’
imprisonment with hard labour after conviction on indictment to
disciplinary offences punishable by a magistrate or the Commissioner
of Police (the new name for the former Inspector-General of
Constabulary) by a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months,
dismissal, confinement to barrack cells or barracks, reduction of
rank or pay or a fine not exceeding $10. 

 The
same general pattern may be observed in the Police Ordinance (Ch 11,
No 1, of the Revised Ordinances 1950) (“the Police Ordinance”) in
relation to its treatment of disciplinary matters. More
specifically, section 23 empowered the Governor in Council to make
regulations for (inter alia): “( b the training and discipline of the force ... ( h )
generally, for the good order and government of the force.”
Moreover, as in the previous Ordinances, Part IV of this Ordinance,
entitled “Discipline” creates (in sections 35 to 41 inclusive) a
large and varied number of criminal as well as disciplinary offences
and also the various punishments to which offenders were exposed. 

 It
is not without interest to observe that this Ordinance (section 36)
removes the liability of inspectors and officers of lower rank to be
tried and convicted by the Commissioner for any offences punishable
by a term of imprisonment. Moreover, the provision is retained
whereby “no sentence of dismissal shall be carried out without the
confirmation thereof in writing by the Governor”. Reference may
also usefully be made to a new provision for delegation by the Commissioner of his function of enquiring into disciplinary
offences established by the last proviso to section 36(1), which
reads as follows: 




‘ Provided
further that the Commissioner may, in his discretion, depute any
police officer above the rank of inspector to enquire into any charge
under this section, and the offender shall, on conviction before such
police officer, be liable to punishment in the same manner as if he
had been convicted before a police officer other than the
Commissioner of an offence under the next succeeding section.’ 




 The
1954 Regulations were made in pursuance of the powers conferred upon
the Governor in Council by section 23 of the Police Ordinance. These
Regulations deal with a large variety of subjects including the
division of the country (then a colony) into Police Divisions and
Police Districts, the formation of various branches of the Police
Force and its classification by ranks; and create a large number of
disciplinary offences, as well as the penalties to which police
officers 

 395 

 found
guilty thereof are rendered liable. These regulations repealed the
Constabulary Regulations 1932, which were made by the Governor in
Executive Council on 24th November 1932 in pursuance of powers
contained in the Constabulary Ordinance. The 1954 Regulations have
not been expressly repealed and, except in so far as they may have
been impliedly repealed by any other valid enactment, would continue
in operation not only for that reason but also because they and any
other existing regulations respecting the Police Service have been
expressly preserved by the stipulation of section 65(1) of the Police
Service Act that they should continue in existence “until
regulations have been made under [the] Act”. No regulations have
been made under the the Act. In any event, their existence was
continued after the commencement of the 1962 Constitution by the
operation of section 4 of the 1962 Order in Council, which makes
provision for the preservation of the existing laws. 

 The
Police Service Commission was originally established by section 38 of
the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) (Amendment) Order in Council
1956, which amended the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in
Council 1950 by inserting therein three new sections, viz sections
66A, 66B and 66C. The only section that is relevant for present
purposes is 66C which I quote hereunder: 




‘ (1)
The Governor, acting in his discretion, may refer to the Police
Service Commission for their advice- 

 ( a )
any question relating to the appointment or promotion of senior
police officers; or 

 ( b )
any question relating to the dismissal or other disciplinary control
of senior police officers other than inspectors; or 

 ( c )
any question involving the exercise by the Governor of his power to
dismiss any inspector or junior police officer, or any matter
relating to an inspector or junior police officer in respect of
which, under any law in force in the colony – (i) an appeal has
been made by an inspector or junior police officer to the Governor
from a decision of the Commissioner; or (ii) a decision of the
Commissioner has been referred to the Governor for his sanction or
confirmation; 

 ( d )
any other question, not being a question relating solely to
inspectors or junior police officers, which, in his opinion, affects
in general the good order and government of the Police Force. 

 (2)
It shall be the duty of the Police Service Commission to advise the
Governor on any question which he shall refer to them in accordance
with the provisions of this section but the Governor shall not be
required to act in accordance with the advice given to him by the
said commission.’ 




 The
next stage in the evolution of the functions of the Police Service
Commission was reached when the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution)
(Amendment) Order in Council 1959 came into operation. The major
change that was effected by this Order was that, whereas the Governor
previously had a discretion whether he should seek the advice of the 

 396 

 commission
in the stipulated cases, it was rendered mandatory by this Order for
him to seek such advice, although in cases of the exercise of
disciplinary powers he was not bound to act upon the advice of the
commission. This is the effect of the new section 66C(1) the terms
of which are as follows: 




‘ Subject
to the provisions of this Order, power to appoint (including power to
appoint or transfer) police officers to whom this section applies and
to dismiss and to exercise disciplinary control over persons holding
or acting in the offices of such police officers shall vest in the
Governor acting on the recommendation of the Police Service
Commission: 

 Provided
that in the exercise of the power of dismissal and disciplinary
control over police officers to whom this section applies the
Governor shall act after consultation with the Police Service
Commission.’ 




 The
Police Service Commission Regulations 1961 (“the 1961 Regulations”)
were expressed to have been- 




‘ made
by the Governor under section 66G of the Trinidad and Tobago
(Constitution) Orders in Council 1950 to 1959, after consultation
with the Police Service Commission’ 




 and
came into operation on 6th February 1961. The powers vested in the
commission in relation to discipline were exercisable only in respect
of “relative officers”, ie “police officers to whom section 66C
of the Order in Council applies” viz officers above the rank of
inspector. The object of the 1961 Regulations, broadly speaking, was
to prescribe the procedure for the conduct of disciplinary
proceedings as well as the penalties to which offenders were liable. 
It is worthy of observation that no attempt was made to provide for
the establishment or definition of disciplinary offences, although
regulations 11 and 13 expressly created criminal offences connected with the functions of the commission, in pursuance
of powers conferred on the Governor by section 66G of the Trinidad
and Tobago Orders in Council 1950 to 1959. 

 The
next step in this evolutionary process occurred in 1961 when the
country obtained responsible government, in the form of a Cabinet
system, as a result of the coming into operation of the Trinidad and
Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1961 (“the 1961 Order in
Council”). This is the first occasion on which the Constitution of
the country was embodied in an “Annex” appended to the Order in
Council. It is desirable to set out the following provisions of this
Constitution: 




‘ 82.
 Power to make appointments to the offices of Commissioner of Police
and deputy Commissioner of Police and to dismiss and to exercise
disciplinary control over any person holding or acting in these
offices shall vest in the Governor, acting after consultation with
the Police Service Commission. 

 397 

 83(1).
 Save as provided in the last foregoing article, power to make
appointments to offices in the Police Force shall vest in the
Governor, a acting in accordance with the advice of the Police
Service Commission: 

 Provided
that power to make appointments to offices in the Police Force below
the rank of inspector shall, to such extent as may be provided by any
law of the legislature, vest in the Commissioner of Police ... 

 84(1).
 Save as provided in artice 82 of this Constitution, power to dismiss
and exercise disciplinary control over persons holding or acting in
offices in the Police Force shall vest in the Governor, acting after
consultation with the Police Service Commission; 

 Provided
that power to dismiss and exercise disciplinary control over persons
holding or acting in offices in the Police Force below the rank of
assistant superintendent on probation shall, to such extent as may be
prescribed by any law of the legislature, vest in the Commissioner of
Police.’ 




 The
final stage in the historical survey with which we are concerned was
the attainment by the country of political independence, which was
established when the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in
Council 1962 (“the 1962 Order in Council”) came into operation,
the representative of Her Majesty in Trinidad and Tobago being then
(for the first time) designated Governor-General. It is perhaps
otiose to add that Letters Patent, Royal Instructions to the Governor
and all such accoutrements of the colonial era had already
disappeared from the scene and are, therefore, irrelevant to the
resolution of the present questions (see article 1 of the 1961 Order
in Council). 

 Consideration
has already been given to the purpose and effect of section 13 of the
1962 Order in Council, which is the successor of section 66G( f )
of the Orders in Council 1950 to 1959. In this context I accept as
substantially correct the following extract from the judge’s
determination: 




 At
least up to 1950 when the Police Ordinance was passed, the
disciplinary control of the [Police] Force was vested in the
Commissioner of Police in respect of disciplinary offences created by
the legislature under Part IV of the Ordinance, and by the Governor
by regulations made under section 23( b )
of the Ordinance (see the Police Regulations 1954, Government Notice
64 of 1954). All that the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution)
(Amendment) Order in Council 1959 did was to establish a Police
Service Commission and to transfer from the Commissioner of Police to
the Commission disciplinary control of members of the Police Force
subject to procedural regulations made by the Governor in
consultation with the commission. It is noteworthy that no attempt
was made to create or define disciplinary offences in the 1961
Regulations, and quite rightly so. Section 66G of the 1959 amendment
[I e to the Constitution 

 398 

 Order
in Council] clearly gives no power to any authority to create
disciplinary offences; [but gives power] only to settle procedure. 
The Police Service Commission from the date of its establishment
until possibly 1966 was authorised by the Constitution to exercise
disciplinary control in respect of offences created by statute or by regulations made by the Governor-General under
statute .’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 It
is now necessary to embark on a discussion of the effect of sections
99 and 102 of the Constitution, which are the twin pillars on which
the case for the Attorney-General was sought to be constructed. The
first matter to which attention must be directed is that, although
the 1966 Regulations are expressed to have been- 




‘ .
. . made by the Police Service Commission, with the consent of the
Prime Minister, under the provisions of section 102 of the
Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago’, 




 it
is clear that this section, the object of which is to vest the
commission with authority to regulate its own procedure, does not,
either expressly or by necessary implication, even purport to confer on the commission the power to create disciplinary
offences. The material terms of section 102 are as follows: 




‘ (1)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, a
commission to which this section applies may, with the consent of the
Prime Minister, by regulation or otherwise regulate its own
procedure, including the procedure for the consultation with persons
with whom it is required by this Constitution to consult, and confer
powers and impose duties on any public officer or on any authority of
the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for the purpose of the
discharge of its functions. 

 (2)
Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by
subsection (1) of this section, a commission to which this section
applies may by regulation make provision for the review of its
findings in disciplinary cases. 

 (3)
At any meeting of a commission to which this section applies a quorum
shall be constituted if three members are present, and, if a quorum
is present, the commission shall not be disqualified for the
transaction of business by reason of any vacancy among its members,
and any proceeding of the commission shall be valid notwithstanding
that some person who was not entitled so to do took part therein.’ 




 It
is manifest that the key to the determination of the present issue is
to be found in the true construction of section 99(1) of the
Constitution which prescribes the functions of the Police Service
Commission in the following terms: 




‘ Power
to appoint persons to hold or act in offices in the Police Force [now
‘Service’] (including appointments on promotion and transfer 

 399 

 and
the confirmation of appointments) and to remove and exercise
disciplinary control over persons holding or acting or such offices
shall vest in the Police Service Commission: 

 Provided
that the Commission may, with the approval of the Prime Minister and
subject to such conditions as it may think fit delegate any of its
powers under this section to any of its members or to the
Commissioner of Police or any other officer of the Police Force.’ 




 It
is obvious that this provision does not expressly confer upon the commission power to create disciplinary offences for
which the section empowers it to put police officers on trial. And
it is noteworthy that counsel for the Attorney-General’s submission
that the commission is vested by the section with such a power was
not based upon the alternative principle which normally comes into
operation in regard to the construction of legal instruments, viz the
principle of necessary implication from the language of the instrument . 

 In
support of his contention, counsel invoked the application of the
rule which is described in Craies on Statute Law (7th Edn) page 258 as follows: 




‘ One
of the first principles of law with regard to the effect of an
enabling Act is that if the legislature enables something to be done
it gives power at the same time, by necessary implication, to do
everything which is indispensable for the purpose of carrying out the
purpose in view, ‘on the principle’, as Parke B said in Clarence Railway Co v Great North of England, etc., Railway Co (1845) 13 M&amp;W 706 at page 721 ‘ that
ubi aliquid conceditur conceditur etiam id sine quo res ipsa non esse
potest ’.’ 




 This
is a principle which, it must be emphasised, may be resorted to only
when it is not possible to ascertain the intention of the legislature
from the language it actually uses. In such circumstances, an
intention is ascribed to the legislature although it expresses none. 
An extensive discussion of this type of situation is to be found in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (11th Edn) Chapter 12, sections 1 and 2, pages 345-362, under the
respective headings “Implied Enactments – Necessary Incidents and
Consequences” and “Implied Powers and Obligations”. The
Chapter is introduced by the authors as follows (at page 345): 




‘ Passing
from the interpretation of the language of statutes, it remains to
consider what intentions are to be attributed to the legislature,
where it has expressed none, on questions necessarily arising out of
its enactments. 

 Although,
as already stated, the legislature is presumed to intend no
alteration in the law beyond the immediate and specific purposes of
the Act, these are considered as including all the incidents or
consequences strictly resulting from the enactment. Thus, when the
legislature imposes upon the promoters of a railway or other 

 400 

 undertaking
an obligation to construct and maintain works, it necessarily follows
that they must bear the cost of construction and maintenance, unless
there be an express or plainly implied provision to the contrary.’ 




 See
also West India Improvement Co v Attorney-General of Jamaica and Fraser [1894] AC 243. 

 In
relation to implied powers and obligations, the authors (Maxwell at
page 351) make the following statement, which expresses in different
words the principle quoted from Craies supra : 




‘ In
the same way, when powers, privileges, or property are granted by
statute, everything indispensable to their exercise or enjoyment is
impliedly granted also as it would be in a grant between private
persons.’ 




 The
following (among other) illustrations of the principle are thereafter
given in the text (at pages 351-354): 




‘ ...
Thus by a private grant or reservation of trees the power of entering
on the land where they stand and of cutting them down and carrying
them away is impliedly given or reserved, and by the grant of mines
the power to dig them is impliedly conferred ... 

 It
has been held that a colonial legislative body has impliedly granted
to it by the Act or charter which constitutes it the power of
removing and keeping excluded from the chamber where it carries on
its deliberations all persons who interrupt its proceedings, for such
a power is absolutely indispensable for the proper exercise of its
functions. But a power of punishing such offenders for their
contempt of its authority is not necessary for this purpose, and so
is not granted by implication.’ 




 As
illustrated by numerous cases the rule under consideration may be
invoked only when its application is absolutely indispensable for the carrying out of the object sought to be achieved by the
legislature. It is a common law rule and is not to
be confused with the rule of interpretation whereby the object of a
legal instrument may be determined as
a matter of necessary implication from the language of the instrument itself :
In Kielly v Carson (1843) 4 Moo PCC 63 at page 88 Parke B, delivering the opinion of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said: 




‘ The
whole question then is reduced to this – whether by law, the power
of committing for a contempt, not in the presence of the Assembly, is
incident to every local legislature. 

 The
statute law on this subject being silent, the common law is to govern
it; and what is the common law depends upon principle and precedent. 

 Their
Lordships see no reason to think, that in the principle of the common
law, any other persons are given them, than such as are 

 401 

 necessary
to the existence of such a body, and the proper exercise of the
functions which it is intended to execute. These powers are granted
by the very act of its establishment, an act which on both sides, it
is admitted, it was competent for the Crown to perform. This is the
principle which governs all legal incidents. ‘ Quando
lex aliquid concedit, concedere videtur et illud, sine quo ipsa esse
non potest ’.
 In conformity to this principle we feel no doubt that such an
Assembly has the right of protecting itself from all impediments to
the due course of its proceedings. To the full extent of every
measure which it may be really necessary to adopt, to secure the free
exercise of their legislative functions, they are justified in acting
by the principle of the common law. But the power of punishing
anyone for past misconduct as a contempt of its authority, and
adjudicating upon the fact of such contempt, and the measure of
punishment as a judicial body, irresponsible to the party accused,
whatever the real facts may be, is of a very different character, and
by no means essentially necessary for the exercise of its functions
by a local legislature, whether representative or not. All these
functions may be well performed without this extraordinary power, and
with the aid of the ordinary tribunals to investigate and punish
contemptuous insults and interruptions.’ 




 I
would respectfully adapt these words of Parke B to the facts of the
present case by stating that it is clearly not “essentially
necessary for the exercise of its functions” by the Police Service
Commission that it should be endowed with the “extraordinary
power”, not conferred upon it by section 99 of the Constitution or
any other law, to promulgate a code of disciplinary offences for the
purpose of regulating the conduct of police officers. As pointed out
at an earlier stage of this judgment, not only is this power
expressly vested in the Governor-General by section 65 of the Police
Service Act, but it is expressly provided by the legislature that the
1954 Regulations should continue in operation until the making of new
regulations under that section. Moreover, this is merely in
consonance with the discernible historical pattern whereby the making
of subordinate legislation of this nature was confined to the chief
executive authority of the country, formerly “the Governor”,
later “the Governor-General”, acting “in accordance with the
advice of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under the general
authority of the Cabinet” (see section 63(1) of the Constitution). 

 It
appears to me that such a state of affairs is dictated not only by
the law but also by reason and comonsense. It was suggested by
counsel for the Attorney-General that, with the arrival of the age of
political independence, it was no doubt regarded as desirable to
confer on an independent body like the Police Service Commission not
only the power “to remove and exercise disciplinary control” over
police officers, but also the power to create a code of disciplinary
offences for the purpose of the exercise of that power. The only
comment I would make on this aspect of the matter is that the state
of affairs envisaged by 

 402 

 counsel
appears to be analogous to a situation whereby, in the realm of the
criminal law, the legislative power of creating and defining criminal
offences were to be considered to be handed over to the judicial
officers who administer that branch of the law merely by reason of
the conferment on them of their judicial functions. 

 For
the reasons indicated, I am of opinion that the maxim upon which
counsel for the Attorney-General relied in support of the proposition
that section 99 of the Constitution provides a valid basis for the
creation of disciplinary offences by the 1966 Regulations can have no
application to the facts of the present case. 

 I
am fortified in this view by an important consideration. It is the
fact that section 99, which is alleged by the Attorney-General to be
the source of the commission’s power to create disciplinary
offences, vests it with authority, subject to certain conditions, to- 




‘ delegate
any of its powers under [the] section to any of its members or to the
Commissioner of Police or any other officer of the Police Force.’ 




 It
appears to me to be inconceivable that the alleged power could have
been considered suitable for sub-delegation. In this connection it
most be borne in mind (de Smith, Judicial
Review of Administration Action (3rd Edn) pages 264 et seq) that: 




‘ there
is a strong presumption against construing a grant of delegated
legislative power as empowering the delegate to sub-delegate the
whole or any substantial part of the law-making power entrusted to
it.’ 




 In
circumstances in which it is customary to provide for sub-delegation
of what is prima facie the purely administrative power of the exercise of disciplinary
control over police officers, it seems to be extraordinary that
section 99 should be intended, without express words, to confer in
addition a legislative power which is not normally the subject of
sub- delegation (see de Smith, Judicial
Review of Administrative Action (3rd
Edn) pages 60 et seq). I am, accordingly, of the view that the
existence of the power of delegation contained in section 99 is
inconsistent with the construction of the section contended for by
counsel for the Attorney-General . 

 An
alternative submission made on behalf of the Attorney-General was to
the effect that, on the assumption that the disciplinary offences of
which the respondent was found guilty were not validly created by the
1966 Regulations, it was open to the Attorney-General to rely upon
certain common law principles of the law of contract in order to
provide a legal foundation for their existence. This ex facie startling proposition was based, it was said, on the fact that
conduct of the kind that gave rise to the charges against the
respondent could confer on his employer the contractual right to
dismiss him. 

 The
offences with which the respondent was charged were alleged 

 403 

 contraventions
of regulation 74(1)( a )
and (2)( d ),
particulars of which were supplied by letter dated 10th September
1970. As stated by the judge: 




‘ The
offences involved allegations of (a) neglect of duty and (b) the
doing, without reasonable excuse, of an act which amounted to failure
to perform in a proper manner a duty imposed upon him as a police
officer. The precise details of the ‘offences’ are not set out
in the pleadings and are not indeed relevant for the purpose of this
determination.’ 




 Counsel,
however, contended that the charges were substantially based on
allegations of (a) incompetence or inefficiency, and (b) neglect of
duty; and that both of these allegations were such as might at common
law provide an employer with legal justification for dismissal of his
employee. In this connection reference was made to Batt, The
Law of Master and Servant (5th Edn) pages 91, 92, where the author deals with the subject of
“incompetence” as a ground for the dismissal of a servant. 

 The
first comment to be made is that, in order to determine whether any
particular act or conduct of the respondent could fall within the
common law principle sought to be invoked by counsel, it would be
necessary for the court to have full particulars of that act or
conduct. This is because it is imperative that courts of law should
at all times have regard to the basic rule stated by Scrutton LJ in Blay v Pollard and Morris [1930] 1 KB 628 at page 634, to the effect that- 




‘ .
. . cases must be decided on the issues on the record; and if it is
desired to raise other issues they must be placed on the record by
amendment.’ 




 It
is significant that although an amendment was not sought by counsel
for the Attorney-General, the main point put forward in objection to
the respondent’s application that this court should finally dispose
of the action was that the matter should be remitted to the High
Court so as to leave open to the Attorney-General a possible
opportunity of seeking an amendment of his pleadings. It is
sufficient to state that the issue raised by counsel was not a
subject-matter of the pleadings, or of the determination at first
instance of the present question; and I am satisfied that it would be
highly improper for this court to give consideration to it. In any
event, it appears to be impossible to equate an employer’s right to
dismiss an employee, which might arise on a breach or breaches of
contract, with a right purporting to originate from the commission of
disciplinary offences expressly prescribed by subsidiary legislation. 

 What,
moreover, seems to me to be an insurmountable impediment to the
entertainment of the present submission is that, by adopting the
course suggested by counsel, this court would give its sanction to an
infringement the principles of natural justice of the kind that was
the subject-matter of adjudication by the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council in Annamunthodo v Oilfield Workers Trade Union (1961) 4 WIR 

 404 

 117.
 The headnote to the report at [1961] AC 945 reads as follows: 




‘ The
appellant, a member of a trade union, was charged before the general
council of the union with offences against certain of the union
rules. There was no power under these particular rules to expel him,
since expulsion thereunder could be ordered only in the case of
second or third offences and those were the first offences alleged
against the appellant, for which under those rules a small fine only
could be imposed. The appellant having been convicted of the
offences charged, the general council purported to expel him under
another rule, rule 11(7), under which he had not been charged, which
provided for expulsion where a member had been guilty of ‘conduct
prejudicial to the interests of the union’. The appellant had
attended before the general council when the evidence was taken, but,
owing to a previous engagement, did not attend the adjourned hearing
a week later, when the charges were found proved. His expulsion was
upheld on his appeal under rule 11(7) to the annual conference of
delegates, whose decision under the rule was to be ‘final and
binding’. In an action by the appellant against the union claiming
that his purported expulsion was ultra vires and void: 

 Held ,
that rule 11(7) was not a rule which merely empowered the general
council to impose more severe penalties for the various other
offences specified in the rules provided that the conduct of which a
member was convicted under them was prejudicial to the interests of
the union. Rule 11(7) created a separate and distinct offence and
should not have been invoked for the purpose of expelling the
appellant unless he had been given notice of the charge under it and
had had a fair opportunity of meeting it. If a domestic tribunal
formulated specific charges which led only to a fine, it could not
without notice resort to other charges which led to far more serious
penalties. When the general council at the adjourned hearing desired
to proceed under rule 11(7) the hearing should again have been
adjourned so as to give the appellant notice of the fresh charge, and
by failing to do so the council had not observed the requirements of
natural justice. 

 Further,
the appellant had not, by appealing to the annual conference of
delegates, lost his right to complain of rule 11(7) being invoked. 
By having appealed he did not forfeit his right of redress in the
courts and could still complain that the original order was invalid
for want of observance of the rules of natural justice. 

 The
decision of the general council convicted the appellant of an offence
against the rules with which he had never been charged and must be
set aside and the purported expulsion declared invalid ... 

 Judgment
of the Federal Supreme Court of the West Indies (1960) 2 WIR 73
reversed.’ 




 In
my opinion, the principles enunciated in Annamunthodo’s case apply a fortiori to the case under review, seeing that the tribunal which found the
respondent guilty of disciplinary offences alleged to be in 

 405 

 contravention
of the 1966 Regulations never had to consider the question of the
commission’s entitlement at common law to dismiss the respondent
for any alleged breach of his contractual obligations. 

 In
the result, therefore, I am of opinion that the judge arrived at the
correct determination of this question which he stated in the
following words: 




‘ The
power to create ‘charges’ [or] ‘offences’ of the nature of
those preferred against the [respondent] vested solely in the
Governor- General acting in accordance with the provisions of section
65(1)( j )
of the [Police Service] Act and not in the Commission.’ 




 The
Third question 

 The
third question which the judge had to determine was as follows: 




‘ Which
the [respondent’s] action is maintainable in view of sections 99
and 102 of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago.’ 




 In
so far as this question embraces the issue whether either of these
sections may be held to be a legally valid source of the creation of
disciplinary offences by the 1966 Regulations (and more particularly
of regulation 74 under which the respondent was charged), the
question has already been answered in this judgment in favour of the
respondent. 

 The
issue that now falls for consideration is one that is raised by the
following provisions of section 102(4): 




‘ The
question whether- 

 ( a )
a Commission to which this section applies has validly performed any
functions vested in it by or under this Constitution; 

 ( b )
any member of such a commission or any other person has validly
performed any function delegated to such member or person in
pursuance of the provisions of subsection (1) of section 84, or
subsection (1) of section 93, or subsection (1) of section 99, as the
case may be, of this Constitution; or 

 ( c )
any member of such a commission or any other person has validly
performed any other function in relation to the work of the
commission or in relation to any such function as is referred to in
the preceding paragraph; 

 shall
not be enquired into in any court.’ 




 We
are concerned here with the functions vested in the Police Service
Commission by section 99 which, in my judgment, did not vest the
commission with the power to create the disciplinary offences the
alleged commission of which led to the respondent’s removal from
the Police Service. 

 The
issue to be determined, therefore, is whether this court is precluded
by section 102(4) from adjudication of the question whether the
purported exercise by the commission of the power of charging the
respondent with legally non-existent disciplinary offences could in
any 

 406 

 sense
be described as performance of a function vested in it by or under
the Constitution. 

 It
seems to me that the answer to this question is to be found in the
majority decision of the House of Lords in Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 1 All ER 208, where it was held that on the true construction
of section 4(4) of the Foreign Compensation Act 1950 (a provision
substantially similar to that under consideration): 




‘‘ determination’
meant a real [and] not a purported determination; accordingly, the
subsection did not operate to exclude enquiry by a court of law.’ 




 I
would respectfully refer to the following extract from the speech of
Lord Reid (at pages 212-214): 




‘ The
next argument is that by reason of section 4(4) of the Act of 1950,
the courts arc precluded from considering whether the commissioner’s
determination was a nullity, and, therefore it must be treated as
valid whether or not enquiry would disclose that it was a nullity. 
Section 4(4) is in these terms: ‘The determination by the
commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not
be called in question in any court of law’. The commission
maintain that these are plain words only capable of having one
meaning. Here is a determination which is apparently valid; there is
nothing on the face of the document to cast any doubt on its
validity. If it is a nullity that could only be established by
raising some kind of proceedings in court. But that would be calling
the determination in question, and that is expressly prohibited by
the statute. The appellants maintain that that is not the meaning of
the words of this provision. They say that ‘determination’ means
a real determination and does not include an apparent or purported
determination which in the eyes of the law has no existence because
it is a nullity. Or, putting it in another way, if one seeks to show
that a determination is a nullity, one is not questioning the
purported determination – one is maintaining that it does not exist
as a determination. It is one thing to question a determination
which does exist; it is quite another to say that there is nothing to
be questioned ... 

 It
has sometimes been said that it is only where a tribunal acts without
jurisdiction that its decision is a nullity. But in such cases the
word ‘jurisdiction’ has been used in a very wide sense, and I
have come to the conclusion that it is better not to use the term
except in the narrow and original sense of the tribunal being
entitled to enter on the enquiry in question. But there are many
cases where, although the tribunal had jurisdiction to enter on the
enquiry, it has done or failed to do something in the course of the
enquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity ...’ 




 I
consider this statement to be eminently applicable to the facts of
the present case in relation to which counsel for the
Attorney-General made 

 407 

 submisssions
similar to those that were rejected in the Anisminic case. In my opinion, when the commission charged the respondent with
legally non-existent disciplinary offences it was not performing any
function vested in it by section 99 of the Constitution It follows
from this that the tribunal appointed by the commission to conduct an
enquiry into the charges had no “jurisdiction to enter on the
enquiry in question” within the “narrow and original sense” of
that term as indicated in Lord Reid’s opinion. 

 I
would also respectfully refer to the following statement from the
concurring speech of Lord Pearce (at page 233): 




‘ My
Lords, the courts have a general jurisdiction over the administration
of justice in this country. From time to time Parliament sets up
special tribunals to deal with special matters and gives them
jurisdiction to decide these matters without any appeal to the
courts. When this happens the courts cannot hear appeals from such a
tribunal or substitute their own views on any matters which have been
specifically committed by Parliament to the tribunal. Such tribunals
must, however, confine themselves within the powers specially
committed to them on a true construction of the relevant Acts of
Parliament. It would lead to all absurd situation if a tribunal,
having been given a circumscribed area of enquiry, carved out from
the general jurisdiction of the courts, were entitled on its own
motion to extend that area by misconstruing the limits of its mandate
to enquire and decide as set out in the Act of Parliament ... It is,
therefore, for the courts to decide the true construction of the
statute which defines the area of a tribunal’s jurisdiction. This
is the only logical way of dealing with the situation and it is the
way in which the courts have acted in a supervisory capacity.’ 




 It
was, however, contended by counsel for the Attorney-General that the
principles enunciated in the Anisminic case must be restricted to the functions of judicial tribunals and
cannot operate so as to exclude the application of section 102(4)
from the exercise by the commission of its functions, which, it was
said, were purely administrative. The submission was that, in the
final analysis, the respondent’s complaint was against the
administrative act of his removal from office and that no regard must
be paid to the previous acts of the commission that led to such
removal. 

 In
my judgment, this submission is plainly without merit. It is clear
that the events which culminated in the respondent’s removal from
office were initiated by the commission when it charged him with
alleged contraventions of regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations and
caused an investigation of the charges to be held by a tribunal which
found him guilty of the alleged offences. It is manifest that the
tribunal’s proceedings were judicial in nature and that, if the
tribunal, to use the already quoted words of Lord Reid in the Anisminic case “had no jurisdiction to enter on the enquiry in question”,
it follows that the 

 408 

 respondent’s
removal from office as a result of its findings was a nullity and
that it is not open to the Attorney-General to invoke the provisions
of section 102(4) of the Constitution for the purpose of avoiding
this result (see de Smith, Judicial
Review of Administrative Action (3rd Edn) pages 68-77). 

 The
only other point to which I consider it necessary to refer is the
suggestion made by counsel for the Attorney-General that the present
question falls within the principle of the decision in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council [1955] 2 All ER 19, which was affirmed by the House of Lords [1956]
AC 736 and followed in R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler [1976] 3 All ER 90. In the latter case Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council was clearly distinguished from theAnisminic case [1969] 1 All ER 208 by all the members of the court, the reasons
of Lord Denning MR (with which Shaw LJ agreed) being stated ([1976] 3
All ER at page 95) as follows: 




‘ In
these circumstances I think that Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council must still be regarded as good and binding on this court. It is
readily to be distinguished from the Anisminic case. The points of difference are these. 

 Firstly,
in the Anisminic case the Foreign Compensation Act 1950 ousted the jurisdiction of the
court altogether. It precluded the court from entertaining any
complaint at any time about the determination. Whereas in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council the statutory provision has given the court jurisdiction to enquire
into the complaints so long as the applicant comes within six weeks. 
The provision is more in the nature of a limitation period than of a
complete ouster. That distinction is drawn by Professor Wade in his
book on Administrative Law (3rd Edn) (1971) pages 152, 153, and by the late Professor de Smith
in the latest edition of Halsury’s Laws of England (1 Halsbury’s Laws (4th
Edn) paragraph 22, note 14). 

 Second,
in the Anisminic case the House of Lords was considering a determination by a truly
judicial body, the Foreign Compensation Tribunal, whereas in Smith v East Elloe District Council the House was considering an order which was very much in the nature
of an administrative decision. That is a distinction which Lord Reid
himself drew in Ridge v Baldwin [1963] 2 All ER 66 at pages 75, 76, [1964] AC 40 at page 72. There
is a great difference between the two. In making a judicial
decision, the tribunal considers the rights of the parties without
regard to the public interest. But in an administrative decision
(such as a compulsory purchase order) the public interest plays an
important part. The question is, to what extent private interests
are to be subordinated to the public interest. 

 Third,
in the Anisminic case the House had to consider the actual determination of the
tribunal, whereas in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council the House had to consider the validity of the process by which the
decision was reached.’ 




 409 

 Goff
LJ while not in agreement with all the reasons expressed by Lord
Denning MR, concurred in the result and (at page 97, 98) gave two
reasons for his opinion that the two eases were distinguishable: 




‘ First,
the suggestion made by Lord Pearce that the Anisminic case dealt with a judicial decision, and an administrative or
executive decision night be different. I think it is ... 

 The
second ground of distinction is that the radio in the Anisminic case was that the House was dealing simply with a question of
jurisdiction and not a case where the order is made within the
jurisdiction, but is attacked on the ground of fraud or mala fides
...’ 




 Goff
LJ then made the following statement (at page 98): 




‘ Nevertheless,
despite these difficulties, I think there is a real distinction
between the case with which the House was dealing in Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission and Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council ,
on the ground that, in the one case the determination was a purported
determination only, because the tribunal, however eminent having
misconceived the effect of the statute, acted outside its
jurisdiction, and indeed without any jurisdiction at all, whereas
here one is dealing with an actual decision made within the
jurisdiction though sought to be challenged.’ 




 I
am satisfied that the circumstances of the present case are such as
to lead to the inescapable conclusion that in purporting to remove
the respondent from his office in consequence of his being found
guilty of legally non-existent disciplinary offences the Police
Service Commission acted “without any jurisdiction at all”. The
result is that the purported removal from office was a nullity and,
consequently, my answer to the third question is that the
respondent’s action is not barred by either section 99 to section
102 of the Constitution. 




 The
fourth question 

 The
fourth and final question for determination is one that was not and,
indeed, could not be raised in the court below as it relates to the
application, if any, to this case of the provisions of section 18 of
the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago Act 1976),
which came into operation on 1st August 1976, ie after the hearing by
the High Court of the matters submitted to it for determination. 
This question was argued by counsel at the invitation of the court. 
Section 18 of the Act provides as follows: 




‘ All
enactments passed or made by any Parliament or person or authority
under or by virtue of the former Constitution and not before the
appointed day declared by a competent court to be void by reason of
any inconsistency with any provision of the former Constitution
including in particular sections 1 and 2 thereof and that are not 

 410 

 repealed,
lapsed, spent or that had not otherwise had their effect, shall be
deemed to have been validly passed or made and to have had full force
and effect as part of the law of Trinidad and Tobago immediately
before the appointed day, even if such enactments were inconsistent
with any provision of the former Constitution including in particular
sections 1 and 2 thereof.’ 




 The
“appointed day” was 1st August 1976. 

 The
submission made by counsel for the Attorney-General in relation to
this question may be summarised as follows. (1) The effect of
section 18 is to validate retrospectively the 1966 Regulations, as
well as section 65(1)( j )
and ( m )
of the Police Service Act, if, and to the extent to which, the latter
may have been repealed by the former (2) This validation would
operate as from the respective dates of commencement of the 1966
Regulations and the relevant provisions of section 65(1) of the Act
and would result in an implied repeal of those provisions by the 1966
Regulations. 

 On
behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, it was contended that
the object of the section was not to confer validity per se on void enactments but to validate only such enactments as may have
been considered “void by reason of any inconsistency with any
provision of the former Constitution”. No question, therefore,
could arise of the 1966 Regulations, allegedly founded upon section
99, one of the provisions of that Constitution, being held to be
inconsistent with another of those provisions. In any event, the
1966 Regulations do not fall within the definition of “an
enactment”, which (according to section 2( b )
of the Interpretation Act) means “An Act or Ordinance or statutory
instrument or any provision of an Act or Ordinance or statutory
instrument”; the last-mentioned term being itself being defined as
“an instrument made under an Act or an Ordinance”. 

 I
am of opinion that the submissions of counsel for the respondent are
well founded and, in accepting them, I would stress that the vice
allegedly affecting regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations is not its
inconsistency with any provision of the 1962 Constitution, but its
intrinsic invalidity emanating from the fact that neither section 99
nor section 102 of the Constitution provides it with a legal
foundation. It is, in my judgment, void ab initio. 

 Moreover,
it seems to me that the language of section 18 is such as to make it
clear that it has no intention of interfering with vested rights,
which would be the effect of acceptance of the argument advanced on
behalf of the Attorney-General as to the retrospective validation of
the 1966 Regulations. In Lauri v Renard [1892] 3 Ch 402 at page 421, Lindley LJ said: 




‘ It
is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute shall be
construed so as to have a retrospective operation, unless its
language is such as plainly to require such a construction. And the
same rule involves another and subordinate rule, to the effect that a
statute is not 

 411 

 to
be construed so as to have a greater retrospective operation than its
language renders necessary.’ 




 In Young v Adams [1898] AC 469, in which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
had to determine whether a New South Wales Civil Service Act was
retrospective in its operation, Lord Watson, delivering the advice of
the Board, said (at page 476): 




‘ It
does not seem to be very probable that the legislature should intend
to extinguish, by means of retrospective enactment, rights and
interests which might have already been valid in a very limited class
of persons, consisting, so far as appears, of one individual, viz,
the respondent. In such cases their Lordships are of opinion that
the rule laid down by Erle CJ in Midland Railway Co v Pye (1861) 10 CB NS 179 at page 191 ought to apply. They think that in
the present case the learned Chief Justice (of New South Wales) was
right in saying that a retrospective operation ought not to be given
to the statute unless the intention of the legislature that it should
be so construed is expressed in plain and unambiguous language,
because it manifestly shocks our sense of justice that an act, legal
at the time of doing it, should be made unlawful by some new
enactment. The radio is equally apparent when a new enactment is said to convert all Act
wrongfully done into a legal act, and to deprive the person injured
of the remedy which the law then gave him.’ 




 The
principle thus expressed by the Judicial Committee is, in my
judgment, manifestly applicable to the present case. There is
nothing in the language of section 18 which requires that legal
validity be conferred upon regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations so
as to deprive the respondent of any remedy which would otherwise be
open to him. It seems to me that the object of section 18 is, in
effect, to extend the definition of “existing law” contained in
section 2 so as to include as from the appointed day all enactments that might be held to be void by reason only of inconsistency with any provision of the former Constitution. For
this purpose such enactments are- 




‘ ...
deemed to have been validly passed or made and to have had full force
and effect as part of the law of Trinidad and Tobago.’ 




 For
the reasons indicated I am of opinion that any rights vested in the
respondent by the law as it stood at the date of his removal from
office on 14th August 1972 have not been affected by section 18 of
the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago Act 1976. 




 Conclusion 

 Having
determined the three questions posed to him in favour of the
respondent, Braithwaite J on 17th December 1976 made an order that
his determination and the proceedings in the matter should be
forwarded to the registrar “for such further interlocutory process
as may be applied 

 412 

 for”.
 The appeal against the judge’s decision was instituted by notice
dated 22nd December 1976, setting out five grounds of appeal alleging
errors in law on the part of the judge. The sole relief claimed by
the Attorney-General was that the decision be reversed; in effect a
claim that the respondent’s action should be dismissed and judgment
entered for the Attorney-General. 

 On
the other hand, by a notice dated 29th December 1976, the respondent
intimated his intention to contend at the hearing of the appeal that
the judge’s decision should be varied on the ground that the judge
had erred in law and/or had wrongly exercised his discretion in not
finally disposing of the action by giving judgment for the respondent
in terms of the relief specifically claimed. This course of action,
it was alleged, should have been followed in pursuance of the Rules
of the Supreme Court 1975, Order 33, rule 6, which is an exact
replica of the Rules of the Supreme Court Order 33, rule 7 [UK], and
is to the following effect: 




‘ If
it appears to the court that the decision of any question or issue
arising in a cause or matter and tried separately from the cause or
matter substantially disposes of the cause or matter or renders the
trial of the cause or matter unnecessary, it may dismiss the cause or
matter or make such other order or give such judgment therein as may
be just.’ 




 In
these circumstances it is interesting to observe that when counsel
for the Attorney-General put forward his alternative argument to the
effect that the disciplinary offences with which the respondent was
charged had a common law foundation in the law of contract, he
submitted that this court should consider the question of remitting
the case to the judge for the purpose of affording the
Attorney-General an opportunity of having the pleadings amended in
order to raise this new issue. 

 It
seems to me that despite the latitude allowed by the rules of court
in connection with the granting of applications for amendments of
pleadings “for the purpose of determining the real questions in
controversy between the parties”, any amendment of the kind
suggested would not fall within the purpose contemplated by the rules
and would be rendered inadmissible by the likelihood of its having
the effect of prejudicing rights that would accrue to the respondent
from a Statute of Limitations (see section 5 of the Limitation of
Personal Actions Ordinance). To permit any amendment whereby the
foundation of the disciplinary charges in question is to be shifted
from allegations of breaches of regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations
to allegations of breaches of the respondent’s contractual duties
as an employee would, in my view, be reminiscent of the wolf’s
behaviour in Aesop’s fable “The Wolf and the Lamb”. I am
satisfied that nothing can be found in this case to provide the
slightest justification for the adoption of the course suggested by
counsel for the Attorney-General. 

 413 

 The
determination in favour of the respondent of the three questions
considered by the judge was, in my judgment sufficient for the
purpose of disposing of the action and made it unnecessary for any
further proceedings to be taken in the High Court. Being of opinion
that the judge arrived at the correct decision in relation to each
question and that the respondent’s rights have not been affected by
section 18 of the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago
Act 1976, I consider the present case to be a proper one for the
exercise of the powers vested in the High Court and the Court of
Appeal respectively by the Rules of the Supreme Court 1975, Order 33,
rule 6, and section 39(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
1962. The latter provision stipulates (inter alia) that: 




‘ On
the hearing of an appeal from any order of the High Court in any
civil cause or matter, the Court of Appeal shall have the power to-
( a )
confirm, vary, amend, or set aside the order or make such order as
the court from whose order the appeal is brought might have made or
to make any order which ought to have made, and to make such further
or other order as the nature of the case may require ...’ 




 Reference
should also be made to section 20 of that Act which provides as
follows: 




‘ The
High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively in the exercise of
the jurisdiction vested in them by this Act and by the Constitution
shall in every cause or matter pending before the court grant, either
absolutely or on such terms and conditions as to the court seems
just, all such remedies whatsoever as any of the parties thereto may
appear to be entitled to in respect of any legal or equitable claim
properly brought forward by him in the cause or matter, so that as
far as possible, all matters in controversy between the parties may
be completely and finally determined, and all multiplicity of legal
proceedings concerning any of those matters avoided.’ 




 I
would, accordingly, dismiss this appeal with costs and determine the
action by granting to the respondent the following relief (1)
Declarations that (a) regulation 74 of the Police Service Commission
Regulations 1966 is ultra vires the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, null
and void and of no effect; (b) the purported interdiction of the
respondent from duty by the Police Service Commission with
deprivation of half-pay, the laying of charges, the holding an
enquiry, the purported conviction of the respondent and his removal
from office were ultra vires the Police Service Commission Regulations 1966 as well as the
Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, null and
void and of no effect; (c) the respondent has at all material times
been entitled to the full salary, emoluments, rights, leave and other
benefits of that office and service; and (d) the respondent has been
wrongfully dismissed from that office and service. (2) Damages for
wrongful dismissal to be assessed by a judge in chambers. 

 414 

 Kelsick
JA. The respondent at all material times was a public officer and all
officer in the First Division of the Trinidad and Tobago Police
Service holding the office of Assistant Superintendent. 

 The
officers in the First Division (“First Division officers”)
comprised officers in rank from the Commissioner to an assistant
superintendent. In the Second Division were the other police
officers from inspector to constable (see the First and Second
Schedules to the Police Service Act 1965 (“the Act of 1965”)). 
First Division officers had been gazetted police officers (“gazetted
officers”) under the Police Ordinance, which the Act of 1965
repealed. For the purposes of the Police Ordinance I shall refer to
the police officers (other than gazetted officers) as “subordinate
officers”. 

 In
August 1971, a disciplinary tribunal appointed under the Police
Service Commission regulations 1966 (hereafter referred to as “the
1966 Regulations”), found the respondent guilty of three offences
contrary to regulation 74(1)( a )
and 74(2)( d )
of the 1966 Regulations, in consequence of which the Police Service
Commission (“the Police Commission”) imposed on the respondent
the penalty of dismissal under regulation 101(1)( a )
of the 1966 Regulations. I will refer to those offences as “the
relevant offences”. 

 On
the recommendation of the review board constituted in pursuance of
section 102(2) of the Constitution (set out in the Second Schedule to
the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1962
(hereafter respectively designated “the 1962 Constitution” and
“the 1962 Order”)) the Police Commission substituted, for the
order for the dismissal of the respondent, an order under regulation
99 of the 1966 Regulations for his removal from the Police Service in
the public interest. This took effect on 14th August 1972, when the
vacation leave for which he was eligible expired. 

 On
18th October 1972, the respondent instituted these proceedings
against the Attorney-General under section 19(2) of the Crown
Liability and Proceedings Act 1966. In paragraph 1 of the writ of
summons and in paragraph 16 of the statement of claim the respondent
sought declarations that (a) regulations 74, 80, 81, 86, 99 and 101
of the 1966 Regulations were ultra vires the 1962 Constitution, null and void and of no effect; (b) his
purported interdiction from the performance of his duties as a public
officer and a member of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service and
deprivation of half his pay as the same and the purported laying of
three charges against him and enquiry into the charges and his
purported conviction of the same and removal from the Police Service
by the Police Commission wre ultra vires the 1962 Constitution, null and void and of no effect; (c) the
purported laying of charges and enquiry and conviction and removal
were ultra vires the 1966 Regulations, null and void and of no effect; (d) he was and
had at all material times been a public officer and a member of the
Police Service holding the office of assistant superintendent; (e) he
was and had at all material times been entitled to the full salary,
emoluments, rights, leave 

 415 

 and
other benefits of that office and service; (f) alternatively to head
(d) that he had been wrongfully dismissed from that office and
service. He also claimed damages for wrongful dismissal. 

 The
pleadings raised several questions of law. 

 The
following order, dated 18th June 1973 and entered on 2nd July 1973,
was made by Maharaj J: 




‘ It
is hereby ordered and directed that the following preliminary points
raised in paragraphs 5, 11 and 12 of the [Attorney-General’s]
defence herein be heard and determined in open court by a judge of
the High Court on or before the hearing of the sunmmons for
directions and/or the setting down of the action on the general list
of cases to be tried: (1) Whether the power to create offences for
which the [respondent] was triable resides in the Governor-General
only or whether the three offences with which the [respondent] was
charged were validly and properly created by the Police Service
Commission Regulations 1966 made by the Police Service Commission
with the consent of the Prime Minister under section 102 of the
Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago and existed in law at any
material time. (2) Whether the [respondent’s] action is
maintainable in view of sections 99 and 102 of the Constitution of
Trinidad and Tobago. (3) Whether the [respondent] was a servant of
the Crown dismissible at pleasure.’ 




 The
order was made under Order 35, rule 2, of the Rules of the Supreme
Court 1946, which reads: 




‘ If
it appears to the court or a judge that there is in any cause or matter a question of laws ,
which it would be convenient to decided before any evidence is given
or any question or issue of fact is tried ... the court or judge may
make an order accordingly, and may direct such question of law to be
raised for the opinion of the court, either by special case or in
such other manner as the court or judge may deem expedient, and all
such proceedings as the decision of such question of law may render
unnecessary may thereupon be stayed.’ 




 That
rule of court was replaced as from 2nd January 1976 by Order 33,
rules 3 and 6, of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1975, which enacted: 




‘ 3.
 The court may order any question or issue arising in a cause or
matter, whether of fact or law or partly of fact and partly of law,
and whether raised by the pleadings or otherwise to be tried before,
at or after the trial of the cause or matter, and may give directions
as to the manner in which the question or issue shall be stated. 

 6.
 If it appears to the court that the decision of any question or
issue arising in a cause or matter and tried-separately from the
cause or matter substantially disposes of the cause or matter of
renders the trial of the cause or matter unnecessary, it may dismiss
the cause or matter or make such other order or give such judgment as
may be just.’ 




 416 

 These
points of law, which I shall refer to as “remits (1), (2) and (3)”
respectively, were argued before Braithwaite J who, on 17th December
1976, made the following declarations: 




‘ (1)
That the power to create disciplinary offences for which the
[respondent] was triable is vested solely in the Governor-General and
is exercisable only by regulations made by him under section 65(1)( j )
of the Act of 1965, or under [the Police Ordinance] and that the three disciplinary offences with which the [respondent] was charged were not validly and properly created by the 1966 Regulations made by the commission with the consent of
the Prime Minister under section 102 of the 1962 Constitution and/or did not exist in law at any material time .
 (2) That the [respondent’s] action is maintainable,
notwithstanding sections 99 and 102 of the 1962 Constitution. And
(3) that the [respondent], although a servant of the Crown, was not
dismissible at pleasure but was by statute dismissible or removable
only in consequence of disciplinary proceedings for a disciplinary
offence known to the law.’ 




 The
Attorney-General appealed against the decision of Braithwaite J on
the following grounds: 




‘ 1.
 The judge erred in law in concluding that the Police Commission in
creating regulations specifying disciplinary offences had acted
contrary to the 1962 Constitution and the Act of 1965. 2. The judge
erred in law in concluding that the power to create disciplinary
offences for which police officers could be punished resided only in
the Governor-General or Parliament and not in the Police Commission. 
3. The judge erred in law in holding that the disciplinary
proceedings conducted against the respondent were a nullity and were
not saved by section 102(4) of the 1962 Constitution. 4. The judge,
having found that section 13 of the 1962 Constitution did not empower
the Governor-General to create disciplinary offences for which police
officers could be disciplined, erroneously held that the commission
did not have such a power and/or that the disciplinary offences of
which the respondent was found guilty did not exist in law. 5. The
judge erred in law in holding that the respondent is entitled to
declarations sought at paragraph 16 of the respondent’s statement
of claim.’ 




 In
his cross-appeal the respondent gave notice of his intention to
contend that Braithwaite J’s decision should be varied to include
the following orders and/or reliefs: 




‘ (a)
Declarations in terms sought in paragraph 1 (a) to (e) inclusive of
the writ of summons herein. (b) An order that the [Attorney-General]
pay to the respondent all sums due to the respondent from 14th August
1972 by way of salary, emoluments and other benefits to be 

 417 

 assessed
by a judge in chambers in default of agreement. (e) An order that
the [Attorney-General] pay to the respondent the costs of the a
action. 




 on
the grounds that: 




‘ The
judge erred in law and/or wrongly exercised his discretion in
refusing to grant the relief or make the orders referred to above or
to give judgment for the respondent in terms thereof under Order 33,
rule 6, of the Rules of the Supreme Court’. 




 At
the hearing of this appeal, after arguments had been concluded on the
remits, the court of its own motion invited submissions from counsel
as to the effect, if any, on the issues in this case of section 18 of
the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago Act 1976
(“the Act of 1976”), which came into force on 1st August 1976
subsequent to the conclusion on 15th July 1976 of the hearing before
Braithwaite J. 

 The
Relevant Enactments and their Construction 

 This
appeal centres on the true meaning and effect of the following
enactments: (a) sections 99(1) and 102 of the 1962 Constitution, and
the 1966 Regulations made thereunder; (b) the Act of 1965, more
particularly sections 9, 10, 61 and 65(1)( j ),
in relation to head (a); (c) sections 3 and 7 of the Interpretation
Act 1962, in relation to head (b); and (d) section 18 of the Act of
1976 in relation to head (b) and to the 1966 Regulations. 

 Neither
sections 102(1) and 99(1) of the 1962 Constitution on the one hand,
not section 65(1)( j )
of the Act of 1965 on the other, expressly confer authority on the
Police Commission or the Governor-General, respectively, to formulate
disciplinary norms. Such a power, if it exists, must be implied. 

 The
basic common law rules of construction are saved by section 4 of the
Interpretation Act 1962 that applies to the Act of 1965 and,
according to which- 




‘ Nothing
in this Act shall be construed as excluding the application to an
enactment of a rule of construction applicable thereto and not
inconsistent with this Act.’ 




 The
Interpretation Act 1889 [UK] applied to the interpretation of the
1962 Order and Constitution (section 105(7) of the 1962
Constitution.) 

 I
do not agree with Braithwaite J that the meanings of the relevant
sections of the 1962 Constitution and of the Act of 1965 are plain
and clear. At most, they are ambiguous. 

 In
that situation I would refer for enlightenment as to the intention of
the law-makers to other provisions of the enactment so as to construe
the enactment as a whole by exposition within the four corners of the
enactment. If the doubts are not thereby resolved, I would have
recourse to extraneous aids that may throw light upon the subject. 
This includes 

 418 

 the
state of the law when the enactments were passed; the circumstances
in which they became law; the reasons for which they were passed; and
the changes they were designed to encompass; in short, the history of
the relevant law. As an aid to interpretation, I would compare other
enactments with which the enactment comprises a series related to
each other so as to form a system of legislation, and to other
enactments in pari 

 A
similar approach was taken by Wooding CJ in Felix v Burkett and Thomas (1964) 7 WIR 339 at page 346, when he adopted views expressed in Attorney-General v Brown [1920] 1 KB 773 at pages 791, 793 by Sankey J and in Hawkins v Gathercole (1855) 6 De G M&amp;G I by Turner LJ. On the appeal in Felix’s case, the Privy Council traced the course of legislative development
of the relevant enactment and derived assistance from an English Act in pari materia ( see
Felix v Thomas (1966) 10 WIR 507 at pages 512-514. 

 Useful
assistance on the construction of Commonwealth Constitutions may be
obtained from the advice of the Privy Council in Hinds, Hutchinson, Martin, Thomas v R (1975) 24 WIR 326 and in Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj v Attorney-General (No 2) (1978) 30 WIR 310. 

 Constitutions
differ in material aspects from ordinary statutes. There are rules
of construction which are peculiar to the former; while many of the
principles applicable to the latter have reference to the former. 
The external aids to interpretation of written Constitutions were
discussed in Hind’s case (1975) 24 WIR 326 on appeal from Jamaica. Lord Diplock
expatiated on the subject at page 330: 




‘ A
written Constitution, like any other written instrument affecting
legal rights or obligations, falls to be construed in the light of
its subject-matter and of the surrounding circumstances with
reference to which it was made.’ 




 It
was, he declared, proper to refer to other home-rule and independence
Constitutions of former colonial territories, more particularly those
with a unitary framework. However, a distinction must be made
between the radio decidendi of a case depending on the express words of the particular
Constitution and one arising from the necessary implication of the
subject-matter and structure of the Constitution. This is especially
so in cases interpreting federal Constitutions, where the question
may have arisen from the separation of the judicial from the
legislative or executive power, or the division of such powers
between the federation and the States. He continued (at page 331): 




‘ Nevertheless
all these Constitutions have two things in common which have an
important bearing on their interpretation. They differ fundamentally
in their nature from ordinary legislation passed by the Parliament of
a sovereign State. They embody what is in substance an agreement
reached between representatives of the various shades 

 419 

 of
political opinion in the State as to the structure of the organs of
Government through which the plenitude of the sovereign power of the
State is to be exercised in future. All of them were negotiated as
well as drafted by persons nurtured in the tradition of that branch
of the common law of England that is concerned with public law and
familiar in particular with the basic concept of separation of
legislative, executive and judicial power as it had been developed in
the unwritten Constitution of the United Kingdom As to their
subject-matter, the peoples for whom new constitutions were being
provided were already living under a system of public law in which
the local institutions through which Government was carried on, the
legislature, the executive and the courts, reflected the same basic
concept. The
new Constitutions ,
particularly in the case of unitary States, were evolutionary not
revolutionary They provided for continuity of Government through successor
institutions, ,
legislative, executive and judicial, of which the members were to be
selected in a different way, but
each institution was to exercise powers which, although enlarged,
remained of a similar character to those that had been exercised by
the orresponding institution that it had replaced . 

 Because
of this a great deal can be, and in drafting practice often is, left to necessary implication from the adoption in the new Constitution of a governmental structure
which makes provision for a legislature, an executive and a
judicature. It is taken for granted that the basic principle of
separation of powers will apply to the exercise of their respective
functions by these three organs of Government. This the Constitution
does not normally contain any express prohibition on the exercise of
legislative powers by the executive or of judicial powers by either
the executive or the legislature. As respects the judicature,
particularly if it is intended that the previously existing courts
shall continue to function, the Constitution itself may even omit any
express provision conferring judicial power on the judicature. 
Nevertheless it is well established as a rule of construction
applicable to constitutional instruments under which this
governmental structure is adopted that the absence of express words
to that effect does not prevent the legislative, the executive and
the judicial powers of the new State being exercisable exclusively by
the legislature, by the executive and by the judicature respectively.
 To seek to apply to constitutional instruments the canons of
construction applicable to ordinary legislation in the fields of
substantive criminal or civil law would, in their Lordships’ view
be misleading – particularly those applicable to taxing statutes as
to which it is a well-established principle that express words are
needed to impose a charge on the subject. 

 In
the result there can be discerned in all those Constitutions which
have their origin in an Act of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster
or in an Order in Council, a common pattern and style of
draftsman-ship which may conveniently be described as ‘the
Westminster model’.’ 




 420 

 Lord
Hailsham of St Marylebone in his advice in Maharaj’s case (1978) 30 WIR at pages 323, 324 referred to independence
Constitutions of former colonial territories as being in pari materia: 




‘ The
1962 Constitution is one of a family of Constitutions similar, but not now identical in form, enacted for colonial
dependencies of the Crown on their attaining independence, as the
result of negotiations and discussions relating to the terms on which
independence should be granted. Many of them (including that of
Trinidad and Tobago) have been amended since independence (sometimes
more than once), but they still retain strong family resemblances.’ 




 Historical
Background 

 Counsel
for both parties in this appeal analysed and compared the written and
unwritten laws which were the ancestors of the material enactments. 
I shall now briefly review the historical background of those laws. 

 Prior
to the commencement of the Police Ordinance on 13th April 1950, the
appointment (including the promotion and transfer), disciplining and
dismissal or removal of public officers (for convenience hereafter
compendiously referred to as “disciplinary powers”) were vested
in the Governor by articles XIII and XIV of the Trinidad and Tobago
Letters Patent 1924 (“the Letters Patent 1924”) and the Royal
Instructions, both of which were issued on 6th June 1924. The
Governor had to consult his nominated Executive Council; but he was
not obliged to accept its advice. 

 Disciplinary
powers were exercised by the Governor in accordance with Colonial
Regulations, which were in the nature of subsidiary legislation made
under the Letters Patent that had the force of law (see Robert Wray’s Commonwealth and Colonial Law ,
pages 239,240). Public officers were disciplined and dismissed for
breaches of conduct which were not, except in respect of subordinate
or junior officers in the protective services (police, prison and
fire officers), prescribed by or under any Ordinance. 

 The
Colonial Regulations detailed certain acts for which an officer was
liable to be disciplined; but this was not a comprehensive or
exclusive code of conduct. Officers convicted of a serious criminal
offence were dismissed; and charges were laid for other kinds of
conduct in breach of the duties owed by an employee to his employer. 
This is apparent from the form of charges set out in Russell’s Notes on Forms on Official Proceedings under the Colonial
Regulations .
 The regulations and the forms spelt out the procedure to be followed
and included provisions incorporating the rules of natural justice. 

 A
part of the Governor’s authority over subordinate officers was
exercisable by the Commissioner of Police and other gazetted officers
under the Police Ordinance, and under the Ordinance which it
replaced. 

 The
Trinidad and Tobago Letters Patent 1950, the related Royal 

 421 

 Instructions
and the Trinidad and Tobago Constitution Order in Council 1950 (“the
1950 Order”) came into operation on 31st August 1950. Articles 10
and 11 of the Letters Patent 1950 were substantially the same as
articles XIII and XIV of the Letters Patent 1924 and read: 




‘ 10.
 The Governor, in Our name and on Our behalf, may constitute such
judgeships and other offices for the colony and may make appointments
(including promotions and transfers) to any judgeship or other office
constituted for the colony, and any person so appointed shall, unless it is otherwise provided by
law, hold office during Our pleasure . 

 11.
 Subject to the provisions of any law or regulations for the time
being in force and to such instructions as may from time to time be
given to him by Us through a Secretary of State, the Governor may, upon sufficient cause to him appearing, dismiss or suspend from the exercise of his office any person holding any public office in the colony or may take such other disciplinary action as may seem to him
desirable .’ 




 From
31st August 1950 to 31st August 1962, the authority to discipline
gazetted officers continued to reside in the Governor. In its
exercise he was, until 27th September 1961, subject to the control of
the Secretary of State. He had to consult with (but was not obliged
to accept the advice tendered by) the Public Service Commission and
(later) the Police Commission. The Executive Council had no say in
this regard (clause 4 (2) of the Royal Instructions). 

 The
first Public Service Commission was established pursuant to section
64 of the 1950 Order. The Commission was to advise the Governor on
any question referred by him to the commission regarding any of his
disciplinary powers (see section 65 of the 1950 Order and section 3
of the Public Service Commission Ordinance). 

 Section
66 of the 1950 Order enabled the Governor to make regulations for
(inter alia): 




‘ ( c )
the organisation of the work of the commission and the manner in
which the commission shall perform its functions ... 

 ( g )
the definition and trial of offences connected with the functions of
the commission and the imposition of penalties for such offences. 
Provided that no such penalty shall exceed a fine of four hundred and
eighty dollars and imprisonment for a term of one year.’ 




 The
Public Service Commission Regulations (to which I shall refer as “the
1951 Regulations”) were made on 8th January 1951, and do not
specify any disciplinary offences. 

 Sections
66C to 66E of the 1950 Order as enacted by the Trinidad and Tobago
Constitution (Amendment) Order in council 1956 (“the 1956 Order”)
invested the Police Service Commission, which it created, with the
powers of the Public Service Commission in respect of gazetted
officers and inspectors, and set up police promotion boards for
officers below the rank of inspector. The new commission was
consultative to 

 422 

 the
Governor as regards the appointment of the Commissioner and deputy
Commissioner of Police and the exercise of disciplinary control over
all police officers; but the Governor had to accept the advice of the
commission in respect of appointments of other police officers. 

 Substantially
similar provisions were re-enacted in sections 66C to 66E of the 1950
Order by the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) (Amendment) Order in
Council 1959 (“the 1959 Order”) and, subsequently in sections 82
to 85 of the Constitution annexed to the Trinidad and Tobago
Constitution Order in Council 1961 (hereafter referred to as “the
1961 Constitution” and “the 1961 Order”, respectively). 

 The
Trinidad and Tobago Letters Patent 1959 substituted, for the words
“The Governor” in article 10 of the Letters Patent 1950, the
words “Subject to the provisions of any law or regulation for the
time being in force, the Governor”. 

 The
Police Commission Regulations 1961 (“the 1961 Regulations”) were
made by the Governor under section 66C(2) of the 1950 Order, as
amended by the 1959 Order, which was to the like effect as the
original section 66 of the 1950 Order. The 1951 Regulations were
revoked by the Public Service Commission Regulations 1961, which came
into operation on the same day as the 1961 Regulations (ie 6th
February 1961). 

 Provisions
similar to those contained in the Colonial Regulations for the
conduct of disciplinary proceedings were inserted in the 1961
Regulations. Different procedures were laid down for charges which,
if proved, warranted, in the opinion of the commission, dismissal and
for those which did not; and the audi alteram partem rule of natural justice was expressly provided for. 

 Penalties
were specified which might be imposed in respect of disciplinary
offences on officers subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. 
These were dismissal, reduction in rank, suspension, withholding or
deferment of increment, fine (deductible from salary), forfeiture of
seniority of rank, and reprimand. An officer absent from the
territory without leave was liable to summary dismissal. The 1961
Regulations did not prescribe any other disciplinary offences. 

 The
1961 Constitution conferred full internal self-government on Trinidad
and Tobago within the framework of the Federation of the West Indies.
 The Legislative Council was replaced by a bicameral legislature and
the Governor and the other two public officers were removed from the
legislature and the Cabinet. The Letters Patent 1950 were revoked. 

 Section
15 of the 1961 Order continued in force “existing laws”, which
was defined to mean laws enacted by any legislature established for
Trinidad and Tobago before 27th September 1961 (“the appointed
day”) and in force immediately before that day and any instrument
in force as aforesaid made in exercise of a power conferred by any
such law. Such laws were to be construed with such adaptations and
modifications 

 423 

 as
were necessary to bring them into conformity with the 1961 Order. 

 As
section 66G of the 1950 Order (under which the 1961 Regulations were
made) was not an enactment of a local legislature and therefore not
an “existing law” and since the 1961 Regulations were not
continued in force by the 1961 Order (cf section 26 of the Jamaican
Constitution Order in Council 1962), they ceased to have effect on
19th December 1961, which the 1950 Order was revoked by the 1961
Order. No regulations were made under section 86(3) of the 1961
Constitution, which reproduced section 66G of the 1950 Order. 

 It
would nevertheless appear from regulation 114 of the 1966
Regulations, which purported to revoke the 1961 Regulations, that the
latter had been treated as having continued in force. 

 The
1962 Constitution 

 We
come now to the 1962 Order and Constitution. Section 99, so far as
material, enacted: 




‘ (1)
Power to appoint persons to hold or act in offices in the Police
Force (including appointments on promotion and transfer and the
confirmation of appointments) and to remove and exercise disciplinary
control over persons holding or acting in such offices shall vest in
the Police Service Commission; 

 Provided
that the commission may, with the approval of the Prime Minister and
subject to such conditions as it may think fit delegate any of its
powers under this section to any of its members or to the
Commissioner of Police or any other officer of the Police Force.’ 




 By
section 99(2) to (5) the disciplinary powers over all police officers
were vested in the Police Commission subject to the following
qualifications: ( a )
the veto of the Prime Minister on an appointment of a Commissioner or
deputy Commissioner; ( b )
consultation with another Service Commission before the appointment
of an officer subject to the commission’s jurisdiction; and ( c )
the concurrence of the Judicial and Legal Service Commission to an
imposition of punishment on an officer for an act or omission done in
exercise of a judicial function. Section 102, so far as material,
enacted: 




‘ (1)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, a
commission to which this section applies may, with the consent of the
Prime Minister, by
regulation or otherwise ,
regulate its own procedure, (including the procedure for the
consultation with persons with whom it is required by this
Constitution to consult), and confer powers and impose duties on any
public officer or any authority of the Government of Trinidad and
Tobago for the purpose of the discharge of its functions. 

 (2)
Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by
subsection (1) of this section, a commission to which this section 

 424 

 applies
may by regulation make provision for the review of its findings in disciplinary cases .’ 




 Subsection
(3) prescribed the quorum for a meeting of the commission. 
Subsections (4) and (5) provide: 




‘ (4)
The question whether :- 

 ( a )
a commission to which this section applies has validly performed any function vested in it by or under this Constitution; 

 ( b )
any member of such a commission or any other person has validly
performed any function delegated to such member or person in
pursuance of the provision of subsection (1) of section 84, or
subsection (1) of section 93, or subsection (1) of section 99, as the
case may be, of this Constitution; or 

 ( c )
any member of such a commission or any other person has validly
performed any other function in relation to the work of the
commission or in relation to any such function as is referred to in
the preceding paragraph; 

 shall
not be enquired into in any court . 

 (5)
References in this section to a commission to which this section
applies are references to the Judicial and Legal Service Commission,
the Public Service Commission or the Police Service Commission, as
the case may be, established under this Constitution.’ 




 Section
105(5), which governed public officers in general, enlarged the power
of removal under section 99(1): 




‘ References
in this Constitution to the power to remove a public officer from his
office shall be construed as including references to any power
conferred by any law to require or permit that officer to retire from
the public service:- 

 Provided
that – ( a )
nothing in this subsection shall be construed as conferring on any
person or authority power to require a judge of the High Court or a
judge of the Court of Appeal or the Auditor-General to retire from
the public service; ... ‘ 




 Provisions
analogous to section 99 were enacted with respect to the Public
Service Commission (section 93) and the Judicial and Legal Service
Commission (section 84) with one important difference. Unlike
section 99, section 93 was prefaced by the expression “Subject to
the provisions of this Constitution”. 

 The
Trinidad and Tobago Constitution (Amendment) Act 1968 extended
section 102 to the Teaching Service Commission which it established
and enacted section 99C in terms similar to section 93. 

 A
judge of the Supreme Court, the Auditor-General and a member of a
Service Commission appointed for a fixed period could be removed from
office only for inability to perform the functions of his office (whether arising
from infirmity of mind or body or any other cause) or for
misbehaviour; and such a person (other than a member of a Service 

 425 

 Commission) was
not to be removed except after a preliminary enquiry conducted by a tribunal presided over by
a judge to determine whether the question of his removal should be
referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for decision;
and their salaries and allowances were a charge on the Consolidated
Fund and could not be adversely altered (sections 76, 80, 89 and 97;
83(3)( c );
92(6), (7); 98(6), (7); 99A(6), (7)). 

 The
1962 Order and Constitution together with the Trinidad and Tobago
Independence Act 1962 [UK] converted Trinidad and Tobago into an
independent sovereign democratic State. 

 The
most significant change in the Constitution was the insertion of
Chapter 1 which recognised and protected fundamental rights and
freedoms, included among which by section I were: 




‘ (a)
the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person
and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof
except by due process of law ; 

 ( b )
the right of the individual to equality before the law and the
protection of the law; ... 

 ( d )
the right of the individual to equality of treatment from any public
authority in the exercise of any functions; ...’ 




 Section
2 prohibited the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of
those rights and freedoms, by or under any law and particularised these rights and freedoms which it forbade any Act
of Parliament to contravene. These included the rights 




‘ ( a )
not to be deprived of a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations; ... 

 ( h )
not to be deprived of such procedural provisions as are necessary for
the purpose of giving effect and protection to the aforesaid rights
and freedoms.’ 




 By
section 105(1) “law” includes any instrument having the force of
law, and any unwritten rule of law. This embraces the 1962
Constitution. 

 The
scheme of the 1962 Constitution recognises the separation of powers. 
The divisions relate to: (a) the Executive (Chapters III and V); (b)
Parliament (Chapter IV); and (c) the Judiciary (Chapter VI (sections
73 to 83)). Finance, and the functions in relation thereto of the
Auditor- General, are governed by Chapter VII (sections 85 to 90). 
The Public Service, and the Service Commissions who exercised
jurisdiction over it, are regulated in Chapter VIII (sections 92 to
101). 

 Section
38 entrenched certain sections of the Constitution which could only
be altered by an Act passed by prescribed majorities in each House of
Parliament. It mandated that certain provisions of the Constitution
were not to be altered, except in accordance with that section. Some
of those sections required for their alteration an Act of Parliament
passed by a two-thirds majority in each House of Parliament. For the
other 

 426 

 sections
there had to be a majority of three-fourths in the House of
Representatives and two-thirds in the Senate. In the first category
fall sections 84, 90, 92 to 94, 96 and 98, 99; and in the second
sections 73 to 77, 79, 80, 83 and 89. 

 The
1966 Regulations were expressed to have been made under section 102
of the 1962 Constitution on 11th October 1966. They were amended by
Government Notices 106/1968 and 780/1969. 

 Under
the proviso to section 99 of the 1962 Constitution the Police
Commission delegated to the Commissioner of Police and other senior
gazetted officers some of its powers under section 99 and under the
1966 Regulations that were exerciseable over subordinate officers
(other than inspectors) (see Government Notice 159/1966 dated 11th
October 1966 and Government Notice 83/1969). 

 A
pattern of development and change similar to that of the Police
Commission was followed by the Public Service Commission; and by the
Judicial and Legal Service Commission (which was first established by
the 1959 Order in the re-enacted section 66 of the 1950 Order). No
regulations were, however, made by the Judicial and Legal Service
Commission. 

 I
turn to the statutes governing the disciplinary control over police
officers, and begin with the Police Ordinance. 

 Police
Ordinance. 

 The
Commissioner of Police was appointed by Her Majesty the Queen
(through the Secretary of State for the Colonies); and other gazetted
officers by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council (in
accordance with Royal Instructions; see sections 6 to 10). 
Subordinate officers (including inspectors) were appointed by the
Commissioner, subject to the provision of the Ordinance and the
Regulations made or continued in force under the Police Ordinance
(sections 11 to 13). The power to appoint included the power to
remove and to suspend (section 16 of the Interpretation Ordinance). 

 The
Police Force was an armed force for the prevention and detection of
crime and the suppression of internal disturbance (section 3(1)). 

 Part
IV (section 35 to 39) related to discipline. Section 35 specified
(criminal) offences by police officers, which were punishable on
summary conviction by fine or imprisonment. Offences by subordinate
officers which were triable by the Commissioner were set out in
sections 36 and 37(1)( a );
and those which were triable by another gazetted officer in section
37(1)( b ). 

 By
Section 37(1)(vi) a subordinate officer could have been charged for
any act, conduct, disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order
or discipline or in violation of duty in his office or any other misconduct as a member of the force .
 The punishments prescribed for such offences were dismissal (by the
Commissioner only), confinement to barracks, punishment drill,
reduction in rank or pay, fine and reprimand. The right to a hearing
and to an appeal were conferred in sections 38 and 39. 

 427 

 Section
23 empowered the Governor to make regulations (inter alia) relating
to: 




‘ ( a )
the duties to be performed by police officers and their guidance in
the discharge of such duties; 

 ( b )
the training and discipline of the force; 

 ( c )
promotion to the various ranks in the force; ... 

 ( h )
generally, for the good order and government of the force.’ 




 The
1954 Regulations, made under section 23, laid down rules of conduct
to be observed by police officers for contravening which they could
presumably be disciplined (regulations 1 to 14); and provided for the
recording of evidence and of punishments (information which was to be
available in the event of an appeal) (regulations 71 to 74). 
Disciplinary offences were to be classified as grave or minor,
according to the punishments that might be awarded (regulation 76);
and a conviction for a criminal offence was, in addition, treated as
a disciplinary offence (regulation 77). 

 Which
offences were grave and which minor (so as to attract the respective
penalties set out in sections 36 and 37 of the Police Ordinance and
in the 1954 Regulations) would appear to have been left to be
determined by the gazetted officer who presided at the trial. 

 The
1954 Regulations were amended (Government Notices 66/1962, 106/1963
and 24/1964) but none of these amendments had reference to
discipline. 

 It
is convenient here to interpolate that under similar enactments the
Chief Fire Officer and the Commissioner of Prisons exercised
disciplinary powers over subordinate fire brigade and prison officers
respectively; see the Fire Brigades Ordinance, sections 22, 25 to 28,
as amended, and the Prison (Amendment) Rules 1961, which prescribed a
code of discipline and were made under section 1 of the West Indian
Prisons Act 1838 [UK]. 

 I
will now examine the effect of the constitutional instruments on the
provisions of the Police Ordinance, including section 23, and on the
1954 Regulations. 

 Disciplinary
powers over gazetted officers, other than the Commissioner, as well
as the power to make regulations in relation to such matters under
section 23, were exercisable by the Governor on the advice of the
executive Council in compliance with Royal Instructions. 

 Section
3 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance which came into force,
after the Police Ordinance, on 29th November 1951, ordained: 




‘ Wherever
in any law for the time being in force there is any provision
affecting or relating to the appointment, promotion or transfer, or
the dismissal or other disciplinary control, of any public officer,
... and any reference is made in such provision to the Executive
Council ... such reference shall be construed as a reference 

 428 

 to
the Public Service Commission established under the authority of
section 64 of the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council
1950, and the expression ‘Governor in Council’ or ‘Governor in
Executive Council’ or any other similar expression implying action
by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council of the
colony shall, wherever used in any such provision, mean the Governor
acting with the advice of such Public Service Commission, but not
necessarily in accordance with such advice: 

 Provided
that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to impose any
obligation on the Governor to consult with the said Public Service
Commission on any such matter affecting or relating to any public
officer or the public service.’ 




 That
section adapted and modified the provisions of the Police Ordinance
to bring them into conformity with the 1950 Order. The Governor was
no longer obliged to act in accordance with the advice of the
Executive Council in exercising his disciplinary powers, but he
could, if he wished, consult the Public Service Commission; but he
did not have to accept its advice. The preamble to the Public
Service Commission Ordinance seemed to assume that the changes in the
law had already been impliedly made by the 1950 Order. 

 Section
23 of the 1959 Order enabled the Governor to make Orders modifying or
adapting existing laws so as to conform with the provisions of that
Order. No such Orders were made in respect of the Police Ordinance
or the 1954 Regulations. 

 Similar
provisions were contained in section 15 of the 1961 Order and in
section 4 of the 1962 Order, under both of which, in the absence of
any such orders, the necessary alterations to the existing laws were
implied. The courts could, and would, make these alterations in
cases coming before them (see Kanda v Government of Malaya [1962] 2 WLR 1153). 

 It
seems to me that the Public Service Commission Ordinance deprived the
Executive Council of its right to make regulations under section 23
of the Police Ordinance in so far as disciplinary powers were
involved, such powers being thereafter exerciseable by the Governor
in his discretion. 

 With
the transfer of executive powers of government from the Colonial
Office to local Ministers, the control of the public service was
taken away from the executive and, by stages, was vested in an
independent Service Commission so as to insulate public officers (as
far as practicable) from political interference. This object might
be frustrated if the grounds on which a public officer could be
disciplined were left to be determined entirely or in part, by
enactments made, not by the legislature, but by Ministers under a
section of a statute conferring on the executive general power to
make regulations. 

 Although
the relevant 1954 Regulations were made on the advice of the
Executive Council, they were not invalidated on that account, for 

 429 

 the
Governor was entitled to make them in his discretion. No further
relevant regulations were made by the Governor under section 23 

 By
the combined effect of section 15(3) of the 1961 Order and the
provisos to articles 83(1) and 84(1) of the 1961 Constitution, the
disciplinary powers of the Commissioner of Police over subordinate
officers under the Police Ordinance were preserved. 

 Section
4 of the 1962 Order impliedly divested the Governor of (and
transferred to the executive Police Commission) his disciplinary
powers; and also, in my opinion, his authority under section 23 of
the Police Ordinance to legislate in relation to the same. 

 Section
99 of the 1962 Constitution and section 4 of the 1962 Order impliedly
repealed the sections of the Police Ordinance which gave disciplinary
powers to the Commissioner of Police; but, under the proviso to
section 99, the Police Commission was allowed to delegate these
powers to the Commissioner or to any other police officer. Such
delegation were made (see above). 

 The
same result could have been achieved if the 1962 Constitution had
deemed the powers vested by the Police Ordinance in the gazetted
officers to have been delegated to them under section 99 (see Evelyn v Chichester (1970) 15 WIR 410 at page 430). 

 The
Act of 1965 (which was operative from 24th August 1966) repealed the
Police Ordinance. It is one of a fascicle of Acts relating to the
public service that were passed by Parliament in December 1965; they
were assented to on 22nd January 1966, and came into force on 27th
August 1966. The other Acts, hereafter called “the related Acts”
are the Civil Service Act 1965, the Fire Service Act 1965, the Prison
Service Act 1965, and the Education Act 1966 (which incorporated
similar provisions concerning the teaching service). 

 The
related Acts create sub-divisions of the segment of the public
service that was subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service
Commission. By Act 25 of 1968, a separate Teaching Service
Commission was established by an amendment of the 1962 Constitution. 

 The
long title to the Act of 1965 is: 




‘ An
Act to make provision for the classification of the Police Service,
to provide a procedure for the settlement of disputes between the
Government and the Police Service, to provide for matters concerning
the relationship between the Government and Police Service, to
consolidate, amend and revise the law relating to the Police Service
and for matters connected with and incidental thereto.’ 




 It
established the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, classified its
members into grades, and provided for pay and allowances to be fixed
by subordinate legislation. The Police Service consists of a First
and Second Division, comprising respectively the gazetted officers
and subordinate officers (section 6). 

 The
Governor-General was authorised to issue arms to police officers
(section 4). 

 430 

 Sections
9 to 11, under the caption “Tenure”, provide as follows: 




‘ (9)
A police officer shall hold office subject to the provisions of this Act and any other enactment and any
regulations made thereunder and unless some other period of employment is specified, for an
indeterminable period. 

 (10)
A police officer who is appointed to an office in the Police Service
for a specified period shall cease to be a police officer at the
expiration of that period. 

 (11)
A police officer may resign his office by giving such period of
notice as may be prescribed by Regulations.’ 




 Part
IV (sections 28 to 57) sets out the powers, duties, functions and
obligations of police officers. Conduct of police officers (or of
members of the public in relation to the police) which constitutes a
criminal offence is specified in sections 38 and 40. 

 On
his appointment a police officer is required by section 60 to take
the oath of office and secrecy set out in the Fifth Schedule, by
which he undertakes well and truly to serve the Sovereign in his
particular office. 

 The
heading of Part V, in which sections 61 to 65 are included, is
“General Regulations”. Sections 61 and 65 provide as follows: 




‘ 61.
 The modes by which a police officer may leave the Police Service are
as follows: ( a )
on dismissal or removal in consequence of disciplinary proceedings;
( b )
on compulsory retirement; ( c )
on voluntary retirement; ( d )
on retirement for medical reasons; ( e )
on resignation; ( f )
on the expiry or other termination of an appointment for a specified
period; and ( g )
on the abolition of office. 

 65.
 (1) The Governor-General may make regulations for carrying out or
giving effect to this Act, and in particular for the following
matters namely: ( a )
for prescribing classifications for officers in the Police Service,
including qualifications, duties and remuneration; ( b )
for prescribing the procedure for appointments from within the Police
Service; ( c )
for prescribing the probationary period on first appointment and for
the reduction of such period in appropriate cases; ( d )
for prescribing conditions for the termination of first appointments;
( e )
for prescribing the procedure for the recovery of any penalties from
a police officer; ... ( g )
for regulating the duties to be performed by police officers; ... ( j )
the enlistment, training and discipline of the Police Service; ...
( l )
for prescribing and providing for the use of powers under this Act or
the regulations; ( m )
for regulating generally the terms and conditions of temporary
employment; and ( n )
generally, for the good order and government of the Police Service.’ 




 Section
65(3) purported to continue the 1954 Regulations in operation until
regulations were made under the Act of 1965. 

 Sections
62 to 64 fix the respective ages at which First and Second Division
officers may retire voluntarily and with the approval of the 

 431 

 Police
Commission. The superannuation benefits of Second Division officers
are set out in the Sixth Schedule to the Act; and those of First
Division officers are (as previously) to be determined by and under
the Pensions Ordinance. 

 The
Police Service Regulations 1971 were made under section 65 of the
1965 Act, were published on 31st March 1971, and purported to have
been given retrospective effect to 1st January 1971. Regulations 49
to 61 relate to discipline. Some of these regulations may be
categorised as creating disciplinary offences; but they are
restricted in their scope, and do not constitute an exclusive and
comprehensive code. In any event the Regulations were promulgated
after any time material to this case. 

 An
important feature introduced into the Act of 1965 is the regulation
of the conduct of officers with respect to industrial relations. In
Parts II and III (sections 12 to 27) provision is made for
associations of police officers, when recognised by the Ministry of
Finance, to represent officers in negotiations with the Chief
Personnel Officer. Before the Personnel Department, under the Chief
Personnel Officer, submits proposals to the Ministry of Finance for
the classification of officers, grievances, remuneration or terms and
conditions of employment, he may consult, and in any event must place
such proposals before, the recognised association (section 13). 
Section 16 is in the following terms: 




‘ Where
the Department and the appropriate recognised association reach
agreement on any of the matters specified in subsection (1) of
section 12, the
agreement shall be recorded in writing and shall be signed by the Chief
Personnel Officer on behalf of the Minister of Finance and shall be binding upon the Government and the police officers to whom the agreement relates.’ 




 Should
there be a failure to agree on any matter, the dispute is referred
for compulsory arbitration to a special tribunal consisting of three
members of the Industrial Court, (sections 18, 19). This court was
established by the Industrial Stabilisation Act 1965 (since repealed
and replaced by the Industrial Relations Act 1972). 

 Section
20(1) provides as follows:- 




‘ An
award made by the special tribunal under section 19 shall
be binding on the parties to the dispute and on all police officers to whom the award relates and shall
continue to be binding for a period to be specified in the award, not
less than five years from the date upon which the award takes
effect.’ 




 Following
a spate of strikes and lock-outs, the Industrial Stabilisation Act
1965 provided for the compulsory recognition of trade unions by
employers, for legal and binding effect to be given to industrial
agreements registered with the Industrial Court; and prohibited
strikes and lock-outs, except in specified circumstances. It set up
the Industrial Court expeditiously to decide trade disputes outside
the public service. 

 By
section 37 of that Act, the right to strike was unconditionally 

 432 

 denied
to members of the Police Service, of the Prison and Fire Services and
the Defence Force. 

 Where
a worker (which excludes a public officer) is disciplined or
dismissed by his employer he has a legal right to have any dispute arising in connection therewith decided by the
Industrial Court (sections 74, 2(1) and 2(2) of the Industrial
Relations Act 1972). 

 The
law immediately before the commencement of the Act of 1965 

 Before
giving consideration to the effect, if any, that the Act of 1965 had
on any of the remits, it is convenient to state the relevant law that
obtained between the commencement of the 1962 Constitution and the
Act of 1965. 

 The
Police Commission was successor to the Police Service Commission,
which was advisory to the Governor. By section 99 of the 1962
Constitution, the disciplinary powers which the Governor exercised on
behalf of the Crown were transferred to the Police Commission (see Hinds’s case (1975) 24 WIR 326). 

 In
Jamaica and Barbados (but not in Guyana) disciplinary powers were
entrusted to the Governor-General acting on the advice of the
relevant commission (which he was bound to accept). In practice, the
legal result was the same in Trinidad and Tobago. 

 Braithwaite
J held (and it is not disputed) that police officers were dismissible at the pleasure of the Crown . 

 The
Police Commission exercised disciplinary control over gazetted
officers in the same manner as the Public Service Commission did over
public officers subject to its jurisdiction. The procedure followed
was that set out in the 1961 Regulations, which (as stated above) had
ceased to have effect. The Police Commission, or its staff under its
direction, formulated the charges for misconduct against the officer;
and these were notified by letter to the officer. If the charge was
not admitted and the proceedings were with a view to his dismissal,
the facts were found by an investigating committee appointed by the
Governor on the advice of the commission. The enquiry was conducted
in accordance with the rules of natural justice embodied in the
Regulations. The committee submitted its report (which included its
findings and its recommendations for punishment, if any) to the
commission. After considering the report, which was morally, but not
legally, binding on the commission, the commission arrived at its
decision, including the form of punishment. It would seem to follow
that the officer was not entitled as of right to the observance of
this procedure since he was dismissible at the pleasure of the Crown,
which was not obliged to give any reason for his dismissal. 

 The
discretion of the commission in exercising its disciplinary powers
under section 99 over police officers was uncontrolled (unlike the
case of the Public Service Commission which was fettered by sections
1 and 2 of the 1962 Constitution under section 93). Sections 99 and
102 were complementary to each other. The privative provisions in
section 102(4) 

 433 

 emphasised
that the officer was dismissible without cause assigned, and that he
had no vested right in the procedure laid down by the Regulations. 

 To
adapt the language of Latham CJ in Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55 at pages 71, 72 (cited later in this judgment), the
conclusion that the respondent had no right of action for wrongful
dismissal was, I think, placed beyond dispute by the provisions of
section 102(4) of the 1962 Constitution. 

 I
now turn to a consideration of the remits and, in particular, to the
reasons advanced for the radical changes in the law attributed to the
Act of 1965 by counsel for the respondent. I shall deal first with
remit (3) and then with remits (1) and (2). This was the order
followed by Braithwaite J in his judgment and by this court at the
hearing of the appeal. 

 Remit
(3): whether the respondent was a servant of the Crown dismissible at
pleasure . 

 The
argument for the respondent, which was accepted by Braithwaite J, was
that this common law right of the Crown had been abrogated by statute
in respect of all police officers. Reliance was placed on sections
9, 61 and 65 of the 1965 Act. 

 A
related question, which was not specifically raised in the pleadings
(but which was dealt with in the judgment of Braithwaite J and was
argued before this court) is whether, on the true construction of the
Interpretation Act 1962, and (more particularly) sections 3 and 7,
the Act of 1965 was at all relevant times binding on the Crown. 

 The
common law rule is that a servant of the Crown is dismissible at
pleasure. This rule may however be altered by statute. It is stated
in 8 Halsbury’s
Laws of England (4th Edn) paragraph 1106: 




‘ Except
where it is otherwise provided by statute all public officers and
servants of the Crown hold their appointments at the pleasure of the
Crown and all, in general, are subject to dismissal without cause
assigned. The courts will not entertain an action for wrongful
dismissal ... ‘ 




 This
rule was acknowledged in article XIII of the Letters Patent 1924 and
in article 10 of the Letters Patent 1950. 

 In Dunn v R [1895-9] All ER Rep 907 at page 909, Lord Herschell said: 




‘ Persons
employed in the public service of the Crown are, unless there is some
statutory provision for a higher tenure, engaged to hold office
during the pleasure of the Crown.’ 




 I
shall now review the cases which were referred to by counsel under
this remit. In Shenton v Smith [1895] AC 229 the Government of Western Australia by notice
terminated the services of the appellant (Dr Smith), a temporary
employee. In his suit against the Government for damages for breach
of contract, he alleged that the procedure set out in the 

 434 

 Colonial
Regulations for dismissal of public servants formed part of his
contract of employment and had not been followed. The Privy Council
in advising that the appellant had no cause of action, opined: 




‘ Unless
in special cases where it is otherwise provided servants of the Crown
hold their offices during the pleasure of the Crown, not by virtue of
any special prerogative of the Crown but because such are the terms
of their engagement, as is well understood throughout the public
service. If any public servant considers that he has been dismissed
unjustly, his remedy is not by a law suit, but an appeal of an
official or political kind.’ 




 With
regard to the Colonial Regulations, the Privy Council drew attention
to the fact that, as the heading thereto indicated, they were merely
for the guidance of Colonial Governments and that they did not
constitute a contract between the Crown and its servants. 

 Great
emphasis was placed by Braithwaite J and by counsel for the
respondent on Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575 which was decided shortly after Shenton v Smith .
 In that case the Privy Council held that the Civil Service Act 1884
of New South Wales (“the NSW Act”) created a statutory exception
to the common law rule which imported into a contract for service
under the Crown a condition that the Crown had the power to dismiss
at its pleasure. 

 The
NSW Act provided for the appointment, promotion, suspension and
dismissal of officers. It prescribed what conduct constituted
disciplinary offences (including negligence in the discharge of
duties) and the penalties for such offences, including dismissal,
reduction in rank or pay and fine; and for an enquiry before
disciplinary action was taken. The respondent, who was a clerk, was
summarily dismissed for incompetence and wilful disobedience of
reasonable orders, without being heard in accordance with the
procedure laid down in the Act. The Privy Council decided that he
was unlawfully dismissed. The ratio decidendi is recorded in the following passage of the judgment ([1896] AC at
page 578): 




‘ These
provisions, which are manifestly intended for the protection and benefit of the officer ,
are inconsistent with importing into the contract of service the term
that the Crown may put and end to it at its pleasure. In that case
they would be superfluous, useless, and delusive. This is, in their
Lordships’ opinion, an exceptional case, in which it has been deemed for the public good that a civil service should be established under certain regulations
with some qualification of the members of it, that some restriction
should be imposed on the power of the Crown to dismiss them.’ 




 The
question which has arisen in subsequent cases is whether the general
rule applies or whether the relevant enactment has had the effect of
altering the common law rule, and so comes within the exception 

 435 

 postulated
in Gould v Stuart .
 It is not easy to reconcile some of the cases with others. By and
large the general rule has been maintained. Clear, a unambiguous and
mandatory language has been usually required to alter the rule and
there has been a disinclination by judges to infer the necessary
intention. 

 In Reilly v R [1933] All ER Rep 179, 181 Lord Atkin declared obiter : 




‘ If
the terms of appointment definitely prescribe a term and expressly
provide for a power to determine ‘for cause’ it appears
necessarily to follow that any implication of a power to dismiss at
pleasure is excluded. This follows from the reasoning of the Board
in Gould v Stuart .’ 




 In Attorney-General v Toby (1976) 28 WIR 277, Sir Isaac Hyatali CJ, as a result of the decision
in Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575, declared that Lord Atkin’s dictum must necessarily be confined to cases where a statute provided for a
fixed term, in addition to a power to dismiss for cause. In that
same vein is the pronouncement by Lord Goddard CJ in Terrell v Secretary of State for the Colonies [1953] 2 QB 482 at page 499. 

 Sir
Isaac Hyatali CJ endorsed the statement in Robertson’s Civil Proceedings by and against the Crown (1908) page 359: 




‘ ...
the Crown’s absolute power of dismissal can only be restricted by
statute and anything short of a statute, which purports to restrict
it is void and contrary to public policy.’ 




 He
approved the following statement by Lord Diplock in Kodeeswaran v Attorney-General of Ceylon [1970] AC 1111 at page 1118: 




‘ It
is now well established in British constitutional theory, at any rate
as it has developed since the eighteenth century, that any
appointment as a Crown servant, however subordinate, is terminable at
will unless it is expressly otherwise provided by legislation.’ 




 In Ryder v Foley (1906) 4 CLR 422 and in Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55, the High Court of Australia held that a police
officer holds office during pleasure and could not maintain an action
for wrongful dismissal against the Government of the respective
States which employed them. The relevant statute in Ryder v Foley was section 6 of the Police Act 1863 [Queensland], which provided
that the Commissioner of Police had power to dismiss any constable,
upon sufficient proof of misconduct or unfitness (to be submitted for
the approval of the Government). Barton J made these pertinent
observations ((1906) 4 CLR at page 439): 




‘ Unless
there is something in this statute which authorises a difference in
the ordinary terms of employment between civil servants and the
Crown, the case is to be determined upon principles ordinarily
regulating such matters, and it is only upon clear authority on the face of the statute that the
plaintiff can be exempted from the liability to dismissal at the
pleasure of the Crown .’ 




 436 

 In
the judgment of O’Connor J (at page 449): 




‘ It
would seem very unlikely that the well-known incident of dismissal at
pleasure, which attaches to all contracts between public servants and
the Government would be so materially altered without some more formal and direct language than that which is used in the section under consideration.’ 




 In Venkata Rao v Secretary of State for India [1937] AC 248 a civil servant employed as a reader in the Government
Press sued the Crown for unlawful dismissal. He had fallen under
suspicion of leaking information relative to examination papers. No
enquiry was held, as was prescribed by the Civil Service
Classification Rules made under section 96B of the Government of
India Act. Lord Roche, who delivered the reasons for advising the
dismissal of the appeals, stated ([1937] AC at pages 256, 257): 




‘ They
regard the terms of the section as containing a statutory and solemn
assurance the the tenure of office, though at pleasure, will not be
subject to capricious or arbitrary action, but will be regulated by
rule. The provisions for appeal in the rules are made pursuant to
the principle so laid down.’ 




 In Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55, a police constable (F) sued his employers, the
Government of New South Wales, for damages for unlawful dismissal. 
His services were terminated summarily following a finding by a
judge, who was appointed as a commission of inquiry, that he had
deliberately “framed” a man for a starting-price betting offence
and had given false evidence to procure a conviction for a betting
offence. The original dismissal was by the Commissioner of Police
and this was later confirmed by the Executive Council. 

 F
alleged that he had a legal right to a hearing, under the Police
Regulations Act 1899 (“the Act of 1899”) and the rules made
thereunder; and thereafter to an appeal under the Police Regulation
(Appeals) Act 1923 (“the Act of 1923”) before he could be
lawfully dismissed. Under section 12 of the Act of 1899 the Governor
was authorised to make rules “for the general government and
discipline of members of the Police Force”. The following rules
relating to the discipline and conditions of service of officers were
made under that enactment: 




‘ Section
(iv)(1). Police are admitted to the service in accordance with the
provisions of the Police Regulations Acts and upon the following
conditions:- ... ( m )
They will be liable to punishment or dismissal for disobedience,
neglect or omission of duty, ... or any words or actions subversive
of discipline or calculated to impair the efficiency of, or bring
discredit upon the Police Service, or any misconduct punishable by
law or contrary to rules and instructions: and will also be liable to
such legal penalty as may be incurred.’ 




 437 

 Section
(ix) prescribed the procedure for enquiries and the punishments. It
provided for a written charge clearly setting out an offence and, if
the charge were denied, for the holding of a departmental enquiry to
decide whether charge was, or was not, proved. 

 The
Act of 1923 established a police appeal board to hear appeals (inter
alia) from a decision of the Commissioner of Police which involves
dismissal. The court held that these enactments were directory only,
created no legal rights and did not displace the common law rule that
F held office at the pleasure of the Crown. Latham CJ reviewed the
previous cases to which I have made reference and stated ((1960) 60
CLR at pages 68, 69): 




‘ A rule which altered the terms of the appointment of members of the force by giving them rights against the Crown which
were inconsistent with their legal position as determined by the true
construction of the statute would not be a rule merely for the government and discipline of the
force .
 Any rule which, purporting to be made under section 12, conferred
upon a member of the force a right to be employed unless his
dismissal could be justified would ,
in my opinion, be
inconsistent with the Act and would therefore be invalid . 

 Further,
it is clear that rules may be made under a statute for the purpose of
informing public servants of the manner in which the right to dismiss
will be exercised by the Crown without conferring any legal right
upon public servants to have those rules observed.’ 




 He
cited Venkata Rao’s case [1937] AC 248 as authority for the proposition: 




‘ ...
that there is no necessary inconsistency between an officer of the
Crown holding his appointment at pleasure, and the existence of
rules, either
contained in a statute or made under a statutory power, which purport
to regulate the manner in which an officer is to be dismissed .
 Such rules do not legally limit the power or manner of dismissal.’ 




 Regarding
the legal effect of the rules he said that they- 




‘ ...
do not, however, purport to confer rights upon members of the police
force. For example, the rule upon which most reliance is placed,
namely, section (iv)(1)( m ), informs
the members of the force that they will be liable to dismissal in
certain cases .
 Such a rule does not purport to create any rights. It merely informs and warns
members of the force that the power of dismissal may be exercised in
the circumstances mentioned .’ 




 These
remarks were directed primarily, against F’s dismissal by the
Executive Council (acting for the Crown). Later, however, Latham CJ
justified the initial dismissal by the Commissioner of Police (at
pages 71, 72):- 




‘ If,
however, the Commissioner himself had power to dismiss and exercised
that power, but unfairly or wrongfully, the remedy of the 

 438 

 plaintiff
is not by way of action, but by way of appeal to the police appeal
board ... 

 The
conclusion that the plaintiff has no right of action for wrongful
dismissal whether he was dismissed by the Commissioner or by the
Minister is, I think, placed beyond dispute by the provisions of
section 8 of the Police Regulation (Appeals) Act, which is as
follows: ‘Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, no
appeal from a decision, either of the appeal board, or of the Minister ...
with respect to any member of the police force shall he or be permitted to any court or tribunal whatsoever, and no
writ of prohibition or mandamus or certiorari shall lie in respect
thereof ... ‘ 

 Any
action in which a constable complains of wrongful dismissal by the
Commissioner or by the Minister must, in my opinion, be regarded as
an appeal to a court from a decision of the Commissioner or the
Minister when he has been dismissed under such a decision. Upon any
other interpretation of section 8 the provision would be quite
ineffectual. Thus
section 8 provides a further answer to the plaintiff’s claim .’ 




 Rich
J doubted whether the enactments were more than of an administrative
character for guidance of the force. In his view: 




‘ Neither
rules nor statute appear to me to be directed to the control or
restriction of the power of the executive Government.’ 




 Starke
J (at page 76) construed the legislation as an administrative scheme
for the management and discipline of the police force. Evatt J
declared (at page 78): 




‘ It
is noted that section (iv)(1)(v), dealing with conditions of service,
is mainly set out in descriptive or narrative form. Further, when
closely examined, each
condition seems rather to emphasise existing legal liabilities and
obligations rather than to describe existing rights or to confer new
rights .
 For instance, clause (1)( m )
of section (iv) states that the police are liable to punishment or
dismissal in respect of a large number of matters mentioned in the
rule. It is not possible to read clause (1)(m) as an exclusive specification
of the causes for which punishment or dismissal may be imposed . 

 Section
(ix)(10) (dealing with discipline) declares that complaints against
police officers should be committed to writing so that, if
disciplinary action is required or intended, a definite charge will
be preferred and such a procedure will be adopted as will enable the
officer charged to know what is alleged against him, and to make full
answer. But here again the rues refrain from employing language of command and strongly suggest that what is being done is to direct each person
concerned how he is to behave and conform himself, not
to give any legally enforceable right to the officer charged or to alter the contract or any part of it to which he is a party.’ 




 439 

 He
adverted to the scheme of the Act of 1923 (at page 80): 




‘ It
is plain that this Act is of fundamental importance in the good
government of the police force of New South Wales. The
scheme is that while officers are deprived of all redress before the
ordinary courts of law, they are given by way of compensation, a
right of access to an independent tribunal ,
appointed for seven years, well experienced in the exercise of
judicial power, and presumably specifically acquainted with the
administrative problems affecting the force.’ 




 In
his view the Act of 1923 was no barrier to F’s summary dismissal by
the executive and so could co-exist with the Crown’s right of
dismissal at pleasure that it enjoyed prior to the Act of 1923. 

 Ridge
v Baldwin [1963] 2 All ER 66 was a majority decision of the House of Lords. 
The chief constable of a borough questioned his dismissal by the
watch committee. By section 191(4) of the Municipal Corporations Act
1882 (“the Act of 1882”): 




‘ The
watch committee ... may at any time suspend and ... at any time
dismiss any borough constable whom they think negligent in the
discharge of his duty or otherwise unfit for the same.’ 




 The
appellant’s appointment was expressed to be subject to the Police
Act and regulations. Section 4(1) of the Police Act 1919 (“the Act
of 1919”) authorised a Secretary of State to make regulations
(inter alia) as to the conditions of service of members of the police force and enjoined the police authority to
comply with such regulations. The Police Disciplinary Regulations
made under the Act of 1919 set out in a Schedule a discipline code
detailing various offences, including discreditable conduct and
neglect of duty, that may be committed by a member of the Police
Force. 

 Lord
Reid ([1963] 2 All ER at page 71) distinguished three classes of
dismissal: (a) that of a servant by his master; (b) that of the
holder of an office held during pleasure; and (c) that of the holder
of an office when there must be something against the person to
warrant his dismissal. The chief constable came within the third
category. 

 Lord
Reid opined (at page 72) that the Act of 1882 permitted the watch
committee to take action only on the grounds of negligence and
unfitness. The officer, therefore, could not be dismissed without
being charged for such an offence in accordance with the rules of
natural justice. 

 Lord
Morris of Borth-y-Gest said (at page 100) that the powers given by
section 191 (4) of the Act of 1882 must-be exercised in accordance
with such of the regulations made under the Act of 1919 as were
applicable. The officer should have been charged for neglect of duty
specified in the discipline code. He stated obiter (at page 107) that the watch committee was exercising a
quasi-judicial function and, if there had been no regulations, it
would have been obligatory to apply the rules of natural justice. 
Lord Hodson said (at page 114): 

 440 




‘ No-one
I think disputes three features of natural justice that stand out –
(1) the right to be heard by an unbiased tribunal; (2) the right to
have notice of charges of misconduct; (3) the right to be heard in
answer to those charges.’ 




 The
House of Lords ruled that the dismissal of the chief constable was
void. 

 In Kanda v Government of Malaya [1962] AC 322, the power under article 144 of the Constitution of the
Federation of Malaya to dismiss was subject to article 135(2) which
required an officer to be afforded an opportunity of being heard. 
The failure to supply him with a copy of a report on the basis of
which he was dismissed was found to be a breach of article 135 (2)
and a denial of natural justice. 

 In Harrikissoon v Attorney-General (1977) (unreported), Rees JA ( obiter )
expressed the view that the opening words of section 99C of the 1962
Constitution placed a limitation on the power of the Teaching Service
Commission so that it could only be exercised in a manner, consistent
with section 1( a )
of the 1962 Constitution. 

 In Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation [197I] 2 All ER 1278 the appellant was a certified school teacher
employed by the respondent school board which was an education
authority. An 1882 Act, under which he was appointed, declared that
his appointment should be during the pleasure of the respondent. It
also decreed that: 




‘ No
resolution of the education authority for the dismissal from the
service of a [certified teacher] shall be valid unless written notice
of the motion for his dismissal shall, not less than three weeks
before the meeting at which the resolution is adopted, have been sent
to the teacher and to each member of the education authority.’ 




 The
Act proclaimed that its purposes was to secure that no (certificated)
teacher appointed and holding office should be dismissed from such
office without due notice to the teacher and due deliberation on the
part of the school board. This provision was not complied with and
the appellant was not given a hearing before the dismissal took
effect. Three of the five Law Lords who heard the appeal inferred
that the object of giving the teacher notice was to afford him an
opportunity to prepare his defence, and ruled that he was entitled to
be heard in accordance with the rules of natural justice. Lord
Wilberforce stated (at page 1296) that the legislature intended to
preserve the status of the teacher as one holding office only to be
dismissed after due process .
 The purported dismissal of the appellant was declared to be a
nullity. 

 In Cameron v Attorney-General (1971) (unreported) McMillan J, applying Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575, held that sections 6 and 12 of the Civil Service Act
1965 and regulation 50 of the Public Service Commission Regulations
1966 (“the PSC Regulations”), which is the counterpart of
regulation 46( a )
of the 1966 Regulations, and the procedure for disciplinary action
provided in Chapter VIII (regulations 

 441 

 84
to 114) were manifestly for the benefit of civil servants and limited
rhe Crown’s common law right to dismiss at pleasure. He said: 




‘ Whatever
may have been the absolute power of the Crown with regard to the
termination of the service of the public officer prior to 31st August
1962, that power as well as the power to exercise disciplinary
control falls, since 31st August 1962, to be exercised by the Public
Service Commission in the manner provided by the Civil Service Act
1965, and the Public Service [ sic ]
Regulations 1966.’ 




 In
that case a public officer was transferred in disregard of regulation
29 of the PSC Regulations which required three months’ notice of
the intended transfer to be given to him, within which time he could
apply to the Public Service Commission to have the transfer decision
reviewed. The officer refused to comply with the order of transfer
and was suspended, pending the hearing of a disciplinary charge for
non- compliance with the order. McMillan J ruled that the transfer
and suspension were nullities. The only case cited in the judgment
was Gould v Stuart . 

 I
now direct my attention to the question: whether
the Act of 1965 is binding on the Crown .
 Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1962 (“the Act of 1962”),
which came into force on 19th July 1962, provides: 




‘ No
enactment passed or made after the commencement of this Act binds or
affects in any manner Her Majesty or Her Majesty’s rights or
prerogatives unless it is expressly stated therein that Her Majesty
is bound thereby.’ 




 Section
60 of, and paragraph 1(4) of the Schedule to, the Act of 1962
continued to apply to enactments passed before 19th July 1962, the
rule previously contained in section 37 of the Interpretation
Ordinance, which the Act of 1962 repealed. Paragraph 1(4) reads: 




‘ No
enactment passed before the commencement of this Act shall in any
manner whatsoever affect the rights of the Crown unless it is therein
expressly provided or unless it appears by necessary implication that
the Crown is bound thereby.’ 




 The
reason for both rules is that the laws are prima facie made by the
Crown with the assent of Parliament for subjects and not for the
Crown. Braithwaite J said that words other than “This Act binds
the Crown” could be employed to achieve the same purpose. I agree. 

 In
his opinion the long title to, and section 61( a )
of, the Act of 1965 were clear-cut and unambiguous provisions by
which the Act binds the Crown. The long title is part of the Act and
contains a general statement of the legislative purpose. Where there
is ambiguity, the courts may look at the long title for the purpose
of interpreting the Act as a whole and ascertaining its scope as an
aid to resolving the difficulty. It may not be looked at to modify
the interpretation of plain language; Vacher
v London Society of Compositors [1913] AC 107 at page 128, R
v Bates [1952] 2 

 442 

 All
ER 842 at page 844 and Re Sykes (dec’d) [1961] 1 Ch 229 at page 242. 

 Braithwaite
J went on to say that the Act of 1965 could not be binding on the
Crown, unless it also was binding on police officers; and that, if
the Crown was bound by any provision of the Act, it was bound by all.
 He was clearly wrong. An agent or servant of the Crown can take
advantage of a statute which is not binding on the Crown. See the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act 1966, section 33(1), which reads: 




‘ This
Act shall not prejudice the right of the Crown to take advantage of
the provisions of an enactment although not named therein.’ 




 Section
7 of the Act of 1962 re-enacts the original common law rule to which
there was later engrafted the exception, which together is now the
common law rule in England, as applied in Cooper v Hawkins [1904] 2 KB 164. 

 In Town Investments Ltd v Department of the Environment [1976] 3 All ER 479 at page 489 Lawton LJ stated: 




‘ I
will examine the constitutional position shortly. From the 18th
century onwards it has been commonly believed amongst lawyers, first
that an Act did not apply to the Crown unless there was an express provision in it to that effect and, secondly, that it can take the benefit of
any statute although not specifically named in it: see Blackstone’s Commentaries .
 19th century textbook writers followed Blackstone :
see Stephen’s Commentaries .
 The courts did the same: see R v Cruise [1852] Ir Ch R 65 and Attorney-General v Tomline (1879) 15 Ch D 150.’ 




 Speaking
for the Privy Council in Province of Bombay v Municipal Corporation of Bombay [1947] AC 58 at page 61 Lord du Parcq recounted: 




‘ The
maxim of law in early times was that no statute bound the Crown
unless the Crown was expressly named therein ... But the rule so laid down is subject to at least one exception .
 The Crown may be bound, as has often been said, ‘by necessary
implication’. If, that is to say, it is manifest from the very
terms of the statute, that it was the intention of the legislature
that the Crown should be bound, then the result is the same as if the
Crown had been expressly named. It must then be inferred that the
Crown, by assenting to the law, agreed to be bound by its
provisions.’ 




 Section
7 of the Act of 1965 abolished the above exception. 

 At
the hearing before this court counsel for the respondent invoked the
aid of section 3(1) of the Act of 1962. Section 3 reads: 




‘ (1)
Every provision of this Act extends and applies to every enactment
passed or made before or after the commencement of this Act, unless
a contrary intention appears in this Act or the enactment .’ 

 (2)
The provisions of this Act apply to this Act as they apply to an
enactment passed after the commencement of this Act.’ 




 In Attorney-General v Toby (1976) 28 WIR 277 the submission was 

 443 

 made
that the power to dismiss at pleasure had been eliminated by the
Civil Service Act 1965 and the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
1966 Sir Isaac Hyatali CJ pointed out ( obiter )
that neither Act had complied with section 7 of the Act of 1962. He
compared section 69 of the Housing Act 1962 and section 36 of the
Petroleum Act 1969, which reads “This Act binds the Crown”. See
also section 87 of the Industrial Relations Act 1972. It would seem
that the court’s attention was not drawn to section 3(1) of the Act
of 1962. 

 Enactments
corresponding to sections 3(1) and 7 of the Act of 1962 are to be
found in the Interpretation (Northern Ireland) Act 1954, sections
2(1) and 7, the Interpretation Act [Canada], sections 3(1) and 16,
and the Interpretation Act [B], sections 3(1) and 10(3). Section 16
of the Canadian Act was re-enacted in 1967-68 to read: 




‘ No
enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her Majesty’s rights
or prerogatives in any manner except only as therein mentioned or
referred to.’ 




 The
earlier section 16 was construed by the Privy Council in Re Silver Bros Ltd, Attorney-General for Quebec v Attorney-General
for Canada [1932] AC 514. The material facts and the decision are summarised in
the headnote: 




‘ By
section 17 of the (Dominion) Special War Revenue Act 1915 ...
liability to the Crown for the excise taxes thereby imposed was to
rank for payment in priority to all other claims of whatsoever kind
save administration expenses. By section 1357 of the Revised
Statutes of Quebec 1909, all sums due to the Crown in respect of
provincial taxes are to constitute a privileged debt ranking after
law costs. By section 16 of the Interpretation Act (Revised Statutes
of Canada 1906, c 1) no provision in any Act is to affect the Crown
unless it is expressly stated therein that the Crown is to be bound
thereby. 

 In
a bankruptcy in the Province of Quebec the assets were insufficient
to discharge both a sum due for tax under the Dominion statute above
mentioned and a sum due for Provincial taxes. 

 Held ,
that it would have been competent for the Parliament of Canada under
the British North America Act 1867, section 91, head 21 (bankruptcy),
or head 3 (taxation), to enact the statute of 1915 so as to prejudice
the rights of the Province, but that having regard to section 16 of
the Interpretation Act the statute had to be read as though it
provided that the priority enacted should not operate so as to
diminish any right of the Crown in any Province; the result was that
the two debts would run pari passu as claimed by the Province.’ 




 Viscount
Dunedin made these pertinent observations (at page 523): 




‘ Now,
first of all, the Interpretation Act is a general Act meant to apply
to all future as well as to all present legislation, and their Lordships doubt whether it could be excluded except by special
reference. 

 444 

 It
is perhaps right here to mention the method in which the learned
trial judge got rid of the effect of section 16, though it was not
adopted by any of the judges who formed the majority in the Supreme
Court. He says that section 17 is in a later statute than section
16, and therefore, in view of the maxim posteriora prioribus derogant section 16 must give way. But this entirely misses the point that
the maxim only applies when the two statutes cannot live together. 
There is no difficulty in the statute that enacts section 17 living
with the Interpretation Act. The clause of the Interpretation Act
is, so to speak, written into every statute. Thus the later statute
gives perfectly good priority against all and sundry, but says that
this priority does not affect the Crown’s right in the Province. 

 Next
it was said that inasmuch as the Bank Act and Bankruptcy Act not only
deal with preferences, but (inter alia) with Crown preferences, there
is an ‘irresistible implication’ that the Act was meant to deal
with all Crown preferences. The simple answer to this is to fix
one’s eyes on section 16, and
it becomes apparent that it is a contradiction in terms to hold that
an express statement can be found in an ‘irresistible
implication ’.’ 




 And,
at page 524: 




‘ The
effect of section 16 is so to speak, to add to the words of section
17, ‘but this priority shall not operate against any right in the
Crown in a Province, where such right would be diminished by the
priority being asserted against it.’ 




 Our
attention was drawn to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act 1966,
in which there is no section expressly stating that the Act binds the
Crown. This may have been accidental or it may have been considered
unnecessary, having regard to the fact that almost every section
names the Crown as being liable. 

 In Craies on Statute Law (7th Edn) page 222, under the caption “General and Specific
Enactments: construction if repugnant”, it is stated: 




‘ Acts
of Parliament sometimes contain general enactments relating to the
whole subject-matter of the statute, and also specific and particular
enactments relating to certain special matters; and if the general
and specific enactments prove to be in any way repugnant to one
another, the question will arise, which is to control the other? In Pretty v Solly (1859) 26 Beav 606 Romilly MR stated as follows what he considered to
be the rule of construction under such circumstances. ‘The general
rules’ said he ‘which are applicable to particular and general
enactments in statutes are very clear; the only difficulty is in
their application. The rule is, that whenever there is a particular enactment and a general
enactment in the same statute, and the latter, taken in its most
comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the particular
enactment 

 445 

 must
be operative, and general enactment must be taken to affect only the
other parts of the statute to which it may properly apply ’.’ 




 It
follows that the general provision in section 3 must give way to the
special one in section 7, so that the former operates on all sections
of the Act of 1962 except section 7. 

 The
same provisions in the Act of 1965 are relied on for it to bind the
Crown and also to change the tenure of office of a police officer so
that he becomes dismissible only for cause. In both instances the
reason given is that the purpose of the Act was the public good . 

 It
was at one time considered to be the law that, if an Act was passed
for the public good, it automatically bound the Crown by necessary
implication. This was the reason given in Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575 for holding that the Act in question had altered the
common law rule as to the tenure of office of the public servants. 
The Privy Council modified that rule in Province of Bombay case [1947] AC 58 at page 63, per Lord du Parcq: 




‘ Their
Lordships prefer to say that the apparent purpose of the statute is one element ,
and may be an important element, to be considered when an intention
to bind the Crown is alleged. If it can be affirmed that, at the
time when the statute was passed and received the royal sanction, it
was apparent from its terms that its beneficient purpose must be wholly frustrated unless the Crown were bound then it may be inferred that the Crown
has agreed to be bound. Their Lordships will add that when the court
is asked to draw this inference, it
must always be remembered that, if it be the intention of the
legislature that the Crown shall be bound, nothing is easier than to
say so in plain words .’ 




 By
virtue of section 3(1) and (2), section 7 applies to the
Interpretation Act 1962, and extends and applies to every enactment
passed after 19th July 1962, including the Act of 1965. This view is
acknowledged in section 9 which mandated: 




‘ This
Act binds the Crown to the full extent authorised or permitted by the
constitutional laws of Trinidad and Tobago.’ 




 Moreover,
on reading section 7 with paragraph 1( a )
of the Schedule to the Act of 1962, it is manifest that the
legislature intended to alter the statutory rule in section 37 of the
repealed Interpretation Ordinance by applying to future enactments
the original common law rule and by continuing the statutory rule in
respect of past enactments only. 

 In
this regard I endorse the view of the author of a commentary on the
Interpretation (Northern Ireland) Act 1954 in the June 1965 issue of
the Northern Ireland Law Quarterly ,
Vol 16, No 2, page 218: 




‘ Whatever
its other effect may be, section 7 has undoubtedly resulted in it
being much easier to determine the extent to which the Crown is bound
by an Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. In relation to such
an Act the lawyer is no longer plagued by the doctrine of necessary 

 446 

 implication which can cause so much trouble across the channel or even in the
Republic.’ 




 In
my judgment, an Act or any provision thereof passed after 19th July
1962 is binding on the Crown only if it expressly so provides or if
the Crown is expressly named therein. 

 If
I am wrong, and the principle of necessary implication still applies,
I would hold that, on a reading of the Act of 1965, as a whole, and
in particular the sections relied on for the respondent, Parliament
has not clearly manifested its intention to bind the Crown. 

 Even
if the inference can properly be drawn that the Act was passed for
the benefit of police officers and therefore the public good, it is
not conclusive. That is a fact, although an important one, to be
taken into account in deciding whether the Act is binding on the
Crown by implication. 

 It
is possible for certain provisions only of the Act to be binding,
such as sections 16 and 20 (cited above) where the Government is
expressly or impliedly mentioned. 

 The
Act of 1965 may readily be distinguished from the material enactment
in Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575. 

 The
Act of 1965 is not a comprehensive code for police officers. The
most important, if not the sole aspects, of discipline, namely
disciplinary powers, are embodied in the Constitution that is the
supreme law of the land, in which there is no express provision
restricting their exercise. 

 In Gould v Stuart all the relevant matters, including the offences justifying
dismissal, are set out in the statute which confers the powers to
discipline and to dismiss. The offences are not left, as in the Act
of 1965, to be provided for in future by regulations which are made
under a general enabling power in the Act, and which are subject to
change without reference to Parliament. Such rules, if and when
made, could not create rights or alter the terms of appointment of a
police officer. They merely inform or warn officers that the powers
of dismissal may be exercisable in the circumstances mentioned; see Venkata Rao’s case [1937] AC 248 and Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55, per Latham CJ. 

 Section
9 states that it is subject to other enactments, which must include
the 1962 Constitution. Section 61 indicates the modes in which a
police officer may leave the service, not those by which the Crown
may terminate an officer’s service. Nor does it state that they
are the only modes and that there are no others. Compare section
76(3) and section 98(6) and (7) of the 1962 Constitution; also
regulation 46( a )
of the 1966 Regulations, which declares that the service of a police
officer holding a permanent office may be terminated only for one of seven reasons stated therein, including “dismissal or
removal in consequence of disciplinary proceedings”. It has not
been suggested that regulation 46( a )
made under section 102 of the 1962 Constitution did, or could, have
the effect contended for the Act of 1965. Apart from the liability
to be removed without cause assigned by the Police Commission, which
it 

 447 

 would
be otiose to repeat in an Act, the modes enumerated in section 61 are
a restatement and consolidation of the pre-existing law; but
excluding retirement in the public interest, which is listed in
regulation 46( a ).
 Section 61 adds no new condition of service to the tenure of office,
and creates no new rights. 

 Sections
62 to 64 reproduce substantially the statutory provisions in the
Police Ordinance and in the Pensions Ordinance. 

 The
long title takes the matter no further by recording the self-evident
fact that it provides for matters concerning the relationship between
the Government and the Police Service. As a statement of legislative
purpose it falls short of the more explicit terms used in the Malloch case [1971] 2 All ER 1278. 

 The
Act of 1965 does not employ the “formal and direct language” or
“the language of command” envisaged respectively by Barton J in Ryder v Foley (1906) 4 CLR 422 and by Evatt J in Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55. 

 It
is a fundamental rule of the common law that a public servant is
dismissible at the pleasure of the Crown. The manner in which such a
law may be altered is described in Craies on Statute Law (7th Edn) pages 339, 340: 




‘ There
is no presumption that a statute is intended to override the common
law. In fact the presumption, if any, is the other way, for the
‘general rule’ in exposition is this, that in all doubtful
matters, and where the expression is in general terms, the words are
to receive such a construction as may be agreeable to the rules of
common law in cases of that nature, for statutes are not presumed to
make any alteration in the common law further or otherwise than the
Act does expressly declare. It is a well-established principle of
construction that a statute is not to be taken as effecting a
fundamental alteration in the general law unless it uses words that
point unmistakably to that conclusion. And if, as Coleridge J said
in R v Scott (1856) 25 LJMC 128, there is ‘seeming conflict between the common
law and the provisions of a statute,’ it is not right to begin ‘by
assuming at once that there is a real conflict and sacrificing the
common law’; we ought rather to proceed in the first place ‘by
carefully examining whether the two may not be reconciled, and full
effect given to both.’ ‘It is a sound rule,’ said Byles in R v Morris (1867) LR 1 CCR 90, ‘to construe a statute in conformity with the
common law rather than against it, except where and so far as the
statute is plainly intended to alter the course of the common law.’ 




 Even
if I am again mistaken and the provisions of the Act bind the Crown,
and a police officer’s services may be terminated only in the modes
set out in section 61, the clear intention cannot be inferred that,
in the disciplinary proceedings referred to in section 61(1)( j ),
an officer can be disciplined only on charges prescribed by
regulations made under section 65. He could (for example) be
disciplined, and if appropriate dismissed, for misconduct not
designated as a disciplinary offence in the 

 448 

 regulations,
such as a disclosure to unauthorised persons of information that may
adversely affect the security of the State. 

 In
my judgment the Act of 1965 did not abrogate the right of the Crown
to dismiss an Assistant Superintendent (or any other police officer)
at pleasure. These are my reasons. The powers to discipline and to
dismiss or remove a police officer from the service are conferred by
implication in section 99 of the 1962 Constitution (see Hinds’s case (1975) 24 WIR 326). Those powers are not controlled or
restricted either in section 99 or in any other section of the 1962
Constitution. Where it is intended to curb the disciplinary powers
in respect of any person or authority there are specific provisions
in plain and mandatory words; as, in regard to judges of the Supreme
Court, the Auditor-General and members of the Service Commissions. 
There is no such provision in the Act of 1965. 

 A
statute creating an exception to the common law rule, which is
impliedly entrenched under section 99, must be competent to alter
that section and be passed in the manner and form prescribed by
section 38 of the 1962 Constitution. The Act of 1965 was not so
passed. 

 The
Act of 1965 does not contain an express provision that it is binding
on the Crown. No section relied on, either singly or in connection
with another such section, mentions the Crown or is capable of the
sole interpretation that it is intended to bind the Crown by
necessary implication or that the relevant section is, or sections
are, not to be unilaterally binding on the police officer. 

 My
answer to the question in remit 3 is that the respondent was at the
relevant times dismissible at the pleasure of the Crown. 

 Remit
(1): whether the three offences with which the respondent was charged
were validly and properly created by the 1966 Regulations under
section 102 of the Constitution and existed in law at any material
time. 

 The
respondent’s stand on this issue is a denial that the Police
Commission ever had the right to create disciplinary offences and
that such a right could only be exercised by or under a statute. 
This had been done by section 23 of the Police Ordinance and the 1954
Regulations, which were continued in existence by the Act of 1965. 
Section 65(1)( j )
of the Act of 1965 (which replaced section 23) was, he contended, now
the only authority under which offences could be prescribed by
regulations. 

 This
remit was raised in paragraph 11 of the statement of claim in which
it was alleged that: 




‘ The
three said offences with which the [respondent] was charged and of
which he was convicted were purportedly created by the Regulations
which were expressly made by the commission with the consent of the
Prime Minister under the provisions of section 102 of the
Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago. At all material times the three said offences did not exist in law ,
the purported creation of them by the Regulations being ultra vires the Trinidad and Tobago (Constitution) 

 449 

 Order
in Council 1962, void and of no effect, as the power to create
offences for which public officers and/or members of the Police
Service are triable resides in the Governor-General only by virtue of
section 13 of the said Order and must be exercised in the manner
therein prescribed.’ 




 Issue
was joined on these contentions in paragraph 5 of the defence. 

 The
offences referred to in paragraph 11 are specified in paragraph 4 of
the statement of claim and are contraventions of regulation 74(2)( d )
and (1)( a )
of the 1966 Regulations. Under regulation 74 a police officer
commits an offence against discipline and is liable to such
punishment as is prescribed by regulation 101, or by any other
regulation, if: 




‘ (1)
Without reasonable excuse he does an act which:- ( a )
amounts to failure to perform in a proper manner any duty imposed
upon him as a police officer ... 

 (2)
he is guilty of:- ... ( d )
neglect of duty that is to say ... [sub-paragraphs (i) to (ix)
listing the types of neglect of duty follows.] 




 This
court was not informed of the category of neglect of duty enumerated
in regulation 74(2)( d )
under which the charge was laid, nor the particulars of either
charge. 

 In
paragraph 4 of the statement of claim it is alleged that particulars
of the offences were supplied to the respondent by a letter dated
10th September 1970. It must, however, be assumed for the purposes
of these proceedings that, if the respondent was lawfully charged for
the misconduct alleged, he was properly “convicted”; and that the
facts proved warranted the punishment imposed. 

 The
date(s) of the alleged contraventions of the regulations is not
disclosed in the record of appeal; but it is apparent from the
statement of claim that it was prior to 29th August 1970, the date of
the, letter interdicting the respondent from the performance of his
duties. 

 Braithwaite
J considered that the precise details of the offences were not
relevant for the purpose of the determination. 

 The
respondent’s appointment was initially terminated under regulation
101 of the 1966 Regulations. On the advice of the review board
constituted under section 102(2) of the 1962 Constitution, that
penalty was varied to one of retirement in the public interest in
accordance with regulation 99. 

 Regulation
101 specified the penalties that the Police Commission may impose in
disciplinary proceedings brought against police officers in respect
of an offence. In addition to dismissal, the less severe penalties
are a reduction in office or of remuneration, the deferment or
stoppage of an increment, a fine deductible from pay, and a
reprimand. Regulation 99 provides: 




‘ Where
on consideration of the report of the disciplinary tribunal, the
commission is of the opinion that the police officer does not deserve
to be dismissed by reason of the charges alleged but that the 

 450 

 proceedings
disclose other grounds for removing him from the Police Service in the public interest ,
the commission may make an order for the removal of such police
officer without recourse to the procedure prescribed by regulation
49.’ 




 Reproduced
below is regulation 49(3): 




‘ If
the commission, after considering representations, if any, made by
the police officer, is of the opinion that, having regard to all the
circumstances of the case, the police officer should be retired in
the public interest, the commission shall require the police officer
to retire on such date as the commission shall determine, and the
police officer shall be retired accordingly.’ 




 See
also section 105(5) of the 1962 Constitution cited earlier in this
judgment. 

 Where
an officer’s service is terminated in the public interest he
qualifies for a pension, gratuity or other allowance under section
12(3) of the Pensions Ordinance, as amended by Act 1 of 1954, and
applied to police officers in the First Division by section 63 of the
Act of 1965. 

 It
is convenient here to dispose of the allegations with regard to
section 13 of the 1962 Order made in paragraph 11 of the statement of
claim.Section 13 provided: 




‘ The
Governor-General may by Order at any time within twelve months after
the commencement of this Order make provisions for the definition and
trial of offences connected with the functions of any commission
established by the Constitution and the imposition of penalties for
such offences.’ 




 The
date of commencement of the 1962 Order was 1st August 1962. 

 It
was decided by Braithwaite J that section 13 enabled the Governor-
General to create criminal offences that hindered the performance of
the functions of the commission and did not authorise him to create
offences or charges of a disciplinary nature against persons subject
to the jurisdiction of the commission. This assumption is reflected
in regulation 8 of the 1951 Regulations and in regulations 11 to 14
of the 1961 Regulations. These were made respectively under section
66( g )
and its re-enactment as section 66G(2)( f )
of the 1950 Order which were worded similarly to section 13 of the
1962 Order. 

 In
my event no regulations were issued under section 13, which has now
lapsed by effluxion of time. 

 That
determination, with which I am in agreement, has not been contested
by the respondent. 

 On
this remit, Braithwaite J summarised his findings as follows: 




‘ In
full answer to Maharaj J’s question, I am of the opinion: (a) that
only the Governor-General acting under the provisions of section 65
of the Act or under the provisions of the former Police Ordinance has
the power to create disciplinary offences in respect of police
officers; 

 451 

 and
(b) that all regulations purported to have been made under section
102 of the Constitution under which the [respondent] was supposedly
charged are void, null and of no effect.’ 




 In
elaboration of finding (b), he held that section 102(1), read with
section 99, of the 1962 Constitution only enabled the Police
Commission to regulate its procedure and did not permit it to create
disciplinary offences or charges. 

 I
do not concur in finding (b), which is too extensive in its scope. I
hold that section 102 of the 1962 Constitution does not enable the
Police Commission to enact regulation 74. The historical narrative
reveals that, in practice, the Governor prescribed (by regulations
made under statute) disciplinary offences (and the punishments
therefor) in respect of subordinate officers only .
 Charges against gazetted officers were formulated by or on behalf of
the Governor in pursuance of his authorisation under the Letters
Patent and Colonial Regulations, from the wording of which it is
clear that the causes for dismissal or for other disciplinary action
were eventually within his uncontrolled discretion. See, for
example, Re
Sarran’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 361 at page 362 and Re Langhorne’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 353 at page 355. 

 The
plenitude of the Governor’s power in this regard was transferred or
delegated to the executive Police Commission by sections 99 and 102
of the 1962 Constitution. To adopt the language of Lord Diplock in Hinds’s case (1975) 24 WIR 326, those sections provided continuity of
Government through (inter alia) the Police Commission as a successor
executive institution which was to exercise power of a similar
character to those exercised by the institution it replaced. Because
of this a great deal can be left to implication. 

 That
answers the contention of counsel for the respondent that the right
to prescribe offences must be expressly given. 

 This
approach is consonant with the rule of construction that the grant of
powers in an enabling Act to a public body confers, by necessary
implication, incidental powers to carry out the purpose in view. In
dealing with that rule, which is set out in Craies on Statute Law (7th Edn) page 258, the author begins by describing it in the context
of- 




‘ Statutes
which had been passed to enable something to be done which was
previously forbidden or not distinctly authorised by law without
prescribing the way in which it is to be done.’ 




 In
my opinion it is essential to the proper exercise of its disciplinary
powers that the Police Commission should have the power to specify
the grounds on which such function may be exercised. To borrow a
phrase from the judgment of the Privy Council in Doyle v Falconer (1866) 6 ER 293 at page 300, “it was an incident sine quo res esse non potest ”. 

 It
was the contention of counsel for the respondent that the creation of
disciplinary offences is a legislative, and not an administrative,
function and can only be effected by or under a statute. In this
connection he referred to de Smith’s Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3rd 

 452 

 Edn)
Chapter 2 on the classification of functions, and drew particular
attention to this definition at page 60: “a legislative act is the
creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without
reference to particular cases”. And also to the decision of Achong
J in Civil Service Association v Public Service Commission (1970) (unreported) in which he said ( obiter )
that in purporting to publish the Public Service Commission
Regulations 1966 (which are in pari materia to the 1966 Regulations) the Public Service Commission was not acting
in the performance of any of the functions vested in it. 

 Braithwaite
J expressed the view that the Police Commission was a tribunal
performing judicial functions; that disciplinary offences and the
penalties therefore were analogous to criminal offences and the
punishments for crime; and that such offences and penalties could
only therefore be prescribed by Act of Parliament. 

 I
have derived much assistance from R v White, ex parte Byrnes (1964) 109 CLR 665, a case not referred to by either counsel. It was
a decision of a full court of five judges of the High Court of
Australia presided over by Dixon CJ Sir Douglas Menzies, who had been
a member of that court, cited that case in delivering the judgment of
the Judicial Committee on appeal from the Supreme Court of Ceylon in Kariapper v Wijesinha [1967] 3 All ER 485 at pages 491, 492. 

 The
facts in White’s case were as follows. B, a public officer, was charged by the chief
officer of his department pursuant to section 55 of the Public
Service Act and regulation 58 of the Public Service Regulations for
the offence of wilfully disobeying a lawful order to attend a medical
examination made by the chief officer under section 26 of the Act. 
The chief officer found that the charge was sustained and fined B £3.
 The appeal board (before which B was represented by counsel) upheld
that decision. B maintained that the chief officer in imposing the
fine and the appeal board in upholding his decision were purporting
to ‘exercise functions which were “judicial” within the meaning
of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. Rejecting this
contention, the High Court of Australia (at page 670) declared: 




‘ We
think that the so-called fine is nothing but a mulct to be deducted from salary or pay and we think
that the provisions of section 55, in spite of the heading of
Division 6 ‘ Offences ’,
should be interpreted as wholly concerned with breaches of discipline and disciplinary measures concerned only with the service. Division 6 is, of course, limited
to the service and we are not here dealing with a law having general
operation over all the members of the community. We are dealing with
the regulation of what is, no doubt, a very large body of people with
respect to their work for and their relations with the Commonwealth
Crown. The expressions used in subsection (1) of section 55 relate
of course to conduct which is treated as open to considerable
objection on what may be service grounds but it should be kept
steadily in mind that the so-called punishment must be 

 453 

 determined
by officers acting under the provisions of the subsequent subsections
of section 55. Again, when paragraph ( d )
of subsection (3) is examined, it is seen that no inconsiderable
portion of the disciplinary measures which it authorises relates
simply to status, conditions or other relations in the service ... 

 As
has already appeared, we think that Division 6 of Part III of the Act
relating to offences is part of the law regulating the relationship
between the Commonwealth and its servants; it is a law with very
special application. Section
55, in creating so-called ‘offences’ and providing for their
‘punishment’, does no more than define what is misconduct on the
part of a public servant warranting disciplinary action on behalf of
the Commonwealth and the disciplinary penalties that may be imposed
or recommended for such misconduct; it does not create offences
punishable as crimes .
 The formalities prescribed in sections 55, subsections (3), (5) and
(7), and 57, 58 and 60 (which counsel for the applicant described as
‘judicial trappings’) are directed to safeguarding public
servants from possible official injustice in the determinations
whether there has been departure from the ‘ code ’
established by section 55(1) and, if so, what punishment should be
imposed. The establishment of these safeguards does not indicate that an officer
whose conduct is being investigated is being tried for a criminal
offence; indeed in the Act a clear distinction is drawn between
criminal offences committed by public servants (section 62) and
breaches of the disciplinary code established by section 55(1). The foregoing considerations point
clearly enough to the conclusion that neither a chief officer nor an
appeal board, in performing the duties imposed by Division 6, sits as
a court of law exercising judicial power; each sits as an administrative tribunal maintaining the discipline of the Commonwealth Service in the manner
prescribed by law.’ 




 [emphasis
supplied] 

 The
conclusion reached by the court was that the provisions under which
the applicant had been dealt with were not an attempt to confer a
part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth upon either the chief
officer or the appeal board. 

 Also
apposite is the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal of England in R v Board of Visitors of Hull Prison, ex parte St Germain [1979] QB 425. The board of visitors constituted under the Prison
Act 1952 punished the appellant for offences against discipline that
were set out in rules made by the Secretary of State under a section
of the Act enabling him to make rules for the discipline and control
of persons detained in prisons. The sections mandated that the rules
make provision for ensuring that a person charged with any offence
under the rules shall be given a proper opportunity of presenting his
case. The rules stated that the prisoner should be informed of the
charge and should be heard and allowed to present his defence. The
appellants applied, unsuccessfully, to the Divisional Court ( R
v Board of Visitors of Hull Prison, ex parte St Germain [1978] 2 WLR 598) for an order of certiorari to quash the board’s 

 454 

 adjudication
on the ground that the appellants were not allowed to cross- examine
the witnesses or to call witnesses of their own. 

 For
the purpose of deciding whether the appeal was properly before them
the Court of Appeal ruled that the judgment appealed from was not in
“a criminal cause or matter”- 




‘ Because
in the rules the offences were specifically described as ‘offences
against discipline’ they could be treated as other than ‘offences against the public law’ .’ 




 Megaw
LJ also observed: 




‘ The
issue of law which the court, having the jurisdiction, thus had to
decide, arose out of a special ‘private law’ code of discipline
which related to a particular and limited class of persons and in
respect of which special considerations applied. Thus the warning
signals were hoisted against any ready and uncritical assumption that
principles which applied generally in other spheres could, or ought
necessarily to, be applied in the present sphere without regard to
possible modifications.’ 




 To
adopt and adapt the language of the High Court of Australia in White’s case, regulation 74, in creating so-called “offences” and
providing for their punishment does no more than define what is
misconduct on the part of a police officer warranting disciplinary
action on behalf of the State and the disciplinary penalties that may
be imposed or recommended fo such misconduct; it does not create
offences punishable as crimes. 

 In
any judgment the Police Commission was not performing a legislative,
but an executive or administrative, act incidental to its function of
exercising disciplinary control over police officers when it
formulated the 1966 Regulations which are a discipline code, and not
legislation in the strict sense. They are akin to the former
Colonial Regulations, which the 1961 Regulations replaced, or to
general orders which obtained in other colonies or to a disciplinary
code adopted by professional associations such as the Medical or Bar
Association. 

 An
employer or master, whose employee or servant is dismissible without
cause, may nevertheless terminate the servant’s service for cause. 
The varieties of misconduct justifying dismissal at common law are
numerous and it is impracticable comprehensibly to include all
examples of such misconduct in a code. The employer may indicate in
cases as they arise particular acts or omissions which amount to
misconduct. This may include disobedience of lawful reasonable
orders and neglect of duty, see Batt’s Master and Servant (5th Edn) Chapter V and Halsbury’s Laws of England (3rd Edn) pages 485-489. 

 The
1966 Regulations are more in the nature of private or domestic rules,
in contrast to public law. The former regulates a class of persons,
the latter usually has general application to the public at large. 
Regulation 74 prescribes a rule, non-compliance with which is to be
regarded as a breach of discipline or a disciplinary offence. This
differs 

 455 

 from
an enactment creating a criminal offence, which, unlike a
disciplinary offence, may be punished by imprisonment or deprivation
of personal liberty either peremptorily, or in default of payment of
a fine. A fine as a penalty for a disciplinary offence is usually
deductible from the officer’s salary, if not voluntarily paid. 

 Even
where the Police Commission is authorised to make regulations
relating to procedure, these are not laws or legislation in the
accepted sense of the term, since it is optional for the matters
dealt with (except appeals) to be embodied in the form of
regulations. They could be made “otherwise”, as by insertion in
a circular, memorandum or in general or departmental orders. 

 Any
reference to regulation 74 that there may have been in the charges is
severable from the charge and may be regarded a surplusage. 

 It
is worthy of note that disciplinary offences in respect of
subordinate officers, and these only, were created by the Police
Service Regulations 1961 made under section 87 of the Jamaican
(Constitution) Order in Council 1959, which is the counterpart to
section 102 of the 1962 Constitution. 

 Counsel
for the respondent was forced into admitting that, if the Police
Commission had no authority to define disciplinary offences under the
1962 Constitution, its power to discipline was thwarted and could not
lawfully be exercised until not only the 1965 Act, but regulations,
made under section 65 thereof, became law. 

 It
is not necessary to decide whether section 65 of the Act of 1965
enabled the Governor-General exclusively, or concurrently with the
Police Commission, to create the relevant offences by regulations. 

 The
conferment of express power in this regard on the Parliaments of
Guyana and Barbados by article 108(6) and section 96(3) of their
respective Constitutions, however, suggests that such legislation
could not otherwise have been passed under the section investing
those legislatures with the authority to pass ordinary laws for
peace, order and good government. Article 108(6) of the Constitution
of Guyana, which came into force on 26th May 1966, stated: 




‘ Parliament
may make provision with respect to offences against Police Force
discipline and the punishment that may be imposed for any such
offence, and any power to exercise disciplinary control (including
any power to remove a person from office) or to determine an appeal
from a decision to exercise such a power that is exercisable by any
person or authority under the provisions of this article shall be
exercised in accordance with any such provision.’ 




 Article
18(3) provided: 




‘ In
relation to any person who is a member of a disciplined force [which
includes a police force] raised under a law in force in Guyana,
nothing contained in or done under the authority of the disciplinary
law of that force shall be held to be inconsistent with or in 

 456 

 contravention
of any of the provisions of this Chapter other than articles 4, 6 and
7.’ 

 [Those
articles are irrelevant for our purposes]. 

 To
the like effect as article 108(6) is section 96(3) of the
Constitution of Barbados. 

 On
the premise that the Police Commission had authority under section 99
of the 1962 Constitution to prescribe the relevant offences, the Act
of 1965 could only be relevant to this remit if all of the following
conditions were satisfied: (a) the Act was binding on the Crown (a
question dealt with under remit (3)); (b) section 65(1)( j )
was sufficiently explicit to permit of the disciplinary offence being
created by regulations; (c) section 65(1)( j )
of the Act could not co-exist, and was therefore inconsistent, with
section 99 of the 1962 Constitution; and (d) the Act was passed with
the Parliamentary majorities prescribed by section 38 of the 1962
Constitution for altering section 99. 

 As
condition (d) was not fulfilled, the others are immaterial and the
act of 1965 does not affect the determination of this remit. 

 This
problem was anticipated and provided against in the above-cited
provisions of the Constitutions of Guyana and Barbados which
expressly authorised Parliament to enact such legislation. 

 Now
for my findings on remit (1). 

 The
1966 Regulations, and in particular regulation 74, existed in law at
the relevant time for the following reasons. The nature of any
misconduct from which a gazetted officer or a First Division officer
could be disciplined and dismissed or removed from the service was
always specified by the Crown or by its delegate. Grounds for
dismissal were prescribed by statute only in respect of officers in a
disciplinary force such as the Police Force; but to adopt the
language of Evatt J in Fletcher v Nott (1937) 60 CLR 55 these were not an exclusive specification of the
cases for which punishment or dismissal may be imposed. In
formulating charges for misconduct, the Crown (through the
instrumentality of the Governor or of a Service Commission) does not
exercise a legislative, but an administrative (or executive)
function. 

 While
section 102 of the 1962 Constitution was not a statutory
authorisation for the Crown to create disciplinary offences, the 1966
Regulations were a convenient vehicle in which to place the
regulations. The mention of the regulation in the charge may be
disregarded and does not vitiate the proceedings. 

 Section
65(1)( j )
of the Act was inconsistent with section 99 of the 1962 Constitution
and no express power to legislate in respect of disciplinary offences
was conferred on Parliament by that Constitution. Even if section
65(1)( j )
of the Act of 1965 had been validly enacted, it did not deprive the
Police Commission of the right to prescribe disciplinary offences by
virtue of its implied power under section 99. 

 At
the highest section 65 conferred a concurrent right on the
Governor-General to prescribe such offences; but it is not necessary
to 

 457 

 decide
this point, as no such offences had been so prescribed at the
relevant time. 

 If
the power to prescribe offences against discipline resided in the
Police Commission as inherent or implied in, or as ancillary to, the
powers transferred to it from the Crown, then the Act of 1965 (to the
extent that it could not co-exist, and was inconsistent with, section
99) was void, since it was not passed in the manner and form
prescribed by section 38 of the 1962 Constitution (see Kariapper v Wijesinha [1968] AC 717, which was approved in Faultin v Attorney-General (1978) 30 WIR 351). 

 My
determination on remit (1) is that the three offences, specified in regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations, with
which the respondent was charged, were validly and properly created
by the Police Commission under section 99 of the 1962 Constitution
and existed in law at the material time. 

 Remit
(2): whether the respondent’s action is maintainable
notwithstanding sections 99 and 102 of the 1962 Constitution. 

 The
question here is whether the courts are in this case precluded by
section 102(4) of the 1962 Constitution from considering the legality
of the termination of the respondent’s service and, more
especially, the validity of the offences purportedly created by
regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations. 

 It
is essentially an exercise in construing section 102(4). That
enactment declares that a question whether a Service Commission has validly performed any
function vested in it by the 1962 Constitution shall not be enquired into in any court . 

 Section
99 on its face vests an apparently absolute discretion in the Police
Commission to discipline and dismiss police officers. As mentioned
previously, it does not state that it is subject to any of the
controls set out in other sections of the Constitution or in any
other law. 

 A
number of cases were cited in which it was held that preclusive
provisions did not oust the jurisdiction of the courts to enquire
into the validity of proceedings when there was a lack, or excess, of
jurisdiction on the part of the administrative tribunal. In many of
these cases the courts ruled that the dismissal of a public officer
or other adverse ruling of the tribunal was a nullity because a rule
of natural justice had not been observed. No allegation has been
made or proved in this case of non- compliance with such rules, which
were in fact observed. The respondent was told what was alleged
against him; and his defence or explanation was heard. 

 The
effectiveness of an ouster provision depends on its wording and the
circumstances in which it is sought to be invoked. This court was
invited to hold that, if the respondent was dismissible only for
cause and the convictions for the relevant offences were nullities,
section 102(4) did not prevent the court from enquiring into the
validity of the disciplinary proceedings. 

 This
contention appears to be tenable where the section bestowing the 

 458 

 power
to dismiss is subject to Chapter 1 of the 1962 Constitution (as in
section 93); see Kanda v Government of Malaya [1962] AC 322 and Harrikissoon v Attorney-General (1977) (unreported). 

 The
facts in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council [1956] 1 All ER 855 were that the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation
Procedure) Act 1946, Schedule 1, Part 4, paragraph 16, ordained that a compulsory purchase order “shall not, either before or after it has been confirmed, made or given, be
questioned in any legal proceedings whatsoever ”.
 The appellant was the owner of land and a dwelling-house in respect
of which a compulsory purchase order was made by the respondent under
the Act. He issued a writ against the respondent and others in which
he claimed a declaration that the order was made and confirmed in bad
faith, and damages. 

 Relying
on paragraph 16 the respondent applied for, and obtained, an order
setting aside the writ and all subsequent proceedings, for lack of
jurisdiction. The appeal against that order was dismissed by three
of the Law Lords who heard the appeal. Viscount Simonds said (at
page 858): 




‘ My
Lords, I think that any one bred in the tradition of the law is
likely to regard with little sympathy legislative provisions fo1
ousting the jurisdiction of the court, whether in order that the
subject may be deprived altogether of remedy or in order that his
grievance may be remitted to some other tribunal. But it is our
plain duty to give the words of an Act their proper meaning and, for
my part, I find it quite impossible to qualify the words of the
paragraph in the manner suggested. It may be that the legislature
had not in mind the possibility of an order being made by a local
authority in bad faith, or even the possibility of an order made in
good faith being mistakenly, capriciously or wantonly challenged. 
This is a matter of speculation. What
is abundantly clear is that words are used which are wide enough to
cover any kind of challenge which any aggrieved person may think fit
to make. I cannot think of any wider words .
 Any additions would be mere tautology.’ 




 By
way of amplification he continued (at page 859): 




‘ Plain
words must be given their plain meaning. There is nothing ambiguous
about paragraph 16; there is no alternative construction that can be
given to it; there is, in fact, no justification for the introduction
of limiting words such as ‘if made in good faith’, and there is
the less reason for doing so when those words would have the effect
of depriving the express words ‘ in
any legal proceedings whatsoever ’
of their full meaning and content.’ 




 In
their dissenting opinions Lord Reid and Lord Somerwell expressed the
view that the jurisidiction of the court was not excluded where, as
in that case, mala fides was alleged against the authority making the
order. They would have allowed the appeal. 

 In Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 1 All ER 208, the Foreign Compensation Act 1950, section 4(4),
provided that: 

 459 




‘ The
determination by the commission of any application made to them under
this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law.’ 




 Under
that Act the respondent commission was set up to deal with claims for
compensation for property confiscated by the Egyptian Government and
to make payments therefor. The appellant before the House of Lords
was such a claimant. There were certain conditions to be established
to qualify a person as a claimant, of which the commission had to be
satisfied. One of these was British nationality. The appellant, who
was the original owner of the confiscated property, was a British
national, but his successor in title was not. 

 The
appellant’s contention was that he was the proper claimant. The
contrary was argued by the commission who maintained that it was his
successor in title. 

 The
House of Lords held that a claimant who was an original owner did not
have to prove anything about successors in title; that the commission
made an enquiry which the Order providing for payments did not
empower it to make and which it had no right to take into account. 
The commission misconstrued the provision giving it power to act and
consequently it failed to deal with the question entrusted to it. It
lacked jurisdiction to make the determination which was not a real,
but a purported determination, and therefore a nullity. Accordingly
section 4(4) did not oust the court’s jurisdiction. 

 The
enactment construed in R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler [1976] 3 All ER 90 was similar to the one in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council [1956] 1 All ER 855 that was followed by the Court of Appeal, in
allowing an appeal from a Divisional Court which had ruled that the
jurisdiction of the court was not ousted by the enactment. 

 Despite
the doubts expressed in Anisminic’s case concerning Smith’s case, the Court of Appeal held that it was good law and binding on
them. Lord Denning MR distinguished the Anisminic case on three grounds (at page 95): 




‘ First,
in the Anisminic case the Foreign Compensation Act 1959 ousted the jurisdiction of the
court altogether. It precluded the court from entertaining any
complaint at any time about the determination. Whereas in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council the statutory provision has given the court jurisdiction to enquire
into complaints so long as the applicant comes within six weeks. The
provision is more in the nature of a limitation period than of a
complete ouster. That distinction is drawn by Professor Wade in his
book on Administrative Law ,
and by the late Professor de Smith in the latest edition of Halsbury’s Laws of England . 

 Second,
in the Anisminic case the House was considering a determination by a truly judicial
body, the Foreign Compensation 460 Tribunal, whereas in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council the House was considering an order which was very much in the nature
of an administrative decision. That is a distinction which Lord Reid
himself drew in Ridge v Baldwin [1963] 2 All ER 66. 

 There
is a great difference between the two. In making a judicial
decision, the tribunal considers the rights of the parties without
regard to the public interest. But in an administrative decision
(such as a compulsory purchase order) the
public interest plays an important part. The question is, to what extent are private interests to be
subordinated to the public interest. 

 Third,
in the Anisminic case the House had to consider the actual determination of the
tribunal, whereas in Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council the House had to consider the validity of the process by which the decision was reached.’ 




 Goff
LJ discerned the ratio in the Anisminic case to be that the House was dealing simply with a question of
absence of jurisdiction and not a case where an order is made within
jurisdiction. He opined (at page 98): 




‘ I
think there is a real distinction between the case with which the
House was dealing in Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission and Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council on the ground that, in the one case the determination was a purported
determination only, because the tribunal, however eminent, having
misconceived the effect of the statute, acted
outside its jurisdiction, and indeed without any jurisdiction at all ,
whereas here one is dealing with an actual decision made within jurisdiction though sought to be challenged.’ 




 In Civil Service Association v Public Service Commission (1970) (unreported) the plaintiff by writ of summons prayed for a
declaration that the Public Service Commission Regulations 1966 were
void and of no effect. Achong J held that the action was
misconceived because the commission was not a body corporate and
could not be sued eo nomine .
 He nevertheless expressed the following opinion: 




‘ Section
102(4) on which the contention is obviously based deals with
questions touching the validity of the performance of the functions
vested in the commission by the commission and any member thereof or
any person to whom such function has been delegated. It seems to me,
however, that in purporting to publish the 1966 Regulations the
commission was not acting in the performance of any of the functions
vested in it and so would not enjoy the protection afforded by the
subsection.’ 




 Durga
Das Basu in his Commentary on the Constitution of India (1965) Vo1 1, page 338, wrote: 




‘ Our
Constitution itself confers ‘final’ power on the President
(article 103(1)), or other administrative authority (article 31(3)),
to decide specified questions. Where the Constitution itself excluded such questions, 

 461 

 the
courts lose their jurisdiction to entertain those questions altogether, because they have no power
to override the Constitution and the questions, accordingly, become
non-justiciable. 

 A different situation arises where a statute confers ‘final’ power upon some administrative authority or
tribunal, because the constitutional jurisdiction of our superior courts cannot be taken
away by statutory provisions .
 Even the jurisdiction of the inferior courts has been saved by the
judicial construction that some statutory provisions are intended to
exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of law only where the decision
of the administrative authority is ultra vires ,
so that the courts retain their jurisdiction to determine whether the
decision or order of the statutory authority is ultra vires or without jurisdiction.’ 




 In Harrikissoon v Attorney-General (1977) (unreported) the appellant (a teacher) had questioned the
legality of his transfer to another school by the Teaching Service
Commission under section 99C of the 1962 Constitution. He asserted
that it was a punishment. The Public Service Regulations 1966
required an officer to be given three months’ notice of intended
transfer during which time he was permitted to request the commission
to review its decision. His appeal was dismissed. 

 Two
of Sir Isaac Hyatali CJ’s reasons, with which Phillips JA
concurred, are relevant to this appeal. The first was: 




 The
order of transfer being clearly within the scope of powers vested in
the commission, enjoyed a presumption of validity, which could not be
successfully assailed or removed, unless it was shown beyond a
reasonable doubt that the transfer did not involve the exercise of a
function vested in the commission but the exercise of a different and
forbidden function.’ 




 and
the second: 




‘ The
preclusive provision of section 102(4)( b )
of the Constitution is expressed in perfectly clear and simple terms.
 There can be no doubt about its meaning or intent. It does not
therefore collide with ‘the fundamental rule’ as it was called by
McNair J in Francis v Yiewsley and West Drayton Rural District Council [1958] 1 QB 478, or ‘the well-known rule’ as Sachs J described it
in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Cure&amp;Deeley Ltd (1962] 1 QB 340 at page 357, ‘that a statute should not be
construed as taking away the jurisdiction of the courts in the
absence of clear and unambiguous language to that effect’. For
present purposes, the provision is, in my view, the same in scope,
clarity and intent as that considered by the House of Lords in Smith v Elloe Rural District Council [1956] 1 All ER 855.’ 




 He
also cited from the passage in Durga Das Basu Commentary on the Constitution of India. 

 In Re Fisher (1966) 9 WIR 465 a police officer was reduced in rank on the
recommendation of a court of enquiry which investigated a 

 462 

 complaint
against the officer in accordance with the Police Service Regulations
1962 (which were made under the 1959 Constitution and continued in
force by the 1962 Constitution of Jamaica). Hercules J, applying Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council held that section 136 of the Jamaican Constitution (which corresponds
to section 102(4) of the 1962 Constitution) was clear and
unambiguous; and that no exercise of the functions provided by that
section could be enquired into in any court. He also quoted from the
extract of Durga Das Basu. 

 Articles
93 and 119(6) of the Guyana Constitution are the counterparts of
sections 93 and 102(4) of the 1962 Constitution. The Court of Appeal
of Guyana has construed article 93 vis-à-vis article 119(6) in the
following cases: Re
Sarran’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 361, Re Langhorne’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 353, both cited under remit (1), and Evelyn v Chichester (1970) 15 WIR 410 (in which public officers questioned the legality
of their punishment by the Public Service Commission under article
96, which corresponds to section 93 of the 1962 Constitution). 

 In Re Langhorne’s Application the punishment was a fine; and in the other two cases it was
dismissal. The Court of Appeal held that the commission had
performed a judicial or quasi-judicial act or function; and that,
notwithstanding article 119(6), the court had power to enquire into
the validity or constitutionality of the proceedings, by virtue of
the conjoint effect of articles 119(1) and 125(8) of the Guyana
Constitution. These read: 




‘ 119(1)
Save as otherwise provided in this Constitution, in the exercise of
its functions under this Constitution a commission shall not be
subject to the direction or control of any other person or authority. 

 125(8)
No provision of this Constitution that any person or authority shall
not be subject to the direction or control of any functions shall be
construed as precluding a court from exercising jurisdiction in
relation to any question whether that person or authority has
exercised those functions in accordance with this Constitution or any
other law.’ 




 In Re Sarran’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 361 the commission had, under article 96 of the Guyana
Constitution, delegated to a Permanent Secretary the power to hold an
enquiry into the conduct of a public officer. The Permanent
Secretary purported to sub-delegate that power to an assistant
secretary. Crane JA commented on article 125(8) (at page 364): 




‘ I
believe the purport of article 125(8) is quite clear. As I
understand the matter, that article operates as a proviso to article
119(6). It is in the nature of a proviso, I feel, because it
preserves, by excepting out of article 119(6), the ancient
supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court in fit cases ‘to enquire
and be informed’, which,
but for article 

 463 

 125(8),
would not exist in view of that aspect of finality which appears in
article 119(6) .’ 




 (This
passage was approved by Luckhoo C in Re Langhorne’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 353 at page 360.) 

 Crane
JA pontificated: 




‘ This
seemingly exclusionary jurisdictional clause in article 119(6) is
clearly designed to achieve non-interference by the judiciary in
matters of appointments to, and discipline in the Public Service -
matters which the framers of the Constitution think, and rightly so,
properly to be within the administration’s normal sphere of
competence. The idea is that administration must not be
unnecessarily impeded by resort to the courts to which, in this case,
there is no right of appeal. Administrative law and procedure,
together with administrative discretion, are thus given free scope
for development; they are left unfettered to function within their
own province, save for the right of the subject to the writ of certiorari the constitutional safeguard provided in article 125(8).’ 




 Invoking
the maxim delegatus non potest delegare the court held that a writ of certiorari should issue to the Permanent Secretary, who had acted in excess of
his jurisdiction. 

 The
facts in Re Langhorne’s Application (1969) 14 WIR 353 are summarised in the headnote: 




‘ The
applicant was the holder of a public office in that he was a
dispenser employed by the Ministry of Health. He was interdicted
from duty by the Public Service Commission pending the determination
of certain departmental charges which were preferred against him with
a view to his dismissal. A portion of his salary was withheld during
the period of interdiction. An enquiry was held and the charges
found proved, whereupon he was informed that he would be re-instated,
but that that portion of his salary which had been withheld would not
be paid to him, and that his incremental date would be postponed for
six months. 

 The
applicant complained that it was incompetent for the Public Service
Commission to withhold more than the sum prescribed by regulation 190
of the Regulations for Public Hospitals by way of a fine, and further
that he was deprived of his rights when certain documents were not
placed at his disposal before the day of the commencement of the
enquiry, as is required by the Colonial Regulations.’ 




 At
page 367 Luckhoo C drew a distinction between a usurpation of
jurisdiction by the commission, into which the courts could enquire,
and a wrong exercise of jurisdiction vested in the commission by the
Constitution that might affect the validity of the function, which
was not justiciable. In construing article 119(6) he said (at page
357): 

 464 




‘ The
jurisdiction of the courts therefore, is only shut out under that
article if the particular function purported to be performed is truly
vested in the commission ‘by or under the Constitution’. It is the nature of a condition
precedent that the function must so vest before the courts cease to
have the right to enquire under this article. If, then, a question
is raised as to whether in a particular case a function is or is not
vested, this goes to the root of the commission’s jurisdiction and
so is properly justiciable by the courts without the aid of any other
enabling provision.’ 




 and
later (at page 357): 




‘ But
once the jurisdiction to act has been properly assumed the validity
of the discharge of that function cannot be questioned under article
119(6) although the commission may have come to its conclusions without
sufficient evidence or by applying principles not countenanced by
law. In cases of that kind, the courts are expressly prohibited from
interfering. The Constitution obviously did not wish to ascribe an
appellate jurisdiction to the courts where facts may have been
wrongly construed or wrong interpretations given to matters involving
legal questions.’ 




 In Evelyn v Chichester (1970) 15 WIR 410 the Court of Appeal reviewed the English and Guyana
cases. A public officer, who was a deckhand on a ship under the
control of a government department, was charged with misconducting
himself during a voyage. He did not admit his guilt. He was
thereafter dismissed by the general manager of the department whose
power to do so under the relevant Ordinance was ‘subject to such
departmental orders as may from time to time be made by the
Government’. 

 The
power of appointment and discipline originally conferred on the
general manager by the Ordinance was deemed by the Constitution of
Guyana to have been delegated to him by the Public Service Commission
under that Constitution. 

 Where
liability was contested, the departmental orders, made under two
Acts, contemplated the holding of an enquiry. No such enquiry was
held. The Court of Appeal decided that, unlike the commission, the
general manager was not clothed with the authority to dismiss the
respondent at pleasure and was restricted in the exercise of his
powers by the orders which had the force of law. Non-compliance with
the orders vitiated the dismissal. 

 After
assuming that the decision of the general manager would be afforded
the same protection as article 119(6) provides for a commission,
Luckhoo C continued (at pages 421, 422): 




‘ For, there
can be no question that if this particular article is not elsewhere
qualified under the Constitution, a commission (which includes the
Public Service Commission) when performing a constitutional function
would enjoy 

 465 

 a
decided freedom from judicial enquiry. And the only jurisdiction
which a court will have is one of the preliminary question of whether
the particular function was or was not vested in the commission ‘by
or under’ the Constitution .
 At least a court would be precluded from attempting to sit as ‘a
court of appeal’ to enquire whether functions have been validly
performed or not, that is on a construction of this article in
isolation.’ 




 He
discovered that qualification in articles 119(1) and 125(8). Persaud
JA (at page 428) follows Re Fisher (1966) 9 WIR 465. 

 Section
102(4) is consistent, and in harmony, with the right of the Crown to
dismiss at pleasure. If this ouster clause is not to apply, the
respondent has at least successfully to cross the hurdles that he was
no longer dismissible at pleasure but only for cause, and that such
cause could not be specified by the Police Commission, but solely by
the Governor-General. 

 The
justifications proferred by counsel for enabling the respondent in
the present appeal to pierce the veil of the privative provision in
section 102(4) were that he was found guilty of a disciplinary
offence by the Police Commission in the exercise of a quasi-judicial
function; that there was no authority vested in the commission to
enact the offences set out in regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations;
and that these offences did not otherwise exist in law. 
Consequently, the commission had acted without, or in excess of,
jurisdiction in removing the respondent from the service. 

 In
my judgment the removal of the respondent cannot be questioned by the
court for the following reasons. The commission clearly was
exercising the functions of disciplinary control and of removal which
were truly vested in it under sections 99 and 105(2) of the
Constitution. It has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt
that it was exercising a function not vested in it. 

 The
commission was performing an act incidental to the exercise of its
functions under section 99 when it notified the respondent of his
misconduct which might result in disciplinary proceedings and when he
was subsequently charged for such misconduct. 

 The
respondent was dismissible without cause assigned. 

 The
disciplinary powers of the Police Commission were not subject to, or
restricted by, section 1 or section 2, or any other section of the
1962 Constitution, or by any enactment validly amending section 99. 

 Pursuant
to section 99, the respondent was properly charged by the
Attorney-General for the disciplinary offences specified in
regulation 74 of the 1966 Regulations. 

 Even
if (which it is unnecessary to decide), the Police Commission, or the
committee of enquiry, in finding the facts, was performing a
quasi-judicial or judicial act or function and on that account the
respondent was entitled as of right to the observance of the rules of
natural justice incorporated in the 1966 Regulations or at common
law, there was substantial adherence to those rules. 

 466 

 The
alleged illegality (i e the creation of disciplinary offences without
statutory authority) is an error of law within the jurisdiction in
the process of exercising the function, or jurisdiction which was
properly assumed and entered upon by the Police Commission. At the
highest it could only have been a wrong exercise, and not a
usurpation of, jurisdiction. There was no lack of jurisdiction. 

 The
jurisdiction of the court to enquire into whether the commission had
validly exercised that function is ousted by the plain and simple
words of section 102(4). 

 My
answer to this remit is that the respondent’s action is not
maintainable because: (a) the clear words of section 102(4) of the
1962 Constitution ousted the jurisdiction of the courts to enquire
into the validity of the removal of the respondent, which was a
function vested in the Police Commission by sections 99 and 105(5) of
the 1962 Constitution; and (b) alternatively, if the respondent was
only dismissible for cause, the Police Commission acted within the
jurisdiction conferred on it by section 99 of the 1962 Constitution
in removing the respondent for a disciplinary offence which existed
in law and in accordance with the rules of natural justice
incorporated in the 1966 Regulations. 

 The
Act of 1976 

 Having
disposed of the remits it only remains to determine whether section
18 of the Act of 1976 is relevant to this appeal. That section
reads: 




‘ All
enactments passed or made by any Parliament or person or authority
under or by virtue of the former Constitution and not before the
appointed day declared by a competent court to be void by reason of
any inconsistency with any provision of the former Constitution
including in particular sections 1 and 2 thereof and that are not
repealed, lapsed, spent or that had not otherwise had their effect,
shall be deemed to have been validly passed or made and to have had
full force and effect as part of the law of Trinidad and Tobago
immediately before the appointed day, even if any such enactments
were inconsistent with any provision of the former Constitution
including in particular sections 1 and 2 thereof.’ 




 As
indicated in Faultin v Attorney-General (1978) 30 WIR 351 the crucial point to be decided is as follows. To
the extent that any provisions of the Act of 1965 or of the 1966
Regulations were void for inconsistency with the 1962 Constitution,
were those provisions validated with effect from the date of the
passing of the enactments or only from the point of time immediately
before the commencement of the Act of 1976 on 1st August 1976? The
answer depends on the true meaning and effect of the phrase: 




‘ ...
shall be deemed to have been validly passed ... and to have had 

 467 

 full
force and effect as part of the law of Trinidad and Tobago
immediately before the appointed day [1st August 1976]’ 




 In
resolving the ambiguity in the meaning of this section assistance was
derived from the rule of interpretation succinctly expounded by
Lindley LJ in Lauri v Renard [1892] 3 Ch 402 at page 421: 




‘ It
is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute shall be
construed so as to have a retrospective operation unless its language
is such as plainly to require such a construction; and the same rule
involves another and subordinate rule to the effect that a statute is
not to be construed so as to have a greater retrospective operation
than its language renders necessary.’ 




 I
endorse my conclusion in Faultin’s case that: 




‘ The
words ‘immediately before the appointed day’ qualify the passing
as well as the coming into operation of the Act in question, and the
validation of a law by section 18 of the Act of 1976 is effective
only as from the point in time immediately before 1st August 1976.’ 




 The
material part of section 18 may be reconstructed to read: 




‘ All
enactments ... shall be deemed - 

 (a)
to have been validly passed or made, and 

 (b)
to have had full force and effect as part of the law of Trinidad and
Tobago; 

 immediately
before the appointed day.’ 




 The
result is that, if any of the relevant enactments was void ab initio ,
the validation would have been effective after the material date when
the infringements of the 1966 Regulations were alleged to have taken
place and the order for the respondent’s removal from the police
service was made or enforced. Section 18 therefore has no bearing
on, or relevance to, the issues in this cause. 

 The
decision 

 My
determination in essence is that by and under sections 99 and 102 of
the 1962 Constitution and the 1966 Regulations, the respondent was
properly charged with, and convicted of, the relevant offences and
lawfully removed from the Public Service. 

 Order
3, rule 6 (cited above), came into operation after the order of
Maharaj J and before the determination by Braithwaite J. As it is a
rule of procedure, and not of substantive law, it is applicable to
the hearing before this court. 

 Under
section 38(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1962 the Court
of Appeal has all the power, authority and jurisdiction of the High
Court for the purposes of and incidental to, the determination of any
judgment or order made thereon. 

 By
section 39(1) and (2) of the same Act this court has the power to 

 468 

 make
any such order as the High Court could have made and to make such
further or other order as the case may require. An order may be made
on such terms as may be just, to ensure the determination on the
merits of the real question in controversy between the parties. 

 In
the pleadings the respondent has not questioned his removal from the
Public Service on its merits. If he was properly charged with the
relevant offences, there is no cavil that they were not proved or
that his interdiction from the performance of his duties or his
removal from the service was unlawful. 

 I
would allow the appeal against the order of Braithwaite J, disallow
the cross-appeal, and dismiss the cause. I would also order the
respondent to pay to the Attorney-General his costs of the
proceedings here and in the court below. 

 Appeal
allowed. 

 Editorial
note. The decision of the Court of Appeal in this case was affirmed by the
Privy Council; see [1982] AC 113. The decision of the Privy Council
will be reported in a forthcoming volume.

 21ST
JUNE 1979

 Order
6, rule 2(1), of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1975 provides:
“Before a writ is issued it must be indorsed ... (c) where the
claim made by the plaintiff is for possession of land with a
statement showing whether or not his right to possession is subject
to any statutory restriction ...”. 

 Entry
of an unconditional appearance to a defective writ waives any
objection to the jurisdiction of the court, as well as any
irregularity in the commencement of the proceedings (such as a
failure to comply with the Rules of the Supreme Court 1975, Order 6,
rule 2(1)( c ).
 So also does any fresh step taken, with knowledge of the
irregularity, with a view to defending the action on its merits. 

 Per
Sir Isaac Hyatali CJ and Corbin JA. Where premises are not subject to statutory restriction, an omission
from the statement of claim in an action for possession of any
reference to that fact does not, by Order 6, rule2(1)( c ),
detract from the sufficiency of the statement of claim. 

 Per
Kelsick JA. Although section 14 of the Rent Restriction Ordinance prohibits the
making of an order or the giving of judgment for the possession of
premises to which the Ordinance applies unless specified conditions
are met and the court considers it reasonable to make the order, the
section is directed to the order or judgment and not to the writ or
statement of claim and it has no effect on the entry of judgment in
respect of premises to which the Ordinance does not apply.

 Appeal 

 Appeal Tiffany Glass Ltd (the plaintiff) appealed to the Court of Appeal of
Trinidad and Tobago (civil appeal 85 of 1978) against the dismissal
by McMillan J in chambers on 5th May 1978 of its application to sign
final judgment for the possession of premises, arrears of rent and
mesne profits. F Plan Ltd (the defendant) cross-appealed against the
judge’s dismissal of its objection to the validity of the writ. 

 M
de la Bastide SC and M Daley for the plaintiff 

 F
Ramsahoye SC and C D Phelps for the defendant 

 Corbin
JA. It does not indicate any lack of appreciation on my part of the
industry of counsel on both sides in presenting their very helpful
arguments if I express the view that the several points discussed in
this appeal and cross-appeal may be dealt with quite shortly. 

 The
plaintiff had applied by way of summons to McMillan J in chambers for
leave to sign final judgment against the defendant in an action
claiming possession of premises occupied by the defendant under an
oral agreement for a lease which had terminated. At the hearing of
that summons the defendant filed an affidavit in opposition and
sought leave to defend and to counterclaim in the action. McMillan J
having refused both applications, there is an appeal and
cross-appeal. 

 It
is important to bear in mind that, on the face of it, the only
question for McMillan J to decide at the hearing of the plaintiff’s
summons was 

 471 

 whether
the defendant had, by its affidavit, shown that there was a triable
issue such as would entitle it to defend the action and to
counterclaim. 

 Counsel
for the defendant, however, took a preliminary objection before the
judge in chambers that the writ initiating the action was not valid
because the plaintiff did not state in the indorsement whether or not
the premises were subject to any statutory restriction (as a
plaintiff is required to do by the Rules of the Supreme Court 1975,
Order 6, rule 2(1)( c )). 

 The
trial judge ruled that this omission was an irregularity which the
defendant had waived by taking a fresh step in the action by filing
affidavits; and that consequently the writ was valid. Although the
defendant has not cross-appealed against that ruling, at the hearing
of this appeal it was contended by counsel that the ruling was wrong
since the omission was not a mere irregularity. The requirement in
the rule, he said, is a condition precedent to the issuing of the
writ and its omission renders the writ a nullity which cannot be
cured by the steps taken in the matter by the defendant. 

 In
my judgment the omission in the writ is an irregularity which had
been waived; and the judge was right to rule on the preliminary
objection as he did. But, in any event, there is no merit in
counsel’s submission because the different consequences which flow
from the distinction between a nullity and an irregularity have been
now abolished by the Rules of the Supreme Court 1975, Order 2, rule 1
(1), which reads: 




‘ Where,
in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or at any stage
in the course of or in connection with any proceedings, there has, by
reason of anything done or left undone, been a failure to comply with
the requirements of these or any other rules of court, whether in
respect of time, place manner, form or content or in any other
respect, the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall
not nullify the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order
therein.’ 




 The
judge repeated his ruling in his written reason for decision; but he
refused the plaintiff leave to sign final judgment, because he said
that: 




‘ In
order to obtain leave, the statement of claim must be complete and
good in itself and must, therefore, comply with the rule. Further
the affidavit in support must verify the facts (Order 14, rule 2) and
this has not been done in relation to the indorsement required by
Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ).
 In my view it is an essential part of the indorsement to the
specially-indorsed writ for possession of premises which, as is
apparent from the writ itself, is situated in the ward of Diego
Martin, an area specified in the Schedule to the Rent Restriction
Ordinance.’ 




 While
it is correct to say that to obtain leave to sign judgment under
Order 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court the statement of claim
must 

 472 

 be
good and complete in itself, I must differ from the judge in holding
that the statement of claim in the instant case did not satisfy that
requirement. The plaintiff had pleaded (1) an agreement for a lease
for a term of three years from 15th September 1974. at a monthly
rental of $1500; (2) that the said term had expired; (3) that the
defendant had failed to deliver up possession; and (4) that the
defendant was in arrears with the rent. 

 These
were all the ingredients necessary to constitute a good and complete
cause of action, and it was not necessary for this purpose to include
a statement as is required by Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
showing whether or not the right to possession is subject to any
statutory restriction. The purpose for which that statement is
included in the indorsement of a writ is to alert the judge to
consider whether or not it is reasonable to make the order in cases
where the premises are shown to be protected by the Rent Restriction
Ordinance, and so avoid the embarrassment of making an order which is
a nullity. 

 This
does not in any way affect the question of whether a good and
complete cause of action has been shown; and the omission to include
it in the indorsement was an irregularity which, as we have seen, was
waived by the defendant filing affidavits. The trial judge erred
when he held that the statement was essential to show a good and
complete cause of action. Moreover, he had before him the
proceedings filed in the first action (put into evidence by consent
at the hearing of this summons), in which there was an admission by
the defendant that the premises were not protected. The evidence
made it clear therefore that the plaintiff’s right to possession
(the word used in the rule) was not subject to any statutory
restriction and that there was nothing to prevent the judge from
giving leave to sign final judgment. 

 In
deciding if there was a triable issue the only question for
determination was whether the defendant had shown that he was
entitled to remain in possession of the premises by reason of having
properly exercised an option to purchase, granted to him by an
agreement made at the same time as the agreement for lease under
which he held. 

 The
history of the matter may be stated thus: the plaintiff was owner of
the premises; the defendant had gone into occupation under oral
agreements for a lease at the rental of $1500 per month, and an
option to purchase in consideration of the payment of $1000 per month
during the period of the lease; this oral agreement was reduced into
writing and tendered to the defendant, but was never signed; the
plaintiff purported to terminate the tenancy by a month’s notice
dated 25th June 1975 on the basis that the defendant held under a
monthly tenancy. 

 By
letter dated 28th June 1975 the defendant treated that notice as a
repudiation of the agreements for a lease and an option to purchase,
and impliedly accepted the termination of the tenancy by asking for
time to vacate; the defendant failed to make any payments due as rent
or on the option after 25th August 1975; it failed to vacate the
premises and the plaintiff issued a writ claiming possession on the
basis that the defendant 

 473 

 had
been in occupation as a monthly tenant; the defendant sought and
obtained leave to defend the claim on the basis of its contention
that it was in occupation by virtue of an agreement for lease and an
option to purchase and not under a monthly tenancy, and it
counterclaimed for damages and for certain declarations including a
declaration that the defendant held the premises under and by virtue
of the agreements for a lease and the option. 

 The
plaintiff took no further steps to enforce the writ; the defendant
continued in occupation and, by letter dated 13th June 1977,
purported to exercise the option granted under the agreement
aforesaid; the plaintiff subsequently sought and obtained leave to
withdraw the first writ and, by another writ, claimed possession on
the basis that the agreement for a lease had terminated by effluxion
of time, the defendant applied to McMillan J for leave to defend the
second action on the ground that it was entitled to remain in
possession because it had properly exercised the option to purchase. 
Immediately before the hearing of this summons in chambers the
plaintiff obtained leave to withdraw the first action. 

 At
the hearing of this appeal counsel for both parties have made careful
and detailed submissions on the issue (1) whether the agreement for a
lease had been repudiated by the plaintiff when he served the notice
to quit on 25th June 1975, (2) whether the defendant had elected to
treat that notice as a repudiation, and (3) the legal consequences
that followed. 

 In
my judgment these matters do not arise for consideration having
regard to the state of the pleadings being dealt with by the judge in
chambers at the hearing of this summons. There was before him a
statement of claim in which the plaintiff had pleaded an agreement
for a lease which had expired by effluxion of time, and there was an
admission of this by the defendant. It was clear that both sides
treated the lease as having subsisted for the full term and that the
defendant sought leave to defend solely on the validity of its
exercise of the option to purchase granted under the agreement. 

 The
trial judge recognised that this was so, and decided, quite rightly,
that the defendant could not base a defence on this since it had
failed to pay the monthly instalments due and had lost its right
under the option. Consequently he held that: 




‘ In
[the first action] the declaration sought could only relate to the
defendant’s rights as at 31st July 1975, the date on which the
plaintiff purported to determine the tenancy. In the instant action
what is in issue is the validity of the purported exercise of the
option by the letter of 13th June 1977. In my view counsel for the
plaintiff was correct when he submitted that if the defendant wished
to keep the option alive it should have continued making the monthly
payments under the option agreement as and when they fell due and
that, not having done so, he has elected to treat it as at an end. 
In the circumstances, not having paid either the rent due or the
option instalments, there can 

 474 

 be
no possible defence based on the purported exercise of the option on
13th June 1975.’ 




 Authority
for this proposition is to be found in Australian Hardwoods Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Railways [1961] 1 All ER 737 at page 751. 

 Unfortunately,
he then misdirected himself by deciding that he should refuse the
plaintiff leave to sign final judgment on the ground that, if the
premises were protected by the Rent Restriction Ordinance, the
defendant might have become a statutory tenant. As we have seen,
this possibility did not exist because the premises were not
protected and the defendant could not become a statutory tenant; see Cow v Casey [1949] 1 All ER 197. 

 In
the event the plaintiff had shown a good cause of action, the
defendant had failed to raise a triable issue on its application for
leave to defend and the judge fell into error when he refused the
plaintiff leave to sign final judgment. 

 In
the result I would allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal,
with costs both here and in the court below. I would order the
defendant to deliver up possession of the premises and to pay the
plaintiff $36,000 as rent due up to 15th September 1977; and to pay
mesne profits calculated at the rate of $ 1500 per month from 15th
September 1977 until such date as it vacates the premises. 

 Kelsick
JA. The defendant, F Plan Ltd is in possession of Lot 7, Diamond Vale
Industrial Estate, Diego Martin (“the premises”) of which the
plaintiff, Tiffany Glass Ltd, is the leasehold owner. The defendant
has installed plant and machinery for the manufacture of furniture in
a factory building located on the premises. 

 This
action was commenced on 4th November 1977, by a writ with an
indorsement of claim (formerly referred to as a specially-indorsed
writ) to which an appearance was entered. 

 By
summons dated 2nd December 1977, the plaintiff applied, under Order
14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1975 (the “RSC 1975”), to a
judge in chambers for leave to sign final judgment in this action for
the reliefs claimed in the writ, namely: (a) possession of the
premises; (b) $37,500 arrears of rent; (c) mesne profits at the rate
of $1500 per month from 15th November 1975 to date of delivery of
possession; and 7 (d) costs. Order 14, so far as relevant, provides: 




‘ Rule
1 (1) Where in an action to which this rule applies a statement of
claim has been served on a defendant and that defendant has entered
an appearance in the action, the plaintiff may, on the ground that
that defendant has no defence to a claim included in the writ ...
apply to the court for judgment against that defendant ... 

 Rule
2 (1) An application under rule I must be made by summons supported
by an affidavit verifying the facts on which the claim ... is based
and stating that in the deponent’s belief there is no defence to
that claim ... 

 475 

 Rule
3 (1) Unless on the hearing of an application under rule I either the
court dismisses the application or the defendant satisfies the court
with respect to the claim ... that there is an issue or question in
dispute which ought to be tried or that there ought for some other
reason to be a trial of that claim ... the court may give such
judgment for the plaintiff against that defendant on that claim ...
as may be just having regard to the nature of the remedy or relief
claimed ... 

 Rule
4 (1) A defendant may show cause against an application under rule 1
by affidavit or otherwise to the satisfaction of the court ... 

 (3)
The court may give a defendant against whom such an application is
made leave to defend the action with respect to the claim, ... either
unconditionally or on such terms as to giving security or time or
mode of trial or otherwise as it thinks fit.’ 




 In
an affidavit filed in opposition to the application the defendant
sought leave to defend and to counterclaim in the action. 

 The
writ was, with leave of the judge, amended by substituting “$36,000”
for “$37,500” and “September 1977” for “November 1975”. 

 McMillan
J dismissed the application with costs on 5th May 1978. He neither
gave leave to sign judgment nor conditional or unconditional leave to
defend. Nor did he make an order for the payment of arrears of rent
or of mesne profits. No formal order embodying the judge’s
decision has been filed. 

 The
plaintiff in its appeal and the defendant in its cross-appeal are
seeking the respective reliefs denied to them by the trial judge. 

 At
the hearing of the summons before McMillan J, when the application to
amend the writ was made, a preliminary objection was taken by the
defendant that the writ was invalid for non-compliance with the RSC
1975, Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
which reads: 




‘ Before
a writ is issued it must be indorsed ... ( c )
where the claim made by the plaintiff is for possession of land with
a statement showing whether or not his right to possession is subject
to any statutory restriction.’ 




 For
convenience I shall refer to this indorsement as the “Order 6
indorsement”. 

 There
was no such indorsement on the writ. In particular, it did not
appear whether or not the premises were subject to the Rent
Restriction Ordinance (the “RRO”). 

 The
judge did not sustain the objection. He ruled that the omission of
the indorsement from the writ was waived by the defendant when he
took a fresh step in the action by filing affidavits in the
proceedings. That ruling, with which I am in agreement, has not been
questioned by the defendant in his cross-appeal. Nor has the
defendant appealed against the order giving leave to amend the writ,
which amendment would be ineffectual if the writ were a nullity. 
Counsel for the defendant 

 476 

 nevertheless
contended before us that the ruling was incorrect in law. 

 In
his reasons for decision, however, McMillan J held that the Order 6
indorsement was an essential part of the statement of claim, in the
absence of which it did not disclose a complete and good cause of
action. In giving the grounds for his decision to dismiss the
application and for his refusal to give leave to defend, the judge
stated: 




‘ In
order to obtain leave, the statement of claim must be complete and
good in itself and must, therefore, comply with the rule. Further,
the affidavit in support must verify the facts (Order 14, rule 2) and
this has not been done in relation to the indorsement required by
Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ).
 In my view it is an essential part of the indorsement to the
specially-indorsed writ for possession of premises which, as is
apparent from the writ itself, is situated in the ward of Diego
Martin, an area specified in the Schedule to the Rent Restriction
Ordinance. 

 The
question remains whether I should dismiss the application or give
leave to defend. I think I ought to dismiss the application since it
may be open to the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim with
leave if necessary, and apply again for summary judgment. See Gurney v Small [1891] 2 QB 584, Wills J at page 587. I think that I should not
enter judgment for the liquidated sum claimed as arrears of rent and
give leave to defend as to the rest of the claim since, if the
premises are subject to the Rent Restriction Ordinance, the question
as to the standard rent applicable to the premises would be in issue
and the plaintiff may not be entitled to recover the sum claimed or
mesne profits. In any event the defendant may be entitled to remain
in occupation as a statutory tenant. I do not think it right to give
unconditional leave to defend since in none of the affidavits filed
by the defendant on the two proceedings or in the defences disclosed
has it claimed the protection of the Rent Restriction Ordinance and,
save for that issue, there is no arguable defence to the action.’ 




 It
would appear that the stand taken by the judge was that the omission
of the Order 6 indorsement was an irregularity which could be waived;
but that its omission from the statement of claim was fatal to the
proceedings. 

 In
my view Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
refers and relates only to the writ, and not to the statement of
claim. 

 In
its grounds of appeal the plaintiff states that the judge erred in
law in holding that: (a) the statement of claim was defective for
non-compliance with Order 6, rule 2(1)( c );
(b) if it was so defective, such defect did not constitute an
irregularity which was effectively waived by the defendant; and (c)
the affidavit in support of the summons did not sufficiently verify
the facts on which the plaintiff’s claim was based. 

 The
Rules of the Supreme Court 1946 (the “RSC 1946”) were revoked and
replaced by the RSC 1975 as from 2nd January 1976. Under Order 111,
rule 6(2), of the RSC 1946 there were specified actions in which the
writ of summons could (at the option of the plaintiff) be specially 

 477 

 indorsed
with, or accompanied by, a statement of the claim or of the remedy or
of the relief to which he claimed to be entitled. Among these was an
action by a landlord for recovery of possession of land, with or
without a claim for rent and mesne profits, against a tenant whose
term had expired or had been duly determined by notice to quit or had
been liable to forfeiture for non-payment of rent. 

 It
is in respect of such actions only that leave to sign summary
judgment could have been obtained pursuant to Order XIV, rule 1. 
Under Order 6, rule 2, any cause may now be indorsed on a statement
of claim and judgment obtained therefor under Order 14. Order
LXVIII, rule 1, of the RSC 1946 provided that: 




‘ Non-compliance
with any of these rules, or with any rule of practice for the time
being in force shall not render any proceedings void unless the court
or a judge shall so direct, but such proceedings may be set aside
either wholly or in part as irregular or amended, or otherwise dealt
with in such manner as upon such terms as the court or a judge shall
think fit.’ 




 The
effect of this rule was that non-compliance with some rules was
treated as an irregularity and with others as a nullity. An
irregularity could be waived by the defendant taking a fresh step in
the action; whereas a nullity, which deprives the court of
jurisdiction, could not be so waived. The distinction between a
non-compliance with a rule which rendered the proceedings a nullity
and one which merely rendered them irregular, was abolished by Order
2, rule 1(1) of the RSC 1975 according to which (see Harkness v Bell’s Asbestos and Engineering Ltd [1966] 3 All ER 843 at pages 845, 846): 




‘ Where,
in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or at any stage
in the course of or in connection with any proceedings, there has, by
reason of anything done or left undone, been a failure to comply with
the requirements of these or any other rules of court, whether in
respect of time, place, manner, form or content or in any other
respect, the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall
not nullify the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order
therein.’ 




 Entry
of an unconditional appearance to a defective writ waives any
objection to the jurisdiction of the court as well as any
irregularity in the commencement of the proceedings. So also does
any fresh step taken, with the knowledge of the irregularity, with a
view to defending the action on its merits. See the note to Order 2,
rule 2, in the Supreme Court Practice 1979, page 10, and the cases there cited. 

 In
my judgment the failure to comply with Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
was an irregularity which was waived by the defendant when it entered
an unconditional appearance to the writ. 

 A
similar result would have ensued from the affidavit of Gordon Farah,
one of the defendant’s directors, filed on 1st February 1978, in 

 478 

 opposition
to the summons, wherein the defendant sought leave to defend the
action and counterclaim. This constituted a fresh step in the
action. 

 Order
6, rule 2(1)( c ),
is meant for the protection of the tenant. In respect of premises to
which the RRO applies, section 14 thereof prohibits the making of an
order or the giving of a judgment for the recovery of such premises
unless one or more of the conditions specified in that section are
met and the court considers it reasonable to make such order or to
give such judgment. The purpose of the rule is to guard against the
entering and enforcement of a judgment which is so prohibited. 

 In Smith v Poulter [1947] 1 All ER 216, the English Court of Appeal set aside a judgment
in default of appearance for possession of premises that were subject
to the Rent Restriction Acts on the ground that it was invalid for
non-compliance with the analogue to section 14 of the RRO. Denning J
said (at page 217): 




‘ That
provision limits the jurisdiction of the court, with the result that
in any case where there is reason to think that the house is within
the Acts, it is the duty of the court to see whether the conditions
required by the Acts are satisfied, even though not pleaded or raised
by the tenant.’ 




 The
English counterpart to Order 111, rule 6, of the RSC 1946, was then
operative, and that to Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
of the RSC 1975 had not then been enacted. Denning J (at page 217)
nevertheless suggested as a rule of practice that: 




‘ In
actions for possession of a dwelling-house, the indorsement of the
writ should state either the reason why the house is not within the
Rent Restriction Acts, or, if it is within the Rent Restrictions
Acts, what is the ground on which possession is sought.’ 




 A
similar conclusion to that in Poulter’s case was reached in Peachey Property Corporation Ltd v Robinson [1966] 2 All ER 981. The affidavit in support of the summons
applying for the issue of a writ of possession to enforce the
judgment in default of appearance averred that the Rent Acts applied
to the tenancy of the dwelling-house (see page 986). The Court of
Appeal ruled (at page 983) that the judgment was a nullity because no
court had determined whether it was reasonable to make such an order
or give such a judgment and that in consequence the judgment was a
nullity. 

 Section
14 of the RRO is directed to the order or judgment for possession,
not to the writ, or to the statement of claim. Where the RRO applies
the plaintiff may be deprived of his judgment under section 14 if
there has been a failure by the judge to comply with that section. 
The section has no effect on the entering of a judgment where the RRO
does not apply to the premises. 

 Where
the writ states that the premises are not subject to the RRO, 

 479 

 this
fact must be established by evidence, which may be in the form of an
affidavit. Where there is an indorsement that the RRO applies, it
was decided in the Peachey Property case that the court must, in addition, be satisfied that the judgment
is in conformity with section 14, whether or not an appearance has
been entered to the writ. As Winn J puts it (at page 983): 




‘ In
my view therefore by express force of that section the judgment in
default of appearance here was a nullity. It was, according to its
terms, a judgment for recovery of possession of these premises, and
that is something which the section prohibits unless there has been a
prior determination by the court that it was reasonable to give such
a judgment.’ 




 Although,
by virtue of Order 2, the writ is not now a nullity but subject to an
irregularity which was waived by the defendant, the court could
declare the judgment to be invalid if it is established that there is
no jurisdiction to give the judgment under section 14. 

 As
previously mentioned, the Order 6 indorsement applies to writs and
not to indorsements qua statements of claim. The indorsement is not required to be made on
the claim, but on the writ; although there can be no objection to its
being inserted in the claim of a specially-indorsed writ, since the
claim forms part of the writ. 

 A
statement of claim indorsed on a writ is a pleading as well as a
writ. It is also part of the writ on which it is indorsed and is
served as part of the writ. When a claim is indorsed on a writ, that
claim constitutes both the indorsement on the writ as well as the
statement of claim. In so far as it is an indorsement, the defect
(if any) is waived by a fresh step taken in the action. But, in so
far as it is a statement of claim not disclosing a complete cause of
action, the defect is not waived by a fresh step taken in the action.
 That defect can only be cured by an amendment of the statement of
claim. 

 A
provision corresponding to Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
was contemporaneously embodied in Order 13, rule 4(2), and Order 19,
rule 5(2), of the RSC 1975. This provides for the entering of a
judgment in default respectively of appearance and of defence to an
action for recovery of possession of land. It reads: 




‘ The
plaintiff shall not be entitled, except with leave of the court to
enter judgment ... unless he produces a certificate by his solicitor,
or (if he sues in person) an affidavit stating that his right to
possession is not subject to any statutory restriction.’ 




 All
three rules were adapted from their English counterparts which were
made following the decision in the Peachey Property case. The English rule, however, is confined to a reference to the
Rent Acts; and the indorsement must indicate whether the land to be
recovered is a dwelling-house with a rateable value that is protected
by the Rent Acts. 

 One
of the objects of the English rule (and I would say also of our rule) 

 480 

 is
to enable the plaintiff who, as in the present case, claims
possession of premises to which the RRO does not apply, to enter
judgment under Order 13 or Order 19 or to apply for such a judgment
under Order 14 (see Supreme Court Practice 1979, Vol 1, page 43, note). 

 The
rule does not enjoin the plaintiff to plead (in terms of section 14
of the RRO) which of the relevant conditions specified in that
section are applicable, that these conditions have been satisfied and
that the court ought to consider it reasonable to allow judgment to
be entered. It suffices for the negative assertion to be made (on
the writ and not on the statement of claim) that the plaintiff’s
right to possession is not subject to any statutory restriction. 

 In
these circumstances I do not consider that this is a material fact
which must, in compliance with Order 18, rule 7, be pleaded. A
material fact is one which is necessary for formulating a complete
cause of action, the omission of which makes the statement of claim
bad, and the claim demurrable and liable to be struck out under Order
18, rule 17, on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of
action; see Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 All ER 287 at page 294. 

 If
I am right in my conclusion that the Order 6 indorsement is a matter
of form and not of substance, the omission of which has been waived,
these consequences follow. The facts pleaded in the claim disclose a
good and complete cause of action, and neither the statement of claim
nor the affidavit need be amended so as to include respectively the
indorsement and its verification. 

 By
consent of the parties, there was admitted in evidence before
McMillan J the pleadings and other documents in High Court action
2603 of 1975 (“the first action”), including the
specially-indorsed writ of summons dated 31st October 1975, in which
the plaintiff claimed recovery of possession of the premises from the
defendant. In the statement of claim there was an allegation that
the premises are excluded from the RRO by virtue of the Rent
Restriction (Exclusion of Premises) Order 1969. There was a specific
admission to that effect by the defendant in its defence to that
action, which supplied the omission from the affidavit of a statement
to that effect; see Les Fils Dreyfus et Cie SA v Clarke [1958] 1 All ER 459 at page 462 per Lord Parker CJ. 

 That
the evidence to satisfy the requirement of Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
is not restricted to the affidavit is apparent from Orders 13 and 19,
under which a certificate of a solicitor suffices and the affidavit
may be dispensed with by leave of a judge. 

 Where
the judge, as in the present case, is satisfied by evidence that the
RRO does not apply, the judgment cannot be a nullity by virtue of
non-compliance with section 14 and the plaintiff is entitled to
judgment if its cause of action is otherwise complete and there is no
bona fide triable issue raised by the defendant. 

 McMillan
J accordingly erred in refusing leave to the plaintiff to
enter-judgment for the reason that the statement of claim had not
complied with Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
by the omission therefrom of a pleading that 

 481 

 the
plaintiff’s right to possession was not subject to any statutory
restriction and for the reason that the affidavit in support omitted
to verify that fact. 

 Gurney
v Small [1891] 2 QB 584, on which McMillan J relied, is not relevant. It did
not relate to the English rule corresponding to Order 6, rule
2(1)( c ),
which had not then been enacted. There the claim was not only for a
liquidated sum, but was also for the use and occupation of the
plaintiff’s premises (which was not a cause of action listed in
Order 111, rule 6). The ratio of Wills J’s decision, that the writ was not a specially-indorsed
writ and was not amendable, may be found in the following passage in
his judgment (at pages 586, 587): 




‘ ...
to hold otherwise would be to deprive the expression ‘seek only to
recover’ in that rule of all its significance. The operation of
Order XIV, rule 1, is confined, therefore, to the case of a defendant
appearing to a writ of summons specially indorsed with a liquidated
demand under Order 111, rule 6, and with nothing else. Where that is
the case, leave may be given to enter judgment ‘for the amount so
indorsed’ - an expression which shows, if further argument were
necessary, that the order is only intended to apply to writs
previously specially indorsed under Order 111, rule 6.’ 




 If
I had been of the opinion that the Order 6 indorsement was an
essential part of the statement of claim I would have acceded to the
request of counsel for the plaintiff for an amendment of the
statement of claim. 

 I
now direct my attention to the merits of the cross-appeal in which
the defendant requested that it be allowed to defend in terms of a
draft defence and counterclaim annexed to the affidavit filed on its
behalf by Gordon Farah in opposition to the summons for summary
judgment. 

 In
its statement of claim the plaintiff stated that the defendant was in
possession of the premises under an oral agreement reduced to writing
by which the plaintiff had let the premises to the defendant at a
monthly rent of $1500 payable in advance, for a term of three years
commencing 15th September 1974, which expired on 14th September 1977.
 It also alleged that the defendant was in arrears of rent and
claimed mesne profits. Although the liability for these arrears was
denied in the defence, they were admitted by counsel for the
defendant before McMillan J. 

 The
real defence to this action, as acknowledged by counsel for the
defendant, is that the defendant is an equitable owner in possession,
in consequence of its exercise of an option to purchase the premises
at the price of $375,000 conferred on it by an oral agreement reduced
to writing. 

 In
its counterclaim, after stating that the plaintiff wrongfully refused
to sell the premises to the defendant, thus depriving it of the
benefit of that option and causing-it to suffer loss and damage, the
defendant claimed damages for breach of contract, including special
damage in the sum of $200,000, which represents the difference
between the market 

 482 

 value
of the premises ($575,000) and the agreed purchase price. The
defendant also claimed a declaration that it was entitled to have the
premises assigned to it in terms of the oral option. 

 In
support of the plaintiff’s statement of claim the following
material facts were proved before McMillan J. The plaintiff had a
lease from the Industrial Development Corporation (the “IDC”) of
the premises, including the house or factory building erected
thereon. The defendant entered into possession of the premises in
September 1974. It remained in possession by virtue of an oral
agreement, which was subject to the consent of the IDC, whereby the
plaintiff undertook to grant to the defendant a sub-lease of the
premises for three years commencing on 15th September 1974. 

 Supplemental
thereto was another oral agreement under which, subject also to the
consent of the IDC, the defendant was granted an option (to be
exercised not later than 15th June 1977) to purchase the leasehold of
the premises on 15th September 1977. Both these agreements were
reduced to writing and copies were supplied to the defendant with
requests for its signature that it never complied with. I shall
refer to these agreements as “the lease agreement” and “the
oral agreement”, respectively. 

 The
consideration in the lease agreement was a rent of$1500, payable in
advance as from 15th September 1974, on the 15th day of each month. 
The fee for the option specified in the option agreement was the sum
of $36,000, payable at the same time as the rent in monthly
instalments of $1000. In the event of the valid exercise of the
option, the option fee was to be credited towards the purchase price
of the premises, which was $375,000 and was payable on or before 15th
September 1977. 

 There
is a clause in the option agreement that, if the lease agreement or a
lease granted thereunder is determined for any reason whatsoever, the
option shall be void and of no effect. 

 Rent
under the lease agreement and instalments of option fee under the
option agreement were unpaid from 15th September 1975. 

 In
the defence it is recited that the defendant exercised the option by
letter of 13th June 1977. In that letter the defendant declared that
it was exercising the option to purchase under the option agreement
and it requested the plaintiff to forward particulars of its title
for approval of the defendant’s lawyers; and thereafter for
subsequent execution by the parties, a time (in September) and place
for which were suggested in the letter. 

 Neither
payment nor tender of the purchase price has been pleaded in the
defence and there is no evidence to support such a plea. 

 There
is an incorrect allegation in the defence that by letter dated 14th
June 1977, the defendant- 




‘ ...
called upon the plaintiff to accept payment of moneys due for rent
and moneys due on the said option but the plaintiff refused and still
refuses to conform.’ 




 483 

 The
statement in the letter is that the defendant was - 




‘ ...
not only ready and willing but also able to pay [the plaintiff] the
sum of $1500 per month as rent and $1000 per month towards an option
to purchase.’ 




 In
its reply thereto (dated 29th June 1977) the plaintiff wrote that it
was advised that the defendant was not entitled to exercise the
option - 




‘ ...
for the reason that no moneys have been received from [the defendant]
by way of option payments or otherwise, for more than twelve months.’ 




 This
contention was repeated in an affidavit by George Janoura sworn on
17th February 1978, on behalf of the plaintiff, and would no doubt be
restated in the reply to the defence and counterclaim if leave were
granted to deliver the same. 

 McMillan
J considered that this retort effectively demolished the defence,
when in his reasons for decision he wrote: 




‘ If
the defendant wished to keep the option alive it should have
continued making the monthly payments under the option agreement as
and when they fell due and that not having done so [he] has elected
to treat it as at an end. In the circumstances not having paid
either the rent due or the option instalments there can be no
possible defence based on the purported exercise of the option ... ‘ 




 The
nature of an option to purchase land is lucidly described in 23 Halsbury’s
Laws of England (3rd Edn) page 470, paragraph logo. I quote: 




‘ A
lease may confer upon the tenant an option to purchase the interest
of the landlord in the demised premises. This usually takes the form
of a covenant by the landlord that, if the tenant within a specified
period shall give to the landlord notice in writing of a specified
length of his desire to purchase the fee simple, or other the
interest of the landlord in the premises, the landlord will on
payment of a specified purchase price, and of any arrears of rent,
convey the demised premises to the tenant. Such an option is
collateral to, independent of, and not incidental to the relation of
the landlord and tenant. It is not therefore one of the terms which
will be incorporated in the terms of a yearly tenancy created by the
tenant holding over after the expiration of the original lease... 
An option to purchase creates an interest in land which vests on the
exercise of it and upon payment of the purchase money.’ 




 In Griffith v Pelton [1957] 3 All ER 75 at pages 83, 84, Jenkins LJ, who delivered the
judgment of the Court of Appeal, adverted to the nature of an option
to purchase land: 




‘ It
is by no means uncommon for leases to contain (as did the present
lease) provisions conferring on the lessee an option to purchase the 

 484 

 freehold.
 Options to purchase land are also, however, not uncommonly granted
in cases where the grantor and the grantee of the option do not stand
in the relationship of landlord and tenant. Options of the latter
class may conveniently be referred to as ‘options in gross’. An
option in gross for the purchase of land is a conditional contract
for such purchase by the grantee of the option from the grantor,
which the grantee is entitled to convert into a concluded contract of
purchase, and to have carried to completion by the grantor, on giving
the prescribed notice and otherwise complying with the conditions on
which the option is made exercisable in any particular case ... 

 An
option contained in a lease for the lessee to purchase the freehold
differs from an option in gross only in the respects that the grantor
and the grantee stand in the relationship of landlord and tenant, and
that the contract creating it is made part of the terms on which the
lease is granted. However, albeit collateral to the lease, it is in
itself a distinct contract possessing all the essential
characteristics of an option in gross.’ 




 From
the above statement of the law it is apparent that the option
agreement was a contract separate and distinct from the lease
agreement. 

 While
the defendant gave the prescribed notice, it did not comply with two
important conditions subject to which the option was made
exercisable. These were the payment each month of the instalments of
the option fee and the payment of the balance of the purchase price
on the exercise of the option. The defendant, therefore, did not in
law exercise the option and convert it into a concluded contract of
purchase, which the plaintiff could be compelled to carry to
completion (in the last resort by a court order for specific
performance of that contract). For the above reasons I am satisfied
that, on the present state of the pleadings, the plaintiff has made
out a good and complete cause of action and that the defence cannot
be sustained. 

 Before
McMillan J and this court there were submissions made by counsel for
the defendant by which he endeavoured to establish that there was
another defence or defences to this action. Let me examine the
evidence to see whether by an appropriate amendment of the pleadings
any of these matters can avail the defendant of an arguable defence. 

 The
chronicle of events begins with a notice to quit the premises on 31st
July 1975. This was served on the defendant by the plaintiff on 25th
June 1975. In a covering letter to the defendant dated 25th August
1975, Mr Janoura (a director of the plaintiff) enclosed a receipt for
$2500 “being rent for August 1975”, which was accepted without
prejudice to the notice to quit; and he threatened legal action if
the premises were not immediately vacated. In a reply thereto dated
28th August 1975, the defendant wrote: 




‘ We
hereby acknowledge receipt of your letter and receipt for rent dated
25th August 1975. 

 485 

 [The
defendant] holds you and/or Tiffany Glass Ltd liable for all damages
and consequential loss resulting from the determination of the lease
of the subject premises despite the fact we have observed and
performed all covenants and stipulations of the said lease. 

 We
have been trying almost on a daily basis to relocate our plant,
tackle and machinery elsewhere but, so far, we have not been able to
get alternative or other accommodation. 

 We
are continuing in our efforts to relocate and we hope to be able to
deliver up the subject premises to you at our earliest possible
opportunity.’ 




 The
writ in the first action for possession of the premises (filed on
31st October 1975) was based on the assumption that the defendant’s
tenancy had been determined by the notice to quit. Included therein
was a claim for $2500 representing one month’s arrears of rent and
for mesne profits at the rate of $2500 per month. 

 On
22nd January 1976, the plaintiff entered judgment in default of
defence in the first action. That judgment was set aside on 15th
June 1976 by Cross J, who, in compliance with the application by
summons in that behalf by the defendant, granted leave to the
defendant to defend the action. 

 To
an affidavit in support of the defendant’s summons by Gordon Farah,
one of its directors, sworn on 20th February 1976, there was annexed
a copy of the draft defence and counterclaim. Mr Farah deposed that
the defendant had duly paid the monthly rents and instalments of the
option fee; that it was advised that the notice to quit was
ineffective to determine the tenancy created by the lease agreement,
and that the defendant wished to counterclaim for damages for breach
of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. 

 In
the defence the defendant referred to the contents of the lease and
option agreements; it alleged that the notice to quit was not in
accordance with the lease agreement and that, contrary to the lease
and option agreements, the payment of the instalments of the option
fee had been purportedly treated by the plaintiff as rent after the
serving of the notice to quit. 

 In
the counterclaim the defendant asserted that the plaintiff had
wrongfully elected to treat the lease and option as at an end, in
consequence of which the defendant was forced to make arrangements to
remove its business from the premises and to seek alternative
accommodation, in respect of which it claimed damages (which
comprised special damage and damages for breach of the covenant for
quiet enjoyment). It also claimed a declaration that the monthly
rental of the premises was $1500 and a refund of money paid on
account of the option. Finally, it sought a declaration that the
defendant held the premises under and by virtue of the lease
agreement and the option. 

 Cross
J ordered the defendant to deliver its defence within three days; and
the plaintiff, if necessary, to deliver its reply to the defence and 

 486 

 counterclaim
within fourteen days. The defence and counterclaim were filed and
delivered on 20th February 1977. No reply was delivered. 

 On
2nd December 1977, simultaneously with the filing of the writ in the
present action, the plaintiff took out another summons in the first
action for leave to discontinue that action. That application was
opposed by the defendant; but leave was granted by McMillan J
immediately before he heard the present application. The defendant’s
counterclaim in the first action was not affected by that decision. 

 From
the above facts counsel for the defendant countered the application
by the plaintiff for summary judgment with the following
propositions. Cross J’s order giving leave to defend and to
counterclaim in the first action was res judicata and obliged McMillan J as a matter of course to grant similar leave
in the present action. This question was broached by Gordon Farah, a
director of the defendant, who on 1st February 1978 swore an
affidavit in opposition to that summons. In that affidavit it was
alleged that the action was frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of
the process of the court for the reasons that the relief claimed in
the first action, which was pending, was the same as that in the
present action, namely possession, arrears of rent and mesne profits;
and that Cross J had already ruled that the defendant had a good
defence to the first action. Nevertheless, there was no request that
on those grounds the action should be stayed or dismissed under Order
18, rule 19, of the RSC 1975. 

 McMillan
J, in rejecting this argument, pointed out that the basis of the
first action was a notice to quit, whereas in the present action it
was the determination of the tenancy by effluxion of time. 

 I
find that McMillan J was not obliged to grant leave to defend by
virtue of Cross J’s order in the first action being res judicata or creating an estoppel in the present action. The issue in the first action was whether the
notice to quit was bad in law because the defendant was lawfully in
possession under an extant term in the lease agreement, no step then
having been taken by the defendant to exercise its option. On the
other hand the question in the present action is whether, the lease
agreement having expired, the defendant’s possession is
unassailable for the reason that it had under the option agreement
validly exercised its option to buy the premises. 

 Moreover
as there has been no appeal against the grant of leave by the judge
to discontinue the plaintiff’s claim in the first action, there is
no longer a defence in the first action and the counterclaim is in
effect a statement of claim. 

 Another
possible line of defence in the present action which was explored
before us was that the defendant had in effect pleaded and was
entitled to specific performance; presumably as an alternative to its
claim for damages. In the defendant’s proposed counterclaim it
applied for a declaration that it was entitled to have the premises
assigned to it in accordance with the terms of the option. Counsel
for the the defendant submitted that this is tantamount to a claim
for specific performance of 

 487 

 a
contract to sell the premises concluded by the exercise of the
option. I do not agree. The declaration may be regarded as the base
or foundation for, and as complementary to, the claim for damages for
breach of the option agreement and/or the contract to purchase the
premises. The contract was said to have resulted from the offer set
out in the option agreement and its acceptance by the exercise of the
option. If valid, the contract entitled the defendant to an
assignment of the premises. But it elected instead to sue for
damages. 

 The
plea is not in the usual form for specific performance, examples of
which may be found in 37 Atkin’s
Court Forms (2nd Edn), pages 51, 55, Forms 13 and 17 and in Bullen, Leake and
Jacobs’s Precedents of Pleadings (12th Edn), pages 840, 844, Forms 517 and 521. There are no
allegations in the defence or counterclaim to support a claim for the
relief of specific performance and no direct request for that remedy. 

 The
agreement to be performed must be the agreement to purchase the
premises which for its coming into existence is dependent on the
valid exercise of the option. At the date of the issue of the writ
the defendant was not entitled to have the premises assigned to it in
accordance with the terms of the option agreement since the time
limit for complying with those terms had expired on 15th June 1977. 
The defendant is therefore not entitled to the declaration to that
effect prayed for in its counterclaim. 

 In
any event the court would refuse the equitable remedy of specific
performance to a petitioner who is in breach of his obligation at or
before the exercise of the option to pay, or even to tender, the
balance of the purchase price due and payable, not to mention the
arrears of rent, unpaid in breach of the lease agreement. 

 Finally,
the argument was advanced that the defendant was,excused from making
further payments under the lease and option agreements because it
could be inferred that the plaintiff has repudiated those agreements,
firstly by the service of the notice to quit (which treated the
defendant as a monthly tenant) and its sequel in the writ of the
first action; and, secondly, by the issue of the receipt solely for
rent. The plaintiff’s rejoinder in this regard, with which I
agree, was that the defendant elected to accept the repudiation in
the first instance by its letter of 28th August and thereafter by its
defence and counterclaim in the first action. 

 I
shall now outline the principles of law applicable to an option
incorporated in a lease and the remedies for its repudiation or
renunciation with special reference to this action. Repudiation of a
contract by a party thereto does not: automatically bring an end to
the contract. Where, as in this case, the allegation is that there
was a renunciation or repudiation of the lease and option agreements
by one of the parties before performance was respectively completed
or due, the contract is not ipso facto discharged and terminated by the breach. The innocent party must
make his election. He may accept the repudiation of the agreement by
the other party and treat the contract as at an end; 

 488 

 whereupon
both parties are discharged and excused from further performance, and
the innocent party’s sole remedy is damages for breach of contract.
 Alternatively, the innocent party may insist on the continuation of
the contract; in which event both parties must carry on with the
performance of the contract by observing their respective obligations
thereunder. 

 Winn
J set out the applicable principles of law in Denmark Productions Ltd v Boscobel Productions Ltd [1968] All ER 513 at page 527: 




‘ It
seems to me that the process of ending or indeed of varying a
contract by repudiation is the converse of that of making the same
contract; each process operates by offer and acceptance, or their
equivalents; each is essentially bilateral. Where A and B are
parties to an executory contract, if A intimated by word or conduct
that he no longer intends, or is unable, to perform it, or to perform
it in a particular manner, he is, in effect, making an offer to B to
treat the contract as dissolved or varied so far as it relates to the
future. If B elects to treat the contract as thereby repudiated, he
is deemed, according to the language of many decided cases, to
‘accept the repudiation’ and is thereupon entitled: (a) to sue
for damages in respect of ally earlier breach committed by A for
damages in respect of the repudiation: (b) to refrain from himself
performing the contract any further.’ 




 Under
and in accordance with a lease agreement from the respondent, the
appellant in Australian Hardwoods Pty Ltd Commissioner for Railways [1961] 1 All ER 737 served on the respondent a three months’ notice
to purchase a sawmill. Before the expiry of that period the
respondent gave to the appellant notice terminating the agreement for
breaches which were admitted. If the appellant purchased the sawmill
it was, under clause 9(c) of the agreement, entitled on request to a
transfer of the respondent’s occupation permit and sawmill licence.
 The Full Court of Australia concluded that the appellant had not
succeeded in exercising the option, because of the termination of the
agreement by notice before payment of the purchase price was made. 
Delivering the advice of the Privy Council that the appeal should be
dismissed, Lord Radcliffe declared (at page 741) that events had
occurred before the date of payment which had brought about a
fundamental alteration in the position of the parties and of their
respective rights and liabilities under the agreement. He went on to
say (at page 742): 




‘ Long
before the trial took place the agreement was at an end, and no-one
could recall it into existence ... 

 It
follows therefore that if the appellant had fallen into default
through breaches of the agreement, and by so doing had brought down
on itself the notice of termination, the respondent was by that fact
discharged from compliance with a clause such as clause 9(c) 

 489 

 which
was essentially part of a working scheme that had by then become
abortive.’ 




 He
continued also (at page 742): 




‘ A
plaintiff who asks the court to enforce by mandatory order in his
favour some stipulation of an agreement which itself consists of
inter-dependent undertakings between the plaintiff and the defendant
cannot succeed in obtaining such relief if he is at the time in
breach of his own obligations. ‘ 




 The
consequences of adopting the renunciation of a contract were
expatiated upon by Lord Esher MR in Johnstone v Milling (1886) 16 QBD 460 at page 476: 




‘ A
renunciation of a contract, or, in other words, a total refusal to
perform it by one party before the time for performance arrives, does
not, by itself, amount to a breach of contract but may be so acted
upon and adopted by the other party as a rescission of the contract
as to give an immediate right of action. When one party assumes to
renounce the contract, that is, by anticipation refuses to perform
it, he thereby, so far as he is concerned, declares his intention
then and there to rescind the contract... The other party may adopt
such renunciation of the contract by so acting upon it as in effect
to declare that he too treats the contract as at an end, except for
the purpose of bringing an action upon it for the damages sustained
by him in consequence of such renunciation’; 




 and
Cotton LJ (at page 76) referred to the alternative situation where
the promises does not accept the renunciation and thereby loses his
right to claim damages: 




‘ The
promisee, if he pleases, may treat the notice of intention as
inoperative, and await the time when the contract is to be executed,
and then hold the other party responsible for all the consequences of
non-performance; but in that case he keeps the contract alive for the
benefit of the other party as well as his own; he remains subject to
all the obligations and liabilities under it, and enables the other
party not only to complete the contract, if so advised,
notwithstanding his previous repudiation of it, but also to take
advantage of any supervening circumstance which would justify him in
declining to complete it ...’ 




 The
conclusion I have arrived at is that there is no substance in law in
any of these alternative submissions or in the matters which have not
been pleaded, and that no amendment of the pleadings would provide
the defendant with a triable issue which would entitle it to leave to
defend in the present action. 

 With
regard to the defence that was actually pleaded, the option 

 490 

 agreement
being a separate contract from the lease agreement (irrespective of
whether the latter was discharged for breach before 14th September
1977 or remained in force until that date (as pleaded)), the
plaintiff can legitimately maintain that the option was lost by the
defendant’s omission to pay the option instalments due at and after
15th September 1975. 

 In
any event the defendant was deprived of that option when it failed to
pay or to tender the balance of the purchase price on or before 15th
June 1977. The balance is substantial. It amounts at least to
$363,000, the difference between $375,000 and the maximum $12,000
paid on account of the option fee. If the defendant were entitled to
a transfer of the premises he would have the interest-free use of,
and the plaintiff would have been denied interest on, that amount
from 14th June 1977 to the date of payment at some time in the
future. 

 My
decision is that the statement of claim is not defective for
non-compliance with Order 6, rule 2(1)( c );
that the plaintiff has made out a good and complete cause of action;
that the defence pleaded cannot succeed in as much as the defendant’s
purported exercise of the option to purchase the premises was
abortive; and that there is no other issue or question to be tried
and no arguable defence to the action. 

 I
would allow the appeal, dismiss the cross-appeal, and order the
defendant to deliver up possession of the premises to the plaintiff. 
I would also order the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $36,000
arrears of rent, mesne profits at the rate of $1500 per month from
15th September 1977 to the date of delivery of possession of the
premises, as well as the plaintiff’s taxed costs of the appeal and
cross-appeal and of the proceedings before McMillan J. 

 Sir
Isaac Hyatali CJ. I agree with the orders proposed by Corbin and Kelsick JJA that the
plaintiffs appeal be allowed and the defendant’s cross-appeal be
dismissed with costs, and with the further order that leave be
granted to the plaintiff to enter final judgment in the terms of its
claim. 

 The
reasons for my agreement with these orders follow. It is clear to me
from the points raised on the claim for recovery of possession in the
instant case (the second action) that they have a direct bearing on
the circumstances attending the issue of the writ of summons on 31st
October 1975 (the first action) and vice versa .
 The facts contained in the affidavits filed in the first action by
the plaintiff and the defendant, respectively, furnish the back
ground to the contest between them; and I am satisfied that they were
admitted by consent at the hearing of the plaintiff’s summons
applying for leave in the second action to enter final judgment. 
Kelsick JA has narrated these facts in some detail and I shall
accordingly refer only briefly to those which are necessary for the
purpose of setting out my reasons. 

 The
oral agreements for the lease and the option to purchase were made on
or about 9th September 1974. the defendant entered into possession
of the premises in pursuance thereof and installed plant and 

 491 

 Machinery
for the purpose of its business. The oral agreements were reduced to
writing thereafter and submitted to the defendant for execution in
the same month (September 1974), but up to June 1975 the defendant
had failed to execute them or return them to the plaintiff. In the
meanwhile, however, the defendant paid the rent of $1500 reserved
under the oral agreement for the lease and the fee of $1000 reserved
under the oral agreement for the option. 

 By
reason of the failure of the defendant to execute the written
agreement the plaintiff wrongly proceeded to regard the oral
agreements for the lease and the option as ineffective and void. It
was under the influence of that error that the plaintiff treated the
defendant as a monthly tenant and purported to determine the tenancy
by serving on it (on 25th June 1975) a month’s notice to quit the
premises on 31st July 1975. 

 On
the expiry of that notice the defendant continued in possession. It
then tendered to the plaintiff the rent and option fee of $2500 due
under the oral agreements for the month of August. The plaintiff,
however, appropriated the whole of that sum as rent for the premises
for August 1975, and issued a receipt stating that it was without
prejudice to the notice to quit of 25th June 1975. The plaintiff
sent that receipt to the defendant under cover of a letter dated 25th
August 1975. In it the plaintiff reminded the defendant of its
failure to vacate the premises and requested it to deliver possession
immediately, in order to avoid the necessity of legal action in the
matter. 

 At
that stage, therefore, the plaintiff had unequivocally repudiated the
oral agreements for the lease and the option. That repudiation was
re-affirmed by the issue of its writ for possession on 31st October
1975 (the first action) and the allegation in the statement of claim
indorsed thereon that the defendant’s tenancy had been determined
by the notice to quit of 25th June 1975. 

 The
defendant on its part clearly elected to accept the repudiation when
it wrote the plaintiff on 28th August 1975 stating, inter alia, that
it was holding the plaintiff liable for all damage and consequential
loss flowing from the determination of the lease agreement and that
it hoped to deliver up possession of the premises at its earliest
opportunity. The defendant then reinforced its election by ceasing
to tender any rent or option fee after September 1975. 

 This
unambiguous stance assumed by the defendant was fortified by its
application for leave (which was granted) to defend the first action
and to counterclaim for damages for breach of the oral agreement for
the lease and, most significantly, for a refund of all moneys paid
under the oral agreement for the option. 

 It
is true that it sought declarations at the same time to the effect
that it held the premises under an oral agreement for a lease and at
a rental of $1500 per month; but it is manifest from the
circumstances that the declarations were sought for the sole porpose
of providing the formula for the quantification of the damages for
which it had elected to sue and 

 492 

 not
to found a claim for specific performance which, rather curiously, it
omitted altogether to seek. 

 In
my judgment it is an inescapable conclusion from these facts that the
oral agreements for the lease and the option had ceased to exist
between the parties from 28th August 1975; and that the only
outstanding questions between them from that date related to damages
and the refund of the option moneys paid under the latter agreement;
see Denmark Productions Ltd v Boscobel Productions Ltd [1968] 3 All ER 513 at page 527 per Winn J, and Cheshire&amp;Fifoot on the Law of Contract (9th Edn) pages 573, 574, 576. 

 Matters
stood still between them thereafter until 15th June 1977. On that
date the defendant purported to exercise the option reserved under
the oral agreement. It was a futile exercise, however, since the
option (as I have already demonstrated) had ceased to exist on 28th
August 1975. 

 The
next development in the dealings between them occurred on 4th
November 1977 when the plaintiff commenced the second action by
issuing a writ indorsed with a statement of claim containing (after
it was amended) the following allegations and claims: 




‘ 1
By an oral agreement for a lease which was reduced to writing in
September 1974 the plaintiff let to the defendant the premises
situate at and known as Lot 7, Diamond Vale Industrial Estate,
Diamond Vale, in the ward of Diego Martin for a term of three years
from 15th September 1974 at a monthly rent of $1500 payable in
advance on the 15th day of each and every month. 

 2
The said term expired on 14th September 1977. 

 3
The defendant failed to deliver up possession of the said premises on
14th September 1977 and still remains in possession. 

 4
Further, the defendant has not paid the monthly rent which fell due
on the 15th day of each month from 15th September 1975 to date, or
any part thereof. 

 5
And the plaintiff claims: (1) possession of the said premises; (2)
$36,000 arrears of rent; and (3) mesne profits at the rate of $1500
per month from 15th September 1977 to the date of delivery of
possession.’ 




 It
is evident from this writ and the statement of claim indorsed thereon
that the plaintiff based its claim for possession on the expiry of an
oral agreement for a lease which had ceased to exist on 28th August
1975. The plaintiff’s summons for leave to enter final judgment
was opposed by the defendant, who sought leave to defend the second
action on the grounds set out in his affidavits to the following
effect: (a) that the second action was an abuse of the process of the
court since the plaintiff was claiming the same relief therein as in
the first action and in which the defendant had obtained
unconditional leave to defend and counterclaim; and (b) that in any
event the defendant was entitled to remain in possession in pursuance
of an option which it had properly exercised on 

 493 

 15th
June 1977, under the oral agreement made in that behalf. 

 The
defendant also sought leave to counterclaim for damages for breach of
contract and a declaration that it was entitled to have the premises
assigned to it in accordance with the terms of the option which it
claimed it had duly exercised. 

 It
is important to note that the defendant did not deny the allegation
that the plaintiff had entered into an oral agreement for a lease of
the premises for three years from 15th September 1974 and that it had
expired on 14 September 1977. On the contrary, in paragraph 1 of the
draft defence attached to the affidavit of Gordon Farah (a director
of the defendant) filed in support of its application for leave to
defend, it was pleaded that: 




‘ The
defendant admits so much of paragraph 1 of the statement of claim as
alleges and/or implies the existence of a lease of Lot 7, Diamond
Vale Industrial Estate and no more.’ 




 By
common consent therefore the oral agreement for the lease which had
ceased to exist on 28th August 1975 was revived by the parties. The
defendant confirmed this revival by admitting at the hearing that it
owed the arrears of rent of $36,000 claimed by the plaintiff. But
for this revival of the oral agreement for the lease, it would have
been incompetent for the plaintiff, in my view, to found his claim
for possession on the expiry of the lease on 15th September 1977. 

 There
was no similar consensus ,
however, on the oral agreement for the option. This option, as
Kelsick JA has pointed out in his judgement, was a contract separate
and distinct from the lease agreement. It cannot be said therefore
that the option was an integral part of the lease (as counsel for the
defendant contended) and was consequently also revived by the common
consent of the parties. It follows that the defendant could not
validly exercise an option on 15th June 1977 when it had ceased to
exist on 28th August 1975. The defendant cannot in these
circumstances rely on the exercise of the option to obtain leave to
defend the second action, nor to counterclaim for a declaration that
it is entitled to have the premises assigned to it in accordance
therewith. 

 At
the hearing of the summons for leave to enter final judgment counsel
for the defendant objected to the validity of the writ in the second
action on the ground that it omitted to state in the indorsement that
the plaintiff’s right to possession was not subject to statutory
restriction as is required by the Rules of the Supreme Court, Order
6, rule 2(1)( c ).
 The trial judge quite rightly ruled that the fresh steps taken in
the action by the defendant with knowledge of the irregularity
disqualified it from objecting to the validity of the writ. Both
Corbin and Kelsick JJA have rightly upheld the ruling of the judge on
this point and I do not wish to add anything to their reasons for so
doing. 

 The
judge also ruled that no reasonable defence was disclosed to the
claim for possession; but, notwithstanding that conclusion, he
dismissed the plaintiff’s application for judgment holding (a) that
the statement of 

 494 

 claim
indorsed on the writ was defective for want of a statement therein
that the premises were free from statutory restriction; (b) that by
reason of that deficiency the claim was not good and complete in
itself; and (c) that an affidavit verifying the facts of such a good
and complete claim was lacking. 

 Counsel
for the plaintiff challenged these conclusions contending that the
judge erred in failing to take into account that the proceedings in
the first action (which were admitted by consent in the second
action) contained not only the statement required by Order 6, rule
2(1)( c ),
but also an admission by the defendant that the premises were free
from statutory restriction. It was submitted that these proceedings
supplied the omission contained in the writ. It was further
submitted that the judge’s ruling that this defect in the statement
of claim could only be cured by an amendment was inconsistent with
his ruling that the defect in the indorsement on the writ was cured
by the fresh steps taken in the action. 

 An
affidavit in support of an application for judgment under Order 14,
rule 1, must comply with the provisions of Order 14, rule 2. Hence
the affidavit must (a) verify the facts on which the claim is based;
and (b) contain a statement of the deponent’s belief that there is
no defence to the claim or part thereof in respect of which the
application is made. One of the fundamental purposes of the rule is
to allow proof by affidavit evidence of the facts alleged in the
statement of claim. Being evidence it cannot be employed to correct
or supply any defect or omission in the writ or statement of claim. 

 This
principle, which was enunciated in Gold Ores Reduction Co Ltd v Parr [1892] 2 QB 14 has remained unaffected both under the English rules
and Rules of the Supreme Court 1975. In that case a
specially-indorsed writ claimed against the defendant instalments of
shares in the plaintiff company payable under the terms of an
allotment and interest at 10 per cent per annum from the date of the
writ to the date of payment. However, the affidavit in support of
the application for summary judgment showed that the interest of 10
per cent claimed was due under an agreement contained in the articles
of association; but this fact was not pleaded in the statement of
claim. Leave to sign judgment was refused. It was held that, as the
writ did not show that interest was payable under the agreement, a
good special indorsement was lacking; and that the allegation in the
affidavit could not be used to supply the omission in the indorsement
on the writ. 

 In
the second action herein, the statement of claim constituted the
indorsement on the writ. As an indorsement, therefore, the defect
was capable of being cured by a fresh step taken in the action by the
defendant but, as a statement of claim, a defect in its sufficiency
as such could not be so cured. 

 And
as the principle enunciated in the Gold Ores case shows, the affidavit being evidence by which the facts alleged
in the statement of claim is proved, it cannot be used to cure a
defect in the sufficiency 

 495 

 thereof.
 The real question for decision therefore is whether the statement of
claim failed to disclose a good and complete cause of action. In my
judgment it did not fail to do so and the judge erred in so holding. 
The plaintiff established by the verification of the facts in its
statement of claim, a right to possession of the premises; and all
that was necessary to enforce that right thereafter was an assurance
to the court that the premises were not subject to statutory
restriction. Note in this connection the expression “right to
possession” in Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ).
 Such an assurance was necessary to avoid the making of an order in
vain; but it was not essential to the sufficiency of the statement of
claim. In other words, the assurance required was a matter for
evidence and not of pleading. In the result, the proceedings in the
first action, having furnished the assurance needed for the purpose
of Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
leave should have been granted to the plaintiff to enter final
judgment. In this connection I agree with the conclusions at which
Corbin and Kelsick JJA have arrived on the sufficiency of the
statement of claim and the reasons they have given for them. 

 I
am of opinion for these reasons that the trial judge was wrong to
hold that an amendment to the statement of claim was necessary to
make it good and complete. In the course of his submissions counsel
for the plaintiff applied for an amendment to his pleading if it was
necessary for that purpose but, in my view, it was not. On the other
hand if it were, I am quite satisfied from the circumstances of the
case that it would have been just and convenient to grant it. 

 Counsel
for the plaintiff contended at one stage that for the purposes of
Order 6, rule 2(1)( c ),
the court ought to take judicial note of the fact that the premises
were not subject to the control of the Rent Restriction ordinance by
reason of the fact that the Industrial Development (Corporation, the
head lessor of the premises in this case, did not come into existence
until after 1954 (the year when new buildings were freed from such
control). I do not agree that this court can do so. To take
judicial notice of that fact as suggested would constitute, in my
judgment, an unwarranted extension of, or departure from, the
principles applicable to judicial notice. The orders of the court
will accordingly be in the terms proposed in the judgments which have
preceded mine.

 Held that T was entitled to a declaration that his constitutional right
under section 2( c )(ii)
had been contravened because - 

 (1)
The rights and freedoms set out in section 2( a )
to ( h )
of the 1962 Constitution spelt out in detail (but not necessarily
exhaustively) the rights to “due process of law” and “the
protection of the law” guaranteed in section 1 ( a )
and ( b )
as rights which were enjoyed by the people of Trinidad and Tobago
before the commencement of the Constitution; but it was neither
necessary nor permissible when construing section 2 to resort to a
consideration of the law as it stood at the commencement of the
Constitution in order to determine whether any limit upon the
freedoms expressed in section 2 was intended to be preserved. 

 (2)
Section 1 (inter alia) converted rights and freedoms which had 

 498 

 previously
been enjoyed by the private citizen de facto into rights and freedoms which were to be enjoyed as of legal right,
except so far as (by section 3) the exercise of such rights and
freedoms would be contrary to a mandatory provision of a law existing
at the commencement of the Constitution; it had not been shown that
any such existing law restricted the right of access of a prisoner to
his lawyer when the processes of investigation and the administration
of justice would not be delayed or hindered thereby. 

 (3)
The words “without delay” in section 2( c )(ii)
connoted not simply a lapse of time but one which, in the
circumstances, was longer than it should have been. 

 (4)
A police officer in carrying out his duties in relation to the
maintenance of order, the detection and apprehension of offenders and
the bringing of them before a judicial authority acted as a public
officer carrying out an essential executive function and,
accordingly, his actions were susceptible to redress under section 6.

 Appeal 

 Appeal Wilfred Allman and other police officers and the Attorney-General
(the respondents) appealed to the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and
Tobago (civil appeal 39 of 1974) from a declaration made by Georges J
((1974) 27 WIR 281) that the constitutional rights of Terrence
Thornhill under section 2( c )
(ii) of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago 1962 had been
infringed and Terrence Thornhill cross-appealed for a variation of
the order made by Georges J.

 Cur
adv vult. 

 Sir
Isaac Hyatali CJ. I agree with conclusion of Rees JA and the reason he has given in
support of it. Out of deference, however, to the illuminating
submission of counsel on both sides and, in particular, to the
instructive and well-reasoned judgment of Georges J I add a few words
of my own on one of the main aspects of the case. The application
herein was made under section 6 of the Constitution granted to this
country on 31st August 1962 (the “1962 Constitution”) and I would
state merely for the record that this was superseded by the
Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on 1st August
1976 and that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in both
Constitutions are the same in every respect. 

 In
his judgement the judge anticipated to some extent the decision of
the Privy Council in De Freitas v Benny (1975) 27 WIR 318 per Lord Diplock, by holding that (Thornhill
v Attorney-General (1974) 27 WIR 281 at page 285) that - 




‘ the
rights mentioned in section 2( c )(i)
- (iv) have been regarded by the Constitution-makers as specific
examples of the rights proclaimed in section 1 [of the 1962
Constitution. 




 Actually,
Lord Diplock’s dictum embraced a wider area since its effect may be stated to be that all
the rights enumerated in paragraphs ( a )
to ( h )
of section 2 are no more than further and better particulars of the
rights specified in paragraphs ( a )
and ( b )
of section 1. 

 The
right under consideration here is the right to retain and instruct a
legal adviser at the pre-trial stage of proceedings against an
accused. (Georges J held that the right had existed at common law
and that, even if it had not, that right now exists because of its
recital by Parliament in section 2. 

 If
by its recital the 1962 Constitution created this right then it must
be taken as a new right. So to hold, however, would conflict with
Lord Diplock’s dictum in De Freitas v Benny that section 2 does not create any new rights additional to those
specified in section 1. 

 On
the other hand, if it is embraced in one of the rights specified in
section 1 then it must be read subject to section 3 which prescribes
that sections 1 and 2 “shall not apply in relation to any law that
is in force in Trinidad and Tobago at the commencement of the 1962
Constitution”. 

 I
have been unable to find in the dicta of judges of the past to which the judge referred or in any of the
authorities to which I have (or have been) referred that the right
under reference existed at common law. On 

 500 

 the
contrary, they all point the other way See, for example, 9 Holdsworth’s
History of the Common Law ,
pages 222 et seq, Galos
Hired v R 441 AC 149, section 1 of the Treason Act 1965 and section 3 of the
Prisoners Counsel Act 1863. In my judgment neither the common law
nor any statute conferred any such right at the pre-trial stage on an
accused person It follows that the law in force on 31st August 1962
was that no-one had such a right and that, as such, the right
referred to in the Constitution must be read subject to section 3 of
the Constitution In other words, the common law that there was no
such right prevailed over the right claimed by Thornhill. 

 The
judge would appear to have been conscious of this point; but
hedismissed it by saying that the onus was on the State to show that
there was a law existing at the date of the Constitution which
qualified that right, but that the State advanced no such argument
being content to argue that there was no right at common law as
defined in section 2( c )(iii).
 The absence of any argument on the point, however, did not conclude
the question under reference. If, as I hold, there was no such right
and that was the law at the commencement of the Constitution, then
the right claimed by Thornhill must be read subject to section 3 and,
accordingly, be rejected With respect to the Judges’ Rules on this
question it is only necessary to say that they are not rules of law
but rules for the guidance of the police in the investigation of
ciminal conduct. This, however, is another question altogether and
does not fall for consideration in these proceedings. 

 Corbin
JA. I have had the opportunity of reading the judgments of Sir Isaac
Hyatali CJ and Rees JA. I agree entirely and there is nothing I can
usefully add. 

 Rees
JA. At about 1.00 p m on Wednesday, 17th October 1973, Assistant
Commissioner Burroughs of the Trinidad Police Force headed combined
party of policemen and soldiers of the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment
on an exercise which led to a house situate at Riverside Road,
Curepe. On arrival, an incident described as “a shoot-out”
occurred between members of the police party and the occupants of the
house, resulting in the death of Guy Harewood and the arrest of
Terrence Thornhill who was charged for shooting with intent to
murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of
ammunition. At the time of his arrest Thornhill was wanted by the
police for questioning in connection with a number of other serious
crimes, mainly shootings and robberies, alleged to have been
committed in various parts of the country He was taken to St Joseph
police station and there detained. 

 On
hearing of his arrest Thornhill’s father immediately retained on
his behalf the services of Mr Stanley John, a barrister-at-law. At
5.30 p m on the same day Mr John went to the station and was allowed
to speak for five minutes with Thornhill, who at the time was
handcuffed on one side to another prisoner and on the other to a
bench In that situation 

 501 

 he
was unable to speak privately with his legal adviser. On the
following morning, Mr John returned to the station and sought
permission of Superintendent George, a senior officer of the North
Eastern Division, to see his client. In refusing the request
Superintendent George said that Thornhill had been brought to the
station on very serious charges and, at that stage, an interview with
a lawyer was likely to impede the progress of the police
investigations. Thereupon, Mr John spoke by telephone to Assistant
Commissioner Burroughs, who promised to give instructions that he
should be allowed to see Thornhill at 5.00 pm. At about 5.15 pm, Mr
John (accompanied by Mr Wayne Smart, solicitor) returned to St Joseph
police station; but Superintendent Whitehead, the officer in charge,
refused to allow him to speak with Thornhill. On 19th October 1973,
Thornhill was taken to the Criminal investigation Department at
police headquarters in Port-of-Spain. Mr John made another attempt
to see his client; but on this occasion Superintendent Allman told
him that investigations had reached a stage where any interview
between Thornhill and his legal adviser would impede the police
investigations. The next day Mr John returned to police headquarters
and was permitted to see Thornhill for about two minutes; but not to
speak with him as the police were about to conduct identification
parades. Later that day (at about 12.30 p m), he was allowed to
speak with Thornhill who, by then, had been charged with eighteen
offences and had given several written statements to the police. 

 By
an amended notice of motion brought before the High Court under the
provisions of section 6 of the Second Schedule to the Trinidad and
Tobago (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, (hereinafter referred to
as “the 1962 Constitution”) Thornhill sought: 




‘ 1.
A declaration that the prevention of, and hindrance and denial to,
[Thornhill] while being arrested and detained between 1.30 p m on
Wednesday, 17th October 1973, and 12.45 p m on Saturday, 20th October
1973, from retaining and/or instructing a legal adviser of his own
choice and/or from holding consultation with him constitutes a
contravention in relation to [Thornhill] of his right thereto
guaranteed and protected by the Constitution. 

 2.
A declaration that all matters and things which may have transpired
in relation to [Thornhill] and in particular all statements oral or
written which may have been given by, or taken from, [Thornhill]
while he was so under arrest and in detention are illegal,
unconstitutional, ultra
vires ,
null and void and of 110 effect. 

 3.
An order: (a) restraining the respondents and each of them from in
any way making use of any one or more of such statements in any
prosecutions and/or proceedings whatsoever in relation to [Thornhill]
or otherwise; (b) directing that all such written statements be
handed up and delivered over to- the court for destruction; (c)
directing that no use whatsoever be made of any such statements oral
or written in 

 502 

 any
prosecutions and/or proceedings in relation to [Thornhill] or in
which [Thornhill] might be concerned.’ 




 Thornhill
named the Registrar of the Supreme Court and certain police officers
(including senior Superintendent Allman, Superintendent George and
Assistant Superintendent Whitehead) as respondents. In accordance
with section 13 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1962, notice
of the questions arising in these proceedings was given to the
Attorney-General who exercised his right of appearing by counsel. 

 On
31st May 1974, Georges J made the following declaration: 




‘ It
is declared that the denial to [Thornhill] while under arrest and
detention between 1.30 p m on Wednesday, 17th October 1973, and 12.45
p m on Saturday, 20th October 1973, of an opportunity to instruct and
consult with counsel of his choice constituted a contravention in
relation to [Thornhill] of his right there to guaranteed and
protected by the Constitution.’ 




 The
judge declined, however, to make the other orders prayed for in
paragraphs 2 and 3 of the amended notice of motion. From this
decision the Attorney-General and the police officers named as
respondents appealed and by a respondent’s notice dated 3rd April
1975, Thornhill gave notice that he would contend on the appeal that
the order of 31st May 1974 should be varied to include the orders
sought in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the amended notice of motion. During
the hearing of the appeal, however, he abandoned this contention. 

 There
was a great deal of discussion as to whether under the common law of
England (which has been preserved in this country) a person in
custody had the right to instruct without delay his legal adviser and
hold communication with him. The trial judge held that such a right
existed at common law because the other rights mentioned in section 2
of the 1962 Constitution have their roots in the common law, and it
would be strange if (alone of this bundle of related rights in that
section) the rights of a person in custody to instruct and
communicate with his legal adviser had no root in the common law. 
The trial judge further pointed out that the Royal Commission on
Police Powers in England (1929) affirmed the existence of such a
right and that Gerald Abrahams in his booklet Police Questioning and Judges’ Rules (1964) at page 40, states that the principle that one should be able
to communicate and consult privately with a solicitor at any stage of
an investigation (even if one is in custody) was a right which
existed at common law. Even if such a right did not so exist,
concluded the judge, the 1962 Constitution had proclaimed that the
right has always existed in Trinidad and Tobago and that it should
continue to exist. 

 Mr
Wooding, senior counsel for Thornhill, in supporting the judge’s
views submitted that the right of a person in custody to instruct his
legal adviser and hold communication with him existed at common law,
but, even if it did not exist, it was a right which was given by the
1962 Constitution and the non-existence of a rule in that behalf at
common 

 503 

 law
could not be enough to oust the positive provisions of the 1962
Constitution. Consequently, whether or not there was such a right at
common law, Thornhill is entitled to avail himself of the rights as
prescribed in section 2( c )(ii)
of the 1962 Constitution. 

 The
Solicitor-General, for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted
that no such right has ever existed either at common law, by statute
or by the 1962 Constitution. He stated that, in the light of section
12 of the Judicature Act 1962 and Section 3 of the 1962 Constitution,
section 2( c )(ii)
does not grant or affect to grant such a right. But that if the
right is caught by the “due process” provision of section 1( a )
of the 1962 Constitution, then that right should be construed as
arising only at such time after a detained person had been formally
charged by the court because it is only at that stage that adversary
proceedings begin. 

 Let
me say at the outset that I have not been able to find any judicial
pronouncement or enunciation to the effect that a person in custody
at the pre-trial or interrogation1 stage had, at common law, a right
to instruct and communicate with his legal adviser. Nor has any
conclusive authority been produced to this court from which I am able
to derive assistance on the matter. It is enough to say that, on the
view that I take of this case, the point does not arise for decision. 

 I
trust that I am doing no injustice to the lengthy submissions of
counsel on both sides; but, as I see it, the crucial question for
decision in this matter is whether the actions of the police officers
(in the circumstances I have outlined above) entitled Thornhill to
the declaration which he obtained as a result of the application he
made under section 6 of the 1962 Constitution which, so far as
relevant, reads: 




‘ (1)
For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that if any person
alleges that any of the provisions of the foregoing sections or
section 7 of this Constitution has been, is being, or is likely to be
contravened in relation to him, then without prejudice to any other
action with respect to the same matter which is lawfully available,
that person may apply to the High Court for redress. 

 (2)
The High Court shall have original jurisdiction - ( a )
to hear and determine any application made by any person in pursuance
of subsection (1) of this section; ... 

 and
may make such orders, issue such writs and give such directions as it
may consider appropriate for the purpose of enforcing, or securing
the enforcement of, any of the provisions of the said foregoing
sections or section 7 to the protection of which the person concerned
is entitled.’ 




 Trinidad
and Tobago is one of the newly-independent countries of the
Commonwealth which adopted a constitutional system of government
based on what has been aptly described as “the Westminster model”.
 These written Constitutions usually contain1 a chapter providing for
the limitation of parliamentary sovereignty, guarantees of
fundamental 

 504 

 human
rights and judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation. 
It was such a chapter that Lord Diplock described in the Privy
Council case of Hinds v R (1975) 24 WIR 326 at page 332, from Jamaica, where he said: 




‘ The
more recent Constitutions on the Westminster model, unlike their
earlier prototypes, include a chapter dealing with fundamental rights
and freedoms. The provisions of this chapter form part of the
substantive law of the State and until amended by whatever special
procedure is laid down in the Constitution for this purpose, impose a
fetter on the exercise by the legislature, the executive and the
judiciary of the plenitude of their respective powers.’ 




 The
chapter of the 1962 Constitution dealing with fundamental rights and
freedoms is Chapter 1. It contains eight sections. Section 1
enumerates a list of fundamental rights and freedoms in general
terms. Among them are the right to respect for private and family
life, the right to equality of treatment from public authorities, the
right to join political parties and express political views and the
parental right of choice of education, followed by the fundamental
freedoms of movement, of conscience, and of association, all basic
and natural rights inherent in the individual. In particular,
section 1( a )
and ( b )
provides as follows: 




‘ It
is hereby recognised and declared that in Trinidad and Tobago there
have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by
reason of race, origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human
rights and fundamental freedoms, namely- 

 ( a )
the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person
and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof
except by due process of law; 

 ( b )
the right of the individual to equality before the law and the
protection of the law.’ 




 Section
2 provides (inter alia) as follows: 




‘ Subject
to the provisions of sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Constitution, no law
shall abrogate, abridge or infringe or authorise the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights and freedoms here in
before recognised and declared and in particular no Act of Parliament
shall - ... 

 ( c )
deprive a person who has been arrested or detained ... (ii) of the
right to retain and instruct without delay a legal adviser of his own
choice and to hold communication with him.’ 




 It
will be observed that section 2, after prescribing that no law shall
abrogate, abridge or infringe, or authorise the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights and freedoms
recognised and declared in section 1, clearly sets out specific
prohibitions upon what may be done by future Acts of Parliament, one
of which is to the effect that no future Act of Parliament shall
deprive a person in custody of the 

 505 

 right
to retain and instruct without delay a legal adviser of his own
choice and to hold communication with him. Section 36 of the 1962
Constitution gave power to the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago to
make laws for the peace, order and good government of the country;
but those powers “as in the case of all countries with written
Constitutions, must be exercised in accordance with the terms of the
Constitution from which the power derives” ( per Lord Pearce delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council in Liyanage v R [1966] 1 All ER 650 at page 657). Accordingly, if section 2 of the
1962 Constitution confers certain rights on individuals and lays down
certain prohibitions on the legislature, it is the duty of this court
(in any given case) to decide whether any of those rights has been
violated by the legislature in relation to an individual seeking
redress under section of the 1962 Constitution. 

 The
nature of the rights in section 2 has been described in the case of De Freitas v Benny (1974) 26 WIR 523 (which went to the Privy Council from this country,
(1975) 27 WIR 318) by Lord Diplock who gave the decision of the Board
when he made it abundantly clear that the specific prohibitions in
section 2 did not themselves create new rights or freedoms but were
directed at throwing light upon the meaning of the terms “due
process of law” in section 1( a )
and “protection of the law” in section 1 ( b ).
 He said at page 2: 




‘ The
specific prohibitions upon what may be done by future Acts of
Parliament set out in paragraphs ( a )
to ( h )
of section 2 and introduced by the words ‘in particular’, are
directed to elaborating what is meant by ‘due process of law’ in
section 1 ( a )
and ‘the protection of the law’ in section 1 ( b ).
 They do not themselves create new rights or freedoms additional to
those recognised and declared in section 1. They merely state in
greater detail what the rights declared in paragraphs ( a )
and ( b )
of section 1 involve. 

 It
would appear from this that if in the present case police officers
acted contrary to any of the prohibitions set out in paragraphs ( a )
to ( h )
of section 2 in relation to Thornhill, it may well amount to a
contravention of one or other of his fundamental rights contained in
section 1 ( a )
or ( b ),
although I am not prepared to go as far as making a positive finding
on this point. However, on the assumption that their actions
amounted to an infringement, what is his remedy? He sought redress
under section 6 of the 1962 Constitution and it is strenuously argued
that he is entitled to the relief that was ordered by the judge. 

 In
my view, if the infringement is as a result of the action of persons
who are entitled collectively or individually to exercise the
plenitude of legislative, executive or judicial power, the remedy is
by way of an application to the High Court for redress in accordance
with section 6 of the 1962 Constitution. If, on the other hand, it
is an infringement by persons who are not entitled to exercise such
legislative, executive or judicial power then protection must be
sought from the ordinary law of 

 506 

 the
land. It follows from this that in the present case this court must
decide the category into which a police officer falls. 

 No
question arises that any Act of Parliament is invalid as contravening
the prohibitions of section 2( c )(ii)
of the 1962 Constitution; nor is there any allegation made as to the
unconstitutional exercise of judicial power. Therefore, if Thornhill
having sought redress under section 6 of the 1962 Constitution is to
succeed in this matter, it is necessary for him to satisfy this court
that the police officers (who are the appellants) could be classified
as persons who collectively or individually are entitled to exercise
the plenitude of executive power. 

 The
modern police force originated with the creation in 1829 by Sir
Robert Peel of the Metropolitan Police Force in England. The
position of a police officer in his relation with members of the
public in this country is similar to that of the police officer in
England. His duty is to enforce the law of the land and take such
steps as may be necessary to see that honest citizens go about their
affairs in peace. He must decide whether or not suspected persons
are to be prosecuted and, if need be, to bring the prosecutions. 
Although his constitutional status has never been defined either by
statute or by the courts, there is good authority for saying that a
police officer is independent of the executive; see R v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, ex part Blackburn [1968] 1 All ER 763. A police officer is the servant of, and
answerable to, no-one but the law. What is clear and beyond question
is that he is not a member of any one of the classes of persons who
are entitled, collectively or individually, to exercise the plenitude
of legislative, executive or judicial power. He is not a legislator,
he is not a member of the judiciary and he is not an agent or member
of the executive. It is, therefore, my opinion that section 6 of the
1962 Constitution (which allowed a person to apply to the High Court
for redress, if he considered that any of the provisions of sections
1 and 2 had been or was likely to be contravened in relation to him)
is not applicable to this case; and the declaration made by the trial
judge was wrongly made. 

 However,
Thornhill is not without remedy because he is protected against any
irregular conduct of a police officer by the ordinary law of the
land. If he should go to trial for the offences alleged against him
(and the statements obtained from him while he was in custody are
found to have been made as a result of threats, violence or other
oppressive conduct, fear or prejudice, or hope of advantage) it is
the duty of the trial judge to exercise his discretion judicially and
fairly and to determine whether or not those statements should be
admitted in evidence. Even if they are admissible, the judge is
still under a duty to consider whether he should admit them depending
on whether their prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. 
As far back as 1783 in England it was established that confessions
obtained in consequence of promises or threats cannot be given in
evidence (see R v Warickshall (1783) 1 Leach 263). Today the test of admissibility of a statement
of an accused person is whether it is a voluntary statement. The
Judges’ Rules (contained in 

 507 

 Home
Office circular 31 of 1964 in England) have been reproduced in this
country almost verbatim by the Judges’ Rules and Administrative a
Directions to the Police which were made by Her Majesty’s judges of
Trinidad and Tobago in 1965. Although these rules are not rules of
law they are rules directed to police officers for their guidance
when conducting investigations. It is there stated that they do not
affect the principles stated in the rules made by the judges of the
Queen’s Bench Division in England, two of which are: 




‘ ( c )
That every person at any stage of an investigation should be able to
communicate and to consult privately with a barrister or a solicitor.
 This is so even if he is in custody, provided that in such a case no
unreasonable delay or hindrance is caused to the processes of
investigation or the administration of justice by his doing so ... 

 ( e )
That it is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence
against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person
to a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by
that person, that it shall have been voluntary, in the sense that it
has not been obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage, exercised or held out by a person in authority, or by
oppression.’ 




 The
questions as to the admissibility of the statements will be decided
by the judge of the trial if there is a trial; but, in the
circumstances of this case, Thornhill cannot seek redress under
section 6 of the 1962 Constitutional and obtain any of the remedies
which he sought. 

 For
all these reasons I would allow this appeal. 

 Appeal
allowed. 

 Appeal 

 Appeal Terrence Thornhill appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council (appeal 32 of 1978) by special leave of the Privy Council
against the decision of the Court of Appeal. The Attorney-General
was the respondent to the appeal. 

 David
Turner-Samuels QC and John Riede (both of the English Bar) for Thornhill 

 W
J Alexander SC and C Brooks and George Newman (of the English Bar) for the Attorney-General 

 The
Board reserved its reasons. 

 Lord
Diplock delivered the opinion of the Board. This appeal raises important
constitutional questions as to the true construction of those
provisions dealing with “The Recognition and Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms” that were contained in Chapter 1,
sections 1, 2, 3 and 6, of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago
which 

 508 

 came
into operation on 31st August 1962 and was in force at the time of
the events that are the subject of these proceedings. They are
reproduced in similar terms in the current Republican Constitution
where they are numbered respectively sections 4, 5, 6 and 14. Their
Lordships will refer to these sections by the numbers that they bore
in the 1962 Constitution. 

 The
relevant facts are set out with clarity and in detail in the judgment
of Georges J in the High Court and repeated, although in less
detailed form, in that of Rees JA who delivered the leading judgment
in the Court of Appeal. To identify the issues of constitutional law
that are involved in this appeal it is not necessary for their
Lordships to do more than summarise the facts very briefly. 

 In
the early afternoon of 17th October 1973, after what has been
described as a “shoot-out” with the police, Thornhill was
arrested by a police officer and taken to a police station where he
was detained and charged with offences arising out of the shooting
incident. He was suspected by the police of many other crimes about
which they wanted to interrogate him. He was not brought before a
judicial authority until these interrogations had been completed and
an identity parade had been held. In the meantime the remained in
custody in one or other of two police stations. A legal adviser
retained on his behalf came to the police station where he was
detained at 5.30 p m on 17th October for the purpose of seeing him
but was denied an opportunity of doing so; requests to the police for
an opportunity for Thornhill to communicate with his legal adviser
were repeated in both morning and afternoon of 18th October, but were
also refused; and it was not until after the conclusion of the
identity parade at 12.45 p m on 20th October 1973 that Thornhill was
granted his first opportunity of communicating with his lawyer. At
the times when these requests were made on 18th October, Thornhill
was not being interviewed by the police and, as the judge found,
there was nothing in connection with the investigation that would
have made it inconvenient for him to be allowed to consult his legal
advisers. The only reason why he was not allowed to do so was that
the police officers concerned were of opinion that if Thornhill were
advised as to his legal right to decline to reply to questions the
answers to which might incriminate him, they would be less likely to
obtain from him extra-judicial confessions that he had committed the
earlier offences of which he was suspected and with which he had not
yet been charged. 

 On
1st November 1973, Thornhill applied to the High Court for redress
under section 6 of the Constitution. By his notice of motion he
claimed three kinds of redress, of which their Lordships are
concerned only with the first. This is a declaration that the
refusal by the police to allow him to instruct and communicate with
his legal adviser between 5.30 p m on 17th October and 12.45 p m on
20th October 1973, while he was under arrest and in their custody,
amounted to a contravention of his constitutional right to do so. 
The second form of redress was a declaration that all statements
taken from him during that period were 

 509 

 unconstitutional,
null and void; and the third consisted of orders designed to prevent
the use of any of those statements in any prosecution of Thornhill or
other proceedings in which he might be concerned. 

 Georges
J, by Whom the application was dealt with in the High Court, made the
first declaration prayed. He refused to grant the two other forms of
relief. He held, in their Lordships’ view quite rightly, that they
involve questions that cannot appropriately be decided by anyone
except the judge who will preside over the trial of Thornhill for the
offences to which the statements relate, and before whom full oral
evidence as to the circumstances in which the statements came to be
made can be called on the voir dire .
 The claims to these two forms of relief were not further pursued by
Thornhill after their rejection by the High Court; so their Lordships
need say 110 more about them. 

 Much
of the judgment of Georges J, to whose lucidity and cogency their
Lordships would desire to pay respectful tribute, deals with the
facts and his findings upon disputed factual issues. Two questions
of law were argued before him: one was of substantive law; the other
was procedural. The question of substance was whether the combined
effect of sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitution was to give to
Thornhill when he had been arrested and detained a constitutional
right in the terms set out in section 2( c )(ii),
viz “the right to retain and instruct without delay a legal adviser
of his own choice and to hold communication with him”. The
procedural question was whether the first declaration prayed for was
a form of redress which the judge in the proper exercise of his
discretion ought to grant. 

 On
the first question it was argued on behalf of the Attorney-General
and the police officers who had been made respondents to the
application that the effect of section 3 of the Constitution was to
reduce the ambit of sections 1 and 2 to rights of the individual
which can be shown to have been legally enforceable by him in
Trinidad and Tobago, prior to the coming into effect of the 1962
Constitution, under a written law or an unwritten rule of common law
that was in force in Trinidad and Tobago on 31st August 1962. At
that date, it is common ground that no written law in force conferred
on any person who had been lawfully arrested and detained by the
police any right while in their custody to consult a lawyer for the
purpose of obtaining advice as to his legal rights and as to what
should be done to protect his interest; and, it was submitted for the
respondents, there is no authority to be found in the decided eases
which shows that at common law such a right would have been
enforceable by the prisoner against the police in a court of justice,
in the event of their refusal to allow him to do so. So, the
argument concluded, there had been no contravention of any of the
provisions of sections 1 and 2 upon which Thornhill could base a
claim to redress under section 6. 

 The
High Court judge, whose judgment was delivered on 31st May 1974,
rejected this argument. He held that, since the right on the part of
a person in the situation in which Thornhill had found himself on
17th to 20th October 1973 to consult a lawyer of his choice had been
spelt 

 510 

 out
specifically in section 2( c )(ii)
of the Constitution and proclaimed by section 1 to be one that had
existed at the time of the coming into force of the Constitution and
was to continue to exist, the burden lay on the respondents to
establish that on 31st August 1962 there was a law in force in
Trinidad and Tobago, whether written or as part of the unwritten
common law, which empowered a police officer to prevent a person in
the situation of Thornhill from exercising that right. This the
respondents in the arguments they had addressed to him had never
attempted to do. The Judge held also, in the alternative, that the
right described in section 2( c )(ii)
already existed at common law in Trinidad and Tobago at the time the
1962 Constitution came into force. 

 On
the procedural question, Georges J held that a declaration was an
appropriate form of redress in all the circumstances of the case. He
accordingly exercised the wide discretion conferred on him under
section 6 by granting it. 

 This
judgment was delivered some twelve months before that of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in De Freitas v Benny (1975) 27 WIR 318. The judge’s analysis of sections 1, 2 and 3 of
the Constitution, however, anticipates and conforms to what was said
by the Judicial Committee both in that case ([1976)] AC 239 at pages
244-246) and in the subsequent case, Ramesh
Lawrence Maharaj v Attorney-General (No 2) (1978) 30 WIR 310. 

 Sections
1 to 3 of the Constitution proceed on the presumption that the human
rights and fundamental freedoms that are referred to in sections 1
and 2 were already enjoyed by the people of Trinidad and Tobago under
the law in force there at the commencement of the 1962 Constitution. 
The enacting words of section 1 are that the then existing rights and
freedoms that are described in paragraphs ( a )
to ( k )
“shall continue to exist”. In those paragraphs the rights and
freedoms that are declared to have existed on 31st August 1962, and
are to continue to exist, are not described with the particularity
that would be appropriate to an ordinary Act of Parliament; nor are
they expressed in words that bear precise meanings as terms of legal
art. They are statements of principles of great breadth and
generality, expressed in the kind of language more commonly
associated with political manifestos or international conventions,
like the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights of
1948, and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) to which, indeed, Chapter 1 of the
Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago and similar provision in the
Constitutions of other Commonwealth countries owe their origin (cf Minister of Home Affairs v Fisher [1979] 2 WLR 889 at page 894). 

 It
was held by the Judicial Committee in Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj v attorney-General (No 2) (1978) 30 WIR at page 318 that the protection afforded to the
individual by these sections was against contraventions of those
rights and freedoms “by the State or by some other public authority
endowed by law with coercive powers” and not by another 

 511 

 private
individual; Chapter 1 of the Constitution does not deal with purely
private wrongs. 

 The
lack of all specificity in the descriptions of the rights and
freedoms protected contained in section 1 ( a )
to ( k )
may make it necessary sometimes to resort to an examination of the
law as it was at the commencement of the Constitution in order to
determine what limits upon freedoms that are expressed in absolute
and unlimited terms were nevertheless intended to be preserved in the
interests of the people as a whole and the orderly development of the
nation; for the declaration that the rights and freedoms protected by
that section already existed at that date may make the existing law
as it was then administered in practice a relevant aid to the
ascertainment of what kind of executive or judicial act was intended
to be prohibited by the wide and vague words used in those paragraphs
( Ramesh
Lawrence Maharaj v Attorney-General (No 2) (1978) 30 WIR at page 317). But this external aid to construction is
neither necessary nor permissible where the treatment complained of
is of any of the kinds specifically described in section 2( a )
to ( h ). 

 Section
2 is directed primarily to curtailing the exercise of the legislative
powers of the newly-constituted Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago. 
Save in the exceptional circumstances referred to in section 4 or by
the exceptional procedure provided for in section 5, the Parliament
may not pass any law that purports to abrogate, abridge or infringe
any of the rights or freedoms recognised and declared in section 1 or
to authorise any such abrogation, abridgment or infringement. But
section 2 also goes on to give, as particular examples of treatment
of an individual by the executive or the judiciary which would have
the effect of infringing those rights, the various kinds of conduct
described in paragraphs ( a )
to ( h )
of that section. These paragraphs spell out in greater detail
(although not necessarily exhaustively) what is included in the
expression “due process of law” to which Thornhill was entitled
under section 1( a )
as a condition of his continued detention and “the protection of
the law” to which he was entitled under section 1( b ).
 So there is no need to consider whether before the commencement of
the Constitution a person arrested and detained by the police would
have had at common law a legal remedy if he had been prevented from
exercising what is specifically described in section 2( c )(ii)
as “the right to retain and instruct without delay a legal adviser
of his own choice and to hold communication with him”. If
justification is to be found anywhere for any exclusion or limitation
of the right so described, it must be sought in section 3. 

 Moreover,
even if the treatment complained of by Thornhill had not been
specifically described in section 2, the fact that section 1 uses
terms of great breadth and generality to describe those rights and
freedoms then existing for which (in conjunction with section 6) it
provides legal protection in the future, is no ground for cutting
down the amplitude of any of the descriptions of those rights and
freedoms contained in section 1( a )
to ( k )
by restricting them to rights for contravention of 

 512 

 which
the victim would before the commencement of the Constitution have had
some legal remedy either in public law or private law which he could
enforce in a court of justice. In the context of section 1, the
declaration that rights and freedoms of the kinds described in the
section have existed in Trinidad and Tobago, in their Lordships’
view, means that they have in fact been enjoyed by the individual
citizen, whether their enjoyment by him has been de jure as a legal right orde facto as the result of a settled executive policy of abstention from
interference or a settled practice as to the way in which an
administrative or judicial discretion has been exercised. The hopes
raised by the affirmation in the preamble to the Constitution that
the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms was to be
ensured would indeed be betrayed if Chapter 1 did not preserve to the
people of Trinidad and Tobago all those human rights and fundamental
freedoms that in practice they had hitherto been permitted to enjoy. 
This construction of section 1 makes it unnecessary to examine
whether the ability of an arrested person while in police custody to
communicate with his lawyer for the purpose of instructing him and
obtaining his advice, was enjoyed by him as a matter of legal right
or in consequence of a settled practice on the part of the police as
to the way an administrative discretion to grant or refuse him leave
to do so was exercised. That such a right was enjoyed in Trinidad
and Tobago at least as a matter of settled practice is apparent from
Appendix A to the Judges’ Rules published in England in 1964 and
adopted in identical terms by the judges of Trinidad and Tobago in
1965. This appendix to the rules refers to five “principles”
which, it says, are not affected by the rules themselves. The third
of these “principles” is: 




‘ That
every person at any stage of an investigation should be able to
communicate and to consult privately with a solicitor. This is so
even if he is in custody provided that in such a case no unreasonable
delay or hindrance is caused to the processes of investigation or the
administration of justice by his doing so’. 




 Thus
far their Lordships have been dealing with sections 1 and 2. Section
3 to which they must now turn is in the following terms: 




‘ Sections
1 and 2 of this Constitution shall not apply in relation to any law
that is in force in Trinidad and Tobago at the commencement of this
Constitution’. 




 Like
section 2 but
unlike section 1 it deals only with “laws”. Both section 2 and section
3 are principally concerned with written laws; but section 105(1) of
the 1962 Constitution expressly provides that the expression “law”
includes any unwritten rule of law, so that it is capable of covering
a restriction on the liberty of the subject of which the only legal
source is the common law itself, such as the restriction of the
liberty of the person resulting from the exercise by a constable of
his common law powers of arrest or by a judge of his common law power
to commit for contempt of court. Section 3 excludes wholly from the
operation of 

 513 

 section
2, the terms of which would otherwise be wide enough to cover them,
all laws (in this extended sense) which were in existence in Trinidad
and Tobago on 31st August 1962. So section 2 does not operate to
repeal or to amend any then existing law. 

 In
contrast to section 2, section 1, as has already been pointed out,
deals not only with rights and freedoms that prior to the
commencement of the Constitution had been enjoyed by the private
citizen de jure as a matter of legal right, but also with those that he had enjoyed de facto only as a result of a settled policy of absention from interference
by the executive or a settled practice as to the way an
administrative or judicial discretion had been exercised. In respect
of rights and freedoms in this category what section 1 does, by
declaring that they shall continue to exist, is to convert them into
rights and freedoms which henceforth are to be enjoyed not simply de facto but also as a matter of legal right for contravention of which a
legal remedy is provided by section 6. All that section 3 does is to
say that if the failure of the executive or public authority or
officer to prevent individuals from acting in a particular way in the
exercise of any of the rights or freedoms described in section 1 was
contrary to a mandatory provision of a law in existence at the
commencement of the Constitution which required them to prevent it
then to that extent the de facto exercise of the right or freedom is not preserved and converted into
a legally enforceable right by section 1. In other words, section 1
does not operate to repeal any existing law. 

 So,
in their Lordships’ view, Georges J was right in saying that the
burden lay on the respondents to the application to show that the
settled practice of allowing an arrested person to consult a lawyer
of his choice at the earliest opportunity, when to do so would not
cause unreasonable delay or hinder the processes of investigation or
the administration of justice, was contrary to law at the time of
commencement of the 1962 Constitution, despite the facts that almost
contemporaneously the judges of both England and Trinidad and Tobago
are to be found referring to it as a principle that should be
followed; and the Constitution-makers in section 2( c )(ii)
describe it as being one of an arrested person’s rights. 

 This
is a burden which the respondents to the application clearly could
not fulfil. Their Lordships would point out that, although the
language in which the “principle” is expressed in the Judges’
Rules is not identical with that in which the “right” is
described in section 2( c )(ii),
the substance is the same. “Delay” is a word which connotes not
simply a lapse of time but in which in the circumstances is longer
that it should have been. Since the only hindrance to the processes
of investigation which it was suggested by the police officers might
be occasioned by Thornhill’s being allowed to consult a lawyer at
the time the requests were made was that they would be less likely to
succeed in obtaining self-criminating statements from him if he were
advised about his legal right to decline to answer questions, any
delay for which this was the only reason was clearly an unreasonable
delay. 

 514 

 Accordingly,
their Lordships would uphold the finding of the High Court judge that
Thornhill’s constitutional rights had been contravened. That being
so and the question being one of wide application and great public
importance, a declaration to that effect is, in their Lordships’
view, an eminently appropriate remedy in the public interest as well
as the personal interests of Thornhill. 

 The
respondents’ appeal from the judgment of Georges J was heard after
the publication of the advice of the Judicial Committee in the
Jamaican case of Hinds v R (1975) 24 WIR 326 but before their decision in Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj v Attorney-General (No 2) (1978) 30 WIR 310. Hinds
v R was not a case arising out of an alleged violation of human rights
and fundamental freedoms under the provision of the Jamaican
Constitution which correspond to Chapter I of the 1962 Constitution
of Trinidad and Tobago. It was a case concerning the structure of
that Constitution (which also follows the Westminster model) and the
separation thereunder of legislative, executive and judicial powers. 
In discussing the various limitations which such a constitutional
structure imposes on the legislature, the executive and the
judiciary, the Board mentioned that the provisions of a Chapter on
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms “impose a fetter on the
exercise by the legislature, the executive and the judiciary of the
plenitude of their respective powers” ((1975) 24 WIR at page 332). 

 Rees
JA, although he considered that the conduct of the respondents might
well have been a contravention of Thornhill’s constitutional rights
under section 1 ( a )
or ( b ),
found it unnecessary to make a positive finding on that point, as he
was of opinion that since a police officer was not in his view a
legislator nor a member of the judiciary nor an agent or member of
the executive, section 6 of the Constitution did not operate to give
to Thornhill any right to apply to the High Court for redress for any
contravention of his constitutional rights by a police officer. This
was the only ground on which Rees JA allowed the appeal. 

 Their
Lordships do not find it necessary to consider to what extent (if
any), despite the provisions of the Constitution relating to the
Police Force and its officers, the Police Service Act 1965, and the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act 1966, the old common law rule
that those persons who at various times in English legal history have
been responsible for appointing a “constable” were not
vicariously responsible for tortious acts done by him in purported
exercise of his common law powers of arrest has survived in Trinidad
and Tobago as respects tortious acts which do not involve any contravention of section 1 of the 1962 Constitution. It
is beyond question, however, that a police officer in carrying out
his duties in relation to the maintenance of order, the detection and
apprehension of offenders and the bringing of them before a judicial
authority is acting as a public officer carrying out an essential
executive function of any sovereign State, the maintenance of law and
order or, to use the expression originally used in England,
“preserving the King’s Peace”. It is also beyond question that
in 

 515 

 performing
these functions police officers are endowed with coercive powers by
the common law, even apart from any statute. Contraventions by the
police of any of the human rights or fundamental freedoms of the
individual that are recognised by Chapter 1 of the Constitution thus
fall squarely within what has since been held by the Judicial
Committee in Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj v Attorney-General (No 2) (1978) 30 WIR 310 to be the ambit of the protection afforded by
section 6, viz contraventions “by the State or by some other public
authority endowed by law with coercive powers” (30 WIR at page
318). In this context “public authority” must be understood as
embracing local as well as central authorities and including any
individual officer who exercises executive functions of a public
nature. Indeed, the very nature of the executive functions which it
is the duty of police officers to perform is likely in practice to
involve the commonest risk of contravention of an individual’s
rights under section 1 ( a )
and ( b ),
through over-zealousness in carrying out those duties. 

 Their
Lordships do not doubt that if the appeal had come before the Court
of Appeal after the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Maharaj instead of before, neither Rees JA nor either of the other members of
the court (Sir Isaac Hyatali CJ and Corbin JA) who expressed their
agreement with his judgment would have adopted, as a ground for
allowing the appeal, that section 6 of the Constitution had no
application to contraventions of human rights or fundamental freedoms
by the police. 

 Sir
Isaac Hyatali CJ, with whom Corbin JA agreed, would also have allowed
the appeal upon the further ground that sections 1, 2, and 3 of the
Constitution protected only rights that were legally enforceable in a
court of law against a contravener under the law in force at the
commencement of the 1962 Constitution. He held that no such legally
enforceable right to consult a lawyer as is described in section
2( c )(ii)
existed at common law or under statute on 31st August 1962. He
regarded as irrelevant any settled practice that fell short of a
mandatory rule of law and, for that reason, attached no importance to
the fact that the Judges’ Rules referred to it as being an accepted
principle that a person who had been arrested should be allowed to
communicate and consult privately with a lawyer where this would not
unreasonably delay or hinder the process of investigation or the
administration of justice. With this branch of the argument for the
respondents, however, their Lordships have already dealt. 

 For
these reasons this appeal must be allowed and the order of the High
Court restored. The Attorney-General must pay Thornhill’s costs
here and in the Court of Appeal. 

 Appeal
allowed.
