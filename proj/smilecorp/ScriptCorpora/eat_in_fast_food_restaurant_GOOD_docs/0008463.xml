 June 10th, 2010 | Author: admin Color Schemes and Statements 

To make a bold color statement, reds mixed with light greens or bright greens mixed with yellows and oranges are great for making a room really stand out. Black and white combinations also make a bold statement.

Never hesitate to use solid white blended with bright colors to create a bright, fun atmosphere in a room. Bold colors can be used in rooms where there is entertainment or family games. Bold colors also work well for a child’s room or sun room. Bright colors can be used to set a mood or draw attention. Perhaps you’d like to draw attention to a certain area of a room. Dazzling colors will draw attention.

For a more relaxing room, use neutral colors with a hint of light color here and there to create a pleasant, calm ambiance. If your furniture is dark in color, lighten it up with accessories. A dark colored couch can be enlightened by a lovely throw rug or pillows. Use a table cloth or runner to brighten a cherry wood table.

A dark headboard of a bed can be complimented by a neutral colored drape or cloth. There are many accessories you can use to reform an otherwise dark or dull room. Other decor items that are inexpensive and can beautify a room are lamps , flowers, figurines, portraits, sculptures, tables, stools and drapes.

 Textures and Color 

If you’re using neutral colors to maintain a peaceful aura in a room, textures keep the room simple, but interesting. Textures are created using decorative pieces that your guests will want to reach out and touch. Examples of pieces with rich textures can be soft, shaggy pillows, a velvet table cloth, a fruit basket that looks very real with fuzzy peaches, a canvas painting, etc. Textured pieces add to the decor of a room, but don’t necessarily make bold statements unless they’re very bright in color. You can blend these types of items into a room of neutral colors.

 Colors for Bathrooms, Utility Rooms and Home Offices 

Smaller rooms of the home are sometimes difficult to decorate. Limited space tends to result in limited imagination for many people. You shouldn’t ignore these rooms, however. They are very important in your home, and can leave an impression also. For smaller rooms, light colors can make the rooms appear more spacious. Even though these rooms are limited in space, you can still be creative with the space you have available.
Your bathroom colors should be relaxing because this is where you spend time bathing and preparing for the busy day ahead. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a lovely bathroom all to yourself for at least a“few”moments each morning?

If you have a home office, you can blend several bright colors to create a busy, fun atmosphere. Boredom and fatigue often hinders people who work at home (especially while operating a computer). Give your home office personality and excitement with a bright-colored decor. It might keep you awake and alert on those tiresome afternoons!

A utility room, although not frequently visited by guests, should be decorated for convenience, not just beauty. Organization is the key, and adding a splash of color will give the room an energetic atmosphere.

 Spring Living Room Décor Ideas 

Take a used wreath and remove the decorations. Arrange new spring flowers on the wreath, leaving a small area open at the top. Buy a wide piece of ribbon in a color that will match your room and the flowers.
Tie the ribbon loosely around the top with a bow above the wreath. Use the bow to hang it on the wall. You can also decorate the wreath and place it on a table or plate with a pillar candle in the middle. Use bright colors such as spring green, sunshine yellow, bright pink, or blue.

 Candles and Fragrances 

Candle groupings in pastel or bright spring colors can add new zest to your living room decor. Decorate your mantel or coffee table with different colors and sizes of candles. Glue ribbons or flowers on them to add variety to the grouping.
If you have a large multi-wick candle, use a ribbon to thread small flowers or beads in spring colors around it.

 Does Your Living Room Smell Really Fresh? 

Fragrance is another way to convey a spring decor theme in your living room. Buy new potpourri for your simmering pot, or lose leaves for an open bowl. Colorful dried potpourri will add colorful accents to match the other spring decorations in your living room.
This spring, be sure to brighten up your living room with crafts you have made by hand. Make your living room a comfortable, inviting place to spend time with friends and family. These personal touches will bring new style into your room.

 Home Office Furniture 
 June 9th, 2010 | Author: admin Each day, more and more people are getting caught in the‘work from home’fever. Government as well as companies is quickly embracing this type of‘work from home’scheme as there are many benefits such as employee being able to spend more time with the family and saving office space rental as well. Likewise, the explosion of the internet has created many internet entrepreneurs who just need a computer in their home to operate a home business.

As home office is getting more and more popular, it is important that you design and setup your home office in a manner that is conducive and productive for you to work in.

First of all, identify a location within your home where you can work conductively without any noise or distraction. Is there a spare room in the house or is there any place where you can create a space to work in? Make sure that there is sufficient lighting during the day time.

Once you have chosen that area, consider doing up wall shelves to put your stationery and office document to save space on the table. As table space is usually small, consider buying a‘miniature’desktop computer / laptop to put on the table. More spaces can be created by attaching the house phone to the wall as well.
