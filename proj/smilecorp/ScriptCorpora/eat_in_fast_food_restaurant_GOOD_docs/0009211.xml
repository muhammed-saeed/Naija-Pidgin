 I want to go. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 andrea bocelli concert.  Tickets are $447.00 a piece, plus air fare, hotel accommodations, food, and booze. it’s not the kind of concert you’d buy a tee shirt at so we’d save some money there. the locations are italy, ireland, las vegas, or new york. identity theft is my only option.

 deal or no deal. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 

 this ranks in the upper echelon of moronic game shows. who is howie mandel and why are his ears pierced? who is the idiot in the sound proof booth making the fake phone calls? it took 20 minutes for me understand the concept. I can’t imagine making a living by holding a briefcase on a stage. the contestants seem like really bad actors. after they decide to take the money and run, howie forces them to keep choosing briefcases, just to see what could have happened. this would be a life-ruiner if you had the million dollar case and were a quitter. write the government a check for $350,000.00 before you leave the stage. the giggling was my million dollar win.

 I just noticed. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 I had pores. stuart is still in the house. wooden mouse traps are extremely dangerous. people talk out their ass. there are a shitload of welfare bums living on my block. I take 45 minute showers. if it’s in my checking account, it’s going to be spent. I can no longer relax. woodchuck is my favorite new beer. you can go days without eating anything other than a mint. life needs to be lived, happily. the sun heals. I’m missing a tonsil.  I have no fucking idea where it went. dust bugs the shit out of me. I can’t control fucktards. men are sexy when they sweat, unless it’s ball sweat and that’s just gross.

 my father disliked him because he lobbied the state to have liquor stores turned over to the private sector.  He needed to stick to football and shut his pie hole. my son.in.law said his coaching was like a weekend at bernies. the red-headed tree, mcqueary, needs to be fired as well.  Simply because a whistleblower law exists, doesn’t mean he should be spared. everyone associated with this scandal should go up in flames. the dumbass students rioting have displaced anger. the students holding vigils and having fundraisers for the victims make the school proud. penn state swept this one under the rug.  They must have taken lessons from the catholic church.

 grenade. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
toss one.

 into the lounge during break time. during an executive board meeting. any time an administrator says we didn’t make money. any time an administrator says we’re not getting a bonus. at any random walmart checkout line. into the car of the crazy bastard coasting in the passing lane. into the car of the retard at a fast food restaurant placing a special order. into the courtroom that housed amanda knox and casey anthony. at the religious zealots boycotting steve job’s funeral.  Yeah I know, he bought his liver.  I wrote about it long ago.  It doesn’t warrant a boycott. speaking of amanda knox.  What guzzler is offering her 10 million for her story.  I’ll give it to you for one.  She did it.

 jesus shops at walmart. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 

 a young couple saw jesus on their walmart receipt and said it was a sign.“We just feel like it’s a blessing that God showed it to us and opened our eyes and we just feel like we should share the blessing God gave to us to everybody else.” I don’t think it looks like jesus at all.  I think it looks more like jerry garcia or bin laden. 

 

 a cinnamon bun resembling Mother Theresa was found  in a bakery in nashville, tennessee and became the“nun bun”.  The shop started selling t-shirts and other memorabilia until the real Mother Teresa ordered a cease and desist before her death. 

 

 some canadian numbskull thought this was jesus on his fish stick. 

 

 I really do see jesus with this one. of course I won’t be surprised when I get struck by a lightning bolt.

 my life cracks me up. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 at target:  I said to the oldest five minutes after we got there…”I’m sick in my stomach, I have to go to the bathroom.””Already?”was her reply, said with disgust.  pfft. my grandson busted into my room and saw me laying in bed.  He pointed to the space beside me and said“that’s my side.  Happy birthday!!”That is his side and my birthday is in january.  I made him give me a birthday kiss anyway. I just backed into a car.   I didn’t see him but I didn’t look either.  He got out of the car screaming his ass off.  His wife got out of the car too and we realized we work in the same building.  She told the loud mouth to shut the fuck up.  He did. I eat the same thing over and over until I can’t eat it ever again. I do the schedule at work for crazy bastards in my department. I wish every single celebrity rehaber would overdose. I’m a“words with friends”addict. I text entirely too much.

 dumbing down. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 if you think hangover and hangover 2 is the least bit funny. if you care at all what charlie sheen does. if you peruse the tabloids at the checkout. if you think facebook and twitter are a good idea for reasons other than stalking your children. if you can have a conversation about nascar.

 why would anyone. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 


 

 sleep with arnold schwarzenegger.  He took steroids for 100 years, therefore, his penis is probably the size of a vienna sausage. sleep with arnold schwarzenegger.  He’s disgusting and flabby since he stopped taking steroids. sleep with arnold schwarzenegger.  He can’t speak english and he’s a horrible actor. sleep with arnold schwarzenegger.  He has an old man, saggy ass. sleep with arnold schwarzenegger.  Ever.  Period.

 what are the odds. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 of christie brinkley’s daughter looking like her ugly father, billy joel. of amy winehouse being a crack whore? of having to shit 30 seconds AFTER you shower.  It ruins the entire day. getting in trouble at work for the same thing you did last year.  It wasn’t my fault this time either. everyone named“tammy”in the department being a retard.  That goes for“diane/diana”too. of my locker being in close proximity to the“crazy bird”who makes small talk every morning while she’s totally naked.  Well, she has granny panties on and a nursing bra and she’s my age, so she’s not totally naked but close enough.

 what were you thinking. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 


 

 kenny rogers.   This is plastic surgery gone completely awry.   You have to scare the shit out of yourself everytime you look in a mirror. christine aguilera.  Your ex-husband is one of the ugliest  men I’ve ever seen. lance armstrong.  You’re a fraud. al roker.  Why did you lose so much weight?  It looks like you have cancer. mel gibson.  You can’t even blame your outlandish antics on booze. I’m still disturbed by this, 8 years after first reading it. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3286721.stm kelsey grammer.  Why do you keep marrying prostitutes?  The last one cost you 50 million.  Cheers. I bet milton hershey is rolling over in his grave.  His greedy heirs moved his factory to mexico.  I haven’t had a hershey kiss since 2008. why would anyone throw acid in their own face?  Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time.

 sniper shot. reload. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 


 

 kevin federline.  Skinny or fat, you’re putrid. all professional cheerleaders.  I wouldn’t put this one on your resume. all mothers who enter their toddlers in beauty pagents.   Quit trying to live through your kids vicariously.  If you weren’t pretty enough to win, what makes you think your offspring can pull it off?  My victory as a toddler doesn’t count. anyone associated with hp tech support. bridget neilson.  I’m surprised your retinas didn’t combust when you saw flavor flav naked. clowns.  99.9% of the population hates you.   You make up the other .01%. al sharpton and jesse jackson.  They serve no purpose  other than to stir a big pot of boiling shit. everyone who goes to chuck e. cheese, excluding my family.  You people are filthy. all of the pompous jackass moronic idiots I work with. rodney king.  They beat the shit out of you for a reason. anyone over the age of 8 who wears disney characters on their clothing.  Boom.

 I wish. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 I could sing like alicia keys. you could just reach over and pull out someones larynx. we could segregate“the stupids”like they were lepers. I could drive to my destination without having to stop for red lights, oncoming traffic, pedestrians, animals, cyclists, and people holding the“stop”and“go”construction signs who make more than I do. Miley Cyrus would fall off the face of the earth along with her idiot father, Lindsay Lohen and her assine parents, Kayne West, Dr. Phil, Oprah, Paris Hilton, each and every one of the Kardashians,  Mel Gibson, all of the Baldwins, TV evangelists, Tiger Woods, Britney Spears, Tom Cruise, Heidi and Spencer, and Justin Beiber.  I could go on for days. I never had to grocery shop again.  It’s entirely too much work. they would stop the ridiculous beauty pagents.  You’d think we would have achieved world peace by now. you could punch men in the face that don’t hold the door open for you. that you could push slow walkers out of the way.  This includes toddlers. women would stop lining their lips and drawing on eyebrows.  You look like Bette Davis in“What Ever Happened to Baby Jane”.

 bullshit. 
 By why am I here in a handbasket? 
 

 lil wayne is a lil punk who probably spent more on his blinged out sippy cup than I will make in 10 years. jay-z and beyonce are both non-talents who made 122 million dollars last year. flavor flav is famous for being a lousy rapper, wearing a giant clock around his neck which unfortunately never strangled him to death. walmart used to take out insurance polices on their“sickly”employees and made a mint when they died. http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/insurance/p64954.asp even if britney spears had a voice, which she doesn’t but this is hypothetical, you’ll only remember her for shaving her head and trying to stab people with an umbrella. should a park ranger be a CEO of a corporation? who decided white was a good color for men’s underwear?  White and anus.  Think about it. fibromyalgia.   If this is even real,  it’s not a debilitating disease.  Get your ass to work.
