uptown taste. They make everything from scratch daily and have both
a menu and a buffet. Be sure to stop here. less Tuscany Steak&amp;amp; Pasta House Cathy P.  - We go there on a regular basis. You can never go wrong. I&apos;ve not had

anything I really didn&apos;t like. You can get a hamburger, a steak,
seafood, pork chop, chicken, the best pasta dish, or just a great salad
and fantastic soup. At lunch we believe you can eat as cheaply as a fast
food restaurant and still be served a wonderful sit down meal. Owners
are always nearby and ready to help with any need you fell you may not
have gotten met. The atmosphere and surroundings are great with a real
home town feel for a really good price! less Andrews At the Westbrook Farm Cathy P.  - We&apos;ve been here several times and was disappointed to see someone

on the site for ANDREWS had given it such a bad review. The food is ALWAYS
excellent. Owner Andrew Patrick is a fabulous cook and very particular
about what he serves. We had friends from CA visiting us and they have
traveled and dined all over the world. They said they found ANDREWS
to be one of the best! They were surprised to find such a gem in the middle
of a corn field in IL. We agree. It is a little pricey for the average budget
so be prepared and go for a special occasion if not in your budget all
the time! If you get the chance try their special New Year&apos;s Eve
party. Terrific for a wonderful price and you get steak and lobster
as well as all the trimmings, music and party hats! less Paris Family Restaurant Roland T.  - I really love this place. i take my family their once a week and the kids

love it. They have good food for everyone and my boys like the tater tots
menu. you also can see one of the locals that i think owns it, he owns a
race car team jerry forsithe sometimes. he signed a napkin for my boys
and got them from two racers he had with him, tracy and bordais. it think
their both from canada. its a friendly place to eat and you never know
who you can rub elbows with. less Paris Family Restaurant Sara L.  - This place was ok, but I&apos;ve had better. I think it&apos;s probably

gone a little down hill, but it&apos;s still probably pretty decent
if your in the area. The food was ok, nothing to rave about. The service
was a little slow and it took forever to get drink refills. less Applebee&apos;s Wilder T.  - I have had the Pasta and Chicken salad here. Both were very good. The

Sweet Tea is wonderful. The service is excellent. The desserts vary
from time to time. I like the cheesecake. less Applebee&apos;s Typical applebees. I guess what would make this one stand out is its
good service and the food coming out in a timely fasion. Nice atmosphere. Applebee&apos;s A really good chain great appetizers and burgers their special drinks are expensive but really worth it Hogg Heaven BBQ John M.  - Not bad BBQ. I have only eaten from the buffet here, so I don&apos;t know

about the menu items. The buffet has pulled pork and fried chicken with
a couple potato and vegetable choices (and salads) with a few dessert
choices, usually cobblers. Not a bad place to stop if you&apos;re in
the area less Cody&apos;s Road House John M.  - This place has the best ribs I have ever had. I love their sauce, sweet

and a little smoky. Sides are pretty decent. I like having a baked sweet
potato instead of a baked potato. I don&apos;t get here often enough! less View More | View on Map
