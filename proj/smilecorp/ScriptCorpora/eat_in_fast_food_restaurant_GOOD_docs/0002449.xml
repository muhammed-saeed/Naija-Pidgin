DESC: The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated
 by the University of California under contract with the U.S.
 Department of Energy, is seeking collaborators in the commercialization
 and further development of optics and metrology technologies
 that can be applied in the field of Deep UV Lithography (DUVL).
 Deep UV Lithography is the current leading edge technique
 for manufacturing memory and logic integrated circuits and
 is likely to be used for fabricating features with critical
 dimensions of less than 100 nm. It is anticipated that the
 next generation of DUV lithographic tools will employ a step
 and scan configuration using 157 nm excimer lasers with a bandwidth
 of about 1 picometer. Key technical challenges for future DUVL
 systems include the design, fabrication, simulation, and testing
 of optical projection systems that are used for imaging the
 reticle onto the wafer. The optical projection system must
 meet stringent imaging requirements for low levels of wavefront
 aberration, distortion, and flare while maintaining a high
 level of optical system stability. LLNL is seeking industrial
 partners in applying its optics technologies to the design,
 manufacture, and characterization of DUVL optical projection
 systems. Potential areas of interaction include: 1) the optical
 design of DUV optical projection systems compatible with commercially-available
 excimer laser light sources; 2) the development of new optical
 materials for use with excimer laser illumination; 3) the metrology
 of assembled optical systems and individual optical components;
 4) the coating of optical elements; 5) the design of the mechanical
 housing and hardware for mounting and actuating the optical
 elements; 6) the alignment of optical systems; and 7) the simulation
 of the optical system including the application of detailed
 electro-magnetic models describing the interaction between
 the illumination and reticle structures. LLNL has a long history
 of developing optical systems in support of its internal programs
 as well as in partnerships with industry. Collaborators are
 sought with a demonstrated expertise in developing optical
 systems for DUV Lithography. Successful collaborators will
 have an established history in delivering optical systems that
 have been integrated into lithographic production systems.
 Avenues for collaborations may include work for others (WFO),
 or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs).
 Any collaboration must include a funds-in component to LLNL
 to support the design, fabrication, metrology, or analysis
 of a DUVL imaging system or its optical components. To ensure
 consideration, interested parties must respond in writing to
 LLNL by May 19, 2000 and provide the following information:
 (1) the name and address of the organization; (2) the name,
 address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of
 a point of contact; (3) documentation as to the corporate importance
 of DUV lithographic imaging systems to the company; (4) a roadmap
 indicating the company&apos;s past development of lithographic imaging
 systems, its current imaging systems, and its anticipated introduction
 of future DUV imaging systems, such as for 157 nm lithography.
 Statement of interest should be sent to Industrial Partnerships
 and Commercialization Office, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,

DESC: Please note that the solicitation number for this effort
 has been changed to F04701-00-R-0507 (formerly F04701-99-R-0507).
 The previously published description of the effort was incomplete;
 the complete text is as follows: The Government will release
 a Call for Improvement (CFI) on or about 2 Jun 00 leading to
 the selection of a contractor for continued development and
 production options for the National Polar-orbiting Operational
 Satellite System&apos;s (NPOESS) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer
 Suite (VIIRS) sensor. Proposals will be due 30 days after CFI
 release (on or about 3 Jul 00). After a full and open competition,
 the Government awarded multiple Phase I contracts for Sensor
 Payload and Algorithm Development for VIIRS on 31 Jul 97. The
 Phase I incumbent contractors will have completed their Preliminary
 Design Reviews (PDR) prior to release of the CFI. From proposals
 submitted in response to the CFI, the Government intends to
 down-select to a single Phase II contractor to complete the
 instrument development through delivery of flight units for
 NPOESS. The CFI will be conducted as a full and open competition.
 The Government will evaluate fairly and fully all responsive
 proposals submitted in response to the CFI. However, Offerors
 are advised that it is unlikely a non-incumbent will be selected
 to perform the Phase II effort. To be selected, a new competitor
 must demonstrate a PDR-level instrument, algorithm maturity,
 and risk reduction in their CFI proposal. While the Government
 intends to select a Phase II contractor shortly after PDR,
 the Government reserves the right not to select and to either
 extend the parallel development efforts to a future selection
 milestone (e.g., CDR) or cease further development activity.
 The CFI will be released via the NPOESS home page on the World
 Wide Web (http://www.ipo.noaa.gov). The Government has an Electronic
 Library containing NPOESS-related documentation necessary for
 CFI preparation. To gain access to this library, send an e-mail
 to datamanager@ipo.noaa.gov containing point of contact, organization,
 e-mail address, and phone number. The IPO intends to release
 Draft Request for Proposal 2 (DRFP) for VIIRS on or about 27
 Apr 00 to encourage industry participation in developing the
 CFI and will request contractors to respond with comments on
 or about 5 May 00. Industry is encouraged to comment on any
 element of DRFP 2 with the understanding that responses are
 voluntary and the Government is neither negotiating nor calling
 for offers during this process. Potential offerors are advised
 the Government reserves the right to incorporate suggested
 changes into the final CFI without identifying the submitter
 or obtaining approval. The Government will not make its responses
 to submitted comments available to industry and may not make
 them available to the submitter. The DRFP will be released
 through the NPOESS electronic library. You are advised that
 an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential
 offerors during the down-selection phase of the acquisition.
 The purpose of the Ombudsman is to assist in communicating
 offeror concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations
 to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the
 Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality regarding the
 source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in
 proposal evaluation or in the source selection process. The
 Ombudsman, Mr. Les Bordelon, can be reached at (310) 363-3818.

SUBJECT: B--DEVELOPMENT OF A REGULATORY AIR QUALITY MODEL FOR
 OCS APPLICATIONS
SOL 1435-01-00-RP-31071
DUE 051600
POC Lisa Goins-Berntsen, Contracting Officer 703-787-1364
DESC: The U.S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management
 Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a Cost Plus Fixed
 Fee contract for a study to develop an updated regulatory model
 for evaluating air quality impacts from emission sources located
 on federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The
 following information will describe the prospective effort
 and advise potential offerors how to respond. The MMS is in
 charge of a national program to develop the mineral resources,
 including oil and gas, on the OCS areas of the United States.
 The areas of oil/gas development are located at distances ranging
 from three (3) miles to more than 100 miles from shore. Currently
 most of the activities take place in the Gulf of Mexico. In
 the early 1980s the MMS developed the Offshore&amp;Coastal Dispersion
 (OCD) model, a steady-state Gaussian model for evaluating impacts
 from inert pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, PM) emitted from point,
 line, or area sources located over water. Since the science
 of dispersion modeling has made significant advances over the
 last couple of decades, there is a need to develop a model
 for application to emission sources on the OCS that incorporates,
 to the extent feasible, the most current knowledge and is versatile
 enough to be used in short-range as well as long-range applications.
 The objective of this study is to formulate a new or revised
 air quality model for offshore and coastal applications. It
 shall be carried out in two phases. The first phase shall consist
 of a review of current puff models for the purpose of determining
 which one could be most effectively adopted, modified, or enhanced
 for use in an offshore and coastal environment. This shall
 be accomplished by comparing model algorithms with formulations
 derived from current theory and observations of the marine
 boundary layer and overwater dispersion characteristics. The
 results of this review and analysis shall be used to develop
 a plan for the formulation and development of a revised offshore
 and coastal air quality model. In the second phase, a revised
 air quality model shall be developed. A revised or enhanced
 CALMET/CALPUFF system is preferred, but another Lagrangian
 trajectory model may be considered. The model shall be designed
 to calculate 1, 3, 8, 24-hour, and annual average concentrations
 of the so-called &quot;nonreactive&quot; pollutants (i.e., NO2, SO2,
 PM, and CO). Simulation of ozone (O3) concentrations shall
 not be considered. The model shall contain simple chemistry
 for calculating NO2, nitrates, and sulfates, and be able to
 simulate wet/dry deposition. The model shall have the capability
 to use the most basic overwater meteorological input variables
 (i.e., wind speed and direction at roughly 10 m above the water
 surface, air temperature at about 10 m, sea surface temperature,
 and relative humidity). However, the model shall have the option
 of incorporating data from overwater rawinsonde observations
 or profilers. The requirements for overland meteorological
 data and surface characteristics shall be the same as those
 for AERMOD or CALPUFF (e.g., wind speed, cloud cover, albedo,
 Bowen ratio, roughness length). The model shall have the ability
 to simulate pollutant concentrations at overwater receptors,
 at receptors in the land/water transition zone, and at receptors
 at inland locations where overland conditions predominate.
 The range of the model shall extend from less than 100 m to
 distances of up to 200 km or more downwind of the source. The
 model shall also contain algorithms to take terrain into account.
 The building downwash algorithms shall take into account platform
 structures as well as vessels. The model shall contain appropriate
 algorithms for calculating over water mixing heights. These
 shall be based on either existing formulations from the literature
 or new/modified ones. The model shall also contain an empirical
 scheme to adjust the 3-D wind field to account for land/sea
 breeze circulation systems. This scheme will take into account
 land/sea temperature contrast, heat flux, time of day, terrain,
 and general synoptic flow. The model shall have the capability
 to be run in a screening mode (similar to running CALPUFF in
 the ISC mode) for single facilities as well as in runs utilizing
 complete 3-D meteorological data, hundreds of sources, and
 domains the size of several hundred kilometers. The complete
 model package shall consist of (1) pre-processors for generating
 land use and terrain data, (2) meteorological data pre-processor,
 (3) a meteorological model, (4) an air quality model, and (5)
 post-processors. The meteorological data pre-processor shall
 have the capability of reading National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)
 buoy data, identify data gaps, and re-format the data for input
 into the meteorological model. The post-processors shall be
 designed so that the user to view the meteorological input
 associated with episodes of peak concentrations. The model
 code will be in Fortran 90 programming language. A user-friendly,
 Windows based Graphical User Interface (GUI) program shall
 be constructed for use in generating input control files, running
 the model, and manipulating output files. The model, including
 any of the codes, shall be non-proprietary. The model shall
 be designed to run on a PC, and should have the capability
 to be transferred to a UNIX workstation. Ease of use shall
 be of high priority. The final product will be used by offshore
 operators for MMS plan reviews or for EPA permit applications.
 Emission sources include offshore platforms, construction activities,
 vessels, and oil spills. The models will also be used by MMS
 in programmatic air quality analysis for OCS lease sales. The
 model shall also have the capability to address visibility.
 A test version of the model shall be constructed and sensitivity
 tests and model performance evaluations conducted. The model
 performance evaluation shall utilize data collected in tracer
 experiments that were conducted in several coastal areas in
 California and Louisiana, and any other marine or coastal data
 that may be available elsewhere. The model predicted values
 shall be compared against measured concentrations in the field
 using basic EPA guidance on model performance evaluations.
 Following completion of the sensitivity tests and model performance
 evaluations, a final model package shall be delivered. How

 SECONDARY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS TIEBREAKERS: 5. GEOGRAPHIC
 LOCATION OF FIRM RELATIVE TO THE WORKSITE: Firms based in or
 having branch offices in Florida with lower mobilization and
 demobilization costs will be given preference provided there
 is an adequate number of qualified firms for consideration.
 6. VOLUME OF PAST DOD CONTRACTS AWARDED TO FIRM: Work previously
 awarded to the firm by DOD will be reviewed with the objective
 of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally
 qualified firms. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Firms meeting the
 requirements described in this announcement and wishing to
 be considered, must submit one copy each of SF 254 and SF 255
 for the firm or joint venture and SF 254 for each subcontractor.
 In Block 4 of SF 255 list only the office personnel for the
 office to perform the work which is indicated in Block 3B.
 Additional personnel strengths, including consultants should
 be indicated parenthetically, and their source clearly identified.
 In Block 7G of the SF 255, indicate specific project experience
 for key team members and indicate the team member&apos;s role on
 each listed project (architect, project manager, etc.). Submittal
 of supplemental attachments to SF 255 addressing evaluation
 factors 1-4 is strongly recommended. Submittal package must
 be received in this office at the address indicated below,
 no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on May 29, 2000. Submittals
 received after this date and time will not be considered. Unnecessarily
 elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient
 to present a complete and effective response to this announcement
 are not desired. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued
 a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered
 in the CCR before receiving a contract from any activity of
 the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting
 officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.
 (The CCR&apos;s web site may be accessed at http://www.acq.osd.mil/ec.)
 Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged
 to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint
 ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms
 are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place
 subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and
 small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions
 of Public Law 95-507. If a large business firm is selected
 for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding
 the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the
 work it intends to subcontract. Of those dollars the large
 business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers
 floors for subcontracting are 61.4% to small business concerns;
 9.1% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 5.0% to women-owned
 small business concerns; and 1.0% for HUBZone concerns. The
 term &quot;floors&quot; is used instead of &quot;goals&quot; as the Corps of Engineers
 objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet
 the percentages. Large firms should keep these floors in mind
 when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors
 and ensure that each proposed subcontractor&apos;s socio-economic
 status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.
 An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required
 prior to award. The SIC code is 8711. The size standard is
 $4,000,000. Your attention is directed to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations
 on Subcontracting, which will be included in the contract set-aside
 for small business and which states in part: &quot;At least 50 percent
 of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel
 shall be expended for employees of the concern&quot;. Response to
 this ad should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal
 visits are discouraged. The required forms shall be submitted
 to the following address: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN:
 CESAJ-EN-DC, 400 West Bay Street, Room 1044, Jacksonville,
 FL 32202-4412 or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-DC,
 P.O. Box 4970, Jacksonville, FL 32232-0019. This is not a request
 for proposal. Firms may post their name/address on the web
 site to facilitate contact between prime contractors, sub-contractors,
 and firms interested in joint ventures. However, copies of
 the listings of firms will not be provided. See our Web Page

POC Philip C. Pulver, Contractor 509-943-0656 fax
DESC: The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is conducting
 a survey to identify potential licensees for the marketing
 and distribution of the Java-based Update Guardian software
 product developed for the Department of Energy. Update Guardian
 enables automatic version updates for Java applications via
 the Internet. The Update Guardian Software, written in 100%
 Java (Version 1.1.6+, JDK [Sun&apos;s Java Development Kit]), is
 a set of Java classes that provides deployment control of Java
 applications. When executed as part of the main Java application,
 Update Guardian will monitor a Web site for updating instructions,
 and if found, will perform actions such as downloading and
 installing the latest Jar files for the application. The software
 can operate on any computer platform including Windows 95/98/2000/NT,
 Macintosh, Sun Solaris and most other Unix platforms. The software
 is easily configured, and comes fully compiled and self contained
 for use with any Java application. Update Guardian utilizes
 the programming environment of the Java 1.1.6 language (JDK)
 developed by Sun Microsystems. This software is designed to
 be easily embedded into any Java (JDK compliant) application
 (even pre-built applications). Completely separate from any
 other Java application, Update Guardian does not involve any
 additional coding by the original application. Developers and
 distributors of Java applications can readily embed Update
 Guardian with their existing applications. Interested and
 qualified firms should respond in writing, postmarked, emailed
 or faxed no later than May 22, 2000.

POC Deborah Rincon at 202-366-6689
DESC: The Department of Transportation (DOT) Transportation Administration
 Service Center (TASC) plans to release a Request for Proposal
 (RFP) for Forensic Drug Testing Laboratory Services. TASC and
 current TASC customer agencies present urine specimens for
 drug testing from anywhere in the USA and, to a limited extent,
 foreign locations. These include specimens that must be handled
 under various regulatory requirements, such as the US Department
 of Health and Human Services, DOT, and the Department of Defense
 regulations and guidelines. TASC as a fee-for-service entity
 must acquire a service that provides the best quality for DOT
 and non-DOT customers. TASC defines that quality as follows:
 TASC requires the capability of performing at least 30,000
 screening tests a year. However, testing levels (amounts of
 specimens) fluctuate from day to day. The offeror must be capable
 of performing at least 200 screening tests of specimens submitted
 under this contract (regardless of other work) within any 24
 hours. It is an accepted industry standard for laboratories
 to report negative screen tests within 24 hours of receipt
 by the laboratory unless there are unusual circumstances on
 a specimen. This is a quality expectation of DOT and its customer
 agencies. Our testing overwhelmingly involves operating safety-sensitive
 employees. It is imperative that these services provide accurate
 results in the minimum time possible. The reduction of potential
 threats to public safety is a paramount goal of this program.
 The offeror must be capable of performing 20 confirmation tests
 under this contract (regardless of other work) within a 24-hour
 period. Actual amounts of specimens received per day may fluctuate.
 The offeror must be capable of performing tests for drugs listed
 in Schedules I and II of the Controlled Substances Act according
 to specific cutoff value(s) for drug test results to be considered
 positive. These are provided by TASC based on the drug involved.
 This testing must include a screening test and, if the screen
 is positive, a confirmation test. Methods used must be forensically
 sound and defensible by the laboratory. The offeror must be
 capable of performing tests for adulteration and substitution.
 This is in addition to specific gravity, pH, and creatinine
 and quantitative levels for positive tests on request. Daily
 laboratory test results reports must be provided electronically
 to DOT/TASC or customer agencies. The industry standard is
 to electronically transmit screen negative results within 24
 hours of receipt. Specific information is required on all specimens.
 Other data and report requirements would indicate that the
 offeror utilizes a state-of-the art information management
 system. This system must interface with a testing management
 system called Heidi, that is utilized by DOT and some of DOT&apos;s
 customers. The contract will be awarded based on &quot;best value&quot;
 to the government for a base period and four option years.
 The estimated start of contract performance will be October
 1, 2000. The RFP will be a full and open competition. Release
 of the RFP is planned for the middle of May, 2000. The RFP
 will be distributed electronically via the Government&apos;s electronic
 posting Web site at http://www.eps.gov (reference DTTS59-2000-R-00432).
 THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT DISTRIBUTE HARD COPIES OF THE RFP;
 DISTRIBUTION WILL ONLY BE DONE VIA THE AFOREMENTIONED METHOD
 SO FIRMS SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE BY REQUESTING TO
 BE PLACED ON A SOLICITATION MAILING LIST. The RFP and related
 documents will be provided in Microsoft Word format. The RFP
 will have instructions for providing questions and comments.
 DOT anticipates that all subsequent solicitation documents
 (e.g., amendments to the RFP and responses to questions) will
 be disseminated to offerors via the same method.

 SURVEYS AND THE LARGE FACILITIES FOLLOWUP SURVEY. The National
 Science Foundation is Congressionally mandated to collect information

 facilities at colleges and universities in the United States.
 To fufill this mandate, NSF conducts the Survey of Scientific
 and Engineering Research Facilities on a biennial basis. This
 acquisition is for the 2001 and 2003 cycles of the survey.
 In the most recent cycle, a census of 546 academic institutions
 and 302 biomedical research institutions were surveyed. In
 addition, NSF conducts a Large Facilities Follow-up Survey
 with a subset of academic institutions that are constructing
 buildings costing at least $25 million with scientific and
 engineering research facilities. In the most recent implementation
 of this survey, approximately 33 institutions were surveyed.
 Both surveys are mixed mode surveys. However, NSF requires
 that the selected contractor use a world wide web-based data
 collection for those institutions with such a capability. RFP
 CPO - 0000002 is expected to be released approximately 15 days
 following this sysnopsis publication, with a 45-day proposal
 submission period on a full and open competition basis. Since
 this is an unrestricted acquisition under SIC code 8999, a
 price evaluation adjustment will be provided for small, disadvantaged
 businesses. A four-year cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is anticipated
 to be awarded by NSF. All potential offerors should download
 this solicitation from the following Website: http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/cpo/contract/sol.htm.

 G-EVALUATION- The offerors shall explain in their proposals
 whether or not their solution meets each of the requirements
 detailed in this synopsis/solicitation, addressing each item
 in &quot;C. REQUIREMENTS/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED&quot; individually. The
 government will award a contract to the offeror that provides
 the greatest overall benefit in response to this synopsis/solicitation
 including price and other factors - this is a best value procurement.
 The rating of the proposal in the technical evaluation will
 be the most important factor in the evaluation. Cost to the
 government will be the second most important factor. Past performance
 will also be evaluated, as the third most important factor.
 The selected offeror must demonstrate an acceptable past performance
 record by submitting the names, addresses and telephone numbers
 of at least five (5) recent customers who will provide information
 concerning the quality of the product(s) and support provided
 by the offeror. The contractor must have experience providing
 training workshops to Middle and High School teachers. The
 government reserves the right to award a contract based on
 initial proposals, on a &quot;best value&quot; basis as described above.
 If the government instead determines that further evaluation
 is required, the government will make a competitive-range determination
 and notify all offerors whether their proposal is in the competitive-range
 or not. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract
 with a base plus four one-year options will result from this
 RFP. The SIC for this acquisition is 8748. This acquisition

DESC: DSCC currently has a Central Plant and distribution system
 to various buildings that is comprised of two 70 MMbtu/hr.
 Riley Stoker coal fired high temperature hot water generators
 and one 40 MMbtu/hr. natural gas fired unit. This project converts
 one of the 70 MMbtu generators to a gas fired unit. This new
 unit will become the primary generator for the central plant.
 The work includes removal and demolition of selected components
 of the boiler and associated equipment as well as installation
 of new equipment and repair of some existing equipment, including
 new dampers and expansion joints, modifications to breaching,
 refractory, fan drive, and controls. DSCC has been and continues
 to convert buildings on the installation to individual building
 systems and the central plant will be phased out in the future,
 but elimination of the coal fired equipment as the primary
 generator is preferred now. The new gas fired burner is rated
 below the existing burner due to the decreased demand. Estimated
 cost is $500,000 - $1,000,000. SIC code for this project is

DESC: The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC Product Manager for Small Arms,
 located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ has a requirement for a mature
 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS). The CROWS
 is a light-weight, remote weaon station capable of mounting
 the MK19 grenade machine gun (GMG), M2 HB machine gun (MG),
 M240B machine gun(MG) or M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW).
 The system is mounted on the host vehicle with the target acquisition
 and engagement control capability inside the vehicle. The CROWS
 will include: the weapon mount, an electronics support unit,
 a remote control unit, fire control processor, sensors, and
 associated hardware. The CROWS will be integrated into various
 turreted/non-turreted and ring-mount equipped vehicles and
 will provide a modern automated weapon system that enhances
 system lethality, increases battle space awareness, and provides
 digital integration opportunities. The CROWS will provide protection
 for the gunner and enhanced target acquisition, identification,
 and engagement capabilities to non-turreted light armored vehicles
 which currently place the unprotected gunner at high risk from
 enemy direct and indirect fire weapon systems. The acquisition
 will be divided into three distinct efforts which shall be
 referred to as Task I, II, and III. Task I will be a six month
 effort and will result in the delivery of two prototype CROWS
 systems meeting the technical requirements described under
 this task. Task II will be an 18 month development effort,
 performed concurrent with Task I and will result in the delivery
 of six complete CROWS systems meeting specific technical requirements.
 Task III will be a three month effort, concurrent with Task
 II, to develop and deliver integration kits for two vehicles,
 which will be used to conduct Development and Operational Tests
 culminating in Type Classification. There will also be a production
 option for up to an additional fifteen (15) CROWS units. This
 procurement requires access to classified material controlled
 under the American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA)
 Armies&apos; Standardization Program. Only industry from ABCA countries

 F-22 aircraft blends low observability with advanced avionics,
 a highly maneuverable lightweight airframe, and the ability
 to supercruise. The F-22 is designed to detect, engage, and
 destroy an opposing force before detection. Further, the F-22
 possesses air-to-air as well as air-to-ground capability. Lockheed
 Martin Aeronautical Systems (LMAS), Marietta, GA, is currently
 the prime contractor for the engineering and manufacturing
 development of the F-22 aircraft as well as the production
 of the Production Representative Test Vehicles (PRTV), PRTV
 II, and LRIP Lot 1. Responsible sources are sought for Lot
 2. Offerors must provide written notice to the contracting
 officer of their interest and capability to satisfy the government
 requirement no later than 17 Feb 00. The offeror must: (1)
 possess program management, fabrication/assembly, and quality
 assurance personnel; (2) possess the material, engineering,
 factory and flight test equipment and physical facilities;(3)
 be a responsible contractor with demonstrated recent total
 aircraft system and field support responsibility; (4) be capable
 of delivering qualified aircraft in accordance with the above
 schedule; and (5) include in their response to this notice
 evidence of these capabilities. The offeror shall also indicate
 their size status in relation to SIC code 3721. Reprocurement
 data is not available. Note that the production of the supplies
 listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended
 period of preparation for manufacture and field support. Also,
 it is impractical to distribute the applicable specifications
 with this market survey. These contract documents may be examined
 or obtained from ASC/YF, Builing 50, 2130 Fifth Street, Wright-Patterson
 AFB, OH 45433-7003. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address
 concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal
 development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not
 diminish the authority of the program director or contracting
 officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements,
 and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.
 When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality
 as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate
 in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.
 Interested parties are invited to call ASC&apos;s Ombudsman, Stephen
 J. Plaisted, at (937)255-5535 or (937)255-9095 or e-mail stephen.plaisted@wpafb.af.mil.

 (TAIS) Commerce Business Daily announcement For Potential Sources
 Sought. This command plans to issue a Request for Proposal
 (RFP) on or about 31 May 00. The proposed acquisition of the
 Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) with associated
 spares and software updates is to be full and open competition.
 Basic quantity for FY 01 production will be 5 with yearly options
 for a total of 52. Spares deliveries will be concurrent with
 the systems. Software updates will be contingent upon the evolution
 of the ABCS foundation products, and therefore, cannot be specified
 at this time. The anticipated contract type is FFP (with the
 exception of software upgrades, which cannot be defined adequately
 enough to warrant fixed price. A CPIF type CLIN is anticipated
 for this effort). The TAIS is a mobile communications and digitized
 battlefield automated system (BAS) and is the US Army&apos;s designated
 Army Battle Command System (ABCS) that provides the Force XXI
 commander with automated capabilities to perform Army Airspace
 Command and Control (A2C2) planning, enhanced A2C2 execution,
 and improved intra- and inter-Corps/Division Air Traffic Services
 functions during war and sustainment and stability operations.
 The TAIS provides the automation capability to effectively
 deconflict in real-time (mathematically and graphically) airspace
 usage conflicts and to synchronize airspace usage elements
 in the third and fourth dimensions (altitude and time). The
 TAIS shall be able to communicate (voice and data) with current
 and future military aircraft (joint/combined), civilian aircraft
 and air traffic control systems (US and host nation), and other
 US and allied forces (multinational) airspace users. The TAIS
 shall provide seamless connectivity to the existing civil aviation
 facilities to provide a &quot;drive up and plug in&quot; capability.
 The TAIS shall be capable of linking to the Theater Air Ground
 Systems (TAGS) thru an interface with the Joint Force Air Component
 Commander&apos;s automated airspace planning and communications
 systems (Contingency Theater Air Control System [CTAPS] and
 the Theater Battle Management Core System [TBMCS]). The TAIS
 shall be able to communicate electronically over Army and Joint
 Service Standard links with existing (legacy) and developmental
 airspace control systems (such as but not limited to) the CTAPS
 and the TBMCS. The TAIS shall have (as a minimum) the ability
 to electronically receive, display, manipulate, store, and
 disseminate a real-time situation picture of the airspace within
 180 NM of the TAIS; the Airspace Control Plan (ACP); the Air
 Tasking Order (ATO); the Airspace Control Order (ACO); and
 the Special Instructions (SPINS). The TAIS shall also be able
 to disseminate all TAIS products. The TAIS shall be capable
 of supporting 24-hour, all-weather operations with tactical
 A2C2 battlefield automation systems and modern ATS communications
 systems. The TAIS shall include the following secure, jam-resistant
 communications capabilities: two High Frequency (HF-SSB) radios
 (w/automatic linkage equipment (ALE)), one HF TADIL-A radio
 receiver, three Ultra-high frequency-amplitude modulated (UHF-AM)
 voice, two Very-high frequency-amplitude modulated (VHF-AM)
 voice radios, three Very-high frequency-frequency modulated
 (VHF-FM) radios (one of which must be data capable and interface
 into the Lower Tactical Internet), Mobile Subscriber Equipment
 (MSE), an Automated Data Distribution System (ADDS) link into
 the lower Tactical Internet, one UHF-FM Satellite Communications
 (SATCOM)-Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) radio, a Global
 Positioning System receiver (for system location information
 and for radio timing information), and a future Ultra Wide
 Band Radio. The TAIS shall support the transition to the Joint
 Tactical Radio System in the Architecture Design. The TAIS
 design shall include those measures required to mitigate or
 eliminate cosite interference between radios. The TAIS shall
 provide interfaces into existing telephone systems on a worldwide
 basis and have the connectivity to those systems through the
 shelter wall. The TAIS design shall protect internal components
 from EMI and HAEMP. The TAIS requirement for voice communications
 is the capability to simultaneously transmit and receive with
 the HF-SSB radio w/ALE, UHF-AM, VHF-AM, and VHF-FM radios.
 The TAIS communications capability also requires the continuous
 monitoring of VHF and UHF aviation emergency frequencies including
 the ability to transmit on these preset frequencies. All primary
 TAIS computers shall be current US Army Common Hardware and
 Software (CHS). Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government
 Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) will be reused when possible and an aggressive
 approach to software code reuse is required. The TAIS shall
 be Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment
 (DII COE) Level Six certified (Level Seven preferred). The
 TAIS software shall fully and seamlessly integrate the latest
 version of the ABCS segments and software IAW DII COE architecture.
 The TAIS shall be able to annually integrate DII COE products
 and bi-annually integrate operating system changes. The TAIS
 system technical and programmatic architecture shall also support
 spiral development. The TAIS system shall be able to function
 as a TOC server when required. TAIS software shall be capable
 of providing A2C2 information, to include an A2C2 overlay,
 to the ABCS Joint Common DataBase (JCDB) and be capable of
 extracting battlefield situation awareness information from
 the JCDB. The TAIS shall also be capable of establishing and
 maintaining external interfaces with all other ABCSs, the command
 and control systems of other services, with the Airborne Warning
 and Control System (AWACS), and Air Defense Units through the
 native format (FAAD Data Link) and the TADIL A, B, and J standards.
 The TAIS shall also have the capability to establish and maintain
 direct and real-time interface (voice and data) using United
 States Message Text Format (USMTF) and Joint Variable Message
 Format (JVMF) messages with adjacent, higher, and lower (as
 appropriate) Air Traffic Services (ATS) units and A2C2 cells
 at Echelons above Corps (EAC), Corps, and Division. TAIS software
 products shall be capable of being transmitted to and received
 by the Force Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) and
 Embedded Battle Command (EBC) systems through the ABCS architecture.
 The TAIS system shall utilize the Standard Command Post Shelter
 (SICPS) mounted on the Expanded Capacity Variant of the High
 Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The TAIS shall
 not exceed the maximum HMMWV weight parameters and must be
 transportable by no more than two C-130 sorties. Each major
 TAIS component shall be externally transportable by UH-60 helicopter.
 The follow-on TAIS system shall maintain the design and must
 duplicate all existing functions of the original TAIS. Firms
 wishing to participate in this survey must be capable of meeting
 all of the above stated TAIS requirements, to include the required
 delivery schedule stated above Prospective firms shall be able

SUBJECT: 20--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MARINE DISPLAY
POC Mr. Gary Helmick, Deputy Program Mangager (813) 828-6149
DESC: The Combatant Craft Program Office is conducting a market
 survey to obtain information concerning existing, production,
 off-the-shelf marine displays that meet our requirements and
 upon which the Combatant Craft Program Office might conduct
 performance and operational testing and evaluation. The goal
 of the testing and evaluation will be to identify and document
 candidate marine displays for potential small high-speed craft
 use and procurement. The display shall fit within a 13 inch
 by 15-inch area (objective). The display shall be mounted in
 a console. Support for a resolution of 800 by 600 (SVGA) shall
 be available to ensure compatibility with other installed components.
 The viewing size should be maximized for the available mounting
 space but should be no less than 10.4 inches (objective). The
 display shall be readable in bright sunlight. Our research
 to date indicates that a brightness of at least 1000 NITS is
 the minimum that will allow bright sunlight readability. The
 display must be night vision device compatible. The display
 should incrementally dim from brightest setting to zero (absence
 of emitted light) with controls in front of the screen (objective).
 The power requirements for the display should be 24v DC. The
 operating temperature range of the display should be at least
 from 0 to 130 F (150 F objective). For shock and vibration,
 the display should withstand accelerations and g-forces experienced
 by small (less than 80 feet in length), high-speed craft (35
 knots (50 knots plus objective)) in moderate seas (4-8 foot
 waves). Demonstrated, documented ability to meet MIL-STD-810D
 requirements is a good initial start toward demonstrating ability
 to withstand environmental conditions. A design to reasonable
 commercial shock and vibration standards may be acceptable.
 The display shall be watertight. The display shall not allow
 water intrusion when exposed to complete submersion for depths
 up to three feet for periods up to one hour (objective). A
 NEMA 4 or IP 65/66 watertight enclosure is a good initial start
 toward demonstrating watertightness. The display shall withstand
 changes in climatic conditions and external pressures ranging
 from those that may be found at sea level while underway in
 any part of the world to those experienced in the cargo hold
 of an aircraft flying up to thirty thousand feet (forty thousand
 feet objective). The display will be inserted on a craft that
 requires a long (~50ft) video cable run between a computer
 and display. The display should meet as many commercial and
 military interface standards as reasonable to allow for the
 use of the maximum types and models of computers and video
 sources. The intent of this announcement is to identify potential
 sources for the potential procurement of existing off-the-shelf
 test articles to demonstrate and document performance characteristics.
 The Combatant Craft Office has no interest in funding the development
 of displays tailored for this specific use. If test article
 testing conducted by the Combatant Craft Program Office&apos;s demonstrates
 requirements/needs are met, follow on procurements by individual
 Combatant Craft Program Office units on an as needed basis
 may be authorized. Firms interested in providing information
 should submit, in writing, a description of their product which
 fulfills the Combatant Craft Program Office requirement, testing
 results demonstrating product performance, along with price
 and availability information. This announcement is a request
 for information only and is not a request for proposal (RFP)
 or announcement of solicitation. The government shall not be
 obligated to procure any item as a result of this request.
 The government makes no guarantees that there will be a follow-on
 solicitation or procurement. Telephone inquiries should be
 directed to Mr. Peter Depa at 813-828-6149. The Government

DESC: This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial
 items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart
 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included
 in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;
 quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will
 not be issued. This procurement will be conducted under the
 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The government intends
 to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. One (1) each
 model number 6428 Swept Tunable Laser Source with wavelength
 range: 1500-1575 nm; mode-hop-free range: 1520-1570 nm; output
 power:&gt;6 dBm (1520-1570 nm) and&gt;0 dBm (1500-1575 nm); sweep
 speed: 1-100 nm/s; sweep linearity: 35 pm total deviation;
 relative wavelength accuracy: 35 pm; repeatability: 5pm, resolution:
 1 pm; options LV (LabView Driver) and H (hand pad-remote user
 interface). NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the above item from
 New Focus, Incorporated of Santa Clara, CA in accordance with
 FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).
 Currently the Flight Loads Lab at NASA/DFRC requires their
 own fiber optic strain measurement system and is currently
 developing a new strain system identical to one under development
 at NASA Langley Research Center. It is essential that both
 systems be identical in order to ensure that when results are
 compared between the two systems, that if discrepancies exist,
 system errors due to the laser can be eliminated. The time
 and cost to develop another system would be too costly and
 would delay the Integrated Vehicle Health Management Program
 at NASA/DFRC. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those
 in effect through FAC 97-16. The SIC code and the small business
 size standard for this procurement are 3674, and 500 employees,

 size status for this procurement. All qualified responsible
 business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered
 by the agency. Delivery to NASA/DFRC is required within 30
 days ARO. Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating

 described above are due by 4:00 pm PST on April 25, 2000 and
 may be mailed to Michelle Vial of NASA/DFRC, P.O. Box 273 -

DESC: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
 Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) located in Boulder,
 CO requires one (1) RF amplifier to be used in a pulse Doppler
 radar wind profiler (RWP). RWP=92s are highly = sensitive and
 operate similar to other Doppler radars and produce winds by
 capturing and averaging clear-air backscatter pulse (coded
 or non-coded) energy directed nearly vertically, typically
 through the use of a ground- based planar coaxial-collinear
 antenna. The required salient features = of the amplifier are:
 1) operate at a center frequency of 449 MHz with a minus 1
 dB bandwidth of 10 MHz, 2) produce 2 kW peak power at its output
 port, 3) operate at a duty cycle of up 20 per cent, 4) operate
 with a pulse length of 0.4 to 30.0 microseconds, 5) utilize

 nanoseconds, 7) utilize input RF power of plus 0.0 to plus
 30.0 dBm (vendor specified), 8) operate into any load impedance
 at any phase (to infinite VSWR) with automatic recovery, 9)
 have a nominal input/out impedance of 50 ohms, 10) produce
 no more than minus 60 dBc spurious content, 11) produce no
 more than plus 50 dBc harmonic content, 12) produce no more

 kilograms (1 pound)) of the black and green inks each; (2).
 1 container (68.04 kilograms (150 pounds)) of non-heatset sheet-fed
 intaglio black cylinder-wipe ink; (3). 1 container (68.04 kilograms
 (150 pounds)) of non-heatset sheet-fed intaglio green cylinder-wipe

 Requirement (VOCs), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Identification
 and Listing of Hazardous Waste, Premanufacture Notification,
 Proposition 65, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act,
 Total Toxic Organics, and Air Toxics. Only inks that are in
 compliance with Safety and Environmental requirements will
 be tested. Each supplier is limited to one green and one black
 ink submission. Suppliers will only be allowed to submit up
 to two (2) follow-up ink formulations to improve deficiencies/weaknesses
 per initial black and green ink submission. All testing will
 be conducted around BEP production schedules. Therefore, all
 ink testing shall be done at the convenience of the Government.
 Additionally, the Government reserves the right to conduct
 any testing at either the BEP_s Washington, D.C. or Fort Worth,
 Texas facility. Testing: Phase-I of the trial process will
 be the Pre-Screening Evaluation, which will consist of laboratory
 analysis of each ink. Inks must be in conformance with all
 applicable Federal and District of Columbia laws and regulations.
 Only after fully meeting the Phase-I requirements will the
 ink be evaluated under Phase-II. Phase-II of the trial process
 will be the actual press evaluation. The press evaluation will
 consist of determining that the sample inks are in compliance
 with specification I:ICWC-1C, dated April 10, 2000. The Federal
 Reserve Note $1 design image carrier will be used to assess
 the printing and processing characteristics of the Sheet-fed
 intaglio ink formulations. Upon written request, the BEP will
 provide standard drawdowns to interested suppliers for color
 matching. The ink samples should meet the requirements of the
 BEP Statement of Work and it_s associated documents for developing
 Sheet-fed currency inks. All unused ink shall be returned to
 the supplier at the supplier_s expense. Interested parties
 must submit a _Letter of Intent_ to participate to the Contract
 Specialist not later than May 5, 2000. This pre-testing effort
 will be completed by July 14, 2000. However, the Government

PART: SPECIAL NOTICES
OFFADD: U.S.EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory,
 Cincinnati, OH 45268
SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE TECHNOLOGIES
 TO TREAT MTBE
DESC: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agnecy (EPA) is announcing
 a Request for Applications (RFA) to Demonstrate Technologies
 to Treat Methyl-t-Butyl Ether (MTBE) for field demonstrations
 of MTBE treatment technologies. The RFA will be available during
 the week of April 17, 2000 at http://www.epa.gov/oust/mtbe/mtbedemo.htm
 Applicants will have 5 weeks to submit proposals. This announcement
 describes the purpose of the demonstration, the demonstration
 host site, the technology selection process, and the tentative
 project schedule. Background EPA is engaged in an effort to
 demonstrate and verify the cost and performance of drinking
 water treatment technologies and site cleanup methods for MTBE
 and its by products. The focus of the field demonstrations
 is to conduct evaluations of field technologies and processes
 for treatment of drinking water and for groundwater/aquifer
 materials at the contamination source. The drinking water technologies
 demonstrated will be above-ground (ex situ) and the aquifer
 cleanup technologies may be either ex situ (e.g., bioreactor)
 or in situ (e.g., bioremediation). The results of the evaluations
 will provide reliable engineering, performance, and cost information
 for treatment decision makers and technology vendors. Demonstration
 Host Site EPA has selected the Naval Construction Battalion
 Center (CBC) Port Hueneme, California to host demonstrations
 of both drinking water and aquifer treatment technologies.
 The aquifer treatment demonstration will take place at the
 Naval Exchange (NEX) Service Station site on CBC Port Hueneme.
 Based on NEX Gasoline Station inventory records, approximately
 4,000 gallons of leaded gasoline and 6,800 gallons of premium
 unleaded gasoline containing MTBE were released from product
 delivery lines into the subsurface between September 1984 and
 March 1985. The area considered to be the source area consists
 of a 9-acre MTBE plume with the BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene,
 ethylbenzene, and isomers of xylene) extending more than 1,200
 feet from the release site. The MTBE dissolved plume extends
 another 36 acres. The plume is located primarily under open
 hardstands parade ground, parking lots, and storage areas.
 The geology at the site consists of unconsolidated sands, silts,
 and clays with minor amounts of gravel and fill material. A
 shallow semi-perched aquifer is the uppermost groundwater unit.
 This unit is contained within the first three depositional
 soil units, which consist of an upper silty sand unit, an underlying
 fine- to coarse-grained sand unit, and a basal clay unit. The
 NEX plume is confined within this aquifer and is within 22
 feet of the ground surface. For ex-situ treatment technologies,
 contaminated groundwater can be delivered to the technology
 system at up to 10 gallons per minute. Technology Selection
 A panel of technology and MTBE experts will select up to a
 total of six technology vendors to demonstrate drinking water
 and aquifer treatment. Both in-situ and ex-situ technologies
 will be considered. This RFA is open to all technology types
 including biological, chemical, physical and thermal treatment.
 Thetentative schedule for the RFA process is as follows: RFA
 Available-4/26/00; Proposals due - 6/9/00; Technology selection
 completed - week of 7/10/00; Begin field demonstrations - 9/00.
 The length of field application will depend on the types of
 technologies selected. Demonstrations may require up to approximately
 one year. Technology vendors will be responsible for installing
 and operating their technology at the site for the duration
 of the demonstration. More information on responsibilities
 and technology selection criteria are contained in the RFA.
 Funding Mechanism The funding mechanism will be in the form
 of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRDA).
 Funds are not exchanged between EPA and the technology supplier.
 Prior to the demonstration, the technology supplier(s) and
 EPA sign the no-funds CRDA, which defines the areas of responsibility.
 The RFA (EPA/600/F-00/007) will be available the week of April
 24, 2000 at http://www.epa.gov/oust/mtbe/mtbedemo.htm . Hard
 copy will be available from the U.S. EPA/National Service Center
 for Environmental Publications, P.O. Box 42419, Cincinnati,
 OH 45242, Telephone: (513) 489-8190 or (800) 490-9198, Facsimile:

 only, contact: Dr. Carl Enfield, 513-569-7489, enfield.carl@epa.gov
 1 The Agency has formed a workgroup to plan and conduct the
 field evaluations. This workgroup consists of staff in the
 following EPA offices: National Risk Management Research Laboratory
 (NRMRL); Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER)
 Office of Underground Storage Tanks and the Technology Innovation
 Office; Office of Water (OW); Office of Air and Radiation (OAR);
 and Region 9. In addition, the California Water Quality Resources
 Control Board, California Department of Health Services, and
 Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Board are participating
 on the workgroup.
