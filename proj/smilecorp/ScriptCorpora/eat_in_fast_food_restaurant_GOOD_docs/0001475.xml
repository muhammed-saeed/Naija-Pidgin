		What Price Paradise? Learning Experience An Economic Quandary Traditions Kept And Lost

 In the remote Marshall Islands, residents  dream and save for years for a new life in Arkansas. 

Dainah Amram remembers when her son Stevenson  was a little boy who slept snuggled in the crook of her arm. In  the small cinder-block shack on the Majuro atoll where he was raised,  only memories remain of Stevenson. Three years ago, Amram borrowed  $2,000 to send her son away.
Its unclear if he will ever return.
The loan bought Stevenson a one-way plane ticket to the United States,  where he eventually settled in Springdale, Ark. For a year and a  half, Amram spent more than half of her wages to repay the debt.  She says it was worth the cost.
I saved his life,Amram said.
Her son, she explains, was saved from an empty future in the neighborhood  outside her window. White streets of crushed shell and coral narrowly  divide clusters of plywood and cinder-block homes, few of which  have running water.
Thousands of Marshall Islanders like Stevenson now live in Springdale.  This is the story of their past, their present and perhaps their  future as they become Arkansans.
The Majuro atoll is the capital of the Republic of the Marshall  Islands, a nation of hundreds of small islands flung across thousands  of square miles of Pacific Ocean.
From the air, Majuro looks like an impossibly thin ribbon of green,  marooned in a world of blue. Atolls are formed by coral reefs that  grow upon the remnants of ancient, submerged volcanoes. After eons,  the atolls form as rings of narrow islands and islets surrounding  sapphire-blue lagoons.
For time out of memory, the Marshallese survived on these strips  of land by fishing in the atollslagoons and gathering fruit.  When the U.S. Navy took control of Majuro in 1944, the sailors encountered  roughly 1,000 people living in thatched huts and lush jungle.
The population on Majuro now is 23,700 or more, thanks to the largess  of Americans who have subsidized the islands with hundreds of millions  of dollars. Imported food sustains a population that far exceeds  the islandsresources.
Most of the islanders live in crowded neighborhoods like Amrams,  with an average of eight people to a house.
 In  many ways, Majuro is like an enormous waiting room whose residents  are stuck between two worlds, having abandoned their old culture  for a modern life that has yet to materialize.
Every week people move to Majuro or Ebeye, the Marshall Islandsother urbanized island, abandoning lush outer islands where traditions  have sustained them for generations. The densely packed neighborhoods  of Majuro and Ebeye largely have been stripped of vegetation. The  inhabitants live in a cash economy.
Trading Micronesian tradition for modernity has come at a cost for  young men like Stevenson Enoch, Amrams son, who uses his fathers  last name. Their choices are few.
A recent Marshall Islands government report said there are only  85 more jobs in the islands than there were a decade earlier. But  there were 3,189 more people seeking jobs. Alcoholism is more common  than lucrative employment. The suicide rate is among the highest  in the world.
The Marshall Islandspopulation has soared in the past half-centuryit was just 14,163 in 1958 and reached 30,873 in 1980, according  to census records. Now its about 58,000.
Springdale has become an escape valve for the Marshallese. The small  industrial city is host to the largest population of Marshall Islanders  outside of the home islands.
Many islanders call Springdale theland of opportunity,probably unaware that Arkansas license plates once carried that  slogan.
Marshallese immigrants benefit from extraordinarily close ties to  the United States that were codified when the countries signed the  Compact of Free Association in 1986, when the islands gained their  independence. Marshallese are allowed to live and work in the United  States indefinitely without visas. As a result, few of those who  immigrate seek U.S. citizenship.
Enoch, 27, was hard at work just before dawn recently, finishing  his nine-hour shift at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Springdale. His  journey of 6,000 miles led him to the shredded-cheese section of  the store, where he stocks shelves.
Dressed in baggy jeans and a T-shirt, he opened small boxes full  of cheese packets. He held them up for comparison against a display  where more than 100 varieties of cheese hung. Then he matched the  package labels to those on the wall and hung them there in bunches.
Enoch says he makes $8 an hour. Thats quadruple his mothers  pay. On the rare occasion when he calls her, she asks him if he  will return. He says no. He thinks he would likely end up unemployed  and living in his mothers home.
I wont go back and let her work for me,he said.
 Thousands  of Marshallese have made the same choice. Working in chicken plants,  factories and fast-food restaurants, they enjoy a lifestyle that  only a few could afford back home. In Springdale public schools,  their children get a better education than most of the top-ranked  private-schoolsstudents on the islands.
Its unclear exactly how many Marshall Islanders call Springdale  home. A special U.S. Census Bureau survey in 2001 indicated that  there were 2,000 to 6,000 of the islanders in Springdale, a city  that then had about 46,000 residents.
Since that survey, the influx has continued, islanders say. In the  Springdale School District, the number of children speaking Marshallese  as a first language grew from 226 in 2000 to 623 this fall.
Yet, the Marshallese often go unnoticed in Springdale, overshadowed  by the 23,500 Hispanics who arrived in Northwest Arkansas during  the 1990s. Many Marshallese say its not uncommon for them  to be mistaken for immigrants from Mexico or Central America.
Springdale resident Debbie McCarty says she assumed that the immigrants  working with her at the Bentonville Plastics factory wereall  Mexicans.Then she noticed something odd about themthey didnt wear shoes on the factory floor. Bosses let them  put mesh coverings on their feet. McCarty asked around and discovered  that they were islanders who go barefoot while inside, according  to their custom.
Virtually everyone in the Marshall Islands has heard of Arkansas.  Opinions about faraway Springdale vary widely. Some people dream  of one day going there. Others believe that their migrant brethren  have abandoned their culture.
But few Marshallese are untouched by the Arkansas community, regardless  of what they think of it. Moses Alik, for example, says he will  never move to Arkansas. He lives and works on Majuro and doesnt  want to leave his home and family.
Nonetheless, when presented a baseball cap bearing the University  of Arkansas logo, Alik flashed a big smile and exclaimed:Razorback!

 LONG ROAD TO SPRINGDALE 

 The  streets of Majuro begin to stir just after sunrise. Dented, dusty  taxicabs troll up and down the main road, gathering residents for  their 50-cent rides to work.

A woman in a brown dress pushes a wheelbarrow  full of garbage across the road, toward a large orange bin already  brimming with the neighborhoods trash. She wedges her load  next to the large bin and piece by piece heaves her refuse over  the side. Beyond her, waves roll in from the Pacific, stroking the  beach in a steady rhythm.
Across the street, another family starts its day in a cluster of  shacks surrounded by a wall of corrugated tin. Three girls, perhaps  10 years old, squat around a bucket full of water in a courtyard.  They take turns dipping a cup, pouring water over their heads and  splashing their faces.
It is a safe bet at this time of morning that Gordon Bellu will  be somewhere nearby, already hard at work. Wiry and energetic, Bellu  is manager of two gas stations owned by one of the islandslarger companies, Robert Reimers Enterprises. Frequently, he crosses  the main road to check on the properties, a walkie-talkie in his  hand and a cell phone clipped to his belt.
Bellu puts in 12-hour days with one goal in mindmoving his  family to Arkansas. His sister lives in Springdale and tells him  stories about high-paying jobs and great public schools. He wants  his two children to get an education there and avoid the kind of  life he has lived on Majuro.
The long road to Springdale is steeply uphill for Marshallese like  Bellu. Their wages are far lower than those of their counterparts  in Arkansas. At the same time, the consumer goods they buy are more  expensive because they are shipped from abroad. A 12-ounce can of  Spam, an island favorite, sold on Ebeye island recently for $4.  At a Wal-Mart in Springdale, a can costs $1.90.
 One-way  airfare to Arkansas costs around $1,500, a small fortune for someone  who earns $2 an hourthe minimum wage on the islands. Many  Marshallese take out loans for the trip and send one family member,  who then works in Springdale and saves money to bring the next relative.  Bellu wants to take a different route.I dont want to  leave some behind. My kids are not old enough to take care of themselves,  and my wifeI dont want to leave her. I want us all  to go,he said.
Bellu has avoided many of the pitfalls that keep some Marshallese  penniless. He swore off alcohol 11 years ago because it was too  expensive. He has won four promotions in four years, going from  sales clerk to manager. He earns an unusually high $5 an hour.
Every two weeks, he manages to sock away $25 in a savings account  that he hopes will get him to Arkansas. At last word, he had saved  roughly $800. He dips into the account every now and then to buy  school supplies or food for his children.Thats why  it goes so slow,he said with a laugh.
While the Republic of the Marshall Islands is one of the more remote  places on the globe, it has a close relationship with the United  States that is almost unparalleled. Marshallese serve in the U.S.  armed forces. There is a U.S. post office on Majuro, and the country  has a ZIP code and uses the American dollar.
This relationship started during World War II when American soldiers  captured the Marshall Islands from the Japanese, who had ruled them  for 30 years. More than 600 U.S. Marines, airmen and sailors lost  their lives in several battles across the islands; the Japanese  suffered thousands of casualties.
The U.S. government administered the islands after the war as a  trust territory for the United Nations, until they gained independence  in 1986. The Americans built schools and roads and sent bureaucrats  to run it all, said Robert Kiste, an anthropologist who has studied  the islands for 40 years. The United Statesinterest in the  islands was purely strategic because of their location and remoteness,  Kiste said.
That was the only reason the U.S. would even agree to [having]  a trust territory,Kiste said.It was strategic and  remains that way.The right ofstrategic denialallows the United States to control which ships pass through 750,000  square miles of ocean around the islands.
 The  main island of Kwajalein atoll, the largest atoll in the world,  is home to a U.S. Army base that includes the Ronald Reagan Ballistic  Missile Defense Site, a critical component of efforts to build a  missile defense shield. The same remoteness that allows missile  testing played another role in history. On the morning of July 1,  1946, an enormous mushroom cloud rose over the Bikini atoll in the  northwest corner of the Marshall Islands. Over the next 12 years,  the United States detonated 67 atomic or hydrogen bombs in the area.  The tests cost the islanders dearly. Residents of Bikini and nearby  atolls were relocated to other islands and still live in a kind  of exile. Bikini remains uninhabited.
Hundreds of residents of the Rongelap atoll were exposed to radioactive  fallout when the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb near Bikini  in 1954. Dozens died of cancer and other diseases. Rongelap remains  largely uninhabited and contaminated with radiation. The United  States has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to compensate the  Marshallese for the atomic testing, including for cancer deaths  believed to have been caused by the radiation.
All of this paved the way for the Republic of the Marshall Islands  to remain intertwined with the United States after it attained independence.  Tony DeBrum, one of the chief Marshallese negotiators of the Compact  of Free Association, said immigration rights was a cornerstone of  the agreement. His hope was that the rights would pave the way to  opportunity that his government couldnt offer.
I think the story of Springdale is a crowning jewel in that  hope,he said.

 FOUNDING FATHER 

 The  thousands of islanders living in Springdale can trace their passage  directly to one manJohn Moody.

Moody recently returned home from working the  night shift at a Tyson Foods plant in Clarksville and plopped down  on a couch in his mobile home in the nearby town of Altus. He was  the first Marshall Islander to move to Springdale and inadvertently  created the immigrant community.
I said, if they want a better life, they better come here.  So I start bringing them over, little by little. All those people  I brought, they still live there today,he said.I thought  they would go back home,he continued, smiling as if the whole  thing seemed too strange.I didnt know that they would  bring their neighbors and their friends and their brothers and their  sisters.
Moody fulfilled a lifelong dream when he moved to the United States  in 1979 with a scholarship to attend the University of Oklahoma.  But his schooling in the Marshall Islands didnt equip him  for college classes, he said. He spent more time boning up on his  English than completing his homework.
A friend of Moodys suggested that they work in a chicken plant  in Muskogee, Okla. The pay was $3.25 an houra fortune in  Moodys eyes, though just a little above minimum wage at the  time. He dropped out of college and started working full time. Around  1986, Moody moved to Springdale, where he eventually got a job with  Tyson Foods.
Around that time, there were Marshallese communities scattered throughout  the United States. Interviews with dozens of islanders indicate  that most of the communities started when the people arrived there  to attend school on scholarships as Moody had done. The main communities  that remain today are in Honolulu; Enid, Okla.; Costa Mesa, Calif.;  and Portland, Ore. The second-largest community after Springdale  is in Hawaii. The populations of most of the other communities are  estimated to be in the hundreds. Increasingly, Springdale is the  place to be.
Moody urged his relatives to move to Springdale during the 1990s,  talking up the schools and jobs. It wasnt a hard sell, since  the unemployment rate on the Marshall Islands grew from 12.5 percent  in 1988 to 30.9 percent in 1999.
 Springdale,  meanwhile, was experiencing a boom in industrial jobs at chicken  plants and other factories where English skills werent a necessity.  Step by step, Springdale became a sweet spot for Marshallese pursuing  a new life in America. While there were plentiful jobs elsewhere,  Springdale also offered a low cost of living and a slower pace.  In the tightly knit community of islanders, word spread fast about  Springdales advantages.
Paul Lang, a native of the islands, left Costa Mesa when he heard  about land prices in Springdale. He now owns a house in the Arkansas  city.They cannot afford to rent those houses over there,he said, referring to California.Right now, a two-bedroom  is like $1,000-something a month.
Langs Marshallese neighbors open their garage doors on warm  sunny days to reveal improvised living rooms where men and women  lounge on couches. Children roam from home to home as if they all  belong to one family.
On Springdales congested highways, a large number of cars  have tall CB radio antennas. The radios are popular with Marshallese  who use them to communicate just as they do back home where telephone  service is unreliable. They have a CB radio group calledBig  YokweBig Hello.
Among the new subdivisions in Springdale, houses here and there  have shoe racks on front porches piled high with flip-flops and  work boots, a sure sign of Marshallese within. Lang said some problems  arose in the early days of the Marshallese community. The first  immigrants werent aware of U.S. private property rights. Some  islanders drank heavily on the weekends and ended up on the wrong  side of the law when they passed out in neighborsyards, he  said. Most behavior like that soon stopped.
Brian Simmons, spokesman for the Springdale Police Department, said  the Marshallese are a law-abiding lot who havent put a strain  on the citys law enforcement officers. Since most Marshallese  in Springdale are bilingual, the police havent hired any translators.I think that they are probably a little quieter than what  you would expect,Simmons said.They really appear to  me to be a group of people that dont like trouble.
The Marshallese are on the lower economic rungs of Springdales  work force. During the night shift at Tyson FoodsRandall  Road plant, about half of the workers are islanders. They are also  common on the factory floor of Rockline Industries, which makes  baby wipes and scented tissues.
There are slightly more men than women among the Marshallese in  Springdale, according to the 2001 special census. The survey indicated  that men and women alike get jobs when they arrive in Arkansas,  and 77 percent of the population above age 16 is in the work force.  Neighbors watch over one anothers children while parents work.
The trailblazer for the islanders has moved on. Moody said he chose  to work in Clarksville and live in Altus because Springdale became  too crowded. He still gets calls from new residents in Springdale  who are trying to figure out where to get a drivers license  or buy a whole pig to roast for parties.
I dont even know them,he said.They know  my name, though.

 A KING IN LITTLE MAJURO 

 Stevenson  Enoch recently ended his shift around 7 a.m. and walked out of Wal-Mart  into a misty rain. Clouds on the horizon had just started to redden  with the dawn. In some ways, the landscape Enoch saw is similar  to that of his home island. Springdales one-story strip malls  and stores form a jagged low skyline not unlike Majuros main  street.
Differences are apparent. The Wal-Mart parking lot appeared larger  than the grounds of the Marshall Islands Capitol. The cars and buildings  are luxurious compared with those on Majuro. Enoch got into his  car and drove toward U.S. 412, a traffic-snarled four-lane road  bordered by factories, shopping centers and a few grassy fields.
Springdale has been a hub of blue-collar and agricultural jobs since  the 1880s, said Brooks Blevins, an Ozarks historian. Apple orchards  created a boom that was later replaced by poultry farming. The city  is now home to Tyson Foods, the worlds biggest meat company,  0along with smaller poultry firms like Georges Inc.
Springdale isnt a tourist destination, but it long has drawn  foreign-born workers like the Marshallese, said Susan Young, outreach  director for the citys Shiloh Museum.Its kind  of reflective of what people did in the pioneer days,Young  said.Youd get here and write letters home saying:Man,  you need to come to Northwest Arkansas. Its the land of milk  and honey.That leads to these chain migrations. They come  here for jobs first, quality of life second.
The Marshallese in Springdale were helped by the earlier, larger  wave of arriving Hispanics. The Spanish-speaking immigrants not  only attracted far more attentionor criticism, in some casesthey gave public agencies experience in dealing with new  residents who didnt speak English.
While most of the islanders are bilingual, they sometimes need help  dealing with complex issues in English. The Washington County unit  of the state Department of Health has at least five full-time Hispanic  translators and has added one for the Marshallese. At Springdale  public schools, the English as a Second Language program hired a  Marshallese tutor in 1997 when the need became apparent.
The Jones Center for Families, a public community center in downtown  Springdale, has become a second home for many islanders. They celebrate  the birth of their nation there with a festival organized by their  own civic group, commemorating May 1, 1979, when the countrys  constitution was signed, and Oct. 21, 1986, when full independence  was gained. The event draws thousands of Marshallese from around  the country.
Kessai Note, now president of the Marshall Islands, joined the celebration  in 2003 when he was campaigning for the office. Enochs recent  drive home from work took him through a quiet subdivision of single-family  houses. The houses gave way to apartment buildings on Christy Drive.
On a typical warm day, groups of Marshallese women sit outside,  chatting in their native tongue and wearing the colorful shin-length  dresses favored back home. Groups of children run through the yards  playing games. Marshallese boys play basketball in the parking lot  as the steady beat of salsa music blares from a nearby truck where  Hispanic teenagers linger. Like Majuro, there are communal trash  bins along the street, overflowing with garbage.
McCarty, the woman who worked with the Marshallese at the plastics  factory, lives with her husband and granddaughter in an apartment  complex thats also home to several Marshallese families.Theyre  really close-knit, very family-oriented,McCarty said.They  all stay together, and they all take care of each other.
Cultures bump up against one another in crowded neighborhoods. Islanders  tend to enter houses without knocking. Shortly after McCarty moved  into her home, a Marshallese woman simply walked in the door. The  two couldnt communicate, and the neighbor soon turned to leave.She didnt understand anything I said until I said,God  bless you.She turned around and gave me a hug after that.Just inside the door of Enochs two-room apartment, a visitor  encounters the telltale pile of shoes and flip-flops.
Eight people live here. Their living condition and the route they  took to Springdale, are typical of the Marshallese community in  Arkansas. Residents in this apartment live under the auspices of  Mickey Mackphay, a middle-aged man who was born and raised on Majuro.  Mackphay, one of 12 children, quit school during the third grade  after his parents divorced. He hung around with older kids and moved  from house to house.
I can see that there is no one going to show me what is the  right thing to do. So I just live my own life,he said. He  drank alcohol, joined a gang and considered suicide when he was  a teenager. Mackphay said his life turned around when he found religion  and got married on Majuro. He settled down and got a job driving  a taxi.
 Soon,  Mackphay found Springdale. His aunt, who lived there, had sent a  videotaped message home. Mackphay still recalls the camera panning  over the interior of a fast food restaurant, so neat and clean,  with luxurious tables and chairs.When I look, I can see nice  clothes. Beautiful car. Beautiful house. I said:Oh man. Maybe  one day if I am going to be there, it will be a different kind of  life,he recalled. He saved enough money for a one-way  plane ticket.
Mackphay, arriving alone in Springdale in 1995, quickly found employment  at a Tyson Foods plant. He eventually rented the apartment and sent  for his wife and two daughters to live with him. His home soon became  a landing pad for other Marshallese moving to the area. Enoch and  his girlfriend moved in because she is the niece of Mackphays  wife.
Family ties are so strong on the Marshall Islands that they overwhelm  concerns about personal property or sharing space, said Kiste, the  anthropologist. When the islanders migrate to other countries, the  family ties remain strong. They often depend on relatives for shelter,  food and transportation when arriving somewhere new.
The special U.S. Census survey in 2001 found an average of seven  people living in each Marshallese residence in Springdale. Crowded  conditions in some Springdale residences prompted the City Council  to adopt an ordinance in October that limits the number of occupants  in each dwelling on the basis of the amount of floor space. No one  had been cited for violating the ordinance by years end.
Despite crowded conditions by American standards, Marshallese in  Springdale enjoy far more amenities than most of their friends and  relatives have back home. Virtually all of the Arkansas homes have  air conditioning, compared with 30 percent on the islands. They  also have dependable electricity and water 24 hours a day; service  on the islands is spotty.
Like many other Marshallese in Springdale, Mackphay says he probably  will never return home.
If he returned, Mackphay would sink to the bottom of a tribal pecking  order. On the islands, land is owned by a chieftain class called  theiroij.Most residents essentially rent the land  they live on from the iroij and support the chiefs with gifts of  money and food.
Born a commoner, Mackphay is now the iroij of Apartment D on Christy  Drive. He no longer works, and during the days is usually asleep  on a pad in the middle of the apartments tidy living room.  The walls around him are decorated with hand-woven artwork and portraits  of his family. Back home, Mackphay would stand in line behind half  a dozen siblings to inherit rights to the land his family has used  for generations.I got too much family back on Majuro,he said.
For every Mickey Mackphay who has made it in Springdale, there seems  to be a Gordon Bellu on Majuro hoping to follow him. Bellu says  he gets off of work at 5 p.m. But somehow every night seems to be  an exception. Near 6 oclock one night in September, he was  stranded on a desolate stretch of road near the Marshall Islands  energy plant. He went there to deliver a rental car and was waiting,  walkie-talkie in hand, for a ride back home. Bellu said he wont  buy a personal car, though he likely could afford it. He wants to  save his money.I have to think about getting to the mainland.
