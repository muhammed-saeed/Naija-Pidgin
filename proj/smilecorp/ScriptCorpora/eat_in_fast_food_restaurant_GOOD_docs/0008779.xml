	<description>... with my husband , I was ordering a soda at a fast food restaurant ... pads and hurry to make the line of the female cashier. ... hold it until we got to the next rest stop or exit.</description>

		The time was 2:36 and school had just ended. I was really eager to leave the campus: one, because school sucks and two, because my mom was picking me up in the ghettoest van imaginable and I didn&apos;t want anyone to see it. Of course being the great mother she is, she parked the hunk-a-junk right, smack dab in front of the school where it could be seen by pretty much everyone and their mother. no pun intended. So there I am already embarrassed that i had to be seen in front of the piece of crap. I go to get into the thing via the sliding door. I open the slider and it decides not to stop. Yeah,it just kept sliding and fell off its higes all together and clunked right onto the ground. I had to go to the wood shop and ask for a screwdriver to fix it. It, to this very day, haunts me when I sleep. --Tyler 

 Once I was at the apartment of this guy I really like, and he was 
 using the restroom when I really had to use the bathroom too. I 
 couldn&apos;t wait for him to finish, and I didn&apos;t know what to do, so I 
 just dropped my pants and crapped right there on the floor, and I 
 swear I was going to pick it up with a paper towel and throw it away, 
 but right then he came out of the bathroom. I threw a pillow over my 
 crap and hoped he wouldn&apos;t notice. Unfortunately he knew something 
 was up, so he picked up the pillow and there was my crap. He was 
 like, &quot;What the Hell is this&quot;, and I was so scared that I just made 
 up this story. I said &quot;Your dog just ran in here and pooped on the 
 floor, but I didn&apos;t want the dog to be embarrassed so I covered it 
 up.&quot; And he said &quot;I don&apos;t have a dog, I think you&apos;re lying&quot;. And I&apos;m 
 thinking gee what tipped you off. So he knew it was me, and he picked 
 up the poop and he threw it at me. So I said &quot;I guess this means we 
 aren&apos;t having dinner?&quot; So I had to leave covered in my own poop. 
 Oddly enough I did hear from him a few days later when he called to 
 ask if I would pay the bill for the carpet cleaning he had to have. 
 Then he asked out my twin sister, and told her the story. Now they 
 are getting married, and I have to be in the wedding, and they sent 
 me a diaper to wear under my dress. Oh my gosh, I wish I could die. -- Anne 

 This one time I was in the school library looking at some books then, as usual, I got bored then went with my friends to go see some magazines. Well, while browsing through the magazines I saw what I thought was a sample of a perfume then I smelled it. My friends started laughing at me and I did not know why then I turn the page and I see that the &quot;perfume&quot; I smelled was of these new scented tampons!!! then me and my friends start cracking up and I realized, always check what your going to smell! 

 My boyfriend and I were looking for houses. We saw this cute little house by a bakery!! I just love cake. We opened the door and started looking around. All of a sudden someone came in and said. &quot;What are you doing in my house?&quot; It turned out that the owner of the house had just moved there and was only there to lock it up, she had forgotten to take the for sale sign off. -Angie 

 I&apos;d have to say that my most embarrasing moment would have to be a few weeks ago! I was wearing these really really baggy pants, right? Well, I had spray painted my shoes the night before, so my pants kept sticking to the end of my shoes. During my lunch hour at school, we are allowed to go outside on the football field. So.. i decided to eat on the bleachers with my friends but as I was climbing up the bleachers.. BAM. I fell striaght on my effing face. Then two minutes later, i fall AGAIN, but this time on the concrete. All this was infront of about 80 kids. AND my crush saw me fall both times, he decided to help me up, take me somewhere away from my friends and ask me to be his girlfriend. SEE, Good can come out of embarrasing moments!! - Emily 

 I was at an under age dance club with all my friends. I had a new short short mini skirt with a belly shirt and i thought i looked so hot in it, my crush asked me to dance, i thought i was sooooo cool. After the dance i was walked over to my friends where they were at the bar drinking sodas. I walked over towards my friends thinking i was soo cool because i just got back from dancing with the cutest guy in there. i turned around to look at him and saw him and his friends were all watchnig me i thought to myself i must look so hot tonight. i was wearing a really short skirt so when i approched to my friends i carefully went to a stool to sit at the bar. but instead of sitting in a stool i sat in a great big trashcan. my butt fell in the trash and only my arms and legs were out of the trash can. 

 My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldn&apos;t see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldn&apos;t sleep through class. He hadn&apos;t been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasn&apos;t my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, &quot;Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.&quot; His reply? Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said &quot;It&apos;s all good.&quot; -Reta- 

 One time when I was younger, about 5 or 6, me and my family went to a hotel with my cousin. I was walking around with my brother and my cousin and I couldnt see the pool over the gate because we were on the third floor. My brother and my cousin kept making fun of how I was to short to see over the gate so I stuck my big head threw it. And yeah you guessed it. My head got stuck in the gate. My brother had to call the maids in the hotel to cut the gate and get my head out. They still laugh at me about that. And they told my boyfriend. I mean....... COME ON!!!!!!!!! 

 I went to camp in Arizona when i was about ten years old, and i had just started &quot;going out&quot; with this other girl who was apparently a model somewhere.. anyway i had to go #2 so i told her i had to leave and went to talk to my counselor. I asked him where the latrine was and he didnt know, so instead of asking quietly, he shouts across the whole camp &quot;hey, [my name] needs to use the latrene, do you know where it is?&quot; to some other counselor. Of course they have to discuss it for a while, meanwhile this girl heard it and was looking really ashamed. Anyway they finally tell me where it is ( we are out camping so the latrine is a dug out hole near a log..), and i start running embarrassed towards it. Apparently its far from the camp along a road, so i start walking down the road looking for it. I found the toilet paper, which is a sign of whether or not the latrine is occupied. I continue walking looking for it and i can&apos;t find it for about five minutes ( did i mention it was night time?), so its really dark i really need to go and no latrine in sight. All i found was a fire place, made of rocks in a circle, so im pooping in this fireplace when all of a sudden flash lights come on everywhere and i see lights in the distance coming towards me, i stood up quickly and ran all the way back to the camp with my pants down. I&apos;ll never forget that day...New York 

 It was around August and I had just gotten a new job as a secretary, so I went to buy some proper clothes for the job. On my way to work, I realized I was almost out of gas, so I stopped at the local Shell station down the road from my house. Since this was Florida, the heat was quite bad during the summer months if you didn&apos;t have air conditioning. I pumped in $10.00 worth of gas, and went inside to pay. There was a bit of a line, so I waited. As I got closer to the counter, I could feel a breeze on my legs. When I finally got to the counter, I said, &quot;Hi, how are you today?&quot; The man behind the counter looked mortified, so I said, &quot;are you okay? You look like you&apos;ve seen a ghost.&quot; He replied, &quot;I guess I have. You&apos;re doing a Marilyn Monroe.&quot; I turned around in circles trying to figure out what he was talking about, as he watched me make a futher ass of myself. Behind me was a man standing by a Pepsi fridge and a fan. It was then that I realized not only was my dress being blown up from behind, by the fan, but also that today I&apos;d worn pantyhose without underpants underneith. The guy behind was signaling to the man at the counter about what he was seeing. How utterly embarassing. Anonymous 

 I was at my friends sleepover and we just got out of the pool. I was changing in her room, which faces the outside, and the window was open. As usual, I was oblivious, and just started changing. I walked out to the kitchen, and my friends like why didnt u shut the window? We just saw u changing! I was soooo embarrassed.. it was really awkward!!! 

 OMG! one time, I was at a play for a school field trip, and this really peverted guy was sitting behind me. I guess he liked me because all of a sudden, he started playing with my hair! on stage, everyone was at a sceen where they were yelling so i figured that i could tell him to stop without anyone hearing me so i turned around, and said, &quot;would you stop playing with my hair you pervert!&quot;. right as i did, the sceen stopped for the break in the middle of the play so everyone heard me and gasped! it was sooooo embarrasing because my teacher heard me at gave me detention for a month for insulting a student, and interupting the play. it was soooo unfair!~ amber 

 So one day after school, this really hot guy that I&apos;ve had a crush on came up to me and started talking to me. I haven&apos;t talked to him very much so I was way excited. He asked me if I would hang out with him that weekend. That Friday I hung out at his house with some of his friends. I had to take a dump REALLY bad but I was too embarassed to stink up the bathroom. Finally it got so bad that I farted while they were talking and it was coming out so I booked it and luckily found the bathroom. I ran in and later found out that they could hear everything while I was in there. It doesn&apos;t end here...come to find out, the toilet was broken and wouldn&apos;t flush. So my hot crush came to help me out and got this disgusting look on his face. I was soooo embarassed! He never asked me out again. -MCall 

 Well me and my best guy friend Ryan went through a tennis stage where we were always on the court. There&apos;s this big fence near the court and whenever we played a bunch of balls got hit over it and we always had to climb a fence to pick them up. Well this day we decided when we were done to both climb over... I let him go first and when I went to follow, my foot slipped off the fence and the pointed part at the top caught my bra and pulled it, along with my shirt, up over my head. So here I was trying to get uncaught for like 5 minutes, completely exposed (and i&apos;m definetely not flat). And this is a school tennis court too so there&apos;s a bunch of high school guys watching me. When i mentioned to ryan later why i stopped going to play tennis he said &quot;oh yeah. I was hoping you wouldn&apos;t bring that up...&quot; and I said &quot;how much did you see?&quot; and he said &quot;everything you wouldn&apos;t want me to....&quot; I was soooo mortified! 

 This one time, i was at mcdonalds, and me and my friend Ash were playing with the ketchup, because we got heaps of packets, and we were squirting them all over the table, then i went to the bathroom to wipe it off my hands, and when i walked out this guy i really liked saw me walk out of the bathroom, and he looked at my skirt and said &quot;You leaked...&quot; And i looked down and there was katchup on my skirt and he thought it was period, before i could explain he had walked off with his friend... I still haven&apos;t lived it down... -From Annie, Australia 

 One time I was at an internet cafe for my friends birthday party. We were all having so much fun playing around. Then my stomach started bubbling. I didn&apos;t think it was so serious until I had looked for 10 minutes and found no bathroom. After an hour I couldn&apos;t take it anymore so I crapped on myself. I was so embarressed becuase everyone was staring at me and it smelled bad throughout the place. So I started walking home and about half way there after all the staring and walking funny my friends mom popped up in her car and gave me a ride. I felt so bad for rewening the party and stinking up his car. I got grounded for a month from my mom. - Anonymous 

 One time when I was walking to my next class I saw this really hot new guy in the school so I decided to go up to him and asked if he needed any help the guy turned around and he turned out to be a teacher!!! the worsts patr is he was one of my main teachers. -Anonymous 

 It all started out on a wonderful vacation, I was with my dad, and my twin siter, and best friend. And we all decided to go to a movie, before we went into the movie we saw these really goodlooking guys out in the parking lot, and asked for my number. So i gave it to them, and entered the movie. During halfway of the movie i started to get really sick.. I knew i was going to hurl, but had no time to run away, so i puked in my hands... but it gets worse while i was running down the aile covered. i threw up right in the middle of the aile, looking up i see the guy who asked for my number he looked up at me and laughed and handed my number back... I was never more embarrassed in my life. 

 So I was in 7th grade nd i was in social studies. My teacher is ok, but she gives detetions for literally everything. i went to the bathroom, and i had to do #2, so it took a little longer than #1. I also had to wait, cuz both the stalls were taken. so i get back like 8-9 min. later, and my teacher yells in front of the class &quot;You&apos;re finally back!&quot; so that the whole class is staring at me nd my crush was rite next to the door, so she was really close. then she goes &quot;youre in big trouble, that better have been a #2 or youve got a detention&quot; so i have to go &quot;ummmm yea it was #2&quot; then she goes &quot;i cant hear you!&quot; so i basically have to yell &quot;Yes I went #2!&quot; every1 laughed at me like all day. 

 Right now is probably my most embarrassing moment because I&apos;m 49 years old and most stories here are from kids. Anyway, when I was in 10th grade it was at a very large city school. It was between classes. EVERYONE was in the hall going to their next class. I was menstruating and sanitary napkins didn&apos;t have &quot;wings&quot; or tape. We had to wear this extremely uncomfortable &quot;sanitary belt&quot;. I hated it so bad so I did not wear a belt. Ok, remember everyone is changing classes and I was in the main hall. Yup, my &quot;used napkin&quot; fell out of my undies and landed yucky side up!!! I freaked out soooooo bad and without thinking, I kicked the stupid thing and it goes sailing down the hall. Then I start running trying to catch up with it. Of course people were laughing and dodging and pointing......it landed in front of the girls restroom. I opened the door and kicked it inside. I stayed in the bathroom all day crying. And yes, I quit school that very day. No way could I return. (update: i eventually got my ged and went to college.) But it was definantly my most embarrassing moment. (Next to writting about it in here) Debi 

 I was singing the national anthem at a hockey spirit game, with about a thousand people, and in the middle of the song I forgot the words! Instead of singing &quot;for the ram parts we watched&quot; I sang, &quot;for the lamb...that we caught&quot; and I sang those words very clearly so everyone heard! What makes it worse is that when I was finished, I found out that my crush and his friends had come to the game to hear me sing! They were all laughing hysterically at my mistake. I was so embarrassed!!! 

 Ok I was sitting in Bewitched which by the way wasn&apos;t the best movie i&apos;ve ever seen and my friend was holding the popcorn and she went to the bathroom and the guy next to her had popcorn candy coke and pretzals all brand new and it was all on the ground next to my friends popcorn and i grabbed all of it thinking she had got it for me and ate it all before she came bac i was fsting b4 that so i was starveing but anyway when maggie came back she asked me y i didn&apos;t eat any popcorn and i thought she was kidding so i kept eatting finnally the most angrest guy ever came up to me and sad that i had stolen his stuff anf neglected to give it bac so i played cool and had my friend say she had just bought it for me he cooled down and said he was sry he made a mistake. but it dosnt end there the movies are in the mall so natrually we went to the mall after words i was talking to my friend about how dumb that guy had been 4 beleiving me when all of a sudden he walked up to us and said i was was in a lot of trouble he brought me to customer service and they laughed but he refused to leave until they called my parebts so they did and my parents told him he was a snobby jerk over the phone when i saw his face i ran sssoooo fast out of there its not even funny and i stioll see him in the mall like every day he glares at me even tho that was two years ago!!! - Paige 

 Once when I was in, like, 1st grade me and this other kid were having an insult contest at recess. Well, I won with poopyface but the other kid got so upset that he pulled down my pants and my underwear went halfway down with them! Everyone in kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade saw me! - NewtGirl 

 Ok. This is the most um embarrassing moment ever (but also somewhat rewarding). So skiing with my best friend and this guy that i had a HUGE crush on had come along. So I&apos;m skiing and I fall and I&apos;m sprawled all over the place and i walk up get my ski&apos;s and make a mental note to switch to snow boarding. So I&apos;m walking back up the lift and like 15 ft in the air I fall off! so then I&apos;m just really pissed so I&apos;m careful on this lift I walk up back to the lodge and my crush and best friend (not to mention everyone in the lodge) was like staring at me and my crush was drooling. I&apos;m like what?! and then my best friend says look down and my boob is totally overhanging my shirt! 2 weeks later me and my crush are making out but my best friend never lets me live it down. -damn it Kasha just let it go. Jess 

 This was really embarrasing for me. I was in 9th grade math class and there was this really HOT guy sitting behind me. I decided to be cute and pretend to drop my pen so I could bend over show off my butt and pick the pen up. Well it just so happened that as soon as I bend over my desk to pick the pen up I fart. Not just any fart but a loud, nasty, stinky fart. I tried to pretend it was the desk but everyone in the class knew the truth. I ended up being called FartKnocker the rest of the whole year. I had to change schools.-Anonymous- 

 I&apos;m a PHd student in electrical engineering. Last year I accepted a teaching position for introduction to computer science. The class is 400 people and it&apos;s in a large theater style lecture room. As I was teaching the back of the class is getting noisy, and then the noise got louder and louder. Just as when I was about to ask the people that are making the noise to get out. One of them got out of his seat from way in the back, wobble downed to the front, 
 took off his pants and mooned the whole class, shouting &quot;I&apos;m a sexy boy!, I&apos;m a sexy boy!&quot; and walked out. I frozed for about 10 minutes. The worse part is, after class, I saw that same bunch of guys viewing in on a handy cam. So somewhere on the net, there&apos;s a video of some dude mooning my class and me looking hillarious. 

 Ok so last year at school...i go to a very large scool about 3200 students .....the fire alarm went off because one of the science labs had an explosion......well as i was going down the stairs i tripped and like 20 people fell down the stairs as if that wasnt bad enough ....i was wearing like basketball shorts and when i landed at the bottom....my shorts and boxers came right off as i was tumbling down the stairs.. so there i was letting it all hang out...good part i got two dates and a girlfriend im still with....bad part i got detetion and a ticket for indecent exposure how messed up was that....----Josh 

 I had been at my friends house for like 2 days, it was spring break, and
 I had to take a shower, i mean i hadn&apos;t had a bath in days. 
 Well earlier that day we had all been sitting on stephanie&apos;s bed and i
 farted. everybody does it. anyways, so it left a stain on my panties,
 that was brown. duh well while i was in the shower, stephanie and
 heather(the other gurl that was over there) were in the bathroom while i
 was in the shower. when we had all had a bath and were about to go to
 sleep stephanie and heather burst out laughing. then they told me they
 had seen the big stain on my panties and i tryed to explain to them that
 it was where i had farted but they wouldn&apos;t let me live it down. that&apos;s
 not even the worst part. while i was over there i had brought my digital
 camera and stephanie had one too. well while i was in the shower heather
 and stephanie took pictures of my panties and took them to school and
 showed everyone even my brother and he still laughs at me. now i am known
 as dodo stain or dirt tracks. it&apos;s so embarrassing!!! 

 So i was in class and sitting next to this guy i really really liked. he sent me a note and told me he liked me. i wrote him back and told him i liked him to. well...the teacher saw me and took the letter. he read it to the whole class and then everyone started to laugh...i found out later that my crush meant for me to give it to my BEST friend.agggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!! 

 Was in 6th grade, it was the first choir concert of the year. The choir director Ms. Truax was new that year, this was her first big debut... and at the end of a very successful concert, during which I felt very queasy, we were all bowing the grand bow, and I threw up all over the director! The puke totally covered her and a few unsuspecting people around me. She was furious! And this was the first performance out of 3 that she had to direct. She spent the whole night smelling like puke. To this day she tells people about the girl that threw up on her, and I am famous in the Middle School. 

 One day me and my girlfriend were innertubing and we were going about 30mph but the water was really rough. Well we get some serious air and both go flying. Then when I hit the water my shorts flew off. I had to take off my life jacket and swim down after them my girlfriend was laughing like hell and still wont let it go. 

 Well last year on New Years I went to my friends house and we were jumping on the trampoline I was wearing really tight pants my fav. pants by the way and we were doing toe touches and well i did my toe touch and my pants ripped all the way from the front to the back i was so embressed cause one of my crushes were there and he saw everything ive never jumped on the trampoline with pants on again. 

 At mass the night before Easter,I was sitting in the pew with my mom and my older brother.The lights were out and it was so dark in the church you couldn&apos;t even see in front of you,all of a sudden I let out this loud fart (at least 3 times) and the church was so silent you can hear a pin drop and my brother started laughing at me at that moment so when the Lights finally went on, people knew it was me I WAS SO EMBARRASSED and my mom was angry that i didn&apos;t leave and go to the bathroom to fart,i&apos;ll never live that one down - anonymous 

 I am in the Navy and I work aboard ship. I had some personal business to take care of on base at a building that processes new personnel and their families into the new location. I was there to get a new ID card, so I asked the man at the counter to make one for me. This was my first time having to make a new one so I didn&apos;t know what I needed, and I was a little nervous. He told me that I need a special document from my ship in order to make the ID card. As I was talking to him, I didn&apos;t realize what was coming until it was too late. I felt a LOUD and BUBBLY fart slip out infront of the man I was talking to as well as the staff, and infront of the families waiting in line to be helped. My face turned beat red! I felt sorry for the little girl who was sitting just a few inches behind me. I walked out of there avoiding eye contact with everybody and pretended like it never happened. Luckily, my ship went underway the next day and I didn&apos;t have to go back for eight months! 

 one time me and my best friend cass were at fuddruckers and we went to the bathroom then we saw these really hot hot guys.they kept cheking us out so we tried to hurry in the bathroom so we could catch them before they left.then we started to talk to them right and they were laughing sooooooooo hard and my friend wispered to me and it turns out i had toliet paper hanging out of my pants i was mortified. 

 Me and my friend kristy got done dressing for field hockey practice....so we decided to go talk to some people in the gym for a few minutes. I thought it would be fun to slide across the gym floor in my socks. Not realizing that we got a new gym floor....i started running as fast as i could and when i went to slide i can do a dead stop. All you could hear was me hitting the floor then a sound that was like finger nails on the chalk board. Everyone had to have been in the gym when it happened. All the football players and my boyfriend...the volleyball players and the people cutting through the gym to get to the parking lot. When i finally got up my knees were torn up and somehow i got a hole in my shirt. how embarrassing. Everyone just laughed! 

 I once was at my school and I saw a basketball lying on the court so I thought I would hide it because you are supposed to rent it for 1$ and I would be able to get it free. But when I climbed in a tree to hide it there I got stuck and I nearly fell but I grabbed on and I hung there for nearly 2 hours before a janitor found me. It was in the school paper and I was
soooooooooooooooooooooooooo embarrassed. They still call me &apos;&apos;squirrel the tree climber. 

 Once i was at a friends house and we were bored so i sugested an arm wrestling contest. Soon the contest started introducing dares and i foolishly suggested that the loser should lick the other ones feet. I lost and had to lick my friends foot which smelt quite bad. He made me lick in-between his toes and everything. My friends never let me forget it -anonymous 

 When I was nine years old, I was sitting on my older brother&apos;s water bed watching&quot;The X-Files.&quot;My big bro had a lot of spare pennies laying around and I knew better than to put them in my mouth and play with them, but I was mad bored so I did it anyway. So, I had this penny in my mouth and I must have wiggled a little or something because the water bed started moving. Of course, the movement made me choke on the penny. I ran out of my brother&apos;s room into the living room coughing with my hands around my throat. My mom instantly screamed,&quot;Oh my God!&quot;and came running towards me. Before she could get to me, I gave one mighty cough and I somehow mananged to swallow the penny! So, once I could speak, I let my mom know that I had choked on a penny and that now my chest hurt really, really bad. So, she called up my older brother (he had the car at the time) and had him pick us up so I could be taken to the hospital. It turned out that the penny had lodged itself in my esopha gus. So, after waiting a night to see if the penny would move at all (it didn&apos;t), I had to get surgery to take the penny out. They put me to sleep, stuck a tube down my throat, and used these long tweezers with a camera on the end to pull it out. Ever since I got out of surgery, my family and friends have enjoyed calling me&quot;The Human Piggy Bank&quot;and to this day I cannot be around any pennies without someone asking,&quot;Are you hungry or something, Hilary?&quot;It was quite an embarrassing ordeal, but I still have the penny in a jar and pictures taken of my esophagus as they were pulling it out! Interesting souveniors... - Hilary 

 One time, while on a field trip tp the Louisville Zoo, i was bending over to try and get the coins out of a&quot;wishing well&quot;that ducks swam in, when i suddenly slipped and fell in the duck pond. The teacher i went on that field trip with hated me anyway, and doing that didn &apos;t help. 

 I was at the mall with my husband , I was ordering a soda at a fast food restaurant thinking he was beside me I got the urge to grab his butt.. Me being in a rather cheeky mood, I did...
Just a few minutes before my husband had said&quot;Honey, I will be right back&quot;. and walked away. I did not here this... So, I grabbed the guy standing next to me only it wasn&apos;t his butt it was his groin... He got a great kick outta it and said&quot;He needed to come to the mall more often&quot;. and as did his friends they asked if I was single. The guy taking the order l was laughing so hard he was crying. My husband thought it was the best thing that had happened all yr. I was mortified.... - Marcie 

 Ok, we were at camp together and some of the boys decided to play a trick on us overnight. When we got up in the morning (we go to sing the anthem every morning) So we got up to sing and our underwear and bras were hanging from the flag pole!! It doesn&apos;t end there. When we finally got them back, kids were making fun of us for wearing pink and purple underwear, one was my old undies that still fit that had barnie on them... Sooo embarassing! It happened infront of our crush&apos;s and to this day people still call us the panty princesses...

 Last year I was at a really cool disco and decided to show off in front of my friends, I stumbled backwards, fell through the bathroom door and to make matters worse i landed head first into the toilet. It was so emmbarrasing, while i was doing this the door was wide open and every one at the disco cracked up laughing. It was so so embarrasing. Amber. 

 So me and my little brother where ice skating on our pond. My crush came along. we decided to play ice hockey with brooms. I wanted to look cool for my crush so i skated onto the thin ice. he said&quot;Wait!&quot;and followed me. then i stopped for a second and the ice broke! oh my god! i grabbed onto my crushes pants so i wouldn&apos;t fall through and i pulled them down. i ended up falling through with his pants and boxers. he ran away and my little brother just watched it all. my crushes parents heard me yelling and came and found me holding a pair of pants and boxers in the water. my crushes mom said&quot;aren&apos;t those our sons pants?&quot;i was soooo embarassed! and i almost drowned. 

 When I was around 9 I went on my first date with a boy named Alan. i really wanted to look cute so I wore a frilly pink skirt and a white t-shirt. The pink skirt was almost see throug too. his mom was driving us and she had soft seats in her lincoln continental. all of a sudden i had to go to the bathroom so i tried to hold it but i couldnt. like 10 minutes later i didnt have to go anymore so i looked on the seat and there was poop all over it! i had no idea i had pooped myself!!! thats not even the end either! it was time to leave to the movie he was taking me so i got out of the car and i thought i could cover the mess i had made up with my sweatshirt. i covered it up and we went inside and saw the movie. when we came back out he lifted up my sweat shirt because i said i was a little cold. he saw the poop all over the place and i was mortified and he even started to cry!!! 

 I work for a very small company (myself and one other person) and we use office space owned by another business. My desk is right by the front door to their office. So one day I was in the office alone, my coworker had the day off, and I“let one go”. This fart was the definition of a S.B.D. (silent but deadly). So in order to cover the odor before it reached the unsuspecting employees, I light a match. Within a couple of minutes I hear the office manager asking if anyone else smells smoke. I hear him walking around the room, checking wires and waste baskets, frantically looking for the“fire”. Then he and one of his employees start to head toward my desk. And out of sheer embarrassment, I begin laughing hysterically and uncontrollably. They look as me and ask if I am ok. I reply giggling“I may have lit a match”. A puzzled look comes across both of their faces and fades within seconds as these two guys realize how I have tried to cover my tracks. To this day, if they hear any sound that sounds remotely like a body function I am the primary suspect. 

 So yeah when I was 6 I was going to be the flower girl in my aunts wedding I was sooo excited!... then while I was walking down the isle all of my flowers got stuck to the bottom, not 2 bad right…wrong! I turned the basket over and started banging on the bottom next thing I know all of the flowers were on the ground! I was so embarrassed that I ran out the door that the bride was going to come in! My shoe was unexpectedly caught on her dress but she didn’t know and I didn’t want to ruin her day so I just pranced in behind her on 1 foot…then I fell into her ! We both went tumbling down the isle and guess what there more is! I had been crying so much that while I rolled over her snot went piling on her face!!!!!!! That was officially the worst day of my life! 

 I was sitting in language class and the teacher is reading a boring story and all of a sudden i fall asleep. When the teacher finally realized i was asleep she woke me up and i farted really loud. Then all the class ran out because it smelled so bad. It was so embarrising but in the end every one laughed. -keegan 

 One time i was at the mall and i was in the footlocker looking at the jordans when i walked out i saw the most beutiful girl in bedicheck middle school then all of a sudden my friend jumps behind me and scares the crud out of me causing me to spill my drink all over her new 300 dollar dress. 

 I was at the library with 2 of my friend. We were joking arund and started to read achildren&apos;s book. my bigest crush walked in and heard me reding the book outloud! I tryed to put it bak beforehe noticed but before i could he asked me,&quot;Aren&apos;t you a little old to be reading that?&quot;I was so embarassed! He told the whole school and i was the laughing stalk for the entire Month! 

 On my first day of my senior year, I walked into this class, sat down, realized that everyone else was a junior and was looking at me really strangely. I didn&apos;t really think too much of it, until I realized that the teacher who was in the room was definitely not my teacher. So I got up in front of the entire class and left. This wouldn&apos;t have been so bad except that I was a freshman mentor and so I had to wear a bright orange T-shirt to let everyone know that I could help them. Later I found out that the class was US History and everyone was giving me weird looks because you have to fail it to take it as a senior. Oops! 

 So I was in 7th grade, just moved to another new school. I was in PE and we were doing those physical fitness tests. The day that i came was the sit-up day. My school was pretty decent sized too, but yea, it was crazy. So my PE teacher was sittin next to me and makin&apos; sure i was doin&apos; em&apos; right and then this one chick was holdin my feet down. i was on like.. my 23rd one after like.. 30 seconds, and i farted, and it echoed throughout the whole gym. All of the people playin basketball like.. went 100% silent and stared at me, then everybody tripped out laughing. That had to have been practically the most embarassing day of my life. 

 I&apos;m 21 years old, but at the time I was only 14. I got into a bad habit of always having my mom buy me pads or tampons when I needed them. So when one day she didn’t want to I had to suck it up and go myself. She drove me to a near by circle K (a gas station) I got down and went straight to the isle where I knew they were at. I grab a package of pads and hurry to make the line of the female cashier. When I get to the counter the female walks off to the back leaving me to go to the next cashier who was a male. Being embarrassed I walked away and acted like I need something else. I was way to embarrassed to go to the male. So I walked around the small gas station just looking around like I needed something else, waiting for the female to return. Five minutes passed by and she still hadn&apos;t returned so I decided to act grown and just go to the male cashier. As I was about to walk up to the counter a couple of guys I knew from school walked in. Turning bright red I turned around quickly and put the pads on a shelf near by and greeted them as if I was in there for another reason. I thought they would only be in there for a couple of minutes so I again acted like I was looking for something in each isle. By this time about 15 minutes have passed and my mom is watching me through the big glass window laughing so hard. She knew how embarrassed I was by this point. The guys left and I went to the male cashier and tried to hurry. I was walking out very upset with my mom and as I was just about to get into the car, a car of guys pulled up next to us. Everyone knows plastic bags are see through so I was swinging my arms a little extra to make sure they couldn’t see what was in the bag. All of a sudden I saw something go flying up in the air. That’s when I realized I didn’t have a grip on both handles of the bag and my pads went flying making them visible for everyone to see. The worst part was they landed underneath the guys car and picked them up and handed them to me. I was so humiliated and told my mom I was never buying them again…….. 

 This happened at work. I went to the mens room to take a dump. I went to the stall&amp;sat down. Someone came in&amp;was in the stall next to me. When I was finished I half way stood up while tearing off some toilet tissue to wipe my ass. Well when I was done wiping I dropped the toilet paper&amp;it landed on the floor in the next stall where the other person was. I was mortified. I did not want to leave the stall until that guy was gone. I didn&apos;t want him to see me. Of course he could have hung around outside the door to see who came out. Anyway, I was so embarrassed. 

 I was at Sams Club with my friends and her family, they were going to be shopping for a while so they bought us Red Cherry Icees - Yum! We were following them around drinking our Icees and her dad was picking out some shirts. I had a big mouthful of Icee and I had to sneeze... I tried to hold it in but before I could look away I got red Icee ALL OVER THE SHIRTS HE WAS GOING TO BUY. Not only that it was all over my face and shirt so my friend was laughing and we started to go to the bathroom to clean off and she was imitating my sneeze while a guy was walking out. She was like&quot;AAAACHOOOO!!&quot;And it looked really fake n he took one look at us and was like&quot;Umm... bless you?&quot;. That was about 5 years ago now and we&apos;re still best friends and her familiy still teases me about it!! SO EMBARRASSING!!! 

 I have a habit of sleeping in just a tee-shirt and underwear during the hot summer. I had just gotten home from work, and I was exhausted so I decided to try and get to sleep. I kept on hearing my brother being loud from his room across the hall, so I decided to go and tell him to keep it down. So, I burst into his room without pants only to realize that there was about 3 other boys in there, all playing video games. So I just stood there, in my underwear mildly stunned until one of my brother&apos;s friends said&quot;um.... hi.&quot;I quickly turned away and went back into my room. From now on, I make sure to check before i go romping about in the house without pants on! 

 I was at an overnight camp and we were getting ready for a dance. Everyone had really nice outfits but I didn&apos;t. After searching through my suitcase, I finally found a really nice skirt so I slipped it on and we were out to the dance hall. I was dancing and I noticed a couple guys staring at me so I started shaking my butt thinking they were interested in me...I later found out the skirt had a rip from the top to the bottom...and top it off with, I was wearing underwear which I shitted in a few days ago...It was disguisting. 

 When I was in high school my church youth group went on a trip to Sea World in Ohio. We stayed for 3 days and the whole time there I hadn&apos;t eaten anything so on the way back we stopped at Wendys and everyone nagged at me to get something small so I decided to get a frosty. Half threw it, we were ready to leave so I threw away me frosty and hopped on the bus. Half way home I felt bubbles forming in my stomach.I opened a window only it did not help so trying to be polite I asked my youth pastor ( whom was driving) if he could pull over so I could peeee. Only he told me to hold it until we got to the next rest stop or exit. I waited but my stomch keep hurting only the oain was moving downward the second try i was like Due I have to puke can you pull over....and he siad we&apos;re almost to an exit can you wait and i said yeah i&apos;ll trying ...finally I said i can&apos;t ...i can&apos;t wait you have to pull over . So we all pulled over and I felt calm I was said go ahead I&apos;ll be okay...I fell better so we oull back on to the road ,passing an exit and suddenly the pain came back and it was&apos;t going away so oce again I asked topull iover and he was like we just passed an exit and you said u were okay ...your gonna have towait this time ...so yelled out I have to poop and if you don&apos;t pull I will loose it here in my seat. The bus went silent everyone in shock and then a rush of laughter came over the entire bus. My youth pastor pulled over and I jumped out with a few friends and we went into the woods on the side of the road. After being out ther ewe releize that there wasn&apos;t anything around to use as tp so one of the girls went back to the bus and returned with a maxi-pad SUPER EXSORBANT. Once we go tback to the bus everyone was still laughing because shy me having to poop. The most embarrsing part was that after that the church had bought a SCOTTY POTTY ON THE GO with lots of toliet paper. And when anyone asks why do we have that for the trips ....everyone looks at me.laughs and says Danielle would you like to answer that. That story is told still today 8 years later!!!! 

 I got drunk at a party and there was them stupid window sliding doors...i was heading outside and they were open...but because i was so out my face i closed the door n walked threw them...wel tryed to! and of course it had to be in front of 4 of my ex&apos;s, the boy i like just now, and all my other friends!! how dumb of me! 

 We were having a BBQ and my aunt didn&apos;t know how to start the gas grill. She turned on the gas but never hit the fire button so it stayed inside the grill, when she finally found the button, I was standing next to the grill
and...WHOOF I lost all of my hair on my right side. I still haven&apos;t lived it down. Brent 

 I was at a friends house .. and he left a minute and told us to wait in his bedroom.. so we went in and sat on the bed my.. stomach started cramping all of a sudden and i thought .. i had to fart, and i let it go thinking that was all it was ... i shit all over myself and the bed... i was so embarrassed... it was all over.. thought you might want to hear that ..lol 

 During my sophomore year in college was running late for an exam. So I was running thru the quad, on pebbled concrete, wearing leather soled shoes. I was carrying a term paper as ran past a large group of hot sorority girls. As I planted my foot and turned toward the liberal arts building I slid on the concrete, my legs went over my head, all of my papers flew in every direction. I landed on my back, which pushed out the loudest FART out of my ass. All of the girls were dying laughing as I had to pickup my term paper. -Patrick 

 Once I was in like 1 grade and I had to go to da bathroom and their were bathrooms in every class so I didn&apos;t close the door and I was young so I pulled my pants down all the way, and everyone saw my butt, and I liked this girl and looked back and started screaming and they all laughed. I was so embarrassed. -anonymous. 

 So I was at the tennis match, waiting for a court to open up so i could play when I saw the strangest thing. It looked like there was rain coming out of a bend in the branch of a tree. So all of this water is going everywhere, and I point it out to some of my friends. I cant figure out what it is, so I walk over to it and put my hand under it. That&apos;s when one of my friends pointed out the squirell peeing all over the place. Ugh. 

 My most embarassing moment was when my parents were out at a movie and my boyfriend came over, we were kissing and our braces got stuck together. were trying to get them apart, and my parents walk in on us!!!!!!!!!!!!! man that was embarassing! - kaylee
