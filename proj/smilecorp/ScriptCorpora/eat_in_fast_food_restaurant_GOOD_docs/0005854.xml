 SONIC carhops train at Roller World Saugus— 
Roller World transformed into America’s Drive-In for one afternoon as SONIC employees perfected the roller skating skills needed to deliver the restaurant’s famed cherry limeades and corn dogs to customers.

Talented skaters–sporting SONIC’s trademark blue-and-red uniforms - streaked across the Roller World rink on March 31 carrying weighted trays meant to simulate a typical order at the fast food restaurant.

Director of Restaurant Operations Robert Webb arranged for the training session in advance of the April 9 opening of the Wilmington SONIC.

More than 900 people applied for jobs with the Wilmington SONIC, most of whom expressed an interest in becoming a carhop.

“It’s our most coveted position, it’s tip-based and people like to be able to skate outside while they work,”Webb explained.

After two rounds of interviews SONIC narrowed the list down to 50 potential carhops. All of the hopefuls indicated they knew how to roller skate and management put those claims to the test at Roller World.

Supervisors handed each employee a tray filled with 44-ounce cups and instructed them to whisk the items to a“customer”at the other end of the roller skating rink.

Typically SONIC gives the carhops drinks and tater tots for outdoors drills, but the restaurant settled on weighted replicas without any real liquid inside to prevent any damage to the wood floor.

Over two hours carhops practiced stopping on a line and maneuvering around tight corners. Most wore rollerblades, but old-fashioned roller skates and inline skates also made an appearance.

To add some difficulty managers barked commands such as“hey I need ketchup”or“my burger’s cold”to gauge the employees’abilities.

Some individuals handled the task more deftly than others, with a few looking unsteady on their feet as they skidded to a stop. Overall Webb was pleased with the performances and said the employees demonstrated what SONIC wanted to see.

In addition to skating aptitude, Webb said SONIC seeks out affable carhops who enjoy interacting with customers.

At SONIC, customers park in their very own drive-in stall and push a red button on the menu board to place orders from their car.

Carhops deliver orders to customers who are in their cars or sitting on the patio, and SONIC even has its very own radio network customers can enjoy at the drive-in.

“No other restaurant around here does what we do,”Webb said.“We want to bring back that early 1950s, drive-in movie theater time when everyone ate together in the car.”

“No other restaurant around here does what we do,”Webb said.“We want to bring back that early 1950s, drive-in movie theater time when everyone ate together in the car.”

One of the carhops, Alexa Mattes of Wilmington, told the Advertiser she visited a SONIC in Montana a few years back and enjoyed the experience.

“I love that 1950s vibe at SONIC,”Mattes said.

Fellow carhop Alyssa Guida said she was happy with how well she did skating with a tray.

“I didn’t fall, which is the most important thing,”Guida chuckled.

Wilmington resident Jess DeNorscia said she has visited SONIC franchises in the south and loves the friendly atmosphere at the restaurant. She has also been skating since she was 4 years old.

So when DeNorscia learned SONIC intended to open in her hometown it seemed like a natural fit.

“I needed a job and I thought it would be fun,”DeNorscia said.

Not all of the carhops boasted as much experience as DeNorscia. Tricia Carlino of Wilmington confessed that she only learned how to roller skate earlier in the day.

“I practiced at Dick’s Sporting Goods, I think I did pretty well,”Carlino remarked.

The carhops’training will be put to good use on April 9 when the 26-stall Wilmington SONIC opens for business.

Webb said the company hopes to build off the success of the Peabody SONIC that generated substantial buzz when it opened last August.

Wilmington marks SONIC’s second foray into eastern Massachusetts and Webb said plans are in the works for 15 restaurants to eventually flood the market.
