WEAC president reacts to governor’s attack on worker rights bill

Posted: 2/11/2011 3:12:07 PM




WEAC President Mary Bell held a press conference at 4 p.m. Friday, February 11, at the WEAC offices to react to the governor’s Attack on Worker Rights bill.

 

 

 WEAC President: Governor’s plan attacks teachers, bad for education 

MADISON – The president of Wisconsin’s largest union of educators today said the governor’s plan to dismantle state employee unions was extreme and an attack on dedicated educators across the state. The following statement may be attributed to Mary Bell, a teacher from Wisconsin Rapids and president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council.

“Today, Governor Walker took aim at my values. He also attacked the educators our union represents by taking hard-earned benefits away from them and limiting their rights to a voice in their profession.

“The people of Wisconsin did not elect Governor Walker to undermine public education – but that is exactly what his extreme attack on worker rights’ proposal will do. He’s about to hurt really good people, their kids and families.



“His attacks on educators and the union that supports them will directly harm the quality of our schools and the education our children receive. Taking away the union’s role in support of teachers will mean teachers no longer have a voice in issues like class sizes, curriculum and other school quality issues. This proposal has a negative impact on every child and on every parent.



“Governor Walker is taking aim at the teachers union but he is in fact making a direct hit on our children and our schools. It is incredible that one of Scott Walker’s first acts as governor is to abandon Wisconsin’s long tradition of teamwork, or give-and-take for the good of our schools and children. The governor’s plan is bad for education.”

 To Dennis,

I just let my husband, who is in business, read your degrading post about welcoming teachers to the real world. His response: &quot;Yea, he&apos;s an idiot. He obviously knows no teachers.&quot; My husband has often said, unless you are a teacher, or are married to one, you have no idea the amount of time (unpaid time I might add) that teachers put in.

I easily put in 70 hours/per week during the school year and continue to take classes (all paid for out of pocket) and plan during the summer. No one goes into teaching for the money. We go into it because of our commitment to children and our hope for the future. It is often a thankless, stressful job, with few perks, and little time for even a bathroom break.

You sir, are welcome to come into my classroom any time, and I will sit at my desk, and watch you for one day. Oh, you will need to have lesson plans completely ready for that day, all before the day starts. Remember to plan for lots of hands on work and small group work, so individual lessons for about 5 small groups in reading and writing. Good teachers diferentiate, you know. Math and Science are both hands on, too, and take about 1/2 to an hour to prep, so you might want to come in the night before, as there will be little time in the morning. With few breaks, you will have to respond to emails to parents in a timely manner, so prepare for that. And you will have perhaps one 1/2 to prep for the rest of the day, recess duty, and about 20 minutes to choke down your lunch. If it is a day that I have planned lunch with my students for small group work, or social skill time, you will not get your lunch break either. You might have bus duty at the end of the day as well. Go to the bathroom before you come to work. You can go again at 4:00 or so. If you did this, and really saw what teachers do in a day, perhaps your degrading, disrespectful viewpoint will change.

 Governor Walker says that the teachers have nothing to bargain with, but we have many options other than paying more into our pensions, and health care, and especially taking away our bargaining rights.  For example, being a young teacher who doesn&apos;t make much to begin with would rather have a pay freeze for two years than take a $7000 pay cut in 6 weeks. 
 J.J. 2/13/2011
 When it comes to Walker&apos;s plan to essentially break up state/public employee unions, I&apos;ve always been under the assumption that federal law protects laborers&apos; rights to form unions, collectively bargain, demonstrate, and even go on strike. Doesn&apos;t federal law also protect unions formed by state employees, prison guards, and teachers?? Can&apos;t a state government&apos;s efforts to control unions be challenged in federal court?? My question to WEAC is this: DO YOU HAVE A PLAN OF ACTION IN PLACE TO CHALLENGE WALKER&apos;S UNION-BUSTING VIA LITIGATION?  I just don&apos;t see how one elected official can unilaterally decide to strip labor unions of their bargaining ability in a democratic nation in which the right to organize is protected.

Some of the other commentators below contend that the breaking of the teacher&apos;s unions won&apos;t result in a mass exodus of educators from the profession.  I am a young teacher who is much closer to the beginning of her career than the end, and I also teach in one of the toughest urban environments in Wisconsin.  Frankly, I would NOT have joined this profession had I known how my government and my fellow citizens would treat me, or how little respect I would be given by parents, district administrators, school boards, and the media!  It&apos;s time to GET REAL: Walker&apos;s plans to strip teachers of competitive pay, benefits, and their licenses in the event their students fail to make improvements on standardized tests WILL result in hard-working teachers leaving their classrooms to look for more respected work in the private sector...and will also deter our fresh, young college students from joining the profession in the first place.  There is only so much decent, well-intentioned professionals can take--and we teachers have been taking it for too long!

 To Dennis:

Let me just remind you that you are working in the private sector per your own personal choice, and making a lot more money than those of us in the teaching profession.This amounts to more money available to you to help pay for your insurance. And, as I believe Anne said, we do pay for a portion of our health insurance and pay deductibles and copays just like you do.

As a teacher who is fighting to keep a job to help support my family, I say shame on you. Where would you be today had you not had teachers? Quality educators often spend summers taking classes to keep their licenses up to date and developing quality lessons to keep up with the differing and demanding needs of today&apos;s children, where stability in the classroom might be the ONLY sense of normal they have. Do you have a license you need to keep current every so many years, and IF so, do you get reimbursement for such credits? There are many expenses that go into providing a positive classroom experience that many of you in the private sector are unaware of, and the vast majority of that money is coming out of our pockets.

If you have children, you should really consider your position. I cannot understand why the middle class continues to be attacked. Is there any burden put on the wealthy who do not have to put their own money back into their office to run successfully? Is there any burden put on the government to put people to work instead of paying unemployment and welfare to those who cannot find a job? Throwing away the value of education is NOT going to bring new businesses to this state. In fact, when you take 20% of income out of the pockets of well over 100,000 workers, less and less money is going to be spent in any business. There will be a direct effect on all of the private sector.

How about if the entire state proposes that the Governor work in good faith with the entire state...not just one sector of the population? 
 Mark 2/12/2011
 Dennis, you say that we, teachers, should pay the same benefits as the private sector.  Ok, then we better get paid like private sector employees.  Of course you do not see a mass exodus of teachers from Wisconsin because of this bill.  You&apos;re not an educator and you would not understand anything about teaching unless you stepped into a classroom.  I bet you wouldn&apos;t last a day in the life of a public school teacher. 
 Dennis 2/12/2011
 Anne

If that is how it is financially then you have an easy choice to make.

Find a job in the private sector, pay what we pay for our pensions and our health benefits, and see how good you had it.

Look at the amount that teachers in the Green Bay and Ashwaubenon area pay towards their health care and pensions.

WEAC went out of its way to insult and demonize Scott Walker during he recent election. You reap what you sew.

I do not envision a mass exodus of the teachers nor the state employees....they will just have to pay more and in line with the private sector.

And those $170K union leaders you have will have to find a job now too.

 
 Anne 2/12/2011
 Dennis, 
Actually, as a teacher, I work all year long, even though I am with students only 180 days. In the summer, I spend countless hours on curriculum work and professional development in order to improve as an educator. During the school year, I easily put in 70 hours a week (including weekends) grading, lesson planning, attending meetings, revising curriculum, contacting parents, working with kids before/after school, etc. I am also only paid for 188 days. Many people perceive that educators continue to earn a paycheck over the summer. That is completely false. I do receive a check, but it is because I&apos;ve decided to have my pay divided into 24 paychecks in order to make it easier to budget my money. 

In addition, I would also like to add that I do contribute a percentage of my paycheck to my health care and pension. I do not know of any teachers who have 100% health care coverage. It used to be that way 10-15 years ago, but that is a thing of the past.

Quality education requires quality teachers. Cutting my benefits and salary even more will force me and many other educators to strongly consider other professions. As it is, my spouse is a manager of a fast-food restaurant and earns more money than I do. He has a high-school diploma, and I have a master&apos;s degree. Financially-speaking, I&apos;d be better off in a different profession, but I chose to become a teacher because I am passionate about educating children and making a difference. However, if I can&apos;t make ends meet, then I cannot stay in this profession.

 To those who want to cut debt by sacrificing our children’s education/future, 

 As quoted on Representative Kevin Peterson’s website, “ We can no longer afford delay tactics which simply pushes the state&apos;s financial problem onto our children”.  If our children’s future is our biggest concern, why then would we propose drastic negative changes to the lively hood of the people whose job it is to educate these children? Why would we want to make the teaching profession less appealing to potential educators who have the skills and want to guide and positively impact these impressionable minds?  Isn’t education one of the most important building blocks for our children’s future? 

 In the efforts to “fix our state financial crisis” they are about to drive education into a worse financial state than it already is.  Teachers certainly aren’t rolling in extra cash and most of us went into the profession knowing that we won’t become millionaires, but that we would have retirement and good health care.  Now they are threatening to take that away. Without these appealing benefits, younger, talented people will not be attracted to careers in education. This profession will not attract the most worthy individuals. State scores will drop in the future because we will not have quality educators and they will seek other employment with higher pay opportunities. 

 On television, we watch commercials for higher education facilities advertising their “smaller class sizes” because of its positive effect on student learning.  This is in direct contrast to the proposal to increase class size.  Everyone knows that small class sizes are beneficial for higher achievement, especially in those communities with students who have higher needs due to poverty and crime.  Countless studies have demonstrated this.  Children who come from poverty will continue the cycle of poverty, ignorance and crime without having access to a good education and opportunities for these kids to break the cycle of what they’ve grown accustomed to. Help me understand why it is important to exempt law enforcement because of their “direct effect on protecting our communities”; if we are taking away the building blocks for our future (education) it is important to pay law enforcement even more as they will be dealing with much more crime as it increases due to ineffective teachers/lack of government educational support.  One would think a proactive stance would be more money friendly than a reactive stance.  Ignorance breeds ignorance.  School allows these kids to form relationships with positive role models they would never have come into contact without school. School allows Interests and skills to develop that they would not have learned elsewhere.  With larger class sizes children will have less of an opportunity to form individual meaningful relationships with their teachers.  Without the relationship, the foundation for meaningful learning is not as profound.  Think of any relationship in life, those who have the time to develop a meaningful relationship with us are the ones who we seek out, they are the businesses we patronize.  They are the people we depend on, look to for answers, the people we trust and the people we aspire to be like. When we feel like a number, we look elsewhere or become disinterested. 

 Keep class sizes smaller.  Keep teaching an appealing profession for young people.  Let’s not pull the rug out from our children’s future.  If they don’t think teachers are important to our children’s future, who is?   Tell them to wake up.  It’s only our future.

 Tuesday, I was appalled by WEAC&apos;s use of my union dues to interfere in the longstanding difficulties of  MPS.  While I firmly believe that MPS needs a major overhaul, I do NOT believe it is the role of WEAC to lead the charge.  What next?  Come into another district and tell them they need to merge because they&apos;re too small? This move set a disturbing precedent that I am not willing to support with my union dollars.

Now on Friday, WEAC suddenly remembers why it exists.  It should have been astutely focused on this new governor, his plans for the new QEO,  and his budget repair bill that amounts to the destruction of our hard-earned benefits.   I make no apology for my salary or benefits.  You want quality teachers in this state? You will get exactly what you pay for.  After 36 years serving the children of this state with dedication, I am appalled by both my union and my governor.  Shame on both of you. 
 Dennis 2/12/2011
 The free ride is over teachers.

Now you get to pay for your health care and your pensions just like people in the real working world.

How does it feel?

And still under the Walker bill you will not even come CLOSE to what people in the private sector have to pay for their health and pension plans.

And remember..you folks work 180 days a year compared to the rest of us who work at least 250 days a year, you do not work weekends, shift work, holidays.

Welcome to the real world.



 
 James 2/11/2011
 Well WEAC, you abandoned the teachers of Milwaukee and denied the MTEA a voice in your &quot;Bold Plan&quot;. Ironic that now you are at odds with Governor Walker. What did you really expect? For him to play nice? Walker&apos;s goal is to bust the unions, and by throwing the MTEA under the bus you now have to reap what you sow.  Unity means unity, not political backstabbing. Thanks for nothing. 
 Jeff S 2/11/2011
 I agree we need to get together in MADISON ASAP.  Gov. Walker is going to fix the states issues at our expense.  He stopped short of destroying everyone some groups are exempt-police, fire, state patrol, etc.  Figured he would retain some voters for the next election.  Not to mention he doesn&apos;t want his home robbed, burned down, or if someone passes his motorcade at high speeds he wants them pulled over-got to keep things safe!  What he doesn&apos;t seem to understand is that education IS THE MOST IMPORTANT component in the success equation.  It impacts everything!  I do not want him fixing state issues at our expense.....PERIOD!  He will fix things for sure he&apos;s like Sherman during the Civil War &quot;slash and burn&quot;.  By the time the dust settles he will be in Washington taking the credit for personal accomplishments but failing to acknowledge the lives destroyed along the way. 
 Pat 2/11/2011
 There needs to be a rally scheduled very soon at the Capitol of all state union workers, including those in WEA. I will be there, and I urge all WEA members to be there also. 
 Chris 2/11/2011
 What is WEAC doing to get members to rally at the Capitol and show Gov. Walker and the legislators that we won&apos;t stand for this attack on public employees.  We all need to stand together and WEAC has the resources to organize and rally people, but the time is NOW. Emailing our assembly and and senate representatives is fine, but wouldn&apos;t a show of 10,000 people standing on the steps of the Capital really show Gov. Walker that we won&apos;t stand for this.  The locals don&apos;t have the connections to make this happen but WEAC does.  ACT NOW! 
 TE 2/11/2011
 ED,
Under the governor&apos;s &quot;fix-it&quot; plan, we&apos;ll all lose way more than $1000 a year!
JUST SAY NO TO WALKER! 
 Kris 2/11/2011
 Thanks for taking a stand so quickly, it send a message to Gov Walker. 
 Quinn 2/11/2011
 Perhaps Mrs. Bell should of held off on her willingness to work with Gov. Walker by suggesting a change to the evaluation system (which should be left to individual districts and not standardized), merit pay system (studies have shown that this does not improve student achievement), and the breakup of MPS.  See what you get?  The second Walker felt that WEAC was one the fence was the second he went for the jugular.  Thanks WEAC great job!-glad to see my dues are being put to good use. 
 ED 2/11/2011
 Let&apos;s finally eliminate the almost $1000 in dues WEAC takes out of our pocket every year. 
 Melissa 2/11/2011
 Just tell us what we need to do. I think we are ready to do it!
