Read the new law here: Healthcare legislation has pros and cons to medical community
 Wednesday, March 24, 2010 
 By Nick Schneider , Assistant Editor The U.S. Congress has passed a sweeping $938 billion package of health care reforms and President Barack Obama signed the legislation into law Tuesday morning.
The historic bill was sealed late Sunday, when the House voted 219-212 -- without a single Republican in favor -- to send the 10-year bill to the president.
However, some in the local medical field are questioning the short-term and long-term effects of the action.
Greene County General Hospital Administrator Jonas Uland says the legislative process was questionable.
&quot;I didn&apos;t like how the whole process developed,&quot; Uland said. &quot;I didn&apos;t like the secret deals and I didn&apos;t like the hurry up. I didn&apos;t like a lot of that.
&quot;I think we need to be aware that these underlying deals that are being made give me the proof it&apos;s not the best product we are trying to vote on. We are trying to vote on secret deals and we don&apos;t even know what some of them are. If it was that good of legislative act, you wouldn&apos;t have to have those.&quot;
Uland says he does agree the national care system needs some reform, but he would prefer to make the changes at a slower pace.
&quot;I do think the health care system could have some tweaking. I am more of a person who needs to see it gradually done and not a big swoop when you are talking about the dollars and you&apos;re talking about the system itself.&quot;
Uland can see problems developing at his hospital in Linton.
&quot;I see we don&apos;t have the infrastructure set up. The infrastructure being positions. We don&apos;t have enough physicians for access so if you are going to add another 30 million people into a system that is already taxed, you can&apos;t use the terms &apos;nobody will suffer, you can keep your own doctor and you&apos;ll have the same quality service&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;The ER is going to be overburdened. I mean people are just going to be coming in. It already is, but when you start adding more people into a system that doesn&apos;t have enough physicians that&apos;s going to happen.&quot;
Uland continued, &quot;As an administrator of a hospital I guess I have a problem when they say how are you going to pay for this and they say the majority is going to be paid &apos;within the system&apos;. Within the system to me means you are going to cut doctors and cut hospitals and when you do that locally here there is the potential that you are going to have layoffs and decisions that will have to be made. I don&apos;t necessarily think that&apos;s going to be the case if we can address the issue and be a little more aware of what the impact is. But when you&apos;re using the words &apos;within the system&apos; we are going to save money that to me is only meaning you are going to cut what goes out into the hospitals and sooner or later the doctors are going to drop out of the system and hospital are going to have to peel back in order to survive.&quot;
Uland said he&apos;s disappointed there wasn&apos;t more emphasis on tort reform to eliminate nuisance lawsuits, but feels competition outside of state lines for insurance is a good idea.
&quot;I think there are so many unknowns that when you start looking at how you are going to accommodate this &apos;free or reduced care&apos; you don&apos;t have the infrastructure set up to do so. As a hospital leader we have to be aware of that and try to accommodate getting more physicians in the area.&quot;
Efforts continue to recruit new doctors.
&quot;It&apos;s not easy because everybody wants more docs so it&apos;s a long term process. That is something that has to be available to this community because they (the people) are going to show up at the ER if they don&apos;t have the ability to go to a family doctor. Somebody will suffer there because you have acute patients that need to be taken care of and if you overload that with primary care patients it&apos;s going to be a difficult process.&quot;
Linton family physician Dr. Fred Ridge, of the Ridge Medical Clinic, is cautiously optimistic that some good things may come from the health care overhaul.
&quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned there is no doubt that we need to reform our health delivery system. My main problem is the bill did not do enough to control insurance companies and pharmacies,&quot; Ridge said. &quot;There are some good things in the bill. We have 32 million more people covered and they (the government) is going to work to increase funds for training of primary care physicians, which we have a real shortage of.&quot;
Ridge, who also serves as Greene County Health Officer, said there will also be an increase in funding for training sites for primary care doctors.
&quot;That may help us at the Rural Health Center at Terre Haute. At least I am hoping it will,&quot; he said. &quot;In 2011, they are going to have a 10 percent (Medicare) bonus for doctors practicing in health professional shortage areas. That&apos;s us. The bad thing is people don&apos;t realize that in the past six years they have cut us 25 percent compared to inflation. Whereas, hospitals over the same time have gone up 25 percent.&quot;
Ridge continued, &quot;I am just really happy that more people are going to be covered and I&apos;m hopeful they are going to do more to get people primary care doctors. They (the government) are going to support medical homes where they can make sure they (patients) get all of their preventive care up to date.&quot;
On the negative side, Ridge said he feels like Congress didn&apos;t go far enough in its reform measures.
&quot;I don&apos;t like the special deals. I think that is wrong. And they didn&apos;t come down on the insurance companies hard enough,&quot; he added. &quot;Only about 17 cents of every dollar you pay for insurance goes for physicians or physicians services. To say, they (insurance companies) are raising their rates because of what they are paying the doctors, well they don&apos;t raise what they are paying us.&quot;
What&apos;s in the Healthcare reform legislation?
By The Associated Press
HOW MANY COVERED: 32 million uninsured. Major coverage expansion begins in 2014. When fully phased in, 95 percent of eligible Americans would have coverage, compared with 83 percent today.
COST: $940 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
INSURANCE MANDATE: Almost everyone is required to be insured or else pay a fine, which takes effect in 2014. There is an exemption for low-income people.
INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS: Starting this year, insurers would be forbidden from placing lifetime dollar limits on policies, from denying coverage to children because of pre-existing conditions, and from canceling policies because someone gets sick. Parents would be able to keep older kids on their coverage up to age 26. A new high-risk pool would offer coverage to uninsured people with medical problems until 2014, when the coverage expansion goes into high gear. Major consumer safeguards would also take effect in 2014. Insurers would be prohibited from denying coverage to people with medical problems or charging them more. Insurers could not charge women more.
MEDICAID: Expands the federal-state Medicaid insurance program for the poor to cover people with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, $29,327 a year for a family of four. Childless adults would be covered for the first time, starting in 2014. The federal government would pay 100 percent of costs for covering newly eligible individuals through 2016.
If the Senate approves a package of changes this week, a special deal that would have given Nebraska 100 percent federal financing for newly eligible Medicaid recipients in perpetuity would be eliminated. A different, one-time deal negotiated by Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu for her state, Louisiana, worth as much as $300 million, remains.
TAXES: To make up for the lost revenue, the bill applies an increased Medicare payroll tax to the investment income and to the wages of individuals making more than $200,000, or married couples above $250,000. The tax on investment income would be 3.8 percent. If the Senate follows through, it would impose a 40 percent tax on high-cost insurance plans above the threshold of $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. The tax would go into effect in 2018.
ABORTION: The bill tries to maintain a strict separation between taxpayer dollars and private premiums that would pay for abortion coverage. No health plan would be required to offer coverage for abortion. In plans that do cover abortion, policyholders would have to pay for it separately, and that money would have to be kept in a separate account from taxpayer money. States could ban abortion coverage in plans offered through the exchange. Exceptions would be made for cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother.
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: Gradually closes the &quot;doughnut hole&quot; coverage gap in the Medicare prescription drug benefit that seniors fall into once they have spent $2,830. Seniors who hit the gap this year will receive a $250 rebate. Beginning in 2011, seniors in the gap receive a discount on brand name drugs, initially 50 percent off. When the gap is completely eliminated in 2020, seniors will still be responsible for 25 percent of the cost of their medications until Medicare&apos;s catastrophic coverage kicks in.
EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITY: Employers are hit with a fee if the government subsidizes their workers&apos; coverage. The $2,000-per-employee fee would be assessed on the company&apos;s entire work force, minus an allowance. Companies with 50 or fewer workers are exempt from the requirement. Part-time workers are included in the calculations, counting two part-timers as one full-time worker.
SUBSIDIES: The aid is available on a sliding scale for households making up to four times the federal poverty level, $88,200 for a family of four. Premiums for a family of four making $44,000 would be capped at around 6 percent of income.
HOW YOU CHOOSE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE: Small businesses, the self-employed and the uninsured could pick a plan offered through new state-based purchasing pools called exchanges, opening for business in 2014. The exchanges would offer the same kind of purchasing power that employees of big companies benefit from. People working for medium-to-large firms would not see major changes. But if they lose their jobs or strike out on their own, they may be eligible for subsidized coverage through the exchange.
GOVERNMENT-RUN PLAN: No government-run insurance plan. People purchasing coverage through the new insurance exchanges would have the option of signing up for national plans overseen by the federal office that manages the health plans available to members of Congress. Those plans would be private, but one would have to be nonprofit.

They didn&apos;t vote for Health Care Reform they voted for control of the people. In years past the only people they had control over was welfare folks, now they have total control over us from the richest to the poorest. Wait and see but I think alot of people are going to be sorry they voted for Obama ecspecially when we wake up and realize that our freedoms were voted away in the name of reform.

Yes, localyokal, this is not about health care, it about power. I think we are already seeing people who voted for Obama become disenfranchised.
In November expect to start seeing Democrats &quot;warning&quot; people that Republicans want to take their health care away. Also, look for the government option to come up again, soon.

I would like to point out that under the reconciliation bill in the Senate the Louisiana deal will apply to all states equally.
 -- Posted by DonCon on Wed, Mar 24, 2010, at 4:58 PM 
Wow! Uland would prefer changes at a slower pace. Well, they&apos;ve been trying to change health care for over 100 years. Guess we could go for 200 years.

some people with inadequate insurance policies can also have coverage under this plan. in the end it&apos;s all about who&apos;s gonna get the most money, and my insurance company sure is getting a ton of it right now, for not a lot of help to me. my per year deductible is twice my premium. so, how&apos;s that supposed to help me? it doesn&apos;t. maybe more emphasis also needs to be put to the drug companies for cheaper alternatives than high priced medicines that insurances won&apos;t cover until deductibles are met too...
 -- Posted by oddities on Wed, Mar 24, 2010, at 6:30 PM 
I agree that more needs to be done, but this is just the beginning. Eventually we will have to reform malpractice insurance, and work on bringing down the cost of premiums, but this is a good start. This bill will hopefully take down the amount we pay on uninsured emergency room visits.
 -- Posted by DonCon on Wed, Mar 24, 2010, at 6:40 PM 
I agree this is a positive step in the right direction. There is more work to be done, but it&apos;s great to see that finally the indigent will be able to get health care. Good health should not be a privilege, because it is a basic human right. My firm belief is that it should be free across the board just like the air we breath. We should have the same right to health. I know my opinion won&apos;t be popular, but I&apos;ve been indigent, and I speak for myself.

1) Young Adults Can stay on their parents health care plan until the age 26.
2)No child under 19 will be excluded from plans because of preexisting conditions
3)Adults with preexisting conditions will be able to start shopping online for a plan in a national high-risk pool while waiting for insurance exchanges to get started. Small business can deduct as much as 50 percent of employees health benefits for tax purposes in 2009 and 2010.
4)It will eliminate caps on how much care you can get in one year
5)It will fill in the &quot;donut hole&quot; of Medicare prescription drug coverage with a rebate
6)Insurers will have to post their balance sheets online, listing administrative costs, executive compensation packages, and benefit payments
7)And you can no longer be dropped from your insurance plan just because you get sick.
This is just a few instant effects of reform that has taken place because of the democrats passing this bill.
Most Importantly, the Presidents executive order ensures that federal funs are not used for abortion services in this bill (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), nothing has change with abortion laws in the country, the country will continue to consistent with the Hyde Amendemnt.

UMM..there is a reason why healthcare HASNT passed for such a long time. I do believe something needed to be done about healthcare cost but this isnt right. This is the start of the demolition of our working government. When they take your right away to make choices...hows that gonna work out? People need to get off there lazy butts and get a job and quit depending on tax payers to pay for them. One of the biggest conflictions with this bill is abortion. Just think, we all are paying for abortions with our tax money! I love my country but it sure makes me sick to think what &quot;we&quot; stand for sometimes.

i HAVE a job, AND i go to school...the problem is, my workplace wants to give me terrible insurance, so yeah, i have insurance, but it&apos;s just like i told the lady from my insurance company on the phone &apos;where am i supposed to get $400 for this prescription?&apos; her response &apos;i don&apos;t know&apos; and all that because before my insurance will pay anything on doctor visits, and prescriptions, well, basically everything, i must pay 3000 out of my pocket. so, a fifth of my yearly gross income is needed to pay my medical costs first...not to mention the pile of bills that comes without fail every month...but yeah, lets not help out those who actually could need it and not just want it cos they&apos;re lazy...healthcare should be a right, not a privelage for those who are thought to be better than others
 -- Posted by oddities on Wed, Mar 24, 2010, at 9:53 PM 
Why should a business HAVE to provide you with insurance. Its your choice to work for them or not. And if they didnt jack up the prices for healthcare this wouldnt be a subject in the first place. The problem is the cost of healthcare, not jobs providing insurance. Its really a no win situation.
 -- Posted by BadSpellerrr on Wed, Mar 24, 2010, at 11:04 PM 
I&apos;m too tired for debate right now. But wanted to post a thought for mental digest. Someone posted that the new health care is unconstitutional. So is paying federal taxes. In fact, not only is it unconstitutional, but that amendment was never ratified, ever. Yet, try NOT paying your taxes, unless you are very very rich and brave (perhaps stupid). Regardless of constitutionality, you will have fines and jailtime.
Today the Constitution isn&apos;t worth the parchement it was written on. Lawyers have added so many changes that it&apos;s barely recognizeable.
So if America is willing to pay their taxes without grumbling about constitutionality, the government knows that we&apos;ll do what they say with only moderate grumbling until the next generation who is used to it and it grows quieter with every generation.
I am for health care reform. I prefer the Canadian model, but I see this as a good first step. But I&apos;m in the minority here. And like I said, I&apos;m too tired to debate today. Just a thought about constitutionality.

The healthcare bill is not about healthcare but is about power. If the federal government can get the american people dependent on it then the government controls the people not the people control the government like it is susposed to be. The government already has a lot of people completely dependent on them for most everything. This is going to make us more dependent. That is what has happened in communist counties and we are headed down that path. Another federal department with 150,000 employees. Soon most people in US will be working for federal government either directly or indirectly. Really not all that far from it now. Our freedoms are being taken from right under our noses and we are letting it happen. WAKE UP PEOPLE AND VOTE EVERYONE OF THEM OUT IN NOVEMBER BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND START WITH NEW ONES AND CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM CONTROL US.

People are missing the entire message of the socalled Health Reform Bill. They are making it mandatory to have insurance (not a good thing for people who do not need the Government to tell them what to do!) Our rights to make decisions and choices are being reduced, effectively.
ALSO a lot of people think they can drop present coverage and get less expensive or free insurance and that will not be the case. In reality, most people who have coverage will not be allowed to drop it in order to opt for this program.
AND most importantly, there is no guarantee that this new reform will offer adequate or good coverage - those of us who have medicare KNOW what can happen there! The Medicare coverage shrinks with each year as the premiums and copays increase - making it vital to carry a supplemental policy. The Government does not need to rear its head into the insurance coverage arena - they should spend more time looking into Medicare and Medicaid fraud - that would save billions a year! There are no free lunches and this is a prime example!
The interesting thing is that Congress exempted itself from being included in this reform. Union program recipients are also exempt. If it is such a great solution, why are there any exemptions? Look around you and consider WHO this reform will actually provide services for. It is not a universal answer to health care costs but will actually only benefit a very limited number of people. Many who will get assistance already are served by the Medicaid program and this will just move funds from one area to another not really saving any money. It was made mandatory a few years ago that Medicare recipients have a supplimentary form of coverage - these will go by the wayside and be included in the reform - again shuffling funds from one area to another. Those who currently have employer or retirement insurance will virtually be locked into the current plans. Most of us will STILL be paying high premiums - probably higher premiums - to pay for the reform.....

&quot;The health care bill is unconstitutional. Our federal government has no authority to require its citizens to purchase a private product. &quot;
Exactly! This is the elephant in the room. How could anyone think this could possibly be allowed by the Constitution?
The Constitution has been trampled on for too long, both by those who mean well and those who are corrupt. It is time the States reassert their sovereignty under the Constitution.
Does anyone here have any argument for why this should be considered Constitutional? I would love to hear it.

Congress shall have the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.
The Congress shall have power [...] To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.
to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.
The State suing the federal government have no case because. The power of the federal government to do this has been held up by numerous precedence, which the supreme has to take into account. The Constitution, especially it clauses such as the necessary and proper clause, the commerce clause, and the general welfare clause, are very open to interpretation. For Liberty, your interpretation is obviously not the same as mine, but the fact is that I have judicial precedence on my side, and I believe in the end the implied powers will win over the 10th amendment. Thank you Alexander Hamilton.
I have a question. Why are health insurance mandates unconstitutional but auto insurance mandates are completely fine. I realize its done at the state level, but it is still government interference.
 -- Posted by DonCon on Thu, Mar 25, 2010, at 11:20 AM 
Health insurance is is like car insurance in that it is meant for unforeseen circumstances that would cause financial hardships without insurance, i.e. broken bones or surgery. You don&apos;t expect your car insurance to help pay for oil changes or tires, like wise we shouldn&apos;t expect health insurance to cover routine things like doctor visits or medication.
This bill FORCES American citizens who can afford medical care to take care of those that can&apos;t. Some will argue that before this bill, one could go to the emergency room, not pay the bill and the cost was passed onto patients who do pay their bill. Under this bill, even if I don&apos;t go to the hospital, I am forced to help pay.
While I empathize with people who have serious medical conditions like diabetes or some other debilitation, I do not think it is right to expect or force others to help pay for your medical costs. We have charities and non-profit hospitals for that purpose. It is fine to ask for help but this bill goes beyond &quot;asking&quot; and uses force.

Globe&amp;Anchor;,
what do you mean the right-wingers were wrong. They were right on both counts and are right about this. Medicare is going broke and they just keep on raising taxes and premiums and copays to try to keep it afloat.Social Security is in the same boat. Our children and grandchildren won&apos;t have either one, but they will be paying for what we have run them in debt for. The federal government cannot run anything right, they just keep printing new money that is worthless.
For DonCon:
Car insurance is not manditory. You are not required to buy a car and take out insurance. You have a choice, with health insurance there will be no choice. Thats a big difference. The federal government is limited in laws they can pass. The constution denies it the right to infringe on states rights to make laws in some areas. Of course if they want to make a state do something they don&apos;t want to, they just threaten to withhold millions of dollars from the states and force them to do what the constution says they are not allowed to do. You need to study the constitution a little closer and you would see why this is unconstituional.

For Liberty:
We already pay for Medicare, right? So we have already been forced to buy insurance. We are forced to buy health insurance for when we reach a certain age. Now we are forced to buy it without the age factor. We know that Medicare has been upheld through various challenges since its inception. I believe this act will also hold up under the same rationale.

L A that is an incredible exaggeration. The reason Reps introduced that amendment to use it as political ammunition, because if the Dems don&apos;t pass it they are on the side of child molesters, and if they do pass it the bill has to go back to the house, and we spend another month on this issue. Hilltop, I actually study the Constitution to a great extent and am very familiar with its contents and how it has been interpreted by the court in history. I am also very familiar with legislative process. Disagreeing with you does not mean I don&apos;t understand it. We just have different ideas about what it means. It&apos;s a very vague document.

we are not forced to buy medicare. You can decline to buy it if you want (part B) part A is free so we don&apos;t pay for it (with a premium, of course nothing is really free with our government, and it cannot be.)

You are certainly entitled to your opinion; and, I have earned the right to express mine, many times over.
Any error the Federal government makes is our error. We elect our Executve and Legislative leaders. The republicans are owned by the health insurance companies, thus their oppositon. Don&apos;t take my word for it, check the list of campaign contributors and see where they donate their money. They buy protection from the republicans.
Health insurance is BIG money in this country.
The profits of the top 5 health insurance companies rose 56% in just the last year. And during the same time period they canceled coverage on 2,500,000 policy holders.
Yet, you don&apos;t think we need change. Sorry, I just can&apos;t agree. Our Congress and our President did the right thing. And, I hope it was just a good start.

I pay for Medicare with every paycheck. I don&apos;t have a choice. The government won&apos;t allow me to say &quot;I won&apos;t need any help with health costs when I&apos;m older so I would like to stop paying this Medicare tax.&quot; Maybe you say this isn&apos;t &quot;buying medicare,&quot; but the point is I don&apos;t have a choice about it. I&apos;m sure this precident will be extremely important to any future challenge of the new health bill.

You are certainly entitled to your opinion and believe me I hope you are right about this being a good thing. I am a democrat and not a republican in case you think I am. I still don&apos;t think the federal government can get anything right. What program have they ever done right? They end up costing more and doing less than before. Why should the federal government require people to have insurance who don&apos;t have the money to pay for it, and why should we have to pay to let non US citizens to get free health care. If you don&apos;t believe this is what is happening read the bill, and before you ask, no I have not read it all, but I have read parts of it. Go to the web site WWW.aclj.com and read about it. You say the republicans are in health insurance pocket, but the democrats get money from them to, and Obama is trying to get the hispanic vote with all his help he is giving illegals. You are right we elected them and now we need to replace them and you will see big changes in congress next year.

We do agree because I hope it eventually is a good thing too. Anyone that expects it to be perfect initially is in for a surprise, but with
amendments the health care act can be great legislation.
We will debate immigration another time, but I would imagine there are American hispanics whose
ancestors have lived in this country longer than either yours or mine.
In all fairness, I think you have an axe to grind and it is not about the health care act. You need to work on your smoke screen just a wee bit.

Mine isn&apos;t and now I will have to pay for some people who don&apos;t want to work. There is medicaid for those who are indigent-again taxpayers pay for that.

I do not have any problem with hispanics who are US citizens or ones that are here legaly getting healthcare. I guess I should not have said hispanics and I apologize for using them as a example. What I said goes for any illegal alien. It just happens that there are a lot of illegals in Florida who by law have to be given free healthcare and are given over a thousand dollars a month for each child they have, and some have several children after they get here just to get money. The state of Florida has to pay this. The health care bill also requires giving healthcare to illegal aliens, whatever race they are and this is not right. Don&apos;t you think we should furnish food and housing for everyone also? Why should we quit with healthcare? Who do you think is going to pay for all this healthcare? You surely are not naive enough to believe it is going to reduce the deficit like they are trying to sell us do you? There is not a truthful polition in our federal government.

You assume because I&apos;m now indigent I can&apos;t own a computer, perhaps you feel I shouldn&apos;t own one. But let me square that away.
Just because I am now indigent does not mean it was always so for me. I grew up in a family of financial privilege. I had what I needed: I had what I wanted and I even had what my friends&apos; wanted. But along with that, I was not raised to think that I had a right to live off my parents or others&apos; hard work. If I wanted nice things, I had to earn them myself.
I worked, and worked hard for the things I possessed. I sometimes worked 120 hours a week. I own this computer through my own labor. I also own a nice (very nice) vehicle, free and clear, because I worked to earn it.
I became indigent because I had serious health problems that required many tests, and later surgery. I had no insurance at the time this happened because of my divorce and my wages paid my living expenses, not insurance, which would have been a luxury at that point. I could no longer work, so despite the fact that I possess a computer, a nice vehicle, jewellery, etc, I am indigent. And before the comment is made, yes, I did sell most of the jewellery (except for my grandmother&apos;s pieces).
Healthcare reform earlier would have made the difference for me. I would be in a better position financially if this had gone through earllier.
So, I am not one &apos;looking for a government hand out&apos; as someone suggested. But I might point out that there is a vast difference between a hand out and a hand up.
It&apos;s easy to sit in judgement when you do not know the facts (I&apos;m just as guilty as anyone else, as much as I hate to admit that). A few paragraphs on a blog can never give the full story, and we judge from the bits and pieces we read in those paragraphs.
But I&apos;m for the healthcare bill because I have walked in both sets of shoes and know that it will make a difference to so many people. I am aware of someone who works very hard, has a degree even, and yet cannot afford any health coverage for their family. This person has to make small cash payments and can only see the doctor for major emergencies. That has nothing to do with 6 month check ups, etc that just isn&apos;t financially possible. But people assume the only ones that are for it, that will benefit, are lazy people who just don&apos;t want to work. That&apos;s bullpocky. There&apos;s a segment of the population that work very hard to make ends meet and for them, health care has become a luxury. I feel it&apos;s a God-given right for all. It&apos;s sad that hard working Americans can&apos;t even go to the dentist or doctor when it&apos;s necessary. My own health care emergency cost me my livlihood. Maybe under this new system, it won&apos;t rob someone else of theirs.
It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s a wonderful first step and so needed.

Queenie,
You failed to mention-if you are indigent you would qualify for Medicaid. Healthcare is not a god given right.
My husband owned his own company several years ago and did not have health insurance. Why? Because it was too expensive and so he couldn&apos;t AFFORD it and HE DID WITHOUT.
Hand up or hand out-still money being taken out of taxpayers pockets.There needs to be reform-but this is NOT the way to go.

I&apos;m from outta state, but a friend emailed me and told me what kinds of things were being said here and I had to look for myself. I can&apos;t believe what I&apos;m reading. Are you people for real? This great health care bill is going to make a whole lotta difference for lots of folks needing help. You people need to support this great nation and our leader who is doing the best job for the american public. We need to stand behind this great man who is leading us toward the best system on the planet. Give him your support. You owe it to him.

Again, you assume. You know that saying about assume, don&apos;t you?
I DO NOT qualify for medicaid. I am not pregnant. And I may be old, but not old enough. It turns out Indiana is one of 2 (Two) states remaining that doesn&apos;t provide medicaid for women who are not pregnant. 48 other states have advanced, Indiana + one other remain (as usual) behind times.
I did apply for HIP. It only took me 18 months to get it. But finally, I did get it. It isn&apos;t much, but it helps. I absolutely can&apos;t wait for the bill to take effect. Maybe then I can get help with dental and vision.
Thanks

Dental and vision are really not that expensive to pay for yourself.

Wanna pay mine? They are out of reach for me right now.

The only time any thing here was FREE, was when &quot;WE&quot;, English,German,Spanish,Asian and African.
were taking this country away from the American Indian. since then we continue to have our freedoms taken away by our own Government.
Usually &quot;WE&quot; are told for our own good?

I am not a federal employee. I work in the private sector. Pursuant to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), I pay 1.45% of my earnings to the government to support Medicare. The specific cite is Title 26 Subtitle C Chapter 21 of the U.S. Code.
Again, this is only relevant to this discussion because I believe the Supreme Court will have to address this precident when considering challenges to the new health bill regarding the provisions requiring citizens to have health insurance.

Notgreenenative,
You couldn&apos;t knock me down a peg if you had a wrecking ball. I could eat you for breakfast and still walk away hungry.
You&apos;re guilty of assuming facts not stated, which is rather presumptuous of you and arrogant.
I won&apos;t try to knock you down a peg or two. I quite like you right where you are. It makes you easy to locate in my crosshairs, so to speak.
I know where to come hunting you later, if I get hungry for a snack. Now go play with someone your own mental age (somewhere around your shoe size, judging by your comments).

notgreenenative,
is queenie your ex or something? you shure are hateful to her. did she do something to you? some of the stuff you say about her looks like either you know her face to face or your assuming things about cuz she didn&apos;t say all that. maybe i missed something, but i don&apos;t get your attitude toward her at all. i&apos;d be mad at you too.
like dogs in a dog fight. we need to throw a bucket of water on &apos;em to cool it off.

All this arguing about Health Care! The plain and simple truth is-- Impeach this worthless non American president and get one in there that is truly concerned about what is best for America! This is only the beginning of the downfall of America if we don&apos;t get rid of this president. He is out to please every illegal, etc. because he is TRULY NOT AN AMERICAN HIMSLF!!! If something isn&apos;t done the true American who is born in this country will be the Minority.

Scorpio1969,
I don&apos;t think you are right about him not being an American, but you sure are right about needing to get him out of the White House, in the next election, which I think we will. We also need the people in California to wake up and get Pelosi out to. If they keep it up this country is doomed.

we all need some kind of health ins. people that land in the hospital and have no way to pay the bill walk away, while the hospitals and doctors over charge the people that have ins. example, in 2008 i was put in the ICU at GCGH for less than 24 hrs. my bill was almost 10,000. now who was my ins. company paying for?
 -- Posted by slaw on Sun, Mar 28, 2010, at 1:32 PM 
Part of the problem is we don&apos;t know what prices to expect when we go in for treatment. If we knew the prices a hospital or doctor charged, we could comparison shop out health care. Just like at a fast food restaurant, you can look at the menu and prices before you decide. In emergencies that&apos;s not so important but for non-emergency care, it would help a lot if we knew the costs up front.
