 Fight at Drive-Thru Window Over Chicken Nuggets 
Some people take their food seriously - but no one more than one customer at a fast-food outlet in Toledo, Ohio.

Melodi Dushane was so frustrated that she couldn&apos;t order chicken nuggets - because the restaurant was serving breakfast - that she attacked the member of staff.

On the surveillance video, Dushane, 25, appears to get out of her car and hit the drive-through employee in the mouth.

Seconds later it seems she smashes the window before driving off.

She was arrested and faces vandalism charges.
