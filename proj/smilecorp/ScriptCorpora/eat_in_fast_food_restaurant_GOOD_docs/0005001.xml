		Who Wears the Pants - Part 7 
 by Jennifer Loraine 
Howard was so intent on getting more milk that he wasn&apos;t aware that Anita had 
silently walked into the room and was watching him while he nursed and pooped. A 
slow smile grew on her face as the smell of a dirty diaper hit her. Anita had 
called earlier to see how he was doing and was told about his accidents. When 
the supervisor had called and told her what had happened when they attempted to 
diaper him, she wasn&apos;t surprised at his reaction. She had told them she agreed 
with their decision to put him in a playpen for an extended timeout and 
suggested they leave him in the playpen for the balance of the afternoon. She 
had told them that his regressive behavior must have meant that he wanted to be 
treated like a baby and that it would probably make him feel more secure if they 
put him in the nursery with the other babies. Anita suggested that they give him 
his milk in a baby bottle to reinforce his sense of security. The supervisor 
agreed immediately to Anita&apos;s suggestions for the handling of the little 
hellion. She wanted Howard&apos;s disruptive influence on the other children to be 
removed as soon as possible. Anita&apos;s rationalization for treating him like an 
infant meshed perfectly with the supervisor&apos;s understanding of child psychology. 
Once Howard was reduced to helpless dependence, he would become more tractable.
Howard opened his eyes to see Anita grinning at him while he sucked on the 
bottle. He got up and stood unsteadily in her presence as much out of fear as 
out of respect. The thick diaper between his legs made it difficult to stand up 
straight. The padding bunched up between his legs and forced them farther apart 
than he was used to; as a result, he had to use the unsteady bowlegged stance of 
a diapered infant. He swayed uncertainly on his feet and had to grasp the 
railing of the playpen with one hand to stay upright while his other hand still 
held the bottle. The attendant left the room for a few minutes, giving Anita the 
chance to lean over the railing of the playpen and whisper in Howard&apos;s ear as 
she began deep massaging his lower tummy just above his diaper, &quot;Well, I think 
you&apos;ve managed to convince them that you&apos;re a very immature three-year-old. All 
in all, Mommy is very pleased with your little performance here today. The 
supervisor was so impressed with how young you acted that she told Mommy that 
she feels sorry for you because you&apos;ve lost your real mommy. She thinks you need 
to be allowed to regress back to babyhood when you&apos;re here so you can get over 
the absence of your mommy. She also recommended that you be treated the same way 
at home too and Mommy agreed with her.&quot;
Anita stopped and paused dramatically for her last statement and continued, 
&quot;You were very naughty! So for the next two weeks, they&apos;re going to keep you 
with the babies here in the nursery rather than let you set a bad example for 
the other toddlers at the Daycare Center.&quot;
Howard frowned around the nipple but continued to suck as Anita said, &quot;It 
won&apos;t be so bad, Honeybunch! Mommy promises you&apos;ll get used to diapers in a few 
days.&quot;
She glanced around the room and said in a gentle scolding tone, &quot;Mommy heard 
about the fight you gave them when they tried to diaper you. It appears that you 
lost the battle in more ways than one.&quot;
She chuckled and grinned, &quot;It looks like it will take some getting used to so 
you can stand without falling while wearing dydees! Don&apos;t worry, Sweetiepie, 
after a couple of days, you&apos;ll be waddling around here easily in your dydees 
like all the other infants. Do you like drinking from a ba-ba, Honeybunch? Maybe 
Mommy should get you some bottles so you can nurse at home too! Mommy doesn&apos;t 
think you&apos;ll have a problem with getting the attendants to care for you just 
like you were one of the babies. You look soooo cute in your dydees with your 
ba-ba in your mouth! You look like you fit right in with the other babies here, 
Sweetie!&quot;
Anita kissed his cheek and said, &quot;You make an adorable infant, Sweetiepie!&quot;
She stopped massaging him when she felt a tiny contraction from his lower 
bowel underneath her fingertips. Anita smiled warmly at him and put her hand on 
the back of his diaper to pat his bottom lightly as if comforting him. As 
expected, the deep abdominal massage had stimulated his bowels into evacuating 
themselves again. This time however, his bladder had responded as well. Howard 
could feel the front of his diaper become warm as he soaked it with pee. She 
patted his diapered bottom a little harder, pushing on the pile of warm poop 
that he had expelled against his behind. Howard&apos;s expression changed to one of 
surprised dismay when he realized the horrible thing he had done in Anita&apos;s 
presence. Anita said sweetly, &quot;Weren&apos;t you aware of the fact that you had pooped 
in your dydee? Oh dear, Mommy can see by your face that you just realized it! 
Poor baby! Didn&apos;t you know that most babies your age poop while standing? Poor 
Howie, Mommy can see that you didn&apos;t intend to make a poopy! You need to sit 
down if you don&apos;t want to mess in your dydees!&quot;
Anita put her hand behind his knees and forced them to bend. As his legs 
folded, Howard collapsed in slow motion to the pad of the playpen. His bottom 
hit first, spreading the soft mess in the back of his diaper over his bottom. 
Howard wanted to cry. Not only had his incontinence provoked the daycare workers 
to put him in diapers, but he had proved they were right by promptly filling 
them with poop! They would never let him go back to training pants now! He 
kicked his legs petulantly and felt himself pee again.
&quot;Oh dear, just look at the time!&quot;, Anita said in mock concern, &quot;Mommy&apos;s break 
is almost over! Mommy has to go back to work, Sweetheart, she just wanted to see 
if you were okay. Mommy will be sure to tell your attendant that you have a 
poopy dydee so she can change you as soon as possible. Mommy will be back in a 
little while to take you home. Mommy has some shopping to do and is going to 
leave work early today. Now behave yourself and let the attendant change you 
without a fuss. If you don&apos;t let them change your dirty dydee, you&apos;re going to 
have a terrible case of dydee rash. Now wave bye-bye for Mommy! That&apos;s a good 
baby! Mommy will see you later!&quot;
Howard sat in the warm ooze of his diaper, weeping tears of failure and 
abandonment as Anita left to return to her office. Presently his attendant 
returned and lifted him from the playpen. She carried him to the changing 
station and laid him on his back, then pulled off the tabs on the disposable he 
was wearing. Howard gazed helplessly up into the attendant&apos;s face as she 
undiapered him. As she lifted the front of his diaper gingerly and brought it 
down between his legs to expose the mess in the rear of his diaper, he averted 
his eyes towards the ceiling in embarrassment. She took one look at the brown 
mess that had spread over his bottom and shook her head, saying, &quot;Ooooh, you&apos;re 
one stinky little boy!&quot;
Howard closed his eyes in shame at her comment as a fresh flow of tears began 
leaking from the corners of his eyes. &quot;Don&apos;t cry, Sugar! We&apos;ll get you cleaned 
up and in a fresh diaper in a few minutes. Then you&apos;ll be our sweet baby again,&quot; 
said the attendant as she took his ankles in one hand, raised his legs and used 
the back of the diaper to scrape the muck from his behind.
Once most of the mess had been removed, she slid the diaper out and laid it 
to one side. Then she took one of the baby wipes from the tub at the station and 
finished cleansing him with the towelette. Howard was mortified by the 
procedure. He felt as if his ego had been shattered into millions of 
infinitesimal shards by the experience; he was beyond regrowth and rebuilding. A 
fey thought crossed his mind as he felt his legs lifted again and his bottom 
lowered onto the surface of the clean diaper, &quot;How did the rhyme he had learned 
so long ago go? ...All the King&apos;s horses and all the King&apos;s men, couldn&apos;t put 
Howard together again...&quot;
Howard giggled insanely at his unvoiced joke as the attendant pulled the 
diaper up between his legs and began taping the loose ends of the diaper 
together. Howard knew at that moment that whatever happened in the future, he 
would never be the man he had been before. Something important had broken 
inside. He would never be able to dictate to a woman again. They were the strong 
ones who would make the decisions and tell him what to do. Howard would be 
content to lie passively and accept whatever they desired for him.
The attendant smiled at his gay giggle, it was obvious that her charge was 
adapting to life at the Daycare Center. She picked up his limp body and carried 
the unresisting tot to an unoccupied crib for his &quot;official&quot; afternoon nap. 
After having raised the side of the crib, she went to Howard&apos;s playpen and 
retrieved his plushy duckie, blankie and his pacifier. She returned to his crib 
and tucked the toy in his arms and put the pacifier in his grateful mouth. 
Howard cuddled the soft velveteen of his duckie to his chest to comfort his 
bruised ego and sucked unconsciously on the pacifier&apos;s nipple while the 
attendant tucked the blankie around his diminished body. He lay in the crib with 
huge unblinking eyes for a few minutes before the lids became to heavy to keep 
open and he drifted off into a deep dreamless slumber.
When Howard awoke, the nursery hadn&apos;t changed. The nursery smells of poop, 
stale pee and the perfume of freshly opened packages of disposable diapers mixed 
together to form an aroma that was well-known to every mother and daycare 
worker. For the infants in the nursery with Howard, the bouquet of nursery odors 
merely smelled like home. Howard thought that the smell was vaguely familiar. He 
wasn&apos;t able to pick out the individual odors from the mix, but the sweet-sour 
combination of fragrances triggered long forgotten memories of a time of utter 
contentment that lay buried in the deepmost recesses of his unconscious. His 
pacifier was still in his mouth and his duckie was still clutched in his arms. 
He had kicked off his blankie in his sleep to lay in a tangle at his feet. 
Howard yawned hugely, allowing the pacifier to fall from his mouth and dangle 
from its ribbon. He moved his legs to stretch them luxuriantly, making the 
plastic on his diaper crinkle in response. &quot;What&apos;s that noise?&quot;, Howard thought, 
&quot;Oh, yeah,....It must be my diapers. I wonder if I wet them again while I was 
sleeping?&quot;
Howard put his hand down and tried to put it in his diaper. He couldn&apos;t, the 
diaper had been fastened too snuggly against his waist. He took his hand and 
pushed against the outside of his diaper to force the lining against his skin. 
If it was wet, the close contact with his skin would be more than sufficient to 
allow him perceive any pee trapped within its confines. When Howard held the 
diaper tightly against his crotch, he could feel a slight dampness beneath the 
clothlike paper liner that separated his skin from the absorbent padding of the 
diaper. He had dribbled while he slept, but not truly wet the diaper. Howard 
wasn&apos;t sure if that was an improvement over his previous behavior or not. Was 
his bladder so uncontrolled that he would only dribble continuously? Or was it 
an indication of a little leakage from an almost full bladder? He didn&apos;t feel 
like he needed to go. Howard lay back on the mattress and closed his eyes again. 
It was good to lay there and let the mattress cradle his body. They would tell 
him when it was time to move and carry him there when it was time to go. It 
wasn&apos;t as if he had someplace of his own to go or some job he had contracted to 
do. His responsibility for his life had ended the moment he had entered the 
nursery. All that was required of him was acquiescent compliance with his 
attendant&apos;s wishes. He wouldn&apos;t have been able to oppose them even if he had had 
the desire to confront his caretakers. Howard&apos;s battered will had receded into a 
hidden cave of his mind to cower in the darkness until the time was right to 
reemerge. Until then, he could only passively observe and wait, obeying the 
women who had become the mistresses of his fate.
Howard lay shut his eyes and relaxed in the crib, drifting in and out of 
sleep. While he lay in repose, his hand wormed its way up to his face and 
inserted its thumb between his lips. Occasionally, he would suck on his thumb as 
he dreamed, then his mouth would become flaccid again as he descended back into 
a deep infantine slumber.
