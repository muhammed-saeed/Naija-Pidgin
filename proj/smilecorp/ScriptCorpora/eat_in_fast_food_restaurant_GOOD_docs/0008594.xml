 December 17, 2011 Likes it Oklahoma BBQ Eaters Anonymous Is it worth driving across the state for. Nope, it really isn&apos;t but if you are on the south side of Oklahoma City. It&apos;s definitely not going to be a wasted stop to eat some Q. More from Oklahoma BBQ Eaters Anonymous

 June 28, 2012 Likes it delicious sides! by kat ( 1 review ) I&apos;m going to be honest, I come here for the sides. They have amazing mashed potatoes that are chock full of flavor. I crave their macaroni and cheese frequently - its thick, creamy, and deliciously cheesy. I&apos;ve had their brisket and turkey breast. Both are pretty good. Their meat is hit and miss sometimes, and I don&apos;t know why. Some days it can be a little dryer than other days. I think it may depend on what time of day you come. But for the most part - it&apos;s pretty good. My friend gets the pulled pork sandwich every time and it&apos;s great. If you&apos;re in the neighborhood and want decent barbeque, you should stop by. Not phenomenal, but good! November 11, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Keri ( 12 reviews ) Love it and crave it! June 11, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it not really that good by hungry as a ......bear ( 73 reviews ) a friend told me to go here and i did but the food i got was overpriced. the ribs looked and tasted like they had been boiled in water and then put on a smoker for a few minutes. the best thing was the smoked sausage but i can make good smoked sausage at home for much cheaper. August 8, 2011 Likes it Give them a try! by TL ( 30 reviews ) The food was very good and we all like the portions that was served, very friendly staff and all in all it was a good experience, and we will go back. March 2, 2011 Likes it really did like it!!!! by karen ( 32 reviews ) i love the polish and the turkey soooooooooooo good!!!!! but they had no ribs.......... January 16, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Just not good... by Sunni ( 29 reviews ) I had the rib dinner -- the pool of grease left on my plate was quite unappetizing. The mac and cheese was dry, as if it had been in the steam table all day. The baked beans, however, were very good. My son&apos;s chopped beef was cold. The staff were very nice -- the food not so much. July 20, 2010 Really likes it Really good &apos;cue by TheKeef ( 74 reviews ) I recently moved from south OKC to north OKC and I miss my lil hideaways like Dale&apos;s. This place has great food, the bbq speaks for itself, it&apos;s never dry (at least I have never had any that was) and that&apos;s the sign of someone doing it right. The sides are all pretty good in my opinion, but really the cue is the star of the show here. If you are nearby and need dinner for the family, or just something for you, this is the place. January 8, 2012 Mobile review by Angi ( 2 reviews ) Quality has gone down hill!! The mashed potatoes taste like they are from a box, the mac and cheese isn&apos;t good, and the meat is usually dry or incredibly fatty. Dale is back, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be a good thing. May 29, 2011 Likes it Yum! by Keri ( 19 reviews ) Dale&apos;s has great bbq and a simple set up. You place and receive your order up at the front counter kind of like a fast food restaurant. It smells awesome from the second you walk in, and tastes even better. What I liked the most about Dale&apos;s is they cut the brisket right in front of me when I ordered it. Their ribs were really great that day. If you eat a lot of bbq, you know that ribs can be pretty hit or miss. The fried okra was good. The mac and cheese reminded me of the stuff you get at kfc--which I happen to love. The meat wasn&apos;t too fatty, and the portions were alright for the price. I&apos;d recommend it to anyone. February 16, 2009 Likes it by Jason ( 15 reviews ) this place has really good food, and a decent relish bar.  their mac and cheese is really good.   my only complaint is that they never have food ready.  if you want something, chances are that they have to go back in the back and put it in the fryer. February 12, 2010 Likes it this is good by lynn ( 13 reviews ) I really enjoyed the food . I will go back April 16, 2009 Likes it Mobile review by Robert Tuckey ( 2 reviews ) This place is great! The brisket is tender and juicy. Good service and great food. Only second to Leo&apos;s downtown. Family owned and operated, it&apos;s one of the best values in BBQ in Oklahoma. February 21, 2010 Really likes it you HAVE to try it by Terece ( 3 reviews ) The meat is GREAT they have so many choices; Sliced brisket, Chopped brisket , Pulled pork, Pork loin , Ham , Turkey, Smoked sausage, Polish links , hot links, Pork spare ribs. It&apos;s impossible to leave out their side&apos;s out they have anything you could think of, Baked beans, pinto beans, Ears of corn, mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, green beans,mac salad, potato salad, cole slaw. They also have Fried foods they are ALWAYS fresh so the take just a few minutes but they are worth the wait. It&apos;s inexpensive and you receive a great amount of food for what you pay! Dale&apos;s has been a great get together spot for friends, co-workers, and family alike! I will never go any where else! ( the location is only in okc now) February 22, 2009 Likes it Mobile review by Tyler Cawyer ( 2 reviews ) I worked at Dale&apos;s for a year and first I just want to say the level of customer service and attention to food prep and cleanliness is excellent, far better than other restaurants I have worked at before. The food itself is delicious, in my opinion far better than Van&apos;s or JR&apos;s BBQ (though i may be a bit biased). Down to the point, great food, cheap prices, and you will always walk out full and satisfied.
