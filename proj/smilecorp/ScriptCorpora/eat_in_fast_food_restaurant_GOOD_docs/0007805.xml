 Hiding Multiple Stalker Harassment

 Hiding Multiple Stalker Harassment
by Deborah S.
April 27, 2004
One of the most perplexing aspects of multiple stalker harassment is the ease with which it can be disguised so as to appear no crime has been committed. It is extremely difficult to explain this to people who have never been targetted by a stalking group. Here below are two very convincing examples provided by multi stalking target Deborah S. which we can all use when we are forced to justify our claims. Thank you, Deborah!

In multiple-party harassment, the offending actions of any one individual can became more and more subtle and difficult to name as specific incidents. Every one specific action is part of a coordinated whole.

The African-American high school student who goes to a racist all-white school might experience it this way: four students position themselves at points in the student&apos;s classroom route, each one uttering a syllable. One says, FUH, second says KING, next one says NI, next one says GRRR. Put together, these syllables say something very hurtful and destructive to that student.

In multiple-party harassment, the four may switch syllables, or they may have 40 white students taking turns each day saying these syllables over a two-week period. There is little that a principal or other investigator can do to discipline these students unless he is able to break the conspiracy, which may not happen. What is more likely is that it is the targeted student who will experience being disciplined - it is the targeted student who will lose control at some point, and unfortunately, that is the point that disciplinary action can be taken.

Let&apos;s say after three months of FU-KING-NI-GRRR he can&apos;t take it any longer and shoves the second guy. The principal asks him, &quot;What is it that he said that upset you so?&quot; The student tells him. The principal says, &quot;Wait - You&apos;re telling me you shoved him because he called you King???&quot; The student tells him &quot;No, no, there is more to it than that.&quot; The principal tells the student he has anger issues, is imagining things, and the student, who has endured three months of multiple-party racial slurs with no recourse, is then given detention or other disciplinary action on top of it for not being able to handle his anger.

So the injustice here is that a victim of racial hatred then becomes a victim of the inability to understand why this multi-party harassment was able to make him lose control.

Here is another example. Imagine a female college student who has been raped by a really popular male student. The male student wore a purple shirt on the night of their &quot;date.&quot; When the victim files charges, a lot of students express their support for the popular male by wearing purple shirts. They position themselves wherever she goes, by wearing the purple shirt. As a victim of a psychological trauma, the symbolism is not lost on her, and each time a purple-shirted student blocks her way or sits in front of her or follow her into the restroom she is reminded of her humiliation and violation. If it continues, she will either drop out or psychologically collapse. This is the power that the symbol has over her.

I think these G/S are mainly of low intelligence+morals,totally shot away spiritually,+easy pawns to be controlled+directed.Alot of what I experience is so school playground inspired,+their insults are not logical.If Im called a boring **** I reply so get a tv licence or with any luck I may bore you to death.Or I should say I used to reply in this way,now I realise the thing that upsets them most is also the best course of action,ignore them totally.They hate it.All that effort+nothing evident in its effects.

Poverty, starvation, war, etc. Haven&apos;t you worked it out yet ? there will always be, until you do your bit to stop them now. You should ask your religion or faith if Freemasonry is involved. If it is then question why. Write to management and make sure you get a reply. Or you can phone them, definitely record the call. If you do nothing, then the Masons win and continue to be..... UNDILUTED EVIL

I had 7 t-shirts printed,+5 sweatshirts printed,all with anti G/S slogans on +the G/S web site,encouraging people to view+see what is going on right under their eyes.I also went to court last year after keeping diaries on their actions,which the housing authorities blatently ignored,leaving me to handle it on my own.I dont see what getting religions are going to ban freemason connections,if theyu are already involved with them they are not going to stop.They will simply deny any dodgy dealings going on.It is wrong to think I do nothing,+Id like to do more,see my story,I simply dont understand this.We need organisation,together we are stronger than alone,but I have found TIs reluctant to chat regularly,afraid of spies.I think,although there is this danger,the dasnger of staying single in the fight is bigger.Im always willing to chat on this should you wish to mail me.Best wishes,pedro.

I agree Pedro.. They have been hurt thur mistrust...internet is full of fakers. Its hard to trust when it happens over and over again. It has happened to me., I let it go !!!.. i figure some real victim somewhere is reading and can benefit what info i offer. i try not to give dis info. I have been accused of that, brownshirt, etc. I laugh !!!.. victims have minds of there own. they can distinguish what is collected thought.. and ranting garbage..

Reminding churches what wrong they are doing, members might leave. some members are just not on the vibe of what there satanic minister is all about. U have to remember, these preachers are taught to be christian, thur masonry..if u get members to ask, it may become an issue ..right ??

I did not say u do nothing !!!., I simply hinted, IF u do nothing !. I only recommended notifying churches, i have handed out flyers
telling the church members to ask there preachers if any masons in the congragation.

There are a few of us that work 7 days a week. I do .. !! im always exposing.
They beef up there cop and fire patrols, I enjoy the show !!!...EMS running down the streets sirens blaring, flashers on. gee, i always liked fire trucks passing for no reason...going nowhere !!!
reminds me of 5 yr. old racing there little red trucks in there yards.. and the dirty coppers playing
cops and robbers !!!

 Personally, it has helped me to learn to do Spiritual Clearings thru the Christ Consciousness. These cowards/ abusers use Spiritism to disempower the victim TI. Improve your Spiritual Knowledge that will make you stronger. These 
cowards can not talk to your face. They are so messed up
and they want to throw their issues at you. They can not tell you
what they do not like about you in your face. They do not have the guts. They have to act always in group and thru Media or
behind your back. These people do not know the meaning of the word COMMUNICATION. They hide thru group mentality
or herd mentality to Libel and Slander the TIs. They do not have the needed Self-Esteem to talk to you the proper way.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT



The first term is “targeted individual” or “TI”, its commonly used acronym. It is hard to believe that any genuine victim of gang-stalking torture would refer to themselves as simply a “targeted individual.” That term is crafted by the one who targets, not the victim. A genuine victim rightfully perceives him or herself as an injured party; he has suffered injury due to a cruel injustice that includes psychological and physical torture. Like any victim of gross injustice and human rights abuses, they are due justice and recompense. The term “targeted individual” sanitizes the injustices committed in much the same way that the military term “collateral damage” devalues the lives of innocent victims of war. When I see the term “targeted individual” or “TI” in any online writing it immediately raises a red flag. It reeks of an impersonal military mindset toward a victim. It is the way a soldier views his enemy. It is too simplistic to describe the cruelty and injustice of a victim’s experience. It is an invention of the military minds behind these abuses, not its victims.

The second term I find suspect is “perp”, a colloquialism used to describe individuals engaged in gang-stalking of victims. This slang term has roots in law enforcement vocabulary. The root word, perpetrator, is commonly used by police and reporters in describing someone who commits a crime. It use in casual speech is not common among the general public. A genuine victim in time becomes aware of the covert government agencies behind his persecution and now become overt. . The term “perp” obscures this critical observation that a genuine victim would make. “Perp” cloaks the true origin of these abuses by suggesting that the abusers are common criminals. “Perp” is a lie. It is a part of the vocabulary of the hybrid military/law enforcement agencies behind these abuses and propaganda.

Can you imagine this being your life story? Your older brothers sell you into slavery as a final act of abusive hatred that started in your childhood. As a slave, you are falsely accused of attempted rape, and incarcerated. All told, despite your innocence, thirteen years of your life are spent as either a slave or prisoner. How would that experience affect you? Would it break your spirit? Would you spend your days planning an escape, brooding, seeking a way to retaliate against those who wronged you? Would a string of injustices that began in your childhood make you forever distrustful and incapable of love or happiness?

These are the true-life experiences of Joseph, whose account is found in the Bible book of Genesis. I found his life story a source of great inspiration for any today who may be victims of long term injustices such as directed energy weapons torture and forms of psychological warfare that include gang-stalking.

By the time he reached the age of 17, Joseph had a serious problem within his own family. His older brothers saw that Jacob, their father, “loved [Joseph] more than all his brothers.” Consequently, “they began to hate him, and they were not able to speak peacefully to him.” (Genesis 37:4) We can imagine the anxiety and stress that this situation caused Joseph. Eventually, the hatred of Joseph’s brothers became so intense that they sold him into slavery.—Genesis 37:26-33

While a slave in Egypt, Joseph had to resist the immoral advances of his master’s wife. Angry at being rejected, she falsely accused Joseph of trying to rape her. He was given “over to the prison house,” where “with fetters they afflicted his feet, into irons his soul came.” (Genesis 39:7-20) What a distressing outcome! For about 13 years, Joseph was either a slave or a prisoner because of injustices brought on him by others, including members of his own family.—Genesis 37:2; 41:46.

What is exemplary about Joseph is his refusal to be crippled by hatred and bitterness. How do we know that he resisted the tendency to become bitterly angry during his trials? Consider how he reacted when he did have an opportunity to take vengeance on his brothers who had come to Egypt to buy grain. The account says: “[Joseph] turned away from them and began to weep. . . . After that Joseph gave the command, and [his servants] went filling up [the brothers’] receptacles with grain. Also, they were to return the money of the men to each one’s individual sack and to give them provisions for the journey.” Later, when sending his brothers to bring their father to Egypt, Joseph encouraged them with the words: “Do not get exasperated at one another on the way.” In both word and deed, Joseph proved that he had not let bitterness and resentment poison his life.—Genesis 42:24, 25; 45:24.

Yes, instead of harboring self-destructive anger, Joseph took the opportunity to help his brothers when they were in need. He did not allow bitterness to destroy his good qualities. Can we learn a lesson from that?

Secondly, Joseph never allowed his circumstances to control his life. We can become so preoccupied with what we cannot do in a distressing circumstance, that we lose sight of what we can. While serving as a slave, Joseph worked diligently and distinguished himself. As a result, he was appointed as head of his master’s household. When he found himself in prison he again applied himself and was appointed to run the prison by the chief officer. His resourcefulness and hard work earned him a high ranking position in the Egyptian government upon his release.

Joseph made the best possible use of his resources in spite of his environment. He even earned the respect of individuals who would normally not have his best interests at heart! His unpleasant circumstances never robbed him of his civility and dignity.

Those who are unjustly victimized by programs of psychological warfare and covert torture can learn much from Joseph. There are things we face that we have no control over. However, there are areas of our life where we can make the best of our situation. Do not let bad circumstances determine the path your life takes! Realistically, we still must earn an income, and live our lives to the best of our ability. We must still be productive members of society and good neighbors. We must also learn to interact with those who target us for abuse in a civil way! Keeping a positive outlook on life, and focusing on the good we can do can protects our mental health and prevents self-destructive behavior.

Human microchips seen by some in Virginia House as device of antichrist
about this item.

By Fredrick Kunkle and Rosalind S. Helderman
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, February 10, 2010

RICHMOND, FEB. 9 -- The House of Delegates is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a bill that would protect Virginians from attempts by employers or insurance companies to implant microchips in their bodies against their will.
This Story

*
An issue of privacy or sign of the apocalypse?
*
Full text and status of Del. Mark L. Cole&apos;s anti-tracking-device bill

It might also save humanity from the antichrist, some supporters think.

Del. Mark L. Cole (R-Fredericksburg), the bill&apos;s sponsor, said that privacy issues are the chief concern behind his attempt to criminalize the involuntary implantation of microchips. But he also said he shared concerns that the devices could someday be used as the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; described in the Book of Revelation.

&quot;My understanding -- I&apos;m not a theologian -- but there&apos;s a prophecy in the Bible that says you&apos;ll have to receive a mark, or you can neither buy nor sell things in end times,&quot; Cole said. &quot;Some people think these computer chips might be that mark.&quot;

Cole said that the growing use of microchips could allow employers, insurers or the government to track people against their will and that implanting a foreign ob ject into a human being could also have adverse health effects.

&quot;I just think you should have the right to control your own body,&quot; Cole said.

The religious overtones have cast the debate into a realm that has made even some supporters uneasy and caused opponents to mock the bill for legislating the apocalypse.

Del. Robert H. Brink (D-Arlington) said on the House floor that he did not find many voters demanding microchip legislation when he was campaigning last fall: &quot;I didn&apos;t hear anything about the danger of asteroids striking the Earth, about the threat posed by giant alligators in our cities&apos; sewer systems or about the menace of forced implantation of microchips in human beings.&quot;

Microchips, which use radio frequency identification, have been used in pets to identify and track them. Proponents suggest that such chips could be invaluable in making people&apos;s medical records portable and secure and in helping to identify and find missing children. Others have urged they be used with Alzheimer&apos;s disease patients.

But the growing use of microchips has collided with the Book of Revelation. The biblical passage in question is in Chapter 13 and describes the rise of a satanic figure known as &quot;the Beast&quot;: &quot;He causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.&quot;

David Neff, editor of the magazine Christianity Today, said that some fundamentalist Christians believe that bar codes and implanted microchips could be used by a totalitarian government to control commerce -- a sign of the coming end of the world.

&quot;This is part of a larger attempt to constantly read current history in the light of the symbolic language of the Book of Revelation,&quot; he said.

----------------------------------------

ipcray@gmail.com

After my internet searches and some more angry but sensible emails with links and proof I sent to family last night, I have a small problem, but not a new one. I currently have a helicopter circling my home right now for the last 2+ hours that I know of. I have been followed by aircraft over the last 12 years as well as cars and so forth when I would allow it by driving reasonably. I was absolutely not follow-able on ground if I chose not to be, and they resorted to aircraft early on in my story once I became aware of the depth of their techniques and had reacted accordingly.

I believe I have dealt with all 3 main branches of Masons as I have understood them, the above board main group, black masonry or invisible masonry (the law behind the law, and even most likely satanic masonry that was hiding within a group of what must have been a rare breed of evil, or certainly, different masons. The details I have, which are legion, make up the difference in my situation.

I have not done a lot of searching on the internet in many years for details such as I have seen in your account because I was afraid they would show up as they have today. I gave up and have fought alone for recognition, freedom, and loved friends and associates affected in countless ways by their involvement in my life. I may have more information than anyone alive is what I feel like, but I hope that isn&apos;t true. I have been in an indirect war of what&apos;s right and wrong with these individuals for over 12 years. They have literally destroyed me through separation from family and friends, sadistic tactics, the original evil horrors that got me going in the first place, it goes on and on and on.

Lately, I have been thinking I must do what I can. I cannot get back into life. I literally don&apos;t want to live, though suicide cannot be an option for me as a true believer in God, a story for another day, but also part of this dilemma. There is no reason to make an email address anonymously with you like I was planning. I have been using anonymous browsing technology, etc. and have a helicopter circling the home after 1 night of getting serious and sending family some emails with pertinent links to desc riptions of activities I described the exact same details of so many years ago.

Do you know what I can do? I am sure I will be fr amed, &quot;accidentally die&quot;, slandered, whatever as they can&apos;t have their precious devil&apos;s army ****** with before its time. I am not so much scared as tired of dealing with them. They have caused me to lose respect for our government completely, not like yell at the tv. I am just not a violent or bad person. I am not perfect but my sins are more or less always against myself. I am very special about NOT ******* other people around and deadly honest, even if it hurts me.

They have absolute total control over my situation, really. I mean they are literally circling the ******* house in a very nice all white with blue stripe chopper. They have hovered the federal chopper over a lane of the highway with me surrounded by other vehicles as I go under it before so close I can see the rivets bending the metal of the heli as I go under it. They were ******* power playing me, which only infuriated me further given their sadistic actions up to that point. I have been followed approximately 33% of the hours and minutes of the last 12 years due to my reasons for staying involved against them and not complying with my perceived version of their unspoken wishes. I am tired and in great pain in every way. **** their wishes quite frankly. I hope you are on the up and up but I have my doubts. As I said, I have nothing to lose since they circle me as we speak, so I write to you from my normal email. **** it.

I have no idea how this act plays with victims, its all illegal with us anyway.. But Im sure will help many..


Ron,

We just scored a huge victory on the PATRIOT Act.

When we first took on this fight, everybody told us we didn&apos;t have a chance of winning. Even the other big activism groups had given up hope. For ten years, the PATRIOT Act had been renewed again and again without real fixes or serious debate. Why would this year be any different?

But thanks to you, it was. Instead of rubber-stamping the bill for another three years, as was originally proposed, the House and Senate have just agreed to hold real hearings on fixing the PATRIOT Act. Senate Majority Whip **** Durbin (D-IL), a longtime PATRIOT Act critic, has promised to craft and pass a bill that ends PATRIOT Act abuses. This is huge.

It&apos;s great news -- but we&apos;re going to need extra resources to keep this fight going. We&apos;d planned on this issue getting resolved one way or another by the end of February, but now that our activism has forced Congress to do a serious review of the PATRIOT Act, we need to make sure that Demand Progress&apos;s members have a voice in that process. There&apos;s a huge amount of urgent work to be done -- can you help us pay for it?

Demand Progress ...... google for there website

From the beginning, we&apos;ve never been funded by big foundations or wealthy donors. Instead, we&apos;ve had to raise all of our money from members like you. This has been liberating -- it&apos;s allowed us to tackle issues nobody else is working on, without having to worry about who we offend.

We&apos;ve had an amazing string of victories -- blocking the Internet censorship bill, preventing new legislation to outlaw WikiLeaks, and now stopping them from rubber-stamping the PATRIOT Act -- but we can&apos;t keep it going without your support.




Thanks for your support. This is all possible because of you.

============================================
For over fifteen years, the CIA, with assistance from numerous government agencies, conducted a massive illegal domestic covert operation called Operation CHAOS. It was one of the largest and most pervasive domestic surveillance programs in the history of this country. Throughout the duration of CHAOS, the CIA spied on thousands of U.S. citizens. The CIA went to great lengths to conceal this operation from the public while every president from Eisenhower to Nixon exploited CHAOS for his own political ends.&quot;

Keep in mind that the Maltese Cross is associated with both the Knights Templar and FIRE Departments WORLDWIDE, I do find the following associations interesting to say the least.
================================

The Badge of a firefighter is called a Maltese Cross. The Maltese Cross is a symbol of protection and a badge of honor. -- a cross similar to the one firefighters wear today. Since the Knights of St. John lived on a little island in the Mediterranean Sea named Malta, the cross came to be known as the Maltese Cross.


At the turn of the century, in the United States of America there existed no shortage of groups claiming to be Knightly fraternities of St John, owing their origins through Freemasonry, or through the Black Association, ancillary to the Orange Lodges, created for the preservation of a Protestant Ireland.



YES, FIREMAN DO STALK&gt;.And Are Freemasons...as dirty cops, judges....in the taxpayer trades

The FBI&apos;s Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative contains 161,948 files on people who have not been accused of any crime, but simply were targeted for reporting by local or federal authorities, or even just a neighbor or stranger. The files include employment history, financial documents, photos and more.

The article details how, &quot;Technologies and techniques honed for use on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have migrated into the hands of law enforcement agencies in America.&quot;

Blog.TruthBrigade.com: A Day in the Life of a Targetted Individual
A Day in the Life of a Targetted Individual
Originally posted Saturday, January 5, 2008

You have seen (or heard) me talk about cointelpro/organized stalking many times before.
Here I am going to post a bit of information about the perpetrators.
I know this is still too difficult for the average person to believe, but this is really going on much more than you could ever imagine.
If you don&apos;t believe me, please listen to this podcast where I interviewed someone who used to work with some high level perps.
Click here!
Unlike the Hollywood movies and fiction novels, you do not have to be a star or high public official to become a target. Sometimes it is revenge from a scorned lover, sometimes it is because of your political affiliation or activism. You could have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time, reported a crime, signed up to volunteer or maybe your own family member sold you out for a better government job...
Most of the time the victim will never know who the perps really are or who they work for.
They are cold callous individuals and trained to hurt people for pleasure.
They just take orders and feel no remorse for their crimes against humanity.
Be sure to visit this site!!!
stopcovertwar.com

All of the below comes from this site!

will mess with everything you do.
will mess up all your relationships.
will isolate you from everyone.
will mess with your communications.
will mess up your credit.
will mess with every job you get.
will mess with your business.
will sabotage your vehicle.
may try to cause you to have an auto accident.
will make you appear insane.
may even use drugs on you.
will discredit you.

The Perps will mess with everything you do.

It&apos;s their job. That&apos;s why they get paid. In order to justify their job
and their pay, they have to mess you up. Knowing this you should take
nothing for granted. For example, when you return to your workstation
after break, you must assume it has been sabotaged and double check
everything before starting up again. When entering a fast food
establishment, you may see perps standing back away from the counter,
as though their order has already been placed. They are just waiting for
you to step up to place your order so they can accuse you of breaking in
line. The list goes on.

The Perps will mess up all your relationships.

This means family, friends, acquaintances, and coworkers---no one will
help you, no one will be able to resist Perp treachery, no one will be
loyal to you. The Perps will lie, intimidate, and fabricate evidence until
everyone co-operates with their evil scheme to trash your life. Perps have
been known to claim to be investigating Targets for drugs, terrorism, etc.
Everyone you know will be forced to inform on you, and all information
gathered will be used to harass you in every possible way.

The Perps will isolate you from everyone.

This includes family, friends, and any new friends you meet. Again, the
Perps use lies, intimidation, and fake investigations to easily accomplish this.
After questioning your friends and family endlessly, the Perps let
them know that if they even mention the investigation, they can be jailed
for interfering with an ongoing investigation, and/or for aiding and
abetting a criminal. Then the Perps strongly suggest that they &quot;initiate
no further contact with you until the investigation is finished.&quot; Of
course, family and friends are not told that the investigation will never
be finished. Many Targeted Individuals have been &quot;investigated&quot; for
20 years or more, with no end in sight.

The Perps will mess with your communications.

All means of communication you use will be messed with. Phone
conversations are sometimes disconnected or rendered unintelligible.
Time sensitive snail mail and e-mail often arrives after the date of the
event, further contributing to isolation. E-mail is especially filtered so
that it arrives late or not at all. Unless you have a phone number to call
to verify e-mail actually was delivered, don&apos;t count on it. Perps can sit at
a computer anywhere on the planet and delete it with a touch of a button.
Often the e-mail will be held and read by the Perps before being sent on
to it&apos;s destination. The perps can dial a special code on their telephone key pad and hack in
to the central office of any phone company. Once this is done, it is easy
to connect their phone to yours and listen in on your conversations.
Thus, the perps know who your clients are and can turn this and other
sensitive information over to your competitors. Other codes allow the
perps to block phone calls to and from certain numbers or re-route calls
to or from other numbers. This can cause your business to fail as your
clients will not be able to contact you.

The Perps will mess up your credit.

Even if you pay your bills on time, the Perps can mess up your credit
through mail tampering and terrorist break-ins. Perps know where you
keep everything, including any new mail you collect from day to day. It
has been reported that the Perps will steal a selected bill from the pile of
mail on the kitchen table or wherever, so that the Target does not know
the bill has arrived, until a late notice is received. Many Targets report
mail missing after a terrorist break in of their car. Even when you mail
your payments on time, the Perps can make sure the payment arrives
late whenever they choose to do so.

The Perps will mess with every job you get.

This is why most Targeted Individuals are not working. Even if you are
able to find a job, the Perps will tell lies to your boss and co-workers so
as to gain co-operation for on the job harassment. Then your projects
will be sabotaged, your co-workers will pick fights with you, your good
work will go unrecognized, and eventually, you will be harassed right out
of the job. If you are being considered for a job that pays well, the Perps
will simply tell more lies to the boss so that you will not get that position.

The Perps will mess with your business.

Most Targeted Individuals are self employed and usually work alone. This
is because the Perps will mess with your employees so that they sabotage
the business or steal from you. Even if you should decide to do telephone
solicitation from home, the Perps can call the same people and mess that
up too. Remember, your phone is bugged, so they hear every deal you
try to make. The Perp is paid to make sure you receive no income.

The Perps will sabotage your vehicle.

The Perps have lots of fun with your vehicle. This can be done while you
are sleeping, shopping, visiting friends, and even when your vehicle is in
the repair shop. The perps have at least two methods of making sure
your vehicle will not start for as long as they want to keep you stranded.
With a push of a button, your transportation is disabled, usually while
they look on in veiled amusement. The real reason for the problem will
never be found by you or your mechanic. Targets have also reported
finding Jello in the transmission fluid, dirt in the oil, lights left on to
drain the battery, coolant drained out, and finding locked doors left
standing open. Targets report a drop off in incidents after installing a
camera over the driveway. Perps can still do a lot when you shop,
depending on where, when, and how long you shop. Many things can be
done while you are in the mall. Part of the Perp&apos;s job is to drain your
resources through endless auto repairs made out to look like
normal wear and tear.

The Perps may try to cause you to have an auto accident.

Some Survivors report the Perps deliberately caused a car wreck. One
particular Target was forced by police to go to a hospital, even though
her injuries were minor. Surgery was done and thereafter, she was
tormented 24 hours a day. Another Target reports that after sustaining
a serious injury in an auto accident, it took the doctor about two hours
to get to the hospital. She assumes he was being coached to do the bare
minimum, so that she was permanently impaired. Another target reports
24 hour harassment after having extensive dental work, after an injury.
All three targets believe the doctors installed implants. There have been increasing reports that traffic lights are being
manipulated in such a way as to
1) turn yellow just as the target approaches the light or
2) turn red and stay red longer so as to hold the target at the intersection.
Some survivors report that the yellow light has been used to write
citations. The red lights are used to delay the victim&apos;s progress until the perps
have time to set up vehicular street theater. This is especially true
of the traffic lights which govern the entrance to major highways. Some reports
indicate a perp vehicle, proceeding ahead of the targeted vehicle, appears to have
a device to change the traffic light to red as the perp lead vehicle passes under the
light, leaving the targeted vehicle stopped at the traffic light. Perp theater is thus
better organized further up the road or
at the target&apos;s final destination.

The Perps will make you appear insane.

The Perps plan for you is deliberately designed to make you appear paranoid.
Perps will enter your home, leave something out of place, steal
something, or leave something there which was not there before. This
is all part of the plan so that when you report this to the police, you look
like you just forgot, or your mind isn&apos;t &quot;quite right&quot;. This is a terrorist break in,
designed to make you look paranoid. Usually, when strangers
enter a home, Police expect to find valuables missing. When you report
the thieves stole a stick of butter and left the TV and VCR alone, the
police will conclude that you are a mental case.

The Perps may even use drugs on you.

The Perps delight in causing terror to the Targeted Individuals. Drugs
can be used from time to time to heap more misery on the Target. This
is most often accomplished by adding the drug to the target&apos;s food.
Some Targets have reported feeling very depressed or drowsy after eating
a hamburger from a fast food restaurant. Others reported the same symptoms
after being given a sandwich or piece of pie by someone they thought trustworthy.
Some Targets even report missing time. Accept the fact the Perps can get to anyone
and that anyone can be coerced, brainwashed, or bribed into co-operating with them.

The Perps will discredit you.

The Perps will lie and brainwash your family and friends to believe that
you have a mental problem. Telling your story becomes an exercise in futility,
and in fact is frequently used as an excuse to end friendships and break off
relationships. Realize that once the Perps have started their campaign of lies,
there can be no free and open discussion of what is happening to you. The Perps
do not allow this because it might induce others to come to your aid.
Realize that those near and dear to you have been programmed not to
believe what is happening to you. Many Targets report friends and
relatives change personalities and fly into uncharacteristic rage at even
the slightest attempt to discuss the truth of what is happening. Realize
that their desperate need to feel safe requires that they disbelieve you
and actually stop caring.

Now the good news...
Just joking

Moving does not help.
Most of our callers report that moving does not help. The Perps just
follow or new Perps are trained wherever you move. Some do report,
however; that the harassment does change for a while. Just be aware
that moving costs money, thereby draining your resources. Unless you
have friends where you intend to move, you become more isolated and
therefore more vulnerable. A small number of callers who live in a large
city, stay in a van and are mobile. These callers move several times a
night when Directed Energy Weapons are turned on them, and report
they get more sleep using this method than if they stay in one place for
the night.
Coping with mind rape.
Psychologist agree that when a person is attacked or traumatized it is not
healthy to &quot;hold it in,&quot; or deny what has happened. No healing can occur
by not discussing the crime, however; consider carefully who you tell about
what is happening to you. The Perps will lie and brainwash everyone to
believe you are a mental case. Targets report that it is a waste of time to
discuss the situation with anyone other than another Survivor. It may be
hard to find someone but these Survivors are on the internet and their
numbers are growing.

YOU are a Hero!
Realize that you are a HERO! Think about it! You have been ********
of everything: Job, money, spouse, family and friends. Perp lies and
sabotage prevent any chance of finding a new job or new friends. Most
soldiers on a battlefield at least can count on their buddies or military
supplies to help them through. But YOU......have NOTHING! As if that
were not bad enough, the perps have you so far out gunned with classified
technology that only the federal government agencies could find out who
or what methods are being used against you. But they are steadfastly
indifferent to your plight and will not help. Know that you are fighting
against overwhelming forces with little or no resources. Failure against
overwhelming odds is nothing to be ashamed of...rather be proud that
you fought valiantly and heroically. Therefore, even when you loose a
battle there is no reason for you to hang your head in shame.
No one else in your situation could have done any better than you have.
Put anyone else in your place and they will fare no better! You are still
alive and able to think! Do not give up! Hang in there! Do not despair!
There are some really dedicated people working on exposing these
atrocities. Get involved!

Targets only need to remember two basic rules:

1. Do NOT give the perps what they want!

The perps feed off your fear and despair. Terrorizing
innocent people is recreation for them. They want
you to continue to stay isolated. That makes their
job easier. There are no witnesses so their risk of
exposure is zero.

The perp harassment program is specifically designed
to make you look like a mental case. They have taken
time and effort to figure out which people will believe
what kind of lie. Many businesses, reputations, and
careers, have been destroyed by carefully orchestrated
lie campaigns.

The most popular lie is that you are under investigation
for prostitution, **********, or drug dealing. They will
pretend to be running an investigation on you to find out
everything they can use to hurt you later.

2. DO give the perps heaping helpings of
what they don&apos;t want.

There are ways to fight back that do not make you
look like a mental case. It helps to get a higher profile.
Become an activist or run for office. You will meet a
lot of folks and this will increase your visibility.
One target being stalked is a nut, two or more are
a political action group and can claim cointelpro is
stalking and harassing them. and chances are good
that perp activity around you will be noticed
(witnessed) by the public.

Keep a video camera with you at all times. Become
a public access producer if there is a station in your
community. Put hidden cameras in your residence.

If you decide to become an activists, go to as
many marches and rallies and pass out flyers.
(free to download on this site.)
If you are running for mayor or whatever,
talk to as many people as possible. Get their
opinion of what they want from their elected
official, then build your campaign around
that. Remember, it does not matter if you
win or loose, all you want is a higher profile,
a reason to talk to groups of people, thus
ending your isolation and animinity.

Below information is taken from http://multistalkervictims.org/

BASIC METHOD: The LIE is the cornerstone of organized stalking.

To establish organized stalking in a city or area, assemble a large GROUP dedicated to &quot;rid your community of undesirables.&quot; 100 people or so. Harass a selected target only with attacks that mimic &quot;life&apos;s normal breaks&quot;. That way, if the target complains, the target is regarded as mentally ill. Add in some sabotage and tell lies about the target, and you can destroy someone. It WORKS. ALWAYS. Having a GROUP do this is what makes it work, and allows the harassment to continue for the target&apos;s life. NETWORKING of these groups means the target canNOT escape by moving.

In effect, these networked stalking groups have established a &quot;parallel justice system,&quot; in which innocent people are not entitled to a defence. In fact, it seems as if this phenomenon may have started out as a justice system effort to &quot;get justice for&quot; people who &quot;should have gotten justice&quot; from the visible justice system but didn&apos;t for some reason. Being totally unaccountable to anyone, this &quot;parallel justice system&quot; began to &quot;get justice for&quot; people who were NOT criminals, but for some reason &quot;weren&apos;t liked&quot; by someone in power. Such a covert &quot;justice system&quot; is ideal for &quot;nuisance people&quot; like whistleblowers and activists too.

And by breaking up what is literally the crime of torture for the target among many people, each of whom only contributes an occasional &apos;nuisance&apos;, most of whom are unknown to the target, it is much more difficult to investigate and prosecute.

The perfect crime, so far.

In a nutshell:
It&apos;s just Psychological Terrorism!

Sometimes a bogus investigation
is being done which isolates the Targeted Individual from friends and family, who
are told by &quot;investigators&quot; to initiate no contact with the Targeted Individual unless
told to do so by the so-called investigators. A charge of &quot;giving aid and comfort to
a criminal&quot; will be lodged against those who do not comply! The constant crowding
of the Targeted Individual&apos;s space through non-random foot traffic and non-random
vehicular traffic will eventually take a toll on some individuals. Add to that
terroristic break-ins of home and car so that the Targeted Individual never feels safe!
Add to that the continual noise campaign so the Target almost never sleeps! Stress,
isolation, sleep deprivation, these things are done to the individual every day, creating
constant, ongoing stress. The goal being to cause mental and/or physical breakdown
of the Targeted Individual or death by suicide, disease, or accident. The so-called
investigators are never brought to justice, for they have truly committed the
perfect murder!
