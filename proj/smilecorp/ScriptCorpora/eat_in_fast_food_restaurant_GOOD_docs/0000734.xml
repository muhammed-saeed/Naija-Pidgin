 Michelle Macaluso 
When I was 14 I started working at a local“real”choose and cut Christmas Tree Farm. Making $5.25 and hour. It was a great job only doing it on the weekends and then somedays after school. I did that till I was 18, was a great job. That really got you in the spirit of the holidays.
 Denise Savoie 
My first job was bagging groceries. I got paid $1.96 an hour plus tips!

 Steve B 
My first job was delivering morning newspapers for the Manchester NH Union Leader. I had a route of about 20 papers to deliver and made about $3.00 per week, including tips. That was pretty good for a kid in the 50′s.
 Nicholas Molenaar 
In fifth grade I had a paper route delivery the Red Wing Minnesota, Daily Republican Eagle news paper to about 35 households. I had my own money to save or spend. It was a glorious time.

My first“official”jobe apart from working with my dad was when I turned 14. I became the classic teenage McDonalds worker. I made $6.15 an hour.
 Tim Althouse 
I worked at Chick-fil-A at the Fairgrounds Mall in Reading, PA. I had just turned 16. Loved the Sundays off. I earned minimum wage at the time: $4.25/hr.
 Assata 
I got my first job at Rickel Home Center in Watchung, New Jersey, at age 14. I was a part-time cashier after school and on weekends. I started off at $3.75 an hour, and when I left, I was at $6.10 an hour. I loved that I was making my own money and getting the experience of working.
 DjM 
My first job–at age 14–was working as a soda jerk in my family’s ice cream parlor. As I recall, I earned $1.25 per hour plus all the ice cream I could eat. As I was just starting to date girls, I was a hit because I had a key to the store and after a late night movie, would open up and prepare anything my date wanted from an ice cream soda to a banana split. Oh, and the store featured 36 flavors of ice cream so there was no end to the variety. We were allowed to eat as much as we wanted because as sure as shooting, we grew tired of too much of a good thing fast. It was took me years after that experience to regain my taste for ice cream!
 Charlotte Cody 
My first job was after school when I was a high school junior, then full time all that summer, in a shoe factory earning $1.25 an hour (the minimum wage in 1966). I never missed a day’s work until the last week of August, when I asked to have a few days off before Labor Day to go to Cape Cod. I was summarily fired! But it was nice having spending money for the summer.
 http://www.facebook.com/people/Michelle-Young/100002602102371 Michelle Young 
When I was ter finishing 17 in 1990, I got my first job in working at sizzler in the summer after finishing school. My wage was a grand $4.32 an hour, woohoo!
 Eric Johnston 
Software developer for a job placement company. I was 15 at the time (barely old enough to legally have a job) and it was the summer before my second year of college. My main objective was to slow the rapid rate at which I was burning through the money my parents had saved for my education (the fact I started early obviously didn’t help).

The project was to develop a database that had a table of skills, some tables for job seeker information, a table for positions, and junction tables to tie them all together (job seekers to skills, open positions to skills, which positions a job seeker had applied to, etc). With this database they could match positions and candidates as they came in.

It was just a summer job, but at $10 an hour I saved enough to pay my tuition until the following summer, so it worked out pretty well…

My first job was at a nursing home back in 198 making $3.75 per hour.

 http://www.facebook.com/people/Tha-Nate/592898867 Tha Nate 
I got an electronic pencil sharpener from a tyre company because my parents run a small tyre retail service shop. I brought it to school and many of my friends want to use it to. I started charging 1 Baht (like 1 cent) for each pencil. That was when I was in grade 1 or grade 2.
 Cassandra P. 
My first job was working as an assistant in the Undergraduate Admissions Office at my University. I was paid 5.90 an hour! Thank God minimum wage has increased.
 Margarette Connor 
My first job I was 12. I was a“mother’s helper”(but really a babysitter since the mom was at work) for three kids under 6, one of whom was a baby in diapers. I worked all day Saturday and Sunday, doing lunch and dinner for them, too. For 25 cents an hour. It was 1973. Slave wages even then!
 http://Facebook.com Kari Allen 
I picked raspberries and made $1.00 per pint. I ate a good portion of the fruit while working, but had fun picking. Raspberries are SO good.
 Thomas J George 
I started delivering 75 daily and 105 Sunday papers at age 11. I used my bicycle in the summer and walked the rest of the time. The paper was published seven days a week and I had to get up at 4:00 AM to get the papers delivered before school. I went to each of my customers once a week in the evening to collect the weekly charge for the paper. Every Saturday my Mom took me downtown to pay the paper company for the papers and the rest was my profit. I made the grand sum of $10.00 per week.
 Leo 
My first job was at the Disneyland resort as a special events coordinator for the fireworks shows. All I did was direct traffic along the routes of the park during the events. I was 18 and going to college. I made $9.00 an hour, but had a lot of fun doing it.
 Christopher Miranda 
First job was at Ralphs Grocery Co., when I was 16. I Earned 7.50 an hour!

 Jonathan Kawamura 
My first job was delivering newspapers and scooping ice cream at Baskin Robbins Ice Cream for $2.20/hr.
 Jesse 
I wanted money for playing cards and other fun stuff so I got a paper route, it was early in the morning and did not have someone to drive me around. I think I was making like $20 a week. Although I did end up tying my dad’s golf rack to the back of my bike stacked with papers and made it a lot easier, until they kept falling off 
 http://www.facebook.com/people/Jason-Mitchell-Erbesfield/22600088 Jason Mitchell Erbesfield 
My first job was working at a local hardware store. I had to help customers, run the register, bring the rental equipment in and out every day, and do everything from cleaning the store to the nasty, little restroom in the back to keeping people from stealing stuff. I was there almost 8 years though college and high school and was offered a management position but I declined it because I decided to move on and keep going to school. But, if it wasn’t for that very first job, I’d never be where I am today!
 http://www.andrewaskew.com Andrew Askew 
My first job was right out of high school. I worked as a Campus Aide/Security Guard at another high school. While the job was simple, it was hard for kids to take me seriously given I was not much older than them. I had to learn to ignore their insults and make them see I was an authority figure. To make my time working there more interesting, it was at a continuation high school.
 Carol L 
I was 15 working as a cashier at Orange Julius/Dairy Queen in a mall. My 1st job lasted 3 years with staring salary of $4.25 an hour.
 http://www.facebook.com/people/Sergius-Paulus/100000286862756 Sergius Paulus 
I was 11. Picked peaches. I got paid all the peaches I could eat. I must have done pretty good. I got hired the next year throwing hay that had been baled up on the back of a trailer towed by a farm tractor for $5 a day. Made enough money to buy a calf and fed the old girl until she grew up and I learned how to milk her. Sold the cow and made enough to open my very first savings account. Did odd jobs like cleaning school buses and saved enough money to buy my first vehicle: A blue 1958 Ford Pickup with a steel bed. I wish I had never got rid of that old truck
 http://www.facebook.com/people/Harmony-Halley/734579918 Harmony Halley 
My first job was at Baskin Robbins in Eagle Rock California. I made $5.15 an hour. I worked a couple days a week after school. The biggest perk was that I was allowed to leave school a period early because of the work study program.
