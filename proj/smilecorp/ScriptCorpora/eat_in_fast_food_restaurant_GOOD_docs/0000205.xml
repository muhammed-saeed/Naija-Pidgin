When you buy a drink at a fast food restaurant, the most expensive thing you buy is the cup. Offering free refills costs hardly anything to the business.

I would just like to add that I used to run a&quot;Jimmy Johns&quot;(It was a very dark time of my life) and what mallio said is very true. Large soda like $1.70 and it maybe cost us 20 cents.

Adding on that with a similar&quot;Taco Bell&quot;situation - It took roughly two medium soda sales to break even on all soda sales for the rest of the day. So after Taco Bell sells two medium drinks, every drink they sell after that is 100% profit.

The cup sizes are getting ridiculous. It looks like most places eliminated the normal&quot;medium&quot;size. Nobody chooses the small because it&apos;s too damn small and the medium size magically turned into a large. Damn you fast-food restaurants!

Well if you think about it, they know most people are going to get a refill anyways, and the most expensive part of the drink is the cup. So to maximize volume while keeping the cost of the cup down, all you need to do is increase the radius of the cup (or the height, but that&apos;s less effective).

So it kind of makes sense that the cups are huge, and way wider than you&apos;d think they should be.

It is for this reason that I never understood why people would buy anything but a small. The dispenser is like 10 feet away. Takes me 5 seconds to fill back up. Why would I buy a large? Even better, when I order with my girlfriend, we still get 1 small. Share it and refill. Why waste the money on another cup?

There isn&apos;t as much profit as you think in selling soda. As employees, you&apos;re disconnected from a lot of associated costs that have to be factored in. Usually the soda company provides the dispenser, and sometimes that dispenser comes with an ice maker, but some restaurants purchase their own dispensers, and some purchase their own ice machine. Each can easily cost over $5,000.00. Then there&apos;s CO2, labor, utilities, lease, etc. Unless you have a very high volume restaurant, or multiple locations, the restaurant business isn&apos;t that profitable. You&apos;d do better taking a government job.

One benefit of free refills to a restaurant that has self serve soda, is they can eliminate at least 1 employee, which can be a very significant amount of money, especially when you factor in total cost of an employee, not just their hourly wage.

Very high volume restaurant
 
The McDonalds I worked at had over 2,500 orders a day. At the window .

That&apos;s not counting the walk-ins.

I remember one night, working all night, a bunch of douches from the nearby highschool drove thru,&quot;Dude, why do you work here?&quot;

I didnt even hear them speak. I was just dead inside .

Office work and McDonalds work, two mindless activities that make me beg for death.

Edit to be a little more relevant: Even factoring in much of that, the main expense is startup.

I would be much happier with restaurants they gave free drinks, the annoyance of how expensive they are is extreme.

If you&apos;re unit was open 24 hours, and I doubt that, but let&apos;s just use that as an example, that&apos;s nearly one customer every 30 seconds. Not likely.

We had an average serve time of 15 seconds.

but that didn&apos;t matter to HQ.

At one window? It takes longer than that to order. It takes longer than that to collect the money or swipe a card. 15 seconds per car means if there are 8 cars in front of me, I&apos;ll be on my way with my food in 2 minutes.

They could have the whole thing in parallel with 5 windows to order at and 5 windows to pay at. Then each window could take 75 seconds.

What you&apos;re missing is that fast food exists to sell soda. The food is pretty much at cost (factoring in overhead like employees), and exists to get you to come and pay $1-2 for a soda.

The food costs at very high volumes are less than you think. The highest price I paid for 30lb boxes of french fries, was $14.00. For me a 5 gallon bag-in-the-box Coca Cola was $44.90. (2006 prices)

Now with those anecdotes, keep in mind that I was 1 unit. Large chains pay significantly less. The highest costs for burgers is the patties, and the highest price I paid was $1.75 per pound. 20lb boxes of tomatoes were usually the second highest cost for me, and they fluctuated from $8.00 to $20.00 per 20lb case. The costs of everything else were insignificant compared to the above.

Again, I was only 1 unit, and high volume brings companies falling all over each other to get your business. Volume is everything, because economy of scale is everything. You can bet that large chains payed significantly less than I did for everything , but I&apos;d say soda got them the least savings for volume sales. In the states there are only 2 major players vying for the restaurant business, Coca Cola, and Pepsi.

The ratio is 5:1, so 25 gallons. My ice machine cost me $6,000 15 years ago, and it required service fairly often. It draws a lot of current, too. My price for CO2 was $21.50 per 50lb tank.

I have bought at least a dozen sticks of Carmex. I think I reached the bottom of 1 or 2. I now own 3 of them - 1 at home, 1 at work, 1 in the car. I find the less I have to move the sticks around, the less I lose them.

Given the right owners the job could actually be a lost of fun and pretty profitable. I was unfortunate enough to work for a couple of newbie asshole and sorta sick owners that just ran anyone that actually was a good worker into the dirt. Meaning well or not they sucked as shop owners.

I was a restaurant manager for a while (yeah, it sucked). The 5 gallon boxes of syrup cost 40 or so dollars each. At 5-1 mix ratio, we got 30 gallons of mixed soda from each. If my math is correct, that&apos;s 3840 ounces of mixed drink. Each 22 ounce glass held about 13 ounces of soda (fill it with ice of course.)This results in somewhere around 300 glasses of soda per 40 dollar box. That works out to about 13 cents a glass, not including CO2 costs, which were minimal.

We charged each person 2.29 a soda.

[edit] refills were free.

You have a fair amount of research here. Thanks for the input!

My subsequent question; how much did it cost to run the restaurant (labor, etc.), and more importantly, how much of your costs were covered by the sale of soda? Without it, could the restaurant survive? Was the net profit substantial?

Thanks again. :)

That depended on a lot of things.

I worked for a huge corporation.

Costs were generally as follows:

Food 20-22% of food sales
Liquor/beer/wine 17-19%of LBW sales

Labor: kitchen typically was about 12-15%
FOH (Wait/host/bus) about 7-8%

Management labor varied, depended on staffing and seniority, but was in the ballpark of 10%

Repair/Maint budget could be whacked by one big bill but was typically in the area of 5%.

Other expenses (office supplies/restaurant supplies/etc) tallied up, IIRC, about another 10%.

Some companies figured in&quot;below the line&quot;expenses at unit level (taxes, rent, etc -- things the unit manager cannot control) and some do not -- depends on the company.

Typical unit profit for a chain casual craphole restaurant is about 20-25%. Final, below the line profit is usually quite a bit less.

Of course, the company makes it&apos;s money paying things over time and investing the sales dollars -- restaurants work much like grocery stores in that they are usually little more than a vehicle for generating investment capital. If they&apos;re profitable at the unit level, more&apos;s the better.

As to the soda/profit question, well, hard to say. Where the cash come from is highly variable -- depends on sales mix and a million other things. Some locations sell no sodas (all booze) and are quite profitable. Some sell no booze and lots of soda but still make cash. So many other variables are at play here.

Hope that makes at least a little sense.

Yeah it does, and your answer is far more than I had hoped. :)

Sounds like the point is that a great portion of your margin comes from the markup in drinks. I have another theory about desserts, but that&apos;s another issue. Thanks for the eye-opening details!

I hate ice.

1) It takes up valuable room in the cup that could have delicious [purple] drank in there.

2) It waters the shit out of anything you get. I like coke. I do not like watery/flat/shitty coke.

3) The beverage that comes out of the fountain is always cold anyway. Ice just makes it stay cold for a little longer. I drink my drink. I don&apos;t save it for dinner.

I used to be a no-ice person for all the reasons you cite. However, melting ice is really interesting. When you get a cup of soda without ice, it is immediately heading for room temperature.

However, when you have ice in there, so long as there&apos;s a significant quantity of ice, the drink is going to be 0C.

If it&apos;s warm where you&apos;re drinking, or you&apos;re going to be nursing it for a while, ice makes sense.

Agreed. ESPECIALLY styrofoam cups. That shit is not gonna warm up on your for like, three hours. If youre keeping your soda that long, drink faster or order a smaller drink.

Pro Tip - A 20 oz drink with no Ice is as much soda (just about) as a 32 oz drink with ice.

This is what always pissed me off about ChickFilA. They fill the whole cup with ice and you end up with half the drink that you would have received at a sane restaurant. It made no sense to me since I always figured ice cost more than the pop plus the extra labor because they had to refill the cups 3 times as often (no self serve).

I like coke too, but the other night I was in a restaurant and ordered a Coke with Grenadine and Lime. I took a sip and had what felt like a million air bubbles try to resurface. Within a few seconds, it turned into a massive air bubble. I felt it coming up, looked at my SO and said,&quot;If I pass out, don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;He said my body stated spinning in the chair, I went stiff and fell out of the chair. I have had this happen to me 4 times in my life. I really should stop drinking the stuff.

Having worked for 3 years in the soft drinks industry I can give you a rough break-down of the cost to produce a 2 liter soda bottle.

Direct costs:
1-2c for the concentrate, 1-2c for the label, 2-3c for the bottle, under 1c for the water, 4c to ship it

Indirect costs (wages, rents, IP, investments, financial costs, etc.) - say about 5-6c.

All in all you&apos;re under 20c in costs and you sell it for say 30c to the supermarket. No astronomical profits, but comfortable nevertheless.

Having a client who runs a grocery store / restaurant -- who I&apos;ve written price management&quot;software&quot;for -- I can assure you that most stores aren&apos;t making the kind of profit you think they are.

I don&apos;t know how it is for, say, Safeway, but smaller stores buy from distributors, and the distributors have their own markup. Stores also have to deal with shrink, rent, wages, insurance, and really really really insane I.T. costs.

For example, the rinky-dink 486-based register that a bunch of stores run? Would you believe that those setups can easily run up to $5,000 per register ? Or that the double-damned piece of crap NCR key terminals are a couple grand a pop? Or that their digital scales are all in the many hundreds of dollars second-hand ?

Hopefully, you never have to call Hobart, those guys just looooove money. And if your refrigeration breaks down, you can kiss last month&apos;s profit goodbye.

Like my client says, it takes a bunch of cans of soup to pay for this week&apos;s broken equipment.

Curious - why hasn&apos;t someone stepped in and eaten Hobart&apos;s lunch?

I mean, you can sell a desktop or laptop for $500 that can handle the tasks needed, $100 for scanners, $100 for the Point of Sale software, $500 for the store-wide management console that talks to all of the machines via wireless, and set up the whole thing for $2000 labor. Total cost: $2500 fixed, $1000 per register.

I&apos;m GROSSLY oversimplifying, but for a system that is replicated across the entire nation, you&apos;d think someone could make a lot of money halving those costs.

I&apos;ve toyed with doing this -- I&apos;ve been hovering around the IT of grocery stores and restaurants for a few years, and before that, the horrible inventory and POS systems of some retail.

There are some challenges to be solved -- for example, handling all the various tax and tare laws of each state and region -- but the industry definitely is ripe for plunder.

The thing to do would be to reverse-engineer the protocols used by the back-office and POS systems, and then put together a register package that supports the other vendors&apos;protocols. Sell that -- and the stores will love you for it -- and then use the revenue from that to fund R&amp;D on your own complete POS system. When you&apos;re ready to go with that, if you&apos;re smart, you&apos;ve got a huge list of customers that are interested in it because they&apos;ve already been buying your stuff.

And just to sweeten the deal, let me describe the current landscape of things: a store with 2 to 3 registers and a&quot;modern&quot;, bare-bones POS with basic end-of-day reporting, cash handling, receipt printing, and sales movement functions, can expect to pay $10,000 and up -- way up, I&apos;ve heard as high as $50,000 -- for their basic IT installation.

And they do pay it.

What they get in return is software that was designed in 1999 and doesn&apos;t understand SQL.

So, yeah. Go get rich, if you wanna beat me to it.

I have a few contacts in various parts of the industry -- including one other company that would be interested in a solid competing product.

But I&apos;d be crap at all that. I&apos;m more of an engineer than a salesman.

I&apos;ve already reverse-engineered most of ScanMaster&apos;s systems -- it wasn&apos;t hard, they use a shared drive in Windows of all silly things -- and written server software for the Symbol PTC-960SL handheld units, which are somewhat popular (but aging).

So, I know a pretty solid chunk of this market, but unfortunately couldn&apos;t bring much in the way of sales or marketing skills to the table.

If we wanted to get serious about it though, I&apos;m pretty sure I could come up with someone. I&apos;m on news.yc too.

Desktop/laptop might not be heavy duty enough.

R&amp;D for the software, custom configuration and installation costs will eat into your profits, as well.

Next, you gotta sell it... It&apos;s not so easy to convince someone to replace something that works for an unproven product.

But yeah, I think it&apos;s a viable business model - in fact, I&apos;ve seen some Chinese and Korean supermarkets here using PCs.

I don&apos;t think so, bottled tea is still made from concentrates, with flavors and preservatives and some sort of sugar. I&apos;ve seen bottled tea made with some exotic ingredients, packaged in a glass bottle with a full size&apos;sock&apos;plastic label around it that was twice the price of all the sodas on the shelf (at the airport). It&apos;s fucking hilarious that they marketed it as&apos;health drink&apos;too, it was loaded with sugars. They were also sort of catering to the&apos;green&apos;crowd, it was green tea with a green label, etc. It was also manufactured in the US with ingredients from China then shipped to an airport in Amsterdam for me to drink it so it was anything but green. I had to buy it just to study it, the ingredient list was just scary long.

&quot;The concentrate&apos;s main ingredient? Caramel.&quot;

Sound to me like they aren&apos;t including sugar/corn syrup when they refer to&quot;concentrate&quot;, because then that would be the main ingredient. This ends up being a huge part of the cost (still nothing compared to what they charge, of course):

A bushel of corn produces about 33 pounds of corn syrup, which is about 80% sugar. This is the sugar content of about 300 cans of coke. At 7 dollars a bushel, this adds about 1,200 dollars to the cost of 50,000 cokes.

Coke only adds the flavor to their concentrate...its up to the bottler to add the sweetener and soda water. This is why Coke in other countries is made with Sugar when we get f-ed with the HFCS. The bottlers there use sugar instead.

Not buying that 2.60 dollar figure. 50,000 cokes requires 2 tons of HFCS. Thats two fucking tons of sugar. No way that costs 2.60 cents. And that isn&apos;t counting labor, water and flavoring.

The syrup made by Coke central doesn&apos;t include the sweetener. The sugar/hfcs is added locally. God, country and Coca-Cola is a fascinating book about the company&apos;s history. It also explains why the bottling companies are separate from Coke itself - an amusing tale of Coke selling all the bottling rights early last century as they believed people would only want to continue getting their drinks from soda fountains in stores.

Headline is wrong, then.&quot;Syrup&quot;implies sweetener;&quot;simple syrup&quot;is just water and sugar.

Even then, I&apos;d be skeptical that the flavoring for 50,000 cokes only has a total cost of $2.60. Although I&apos;m sure Coke has figured ways of substituting more cheaply, the recipe for cola, excluding sweetener, for 50,000 cans would require ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_formula - recipe for 10 gallons = 106 cans = 468x the Pemberton recipe):

14 liters of vanilla extract

33 kg of&quot;flavoring&quot;(various oils)

I&apos;m sure Coke is still using some version of vanilla extract, I&apos;m sure it&apos;s artificial, and I&apos;m sure they get it as cheaply as possible, but I find it hard to believe that they can get the equivalent of 14 liters of artificial vanilla extract for 1/200th of what you pay at a grocery store.

edit: As a reference point, according to this , the price of raw iron ore is currently $61US per (presumably metric) ton, or $1 for 16kg. I doubt the ingredients in Coke flavoring are cheaper than unprocessed iron ore.

2 bits on vanillin that are particularly interesting
 
Later it was synthesized from lignin-containing&quot;brown liquor&quot;, a byproduct of the sulfite process for making wood pulp.

In October 2007 Mayu Yamamoto of the International Medical Center of Japan won an Ig Nobel prize for developing a way to extract vanillin from cow dung.

That&apos;s cool. I believe there is a pretty decent microbial (fermentation) process for making vanillin now, so before long it will be a&quot;natural flavor&quot;and not an&quot;artificial&quot;one on the ingredients label.

Actually just selling the syrup and bottling rights is pure genius from a business standpoint. They are not bothered by fluctuating prices in sweeteners and plastic and they don&apos;t have the equipment/property overhead to boot.

I&apos;d recommend reading the book to see just how bad an idea it turned out to be. Coke has bought back about 50% of the rights. Look carefully at each can/bottle and you should see something about how it is bottled by Coke or by the Coke Bottling Authority (ie a bottling franchise).

From a business standpoint the deal was really bad since they just sold perpetual worldwide bottling rights for a fixed price. That didn&apos;t take into account inflation, didn&apos;t let Coke change the price of the concentrate/syrup and gave Coke no control over what ended up being the way almost all their end customers actually consumed the product. After various court cases there was a renegotiation of the terms which improved things for Coke.

Dude - you&apos;re right - I think they are talking about the TAXES on that syrup used to make the 50,000 servings of coke. This article is a piece of dog shit. They must be referring to the Taxes in Ireland.

I guess this is just a book review, but it seems so poorly written that I wouldn&apos;t expect it in a published news magazine.

The way the final paragraph is written, I think the $2.60 is simply some accounting trick to move as much profit into Ireland as possible.

Sorry but no.

The main ingredient of the syrup is sugar (or in moronic countries which subsidise corn growing, the despicable HFCS) and I&apos;m sorry, but 15 teaspoons of sugar goes into each glass of Coke, so that means 50,000 x 15 teaspoons of sugar.

No way is sugar (or HFCS) is that cheap.

HFCS costs $0.3151 per pound dry, according to this . A can has 40.5 grams, so 50,000 cans amounts to 4,500 lbs. At 31.51 cents per pound, that&apos;s $1,400 dollars per 50,000 cans. So yeah, pretty much bullshit, unless the HFCS in wonderful Ireland is literally 0.2% as expensive.

it&apos;s a type of sugar, yes... but it&apos;s not beet sugar or cane sugar. plus due to the subsidized farming in the US, corn is a lot cheaper... so even though it only costs coca-cola $2.60 to make concentrate for 50,000 drinks... it probably costs $2.61 to make it with sugar...

I&apos;d prefer stevia but that&apos;ll never happen.

As another comment pointed out, the syrup doesn&apos;t contain sweetener.

And I agree that we shouldn&apos;t subsidize corn. However, most people seem to think that sucrose is somehow better for your health than HFCS.

oh, no, all of it will turn you into a lard ass... but sugar from cane or beets tastes a lot better (in my opinion) and stevia is even better than those two...

there are rumors of HFCS making you a retard or giving you alzheimer&apos;s but I&apos;m not a scientist so I won&apos;t even comment on that.

so it&apos;s mostly that I hate subsidized corn and I hate how corn syrup tastes. and I hate that coca-cola rips people off... but oh well.

The HFCS rumors I&apos;ve always found laughable, but isn&apos;t the issue more that HFCS is in every single thing we eat, that in turn starts to cause health problems? All things in moderation...

I agree, real sugar just tastes much better. I&apos;ve never had stevia before, let alone heard of it.

stevia is bigger in south america.

it grows like a weed and it tastes a lot sweeter than sugar with a lot less calories, but because of the sugar and corn subsidies in the US, we&apos;ll probably never see it used in mass quantities.

Hey, omyop, the price isn&apos;t for the syrup, silly, it&apos;s for the flavoring . Do you really think that enough sugar to make 50,000 sodas only costs $2.60?

The big ripoff is diet drinks. Regular sodas at least have sugar, and believe it or not, sugar is an important nutrient. It&apos;s the basic fuel of life. You need trace nutrients, but you&apos;re not going anywhere without proteins, fats, or sugar.

This has to be bullshit because: 39 grams of sugar per can, times 50,000 = 1950 Kilo Grams of sugar. Sugar can be burned, just like coal or oil. If that $2.60 was true, you could power your car for 100K miles, or heat your house for a whole year for less than $2.60. Sugar costs about $200 per metric ton.

Except high fructose corn syrup tricks your body into thinking it is in starvation mode causing your metabolism to change and therefore process food differently. This has been proven in journals and Arthur Daniels Mindland, which controls all corn products, has done everything to silence.

I have never drunk Coke or Pepsi; nor any other cola. It&apos;s dominance is a complete mystery to me. As is this thread. Take some tea leaves, steep in boiling water for a couple of minutes; drain into a cup, add milk (skimmed for preference) and you have a nice cup of tea. It&apos;s what the Queen drinks. And no, it doesn&apos;t have sugar, aspartamine, or even corn syrup added.

Coke often doesn&apos;t make its own Coke. It relies on a vast web of subcontractors, bottlers and distributors. Most have loose or no ties to the company, and are in countries where workplace laws are underdeveloped at best.
 
This is fairly common in many industries.. coffee is a great example of this. Unfortunately there&apos;s not much Coke can do - they&apos;re liable to make as much money as humanly possible. Blame the subcontractors and local governments, not Coke.

Being the hugest and richest doesn&apos;t make you the best person in the world. It shouldn&apos;t work like this for corporations either.

You probably mean one of the better corporations, not the best, as that implies there is no corporation in existence that is better than Coke. And I seriously doubt that. And you mean better in the sense of profitability and strength, but I am sure there are many aspects of Coke which are not so great.

Gah, I sound like an English teacher making notes on a student&apos;s essay. Sorry about that.

And a new kidney. (Phosphoric acid in cola is not healthy.)

I imagine the massive amount of calories is much worse. Our bodies have digestion pathways in place to digest phosphoric acid, just like the (stronger) citric acid that is in oranges etc.

This has long be debunked. http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/acid.asp

Sorry, but nobody should go to snopes for health advice.

&quot;In a study published in the journal Epidemiology, the team compared the dietary habits of 465 people with chronic kidney disease and 467 healthy people. After controlling for various factors, the team found that drinking two or more colas a day — whether artificially sweetened or regular — was linked to a twofold risk of chronic kidney disease .&quot;

Twofold risk compared to what? It still seems uncommon, thinking of all those who happily indulge liters of cola per week. We have entire generations of them.

 Supply and demand . Please, people, understand supply and demand. People are WILLING to pay this amount for sodas, and so that is the price. It doesn&apos;t matter if the companies make a huge profit off every soda sold because their resources are so insanely cheap. The minute you begin to feel like you have a RIGHT to cheap products just because a company can produce them cheaply, you have given in to a socialistic mindset.

It&apos;s not like the stuff is even expensive anyway. You can buy it in 12 packs at the supermarket for $0.33 a 12oz can usually, which really does make it one of the cheapest substances on earth you can buy besides gas. The vast majority of cost comes from packaging, transportation and sales/display. And advertising too, of course.

Not necessarily. There are several ways within a capitalist system to drive down the price of a good.

 Widely publicize the cost of making soft drinks. The idea here isn&apos;t make drinkers disgruntled (directly) but to let resellers and the retail channel know they can apply more pressure in price negotiations. (Wal-Mart already does this; they seem to have the lowest cost for soft drinks in the market I&apos;m in.) Enter into the market yourself, since the cost to make are so low, even taking into account some of the startup costs. (Given how most of the big brands bottle locally; it&apos;s probably easy to find unused or&quot;obsolete&quot;equipment to start up your own.) To compensate for the marketing muscle the big manufacturers have, starts as a regional and take advantage of local pride or sentiment in your marketing. Or do some kind of product differentiation. (Smaller makers like Faygo or RC take this approach) Drive down demand directly by counter-marketing. This does tend to get shady and controversial at times though. (I think the HFCS bashing is less about nutritional advocacy and more about importer trying to remove some of the regulations over sugar. I also wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the dairy and fruit juice industries aren&apos;t engaging in some pressure of their own.) 

None of the above involves the government regulation of or pressuring lawmakers to&quot;rent control&quot;the original product... It&apos;s all about the public reputation of a company.

No --- you (DLWormwood) are talking about various ways to drive down prices based on competition and information....it may or may not succeed but they&apos;re reasonable things to try.

But that&apos;s different than feeling you have the RIGHT to get them cheaply, and by the way, same thing applies to theft of movies and videos!
