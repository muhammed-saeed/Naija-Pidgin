can they get a drive thru order right

Posted by a cold apple pie at Monday 07 March 2011

ive have had 5 drive thru orders stuffed up at this maccas, mostly missing burgers.

lets think about this for a minute, we are counting hamburgers, not sheep in a paddock, not bricks in a wall, not sand on all the beaches in the world. you dont have to have a long neck to be a goose.

worst run maccas ive been too, sorry, should did i hear another excuse about an excuse about a reason about why they cant count hamburgers.


 
vise versa

Posted by lozamus at Saturday 22 May 2010

i eat at mcdonalds on and off and sometimes the food is s**t and slapped together and sometimes its good, i do believe that sometimes the staff are young and immature with no work ethic and think mcdonalds hired them to save money on wages employing someone with experience....however having worked at maccas myself when i was young and feeling the pressure of impatient customers was hard and there is alot of pressure on the workers when maccas gets so packed they want perfect food and perfect timing and its just not possible i think the customer and employee both need to understand each others circumstance and remember the good old fashioned patients and respect....life doesn&apos;t always go the way we want lets just have respect for people the world is coming to s**t with everyone complaining about everything all the time...life is too short
 
I AGREE WITH THAT ^^^

i certainly agree with you. people think that they arent getting value when they are!! some customers are real ***heads
 
McDonalds - SO LUCKY

Posted by Anonymous User at Tuesday 18 August 2009

OMG..McDonalds would have to be the most outstanding fast food operator in Australia..The bitching going on about service and quality is soooooooooo laugable.. r u for real.. how about you go into your local cafe and look at their food standards..haaa - there wouldn&apos;t be any. McDonalds offers a safe clean modern space for those wanting that style of fast food and you wont get it at that level anywhere in Australia at the price they provide it. They offer best practise in training - FACT. They offer value for money - FACT. It makes me laugh - compare paying $3.50 for a coffee sitting on a broken seat on a footpath, made from old coffee beans, god knows how the cups have been washed.. to an airconditioned modern dining room at macca&apos;s... you bitching young duds have absolutely no idea... and thats becoz of the typical aussie.. tall poppy syndrome.. success breads envy... get off your ass and go create an alternative - if your so damn smart .. i doubt it.. you probably cant even pull your ipod plugs out of your ears... pfffffffffffffffffttt absolute losers.!!! LOVE YOU ALL MACCA&apos;s.
 
i think. i love this website

Posted by Anonymous User at Sunday 31 May 2009

i love the bitching and the fighting its sooo funny.

You guys are friggen great.

keep up the fighting..

I agree with both views with mcdonalds employees and consumers. My opinion is.. i hate the place. sorry. Im vegetarian and i never will set foot in that place ever again. its absolutely horrid. The smell is just gutwrenching.. what you all are consuming is high in transfats sugar sodium.. over your daily reccommended intake.

(:

Cheers.
 
McDonalds Employees pfft

You cant tell me that EVERYONE that works in these franchises adheres to EVERY rule !!!!! I have been called an idiot wen I didnt move to the waiting bay. I wasnt asked to move to the waiting bay and was no less than abused wen I questioned the woman. I dont care that she was having a bad day or what ever? I expect the same curtiousy I give. Is that to much to ask? It has also been brought to my attention by another &quot;worker&quot; at the same restaurnt that my and my families food is spat in, dropped and sneezed on!!! As there seems to b some personal dispute between 3 young sisters that all work there and my daughter. This is AWAY from work and in no way should enter the workplace. My daughter doesnt go to that franchise and we were only going through the drivethrough. NOT NOW.

Try Cleaning Your Tables

Posted by Anonymous User at Thursday 05 March 2009

I think Mc Donald&apos;s is so totally and completely gross! I just did my science project on how clean fast food restaurant tables are and I would never ever eat in a Mc Donald&apos;s ever again!!!! I wouldn&apos;t order my food at that counter either just because of the millions of people who touch it!
 
GET OVER YOURSELF!!!

Posted by samantha at Thursday 13 November 2008

Hi i worked at mittagong McDonalds for 2 years and i was treated with respect and as a person, if anyone thinks that the staff are slow and have no respect for the customers, How about you try working there and see how hard it is, Who ever works there are tought great respect for everyone.

I think that anyone that is dissing McDonalds wouldn&apos;t last ONE day there so how about you get off your high horse and if you hate it so much stop going there.

Thankyou have a great day...
 
Arrogant staff

Posted by Anonymous User at Sunday 24 August 2008

And it is employees like you that make that restaurant crap *rolls eyes*



You are there to serve the customer, not the other way around. The customer is paying you money for the services that should be provided, and if they are not receiving what they paid for, they should at least get an apology. I also work at a McDonalds, and complaints like that are taken very seriously and are almost always rectified immediately.



I do agree, though, that the food that is claimed to be fresh is, and that there are strict food safety rules which are adhered to, at least where I work.
 
Excuse Me??

Healthy Choice Food Joondalup

Posted by Dorothy at Thursday 03 July 2008

What has happened to the healthy food choice?? We ordered turkey and cranberry rolls, they had not nutritional advice on them, the rolls were not very fresh, we had to stand and wait whereas before, freshly made food was brought to the table. There was only lettuce in the roll, the turkey was thin and falling out the roll. There was a minute amount of cranberry. By the way, advertising food for the olympic games which is no different to the usual food supplied, is not on.
 
Bounced for being incorrectly heard!

Posted by Anonymous User at Saturday 03 May 2008

McDonald&apos;s Joondalup, in Perth has got to be the most filthy McDonald&apos;s in Australia!!! I finally had enough today and asked that a table be cleaned for myself, my son and my friend with her kids I was told by the manager that I must not tell her what to do when I asked, I proceeded to provide her with my opinion of what people expect at McDonald&apos;s e.g. clean tables. I had the actual manager come and give me a mouth full where I found that what I had said was different to what I was hearing. I was told to leave and when I refused they called security to kick me out and threatened to call the police! And all because I will not accept a McDonald&apos;s where the chairs are full of food, the tables are constantly dirty and the service is slow, the staff (not the McCafe staff) are awful and cheeky too.
 
Terrible Food

Posted by Charlotte Young at Tuesday 06 November 2007

Has poor quality food that doesn&apos;t even meet standards set by the Australian Federal Government. Quarter-punders have no sauces, tomatoes are tastless, McChicken burgers are crammed full of vegies, with absolutely no chicken. Horrible food, fit for none but the lowest of animals.
 
McLying Review

Posted by Anonymous User at Tuesday 23 October 2007

Micheal. I also used to work at mcdonalds. The food they say is fesh actually is. They do use longlife food but they don&apos;t advertise that food as fresh. The fruit, tomatoes, lettuce etc. IS fresh. And they take all the precutions and make it mandatory that workers wash theyre hands constantly. Well. They do at the mittagong and sutton forrest one.
 
Mc Donalds lies

Posted by Michael Sempter at Wednesday 03 January 2007

Don&apos;t for a moment believe the crap Mc Donalds puts in their ads. I used to work for them. The food is not fresk or nutritious. And the hygiene? Think about it. Young pimply boys who don&apos;t wash their hands after goihg to the toilet making your food! yuck
