Welcome to Friedey&apos;s, the Fast Food Restaurant of the Damned!

Our whole staff is dead, and we&apos;re really short on brains. But we&apos;ll do our best to fill your order! Even a horde of nearly-mindless zombies can assemble combo meals. Sort of.

And now you&apos;re one of us. Combine frighteningly generic ingredients like Cow Meat , Sauce , and Drink . Play from eight different menus, including Ratherbee&apos;s Steakhouse, the classic Friedey&apos;s Restaurant, and the new McPubihan&apos;s. Build orders like Bovine Spongiform Yum, Yum, Yum!, Penne for Your Tots, Synaptic Relay Deteriorator, and Sheep wit&apos; da Fishes. But be quick–the customer is waiting!

Whoever fills the best orders gets the most points, and the zombie with the most points becomes . . . The Lord of the Fries!

 This new edition of the classic Lord of the Fries includes large, full-color menus, a new restaurant, 8 alternate decks designed for 3-to-5-player games, color-coded dice, point tokens, and a timer.
