Overview
 Quote: On our first night in Manila in February 1989, we hired a private driver at the airport to go find a hotel when Chinese New Year&apos;s was just kicking off. We didn&apos;t have any reservations, thinking we could just pick any place. Wrong. Chinese from Hong Kong, as well as other wealthier places, apparently had booked up the places we checked. The driver pulled over and someone came over to the car. I thought that since this was only our first night, we were going to get robbed. My imagination ran to the extreme.

Read More On our first night in Manila in February 1989, we hired a private driver at the airport to go find a hotel when Chinese New Year&apos;s was just kicking off. We didn&apos;t have any reservations, thinking we could just pick any place. Wrong. Chinese from Hong Kong, as well as other wealthier places, apparently had booked up the places we checked. The driver pulled over and someone came over to the car. I thought that since this was only our first night, we were going to get robbed. My imagination ran to the extreme. It was only a peddler wanting to sell us some watches. I was relieved. We couldn&apos;t find a hotel after the driver kept driving around, asking. We ended up staying at a place you rent by the hour for the night associated with the hotel; we were assured would have a room for us the following day. The person checking us in for the room by the hour asked &quot;No tip for boy?&quot; The driver hushed the attendant. What that meant was they expect to be tipped when you bring another person for play there.

These are some of the happiest, very resourceful people despite their very limited resources. Happiness has nothing to do with being wealthy, though it can comfort you greatly, but there are an awful lot of people wealthy, but not happy.
Quick Tips:
Climate is hot, humid year round, best to go when a bit cooler during November to February. Rainy season is June to October. Philippines Tourism, Utopia-Asia. Upon arrival, immediately after clearing Immigration, drop by the visitors desk and pickup a copy of their visitor&apos;s guide, containing a useful map and suggested things to do and see. Bring only a small amount of cash and small coins with you that you can afford to loose and don&apos;t flash your money or wear anything expensive or flashy jewelery. Bring a small ultra compact digital camera that can slip into your pocket securely, leave the larger camera at home. Bring only what&apos;s necessary for your day trip out. There are plenty of poor people who may ask for money, and thievery may occur at an opportune time for them. Just use your common sense to keep your wits about you. Be aware that if you give to one, suddenly a half dozen may surround you also asking for money. Pickpocketing is an art here. Bring small change for riding the jitneys as they don&apos;t make change for large bills. Corruption is alive and well in this society. Beware of any business opportunities.

Regarding the vendors selling DVDs, unless you can watch them on the spot for quality check, don&apos;t buy them, as ours were poor, inferior copies.

Reserve 750 pesos for your international departure fee and 30? pesos for domestic departure fee at the airport.

Resources: MD Travel Health

Don&apos;t pack any gels or liquids for your carry-on, they must all be in checked baggage or they will be confiscated on your international air departure. Remove any metals from your body prior to screening at the airport, including waist belt. You&apos;ll screen through a bit quicker.
Best Way To Get Around:
Jeepneys, jeep conversions started at the end of World War II, when the US military basically abandoned their jeeps, are very easy and inexpensive to get around by except for the diesel pollution, especially if untuned; they&apos;re all independently owned and operated. It is possible to be boarded by a robber who takes the riders valuables. Though it hasn&apos;t happen to me personally, but I&apos;ve heard stories about that. Jeepneys are much cheaper than taxis if you can figure out your route to your destination and which jeepneys are going along the route needed. Pollution is pretty bad, as most of the vehicles run on diesel engines not tuned. Buses are available. Bus, rail, taxis--ask to be on the meter. Touts at the airport try to get your business going into the city. Ask one of the vendors not trying to sell you service of getting into the city how and where. Hotel taxi to/from the airport for a considerably much higher fix rate if leaving from the arrivals area.

 Tip: Go up one level the the departures area to pickup a taxi dropping off passengers to go on the meter, it&apos;ll be considerably less than leaving from the arrivals with fixed rates.

A sharp cabbie who drove by looking for fares noticed us in the lobby checking out. He agreed to be on the meter, showed something like 95 pesos, and we gave him 200 pesos for his hard efforts. Travel to airport is 30 minutes if leaving prior to 6 or 7am, up to 2 hours, depending on traffic.

Taxis are plentiful in Manila, so much so, that they&apos;re constantly tapping their horn as they drive by to get your attention hoping for another fare.

Calesa (horse-pulled rig) is another way to see parts of Manila. Almost relentless trying to get you to ride one of these lured with a &quot;low&quot; rate, and by the time you pay them the rate wasn&apos;t what was agreed to earlier. It was sort of charming, but having done it once, we avoided them on another visit. Read Less

 Aloha Hotel

 Quote: Aloha Hotel is nice and clean. The hotel safe at the front desk is standard hotel fare. The water in the thermos in the room was filled from the tap. Even though this is a decent hotel, we didn&apos;t want to drink the water directly from the tap. The hotel had a relatively convenient location in relation to places we wanted to go.
The staff, for the most part, is friendly, but they&apos;ve been spoiled by Japanese tourists who don&apos;t know the value of money and throw it away at the people here. When I had a mango shake delivered, I gave the delivery guy a very small tip, and his smile disappeared. On the day of our departure for the airport, I insisted on a metered taxi ride.

On the day of our departure for the airport, I insisted on a metered taxi ride. The first taxi I stopped wouldn&apos;t go by the meter and wanted a fare I refused to accept. This driver decided to park on the side of the street and just watch me for entertainment. I must have gone through four others, and each time, the same thing happened. They wouldn&apos;t go on the meter. And each time, I got more frustrated and angry till I was literally jumping up and down. Finally, perhaps the sixth driver I approached was an honest one and would go on the meter, ending the first taxi&apos;s entertainment.

Read More Manila Hotel offers first class accommodations with 440 rooms, 70 suites, 4 restaurants, bar, tennis courts, pool, gym on 3 1/2 hectares of green shoreline, 20 minutes from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. It&apos;s within walking distance of the Club Intramuros Golf Course, airline and travel offices, shops, galleries, and entertainment spots.

The lobby is quite ornate with Philippine marble floor, narra wood and mahogany ceilings, mother-of-pearl and brass chandeliers, once served as General MacArthur&apos;s unofficial headquarters prior to the start of World War II, and visited by dignitaries Ernest Hemingway and Douglas Fairbanks. The MacArthur club serves complimentary breakfast reached by a private elevator.

We visited this place to have a drink in the lobby lounge. I was wearing shorts and wasn&apos;t allowed in another area because of their dress code. The hotel has strict guidelines: as we left, a taxi dropped off a passenger, but the doorman refused the taxi driver from picking us up and waved him on. The doorman informed us he was blacklisted from picking up passengers.

We stayed here on a subsequent visit. The room is spacious, comfortable beds, air conditioning, mini bar, well maintained, with all its dark woodwork. It&apos;s definitely an older hotel with a long history. Free wi-fi Internet is available in the lobby and swimming pool area. There are museums and sites you may visit within walking distance from the hotel.

The pool bar allows you to order and consume beverages without leaving the pool.

This hotel was chosen for its location in the Spanish Quarter, Malate area, where there&apos;s a gay scene nightlife and close walking distance to Robinson&apos;s Place for shopping, eating, cineplex, and two miles from the business district, underground parking is available.

There&apos;s a K-9 dog unit at the entrance to sniff out your incoming baggage, metal detector, security initially suspicious then friendly smiling staff once they realize you&apos;re hotel guests.

Check in was relatively easy. The room is very spacious and nicely done with a king size, comfortable bed for a good night sleep. The bathroom is nicely done with a bathtub, a separate shower, large mirrors, illuminated convex mirror for your shaving. The shower door wouldn&apos;t close completely, allowing water to get on the bathroom floor, a minor maintenance issue. Access through the upper floors, elevator, room is through the use of your hotel issued swipe card during your stay. A mini bar, fridge is available for use. There is turn down service for your bed.

A Jacuzzi and swimming pool on the 6th floor with towels provided is available for use from 6am to 8pm. A health club on the 6th floor is available for an additional fee offers spa treatments, massage, salon services, a sauna, and steam room. Broadband Internet is available for an additional fee.

Adriatico Square, a five floor complex inside the hotel, has 30 restaurants and bars, for coffee, cocktails, a light meal, or a fine dining experience. Guests may order room service from any of these restaurants. The Pacific Lounge is on the 21st floor, an elegant place for breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails.

Complimentary coffee or tea is provided offered along with our wake up call when we asked for one. Though a minor error was made, provided two coffees instead of one coffee and one tea requested. The staff were alerted of this error and was offered to be redelivered, which we declined. Read Less

The room shown is already reserved, and a room won&apos;t be available for another hour. Upon my return, I checked in, paid in advance, they accept credit cards. I went to my room and was disappointed. The room shown earlier has a bright light feeling, this room has no or very little light from the outside, bad first impression of this room, the light switch was loose, detached, and dangling behind the light switch plate, bad second impression of this room. I was not pleased and went back down complaining and wanted a refund. I was offered one other room to see which was also reserved for someone else. It was lighter than the last room but not as bright as the first room shown, however it was acceptable.

There are no lamps by the bed nor tables, only the wall mounted lights, the bathroom faucet was not securely mounted and moved loosely when operating the valve flow controls of the faucet, only the left side has water flowing, the right side control had no water. No shampoo was provided, only a small pink soap bar. No trash basket in the bedroom, only a trash basket in the bathroom. The air-conditioner in the room has a cooling thermostat range setting from 19° to 30° Celsius.

Despite its relatively small problems, this was a great find, spacious, hardwood floor, good working air-conditioner, mini fridge, for a great price in Malate, where there are gay venues nearby. It&apos;s been open less than a year when I stayed in February 2007, and it&apos;s already got issues of maintenance which is common in Asia, where they generally don&apos;t bother with maintenance or the maintenance is rather low or poor. Recommend that you inspect the room they will actually book you into before checking in and accepting, checking their light switches, faucets, toilet to be sure it&apos;s in working order or that you accept it as is.

We placed an international call to make the reservation, no confirmation nor email was available nor offered. When we arrived, they were expecting us.

They offered us to see the rooms first. They have a standard and a deluxe room. The deluxe offered a slightly larger room. It&apos;s very basic with a bed, TV, air-conditioned, and private bath. The standard room rate PHP1650, deluxe room PHP1850. The hotel check-in clerk was pleasant, friendly, hospitable as was the guard; they treat you like being a member of the good side of their family. They insisted on helping carry the luggage to our room. Stairs only, no elevator.

The air conditioned was insufficient to keeping us cool as we were still perspiring and this was the end of their cool season in February. The blankets on the bed also was not sufficient in covering us completely when sleeping, but it was too warm in the room for us anyway. The room had a dark, dingy look to it day or night, as most of the lighting was artificial.

I would consider other places first, this would be a fallback position if I couldn&apos;t find accommodations elsewhere.

Coffee shop-deli is on the premises. Check-in 2pm, check out 12 noon. We were late checking out, and they were very accommodating and understanding. Credit cards accepted. Read Less
