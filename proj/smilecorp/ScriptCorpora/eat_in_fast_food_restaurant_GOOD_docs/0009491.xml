PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION. 



THE présent édition of a work which, now some twenty years before 
the public, may justly be said to hâve maintained a standard char- 
acter, has been undertaken at the request of the author*s family. The 
Editor takes pleasure in saying that, in the minute revision to which the 
book has been subjected, he has found little more to do than to carry out 
to a greater completeness the lines of Mr. Soule&apos;s original design. That 
design, not only in its gênerai conception, but in the exécution of its 
détails, seems to him, on the whole, the best that any single work on 
Synonymes in our language affords, — an impression which has grown 
stronger during the process of comparison with the chief works of that 
class rendered necessary in preparing this édition, and which it is believed 
a like comparison on the part of readers will surely corroborate. 

The judicious consulter of a synonymie dictionary will readily acquiesce 
in the statement that a perfect manual of that sort is impossible within the 
compass of a single work of convenient size and arrangement. Three dis- 
tinct points of view are necessary to fulfil the wants that are sure to arise 
when such a work has to be consulted, — the writer, seeking for the most 
suitable expression, may set out from the less suitable word; or from the 
vague gênerai notion that he obscurely aims to express ; or, finally, from 
several words of cognate meaning, the exactly suitable one of which he 
would détermine by a close discrimination between them. A work on 
Synonymes may thus bave for its purpose either an alphabetic list of ail 
the more important words in the language, with their various meanings 
or shades of meaning set down under them, each followed by its appro- 
priate synonymes ; or a list of gênerai notions, duly named and properly 
divided and subdivided, with the words and phrases that belong to the 



IV PREFACE. 

expression of each collected under tbem as fully as possible ; or, again, 
the collocation of words allied in meaning with subjoined disquisitions 
on the shades of différence between them. The latter conception has 
been the prevailing one among English makers of synonymie dictionaries, 
and is represented by the well-known work of Crabb, as well as by any ; 
the second is that of Roget&apos;s Thésaurus; while the fîrst is that of 
Soûle. It is safe to say that while each is indispensable to a perfect ful- 
filment of a writer&apos;s possible wants, the fîrst is that which is most com- 
prehensive, most convenient and rapid in use, and most likely to meet 
the requirements of the greatest number of persons. 

In endeavoring to carry out Mr. Soule&apos;s plan to greater perfection, the 
chief aim, beyond the correction of press-errors and obvious lapses of the 
pen, has been to discriminate the various sensés of leading words more 
exactly, completing the distinction where it already existed in part, and 
supplying it where it was lacking. Besides this, the labor has been mainly 
confined to enlarging the lists of synonymie words and phrases. The 
number of such expressions has been increased, on an average, by about 
a third. For this purpose free use has been made of the new éditions 
of Roget&apos;s Thésaurus and the Impérial Dictionary. 

The Editor takes pleasure in making spécial acknowledgment of the 
assistance rendered him by Miss C. N. Bynner. The primary revision of 
nearly one half of the text has been done by her ; and the thoroughness 
and accurate knowledge of our vocabulary, with which she has performed 
her task, hâve rendered the labor of final revision in that portion of the 
book comparatively light. 

In a work involving so many détails, it is impossible but that errors will 
hâve been left or committed, in spite of ail endeavors to the contrary. 
Notice of any such, detected by readers, will be received with thanks. 



PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. 



THE main design of thîs Dictionary is to provide a ready means of 
assistance when one is at a loss for a word or an expression that 
best suits a particular turn of thought or mood of the mind, or that may 
obviate an ungraceful répétition. Even practised and skilful writers are 
sometimes embarrassed in the endeavor to make a sentence more clear,. 
simple, terse, or rhythmical, by the substitution of one form of diction for 
another. It is presumed that they, as well as novices in composition, will 
find the présent work useful in overcoming difficulties of this sort. 

As to the method of using it : Whenever a doubt anses in regard ta 
the fitness of any word, and a better one is not readily suggested, let the 
writer turn to this word in its alphabetical place. Under it will be found 
the words and phrases, or some clew to the words and phrases, which, in 
any connection, hâve the same meaning as itself, or a meaning very nearly 
the same. That one of them which cornes nearest to expressing the exact 
shade of thought in the writer&apos;s mind will be likely to arrest the attention 
and détermine the choice. 

In most cases, ail the words that belong to any group will be found in 
that group. But in some instances, as when the same word falls into two 
or more groups that are near to each other, or when there are so many 
synonymes for a word that a répétition of every one of them under each 
in its alphabetical place would seem to be too formai and prolix, the 
inquirer is referred to some prominent word among them for a view of the 
whole. Under the word Blockhead, for example, référence is made 
to the word Dunce, under which will be found ail the words that are 
synonymous with it. This example is given because it is the most marked 
one in our language of a multiplicity of terms for the same idea. 



VI PREFACE. 

Many nouns ending in ness 9 and adverbs ending in fy, hâve been 
omitted in their alphabetical places, for the reason that their synonymes 
are sufficiently indicated by the corresponding adjectives. 

The aim has been to présent at a single glance the words or modes 
of speech which dénote the same object, or which express the same 
gênerai idea, with only slight shades of différence. There has been no 
attempt at elaborate discussion of the nice distinctions that obtain between 
words apparently synonymous ; but hints of such distinctions hâve been 
given whenever it was practicable to give them briefly in a parenthetical 
remark. 

In preparing this Dictionary, free use has been made of the following 
works : Roget&apos;s Thésaurus of Words and Phrases ; the Quarto Dictionaries 
of Webster and of Worcester; Crabb&apos;s Synonymes; Graham&apos;s Syno- 
nymes; Whately&apos;s Synonymes; Platt&apos;s Synonymes; the Dictionaries of 
Synonymes by Fenby, Sherer, Mackenzie, and Smith ; the Médical Dic- 
tionaries of Dunglison and of Thomas ; and the United States Dispen- 
satory by Wood and Bâche. It contains much, however, that has been 
gathered frora a wide field of miscellaneous reading during a long séries 
of years. 

The&apos; author is under spécial obligations to his friends, Mr. Justin 
Winsor, Mr. William A. Whebler, and Mr. Loomis J. Campbell, for 
the interest they bave manifested in the progress of the work, and for 
their valuable suggestions and criticisms.

Haltes, in the printing of a word or a phrase, signify that the expression belongs to a 
foreign language, and is not yet completely naturalized in English, being still pronounced 
according to its own tongue. 

When a word has more than one signification, the separate groups of synonymes, corre» 
tponding to the several meanings, are designated by figures. 



Parts of synonymie phrases, enclosed in parenthèses, but not italidzed, are optional.
