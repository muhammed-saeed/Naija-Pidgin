What is appropriate clothing to wear in a food preparation area in a fast food restaurant?
 i was in a fast food place last weekend. While i was sitting watching the staff out back, one young man who was not wearing a uniform like the rest of the staff, but was just in a singlet, shorts and sandals continually walked in and out from the food service area out to the restaurant. he must have been an employee, because nobody said anything, but it was a bit disconcerting to think of maybe an armpit or a chest hair landing in someones burger. Are the any rules about dress code in a food preparation area? All the other staff have hats/ hairnets, and proper shirts/ long pants

 Well Nikki, My wife hates to go out to places with me cause I look at things like that all the time. I am in food service and knoww what is right and wrong concerning health codes. I have boycotted many places we&apos;ve been to because of what I&apos;ve seen.

I would have talked to the manager right then and there to just voice your concern but you could drop a note to them or find out who the owner is and send to them. It might not help but it makes you feel better. Here&apos;s a story I have, We went to a new place that just opened near the house. I watched a server stick her hand into the popcorn machine and eat some popcorn, they put a basket of it on every table. a manager happen to come by my table and asked how&apos;s everything. Perfect opportunity and I told him what I had seen, he said I&apos;m sorry, she&apos;s my daughter. I told him I did not care if it was Jesus, you do not stick your hand into food your serving to every customer in the place. He did not give me a discount or any kind of remorse and I told him I&apos;d never eat there again.

 Appropriate clothing include no loose hairs, covered armpits, and close-toed shoes. At least that&apos;s how I know it is in California. My guess would be that he was an employee off the clock. At many kitchens I worked in it was okay to come in in our&quot;street clothes&quot;when we were off the clock and we needed to come in for whatever. But believe me, speaking from experience, food in many restaurants isn&apos;t nearly as sanitary as you believe it to be.

 I use to work at KFC, we always had to wear our uniforms, but if we had to get something or whatever we just could walk in and get whatever we wanted. Our boss was pretty lean, didn&apos;t really care about what we wore offshift. What are the odds of an armpit hair falling out, then what are the odds of it landing in food? Unlikely.

 depends on the place the person could have been a mgr and just there to do book work on a day off but most places you are not allowed to were tank tops but as far as hair nets most places only require your hair to be pulled back

 I wouldn&apos;t eat there anymore. Just because everybody else was dressed properly, it shows a lack of sanitation on every ones part. Eww.
