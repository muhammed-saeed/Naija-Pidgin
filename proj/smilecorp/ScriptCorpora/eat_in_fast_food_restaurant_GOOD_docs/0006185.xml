a) CONTROLS AND BASIC GAME MECHANICS srch1a
====================================

CONTROLS AND THE BASICS OF NAVIGATION:

[NOTE - This guide deals with the Super NES version of Zombies. Controls for
the Sega Genesis version, which I don&apos;t own, are different.]

The regular controls are as follows:

 + shaped pad - Move around the world.
 - Swim, while in the water.
 Y button - Fires your currently selected weapon.
 X button - Uses your currently selected special item.
 B button - Changes your selected weapon to the next in the list.
 A button - Changes your selected special item to the next in the list.
 - Allows you to check how many Keys and Skeleton Keys you have
 as well, as they&apos;re listed in there too.
L and R buttons - Toggle your Victim Radar on and off (more on that in section&quot;c&quot;).
 Start button - Pauses the game. Both players can toggle&quot;paused&quot;status.

Also note the following:

- To dive into water, walk up to the edge of it.
- To get out of water again, swim back to the edge.
- There is only one Monster which can attack players and Victims in the water.
- To jump onto a trampoline, walk up to its edge.
- To jump off a trampoline, hold down the direction you want to jump. When you
 fall back to the trampoline, your character will jump in the direction you
 are indicating. (You will sometimes be unable to jump in certain directions.)
- No Monsters are able to attack players and Victims who are on trampolines.

The world of Zombies is seen from an angled overhead view, allowing you to see
your character and his surroundings. In this walkthrough, movement instructions
are given in terms of compass directions,&quot;north&quot;being directly up-screen. You
will find locked doors as you explore the levels; these can be opened with the
aid of Keys, which are used automatically when you walk into the doors. You
will need to find one Key for every door you want to open (although you can use
force to open doors instead, if you have the right weapons for the job).

-----

YOUR HEALTH:

Each player begins the game with a Water Pistol, a First Aid Kit, a full health
bar and three lives. Whenever you are hurt by a Monster, you will lose
one-tenth of your health bar; when you have lost all of your health bar, you
will faint and lose a life. If you lose all of your lives, it&apos;s game over for
you. (You cannot see how many lives you have while on a level - only at the
end-of-level bonus screen.) However, if your health bar is not full, you may
use a First Aid Kit to make it full again. It&apos;s best to leave it until you have
rather less than half of your health bar left (say, two-tenths left) before
healing using a First Aid Kit, in order to strike the right balance between
being too daring, and using First Aid Kits unnecessarily.

-----

VICTIMS:

Although your characters are fighting through the Monster hordes primarily in
order to get to Dr. Tongue&apos;s laboratory and show him the error of his ways,
they&apos;re also defending the Victims in each area they visit. The Victims are
your neighbours, referred to as&quot;Victims&quot;because they&apos;re who the Monsters are
after (for the most part). It&apos;s one of your goals in the game to save as many
of the Victims as you can, as you play through. Victims are saved by walking
into them, which results in them disappearing in a cloud of gratefulness and
bonus points. However, if a Monster makes contact with them in the same way,
they&apos;re history...

You start on level 1 with ten Victims, and on each level they must all be
either saved by you, or killed by the monsters, after which the Exit Door will
materialise and allow you to leave. Whenever you progress to the next level,
the same number of Victims will be placed on it for you to save, as were
collected on the last level. Beware - if all the Victims on a level die,
without you saving any of them, it&apos;s an instant game over... Thus, from even
the most cynical point of view, it&apos;s definitely in your interests to keep as
many Victims alive as possible, for as long as possible.

The Victims come in ten varieties (in addition to a secret Victim who appears
only once in the game, and gives you a bundle of points). Your neighbours
comprise the following types of people:

- Cheerleaders (1000 points each)
- Babies (700 points each)
- Dogs (500 points each)
- Explorers (500 points each)
- Trampoline Girls (300 points each)
- Tourist Couples (200 points each) - These are pairs of people standing
 together; each couple counts as just one Victim, though.
- Barbecue Guys (105 points each)
- Soldiers (100 points each)
- Swimming Pool Guys (100 points each)
- Teachers (10 points each)

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

b) DETAILED GAME MECHANICS srch1b
==========================

VICTIM DEATH AND REBIRTH, AND VICTIM PROVISION ORDER:

As explained above, the number of Victims appearing on a level is mostly
determined by the number you saved in the previous one. If you allow two
Victims to die in a level, you will have two less in the next one. But as
you&apos;ll appreciate, this arrangement on its own would result in every player
eventually losing all their Victims but for one, which they would then have to
worry about on every level. This is not the case - because the game also offers
you a way of reinstating the Victims who&apos;ve previously died, by earning new
ones.

Every time your score breaks a multiple of 40,000 points, you earn an&quot;Extra
Bonus Victim&quot;. To clarify: if, when the game finishes adding up your bonus
points after you&apos;ve exited a level, you have broken at least one new multiple
of 40,000 points since you began the level, you are awarded exactly one Extra
Bonus Victim, which is added to your number of Victims in time for the upcoming
level. (A&quot;multiple&quot;just means a number that divides by 40,000 to give an
integral answer: 40,000, 80,000, 120,000, 160,000, and so on.)

If you saved five Victims in a level but also earned yourself an Extra Bonus
Victim, then you&apos;ll have six Victims to save as you start the next level. If
you&apos;re playing in two-player mode, you can both earn Extra Bonus Victims at the
same time, if you both break a score barrier in the same level; this means that
you can generate up to two new Victims per level. Note that the last two levels
in the game do not allow you to earn any bonus points at all after exiting, nor
do they allow you to earn Extra Bonus Victims.

Each level has nine&quot;potential&quot;Victims and one&quot;Always There&quot;Victim. The&quot;Always There&quot;Victim (hereafter referred to as&quot;Victim #A&quot;) is, as the term
suggests, always there - even if you have only one Victim. The other Victims
are numbered two to ten and are added according to how many Victims you have;
thus,&quot;Victim number seven&quot;is present if you have seven (or more) Victims, but
he is not present if you have six (or less).

This&quot;Victim Provision Order&quot;means that a player can predict exactly which
Victims are going to appear on a level, and choose different routes through the
map in order to visit each place he needs to. In my walkthrough, I&apos;ve assumed
that you keep your number of Victims squarely at ten the whole way through -
which actually isn&apos;t all that hard to do if you keep on racking up points to
earn Extra Bonus Victims.

Each level walkthrough will direct you to every place you need to visit to find
all ten Victims. If you haven&apos;t got ten then most of the time you should tag
along anyway, as it doesn&apos;t add much distance to your route and you will often
pick up items that you need along the way. The main situation that arises in
which you should not do this, is when the route suggested appears to be a
detour that would result only in your needlessly using items or putting
yourself in danger.

----

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

On several levels, Tourists present must be saved quickly, or after a certain
time limit is reached, they will turn into pairs of Werewolves when they are
brought on-screen. Werewolves are powerful monsters which take several hits
from most weapons to kill, and can jump between points on the map in order to
keep up with you. If Tourists change into Werewolves, they effectively die, so
it&apos;s important to try and get to the Tourists as quickly as possible on the
levels on which this occurs. (In some situations, it is possible to save
Tourists even after the time limit has been exceeded, by exploiting the game&apos;s
programming - see section two,&quot;Tips, Tricks and Strategies&quot;, below.)

-----

VICTIM RADAR:

The Victim Radar is toggled on and off by pressing the L or R shoulder buttons
on the Super NES controller. The radar is a simple visual display in the corner
of the screen; it shows all of the Victims within the radius of one and a half
screen&apos;s lengths of you, with each Victim being represented by one dot. Despite
being such a simple device, the Radar is often very helpful in searching an
unfamiliar area for Victims, and when you need to know exactly how far you are
from a Victim in danger. Although I only specifically direct you to use the
Radar a few times in the whole game, it does no harm to have it on at other
times as well.

-----

PASSWORDS:

After every fourth level you clear, you are presented with a new password. This
password will allow you to return to your current point in the game (that is,
the start of the upcoming level) with your current amount of Victims (after any
Extra Bonus Victims that you&apos;ve earned, have been applied). You will not
restart with all the weapons you had; you&apos;ll just have the standard Water
Pistol, First Aid Kit and three lives. This makes levels much harder, as you
will not have so many special items.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

c) OTHER MAP FEATURES srch1c
=====================

CUPBOARDS AND OTHER STORAGE SPACES:

As you explore the levels of Zombies, you&apos;ll come across a variety of storage
units, which can be opened. The contents of a unit vary randomly and are
different in each game you play: it may contain an item or weapon; it may
contain nothing at all; or it may contain a Bogeyman, which is essentially a
booby trap that reduces your health. Some storage units can be opened from
their north as well as from their south - this eliminates the Bogeymen, but it
seems to also reduce the probability of finding a useful item inside.

-----

RESPONSIBLE USE OF BAZOOKAS:

The Bazooka is a fine, powerful weapon, but it has another important use: it
can be used to blast down obstacles that are obstructing your progress. This
includes regular doors, weak plaster walls, hedgerows, and fences, among other
things. You&apos;ll rely on this use of the Bazooka quite a lot, which is why it&apos;s
such a valuable weapon to have. The Monster Potion also allows you to knock
down weak obstacles by punching them, but that&apos;s a useful side effect more than
anything else. Here is a list of things that may be blasted down with Bazooka
shells, and what to target to achieve this:

OBSTACLE: | FIRE AT:
---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
Plaster wall | Cracks in the top. If there are no cracks, you
 | can&apos;t blast it down.
Hedges |
 - (east-to-west hedges) | The sections with the lower, slightly darker tops.
 - (north-to-south hedges) | The sections which appear more gnarled, with dark
 | patterns on them.
Fences | The sections with the pointy tops.
Supermarket aisle walls |
 - (east-to-west walls) | Towards the western sides of the rows of red tin
 | cans on the top shelves.
 - (north-to-south walls) | The large groups of red tin-cans.
Rows of boxes | The cracked ones.
---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
Regular door | Just fire straight at it.
Shop window |&quot;Giant cobwebs |&quot;Cracked box |&quot;Collapsing Roof Gate* |&quot;*These are archways that collapse after you have walked through them.

Some items are hidden in areas where you can only access them with the
Bazookas; for example, a First Aid Kit, a Monster Potion and a Fire
Extinguisher are hidden in this way on level 4. Such items are usually hidden
inside things I call&quot;hedge blocks&quot;- they&apos;re large blocks of greenery which
have weak hedge sections at the front, which can be blasted down to expose a
hollow area inside, that may contain goodies.

-----

SKELETON KEYS:

In the world of Zombies, a Skeleton Key is a differently shaped Key used to
open a special kind of door. These are the Skull Doors, easily identifiable
from their skull design. You cannot use a normal Key to open a Skull Door;
likewise, you cannot use a Skeleton Key to open a regular door. Also, unlike
regular doors, you cannot blast open Skull Doors with the Bazooka. You can
check how many Skeleton Keys you are carrying by using the A button, as they
are listed as one of the special items, just like regular Keys.

Skeleton Keys mostly appear towards the end of the game, hidden in levels or
held by a boss monster. This is a way of forcing you to explore the level (or
fight the boss) before you can get in to save the final Victim (generally the&quot;Always There&quot;Victim), who will be in a cell behind a Skull Door. So, for the
most part, Skeleton Keys are an element of level design, and the way they are
rationed out tends to prevent you from keeping one to use on another level.

However, you can find Skeleton Keys in Cupboards (though very rarely), and
there are a total of two other Skeleton Keys in the game, which are available
to anyone who cares to earn them and which do not need to be used to save
Victims (however many of them you have). The first of these is on level 15, on
which a Key is located on a small island and is easy to obtain. This should be
used on level 22 to access a very worthwhile secret. The second free Skeleton
Key is on level 25, held by a boss, and can be used on that level to obtain an
Extra Life or kept for use later in the game...

There is a certain degree of investment in the use of a Skeleton Key; will you
use it now, or will you put it aside to bypass part of a level that you dislike
or aren&apos;t any good at, later in the game? If you can avoid using a Skeleton Key
on one level, you might find it pays off when you can escape a level quickly
later on. The following table tells you how many Skeleton Keys are available on
each level in the game, how many must be used on each level (never more than
the number present), and how many you have the option of using on each level,
to access various bonuses. You can use this to plan an entire game from start
to finish if you want.

 LEVEL | AVAILABLE | MUST USE | CAN USE
---------|-----------|---------------------------------------|-----------------
 1-B | 1 | 1 | 0
 8 | 1 | 1 | 0
 15 | 1 | 0 | 0
 20 | 3 | 2 or 3 (depends on number of Victims) | 0
 22 | 0 | 0 | 1 (recommended)
 22-B | 1 | 1 | 0
 24 | 0 | 0 | 1
 25 | 1 | 0 | 1
 28 | 4 | 4 | 0
 32 | 3 | 2 or 3 (depends on number of Victims) | 0
 34 | 2 | 1 or 2 (depends on number of Victims) | 0
 38 | 0 | 0 | 1
 39 | 2 | 2 | 0
 40 | 2 | 1 or 2 (depends on number of Victims) | 0
 44 | 1 | 1 | 0
 46 | 2 | 2 | 0
 47 | 3 | 1 or 2 (depends on number of Victims) | 0
 48 | 5 | 4 or 5 (depends on number of Victims) | 0

*Remember that Skeleton Keys may appear in Cupboards too.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

d) THE SPECIAL ITEMS, AND THEIR USES srch1d
====================================

The special items can be very useful, but often only in specific situations.
Here is some information on how best to use them:

-----

- The FIRST AID KIT fills your health bar. I recommend using it when your
health falls to two-tenths of the bar, in most cases; but when you&apos;re in an
area containing Jelly Blobs, you should use one as soon as your health falls to
three-tenths of the bar, as that&apos;s how much damage the Jelly Blobs deal in
total with one of their Jelly Bomb attacks.

-----

- SPEED SHOES allow you to run across land at twice your normal speed for 15
seconds after you use them. They&apos;re therefore very useful for approaching
Victims who are likely to be in danger, very quickly; in particular, there are
a few occasions throughout the game in which Speed Shoes are very useful in
getting to Tourist-Werewolves before the time limit is up. (If you need to use
Speed Shoes directly at the start of the level, a notice at the end of the
previous level&apos;s walkthrough will tell you that you need to prepare.) The only
problem with the Speed Shoes is that it can be difficult to collect the Victims
when you&apos;ve actually got to them, because your control over your high-speed
character is so much less accurate.

-----

- PANDORA&apos;S BOXES are little golden chests; when opened they let out energy
blasts which whiz around the screen for a fraction of a second, dealing damage
to Monsters. Although weak Monsters will usually be killed, and tough Monsters
will usually take a dent to their health, you cannot predict exactly whom the
blasts will target. In particular, some enemies, like Frankenstein&apos;s Monster,
are barely ever targeted.

Apart from their use as an offensive weapon against bosses, Pandora&apos;s Boxes can
also be used to defend Victims that are in danger as you approach. For example,
let&apos;s say you have to approach a Baby who&apos;s in the northeast corner of the
level, in the middle of a Zombie spawning area, from around the wall. As you
approach, a Zombie rises up and heads for the Baby; you can&apos;t kill the Zombie
with your Water Pistol, but you can with a Pandora&apos;s Box. The only thing wrong
with this is that sometimes, the bolts of energy don&apos;t get to the Monster you
particularly want killed (in time), so the Victim dies anyway.

-----

- MONSTER POTION: The red liquid in the laboratory flask transforms you into a
Purple Monster for about 35 seconds. While in Purple Monster form, you are
invulnerable, but you can deal considerable and repeated damage to Monsters
with your punch attack - press the A, B, X or Y buttons. The punch will also
bring down regular doors and weak sections of wall, etc. as the Bazooka does.
The Monster Potion is very useful for fighting tough Monsters, particularly
bosses; and also for fighting *through* Monsters if you want to get somewhere
fast, and not worry about taking damage. Note that as the Purple Monster, you
cannot open Skull Doors, you cannot swim, and you cannot use trampolines.

-----

- GHOST POTION: The blue liquid in the laboratory flask turns you into a ghost
for about 25 seconds. While in ghost form, you are invulnerable, and you can
also walk across the surface of water. This makes it useful for approaching
Victims without having to worry about being held up by Monsters, or by having
to dive into the water. This is most useful in areas containing Squidmen, as
they can get to Victims very quickly, whether in the water or not, and so you
need to be able to as well. Note that as a ghost, you cannot use weapons, open
any doors, or use trampolines.

-----

- The MYSTERY POTION is a laboratory flask overlaid with a question mark. It
can have any of six effects. The random nature of Mystery Potions makes them
unsuitable for critical uses such as helping you to save Victims, but they can
be useful when fighting bosses, as a time-wasting tactic; as a source of random
health boosts; and for the occasional Purple Monster transformation. The six
effects of the Mystery Potion are as follows:

1) You are turned into the Purple Monster, as with the Monster Potion.
2) You are turned into a ghost, as with the Ghost Potion.
3) Your speed increases, as with the Speed Shoes.
4) Your health bar is filled, as with the First Aid Kit.
5) You lose some of your health (you will never fall below two-tenths of your
 health bar as a result of using the Mystery Potion, though).
6) You turn into Mr. Hyde.

Mr. Hyde is an evil alternate form for yourself; you know that you have turned
into him when your skin and clothes change to sickly colours and
skull-and-crossbones icons appear in your weapon status bar. You have no direct
control over Mr. Hyde; he walks around randomly, and if he gets near to a
Victim (or the second player), he will dash over at high speed and kill him (or
deal him damage). It seems that if you press the directional controls, you may
be able to influence Mr Hyde&apos;s movement in a very limited way, but he will just
as often purposely disobey you as he will obey, so don&apos;t count on being able to
steer him away from trouble. You remain as Mr. Hyde for about 25 seconds.

-----

- DECOY CLOWNS are inflatable clown toys that act as substitute Victims,
drawing Monsters&apos; attention away from you and the real Victims. They will
occupy the Monsters&apos; attention until they burst. Unmolested, the Clowns last
about 17 seconds, but when under attack they will burst rather more quickly
(the exact time depending simply upon how they are attacked). You can only have
three Decoy Clowns inflated on the level at any one time.

-----

- KEYS AND SKELETON KEYS: These icons are just present to allow you to check
how many of each type of Key you have.

e) HOW TO USE THE LEVEL WALKTHROUGHS srch1e
====================================

(An example data section and walkthrough)

-----

##) THE INTRODUCTORY TEXT DESCRIBING THE LEVEL

-----

DIFFICULTY: 1/10 to 10/10

// The difficulty rating system is self-explanatory. Sometimes the difficulty
// of a level varies according to how many Victims you have, or how many useful
// items you have managed to collect since starting your playing session, in
// which case the difficulty rating is expressed as being within a certain
// range. The text beneath the difficulty rating acts as an introduction to the
// level, and will tell you which aspects are hard and which are easy, though
// not usually in specific terms.

NEW HAZARD: Shiny disco balls. Don&apos;t look directly at them or you will be
overpowered by the groove and have to dance frenziedly on the spot for a full
five seconds.

// If included, this section is just to notify you that some new trap or exotic
// element of level design is introduced on the level.

NEW MONSTERS: Ewoks
 Rubber Chicken with a Pulley in the Middle

// If included, this section simply tells you that a new monster will appear on
// this level, that you haven&apos;t come across before. You should check out the
// Monster List section, just below, for information on where it is and in what
// abundance.

MONSTER LIST: Doppelgangers [Vicious] (intensity: very low, location: one
 place)
 Pod Plants (seven)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 10 seconds: #s 9&amp;10;
 spawning randomly after 60 seconds, intensity: high,
 location: the northwest corner of the map)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from medium to
 very high, location: two places)

// The monsters appearing on the level are listed in alphabetical order, and
// after each monster&apos;s name is further data that gives you a good idea of how
// plentifully it is to be found. This data can be interpreted as follows:

-- If a number is given in brackets after the monster&apos;s name, then that means
// there are exactly that many on the level. If the monster is one that simply
// spawns inexhaustibly around a given area (or areas), then it will have a
// sub-entry for&quot;intensity&quot;which tells you at what rate it appears (very low,
// low, medium, high or very high), or the greatest and least rates at which it
// appears.

-- The&quot;location&quot;sub-entry tells you where the monster appears - not usually
// in specific terms, rather as a general expression of how prevalent the
// monster is throughout the map.

-- As noted above in sub-section&quot;c&quot;, on some levels, Tourists turn into
// Werewolves after a time limit is up. If so, this time limit is given, along
// with the Victim numbers of the Tourists (e.g. 9 and 10 here). The
// sub-entries describing&quot;normal&quot;Werewolves&apos; spawning patterns on the level
// are the same as for any other Monster. However, Werewolves tend not to start
// spawning immediately, preferring instead to wait until a certain amount of
// time has passed. That approximate amount of time will also be given here.

-- Zombies and Doppelgangers come in two varieties:&quot;Normal&quot;and&quot;Vicious&quot;. The
// Vicious ones are harder. The square brackets after the Monster name describe
// which types appear, though not in what ratio to each other.

BOSS: Angry Pet Hamsters (two)

// If the level features a boss creature, it is pointed out here. The number
// present is also given, as there can be more than one.

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - Behind the Skull Door on the eastern edge of the map.
 2)
 3) // This lists all ten Victims present on the level, sorted according to
 4) // the Victim Provision Order (see above) with Victim number A first,
 5) // and tells you where they are found. Don&apos;t expect detailed
 6) // directions - just a description that links each to the appropriate
 7) // part of the level, and perhaps to a nearby landmark.
 8)
 9) Tourists - In the northeast corner of the level, next to the drums of toxic
 waste.
10) Tourists - In the northwest corner of the map, near the house where the
 Skeleton Key is hidden.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two Bazooka pickups
 Skeleton Key (which you will have to use)

// If there are any items lying around which you really must get, they will be
// listed here.

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Bonus for Dividing by Zero (5000 points)

// This section lists all the ways in which the level allows you to earn extra
// points, which are added to your total before the next level begins.&quot;Victim
// collection bonuses&quot;describes the normal group of three bonuses which are
// nearly always available. A full list of other bonuses is given in the&quot;Tips,
// Tricks, and Strategies&quot;section, below.

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Go to the southeast corner of the level, far
away from the Werewolves, and rack up points by wasting the Zombies.

// As described earlier, you have the opportunity of earning an Extra Bonus
// Victim (or even two) on each and every level in the game (apart from the
// last two), provided that you score enough points. The best areas for points
// scoring are documented in this last entry for the level data section.

-----

// After the dashed line, the walkthrough begins. On some occasions
// (particularly in the later levels), there will be more than one walkthrough,
// catering to players in different situations. If so, each walkthrough will be
// clearly labelled.

PREAMBLE:

// This section tells you anything that you specifically need to know about
// before beginning the level (such as Tourist-Werewolves). You will be
// prompted to read it at the end of the previous level&apos;s walkthrough.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

// If there are Tourists on the level who change into Werewolves after a time
// limit, you will need to go and save them first of all. This is the first
// part of the walkthrough, and tells you how to do just that.

VICTIMS:

// Assuming there are no Tourist-Werewolves on the level, this is the first
// part of the walkthrough, and guides you through the best way to save all ten
// Victims. If there were Tourist-Werewolves, then this section follows on from
// the previous one.

PICKUPS:

// If there are any items to find which you don&apos;t come by while following the
//&quot;Victims&quot;part of the walkthrough, this section will tell you how to get to
// them, and back to the Exit Door again.

WALKTHROUGH:

// If the best route through the level allows you to get all the pickups before
// you&apos;ve got all the Victims, there is no point having separate sections, or a
//&quot;Victims&quot;section on its own, so the&quot;Walkthrough&quot;heading is used for the
// whole thing.

// Further notes on the walkthrough:
//
// For the purpose of emphasis, the names of Victims and of pickups are treated
// as proper nouns - every initial letter is capitalised, for example Swimming
// Pool Guy and Martian Bubble Gun. All Victims have a number in brackets after
// their name whenever they are mentioned; this tells you where in the Victim
// Provision Order they are (see above). For example, if a Victim is marked
// with a (6), you will only find him there if you had six or more Victims when
// you started the level.

a) TOURIST-WEREWOLF EXPLOIT srch2a

This is an exploit that allows you to save some Tourists on levels in which
they would turn into Werewolves, even after the time limit has expired. In
particular, this exploit is useful in saving Victim number 9 on level 28,
because that particular Tourist Couple is much too far away from the start of
the level for you to have any hope of getting to them in addition to the other
two Tourist Couples present. However, for all its usefulness, this exploit may
be looked upon as cheating by some, and they will not want to use it.

While running Zombies, your Super NES machine has only a limited amount of its
resources dedicated to the Monsters that are present on-screen; in particular,
it only has the capacity to animate a certain number of sprites on the screen
at once.&quot;Sprites&quot;here means all objects that switch between frames of
animation, which includes Victims too. When a certain number of Monsters are
present, no more can be spawned until some have died, because otherwise the
Super NES would be unable to cope with all the work and would slow to running
the game at a snail&apos;s pace.

Tourist Couples are just one sprite, but each Werewolf is two sprites. More
importantly, if there are more than a certain number of enemies on screen, the
Werewolves are two enemies too many. So, if you have a certain number of
enemies following on close behind when you approach the Tourists, the machine
won&apos;t allow them to transform into more enemies, and you&apos;ll be able to collect
them. After collecting the Tourists, you are then free to kill the enemies
following you, as they have served their purpose - unless you want to collect
another Tourist Couple in this way, of course...

On level 28, for example, there is an area to the south of Victim #9 where
Vicious Zombies spawn at a reasonable rate. If you go there and wait around,
dodging the Zombies until there are five or six of them (but killing the
randomly spawning Werewolves that jump in), you will have a force of Monsters
that will prevent the Tourists (9) from transforming while they are in the
Super NES&apos; memory. Shuffle along ahead of them, not allowing them to fall
behind and off the screen, and make your way north through the system of
passages to where the Tourists (9) stand. (The system might start working
slightly sluggishly when the Tourists come on-screen - this is normal.) You
will be able to collect them safely - after which you can get rid of the
Zombies chasing you, by shooting them all.

This tactic can also be used on, for example, level 48, to collect two
consecutive Tourist Couples (4 and 5) who are east across a stone walkway from
an area where Zombies spawn. An example of a level in which this approach is
unfeasible is level 17: here, the Tourists (9 and 10) are just past an area of
the level where a variety of enemies appear, and where other Victims can be
found. It is not a good idea to attempt to bring a group of Zombies through,
because they will try to kill the other Victims along the way, and because
there is nowhere nearby that can suitably be used to recruit them.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

b) CLEARING THE MACHINE&apos;S MEMORY srch2b

Another limitation of the Super NES that may be exploited is the game&apos;s
inability to preserve the locations of most Monsters when they are too far away
from the player. For all but the most powerful, semi-boss-like Monsters (Crazy
Lumberjacks, Vampires, and Frankenstein&apos;s Monsters), the game will discard them
as soon as they are a certain distance off-screen. Even those three varieties
of Monster can do nothing of any consequence if the player is not nearby to
witness them doing it; that means that they can&apos;t kill Victims (and Lumberjacks
can&apos;t use their axes to demolish bits of the level, either).

This is convenient because sometimes when you arrive near a Victim, you&apos;ll see
that they are in danger, about to be killed by some Monster, and that you
definitely cannot do anything in time. What should be your reaction? Well,
perhaps you should consider just walking away - if you do that, then you could
easily manage to escape from the scene before the Zombie (or whatever it is)
makes the kill. If that happens, the Victim lives on, and you have another
chance. Remember, it&apos;s not over until you hear them scream!

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

c) WHERE TO START PLAYING? srch2c

How long do you want your game of Zombies to be? Do you want to finish in an
hour of play? Less time? Or do you want to spend the afternoon playing through
all 55 levels from the start? The position in the game where you start playing
affects not only how long your game will take (if you intend to finish it), but
also how easy a time you&apos;ll have of it. To take either extreme: those who start
at level 1 (or even on level 1&apos;s bonus level) will have a much easier time than
those who start on level 45.

The reason why playing for longer makes the game easier is mainly to do with
collecting items. If you start on an early level and stockpile your items as
you rise through the levels, you will arrive at the end boss with a stack of
weaponry with which you can easily beat him. However, if you start nearer to
the boss, you will not have nearly as much at hand to fight him with. You might
want to sweep through the bosses in the game with ease - or you might be hoping
for more of a challenge. Anyway, whatever difficulty you hope to experience,
check this table for advice on where to start:

 START LEVEL | DIFFICULTY OF GAME
-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
 1 or 1-B | This is the easiest of the lot. You will have no problem beating
 | the game starting here - but it will take you a while...
 5 | This is still a very easy place to start... and it will still
 | take you a long time to finish the game if you start from this
 | point.
 9 | This is not quite as easy as starting at the previous two
 | milestones, but you won&apos;t have any major problems.
 13 | This is where the difficulty level starts to get a little more
 | noticeable. You will have difficulty on the first few levels you
 | play, but by the time you reach the end of the game, they&apos;ll be
 | things of the past and you&apos;ll find it as easy as anyone else.
 17 | Start here and you&apos;ll have a tougher time of things. The first
 | few levels are hard to clear from starting with just Water
 | Pistol and a First Aid Kit; but as with level 13 you&apos;ll be
 | coping fine by the end of the game.
 21 | This is actually an easier place to start than level 17, as the
 | first few levels are not too bad. You won&apos;t find it hard.
 25 | Halfway through and it&apos;s still not all that challenging. You can
 | still get through the last level easily, although it&apos;s not as
 | effortless as starting from level 1.
 29 | Starting from here, you&apos;ll find the first two levels difficult
 | because of a lack of Keys. We are moving into harder territory
 | here; you&apos;ll find the boss on level 36 something of an obstacle.
 33 | The difficulty here takes a sharp turn upwards. There&apos;s a boss
 | on level 36, and to beat him you&apos;ll need to put in a top
 | performance. Afterwards, your health and item stocks will be
 | shattered, and you will need to recover well to be ready for the
 | final boss on level 48.
 37 | Starting here is considerably easier than starting on level 33,
 | because you will not just have fought a major boss from only
 | four levels&apos; preparation. You will find the end-of-game boss
 | tough, but not too tough.
 41 | This is just the right level to start on if you want a good,
 | challenging assault on the level 48 boss. It&apos;s hard, but not
 | excruciatingly so.
 45 | You must be either a highly skilled player, or just crazy to
 | begin playing here. You&apos;ll be given a beating by the four
 | super-tough levels at the end of the game, and you&apos;re very
 | unlikely to get through them.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

d) KEEPING YOUR VICTIM NUMBERS HIGH srch2d

You already know (if you read section one of this guide) about the Victim
Provision Order and the way that Extra Bonus Victims work, but how do you take
advantage of it to make sure you always have as many Victims as you can manage?
Of course, you must make sure to protect your Victims well, but the other thing
you must do is to replace them when they die - which is to say, you must earn
enough points for an Extra Bonus Victim, so that they are returned to you.

For every level during which you break through a new multiple of 40,000 points,
you earn an Extra Bonus Victim. So, score a lot of points. The best way to do
this is:

- If there are areas where a particular type of Monster spawns fast, and you
 have good weapons to use on them, go there and have a ball. Zombies are great
 for this, as they only take one hit with the Water Pistol to kill, and you
 get 100 points a pop. Meanwhile, Werewolves are harder to kill and don&apos;t give
 as much value for the ammo you have to use (plus, the best weapon for the
 job - Silverware - is in short supply, and you don&apos;t want to run out of it).
- Do all the optional stuff on the map. There is generally a variety of things
 you can do, from killing Pod Plants, and tough enemies such as the
 Lumberjacks, to collecting out-of-the-way Bonus Points Pickups. These things
 all earn you points, so do them.
- Earn all of the bonuses. This ties in closely with the second point above,
 because it&apos;s as a result of going out of your way to do everything that you
 get most bonuses. All of the bonuses that the game awards are listed in the
 section just below; those of them that are awarded on a level, are listed in
 the level data section in the walkthrough. The bonuses that are added to your
 points total on the screen at the end of the level, definitely do count
 towards your Extra Bonus Victim.

You should realise that if you have ten Victims and you earn an Extra Bonus
Victim, you will receive an Extra Bonus Player (an Extra Life) instead. If you
have ten Victims and six lives (the maximum), you will be given the&quot;Perfect
Player Bonus&quot;(5000 points) to help you towards your next target. So, it is
never a waste of time to earn points (unless you do it in a really pointlessly
slow and/or hazardous way, such as trying to kill huge numbers of Jelly Blobs).
Remember that if you are playing in the two-player mode, it is possible for
both players to earn Extra Bonus Victims on the same level, thus supplying two
replacement Victims.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

e) A LIST OF THE BONUSES srch2e

Victim Collection Bonuses:

- 50 points per Victim saved, up to a maximum of 500 points per player.
- All Victims Saved Bonus - 1000 points - Save ten Victims.
- Ten Cheerleaders Bonus - 1000 points - Save all ten Victims in the level.
 This bonus is awarded on three levels - but oddly, one of them (level 47)
 has only six Cheerleaders to save, in addition to four Victims of other
 varieties. On levels 12 and 47 this replaces the All Victims Saved Bonus,
 but on level 30 it&apos;s awarded in addition to it. (Levels 12, 30 and 47)
- You Saved More Victims Bonus - 1000 points - If you&apos;re playing a two-player
 game, and one of the players collects more Victims in a level than the
 other, he will receive this bonus.

Other Bonuses:

- Alien Invasion Repulsed - 9900 points - Destroy the Martian Spaceship by
 throwing ten Soda Cans into the hatch when it opens. (Levels 12 and 21)
- Axeman Begone Bonus - 5000 points - Kill all the Crazy Lumberjacks on the
 level. (Levels 4, 34 and 46)
- Bonus for Pass Completion - 5000 points - Successfully pass American
 Footballs to ten or more American Football Players. (Levels 12 and 47)
- Chainsaw Begone Bonus - See&quot;Axeman Begone Bonus&quot;.
- Extermination Bonus - Kill a lot of Ants. (Levels 16 and 32)
- Fish Fry Bonus - 1000 points - Kill a lot of Squidmen. (Levels 18, 33, 35, 38
 and 40)
- Massive Destruction - 2000 points - Make sure the level is a mess by the time
 you leave. That means tearing down as many hedges or walls as you can -
 with a little help... (Levels 4, 34 and 46)
- No Bazooka Fired Bonus - 1000 points - Simple! Don&apos;t fire any Bazookas.
 (Levels 4, 16, 22-B, 34, 46)
- Secret Bonus - 2000 points - This is usually awarded when you have collected
 a Bonus Level Pickup, and usually indicates that you are about to enter a
 bonus level. On level 12 you earn your bonus points and bonus level
 by collecting all ten Victims. On level 47, as well, it is awarded if you
 collect all ten Victims - so that you get a total of 3000 points for
 doing so - despite the fact that you are not taken to a bonus level
 afterwards. (Levels 1, 9, 12, 17, 22, 33 and 47)
- Weed Cutting Bonus - 1000 points - Sweep up a large quantity of weeds over
 the course of the level. Killing Pod Plants does not affect your
 chances of getting this bonus. (Levels 9, 9-B, 11, 26, 36 and 44)
- Vampire Destroyed - Kill both Vampires. (Level 39)

[Extra Bonus Victim variants - See Above]:

- Extra Bonus Victim - A new Victim, to replace one who has previously died.
- Extra Bonus Player - This is an Extra Life, given to you if you break an
 Extra Bonus Victim score barrier, but you already have ten Victims.
- Perfect Player Bonus - 5000 points - This is given to you if you break an
 Extra Bonus Victim score barrier, but you already have ten Victims and
 six lives.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

f) CHEAT: AVOIDING THE FINAL BOSS FIGHT - ***SPOILERS*** srch2f

Level 48&apos;s final boss fight can be entirely avoided by exploiting the level
design - there is a way to bypass it and exit the map prematurely, which will
nevertheless result in the game behaving as though you killed the boss
properly. Although the level contains an important boss whom the game&apos;s plot
demands you must destroy, the only element of the game&apos;s mechanics that
actually prevents you from leaving the level is the fact that you are not able
to access the&quot;Always There&quot;Victim, a Cheerleader, until the boss has died;
and so the Exit Door will not appear - as it only appears when all of the
Victims are gone from the level.

However, it is possible to get that Cheerleader (A) killed, and when this is
done you can (after the other Victims are also gone) cause the Exit Door to
appear, allowing you to leave - whether the boss is dead or not. (You will
obviously need more than one Victim, because if you only had the one, you would
fail the game as soon as you allowed her to die.)

What you need to do is to provoke the Vampire into following you, and go
through the level without killing him. When you are through to the boss arena,
walk into the northwest corner and wait there. The Vampire will arrive and
attack you with his bat missiles; wait until your health bar empties, and you
lose a life and faint. (So, you obviously need at least two lives, as well as
at least two Victims.)

At this point, the Vampire flies north, over the wall, into the dungeon that
holds the Cheerleader (A). If you continue to wait in the corner of the boss
arena, he will proceed to kill her. (This may take him a short while.) This
will result in the Exit Door opening up immediately, provided that you have
collected all the other Victims. Of course, if you don&apos;t then go on to
conscientiously kill the boss, this does not mean that you&apos;ve properly finished
the game - it&apos;s just an exploit arising from some ill-thought-out level design.

1) RESCUE THE NEIGHBOURS IN: LEVEL 1: ZOMBIE PANIC srch301

-----

DIFFICULTY: 1/10

Well, it is the first level... It&apos;s not even possible to lose all the Victims
if you enter the level in the regular fashion, because there&apos;s a Pool Guy but
no Squidmen. I say&quot;one&quot;... you would probably have to make an effort to lose
all three of your lives on this level.

NEW MONSTER: Zombie

MONSTER LIST: Zombies [Normal] (intensity: ranges from very low to high,
 location: everywhere)

VICTIM LIST: (Note: As it is not possible to access this level with less than
 three Victims - unless you use a cheat device or something like
 that - three of the Victims are considered to be&quot;always there&quot;.)

 A) Teacher - Northwest of your start point, standing by the western wall.
 A) Barbecue Guy - North from where you start, in the picnic area in the
 northwest corner of the level.
 A) Tourists - North from where you start, standing near the Barbecue Guy (A)
 in the picnic area.
 4) Cheerleader - On the lawn just northwest of your start location.
 5) Cheerleader - In the northeast corner of the level, south of a small hut
 containing a Fire Extinguisher.
 6) Dog - Near the northeast corner of the level, between two flowerbeds to the
 west of the Cheerleaders (5 and 9).
 7) Baby - Northwest of where you start, near the picnic area.
 8) Swimming Pool Guy - In the pool, roughly in the centre of the level.
 9) Cheerleader - In the northeast corner of the map, alongside Cheerleader #5.
10) Baby - In a hut at the northern edge of the map, to the northeast of the
 picnic area. You&apos;ll need a Key to get in.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bonus Level Pickup (if you have Bazookas, or get some during
 the level)
 First Aid Kit (ditto)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Secret Bonus - 2000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The graveyard. But you&apos;d have to use
practically all your ammo to meet the first Extra Bonus Victim target, so don&apos;t
bother going that far.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. Walk northwest and you&apos;ll find first a Cheerleader (4) and then a Teacher
(A). North of the Teacher is a Bin; open it then head northeast. You&apos;ll come to
a Key, followed by a Baby (7) and then a Barbecue Guy (A). North of the
Barbecue Guy is a Tourist Couple (A); to their east is a Water Pistol. Past the
end of the bench, head south and a little west to find another bench with Soda
Cans on the floor nearby. From the Soda Cans, head southeast, through a gap in
the wall, and dive into the swimming pool. In the middle is a Swimming Pool Guy
(8). Jump out again to the northwest and head due north.

2. You come to a hedge; head east from here and you&apos;ll see a door to your
north. Go inside to find a Baby (10) and a Cupboard. Exit and head southeast
and you&apos;ll come to a pair of trampolines side-by-side. Jump onto one and then
jump off east into a walled-off yard with a Key inside. Exit the yard via the
western gap in the hedge to your south. Continue south, keeping west of the
gravestones, until you come to a batch of toxic waste barrels next to a pond.
Walk east and dive in where the pond extends to the north, and swim east past a
little island with more barrels on it to come out of the water on a muddy strip
of land.

3. Head southeast around the edge of the other, smaller pond to find a Key.
Return north along that strip of land to arrive back on the edge of the
graveyard area, where there&apos;s a Water Pistol lying on the ground. Having
collected that, head north, through a gap in the gravestones, and northwest
over to what looks like a large square of greenery. There&apos;s actually a passage
through there under the ivy - just walk into the eastern side and out the
north. You come out into another grassy area; head northwest for a Dog (6), and
from him, go east to find two Cheerleaders (5 and 9) practising their technique
together. Before leaving, head northwest into the hut for a Fire Extinguisher
and a Cupboard to open. You need that Fire Extinguisher on level 4.

IF YOU HAVE BAZOOKAS:

4. If you&apos;re carrying Bazookas or a suitable Potion, from whatever source, then
head west from the hut all the way across the gardens, past the trampolines and
the first hut, to find a hedge block on the north wall. This can be demolished
by firing Bazookas at the front; go inside to find a Bonus Level Pickup, which
will let you into the bonus level when the current level ends. (If you just
came from there then you can still go one last time - and all the Victims
you&apos;re due, and all the items, will be replaced.)

5. Exit south and return all the way east to where the exit door is, but if you
have Bazookas still remaining, don&apos;t go through yet; instead, examine the
wooden fence to the north. The sections with the splintered tops are weak, so
blast one of them down and step through. There&apos;s a First Aid Kit, hidden by the
fence, near the eastern wall of the hut. Walk southwest, pushing into the
fence, to pick it up (you&apos;ll hear a&quot;bleep&quot;when you do). That&apos;s the last
pickup left on the map, so leave the fenced off area and make use of the Exit
Door.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

1-B) BONUS LEVEL: DAY OF THE TENTACLE srch3b01

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

Tentacles can be evil when it comes to getting to Victims quickly. Be quick,
and be sure to provide defensive shots as you approach. Precisely four Victims
on this level are in bad places, so there&apos;s potential to do very badly out of a
visit. But you&apos;ve got to play the level at least once, right?

NOTE: This level is what is termed an&quot;Easter egg&quot;- a noticeable feature in a
game that also serves as a heavy reference to another, unrelated game made by
the same developer or publisher. In this case, the game being alluded to is
Maniac Mansion Two: Day of the Tentacle, a comedy adventure game for the PC
that runs on the ancient MS-DOS operating system. Day of the Tentacle was the
work of LucasArts, who were Zombies&apos; developers.

NEW MONSTERS: Tentacle
 Pod Plant (new if you haven&apos;t played beyond level 4 before)

MONSTER LIST: Pod Plant (one)
 Tentacles (location: nearly everywhere)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Barbecue Guy - In the garden accessed by opening the Skull Door and then
 passing through the second, isolated area of the house.
 2) Swimming Pool Guy - Safe in the swimming pool, in the same garden where the
 Barbecue Guy (A) is.
 3) Soldier - Standing at the side of the road, in the southeast corner of the
 map.
 4) Cheerleader - At the northern edge of the level, past a patch of weeds,
 standing by the Skeleton Key. Access this area by heading north along the
 eastern side of the level.
 5) Trampoline Girl - In the southeast corner of the yard just behind the Skull
 Door.
 6) Baby - At the western end of the road which runs along the southern side of
 the map.
 7) Soldier - Towards the eastern end of the road at the southern side of the
 level, but west a little way from the other Soldier (3).
 8) Baby - In an alleyway leading out of the northeast corner of the house, at
 the northern edge of the level.
 9) Teacher - In the second room, inside the isolated section of the house
 which is behind the Skull Door.
10) Swimming Pool Guy - At the southern end of the green pond on the eastern
 side of the level.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bazooka (Lets you re-enter once, if you used the password)
 First Aid Kit
 Weedkiller (before its normal first appearance)
 Martian Bubble Gun (before its normal first appearance)
 Extra Life

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The road; tentacles appear fast there, and
they are equivalent to Zombies, as far as points per Water Pistol shot goes.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Head north to the wall first, then west and collect a Baby (6); you ought to
fire a few Water Pistol shots in case of the sudden appearance of a Tentacle.
Now walk to the south side of the road and head eastwards until you find Water
Pistol ammo. Go back to the north side and then continue east to find two
Soldiers (7 and then 3), one after the other. Again, firing in advance could be
a tactic that pays off, particularly for #7. After you have saved both, collect
a Bazooka pickup to the south of #3&apos;s position, and then move west for a Key.
Your Bazooka ammo is important; don&apos;t use it as an offensive weapon yet.

2. Walk all the way west along the road back to where the Baby (6) was; you can
see a First Aid Kit to your north, past a hedge. Blast through with Bazooka
fire and get it, then blast the hedge block to its west. You can now go through
an alleyway to a large garden containing nowt but a Weedkiller pickup, which
will be useful in a moment. Exit the garden the way you came in and once more,
go east along the road, past the Skull Door, until you see a gap in the hedge
to your north. Head in there, go east for a Key, and then north into another
large garden. In the southwest corner is a Water Pistol.

3. Move north and jump into the green water to save a Swimming Pool Guy (10),
somewhat improbably enjoying himself in the slime. After him you can swim to
the northeast bank for a Mystery Potion. Jump out of the water past the opening
in the fence and go west. Once at the wall, head south and then west into a
ruined bathroom, and find a Baby (8) in the alleyway to the north. Back in the
house, walk west along the passage and open a Cupboard. Go through the door to
the north, open another Cupboard, and head out of this room into a
weed-infested back yard.

4. Cut through the weeds and kill the Pod Plant with your Weedkiller, then
continue to use the Weedkiller while walking west until out of the weed patch.
You&apos;ll find a Cheerleader (4) and a Skeleton Key. It&apos;s time to head all the way
back to the Skull Door... remember the way? East through the weeds, southeast
into the house, south into the passage, east all the way to the pond, swim
south, head south through the garden to the road at the end, and head west
until you see the Skull Door in the north wall. Go through, and then over to
the east; collect a Trampoline Girl (5).

5. Jump off the trampoline to the west. If you have some, then switch your
weapon to Soda Cans. Walk north, through the door, and lob one over the wall
ahead quickly if there are any Tentacles in there - otherwise, they&apos;ll kill the
Teacher (9). Collect another Key to your west, and open a Cupboard and then the
door over to the east. Walk through to the north, walk west (while throwing
another Soda Can west just in case), and collect the Teacher (9) quickly.

6. Collect Decoy Clowns and a Key, and open a Cupboard, then head east quickly,
as there is another Victim in danger while you stand in this room. Open a door,
collect a Martian Bubble Gun, and head west and out of the building. Move
southwest as soon as you can, and collect a Barbecue Guy (A). As with the first
three Victims, fire a couple of shots as you approach to protect him.
Northwards is another Swimming Pool Guy (2) in unappealing water. Emerge at the
west side of the pool and collect an Extra Life, then leave through the Exit
Door.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

2) LEVEL 2: EVENING OF THE UNDEAD srch302

-----

DIFFICULTY: 2/10

Some of the Victims are in mild danger of kicking the bucket if you&apos;re new to
the game. There are still two which the Zombies can&apos;t get at. Zombies are
everywhere, but they don&apos;t spawn very fast.

MONSTER LIST: Zombies [Normal] (intensity: medium, location: everywhere)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Soldier - Standing by a couple of Bazooka pickups, just east of where you
 start.
 2) Swimming Pool Guy - In the pool northeast of where you start, past the long
 hedge. Blast through or go around to the east.
 3) Barbecue Guy - In the garden north from where you start, past the long
 hedge. Again, blast through or take the long route to pick up more Victims.
 4) Cheerleader - In the northeast corner of the tree-filled area which is in
 the southeast corner of the map.
 5) Baby - In the house on the western side of the level. There&apos;s an open door
 at the northern side of the building.
 6) Explorer - Standing by some waste drums in the northeast corner of the map.
 7) Trampoline Girl - At the southern edge of the garden to the north, through
 the hedge, from where you start.
 8) Cheerleader - At the northern edge of the level, at the corner of a strip
 of tarmac with some Bonus Points Pickups on it.
 9) Teacher - Just to the north of the house where the Baby (5) is.
10) Explorer - At the northern end of the alleyway on the western edge of the
 level, just west of the house where the Baby (5) is.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Your first Bazookas (if you didn&apos;t visit DOTT)
 Monster Potion
 Decoy Clowns

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The area where you start.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Head east to find a Soldier (A), standing just north of two Bazooka pickups.
Go east again until you come to the end of the hedge to your north, and then
walk northeast over to a corner where you&apos;ll find a Cheerleader (4) near a
tree. Head west past a tree and a trampoline and dive into the water for a
Swimming Pool Guy (2). Exit the swimming pool by jumping out the western side,
and head first northwest for a Barbecue Guy (3) and then south for a Trampoline
Girl (7). Jump north off the trampoline, and then head northeast from the
barbecue grill for a Bin.

2. Walk east and past the protruding hedge to the north, and then head
northeast and into an alcove for Soda Cans. Switch to your Bazookas, head round
the front of the hedge block to the east, and blow it up. Inside is a Mystery
Potion; collect it then head southeast, through a hole in the hedge and north.
You come to a choice of routes; take the eastern one and when the alleyway
opens out, go northeast for a Bin. Continue northeast from there to find an
Explorer (6) behind some waste drums.

3. Having saved him, head around the waste drums and south over to what looks
like a massive hedge to your south. It actually isn&apos;t - there are three hidden
passages through under the greenery. To enter the first one, just continue
south. Once in, head east to exit. Walk a little south from there, so as to
line yourself up with the mass of ivy that&apos;s visible sticking out to the west,
and then walk west again into another passage. At its end, head north into a
dead end containing a Water Pistol. Head south and east again, then head south
to the end of the alley, where you&apos;ll find a Key. Head through the final
passage to your west, and you&apos;ll find a Bonus Points Pickup where you come out.

4. Continue west, through a couple of holes in the hedge, past the grill where
the Barbecue Guy (3) was standing earlier, and you&apos;ll come to a Bin. Open it
and then give the same treatment to a door to the south. Inside this little hut
are a Water Pistol and a Cupboard. Exit the hut and head northwest; you come to
a wall that has the entrance to another of those hidden passageways in it. Walk
into the part that looks entirely green, and then walk to the north end of the
alleyway to find an Explorer (10). There might just be a Zombie about to attack
him, so be ready with your Water Pistol.

5. A short distance to the east of the alley&apos;s exit is a Teacher (9), also in
possible peril. Enter the house to your south to find a Cupboard. Head into the
doorway to the south of this and go over to the west to find a second Cupboard.
Return east and north, and then west for a Baby (5) and a Monster Potion (in
the southwest corner of the building). There&apos;s a Cupboard to the north of the
Potion; around the kitchen unit to the north is a final one. Head east and exit
the house through the northern door, and use your Bazookas to blast down the
front of the hedge block to the north. This gets you some Decoy Clowns (useful
for level 4.) Head due east to save a Cheerleader (8), and pick up the Bonus
Points Pickups scattered around to her southwest before exiting.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

3) LEVEL 3: TERROR IN AISLE FIVE srch303

-----

DIFFICULTY: 2/10

The difficulty isn&apos;t noticeably higher than that of level 2, despite the
appearance of a new type of monster - Evil Dolls. Also, a more tenacious
variety of Zombie (the&quot;Vicious Zombie&quot;, as I call it) can be found in the
southeast corner of the map, but you don&apos;t need to go there unless you want to
rack up bonus points (as Zombies spawn very quickly there).

NEW MONSTERS: Evil Doll
 Fire Baby
 Vicious Zombie

MONSTER LIST: Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from very low to
 very high, location: nearly everywhere)
 Evil Dolls (intensity: low, location: patchy)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - In the back room of the grocery shop in the northwest corner
 of the level. Head through the door to the north and go east.
 2) Soldier - Standing just southeast of where you start.
 3) Baby - Standing still on the&quot;up&quot;escalator, just northwest of your start
 location.
 4) Soldier - Standing with #2, just southeast of where you start.
 5) Tourists - At the front of the store on the eastern side of the level, in
 danger from the Evil Dolls.
 6) Cheerleader - In the northeast corner of the clothes shop to the north of
 the escalators.
 7) Tourists - In the far corner of a dingy shop, near the southwest corner of
 the map, second along from the slightly larger store containing a Baby (9).
 8) Baby - Standing in an aisle, at the western side of the store in the
 northwest corner of the level.
 9) Baby - Behind the counter, in the store in the southwest corner of the map.
10) Cheerleader - On the balcony, accessed by heading east from the top of the
 escalator and then south.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit
 Three Decoy Clowns pickups

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Get right into the southeast corner, near
where you start. Zombies pop up from the ground at a made rate here.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Directly you start, move southeast and save the two Soldiers (4 and 2)
quickly. After that, head northwest and collect the Baby (3) who is somehow
remaining motionless while standing on the&quot;up&quot;escalator. You should now head
back down onto the lower floor and Bazooka-blast two shop windows to the
northeast of the escalators, for a First Aid Kit and Decoy Clowns. When you&apos;re
finished looting, head southwest from the smashed windows and up the escalator
once more. Walk east along the raised area over to a protruding balcony, for a
Cheerleader (10).

2. Walk north and you&apos;ll reach a shop. Don&apos;t waste a Key on opening the door;
walk through the broken shop window and quickly rescue the Tourists (5) to the
north, who are about to get scalped by Evil Dolls. There are two Water Pistols
to the west, around the display. Head north and out the back of the shop to
find a Key, in the dead end to the east. Return south through the shop and out
through one of the broken windows again.

3. Move west, and enter the next door to the north. It&apos;s an
unimpressive-looking clothes shop. Head into the northeast corner for a
Cheerleader (6), and then over into the northwest to find Speed Shoes next to a
display mannequin. Head southeast and out the front door, and then southwest
past the escalators. Ignore the shop to the north, and the first open door to
the south, and use the second entrance on the south side. To the south, past a
ruined display of goods and the cash register, is a Baby (9). Behind the till,
he&apos;s probably safe from the Evil Dolls and Zombies, but collect him quickly
anyway.

4. On the other side of the counter, in the middle of the shop floor, are Decoy
Clowns. Pick them up, and then head north to exit this store, and then east.
You may now head south into the other shop on the south side, which you ignored
earlier for the Baby&apos;s (9) sake, and in it you&apos;ll find a Tourist Couple (7) in
the southwest corner, in complete safety. Head northeast and leave the shop,
and then walk over to the western edge of the level. To the north of there is
the entrance to a supermarket. North past the tills and an (inactive) display
of&quot;Fun Baby&quot;boxes is an aisle containing an abandoned Baby (8).

5. You&apos;ll find Soda Cans to the northwest, in a corner. Head back south again,
east alongside the tills, and you&apos;ll come to a bay containing Decoy Clowns. Go
north of here, around a fruit and veg display, to find two pickups of Tomatoes.
Get through the back door, to the north, by whatever means you see fit. Take
the second right and carry on until you come to two pickups of Ice Lollies; now
double back and take the southern corridor east for a Cheerleader (A) and a
Mystery Potion. There are no more items, but don&apos;t exit just yet - read the
preamble to level 4, below, so that you&apos;re ready.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

4) LEVEL 4: LUMBERJACK HEDGEMAZE MAYHEM srch304

(U.S.&quot;LEVEL 4: CHAINSAW HEDGEMAZE MAYHEM&quot;)

-----

DIFFICULTY: 5/10

While the previous three levels increased in difficulty in small gradations,
this is more of a challenge, especially if you don&apos;t know how to deal with it.

NEW MONSTER: Lumberjack

MONSTER LIST: Lumberjacks (seven)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Barbecue Guy - In the clear area at the northern side of the level. You
 need to get all the way through the maze to reach him.
 2) Cheerleader - Near the eastern side of the level, in a dead end passage
 guarded by a Lumberjack.
 3) Baby - In a small cell, accessed through an ivy-covered passageway, to the
 west of the Cheerleader (2).
 4) Tourists - At the northern end of a clear area near the southern edge of
 the level.
 5) Explorer - To the west of where you start, past a few hedges, standing to
 the east of an ivy-covered passageway.
 6) Explorer - North of your start location, through a hedge, and to the west
 of the hedge block holding a First Aid Kit.
 7) Teacher - Standing in a dead end, near the western side of the level.
 8) Trampoline Girl - In the southwest corner of the level.
 9) Tourists - West of where you start, past a hedge, in a small clearing.
10) Tourists - Standing by a bench in the southeast corner of the map.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Monster Potion
 First Aid Kit

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 No Bazooka Fired Bonus - 1000 points
 Massive Destruction - 2000 points
 Axeman Begone Bonus - 5000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: You can&apos;t obtain limitless points on this
level - once all the Lumberjacks are dead, they&apos;re all dead. Go for the
bonuses, though, because some of them pay out a lot of points.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. This level is quite different to the three previous ones. As soon as you
move beyond your starting point, you&apos;ll be challenged by at least one Crazy
Lumberjack. These are high-powered enemies that are able to move around the
level on their own once they have become alerted to your presence. They can&apos;t
kill Victims unless you are nearby; however, they have a tendency to gang up
against you if you let them, and they can destroy hedge sections (as with your
Bazooka) to get to you.

2. I&apos;ve described a FAST method of getting through the maze, which involves
killing every Lumberjack as you find him. You may not manage to get it done
very fast the first time around, and so you might lose your monster form too
early; however, you can use an alternative method to kill the last few
Lumberjacks, as described below. A certain amount of intuition, sense of
direction and reasonable short-term memory regarding the route you&apos;ve taken is
assumed for this walkthrough. This maze is, after all, a complicated layout for
a level!

3. An alternative method for killing Lumberjacks (use on the last one, and any
which you encounter after both your Monster Potions have worn off): Blast with
the Fire Extinguisher (ten blasts should do it), and then fire at him with the
Water Pistol until he explodes (about fifty to seventy-five shots will be
enough). Your shots will appear to go right through him, but that doesn&apos;t mean
they aren&apos;t hurting him. If he comes back to life at any time and attacks you,
it&apos;s because you didn&apos;t use enough Fire Extinguisher; freeze him again and
carry on shooting.

4. You may decide to just freeze and run, or to make use of the Decoy Clowns;
it&apos;s all good, but remember that you get a fat package of bonus points if you
kill all seven Lumberjacks. If both Monster Potions wear off and you want to
get through a hedge, you can look for a way round, get a Lumberjack to bust it
for you, or use your Bazooka (which will bar you from the No Bazooka Fired
Bonus).

VICTIMS:

5. Head northeast from your start point, without relaxing the controls, and go
east once in the passageway north of the tree, to find a hedge block to the
north. At this point, use the Monster Potion you picked up on level 2. Punch
through the front, pick up another Monster Potion, and head out and west. (Be
aware that at some point a little later on, your Monster Potion will wear out;
you should switch to and use the second one when this happens.) When you come
to another hedge block to your north, punch it open and then nip in for a First
Aid Kit.

6. You can see an Explorer (6) to the north of your path; bash through and save
him. Go west, and when you find your first Crazy Lumberjack, walk up to him and
start punching. He may fall over occasionally, but just keep on punching until
he explodes. Now punch through the hedge to your south, head west for Tourists
(9) and punch through two more hedges to the west for another Explorer (5).
Walk south from the Explorer, punching through hedges, until you meet another
Crazy Lumberjack. Punch him out as you did the first one; then punch through
hedges for an easily visible Teacher (7), and southeast of her, a Tourist
Couple (4).

7. Return to the passage that held the Teacher and head east. You&apos;ll find a
Lumberjack to your north; beat him about and then carry on heading east. Punch
open a third hedge block, to your north, to get a Fire Extinguisher, then knock
down a hedge to your south to find a Baby (3). Walk south through an ivy-hung
passage and carry on to the east. Assault greenery to your north to obtain a
Cheerleader (2) and then carry on northeast and engage a Lumberjack in combat.

8. When he is dead, move south and punch through a few hedges to reach a
Tourist Couple (10) and then north all the way along the eastern edge of the
level. You&apos;ll come to another Lumberjack along the way; cane him and move on.
At the end of a long walk is a hedge for you to plough through, with a hedge
block directly north. There is a Lumberjack concealed inside, so knock down the
entrance and give him what for. When he is dead, head out and west, and knock
down the door to a small room (you cannot get the cupboard inside yet -
punching it open will not yield any items!) Further west is a Barbecue Guy (A)
and hedges. Knock at least one hedge section down, because at the end of the
enclosed yard is a Bin and two Bazooka Pickups.

9. Now, wait until you have returned to human form. Open the bin, and return
east to open the cupboard inside the little hut, then head southeast from the
barbecue grill, and east when you reach the wall. The last victim is at the
opposite corner of the level, but can&apos;t be killed by the one remaining
Lumberjack, which is why I&apos;ve ignored her until now. Depending on whether you
want to go for the fairly self-explanatory No Bazooka Fired Bonus, I have
prepared two different routes you may take, one much longer than the other...
Following are directions through the maze to the last Victim: a Trampoline Girl
(8). (These routes do not take any collapsed hedges for granted.)

10. USING BAZOOKAS: Ignore turning, head south at clearing, blast three
southward hedges, move southwest, go into ivy tunnel, blast hedge down to north
(if it is still standing after you came through here earlier), go west until
you come to a dead end; then blast through south (again, if hedge is not
already blasted down), walk around a couple of inconvenient hedges, head
southwest and blast the northernmost of the hedge intersections to get through
to the trampoline.

11. NOT USING BAZOOKAS: Ignore turning, take northern route at clearing, go
south at first opportunity and take pre-demolished fence slightly to the east,
head south until you reach the southeast corner of the level, head west, north
and west again at fork, freeze Lumberjack with fire extinguisher (about ten
blasts only needed). (At this point you can finish him off if you want by
squirting him with your Water Pistol until he explodes, or leave him if you
want to get more useful items and perhaps the Massive Destruction points bonus
later.) Head past him, west, and around all the bends. Next time you have a
choice other than demolished hedges, go north, around some hedges, north again
(without using any chance gaps in hedges, remember) and find a long passage
east. First chance you get, head north and then west. Ignore the T-junction, go
through an ivy-covered tunnel and then head south to the trampoline.

PICKUPS:

12. Far north of the trampoline, still on the western edge of the level, are
two ivy tunnels - the southern one is used in the non-Bazooka route, above,
while the northern one is a dead end and contains Bonus Points Pickups. After
you have these, go to the place where the last Lumberjack is to be found
(return south to the trampoline and jump east, head east along the passage
skirting the southern wall of the level, and turn north at the corner). Even if
you disturbed him before, he shouldn&apos;t be far from where you left him.

13. Have this last Lumberjack follow you through the level, massacring innocent
greenery as he goes (for the Massive Destruction bonus). It is possible to
control him safely if you know what you&apos;re doing. Go to stand on the other side
of a hedge from him, and he&apos;ll walk into it and (usually) knock it down. As you
get more experienced, you&apos;ll have more of an insight into what he&apos;s going to
do, and when, and you can use this knowledge to your advantage. Once you&apos;ve
finished, kill the Lumberjack with the Fire Extinguisher/Water Pistol combo,
and exit.

5) LEVEL 5: WEIRD KIDS ON THE BLOCK srch305

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

Three new monsters, but only one is of any concern - and you&apos;ll soon master
those overgrown weeds. There are one or two Victims who might get in a spot of
trouble, admittedly, but don&apos;t let that music get you down. Smile! :)

NEW MONSTERS: Doppelganger
 Mushroom Men
 Pod Plant (new unless you visited Day of the Tentacle)

MONSTER LIST: Doppelganger [Normal] (intensity: low, location: nearly
 everywhere)
 Mushroom Men (intensity: low, location: in two places)
 Pod Plant (three)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - At the far end of an alleyway to the south of a patch of
 weeds, in the southwest corner of the level.
 2) Soldier - In a small yard in the northeast corner of the level.
 3) Swimming Pool Guy - In a yard in the southeast corner of the level.
 4) Barbecue Guy - At the northwest corner of a large empty yard, just
 southeast from where you start. Head around to the south to get in.
 5) Teacher - Near a patch of weeds and south of a house, at the eastern edge
 of the level.
 6) Baby - In the southern room, in the house in the centre of the level.
 7) Baby - In a one-room house at the western edge of the level, accessed from
 a yard where Doppelgangers spawn.
 8) Cheerleader - In the northern room of the house in the southwest corner of
 the level.
 9) Baby - In an alleyway near the centre of the level, west of a patch of
 weeds. He may be in danger from Doppelgangers as you approach.
10) Dog - Sitting next to the fence, in the northeast corner of the yard
 accessed through the southern door out of the house in the centre of the
 map. An alternative way to reach the Dog is to use the trampoline to the
 north of the fence.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Your first Weedkiller (if you didn&apos;t visit DOTT)
 Bazookas
 Two First Aid Kits
 Your first Silverware
 Your first Plates

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: This level is not a good place to score
points at all. Doppelgangers only give twenty points per kill, after all. Wait
for level 6 or level 7.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Collect the Weedkiller; that pickup is double value, giving you 600
ammunition. You&apos;d normally get only 300 for such a Weedkiller pickup. Go east
to the end of the road, where you can find a Bin. Head southeast to find a path
between a house and a hedgerow; go east and north round the hedge and into a
small yard. You&apos;ll find a Soldier (2) at the far end, hoarding Bazookas, and a
Pod Plant. The Soldier may be murdered by the Mushroom Men that very
occasionally appear here, so get him first and then dispose of the Pod Plant
either by ploughing into it with your Weedkiller or with a well-aimed Bazooka
shot. (You&apos;ll take damage if you walk on the weeds that the Pod Plant produces
- clear them away with the Weedkiller as well.)

2. Exit the yard the way you came in and walk down the eastern alleyway. You&apos;ll
find a Key near the end, and come out near a Teacher (5). Kill the second Pod
Plant, to the northwest, and you&apos;ll find a Key hidden underneath. (Note that if
a Pod Plant is sitting on top of something and you wade right in to kill it,
then you could pick the item up without noticing - from now on, if I say that a
Pod Plant hides an item and you can&apos;t find it, that&apos;s why.) Directly north of
here is a house; inside are three Cupboards and a First Aid Kit. Don&apos;t bother
opening the locked door in here; exit the house again, and skirt around the
western side and north to find another open door to a room with one Cupboard in
it.

3. Now exit again, go back down south to where the weeds were, and then go west
into a hedge-lined alleyway. There&apos;s a Baby (9) at the end, and you&apos;ll do no
harm by firing a couple of Water Pistol shots ahead of you to try and
neutralise any Doppelgangers who might otherwise strike it lucky. Now head
south, west and round the bendy bit for a Key; to the northeast is a Dog (10).
Return around the side of the house, and go inside to find a Baby (6). Also
indoors are a Cupboard, plus Silverware and Plates. Save these two - they&apos;re
useful, at specific times...

4. Go through the door for a Key and one more Cupboard, then exit the room
through the southwest opening and head northwest to rescue a Barbecue Guy (4)
from the yard. Walk due south to reach a meteorite-struck yard which seems to
be the nerve centre of the operation for the Doppelgangers. Before anything
else, take a quick detour through the gap in the fence to the northwest for a
Water Pistol, a Bin and a Key up north. Way back south it is again, and enter
the house to the west for a Baby (7), a Weedkiller replenishment and a
Cupboard. Blast through the hedge to the southwest of the house&apos;s entrance, and
clear a path through the weeds with your Weedkiller; a Mystery Potion is your
reward.

5. Exit north, head east, and jump south with the trampoline. Southwards is the
level&apos;s final Pod Plant for you to sweep away, and further southwards still are
a Cheerleader (A) and a Bin. Be warned - if you get the Bin first, from the
south, and a Bogeyman is released, then the Cheerleader will die (unless she is
in the middle of a jump)! Exit the alleyway north, then head around to the west
and in through the open door, collect a First Aid Kit and open a Cupboard, then
open the next door for another Cheerleader (8) and two more Cupboards.

6. Head south to exit the house, skirt the weeds and use the northeast exit
from the yard. You will soon come to a door, inside which are a final five
Cupboards (this level really is chock-full of those things...) and a Fire
Extinguisher. Go out of the house again, carry on and at the egress of the
alleyway you will find a Key, and to the east, a Pool Guy (3) relaxing in his
swimming pool (where else?). Jump out of the water and the Exit Door will
appear. Let&apos;s go.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

6) MORE SHOCKING THAN LEVEL 5: LEVEL 6: PYRAMID OF FEAR srch306

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

The Mummies are a nasty bunch; you&apos;ll need to master the art of running and
shooting from a safe distance. Two victims are in dodgy places, but all in all
it isn&apos;t a hard level.

NEW HAZARD: Collapsing roof gates. These allow you to walk through, but once
you&apos;ve moved a certain distance from them either north or south, they&apos;ll
collapse (unless two players are on opposite sides of the gate). They are
therefore unable to hurt you, but they can kill low-powered monsters if they&apos;re
following you. The&quot;hazard&quot;bit? You could get trapped in an area and want to
get out the way you came in, but not be able to. Luckily, the collapsed gate
counts as a fragile wall, and once blown up with a Bazooka (or whatever) it
won&apos;t collapse again but will stay open for you to go through however many
times you want.

NEW MONSTER: Mummy

MONSTER LIST: Zombies [Normal] (intensity: ranges from very low to medium,
 location: nearly everywhere)
 Mummies (location: patchy)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Explorer - In a small chamber in the middle of the pyramid, standing by a
 Pandora&apos;s Box, with a sarcophagus nearby on the wall that could spawn a
 Mummy.
 2) Explorer - At a u-turn in a passage near the northern side of the pyramid.
 The area can also be accessed through a hidden passage from the long
 northern corridor.
 3) Tourists - At the entrance to the pyramid, northeast from your start point.
 4) Explorer - In the southeast corner of a large room, in the southeast corner
 of the pyramid.
 5) Tourists - Just outside the pyramid, in the northwest corner of the level.
 6) Explorer - In a chamber in the northeast corner of the pyramid.
 7) Explorer - In a chamber on the eastern side of the pyramid.
 8) Explorer - In a tiny chamber in the middle of the pyramid maze, with some
 Ancient Artefacts.
 9) Tourists - In a room in the northwest corner of the pyramid, south through
 a hidden passage from the corridor leading to the exit.
10) Baby - Standing in the same room as the Tourists (9).

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Four Pandora&apos;s Boxes

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: There aren&apos;t any spectacularly good
point-scoring locations here. Try any place with a decent Zombie intensity and
no Mummies (such as the southeast room which held the first Explorer). Mummies
are bad value in points for the ammo needed to kill them.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Walk northeast to collect a Tourist Couple (3), then back southwest to the
entrance of the passage you were standing in. Walk west along the passage until
you come to a dark patch in the wall to your south; this is the entrance to a
hidden passage. Walk south into it and you will come out from behind a Sandbank
in a new room. In the southeast corner of this room is an Explorer (4); rescue
him quickly, as the Zombies in here will often get there pretty fast. There is
also a Pot to open, and another Sandbank along the north wall. Note that the
Sandbank from which you entered the room may have given you an item to pick up
as well - walk around a little way into the passage and see whether a&quot;bleep&quot;sounds. Remember to do this at the end of every secret passage that runs from
north to south from now on.

2. Head back out of the room the way you came in. Go east again, to your start
location, then northeast and north into the other passage. You&apos;ll probably meet
a Mummy or two at the corner, so be prepared with a well-aimed Soda Can or
backtrack a little while spraying them with Water Pistol fire. At the branch,
head north through the two collapsing roof gates and then east to save another
Explorer (7). Also in this room is a Pot and a Sandbank. Go west again, then
further north and east to come to a room containing a third Explorer (6) and a
Sandbank.

3. From here go west until you come to another secret passage to the south
(dark patches on the wall, remember). Collect the Explorer (2), and check the
passage for a bonus item from the Sandbank. Now head south along the eastern
fork, and at the first branch you will find a secret passage that heads a long
way south, beginning opposite a sarcophagus. In here are Bonus Points Pickups
and a Pandora&apos;s Box. You want this for level 8. Walk west, north through one
collapsing roof, and then further north and west into a small chamber
containing an Explorer (8) and Ancient Artefacts.

4. Out of the chamber, go north through another two collapsing roof gates, and
northwest (watch out for the Mummies!) to a fork in the passage. You want to
head west. Ignore the secret passage for now; head west to the sunny northwest
exit from the pyramid, and find a Tourist Couple (5). Return east into the
passage, take the hidden corridor south, and use it to find a couple of
Sandbanks, Tourists (9) and a Baby (10).

5. From here, take the western exit, follow the passage, and at the first fork,
head east to find two Pandora&apos;s Boxes and a Pot. Head southeast, south through
two collapsing roof gates, and straight on south into the last secret passage,
leading to the last Explorer (A). He might well be under threat of attack from
a Mummy, so be prepared for quick action. Collect the Pandora&apos;s Box and then
pause the game. Read the preamble to level 7, below, to decide whether to kick
off the level (ho ho ho) by using the Speed Shoes, and exit.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

7) LEVEL 7: DR. TONGUE&apos;S CASTLE OF TERROR srch307

-----

DIFFICULTY: 2/10

The Werewolves (of which you should only meet two, and then only if you&apos;re
doing very well) aside, there is nothing very distinguishing about this level.

NEW HAZARDS: Fire. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s no surprise to learn that fires are put out
 with the Fire Extinguisher.
 Mad Scientist. He drinks the potion he&apos;s holding and then he
 explodes, so he isn&apos;t too much to worry about. Don&apos;t fall into
 the trap of thinking he&apos;s a Victim though, as he&apos;ll hurt you
 if you touch him.
 Electric barriers. Time your walk so that you go through when
 they are switched off.

NEW MONSTER: Frankenstein&apos;s Monster
 Werewolf (possibly if you have eight or nine victims, probably if
 you have ten)

MONSTER LIST: Frankenstein&apos;s Monster (one)
 Mummies (location: in two places)
 Pod Plant (one)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists only after 9 seconds: #&apos;s 7, 8
 and 10)
 Zombies [Normal] (intensity: ranges from low to high, location:
 patchy)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - Locked in a cell, at the far end of the dungeons in the
 northeast corner of the castle. Access the dungeons via the passage behind
 the fireplace to the north of the entrance hall.
 2) Baby - Locked in the second of three cells, to the east of the
 Cheerleader&apos;s (A) area, in the dungeons in the northeast corner of the
 castle.
 3) Cheerleader - In the southeast corner of a small courtyard accessed through
 a covered passage, in the southwest corner of the castle.
 4) Cheerleader - On a raised dais on the western side of the level. Go up the
 steps to the northwest of the front gates, and continue northwest.
 5) Explorer - In a yard, at the western edge of the level.
 6) Baby - Through a door, in the middle of the dungeon area in the northeast
 corner of the castle.
 7) Tourists - East from your start location.
 8) Tourists - Up the stairs to the northwest of the front entrance.
 9) Cheerleader - Up a flight of stairs on the eastern side of the level, near
 Ancient Artefacts.
10) Tourists - On a raised dais, to the southwest of the stairs up to #8.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 Your first Ancient Artefacts
 Your first Martian Bubble Gun (if you didn&apos;t visit DOTT)
 First Aid Kit
 Extra Life
 Ghost Potion

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The east end of the central hall, where the
Zombies spawn quite quickly but there are no Mummies.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. This is the first level in which Tourist Couples will turn into pairs of
Werewolves after a pre-set time period (here, it&apos;s 9 seconds). This has the
same effect as their dying: you have lost a Victim. Victims 7, 8 and 10 on this
level are Tourist Couples; you won&apos;t be able to save #10 without using the
Speed Shoes at the start of the level. However, saving #10 is unnecessary, as
you&apos;ll have an eleventh Victim to save in level 8, which will repair the
damage. New players may want to use the Speed Shoes to be sure of getting to
victim eight in time; everyone else should save them for level 14. Bear in mind
when deciding on this, that you will get an Extra Bonus Victim at the end of
level 6 if you break the next multiple of 40,000 points... switch your special
item to the Speed Shoes in case, if you are unsure.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. As you wait to begin, hold down the right-arrow on the control pad, so that
you start to move east as soon as possible. Collect a Tourist Couple (7), then
go straight back to where you started, up the passage to a hall, northwest and
up the stairs to collect more Tourists (8). If you really want to rescue the
last pair of Tourists (10) and are using the Speed Shoes, head southwest and
directly over to them as fast as you can.

VICTIMS:

3. If you have ten Victims but aren&apos;t aiming to save the tenth, equip your
Silverware and head south and west at the turning. Slay the werewolves and then
head north again sharpish; a Cheerleader (3) to the south is vulnerable while
you stay here. North still, past the steps, and after turning left you will
find a Cheerleader (4). Go downstairs, sweep up a Pod Plant with your
Weedkiller, collect two Keys (one under the Pod Plant, which you may collect
without noticing if you use the Weedkiller) and then head north for an Explorer
(5). Now go south and into the roofed passage; use your Weedkiller again to
clear away the weeds from your path when you exit. Now head southeast and
quickly collect that Cheerleader (3). Bear in mind that the Weedkiller will
slay Zombies too, if you walk up to them while using it! There&apos;s no need to
waste time changing weapons.

4. Having picked up the Key, go back through the passage, up the steps, and
south to the first flight of stairs. You can now explore the southern dais more
fully; in addition to the two Keys is a secret passage in the southeast. A
Pandora&apos;s Box is located behind a stone on the balcony. Exit and go down into
the main hall once more. Head south and out the main gate again, and then over
to the east, where the first Tourists (7) were, if you didn&apos;t pick up the Key
lying there the first time. When you have it, go east to the other end of the
hall.

5. In this area, there are three Curtains and a Chest to be searched, and a Key
to be picked up. Up the steps are a Cheerleader (9), Ancient Artefacts, a Key
and a Chest. Head back once again to the main hall, and up the northern
passageway. You may encounter a Mummy; anyway, yet another Key is here, plus a
fire. Use your Fire Extinguisher - ammo for the Fire Extinguisher can be found
in the eastern wall (walk into it while pushing south into the south wall, then
north once you have found the bolt-hole). It doesn&apos;t take a long blast to put
the fire out, so don&apos;t go crazy.

6. At the end of the narrow tunnel behind the fire are the dungeons; go through
the door to the north to find lots of Bonus Points Pickups and a second
Pandora&apos;s Box. Back out again, and head east this time; through another door to
the north is a Baby (6), and you can go further north from there through
another two locked doors, to find a Cheerleader (A) waiting in a cell.

7. Head southwest and walk into the western wall, as you did to get the Fire
Extinguisher. This time you can find a Martian Bubble Gun, which will be very
useful on level 16. Go east back out of there and take the first turning east
opposite the Sarcophagus. Follow the narrow corridor to the end, and then go
through one door, and you will be confronted with another three; on the left is
a Monster Potion and straight ahead is a Baby (2).

PICKUPS:

8. There&apos;s a multitude of useful items still remaining, so don&apos;t leave yet!
Leave the baby&apos;s cell without exiting (you might have to hug the eastern wall),
and open the last door. Head northeast to find a sheltered passage; when you
emerge at the other end, go west into another one, much longer and leading to a
scientist&apos;s lab. Have your Ancient Artefacts ready.

9. When you emerge from the passage, walk southwest over to Frankenstein&apos;s
Monster. Start using the Ancient Artefacts before you make contact with him,
then walk into him as you use them; he should explode quite quickly. (Don&apos;t
worry about the Mad Scientist - he just drinks his potion and then blows
himself up.) Now head south. You will reach a set of timed electric barriers;
wait until they have just turned off to walk south through them. You will take
damage walking through the barriers if you do not time it properly - be
careful. You are now free to pick up a First Aid Kit.

10. An Extra Life to the east is guarded by another electric barrier, and a
Ghost potion, on the western side of the room, is surrounded by them. After
collecting the Potion, walk north through the final electric gate, around the
table and over to the north side of the room. You&apos;ll find a Key in the
northwest corner, and along the northern wall are two Curtains and a Chest.
Having exhausted the possibilities of this chamber, leave the way you came in,
heading east and then southwest through the secret passages; you can now exit
the level, as there&apos;s nothing left.

8) FORTY FEET OF TERROR IN: LEVEL 8: TITANIC TODDLER srch308

-----

DIFFICULTY: 1/10

If you just blunder out onto the field, then up to five Victims could cop it,
but you&apos;re more intelligent than that...&quot;camping&quot;might not be welcome in
other games, but here it&apos;s a virtue. It&apos;s easy if you know how!

NOTE: In addition to the usual ten Victims, the Big Baby turns into a regular
Baby if/when you defeat him, which is why this Baby is labelled&quot;Extra&quot;(E) and
why there are eleven Victims overall listed in the walkthrough. This Baby does
not have to be rescued if you defeat the Big Baby after the Exit Door has
appeared (which is only possible if you picked up an extra Skeleton Key
somewhere).

NEW MONSTER: Big Baby

BOSS: Big Baby

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - In the enclosed yard behind the Skull Door, at the northern
 edge of the map.
 2) Baby - In the large yard where the Big Baby is.
 3) Cheerleader - With Cheerleader #A, in the enclosed yard behind the Skull
 Door, at the northern edge of the map.
 4) Teacher - Standing on the patio at the eastern side of the yard where the
 Big Baby is.
 5) Baby - In the large yard where the Big Baby is.
 6) Soldier - In the large yard where the Big Baby is.
 7) Baby - In the large yard where the Big Baby is.
 8) Baby - In the large yard where the Big Baby is.
 9) Baby - In the house in the southeast corner of the level.
10) Explorer - At the western edge of the level, near some toxic waste drums.
 E) Defeat the Big Baby, and he will shrink down to regular size.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Pandora&apos;s Box
 First Aid Kit
 Skeleton Key (which you&apos;ll use)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Once the Big Baby is shrunk, that&apos;s your lot;
you cannot score indefinite amounts of points on this level.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Open the Bin to your southwest, and then head southeast around the long,
thin building. Head west and collect a Teacher (4), move southwest, collect
some Soda Cans quickly, and then enter the other, larger building using the
opening to the southeast. Open the Cupboard and then the door to the south;
inside is a Baby (9). Bazooka-blast the wall to the south, and go through the
new hole you made; walk east and then north for a Pandora&apos;s Box.

2. Switch to the Pandora&apos;s Boxes (you should now have seven of them), and head
south, west and north back into the first room inside the house. Station
yourself in the northwest corner of this room, where the now-open cupboard is,
and wait. Whenever the Big Baby runs in, and pauses to squirt you with its milk
bottle, use a Pandora&apos;s Box on it - after three to five of them, it will shrink
back to the size of a regular Baby (E).

3. There are no more enemies in this level, so let&apos;s be efficient: Head south
through to the second room again, and this time go west into a library. At the
opposite end is a Cupboard and a Key; if you head back to the library&apos;s
entrance then you can open a door to the south, leading to a storeroom
containing a First Aid Kit. Head northeast out of there, and west out of the
house again to collect the Baby (E) you defeated along with the Skeleton Key it
was holding. Head northeast and go into the building with the lockers along its
side; it contains a Cupboard. Having exited, you can explore the yard that the
Big Baby was running around, to the west; it contains a Bazooka pickup, two
Keys, a Soldier (6) and four Babies (2, 5, 7 and 8).

4. Exit the yard through a damaged hedge to the west. Head south along the
water&apos;s edge, and west when you can, and you will find an Explorer (10) near
some toxic waste drums. Further south, through another hole in the hedge, is a
tree whose branches conceal Bonus Points Pickups from your view. After
collecting them, head north, swim across the pond and then walk around the
drums and northeast to a Skull Door. Go through and rescue two trapped
Cheerleaders (A and 3). You should read the preamble to level 9 before leaving,
in order to be prepared for it.

9) LEVEL 9: TOXIC TERRORS srch309

-----

DIFFICULTY: 5/10

Several Victims are in less-than-desirable positions, and the introduction of
Jelly Blobs by having them spread all over the map is a little cruel... you
might well suffer the first time you play this level.

NEW MONSTER: Jelly Blob

MONSTER LIST: Jelly Blobs (intensity: ranges from low to very high, location:
 everywhere)
 Pod Plant (two)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Explorer - Roughly in the centre of the level, to the west of a large patch
 of weeds, between two groups of toxic waste drums.
 2) Tourists - Up by the northern wall of the level, west of a small building
 containing a First Aid Kit.
 3) Baby - In the centre room of the large building near the west side of the
 level. Enter via the door to the north, or through the damaged wall to the
 southeast, from the area filled with Jelly Blobs.
 4) Dog - Sitting in the road, just west of your start location.
 5) Cheerleader - In the clearing to the southeast of a large patch of weeds,
 towards the east side of the map, in the area filled with Jelly Blobs.
 6) Baby - In the small room on the east side of the map.
 7) Explorer - In the northwest corner of the area filled with Jelly Blobs, to
 the south of a fence blocking access from the tarmac path.
 8) Tourists - Near the northwest corner of the map, on a tarmac path to the
 north of a patch of weeds.
 9) Tourists - Standing to the north of the road that runs along the southern
 edge of the level, towards the western end, just past the end of the wall
 to the north.
10) Explorer - Up by the northern wall of the level, to the north of some toxic
 waste drums, east of the hedge block containing a Bonus Level Pickup.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bonus Level Pickup
 First Aid Kit

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Weed Cutting Bonus - 1000 points
 Secret Bonus - 2000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: This level really isn&apos;t the best place to
score points, as you&apos;ll lose health quickly due to the Jelly Bombs.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. The Jelly Blobs launch Jelly Bombs into the air at frequent intervals
(heralded by a squelching noise). A couple of seconds later, these land
wherever you were when they were launched (or where a Victim was, and likely
still is). For this reason you should keep moving and avoid retracing your
steps; you should also make sure to use your First Aid Kits when you have four
or less hit points if Jelly Blobs are around, because Jelly Bombs reduce your
hit points by three in total while they are on your head.

VICTIMS:

2. Head west along the road to pick up first a Water Pistol, then a Dog (4).
Walk west, keeping just south of the wall on the northern side of the road -
there&apos;s a Tourist Couple (9) standing just past the end. (If you have no
Weedkiller at this point, then you should head northeast to get some - I don&apos;t
recommend getting this Weedkiller pickup at this point in any other
circumstances, though, as it puts a couple of Victims at a slight risk.)
Continue west and where a path turns north off the road, follow it. Switch to
your Weedkiller, and sweep through the weeds over to the Pod Plant. It&apos;s
sitting on a Mystery Potion, so collect that after killing it.

3. Continue over to the north side of the weeds, and collect another Tourist
Couple (8). The square of greenery to the west hides a route through into the
alleyway you see to the northwest, so walk west and north to find a Weedkiller
pickup. Switch to your Bazookas. Head south and out of the alley to the east,
then head northeast and follow the path east where it continues. You&apos;ll come to
a line of fencing to the south, with an Explorer behind it; blast down one of
the sections of fence with an irregular top, and head through to get the
Explorer (7). (If you have no Bazookas, go around the fence via the green pond
to the southeast.)

4. Head back through the hole and northeast over to the other side of the toxic
waste drums to reach another Explorer (10). Head southwest from there and stand
in front of the hedge block; fire a Bazooka into the front to gain access to a
Bonus Level Pickup. Return northeast to where the Explorer (10) was and then
head east past a few more barrels of gunge to find Tourists (2). Head southwest
around another large batch of waste drums and then carry on south to find an
Explorer (A).

5. Switch to your Weedkiller. Sweep south through the small patch of weeds and
then turn east at the other side and walk over to a second Pod Plant. Mow him
down and then head east to find a Cheerleader (5). Don&apos;t wait around here -
there&apos;s a Baby to the northwest, who could be effectively killed (as you won&apos;t
be able to get to him) by a Jelly Bomb. Head northwest through the weeds and
once at the edge of the infested area, go north.

6. Past a startlingly green pond is a little hut. Enter it for a Bonus Points
Pickup, and then head into the back room for a First Aid Kit. Return south out
of there and head east to find a Key near some toxic waste drums. Go southeast
from there to enter another little room on its own, inside of which is a Baby
(6). There&apos;s a Cupboard by the door. After opening that, head out the door and
into the dead end to the east. Switch to your Bazookas and blast down the fence
to the south, then head through for a Bonus Points Pickup. Head north out of
the alleyway, and then northwest to find another one, and from that, head
northeast to find a Key.

7. Walk west past a protruding wall, southwest past a group of waste drums,
west past another, and south and west around the pond. You&apos;ll reach a larger,
more irregular pond - dive in and swim west across to the other side. Go
southwest from your point of exit to find a Key. Continue southwest into a
passageway inside another building, and head through the door to the north and
save the Baby (3), who&apos;s on the east side of the room.

PICKUPS:

8. Head through the door to your north, to find a Fire Extinguisher sitting
there in front of a Cupboard. Switch to your Bazookas and head south through
both doors inside the building; blow down one of the weak sections in the
southern wall. Head through and go east; you&apos;ll see a Weedkiller pickup on the
other side of a fence. Run around and get it, then backtrack west and north
into the house, to return to the Exit Door.

9-B) BONUS LEVEL: MUSHROOM MEN srch3b09

-----

DIFFICULTY: 1/10

It&apos;s a stroll through a monster-free house and grounds for Victims, followed by
an expedition into a field for bonus items. If you use a Ghost Potion or
Monster Potion, then you can ignore the aliens alluded to in the title, because
you can&apos;t even be hurt while grabbing the treasure. Sound good?

MONSTER LIST: Mushroom Men (intensity: high, location: in one large area)
 Weeds (present over one large area, but no Pod Plants)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Barbecue Guy - Just north of where you start.
 2) Trampoline Girl - North of where you start, at the northern edge of the
 safe area of the level.
 3) Teacher - In the one-room building in the southwest corner of the map.
 4) Baby - In the one-room building in the southwest corner of the map.
 5) Tourists - In the northern room of the larger building, on the eastern side
 of the safe area of the level.
 6) Cheerleaders - Just southeast of where you start.
 7) Tourists - East of where you start, past a protruding hedge.
 8) Baby - North a little way from where you start, past the Barbecue Guy (A).
 9) Cheerleaders - Just southeast of where you start.
10) Explorer - In the alleyway leading to the weed-covered field, northwest
 from your start location.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Monster Potion
 Two Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 Extra Life
 First Aid Kit

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Weed Cutting Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: You could snipe off Mushroom Men from your
alleyway hideout, but that would be very slow and wouldn&apos;t yield the score
boost you want for your ammo. Save it for later.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. Walk south for two Cheerleaders standing together (6 and 9), and then east
for a Tourist Couple (7). Head north into the house and find a Cupboard and a
Bonus Points Pickup. Exit the house again via the south exit and walk due west;
enter the next door you come to and find a Teacher (3), a Baby (4) and a
Cupboard inside. Exit and head northeast over to a Barbecue Guy (A). Continue
north to find a Baby (8) and, further on, a Trampoline Girl (2).

2. Don&apos;t jump into the field of weeds yet; instead jump off south and head
southeast into the other room in the large building. It contains a Tourist
Couple (5), a Bonus Points Pickup and a Cupboard. Leave the way you came in,
and head west to an ivy-covered alleyway. Through here, to the northeast, can
be found an intrepid Explorer (10). That&apos;s all the Victims, but to leave now
would be to entirely miss the point of the level, so read on below...

PICKUPS:

3. Switch to the Weedkiller and walk into the second ivy-covered alleyway. Now
begin using the Weedkiller, and go forth into the field... Directly north is a
Monster Potion, then a Pandora&apos;s Box. Northeast of that is an Ancient Artefacts
pickup; then head directly east for an Extra Life. South a little is a second
Pandora&apos;s Box, and west of that is a First Aid Kit flanked to the south and to
the north by two Bonus Points Pickups. After the second of these, head roughly
southwest and exit the field using the same route you came in. There&apos;s the Exit
Door too, right where you left it! No problem.

10) LEVEL 10: NO ASSEMBLY REQUIRED srch310

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

This level is really pretty easy if you know what you are doing. The Evil Dolls
are only threatening if you&apos;re slow, so don&apos;t be.

MONSTER LIST: Evil Dolls (intensity: high, location: nearly everywhere)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Soldier - On the western side of the level, with some Bazooka ammo, to the
 south of a machine spitting Evil Dolls out onto a conveyor belt.
 2) Teacher - In the southwest corner of the large, mostly empty room in the
 northwest corner of the level.
 3) Soldier - Behind a barrier of boxes, on the south side of the large factory
 bay on the north side of the level.
 4) Baby - In a dead end formed by boxes, near the northeast corner of the map.
 5) Tourists - By the door in a small room with a soda vending machine, at the
 southern edge of the level.
 6) Baby - In the southwest corner of the level.
 7) Cheerleader - Near the northern edge of the map. In the northwest corner of
 the large factory bay on the north side of the map.
 8) Soldier - Standing with Bazookas, just east of your start location.
 9) Tourists - In a corridor at the northern edge of the level.
10) Tourists - In the large area full of boxes, in the northeast corner of the
 map.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bazooka pickups
 Three First Aid Kits

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: You could try standing in the aisle just to
the south of a particular Evil Doll-producing machine, which is itself
southwest of that last soldier. Wait for five to appear, then get them all at
once with a Soda Can. That&apos;s one thousand points per throw, you know, and more
when there are Fire Babies present.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. East of your start position is a Soldier (8) by a Bazooka pickup. Northeast
of them is a First Aid Kit. After collecting these three, head southwest across
a conveyor belt for Soda Cans. Next thing is to go back to the other side of
the conveyor belt and then skirt the wall on the northwest of the room until
you come to a collapsible wall. Blast it down and walk north through a
collapsing roof, then northeast and through a gap. In here are Tourists (10),
and a Key to the south.

2. Fire two Bazooka shots northwards, then head due north through the two
destroyed crates and around into a dead end for a Baby (4). An Evil Doll will
probably appear to your east now; throw a Soda Can while he&apos;s toddling north.
Head out south again, taking a detour east for a Key. Go south back to the open
space that contained the Tourists and exit through the northeast corner. Head
south now, and carry on following the long passageway around a few corners
(you&apos;ll find a Key along the first straight) until you find a door to your
south.

3. Go through the door, walk east, pick up Ice Lollies, open another door south
and go inside and along to the west for a First Aid Kit. Go back out north
through two doors to the passage, and open the next door along. Collect
Tourists (5), and a Bonus Points Pickup on the other side of the soda machine,
then walk out the southwest exit. Blow up the first box you see to the north,
and go through for a Key. Head east along the conveyor belt to the north, go
into the next passage as soon as you see it, and walk west to find a couple
more Keys.

4. Return to where you blew up the box (east, south at the first opportunity,
west against the conveyor belt, south, through the box fragments) and go
northwest. Use a Bazooka shell on one of the weak box sections to the west,
head south in the next aisle and skirt the south wall while walking west to
find a Baby (6). Walk north and through a door, then east, for another Soldier
(A), again with Bazooka ammo on the floor nearby. Head northwest and blow holes
in two successive wall sections, then go through and save the Teacher (2).

5. Northeast, behind a box, is a Key; go north around the box, then east along
the conveyor belt, taking a small detour for Decoy Clowns. Go through the door
at the end of the passage, travel east and collect a Tourist Couple (9). Blast
down the wall to the south for a Monster Potion. Return west, back through the
now-open door, and blast through south to a Cheerleader (7). Walk further south
and just before you come to a conveyor belt, enter an alcove to the west.

6. If you have four or more Bazooka shells left at this point, then you can
obtain some helpful items by investigating the area behind the weak wall to the
north. Blast down the wall, then a weak box section to the west, to access a
large empty room. Blast down a wall to the south for a Mystery Potion and two
Bonus Points Pickups; then move north, open a door and head east, to find a
First Aid Kit behind yet another hapless block of masonry to your south.

7. Once you have everything, exit the bonus area and go back north, near to
where the Cheerleader was. Go east through the gap in the boxes, and continue
southeast. Blow up a box and continue east, taking the south route around a
line of boxes; you&apos;ll find one last Soldier (3) and his trademark Bazooka. If
there&apos;s an Evil Doll menacing him, it&apos;s probably not actually going to manage
to kill him - for some reason they find it extremely difficult to kill Soldiers
(maybe they have armour on). There&apos;s nothing more to see here, so exit now.

11) PLANTS GO BERSERK IN: LEVEL 11: WEEDS GONE BAD srch311

-----

DIFFICULTY: 1/10

What a dull level. The Victims can&apos;t even die unless Pod Plant Snot chances to
land on them, and what are the chances of that happening, eh? If you run out of
Weedkiller, use Monster Potion; if you run out of that use Ghost Potion; if you
run out of that too, er, well, hop... The only thing that&apos;s difficult on this
level is finding your way about, as there are virtually no landmarks and the
Victims and Pod Plants are scattered all over the place. If the walkthrough
seems vague on directions, I&apos;m sorry, I did my best with what I&apos;ve got...

MONSTER LIST: Pod Plants (eight)
 Weeds (covering the map)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - In the northwest corner of the map.
 2) Cheerleader - In the southwest corner of the map.
 3) Baby - In the southeast corner of the map.
 4) Tourists - In a small clearing in the weeds, around the centre of the
 southern edge of the level.
 5) Tourists - Where you start.
 6) Tourists - In a small clearing near the northwest corner of the map.
 7) Tourists - South of the large paved area, standing amongst the weeds.
 8) Explorer - Southwest along a clear pathway from your start location.
 9) Explorer - Standing in the middle of the weeds, close to two Pod Plants, at
 the eastern edge of the level.
10) Explorer - In the large paved area some distance to the southwest of your
 start point.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Monster Potion

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Weed Cutting Bonus - 1000 points (does not require Pod
 Plants to die)

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The only source of points in this level are
the Victims and the Pod Plants. When all are gone, you can&apos;t earn any more
points.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Near you as you start are Tourists (5), and a Pod Plant, to the south. After
you&apos;ve finished with those two, head south along the (western) clear path, west
at the turning and kill a second Pod Plant. Further west is an Explorer (8).
Head south, then west, along the path; collect another Explorer (10) and kill
another Pod Plant to the south. Go south from the Pod Plant for a Tourist
Couple (7) in the middle of the weeds, then southeast for another Tourist
Couple (4) in a clear patch.

2. Now go east for a Baby (3), situated in the southeast corner of the level,
and north from there to find two Pod Plants on either side of an Explorer (9).
The southeast Pod Plant is sitting on a Monster Potion. To the northwest, you
can find a Weedkiller pickup in a clear patch. Head southwest and keep up
against the south wall until you find a Cheerleader (2) in a small clearing, in
the southwest corner of the level.

3. After collecting the Cheerleader (2), head east and a little north to find
another Weedkiller pickup. There are two Pod Plants to the north of this, one
after the other, with the edge of the paved area between them. After the
second, go northwest and collect first a Tourist Couple (6) in a clear patch,
then a Cheerleader (A), in the northwest corner of the level. At this point,
the Exit Door will appear, but you can head east to find one last Pod Plant,
which hides a Weedkiller pickup. Stroll west after finishing him off, and exit.

12) THEY CAME TO EARTH FOR ONE THING: LEVEL 12: MARS NEEDS srch312
 CHEERLEADERS

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

You must collect all the Victims on this level in order to get into the next
Bonus Level. Most are easy, but there are some you might be unlucky with! The
enemies in this level are extremely good at hampering your movements, which can
get very irritating; the Bonuses are fun to get, but challenging.

NOTE: At the end of this level, you&apos;ll be given a password for level 13 even if
you&apos;re going to the Bonus Level first. The password you get is for level 13,
not for the Bonus Level.

NEW MONSTERS: American Footballers
 Martians
 Martian Spaceship

MONSTER LIST: American Footballers (intensity: low, location: all over the
 football field)
 Martians (intensity: ranges from low to high, location:
 everywhere)

BOSS: Martian Spaceship

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two pairs of Speed Shoes
 Three pickups of American Footballs
 Soda Cans, to use against the Martian Spaceship
 Ten Cheerleaders (access a Bonus Level if you save all ten)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses (Ten Cheerleaders Bonus replaces
 All Victims Saved Bonus)
 Alien Invasion Repelled - 9900 points
 Bonus for Pass Completion - 5000 points
 Secret Bonus - 2000 points (awarded with Ten Cheerleaders)

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Be sure to get the large one-off bonuses
available (listed above). The northeast corner of the level, where you start,
is the best place to score continually after that (though Martians are not easy
opponents to wrangle points from while remaining unharmed). Martians appear
fastest there, and there are no American Football Players to irritate you.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. The Martians begin teleporting in immediately, but you can make them retreat
with a single Water Pistol squirt, so they can&apos;t be that fearsome... Ignore the
Martian Spaceship for now, because you can fight it better when you can wander
around the football field without having to worry about the Cheerleaders dying.
Go south straight away and collect your first Cheerleader (7) just past the
tree, then enter the door to the west, collect Speed Shoes inside and go
through to the next room to the north, where there&apos;s a Key. Head west along the
aisle and out into the yard, and continue west to the far end to find a second
Cheerleader (A).

2. Quickly pick up a Key and then go inside using the door to your southeast.
Head west along the passage, open a Cupboard and rescue the third Cheerleader
(2). Through the door to the north is a Cupboard. From there, head through the
next door to the north (or go the long way round if you want to save a Key) and
go west to find a Bin to open. Use Bazookas to blast a hole in the fence to the
south, and go through and then east to pick up American Footballs. Continue
east between the spectator stands and a bench to find two Cheerleaders (5 and
9); carry on going due east for a while to find more American Footballs, and
then Soda Cans. Go west again to the end of the second lot of spectator stands,
and north for a Cheerleader (6) next to a barbecue grill.

3. Through the door to the north is a Cupboard. If you head precisely southwest
on leaving the passage then you&apos;ll eventually come to a Cheerleader (8) at the
southern side of the field, at the twenty-yard line near the western end. Go
north from here for a Key (on another painted line), then west for a second
pair of Speed Shoes. Walk north and west past the hedge, southwest around a
bench, and then south to find a Cheerleader (4). Head southeast from her and
out onto the southern edge of the field again; check the Bin to the northwest
in case there are any useful items inside.

4. Turn on your Victim Radar; skirt the wall on the southern edge of the level
and walk along east until it shows a dot to the northeast. That&apos;s the
penultimate Cheerleader (10), so go and save her. Take a detour west and a
little north for a third American Football pickup. Join the south wall and head
east again. Open the Bin that you find as you go, and then just head east and
you will find the final Cheerleader (3) near a tree in the southeast corner of
the level.

BONUSES:

5. You have all the pickups, but how about some bonus points? You can earn
19,400 points with just some Soda Cans and American Footballs! What do you need
to do? Earn the Bonus for Pass Completion by throwing the Footballs at the
American Football Players. At least ten Football Players must receive
successful passes for you to earn the bonus. Earn the Alien Invasion Repelled
bonus by blowing up the Martian Spaceship - throw Soda Cans into the hatch when
it opens. As far as I know, no other weapon will work. You need to hit it ten
times in this fashion to destroy the ship; you&apos;ll know when you&apos;ve hit it
because it will flash orange. When it starts heavily distorting upon taking
damage, you know that it&apos;s nearly destroyed.

12-B) BONUS LEVEL: CHEERLEADERS VERSUS THE MONSTERS srch3b12

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

The Werewolves make it hard; the Vampire is a doddle if you know what to do.
It&apos;s a matter of looking out for what monsters are going to swiftly nab the
Victims while you&apos;re not looking, or are doing something else. As I say, the
Werewolves are the worst for this.

NOTE: It is only possible to access this level with ten Victims, which is why
there are no Victim Numbers provided in the walkthrough. All ten of the Victims
are&quot;Always There&quot;.

NEW MONSTERS: Spider
 Werewolf (you may or may not have come across these on level 7)
 Vampire

MONSTER LIST: Evil Dolls (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Spiders (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Vampire (one)
 Werewolves (source: appear after 45 seconds minimum, intensity:
 low, location: everywhere)
 Zombies [Normal] (intensity: low, location: one place)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Ancient Artefacts
 First Aid Kit
 Pandora&apos;s Box

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Slay Werewolves in the northern corridor if
you want, but I&apos;d hardly describe business as fast. It&apos;s really not worthwhile.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. Werewolves start to spawn on this level after approximately 45 seconds. The
method described below takes a route that allows you to collect each item and
Victim as you go; however, if you want to go through first and collect only the
Cheerleaders, then come back for the items later, that&apos;s fine too. Bear in mind
that the Vampire could slow you down anyway if you take a wrong turn.

WALKTHROUGH:

2. Switch your weapon to Soda Cans. Head north for a Dog and then further north
to a clear space in front of an open door. At this point, throw a Soda Can
north into the doorway; Spiders frequently spawn there, in and around the web,
and if you allow them, they will run southwest to kill the Cheerleader.
Incidentally, collect her yourself. North of where she was, past the bookcases,
is a Cupboard and a Key. Go into the next room, where the web is, and collect
some Bonus Points Pickups. Head south from the doorway into a small supply room
containing a Key.

3. Before long, Werewolves will start spawning, so have Silverware ready. Head
out, and east along the corridor to the next room for a Fire Extinguisher and a
Chest. Enter the next room to the south for a Cupboard and more Bonus Points
Pickups, then the next one north after that for a Cheerleader. Pick up a Key in
the passage and go north for a Chest. Open the door to the south for another
Key, followed by a Cheerleader through the hole in the wall to the southwest.
Head out to the northeast passage again, and into the next northern room for a
Key.

4. Switch to your Ancient Artefacts, and head south into an empty room. The
Vampire will fly in from the east, and you can engage him in battle. It&apos;s quite
simple; whenever he is in human form, walk into him while using the Artefacts.
As he takes damage, he will start to fly faster; after a short while (this
being a weak Vampire compared to those in later levels), he will fly away and
you will be free of him as far as this level is concerned. If any Werewolves or
Zombies come in, just use the Ancient Artefacts on them too. Try and keep the
fight confined to that room, as you run the risk of allowing the Werewolves to
kill Victims if you go further afield. Be sure to massacre the accumulated
Werewolves after the Vampire is gone, so that they don&apos;t cause trouble while
you&apos;re doing the next bit.

5. Ignore the next two pairs of rooms for now - if you dawdle around here,
Cheerleaders are liable to fall prey to the Werewolves. In the third room to
the south is a Cheerleader. Use the big hole to nip into the room southeast of
that quickly for a Key, but don&apos;t stay explore or Evil Dolls may appear and
start stalking you. Return to the northern corridor and find a Cheerleader in
the next room to the north, and a Key in the corresponding one to the south.

6. At this point you should backtrack; northwest of the room you&apos;re in now, in
which you found a Key, is another room containing a Key. Southwest of that is a
room in which you can find a much more valuable pickup, to replenish your stock
of Ancient Artefacts. In the easternmost of the northern rooms is a Bazooka
pickup. South of its entrance is a small cupboard holding a First Aid Kit; west
of that is a Key.

7. Move south for yet another Key and then head southwest and into a side
corridor leading south. Follow this to the end for two Keys and a Cheerleader.
Head back out, go east and into the last supply room, which hides a Mystery
Potion by some weeds. Go west along the southern corridor, and into the first
room on the south for a Cheerleader. North of that is a room holding three
Bonus Points Pickups. In the next room to the south is a Key; the room to the
north is empty. In the next room to the north is a Key (the last one,
thankfully); the room to the south is empty. In the next room to the south is a
Pandora&apos;s Box; the room to the north is empty. No, I have not cut-and-pasted
too many times; this level is just that exciting, that&apos;s all...

8. Ignore the next pair of rooms. Check the one to the south after them for the
inevitable Cheerleader. Now it&apos;s to a northern room for Soda Cans, to a
southern one for a couple of Bonus Points Pickups, and to the last southern
one, near where you started, for the final Cheerleader. There&apos;s something about
this dingy level that depresses me. I think it&apos;s intentional on the part of the
game&apos;s designers. Whatever; leave as soon as possible.

1. West of your start location is a Dog (9), and east is a Key. Collect the
Water Pistol south of where the dog was, and enter the supermarket through the
double-doors. Go round the last checkout on the west, and head east along the
row and into a display area. On your way you will find Decoy Clowns, a Baby
(3), and finally a Soldier (6) with another packet of Decoy Clowns and two
Bazookas. (Make sure to reserve at least two Bazooka missiles for use on level
15.) Head north into the other corner for Water Pistol ammo.

2. Now switch to your Ancient Artefacts and head west and around to the north.
A Lumberjack in the next aisle will chop his way through the wall and come
after you; lead him a little east to protect some Tourists (5) to the
southwest, and then walk into him while using the Artefacts. If he falls over,
then stop using them until he gets up. When the Lumberjack expires, arm
yourself with your Water Pistol in case of any inconvenient Zombies and head
north around two irritating protruding displays to find the grocery section,
wherein are a Teacher (7), immediately obvious, and a Tourist Couple (A), to
the northeast.

3. In the southwest corner of the grocery are Soda Cans; after them, return
south around a long display to where you fought the first Lumberjack, and then
go southwest (but not back into the Evil Doll area) to rescue that Tourist
Couple (5) which I mentioned earlier. Head north from this point and another
Lumberjack makes his presence known. Wait for him to hack through to your
aisle, lead him a little south (to approximately where the Tourists were
standing), then use the same procedure on him as you used to kill the other
one. Remember that you can Bazooka the shop shelves yourself if it is
absolutely necessary in order to get him into your aisle. After your second
homicide, you can go southwest back to where the checkouts are. Blast through
the shelves to the north (try the middle of the display of tins), in the
northwest corner of this area, and you will come to a Teacher (2) on her own.

4. Walk north up the western aisle, armed again with your Water Pistol, and you
will come to a clear area where two Cheerleaders (10 nearest, 4 furthest) are
jumping up and down. You could feasibly benefit from getting the Pandora&apos;s
Boxes ready for use, as the Zombies will sometimes appear in the wrong place in
the wrong time, and could then potentially get an easy kill if you don&apos;t take
desperate measures. Take the north door into the warehouse. In the northwest
corner of the large room is a Key; through the door to its east is a First Aid
Kit. Head on east through the warehouse and find a Cheerleader (8) to the
northeast, through a hole in the wall. She&apos;s the last Victim, but you should
really get the Ghost Potion - and read the preamble to level 14, below - before
exiting.

PICKUPS:

5. After the final Victim, further to the east, is a chilly-looking storage
room terminating in a dead end, with Ice Lollies and a Key on the floor. There
is also a door to the south near the entrance, leading around to a Ghost
Potion. After you have this, return northwest and over to the Exit Door, then
pause the game and read the preamble to level 14&apos;s walkthrough below. When
you&apos;ve finished, you can unpause, switch to the Speed Shoes if you want to, and
exit.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

14) LEVEL 14: SEVEN MEALS FOR SEVEN ZOMBIES srch314

-----

DIFFICULTY: 7/10

Pretty difficult. There are several hard-to save Victims, including one
particular Explorer standing in precisely the worst place possible. This level
is also the first time that a meaner variety of Zombie starts making itself
noticed (although it actually first appeared in small numbers in the southeast
corner of level 3). While its appearance is the same, this one won&apos;t wander off
if you run away, but will keep on going after you at top speed. Because it&apos;s so
much more vicious, I&apos;ve decided to name it... the Vicious Zombie.

NEW HAZARD: Spikes. Time your walk so that you go over them when they have sunk
underground.

NEW MONSTER: Werewolf (you may or may not have come across these previously,
and you may or may not come across some on this level)

MONSTER LIST: Jelly Blobs (intensity: ranges from very low to medium, location:
 in two places)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 37 seconds: #&apos;s 7, 6 and
 10; one on its own which may appear after about 90 seconds,
 at a particular point in the northwest of the map)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from low to very
 high, location: everywhere)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 Ancient Artefacts

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The chamber southwest of where you start,
with the copious piles of bones all over the place. Zombies spawn there very
quickly indeed. This level is a goldmine if you want Extra Bonus Victims or
Players.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. It&apos;s another of those levels where the Tourists are walking (well, standing)
time-bombs. This time they will wait 37 seconds before morphing into
Werewolves. You&apos;ve no worries unless you have ten victims, and if you do, then
just start walking right away and you can get them all with ten whole seconds
to spare. You could use the Speed Shoes from the off, though, if you haven&apos;t
played the level before and want to be sure of getting it right. I have written
one all-purpose walkthrough to cover all eventualities, with the pickups coming
last so as to protect the Victims. I don&apos;t think that really inconveniences
anyone very much, as I&apos;ve kept backtracking routes to a minimum.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. East of where you start are Tourists (7). After you have them, prime your
Water Pistol, head west, south, east through a hall with gargoyle decorations
to the north, and south again for more Tourists (6). Now head west, south at
the T-junction, west at the crossroads, south again at the second T-junction
and once you have the Explorer (A) in the southwest corner of the level, east
for the final pair of Tourists (10). You can go back up north to that second
T-junction now.

VICTIMS:

3. If you have nine or ten Victims, then you should at this point make sure you
are not low on health. (If you have three bars or less, use a First Aid Kit.)
Use a pair of Speed Shoes and then immediately switch your special item to
Pandora&apos;s Boxes - that&apos;s one, two, three, four, FIVE presses of the A Button if
everything&apos;s well with your item reserves. Rush north through the gate, try to
collect an Explorer (4) as you pass - it doesn&apos;t matter if you miss him - and
then just belt northwards over the spikes - it doesn&apos;t matter if you lose
health, either. If at any time a Zombie appears on the other side of the wall,
anywhere near the Explorer (9), you should use a Pandora&apos;s Box. Once around the
wall, rush south spraying Water Pistol fire and quickly save the Explorer (9).

4. Of course, if you have eight or less Victims, you can take the whole thing
at a much more leisurely pace. Stroll north, wait patiently at each set of
spikes and progress past them without losing your health, if you can. After you
have got to the other side of the spikes, however fast you did it, go to the
south past the wall, to where the Explorer is (or would be), and then east and
north for a Bonus Points Pickup. When you have that, go south, west, north,
northeast through a small passage, and then west over a bed of spikes. You will
find an Explorer (8) in the northwest corner of the level.

5. Return to the crossroads in the middle of the level by these directions:
east over spikes, south, west, straight on, south over four strips of spikes -
collect the Explorer (4) if you didn&apos;t get him earlier - and east at the
T-junction. Once at the crossroads, take the northern path. Ignore the turning
east (a Werewolf might appear to the west at this point) and collect an
Explorer (2) in a small alcove.

6. Head south again, past the T-junction and crossroads, and once the path
opens up, go to the northeast corner of the pillared chamber (sticking close to
the north side of the north row of pillars in order to avoid being held up by
the spikes) and rescue a Baby (3). Southwest of the Baby is a Bonus Points
Pickup, southeast of that is a Key and in the southwest corner of the room is
another Bonus Points Pickup. Exit the room through the passage leading out of
the southeast corner.

7. North from the southeast corner of the level is another set of spikes. An
Explorer (5) is standing on them, but he&apos;s immune, so don&apos;t worry; head over to
him carefully. Take heed of the Jelly Blob which has probably appeared by the
time you see him, though. When you have this last Explorer (5), the Exit Door
will appear; stay away from it (and head northwest off the spikes) if you want
the goodies listed below, otherwise pause the game before going forth. That&apos;s
right, there are two Tourist-Werewolf levels in a row! Be sure to read the
preamble to level 15 before you exit.

PICKUPS:

8. Go north past a strip of spikes, then west to find yourself back at the
crossroads. Take the west route, and head north at the T-junction. Past the
spikes (a Werewolf might appear to the southeast at this point, if it didn&apos;t
appear earlier), head northeast to come out between two beds of spikes, where
you were before. If you walk onto the eastern bed of spikes and then walk south
into the wall, you&apos;ll enter a hidden passage. Go east when you come to the
south wall, then press northeast to come out in a little room containing two
Bonus Points Pickups and a Pandora&apos;s Box.

9. To exit this room, go south, west, and press northwest to reappear at the
spikes (timing!). Return to the crossroads by heading west, south through a
passage, west, straight on, south over strips of spikes, and east at the
T-junction. Take the north path (a Werewolf might appear to the west at this
point, if it still hasn&apos;t arrived) and go east at the T-junction. Prepare your
Water Pistol, because it&apos;s fierce in the next area. Take these directions when
you come to walls: north, west, north and east. Where the piles of bones
finish, go into the alcove to the south and then walk southeast into the wall,
then south along another secret passage. At the end are a lot of Bonus Points
Pickups, one pickup of Ancient Artefacts and another Pandora&apos;s Box.

10. Assuming that the Explorer (5) was in fact the last Victim you collected,
you can find the Exit Door again by following these directions: north,
northwest, west, south, east, south, west, south, east, southeast over a strip
of spikes, east. The Exit Door is probably on the big bed of spikes. As
mentioned above, you should read level 15&apos;s preamble before proceeding.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

15) LEVEL 15: DINNER ON MONSTER ISLAND srch315

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

Mostly easy. One Victim in minor peril. What else is there to say?

NEW MONSTERS: Squidman
 Werewolf (you may or may not have come across these previously,
 and you may or may not come across a pair on this level)

MONSTER LIST: Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: in one place)
 Lumberjack (one)
 Pod Plant (one)
 Squidmen (intensity: ranges from low to medium, location:
 patchy - wherever there is water)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists only after 38 seconds: #4)
 Zombies [Vicious] (intensity: high, location: in one place)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Skeleton Key

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The Zombie zone on the southeast of the
island.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. This level has one pair of Tourists who will change into Werewolves, after
the extremely forgiving time limit of 38 seconds. It&apos;s not just for the
high-achievers any more, though, because this time the Tourists are Victim
number four. Just read through paragraph 2 below, headed&quot;TOURIST-WEREWOLVES&quot;,
and you&apos;ll be fine.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. Go south for a Key, then southwest for Weedkiller. Switch to your Bazooka
and blast through a wall to the north (the recoil forces you backwards into the
water! No worries, just climb out again). Collect a Baby (3), open a Cupboard
and head north until you come to our Tourist Couple (4) to the northwest. You
shouldn&apos;t have any problem collecting them before they transform.

VICTIMS:

3. Go southwest for a Key, but ignore the trampoline and go back northeast.
Ignore the Teacher (10) for a moment, go east and then wait for a Lumberjack to
knock his way through the hedge or the house towards you (or go around
yourself). Attack him by walking into him while using the Ancient Artefacts;
when he explodes, go over to the Teacher&apos;s (10) little hut, collect her and
open a Cupboard. Head into the larger building to the south, collect a Key and
open another Cupboard. Exit the house and head over to the northeast of the
island, where you will find a Dog (5).

4. Now go southwest around the hedge and into another little hut to find a Fire
Extinguisher and a Cupboard. Go back around to where the Dog (5) was, walk
south to collect a Key, then Bazooka-blast through the hedge (from the north if
you want to avoid falling in the water) for a Barbecue Guy (A). Go south
through one door for a cupboard, then hurry through two more doors and further
south to a Cheerleader (8). It won&apos;t hurt to be ready with your Water Pistol
for some suppressing fire at this point - Zombies could be ready for the kill.

5. Go west until you find a Key, then round to the north side of this next hut
and in for a Teacher (9) and a Cupboard. Out of the hut and west is a Pod Plant
for you to mow down. (It hides a Key, but if you wade right in, you might pick
this up without noticing it.) Head northwest for a Cheerleader (2), then south
to the end of the long peninsula, and jump into the water. Swim southwest to
find a little blob of land with a Skeleton Key on it.

6. After you have the Skeleton Key (it is needed for level 22), swim north
along the side of the main island until you come to another land mass to hop
out onto. North is a Cheerleader (6); you can put out the fire with the Fire
Extinguisher for a Key. Collect the Swimming Pool Guy (7) in the water to the
east, and then jump out of the water anywhere to have the Exit Door appear.
Switch your weapon to the Martian Bubble Gun before you leave, as the next
level is intense from the start.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

16) FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH: LEVEL 16: ANTS srch316

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

You&apos;ll be fine if you stay alert for those Ants. They&apos;re pretty fast, but the
Victims are not in any real danger. Pay attention in case desirable pickups are
dragged away and hidden by the Ants!

NEW MONSTER: Ant

MONSTER LIST: Ants (intensity: ranges from low to high, location: everywhere)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bazookas

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 No Bazooka Fired Bonus - 1000 points
 Extermination Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The southwest. EXTERMINATE! EX-TER-MINATE!

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. East are a Soldier (2) and a Bazooka. Collect both and then walk around the
wall to the north. You will be abruptly challenged by Ants; remember that the
Martian Bubble Gun is the absolute best weapon to use on them. If you have
none, it&apos;s the Ancient Artefacts, or Bazooka fire. Continue walking clockwise
around the passage. After one and a half complete circuits, you come to a Baby
(3), and further on from that is a Bazooka pickup; a Soldier (4); a Key; a
Water Pistol; and a trampoline. You can&apos;t collect this, but you can use it to
bypass an empty loop in the passage, so jump north.

2. After getting over, switch to the Pandora&apos;s Boxes, then head east to another
trampoline. If you see an Ant appear in the next loop to the north, use a
Pandora&apos;s Box to kill it, or it may get one of the Victims. Use the second
trampoline to jump west (you should collect specific Victims in this outside
loop first, as they&apos;re in more danger than the other two left in interior
loops). Collect a Tourist Couple (10), two Bazooka pickups occupying the same
position, and another Soldier (5) before an Ant appears to attack them (or take
one of the Bazookas away).

3. Keep the Pandora&apos;s Boxes ready for use - you will soon be walking past a
Baby (9) in another loop of the passage, who may be attacked by Ants. Walk
east, collect more Tourists (6) and follow the passage south until you find a
Teacher (7); then turn around and head back north again. You will pass the Baby
(9) on each journey, and the Teacher (7) is in some small danger, so have your
Martian Bubble Gun and Pandora&apos;s Boxes ready for action.

4. Now, walk around the passage anticlockwise, and keep to the inside of the
loop while near the southwest corner of the level - this prevents the Ants from
carrying away the items there, to some extent. Along the south you will find an
Explorer (8), and further on is that Baby (9) you passed earlier. (Note that if
you do not care about the No Bazooka Fired Bonus, you could just blast through
some hedges that are to be found at the north side of the outside loop, and
take a detour in the clockwise direction for these two Victims. This won&apos;t
actually save you a huge amount of walking.)

5. You will come to that second trampoline again - use it to jump north, back
into the outside loop. Head around clockwise; after a little walking you will
find an open area containing some items - three Bonus Points Pickups and a
Mystery Potion. After you have obtained these, head north, then east, and you
will find a Tourist Couple (A) at the opposite end of the passage from where
you started. Return south if you want to hunt Ants for the Extermination Bonus,
but remember not to use the Bazooka if you want to earn the No Bazooka Fired
Bonus. Before you exit, pause the game, read the preamble to level 17, and
prepare. Oh no!

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

17) LEVEL 17: OFFICE OF THE DOOMED srch317

-----

DIFFICULTY: 7/10

Spiders, Evil Dolls and Zombies are having a get-together in a haunted house
(or office, I suppose). The majority of this level&apos;s Victims are in danger of
getting killed. Be very careful, and resign yourself to the fact that they&apos;ll
probably be decimated the first time you play through. Also, be warned that
this level is all the more difficult if you start on it using a password, and I
don&apos;t recommend it (though I&apos;ve most generously provided a walkthrough to
follow if you really want to, anyway).

NEW MONSTERS: Spider (if you did not visit level 12&apos;s Bonus Level)
 Werewolf (you may or may not have come across these previously,
 and you may or may not come across some on this level)

MONSTER LIST: Evil Dolls (intensity: medium, location: in the north and
 northwest)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)
 Mushroom Men (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Spiders (intensity: medium, location: north and west)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists only - after 9 seconds: #&apos;s 9
 and 10)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from low to
 medium, location: in the south and southeast)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Monster Potion (you&apos;ll need Bazookas or similar)
 Bonus Level Pickup (ditto)
 First Aid Kit
 Ancient Artefacts

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Secret Bonus - 2000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: In the southeast, where all the Zombies are.
It has to be said that this is not the best of levels for this purpose.

-----

PREAMBLE:

But yes! It&apos;s another of those Tourist-Werewolf levels! This time it&apos;s the last
two Victims again, so if you are underachieving, your load will not be added
to. If you start on this level using a password, then do start with ten Victims
nevertheless, as you can collect one of the Tourist Couples (10) and avoid
letting the other pair, #9, transform until nearly every other Victim is saved.
If you want to collect Victim number nine, you should be well-advised to use
the Speed Shoes, and if you want both, you will certainly need them. (Switch to
the Speed Shoes before exiting level 16 if you plan to use them. Otherwise, you
ought definitely to start with your Pandora&apos;s Boxes prepared.) The other
Victims in #10&apos;s area are a pain, as well.

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You have been playing since level 13 or earlier):

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

1. Go northeast straightaway, through the door, and to the corner. If you&apos;re an
expert you should try and get your special item to the Pandora&apos;s Boxes while
doing so - that&apos;s one, two, three, four, FIVE presses of the A Button if
everything&apos;s swell with your item reserves - as another Victim could cop it
while you go after the Tourists if you don&apos;t let out a blast. Hug the wall
going east - you run all the more risk of certain neighbours to the north dying
if you get them on-screen too early - and go northeast once past the spider&apos;s
web to the north. Get the Tourists (10) and head quickly to the southeast. (If
you&apos;ve nine Victims or less, just carry on going east and enter this corridor
ASAP.) Go down to the end of a passageway and to the east, and get those
Tourists (9) as fast as you can.

VICTIMS:

2. Don&apos;t hang around here - the Zombies are liable to attack a Teacher (3) to
the south, past the wall. Use a Pandora&apos;s Box if things get desperate. Head
west though for a more easily accessible Teacher (8). Switch your weapons to
the Water Pistol and the Pandora&apos;s Boxes. Now go back up that passage to the
east and directly you&apos;re out, head northwest to collect a Baby (7). Spray
wildly with your Water Pistol while approaching; if a Spider appears the other
side of the wall, where the Teacher (2) is, there&apos;s no time to lose! Get it
with your Pandora&apos;s Boxes! Immediately you have the Baby (7), go next door
(south, west, and northeast) and save that Teacher (2)! (If you got all five
Victims so far and none have died, then that really is good work...)

3. Now things can get a little more relaxed (thankfully)... head south, through
the gaps in each line of spider webs, and west to find a Baby (4) on the west
side of the level. North from this point is an Explorer (6); pick up the Water
Pistol ammo to his northwest while you&apos;re in the area. Walk south again, then
further south from where the Baby (4) was, around some bookcases, to get to a
second Explorer (5). Go round more bookcases to get Water Pistol ammo (again);
now skirt the southern wall and head east. As soon as you can, go north and
then collect the First Aid Kit that&apos;s through the door to the west.

4. The door to the north leads back to the area where you started; you could go
all the way back around using the long route you just took, but I wouldn&apos;t
think it worth bothering. So go through, then head east through a tiled area.
At the end, go north for one Teacher (3) then south for another (A). Unless, of
course, the south one is under more threat, but then you should know when to be
flexible by now...

PICKUPS:

5. East of the southern Teacher (A) is a Key, and northeast of the other is a
Chest. Also, if you omitted it before, there&apos;s more Water Pistol ammo at the
entrance to this area. Head back west through the tiled area and at the end,
northwest to find a Fire Extinguisher pickup. Walk east from there, past the
door and then northeast to obtain a Key; head south around the desk, then east
and you will find an area with two locked storage rooms that will provide you
with Tomatoes, Ancient Artefacts and one replacement Key for your troubles.

6. Return to the big room where the Fire Extinguisher and Key were, and make
use of the southern exit. In the northeast corner of this next room, you will
find a Chest. Leave this room the way you came in, and use the northern exit
from the starting room this time. Once out, head northeast around one web, and
then northwest into an office that yields a Cupboard and a Mystery Potion.
Return southeast and head north into the next room for a Cupboard; then go
southeast, and south down a corridor.

7. At the end of this corridor you should take the east turning, and get your
Bazooka out. North of here are two areas blocked off by spiders&apos; webs, one
containing a Monster Potion, the other a Bonus Level Pickup. Needless to say,
if you can get to either, you should. (And bear in mind that if you can get to
just one, it should be the Monster Potion - because then you could get to the
other if you wanted, as well, and have some monster power left over.)

8. You&apos;ve got everything now, so return to the Exit Door and leave. Remember
where it is? No? Oh dear. Well, if you&apos;re reluctant to (or can&apos;t) Bazooka-blast
through the wall to the south, it&apos;s southeast, west, north, southwest, west
along the wall, south through the door, south and southeast, east through the
tiled area, and then south or north, depending on which Teacher you saved the
last.

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You are starting on this level using a password):

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES (plus two other Victims nearby, who are in danger):

1. You will be able to get to Tourist Couple #10 in time, so use the
appropriate password to begin with ten Victims. Pause the game whenever reading
the instructions in these first two paragraphs, in order to waste the absolute
minimum of time (as you haven&apos;t got much). From your start point, head east and
then northeast around a desk to find a Key in an alcove. Head south and west
over to a door in the wall to the north. Go through and head further north
under a wooden beam; then go directly east, hugging the southern wall, and you
will come to a partition wall.

2. Head north at this point to find Tourists (10) between a couple of desks.
Collect them and then go west around the desks to reach a Baby (7). It&apos;s not
over yet - head south, west around a giant cobweb, and northeast over to a
Teacher (2). As you&apos;re going around the obstacles between you and her, you
should feel free to fire on any Spiders which are near her - not that you&apos;re
likely to hit them, as Spiders have about the most erratic way of moving of any
enemy in the game.

VICTIMS:

3. Head south from the Teacher&apos;s (2) position and then southeast between a
couple of giant cobwebs. Head southwest over to the door you opened earlier,
but don&apos;t go through - skirt the wall and continue west. You&apos;ll find a Baby (4)
in an open space north of some bookcases. Collect him and head north under an
arch, and then further north on the eastern side of a row of desks. You will
find an Explorer (6) past a desk on your east. Head northwest from him to find
a Water Pistol behind another desk.

4. Head south and out of this room again through the row of arches. In the open
area where the Baby (4) was, head southeast between a couple of bookcases into
the library area. Once in the first bay of the library area, head southwest,
southeast and southwest again to find another Explorer (5). Return north around
all those rows of bookcases to where the Baby (4) was, and head east back to
the first door you opened (the only door you&apos;ve yet opened, as it happens).
Head south in through there, and then southwest to find a Fire Extinguisher.

5. Walk southeast into a tiled passageway, heading east from a locked door to
the south. You&apos;ll find a Water Pistol where the passage opens out into a large
office; head quickly south from there to save a Teacher (A). Go east from her
location to find a Key between two desks. Return west to the end of the row of
desks and then north over to another Teacher (3) who&apos;s standing a little south
of a fireplace. Walk between the two desks to the east, and over to the
northern wall to find a Chest to open. The Tourist Couple (9) to the north will
have transformed into Werewolves by now; head southeast to move the screen away
from the Teacher (8) to the northwest, and wait for the Werewolves to jump over
to you. When they do, kill them with your Water Pistol (well, you can&apos;t get rid
of them, and you haven&apos;t got anything else to use on them).

6. Head west, and out of the large office area via the tiled passageway through
which you entered. Out the other end, head northwest around a giant cobweb, and
east. Pass the first door you see to your south and enter the second one along.
Inside here are a replacement Key, and Ancient Artefacts. Exit this little
storage closet and head west to re-enter the large open space where you began
the level. Head through the door to the north and then walk northeast, around a
corner in the partition wall, and then east until you come to another wall
blocking your way. Walk north and east around this wall, and south down the
passageway. At the far end, enter the little closed-in area to the west to find
a Teacher (8).

PICKUPS:

7. Head north back up the passageway, and once out of it head to the northwest
corner of the room to find a Cupboard against the wall. Walk south from the
Cupboard, west past a giant cobweb to the north, and northwest into the far
corner of this next office area. There is a Cupboard here as well, and east of
it is a Mystery Potion. Pick up the Potion and then head south, past a couple
of rows of giant cobwebs, over to a corner in the southern wall. Go west from
here to arrive north of the library area again. Head south through the library,
around all the rows of bookcases, and you will find a third Water Pistol. Hug
the southern wall of the level and head east until the corridor you are in
opens up into a large room.

8. Head north over to a door in the northern wall, but do not open it -
instead, open the one to its southwest, to obtain a First Aid Kit. Head out of
that little cell and east along the north wall, and you will find a Chest in
the northeast corner of the room. Open it, then follow these directions to
return to the Exit Door: west, southwest, west, north past the rows of
bookcases, east, northeast at the open door, east once you&apos;re past the first
row of giant cobwebs, and south down the corridor. You now have the choice of
gambling for an opportunity to collect the Bonus Level Pickup, and a Monster
Potion as well.

9. The gamble in question is to use your Mystery Potion now in the hope that
you will turn into the Purple Monster, and be able to get through the giant
cobwebs that block off the two items. If you drink it and you are successful,
then head east from the Exit Door, past the corridor heading north, and then
head north in the open area to find the section of the level where the two
pickups are located. If successful, you should also go and get Tomatoes from
the storage cupboard you ignored earlier, in favour of collecting Ancient
Artefacts and a First Aid Kit. That&apos;s east of the area where you started the
level.

17-B) BONUS LEVEL: SOMEPLACE VERY WARM srch3b17

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

You&apos;ll easily save all the Victims, but the pickups are another matter. They&apos;re
strewn around pools of lava, guarded by Fire Babies that constantly spawn
inside. A Monster Potion will help - as will dexterity and speed of thought if
it wears off.

MONSTER LIST: Fire Babies (intensity: medium, location: in the northwest area
 with lots of lava pools)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Three Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 First Aid Kit
 Extra Life

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: You could use Soda Cans against the Fire
Babies, but this will be difficult due to the random way in which they move
about and also because the Soda Cans are not much defence when they get near
you and come after you. Using the Monster Potion to transform into the Purple
Monster and then wandering around punching them out of existence will allow you
to rack up points surprisingly quickly, but you should not use more than two
Potions for this because you will certainly want them later on.

-----

VICTIMS:

Walk north for Tourists (7), then west for two Cheerleaders (2 and 9) and an
Explorer (8). Walk south and then turn to head west for another Explorer (6), a
Baby (5) and a Teacher (4). North of here is a Baby (3), and two Soldiers (A
and 10) who stand right at the start of a somewhat more dangerous area
containing pickups...

PICKUPS:

Move to the northwest corner of the clear area in which you are standing -
there should be a rock wall to the west and a lava pool to the north - and then
use a Monster Potion. You&apos;ll be able to walk across the lava pools, and defeat
each Fire Baby with a single punch. Now follow the following directions:

- North to a Bonus Points Pickup.
- Southeast to a Mystery Potion.
- East to a Pandora&apos;s Box and Bonus Points Pickup occupying the same space.
- North to a Pandora&apos;s Box.
- West to Water Pistol ammo.
- North to a Pandora&apos;s Box (again).
- Northeast to a First Aid Kit.
- East to a Bonus Points Pickup.
- Southeast from there to a passageway, which leads to a Weedkiller pickup and
 an Extra Life.
- Exit the passageway and then head west, skirting the wall to the south. Head
 south at the earliest opportunity to find a Key.
- Carry on to the south.
- Find a Bonus Points Pickup to the east when you come to the end of a short
 passage.
- Finally, head southwest to find the Exit Door again, near where you collected
 the Soldiers.

If the Monster Potion wears off before you finish, then unless you have not got
anywhere near the end of the above route, it is probably not necessary to use
another. Experienced players should be able to collect all the items before the
time runs out.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

18) THE TERROR IS BACK IN: LEVEL 18: SQUIDMEN OF THE DEEP srch318

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

It&apos;s a secluded beach, peaceful and beautiful... except for the local wildlife.
It&apos;s not indigenous wildlife either, know what I mean? Well, if you don&apos;t, I&apos;ll
explain: Squidmen! They have this level for themselves, and it pretty much
provides a showcase for everything they can do to make your life difficult.
This includes, but may not be limited to: appearing suddenly next to a Swimming
Pool Guy and killing him; jumping out of the water to land right next to a
Victim, and killing him; and killing Victims while you jump into and out of the
water. If you&apos;re prepared, though, with a little luck you should come out of
this level with not many fewer Victims than when you entered.

MONSTER LIST: Squidmen (intensity: from low to medium, location: everywhere)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: There aren&apos;t any pickups at all.

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Fish Fry Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: You can beat up Squidmen and receive the Fish
Fry Bonus, or you can... not. They&apos;re hard to fight without losing health, they
don&apos;t give good value in points per water pistol shot (and will frequently jump
out of the way), and it takes a while, so I really don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth it,
personally.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. East of your start point is a Cheerleader (3). Northwest of her are a pair
of Tourists (2). After picking them up, head south again until you see palm
trees to the southeast. Turn on your Victim Radar and move so that the dot to
your west is due west, rather than at all north or south of you. At this point,
use a Ghost Potion, and then walk due west (ghosts can walk over water) and
collect the Swimming Pool Guy (9).

2. Head north from him; you will come to a jetty where there is a Baby (8) - be
careful not to walk into the posts, as the ghost is unable to walk through
them. North of the Baby, back in the water, is a Swimming Pool Guy (7). After
you have him you should go due east, then northeast and through a passage when
you reach the coast. Walk onto the water at the end and immediately collect the
Swimming Pool Guy (10) to the north; followed by the Tourists (6) to his north.

3. Head west until you reach another jetty; then jump into or walk onto the
water that&apos;s to the south. You need to approach a Victim quickly, so jumping in
near him will not do. If you are still a ghost, then you cannot lose your ghost
status while on the water, so do not worry about that. Once in or on the water,
head west until you see the end of the jetty to the north, then go north past
it and rescue the Swimming Pool Guy (5). Hop out onto, or just walk onto, the
dune island. If you are still a ghost at this point then wait until you return
to human form before proceeding - you will be approaching a Victim on land, and
so if it wears off before you reach him, you will be delayed by a couple of
seconds, which could prove fatal for the Victim.

4. When you are ready, head north along the island, and rescue a Baby (A)
standing at the far end. Squirting your Water Pistol as you approach will do
you no harm, but could save the Baby&apos;s skin, so I&apos;d recommend it. Dive in to
the east, and swim directly to shore. Once out, head north to the final Victim,
a pair of Tourists (4). You should then pause the game, and read the preamble
to level 19, below. Heh! You know what this means...

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

19) LEVEL 19: NIGHTMARE ON TERROR STREET srch319

-----

DIFFICULTY: 5/10

You should not have a huge amount of trouble with this level, provided that you
get it right with the Tourists. One other Victim needs care to make sure she
gets out alive, but apart from her and the Werewolves you&apos;ve no worries. There
are a lot of (fairly mundane) items though, hence the size of the walkthrough.

NEW MONSTER: Werewolf (you may or may not have come across these previously,
but you will definitely come across them on this level)

MONSTER LIST: Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 38 seconds: #&apos;s 6, 7, 10
 and 4; spawning randomly after about 60 seconds, intensity:
 from low to high, location: everywhere)
 Zombies [Vicious] (intensity: high, location: along the centre
 road)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit
 Two pairs of Speed Shoes

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Go to the road in the centre of the level and
rake it in, massacring the Zombies. The constantly spawning Werewolves will
cause you some problems, mind. Try using the Weedkiller on them if you use up
all your Silverware.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. It&apos;s those Tourist-Werewolves again! You will need to move around the
neighbourhood very efficiently to save all four of the Tourist Couples from a
fate worse than... well... actually it&apos;s roughly equal to death with you
around, I suppose. Use of the Speed Shoes is not necessary, but if you&apos;re
inexperienced or unconfident then have them ready for use as soon as the level
loads up. Of course, if you have four or five Victims then you could make
absolutely sure of getting your single Tourist Couple by ignoring the first
section of the walkthrough below, and instead heading west along the road, then
northwest and round the wall at sight of the first lamppost to the north.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. Go southeast, through a hole in the hedge, and south into the graveyard.
After passing three rows of gravestones there is a Tourist Couple (6) to the
west, and further on, an Explorer (5). Continue west, through a hole in the
western hedge, and around to the north and into the open door. Inside this
house is another Tourist Couple (7), to the northwest. After you have them,
head out the western exit. Go northwest, ignoring the trampoline, to find
Tourists (10), and then jump over the wall using the trampoline (to the south).
Join the tarmac path and head north until you come across a tree, directly in
front of you, on the other side of the road; then head northwest, around the
end of the wall, and rescue the fourth and final Tourist Couple (4). There is a
Barbecue Guy (A) to the southwest, whom you should also collect.

VICTIMS:

3. If you need a health refill, pick up the Burgers lying on the floor near the
barbecue stand; each provides a maximum of three bars of energy. Head northeast
out of the small yard, then head south and follow the road west. At the end is
a lamppost with a Key at its base. Having picked that up, head northwest into
the passageway and go to its end; there is a Bin to open. Enter the door and
open a Cupboard, then exit again. Head southwest into the passageway and then
south to its end, and continue south past the road into another. Walk southeast
through the ivy tunnel, and you will find a Water Pistol as you exit. Also,
southwest of the Water Pistol is a Key.

4. Enter the house to the south using the door to your east. As soon as you
enter, head southwest to pick up a Teacher (2). After you have her, collect a
nearby First Aid Kit and then open all three Cupboards. Head northwest out of
the kitchen to find another Cupboard; then over to the eastern side of the
front room, and through the door to the south. In here you can find a
replacement Key, and another Cupboard. Leave the house using the entrance by
which you came in. Head east, and southeast when you come to the path leading
north again. South through the break in the fence is a small area containing an
American Football pickup. Go north, along the path, and once on the other side
of the road, northeast. Go through the break in the hedge, and northeast to
find two Keys in a corner.

5. Leave the cul-de-sac and head south past trees, then east when you reach the
hedge. Enter the house through the door to the northeast. Inside and to the
west are two Cupboards; to the north is another locked door, through which are
two Keys and a Cupboard. Head south out of the house, then switch your weapons
to the Water Pistol and Pandora&apos;s Boxes. Walk southeast and across to the end
of the hedge, where you will see a Cheerleader (9). Collect her quickly; should
a Zombie or Werewolf get near her, you will have to decide whether it&apos;s best to
shoot with the Water Pistol or open up a Pandora&apos;s Box.

6. From the Cheerleader, go northeast, past a wall, and open up a Bin. Enter
the large room in the house to the east, rescue a Teacher (8) and open up the
Cupboard to her north. Open the door into the passageway to the north, and
check out another Cupboard; then walk east along the passageway and south
through another door. In the next area, collect a Baby (3) and a pair of Speed
Shoes, and open one more Cupboard. You can get another pair of Speed Shoes if
you hang around, which you&apos;ll find useful. Unless you are playing through for
the first time and don&apos;t want anything spoiled, you should read the preamble to
level 20, below.

PICKUPS:

7. Blast your way out southwards using your Bazooka. Be careful not to launch
yourself backwards into the Exit Door! Head directly south, across the road and
in through the hole in the fence, back to the graveyard. Walk south and you
will find a Key slightly to the east; south of this Key is a little shed
containing a Cupboard and some Weedkiller. Exit the hut and head southwest;
Bazooka blast through the hedge to reach a second pair of Speed Shoes, in the
alleyway.

8. Exit the alleyway and head west, through that gap in the fence that you used
before and out into the little passage. Head north and around the wall, into
the house. Open a Cupboard that&apos;s to the west of the entrance, head north past
that for a Key, then go south again and open a door into a small room
containing a Cupboard. Exit and go north for another Cupboard; and walk around
the partition wall to head north, and find one final Cupboard at the northern
end of the house.

9. Head southeast and exit the house the way you came in; if you now head
persistently northeast you&apos;ll come to the break in the wall you made earlier,
inside which is the Exit Door. You can leave now - but bear in mind that those
Burgers around the barbecue stand are good for what ails you, if you left any.
And as I said, unless you are playing through for the first time and you don&apos;t
want anything spoiled, you should read the preamble to level 20, so that you
know the best way to start the level.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

20) LEVEL 20: INVASION OF THE SNAKEOIDS srch320

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10 to 5/10

If you haven&apos;t played this level before then you will probably find it quite
hard to fight the Snakeoids. But, there&apos;s a first time for everything, so get
stuck into it. As with a lot of things in this game, it is easy when you know
how (and it&apos;s easier with a Monster Potion than without).

NEW HAZARD: Cacti. If you walk into a cactus, then you get hurt. Surprising, I
know.

NEW MONSTER: Snakeoid

MONSTER LIST: Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: high, location: two
 places)

BOSS: Snakeoids (three)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bazookas
 Ancient Artefacts
 Pandora&apos;s Box
 Three Skeleton Keys (you&apos;ll use all three, unless you&apos;ve
 only one Victim, in which case you get to keep one.)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Shooting Zombies in the northwest.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. The Snakeoids are huge green worm-like creatures that burrow around
underground, and then pop out when near you, or a Victim - to bite. A
Snakeoid&apos;s weapon, though, is also its weakness - they take damage when you
attack their faces. You start near two of them, and there&apos;s another elsewhere
in the level. The weapons you should ideally use against them are a Monster
Potion (for the first two) and Plates (for the last one). You probably have
twenty Plates at this point. If you have less, then try either Bazookas or
another Monster Potion. It&apos;s perfectly possible to get rid of the last one with
regular weapons, but you might find it draining on your health, if you don&apos;t
quickly become good at judging how to keep away from its bite attack.

WALKTHROUGH:

2. You start off near two Snakeoids straight away. See those mounds of earth
moving around?... No? Well, you will if you move yourself a little as well, I
should expect. Anyway, provided they stick around - they might not! - switch to
your Monster Potions and take a swig of one. If they don&apos;t seem to have stayed
in the start area, take a look west first rather than north, as the Cheerleader
(4) up north is vulnerable to their attack.

3. The way to attack is best described thus: Your monster should get into a
position for the Snakeoids to attack him, and then keep on punching,
repeatedly. The Snakeoids pop out of the ground to attack you when they are a
certain distance from you, diagonally across the map. If one gets into a
position to attack you, then as a Purple Monster, you won&apos;t actually get hurt -
while your punches will hurt him. This is denoted by him flashing blue
momentarily with each punch - if you do not see this effect, try changing the
direction you are facing. With these first two, once one is in position, the
other may follow so that they share attacking duties. But even if it doesn&apos;t,
it&apos;ll likely stay around and continue to attack after the other has died.

4. When both of them are dead - and you&apos;ll know about it when they are -
collect the two Skeleton Keys they dropped, then head north from the start
position. You will see a Cheerleader (4) across a long pit, and you will be
able to collect a Water Pistol to her northwest. Once you have the ammo, head
south again. When you reach the wall to the south of the area, head west and
follow the path to a larger area. You will find a Soldier (5) and two Bazooka
pickups to the south.

5. Now, head northwest and follow the mine cart tracks north. You will come to
a small cavern containing an Explorer (9), to the west. To his north is a
Sandbank for you to search for goodies - if you are still in Purple Monster
form, you will have to wait to change back, as no goodies will appear if you
just punch the Sandbank down. Before opening the Skull Door, take the southeast
exit from the cavern and head over to the east side of the next large area to
find a Baby (10) and Soda Cans.

6. Return southwest to the Skull Door and go through. Walk directly north to
find a larger cavern, with multiple mine cart tracks leading into it. There is
a Tourist Couple (6) near the entrance, and to their north is a Sandbank. Take
the northeast entrance to find a cul-de-sac containing Ancient Artefacts. Exit
this, go west from there, and take the last passage leading north. At this
point you should get your Water Pistol ready; Zombies start appearing here, and
at the end of the passage, there is a Baby (3). Walk north up the passageway to
the end; when you see the Baby, get ready to move and shoot quickly if a Zombie
gets near. Collect the Baby (3), and then search the two Sandbanks along the
north wall.

7. Exit this chamber using the northeast passage, and take the south turning
when you reach it. After passing through one small Zombie-infested room, you
will come out from behind a Sandbank. Check the area behind the Sandbank, to
the eastern side of the passageway, to make sure you pick up any item which
appeared. Exit this room to the southwest and you come out from behind another
Sandbank, which you should also check. After this second one, return northeast
to the first and go east from there. Open one Sandbank up and then continue to
find a second Skull Door to open; if you have only one Victim, you can skip
this one, unless you want another Pandora&apos;s Box particularly badly.

8. If you&apos;ve two or more Victims, however, go in and stroll north to the end,
where you&apos;ll find the promised Pandora&apos;s Box as well as an Explorer (2), in
minimal danger from Zombies. Go all the way south from here until you come to
another Sandbank; with this one, though, it&apos;s easy to see whether it has given
up an item when you walk through, as you&apos;ll see it to the north. So go through,
then head east to find a total of three Sandbanks to search. Southwest of the
last one is a passageway leading south; at the end are two Cheerleaders (4 and
8), one of which (#4) you could see earlier, from the other side of that pit.
Collect them and then head north again.

9. At the northern end of the passage, turn east, and follow the path until you
come to an opening into a large area, marked by a cactus. This is where the
third Snakeoid is located; there is also a Teacher (7) on the west side of the
area, so collect her quickly before she gets licked. You should be able to
finish this last Snakeoid off using only Plates. When he pops out of the
ground, walk about a metre away and then throw a Plate in his face. He&apos;ll flash
blue if it damaged him. If you run out of Plates, then provided you hit him
with, say, ten of them, you should probably just finish him off with other
conventional weapons (starting with the Bazookas). Otherwise, if you are not an
experienced Snakeoid fighter then you may want to go for a second Monster
Potion, just to be safe.

10. If the Snakeoid seems to have disappeared at any point, you could try
heading out the way you came, using the pathway that terminated at the east
side of your current area, and searching the large rectangular mining room at
the other end. Once you&apos;ve killed him, nick his Skeleton Key and take it up
north to a Skull Door, through which is a final Explorer (A). There are no more
items, so head south to make the Exit Door open, shoot the Zombies that appear
while you&apos;re waiting, and leave straight away.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

21) LEVEL 21: THE DAY THE EARTH RAN AWAY srch321

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

You will have to stay alert, but there are no Victims particularly likely to
die. The Martians are as irritating as ever in their movements and methods of
attack, though - and the Spaceship is back, with its big laser fully
functional.

MONSTER LIST: Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Martians (intensity: high, location: everywhere)

BOSS: Martian Spaceship

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bazooka pickups
 Two First Aid Kits
 Martian Bubble Gun
 Decoy Clowns

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Alien Invasion Repelled - 9900 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Martians are hard to hit, but find it all too
easy to hit you. As such, once you have destroyed the Spaceship in order to hit
the bonus points jackpot, I&apos;d suggest leaving. But if you want to try anyway,
pretty much anywhere in the level will do, bar the pond area.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. North of your start position is a Barbecue Guy (4), and north of him is a
Baby (10). Get these two quickly, then head southeast from the Baby&apos;s location
and follow the eastern wall south to the corner for a Key. Head northwest from
that, west at the trampoline, and find two Soda Can pickups south of a bench.
Head east around the bench then north, find a gap in the fence and go through
it. If you head directly north you will find a Soldier (2), in addition to a
Bazooka pickup to his south. Head quickly north around the wall to your west,
and south through the knocked-down section, to find a Cheerleader (6).

2. Northwest of the Cheerleader (6) is a Cupboard; on the southern wall of the
room is a door leading to Bonus Point Pickups and a First Aid Kit. Head out
north and skirt the western wall heading north; you will find a Bin. Go south
until just past the first tree, then east, past a meteorite and enter a
building. First head northeast and collect a Dog (9), then loot the Cupboard on
the north wall, take the Fire Extinguisher in the little alcove at the southern
end of the room and exit west again. Head north, and once past the far end of
the building, stick to the wall, to head east then north along the edge of the
pond.

3. You will come to a Martian Bubble Gun, after which point you should take the
thin path west between pools until you come to a Soldier (8). Go north, dive
into the water on your east and swim through the gap in the fence to come out
on the north side. Head northwest and through the gap in the wall, save another
Soldier (7) and head through the door to the north. To the east are a Decoy
Clowns pickup and a Cupboard.

4. Head through the next door to the north; ignore the two Cupboards for now,
and just head northeast and out through the hole in the bathroom wall. You need
to quickly collect a Baby (5), who is to the northwest; go north around a wall,
and west into the enclosed grassy yard. There may be a Jelly Blob around here
to complicate matters. Go east back through the hole, and use the hole in the
corner wall to the south to get back into the building with the Cupboards. Open
them both, then head out through the damaged bathroom again. East of this exit
is a Key lying in the middle of the road. Once you have this you should head
southeast, then south through a gap in a fence to quickly save a Soldier (A),
who hoards more Bazooka ammo.

5. Head directly north from him, and you will find the final Soldier (3) -
naturally, with yet more Bazooka firepower - in the northeast corner of the
map. West a little way is a First Aid Kit; follow the wall south to find a Bin.
It&apos;s northeast from that Bin back to the Exit Door, but before you go through,
consider the fat bonus you&apos;ll get for blowing up the Martian Spaceship. Soda
Cans in the circular hatch when it opens up, remember...

22) THE SCARY SEQUEL TO LEVEL 7: LEVEL 22: REVENGE OF DOCTOR TONGUE srch322

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

This level is really pretty easy, despite the Vampire and Frankenstein&apos;s
Monster. It&apos;s just because there are quite a lot of things to find that it has
such a very long walkthrough.

NEW MONSTER: Vampire (if you didn&apos;t visit level 12&apos;s Bonus Level)
 Vicious Doppelganger

MONSTER LIST: Doppelgangers [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: high, location:

 Pod Plant (one)
 Vampire (one)
 Werewolves (source: spawning randomly after 10 seconds,
 intensity: low, location: in the south)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: from low to high,
 location: patchy)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Ancient Artefacts
 Bonus Level Pickup (requires use of a Skeleton Key)
 Flamethrower (the only one in the game! Also requires you to
 use your Skeleton Key, as it&apos;s in the same place as the
 Bonus Level Pickup)
 Monster Potion (be sure to collect this if you want to visit
 the Bonus Level)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The long balcony on the west side, where a
lot of Zombies are found.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Start by walking west and picking up two Keys. Quickly go back east over to
the gates, as there is an Explorer (2) nearby who can be killed if you hang
around the Key area. Open one side of the gate and head north through the
hallway; there is a Teacher (10) dead ahead. Beware - there&apos;s a slight chance
that a Mummy might appear and get her. Go east and north for another key, then
go west back to where the Teacher was, and north through a door and upstairs.
At the top, go west for a Chest. Prepare your Water Pistol and Pandora&apos;s Boxes
and head further west, then south. At the southern end of this balcony is the
Explorer (2) whom I mentioned earlier; if you&apos;ve heard any Werewolves&apos; howls,
then it&apos;s okay to have an itchy trigger finger on those Pandora&apos;s Boxes.

2. After you have the Explorer (2), walk into the eastern wall of this area.
Keep pushing east while also walking north and you&apos;ll enter a secret
passageway. Inside are several Bonus Point Pickups, and at the end, in the
open, are Ancient Artefacts. Return west and follow the balcony route north,
wasting Zombies on the way, until it opens out into a larger area (ignore the
first turn east, as you&apos;ve already been there). Walk northeast for a Chest and
go south from there, through a collapsing roof gate, and a little way east to
find an Explorer (A) in a side passage.

3. Head northwest through a collapsing roof gate for a Chest. Head east until
you come to a large open area; open a Chest on the north wall. A Vampire
attacks you at this point; you should walk into him while using Ancient
Artefacts whenever he assumes human shape. When he gives up and flies away, if
there are Jelly Blobs near the steps in the southwest, you should kill them
using the Fire Extinguisher (this is to protect a Victim whom you are not yet
able to collect).

4. Afterwards, head to the eastern wall, prepare your Pandora&apos;s Boxes once
again, and then head south. You will shortly come to a large dais that has a
Teacher (7) standing in the northwest corner. Strike any hard-to-shoot Zombies
near her down with your Pandora&apos;s Box, save her and then head back north
sharpish - for the sake of that Baby (4) in the northwest - to the place where
you fought the Vampire. In the southwest of this place is a flight of stairs.
Use it, walk south through a collapsing roof gate (picking up a Key along the
way), save a Baby (4) and head west at the corner. At the west end of this area
is a Chest, but don&apos;t bother opening it; due probably to a mistake in level
design, it&apos;s impossible to collect any item that it reveals (though you can
still get hurt if there&apos;s a Bogeyman inside).

5. In the large chamber to the north, through the two doors, is a
Frankenstein&apos;s Monster; there are also two Victims in dungeon cells to the
north. Frankie&apos;s electric bolts can sometimes zap them through the doors; your
best bet is to walk through the two doors into the room and approach him, then
when he takes notice, have him chase you into the southwest corner of the
chamber. Stay there and kill him, far away from the cells. As with the Vampire,
slay him by walking into him while using your Ancient Artefacts.

6. If you now look at the southern wall of the laboratory, you&apos;ll notice a hole
in the top of a wall. This is a secret passage; walk south into it and at the
end, turn west and sweep through a patch of weeds using your Weedkiller. Enter
the next passage to the north, and you come out in front of a Skull Door. You
did get that out-of-the-way Skeleton Key on level 15, didn&apos;t you? Excellent.
Open the door to reach a Bonus Level Pickup.

7. Now for one of the game&apos;s best hidden secrets! Walk east into the wall, and
you&apos;ll enter a secret hidey-hole. (If you don&apos;t find anything, you&apos;re too far
to the north.) Inside is the Flamethrower (walk about a bit if you don&apos;t hear
the bleeping noise immediately). This is used in the same way as the Fire
Extinguisher, but is much more precious as it does a great deal of damage to
the target. You start with four hundred ammo, which in common with the Fire
Extinguisher&apos;s ammo is lost pretty fast during use. I tend to save it for
special occasions.

8. Now, head south out through the passage, east and north through the first
passage again, back into the lab. Due north of your exit point from the tunnel
are the cells where a Cheerleader (3) and a Baby (8) are being held. Get them,
and then head east for a Monster Potion (ignore the Mad Scientist - he just
blows himself up) and south to leave the lab the way you came in. Slightly east
of your exit from the passage to the carpeted area is another hidden passage in
the south wall; walk through. At the far end, switch to your Weedkiller, and
walk south to where a Pod Plant is. Kill it (it hides a Key underneath, which
you should pick up after finishing it off, if you didn&apos;t already while standing
and sweeping), and then clear a path through the weeds to the stairs. You will
want to use it later.

9. Head east and slightly south and you will find a Dog (6) in a corner of the
paved area. South of him is a Key. Head west of him, clear a path through a
small patch of weeds (you can&apos;t evade damage by sticking close to the hedge)
and go northwest, then north for a Baby (5). To his southeast you will find
replacement Weedkiller. Head around and out of the hedge passages, then around
the weeds to the stairs at the northern side of the garden. Go northwest, and
west to the crossroads. Take a detour south, find a Key in the southeast corner
of the dais, and then head all the way north past the crossroads.

10. At the far end, open up the fancy golden curtains, head southwest for a
Bonus Points Pickup, then descend the stairs. Wait patiently for both sets of
spikes to retract before passing through. Ignore the Baby (9) to the north for
now; to the northwest of his cell is a Fire. Extinguish it and head through to
find a Key in a small neglected yard. Exit from here the way you came in, and
go southeast back to where the Baby (9) was. Collect him and then exit. What a
long and complicated level!

22-B) BONUS LEVEL: THE SON OF DR. TONGUE srch3b22

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10 to 6/10

The difficulty depends more on what equipment you have with you than anything
else. Those who&apos;ve played through from the beginning will find it pretty
simple, but those who haven&apos;t the same amount of ordnance will be stretched a
little more.

NOTE: In addition to the usual ten Victims, the Big Baby turns into a regular
Baby if/when you defeat him, which is why this Baby is labelled&quot;Extra&quot;(E) and
why there are eleven Victims overall listed in the walkthrough. This Baby does
not have to be rescued if you defeat the Big Baby after the Exit Door has
appeared (admittedly, this is only possible if you picked up an extra Skeleton
Key somewhere, or did not use one on level 20).

MONSTER LIST: Frankenstein&apos;s Monster (three)
 Werewolves (source: from a Tourist Couple on an inaccessible
 balcony, who may not be saved: #10)

BOSS: Big Baby

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: The Son of Dr. Tongue (as well as being the&quot;always there&quot;Victim, he&apos;s worth 9,999 points, so be sure to collect
 him)
 First Aid Kit
 Ghost Potion
 Pandora&apos;s Box

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 No Bazooka Fired Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: There are only four (well, maximum six)
enemies to be defeated on this level, and no way to earn further points once
they are gone.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. Dive into the channel to the east. Swim south to find a pool containing two
Swimming Pool Guys (3 and 4), and jump out onto the small platform in the
northeast corner to get a Key. Dive back in and swim west over to the other
side of the pool. There&apos;s a Baby (5) here to collect, and north through the
tunnel are two Cheerleaders (2 and 6) and a Key. Now, head back south through
the tunnel, swim east and then north and jump out to the west, and you are back
where you started but five Victims the richer.

2. To the north is the area containing the Big Baby; there are three Victims
there as well, but unlike in level 8, you will not be staying at the edge of
the arena and attacking with Pandora&apos;s Boxes. You need to keep your Pandora&apos;s
Boxes for use in defending Victims in later levels, and all three Victims are
ones which the Big Baby has difficulty killing (unlike the four Babies who were
in danger in level 8). My recommended strategy, then, is to use a Monster
Potion (as the Purple Monster can&apos;t be trampled) and quickly collect the
Victims before turning your mind to the Big Baby itself. There was a Monster
Potion on the last level, in the laboratory, so there&apos;s really no excuse not to
have one.

3. Use the Monster Potion and then walk directly north from the tunnel
entrance. (If the Big Baby comes near you, punch as you pass in case you manage
to hit and damage him.) You will find two Soldiers (8 and 9) to either side of
you; as soon as you see them, rescue first the eastern one (8), then the
western one (9) - the western Soldier is nearer the wall and slightly less
likely to be trampled. After you have the western one, make a beeline northeast
and save the Dog (7). You may now turn your attention to the Big Baby.

4. The best method of dealing with this Big Baby is just to follow him around,
punching continually. Your Monster Potion might run out before his health does,
so if this happens, evaluate what is best to do. If you didn&apos;t hit him very
much, then you could use another Monster Potion, but it&apos;s likely a waste. If
you haven&apos;t any more Monster Potions, or don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth it, move on to
Pandora&apos;s Boxes (don&apos;t worry about running out - you&apos;ll pick up two more
shortly after the battle, one on this level, one on the next).

5. Next, try Mystery Potions in case one acts as a Monster Potion. Otherwise
you are down to conventional weaponry; the best thing to use is the Bazooka,
followed by long-range things like Tomatoes, Ice Lollies, Plates and the Water
Pistol. Soda Cans are a good choice as well, but you will generally find it
hard to hit him with them unless he&apos;s standing still - in which case he&apos;s also
squirting milk at you... Your new Flamethrower, by the way, is not a good
choice at all, as it requires you to be absurdly close to him to have any
effect, and you will waste a great deal of precious ammo.

6. Once he has finally transformed into the more manageable smaller Baby (E),
collect him and the Skeleton Key he drops. If you haven&apos;t already, get the two
normal Keys in the arena (one in the centre, one in the northeast) and then
head to the northwest. Go north into the paved area; if you have ten Victims, a
Tourist Couple on an inaccessible balcony to the west now transforms into a
couple of Werewolves. These are much more easily dealt with than the Big Baby,
of course; once they&apos;ve jumped down from there - head south again if they seem
reluctant - use Silverware, or a very short blast of Flamethrower each. (You
might find that one disappears without your having to kill it.) Once they&apos;re
gone, go east once inside the paved area and open the door to find Soda Cans,
locked away in a dungeon.

7. Head west again and north to find a Skull Door, which is followed by three
more normal doors. Before you go through the doors, switch to your Ancient
Artefacts. Now, go through, and immediately you are through the last one, start
using the Artefacts; head east, wait for the electric barriers to time out and
walk past, then head northeast and north around a bank of dials on some
machinery. You will find the Son of Dr. Tongue (A), a humanoid ant and one-off
Victim worth 9,999 points (though it says you get 10,000 points, you don&apos;t
really). Now that you have all the Victims, it&apos;s time to deal with the three
Frankenstein&apos;s Monsters that you&apos;ve activated...

PICKUPS:

8. Provided you have at least thirty Ancient Artefacts left, this is very easy.
Just walk into each using the Artefacts until they blow up. If you don&apos;t...
it&apos;s still easy. You have that Flamethrower, remember? Once they are fried,
search the wall to the north for items - there are three Curtains and a Chest
to inspect. Next you should head to the southeast corner of the laboratory; go
through the three doors to find a First Aid Kit, a Ghost Potion and finally, a
little room containing Bonus Points Pickups, a Martian Bubble Gun and a
Pandora&apos;s Box. Once you have those, do exit straightaway, as there&apos;s no more to
do even in the way of bonus points.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

23) LEVEL 23: THE CAVES OF MYSTERY srch323

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

The occasional tricky Victim aside, this level is quite easy. There are a
variety of enemies to face off, but you should hopefully get through without
any casualties.

MONSTER LIST: Ants (intensity: low, location: patchy - wherever you see the Ant
 nest exits, which are conical with a hole in the top)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: high, location: one place)
 Mummies (intensity: very low, location: two places)
 Squidmen (intensity: ranges from low to medium, location:
 patchy - wherever there is water)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: low to medium, location:
 patchy)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Bazookas

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: In the southwest, where there is a Vicious
Zombie spawning ground, but you&apos;ll be interrupted by Squidmen; or in the
southeast, where there are only Squidmen in a large lake (but as I&apos;ve noted
previously, Squidmen don&apos;t give a good return on your efforts). This level is
not a very good place to score points.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Head south and into a thin passageway. At the end, kill any Squidmen who
have appeared, then dive into the water and continue south; jump out and
quickly save the Explorer (9) on the other side. Now jump back in and swim up
north again; on the north side, head southwest, and into the tunnel to the
south where the mine cart tracks are; in this cul-de-sac is an Explorer (8).
Head out and turn left to go north into a long passage. When you come out at
the other end, go northeast and collect the Tourists (3) straight away; they
could be under threat from a Mummy. North of them is a Sandbank, behind which
is a little room containing a Pandora&apos;s Box.

2. Head southwest out of there, south along the passage, east and then around
the rocks over to the water. Dive in, and swim to the east bank in the southern
area. Head northeast, and north into the tunnel. At the end are two Sandbanks;
open both up, and walk further north into the tunnel opened up by the one on
the left. Continue north and you will come to a Soldier (7) standing with
Bazooka ammo nearby; don&apos;t drag your feet, as a Squidman could jump out and
swipe him. Once you have him, head south back through all of the tunnels to the
southern edge of the level. Walk around the rock at the end and there will be a
path east.

3. Prepare your Pandora&apos;s Boxes for immediate use; the two Victims in the next
area are vulnerable to sudden attacks by Squidmen. If you see any jump out of
the water and land in the vicinity of the Victims, blast them with a Pandora&apos;s
Box straight away. Head east and at the first opportunity, north; there is a
Cheerleader (4) standing by the pond. When you have her, go southeast, around
the edge of the water, and north to save a Tourist Couple (2). Emergency over!

4. Switch to the Fire Extinguisher. Jump in to the west and head north; at the
far side, walk into the passage heading north. Round a little bend and north
takes you to an opening, with an Explorer (A) in the northwest corner; walk
west, then north in order to skirt the pit. Be quick, or a Jelly Blob might get
him - if there&apos;s one right by him, then using the Fire Extinguisher while
approaching him can&apos;t hurt matters.

5. Head around the pit again and carry on north. You will shortly come to a
mound of rock where a mine cart track ends abruptly; turn left to go west and
go for the Soldier (6) to the north when you see him. To his west is Water
Pistol ammo. Continue west, past a pond and an Ant nest exit, to find a
Cheerleader (10). Switch weapons to the Martian Bubble Gun and walk south along
the passageway. At the end is a Bazooka pickup, then a Soldier (5); an Ant
could be going for either. If so, blast it with the Bubble Gun, then collect
both and exit.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

24) LEVEL 24: WAREHOUSE OF THE EVIL DOLLS srch324

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

On this level you will need to use the Soda Cans well to avoid taking excessive
damage from the Evil Dolls (which appear absolutely everywhere). Hiding behind
the boxes and throwing Soda Cans over the top, as the Evil Dolls try in vain to
run through the boxes, is a good tactic. It can be taxing if you have not
played before, and you&apos;re bound to lose a little health.

MONSTER LIST: Evil Dolls (intensity: high, location: everywhere)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: high, location: one place)
 Lumberjacks (One)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit
 Monster Potion (if you choose to use a Skeleton Key)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The area containing lots of boxes, in the
southwest of the map. Evil Dolls appear very fast here, but due to the boxes
it&apos;s easy to hide from them, and kill them safely using Soda Cans.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. Go southeast for Soda Cans and a Water Pistol. Prepare your Soda Cans for
use and go east around the boxes, following these directions: north, east,
south, east, north, east, south, east at the first opportunity, north, and
west. You will find a Key. Head southeast through the wreckage of two boxes,
and south through a hole in the wall. Southeast of this entrance is another
Key. Go northwest out of this room, and back through the remains of the two
boxes; then go around another box to the southwest, and south through the door.
Walk through the door to the south of the toy boxes, and southeast to find a
third Key.

2. Walk out of this room using the western exit. Take the first south and turn
east. Go through the next door you come to, to the south, and go west to find a
Teacher (6). Exit this storeroom by going east, north, and then west until the
corridor opens out. To the south are a Baby (8) and a Fire Extinguisher.
Northwest of them are Decoy Clowns, and southwest of those are an Explorer (10)
and a Mystery Potion. Use your Bazooka again to blast through a weak spot to
the north, and you will find a Teacher (5), and two Keys in the small room to
her north.

3. Head south back into the open area you were just in, then south again
through an open door. Once you are in the next corridor, a Lumberjack will make
his presence known; he&apos;ll chainsaw his way through boxes, then the wall,
northwest to you. Switch to your Ancient Artefacts and kill him with them. If
you have no Artefacts, try a short blast from your Fire Extinguisher, followed
by attacking with your Weedkiller - or try taking him through the collapsing
roof gates to the northeast, so that one collapses on him...

4. Once the Lumberjack is dead, check a little east along this corridor to find
Soda Cans and a Key. Go back west and then south through the hole the
Lumberjack made. Walk past the first two rows of boxes, and head east along the
aisle. Go south once in the open area, and exit southwest to find a Cheerleader
(4). Exit this smaller clearing southeast and head east to find a Tourist
Couple (2). Now head southeast again and south along to the end. Turn west, and
use the next north turn to go north past one row of boxes. Walk west into a
dead end where you can find a Baby (3).

5. Leave the dead end and take the first north. Once at the end, turn west at
the corner and take the next south to find a First Aid Kit. Blast through the
wall to the south, in the corner, and walk south to find a Key. Now, follow
these directions to your next location: north, east at the first opportunity,
north, north around the boxes, east, south, and east to find an Explorer (9).
Go northeast past a box into a long, wide corridor.

6. If you have picked up an extra Skeleton Key in Cupboards and the like,
didn&apos;t need to use one on level 20, or for whatever reason did not use the one
from level 15 to access level 22&apos;s Bonus Level, then you could open the Skull
Door to the south. Inside, you&apos;ll find a Monster Potion, a Bonus Password
Pickup (for ten Victims on level 25 - pretty useless since you&apos;re using this
walkthrough with all the passwords anyway) and Soda Cans.

7. From the Skull Door, head east, and north through a damaged wall into an
area containing toxic waste barrels. Switch to your Pandora&apos;s Boxes and exit
using another hole in the wall to the northwest. You&apos;ll see a Baby (7) in a
room to the north; if an Evil Doll gets near him, use a Pandora&apos;s Box to teach
it a lesson. After you have the Baby (7), keep your Pandora&apos;s Boxes ready for
use, for the benefit of the last Victim, and head southeast out of the room and
east to the end of the corridor. Go through another hole to the south and along
to the end to find two Keys. To get to the final Cheerleader (A), walk north,
through a door, and to the end of the next room.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

25) HUGE DISCOUNTS ON: LEVEL 25: LOOK WHO&apos;S SHOPPING srch325

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

You are relatively unlikely to lose Victims on this level. Also, it&apos;s entirely
your choice whether or not to transform the Big Baby back to normal - so this
level is certainly not as bad as it looks at first glance.

NOTE: In addition to the usual ten Victims, the Big Baby turns into a regular
Baby if/when you defeat him, which is why this Baby is labelled&quot;Extra&quot;(E) and
why there are eleven Victims overall listed in the walkthrough. This Baby does
not have to be rescued if you defeat the Big Baby after the Exit Door has
appeared.

MONSTER LIST: Ants (intensity: medium, location: almost everywhere)
 Evil Dolls (intensity: high, location: one place)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: medium, location: one place)

BOSS: Big Baby (voluntary)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Monster Potion
 Bazookas
 Two Silverware pickups
 First Aid Kit
 Ghost Potion
 Skeleton Key (defeat the Big Baby)
 Extra Life (if you choose to use the Skeleton Key dropped by
 the Big Baby on this level, instead of saving it)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Mess around with your Martian Bubble Gun in
the northern part of the lower mall - where the two pits are, and where the
Soldier (4) was.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. You begin on an escalator, which carries you north to a balcony. Switch to
the Fire Extinguisher, then take the escalator&apos;s cue and enter the door to the
northeast. North of the entrance is an area with a box that is leaking green
slime, and a Cheerleader (8) is stationed by this. She may be attacked by a
Jelly Blob, so have your Fire Extinguisher ready for use in case one of them
gets near to her. Southeast of her is a Bonus Points Pickup, between two rows
of clothes hangers holding up unidentifiable garments. Once you have both,
leave quickly by heading south again to avoid the Jelly Bombs. Once out the
door, descend the escalator and then switch to the Bazooka. West of the
escalators is a display window to the north, which yields Soda Cans when you
blast it in using your Bazooka.

2. You should stick to the northern wall of your current area and walk west
now. At the corner you will find a Key; take it and then walk northwest to
another. You want to minimise the time you spend out in the open, so continue
west to the wall, and then carry on heading north. When you reach the corner,
go east for a Soldier (4), then return west and blast another display window in
for Weedkiller. Switch back to the Martian Bubble Gun and head back around to
the south side of those pits; collect Bazooka ammo, then hug the eastern wall
and head south, east at the corner, up the escalator, west and then north at
the top, and west at the next corner.

3. When you come to a red soda vending machine to the north, switch to the Soda
Cans. The next area has Evil Dolls. Take the first south you come to and head
around the counter to save Tourists (5). Exit the shop using the door in the
southwest corner. Go west into the next shop along; walk past the tills, then
over to the northwest corner of the shop to find a Teacher (9) and a Bonus
Points Pickup.

4. East of the Teacher, across the shop floor, is a barrier formed by a
fruit-and-veg display that bars access to a Monster Potion in a little utility
closet. Blast through using the Bazookas to reach it. If you have difficulty
finding the correct latitude to aim from, position your character so that
his/her feet are aligned with the second east-west horizontal line visible from
the display to the south. Exit by heading all the way west and then all the way
south. Once out of the door, carry on south, round a stone plant pot and into a
small warehouse. In the southeast corner of this warehouse is a pair of Speed
Shoes.

5. Exit the warehouse the way you came in, then head northeast and continue
east once you have passed the blue soda vending machine. Once past a pair of
escalators, you will find a Teacher (3) on her own on a balcony. Return west
back to the escalators and go down to the lower floor. Immediately south is a
Bazooka pickup; southwest of that is a Soldier (7) - be quick, and have your
Martian Bubble Gun ready, in case of Ants - and right by him is another Bazooka
pickup. When you have that, head east for a Key sitting in the middle of the
floor, then south to find a Baby (6) whose choice of location is a little more
prudent.

6. Use the up escalator to reach the raised area to the south. Don&apos;t bother
using the door; instead enter the storeroom to the south using one of the
already-damaged windows. Inside are two Silverware pickups - very important for
upcoming levels. Skirt the south wall and head east; to the north at the end of
the passageway is a destructible wall leading to a Bonus Point Pickup and a
First Aid Kit. Fire your bazooka at the purple cans, rather than at the
(inactive)&quot;Fun Baby&quot;boxes. If an Ant starts carrying the First Aid Kit, you
must kill it, and grab the thing before leaving the area. Go back into the
passage, west to the open area and then north and through the windows again.

7. Continue north, turn east when you come to a balcony (watch out for spawning
Ants), and once the screen stops scrolling for you, you will come across a Baby
(10) near a model in a small window. Return west, south, west and north down
the&quot;down&quot;escalator. At the bottom, turn west; when the stone plant pots
appear on the western side of the screen, turn north and walk until you come to
a pair of display windows offering you Ghost Potion and Mystery Potion. What to
do? Blast them in and take what you want, of course.

8. In some circumstances, I&apos;d now recommend defeating the Big Baby. If you have
ten Victims, then I would not recommend it (unless you&apos;re going for as many
Victims as possible), as it is principally to obtain an extra Victim. Also, if
you have few Victims but less than two Monster Potions, then I would not
recommend it, as you would expend too much of your precious firepower in doing
it - and be left with a Big Baby to fight with conventional weaponry, while
also fending off Ant attacks.

9. If you fit the job description - less than ten Victims, but a reasonably
large arsenal - then drink your first Monster Potion and start chasing the Big
Baby around, punching. It will probably last your first Monster Potion out, so
drink another once the first wears off. If it survives both, then unless you
failed dismally to do it any damage, it&apos;s probably safe to resort to
conventional weaponry like Bazookas, Water Pistol or a little of your
Silverware. When it is defeated, collect the Baby (E) and his Skeleton Key fast
- after all, both are under threat from the Ants on this level. If you are
still a Purple Monster, kill a little time punching Ants.

10. Once you&apos;ve finished (or if you decided not to start), return to the
western set of escalators and head southwest from there. Past the pair of stone
plant pots, head north and jump on the trampoline to collect a Trampoline Girl
(2). Jump off the trampoline to the southwest to reach the final area. From
your landing point next to another trampoline, head south, past the corner of a
fast food restaurant and then in via a damaged window. Go around the counter
and west to find a Barbecue Guy (A).

PICKUPS:

11. East of the Barbecue Guy (A), along the south wall, is a packet of Ice
Lollies. In the main eating area of the restaurant, to the east of the tills,
are two Burgers lying on the ground, which you can eat for three health points
each. Now, if you got a Skeleton Key off the Big Baby, you have a choice: use
it on this level, to get an Extra Life, or save it for upcoming levels, on
which you can obtain an Extra Life plus a Monster Potion (level 38) or avoid
unwanted fights or map-searching. I suggest saving it, but it&apos;s your choice.

12. If you want the Extra Life, head out of the restaurant via the window to
the northwest of the Burgers, and go north, east, and south in through the
normal door. The Skull Door is in the southwest of this little shop. Return to
the Exit Door when you&apos;re done, by heading northeast and out the door, west
along the balcony, south into the fast food outlet and south around the tills.

26) LEVEL 26: WHERE THE RED FERN GROWLS srch326

-----

DIFFICULTY: 2/10

Unless you find it particularly difficult to sweep up Pod Plants without
getting hurt, I can&apos;t see this being hard. It&apos;s quite straightforward, and
blowing up the Zombies that constantly spawn in the weed-less areas is fun that
everyone should take the time to experience.

MONSTER LIST: Pod Plants (fourteen)
 Weeds (covering certain areas of the map)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from medium to
 very high, location: patchy - all raised areas)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit
 Four Weedkiller pickups (very important for this level)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Weed Cutting Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: On the northeast dais, where Zombies appear
very quickly indeed.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Northeast of your start position are Tourists (7). In the southwest of this
paved area is Weedkiller, but save this to pick up later if you&apos;re full or
nearly full - you will want a refill. Anyhow, you now need be using the Water
Pistol. Go back to where the Tourists (7) were, and up the stairs. In the
middle of the large paved area is Water Pistol ammo. (Feel free to come back
for this later, as well - there are plentiful opportunities to go Zombie
hunting on this level.) Take the western exit out of this area, passing by a
Weedkiller pickup (unless you still need more) onto a stone walkway. You come
to another open space; take the western exit once more.

2. In the next large area, carry on over to the west side and pick up the
Tourists (4). Switch to your Pandora&apos;s Boxes, and then head south. When the
path widens out, you will see an Explorer (9) over on the right-hand side of
the screen; quickly rescue him, sacrificing a Pandora&apos;s Box for his safety if
necessary. Over on the western side of the platform is a First Aid Kit. Get it
and go north again. Pass through the area that held the Tourists and go all the
way north until you come to another large, empty dais; here, take the stairs in
the southeast.

3. Switch to your Weedkiller and go first for the Tourists (5) to the southeast
- they are standing near weeds, if not on them by now, so use the Weedkiller as
you are collecting them. Next, kill the two visible Pod Plants in whatever
order suits you. Go east to find another, then take the north route out of
here. You will come to another Pod Plant just before a fork in the path and an
Explorer (10). Collect him first for safety, then kill the Pod Plant. Take the
turning to the right and carry on. There is one Pod Plant to kill along the
way, followed by a corner turning you south. At the end of this path you find a
Tourist Couple (6), standing in front of a Weedkiller pickup - so that you
can&apos;t see it at first, but you might unwittingly collect it as you walk towards
the Tourists - and also a Pod Plant.

4. Return north and west, and take the western route this time when you come to
the fork. Again, the path turns south. After this you will come to a tunnel
leading south, with a stone roof; there are no weeds inside, so don&apos;t waste any
Weedkiller ammo. Immediately outside the tunnel is a Pod Plant; continue south
once you&apos;ve dealt with him, turn east then north, and deal with another Pod
Plant stationed just before the entrance into a little yard (overgrown, of
course). To your northwest is an Explorer (8). Collect him, then sweep up the
Pod Plant nearby. There is a Mystery Potion underneath it to be collected, if
you didn&apos;t get it already while Weedkilling.

5. Take the eastern exit from this place and head northeast in the new area for
a Cheerleader (A). Walk further east into a narrow passageway, and you will
find two Pod Plants side by side. Exterminate both and continue past them. You
are now in the large, unevenly paved area where you started the level. If you
didn&apos;t get the Weedkiller earlier, I&apos;m sure you need some now, so head south
and pick it up. Switch back to the Water Pistol and head northeast and up the
stairs. Head to the west side of the dais and pick up more Weedkiller ammo;
then finish any more Zombie-killing you want to do and collect the Water Pistol
ammo to the east, before heading north.

6. In the northeast corner of this last raised area is a Water Pistol; if you
don&apos;t need it, take the opportunity to make yourself need it by having a Zombie
massacre. Afterwards, head southwest and down the stairs, and switch to your
Weedkiller again. There is a Pod Plant to the south for you to kill, another to
its west, and one last one over to the west of that. Before getting the last
one, save the Baby (3) to its north, in case Pot Plant Snot hits it in the
meantime. Once both of those chores are complete, collect the Weedkiller ammo
to the south, in among the weeds, before going north for one final Cheerleader
(2) and exiting.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

27) LEVEL 27: DANCES WITH WEREWOLVES srch327

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

You need to be careful to approach each Victim in the right way and from the
right direction on this level, or you will find that the Werewolves get there
first. The Werewolves will also constantly harass you, so go in, quickly get
what you came for, and get out.

MONSTER LIST: Werewolves (source: spawning randomly after 8 seconds, intensity:
 high, location: everywhere)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Extra Life

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: In the southeast. Don&apos;t use up all your
Silverware, because you&apos;ll need some on the next level.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Be quick in getting to this first Victim, as this method of saving her
relies on there no being any Werewolves around yet... Head southwest, through a
hole in the hedge and then east over to a pair of trampolines. Jump onto the
northeast one, and east to rescue a Teacher (8). Head east over to a
trampoline, and jump northwest. Head west into an ivy-covered passage and turn
north. Continue to walk north until you come to more trampolines, then turn to
go northwest.

2. Collect a Soldier (9), then walk northeast to find a little hut containing a
Teacher (6) and a Cupboard. Exit and head east. You will come to another
Soldier (7) - collect him, and then use your Bazooka to blow in the front of
the hedge block to his west for an Extra Life. Continue east, around a wavy
path formed by two protruding walls, and further east until you come to
trampolines. Walk northeast between the two diagonally opposite ones for a
Water Pistol, then get on one and jump west away from them.

3. You must now approach a Cheerleader (4) who is vulnerable to Werewolf attack
- and the only way to do it is using the relatively slow mode of transport that
is the trampoline. Start by switching to your Pandora&apos;s Boxes if you have any;
bear in mind that you may need to use one immediately after landing on the
ground. Kill any werewolves of whose presence you are aware. Now get onto the
southeast of the two diagonally opposite trampolines, and jump south, twice.
When you land, hasten east and save the Cheerleader (4).

4. Jump onto the trampoline in this walled-off yard, and jump north twice. Head
north around a trampoline, east, and south past all the trees until you come
out into a big garden. Once south of the trampoline that you see in the
northeast corner of this garden, go west until you come to a Cheerleader (A)
and then quickly move southeast to prevent Werewolves from targeting the Baby
(2) in the adjoining alleyway to the west. You will find a Trampoline Girl
(10), whom you should save.

5. Jump off the trampoline to the east and you will land near a Bonus Points
Pickup, which you should collect. Walk northwest through the gap between the
two trampolines, then west over to another one. Use it to jump west into the
alleyway containing that Baby (2). Head out of the alleyway to the south, then
go northwest. Jump onto another trampoline, and jump off it to the north. Go
west into the green section of wall and you will enter a hidden passage,
covered in ivy; once you reach the western end (it occupies the whole green
rectangle that you can see), walk north and collect a Dog (3).

6. Enter the passage again and walk east to exit it, and on exiting kill all
Werewolves of which you are aware - you may re-enter the passage, but do not
stray beyond this corner of the yard that you are now in. Once all the
Werewolves are slain, use the trampoline to the northeast to jump east over the
hedge. Collect the Cheerleader (5), then head southwest to find a Key in a
little alcove. Before exiting, you should read the preamble to level 28,
below...

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

28) SCREAM IN HORROR ON: LEVEL 28: MARK OF THE VAMPIRE srch328

-----

DIFFICULTY: 7/10

Scream indeed! This level is a dramatic departure from the much simpler ones
you&apos;ve been seeing recently. First you have to save the Tourists, pronto; then
you have to search for Skeleton Keys with which to open the Skull Doors, while
saving the odd nastily placed Victim; and then you&apos;ve three Vampires to fight
before you can leave. Sound hard? It is, so pay close attention.

NOTE: Victim number 9 on this level will definitely die unless you make use of
an exploit within the game&apos;s programming (which some may consider cheating).
See section two,&quot;Tips, Tricks and Strategies&quot;, for details.

MONSTER LIST: Mummies (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Vampires (three)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 8 seconds: #s 8, 9 and
 10; spawning randomly, effectively immediately, intensity:
 medium, location: one place)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from very low to
 very high, location: patchy)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Four Skeleton Keys (needed to open the Skull Doors)
 Two lots of Ancient Artefacts
 Martian Bubble Gun

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses (It is supposed to be impossible
 to collect all ten Victims, but you can actually do so
 if you make use of the aforementioned exploit)

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: In the south, near where you start, in the
little courtyard where the Zombies spring up like weeds. And you should be
scoring bonus points, too: after all, you probably won&apos;t have ten Victims at
the end, so an Extra Bonus Victim will be just what you need.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. Here&apos;s the situation: Victims 8, 9 and 10 are all Tourist Couples, who will
transform into Werewolves after 8 seconds. #9 is in the opposite corner of the
map to you and is impossible to collect in time; #s 8 and 10 are near where you
start and can both be collected, even in the same attempt (if you know exactly
what you are doing, are using the Speed Shoes, don&apos;t try to collect items along
the way and don&apos;t screw up).

2. If you have ten Victims then you should definitely prepare for the start of
this level by switching to the Speed Shoes before you exit level 27. If you
have eight or nine, it&apos;s not necessary, but you&apos;ll have to be fast to save #8;
and since you should have plenty of pairs of Speed Shoes by now, I&apos;d certainly
recommend newcomers to the level to wear them anyway. You should take different
routes depending on how many Victims you have, in order to make sure that you
are as likely to retain them as possible. If you have seven or less Victims,
you don&apos;t need to read the&quot;Tourist-Werewolves&quot;section; just start at&quot;Victims&quot;.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

3. If you have TEN VICTIMS: Use the Speed Shoes. Run north, around a pillar
with a face carved into it, and through two doors in a passage to the
northwest. Collect the Tourists (10) at the other end, then continue north
through a collapsing roof gate and head northeast up some stairs. Walk around
onto what looks like a dead end passage; go south but before reaching the end
wall, make sure for a moment to be as far towards the eastern side of the
passage as possible. You will go straight into a secret passage that leads
south. Do not continue to press into the eastern wall, as this will slow you
down.

4. Once you can see that you are near the other end of the passage leading
south, push east as well as south and once you start heading east, abandon
pushing south. You will emerge from the passage on a landing and find Tourists
(8) at the other end of it. Collect them. You may now stop hurrying. We&apos;ll
return to the start point, in order to synchronise the walkthrough with that of
those with less Victims. Head south down the stairs, and at the bottom head
west. At the fork in the path, head south to the grassy area where you started.

5. If you have EIGHT OR NINE VICTIMS: Use the Speed Shoes if you want. Head
north, and then east once up the stairs. When you get the opportunity to head
north, take it; you will go up some more stairs and find Tourists (8) at the
top. Collect them. You may now stop hurrying. We&apos;ll return to the start point,
in order to synchronise the walkthrough with that of those with different
numbers of Victims. Head south down the stairs, and at the bottom head west. At
the fork in the path, head south to the grassy area where you started.

6. If you have SEVEN OR LESS VICTIMS: - Go straight to the&quot;Victims&quot;section
below.

VICTIMS:

7. Head north, then east once up the stairs. Once in the large area, head to
the southeast corner and continue east. Wait for the spikes to retract before
crossing, and on the other side of them, head north, then west. You will come
to a protruding stone wall; walk around it to the north and carry on to the
west. When the path widens out, switch to your Pandora&apos;s Boxes; wait patiently
again for the Spikes, and cross them to find an Explorer (5). There is a Baby
(4) to the northeast - if you see Zombies anywhere near him, let rip with a
Pandora&apos;s Box. Collect the Key, then head north up the stairs. There&apos;s another
Key just at the top, to the east. In the north of this area is a Chest, and
near it, the first of the Skeleton Keys that you need to find.

8. Be ready with your Water Pistol. Go east, then south down a narrow
passageway to an open area containing a Baby (4). Return north, around the wall
to the east and down the stairs. Once down, go east and then south, and pick up
Ancient Artefacts on the way. At the other end of the passage, follow these
directions: west, south, east, straight on, straight on, north, west and north.
You should now be in a large chamber with bones scattered across the floor.

9. Switch to your Flamethrower, or failing that, your Fire Extinguisher; you
may need to spray one of these ahead of you to protect a Victim from Zombies
and Werewolves as you approach. (Odd that, protecting someone by pointing a
Flamethrower at them and firing.) Exit the chamber using the wide passageway to
the north. When the path widens out into a courtyard, with two pillars to the
east, head northeast and collect an Explorer (7). In the southwest of the
courtyard you are in is a door. Go through and up the stairs. North of the
stairs are more Ancient Artefacts. Go downstairs again, northeast and then out
of the courtyard using the carpeted passage to the north.

10. Before you go to Victim #9 - a Tourist Couple - you should note that while
it is supposed to be impossible to save them, there is a way to trick the game
into letting you collect them. You should check section two,&quot;Tips, Tricks and
Strategies&quot;, for more details. Assuming you&apos;re not bothered or don&apos;t have that
many Victims though, switch to the Silverware now. At the first opportunity,
head east, then north. At the northern end of the passage, if you have ten
Victims, you&apos;ll find the aforementioned pair of Tourists (9), and they&apos;ll
promptly transform into Werewolves. Naturally, you should slay them both.

11. Walk north through the collapsing roof gate and collect a second Skeleton
Key. Next, head west until you come to a large set of spikes. In order to deal
best with these (since they are activated in precisely the wrong order for you
to best manage them), you should hug the southern wall as you pass. Stand as
far to the south as you can in the area just east of them; then, once the
northern block has risen, walk onto the southeast block and south to stay next
to the wall, where there is a thin strip of an invisible pathway that has no
spikes. Walk west to pass.

12. Once past the spikes, switch to your Water Pistol. A lot will happen in the
next few seconds, so read through this paragraph before you begin... Head north
and west. You will see a Cheerleader (3) to the south. A Vampire will appear,
with an evil laugh, and begin to circle her. Just continue west, regardless;
he&apos;ll forget about her and come after you. You will come to a Teacher (6) at
the end of the hallway, and she may be under threat from Zombies, so
trigger-happiness with your Water Pistol is encouraged. After you have her,
wait for the Vampire to arrive, and cane him with your Ancient Artefacts.

13. Once you&apos;re done with all that, head south and pass the spikes with careful
timing. Continue south - after a bit of a walk, you will reach a collapsing
roof gate accompanied by a turn to the east. If you had ten Victims when you
started the level, then the gate will be blocked; for everyone else, it will be
blocked shortly. Blast it down with a Bazooka shell when you need to, anyway.
Go through, collect two Keys and then return north again, through the gate.

14. Northeast of the gate is a flight of stairs - go up and you will find a
third Skeleton Key and two chests at the top. Head south down the passage to
the east, which seems to be a dead end - walk into the end wall on the east
side, and you will find that it&apos;s a secret passage that may be used as a
shortcut. When you get to the end of the passage south, walk east and you will
come out onto a landing near the first Skull Door.

15. Switch to your Ancient Artefacts. Walk north through three Skull Doors and
go east slightly, then north a little more; two Vampires should appear and
start attacking. Lead them south to the anteroom that followed the first Skull
Door, and slay them both, ideally with Ancient Artefacts. When both are dead,
continue north from the point you reached last time, passing a turning towards
some stairs to the east, and you will find the Cheerleader (3) you ignored
earlier on a raised dais. In the northwest of the dais is a Key, and south of
that is a sunken chamber containing a fourth Skeleton Key and Bonus Points
Pickups.

16. Go north out of there, east and south. Take the east turning and go down
the steps. At the bottom, go all the way east and you will enter a secret
compartment in the wall that contains Martian Bubble Gun. (If you don&apos;t hear a
bleep to indicate that you&apos;ve picked something up, then press north into the
wall of the compartment before moving west to exit.) Go west a bit, and move
north up another passage. Open the final Skull Door at the end, and head east,
then south. Locked away behind a door is Mystery Potion. Once you have that,
walk north again. There are two cells right next to each other; the one on the
right holds a Baby (2), while the one on the left holds a Cheerleader (A).

BONUSES:

17. Unless you still have ten Victims because you used the exploit to save the&quot;impossible&quot;Tourist Couple (9) - see the&quot;Tips&quot;section *still to be added* -
you&apos;ll want to earn yourself an Extra Bonus Victim. If you haven&apos;t already
gotten your score past the next multiple of 40,000 points since the beginning
of the level, then now&apos;s the time to do it. Follow these directions: Out of the
dungeons through the Skull Door, south, west, north, west, south, west, south a
long way. You will come to a courtyard that generates Zombies at a very high
rate. Get your score to the required level, then take these directions back to
the Exit Door: north, east (eventually), north, east, south, east, north and
into the dungeons.

29) MORE SHOCKING THAN LEVEL 28: LEVEL 29: ZOMBIE HOUSE PARTY srch329

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10 to 5/10

There are a lot of things which you&apos;ll want to collect, and it&apos;s a bit of a
maze, but you are not going to have too much trouble provided you have enough
Keys and Bazooka shells.

- NOTE: Starting on this level using a password is quite hard, due to the
monsters present, the occasionally difficult Victims, and the number of locked
doors blocking your progress (while there is also a dearth of Keys to find)!
Level 30 exhibits the same problem. As such, I do not recommend beginning on
this level. Starting on level 25 and playing through the intervening stages is
a better choice.

With this in mind, this walkthrough is written with the assumption that you
have a fair amount of Keys and/or Bazooka shells to use in navigating around
the house. However, the best method, if you insist on starting on this level,
is to use one of the Crazy Lumberjacks to your advantage in clearing a path.
You&apos;ll need to be good at managing Lumberjacks while also being harassed by
Zombies and Evil Dolls, though - and the problem still remains for level 30.

MONSTER LIST: Doppelgangers [Normal] (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Evil Dolls (intensity: high, location: patchy)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Lumberjacks (two)
 Martians (intensity: low, location: around the northeast corner
 of the map)
 Mushroom Men (intensity: medium, location: one place)
 Pod Plant (one)
 Squidmen (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Werewolves (source: spawning randomly after about 55 seconds,
 intensity: low, location: the eastern and southern sides of
 the map)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from very low to
 medium, location: patchy)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Three lots of Decoy Clowns
 Two First Aid Kits
 Pandora&apos;s Box
 Bazookas
 Speed Shoes

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Either standing behind a wall somewhere,
throwing Soda Cans at the witless Evil Dolls, or shooting Zombies in the
southwest corner of the map. This is not a good level to score huge amounts of
points on.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. On the west side of the room in which you start is Water Pistol ammo and a
Cupboard. Head south and west around a partition wall to find a Cupboard in the
southwest corner of the level. Head northeast, east, north, west and north to
find Decoy Clowns next to a toy box which spawns Evil Dolls. Enter the door to
the north to find a First Aid Kit, then go south out the door and into the
passage on the east side of the wall. Head east along the passage until you get
right to the end, and open the door to the south to find Soda Cans and Decoy
Clowns. Be quick collecting them and heading away, as there&apos;s a Swimming Pool
Guy (6) to the east who could be killed by Squidmen if you give them the
chance.

2. Go north through two doors, and head west, north and east to get around the
wall. North through an open door is a Cupboard. Go round the wall to the north
and continue north through one closed door, then head west to find a Pandora&apos;s
Box. Go east again and north through another door, and then head northeast and
through an open door to find a Teacher (8). Exit this room the way you came in
and head west, past another open door to the north, to find a Cupboard.

3. You can now enter that other door to the north. At the end of the room is
Bazooka ammo - collect it, then save the Soldier (4) nearby. As you are
probably aware, a Crazy Lumberjack has noticed your presence, and is trying to
get through to attack you. Switch to the Ancient Artefacts and wait for him to
either break through, or walk around to the west - if you go any further north
at this stage, then you will put a Teacher (5) to the north at risk. Once he is
dead, switch weapons to the Weedkiller and the Pandora&apos;s Boxes.

4. Head around the wall or through any opening the Lumberjack made, and north
through an open door and then northwest through a closed door, and you will
come to a yard containing a Teacher (5). Mushroom Men spawn here, so collect
her quickly. Use the Weedkiller on the Pod Plant to the northeast, and then
open the Bin. Head southwest and into the now open door. To the west of the
entrance is a Cupboard. After you&apos;ve opened it, head east, south and west to
find another; there&apos;s a third one southeast of that. Return to the first one
(that&apos;s west, north, east, north, west) and then head south past an Evil Doll
spawn point.

5. To the southeast are Soda Cans. To the west of those is a Cupboard under a
sink, and south of that, round the wall, is another Cupboard. When you have all
those, head south past some furniture and through a door, east past more
furniture and north through two doors. Head northeast from here to find an open
door - don&apos;t enter it, but instead focus your attention to the cracked wall to
its southeast. Stand north of it and fire two Bazooka shells at it; you&apos;ll
destroy the wall, and also the fence on the other side, giving you access to
the garden.

6. Go through the hole in the wall, collect a Water Pistol and a Monster
Potion, and continue through the hole in the fence. You will find a Barbecue
Guy (3) and a Cheerleader (9); be careful of Squidmen jumping in from the south
to kill the two Victims. You can also eat a Burger for an instant health refill
of three bars. You will now have to approach a Swimming Pool Guy (6) quickly in
order to minimise the chances of his being killed; walk north of the trampoline
in the south of the garden, then walk up to it, jump south immediately and you
will land in the water. Collect the Swimming Pool Guy (6) before a Squidman
appears to kill him.

7. Jump out of the water in the northwest corner of the pool; there is a
Weedkiller pickup there for you to collect. Head south around the edge of the
pool, and then southeast to a door that leads into an indoor passageway. Go
west a little way for a Cupboard, then return east, past the door, and head
north, ignoring a turning to the west. You will find a First Aid Kit and a
Cupboard. Exit this room by heading out the opening in the southwest corner,
and head north and east; you will find a Key by some graves.

8. Head south and east into the house again. Go south and take the first
turning west. To the northwest is a Cupboard. Go north up a corridor and at the
end, quickly go through a door and east to save a Baby (2) from a Lumberjack.
Don&apos;t go for the Lumberjack yet - there&apos;s another Victim to save. Head west and
north into a room, through an open door; there&apos;s an Explorer (7) ahead to be
collected. Now go back to the Lumberjack and kill him with your Ancient
Artefacts. Northwest of where the Baby (2) stood, or southeast of where the
Explorer (7) stood, is a Cupboard. Open it. Head west from there, north and
then east into a little alcove to find a Fire Extinguisher.

9. Now, take these directions to find your next Victim: west, south, east,
north, east, north through a door, northwest, south, west and north around a
protruding wall, west and then northwest past a toy box producing Evil Dolls to
find a Baby (10). To his east are Speed Shoes. In the northwest corner of the
room is a Cupboard. Go through the door to the north to find more Decoy Clowns.
Head east and into the southern passage; you will find a Cupboard where it
widens out into a room. South of the Cupboard is a door leading to Bonus Point
Pickups.

10. Head north out of there, east, and south through an open door. In the
southeast of the room in which you now find yourself is a Cupboard. Head north
from there, through an open door, and find Ancient Artefacts to your east. Head
north through another open door, then walk west to find a Cheerleader (A). Read
the preamble to level 30 (don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s short - the preamble, that is)
before going through the Exit Door.

30) LEVEL 30: THE HORROR OF FLOOR THIRTEEN srch330

-----

DIFFICULTY: 7/10

It&apos;s the second (and last) level featuring only Cheerleaders, so you can get
another Ten Cheerleaders Bonus, this time on top of the regular All Victims
Saved Bonus, for a total of 2000 points!... you wish. I count five Cheerleaders
who are in severe danger of dying, and two of them are #s A and 2, so start
sweating, especially if you have less than three Victims right now.

MONSTER LIST: Evil Dolls (intensity: high, location: three places)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Mummies (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Spiders (intensity: ranges from medium to high, location: patchy)
 Werewolves (source: spawning randomly after about 50 seconds,
 intensity: very low, location: one place)
 Zombies [Vicious] (intensity: very low, location: two places)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Ghost Potion
 Ancient Artefacts
 Bazookas
 First Aid Kit

BONUSES AVAILABLE: An unusual set of Victim collection bonuses...
 50 points per Victim saved
 Ten Cheerleaders Bonus - 1000 points (for each player)
 All Victims Saved Bonus - 1000 points (for each player)
 You Saved More Victims Bonus - 1000 points (two-player mode)

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: South of Cheerleader #2, there is a little
room with a Cupboard in it. Adjoining this room to the east is a corridor
containing a toy box, from which Evil Dolls spawn quite frequently. Stand in
the safe room and throw Soda Cans over the wall at the Evil Dolls. This is
slow, so unless you have a real need for an Extra Bonus Victim, wait for the
next level.

-----

PREAMBLE:

You must pause the game as soon as the level loads up if you&apos;ve nine or ten
Victims.

VICTIMS:

1. You start northwest of a pair of Cheerleaders (9, to the east, and 10, to
the west). North of them, and east of you, is a toy box from which Evil Dolls
spawn. At any moment, an Evil Doll could jump out, dash over and get one, if
not both of them before you have even had the presence of mind to start moving.
With this in mind, as soon as you unpause the game, you must head southeast and
grab both Cheerleaders (10 and more urgently, 9) pronto, before an Evil Doll
can get there. Got that? Good. Go.

2. You probably collected the Soda Cans in passing, but if you didn&apos;t, return
to your start point and get them. North of there is a Chest, and southwest of
that is a Key. Now head over to the northeast corner of the room, where you
will find three more Keys in a row. Head southeast and you will come to an area
containing two huge spiders&apos; webs. On the north wall is a door; enter. Once
inside the next room, switch weapons to the Water Pistol and Speed Shoes. You
are going to approach two Cheerleaders (2 and subsequently 8) who are in great
danger of being killed, so you will need to be quick. Read paragraph 3 in full,
so that you will know what to expect.

3. Use the Speed Shoes, then switch your special item to the Pandora&apos;s Boxes
(that&apos;s likely to be five presses of the A button if you have been playing for
a while and have picked up a lot of items). Run north through the next two
doors and then north around the wall with the chest in front of it. Save the
first Cheerleader (2). As you approach, squirt liberally with the Water Pistol,
in case a Spider appears and goes for her. Do not worry about the other
Cheerleader (3) who may be seen to the southeast; she is safe. Switch to the
Bazookas and pause the game; read paragraphs 4 and 5 in advance.

4. Now, look at the line of giant spiders&apos; webs to the north. Two unbroken webs
are side by side, but next to them on the east is one that has been broken.
Stand south of the broken web and fire your Bazooka northwards. This is in
order to break another web to the north ahead of time; so that you are
guaranteed a quick approach to the next Cheerleader (8) you need to collect. Be
ready to use the Pandora&apos;s Boxes, as the approach to this Cheerleader (8) is a
long one.

5. Switch to the Fire Extinguisher this time, as there may be Evil Dolls
threatening the Cheerleader (8) as well as Spiders. Go north, west around the
desk, through the broken web to the north of the desk, through the door to the
north of the web, and east, to save the Cheerleader (8). This one, I&apos;m afraid,
can often get killed before she even comes into your view, even if you are
using the Speed Shoes; nothing much you can do about that, unfortunately.

6. In the southeast corner of the room you are now in is a Key, and in the
northwest corner is a Cupboard. Once you have both, leave the room via the door
you came in by and continue south. Take the first opportunity to turn east; to
the north in this next side-corridor are a Key and a Cupboard. Return to the
southern end and then go southwest until you reach the corner of the office.
Open the Chest, and then go south through a door into the next room. West of
the door is a Cupboard to be opened.

7. Head south again into another room, with another Cupboard in the same
position as in the last room. Head east to the other end of the room, and pick
up two Keys before going through the door. Take the next door, to the
northeast, straight away, to avoid the Evil Dolls. In the next room after that,
head northwest to find a Cheerleader (3) and then a Key. Go southeast from
there and in through the door in the north wall at the southeast end of the
room.

8. Blast through the cracked wall to the north with your Bazooka, and step out
onto the sloped roof (don&apos;t worry, you can&apos;t fall off). Walk north and you will
see a window fitting with a room behind it, containing a First Aid Kit. Stand
south of the window fitting and blow it open with the Bazooka (curiously, the
recoil does not force you off the roof either!). Get your Water Pistol out, as
a Mummy could appear and attack once you are inside, and then enter to get the
First Aid Kit, and exit quickly.

9. Once on the windowsill again, head east and then north to find Weedkiller,
and then head south, all the way west and south again to re-enter the room from
which you originally accessed the roof. Go east and south, and blow down the
wall to your south to find a Ghost Potion. Do the same to the wall at the end
of this little room; go through the hole, and head southwest to find a Cupboard
to be opened. Then, take the following directions: northeast, north through the
room that contained the Ghost Potion, southwest through two doors, west, north
though two doors, northwest around a protruding wall, northeast across the
floor and through a broken spider&apos;s web, and north around a desk and through
another broken web.

10. To the west is a Cheerleader (4); you should approach reasonably fast so as
not to give Werewolves a possible chance to kill her. Head west along the
corridor until it widens out, then head south and through a door and you will
find the Cheerleader (4) standing (jumping) on a balcony. Now, head back north
through the door and west to the corner of the room, to find a Key. Head north
through a broken Spider&apos;s web, and then head west until you come to a Chest. Do
not take the time to open it yet, but instead head south to find a Cheerleader
(6) next to some bookcases. South a little and east to the end of the southern
aisle, you will find a Key.

11. Head west, northeast a little, and north over to that Chest you saw
earlier; open it now. Head southeast and once past the partition wall, south;
go through two doors to find a Cheerleader (7) standing in a small room. To her
north is a Cupboard, and to her south is a window fitting, which may be blown
down with the Bazooka. Do so, go through and head west and north to find
another window fitting, to which you should give the same treatment to access
Bonus Points Pickups and Ancient Artefacts.

12. Go back through the window, south, east and north to return to the room
where that last Cheerleader (7) was. Exit it through the southeast corner and
head southeast all the way through the next room as well; you will find a door
in the south wall at the end, so go through it. Open the Cupboard to its west,
and collect the two Keys south of the Cupboard. Walk around the wall to your
east and continue south to find a Cupboard at a corner.

13. Head south from the Cupboard, then east and north through the door.
Continue north, around the desk and through the broken web, and head east in
the corridor that follows. At the far end, take the door to the north for a
Cupboard, and a Bazooka pickup that grants you ten shells instead of five. Head
south out of this little utility room, west and south through the web again.
When you pass the desks, instead of using the door, head to the southeast
corner of the office, where an already broken window fitting allows you to walk
out onto the sloping roof.

14. Walk out, then, and head east, north, east again and finally north again.
At the other end of this path, you will find two Keys. Return south, west,
south and then west until you come out onto a balcony with a little plant in
the corner. Switch to your Bazookas and head west over to the other side of the
balcony. You&apos;ll see a damaged wall to the north. Inside the room beyond this is
a Cheerleader (5), but before you get her you will want to save another one to
the north who is in much more danger than her, from Spiders. With this in mind,
aim squarely at the damaged wall and fire not one, not two, but three Bazooka
shells north at it. Now, read the whole of paragraph 15 through before doing
what is says, so that you are prepared.

15. Switch to the Water Pistol and use a pair of Speed Shoes (yes, two pairs in
the same level, I know, but that&apos;s how hard it is). Switch your special item to
the Pandora&apos;s Boxes (five presses of the A button, remember), and then run
north. Once you see the Cheerleader (A) to your north, past a broken-down
interior wall, start sloshing Water Pistol fire about the place, and if you see
any Spiders appear that look as if they will get her before you get them, let
rip with a Pandora&apos;s Box. Once you have saved her, return south through the
hole in the wall, then through the door, and save the other Cheerleader (5)
too.

PICKUPS:

16. North of where that safer Cheerleader (5) stood is a First Aid Kit. Collect
it, then exit via the door to the north and head west along the corridor. At
the end is a Key. Go east again, and north into the room where the Cheerleader
(A) stood who was in more danger. In the northwest corner is a Cupboard; open
it. Now go out the door to the north and northeast past a toy box; you will
come to a fork in the path. To the east is a Chest, to the north is a Cupboard;
open both in whatever order you want, and then head southwest back into the
room where the endangered Cheerleader (A) stood.

17. Head south out of the room and into the corridor; now go southeast, through
a broken web, and into a small, featureless room. In the northeast corner is a
web that is not broken; blast it down with the Bazooka and go through the hole
you made, then east and south to find a Key in among the webs. Follow these
directions to obtain one more Key: north, west, south, west, north, west, south
through first a door then a ruined wall, east along the balcony and then around
its barrier onto the sloping roof, north where the drainpipe goes north, east
around the chimney outlet and further north, west and south. Now follow these,
to return to the Exit Door: north, east, south, west onto a balcony and over to
the other side, and north through a ruined wall.

31) LEVEL 31: LOOK WHO&apos;S COMING TO DINNER srch331

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

You should not have much trouble with this level. There is only one Victim in
particularly serious danger - a Baby (8) who is stationed right next to a Crazy
Lumberjack - and he can still be rescued if you try the sneaky method I&apos;ve
prepared. And succeed, naturally.

MONSTER LIST: Doppelgangers [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: very high,
 location: one place)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: two places)
 Lumberjacks (two)
 Mushroom Men (intensity: high, location: one place)
 Pod Plant (one)
 Squidmen (intensity: from very low to high, location: patchy -
 wherever there is water)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: from high to very high,
 location: two places)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two First Aid Kits
 Bazookas

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The graveyard area in the southwest corner of
the level. Zombie massacre! Yes!

-----

VICTIMS:

1. Walk north and into a little hut, in which can be found a First Aid Kit and
also a Cupboard in the northwest corner. Exit the room again, and head east,
south around the end of a wall, and then northeast to find a Baby (3) standing
between a fire and the edge of the water. (Not the safest place to put a baby,
really, even when there aren&apos;t any Squidmen around.) You should be quick, as a
Squidman will probably jump out and land by the Baby (3) in order to kill it
fast. From the Baby, walk northwest into a copse of trees, at the end of which
is a Fire Extinguisher.

2. Head south again all the way over to the water, and jump in (there&apos;s no
point in extinguishing the fire - there&apos;s nothing in it, and you don&apos;t get any
bonus points). Jump out again on the other side of the channel, and continue to
head south, winding through the trees. When you reach the southern wall of the
level, move into the corner to the west formed by the two walls, and stay there
until you are satisfied that there are no Squidmen still coming after you (this
is a measure to protect the next Victim). Head east and jump into the water
quickly, the better to save the Swimming Pool Guy (7) who&apos;s in there.

3. Swim north, jump out of the pond at its northern end, and then straight back
into the channel further north. Continue north; when you next come to a turn to
the west, take it and hug the south bank, in order not to get close enough to
the Cheerleader (6) to the north for a Squidman to jump out and kill her. If
you see any Squidmen appear in the water to the north or northwest, it might be
an idea to quickly head south away from there so that they don&apos;t get to kill
the Cheerleader (6). Swim west until you come to the edge of the lake; jump
out, then head north and once at the northern end of the map, east. You will
quickly come to the Cheerleader (6), near a tree. To her east is a hedge block;
blow the front in with your Bazookas to reveal a First Aid Kit.

4. Still keeping the Bazookas as your primary weapon, head west along the
northern edge of the level and when your path widens out, you will find another
hedge block to Bazooka. This one contains Mystery Potion. Being careful to
avoid the Jelly Blobs&apos; Jelly Bombs, head out of the hedge block and in through
the damaged hedge to its west. Switch to the Weedkiller and then continue west.
As soon as you reach the yard full of weeds, start sweeping but continue
walking west, and you will come to an Explorer (5), relatively safe, near the
northwest corner of the level. Southeast of his location is a Pod Plant, which
you should kill.

5. There are two Keys to pick up among the weeds, near where the Pod Plant was.
The first one you should get is the one to the east. Once you have it, walk
back through the path you&apos;ve cleared, and then make a new one south to get the
other Key. Once you have this second Key, do not move east or west, but just
move south by degrees until you can see the top of a hedgerow. Get out your
Bazooka and fire it at the hedgerow so as to make a hole out of the westernmost
weak spot.

6. Once the hole has been made, retreat north and then east, to the end of the
alleyway where the entrance from the lakeside area is. This is to clear the
machine&apos;s memory of monsters in the vicinity of the next Victim, a Cheerleader
(9). Once at the eastern end of the alleyway, switch back to the Weedkiller; go
west again and south over to where the hedge was, continue south, cutting
through the weeds, and go through the hole in the hedge for the Cheerleader
(9). Do not go east at all! This is a precaution to avoid the death of a Baby
(8) who is very near a Lumberjack who starts over there.

7. After you&apos;ve saved the Cheerleader (9), switch back to the Bazookas and look
west; blow a hole in the hedge to the west, go through and then head south to
the end of the alleyway to get a (different) Baby (4). Go north out of the
alleyway and you&apos;ll find yourself back in the area overgrown with weeds. Read
through paragraphs 8 and 9 in full before beginning, so that you know what you
need to do.

8. Position yourself at the southeast corner of this clearing, right next to
the southern wall (where there are no weeds, so you won&apos;t need to walk along
using the Weedkiller) and switch to the Fire Extinguisher. Walk east until you
come to a second gap in the hedge (the first having been made by you,
yourself). Do not wait around here - Jelly Blobs are liable to attack the Baby
(8) whom you are trying to save, with Jelly Bombs, at this point.

9. Head south through the gap, and east around another hedge - to your
southeast now is the Lumberjack, and to your southwest is the Baby (8). The
Lumberjack will wave his axe (or rev his chainsaw) for a moment, then (try to)
stride towards the Baby and chop its head off. The best way of preventing this
from happening is to stand near to the hedge (but not right up next to it) and
spray your Fire Extinguisher southwards so that the Lumberjack is caught in the
blast, and frozen - then you can nip over and collect the Baby (8) for
yourself.

10. Kill the Lumberjack using your Ancient Artefacts, and then head north
again, back through the hole in the hedge and into the field of weeds. Switch
to your Weedkiller (last time, I promise) and go over and collect the Water
Pistol ammo that&apos;s just to your northwest. Head southeast again, through the
gap in the hedge and back into the copse of trees where the Baby (8) and
Lumberjack were. Head south through the trees and at when you come out at the
end, go southeast to find a Barbecue Guy (A). South of him is a little hut,
with a locked door, with a Cupboard inside.

11. Exit the hut after opening the Cupboard, head northwest over to stand just
south of the barbecue stand, then directly west over to a hedge (position
yourself in the corner formed by the bend in the hedge). Another Lumberjack to
the southwest will walk towards you after a second or two; wait patiently for
him to break through the hedge - to protect a Cheerleader (2) to the southwest
- and then kill him with your Ancient Artefacts, like you did the first one.

12. Don&apos;t go through the hole in the hedge made by the Lumberjack. Instead head
north through the copse of trees again and then around the hedge to the north,
west, and south again. You will come to two more lines of hedges - go through
them, but no further south. Instead go west all the way into a corner formed by
two walls, and then switch to your Bazookas and fire southwards. Switch your
weapons to the Water Pistol and Pandora&apos;s Boxes. When ready, march south,
through the hole you made in the hedge and east to the Cheerleader (2); you
should hopefully not see any Zombies get anywhere near the Cheerleader if you
are quick, but if any do, then you ought to know how to deal with it by now.

13. Head northwest back through the hole in the hedge, and then northeast over
to a hedge block. Blast down the front with a Bazooka shell, and inside you&apos;ll
find... Bazookas. Well, you&apos;re ahead in shells overall, and that&apos;s the main
thing. Return to where the Cheerleader (2) was by heading southwest and through
the hedge, and then go south through some trees, past one row of graves and
then east out of the graveyard area. Carry on heading east and you will
eventually come to one end of the channel you were swimming in earlier. South
of the channel is the last Victim, a Teacher (10). Collect her and then exit.

PICKUPS:

14. From the Teacher (10), dive into the channel to the north, and swim across
to the other side (ignoring the little peninsula to the northwest). Once at the
other bank, head northeast around the hedge to the north, then head north
alongside it and go around the north end into a narrow alleyway by the side of
a small hut. At the southwest extremity of the alleyway is a Weedkiller pickup
- perfect after all that weed clearance you were doing earlier. Now, return to
the Exit Door. Head northeast, around the north end of the hedge that forms the
alleyway, and south and into the water. Swim around the little island with the
toxic waste barrels on it and jump out at the other side. The Exit Door is
here, if you had ten Victims (well, I guess there&apos;s an outside chance that it
isn&apos;t here, then...).

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

32) GET READY FOR BIG TERROR: LEVEL 32: GIANT ANT FARM srch332

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10&quot;Big Terror&quot;? Not really... you won&apos;t have many difficulties here, although the
introduction of Red Ants, which are your equal in terms of speed, could come as
a shock. But, isn&apos;t it refreshing to see a level with a walkthrough of only six
paragraphs, after all the huge ones I&apos;ve had to write recently?

NOTE: Though you must pick up Skeleton Keys, don&apos;t worry about the Ants
dragging them away and making the game forget them, thus trapping you in the
level. The game will always remember where the Skeleton Keys (and regular Keys)
are, though they won&apos;t return to their original locations...

NEW MONSTER: Red Ant

MONSTER LIST: Ants (intensity: high, location: patchy)
 Red Ants (intensity: ranges from medium to high, location: behind
 the Skull Doors, plus one other place)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Extermination Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Bubble Gunning the regular Ants in the main
area, around the road.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Switch to the Martian Bubble Gun, if you hadn&apos;t already. Head northwest and
collect a Teacher (7), then enter the door to her northeast. Pick up a Mystery
Potion and a Key, and then leave quickly. Head southeast to get a Cheerleader
(8) and another Key. Exit the house using the door to your southwest. Once out,
take a couple of steps west to avoid the big trench through the middle of the
road.

2. Now, head south. Once you pass the dashed white lines in the middle of the
road, hold your finger on the Y button so as to fire constantly; the
probability is that an Ant will climb out of the trench at the end and go for
the Explorer (9). Your Bubble Gun will kill it, keeping the Explorer safe.
Speaking of Explorers, collect him, then go back north up to the house.
Re-enter it through the southern exit, then head north and a little east over
to the exit in the north side.

3. Once out, head north a little, around the protruding room, and west. When
you reach the rock wall, head south, and you will find a Baby (3) standing near
some cacti. Head north, east for a while and then south when you come to the
eastern rock wall. Once you come to the main road (the road with the dashed
white lines in the middle), follow it east. You will come to a pair of Soldiers
(4 and further on, 10) with a pair of Bazooka pickups. Get all four of them,
and then head south through a gap in the cacti and further south until you come
to a Key at the southern end of the level. Hug the pit to the south and head
east - you will come to a Baby (6).

4. Continue east over to the pit that is north of a large rock. Stay on the
east while walking north past the cacti. Staying north of the row of cacti,
walk west to find a Skeleton Key. Now head north and a little east, being
careful of the Red Ants that occasionally spawn from out of the pit here. Walk
into the road, and then head west along the very middle to find Bazookas next
to another big trench. Go northeast from there and into a little hut to find a
second Skeleton Key. Exit the hut and go south. When you come to the rock wall,
head southeast over to the trench on the eastern side of the level. Hug the
trench and walk south past the cacti, then go over to the southern trench and
head west until you come to another large rock wall.

5. Take these directions to reach the eighth Victim: north, west, southwest,
north into the tunnel, west, south, west, north through the Skull Door, and
over to the Explorer (2). Now take these directions to your ninth Victim:
south, east, north, east, south, northeast, east, north past a pit, through a
gap in the cacti, over the road and into a tunnel, west at the Skull Door,
north through the break in the rock wall, northwest past a pit, east and north.
Once you have collected the Tourists (5), you will see that they were standing
in front of the level&apos;s third and final Skeleton Key; you probably didn&apos;t walk
over that yet, so be sure to collect it as well.

6. Now head south, west, and once past the pit, southeast and into a tunnel in
the rock. Go over to the east end of this tunnel, and open the Skull Door.
Continue north as far as you can, then head east. When you see a Key to the
southeast, go and get it. Go south and east around the pit, then all the way
north to find a First Aid Kit. When you have that, walk south all the way to
the rock wall, then head east and north into the tunnel. Open the Skull Door
and go through to find an Explorer (A). Head south out of the restricted tunnel
to make the Exit Door appear, and use it to good effect.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

33) LEVEL 33: FISH AND CRYPTS srch333

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

Some of the Victims in this level will fall foul of the Mummies and Squidmen if
you&apos;re lax in protecting them. You will need to be careful in getting to them
quickly - but of course, you&apos;re used to that state of affairs by this stage. By
the way, starting from this level using a password and managing to finish level
36 takes a lot of skill - you&apos;ll need to do very well on the next five levels
(not in terms of Victims so much as items and preserved health) to stand a
chance against the boss. Unconfident players should begin at the more forgiving
level 29 - or even earlier, as level 29 presents difficulties of its own - in
order to have a chance to stock up on more weapons and items on the approach.

NOTE: You can access a Bonus Level from here, but you might decide that it&apos;s
best not to visit in some circumstances. Consider the facts... The
lower-numbered Victims in the Bonus Level are mostly easy to collect, but the
higher-numbered ones are considerably more taxing. You can pick up five
Pandora&apos;s Boxes, a Monster Potion, a First Aid Kit and an Extra Life (though
you need Bazookas to access these last two). You might lose one or two of those
Pandora&apos;s Boxes trying to save the higher-numbered Victims (and of course, you
might lose one or two of those Victims). On the whole, I&apos;d say that it&apos;s worth
it - especially if you&apos;ve less than, say, seven Victims.

NEW HAZARD: Flame traps. These are flamethrowers mounted on the floor so that
they fire straight up (yowza!). Time your walk so that you pass over when they
are not firing.

MONSTER LIST: Mummies (intensity: ranges from very low to high, location:
 patchy)
 Squidmen (intensity: ranges from low to high, location: patchy -
 wherever there is water)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from very low to
 low, location: three places)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two lots of Ancient Artefacts
 Two Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 Bonus Level Pickup

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Fish Fry Bonus - 1000 points
 Secret Bonus - 2000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Go to the northwest corner of the level,
where the Bonus Level Pickup was, and fry up some fishes.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Collect the Soda Cans and Water Pistol by which you start, and then head
west into the pyramid. At the fork, go south. You come to a couple of
collapsing roof gates; to their northwest is a Sandbank. Open the Sandbank to
reveal a dark entrance; all that&apos;s inside, though, is an Ancient Artefacts
pickup. Get it and exit, heading southeast through one of the gates. Go east
over to the water, jump in and swim over to the other side, where you can find
an Explorer (A).

2. Jump back in and swim over to the west side again, then continue west into a
passage. At the end of it are two pairs of collapsing roof gates to the north.
Walk north through one pair and then head west to get the Explorer (7) in a
little chamber which also features a Pandora&apos;s Box and a Sandbank on the north
wall. Pulling down the Sandbank reveals a tunnel heading north. Go through and
you will come out near two more Sandbanks, to the west. Ignore them for now; go
south along the corridor to their southwest and you will arrive at the edge of
another little pool. There is an Explorer (8) standing here, so get him nice
and quick in case a Squidman appears and jumps out (it does sometimes happen).

3. Head north again and check the two Sandbanks you ignored earlier. Behind the
eastern one is another tunnel heading north. Go through and at the end, head
northwest for two Pots. Go northeast from there and open another Sandbank, head
north into a third tunnel and at the end, you&apos;ll find another lot of Ancient
Artefacts. Go back south through the tunnel and once out the other end, head
northwest. You come to another Sandbank on the north wall. When you pull it
down you find yet another passage north, so take it. March straight out of the
tunnel at the other end and go northwest to get an Explorer (2) before the
Squidmen do. East of his location is a Pandora&apos;s Box.

4. If you fancy subjecting yourself to a rather difficult Bonus Level - see the
note in the level summary section above - then jump in the water and swim over
to the east to get a Bonus Level Pickup. Once you&apos;re finished in here, head
south back through the secret passage (look for the orange part of the southern
wall to find it) to the room with the pots. Once in this room, head out the
southeast corner, east a little, and then northeast through three collapsing
roof gates for an Explorer (5).

5. Now, walk over to the east - don&apos;t go any further north if you have more
than eight Victims! - and stand by the wall. Kill any Mummies that approach and
then switch weapons to the Pandora&apos;s Boxes. Look north - there is a long row of
collapsing roof gates there. Read to the end of paragraph 6 in advance, so that
you know exactly what to do.

6. Walk north towards the collapsing roof gates, east a little, through the
third gate along, and then north up the tunnel that is northeast of that gate.
At the end of the tunnel is an Explorer (9), and near to him on the wall is a
sarcophagus that may spawn a Mummy, which would promptly go after him, and kill
him quite quickly. If you see a Mummy near the Explorer (9) as you approach
(and there&apos;s a high probability that you will), use your Pandora&apos;s Box to kill
it straight away. No other method of saving this Explorer will work as
effectively.

7. North of that Explorer (9) is a Bonus Points Pickup. Get it and then walk
south out of the little room. To its east are a couple of Sandbanks, and the
one to the east hides (groan) a secret passage. Walk up there, save another
hidden Explorer (4) and exit south again. Continue south through an
already-ruined collapsing roof gate and head east at the first opportunity.
Head north through either of the next pair of gates you find, and east into a
little chamber that features a Pot - a chamber Pot, if you will, - an Explorer
(3), and a Sandbank on the north wall. Head back to the southwest corner to
exit. Head south through two collapsing roof gates, then east, and south away
from the sarcophagi at double-quick speed.

8. You come to a pool of water. Head southwest from there until you come to a
Sandbank to the north; search it, but don&apos;t enter the tunnel. Just continue
west past a couple of sarcophagi, and a collapsing roof gate. When you reach
the second gate to your north, head southwest to find a Key beside another pool
of water. Now head northeast back to the gate, go through, and at the following
turnings, go east, then north to find a Pot. From that, go north to the
sarcophagi at the end of the corridor, west, and north through two collapsing
roof gates (spaced a little apart).

9. Head northwest once through the second one, but pause before passing over
the little holes in the floor. Make sure to time it so as to walk past when
they are not firing. Past them, carry on north and pick up an Explorer (6) in a
corner. Head east from him, along a corridor, and don&apos;t stop until you&apos;ve saved
the last Explorer (10), standing by the poolside at the other end. To make the
Exit Door appear, by the way, you do need to give it space - go west and off
that sliver of land, and the Door will appear. Before exiting, read the short
preamble to the Bonus Level, if you decided to go there.

33-B) BONUS LEVEL: CURSE OF THE PHARAOHS srch3b33

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10 to 5/10

Mummies spawn rather easily near to the high-numbered Explorers, and as a
consequence if you&apos;re doing well in terms of Victims, you might, well, lose a
couple. For those with less than about six Victims, this level is a cinch.

MONSTER LIST: Mummies (intensity: ranges from low to high, location: patchy)

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Five Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 First Aid Kit
 Monster Potion
 Extra Life

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Beating up the Mummies... anywhere, really.
They give terribly few points, given the amount of effort you have to put in,
anyway. Why even bother?

-----

PREAMBLE:

As soon as you start, a Mummy will spawn to the north. Begin by walking
directly east and saving an Explorer (4), and then shoot the Mummy dead.

WALKTHROUGH:

1. From that first Explorer (4), head west and save another one (A) who&apos;s safe
in a corner. Now head east, and north into a narrow passage in the rock. At the
other end of it, go east sharpish, then south. You emerge by an Explorer (2)
and three Bonus Point Pickups. Head south, skirting the wall, until you come to
a giant cobweb to the south. Ignore it for now. Instead head east, picking up a
Pandora&apos;s Box as you go, but not stopping, and you&apos;ll find an Explorer (3)
standing by a First Aid Kit. Head northwest from him to find a fifth Explorer
(8) standing in front of a big rock.

2. Move west around the rock and head south over to the giant cobweb. If you
have Bazookas, then you can get through to a Monster Potion; if you don&apos;t then
you can&apos;t have it. From there go north and you&apos;ll come to a golden wall display
showing some kind of mystical creature. To both the east and west are exit
tunnels heading north - you want to take the western one. Head north, west and
south. At the end of the part going south, you arrive in the area where you
started. Head northwest through here. You&apos;ll come to another passage heading
north - take it.

3. You&apos;ll find an Explorer (5) in the middle of the passage, where it swerves
to the east slightly. Switch to the Fire Extinguisher (if you have it) and then
walk north, staying against the eastern edge of the passageway. Once you pass
the Pandora&apos;s Box to the east, in another passage, start spraying the Fire
Extinguisher ahead of you as you go. You will come to the end of the passage
and find an Explorer (6) just to the east. You may also find that a Mummy has
been frozen as it attempts to reach that Explorer - neat, yes? If there was no
Mummy after all, you&apos;ve lost nothing but a little Fire Extinguisher ammo.

4. Head south down the little passageway that&apos;s to the east of the one you came
in by. You&apos;ll find an Explorer (9) there, with the Pandora&apos;s Box you observed
earlier. Head north out of there, and then west over to where you&apos;ll find a
Bonus Points Pickup. To the south of this is a giant cobweb, through which is
an Extra Life. Switch to your Ancient Artefacts and Pandora&apos;s Boxes. You should
read paragraphs 5 and 6 in full, in order to be prepared.

5. Go east and enter a hallway, lined to the north with pictures of winged dogs
or some such (stay up close to the northern side, as it will allow you to see
what is going on better). When you near the eastern end of the passage, you may
find that there is a Mummy approaching you; if there is, switch on the Ancient
Artefacts for a moment in order to pass it without harm. Once you have reached
the chamber at the far end of the hallway, you will see that there is an
Explorer (10) in the northwest corner (pay attention to the northern edge of
the screen). He may be under threat from a Mummy; if so, use a Pandora&apos;s Box to
neutralise the threat.

6. Now continue across to the southeast corner of the chamber, and collect a
different Explorer (7). Head northwest from him directly over to where Explorer
#10 is, and save him. He&apos;s standing on a Pandora&apos;s Box - I&apos;m fairly sure that
it&apos;s impossible to collect him without collecting it as well, but do make sure
you get it. The Exit Door will now appear, but before making use of it, head
over to the northeast corner of the room to collect two Pandora&apos;s Boxes and two
Bonus Points Pickups, and then over to the southwest corner for another Bonus
Point Pickup. On the next level, you should pause the game as soon as you start
while you determine which of the two walkthroughs you should follow.

34) LEVEL 34: I WAS A MANIAC LUMBERJACK srch334

(U.S.&quot;LEVEL 34: I WAS A CHAINSAW MANIAC&quot;)

-----

DIFFICULTY: 2/10 to 5/10

Depending on how well equipped you are, this could be a simple clean-up
operation or a mad rush to escape as quickly as possible. Those who started on
level 33 will have it hardest, unsurprisingly. I&apos;ve written two walkthroughs:
use the first one if you are well enough equipped to hammer all of the
Lumberjacks as you go through; or use the second one if you&apos;re not so well
equipped, and the Lumberjacks are more likely to be hammering you.

MONSTER LIST: Lumberjacks (seven)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - locked inside a cell, on the eastern side of the level.
 You&apos;ll need a Skeleton Key to get in to her.
 2) Baby - locked inside a cell, roughly in the centre of the level. You&apos;ll
 need a Skeleton Key to get in to him.
 3) Teacher - in a little storeroom to the east of one of the Skeleton Keys, on
 the western side of the level.
 4) Tourists - on the east side of the level, in a large, nearly empty room.
 5) Explorer - west of the locked-up Baby, in a dead end.
 6) Baby - In a dead-end passage in the northwest corner of the level. Near a
 Lumberjack - you&apos;ll need to be careful.
 7) Soldier - Southwest of where you start, in amongst the boxes.
 8) Soldier - On the western side of the level and slightly south, in a little
 clearing of his own in the middle of the boxes. You can get in with the
 Bazookas (or the Lumberjacks), or by going through a couple of doors.
 9) Soldier - South of where you start, past a few rows of boxes, also in a
 clearing (but accessible without the use of Keys). Has Bazookas.
10) Soldier - In the southeast corner of the level. Has Bazookas.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two Bazooka pickups
 Two Decoy Clowns pickups
 Two Skeleton Keys (of which you will use both, or just one
 if you have only one Victim)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 No Bazooka Fired Bonus - 1000 points
 Massive Destruction - 2000 points
 Axeman Begone Bonus - 5000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: You can&apos;t obtain limitless points on this
level - once all the Lumberjacks are dead, they&apos;re all dead. Go for the
bonuses, though, because some of them pay out a lot of points.

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You&apos;ve been playing for a while and can take on the Lumberjacks):

1. You start with two Lumberjacks on the other side of a row of boxes, so let
them come to you and then kill them. (Ancient Artefacts are always good, or you
could consider freezing them with the Fire Extinguisher and then using
Weedkiller.) Walk north onto a conveyor belt and then east along it to the
eastern side of the level. Head through the hole in the wall to your south,
then continue along the passage west and south. You emerge in a small area that
holds a Key and a Skeleton Key. On the wall to the north is a crack, so blow it
open and head through. Further north in this room are Tourists (4). Get them
and then exit the room using its southeast exit, and head down to the southeast
corner of the map. There&apos;s a Soldier (10) here with Bazookas.

2. Hop onto the conveyor belt and walk against it all the way over to its
western end. A Lumberjack will come after you from the northwest, so take care
of him and then blast down the box he was standing in front of (if he didn&apos;t
already carve it up himself). Head through; you now have a choice of three
paths. Pop into a dead end to your west to get Decoy Clowns, and then take the
eastern path and head north for a Soldier (9). Get the Bazookas and then take
the middle path north to find a Soldier (7) to your northwest. Fire two Bazooka
shells west into the broken boxes here; they&apos;ll both break, one after the
other.

3. Go through the hole made by your first Bazooka shell, then take a quick
detour north up the aisle for the Key at the end. Return to the gaps you made
in the box wall and walk through the second one. Once you&apos;re in the middle of
the next wide area, a Lumberjack will come crashing through more boxes to the
west. Give him what for and then head through the hole he made, and south. Go
around the bends and you will come to a weak box in the western barrier, which
when blown up allows you through to another Soldier (8). Having saved him, go
back up north, past the box broken by the Lumberjack; you&apos;ll find a small room
behind a door, with a second Skeleton Key in it. Blast the wall behind it and
step through. Head east in the next corridor and go south through the next door
to find a Teacher (3).

4. Fire a single Bazooka shell at the wall north of the doorway into the
Teacher&apos;s (3) room. Step through the hole into the corridor beyond and proceed
east. A Lumberjack will break through from the north and attack (if he doesn&apos;t,
just wait and he will eventually). Kill him and head north through the damaged
wall. At the western end of the passage he was in is a Key. If you&apos;ve no
entrance to the next corridor to the north yet, stand south of the cracked wall
just east of the Key&apos;s position and fire a Bazooka shell north. Head north, and
then east along the corridor, and open the door to your north. Once through,
head through the Skull Door further north to free a Baby (2).

5. Return southwest through those two now-open doors. Continue west along the
corridor until you come to another open door to the north; fire a total of
three Bazooka shells north through it at the cracked box directly in front of
it. Don&apos;t switch weapons away from the Bazooka - stride north through the
wreckage of three boxes and you&apos;ll encounter a Lumberjack, with a precious Baby
(6) standing vulnerable to his northwest. Give him a rocket so that he falls to
the floor, and then nip over and get the Baby (6). You may now finish the
Lumberjack off at your leisure.

6. Go out of the Baby&apos;s (6) cul-de-sac into the open area, then take the
southwest route out. You come to a wall to your west; walk around it to the
north and continue south. You&apos;ll find a Key by the wall on the western edge of
the level. Return north, around the boxes, south and then go east until you see
a conveyor belt to your south and machinery to your east. Continue northeast
and follow another conveyor belt east. Where it ends, head south and then west
over to a little storeroom which holds more Decoy Clowns.

7. Go south out of that room and east around the edge of the Cheerleader&apos;s (A)
cell. The final Lumberjack will come after you, so cut him down and then go in
through the Skull Door to rescue the lady. Head out, and north around the east
side of the cell. You will see a conveyor belt to the west; step on and walk
against it until you can step off to the north. Collect the Key and then get
back on and go all the way to the western end of the belt. Here, you can head
south to find an Explorer (5), after which the Exit Door will appear.

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You started on level 33):

1. This walkthrough will tell you how to get through without fighting the
Lumberjacks - because realistically, you can&apos;t be expected to do very well if
you started on level 33. If you&apos;re better equipped, then you can use the
alternative walkthrough above, which involves killing all of the Lumberjacks.
There are a couple of pickups of five Bazookas on this level, but you
definitely ought to save your heavy weaponry for level 36, so it&apos;s not a
priority - you&apos;ll get to them when it&apos;s convenient.

2. The only other adequate weapons you will have are a couple of pickups&apos; worth
of Ancient Artefacts, and some Soda Cans. That&apos;s not much good against seven
Lumberjacks considering that you need to save your ammo for the tough levels
you&apos;re approaching, so I&apos;ll provide you with a walkthrough that involves you
running like the wind (and hopefully not losing too much health). Pause
regularly and don&apos;t dither.

3. As you begin, there are a couple of Lumberjacks to your southeast standing
past a line of boxes. If you remain still, then they&apos;ll head towards you
straight away and come through the boxes. Don&apos;t do that - instead head
north-east and east along the conveyor belt. Where it ends you can head south,
west and south again into a long passage. At the end of this you come out into
a small bay that holds a Key and a Skeleton Key. Head north again, east and
north past the end of the conveyor belt.

4. You arrive in another large factory-floor area where there&apos;s a Lumberjack
waiting for you, west past more boxes (those other two shouldn&apos;t be following
you unless you&apos;ve been either slow or unlucky). Wait and see what he does
(you&apos;ll ideally have at least some idea of how Lumberjacks behave when they&apos;re
behind walls). You might choose to get him to demolish both sections of box, or
you might head round to the north; anyway, once on the other side of the boxes,
walk northwest and in through the Skull Door. There&apos;s a Cheerleader there (A).

5. Hopefully the Lumberjack won&apos;t be coming in through the door, but will have
gotten stuck outside. Wait for him to start wandering, then split; go south out
the door, east and north around the cell, and then west onto a conveyor belt.
The belt is moving east, but just keep walking until you can step off it to the
north. There&apos;s a key over to your west. Step back on to the conveyor belt and
continue west to the end. Move south quickly to find an Explorer (5) in a dead
end, wait around just long enough for a Lumberjack to your south to take note
of your presence and start chopping through the wall, and then go north again
and east all the way over to the other end of the conveyor belt.

6. From there go north and, if you want, into a little storeroom for Decoy
Clowns. Either way head around to the east and north to the end of another
conveyor belt going in the wrong direction. You only have to push against a
couple of metres of it, though; step off to the south when you can and continue
west. You&apos;ll next be approaching a Baby (6) who is near a Lumberjack. The
Lumberjack&apos;s position is not predictable at this point, though, so you&apos;ll have
to be wary. You should have at least two Pandora&apos;s Boxes, and just one will
usually cause the Lumberjack to fall over - so, use one to delay him if you
must.

7. Turn on your Victim Radar. Once you reach the blue soda vending machine
that&apos;s on the northern wall, the Baby (6) will appear on it to the west. Head
southwest from there, west and then northwest and the Baby (6) should come into
view. Grab him and then evade the Lumberjack as appropriate; you&apos;re aiming to
reach the northwest corner of the level, and head south from there. Along the
wall as you go south from that corner is a Key. Further south of there is an
open door; go through and head to the southeast corner of the next room.
There&apos;s a closed door here, leading into a passageway; head east, and then
south into a little storeroom for a Teacher (3).

8. A Lumberjack to your southwest will have taken note of your presence, and
will start walking towards you, with the intention of breaking in and chopping
you up. This is a good thing for you - no, seriously, you want him to break
down some walls and doors at this point. Firstly, though, nip past him and into
the even littler storeroom to the Teacher&apos;s (3) west for a Skeleton Key.

9. From the Skeleton Key, head south (and east when you&apos;re obstructed by boxes)
until you see the Explorer to your southwest. The Lumberjack should be
following you. Continue southeast into a dead end, and press west into the side
of the corridor. The Lumberjack will follow you in, and once in, if you&apos;ve done
it right, he should pretty quickly get rid of all three weak boxes on the sides
of this corridor, including the one to the west. This allows you to get to the
Explorer (6) - rush in quickly and grab him! Exit the little clearing the way
you came in - try not to get too badly cut in the process...

10. The Lumberjack should have destroyed the box to the east of the corridor -
if he didn&apos;t, you&apos;ll have to find your way around to the north. Assuming
everything&apos;s going well, go east, past protruding boxes, north, west and north.
You&apos;ll now see a Soldier (7) past some boxes to the east. If any Lumberjacks
are chasing you then it might be wise to try and get them to break through, so
you can be sure of getting to him first. If you don&apos;t think he&apos;s at risk, carry
on north. There&apos;s a Key to your west, in a little alcove. Go northeast, around
some boxes, and southeast until you come out into the clearing where the
Soldier (7) stands (or stood).

11. Carry on southeast; you&apos;ll see Decoy Clowns to the west and a Soldier (9)
standing with Bazookas to the east. Go quickly - the Soldier may be at risk,
even if you can&apos;t see any Lumberjacks around him. Go around the row of boxes to
the south and north to collect him. You can now get the Bazookas, and the Decoy
Clowns - head southwest until you come to a corner, and then north.

12. From the Decoy Clowns, head southeast until you pass through a collapsing
roof gate. (Ignore any smashed-up boxes - consider them as obstacles still.)
Once through the gate, head east along to the end of the conveyor belt, and
then save an Explorer (10) and pick up Bazookas. Go north into the long
passage, and when it opens into a long room, go west around the boxes and
collect Tourists (4). Now that you have Bazookas, you can blast down the weak
wall to the northwest.

13. Go through that wall you just demolished, and northeast through another
hole in the wall. Walk west, against the conveyor belt, and step off to the
south at the earliest opportunity. Carry on west until you see a collapsing
roof gate to the north; walk through across the conveyor belt, and then head
west to find a Key at the end of the passageway. One of the wall sections to
the north ought to have been demolished, so go through, and then head through a
regular door to the northeast. You&apos;ll arrive outside a Skull Door; walk through
to find a Baby (2). Exit before the roaming Lumberjacks find you (or indeed,
before the chasing ones kill you).

35) LEVEL 35: BOARDWALK OF TERRORS srch335

-----

DIFFICULTY: 5/10

It&apos;s a small-town dock that&apos;s been invaded by the Squidmen (prone as ever to
jumping in and out of the water almost at random, and appearing right by
Swimming Pool Guys and killing them instantly). For the last few Victims,
you&apos;ll benefit from the use of a Ghost Potion. Fear not if you haven&apos;t got any
- I have, once again, provided an alternative walkthrough for those lacking in
the items department.

MONSTER LIST: Squidmen (location: everywhere except the dry land to the west,
 intensity: ranges from low to high)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Tourists - On the eastern end of a length of pier, which stretches out from
 the northern part of the dry land on the western side of the level.
 2) Baby - On the very end of a pier in the southeast corner of the level.
 3) Swimming Pool Guy - at the end of a long row of boats, in the northeast
 corner of the level.
 4) Tourists - On a sandy island in the north of the map.
 5) Swimming Pool Guy - Roughly in the middle of the level, in water enclosed
 by sections of pier, and a lot of boats. There&apos;s also a hut on a nearby
 pier section.
 6) Tourists - In the exact same place as Tourists #A (in such a way that it
 looks like there&apos;s only one lot of them there), so that if they&apos;re both
 there you pick them up at the same time.
 7) Teacher - Standing on a rowboat on the south side of the level, and
 slightly to the east.
 8) Baby - In the southwest corner of the level, at the end of a jetty sticking
 out from a little sandy island.
 9) Trampoline Girl - Roughly in the middle of the level, near a hut on the
 pier. The trampoline is stretched over a boat and supported by the pier&apos;s
 mooring posts.
10) Swimming Pool Guy - Near the little hut at the end of the pier, at the
 eastern edge of the map.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Fish Fry Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Anywhere away from the west side of the
level, as the Squidmen spawn rapidly in places. As I&apos;ve remarked before,
though, fighting Squidmen doesn&apos;t really pay, so only do it if you&apos;re desperate
for an Extra Bonus Victim.

-----

WALKTHROUGH, PART ONE:

1. Walk south into the house and over to the far end. Enter the little store
cupboard for a First Aid Kit. If you haven&apos;t got enough Keys, just Bazooka it
down. Get out of there and back up to the road where you started. Follow the
road east and then south, and at the end you will see a wooden platform
connecting the road to a little sandy island to the east. Go east without
stopping, across the island, and over to the Baby (8) on the jetty on the other
side. Return west to get back to the road, and then walk north again, until you
come off the road and reach a door. Enter and head over to the west side for a
Bonus Points Pickup.

2. Go southeast and out of there, and head under the canopy over to the water
to the northeast of the exit. Jump in and swim over to the pier to the north.
Once on the pier, go west, into the house by another entrance, and go northwest
over to the larger carpet, where you can get a Key. Return southeast and then
exit the building. Go east along the long wooden platform quickly and you will
find Tourists (A and 6) standing near a hut. That&apos;s right, both sets of
Tourists are standing on the exact same spot, so you get two Victims for the
price of one.

3. Ignore the door to the southeast - there&apos;s nothing inside. Carry on east
along the pier instead, and step onto a boat. Jump off to the south, and swim
to the next boat to the south (with the trampoline stretched across it). Jump
onto the trampoline to save the Trampoline Girl (9). Jump southeast off the
trampoline and you will land on a large platform. Turn on your Victim Radar and
continue walking east along the pier. The Radar will show a dot travelling
along the northern edge; once it is slightly past the centre, jump off to the
north and swim north. You&apos;ll come to another sandy island. Collect a Key
quickly and then stride northwest to collect Tourists (4).

4. Keep your Victim Radar on for now. Head back over to the southern side of
the island and dive into the water. Swim south and you&apos;ll get back to the last
pier you were walking along. Go west, but don&apos;t continue south when you can;
just carry on until you see another dot appear on the Radar. This the point in
the level at which you will benefit from having a Ghost Potion to use (assuming
you have more than four Victims). I&apos;d advise different approaches for the&quot;haves&quot;and the&quot;have-nots&quot;, so choose the appropriate second half of the
walkthrough, below.

-----

WALKTHROUGH, PART TWO (You have a Ghost Potion):

5. As with the other walkthrough, I&apos;d suggest waiting a few seconds for
Squidmen to arrive where you are, to the east of the Swimming Pool Guy (5).
This could give you a little extra edge. Once there are three or four jumping
around, head slowly west and then south onto a protruding section of platform -
allowing the Squidmen to follow you - and then use the Potion. To your west is
a line of boats. Walk along there and off the end (no time-wasting diving, you
see!) and the Swimming Pool Guy (5) should be yours much more easily. From him,
head south, around any obstructing mooring posts, and you&apos;ll find a Key on an
unconnected section of pier.

6. Once you have the Key, keep south of the trampoline-boat and head due east,
across the water. You&apos;ll eventually come to a boat that has a Teacher (7)
standing on it, teaching a school of fishes (aha!). Get her ASAP and continue
east. Step onto the pier to the north and carry on over to the end. You&apos;ll find
a Baby (2) there. At this point, walk out onto the water to the east.

7. Do not step onto any land, pier sections, or boats until you have saved the
remaining two Swimming Pool Guys (10 and 3) - you&apos;ll remain as a ghost while
you&apos;re on water, even if the Ghost Potion has timed out, and this helps you in
collecting these final Victims. Walk north across the water and you&apos;ll come to
a boat obstructing you to the north. Walk around it to the east - not across it
- and then walk northwest over to the Swimming Pool Guy (10) who is floating
just off the pier. From him, continue walking north to get to another Swimming
Pool Guy (3).

PICKUPS (Only applies if you used the Ghost Potion part of the walkthrough):

8. You have all the Victims, but there are a few things left for you to pick
up. (Don&apos;t worry about the Exit Door - it will appear as soon as you step onto
land.) Head south around the line of boats to your west, and then go west until
you see the sandy island, where the Tourists (4) were earlier, to the west.
Head south and once past the reeds, west again. You will eventually come to a
trampoline-boat to the west; walk south onto the platform. You should
immediately revert to non-ghost form, and the Exit Door should appear.

9. Head west over to the edge of the water, and dive in. Swim over to the boat
with the Key on it, and pick it up. Dive in again to the west and swim over to
the next section of platform. To the north of your point of egress is a door
leading into a room. The room contains Bonus Points Pickups, so get them and
then leave the way you came in. Head south from the door and then jump into the
water to the east again, and swim over to the other side (skirting around the
boat this time, obviously). Jump out onto the platform to the east; the exit
door will be nearby, probably a little east of here, if you left the water
where I advised you to. Note that you should be prepared for the next level,
but only if you have ten Victims (or will do because you earned an Extra Bonus
Victim). Read the preamble below.

-----

WALKTHROUGH, PART TWO (You have no Ghost Potion):

5. The next Victim you&apos;ve to collect is a Swimming Pool Guy (5), who is smack
in the middle of a spawning ground for Squidmen. I&apos;ll direct you through the
safest approach route, but your chances of successfully collecting him are
dicey. However, you can make sure the probability of your succeeding is as high
as possible by gaining an entourage of Squidmen - this makes it less likely for
one to spawn near the Swimming Pool Guy (5), which gives you better odds. If
you have it, switch to your Flamethrower; if you don&apos;t, the Soda Cans will have
to do. While you were switching weapons, you should have had a number of
Squidmen (four or five, ideally) spawn around you. Now continue west reasonably
slowly until you have an extension of a large wooden platform to your south.
Walk onto that with your party of Squidmen following you along. Read paragraph
6 before continuing.

6. There is a line of boats to your west. Abandon the Squidmen you were
bringing with you and move quickly across the boats. Just past the last one, in
the water, is the Swimming Pool Guy. As you are just about to enter the water,
let out a short blast with your Flamethrower, or throw a Soda Can, in order to
kill any Squidman who chooses that moment to appear. You should have entered
just by the Swimming Pool Guy (5), so nab him before a jammy Squidman appears
and nullifies your efforts.

7. To your northwest is a rowboat with a Key lying on the deck; grab it and
then jump off to the west and swim over to the large platform. To the north on
here is a locked door leading into a hut that has Bonus Points Pickups inside.
Get them and then exit the way you entered. Head south and you will come to a
pair of trampoline-boats, side by side. Jump onto the western one, and jump off
it southeast. Head over to the southeast end of the platform you land on for a
Key.

8. Now jump onto the trampoline to your northeast, and jump off northeast as
well. You&apos;ll land in the water just next to a wooden platform. Swim due east
for a while and you&apos;ll jump out onto a pier leading south. Walk south to the
end, and then straight out onto the boats to the east; to the southeast is a
Teacher (7) on the southernmost boat. Get her quickly - and don&apos;t try to walk
across water. Get onto her boat by walking onto it from the middle boat, which
touches it, to prevent&quot;invisible walls&quot;from giving you grief.

9. Return to the line of boats to the north and then walk east non-stop until
you come to the far end of the pier. There&apos;s a Baby (2) here. Jump off east
into the water, then swim north. You&apos;ll come to a boat, which obstructs your
progress. Head east and swim past it, then swim northwest to find a Swimming
Pool Guy (10). From him, carry on north, and you&apos;ll come to another Swimming
Pool Guy (3) - who&apos;s also the final victim. You could jump off onto the line of
boats to the west, but you could find it a tad difficult to get the Exit Door
to appear. As an alternative, go to the southwest and you&apos;ll find a (reasonably
wide) section of pier. You&apos;ve already collected all of the pickups, so read the
preamble to level 36 below, and then leave.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

36) PREPARE FOR THE TERROR: LEVEL 36: MONSTER PHOBIA srch336

-----

DIFFICULTY: 6/10 to 9/10

Most of the Victims are challenging to collect, and you&apos;ll have to go through
carefully in order to reduce the probability of their copping it. And then, at
the end, there is of course the boss, Dr. Bug. In the end, how hard he is will
depend on how well equipped you are. If you started on level 33 then this will
be a big challenge; if you played from the beginning of the game then it won&apos;t
be nearly so hard. Because this boss is such a big game event, I&apos;ve dealt with
him in a separate section - look below this level&apos;s walkthrough.

- NOTE: On rare occasions, the Cheerleader (A) whom you&apos;re fighting to save is
not found in her proper position after the battle. You can tell whether she is
present at any moment by checking whether a dot appears on your Victim Radar,
showing her to the northwest of the boss arena - but her being there at the
start of the fight may not guarantee her still being there at the end. If this
glitch does occur, you can&apos;t exit the level, meaning you&apos;ve no choice but to
start a new game.

I know it&apos;s not the sort of thing you want to find has happened, especially if
you&apos;ve played from the start of the game; but looking on the bright side, it&apos;s
only happened to me twice, and I&apos;ve played through the game enough times for
that not to be particularly significant. It&apos;s still a small worry, though, and
you should check before you get stuck into the boss (for what good it&apos;ll do).

MONSTER LIST: Evil Dolls (intensity: medium, location: patchy)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls, and spawning from the fireplace on
 the eastern side of the map, while it&apos;s lit - very low
 intensity)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: the east side of the map)
 Lumberjack (one)
 Mummies (intensity: low, location: a few places)
 Pod Plants (two)
 Spiders (intensity: low, location: patchy. Additionally, the
 Giant Spider produces regular-sized Spiders at a medium
 intensity rate, which is quite considerable when you&apos;ve got
 the larger version to worry about as well.)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 9 seconds: #10; spawning
 randomly, effectively immediately, intensity: very low,
 location: around the eastern area of the map)

BOSS: Giant Spider (Dr. Bug)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - She&apos;s held captive behind the Giant Spider&apos;s web. You have to
 kill the Giant Spider, to make the web disappear, so that you can have
 access to her. Note that on rare occasions, due to a glitch, she may not be
 found in this position - this necessitates starting a new game. See above.
 2) Soldier - Northwest of where you start, standing by two double-value
 Bazooka pickups, and between two cots, which spawn Evil Dolls.
 3) Cheerleader - South of the passageway that leads north to the boss arena;
 also south of a cot which spits out Evil Dolls.
 4) Baby - Just north of the cobweb-filled area in the southeast corner of the
 map. In a room with a sarcophagus that occasionally spawns Mummies.
 5) Teacher - In the room with the lit fireplace (where Fire Babies spawn),
 southwest of your start position.
 6) Dog - In front of the unlit fireplace on the eastern side of the level.
 7) Baby - On the roof in the southeast corner of the level. Access this roof
 by walking around the barrier at the eastern end of the weed-covered
 balcony on the southern edge of the level.
 8) Explorer - On the weed-covered balcony on the southern edge of the level.
 9) Baby - Southwest of the Lumberjack&apos;s starting point in the southeast
 corner of the level. Approach carefully.
10) Tourists - Northwest of where you start, with a partition wall to their
 east shielding them from the Evil Dolls.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two double-value Bazooka pickups (for a total of 20 shells)
 First Aid Kit
 Silverware

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Weed Cutting Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Probably around the fireplace, especially if
you leave it lit so you can occasionally nab a 400-point Fire Baby.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. If you have ten Victims upon starting this level, there&apos;ll be Tourists (10)
a little way to the northwest, who turn into Werewolves after just 9 seconds.
You should go there directly, yes? No. There&apos;s a Soldier (2) nearby who&apos;ll
probably get chopped up by Evil Dolls if you don&apos;t go to him first. Because of
this, you&apos;ll have to get the Tourists (10) second, which does mean moving
reasonably fast. Prepare yourself by reading through the&quot;Tourist-Werewolves&quot;section below in full.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. You start by a Key. Take it and then head northwest past a giant web and
you&apos;ll come to a Soldier (2) who needs saving from Evil Dolls. He&apos;s standing
near a couple of double-value Bazooka pickups, which between them grant you
twenty shells. (Don&apos;t use these indiscriminately while playing - you need to
fire your Bazookas quite a few times in this level to get through walls and
over to the boss.) Once you have them carry on west past a partition wall and
then northwest over to the Tourists (10).

VICTIMS:

3. Northwest is a Cupboard in a narrow alcove, and east of it, past tables, is
a Chest against the wall. From the Chest, head south to the end of the
partition wall and then southeast until you come to a door. Walk west from here
to come to another partition wall. Head south around it and go north along a
passageway and you will come to a Cupboard. Go south, east when you can, north
around the wall and east again and you&apos;ll arrive at the door you saw earlier.
Head south past the sofa and then southeast, and you&apos;ll come to a broken web.
Go south through it, pick up a Key and then return north, through the broken
web and west.

4. Near the southwest corner of the room, you will find a ruined wall to your
south. Blast it down with a Bazooka shell, head through and then go southeast
to find a little den with a Dog (6) in front of an unlit fireplace. Go back
west over to the wall you demolished and continue west into a room with a
Teacher (5) standing north of a green sofa. Get her quickly. You can put out
the fire to the north with the Fire Extinguisher if you want to avoid fighting
Fire Babies (and you probably do). To the sides of the blaze are a Cupboard and
a Chest. There are more goodies around here, but you can come back for them
later - collecting them now would put a Baby (4) at risk.

5. Switch to your Bazookas again and return to the southeast corner of the
room. On the south wall of the corridor just outside is a weak patch. Blow that
up as well. Head through and southeast to a door; go through that and then head
west into a room and over to the Baby (4). That Baby (4) has a Cupboard to his
west, and a Chest to his northeast. When you have opened them, return to the
southeast corner of the room and east over to the door you came through
earlier. Head through and northwest; once through the hole in the wall, go west
into the room with the sofa. Head north around it and over to the southwest
corner of the room.

6. You come to a couple of separate paths at right angles to each other. To
your south is a First Aid Kit; to your west is a passage with a Chest and a
Cupboard at the end. When you have both, return to the southeast corner of the
sofa room, head southeast through the damaged wall and the door, and then
continue south. You&apos;ll pass one row of giant cobwebs and come up against
another row. Head southwest to pass through two gaps, then stop and pause the
game.

7. You&apos;ll next be approaching a Baby (9) who is very near a Lumberjack&apos;s
starting point (across the room, in fact), so you should make sure you&apos;re
prepared to save the Baby and cane the Lumberjack. Switch to your Ancient
Artefacts, and read to the end of this paragraph, before starting. Head east to
the end of the aisle (between cobwebs) you are in. Now head south through the
gap that is there, and then move directly southwest through the open area,
avoiding being obstructed by the two desks and the cot, and collect the Baby
(9) who&apos;s in the southwest corner of the area. The Lumberjack will be after
your blood now, so switch on the Artefacts and waste him.

8. Return northeast into the cobweb-filled area. Past the first row, head west,
north, east, and then north at the first opportunity. You can now head west
over to a Cupboard; at the southern end of the passageway you&apos;re in is a Fire
Extinguisher. Collect it, then return north, east, south, west, south, east,
south and southwest. Switch to your Bazookas. Walk into the corridor leading
out from the room&apos;s west side. At the end, to the south, is a damaged wall -
destroy it. Now if you have Weedkiller, switch to it, head through and sweep up
the first Pod Plant there. If you don&apos;t have any then you ought to stick with
your Bazookas - stand east of the Pod Plant and blast it to death.

9. You can ignore the Explorer (8) for now - he&apos;s safe. Instead of heading
west, walk over to the eastern edge of the balcony, and north and east around
the barrier. You can now walk along the edge of the sloped roof - head
southeast and then northeast to reach a Baby (7), who&apos;s been left in a rather
questionable place, to put it mildly. There&apos;s nothing else on the roof, so head
southwest and then northwest and back onto that balcony. If you had Weedkiller,
then you should still have it equipped. Head west, cutting through the weeds,
to save the Explorer (8), and then continue southwest and you&apos;ll reach a second
Pod Plant which you should trim down.

10. If you don&apos;t have Weedkiller, on the other hand, then carefully walk onto
the slanted roof to the north of the balcony, and (still pushing north into the
roof), over to the door, in front of which is an Explorer (8). Now stride
southwest to the very southern edge of the balcony, where the weeds won&apos;t hurt
you. Move west, past the second Pod Plant, and once at the southwest corner of
the balcony, fire a Bazooka shell east at the Pod Plant to kill it.

11. Past the weeds, to the north, is a weak wall. If there&apos;s a Mummy through
there, throw a Soda Can over to kill it. Switch to your Bazookas and blow the
wall down, walk into the room, and then blast down the window in the southwest
with your Bazooka, and go through onto another section of roof. Do all this
quickly, as there may be an endangered Cheerleader to the northeast. Once on
the roof, head northwest and you&apos;ll see another window just asking to be blown
up. Fire a shell at it, then head through and east over to the area containing
the Evil Dolls&apos; cot and the Cheerleader (3), south. Collect her and then head
northeast into a little alcove formed by the walls and a giant cobweb.

12. Fire two Bazooka shells north, and then head through both cobwebs and open
a Cupboard. Return south through the northern cobweb and head west to stand
between a couple more; now fire your Bazooka north, twice. Head through the
first broken cobweb and north up the passageway, and you&apos;ll come to a
Silverware pickup in front of the second broken web.

13. North of here is Dr. Bug&apos;s boss arena. You need to fight the boss, Dr. Bug,
in order to access the final Victim, a Cheerleader (A). She&apos;s at the western
end of a corridor behind a web, in the northeast corner of the arena, which
will only break apart in response to the boss&apos; death. You can consider this
level finished, but for the boss, as there are no more pickups to collect
outside the boss arena. Read the next section of the walkthrough to learn how
the boss fights, and the strategies I recommend for beating him.

HOW TO BEGIN

Read the sections below before starting. Decide which weapons you&apos;ll start with
and switch to them; now head north to the far side of the arena, and open up
two Chests (in case there&apos;s anything of worth inside). Switch on your Victim
Radar and check that&apos;s there&apos;s a dot on it to the northwest; if there isn&apos;t,
then the Cheerleader isn&apos;t where she should be, and you&apos;ll have to start a new
game (this is very unlikely, and only happens due to a glitch). Unless you have
less than about 500 Weedkiller ammo, don&apos;t pick up the Weedkiller next to the
western Chest; it&apos;s a double pickup worth 600, and so you&apos;d only be wasting it.
By now the Giant Spider is probably fully formed and ready to fight you, so get
to work.

-----

HIS HEALTH, AND HOW TO GAUGE IT

The Giant Spider will flash whenever you do him damage. (He will also flash
when you hit him with the Fire Extinguisher or Martian Bubble Gun, even though
these don&apos;t have any effect on him.) Where he flashes depends upon how damaged
he is. Initially the two large eyes on the front, the mandibles, and the four
additional eyes on his forehead (around the green patch) will flash. However as
you deal him more damage, these four eyes fail, one by one; first the Spider&apos;s
upper left eye will fail (remember, that&apos;s the top-right one as you look at
him), then his upper right eye, then his lower left eye. With the failure of
each eye, the Spider&apos;s whole body will momentarily flash electric blue.

Once the last eye, the lower right one, has failed, the spider will flash all
over for an extended period of time (whenever you hit him, his whole body will
flash electric blue). After a while, this stops and only his two front eyes and
mandibles will be flashing - this means he&apos;s close to death, and you only need
to keep attacking until he starts blowing up. You should realise that after he
has completely perished, the Giant Spider still manages to send out a final
feeble burst of two or three normal-sized Spiders for you to deal with, which
isn&apos;t good if you&apos;re on your last legs! Don&apos;t worry about Dr. Bug, the Mad
Scientist who&apos;s left over afterwards, because he&apos;s just a normal one from now
on (i.e. he drinks his potion and them explodes).

-----

HIS MOVEMENTS AND ATTACKS

The Giant Spider is restricted to the room in which you fight him, but he can
move about rapidly within that room. This sets the pace for the whole battle -
it&apos;s frantic if you&apos;re low on supplies or health, and you&apos;ll be very low on
supplies indeed if you started on level 33. You&apos;ll need to keep track of how
many lives and how much ammo you have, and you&apos;ll need to think and act fast.
This is where the difficulty of completing this level from level 33 really
comes to a head.

It&apos;s quite hard to hit him, whatever weapons you&apos;re using - bar the Pandora&apos;s
Boxes, but those should only be a last resort in any case. He has only two
attacks, both of which are rather unpleasant (note that walking into him, or
having him run over you, will result in your taking damage as well). His first
attack is the cobweb attack: he sprays out spider silk as white missiles. If it
strikes you then it will hurt you; whether it strikes you or not, it&apos;ll produce
sticky cobwebs on the floor where it lands. You can&apos;t walk normally across
these, as they stick you to the floor and don&apos;t let you move. This applies to
all alternative forms you can take except for Mr. Hyde.

However, you can move across them by constantly moving with a fidgety motion -
changing the direction in which you attempt to move, by alternating quickly
between the two component directions of diagonal movement, to make your
character move with a juddering motion across the arena. The Weedkiller can
sweep up the sticky cobwebs - and they will contribute to, and indeed are
necessary for, the Weed Cutting Bonus. This leaves behind an area of the floor
without texture, on which the Giant Spider can&apos;t place any more webs. This
gives rise to the third of the strategies detailed below.

The Giant Spider&apos;s second attack is to spawn normal-sized Spiders. He does this
at a rate roughly equivalent to a medium intensity spawning area for Spiders,
but don&apos;t expect it to seem laid-back; those little Spiders will account for
most of the damage you take. They&apos;re nearly as difficult to hit as the Giant
Spider, and they just keep coming (and they do not, of course, slow down when
travelling across sticky cobwebs). The Decoy Clowns, though, can distract them,
which is useful.

-----

WEAPONS AND ITEMS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

[In alphabetical order]

BAZOOKA: If you have good aim, this will deal decisive damage quickly. It works
best if you are firing directly north and the Giant Spider is stationary.

DECOY CLOWNS: These work very well at distracting the normal-sized Spiders, but
they do not last for very long. Bear in mind that you can only have three
active at the same time - keep an eye on how those you have placed are doing
(that is, whether they&apos;ve burst yet). If you have any, you should make sure to
use them if you&apos;re not transformed into some alternative shape.

FLAMETHROWER: Of course, if you&apos;ve been playing since level 13 or earlier, it&apos;s
likely that you&apos;ve gotten yourself a Flamethrower. Although this boss will
drain much of your ammo for it - even a skilled player (i.e. me) loses from 100
to 150 - you can use it to get rid of the Giant Spider very quickly, even
without bothering to remove the cobwebs.

MONSTER POTION: Although you&apos;ll deal damage quite slowly as the Purple Monster,
you&apos;ll be invincible while you do it. Unfortunately, in addition to the slow
rate of attack, you just can&apos;t get to the Giant Spider very often - while
you&apos;re in the centre of the room punching on the spot, unable to move due to
the cobwebs, the Giant Spider will run rings around you and rarely come close.
But, if you use the Weedkiller to clear away the sticky cobwebs, and then use
the Monster Potion, this problem will be all but eliminated, so that the
Monster Potion becomes a much more effective weapon.

MYSTERY POTION: You&apos;ll sometimes turn into a Purple Monster, allowing you to
deal with the Giant Spider most effectively, but at other times you&apos;ll wind up
as a ghost or as Mr Hyde, unable to do anything for about 30 seconds. The
Mystery Potion can be a good timewaster, though, as you wait for the floor to
get covered in webs, ready for you to sweep them up.

PANDORA&apos;S BOXES: Only consider these as a last resort. They can be effective in
dealing damage, but you want them for later levels, to protect Victims. Unless
you only intend to reach level 37 for the sake of it, then stop, you should
keep your Pandora&apos;s Boxes if at all possible.

PLATES AND SILVERWARE: Both of these are very effective against the Giant
Spider... if you can hit with them. Unfortunately, it&apos;s difficult to do so, and
so if you use them, they&apos;re likely to mostly be wasted. As with the Pandora&apos;s
Boxes, Plates and Silverware should be a last resort, as they&apos;re more helpful
against easier-to-hit boss creatures.

WEEDKILLER: Hardly the best thing to chase after the Giant Spider with (you&apos;ll
take massive damage), but it is very useful to sweep up the sticky cobwebs that
he drops. It can also protect you from the normal-sized Spiders - though they
move so fast that it&apos;s a hit-and-miss thing.

AND THOSE YOU SHOULDN&apos;T: Water Pistol, Ancient Artefacts, Soda Cans, Tomatoes,
Ice Lollies, and American Footballs. Avoid using these like the plague. They
really are no good against the Giant Spider, and you&apos;ll get a kicking.

-----

STRATEGY ONE: Exclusive Use of One Weapon.

Just use one of the better weapons listed above to knock out the boss, without
using anything else at all. This is rather boring, and for most of the weapons
listed - for example, the Monster Potion - it isn&apos;t very efficient. (The
exceptions to this are the Bazooka and the Flamethrower.)

-----

STRATEGY TWO: Weapon Sequences.

In conjunction with the two other strategies below, use your weapons in the
following order, unless there&apos;s a compelling reason not to (for example, low
health). This order has been formulated based on how effective each weapon is,
and how much of your current (or imagined) stock you&apos;re likely to need in the
upcoming levels. Some of the bullet points might not apply to you, but the idea
is to conform to this rough plan when possible.

If you&apos;ve been playing for a while (that is, you started before level 33) then
I suggest the following weapon sequence:

- Use the Flamethrower until you have 300 ammo left.
- Use the Monster Potions until you have four of them left.
- Use the Bazookas until you have 40 shells left.
- Use the Flamethrower until you have 250 ammo left.
- Use the Monster Potions until you have two of them left.
- Use the Bazooka until you have 20 shells left.
- Use the Mystery Potions until you have four of them left.
- Use the Flamethrower until you have 200 ammo left.
- Use the Bazookas until you have ten shells left.
- Use your remaining Mystery Potions.
- Use your remaining Monster Potions.
- Use the Flamethrower until you have 100 ammo left.
- Use your remaining Plates.
- Use the Silverware until you have twenty ammo left.
- Use your remaining Flamethrower ammo.
- Use your remaining Bazookas.
- Use your remaining Pandora&apos;s Boxes.
- Use your remaining Silverware.
- Use the Water Pistol until you have 100 ammo left.
- Use your remaining Ancient Artefacts.
- Use your remaining Water Pistol ammo.
- Use your remaining Tomatoes, Ice Lollies and American Footballs.
- Use your remaining Soda Cans.
- Use your remaining Weedkiller ammo to attack the Giant Spider, and probably
 die.

If you started on level 33, then use of the following weapon sequence while
making good use of Decoy Clowns is probably your best bet:

- Use all your Pandora&apos;s boxes first.
- Then use all your Bazooka shells.
- Clear a few strips of floor in the centre of the arena with your Weedkiller.
- Then use your Ancient Artefacts.
- Use the Silverware you picked up just before entering the arena.
- Finish by using your Water Pistol.

-----

STRATEGY THREE: Wait, Sweep, and Kill.

Waste time until he&apos;s covered the floor in sticky cobwebs, and then clean them
all up and kill him without having to move at horribly slow speed. Decoy Clowns
are likely to be an integral part of this strategy, especially while you&apos;re
using your Weedkiller. After you&apos;ve finished clearing away the cobwebs, pretty
much any of the weapons listed above are good ones to use. But how should you
waste time in the first place? Just standing in a corner and shooting at the
Spiders which approach will not work, as the cobwebs will only be scattered
around the area where you&apos;re standing.

However, if you&apos;ve got a few Mystery Potions, you could wander around and
occasionally drink them and see what happens (delay a suitable amount of time
between each drink, in order to make the most of the occasional health refill
you&apos;ll receive). If you&apos;re rolling in ghost potions, you could take those and
just sit around - but I don&apos;t think you are. What is more likely is for you to
have a lot of Monster Potions, and if you do then you can take one and just
idly punch the air while waiting in the middle of the arena.

-----

STRATEGY FOUR: Snipe from an Advantageous Position.

This strategy only really applies to the Bazooka, the Silverware, the Plates
and Pandora&apos;s Boxes. You stand in a reasonably sheltered area for a time (for
example, you could move on whenever it becomes necessary to place down a new
Decoy Clown). I recommend staying around the southern edge of the arena, as
it&apos;s easiest to do damage with the Bazooka when firing from there. Feel free to
combine this strategy with strategy number three (Wait, Sweep, and Kill).

-----

AFTER HE&apos;S DEAD

It&apos;s obvious enough when you&apos;ve finished him off, as he&apos;ll light up orange and
start exploding. Once he&apos;s disappeared, a Mad Scientist will appear in his
place, and he&apos;ll drink another potion and then explode like all good Mad
Scientists do. More importantly for you, the Giant Spider sends out a few
normal-sized Spiders when he dies, which you must kill before the battle is
actually over.

Once there are no more enemies to worry about, things can slow down a bit. If
you want to get the Weed Cutting Bonus and you don&apos;t think you&apos;ve removed
enough weeds to qualify, spend a few seconds wandering up and down the room
with your Weedkiller on, in order to strip the sticky cobwebs off the floor.
Once you&apos;ve finished with the weeding, collect the Weedkiller pickup in the
northwest corner of the room (if you didn&apos;t already), and then head over to the
northeast corner. The great big cobweb that was there earlier is gone, so you
can get through to a corridor heading west.

At the western extremity of this corridor is the Cheerleader (A), still
bouncing up and down happily as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.
(If she&apos;s not there, it&apos;s because a glitch in the game has taken her away. You
will have to start a new game all over again. Curse all you like, but not at me
- it&apos;s not my fault.) Assuming she&apos;s there, collect her and then walk over to
the eastern side of the corridor and out into the boss arena again (as the Exit
Door won&apos;t appear until it&apos;s got a reasonable amount of space near you in which
to open).

37) LEVEL 37: LABYRINTH OF HORRORS srch337

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

Providing a comparatively relaxing playing experience after the hectic boss
level, this stage is easy going (even if it is a little maze-like, as the title
suggests). Although Frankenstein&apos;s Monster and a Vampire both put in an
appearance, the Vampire can be avoided for as long as matters and Frankie&apos;s not
hard to blow away. The Victims are mostly easy as well if you approach them in
the right way.

MONSTER LIST: Frankenstein&apos;s Monster (one)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Mummies (intensity: very low, location: one place)
 Pod Plants (two)
 Squidmen (intensity: very low, location: one place)
 Vampire (one)
 Werewolves (source: spawning randomly, effectively immediately,
 intensity: low, location: patchy)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from medium to
 high, location: patchy)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Baby - In the southeast corner of the map, past a bed of spikes in a small
 laboratory.
 2) Baby - Past a patch of weeds in a little yard in the middle of the level.
 3) Soldier - Standing by a Pod Plant on the eastern side of the level.
 4) Explorer - In a chamber north of the laboratory containing Frankenstein&apos;s
 Monster, southwest of where you start.
 5) Cheerleader - In a safe area on the north side of the level.
 6) Cheerleader - Near the northwest corner of the level, at the eastern end of
 a long chamber, where Zombies spawn at a high rate.
 7) Cheerleader - In the laboratory around the centre of the level, standing
 south of Frankenstein&apos;s Monster.
 8) Cheerleader - South from where you start, past a couple of strips of spikes
 and through a couple of collapsing roof gates.
 9) Baby - A little northeast of where you start, south of some strips of
 spikes.
10) Baby - In the northwest corner of the map.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Three Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 Bazookas
 First Aid Kit
 Monster Potion

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: On the southern edge of the level, or in the
northwest, slaughtering Zombies. You could find that you get Werewolves
interrupting you occasionally.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Head into the northwest corner of the chamber where you start to find
Weedkiller. Don&apos;t head south very far in this chamber, or a Vampire will
appear; you don&apos;t want to see him yet. Head east from there, past a collapsing
roof gate and some gargoyles&apos; heads to the north, and northeast once you come
to the steps. You will find a Baby (9) standing by a suit of armour. Head
northeast under an arch, then south down a passage that features a series of
arches. When you get the opportunity, head west, south through a collapsing
roof gate, and then southeast into a tunnel (just walk into the south wall of
that little dungeon where the air hole appears). You emerge by a Pod Plant, on
the other side of which is a Soldier (3). Kill the Plant and save the Soldier.

2. Go east and south across the lawn, and enter another passage at the south
end. Once you&apos;re out the other side, head southwest, under an overhead rack,
and east to save a Baby (A). If the spikes are up, you will just have to walk
over them this once, in order to get to him. Head northwest across the spikes
again (waiting patiently this time), take the west passage and when it opens up
carry on northwest into a tunnel heading north. You arrive in a tiny yard that
contains a Pod Plant; sweep it up, and clear a path through the weeds as well.
Carry on through the next tunnel into another tiny little place with more
desirable contents: a Pandora&apos;s Box, Bazookas and Bonus Points Pickups.

3. Return south through the two tunnels and head southeast until you return to
the lab with the spikes in. Walk south onto the spikes after they lower, and
then head west along the passage until you come to a room containing four
pillars, with a Pandora&apos;s Box between them. Collect the Box, then head out the
northwest corner of the room through a collapsing roof gate. There is another
one to your northeast; go through that one next and then collect the
Cheerleader (7) inside.

4. Frankenstein&apos;s Monster is standing to the north; if you have Ancient
Artefacts from a previous level then you can just head straight over and kill
him. If you haven&apos;t got any Artefacts, then switch to the Bazookas that you
picked up earlier, and walk north to stand near him so that he disconnects from
the electrodes and attacks you. Fire Bazookas north, straight into his chest -
do make sure that he&apos;s standing still for each missile, rather than just
keeping the Y button held down, in order that he takes the most possible damage
from it. Most of the time (if you do it right) it will take three shots or less
to kill him, but if he&apos;s still standing after you&apos;re down to one shell then you
can finish by using the Weedkiller on him. (You need that one shell later.)

5. Head north between the electrodes where Frankie was charging, and on the
other side, to the west, you&apos;ll find a Mystery Potion. Continue north through
one collapsing roof gate and don&apos;t go the slightest bit east unless you want
the Vampire to appear now (and you don&apos;t). Go west as far as you can instead,
and you will come to a little dead end containing a Pandora&apos;s Box. Head out of
there and south down the next passage to your east; at the end of it, where it
opens up, you will find a First Aid Kit.

6. Head southwest through a collapsing roof gate. Once past it, walk west and
then north up the hallway. Time your walk across the spikes. Once past them,
you&apos;ll go through a passage into another of those little yards; there are weeds
between you and a Baby (2) to the east. You can avoid having to clear the weeds
if you just skirt the southern wall of the yard, so use this method to get over
to the Baby (2) and back again. Go back the way you came - south through the
tunnel, then carefully across the spikes down to the end of the hallway. On the
south wall, slightly to the east, is a collapsing roof gate; walk southeast
through it, and east along the passage. Head south down the next passage to
find a Monster Potion.

7. You&apos;ll now need to go through a series of corridors to reach your next
destination. Head west, south, east, north, east and south. Continue south
through the next room you enter, minding the spikes. Go east into the lab where
the Baby (A) was, north at the big pad of spikes, northeast and then north into
a dark passage. You come into a little garden, where the first Pod Plant was
earlier. Continue north through the next tunnel and you will come to a couple
of gargoyles&apos; faces carved on the wall. To their west is a collapsing roof gate
that&apos;s already fallen in - blast it down with the Bazookas and go through.

8. Head northeast into a passageway heading north, decorated with arches. Carry
on walking north up this until you reach the northeast corner of the level,
then dive into the water to your west. Swim across to the other side and jump
out, then continue walking west to come to a Cheerleader (5). Go south through
a collapsing roof gate and then head northwest into a wide hallway, heading
west. You will come to a Baby (10) near a couple of sarcophagi standing against
the walls; collect him quickly.

9. Continue to the far west end of the hallway for Soda Cans. Now head south,
carefully timing your walk over the spikes, and you&apos;ll arrive in another hall.
Don&apos;t go east or you risk getting a Cheerleader (6) killed by Zombies; collect
the Bonus Points Pickups to your west and then switch to your Water Pistol and
Pandora&apos;s Boxes.

10. Step north or south in order to align your character&apos;s feet with the first
visible line between the paving stones on the southern side of the hall - this
is roughly on the same line of longitude as the Cheerleader (6), which aids you
in shooting Zombies who are targeting her, because they always walk diagonally
to align themselves in this way before heading due east to get to her. Walk due
east without stopping, and fire your Water Pistol as you go; you&apos;ll come to the
Cheerleader (6) right up next to a wall on the eastern side of the chamber. If
you see a Zombie rising up from the ground on her east, try letting off a
Pandora&apos;s Box, as it might work.

11. With the Cheerleader (6) safe (or dead), head northwest, north past the
spikes, and east a little. You&apos;ll see a collapsing roof gate to the south; if
you have bazookas to spare and fancy a Key, enter. Walk east and then south to
find the Key, then return northwest, blast down the now collapsed gate and head
north out of there again. Standing in the hallway, head east, and southeast
once you come to a corner to arrive by another collapsing roof gate to the
south. Head south through the gate, turn west and at the corner continue down
the passageway to the south. Past a couple of rows of spikes, you&apos;ll find a
collapsing roof gate; carry on south through that and to the west is an
Explorer (4).

12. Now just head east along a passageway to find a Cheerleader (8) standing by
Ancient Artefacts. The Artefacts are lying on top of a pile of bones, and so
they appear slightly camouflaged. As you approach the Cheerleader (8), a
Vampire will fly in and begin circling you - make sure to be quick in saving
her. Don&apos;t let the Vampire fly into her as he circles you - in order to make
sure this does not happen, you could pause for a moment in the narrow
passageway (where he can&apos;t assume human form) and time your walk over to her.

13. You&apos;ve now got all the Victims and pickups that this level has to offer. As
you&apos;ve picked up Ancient Artefacts, you could fight the Vampire, but I would
advise against it if they were the first you got (that is, you only have 30),
as they&apos;ll be useful later on. Should you decide not to slay him, it&apos;s not
exactly hard to escape.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

38) LEVEL 38: MONSTERS OF THE BLUE LAGOON srch338

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

You need to stay on your toes to save some of the Victims, but it&apos;s at about
the same level of difficulty as level 37 (not very high). If you put aside a
Skeleton Key on level 25, now is the time that your investment matures (if you
want it to yet) - you can get a couple of useful items if you open a Skull Door
on the western side of the level.

MONSTER LIST: Ants (intensity: ranges from medium to high, location: two
 places)
 Doppelgangers [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: high, location:
 one place)
 Squidmen (intensity: ranges from low to high, location: nearly
 everywhere)
 Zombies [Vicious] (intensity: very low, location: one place)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Tourists - On a tiny little island, on the southern side of the level,
 south from a hut equipped with a small jetty.
 2) Baby - On a small, isolated wooden platform, just south of the hut with the
 jetty.
 3) Soldier - Standing by a Bazooka pickup, east of the Skull Door, near the
 northern end of the largest island (on the western side of the level).
 4) Explorer - Standing by the palm trees in the Doppelganger spawning ground
 on the southern side of the level.
 5) Swimming Pool Guy - Among the reeds, past the beach to the east of the hut
 with the jetty.
 6) Explorer - At the start of a rock passage, which leads east from the
 central area of the largest island to the hut with the jetty.
 7) Baby - Standing northwest of the big rock, which contains the cell locked
 behind a Skull Door, in the northwest corner of the largest island.
 8) Explorer - Standing by a couple of palm trees, south of an Ants&apos; nest, on
 the largest island, on the western edge of the level.
 9) Cheerleader - At the northern extremity of the largest island, to the north
 of a large rock, southwest of the long wooden platform on which you start.
10) Tourists - On a tiny little island in the northeast corner of the level.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit
 Bazookas
 Extra Life (if you choose to use a Skeleton Key)
 Monster Potion (behind the same Skull Door)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Fish Fry Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: On the island in the northeast where both
Ants and Squidmen can be found. You will need some exotic weaponry (such as a
Monster Potion or the Flamethrower) to fight them effectively, though, and
you&apos;ll lose health on top of that. Squidmen just aren&apos;t good for point scoring,
as you will be aware by now.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. Head east onto an island with a few palm trees on it, and carry on over to
the eastern edge. After diving into the water, swim north and once abreast of
the tiny little island to the east, swim over there and jump out onto it for a
Tourist Couple (10). Jump off to the south, and swim south until you arrive at
a long wooden platform, just past a pair of rowboats to your west. Once on the
platform, to your southwest will be a trampoline. Jump onto it, and then jump
south over the reeds and into the water.

2. Jump out of the water onto the beach - you will have to move slightly west,
as for some reason, your character has difficulty exiting the water directly
south of the position at which he enters. Walk west, ignoring the locked door
to the south but entering the hut via the hole in the wall. On the eastern end
of the long room inside is a First Aid Kit. Return west and north out through
the damaged wall, again ignoring the doors. Head east to the end of the
building, and then south to the edge of the wooden boards.

3. You now have to save three nearby Victims (2, A and 5), two of which (A and
5) are in some minor danger from the Squidmen who occasionally spawn. If you
use a Ghost Potion then you will reduce still further the probability of their
dying, as you will not need to waste time jumping into and out of the water,
but will be able to just walk over it. You will also move slightly faster over
the water.

4. However, I don&apos;t recommend using a Ghost Potion unless you have two or more
- that is, you&apos;ll still have at least one left afterwards. This is because you
will have a more pressing need for one at the end of level 40. Whether you use
a Ghost Potion or not does not make a difference to the route you ought to take
while collecting the three Victims, so drink up if you want and then proceed to
follow the instructions in paragraph 5.

5. Walk south across the boards until you come to a boat to your west, with a
Fire Extinguisher resting on the deck. Walk onto the boat and collect the Fire
Extinguisher; now head south off the boat and over to the wooden platform to
the southwest. Collect the Baby (2) who is standing on it, and then continue
south and a little east to find a Tourist Couple (2) standing on a tiny little
island. Head east from this island and you will come to the southeast corner of
the level, bounded by water reeds. Go due north from there, passing Soda Cans
on a beach to the west, and you will come to the Swimming Pool Guy (5). Return
south from him to where you saw Soda Cans, and head west onto the beach to
collect them.

6. At this point, if you are still a ghost then you should wait to change back
before continuing. Head west and a little north to arrive on the boards by the
hut you entered earlier. Continue west under the canopy, past the locked door
to the north, and then along the wooden platform to arrive on a secluded beach
area. Head northwest into a passage in the rock, then south out of there to
find an Explorer (6). Continue west from him along the beach to arrive at an
Ants&apos; nest; from there, head south towards a pair of palm trees, which have
another Explorer (8) at their base.

7. Switch to your Water Pistol if you haven&apos;t already got it ready to use. Walk
east across a small bridge and then continue going east and slightly south,
over to an Explorer (4) who is standing just north of a set of palm trees. If
any Doppelgangers look like they&apos;re going to approach the Explorer (4) - quite
unlikely, as it happens - then kill them first. Return west and across the
bridge, then north for a while, past the Ants&apos; nest, to arrive by a Skull Door
with an Extra Life and a Monster Potion behind it. You should ignore this for
now, even if you have a Skeleton Key to use on it, because going in could bring
certain Victims nearly into view (which, you should realise by this stage in
the game, means bringing them into danger).

8. If you switched away from your Water Pistols, you&apos;ll need to switch back to
them now. Head east and north into a wide beach area. Continue east to arrive
by a Soldier (3) who has Bazookas with him; you might find that a Squidman
jumps out of the water to attack him before you can get there. If so, squirt
him with your Water Pistol so that he (hopefully) gives up and jumps back into
the water. Save the Soldier (3) and then head east and north around the large
rock, and west to find a Cheerleader (9). If any Squidmen attack her, squirt
them with your Water Pistol like you did (or would have done) to those
attacking the Soldier (3).

9. Jump into the water to the north and swim over to the long wooden platform.
Once on it, head west over to a little island to find Water Pistol ammo. Dive
into the water to the south and swim south over to the large beach. Walk west
once on the beach to find a Baby (7). As he&apos;s the last Victim, the Exit Door
will now open. Before exiting, you should decide whether you will get the
goodies inside the cell behind the Skull Door, but more importantly, you should
read the preamble to level 39.

IF YOU HAVE A SKELETON KEY:

10. From where the Baby (7) was, head clockwise around the great big rock to
your southeast. You&apos;ll arrive back in front of the Skull Door I told you to
ignore earlier. If you have a Skeleton Key then you can go in and get an Extra
Life and a Monster Potion. However, you might decide to keep your Skeleton Key
for use on a later level; in particular, you could avoid a battle on level 40
by just fleeing through a Skull Door, the Skeleton Key to which you&apos;d normally
have to earn. Have a look at the walkthrough for level 40 if you&apos;re not sure.
After you&apos;ve finished there, head anticlockwise around the big rock to return
to the Exit Door. Read the preamble to level 39&apos;s walkthrough before you use
the Door, though, as you need to prepare yourself.

39) LEVEL 39: DESTROY ALL VAMPIRES srch339

-----

DIFFICULTY: 4/10

Yes, there are two Vampires, and Frankenstein&apos;s Monster shows up, but you&apos;re
granted a great deal of weaponry with which to take them out (you even start
right next to a couple of Ancient Artefacts pickups). Only one Victim is in
great danger of dying, and the Tourists (7) are easy to reach in time. Once you
get past its forbidding exterior, this level is a very easy proposition... and
you get a fat package of bonus points at the end for killing those Vampires.

MONSTER LIST: Frankenstein&apos;s Monster (one)
 Pod Plant (one)
 Squidmen (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Vampires (two)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 37 seconds: #7; spawning
 randomly after 60 seconds, intensity: high, location: the
 eastern and southeast areas of the map)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from medium to
 high, location: two places)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - At the northern side of the level, behind two successive
 Skull Doors. You&apos;ll need to find two Skeleton Keys to get to her.
 2) Baby - On the eastern edge of the level, at the southern end of a little
 yard, which is south of the chamber containing Frankenstein&apos;s Monster and a
 Skeleton Key.
 3) Teacher - In a little yard, northeast of the Pod Plant hiding a Skeleton
 Key, with a First Aid Kit.
 4) Teacher - In a garden on the eastern edge of the level, north of the
 chamber containing spikes. She&apos;s in danger from Vicious Zombies.
 5) Baby - At the southern end of the little yard that&apos;s down the steps to the
 west of your start point.
 6) Cheerleader - On the southern edge of the map, to the east of the Pod Plant
 that hides a Skeleton Key.
 7) Tourists - On the southern edge of the level, on the eastern side of the
 dividing wall. Just head south from where you start. You have plenty of
 time before they become Werewolves.
 8) Baby - At the eastern end of the dungeon in the northwest corner of the
 level, along with Ancient Artefacts.
 9) Explorer - Near the western side of the level, standing in the corner of a
 dais to the east of the water channel.
10) Cheerleader - Between the two Skull Doors leading to Cheerleader #A.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Three Ancient Artefact pickups
 Eight Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 First Aid Kit
 Two Skeleton Keys (both of which you will use)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Vampire Destroyed - 9900 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The yard in the southwest corner of the map,
where Zombies spawn reasonably fast. Although they spawn faster in the garden
on the eastern side, Werewolves spawn there as well and constantly interrupt
you, which makes it a poor choice for safe points-scoring.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. There is one pair of Tourists (7) on this stage, and they will become
Werewolves after 37 seconds. That&apos;s a lot of time, considering the distance you
have to cover to reach them, so you should easily be able to get down there to
save them. However, the Vampire who starts near you will follow you down there,
as will the other one, whom you encounter along the way. You should therefore
pick up the Ancient Artefacts that the level designers have generously provided
at the start point, and slay the Vampires once the Tourists (7) are safe.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. East of where you start are two Ancient Artefacts pickups. Collect them
both, then head south down the tiled walkway, ignoring the Vampire. You come to
a flight of steps to your east, opposite a suit of armour standing up against
the wall. Go down the steps and continue south, keeping to the west in order to
avoid endangering a Teacher (4) in a garden to the east. When you can, turn
west; you&apos;ll find the Tourist Couple (7) standing at the far end of the yard.

3. Once you&apos;ve saved them, head east a little from the dividing barrier, so
that it&apos;s off-screen - there&apos;s a Cheerleader (6) on the other side, and you
don&apos;t want the Vampires to get too close to her. Wait for them to arrive, and
them kill them with the Ancient Artefacts. If you run out of Artefacts, then
switch to using Weedkiller to finish them off. To keep nearby Victims safe,
don&apos;t stray too far north or west while fighting the Vampires.

VICTIMS:

4. Go to the tiled area at the centre of the yard, and then head north,
skirting the western edge of the yard. Do not get near to the eastern edge of
the northern section of the yard, as a Teacher (4) to your east will likely be
killed by Zombies if you allow her into view. Go north up the stairs, and then
head northwest, along a walkway, and northwest again across a tiled yard, to
find another stairway to your south. Head down the stairs and across to the
other end of the sunken yard at the bottom, and you will come to a Baby (5) and
two Pandora&apos;s Boxes.

5. Return north and up the steps, and then walk onto the walkway to the
northwest and head west until you arrive at a dais. There is an Explorer (9) in
the northwest corner, so collect him and then move south and down the steps to
a grassy area. Walk southeast from the foot of the steps and you&apos;ll find
another couple of Pandora&apos;s Boxes. Return northwest to the steps and then
continue west, and you&apos;ll find a channel of water to the north. Dive in, and
then swim north until you see an opening to the west. Jump out here.

6. Head south along the alleyway, and into a covered tunnel at the southern end
of the grassy area, where the weeds are. You come out into a little yard where
Zombies spawn. There is a Weedkiller pickup in the southeast corner for you to
collect; when you have it, head south out of there via the next tunnel, in the
southwest corner. You will emerge by a third pair of Pandora&apos;s Boxes; collect
them, then switch to your Weedkiller and head east a little to find a Pod Plant
to the north, around a corner. Sweep it up, and pick up the Skeleton Key on
which it was resting.

7. Keep alongside the southern wall and head east. You&apos;ll find a Cheerleader
(6) in a corner. From her, head north and slightly west through the weeds to
find a tunnel opening to the north. Go through and you&apos;ll find a Teacher (3)
and a First Aid Kit. Return south and into the main yard, then head west,
cutting through the weeds, to reach another tunnel heading north. Walk through
and at the other side, head northwest past another patch of weeds - in order to
avoid using more Weedkiller, you can skirt the south wall at the point where
they appear to stretch across the yard. You will arrive back in the featureless
alleyway you walked down earlier. Walk north along it this time and dive into
the water channel to the east at the end.

8. Swim north up the channel and into a wide pond, then go west over to the
edge of the water and jump out. Move north from there to find a dungeon door
blocking your way. Head through and then walk east to the other end to find a
Baby (8) and Ancient Artefacts. Having collected those, head west and south out
of the dungeon, then jump into the water to the east and swim over to the
platform in the northeast corner of the pond. Jump out and then walk northeast
into the corner. From there, push southeast and you will enter a long covered
passage heading south. Walk further south to come out the other end into a
grassy yard.

9. Head northeast over to a flight of steps. Walk north up them and at the top,
head east and then south. Take the next turning east that you come to, and
descend the steps to the south. You arrive in a yard. Head southeast and push
southeast into the wall, and you will enter another passage south. Head south
over to the far side of the next small garden you enter, and then walk east,
skirting the wall, to pass the weeds without having to bother cutting them down
with the Weedkiller. On the eastern side of the weeds are a Key and yet another
pair of Pandora&apos;s Boxes for you to pick up. Return west along the south side of
the garden, and then north through the tunnel back into the other yard.

10. You will now fight Frankenstein&apos;s Monster. You could use Bazookas (best),
Ancient Artefacts (a good choice provided you have more than about seventy of
them) or Weedkiller (the slowest feasible way to kill him, and the one that
will lead to your losing the most health). Switch to the most suitable weapon
you have, and then head northeast over to a long tunnel heading north, and
enter. Once out the northern end, continue northeast to come to Frankenstein&apos;s
Monster, who will start attacking you. Kill him and then head north through his
charging electrodes to find a Skeleton Key.

11. Head south again through the electrodes and over to the southern wall of
the laboratory. You can see two large air holes in the wall to the south - the
western one, in the passage built of lighter stone, is the one you entered
Frankie&apos;s chamber from; while the one on the right, in the middle of the darker
stone, is the exit you want to use now. With this in mind, press southwest into
the wall, and once you move into the passageway, just carry on walking south.
You emerge in a long yard; walk to the southeast corner to find a Baby (2).

12. Read the whole of this paragraph before carrying out its instructions, in
order to increase the survival prospects of your next Victim, a hazardously
placed Teacher (4). Switch to your Water Pistol and Pandora&apos;s Boxes. Walk
southwest and into a passage heading south. Once in, start firing your Water
Pistol continuously as you walk south. You will pass through a tiny yard that
holds a Weedkiller pickup; you should ignore this for now. Continue south and
you will pass through another passage and into a much larger yard. You should
be able to see the Teacher (4) now, in the southwest corner of the screen. If
there is a Zombie anywhere near her, use a Pandora&apos;s Box now to try and get rid
of him. Otherwise, march southwest, still firing your Water Pistol at any
Zombie which gets in your way, and collect her.

13. Head northeast again and north into the tunnel you just came out of. On the
other side of it is the Weedkiller pickup that I told you to ignore earlier.
You may now stop ignoring it. Once you have collected it, head southwest again
through the tunnel and then south to the other side of the yard. Push southwest
into the wall and you&apos;ll enter a tunnel heading south - this is the last
tunnel, I promise. Out the other side, you&apos;ll be in a stone-paved chamber
containing several strips of spikes. Exit the chamber by heading out the west
side, timing your walk over the spikes so that you don&apos;t get hurt. Continue
west past a couple of steps, and you&apos;ll find yourself walking onto the
partially tiled section of the yard where you fought the Vampires earlier.

14. Head north from the tiled area, up some stairs and along the walkway to the
northwest. Continue north across a tiled courtyard, through a collapsing roof
gate, and yet further north to the end of the corridor, where you&apos;ll find a
Skull Door. Head through this and open a Chest. Head east from the Chest to
collect a Cheerleader (10) in front of another Skull Door, to the south; go
through that one to come to the final Cheerleader (A).

40) MORE TERROR THAN BEFORE: LEVEL 40: PYRAMID OF FEAR TWO srch340

-----

DIFFICULTY: 6/10

This is a complicated stage, hence the rather long walkthrough. It comprises a
mini-boss fight with a Snakeoid, followed by a labyrinthine pyramid interior
populated with Mummies, Squidmen and Zombies. The Snakeoid shouldn&apos;t cause you
too much harm if you use your heavy weaponry effectively... and keep out of the
way of his wicked tongue. You need to locate a Skeleton Key to get through to
Victims 2 and 6, who are far to the north, and three of the Victims are in
decidedly unsafe positions, which ramps up the difficulty further.

MONSTER LIST: Mummies (intensity: ranges from low to medium, location: patchy)
 Squidmen (intensity: ranges from low to medium, location: in a
 few places - wherever there is water, except for the trench
 on the southern edge of the level)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from very low to
 high, location: patchy)

BOSS: Snakeoid (one)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Explorer - In a tiny little cell, north of the location of the second
 Skeleton Key, accessed through a long tunnel north behind a sandbank.
 2) Explorer - Past the second Skull Door, north of the large pool, in another
 small cell adjoining the walkway at the edge of the water.
 3) Explorer - West of the main entrance area of the pyramid, north through a
 tunnel behind a sandbank, in a large chamber with a sarcophagus.
 4) Explorer - In a little alcove, in the northwest corner of the large maze to
 the south of the second Skull Door.
 5) Swimming Pool Guy - In the little pool to the west as you enter the main
 entrance area of the pyramid.
 6) Explorer - Past the second Skull Door, to the west of the large pool and
 near a sarcophagus. Inexplicably, he sometimes does not appear on your
 Victim Radar.
 7) Explorer - South of the area where the second Skeleton Key is found,
 between the two passages you use to get there. He sometimes isn&apos;t on the
 Victim Radar, as well.
 8) Swimming Pool Guy - In a pool to the southwest of the second Skull Door,
 reached by heading south through a collapsing roof gate. He sometimes isn&apos;t
 on the Victim Radar, as well.
 9) Tourists - In the northeast corner of the sunny courtyard where you start.
10) Baby - Northwest of where you start, next to the western wall of the
 courtyard. He&apos;s quite vulnerable to attack from the Snakeoid.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: A double Bazooka pickup, and Soda Cans (both on the exact
 same spot, next to where you start)
 Ancient Artefacts
 Two Skeleton Keys (both of which you will use - unless you
 have only one Victim, in which case you&apos;ll only use one)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Fish Fry Bonus - 1000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The area south of the second Skull Door, past
a collapsing roof gate. Zombies spawn pretty quickly here, although Mummies
occasionally wander along as well.

-----

VICTIMS:

1. Head northwest quickly to collect a Baby (10). Return southeast to where you
started to find a double-value Bazooka pickup and Soda Cans placed on the exact
same spot. As you&apos;ll have noticed by now, there&apos;s a Snakeoid in the courtyard
with you. You need to kill him in order to get past the Skull Door to the
north. Try standing diagonally near the mound of earth, then running out of the
way when its head rears up, and firing on it. One of the very best weapons to
do this with, is with the Bazookas you just picked up. A caution, though -
leave yourself at least one shell, as I&apos;ll be directing you to use it later on
in the level. Should you use so many shells that you&apos;re left with just that one
left, you can use a few of the Pandora&apos;s Boxes you picked up in level 39; but
don&apos;t let your ammo drop below four.

2. Although you picked up Soda Cans with the Bazookas, they aren&apos;t nearly as
good as the Bazookas for fighting the Snakeoid - mainly because you have to
first run out of the way, and then wait for them to fly through the air, which
is rather too much of a time delay to have a good chance of hitting the
Snakeoid before it moves its head back underground. With this in mind, don&apos;t
use the Soda Cans at all, but revert to more basic weapons like the Water
Pistol after you have depleted your stock of Bazooka shells and Pandora&apos;s
Boxes. You really shouldn&apos;t find yourself getting that low on ammo, though. One
last note - if you find that the Snakeoid disappears and you can&apos;t get it to
reappear, walking around the perimeter of the courtyard seems to work as well
as anything.

3. Once he&apos;s blown up, collect the Skeleton Key he leaves behind and then head
northeast over to the far corner of the courtyard, where you&apos;ll find Tourists
(9). In the centre of the northern wall of the courtyard is a Skull Door; open
it and then walk north along a passage. You&apos;ll arrive between two small pools
to your left and right; dive into the one to your left and collect a Swimming
Pool Guy (5). Return to the waterside using the steps to the east, then head
north and west around the pool, past a couple of sarcophagi and a passage
north. You&apos;ll come to a corner; don&apos;t head south yet, but first read paragraphs
4 and 5 in full in order to be ready to save an Explorer (3).

4. Switch to your Fire Extinguisher and Pandora&apos;s Boxes. The Fire Extinguisher
is necessary because you&apos;re going to be defending the Explorer (3) against
Mummies, which are neither killed nor slowed by the Water Pistol - at least,
they&apos;re not killed within the time it takes them to do some killing of their
own. Push into the corner in the northwest of the passage. Can you see a Mummy
shuffling around inside the chamber to the northwest? If you can, then walk
east back over to the area between the two small pools, and then west to return
to the corner; check again and repeat if necessary.

5. Once there appears to be no Mummy, head south and then west over to a
Sandbank on the north wall of the passage. Open it, but don&apos;t bother picking up
the item if one appears; just head into the tunnel sharpish. You will emerge in
a spacious chamber containing an Explorer (3), with a sarcophagus set against
the northern wall. There&apos;s a good chance that a Mummy has already walked out of
the sarcophagus and started approaching the Explorer (3). If so, you have two
options: freeze it with the Fire Extinguisher (a good idea if you have it in a
direct line of sight and can get there in time); or try and blast it with a
Pandora&apos;s Box.

6. Once you&apos;ve collected the Explorer (3), or once he&apos;s been killed, head
southeast into the dark patch on the southern wall of the chamber. You will
come out of the tunnel on the south side, where the Sandbank was. If it
revealed an item when you pulled it down, then you may pick it up now. Hug the
southern wall of the passage and head due east, and you&apos;ll pass the two small
pools and the pyramid&apos;s entrance hallway and arrive at a corner in the passage.
Head north here, through a collapsing roof gate, and then southeast into
another hidden passage heading south (again, marked by an orange patch on the
wall). You will burst through a Sandbank in a wide chamber. Head southeast to
save another Explorer (7).

7. North of that Explorer (7) is a Sandbank. Open it to find a tunnel behind.
Walk north into the tunnel, and you arrive in a constricted chamber. Continue
to the northern end of the chamber and collect a Skeleton Key, then open the
Sandbank to its east. Yet another tunnel is revealed; walk north into it and
you will come out into a little cell containing an Explorer (A). Having picked
him up, head south down the passage again, and through the small room and the
second passage, to arrive in the large room where the other Explorer (7) was.
Head north to the far end of the western of the tunnels on the north wall, and
you&apos;ll return to the main, maze-like section of the pyramid.

8. Head west and you will come to a collapsing roof gate to the north. Walk
through it and continue north through a further two gates up ahead. Through the
second of the pair of gates, head east and then northeast to find a Sandbank
near a pool of water. Continue east along the side of the pool, and then north,
carefully passing over a couple of rows of flame traps. At the end of the
corridor is a Sandbank; open it up, but don&apos;t head through into the passage it
reveals. Head south across the flame traps again instead, and west at the pool.
Continue west until you arrive at a T-junction, with collapsing roof gates to
the north and south.

9. Head through the gate to the north, and in the next area, walk into the
passage leading out of the northeast corner. You&apos;ll arrive in a room where
Zombies spawn rapidly. Continue northeast to find a Sandbank against the
northern wall. Ignore the tunnel hidden behind it, as you did the last one, and
return southwest through the passage. You arrive to the south of a collapsing
roof gate; walk north through it. When the gate collapses behind you, turn
around and fire a Bazooka shell south into it to clear away the blockage - you
will need to use this path later, and you won&apos;t be able to fire Bazookas at the
time, because you&apos;ll be in ghost form. Now, carry on north until you come to a
sarcophagus standing against the wall, just west of the second Skull Door.

10. Open the Skull Door and head through. You come out onto a platform between
two large pools of water, with a Pot to your north. Open the Pot and then
switch to your Ghost Potions. If you have no Ghost Potion to use at this point,
then you will be following the same route as if you had used one, but your
chances of successfully collecting two particular Victims, #s 6 and 8, will be
a little slimmer. While carrying out the instructions in paragraphs 11 and 12,
be sure to pause the game when you&apos;re not moving, as you only have a limited
amount of time to spend as a ghost.

11. Stand on the steps of the western pool of water. Drink a Ghost Potion, then
head west all the way over the water and onto the steps at the other end. A
short distance west from these steps is an Explorer (6), and provided that a
Mummy hasn&apos;t already beaten you to him, you need to save him very quickly. From
him, head east along the platform next to the water. If you find yourself
walking into the sarcophagus that protrudes from the wall, then move a little
south to get around it. You&apos;ll see two small chambers to your north as you
walk; in the second one is another Explorer (2). Return south to the walkway
and head west, and onto the water via the steps. Head east over to the far side
of the pool, and go south into the darker wall section to travel down the
tunnel and back out through the opened Skull Door.

12. Walk south down the passageway to the west of the Skull Door, pass through
the collapsing roof gate which you already re-opened, and onto the water to the
west via the steps that lead down into it. Carry on walking west and you should
hopefully get to the Swimming Pool Guy (8) before a Squidman does. Leave the
water via the stairs to the west, and wait on the waterside to return to human
form (note that you must have left the water before you will change back). Head
north across the flame traps and you will come to an Explorer (4) in a little
alcove. Should it look as though the Explorer is in danger from Zombies, it
would of course be sensible to walk across the flame traps whether they&apos;re
firing or not...

PICKUPS:

13. There are still Ancient Artefacts to collect nearby. These will be very
helpful in the coming levels, and you would be well advised to take a quick
detour in order to get them. Oh, and there&apos;s a Sandbank you haven&apos;t checked
yet, as well. To get to these, head south out of that alcove and east along a
corridor. Take the next north turn and you will find Ancient Artefacts to your
west; continue east from there to find a Sandbank on the wall to the north.
Open it and then return west, south, and west over to the alcove, where the
Exit Door awaits you.

41) THEY ARE BACK! IN: LEVEL 41: MARTIANS GO HOME! srch341

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

This is indeed the last level in which you&apos;ll encounter the Martians, so why
not add insult to the injuries you&apos;ve (hopefully) already caused them, by
managing to save every last Victim? That&apos;s actually not particularly hard to do
- assuming you start with all of them, of course... On top of that, there&apos;s an
abundance of very useful items (including pickups granting you a total of one
hundred Plates!). There&apos;s no Martian Spaceship to worry about, which is a
relief as the level is big and complicated enough as it is (as you may have
noticed if you&apos;ve glanced at the length of the two walkthroughs). In terms of
difficulty, though, even if you start using a password, this level is a piece
of cake.

MONSTER LIST: Doppelgangers [Normal] (intensity: high, location: one place)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: patchy)
 Martians (intensity: ranges from medium to high, location: nearly
 everywhere)
 Pod Plants (two)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Baby - In the northwest of the level, inside a house, by a couple of Plates
 pickups.
 2) Cheerleader - In a house to the south of the weed-covered lawn, in the
 southern room (past a locked door), also near Plates. She&apos;s in danger from
 the Martians, as one of them will often beam in when you approach.
 3) Trampoline Girl - In the yard southeast of the house containing the Baby
 (A), and north of the field where Doppelgangers spawn.
 4) Cheerleader - In a yard accessible through a broken-down fence, south of
 the area where the two First Aid Kits are.
 5) Barbecue Guy - North of where you start, on the other side of a hedge.
 6) Tourists - At the southern end of the yard that is southeast of the large
 weed-covered garden.
 7) Teacher - In a house in the southwest corner of the level.
 8) Baby - Standing on the carpet, in a large room inside a house to the east
 of the weed-covered area, on the southern edge of the level.
 9) Soldier - Standing near Bazookas on the west side of the level, where
 Doppelgangers spawn.
10) Baby - On the eastern edge of the large weed patch in the middle of the
 garden, near the centre of the level.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Speed Shoes
 Two First Aid Kits
 Monster Potion
 Five Plates pickups
 Bazookas
 Martian Bubble Gun
 Decoy Clowns
 Extra Life

BONUSES AVAILABLE: 50 points per Victim saved
 You Saved More Victims Bonus - 1000 points (two-player mode)
 Note: You cannot obtain the&quot;All Victims Saved Bonus&quot;on
 this level. I don&apos;t know why.

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The Martians appear just about everywhere,
but you&apos;re less prone to attack from Jelly Blobs if you stick near the
northwest corner of the map. Bear in mind that Martians are hard to hit, but
find it easy to hit you, so you could regret trying to earn an Extra Bonus
Victim on this level.

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You have been playing for a while):

VICTIMS:

1. Go west to find a Key, stepping slightly south around the glowing meteorite,
as a Jelly Blob is likely to appear. Head northeast from there, into the corner
between the hedges, and use the Bazooka to blast through the weak hedge section
to the north. Having walked through to the other side, go east to find a
Barbecue Guy (5). There&apos;s a Burger lying on the floor near him, so collect it
if you need a health boost. Go north from there for a Bin, and then continue
north around that and into the house. Once inside, head southeast to find a Key
near an armchair.

2. Walk north, and west a little bit to find a Cupboard next to a pair of
bookcases. Go north through the entrance to the next room, and east to find
Speed Shoes in a little alcove. Return west and south to the previous room, and
check the northwest corner to find a little Cupboard under the sink. Head out
the building&apos;s western exit into a garden, and walk north into a dead-end
alleyway to find a Key. Head south out of the alley again, and then southwest
across the garden. At the southwest corner, there is an entrance into a little
square yard lined with hedges; use your Bazooka to blast down the hedge block
to the north. This reveals a hidden passageway; walk in, and when you emerge at
the other side you&apos;ll find a Cheerleader (4).

3. Head through the gap in the fence to the north and continue over to a door.
Enter, and then go through a second door to find a First Aid Kit and a Cupboard
in a small room together. Head south through the two doors again and then head
east across the southern end of the little yard with the meteorite in. Inside
the house, head northeast to find a Cupboard. You should still have your weapon
switched to the Bazookas, so stand south of the cracked wall in the bathroom
and fire at it; walk through the hole you made to find a Monster Potion in the
little walled-off passageway.

4. Return south into the bathroom and then continue south into another room,
where you will find Soda Cans and a Cupboard. Head north, back into the
bathroom, and then go west and then south along a passageway. Once past the
western entrance, by which you accessed the building, head west into the large
front room to find a Cupboard along the northern wall. From that cupboard, head
southeast and out the front door. Outside, head southwest to arrive back in the
small yard you passed through earlier, with the damaged hedge block to the
north. Head over to the western side of the yard, and walk into the block, past
the western wall, that appears green. You&apos;ll enter another passageway covered
with ivy, like the one earlier; once in, head north to exit into a new area.

5. Walk northeast into a dead end to find two Keys. Head out of there and walk
north alongside the wall to find a fence at the northern end of the garden. Use
your Bazooka to blast down the section with the serrated top, and head through.
Open a Bin, and then walk around it and into the northeast corner of the yard
to get a First Aid Kit. Head south out through the hole in the hedge again, and
then southwest. Past the southeast corner of the building, you will find an
entrance in the wall to the north; go in.

6. Head west to find a Cupboard, and then north around the little kitchen area
to find another one. From there, head east past the unlit fireplace and north
to find a third Cupboard. Continue northwest into the corner of the room to
find a fourth one, then go southwest and out of the building into a long, thin
garden. Head south through a hole in a fence, and then head west to find
Weedkiller. Go southeast from this and jump onto the trampoline to save a
Trampoline Girl (3). Jump off to the west; go slightly south around the corner
of the house, west and north in through the open door.

7. Walk north onto the carpet to pick up two Keys, then quickly continue
northwest (ignoring the Cupboard for now) and collect a Baby (A) in a small
kitchen area. Take the two Plates pickups in front of the sink as well. You can
now head south again and open the Cupboard in the northwest corner of the front
room. Having done so, head north again into the kitchen and then open the
Cupboard against the wall to the east. Walk east across the passage into an
empty room containing only a Cupboard; open it, then walk southwest again into
the passageway. Walk north and you will find a Cupboard at the end of the
passage.

8. Head south and exit the house via the opening to the west. You emerge in an
alley. Head north, west and then south for a while; you will find a Bin after a
bit of a walk. When the alleyway opens out into a wide yard containing trees,
head east to get a Soldier (9. Go south for a Bazooka pickup sitting between
two meteorites, and continue south through a door into a house. Once inside,
walk southwest to find a Teacher (7). Walk southeast from her to find a
Cupboard just inside a little passageway; return northwest to find another
Cupboard in a corner. Head around the kitchen unit and north, and you will find
a Cupboard in the northwest corner of the house. Walk east along the northern
wall and out of the door that you entered by.

9. Head south down the alleyway to your east and you will find a Key where it
turns east; do not continue with it. Instead, return north and you will come to
a long hedge in your way. Blast down a weak section with the Bazookas and head
through; to your east is a trampoline. Jump onto it and then jump off to the
southeast. You land in a large garden just north of a weed infestation. Head
east, keeping south of another trampoline, and then southeast to find a Baby
(10) at the edge of the weeds.

10. Switch to the Weedkiller and head west into the weeds. You will come to a
Pod Plant; kill it and then pick up the Key it was sitting on. Head southeast
over to an open door, and head south through the first room inside (ignoring
the Cupboard for now). Pass through another door and head swiftly west to find
a Cheerleader (2) at the other end of the room. Pick up Plates to her north,
then open the Cupboard to their southeast. Return east to the door, head north
and go to the northwest corner of the next room to deal with the Cupboard you
left unopened earlier.

11. Head northeast out the door, then southeast through a small opening into a
little yard whose northern end is also full of weeds. Kill the Pod Plant and
clear a path through the weeds heading south; open the Bin and then save the
Tourists (6) at the southern end of the yard. Go north again, along the path
you cleared, and out onto the big lawn. Switch to your Bazookas and blow down
one of the weak patches in the hedge to the east. Head through, and go
southeast into an open door.

12. West of the entrance to the building is a Cupboard. Open it, then walk east
and south around the partition wall, and open the Cupboard on the other side.
Walk southeast from there to find two Plates pickups on the floor together.
Move southwest from them to find a Cupboard in the corner of the house. From
that, walk east along a passage and you will come to a door to the north;
enter, and collect the Baby (8) who&apos;s standing on the carpet. I don&apos;t recommend
exiting straightaway, but if you do, at least read the preamble to level 42
first.

PICKUPS:

13. Head south out of that room, west and then north and out of the building.
Once out, walk northeast to find a Martian Bubble Gun near a hedge. Walk
southeast from there, and when you come to the hedge, continue south. Past a
tree, you will find the end of the hedge; walk east around it and then head
north. Go east once past the end of the building, and then southeast and in
through a door. Inside, go west to find a Cupboard and then a Fire
Extinguisher.

14. Walk to the eastern end of the corridor and you will find a door to the
north. Go through and open a Cupboard straight ahead, then head north around
the wall into a little sitting room. You&apos;ll find a Water Pistol and Decoy
Clowns in front of a Cupboard. Switch to your Bazookas and head south to the
other end of the room, then walk east, past the door, into the bathroom. Blast
down the damaged wall at the northern end of the bathroom, and walk through the
hole. Carry on walking north up the alleyway to find an Extra Life at the far
end.

15. To return to the Exit Door, follow these directions: head south; southwest
through the hole in the wall, and then through a door; northwest through a
door, over to the west side of a hedge, and past the corner of the building you
were just in; southwest past the other corner, and past the end of another
hedge; north past a tree, and west when the area widens out into a big lawn;
south into the first door you come to, and over to the southern end of the room
inside; east along a passageway, and north through a doorway into the room
where the Exit Door is. Before making use of the Door, make sure you read the
preamble to level 42.

-----

WALKTHROUGH: (You have started on this level using a password):

VICTIMS:

1. Walk west to find a Key, stepping slightly south around the glowing
meteorite, as a Jelly Blob is likely to appear. Now, head southeast to find a
pathway heading south out of the large grassy area. At the southern end, you&apos;ll
find a door; ignore that for now and instead head west, northwest past the
corner of the building and then southwest past another corner and the end of a
hedge. Head north past a tree and when the area you are in opens out into a
much wider lawn, head northwest to find Martian Bubble Gun near a hedge.

2. From the location of the gun, head southwest to find an open door into the
building to the south. Walk in and open the Cupboard to the west of the
entrance, then walk east and south around the partition wall to get to another
one. From that one go southeast to find two Plates pickups by the wall, and
then turn to head southwest into the corner of the room, to find a third
Cupboard to open. Walk east from that and you will find a door to the north;
enter and walk onto the carpet where a Baby (8) is waiting for you.

3. Head back out through the door to the south, and go west along the
passageway and north and out through the front door. Now head north and a
little west, and into a little square yard through a gap in the hedge. To your
west is a block of greenery; walk into it and you will find that you have
entered a passage hidden under the ivy. Head north out of there, and once
visible past the tree, go east into a little alcove for two Keys, and then head
out again and continue west. When you come to a trampoline, turn to head north
and you will come to an open door letting you into a house.

4. Head west of the entrance to find a Cupboard under the sink, then walk
around to the north to find a second one. Head east past the fireplace, then
north to find a third Cupboard next to a bookcase, and walk northwest from
there into the corner of the room for one last one. Head west out of the
building through the side entrance, and then walk south and through the gap in
the fence. There&apos;s a Weedkiller pickup immediately to your west once through;
be sure to collect it. Go southeast from there and jump onto the trampoline to
rescue the Trampoline Girl (3) from her perpetual bouncing.

5. Jump west off the trampoline. Step south to walk around the plants by the
side of the house, then walk west and north into the building. You will find
two more Keys straight ahead on the carpet; after you have them, walk
northwest, disregarding the Cupboard for now, and over to a Baby (A). Collect
the two Plates pickups and then walk south again and open up the Cupboard you
were ignoring. Walk around to the north and open another Cupboard to the east
of where the Baby (A) was standing. Continue east across the passageway and you
will find a Cupboard in the otherwise empty room opposite the kitchen. Head
back into the passageway, then walk north along it to find a Cupboard at the
other end.

6. Head out the house using the exit to the west, to find yourself in an
alleyway. Follow the path north, west and then south; after about twenty metres
it widens out and shortly after that you come to a Bin. From that head
southeast past a corner in the hedge and you will find a Soldier (9) just north
of a glowing meteorite. Once he is safe, head south to find first a Bazooka
pickup, then a locked door into another house. Open it, and once inside walk
southwest to find a Teacher (7) in the middle of the room.

7. Walk southeast to find a Cupboard. From that, walk northwest to find another
Cupboard, north of where the Teacher (7) was. Continue north around the kitchen
area to find a third Cupboard in the northwest corner of the house. Head east
from this, and walk out the door to the north to exit back to the
Doppelganger-filled area. Walk east over to the hedge, and then south down the
narrow alleyway to find a Key at the other end.

8. Do not continue east with the alleyway; instead return north, and walk
northwest once past the end of the alley to return to the wide pathway heading
north, which you used previously. Walk north to the end, then head southeast
into the house, southwest and southeast into the front room and south out the
front door. Head east to get to a trampoline, jump onto it, and jump off to the
southeast. On the other side of the wall, continue east around the weeds,
keeping south of another trampoline, and then head southeast to collect a Baby
(10) on the edge of the weed patch.

9. Switch to your Weedkiller and cut a swathe through the errant plant life to
the west. Kill the Pod Plant that is in the centre of the tangle and pick up
the Key it was hiding. Walk southeast of there and in through the open door. Do
not open the Cupboard to the west yet, but walk straight across the room to the
southern door. Go through and walk west to find a Cheerleader (2) at the other
end of the room. Once you have saved her, go north over to the little kitchen
area to find Plates.

10. Head southeast to find a Cupboard against the north wall. Carry on east,
and walk north through the door, then northwest over to the Cupboard you passed
earlier. Open it and then head out of the building through the door to the
northeast. Make sure that your weapon is still switched to the Weedkiller, then
head southeast through a gap, into a small yard containing another Pod Plant.
Exterminate it, and then clear a path to the southern end of the yard. Open the
Bin, and then save the Tourists (6) who are standing around at the far end.

11. Head north, along the path that you cleared through the weeds, and out into
the wide garden where the rest of the weeds are. Continue north, skirting the
eastern wall, and at the northeast corner turn to head northwest to where a
trampoline stands against the wall. Jump onto it, and then jump off to the
east. From where you land, head north, and when you come to a meteorite stuck
in the ground, turn to move northeast instead. You will come to a fence; use a
Bazooka shell to knock down the weak spot (notable by its pointed top).

12. Head through the fence and open the Bin, and then head around it to the
north to find a First Aid Kit in the northeast corner of the yard. Return
south, through your hole in the fence, and continue south and into the
passageway under the greenery at the far end of the garden. Head east out of
there, and northeast to find a hedge block to the north. Your Bazooka ammo is
far too limited for you to use it to open up every last shortcut, so you&apos;ll
have to go the long way round.

13. Head northeast and you will come to a door. Enter and head northwest to
find a Cupboard up against a wall; go northeast from there, past an exit to the
west, and you will come to another Cupboard just west of a bathroom. Head into
the bathroom and launch a Bazooka shell at the cracked wall to the north; walk
through the hole and collect a Monster Potion. Go back into the bathroom, and
continue south into a little room containing Soda Cans and a Cupboard. Head
northeast into the bathroom again, and then head west and southwest out of the
side door into a little yard.

14. Carry on west a few metres and you&apos;ll find a small building to the north.
Go in, open the second door that you come to, and you&apos;ll find a First Aid Kit
and a Cupboard. Go south out of there, and continue south through a hole in the
fence at the far side of the yard; you come to a Cheerleader (4). Get her and
then head north through the fence again, east at the corner, and southeast and
out of the large house through the front door.

15. Walk northeast from the door and you will come to the side entrance to
another house. Do not go in yet - check the little dead-end passage to the
north for a Key. One you have that, go inside and open the Cupboard to the
north of the entrance. Head east from there and open the next Cupboard, just
past an entrance to the north. Go through the entrance and head east once
inside the next room, to find Speed Shoes in a little alcove.

16. Walk west again, and south through the opening in the partition wall. Head
southeast to find a Key in a protruding section of the front room. Go northwest
from there to return to the main room, and head out the door to the south. Walk
south to find a Bin, and then continue around the Bin and southeast to find a
Barbecue Guy (5). There&apos;s a Burger lying on the floor nearby, which will give
you three points of health if you pick it up. You ought to go and get the Extra
Life before exiting, but even if you don&apos;t want to (and why not?), read the
preamble to level 42 in order to be prepared for it.

PICKUPS:

17. Use your Bazooka to blast through the hedge to the south. Head through into
the yard where you began the level; go to the centre of the southern side to
find a pathway leading south. At the southern end of this path is a door, which
you can now enter. Once inside, go west to find a Cupboard and a Fire
Extinguisher, and then walk east over to the other end of the corridor. You&apos;ll
find a door to the north; go through and open the Cupboard that is right ahead
of you. Head north around the Cupboard and in the room beyond you will find a
Water Pistol, some Decoy Clowns, and a Cupboard to open.

18. Return south to the other end of the room, and then east into a bathroom.
There&apos;s a cracked wall to the north; use your Bazooka on it to open up a hole.
You should have one Bazooka shell left now; you will be able to access no less
than two Ghost Potions with this on level 43. Head through the new opening in
the wall and then walk northeast into an alleyway heading north; at the far end
you will find an Extra Life. Go southwest again, through the hole in the wall
and then through the door. Walk west along the passageway, north through the
door you came in by, and carry on walking north. You will arrive in the yard
where you started this level; go over to the northeast side, find the hole you
made in the hedge and go through. Before using the Exit Door, you ought to read
the preamble to level 42 below.

42) TERROR HAS A NEW NAME! LEVEL 42: SPIKES srch342

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10 to 6/10

This level is not like anything you&apos;ve seen before. It&apos;s just a big paved
courtyard covered with the timed spike traps you&apos;ve become familiar with from
the castle levels that you&apos;ve visited. The spike beds rise and fall in a
complex pattern that requires timing and efficient movement. However, just to
add a little urgency to the mix, Werewolves will spawn near the edges of the
map, meaning that to collect the majority of the Victims in the level you will
have to be fast, and adept at fending off the creatures while also making your
way across the spikes. Expect to lose health (and Victims), especially the
first few times you play. Of course, if you had something to make you
invulnerable to spikes and Werewolf claws, you might find it considerably
easier...

MONSTER LIST: Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 8 seconds: #6; spawning
 randomly after ten seconds, intensity: high, location: near
 the perimeter of the level)
 Also, in case you hadn&apos;t guessed, there are lots and lots of
 spikes.

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Teacher - In the northwest corner of the map.
 2) Dog - In the southeast corner of the map.
 3) Explorer - Southwest of where you start, in the centre of a set of pillars.
 4) Teacher - East of your start point, in the midst of a larger group of
 pillars.
 5) Soldier - East and a little south of where you start, near the eastern
 wall.
 6) Tourists - South and a little east of your start point, past just a few
 beds of spikes.
 7) Cheerleader - North of where you start.
 8) Cheerleader - Just west of where you start, across a single large bed of
 spikes.
 9) Cheerleader - Northeast of your start location, in a fairly large clear
 area just north of the largest set of pillars.
10) Baby - Up against the northern wall of the level, just northwest of
 Cheerleader #7.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two Pandora&apos;s Boxes

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: You can hang around and fight Werewolves on
the spikes if you like, but even if you have masses of Silverware it would be a
very poor decision.

-----

PREAMBLE:

This level is much easier if you drink either a Ghost Potion or a Monster
Potion, as you can disregard the spikes and walk directly between Victims - you
can pretty much bypass all of the level with one potion, provided that you&apos;re
efficient enough and don&apos;t waste time (read: pause the game whenever you&apos;re not
moving, and don&apos;t hang around fighting Werewolves). Assuming you&apos;ve got any
potions, through, the question you should ask yourself is whether you can
afford to use one of them. If you have a Ghost Potion, then go for it, as
you&apos;ll get two more on the next level anyway. If you only have Monster Potions,
then I would strongly advise against it if you have less than three - and I&apos;d
still recommend against it if you have less than five, unless you have masses
of other heavy weapons to use on the later levels.

If you choose not to use a potion, your path through the level will be more
complicated, as you&apos;ll need to pick your route carefully not only to avoid
crossing raised spikes, but also to keep away from the edges of the map, where
Werewolves spawn, where possible. Consequently the second walkthrough, for
those who aren&apos;t using potions, is longer and perhaps harder to follow, though
I&apos;ve tried to make it as self-explanatory as possible. Whichever walkthrough
you use, you&apos;ll start by collecting the Tourists (6) to your southeast, as
they&apos;ll turn into Werewolves after just 8 seconds otherwise.

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You will use a potion):

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

1. As you wait to begin, press on the down-arrow on the control pad, so that
you start to move south as soon as possible. You will walk off the featureless
square of flagstones on which you start and across a sunken bed of spikes, over
to a pillar at the southern end of another safe area. Walk east and wait for
the bed of spikes to sink, then walk across it and rescue Tourists (6).

NEIGHBOURS:

2. Drink your potion of choice, and when the transformation is over, walk
northwest to find a Cheerleader (8). Head south from her; you will walk past a
couple of pillars to the west before finding an Explorer (3) on the other side
of them. Return to the eastern side of the pillars after saving him, and head
southeast to find a Pandora&apos;s Box near the southern wall. Walk due east from
there and you will pass between two rows of pillars and come to a Dog (2) in
the southeast corner of the level. Head through the pair of pillars just to the
northwest of the Dog&apos;s (2) location and then go north. You will come to a
Soldier (5).

3. Walk west across one bed of spikes to the next small paved square, then head
due north to find a Teacher (4). Walk west again between a pair of pillars and
onto a large bed of spikes, and then walk north to find a Cheerleader (9) in a
large clear area. Head west, and turn to go northwest as you pass a solitary
pillar to the north; you will collect first a Cheerleader (7) then, if you
continue northwest, a Baby (10). Head east from the Baby to find a Pandora&apos;s
Box in the middle of a bed of spikes, then walk west for a while to find a
Teacher (A) in the northwest corner of the map. Exit immediately.

WALKTHROUGH (You can&apos;t or won&apos;t use a potion):

NOTES ON THIS METHOD:

This level is difficult enough to play through without losing Victims (and
health!), but it&apos;s even more difficult to write a detailed walkthrough for. As
with level 11, there aren&apos;t any distinct landmarks anywhere on the map and so
I&apos;ve had to concentrate on the minutiae in assembling the instructions. The
route described within is one which I think gives you as good a chance as
you&apos;ll get of saving all of the Victims, and minimises the amount of time you
have to spend getting beaten up by Werewolves and walking over spikes. Some
aspects of the description of the route are in shorthand, as describing the
same things repeatedly would greatly increase the number of paragraphs, and
make the walkthrough rather hard to use. Please note the following:

DIRECTIONS AND USE OF THE WALKTHROUGH:

- As referred to in the walkthrough, a&quot;rest&quot;is one of the paved areas which
 has no spikes on it. When on a&quot;rest&quot;, you can stop indefinitely, although
 you may still be attacked by Werewolves.
-&quot;Separated&quot;beds of spikes are those with a rest in between.
-&quot;Adjacent&quot;beds of spikes are distinct beds (i.e. they rise and sink at
 different times), but they are not&quot;separated&quot;(i.e. they&apos;re right next to
 each other, with no&quot;rest&quot;in between).
- When I instruct you to walk across a bed of spikes, what I mean is for you to
 do so after waiting for them to first rise, then sink. This ensures that you
 have the maximum amount of time to traverse them before they rise up again
 and hurt you.
- However, if I direct you to walk over multiple groupings of spikes in the
 same instruction, I mean you to keep walking continuously after you have
 begun.
- On occasions when you have to walk across spikes no matter what their status
 (i.e. in order to reach a Victim quickly), this will be clearly stated in the
 walkthrough.

TECHNIQUE AND PLAYING STYLE:

- The Tourist Couple (6), which is to your southeast as you begin, should be
 saved first. Check the&quot;Tourist-Werewolves&quot;section of the walkthrough,
 below, to benefit from exact directions.
- As the Werewolves often jump over to a Victim you&apos;re approaching and attack
 them, you should be prepared to slay them from a distance. If you have any
 Pandora&apos;s Boxes with you - and you will have a couple by the time the level
 finishes, at least - then you ought to keep them ready for instant use.
- The Werewolves will frequently attack you as well, and you can&apos;t just run
 away across the spikes - so, you need to defend yourself. If you have no
 Silverware, switch to the Weedkiller and when they approach up close, mow
 them down (literally). I advise you not to allow a following of Werewolves to
 build up, chasing you around the level; this is bad for the Victims, and also
 for you. Kill them quickly when they approach, and move on.
- You should keep an eye on your health, because it could get hammered down
 very rapidly - particularly if you get overwhelmed by the Werewolves.
- Much of what this level throws at you is random (which is what makes it
 exceptionally difficult to write for!), and as a consequence I can&apos;t
 anticipate everything that will happen, and write about it. If it seems
 sensible for you to take a detour, or to stay in one place for a moment to
 kill a crowd of Werewolves you&apos;ve gathered around you, then do so.
- Whenever you read from the walkthrough, or check what it says, or even just
 think what to do next, pause the game - the less time your character spends
 waiting around, the less time there is for Werewolves to come and attack you,
 and for other things to go wrong. During the time that you&apos;re actually
 playing the game, you need to be moving as fast as you (safely) can.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

As you wait to begin, press on the down-arrow on the control pad, so that you
start to move south as soon as possible. You will walk off the rest on which
you start and across a sunken bed of spikes, over to a pillar at the southern
end of another rest. Walk east across a bed of spikes, and rescue the Tourists
(6). Once you have them, switch your weapon to either the Silverware or, if you
have none, the Weedkiller; also, switch your special item to the Pandora&apos;s
Boxes.

NEIGHBOURS:

1. Walk north across two separated beds of spikes. Walk to the northeast corner
of the rest on which you arrive. Walk east across one bed of spikes and keep
south at the far end, in order to pass just to the north of a pillar and avoid
a strip of three spikes. Head east across another bed of spikes and slip past
the next pillar in the same way. You find a Teacher (4). Walk north across
three separated strips of spikes. Past the last one, go northwest to save a
Cheerleader (9).

2. Stand roughly in the northwest corner of this rest, and pause the game. What
needs to be done next requires a thorough explanation, as it is the best way of
saving the next two Victims (7 and 10) but is quite complicated. If you look
due west of where you are standing, you will see two beds of spikes. You are
going to walk west once the nearest bed sinks; but you can only do that if the
next bed after it has just sunk, a quarter of a second earlier. This is the
case once every two times the nearest bed sinks, due to the cycling system of
rising and falling that the spikes follow.

3. Unpause the game and wait there, killing any Werewolves that appear. Once
the spikes to your west sink in the way you want them to - almost together -
head west promptly, over first a large bed of spikes, then a rest; then a small
bed of spikes, then another rest; then onto another small bed of spikes. At
roughly this point, the spikes to the north of your current location will sink.
Walk north and then west to save a Cheerleader (7). Now, walk northwest across
the spikes - even if they are raised - in order to save a Baby (10).

4. Walk due east across a large bed of spikes to find a Pandora&apos;s Box. Head
south off the spikes, onto a rest, and over to the southern end of it. Walk
across two separated beds of spikes to the west, to reach another rest. Head to
the northwest corner. Wait for any Werewolves that are chasing you to arrive,
and kill them when they do. Once the spikes to your west sink, immediately walk
west and you will come to a rest. Don&apos;t stop, but turn to head northwest. At
the end of the rest, continue northwest across a small bed of spikes (which
should be sunk when you come to them), and you will reach a Teacher (A) on
another rest next to the wall.

5. Head southeast onto a rest, and continue over to its southeast corner. Walk
south across a couple of separated beds of spikes, followed by a series of
adjacent beds. You will arrive at a large rest with a Cheerleader (8) on it.
(You should hopefully be hurt by the spikes only once while crossing them.)
Continue south across a bed of spikes and you will arrive on a rest northeast
of a group of pillars. Kill any Werewolves that are chasing you at this point.

6. Head into the southeast corner of the rest. Walk south across two separated
strips of spikes. You may find the second strip raised when you get to it; walk
across it anyway. Once past the two strips, quickly go west, skirting around
the north side of the pillar as you did the two pillars earlier, for an
Explorer (3). Walk east past the pillar again, and then wait for the strip of
spikes to your south, and the spike bed south of that, to rise and fall. When
they have done so, walk south until you are right up against the wall. Head
east here (you&apos;re standing on a thin, obscured path next to the wall that has
no spikes on), and once you reach the rest with the Pandora&apos;s Box on it, step
away from the wall and collect it.

7. Walk east across a bed of spikes and onto a rest. Wait in the northeast
corner of that rest for the long line of spikes to your east to rise, then
sink. When it does, walk east across it and continue once you are past it. You
will cross another sunken bed of spikes and reach a Dog (2). From him, head
north between the two nearest pillars, and across a long bed of spikes to the
north, to find a Soldier (5) on a small rest. Exit straight away.

43) LEVEL 43: SUPER FUND CLEANUP SITE srch343

-----

DIFFICULTY: 5/10

There are a few Victims in danger from the Squidmen, but beyond that, this
level will not challenge you too much. It&apos;s a poisoned marshland with a large
lake on the east side, and vivid green water channels and ponds all over the
place. You can pick up two Ghost Potions here, and I recommend using one of
them straight away to collect Victims 2, A and 10, as described in the
walkthrough.

MONSTER LIST: Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: two places)
 Pod Plant (one)
 Squidmen (intensity: ranges from high to very high, location:
 nearly everywhere)
 Zombies [Vicious] (intensity: high, location: two places)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Swimming Pool Guy - In the southeast corner of the map, just by a strip of
 land protruding into the poisoned lake.
 2) Tourists - On a little island in the middle of the poisoned lake, northeast
 of the centre of the level.
 3) Explorer - On the northern side of the level, by some waste drums, just
 south of the walled-in area that contains two Ghost Potions.
 4) Swimming Pool Guy - North and a little east of where you start, most easily
 saved by jumping north twice on the nearby trampolines.
 5) Teacher - On the western side of the pond holding the Swimming Pool Guy
 (4), north of your start point.
 6) Baby - Also on the western side of the pond holding the Swimming Pool Guy
 (4), slightly north of the Teacher (5).
 7) Explorer - At the end of a peninsula pointing into the lake, roughly in the
 centre of the level, south of the Tourists (2) on the island.
 8) Dog - East of where you start, on a small peninsula protruding into a large
 pond, southwest of a patch of weeds.
 9) Teacher - In the house to the south of your start point.
10) Explorer - Near the Swimming Pool Guy (A) in the southeast corner of the
 map, standing at the end of the narrow strip of land to his east.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Decoy Clowns
 Two Ghost Potions

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: The area where Vicious Zombies spawn, around
the gravestones over on the eastern side of the level. No Squidmen appear
around here, and you can score points pretty quickly and with a minimum of
fuss.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Walk south into a building and head west to find a Cupboard. Head south
through the next door into a room containing a Teacher (9) and in the northeast
corner, a Water Pistol and Decoy Clowns. Return north through the two doors and
head northeast over to a trampoline. Jump onto it and continue by jumping north
straight away onto another trampoline, and north from that one into the water.
You&apos;ll land directly on top of a Swimming Pool Guy (4), which (unless you&apos;re
very unlucky) allows you to save him from any Squidmen that have appeared
before they get near him. (Whether he&apos;s still in good shape after you landed on
him at high velocity is another matter - but at least he&apos;s alive.)

2. Jump out of the water onto the north bank and walk west around the edge of
the pond. You&apos;ll find a Baby (6) just past the western side, and a Teacher (5)
to his south. Walk east around the southern bank of the pond, and jump onto the
trampoline; jump south twice and you&apos;ll arrive back where you started (but four
Victims the richer). Dive into the unhealthy-looking stream to your southeast
and then jump out on the western side, south of the fence. Head south here to
get some Weedkiller.

3. Head north again, and return to the northern side of the fence by jumping
into the water and swimming to the northern bank again. Jump onto the
trampoline to the northwest (again), and this time jump off it to the
northeast. Head north around the little puddle and walk east, over a tarmac
surface, to the western edge of a large green lake. Dive in and swim east over
to another muddy bank. Jump out and then walk south along the edge of the
water, past a patch of weeds, to find a Dog (8) on a small peninsula.

4. Switch to your Weedkiller. Head north past some barrels of waste, then turn
to walk northeast through the weeds. When you come to the Pod Plant, sweep him
up to find a Key underneath. Walk east from the weed patch, and south a little
when you arrive at the edge of the water. Continue east past a couple of
clusters of toxic waste barrels, and you&apos;ll come to an Explorer (7) in the
southeast corner of a large peninsula with a puddle in the middle. The route
outlined in paragraph 5 is quite a roundabout one, but it&apos;s designed to
maximise your chances of saving the remaining four Victims, so follow it to the
letter and you shouldn&apos;t go far wrong.

5. Switch to your Water Pistol. Jump into the water just east of where the
Explorer (7) stood, and swim northeast over to another piece of land. Walk
northeast once on the land, past a line of gravestones, and over to the wall on
the eastern side of the map. Walk north here to arrive by a longer line of
gravestones at the northeast corner; head west from there to rejoin the
perimeter wall, and follow it until you come to a protruding section of wall.
Head southwest here and quickly collect the Explorer (3) by the waste drums.

6. Switch to your Bazookas and blast down the slightly damaged section of
fencing to the northeast; walk through and head west to pick up two Ghost
Potions. Drink one of them and then pause the game. You are going to save the
last three Victims while in ghost form, so make sure to not waste time, and to
pause whenever you&apos;re reading instructions, as you don&apos;t want your time to run
out before you&apos;re done. Head southeast, out of the walled-off area, past the
waste drums and over the water, to find Tourists (2) standing on an island.

7. Walk east, past the end of the island, and continue due east across the
water. When you arrive on the bank of another piece of land, head south away
from the toxic waste drums, southeast around a couple of gravestones and then
walk south to reach a Swimming Pool Guy (A) floating just off a narrow strip of
land. Once you have him, waste no time in walking onto the strip of land to the
east, and saving the Explorer (10) who&apos;s standing there. You can choose to
leave now, or stay to earn an Extra Bonus Victim (or two) by going after the
Zombies to the north. This is the last level in the game, by the way, in which
you can earn an Extra Bonus Victim through easy Zombie-shooting, so maybe you
should take advantage of the opportunity.

44) LEVEL 44: THE CURSE OF DR. TONGUE srch344

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10

This level is fairly large and complicated in its layout, but it&apos;s not actually
all that hard. You will have to fight a Frankenstein&apos;s Monster, and if you have
six or more Victims you will be forced to fight a Vampire as well, but they are
not too difficult to do away with if you use the right tactics (even if you
started on level 41). None of the Victims are in very great danger.

MONSTER LIST: Doppelgangers [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from very
 low to medium, location: patchy)
 Frankenstein&apos;s Monster (one)
 Mummies (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Pod Plants (six)
 Squidmen (intensity: ranges from low to medium, location: a few
 places)
 Vampire (one)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - Locked safely in a cell behind a Skull Door, on the northern
 edge of the level. You&apos;ll need to find the Skeleton Key to get in.
 2) Tourists - On a balcony overlooking the water channel on the west side of
 the level. You need to get out at the northeast corner of the pond at the
 northern end of the channel, and then walk south down a hidden passageway.
 3) Cheerleader - On the bank beside an ornamental pond. She can be found by
 heading north through two tunnels from your start location, then swimming
 east across the water.
 4) Dog - In a walled-off yard, north of the grassy bank at the southeast
 corner of the level.
 5) Baby - On a raised dais west of a water channel, near the southeast corner
 of the map.
 6) Teacher - Standing on a balcony overlooking a grassy yard, near the
 northeast corner of the level. You will need to use a hidden passage south
 out of the laboratory to reach the yard.
 7) Explorer - At the end of a cul-de-sac, accessed via an opening on the
 western side of the water channel on the west side of the level.
 8) Baby - On the bank to the northwest of the large ornamental pond in the
 northwest corner of the level.
 9) Swimming Pool Guy - In a pool at the southern end of the longest water
 channel, roughly in the centre of the level. This also puts him south of
 the Cheerleader (3), through a tunnel.
10) Teacher - On the west bank, at the northern end of the water channel on the
 eastern side of the level. Also accessible by heading south along the
 hidden tunnel, from the western end of the laboratory in the northeast
 corner of the level.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Three Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 Bazookas
 First Aid Kit
 Skeleton Key (which you will use)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Weed Cutting Bonus - 1000 points (does not require Pod
 Plants to die)

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Although there are quite a few diverse&quot;one-off&quot;ways of earning points on this level, there&apos;s not much to keep you
here after you&apos;ve exhausted them all. If you absolutely must have an Extra
Bonus Victim, then go and beat up Squidmen, in the southeast corner of the
level. The time will not pass very quickly, and of course they aren&apos;t the
easiest of creatures to fight.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Head into the tunnel to the northwest. Once inside, head north through the
tunnel, across a small yard, into another tunnel, and out the other end. To
your east now is a pool of water. Jump into it, and swim along to the east
bank, then jump out quickly and collect the Cheerleader (3) who&apos;s standing
there. Walk south, and into another tunnel - marked by air holes in the ceiling
- and you will emerge by another pool, which contains a Swimming Pool Guy (9).
If there is a Squidman following you at this point, then it would be a good
idea to turn around and shoot him to death. That done, jump in and swim over to
the Swimming Pool Guy (9). Having collected him, swim over to the west bank and
jump out, and collect the Weedkiller.

2. If you have a lot of Soda Cans (more than fifty), you could use them to kill
the Pod Plant in the enclosure to the west. Stand in the northwest corner of
your current area and throw the cans over the wall - it takes five cans to kill
a Pod Plant this way, assuming they all hit. Tomatoes and Ice Lollies will also
work, though not as quickly; they must also be aimed more precisely. Once
you&apos;re done here, head north into the tunnel through which you entered. At the
other end of the tunnel, dive into the water to the west, and swim northwest
over to the opposite side of the pool.

3. Switch to your Water Pistol. Continue north along the western side of the
level; you will walk through two more covered tunnels, and after the second you
will emerge on a grassy bank with a large ornamental pond to the east. Head
northeast along the bank to collect a Baby (8). Fire your Water Pistol vaguely
in the Baby&apos;s direction as you go, because if a Squidman has jumped out of the
water in order to attack the Baby (8), the shots may strike it and discourage
it from staying out of the water. Once the Baby is safe (or dead), go through
the door to the north. Walk along to the eastern end of the cell inside to find
a Bonus Points Pickup and a Pandora&apos;s Box.

4. Return to the western end of the cell and head south out the door, then jump
into the water to the east and swim across to the northeast corner of the pond.
Jump out onto the steps and then walk northeast, pushing into the northeast
corner of the little platform. Walk southeast from there and you will enter a
hidden passage; continue south along it. You will pass a Tourist Couple (2) to
the west. Once you stop moving south, head west to emerge on the balcony, and
walk north to collect the Tourists (2). Walk southeast, pushing into the wall,
and you will enter the passage again; walk north up to the other end and you
will find yourself back on the platform to the northeast of the ornamental
pond.

5. Dive into the water to the southwest, and swim southwest to find a broad
water channel leading south out of the pond. (Swim into the channel from its
north, as there are barriers preventing access from the side.) A little way
along it is an entrance to the west; jump out here and head south along the
passage to find an Explorer (7) along with a few Bonus Points Pickups. If you
want to, you can kill the Pod Plant to the west, as with the one you
encountered earlier. Return north and jump into the channel to the east, then
swim south down it to the end. Jump out onto the grassy platform and then head
east and dive into another water channel heading south.

6. Swim south and you will find a niche to the west, holding a Pandora&apos;s Box.
Collect that, then dive into the channel again and jump out on the eastern
side. Walk southeast (you will probably need to start using the Weedkiller
here) and into a hidden tunnel heading south. Once out the other side, continue
south to where the path widens out. There is a third Pod Plant on the other
side of the wall to the west, so kill it with your Soda Cans if you want and
then head east alongside the wall to the north. Past the end of the wall, head
north up the steps and collect the Baby (5) which is tottering around on the
raised platform. A fourth Pod Plant is situated on the other side of the
balcony on the west side of the dais, so kill it if you must.

7. Head south down the stairs and jump into the water to the east. Swim south
to the southern wall of the level, then jump out of the water to the east.
Collect two Bonus Points Pickups and then sweep east through the weeds that
have doubtless established themselves here. Once you come to the tunnel to the
north, go through and collect the Dog (4) at the northern end of the yard
inside. Walk back over to the southern end of the yard, and south out through
the tunnel.

8. Walk west and dive into the pool to the north. Swim north and jump out onto
the bank to the east. Head north into a tunnel, and out the other side, you
will find a small yard where Doppelgangers spawn. (There is another Pod Plant
over the wall to the west, so kill it if you want. This is the last one you
need to use Soda Cans to kill.) Continue north through a second tunnel and out
the other side, then walk west and jump into another pool of water. Swim over
to the western side from where you entered, and head to the western end of the
little yard in which you arrive to find Bonus Points Pickups.

9. Return east over to the edge of the water, jump in and swim northwest, and
hop out at the northwest bank. Collect a Teacher (10) and then head northeast
and into the tunnel that is further to the north. At the far end of the tunnel
you will emerge near Frankenstein&apos;s Monster, who will promptly come alive; walk
over to him - but no further east, in case the Vampire comes after you - and
kill him using either the Ancient Artefacts or Weedkiller. (Don&apos;t let your
Ancient Artefacts fall below sixty if you can avoid it.) If you don&apos;t have
enough of either weapon, then try freezing him using a long blast of your Fire
Extinguisher, then firing your Water Pistol at him - your shots will appear to
go right through him, as with the Crazy Lumberjacks, but they are hurting him.

10. Once Frankenstein&apos;s Monster is dead, you can walk east to cause the Vampire
to attack. However, if you have less than six Victims, you have the option of
avoiding an encounter with him altogether; this would allow you to preserve
some firepower for use on later levels, although it also means you can&apos;t
collect a Pandora&apos;s Box here (as it&apos;s very near to the Vampire&apos;s location). If
you aren&apos;t going to fight the Vampire, then check the nearest Curtain, to the
north of Frankie&apos;s charging electrodes, and then skip past paragraphs 11 and
12; if you will fight him, then walk east now.

11. You should move back to the western end of the laboratory once you have
gained the Vampire&apos;s attention, because otherwise, you will be continually
annoyed by Vicious Doppelgangers coming out of a passage to the south. While
fighting the Vampire, the order of preference for weapons should again be
Ancient Artefacts, followed by Weedkiller; if you have less than about eighty
Artefacts left at this time, you should choose the Weedkiller instead. (Do not
use your Fire Extinguisher on the Vampire, as he does not take damage from the
Weedkiller while frozen.)

12. If you don&apos;t have enough of either, you should use some of the Plates which
you collected on level 41 instead, as it only takes about twenty-five of those
to finish him off if you&apos;re careful with them. Remember to only fire at him
when he&apos;s in humanoid form, and not moving. Once he is dead, walk over to the
equipment in the centre of the lab.

13. South of the bubbling immersion tank, and a little east, is a tunnel in the
wall (revealed by the air holes in the ceiling). Walk south into it, and once
out the other side, head southwest over to some steps heading north. Walk up
them, open a Chest at the top, and collect a Teacher (6). Return south down the
stairs, northeast over to the tunnel, and north through the tunnel to the
laboratory. Head into the southeast corner of the lab to find a Pandora&apos;s Box,
and then walk up to the northern wall. In the northeast corner is a Chest, and
along the rest of the wall as you go west are three Curtains.

14. Walk into the southwest corner of the laboratory and then walk northwest,
pressing into the wall; you will enter a hidden passage. Walk south along this
passage and you will come out into a tiny little enclosure containing a
Skeleton Key. (You will probably find that you have to use the Weedkiller in
order to collect the Key without taking damage.) Walk north back into the
tunnel, and when you stop moving north, head east to arrive back in the lab.
Walk to the southwest corner of the room again, and this time push southeast
into the wall to enter the passageway through which you originally accessed the
lab.

15. Go south all the way to the end of the tunnel, and continue south once out
of it, past the corner in the wall to the west. Walk north into the other
tunnel to the west, and head northwest once out the other side. Kill the Pod
Plant in the middle of the yard using Weedkiller, or if you&apos;ve none left, Soda
Cans. Once it&apos;s dead, you can collect the Bazooka pickup it was sitting on, and
continue northwest over to a flight of stairs. Go up the stairs and through the
Skull Door. Collect the First Aid Kit and the Cheerleader (A) inside, open the
Chest against the northern wall, and then exit the level.

45) LEVEL 45: DANGER IN PICNIC PARK srch345

-----

DIFFICULTY: 7/10

Overrun by the Red Ants, this park is no longer anything like a suitable venue
for picnics. You encountered the Red Ants on level 32, but not in very great
numbers; here, they&apos;re everywhere. They move as fast as you do, so it&apos;s
impossible to outrun them if they come after you, and if you haven&apos;t got the
Martian Bubble Gun, they take a Bazooka shot each to kill. Having to deal with
the delaying effect of the Bazooka recoil will add to the (already
considerable) problems experienced by those who start on this level using a
password (bad idea, by the way, unless you&apos;re a real Zombies ace).

There are a lot of Bazooka pickups on this level, though, along with a large
stash of other useful pickups. The snag is that these items are all hidden
behind the trees, and that if the Ants find them, they&apos;ll drag them away and
destroy them - you&apos;ll have to either chase after the Ant responsible, kill it,
and swiftly pick up the item, or else accept that you&apos;ve lost it. So, it&apos;s like
a kind of high-stakes, time-limited treasure hunt. (Note that I&apos;ll expect you
to have at least sixteen Bazooka shells remaining for the next level, in order
to make use of the walkthrough to level 46 that&apos;s the least demanding in terms
of ammo, and so that you have at least three left on level 47 - try not to use
all of your shells up.)

My walkthrough tells you what I think is the best route through the level, and
you should hopefully find that if you follow it precisely it allows you to
collect a majority of the items each time. Instructions are also given as to
the best way to approach each Victim - but they&apos;re a difficult bunch, as many
of them are very near Ants&apos; nests and will get killed if you do the slightest
thing wrong (or do everything right but are unlucky). While playing through the
level using this walkthrough, you should carry out instructions exactly, and
keep the game paused at all other times. This is a very tough level, and must
be approached with military precision...

MONSTER LIST: Red Ants (intensity: ranges from low to high, location: nearly
 everywhere)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Soldier - In a walled-off garden near the northwest corner of the level.
 You will need to take a roundabout route, using several different passages
 to reach him.
 2) Baby - Next to an Ants&apos; nest, in the northeast corner of the map.
 3) Soldier - Standing next to you where you start, with some Bazookas.
 4) Cheerleader - South of an Ants&apos; nest, in the open area on the northern side
 of the level. Mostly hidden behind a tree, except for when she jumps.
 5) Cheerleader - South of the hedge block containing one of the Extra Lives,
 northeast a little way from where you start. She&apos;s also hidden behind a
 tree while she&apos;s not jumping.
 6) Teacher - North of where you start, in the northwest corner of the main
 area of the park.
 7) Cheerleader - South of the walled-off garden containing the Soldier (A), in
 the maze-like area near the northwest corner of the level. Like the other
 two Cheerleaders (4 and 5), she is hidden behind a tree and can only be
 seen when she jumps.
 8) Dog - In the southeast corner of the level, near the end of the hedge
 separating the main area of the park from the long alleyway along the
 southern edge.
 9) Teacher - Just north of the hedge block containing an Extra Life, in the
 centre-north of the main area of the park.
10) Baby - Safely hidden inside a dead end, to the northeast of the centre of
 the level, near hedge blocks hiding a double-value Bazooka pickup.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS:

EASY (These are hidden in out-of-the-way areas where the Ants are unlikely to
come across them):
 Two double-value Bazooka pickups (one where you start, one
 hidden inside a hedge block north of the main area of
 the park)
 Monster Potion (hidden behind a tree in a walled-off area on
 the eastern side of the level)
 Weedkiller (in the open area on the northern side of the
 level)

HARD (These are hidden behind trees in the main area of the park, giving cause
for concern, as the Ants may find them and carry them away):
 Five more (single-value) Bazooka pickups
 Two Extra Lives
 Two First Aid Kits
 Another Monster Potion
 Ancient Artefacts
 Two Mystery Potions
 Water Pistol (no, really, this is useful for level 48)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Wander around the main area of the park and
take on the Ants. This is the last outing for your Martian Bubble Gun, so use
it all up. If you have absolutely stacks of Bazooka shells then you could use
some of them as well, but save a nice lot of shells for the upcoming levels (if
possible, don&apos;t let your Bazooka ammo fall below 75 shells). You can&apos;t earn the
Extermination Bonus as you could on levels 16 and 32 - disappointing, as it&apos;s
the last level featuring the Ants.

-----

WALKTHROUGH:

1. Collect the Soldier (3) and the double-value Bazooka pickup to your west.
Blast through the weak spot in the hedge to the north, which is furthest west -
the one without a tree behind it. At this point, switch to the Martian Bubble
Gun if you have any. Walk north through the hole you made, and continue north
through the trees - you will probably have to kill a Red Ant as you go - and
over to the northwest corner in the wall to find a Teacher (6). If you see an
Ant carrying Bazookas away from behind a tree to your east, try to kill it and
pick up the Bazookas without straying too far from the Teacher (6).

2. Head south again, skirting the wall to your west. When you come to a tree
that is right up against the wall, head east over to an Ants&apos; nest and then
turn to walk south and behind a tree. You should hear a&quot;bleep&quot;noise, which
indicates that you have picked up some more Bazookas. If you don&apos;t, walk around
behind the tree until you do - the Bazookas are near the northern end of the
area hidden by the tree, so move to such a position that all of your character
except his feet are visible, and then move around. If you still can&apos;t find it,
that probably means that an Ant has run away with it.

3. Having gotten the Bazookas (or not), head northeast a few paces (so as to be
on the northern side of the tree that&apos;s to the southeast of the Ants&apos; nest),
and then head due east. You will probably come across an Ant, which suddenly
comes towards you; be ready to kill it, and then continue due east to find a
Cheerleader (5) hidden behind a tree. There&apos;s also a Bonus Points Pickup behind
there. Don&apos;t go too far north at this point, or a Teacher (9) just off the
screen could die. Walk west over to the Ants&apos; nest and then turn to go south,
and you&apos;ll find a Bazooka pickup behind the tree that you come to just past a
protruding hedge. Having got that, return northeast over to the tree where the
Cheerleader was.

4. Blast down the hedge block to the north. Walk in for an Extra Life, continue
walking out the open back end and then head west to get to a Teacher (9) before
an Ant does. You&apos;ll probably meet an Ant approaching the Teacher from the other
direction, in fact, so kill it quickly before going to get the next pickup.
Walk directly south to get a First Aid Kit behind a tree. This item is near the
base of the tree, almost directly next to the hedge. Walk west past the end of
the hedge, and over to the second of the two trees in the row; walk around
behind it to find a Bonus Points Pickup. There&apos;s another one behind the third
tree, to your west.

5. Head northeast from there, past an Ants&apos; nest and a tree, and you will come
to a second tree, behind which (near the base) are a Bazooka pickup and Soda
Cans on the same spot. Head east, past the end of a wall to your south, and
over to the northeast corner of the next area. There is a hidden passageway
through the greenery to your south; walk into it and then east out of it, and
then walk north up the alleyway to find a Baby (10) at the other end. Return
south to the exit of the passageway, and head west into it and then north out
of it. Switch to the Bazookas and blast down the hedge block to the north.

6. Walk into the hole you&apos;ve made and once inside, head west through a
passageway under the ivy and out into a small, walled-in area. Blast down the
next hedge block to the north to reveal a double-value Bazooka pickup. Collect
it and then head southeast again into the passageway and out to the entrance of
it, at the first hedge block. Switch back to your Martian Bubble Gun. You&apos;ll
now be approaching an area that contains four pickups very near to each other,
three of which you particularly need (a second Extra Life, a Monster Potion,
and Ancient Artefacts). You must be careful to allow the Ants to take as few of
them as possible, so be vigilant as you carry out the instructions in
paragraphs 7 and 8, and pause constantly.

7. Head southwest out of the entrance to the hedge block, to arrive north of
some more trees. Head south through them until you see an Ants&apos; nest to your
southeast; walk over to that, killing any Ants which appear, and then walk
directly southeast from it, over to a tree which is south of a broken-down
hedge block. The Extra Life is hidden behind this tree, so if you see any Ants
running away with it, chase after them to get it back.

8. The Monster Potion is behind the next tree to your west. Note that if you
see an Ant carrying it away, it will look like a Ghost Potion (that is, the
liquid inside will be blue rather than pink) but it is still actually a Monster
Potion. Northwest of that tree is another one containing Ancient Artefacts and
a Mystery Potion; they are not on the same spot, so as you search, listen for
two separate bleeps to indicate that you&apos;ve picked them both up.

9. Walk between the two trees to your southwest (the eastern of which hid the
last two pickups), and continue south from there, past an Ants&apos; nest. You might
meet an Ant coming up to meet you as you pass between the trees, so be ready to
blast it and move on. When you arrive at the hedge, search behind the tree
that&apos;s just to the south of the Ants&apos; nest; there&apos;s a second First Aid Kit in
there, near the base of the tree but not quite up against the hedge. Walk
northwest over to another nearby tree after you have the First Aid Kit, and
walk around behind it to find Soda Cans.

10. Walk west past the end of a wall to your north, and southwest from there to
find a Bonus Points Pickup behind the tree next to the hedge, just hidden
behind the very top of the tree. Walk west from there, and when the hedge to
your south moves slightly north, continue west alongside it. At the first tree
you come to, near the base but not directly beside the hedge, you will find a
Bazooka pickup. To your north, just behind the tip of the tree, is a Bonus
Points Pickup. Walk east from there, over to the base of another tree, and
search behind that tree to find a Water Pistol.

11. Walk southeast from there and join the hedge heading east again. After
walking about twenty metres due east, you will pass an Ants&apos; nest to the north,
followed by another, smaller nest to its southeast. Walk behind the next tree
you come to, and search behind it to collect a Bazooka pickup and a Mystery
Potion (they&apos;re not on the same spot, so listen for two separate bleeps).
However, if you see an Ant moving east off the screen to the northeast, retreat
west quickly, as it&apos;s probably going to go and kill the Dog (8) which is over
there. Assuming this does not happen, once you have collected both items, walk
northeast and you&apos;ll find the Dog (8) out in the open, next to the eastern
wall.

12. Head north past a few trees and an Ants&apos; nest and you will come to a hedge
to the north, with one tree on the other side of it. Blast through the weak
spot to the west of the tree and head through, and search behind the tree to
find a Monster Potion. Head out through the hole you made, and go north up the
passageway just to the west. When you come to the corner, head east over to the
end of the hedge. From there, walk north to the other side of the hedge, and
then walk west, skirting the hedge, to reach the southeast corner of your
current area.

13. Wait here to see if any Ants approach you; if they do, kill them without
straying too far from your corner. There is a Baby (2) to your northeast whom
you want to save, and this is aided if there are as few Ants around as
possible. Once everything looks quiet, head north past two trees, and when
alongside a third, turn to walk northeast over to the tree that partially hides
the Baby (2). If you see any Ants on the approach, go after them and kill them
as well.

14. Walk south, to stand next to the base of the tree behind which the Baby (2)
was toddling about. Kill any Ants that appear, and then walk due west, past an
Ants&apos; nest to the north, and a wall and two trees to the south. If you have the
Martian Bubble Gun equipped, then fire it continuously once you have passed the
base of the second tree, until you reach the Weedkiller pickup - this is to
kill an Ant which may spawn at this point and push the Weedkiller over to a
Cheerleader (4), killing her.

15. You will find the Weedkiller pickup south of another Ants&apos; nest, and north
of the tree behind which the Cheerleader (4) is jumping up and down. Kill any
Ants that have appeared at this point - you will be collecting the Cheerleader
in a moment, and you do not want the Ants to follow you over, and get to her
instead. Once there are no Ants in sight, walk south over to the tree and save
the Cheerleader (4).

16. Switch to your Bazookas and blast down the weak section of hedge that&apos;s
just to the southeast of the Cheerleader. Head through, then walk west. Walk
southwest around the bend in the hedge to the north, and west along the
passageway. Where you emerge, you will find a tree with another Cheerleader (7)
behind it; collect her. Quickly head southwest from there over to a green patch
in the western wall; this indicates a hidden passageway. Walk west into the
passageway and then head northwest out of it and into an open area containing
two trees. Behind the western tree, you&apos;ll find a Bonus Points Pickup.

17. Head southwest away from the tree and into an ivy-covered passageway in the
southwest corner of the small garden. Head east out of the passageway, and then
walk due south to enter another area covered by greenery, in which 2000 points&apos;
worth of Bonus Points Pickups can be collected. Walk due north out of there and
west through the first green area you arrive by. Now head north up the alleyway
to a corner. If an Ant appears in the walled garden to the southeast, wait
until it either climbs over the wall to get to you, or disappears. When all is
well, continue east, and when you arrive in the little walled-in area, head
southeast over to the opposite corner. You&apos;ll find a Soldier (A) there; collect
him and then leave.

46) A SHOCKING SEQUEL TO LEVEL 34: LEVEL 46: DAY OF THE LUMBERJACK srch346

(U.S.&quot;A SHOCKING SEQUEL TO LEVEL 34: LEVEL 46: DAY OF THE CHAINSAW&quot;)

-----

DIFFICULTY: 3/10 to 7/10

1. This level is set in the same type of environment as level 4, and its
structure is essentially the same - there are several Lumberjacks dotted around
a map covered with a mass of hedges, and you have to evade them for long enough
to find the Victims and leave. However, where it differs from level 4 is in the
way the hedges are arranged; in level 4 you were running around a maze -
confusing at times, but navigable. Here, you are faced with a hedge-maze which
is overgrown so that there are no easy routes around the place; just long lines
of hedges, crossing each other, which you must force your way through.

2. This factor makes the level very difficult for those who don&apos;t have the
necessary Bazooka ammo to make their own way through, as they&apos;ll have to get
the Lumberjacks to cut down hedges in order to get through - never an easy
task, and especially difficult to do while avoiding taking too much of a
hammering, and also collecting all the Victims. As on level 4 (and level 34),
it&apos;s also considerably more difficult to get through if you don&apos;t have the
weapons necessary to kill the Lumberjacks, and must just run away; where is
there to run? Not many places...

3. The best way to approach the level if you&apos;ve been playing for ages, from
nearly the start of the game, is to keep swigging Monster Potion and just
bashing the Lumberjacks to death as you find them. This method should only be
used if you have nine or more Monster Potions at the start of the level,
because you&apos;re going to need a lot of them on level 48. The first walkthrough
describes the best route to take if you do this; make sure to follow it
efficiently and pause whenever reading it, so that you do not waste your time
as a Purple Monster.

4. If you aren&apos;t so well-stocked-up on Monster Potions, but can still get rid
of the Lumberjacks using weapons such as the Ancient Artefacts, or even the old
Fire Extinguisher / Water Pistol trick (see the preamble to level 4), then
follow the second walkthrough. If you just don&apos;t have the supplies necessary to
kill all the Lumberjacks, and yet still have a good amount of items left to use
on the next level and level 48, then you are going to have to use the third
walkthrough. This provides a method of clearing the level, dodging around and
running away from every Lumberjack you meet.

5. This last walkthrough is the largest of the lot, weighing in at 22
paragraphs, because it&apos;s very complicated to describe the best way of getting
through. It&apos;s also difficult to complete the level simply by doing as it says,
because it&apos;s so tough to get past the Lumberjacks every time you encounter
them. However, if it&apos;s the only choice you have, you should use it, and
exercise all your speed and skill to get through without losing too much
health. Pause regularly in order to read the instructions properly, and don&apos;t
waste time, or they&apos;ll catch you...

MONSTER LIST: Jelly Blobs (intensity: medium, location: one place)
 Lumberjacks (seven)
 Pod Plant (one)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - Safe inside a cell, locked behind a pair of Skull Doors, in
 the southeast corner of the level. You will need to find the two Skeleton
 Keys hidden around the level to get in.
 2) Baby - Inside a walled-in alleyway in the southwest corner of the level.
 You will need to clear away a couple of hedges to get in.
 3) Baby - Safely held at the western end of the passageway, between the two
 Skull Doors that bar access to the Cheerleader (A).
 4) Tourists - In a grassy yard in the northwest corner of the map.
 5) Explorer - At the southern edge of the level, blocked into a small
 enclosure by hedges.
 6) Explorer - In a tiny cell formed by hedges, near the east side of the
 level.
 7) Soldier - South a little from where you start, past a few hedgerows and a
 Lumberjack.
 8) Teacher - Just northwest of your start location, past a hedge; up against
 the northern wall, near the northeast corner of the map.
 9) Explorer - Inside a hedge block on the southern side of the level, roughly
 in between the other two Explorers (5 and 6).
10) Tourists - At the end of a short cul-de-sac, formed by indestructible
 walls, to the southwest of the Skull Door cells. You&apos;ll need to blast
 through the hedges to their west to get in.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: A double-value Bazooka pickup
 Two single-value Bazooka pickups
 Monster Potion

BONUSES AVAILABLE: Victim collection bonuses
 Massive Destruction - 2000 points
 No Bazooka Fired Bonus - 1000 points
 Axeman Begone Bonus - 5000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Once you&apos;ve earned all the bonuses and cut
the Lumberjacks down to size, there are no other sources of points - well,
except for the Jelly Blobs that spawn to the south of your start location. As
trying to earn points there is clearly not even worth considering, just exit
and put the points you earned on this level, towards an Extra Bonus Victim on
the next level (as it&apos;s similarly limited from a points-scoring point of view).

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You want to use up your Monster Potions):

1. Walk into the northeast corner of the area where you start and then drink a
Monster Potion. Don&apos;t be too slow switching to your Monster Potions, because a
Jelly Blob will probably spawn to the south and start launching Jelly Bombs at
you. Note that for the purposes of this walkthrough, whenever you return to
human form, you should stay that way until you need to knock down another hedge
or fight a Lumberjack; at which point you should drink another Monster Potion.
I will advise you when not to do so any more.

2. Punch through the weak section to your north, then punch in the entrance to
the hedge block, and you will find a double-value Bazooka pickup inside. Come
out of there and then punch through the hedge to the northwest. Go through and
walk west, past the end of the hedge, to find a Teacher (8). Punch through the
hedge to her west, head west past a protruding wall, and then punch down
another hedge to the west.

3. Punch down a hedge to the south, and then another one southwest of that.
Punch down the entrance to the hedge block to the west and go in to get a
Skeleton Key. You can kill the Lumberjack who&apos;s hiding in there, if you want,
too. Head out, and south down the western fork in the path. At the far end,
you&apos;ll find that you&apos;ve attracted the attention of another Lumberjack, past a
couple of hedges to the south. If you want to fight him, then wait for him to
get through the hedges - move around a little if he seems reluctant - and kill
him without going any further south (as there is another Lumberjack to the
southeast whose attention you don&apos;t want yet).

4. When you&apos;re finished with the second Lumberjack, walk west into the
ivy-covered passage, and once out the other side of that, walk northwest
through another one to find a Bazooka pickup in a little cell made out of
hedges. Knock down the two hedges to the north, and then head west and go
through three more hedges as you go south. You&apos;ll meet a Lumberjack as you go
south; kill him if you want. Past the third hedge heading south, you arrive in
a small square pen. Punch down the hedge in the northwest corner to arrive in
another, identical square. Knock down the northwest corner of this one to
arrive in a little yard in the northwest corner of the level, with Tourists (4)
standing against the northern wall.

5. Return southeast through the two gaps and then head over to the southern
edge of the first square pen. Punch down two hedges and then a fence as you
head south, and you will find a Skeleton Key at the end of an alleyway. Return
north through the fence and one hedge, and then head east to the end of the
cell and punch through a hedge to the south. Continue south, knocking down two
more hedges, and then head southeast a little to punch through the weak section
in a fence. Walk over to the Pod Plant and punch it to death; you can then pick
up the Monster Potion it was sitting on. (If you don&apos;t see any Monster Potion
there, it&apos;s because you inadvertently picked it up when you were fighting the
Pod Plant.)

6. Walk west into the covered passageway, and north out of it. Punch through a
weak hedge section to the west, and having gone through, punch through another
one to the north, then a door. Collect the Soda Cans inside the room, and then
head south out of it again (ignore the Cupboard, as you cannot open it normally
in Purple Monster form, and it will not contain anything if you punch it open).
Back in the long, narrow passageway south, punch through the weak hedge section
to the west, and then through another to the south. At the southern end of the
area you have opened up is a Baby (2).

7. Return north through one hole in the hedge, and then east through two more.
Head southeast through the covered passageway and then once out the other side,
walk to the northeast corner of the weed-strewn area. Head south, punching
through two hedges as you go, to get to an Explorer (5) who&apos;s in a walled-in
area at the southern edge of the map. Head north through the hole you just made
in the hedge, punch east through another weak section, and then punch down the
entrance to the hedge block just to the east to access the Explorer (9) who&apos;s
inside. Head southeast through the hedge to get to a fourth Lumberjack. You can
kill him, or just carry on as if he wasn&apos;t there - it&apos;s up to you.

8. Go north through a hedge, walk east and then knock down the next two weak
hedge sections to the south. Go along to the eastern end of the walled-in
passageway on the other side to find Tourists (10). Go back to the western end
of the passage, and head north again through the last two hedges you damaged.
Break through the hedge to the northwest, and then continue north through
another hedge to find an Explorer (6) in a tiny little cell.

9. Punch through the next two hedges to your north and you&apos;ll find that you
attract the attention of two Lumberjacks at once (if you ignored the second
Lumberjack you encountered, then he&apos;ll be present to the northwest as well). If
you want to kill both of the Lumberjacks (or even all three), then go ahead and
fight them. When you&apos;re done, head through the hole in the hedge to the east
(made by one of the Lumberjacks), then walk to the northeast corner of the cell
you are in and break down the weak point in the hedge to the north. Continue
northeast and destroy another hedge, and you can step through to the Jelly Blob
area, near where you started.

10. At this point, I don&apos;t recommend drinking any more Monster Potions; you&apos;re
nearly at the end of the level, and you can rely on Bazookas and Lumberjacks to
break through the remaining few hedges. You might decide to drink another if
you really want the No Bazooka Fired Bonus, or you don&apos;t want to use
conventional weapons (i.e. Ancient Artefacts) to defeat the Lumberjacks. Head
to the southeast corner of the Jelly Blob area, past the meteorite, and punch
down two hedges to the south. You come across the final Lumberjack at this
point; whether you fight him or ignore him is up to you. Punch south through
another hedge to get to a Soldier (7).

11. Go south from the Soldier (7) into a covered passageway, and head east out
of it. Collect the Bazookas to the north and then head south, punching through
the three hedges you encounter on the way. You arrive at the southeast corner
of the level; head northwest over to the first Skull Door. If you&apos;re still in
Purple Monster form, wait until you return to human shape. Go through the first
Skull Door and walk over to the western side of the cell to collect a Baby (3),
and then head north again through the second Skull Door to find a Cheerleader
(A). Exit straight away, as there are no more opportunities to score points if
you have killed all the Lumberjacks. (You should find that you have earned the
Massive Destruction bonus already.)

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You have suitable weapons for killing the Lumberjacks):

1. Head over to the northeast corner of the area in which you start, and fire
two Bazooka shells north at the last weak section in the hedge. This will open
up the hedge block to the north; walk in and collect a double-value Bazooka
pickup. Head out of there and blast down the hedge to the west. Head through
the gap and walk west to find a Teacher (8). Walk south, then west into the
hidden passageway in the southwest corner. Head north out of there, and west
around the wall to come to a dead end.

2. Blast through the hedge to the west, head through the hole, blast through
the next hedge to the south, and head southwest through there. Blast through
the weak point at the southwest corner of the little cell of hedges you are in.
Blast through the front of the hedge block to the west, then switch to your
Ancient Artefacts and kill the Lumberjack bumbling around inside. Pick up the
Skeleton Key sitting inside, and then head south out of the hedge block, and
continue south down the western fork in the path, to the end.

3. As you reach the end of the passageway, a Lumberjack to the south will take
note of your presence and carve his way through the intervening hedges to get
to you. (If he does not start cutting down the hedges straight away, try moving
around a little, as that might make him hurry up.) When he is through to you,
use your Ancient Artefacts to kill him as you did the other one. Walk south
through the two hedges he destroyed, and another Lumberjack to your southeast
will notice you and start approaching. This Lumberjack may take either of two
possible routes through to attack you, but he&apos;ll get through to you whichever
he uses. When he does, kill him.

4. Use whichever route is open to get into the comparatively large yard to the
southeast. Once you are inside, a fourth Lumberjack, to the east, will start
attacking; wait for him to break through the hedge to the east and then kill
him. Stay in the yard where the third Lumberjack started (the large one with
the tree growing by the hedge in the southeast), and blast through the weak
hedge to the south, in the southwest corner. Walk due south through it and over
to the southern end of the next yard to the south; blast down the hedge you
come to there as well and step through. Step east to the end of the passageway
and blast down the hedge to the north, to gain access to an Explorer (6) inside
a tiny little hedge-cell.

5. Blast down the next hedge to the south at this point as well, and then walk
through it; a Lumberjack to your south will notice you, and break through the
remaining hedge that separates you. When he is through, kill him with your
Ancient Artefacts. Switch back to your Bazookas, and head to the eastern end of
the area you are in (or were in, before that Lumberjack started attacking).
Fire two shells south at the weak hedge section in the southeast corner of the
cell, and then walk south through the two holes this makes in the hedges. Head
east along the southern wall to find Tourists (10) standing in a dead end.

6. Return west, and north through two broken hedges, and then walk southwest
into the cell where the Lumberjack was standing. Blast down the hedge to the
west, go through and blast down the front of the hedge block to the north; you
will find an Explorer (9) inside. Blast down the weak hedge section to the
west, go through, and then blast down the one immediately to the south. Head
through the hole you made to get to another Explorer (5), then head north
again, east through the two holes you made previously, and north through two
more. Now continue by walking west, then north at the corner, to reach a
weed-covered area.

7. Switch to your Weedkiller, and sweep west into the weed patch. Go over to
the Pod Plant on the western side, and kill it; pick up the Monster Potion it
was hiding, and then continue west into the ivy-covered passageway. Head north
out of there into a short dead-end passageway. Blast through two hedges to the
west and head through, and then demolish another one to the south once in the
furthest-west aisle, between the hedge and the wall. Head over to the far end
of the passageway to collect a Baby (2). Return north and east to the middle
aisle between the hedges, and blast down the hedge to the north. Go north,
through the door, into a little hut. Pick up the Soda Cans lying by the chair,
and open the Cupboard in the northwest corner.

8. Take the following directions to arrive at the next place you need to visit:
head southeast out of the house, south and east through two hedges, southeast
through a covered passage, northeast over to the corner of the weed-covered
yard, southeast until you pass the end of the red brick wall to your north,
north through two broken hedges spaced far apart, northwest over to the cell
where you met the second Lumberjack, north through broken hedges until you come
alongside a covered passageway, west through that passageway, and northwest
through another into a little cell containing a Bazooka pickup.

9. As you enter the small cell containing the Bazookas, a Lumberjack to the
west will notice you and begin stalking towards you. He will smash through the
hedge to your southwest, thereby letting him through to another small
hedge-cell directly west of yours. Face the hedge to your north, and fire two
Bazooka shells at it; you will blast down the two hedges to the north, allowing
you through.

10. Walk north and out into an open area, and head into the southwest corner of
the area; you should now find that the Lumberjack breaks through the two hedge
sections to your south. If he is not trying to get to you any more, return
south down the line of broken hedges you just came through, to see if you can
get him to start chasing you again. When he has finally finished making his way
through the hedges (or once you&apos;ve blasted them down yourself), you can kill
him.

11. After heading south down the line of hedges that the Lumberjack took care
of, you arrive in a small square pen formed out of hedges. Blast through the
weak hedge section in the northwest corner, and then head through to another
square pen. Blast down the hedge section in the northwest corner of this one as
well, and you can go through to a small yard containing Tourists (4), standing
against the northern wall of the level.

12. Having saved them, head into the southwest corner of the area, and blast
down the hedge to the south. Walk south until you arrive at the northern wall
of the house that you investigated earlier, and then walk east to find a fence
to the south. Blast through the fence, and head south through it into a small,
walled-in alleyway, to find a second Skeleton Key at the far end.

13. Take the following directions to reach your next destination: north through
the fence, west to the edge of the level, and north up to the yard in the
northwest corner, where the Tourists (4) were; southeast through two broken
hedges to the first square pen you arrived in, north through three broken
hedges in the northeast corner, east a little and then south through two broken
hedges, southeast through a covered passageway and over to another one, east
through that; northeast, past an opened-up hedge block to the north and through
three broken hedges; east around the protruding wall, south into a covered
passageway and then northeast out of it and across the yard, south through two
broken-down hedges, and finally southwest and into a wide open yard through a
hole in the fence.

14. Walk southeast over to the meteorite in the corner of the yard, and the
final Lumberjack, to the south, will notice you and carve his way through the
two hedges between you. Kill him once he&apos;s through, but if there are any Jelly
Blobs in the yard with you (very likely), be careful of standing for too long
in one place, as this positively invites Jelly Bombs to land on your head.
(Even if you are using the Ancient Artefacts, Jelly Bombs will still hit you,
and deal three points of damage as usual.)

15. You would do best to use your Ancient Artefacts until you hear the telltale
squelching noise, and then move to a new location and let the Lumberjack follow
you - repeat this until he dies as you use the Artefacts. Killing the Jelly
Blobs and then taking care of the Lumberjack is not really a feasible strategy,
because at least one Jelly Blob is likely to respawn before you&apos;ve finished
with him, and because you have the difficulty of evading the Lumberjack while
you&apos;re killing the Jelly Blobs in the first place.

16. Head south through the two hedges the Lumberjack ruined, and blast down
another one to the south to get to a Soldier (7). Walk south of him and into a
hidden passageway. Move east out of this, pick up the Bazookas to the north and
then head south to the end of the little passage you are in. Face the hedge at
the southern end, and fire three Bazooka shells in its direction; then walk
through and you can head south, unobstructed, to the southeast corner of the
level. From there, head northwest and through one Skull Door, collect the Baby
(3) to the west, and then head north through the second Skull Door for the
Cheerleader (A). There is nothing left on this level, so leave now.

-----

WALKTHROUGH (You can&apos;t or won&apos;t fight the Lumberjacks):

1. Walk into the northeast corner of your start area. Face the weak point in
the hedge to the north and then fire two Bazooka shells north at it. Walk
through the ruined hedge and into the hedge block to the north, to collect a
double-value Bazooka pickup. Head out of there, and blast down the hedge to the
north, directly west of the hedge block. Head through the hole, and then west
over to where a Teacher (8) stands. Go south, over to the entrance to the
ivy-covered passageway to the west; head into it, north out the other side, and
west past the wall that protrudes out north into the small square area.

2. Blast through the hedge to the west, and head through; blast down the hedge
to your south, and head through and over to the southwest corner of the next
cell; and blast through the hedge to the south there. Head around to the south
of the hedge block; blast the front in with a Bazooka shell. This frees up a
Lumberjack inside, who will currently be wandering aimlessly around, but isn&apos;t
likely to carry on doing so for very long; quickly dash into the hedge block,
pick up the Skeleton Key that&apos;s inside, and then dash out again and head south
down the western fork in the path.

3. If a second Lumberjack to the south spots you, don&apos;t worry - he&apos;s not likely
to give you much trouble, yet. The one you just left behind could do if he&apos;s on
your tail, though - so head west into the covered passage, and once out the
other side, head northwest fast to confound him. Continue northwest through a
second passageway to get to a tiny little hedge-cell with a Bazooka pickup
inside. Face the hedge to the north and fire two shells to demolish the two
hedges ahead. Meanwhile, to the west, another Lumberjack will have started the
chase, and he&apos;ll have chopped down a hedge to your southwest. You should walk
north through the two hedges you got rid of, and then step west to stand in
front of the two undamaged hedges remaining ahead of the Lumberjack.

4. The Lumberjack should stride north and cut his way through the two hedges
that now separate you. If he does not, head back into the aisle of damaged
hedges to the east; walk south down it to bring him back on-screen, so that you
can regain his attention; and then return north and try again to have him cut
through to you. (If this tactic keeps failing, blast through one or both of the
hedges yourself using the Bazookas.)

5. As the Lumberjack demolishes the last hedge, dodge around into the eastern
aisle and wait there while he attempts to reach you by walking into the wall.
(If he manages to follow you in, head west right up to the hedge, and get him
stuck on the other side of one of the hedge stumps protruding from the side of
the corridor, as this will have much the same effect.) After a few seconds of
waiting, the Lumberjack will begin walking along the wall instead of directly
towards you, into the hedge; what you should do now depends on whether he walks
towards you or away from you.

6. If the Lumberjack walks away from you, then wait until he returns, and
repeats the sequence of movements, as you will otherwise not have enough time
to get past him and through the hedges. Once he has started walking in your
direction around the wall, though, you should leave your defensive position and
move hastily past him (provided he&apos;s sufficiently near to you). The trouble
with this method is that he may not comply with what you want by moving in the
right direction; if you have a comfortable number of Bazooka shells, of course,
you could just step out in front of him and blast him down, then walk past him
while he lies down quaking on the floor.

7. Move south down the western aisle and you will arrive in a square pen
bordered by hedges. Don&apos;t slack now - keep moving, as the Lumberjack will be
coming after you again imminently. Blast down the hedge in the northwest corner
of the square using Bazookas, head through and give the same treatment to the
hedge in the northwest corner of this second square. You can now get through
this second hole, to a little yard containing Tourists (4).

8. Head to the southwest corner of the yard you are in, and blast down the
hedge section to the south using a Bazooka shell. Walk through it and over to
the southern end of the passageway beyond. When you reach the plaster wall,
head east and you will come to a dead end, with a fence to the south. Blast the
fence down, and head through into the alleyway to get a second Skeleton Key.

9. Return north out of the alleyway to arrive south of a hedgerow. You should
note that the Lumberjack is still around somewhere - it&apos;s not possible for me
to predict where, so you will need to be ready to evade him when you encounter
him. Hiding behind hedges, and then running past him when he starts stumbling
around the walls, is always a good approach. Head west to a tree at the corner
of the passageway, then turn to go north. You arrive back in the brick-walled
yard which contained the Tourists (4). Head southeast through two gaps in the
hedge.

10. You arrive in the first square pen you entered; head north out of the exit
in the northeast corner. At the end of the aisle of broken hedges, head east
and south down another one. You will arrive at a covered passageway; head
southeast through it and out the other side, and over to another passageway
leading from west to east. You will probably encounter the first Lumberjack
again around here (from inside the hedge block that contained the first
Skeleton Key), so you will need to continue with the wary approach to movement.
If he does attack you, then you could try dodging inside a third ivy-covered
passageway, whose entrance is to the north of the one you are currently in, on
the east side, and whose exit faces north.

11. Head out of the passageway, and walk northeast, passing the hedge block to
the north. Continue northeast through three gaps in the hedge and you will
arrive at a walled-in area; head east around the wall, south into an
ivy-covered passageway, and northeast out of there and over to the corner of
the next yard. Move south through two demolished hedges, and then southwest,
through a gap in the long fence. Continue over to the southeast corner of the
next area and a Lumberjack to the south will become aware of your presence.

12. Allow him to break down the two hedges between you, then as he takes his
axe to the second one, walk north round to the other side of the meteorite. He
will follow you over to the meteorite, and he&apos;ll attempt to walk over it, but
will be unable to do so. Lead him to the eastern hedge so that he cuts a
section of it down, then stand still. After a moment he will start walking
around the meteorite - you now have a few seconds in which he will ignore you,
as with the other Lumberjacks. Quickly head south through the two hedges he&apos;s
cleared for you, then blast down another hedge to the south of that, and you
can get through to a Soldier (7).

13. Carry on heading south, into a covered passageway. Head east out of it and
pick up the Bazookas to the north. Now walk over to the southern end of the
passageway you are in, and fire three Bazooka shots at the hedge. Walk south to
the southeast corner of the level, and then head northwest and in through a
Skull Door. To your west once inside is a Baby (3), and north through another
Skull Door you can collect a Cheerleader (A).

14. Exit through the first Skull Door, and head southeast over to the corner of
the square yard outside. Go north up the passageway until you come to a covered
passageway to the west. Walk through this and over to the western hedge of the
yard on the other side. Blast through the hedge and walk southwest over into
another covered passageway. Head out of this one to the north and then head
west over to the southwest corner of a square of hedges, making sure not to go
too far north.

15. You can see an Explorer (6) in the hedge cell to the west; you&apos;re now going
to rescue him, but in order to do so, you will need to move fast. As you make
your approach to him, two Lumberjacks will be alerted to your presence - one to
the north, one to the south - and will come after you. After you have him,
though, there are two more Explorers (9 and 5) nearby whom you&apos;ll need to
hasten to collect, after which you need to escape from the Lumberjack who was
to the south. Move quickly and pause often, in order to make sure you do
everything right.

16. Face the hedge to the south, and then blast through it with a Bazooka
shell. The recoil pushes you back just far enough to alert the Lumberjack to
the north - those playing the American version will be able to hear him revving
his chainsaw - so you need to start moving fast now. Walk southwest along the
passage you just opened up, to the far end; to the south, another Lumberjack
takes note of your presence. He&apos;ll move north and cut through the hedge that
separates you; meanwhile, you need to face north and swiftly fire your Bazooka
twice at the hedge. Once those hedges are gone, dash north into the cell to
save the Explorer (6).

17. What happens next depends on how many Victims you have, and also on how
quick you&apos;ve been. In the hedge block to your southwest is another Explorer
(9); if you have more than eight Victims and you&apos;ve gotten over to that last
Explorer (6) quickly enough, then the Lumberjack to your south will be
attempting to penetrate the hedge on the eastern side of the hedge block, so as
to get in and kill the Explorer (9). However, if you don&apos;t have that many
Victims, or you do, but you allowed the Lumberjack to follow you too closely,
then the Lumberjack will still be on your trail. If the Explorer (9) is not
present, then skip past paragraph 18, as it deals only with saving him and
returning to your current location.

18. Whether the Lumberjack is targeting you or not, head south (past him) all
the way over to the cell where he was initially standing. There is a hedge to
the west: either allow the Lumberjack to knock it down himself (if he&apos;s
wandering along the wall, and it looks as though he&apos;s going to do so); or blast
through yourself. Having gotten through, face the hedge block to your north and
demolish it with another shell. Head in and save the Explorer (9). You are now
hopefully in a position to just wait where you are, for the Lumberjack to
occupy himself with the usual distraction of wandering off for a few seconds.
When he does, head south out of the hedge block, east through a broken hedge
and north through two more into a comparatively long aisle heading from east to
west between the hedges.

19. Head west along the passage, to the corner where it turns north. Face the
nearest weak hedge section to the south and fire two Bazooka shells through it.
Walk south through the holes you made and over to the third Explorer (5), who&apos;s
inside a little cell at the southern edge of the level. Return north through
the two holes and walk east to come to another hole in the hedge to the south.
If you don&apos;t know where that last Lumberjack you found is right now, be ready
for him to appear again. As usual, dodging around indestructible hedge
sections, and waiting for him to get bored and wander off around the walls,
will work well.

20. Head southeast through the hedge and over to the east side of the
passageway just past it. Face the weak section in the hedge to the south, and
fire two Bazooka shells directly at it. Walk through, and head over to the
eastern side of the corridor you enter to find Tourists (10). Return west,
north through two broken hedges, northwest through another, and (still keeping
an eye out for the Lumberjack if you don&apos;t know where he is) west along the
aisle between the hedges. You will come to a corner where the path turns north;
follow it and you come to the entrance to a weed-covered area. Switch to your
Weedkiller and sweep west across the weeds; at the western end, kill the Pod
Plant and collect the Monster Potion it was resting on.

21. Head west into the covered passage, and north out of it. Face the weak
hedge section to your west, and fire two Bazooka shells at it. Walk through the
ruined hedges and fire another shell south at the next hedge; walk through that
to come to a Baby (2) standing in the southwest corner of the level. If you can
spare one more Bazooka shell (two if you haven&apos;t got any Keys), then you can
stay to get Soda Cans and open a Cupboard. As a brief hint, I&apos;ll just say that
at this particular stage in the game, I don&apos;t consider Soda Cans to be worth
much... So, if you&apos;re not interested, leave the level now.

PICKUPS (Only applies if you used the no-killing-Lumberjacks walkthrough):

22. Head north through a broken hedge and east through another. Blast through
the hedge to the north, and head through the door into the hut - if you haven&apos;t
got any Keys, you&apos;ll need to use your Bazooka to get through that as well. Once
in the hut, you can pick up Soda Cans, and open a Cupboard against the northern
wall. Head south again out of the open door and through a hedge, then west and
south through two more hedges. It&apos;s now (finally) time to exit the level.

47) MORE SHOCKING THAN LEVEL 46: LEVEL 47: GRIDIRON TERROR srch347

-----

DIFFICULTY: 6/10

This level features three of the rather unpleasant Snakeoid creatures, which
between them have the run of an American football field. You have to kill two
of them (although if you have only one Victim, you need only kill one Snakeoid
- but I hope you&apos;re doing better than that for Victims). As more Snakeoids die,
the trickle of American footballers becomes a torrent. If you&apos;re an optimist
you will see this as an easy opportunity to earn the second and last Bonus for
Pass Completion available in the game; if you&apos;re a pessimist you will see it as
an opportunity to be batted around the field like a paper doll. Whichever way
you see it, the fact remains that you won&apos;t take any damage from the American
footballers - which is more than can be said for the Snakeoids.

MONSTER LIST: American Footballers (intensity: increases as more of the
 Snakeoids are eliminated - very low intensity when they are
 all alive, very high intensity when they are all dead;
 location: nearly everywhere)

BOSS: Snakeoids (three)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Baby - Locked behind a Skull Door, in a cell at the northern edge of the
 level.
 2) Teacher - Locked in a separate part of the main building to the east of the
 American football field, accessible through a Skull Door in the southeast
 corner of the map.
 3) Barbecue Guy - North of where you start, just west of the spectator stands,
 near the northwest corner of the level.
 4) Cheerleader - Southeast of your start location, near to the southern edge
 of the playing field, between the twenty- and thirty-yard lines near the
 western end.
 5) Cheerleader - East of where you start, standing near the middle of the
 field.
 6) Cheerleader - Standing near to where you start, just a little to the
 northwest.
 7) Cheerleader - Standing between the benches in front of the spectator
 stands at the northern side of the field, northeast of your start location.
 8) Baby - Locked behind the same Skull Door as the Teacher (2), in the
 southeast corner of the map, in the small yard outside the building.
 9) Cheerleader - At the northeast corner of the field, just south of the
 fence.
10) Cheerleader - Near to the southern edge of the field, next to the
 twenty-yard line near the eastern end.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Ice Lollies
 Plates
 Monster Potion
 Speed Shoes
 Two pickups of American Footballs
 Fire Extinguisher (needed if you are low on Ancient
 Artefacts, to help you fight Frankenstein&apos;s Monster on
 the next level)
 Silverware

BONUSES AVAILABLE: 50 points per Victim saved
 Ten Cheerleader Bonus - 1000 points [awarded in place of the&quot;All Victims Saved Bonus&quot;despite the fact that not all
 of the Victims are Cheerleaders...]
 Secret Bonus - 2000 points [This is also awarded to you if
 you save all ten Victims, although you don&apos;t visit a
 Bonus Level. So, in total, you get 3000 points for
 saving all ten Victims, instead of the normal 1000.]
 You Saved More Victims Bonus - 1000 points (two-player mode)
 Bonus for Pass Completion - 5000 points

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: After you&apos;ve gotten rid of the Snakeoids,
earned your Bonus for Pass Completion, and collected the small stash of Bonus
Points Pickups, that&apos;s about it - there aren&apos;t any inexhaustible sources of
bonus points on this level. It&apos;s a pity, as this is the last point in the game
at which you are potentially able to earn an Extra Bonus Victim.

-----

WALKTHROUGH, PART ONE:

1. The first step in this level is to collect all the Victims who are on the
American football field, without attracting the attention of the Snakeoids. I
will direct you mostly around the edge of the field, so that you collect the
Victims in the optimum order without straying over the Snakeoids&apos; territory; be
aware that the American Football Players, which occasionally spawn on and
around the field, will attempt to charge into you in order to throw you a few
metres across the grass. You don&apos;t want them to knock you somewhere where the
Snakeoids will notice you (certainly not at first), so be careful to keep away
from them.

2. Head northwest and collect a Cheerleader (6), then head south to find Ice
Lollies lying on the edge of the end zone. From them, go north up to the edge
of the field, and head east from there to save a Barbecue Guy (3). Continue
east, between the bench and the spectator stand, and you will find a
Cheerleader (7) standing in front of the stand, accompanied by Soda Cans. Head
directly south from her location to find more Soda Cans on the field. Go
southeast from them to find a Key, and then east to find another Cheerleader
(5).

3. Move north up to the edge of the field, and then head east between the
benches and the second spectator stand. Further along from the end of the
stand, at the northeast corner of the field, you will find a Cheerleader (9).
Walk east to the wall of the small hut, and then walk south around it and
continue east across the paved area. You will come to a door to the north;
enter, pick up Plates inside, and head northwest over to a Cupboard. Having
opened that, use your Bazooka to blast through the cracked wall to the
northeast; walk through and over to the eastern end of the alleyway to get a
Monster Potion.

4. Return south through the hole in the wall and out the door, then head west
alongside the northern wall until you reach the eastern end of the field. Walk
south from there until you reach the southeast corner of the field. Head west
at this point, and when you pass the painted number&quot;10&quot;on the grass to the
north, head northwest to find a Cheerleader (10). Head south from her location
to find a Bin to open at the southern edge of the field.

5. Now head northwest until you are on a line with the row of numbers painted
from east to west across the field, and then walk due west over them. The
Snakeoids will most likely appear around now, as you walk west. Past the
30-yard line on the western side of the field, you come to the final
Cheerleader (4); collect her quickly, before the Snakeoids eat her up. Note
that there are some American Footballs to the southwest, which you may find
useful.

SNAKEOID FIGHTING:

6. You&apos;ll now be confronted by up to three Snakeoids. However, you only need to
kill two of them (and only one if you have just one Victim!). Killing the extra
last Snakeoid will get you an extra Skeleton Key, yes, but at this late stage
in the game, that&apos;s redundant. Starting the next level with an additional
Skeleton Key will give you a slight advantage, but it doesn&apos;t really come to
anything. So, unless you are simply rolling in Monster-killing equipment, I
recommend that you only kill as many of the Snakeoids as you actually need to.

7. That&apos;s all very well to say, but in reality you cannot ensure that all of
your attacks go towards damaging just one or two of the Snakeoids, because they
all look the same. Actually you could, in theory, if you watched one like a
hawk and made sure never to hit any other one, but of course their mounds of
earth sometimes cross over each other anyway so that you aren&apos;t sure which is
which afterwards.

8. So, how easy you find it to fight the Snakeoids now will depend upon how
many (one, two or even three) there are with you, and upon how many (one or
two) you actually need to kill. If there are more present than you need to
kill, it&apos;s inevitable that you will be expending at least a little firepower on
a Snakeoid whom you won&apos;t eventually kill. I don&apos;t know of any way of
separating Snakeoids so that one follows you and one stays behind,
unfortunately.

9. Some things to consider while fighting the Snakeoids:

- Do not move around the field too much; try and stay still, preferably
 somewhere near one of the edges. The reason for this is that if you move
 around you are almost certain to end up fighting all three of the Snakeoids
 (which you don&apos;t need to do) as you&apos;ll have gathered them on the way.
- If you are fighting more than one at once, try and get them both to your
 north. It&apos;s easiest to judge their movements and to hit them when they&apos;re to
 your north; and also, you really don&apos;t want them on either side of you with
 respect to latitude, as it&apos;s then a nightmare to keep track of their
 movements, particularly when they decide to take turns rising up and biting
 you in the back. To get them to your north, just try and move south around
 them; however, don&apos;t get right up close to the southern wall, or they will
 have you trapped.
- The Snakeoids rise out of the ground in response to movement from you,
 however slight. If you actually stand still on the spot (which means not
 firing or changing your weapons, as well as not moving), they will not bite.
 If in a difficult situation, try standing for a moment, and then running, to
 get away.
- A good strategy for fighting the Snakeoids is to run up to stand diagonally
 near their mound of earth, but before they rise up to bite, run back to stand
 further away, and then fire on them. If this strategy is used effectively,
 you can eventually kill a Snakeoid with something as weak as the Water
 Pistol.
- The most powerful weapons are not necessarily the best to use (certainly on
 this level, as you&apos;ll need as much firepower as possible on the next one). As
 noted above, even your flimsy little Water Pistol can be used effectively
 against them if used correctly. If you can pull off the&quot;bait-and-run&quot;technique described above, you could benefit from using the opportunity to
 unload some of the weapons that you aren&apos;t going to get rid of anywhere else.

10. Weapons to Use:

- Plates: Use all of your Plates here, as it is the best time to use them.
 Although you would benefit from having a few on the next level, they&apos;re far
 more useful here for putting paid to the Snakeoids. (It takes about fifteen
 Plates to kill a Snakeoid.)
- Tomatoes, Ice Lollies, American Footballs: If you use up your weak weapons on
 the Snakeoids, it ensures that you have as many of the more powerful weapons
 as possible for the final boss. Note that I don&apos;t include the Water Pistol in
 this group of weapons - it can be used here, but it&apos;s good on the next level
 in its own right.
- Water Pistol: This is actually very useful on the next level (and not just
 for fighting Zombies). Feel free to use them here, but if you can avoid it,
 don&apos;t let your ammo fall below 150.
- Bazookas: Although they are most effective, these are something that you
 might want to save for the next level. But, if the weapons above aren&apos;t
 working for you, you can choose to use the Bazookas here, instead. Make sure
 you save enough shells to blast down all the doors and walls you need to get
 through, to access the remaining Victims and important pickups, on this
 level. (That will be at least one, and possibly two if you are low on Keys.)

11. Dream Weapons (you may, conceivably, not have these with you...):

- Monster Potion: Only if you have buckets of it... You are likely to want as
 much of this stuff as you can get on the next level, but if you have, say,
 seven of them, it might suit you to be lazy and use one of them here.
 Certainly if you can spare one, it gets most of the job done at once.
- Mystery Potion: You could try these repeatedly until you get one that turns
 you into the Purple Monster. You might want to save them for the next level,
 like I advised you to do for the Monster Potions, but I don&apos;t think you&apos;re
 going to miss them as much.
- Pandora&apos;s Box - Another thing that you ought really to be keeping for level
 48 if you haven&apos;t got many. How many you can get away with using really
 depends on how many weapons of other types you have; I advise that if you
 have less than five Monster Potions, you don&apos;t use any; if you have more than
 five Monster Potions but less than eight, you shouldn&apos;t let your Pandora&apos;s
 Boxes fall below ten; and if you have more than ten Monster Potions, well,
 you can use as many as you want...
- Flamethrower - Fry them! But don&apos;t let your ammo fall below 150 if you can
 help it.

12. Weapons Not to Use: Soda Cans (too slow), Weedkiller and Ancient Artefacts
(too close-range), Silverware (you need it to use against Werewolves on the
next level), Fire Extinguisher and Martian Bubble Gun (no effect), Decoy Clowns
(don&apos;t last long enough).

WALKTHROUGH, PART TWO:

13. Unless you actually killed all of them, there will still be one or two more
Snakeoids roaming around the field; you might well run into them as you pick up
the items scattered around. If so, try to move on your way quickly and leave
them behind. In addition to the remaining Snakeoid(s), the number of American
Footballers running around will have increased - they will be all over the
field and any other open areas, and they&apos;ll push you all over the place if you
let them.

14. This doesn&apos;t cause you to lose any health, but it&apos;s very annoying and a
complete waste of time. So, stay up against walls and in confined spaces where
possible, in order to keep away from both your enemies. Remember that the
footballers provide you with an opportunity as well as an irritation; if ten of
them are passed American footballs, you&apos;ll receive the 5000-point Bonus for
Pass Completion when you reach the end of the level.

15. Make sure to collect the Skeleton Keys dropped by the Snakeoids you killed.
Now head over to the southwest corner of the map. Walk east until you see the
ten- and twenty-yard lines to your north, then walk north over to the field.
You will find Speed Shoes and American Footballs (assuming you didn&apos;t already
collect those) on the ground near the edge. Continue further north to find a
Key, and then carry on walking to the northern edge of the field.

16. Walk east, keeping north of the bench in front of the spectator stand. When
you reach the end of the first spectator stand, head north up between the two
stands and continue east along the northern wall of the level. After a bit of a
walk, the path takes a turn south. Follow it around to the Skull Door to the
north. Go through and collect a Baby (A).

17. Return south out of the Baby&apos;s (A) cell. There is a door to the southwest;
if you have three or more Keys, then open it. If you don&apos;t have enough Keys,
you should blast it open with a Bazooka shell (the Fire Extinguisher inside
will be more useful than you might think). Inside the little hut, pick up the
Fire Extinguisher and open a Cupboard. When you are finished around here,
return northwest to the alleyway behind the fence, and walk west again, behind
the eastern spectator stand, to the gap between the stands.

18. Walk south out to the side of the field and continue walking east. When you
reach the gap between the two benches in front of the second stand, head south
to find American footballs a few metres from the edge of the field. Return
north once more, and head east to where the second spectator stand ends and the
fence begins directly to its east. Head south from here to find Silverware on
the ground near the end zone.

19. From the Silverware, head east across the field to the edge of the paved
area. To the south here is a hut, with a door on the north side. If you have
two or more Keys on you at this point, go through and open the Cupboard. You
can use a Bazooka to get in if you haven&apos;t got enough Keys, and want to take a
gamble on it being worth a shell. Once you have finished with the hut, head
southeast from it to find an entrance in the side of a large building. Go in,
and head north to find a Cupboard.

20. Return south to the side entrance, and head out of it and walk west. Head
south at the first opportunity, and continue south down the passageway to the
wall at the southern edge of the level. Head east here; there&apos;s a door to the
north a few metres on. If you still have two or more Keys at this point, go in
and over to the northern wall to find another Cupboard. If you don&apos;t have that
many Keys, then you can choose whether or not you want to gamble a Bazooka
shell on the Cupboard.

21. From that door, head east and you will come to a Skull Door to the north.
Through here are the last two Victims (2 and 8). If you don&apos;t need to enter
because you have only one Victim, and you don&apos;t want the Bonus Points Pickups
and the two Cupboards either, then return to the Baby&apos;s (A) cell on the
northern edge of the level, where the Exit Door awaits you. (Read the preamble
to level 48 before you use it.) If you have more than one Victim, though, you
should go through now.

22. To the northeast of the Skull Door, in a little alleyway, is a Baby (8).
Collect him and then return southwest. There is a regular door to the north.
Open it (or blast it down with your Bazooka), and head through. Open the
Cupboard that&apos;s dead ahead, and another Cupboard to the northwest. Collect the
Teacher (A). To her southwest is a cracked wall that may be blasted down to
provide access to a small collection of Bonus Points Pickups. Go and grab them
if you want. Before you exit the level, read the preamble to level 48, below,
so that you&apos;re prepared when you start.

--------------------------------+++++++++++++++--------------------------------

48) LEVEL 48: CURSE OF THE TONGUE srch348

-----

DIFFICULTY: 7/10 to 10/10

You&apos;re now beginning what is overall the most difficult level in the game -
it&apos;s the one featuring Dr. Tongue, the final boss! As with the previous boss on
level 36, how hard you find this one will depend on how well equipped you are:
if you started on level 37 (or even at the beginning of the game) then you&apos;ll
find it to be relatively easy, but if you started on level 45 then you&apos;ll be
swatted aside unless you&apos;re very good - and fairly lucky. As with level 36&apos;s
boss, it&apos;s been dealt with in a separate section - look below this level&apos;s
walkthrough to see...

Of course, before you even get to the boss, you have to make your way through
Dr. Tongue&apos;s most complex castle laboratory yet, and that&apos;s pretty hard in
itself. You will need to fight a Vampire, and Frankenstein&apos;s Monster, in order
to stop them from following you to the boss&apos; arena, and ganging up on you
there. The Victims are also a difficult lot, being placed in some fairly
inconvenient locations. In particular, your first task in the level is to get
halfway around the laboratory in time to save two Tourist Couples (4 and 5)
from undergoing the usual transformation as night falls. Whether you eventually
find the boss easy or hard, the level you have to fight through to get to him
is certainly one of the most difficult ones in the game as well.

- NOTE: Cheating: It is possible to exit this level, and make the game behave
as if you completed it legitimately, without defeating the boss. (This does, of
course, not count as finishing the game properly.) Go and see section two of
this file,&quot;Tips, Tricks and Strategies&quot;, to find out exactly how to achieve
this.

MONSTER LIST: Frankenstein&apos;s Monster (one)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: very low, location: one place)
 Mummies (intensity: very low, location: two places)
 Spiders (the Giant Spider produces regular-sized Spiders at a
 medium intensity rate, as you fight him)
 Vampire (one)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists after 36 seconds: 4 and 5;
 spawning randomly after 40 seconds, intensity: ranges from
 low to medium, location: patchy)
 Zombies [Normal and Vicious] (intensity: ranges from very low to
 very high, location: patchy)

BOSS: Giant Spider followed by Giant Head (Dr. Tongue)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - In the northwest corner of the level, behind the barrier at
 the northern side of the boss arena. You will need to defeat Dr. Tongue in
 both his forms before you can get through to save her.
 2) Cheerleader - In a cell on the northern side of the level, at the other end
 of Dr. Tongue&apos;s complicated laboratory. You will need to find your way
 through a tortuous route around the edges of the level to get over to her,
 and you will need to use one of your Skeleton Keys to get in to save her.
 (It&apos;s lucky they&apos;re so easy to come by on this level.)
 3) Cheerleader - On the eastern side of the map, inside a ring of timed
 electric barriers.
 4) Tourists - On a secluded balcony in the southeast corner of the map.
 5) Tourists - Standing on a Skeleton Key, on a balcony which is near your
 start location, but is accessed by heading north along a walkway from the
 southeast corner of the level, where the other Tourists (4) were.
 6) Teacher - On a raised dais, south of where you start, and accessed by a
 flight of stairs to its south.
 7) Baby - On the eastern side of the level, west across the laboratory from
 the Cheerleader (3), also penned in by timed electric barriers.
 8) Dog - South a little from where you start, in a corner of the pathway.
 9) Cheerleader - Standing near a Skeleton Key, on a balcony in the southwest
 corner of the map.
10) Baby - At the western end of the raised dais, at the end of the long route
 through the laboratory, west of the Skull Door cell holding the Cheerleader
 (2).

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: Two Pandora&apos;s Boxes
 Two Weedkiller pickups
 Two First Aid Kits
 Extra Life
 Decoy Clowns
 Five Skeleton Keys (all five of which you will use, unless
 you have only one Victim, in which case you only need to
 use four)

BONUSES AVAILABLE: None (there is no bonus screen at the end of the level)

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: Near the southwest corner of the level,
through the hidden passage, where Zombies spawn at a very high rate. If you go
and score bonus points on this level, it can only be for the sake of getting a
high points score - you cannot earn an Extra Bonus Victim.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. There are two Tourist Couples (4 and 5) on this level, and they both need
saving within 36 seconds. Luckily, the Speed Shoes which you picked up on the
previous level will get you there comfortably on time. Make sure you have
switched your special item to the Speed Shoes, so that they are ready for use
as soon as you start on this level. You should make sure to collect the Dog (8)
along the way, because someone&apos;s left him smack in the middle of a Zombie
spawning area. Other than that, there is a Vampire, and also a Frankenstein&apos;s
Monster on the level, as mentioned above; this walkthrough allows you to tackle
them both in isolation. What you must not do is walk north at all as you begin
the level, as then the Vampire will come after you too early, which will give
you extra difficulties.

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. Use your Speed Shoes, and then set off southwest. At the second corner,
where the path goes south again, follow it along and you will come to some
steps, with a Dog (8) to the side at the end. If there are Zombies around,
spray them with Water Pistol fire as you approach, in order to protect the Dog
(8); collect the Dog and then carry on southeast, and south down a corridor
under a series of arches. Head west at the end, and northwest across a
courtyard littered with bones. At the northwest corner of this yard, head west,
moving south a little as the passage alters bends slightly.

3. At the western end of the passage, you will come to a carpet laid on the
floor. You may start hearing evil laughter repeated occasionally at this point;
this is coming from a Mad Scientist standing at the top of the stairs to the
northwest. You could avoid listening to him by going up the steps towards him,
prompting him to drink his potion and explode, but I recommend going to save
the Tourists (4 and 5) first, as my walkthrough directs you back to this part
of the level immediately after you have finished doing so.

4. Walk off the carpet and push south into the section of the wall that is made
of lighter-coloured stone, as you move west and east, and you will find a
secret passage leading south; go along to the other end and east, then north up
the staircase. Walk east from the top of the stairs, then turn to go southeast
at the T-junction. Note that the Speed Shoes might wear out, anywhere from
around here onwards; when they do, if you have another pair with you, use that
straight away - this is the last time in the game that you need any, so get rid
of them all if you want.

5. At the southeast corner of the paved area, there is a walkway leading east.
Walk along it to the other end, and then carry on east using the route to the
south. You will come to a Tourist Couple (4); save them, take a second to open
the Chest, and then return west, and north along another, slightly less narrow
walkway. You will pass an open dais to the east; continue past it, and you will
come to a large open paved area at the northern end of the walkway. In the
northwest corner of it stand the second Tourist Couple (5). They are standing
on a Skeleton Key, which you&apos;ll collect at the same time as them.

VICTIMS:

6. Return all the way along the walkway to the southern edge of the level, and
then all the way west to the other end of the first walkway. (Switch to your
Silverware, so as to be prepared to fight Werewolves who jump onto the walkway
ahead of you, blocking your path.) Open the chest to the north, then head
northwest to a T-junction. Take a short detour east to pick up a First Aid Kit,
then go west over to the top of a flight of stairs. Descend them and then go
west, and north up the covered stone passageway to the area with the carpet.
Head northwest and up the flight of stairs, and that blasted noisy Mad
Scientist will top himself with a potion.

7. Don&apos;t bother investigating further here - instead return south down the
stairs, then head east along a corridor. When you come to a corner, with a
raised dais to the east, head south. Where the corridor opens up, head
southwest into a little cul-de-sac, and you will find Weedkiller at the end.
Having collected it, get your Silverware ready for use, and head out of there
and northeast over to some stairs. At the top of the stairs, you will find a
Teacher (6), in the northeast corner of the platform. If a Werewolf has spawned
around here, you will need to be ready to slay it quickly.

8. Go south down the stairs again, and southeast into the narrow passageway
heading north under arches. Walk north up to the other end, then head northwest
to come to another, wider, passage north. At the other end of that, go west for
a Pandora&apos;s Box, then east until you find stairs to your north. At the top of
the stairs is an entrance to a covered passage, which is a dead end; walk into
it and up to the northern end, to get Bonus Points Pickups and a Skeleton Key.
A Vampire will fly in from the northeast and begin circling you. Quickly move
south out of the passage and over to the base of the stairs, as it&apos;s not
unknown for a Werewolf to jump into the Cheerleader&apos;s (2) cell, visible
on-screen to the west, and kill her.

9. You now need to move to a safe place to fight the Vampire: head west, south,
southeast and south down passageways. From the southern end of the passageway
with the arches overhead, walk west and then north across a yard covered with
bones, to the northwest corner. Head west along a long, wide corridor, over to
the carpeted area, and go up the stairs to the northwest. Head south down the
walkway to their west. At the far end of it, in the southwest corner of the
level, you will find a Cheerleader (9), two Bonus Points Pickups, and a
Skeleton Key all in a spacious paved area where the walkway opens up.

10. As you wait for the Vampire to fly over, switch to your Ancient Artefacts,
or if you have none, your Weedkiller. When the Vampire arrives, kill him with
either your Artefacts, or your Weedkiller. Using the Weedkiller is actually not
as expensive in terms of ammo and health as you might think, if done well. If
you attack the Vampire every time he opens up into human form, his bat missiles
will usually be caught by the Weedkiller before they reach you; and the whole
operation should take no more than about one hundred of your Weedkiller ammo.
Do not use the Fire Extinguisher on him before using the Weedkiller - he will
not take damage from the Weedkiller while frozen.

11. When the Vampire has flown away, go north up the walkway to the end, and
head down the stairs to the southeast. From the base of the stairs, head over
to the hidden passageway through the lighter stone area in the eastern side of
the southern wall. Go south to the other end of the passageway, head east and
north up the stairs, and then go east to a T-junction. Go southeast here, to
the far corner of the paved area.

12. Have your Silverware ready, because Werewolves will be all too ready to
ambush you as you cross the first walkway ahead. When you are ready, escape the
Zombies by stepping onto the walkway to the east, and crossing to the far end.
Go north up the next walkway, and when it widens out into a large area to the
east, walk east onto it and then south down the stairs to a carpeted area. Go
east here and north across a second (very long and narrow) carpet.

13. When you reach the far end of that second carpet, switch to your Water
Pistol, and (if you are prepared to spare one to protect a Victim) your
Pandora&apos;s Boxes. Head over to the timed electric barrier to your north. Wait
for it to switch on and then disappear, and then immediately walk north through
it, through one more afterwards, and over to a third one north of that. You
will see a Cheerleader (3) to the north, and a Baby (7) to her west; there may
be a Zombie in the area, threatening either of them. If so, kill it with either
your Water Pistol or a Pandora&apos;s Box.

14. Don&apos;t relax; continue north as soon as the next barrier switches off, wait
at the last one, and go through when it is inactive - unless there is a Mummy
approaching from the north, in which case, disregard the pain and rush over to
save her as fast as possible. Having saved the Cheerleader (3), wait for the
beam to your west to disappear, then head through the gap, wait at the next
one, and save the Baby (7) in the corner.

15. You should now exercise caution in passing all of the timed electric gates;
you will not be specifically instructed where you need to wait and where you do
not need to. Switch to either your Ancient Artefacts (if you have ten or more
left), or your Fire Extinguisher. Go north through a barrier, then northeast
and through another one. Frankenstein&apos;s Monster, to your northwest, will now
notice your presence and disconnect from his electrodes. You should either get
to burning him with fire from your Artefacts, or hit him with a long blast of
your Fire Extinguisher (40+ ammo). When he is properly frozen, switch to your
Weedkiller, and attack him. Provided you get your positioning right for the
attack, it should take less than one hundred Weedkiller ammo to kill him.

16. Head north between Frankie&apos;s charging electrodes, and a little further
north past one electric barrier to the east. Go east between the pylons of the
two barriers nearest to the north and south - these two pylons are unconnected
and so do not have a barrier running between them. Head north through an
electric barrier to collect another Skeleton Key, then return south when it&apos;s
safe. Go west again between the unconnected pylons, then head northwest to an
empty pair of charging electrodes. There is another electric barrier to the
west; go through and then continue west. Push southwest into the corner at the
end to find a hidden Extra Life. Quickly go east past a stool to the north, and
north through an electric barrier.

17. Walk over to the northeast corner of the laboratory and open a Curtain
there. Head west along the northern wall to open another Curtain and a Chest.
Go west through another electric barrier, and open the next Curtain to the
north. Carry on west along the laboratory, past a couple more electric
barriers, just to the south of a row of gargoyles&apos; heads along the northern
wall. Past the last one, investigate the northern wall to find another pair of
Curtains.

18. Go south over two carpets and all the way down a passageway, and at the end
head east, and then north up a flight of stairs. At the top, to your northwest,
is a Baby (10); collect him quickly. If there are Werewolves following you at
this point, kill them before continuing east. When all Werewolves are slain,
head east past a suit of armour to your north, and over to a Chest. Open it and
then head southeast to stand in front of a Skull Door to the north. Open it and
save the Cheerleader (2) inside, before opening the Chest behind her. (Don&apos;t
open the Chest first, because if there&apos;s a Bogeyman inside, it will kill her as
well as hurting you.)

19. To get to your next location, follow these directions: South out of the
cell, northwest to the stairs, south down the stairs, west, north; east,
through a total of three timed electric barriers, until you come across an
empty pair of Frankenstein&apos;s Monsters&apos; charging electrodes to the south; south
through these, and further south and through another pair; southeast and
through a timed electric barrier; south further through another three barriers,
then east through one more;

20. South along a carpet, west at the end, and north up the stairs; south down
a walkway to the west, and west along another walkway (with your weapons
switched to Silverware in case Werewolves attack you); northwest to a
T-junction, west to some stairs, south down them, west to a covered passageway,
north to the other end of it, northwest to some stairs, and north up them to
arrive in front of a Skull Door.

21. Walk north, through three Skull Doors, and then east and south down some
more stairs. At the bottom, walk southeast across the carpeted hallway, to the
lighter part of the wall to the south. Press into this section of the wall, as
you walk east and west, and your character will enter a hidden passageway.
Inside, you will collect a First Aid Kit, Decoy Clowns, and a Weedkiller
pickup. Return north out of there, onto the carpet, and head over to the
eastern end of the hallway.

22. Press into the eastern wall and walk north, and you will enter another
hidden passageway, which takes you through to a large square platform above an
abyss. On the platform are Bonus Points Pickups and one last Skeleton Key.
Having collected these, return to the southwest corner of the platform and push
west into the wall while walking north. You will walk back through the hidden
passageway to the carpeted area. Head north up the tiled passageway to another
Skull Door. Head through it and past some laboratory apparatus, to find a
Mystery Potion lying on the floor in front of a row of timed electric barriers.

23. North of here, past the electric barriers, is Dr. Tongue&apos;s boss arena. As
on level 36, you now need to fight the boss in order to access the final
Victim, a Cheerleader (A). She&apos;s in a stone dungeon to the north of the arena,
behind a barrier that will only disappear in response to the boss&apos; death. You
may consider this level finished, but for the boss, as there are no more
pickups to collect outside the boss arena. Read the next section of the
walkthrough to learn how the fight with Dr. Tongue works, how it differs from
the fight with Dr. Bug earlier in the game, and the strategies I recommend for
beating him.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGHT

Dr. Tongue has two forms: the Giant Spider (as seen on level 36) and the Giant
Head (new). The Giant Spider is the first form he uses, and it&apos;s also his most
difficult. It&apos;s tougher even than it was on level 36, as you have a larger
arena to fight him in - meaning that there will be more sticky cobwebs to clean
up, and he has more scope for dodging your attacks. However, for the most part
your tactics in fighting this boss will be the same as they were on level 36.
The only thing that is different is the order of weapons you should use on him,
as you have only one more form of the boss afterwards, rather than a whole
string of levels to play through.

The Giant Head, meanwhile, is comparatively easy. He&apos;s vulnerable to most of
your weapons, has much less powerful attacks, and isn&apos;t as good at dodging out
of the way. The transition from Spider to Head is via his human form; he&apos;ll
blow up as a Giant Spider, return to human form, then wait for you to approach
before drinking another Potion and taking on the Giant Head form. This gives
you an opportunity to use your Weedkiller to sweep up the sticky cobwebs before
allowing him to turn into the Head. Since the Spider is so much more taxing,
you should use your choicest weapons on him first, and kill the Head with the
leftovers (pretty much). Notably, the Head takes more damage from the Water
Pistol than you might expect.

-----

HOW TO BEGIN

Read the sections below before starting. Decide which weapons you&apos;ll start with
and switch to them. Wait for a timed electric barrier to your north to switch
on, then off again; then head north through it and over to the northwest corner
of the arena, to find a Pandora&apos;s Box. Now, move to a suitable position to be
in as the fight begins; and get to work.

-----

THE GIANT SPIDER&apos;S HEALTH, AND HOW TO GAUGE IT

[Partially reproduced from the Boss Guide to Dr. Bug]

The Giant Spider will flash whenever you do him damage. (He will also flash
when you hit him with the Fire Extinguisher or Martian Bubble Gun, even though
these don&apos;t have any effect on him.) Where he flashes depends upon how damaged
he is. Initially the two large eyes on the front, the mandibles, and the four
additional eyes on his forehead (around the green patch) will flash. However as
you deal him more damage, these four eyes fail, one by one; first the Spider&apos;s
upper left eye will fail (remember, that&apos;s the top-right one as you look at
him), then his upper right eye, then his lower left eye. With the failure of
each eye, the Spider&apos;s whole body will momentarily flash electric blue.

Once the last eye, the lower right one, has failed, the spider will flash all
over for an extended period of time (whenever you hit him, his whole body will
flash electric blue). After a while, this stops and only his two front eyes and
mandibles will be flashing - this means he&apos;s close to death, and you only need
to keep attacking until he starts blowing up.

When the Giant Spider starts blowing up, you need to get away from it and over
to the other side of the arena, as quickly as you can. Dr. Tongue will drink
another potion and transform into the Giant Head when you are near enough; and
you need to sweep up as many as possible of the cobwebs that are all over the
floor, before you let him do that. You should also realise that after he has
completely blown up, the Giant Spider still manages to send out a final feeble
burst of two or three normal-sized Spiders for you to deal with.

-----

THE GIANT SPIDER&apos;S MOVEMENTS AND ATTACKS

The Giant Spider is restricted to the large arena in which you first come
across Dr. Tongue, but he can move about very rapidly within that arena. This
causes the first difficulty: it is difficult to hit him with projectile
weapons. His attacks come thick and fast, and are difficult to defend against.
The attack that will cause you the most damage is his continuous spawning of
normal-sized Spiders; these are persistent in their attacks, and hard to kill.

His other attack is his web missiles; these are sticky strands of webbing which
stick to the floor where they land (and hurt you if you&apos;re standing where they
strike). The webbing stays on the floor, sticking you down and almost stopping
your movement; the fastest way to move across the web is to fidget the
controls, so that your character alternates between the two component
directions of diagonal movement. This will allow him to move at the fastest
rate he can across the sticky cobwebs (not very fast). However, the webs can be
cleared off the floor using the Weedkiller; and patches of floor which have
webs cleared from them in this way, will be stripped clear so that future webs
cannot attach.

The boss&apos; difficulty, then, lies in him laying down his webs so that you can&apos;t
escape easily, and then setting his little Spiders on you so that they leech
your health away as you&apos;re trying. You can use the Decoy Clowns to distract the
little Spiders, while you attack the boss, but this isn&apos;t the best way to go
about it.

Even if you started as recently as level 45, you should have picked up at least
three, preferably four Monster Potions while playing through the previous three
levels. To take advantage of the invulnerability from Spider attacks they
offer, Monster Potions are what you are advised to use - after first waiting
for the Giant Spider to cover a reasonable amount of the floor with sticky
cobwebs, so that you can then strip them off and be mostly rid of the problem
of immobility.

-----

GIANT SPIDER - WEAPONS AND ITEMS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

[In alphabetical order]

BAZOOKA: If you have good aim, this will deal decisive damage quickly. It works
best if you are firing directly north and the Giant Spider is stationary. Don&apos;t
worry about saving these for the Giant Head - if you&apos;ve got to use them, do.

DECOY CLOWNS: These work very well at distracting the normal-sized Spiders, but
they do not last for very long. Bear in mind that you can only have three
active at the same time - keep an eye on how those you have placed are doing
(that is, whether they&apos;ve burst yet). If you have any, you should make sure to
use them if you&apos;re not transformed into some alternative shape.

FLAMETHROWER: Of course, if you&apos;ve been playing since the beginning of the game
or thereabouts, it&apos;s likely that you&apos;ve gotten yourself a Flamethrower. Go
ahead and use it all up - it&apos;s not necessary to save it for the Giant Head, as
there are other, more commonplace weapons that will work just as well against
him.

MONSTER POTION: Although you&apos;ll deal damage quite slowly as the Purple Monster,
you&apos;ll be invincible while you do it. Unfortunately, in addition to the slow
rate of attack, you just can&apos;t get to the Giant Spider very often - while
you&apos;re in the centre of the room punching on the spot, unable to move due to
the cobwebs, the Giant Spider will dance around you and rarely come close. But
if you wait for the centre of the room to get covered in sticky cobwebs, you
can then strip them away and attack the Giant Spider relatively actively. This
is the strategy I recommend using here.

MYSTERY POTION: You&apos;ll sometimes turn into a Purple Monster, allowing you to
deal with the Giant Spider most effectively, but at other times you&apos;ll wind up
as a ghost or as Mr Hyde, unable to do anything for about 30 seconds. The
Mystery Potion can be a good timewaster in this way, though, as you wait for
the floor to get covered in webs, ready for you to sweep them up.

PANDORA&apos;S BOXES: If you have any, use them all up straight away! They&apos;re great
against the Giant Spider.

PLATES AND SILVERWARE: Both of these are very effective against the Giant
Spider... if you can hit with them. Unfortunately, it&apos;s difficult to do so, and
so if you use them, they&apos;re likely to mostly be wasted. Plates and Silverware
should be a last resort, as they&apos;re more helpful against the Giant Head.

WEEDKILLER: Hardly the best thing to chase after the Giant Spider with (you&apos;ll
take massive damage), but it is very useful to sweep up the sticky cobwebs that
he drops. It can also protect you from the normal-sized Spiders (though not
very well, as they move so fast).

AND THOSE YOU SHOULDN&apos;T: Water Pistol, Ancient Artefacts, Soda Cans, Tomatoes,
Ice Lollies, and American Footballs. Avoid using these, because they&apos;re
absolutely no good against the Giant Spider. However, some of them will prove
more useful against the Giant Head...

-----

STRATEGY ONE: Exclusive Use of One Weapon.

Just use one of the better weapons listed above (such as the Monster Potions)
to knock out the boss, without using anything else at all. This is the easiest
(and least interesting) way of doing the boss; it will be open to you if you&apos;ve
been playing for a particularly long time (since before level 25, say). For
other players, it will be necessary to use a strategy that&apos;s not so wasteful in
terms of your items...

-----

STRATEGY TWO: Giant Spider Weapon Sequences.

In conjunction with the&quot;Wait, Sweep, and Kill&quot;strategy below, use your
weapons in the following order, unless there&apos;s a compelling reason not to (for
example, low health). This order has been formulated based on how effective
each weapon is, and how much of your current (or imagined) stock you&apos;re likely
to need while fighting the Giant Head. Some of the bullet points might not
apply to you, but the idea is to conform to this rough plan when possible.

If you&apos;ve been playing for a while (that is, you started before level 33 or on
level 37) then I suggest the following weapon sequence:

- Use your remaining Pandora&apos;s Boxes.
- Use the Monster Potions until you have one of them left.
- Use your remaining Flamethrower ammo.
- Use the Bazooka until you have 15 shells left.
- Use Plates and Silverware until you have 15 of each left.
- Use your remaining Mystery Potions.
- Use your remaining Monster Potion.
- Use your remaining Bazookas.
- Use your remaining Plates and Silverware.
- Use your remaining Ancient Artefacts.
- Use your remaining Tomatoes, Ice Lollies and American Footballs.
- Use your remaining Water Pistol ammo.
- Use your remaining Soda Cans.
- Use your remaining Weedkiller ammo to attack the Giant Spider, and probably
 die.

If you started on level 41 or level 45, then use of the following weapon
sequence while making good use of Decoy Clowns is probably the nearest you will
get to a reliable strategy:

- Use your Pandora&apos;s box(es) first.
- Use all your Bazooka shells.
- Waste as much time as possible using your Mystery Potions.
- Clear a few strips of floor in the centre of the arena with your Weedkiller.
- Use your Monster Potions.
- Use your Plates.
- Use any remaining Silverware.
- Use your Ancient Artefacts.
- Use your Weedkiller on the Giant Spider itself.
- Use your Ice Lollies and American Footballs.
- Finish by using your Water Pistol.

-----

STRATEGY THREE: Wait, Sweep, and Kill.

[Partially reproduced from the Boss Guide to Dr. Bug]

Waste time until he&apos;s covered the floor in sticky cobwebs, and then clean them
all up and kill him without having to move at horribly slow speed. Decoy Clowns
may help in this strategy, especially while you&apos;re using your Weedkiller. After
you&apos;ve finished clearing away the cobwebs, pretty much any of the weapons
listed above are good ones to use. But how should you waste time in the first
place? Just standing in a corner and shooting at the Spiders which approach
will not work, as the cobwebs will only be scattered around the area where
you&apos;re standing.

You should certainly have at least a couple of Mystery Potions; try wandering
around and occasionally drinking them, and see what happens. Delay a suitable
amount of time between each drink, in order to make the most of the occasional
health refill you&apos;ll receive. If you have any ghost potions left, you could
take those and just sit around. If you really have a lot of Monster Potions
(more than seven), then you could take one and just idly punch the Giant Spider
as it occasionally hurtles past, while you wait in the middle of the arena.

For those who started on level 45, as explained in the Weapon Sequence list
above, you are best off using first your Pandora&apos;s Boxes; then using your
remaining Bazookas; and finally stretching out your Mystery Potions over as
long a time as you safely can. When you have finished with all that, clear the
centre of the room with your Weedkiller, moving outwards as you go - this
ensures that you clear a useful part of the arena. You don&apos;t want to clear the
entire western side, run out of Weedkiller ammo, and then find that the Giant
Spider spends all his time over on the eastern side as you sit around with your
Monster Potion time draining away...

-----

AFTER THE GIANT SPIDER IS DEFEATED

It&apos;s obvious enough when you&apos;ve finished the Giant Spider off, as he&apos;ll light
up orange and start exploding. You need to try and get away from him at this
point; Dr. Tongue will reappear, and when you are near enough he&apos;ll drink
another potion, and assume the Giant Head form. However, if you stay far enough
away, it gives you a chance to sweep up as many of the remaining weeds as you
can. Obviously, if you have just drunk a Monster Potion, you may as well get
Dr. Tongue to take on the Giant Head form as soon as you can, in order not to
waste all your time as a Purple Monster. Assuming that&apos;s not the case, sweep up
the weeds, then approach, and you can start the second part of the boss...

-----

THE GIANT HEAD&apos;S HEALTH, AND HOW TO GAUGE IT

When you damage it, the Giant Head flashes yellow-green. (It will also flash in
this manner if you use the Fire Extinguisher or Martian Bubble Gun on it, even
though they have no effect.) The Giant Head moves through four distinct stages
of damage, looking progressively worse as you continue to damage it.

Stage one damage - Smooth-skinned head with warts. Unbroken glasses.
Stage two damage - Part of skull visible beneath scalp. Some warts bursting.
 Cracked glasses.
Stage three damage - Large amount of skull visible. Holes in head. Some skin
 melted and dribbling down side of head. Colourful, glowing
 eye sockets visible beneath fully broken glasses. Wires
 dangling from damaged right chin.
Stage four damage - Huge gaping hole in head, electronics visible inside.
 Metal jaw visible with no lower row of teeth. Lots of skin
 melted.

The amount of damage required to take the Giant Head on to each successive
stage of damage seems roughly equal.

-----

THE GIANT HEAD&apos;S MOVEMENTS AND ATTACKS

The Giant Head is able to move quite fast, like the Giant Spider, and so he is
difficult to hit. His movements grow faster and more erratic as you damage him
more and more. Unlike the Giant Spider, he does not have any attacks that slow
your movement. However, he is able to barge into you at high speed and send you
flying across the arena, much like the American Footballers do - this does not
reduce your health.

He only has two other attacks: in damage stages one and two, he spits slime at
you (which is not hard to dodge); while in damage stages three and four, he
attacks you with eyeballs, which home in on you, much like the Vampires&apos; bat
missiles do, and will hit unless intercepted with your weapons. The Giant Head
is not as hard to defeat as the Giant Spider, due to his physical weakness and
rubbish attacks, although it can be tricky to pin him down and do damage to
him, especially towards the end.

-----

GIANT HEAD - WEAPONS AND ITEMS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

[In recommended approximate order of use]

PLATES AND SILVERWARE: These are very effective against the Giant Head, so
under most circumstances you should use them first thing. However, once he gets
to stage three damage, he starts to move rather too quickly for your Plates and
Silverware to hit, so don&apos;t carry on trying to use them; go on to using the
Water Pistol instead. If you&apos;re desperately low on health when you start, use
any remaining Monster Potions first; then go on to either the Plates and
Silverware, or the Water Pistol, depending on how well you do.

MONSTER POTION: If you have any left, use them. Note that while it is not
possible to corner the Giant Head, it does sometimes seem to get confused if
you walk up to it and start punching, so you may have some luck backing it into
a corner.

BAZOOKA, FLAMETHROWER, PANDORA&apos;S BOXES: If you still have some of these, then
let him have it.

MYSTERY POTION: If you have any left, use them once you&apos;re out of other
options, as you might get lucky and turn into the Purple Monster.

DECOY CLOWNS: These act as a distraction; he&apos;ll use his slime attacks and
eyeball attacks on them sometimes, instead of you. Go ahead and use them if you
have any left.

WATER PISTOL: Surprisingly, your starting weapon is very good against the Giant
Head, and is accurate enough to be useable when the Plates start to fail in
that department (you have a large amount of ammo - hopefully - and it doesn&apos;t
matter if a few shots miss here and there). You should still have some left, so
once he&apos;s gotten to stage three damage, you can, er, squirt him to death...

SODA CANS: These can be useful, but only if you are hiding in the alcove in the
northeast. (See strategy five below.)

ICE LOLLIES, TOMATOES, AMERICAN FOOTBALLS: These will hurt him, but you should
try and exhaust your other options first.

AND THOSE YOU SHOULDN&apos;T: Ancient Artefacts, Weedkiller (too close-range - he&apos;ll
throw you out of his way anyway), Soda Cans (too inaccurate).

-----

STRATEGY FOUR: Giant Head Weapon Sequence

- Sweep up the sticky cobwebs on the floor with your Weedkiller (preferably
 before allowing Dr. Tongue to drink his second potion).
- Use your remaining Plates and Silverware, until he reaches stage three
 damage.
- Use your remaining Monster Potions.
- Use your remaining Pandora&apos;s Boxes, Bazookas and Flamethrower ammo.
- Hide in the northeast alcove and use your remaining Water Pistol ammo.
- Use your remaining Mystery Potions.
- Hide in the northeast alcove and use your remaining Soda Cans.
- Use your remaining weak weapons (Ice Lollies, etc.)

-----

STRATEGY FIVE: Stay in the Corner

The Giant Head&apos;s attacks - in particular, his eyeball attack - are most
effective when you are in the middle of the arena, with no defensive walls
around you. But, there is an alcove in the northeast corner of the arena in
which you can shield yourself from the eyeball attack; go in there and stand
next to the southern wall. The eyeballs will not often hit you here, as they
fall apart when they hit walls, and they are likely to strike the walls first
here rather than go straight for you. Hiding in this area also allows you to
shoot at the Giant Head with projectile weapons - or even the Soda Cans - as he
passes the opening into the arena to your west, without taking any great risks.

-----

AFTER HE&apos;S DEAD

It&apos;s obvious enough when you&apos;ve finally killed Dr. Tongue, because the Giant
Head turns to an interesting assortment of fluorescent colours and explodes.
There are no more Monsters let out after he dies, so just go straight for the
final Victim. Walk up to the northern wall of the arena and you&apos;ll find that
the barrier has disappeared; walk through the doorway into the stone dungeon,
and then walk west to find a Cheerleader (A) at the other end of it. The Exit
Door now appears; there&apos;s nothing more to do on this level, so go through. Note
that if you intend to collect as many Victims as possible, you will need to get
off to a quick start on the credits level (which commences after the victory
screen), but Speed Shoes are not necessary.

Well done - you have destroyed Dr. Tongue, and successfully defended your
neighbourhood and its inhabitants from the menace of his army of Monsters! Now,
enjoy the victory screen, as you see how well you did against all the different
varieties of Monsters...

48-B) CREDIT LEVEL: MONSTERS AMONG US srch3b48

-----

DIFFICULTY: 2/10

Set in the LucasArts offices, this is a nice, relaxed, low-key way to end the
game. None of the Victims are in any danger, although you do need to go after
the Tourists as you begin. There&apos;s a Miniature Flying Head making a nuisance of
itself, which you can kill if you want (it isn&apos;t very tough). I think it&apos;s one
of the bosses at LucasArts. Get it? Boss?

MONSTER LIST: Evil Dolls (intensity: medium, location: one place)
 Fire Babies (from Evil Dolls only)
 Jelly Blobs (intensity: low, location: one place)
 Miniature Flying Head
 Tentacles (intensity: very low, location: around the southern
 part of the building)
 Werewolves (source: from Tourists only after 38 seconds: 4, 5 and
 8)
 Zombies [Vicious] (intensity: very low, location: one place)

VICTIM LIST:

 A) Cheerleader - In the office in the northeast corner of the building.
 2) Explorer - East of a patch of weeds, in the garden outside the building on
 the south side.
 3) Baby - In a cubicle on the southern side of the building.
 4) Tourists - In an office in the southeast corner of the building, standing
 by a First Aid Kit.
 5) Tourists - On the pavement, north of where you start.
 6) Cheerleader - In the same office as the other Cheerleader (A), to her
 northwest.
 7) Baby - In an empty office in the northwest corner of the building, standing
 by a Martian Bubble Gun.
 8) Tourists - Standing by a LucasArts employee at the entrance to the
 building, south of where you start.
 9) Dog - Behind a locked door, in an office containing Bonus Points Pickups,
 at the northern edge of the building.
10) Teacher - Standing at the edge of the pavement, just north of where you
 start.

IMPORTANT PICKUPS: First Aid Kit
 Weedkiller
 Monster Potion - needed to rescue the Dog (9) if you have no
 Keys

BONUSES AVAILABLE: None (there is no bonus screen at the end of the level)

BEST PLACE TO SCORE BONUS POINTS: There&apos;s nowhere you can earn good points, and
no point in trying either - it&apos;s the final level, and so an Extra Bonus Victim
wouldn&apos;t mean anything even if you could earn one. Get as many of the Victims
as you can and then leave.

-----

PREAMBLE:

1. There are three Tourist Couples (4, 5 and 8) on this level, but you have a
lenient time limit of 38 seconds in which to save them all. Speed Shoes are not
necessary. You will find many LucasArts employees as you move through the
level; don&apos;t mistake these for Victims, as they cannot be&quot;saved&quot;, nor do the
Monsters even take any notice of them. As you pass them, they will&quot;speak&quot;to
you (via a message bar at the top of the screen), to tell you about the part
they played in making the game, or just to give you a message; when this
happens, the game pauses. The quickest way of skipping past this is to relax
the movement controls momentarily when they start speaking, then press them
down again. Don&apos;t get distracted by this novelty until you&apos;ve saved the
Tourists! (What do you think this is, a game?!)

TOURIST-WEREWOLVES:

2. Walk north to find first a Teacher (10), then Tourists (5) standing on the
pavement. Having collected both Victims, walk south along the pavement to come
to an entrance into the large building to the east. Walk in, past the LucasArts
employee, and collect the Tourists (8) standing behind him. Continue east
across the office floor; you will pass a chest and a sarcophagus to the north,
followed by a spider&apos;s thread visible across the ceiling, and a large hole in a
wall.

3. You will then pass another LucasArts employee to the south, holding a whip;
continue past him, then past a strange lizard-like employee to the north. Carry
on east across another part of the office, and you will come to an entrance to
a small room in the southeast corner of the building. Inside is a final Tourist
Couple (4), standing by a First Aid Kit.

VICTIMS:

4. Go out of the small room, past the LucasArts employee holding an axe, and
step north and into the next doorway you see to the east. In the opposite
corner of this room is a Weedkiller pickup. Collect it, then head out of that
room and west across the office; go south around the lizard creature, and carry
on west past the man holding the whip, and a partition wall to the south. Now
go south into a cubicle and you will find a Baby (3) there. Collect him and
head north out of there again; carry on west and into the next room to the
south, and you will find a Monster Potion on the floor in the southwest corner.

5. Go out of the room via the doorway to the north, east past the cubicle to
the south which contained the Baby (3), and then south past the employee
holding a whip and out into a garden, filled with weeds. Sweep south around the
pot plants and east across the weeds, to find an Explorer at the eastern end of
the garden. Collect him and then head into the little room to the north to find
a Pandora&apos;s Box and a Cupboard. Return south out of that room, west across the
path you cleared through the weeds, and north back into the main part of the
building.

6. Head north past the whip guy and east past the lizard, over to the entrance
to the room where that last Tourist Couple (4) was, with the woman with the axe
standing there. Head north here, past a couple of rooms to the east, and then
head into the third one, which holds an employee who appears to be a
jack-in-the-box. There are two Cheerleaders (A and 6) in here, one (A) opposite
the entrance, the other (6) to the north of the jack-in-the-box.

7. Head west out of the office and along a corridor, until you come to a locked
door to the north. At this point, the Miniature Flying Head attacks from the
entrance of the office to the southwest. Drink your Monster Potion, bash down
the entrance to the door, and rush in to save the Dog (9) inside. You can now
turn your attention to the Miniature Flying Head; give him a good bashing and
he&apos;ll blow up. Note that pushing him all the way into a corner of the room
won&apos;t work; your fists need to land on him as he&apos;s a particular distance away
from you, so you will have to allow him to fly back and forth just a little
bit. You can tell when you&apos;re damaging him because he will flash blue.

8. If you change back into human form before the Head is dead, use your
Pandora&apos;s Box on him and then finish him off with your Water Pistol. Collect
the Bonus Points Pickups inside the room where the Dog (8) was, if you want to
boost your score for its own sake, and then head out and go west along the
corridor. At the far end, head northwest around a couple of bends into an empty
room. There&apos;s a Baby (7) in here, standing by a Martian Bubble Gun.

AFTER FINISHING:

9. Assuming you don&apos;t want to spend more time on this level learning about the
makers of the game, exit now. The game ends here; provided that you got into
the high score table, you&apos;ll be asked to enter your name (or both your names,
in succession, if you were playing in two-player mode). You&apos;ll also be shown
where you ranked on the table. Congratulations! You have entirely completed
Zombies!

10. Now, if you&apos;re still hungry for more, you could perhaps try playing through
again, saving more of the Victims; or you could start on a later level than you
did this time (assuming you didn&apos;t start on level 45, or the credit level
itself), and try and defeat the final boss, having had fewer opportunities to
collect helpful items. Or maybe you could do both at the same time. Whatever
you do, have fun...

Use these passwords to get to any of the listed levels, with any number of

*Day Of The Tentacle may be reached by entering this password, then selecting
to&quot;START&quot;as usual once you are returned to the title screen. DOTT may only be
accessed in this way with all ten Victims. Also, you&apos;ll go to level 1 after you
finish DOTT, giving you the opportunity to return for a second visit (with all
the Victims you&apos;re due, and all the pickups, replaced) by collecting the Bonus
Level Pickup.

**Additional secret passwords - Thanks go to Mike McCane for sending me the
original ten-Victim password for level 33-B. I have since used it to obtain the
passwords for level 33-B with other numbers of Victims. These start you off on
level 33&apos;s Bonus Level,&quot;Curse of the Pharaohs&quot;, after which you play through
level 9-B (&quot;Mushroom Men&quot;) and level 12-B (&quot;Cheerleaders Versus the Monsters&quot;).
Unfortunately, the game packs up after that - it just sits there with a blank
screen, forcing you to reset it.

Author of the only other FAQ for this game currently hosted on GameFAQs. I
found out from his guide that the plates are good weapons to use against the

reading others&apos; work for inspiration - I only skimmed his FAQ to gauge its
content, and I felt it was necessary to note the source of this information
here. So, thanks.

Sent me a secret password that allows you to play through three of the Bonus
Levels (33-B, 9-B and 12-B), starting with ten Victims, before the game locks
up. See the&quot;Passwords&quot;section near the top of the FAQ.
