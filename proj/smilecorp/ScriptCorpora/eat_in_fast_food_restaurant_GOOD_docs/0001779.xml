 Fast-Food Restaurants in Zurich Hi you guys 
I&apos;d like to introduce myself first of all. I&apos;m ismahane, 24 years from Morocco. I live in Zurich now because of my occupation.
In other cities where I stayed, I always had some favourite fast-food locations. I&apos;m still searching them in Zurich, but I found a video on SF videoplayer ( http://videoportal.sf.tv/video?id=59...6-2bb33dc99c45 ) at minute 6:19 they introduce three fast-food locations. Does somebody know, where I can find them? I asked on a mail the Swiss Television and all they could say, that it was 2006 and the fast-food restaurants were around Langstrasse/Limatplatz. Please, can you guys help me to find them or do you know them?
Thank you
ismahane

 Re: Fast-Food Restaurants in Zurich I&apos;ve been to them but for the life of me, can&apos;t quite recall their names at the moment - maybe someone more familiar can point out the precise locations and names.

Select gastronomy to hover the mouse to reveal the names.

 Thank you, I found an Indian supermarkt that does take-away on Josefstrasse 91. And the first&quot;kebap&quot;place could be New Point. On the beginning of Langstrasse I found three Chinese places. Ok, thank you very much for helping me.
