   Burger King Pulls Mary J. Blige Ad [Video]
 Posted: April 4, 2012 
 

A new Burger King ad featuring Mary J. Blige singing about fried chicken has been pulled by the fast food restaurant. The company said that the commercial was taken off the air because of music licensing issues, but because it had been criticized for being racist.
 
Burger King said that it hopes to have the ad back on the air soon after the licensing issues are resolved.

But Burger King may want to just get rid of the ad since several people have criticized the TV spot for being racist. Madame Noire, a lifestyle publication for black women, wrote an open letter to Burger King, saying :
 
“Having a black woman sing about chicken was no mistake. They’re trying to reach the ‘urban’ (aka black) demographic and they used you. Because God knows black folk won’t buy anything unless there’s a song, and preferably a dance, attached to it.”
 
Burger King, which recently fell behind Wendy’s as the second biggest burger chain, recently released a new menu. The Mary J. Blige commercial was used to promote Burger King’s new premium chicken strips. David Beckham, Salma Hayek, and Jay Leno have also created ads for the new menu.

Here’s Mary J. Blige’s Burger King ad.

 

If the video above doesn’t play, here’s another version from TMZ .

 

Do you think the ad is racist?

[Update: Burger King has released an apology for releasing an &quot;unfinished&quot; commercial. ]

Are you effing serious this is not racist, the fact that this womens group is trying to make it out to be shows how narrow minded they are, I am not black and I can sure get down on some chicken, I think the ad is witty and the criticism is misdirected and just needs to stop, this is 2012 not the 1960&apos;s get over it!

Firstly, the song is about the content of the desired entree, and Mary does a hell of job belting out crisp chicken, NATO and cheese and all that. How many of you remember,&apos;Two all need parties, special sauce lettuce cheese….?&apos;Secondly, we have to stop being overly critical about advertisements. Yes, its true, most black people like fried chicken, but most black people prefer home cooked fried chicken over the King of Burgers. And Lastly, its MJB! I&apos;m convinced that if anyone has our back in protecting women of color from negative stereotypes, its Mary!

There is nothing Racist about it at all…it&apos;s chicken for crying out loud! I personally just don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good commercial for her, but black people aren&apos;t the only ones that eat Fried chicken…woooow! People really need to lay off the drugs cause it&apos;s frying your brain cells…or get a hobby and stop caring about stupid ish!

Not racist at all. Plus where did people get fried chicken from?? She&apos;s saying crispy chicken not fried chicken. This is a bk ad not a kfc ad smh. I think people think its racists because she&apos;s a celeb. Now if she was a regular black person like the black lady doing the popeyes commercial,there wouldn&apos;t be an issue. I guess we&apos;re all getting bored and need to complain about something

Now that i think about it,wasn&apos;t there black people in the mcdonalds chicken snack wrap commercial! Since we&apos;re on this racial thing. Back in the slavery days when rich white people had black women as maids cleaning and stuff,i didn&apos;t see any controversy when a black woman doing a pinesol commercial.they said black people love chicken. I&apos;m white and i love chicken too

I don&apos;t think it&apos;s racist either. The article clearly states it will be back on after the technicalities are cleared up

I say its just plain old racism…from Madame Noire! If the individual who wrote the letter can&apos;t see people of different ethnicities living and working together without there being a racist underpinning to it, then the one who is racist is the letter writer….particularly when all the rest of us see is a former celebrity doing a commercial. They were spouting the same words that come from the mouths of the KKK, and they should be called on it.

OK, I just watched the video. I had no problem with it. Period. As you may not be aware, I am a dude of a darker hue. I still like chicken like the majority of people (two (2) key words: majority, and people). I haven&apos;t grabbed my sword and shield over this commercial at all. If any hint of racial stereotype is present, it is that delivered by Burger King&apos;s choice of singer. Like watermelon is to…summer, Mary J. Blige is an R&amp;B singer, typically associated with the black community. While her voice/music is appreciated by all, she still is supported by a large black following. Her style and delivery is&quot;black&quot;. Always has been. That&apos;s no mystery. If not for Burger King&apos;s advertising execs having the customers in the piece being predominately white, with an a cast of customers in a darker hue, it would then be accepted as appropriate for broadcast on, say, BET, and other predominately black outlets. In this great country of ours, it is sad we have become so super-sensitive here. I am of the opinion should it have been Adele singing the chicken piece, we would all be clammering over to Burger King since Adele crosses all music genres AND ethnicities. I wonder if the argument of racism would rear it&apos;s ugly head again since few blacks were customers in the piece. Get over it people.

Really? I&apos;m not a Burger King fan, but I do enjoy Mary J&apos;s music. This argument over this particular commercial being racist is beyond ludacris and I&apos;m sure that if she felt that it was degrading, she wouldn&apos;t have done it.

I don&apos;t know who writes this garbage but isn&apos;t it just as racist to stereotype&quot;the urban demographic&quot;as being comprised of black people or to suggest that white people are too rich to need burger king? How exactly are they reaching out toward the&quot;urban&quot;(a.k.a. black) customer with a commercial that clearly shows a white guy ordering? Aren&apos;t they really saying Mary J. Blige and all of her handlers are too stupid to realize that Burger King tricked her into singing a song about chicken because they are racist white people?

There are plenty of&quot;white folk&quot;in the commercial, too. Every time someone whines about racism, it&apos;s always the same: they just want attention for themselves. Noire can bite my chicken wings.

Oh pu-lease…This is not even close to racist. I read the open letter in full. ( http://madamenoire.com/152765/an-open-letter-to-mary-j-blige-re-her-buffoonish-burger-king-commercial/ ) I do not understand why anyone is seriously addressing this letter. This letter is full of grammatical errors, that alone should disqualify it from any meaningful conversation. She states in the letter,&quot;And you know what desperate execs do when they need to make money? They hurriedly throw together clichéd, often stereotypical, advertising campaigns. “. Oh Really? Does she even watch BET? Every other commercial is your clichéd, often stereotypical, advertising campaign. Where is the outrage against those commercials? She also is also quoted with&quot;but as a black woman, singing passionately about chicken is not the move!” This quote is the most ridiculous statement in the whole letter. Do advertising executives need to avoid any and all stereotypical links? What is next? Asians not allowed to appear in an Asian food ad? White blond girls are not allowed to play the “dumb blond” role? Avoid showing black kids playing basketball in a park? Where was Madame Noire’s outrage with Jennifer Lopez’ Fiat commercial where they show every stereotypical aspect of New York City?

Racist (adj.) The belief that a race accounts for differences in human behavior or ability
Look harder at this video. The media expects us to eat this up in ignorance. Many stereotypes are present in this video and you would catch them if you compare this video to the rest of the new BK ads. First, the white gentleman kindly and clearly asks what is in the chicken wrap. Before the cashier can answer, someone loudly and rudely interrupts asking the same yet&quot;simplified&quot;question. Of course, it&apos;s a black woman, which the cashier is not excited to introduce, despite it being musical legend, Mary J. Blidge. The commercial continues to show the cashier reluctantly give the stage to Blidge followed by a hip hop inspired jingle. The silly song plays as the all-white crowd seemingly mocks hip hop culture by making odd rap faces and&quot;raising the roof&quot;. I don&apos;t believe the commercial is racist but is highly insensitive giving it a rather questionable underlying tone. Make no mistake, there is a reason why they released an apology to the public. And it&apos;s not because anyone cares about a licensing mishap.

How can you give valid input regarding a commercial geared toward the african american community? Seeing as you are not the targeted demographic, I doubt this commercial would have any negative impact on you since you are not regularly cast in to these stereotypes. By definition, this commercial IS racist.
 Brian L. Johnson

Mary J Blidge admitted that BK informed her the commercial was going to be different than how it turned out. There has to be a problem when even Mary J Blidge apologizes to her fans for the commercial.

Michelle Garcia LOL Sadly, thats not how the advertising industry works. There are a variety of different BK ads geared for different demographics. Please lookup the word&quot;demographic&quot;. Thats the industry. It&apos;s not even a matter of opinion. Every ad in the world has a target audience and&quot;anyone who has money in their pocket and wants some chicken&quot;is not a valid demographic. PLEASE RESEARCH THE TOPIC. Watch the other videos. And read the articles about why they pulled it. Mary J Blidge herself apologized to her fans for the ad. Why do you think that was? If anything, you should try being OPEN MINDED and imagine what it&apos;s like to be an educated, and respectable African American male who has to constantly witness his people cast into hip hop and chicken stereotypes. Not to mention that in a time where racial profiling has proven to be most perilous, this stereotypical ad certainly does not help the current racial climate in this country.

This commercial is only racist if people WANT it to be racist. The only way this is racist is if people actually agree with the stereotype that they are trying to connect to this ad. Come on, do you REALLY think that Mary would have agreed to do the commercial if she felt she was being insulted in any way? So, if she was singing about a fish wrap would that be alright or would be some hidden insult to women? BK simply had a new item and they wanted Mary to advertise it. I&apos;m not understanding the reason for the stupid controversy.

Brian L. Johnson so let me ask you this if it was a white woman from a singing background would you still say it was racist no you wouldn&apos;t we as meaning white people eat and love chicken just as much as you meaning African Americans and I think the reason behind her saying sorry for the ad was so It wouln&apos;t blow up and bigger then it did its better to say sorry and move on then to keep blowing it up to be bigger
