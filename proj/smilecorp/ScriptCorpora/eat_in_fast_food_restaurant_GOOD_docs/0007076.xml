 It&apos;s good manners to clear up mess that you make.

It&apos;s nothing to do with whether there is somebody else who can do it for you.

If they give me something I&apos;ve not ordered I ask for it to be changed, I&apos;m happy to do this 2 or 3 times at which point I ask for a refund.

Its not rocket science is it?

 yappy.. are you a sock puppet? You often seem to make contentious statements and I wonder if you&apos;re simply trying to wind people up. genuine question BTW

 Join Date: Jan 2009 Posts: 754 I always clear away my tray I couldn&apos;t just leave it there on the table, I think about the people that come after me who would have to clean it up or the poor staff that work in those places.

I&apos;m also the type of person if i go into a shop and there clothes etc on the floor i pick it up too ( im a nightmare in primark my mates say )
I picked up some clothes in a sports shop once&amp;hanged it up the man asked me if i was trying to steal his job lol

All the restaurants I&apos;ve been in have waiters/waitresses to serve my meal to me and clear away when I&apos;ve finished.

 Seems to be beyond some. 

I think we need a new comparison,&quot;rocket science&quot;is way, way too far advanced.
Something like&quot;it&apos;s not walking upright is it?&quot;

Though I fear some will still fail to grasp it.

 but the bin is normally on the way out of the establishment. why not just bring it with you and dump it on your way out?

It&apos;s so easy and it&apos;s common courtesy. No need to be a lazy, scabby mess.

 Bins are provided, which usually have something like&quot;Thank You&quot;written on them. It is certainly implied that they want you to clear up after yourself. The fact that you choose not to means that, in addition to emptying the bins and wiping the tables, cleaning the toilets, they also have to tidy up after people like you.

 because i dont usally look around for bins

and plus if you have loads of food on trays its difficult to dump leftovers on the tray in the bin

if i ever do dump rubbish in the bin, the tray will go with it

 walking upright ? I&apos;d say the OP probably has calluses on his knuckles from where they drag on the floor

 they might say thank you but theres no sign that says &apos;please clear away your rubbish&apos;

and so? they get paid for it. it&apos;s called work. if they are too lazy to do their job then im sure there will be someone else out there who wants it (and not me btw)

 I know it&apos;s effort, but perhaps you could, y&apos;know, look for them. I bet it wouldn&apos;t take very long, either!

 I suppose you smoke (or would smoke) in front of signs which read&quot;Thank you for not smoking&quot;.
