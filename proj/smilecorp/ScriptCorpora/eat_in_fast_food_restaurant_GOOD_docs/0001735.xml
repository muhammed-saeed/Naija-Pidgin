Last night I received a coupon via e-mail from Pick Up Stix for two chicken entrees for the price of one, I said to myself, what the heck not. Dinner tomorrow and lunch the next day.

So, I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken with vegetables and the Honey Crispy Chicken, one of my favorites and I had both with steamed brown rice. I first dug into the Kung Pao.( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ) It was great with just the right amount of spice. I accidently bit into one of the dried chili pods and man, that sure turned up the heat. The kung Pao had a nice smokey flavor and the chicken and veggies were great.

The Honey Crispy Chicken was perfect. The chicken morsels had a perfect crunch on the outside and the inside was nice and tender. The hint of honey came through nicely and was not overwhelming. Good stuff! ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ) The brown steamed rice was  nicely steamed and plentiful.

The whole meal with the coupon only cost just a little over, including a medium iced tea, $10 with tax. I recommend you sign up for their e-club because they are always sending members great coupons.

The service was smiley and polite. I left happy because I had a good meal, full, and had plenty of left overs for lunch tomorrow. Yippee!

Honey Crispy Chicken is good!

Ugh! The chow mein tasted burned and plasticky. It tasted like they burned something on the grill or pan, then cooked new food without cleaning it so it had a burned aftertaste. We got the family pack. Other times, it&apos;s been fine.

Everything is just okay, nothing to write about.  The service is good, tables are clean but the food has really lost alot of it&apos;s flavor.  It hurt the most when they removed the &quot;hot-n-sour&quot; soup from the menu.  I&apos;ll be back and continue to hope for the best.

Tastier and Cheaper than PF Changs, and if I&apos;m feeling a little more indulgent than Panda Express, I come here!

I love both the Orange and Lemon Chickens, with either a choice of brown or white rice. If I&apos;m feeling totally Asian, I&apos;ll stick to white, and if I&apos;m feeling the health kick, I&apos;ll go with the brown, lol...and sometimes, I&apos;ll add in the tasty cream cheese fried wontons. So yummy, and you can have Chinese food without those wacky fortune cookies, heheh :P

Whenever I&apos;m craving Chinese Food in SD, this is definitely my go to place :)p *Feels all warm and fuzzy*

Delicious food. Wonton Wednesday is great and any other day, house chicken is a great way to go! Also great service, especially by one of the workers, I believe his name was DP. He&apos;s always polite, patient and helpful when it came to suggestions on what I should order. I also noticed that when it got a little more busy, he kept very calm and collected and delivered great service.

The kung pao chicken here is better than I thought it would be, but still a bit fatty.  I like my meat lean, and that&apos;s usually a tall order in Chinese food places.  Also the fried rice I got was cold.  Fried rice should be hot, and I prefer it not to be swimming in peas.  Reasonably affordable though.  Definitely disagree with Kim T on it being tastier than PF Chang&apos;s.  Not even close.

So the family and I were in search of some fast food Chinese Food and instead of heading to old faithful Panda Express, we stopped by Pick Up Stix. The locoation on Fletcher Pkwy is clean and the staff were that day very friendly. We ordered the family special with House Chicken, House Noodles, and Orange Chicken with some brown rice. The order was quick and the items we ordered were actually tasted pretty good. The House Chicken was my top choice on this visit. A winner over in my book.

The good: accommodating service and good fast Chinese food
The bad: the portions needed to be a little bigger.

Probably one of the worst Chinese places I&apos;ve ever been to. Way overpriced, and mediocre food. Definitely don&apos;t get the chow main, it&apos;s like thick spaghetti with soy sauce.  2 entrees + 1 drink = $30! Go to Panda Express.

I know, I know.... Pick Up Stix isn&apos;t &apos;authentic Chinese&apos; food. In fact, it&apos;s about as &apos;authentic Chinese&apos; as the Mexicans in the kitchen cooking it up. But, I like it regardless. With the limited options of good Chinese food in San Diego, or lack thereof, I will usually seek out a Pick Up Stix when I wanna chow down on some Chow Mein. There are Pick Up Stixes sprinkled all throughout the city, and it seems like no matter where I am when the craving hits, there&apos;s always one within close proximity. However, the one closest to home is the one I frequent most often.

The food is good, not great. But it sure as shit beats eating at the Panda Express. I don&apos;t like their lunch specials (small portions don&apos;t satisfy), they&apos;re not that great of a deal. I like lots of food. The broccoli beef and orange peel chicken are quite enjoyable. The kung-pao chicken is okay as well. The brown rice isn&apos;t very tasty, not to say it tastes bad, it just doesn&apos;t taste like much. Still, I order it every single time.

Last time I went I didn&apos;t get any fortune cookies, which made my meal feel incomplete. We all know that the best part about Chinese food is the cookie that predicts your future. Right?

I don&apos;t know why I came back here--but more importantly, why did those other two hundred or so customers storm this place?!  I mean there were non stop lines the whole time I was here--you&apos;d think Mr A&apos;s was having a $5 dinner special instead of this chain joint!

I forgot how spicy the orange peel chicken was when i ordered it off the &quot;Dragon Deals&quot; specials so it got me again (see previous review).  It came with about a fourth cup of lettuce salad with a lime-cilantro dressing.  I don&apos;t know if the dressing was really spicy or if my mouth was just on fire from the orange peel chicken when I took bites of lettuce.  The rice was still bland.  I looked wistfully over at Chipotle as I walked back out to my car with my tummy roiling, to see that they had few customers, and knowing I would have been much happier if I&apos;d gotten the Carnitas Bowl with guacamole (my &quot;usual&quot;) instead, plus I would have had leftovers for the next day.  When will I learn?

Ok I just went for honeydew mellon boba tea and made the mistake of dropping it right outside the door. After mourning my awesome boba tea I went back in expecting to order another and they were awesome enough to replace it free of charge. That was really unexpected and shows their amazing dedication to customer service.

My stomach churns as I write this...

My sister gets on these food kicks where all she wants is a particular item from a specific restaurant for weeks on end until she gets tired of it. This time she was on a Pick Up Stix kick where the only thing she wanted to eat was their House Special Chicken. I being the good sister I am, took her to pick up stix since I&apos;ve never tried their food. I figured I&apos;d give it a whirl since she constantly raved about it. We both ordered the House Special Chicken since it&apos;s their claim to fame and obviously she was obsessed.  I dont know what the hell they put in their food or if it wasn&apos;t cooked correctly, but we both got soooooo sick. It may have been a fluke, but some places can never be redeemed and earn my business again after I was as sick as I was. I dont know about my sister, but after that experience, I will never be back.  ~ Yuck!

This place is pretty good for Chinese fast food, far better than Panda Express. I almost always get the house chicken or the house beef with brown rice. I enjoy it and the prices are good. They have coupons in the paper every week and if you go during the day the lunch specials are very well priced.

The service is usually fairly fast unless it is incredibly busy. Call ahead to have your food ready for pickup or dine in when you get there.

I really dislike this place and as all the Pick Up Stix chain restaurants.  I love Asian food and being half Asian helps.  This place uses cheap meats, tough veggies (sometimes not fully cooked), bland sauces, and untraditional menu items.  I&apos;d rather eat at the Panda King Chinese Restaurant than here.  Now that&apos;s bad.  :-D

If you&apos;re into Chinese food then there are so many other restaurants around La Mesa and San Diego that blow any of these chain restaurants out of the water with both service and food.  Don&apos;t waste your time.....

I was turned off by this place before even going to it because my boyfriend told me a horrid story about him and his friend who ate at this pick-up-stix and both got terribly sick from it. I guess they both ordered some seafood dish (which has since been discontinued) that they said tasted amazing, however that night (and into the next day) they were vomiting their guts out.

So I was a bit surprised when my boyfriend suggested we grab lunch here a few days ago. I love Chinese food even if it isn&apos;t authentic. Put some veggies over noodles or rice and I&apos;m sold!

From the bat I noticed that this place was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon. However the cashier was very nice and professional. For the price I expected our meals to be huge but when the food came out I found the portions to be quite small, even for a petite girl like me. I ended up cleaning my plate and yearning for more.

I got the Buddhas feast (or something like that), a vegetarian entree. It was pretty good. Nothing to write home about, and the portion was small. My boyfriend said he enjoyed his but didn&apos;t eat much.

At least we didn&apos;t get food poisoning, that would have severely affected my star count.

A-OK when you want fast Chinese food. The service is quick.

I usually shake up my order, trying to find something I truly love to order everytime, but I haven&apos;t found what I&apos;m looking for yet. But I keep trying!

I decided to go here because I had a $1 off coupon for their new spicy thai curry. I am a vegetarian, so I got it with tofu.

For $6.01 ($1 off plus tax)

Spicy thai curry tofu

Pros
1. Portion size. Not huge, but pretty decent sized so I saved half for later
2. Tofu was good
3. Had the option of getting brown rice
4. Had fresh veggies like watercress and green beans

Cons
1. Curry sauce. Not exactly spicy, but had a kick (what do I expect from a generic chain asian fast food restaurant) but had too much salt.

Overall, I would recommend it if you really like salty mildly spicy food.

The staff was friendly, they bring your food to the table, and free cups for water are always nice.

Haven&apos;t been to a Pick Up Stix in a while after a few ho-hum visits, but saw a BOGO coupon in the paper, so we decided to return. The service was incredible, and that was one of the reasons we stayed away. I&apos;m glad to see this was addressed. All employees were cheery, so perhaps a management change occurred.

Anyhow, the food was excellent and we will definitely be going back.

Pick Up Stix is pretty freaking tasty.  We had a coupon for a buy one get one free so we used it.  House beef and house chicken.  I dont care if its not authentic and its fast food etc.   Its good and cheap.  9 bucks for 2 entrees.  Mix a little of the red chili sauce in with your rice and chicken/beef and you are good to go.  The parking lot of this establishment sucks ass, but other than that its a place I frequent whenever I want Chinese food.

I have eaten here a long time ago, but recently came in again for some fast Asian food. Great prices and fast turnaround. A nice change from the fast food Burrito or Burger. Will try again soon. I give it the thumbs up! Especially with all the coupons they have rolling around!

I brought my daughter here last night because she wanted hot and sour soup and her favorite Dragon deal of honey chicken. I honestly confused this place with Panda Express, where I had delicious hot and sour soup. Anyway, customer service is great. Restaurant is clean. However, the food, in my opinion . . meh. The hot and sour soup is only served in a large container, but we were excited because we love that type of soup. Well, the broth was slightly sweet and sour, but more sour than it should have been. The soup also had large pieces of shrimp, chicken, and tofu. Although a nice touch, we were looking forward to the traditional type of simple hot and sour. Despite the extras, the taste wasn&apos;t all that great. I ordered a teriyaki vegetable bowl. The veggies did not seem very fresh (perhaps frozen) and lacked taste. My daughter&apos;s meal was, according to her, very good. So one star for her tasty  meal and one star for good customer service and, sorry, that&apos;s all I can give.

if you&apos;re not looking for &quot;real&quot; chinese food, and you just want something fast that is sort of a chinese food teaser, go here.  it&apos;s not authentic cuisine obviously, but it does taste better than a lot of it&apos;s fast food competition, and i personally prefer it over panda express any day.  get the lemon chicken.  pick up stix has passion tropical tea also, so if you&apos;re not looking for fast &quot;chinese&quot; food, you could always go in and get some awesome iced tea.

This place used to be decent but the past couple of times I&apos;ve been here, the service has not been good. To start, we had a buy one get one free entree. We ordered house special chicken, house special beef, lettuce wraps, and decided to throw in a couple wontons. Afterall, it is wonton Wednesday. The cashier said we couldn&apos;t get the wonton Wednesday special because we were using a coupon. Fine, so we didn&apos;t order the wontons and we were ok with it. Apparently the manager overheard and said it was ok to get them. So the cashier came to our table and we ended up adding on the wontons. Cool! So then the waitress (?) brought us our food, minus the meat for the lettuce wraps. Had to ask her for it multiple times before she understood what I was asking for. English was apparently not her first language. Also, the house special beef she brought out was only about 3/4 of the way full. So we mentioned it politely. She offered to have them fill it up, that was nice of her. I mean our order did get screwed up in the first place so why not take her up on her offer. She mentioned it to the manager, then he came over with the new house special beef and very sarcastically says, &quot;There&apos;s your FULL house special beef.&quot; we thanked him and he walked away without saying anything. Rude! While we ate our food, I caught him eyeballing us a few times. We paid over $20 for a couple dishes, is it too much to ask for the containers to actually be full and not get an attitude? I guess, I&apos;d be pissed too if I was a 60 year old man working at Pick Up Stix. This Pick Up Stix is notorious for only filling the containers part way. They make the other Pick Up Stix look bad. The food tasted ok, not the worst but not the best but good enough.

Ridiculously awful tiny portion for $8-$9 with taxes not including drinks. All entrees taste generally sweet especially the lo-mein.  It only filled half of my stomach up. I was still hungry after $8-$9 spent there. I&apos;ll stick around Panda&apos;s Express where I can get my portion worth the money.
