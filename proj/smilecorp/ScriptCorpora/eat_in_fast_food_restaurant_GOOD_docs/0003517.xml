Healthy Lunch Tips For the Busy Man

 By Darryl Banton 
 
The lunch meal is often treated by many as the one most dispensable during the day, because there is the thinking that this can be taken at a later time, or made up for later. With the busy and unpredictable schedules that most men have, later very often becomes never. It does not matter if a man works in management or is a front line employee - the temptation to skip the mid-day meal is present and vexing for all. There are occasions when circumstance dictates that the meal has to be missed altogether. Still, the matter of lunch is more than just the time away from work. This is the opportunity to refuel and refresh the body for the mental and physical tasks that will be encountered over the next several hours. What can be done to address the problems and difficulties of getting something to eat that is both quick and nutritious? In addition, how can a man who is eating in conjunction with a muscle training or conditioning program eat properly, and sensibly, as well?

There are a few options that busy men have in meeting the challenge of getting a somewhat quality meal during the period between breakfast and dinner. There is the possibility that prepared food can either be purchased ahead of the start of the work day, purchased at some point during the day itself, or prepared at home and brought to work (also known as &quot;brown bagging it&quot;). Probably the easiest of the three is to purchase lunch on the run, either at a fast food restaurant or at a convenience store. The problem that exists is that the items available at these places are prepared in high volume, with little regard for the actual amount of fat, salt, and sugar contained within them. This is true whether the items themselves are refrigerated, frozen, or kept in a warming tray or under a heat lamp. It is also true that these items will taste good when in a hurry and the immediate goal is to quiet a rumbling and eager stomach, but will not help the waistline measurement in the long term.

Instead of the burger and fries combination and the like that everyone is more than familiar with, there are healthier alternatives available, even at the drive through. Look for items that are grilled rather than fried. Consider a salad containing vegetables as well as meat, or a soup that is not heavy in cream or cheese. The trick here is to avoid the extra trimmings like bacon, cheese, and sauces that are loaded with additional calories. Another thing to be cautious of is the size of the portions in which food is served. It is true that there may some savings in time or money in ordering the larger selection, but any such savings are immediately lost if this defeats whatever efforts are being made to control weight and improve the physique. If possible, divide up the portion into smaller amounts, with part eaten immediately, and the rest saved for another serving later in the afternoon. It may be a very pleasant surprise to find that you may not have been as hungry as it seemed. At the same time, this only works when there is a careful effort to not be swayed by side items such as onion rings, other fried appetizers, a large regular drink and a dessert.

The topic of drinks is a special case, where one&apos;s diet can either be helped or hurt by what is selected. It is true that a diet soda may not add more calories to the meal, as opposed to a similarly sized regular cola. A large cup of ice water is always a good choice, with zero calories, with the added benefit of hydrating the body. If the blandness of water itself is a problem, try adding a lemon slice. If the lack of flavor is still an issue, another zero calorie option to consider is unsweetened iced tea. If it is absolutely necessary, a low calorie sweetner can be used to address the flavor issue.

There are some items which can be purchased ahead of time, yet still be kind to the diet and waistline. Such items include sandwiches and wraps, where the condiments such as mayonnaise are packaged separately from the food item. This is also true for salads and fruit cups. Again, it is necessary to be careful to note if the salad already has dressing mixed into it, as is often the case with macaroni, potato, chicken, or tuna salads. This might not seem like such a big deal, until the calorie and fat levels are considered. If it is not a problem to store it properly in a freezer or an ice chest during the day, a frozen meal or entrée might be a possibility to allow for the beginnings of a quick and complete lunch. As with other meals discussed, make sure that the lunch selectiion does not contain items loaded with excess fat, salt, or sugar. This may not be obvious until an examination is made of the ingredients list, if present. For example, if the item is breaded, there is a good chance that it has been fried, and that there is an overabundance of salt among the seasonings present. Salt is also an issue with soup, whether canned or frozen. If the meal contains any type of dessert, including cookies, cobbler, cake, brownie or pie, there is more than a little sugar and fat present as well.

The third option for the busy man in lunch options is to prepare something at home to eat at a convenient point in the day. This can be something as simple as a sandwich of one&apos;s choosing, or a container of leftovers from the previous night&apos;s dinner. The possibilities are limitless, as preferences and supplies can be the general guide followed. This is also useful if there is a particular type of eating practice being maintained or adhered to, as is found in keeping a kosher, vegetarian, or salt-free diet. The key to properly carrying out this option is to plan carefully for what the meals will look like, and to purchase the required ingredients ahead of time during trips to the supermarket. This also includes items for snacking in between meals, such as fruit, vegetables as carrots and celery, nuts, and string cheese. Whatever can be sensibly and reasonably be fit into a diet that helps the busy man to stay healthy and well-nourished is usually a good choice.

It is often difficult to fit the mid-day meal into the work day, but it is not impossible to create options to help address the challenge of having a proper lunch. Careful planning ahead of time, and observation of the available choices and portion sizes, are necessary when visiting fast-food resaturants. This is the case also at convenience stores, where there are many pre-prepared and packaged items that may need special scrutiny regarding what is actually in them, particularly with regard to the presence of fat, salt, and sugar, and the amount of calories to be consumed in a serving. A degree of self restraint is also required when faced with selecting items and portion sizes. The same amounts of care, in planning and preparation, are also as necessary when preparing food at home, to be eaten at a convenient time during the day.
