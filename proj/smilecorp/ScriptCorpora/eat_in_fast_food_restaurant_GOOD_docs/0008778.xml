SALT LAKE CITY—A Salt Lake man is facing a federal indictment stemming from a Dec. 23 bank robbery carried out by way of a napkin from a fast food restaurant.

Daniel Lamont Davis, 30, was indicted on one count of bank robbery for allegedly robbing a Wells Fargo Bank at 4920 S. State in Murray. Davis entered the business and presented the bank teller with a note written on a yellow Wendy&apos;s napkin demanding cash and threatening the teller, a complaint states.

The teller gave the man the cash and he left. At the time of the robbery, the robber was wearing a green coat, according to prosecutors. Photos from security cameras were disseminated to the media and Davis was identified as a possible suspect.

The teller picked Davis out of a photo lineup. He was arrested Dec. 25 and told officials he had nothing to do with the robbery. The arresting officers then pointed out that Davis had been booked into jail wearing the same green coat worn by the robber, leading Davis to confess to the robbery, the complaint states.

If convicted, Davis faces up to 20 years in prison.
