Walmart–Employees that suck!, Rude Customer Service and Untrustworthy Employees!

Everytime I have to go into Walmart I cringe.  The only reason I shop here is because its the only store in town.   I never know anyone when I go there and I always feel like an outsider.   As pissed as I was having to go there last night, I had to return because the cashier had told me I had gotten all my bags, when in reality, I really did not. So I had to make a second run to Walmart. In my head I was thinking“Oh great, I wonder what crappy customer service employee I will deal with into today?”

As I approach the customer service desk, I showed her my receipt and she acted like I had stolen these items. She then gets her“book”of what was known as“go backs”. This clearly was not good. I bet you can guess what happens next. I had to go back and find all of the items that the cashier did not give me the night before. Not only was I mad and pissed off, I still had to stop at the photo department to pick up my photos because they close at a 8.  What photo department closes at 8??

After finally getting the items back, as I was walking my baby had slipped his bottle throught the holes of the cart, and it had landed on the floor. The bottle had hit the floor and the formula went everywhere. I was looking for an employee to ask where paper towels would be, but that was a joke. When I had found paper towels, you wouldn’t believe that three employees had walked passed me, watched me clean the spill up, and never ever said one word!!!

Continuing onwards to the photo department, I had gotten to the counter and came across a sign that said to go get an employee to get your photos. Well now I am really pissed off. So go figure, its a joke trying to find an employee. After 10 minutes of finding the photo associate, he came over to find my photos.  I looked at the pictures, which came out horrible, so I gave them back to him. I tried to explain to him that they did not come out well, and he just stared into space and did not even listen or make eye contact.

I was finally able to get out of there and now I have a major migrain from the stress.  It was a nightmare, therefore I try to avoid Walmart as much as I can because the employees are so rude there and they never want to help a customer out!  My recommendation is that if you want good customer service you avoid Walmart!

Walmart tends to have the rudest, slimiest and nastiest employees of any company anywhere. I stopped going to the one near me because the workers were rude, crude and disgusting. These people probably don’t even wash after going to the bathroom–that would be asking for too much. Wal-Mart employees disgust me.

You can’t beat the prices and selection at Walmart!

The place is always packed!

This is old news dude, we all know that Wal-Mart employees suck. Just go to any Wal-Mart and see for yourself. They’re lazy, rude, crude and obnoxious! That’s why I don’t go to Wal-Mart and I pay a little more to go to Harris teeter and BJ’s where it’s cleaner, quieter and much nicer.

Wal-Mart is a unique place and a very unique environment. They have low, low prices but they also have low, low wages for their employees. Only the head manager at each store makes a decent salary ($100,000). Everyone else gets paid dirt. And then of course you have the CEO, CFO and COO all making millions and millions of dollars.

The average employee at Wal-Mart makes so little they qualify for welfare and live way below the poverty line. You cannot work at Wal-Mart and support yourself at the same time. It’s just not going to happen. I worked at Wal-Mart while I was going to school because I couldn’t find another job and didn’t really need to make a lot of money because I lived with my parents.

But once I graduated from college I immediately quit my job from Wal-Mart because they wouldn’t promote me and I went to work for their competitor Target. Target started me at $42,000 a year–Wal-Mart assistant managers don’t even make close to this. Within a year or two they said that I should be a manager at one of their stores. This means I’ll be making around $150,000.

This is why target stores are nicer, cleaner, neater and have better employees. They pay more money–it’s as simple as that. Wal-Mart hires the dregs of society and pays them as little as they can legally get away with. You get what you pay for.

I unfortunatly work at wal-mart and yes, it sucks. I understand why wal-mart workers are rude but not all are dirty. (I wash my hands several times while I am at work because that place is filthy!) We can be rude and annoying because the customers are rude and annoying as well. But what makes me mad is how manangement treats the associates, like crap! We all have lives outside of wal-mart but they expect us to revolve around them. It’s a crappy job and I am so grateful that I can go to college so I can have a career after I graduate. Oh, and I used to work at target and trust me, it isn’t better than wal-mart!! They DO NOT pay more than wal-mart. If you have retail exp. they still pay you minimum wage. The reason why target stores are cleaner is because they don’t get the same volume of customers as wal-mart does. And target hires the same crappy people wal-mart does, only they wear red shirts!

Having experienced horrible customer service at Wal-Mart myself, I can totaly understand the dread associated with having to be there when you would rather be somewhere else.

I have to say this, and I’m not trying to be rude, but it seems as though YOUR attitude was just as bad as the employees can be. If I were a Wal-Mart employee I would have avoided you, too.

Keep in mind that it is NOT the employees fault that the photo center closes at 8 pm. It is also not the employees fault if they cannot sit in the area they are working because, chances are, they are off trying to complete another task that was requested of them while you were waiting or looking for one. And I understand that there are employees who are sometimes off playing around or running their mouths. That still does not give you an excuse to have a horrible attitude. Chances are they hate the place as much as you do. But at least they are working and not being a drain on society without a job at all.

Sorry your experiences were terrible, but try being a bit gentler yourself and you will be very surprised of the results.

From a drain on society who got fired from Wal-Mart I think the biggest ploblem is just the amount of workers on the floor. Not enough workers in my former store for sure. Management also discouraged helping customers by putting on so much pressure for you to finish each task in a certain amount of time. I pretty much got fired for helping customers too much. Honestly, and getting sick and not calling in early enough. At least I am getting unemployment.

I agree with the poster who also said he would have avoided you. I would have, too. I actually do own a successful business. Part of our employee education is learning how to quickly avoid, deter and get rid of customers who behave like you did. The few dollars people like you might spend are not worth what you cost and the added aggravation.

I immediatly laid down the items I had chosen to purchase, and walked out of the store, I then went to Target and made the SAME PURCHASE, and I must add at $8.21 cents cheaper. I am NOT goint to be treated like this in ANY place of business. If this store has a policy for NO SMOKING of VAPOR STICKS, then it should be posted AT THE FRONT DOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
