 Other shooting victim survived

Lisa Ann Millican wasn&apos;t the only victim of Judith Ann and Alvin Neelley, investigators soon began to realize.
 
It was Oct. 3, 1982. John Hancock, a cemetery worker, and his common-law wife, Janice Chatman, were walking home in Rome, Ga., when a woman in a brown car drove up beside them and asked them to go riding around with her. At first Hancock refused, but the woman was persistent.

&quot;She said she was lonely,&quot; Hancock later testified. &quot;She said she was from out of town and wanted to ride around and talk to someone for a while.&quot;

Hancock and Chatman got into the car. Soon, the woman contacted her husband by CB radio. Hancock, a CBer himself, recognized the weak frequency - Channel 40 - the woman used to contact her husband. Her husband told them where he was, and Hancock knew that location was too far for them to communicate on Channel 40. The woman&apos;s husband, in another car, soon met up with them, and the woman introduced themselves by their CB handles, Nightrider and Lady Sundown.

By then, Hancock was suspicious and told them he wanted to go home. The man and woman ignored him and told Hancock to get in the man&apos;s car. Chatman stayed with the woman.

As they rode through Georgia&apos;s rural roads, Hancock eventually told the man he needed to use the bathroom, and the cars pulled onto a deserted road in Gordon County.

While he was out of the car, the man and the woman got out and were talking.

In seconds, the woman started walking toward him with a gun in her hand.

&quot;She told me to walk down the road, not to say anything or do anything or try anything funny, so I did,&quot; Hancock testified later.

&quot;I walked on down the road. And then I was talking to her, I really couldn&apos;t figure out what was going on. I told her that me and my wife wasn&apos;t doing them no harm, wouldn&apos;t cause no trouble for them or anything like that.&quot;

She told him to keep walking and then heard the man yelling for the woman to &quot;hurry up and get it over with,&quot; he said.

Hancock tried to ask her another question. He just wanted to know why she was going to shoot him.

&quot;Just keep your back to me and don&apos;t say anything,&quot; the woman told him.

&quot;I turned with my back to her, and then she told me not to worry about my girlfriend, that she would take care of her.&quot;

Hancock heard the man yell for the woman to hurry.

The woman then shot him.

&quot;I fell on my face,&quot; he said. &quot;I laid there.&quot;

Left for dead, Hancock waited until he heard the sounds of the cars driving away. He eventually crawled out to the road and flagged down a driver.

He had no idea where Chatman was and his story seemed outrageous to Gordon County detectives, unaware the shooting was related to the murder of Lisa Ann Millican, whose young body had been discovered in the bottom of Little River Canyon the week before.

Gordon County authorities even asked Hancock to submit to a lie detector test. When he arrived at the Rome Police Department where the test would be administered, he happened to walk past an office where a tape of the caller in the Millican case was being played for another girl a woman tried to abduct.

Hancock, with a look of shock on his face, recognized the voice as the woman who had shot him.

Investigators then feared a serial killer was on the loose, yet hoped to find Chatman alive.

Investigators already had determined that a woman fitting the description of the woman who had shot Hancock also tried to pick up at least two others.

A 22-year-old woman was headed to work at a fast-food restaurant when she ran out of gas earlier the same day Hancock was shot. The woman got a ride to a nearby pay phone and was waiting there for her husband to pick her up when a woman in a brown car pulled up. A young child was playing in the back seat.

The woman in the brown car struck up a conversation and tried to get the stranded woman to go riding around with her. The woman told her she had to go to work and couldn&apos;t and was waiting on her husband to pick her up. Finally, the woman in the brown car drove away.

The next day, a 13-year-old girl got off the school bus, walking home about a quarter-mile away, when a woman in a brown car drove up alongside her.

Again, the woman in the car tried to get the girl to go for a ride, and even giggled when the girl answered the woman&apos;s question and told her she was 13.

&quot;They refused to get in,&quot; former DeKalb County Sheriff Cecil Reed recalled. &quot;That&apos;s what saved them.&quot;

Investigators already believed the woman might have been in juvenile detention because in her call to authorities, she mentioned that Millican was &quot;on run,&quot; a term used by those who have been in the system.

An investigator eventually pursued a connection between the telephone calls Millican&apos;s killer had made to authorities and the calls made to the Floyd County (Ga.) Sheriff&apos;s Department a month before after a shooting at the home of a worker at the Rome Youth Development Center and a firebombing at another employee&apos;s home. Long interrogations of those workers cleared them of any connection to Millican&apos;s death.

That led investigators to look at those who fit the description and who had been in the custody of the YDC. Several names surfaced, including Judith Ann Neelley&apos;s. A YDC worker who knew Neelley from her involvement in an armed robbery in 1980 at Riverbend Mall made the connection.

The pieces were beginning to fit together, and investigators had connected Neelley and her husband to the shooting of Hancock and believed they were responsible for Millican&apos;s kidnapping and death.

They soon were arrested in Murfreesboro, Tenn.

Investigators learned that Chatman had been raped and shot. Her body was found in Chattooga County, Ga.

Reed and Eddie Wright, the DeKalb County Sheriff&apos;s Department&apos;s chief investigator at the time, were among the officers who went to Murfreesboro to bring Judith Ann Neelley back to answer to charges in Millican&apos;s death.

&quot;She didn&apos;t give us any trouble,&quot; Reed said.

Wright was driving and did stop at a convenience store.

&quot;She had a terrible headache, and we stopped and got her something for her headache,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a pretty ordinary trip.&quot;

But the Neelley case has been anything but ordinary.

&quot;It&apos;s the most extraordinary case I&apos;ve ever been involved with,&quot; former prosecutor Richard Igou said. &quot;And everybody I know who was involved felt the same way.&quot;

Books have been written and even a play, performed in cities such as New York and Chicago, was written, Igou said.

&quot;It&apos;s something that never goes away,&quot; he said.
