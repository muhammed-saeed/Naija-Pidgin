SNACK TIME: DIY Doritos, Mountain Dew turns mice to Jell-O, scotch in a can, Ludacris brand fried chicken, Star Wars burgers, someone in Tokyo is a really good fisherman, and Drew wrote an article about Old Bay beer
 
 

- I&apos;ve watched this How To Make Your Own Doritos vid literally 1,000 times and am still scratching my head. Does anyone know where to get the ingredients mentioned? I want to try.

- A man is suing Pepsi Co. because he found a mouse in his can of Mountain Dew . He discovered the rodent after he took a sip and then spit it out due to mouse. Pepsi&apos;s defense? The soda would have dissolved the mouse into jelly. Firstly, ew. Secondly, seriously? Ew. Thirdly, ew again because who actually drinks Dew?

- In other can-related news, you can now buy scotch in one . Produced by Scottish Spirits Imports and selling for $5, each can holds 12 fluid ounces of booze . CEO Ken Rubenfeld offers this adorably naive quote: &quot;We want people to be responsible—this is 12 fluid ounces of scotch whisky and people should treat it as such ... most people of common sense would know that that&apos;s a lot of alcohol.&quot; Ken really, truly believes that in his heart of hearts. Oh dear.

- Christopher Brian Bridges , whom America affectionately refers to as Ludacris , will be opening a fried chicken joint in Atlanta International Airport . Guess what it&apos;s called! Chicken-n-Beer , after his 2003 album. They better have a speedy-ass waitstaff or else they&apos;re going to need to start a tally of patrons yelling &quot;Where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?!&quot; 

- It wouldn&apos;t be a Snack Time post without a burger link: The Star Wars -themed Dark Vador (sic) burger and the Jedi burger will soon be on the menu at French fast-food restaurant Quick . Both look appetizing. JK no they don&apos;t.

- A giant bluefin tuna caught off the coast of Tokyo is worth $746,797 . No one says you have to buy the whole thing, though; the o-toro (fatty belly), aka the best part, is selling for $5.50 a piece. The fish weighs 269 kg (593 pounds) and could yield seven trillion maki rolls.

- Stillwater Artisanal Ales &apos; Brian Strumke debuted an Old Bay -flavored beer during Baltimore Beer Week . The beer had a run of only 101 bottles that sold (for charity) for $5 each, but some shadeballs turned around and tried to sell theirs on eBay for a ridiculous markup. Oh and look who wrote this article! Our very own Marylander, Drew Lazor .
