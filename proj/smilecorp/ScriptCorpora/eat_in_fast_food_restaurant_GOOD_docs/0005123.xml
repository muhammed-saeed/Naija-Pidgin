ALBANY -- A romantic rivalry caused the scuffle that ended with two injured patrons at New World Bistro Bar after one man tried to run over the other and hit the restaurant&apos;s facade, police said.

 Deshawn Currie , 26, of Albany, and Jason Lopez , 25, of Manhattan, began arguing over Lopez&apos;s ex-girlfriend, now Currie&apos;s girlfriend, in the parking lot of the KFC at 274 Delaware Ave. around 8:25 p.m. Tuesday.

Police said Lopez tried to stab Currie with a knife. Currie then got into his 2000 Nissan Maxima and chased Lopez south on Delaware.

Currie swerved his car and tried to hit Lopez but missed, police said.

The vehicle jumped the curb, rolled across the sidewalk and crashed into the upscale eatery, putting a hole into the building, police said.

Two diners were slightly injured by flying debris.

After the crash, Currie backed up the car and continued trying to run down Lopez until he hit a parked car.

Police said they were able to contain the men and took them to the detective division.

Glass littered the sidewalk outside the eatery, and what appeared to be blood was streaked across the roof of the damaged vehicle.

Eyewitness Michael Chernoff , 22, said he was having a cup of coffee outdoors when he saw a man running away from the fast food restaurant, being chased by another man who was driving a white sedan.

Chernoff said the driver of the vehicle appeared to try to strike the other man with his car, but narrowly missed and slammed into New World Bistro Bar.

Currie was charged with first-degree attempted assault, two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment, reckless driving and leaving the scene of a personal injury auto accident. Lopez was charged with criminal contempt, possession of a weapon and menacing.

New World Bistro Bar was open for dinner Wednesday night.
