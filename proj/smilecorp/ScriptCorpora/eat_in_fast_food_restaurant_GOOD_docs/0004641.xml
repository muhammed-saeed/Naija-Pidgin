What’s Lurking in Fast Food?
 By Jim F. in Diet Myths and Facts fast food issues food additives 
 John Andrews at NewsTarget uncovers some of the more unpleasant ingredients in what often sounds like‘healthy’food.

Subway

Wheat bread at Subway is not 100% whole grain (whole wheat flour is down on the ingredients list –followed closely by High Fructose Corn Syrup). The color of the bread is from“caramel color”–which contains sulfites . There is also an ingredient called azodicarbonamide.

Azodicarbonamide is a respiratory sensitizer (a possible cause of asthma) that is banned in Australia.

Taco Bell

The rice contains dimethylpolysiloxane –this is normally used in silicone caulk, adhesives, and as an anti-foaming agent.

Wendy’s

The Low Fat Honey Mustard Dressing contains titanium dioxide - used to manufacture paint, sunscreen, semiconductors, and also in food coloring.

McDonald’s

Take your coffee without creamer. The creamer contains sodium phosphate, sodium polyphosphate, tetra sodium pyrophosphate, sodium citrate, carrageena. Many of these ingredients are commonly found in various industrial chemicals. If you’re brave enough–go check out the McDonald’s ingredients lists .

Kentucky Fried Chicken

Usually Chinese food gets slammed for having monosodium glutamate (commonly known as MSG); so much so that many restaurants hang signs and print on menus that their food contains no MSG. But MSG is also hiding in KFC’s gravy.

MSG is a sodium salt that is rendered from the fermentation of carbohydrates with a nitrogen source–not exactly an ingredient found in good ole’home cooking! And MSG has been linked to a variety of health problems, such as obesity, migraine headaches, and heart disease.

Burger King

Somebody better tell the king his kingdom has run amuck. Burger King’s Veggie Burger is a mess of secret ingredients; including calcium caseinate, hydrolyzed corn, yeast extract, and soy protein isolate. So lest you think you’re doing yourself a favor by skipping the beef.

Additionally, the BK Veggie Burger is not exactly cooked with tender loving care, they microwave it. What? Like a TV dinner!

It’s not just fast-foods, it’s products in the store! Unless you read all the ingredients and understand what they mean, your in danger! Skin care products are just as bad, right down to your shampoo! I could go on and on but it’s more simple just to say, Read Your Product Labels!
This government is out of control!

It’s understandable why you would feel this way! They put chemicals in their food that makes you addicted to it!

I can’t belive that this stuff is happens because all these fast food restaurants are hiding all of of these terrible ingredients in their fine print, that almost none of us read.

Hey. We are doing a project on what people don’t know about what ingredients, chemicals, ect. are in their fast food. So when we were researching on the internet we came across your blog and now we are wondering if you can take time to anwser a couple of questions or shed some light on your research for this post.

Thanks,
Erika Roy and Abla Saadeh

 Reply dude 
actually the people found out that fast food wuz bad by doing an experement. the guy who did it ate fast food every day, for every meal. he did this for a month. at the end of it he found that he had gained 25 lbs and felt tired all the time. his doctor told him to stop, or die. he created a movie on his experience called SUPER SIZE ME.thats how people know that fast food is bad. DONT EAT IT!
