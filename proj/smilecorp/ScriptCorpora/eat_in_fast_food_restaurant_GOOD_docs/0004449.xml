 Police: Unattended running cars inviting to criminals 

Three recent thefts of unattended cars

 Lisa Trigg The Tribune-Star The Tribune Star Fri Jan 27, 2012, 05:01 AM EST 
 
TERRE HAUTE—Leaving a vehicle running to warm up has been a costly mistake recently for three auto owners, prompting Terre Haute Police to warn people not to leave a running vehicle unattended at any time.

“Leaving a car running is dumb,”Detective Brad Rumsey of the THPD property crimes unit told the Tribune-Star on Tuesday.

Snow and ice build-up are a problem for vehicles parked outside in winter, and it may take a while to get vehicles warmed up, but that is an opportunity that thieves wait and watch for.

“They’re criminals,”Rumsey said.“They’re not here to be friendly, or to tell you that you left your car running.”

During a recent 10-day span, Rumsey investigated three incidents in which vehicles were stolen because the auto was left running and unattended.

In one case, the theft occurred when a truck owner parked at a local convenience store and left his truck running while he went inside to get a cup of coffee. The accused thief in that case, who was loitering inside the store when the truck owner arrived, reportedly had already told a companion that he was hoping someone would leave a vehicle running outside because the he was cold and tired of walking.

It wasn’t long before the suspect was driving home, and the truck owner was filing a stolen vehicle report.

In another recent incident, a person left a car running while going inside a fast food restaurant near Lafayette Avenue and Fort Harrison Road.

That car was also stolen. Within minutes, it was involved in a hit-and-run accident, and was later found damaged at a nearby grocery store.

Rumsey said the suspects in both of those cases have been arrested and criminally charged. The suspect in a third vehicle theft at another convenience store has not been located, even though that vehicle was also recovered.

The common denominator in those three cases was the owner decision to leave the vehicle unattended while it was running.

“People don’t think when they make the choice to go outside and heat up a vehicle, and leave it running,”he said.

The Terre Haute Police Department investigates dozens of car thefts each year. Sometimes the vehicles are recovered, Rumsey said, but they are often damaged, stripped, burned out, wrecked and whatever valuables were inside have been taken.

Investigators do collect information and evidence for a criminal case, he said, but getting that evidence processed at a crime lab takes time and is expensive. Non-violent property crimes receive a low priority at the crime lab, which must also handle evidence for murders, rapes and other violent felony crimes.

“It’s just not reasonable as a taxpayer to get every car break-in checked for DNA,”Rumsey said.“It’s a non-violent crime.”

Repeat offenders, however, do face tougher penalties as a class-D felony theft case can be upgraded to a class-C felony because of prior convictions.

He also warned the public that older vehicles seem to be stolen more often because they do not have the security features that newer cars carry.

People who are economically challenged may not be able to afford replacing or repairing a stolen or damaged vehicle, so such vehicle owners should pay particular care to keeping their vehicles locked and to not leaving them running unattended.

Rumsey also investigates break-ins and thefts from vehicles, and he said such incidents can be avoiding by removing valuables from a vehicle each time the driver gets out, even if the vehicle is parked at home in a driveway.

Purses, CDs, laptop computers, GPS devices and tools are sought by thieves.

Anyone who has crime tips to report is encouraged to call THPD at (812) 238-1661, or to leave an anonymous tip by calling Crime Stoppers at (812) 238-STOP.
