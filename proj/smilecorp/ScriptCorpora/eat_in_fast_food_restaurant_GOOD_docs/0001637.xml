 Absolut Big Deal 
 
The big news on the international spirits scene today is that the country of Sweden has sold state-owned Absolut Vodka to French conglomérat de boisson Pernod Ricard for $8.9 billion after a competitive auction. From Reuters : Pernod beat the favourite, Jim Beam bourbon maker Fortune Brands (FO.N: Quote, Profile, Research), to win control of Sweden&apos;s Vin&amp;Sprit VSG.UL, owner of the fast-growing Absolut brand, and gain a bigger presence in the U.S. According to Reuters and other news outlets, the final price paid by the French company was enough to make some stakeholders nervous. &quot;The combination of a full price and the amount of debt to be raised definitely seems to have unnerved certain investors,&quot; said Stephen Surpless, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. But he should chill out. Vodka is the hot ticket right now in all sorts of markets.

According to a report earlier this month , the three most popular drinks in the United States are martinis (with vodka or gin), mojitos and Red Bull with vodka. The New York Times just ran a big feature on feminine-oriented vodkas in Russia, which might work for Absolut, with its mastery of marketing and its wide variety of infused flavors.

For its part, Pernod Ricard expressed confidence in its new brand&apos;s market strength. From its press release: In the United States, Absolut is the top premium spirits brand, selling more than 5 million 9 litre cases. It has a unique brand image built around values of creativity, innovation and cultural leadership.

In the rest of the world, with close to 6 million cases sold in 2007, Absolut is one of the most global brands in the industry with a significant presence in all the continents and a strong perception as a leader in the premium vodka category. So basically they picked up a very expensive and very good brand. Kind of like ordering a top-shelf cocktail. Now Pernod had better hope that the drinking public orders enough of those premium drinks to keep its new ship afloat. We&apos;ll try to do our part, guys.

 Burger King Unveils The Whopper Bar 
 
Soon you&apos;ll be able to get your Whopper in some fancy new digs. Burger King is unveiling the Whopper Bar , which will offer more Whoppers but fewer of the other typical BK menu items: The menu and size of the Whopper Bars will be smaller than a typical Burger King, but they will sell Whoppers not typically available at all times in the chain&apos;s traditional restaurants. Executives say they haven&apos;t finalized the menu, though it could include as many as 10 types of Whoppers, such as the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper, a version topped with spicy onions. One menu sketch has a section called &quot;Pimp Your Whopper,&quot; where patrons can chose from additional toppings like jalapeno peppers, bacon and barbecue sauce.
Russ Klein, Burger King&apos;s president, global marketing, strategy and innovation, said he began thinking about the concept about four years ago when he visited a Burger King in Germany that had knocked out the back of the restaurant and created a bar section. Mr. Klein said the Whopper Bar is akin to McDonald&apos;s Corp.&apos;s creation of McCafe coffee bars, except that it is built around the chain&apos;s signature sandwich. And the toppings will be placed on top of the burgers in front of the customers, Chipotle-style. Look for Whopper Bars in casinos, airports or malls in the near future.

 Seahawks Fan/Cook Arrested For Spitting In Burger 
 
You know it happens, but it&apos;s still disturbing to be reminded of it: News came across the wires Friday that a cook and Seahawks fan in the Seattle suburb of Port Orchard, Wash. allegedly spit in a burger ordered by a customer wearing Steelers gear. From the Kitsap Sun: Deputies said the 37-year-old man in Steelers garb took his daughters to a Mile Hill Drive fast food restaurant Saturday evening, and &quot;began trading friendly barbs about his team and their victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL,&quot; reports said.

One employee told the man that he&apos;d &quot;better not say that to the guy that&apos;s making your food,&quot; but the man thought it was a joke, reports said.

That is, until he opened his &quot;clamshell-style&quot; hamburger container and discovered what he called a &quot;loogie&quot; on his hamburger. 

The manager, hilariously, told Kitsap County sheriff&apos;s deputies his 24-year-old employee might just have hawked something into the food. What the deputies were hoping to find in the way of evidence of the crime when they searched his home, we couldn&apos;t tell you, but they found some marijuana when they got there, and brought the guy in. The man also confessed to spitting in the 37-year-old&apos;s hamburger container to &quot;gross him out ... because he was a Steelers fan,&quot; deputies said. 

With a new sports season just starting and a lot of old rivalries coming back into the spotlight, we&apos;re here to remind diners to keep it civil and maybe wear neutral colors if you&apos;re in enemy territory, at least while picking up short-order food. It&apos;s not right that a few disgruntled sports fans/kitchen employees play like that, but you&apos;d be naive if you thought they didn&apos;t.

 Cantaloupes: Safe Handling Tips 
 
As you probably read in the FYI roundup , the U.S. is sending some health inspectors to Honduras to try to get a handle on a crop of tainted cantaloupes that have given a handful of Americans and Canadians salmonella. The melons, sent over by grower and packer Agropecuaria Montelibano, have of course been recalled, but not before they were distributed pretty widely, with 50 illnesses reported in 16 states.

But Honduran President Manuel Zelaya said the fruit was just fine, according to CNN . &quot;It&apos;s not in our fruit,&quot; he said about last week&apos;s report by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that some Honduran cantaloupes may be contaminated with salmonella. &quot;It&apos;s not true what they are saying. Logically, we believe it is an error.&quot; To make his point, Zelaya broke out a melon that was due to be exported to the states. &quot;Permit me to make a demonstration,&quot; he said, then cut open the fruit, sliced off a chunk, put it in his mouth and chewed vigorously.

&quot;I eat this fruit without any fear,&quot; he said with his mouth full. &quot;It&apos;s a delicious fruit. Nothing happens to me!&quot; Still, just to be safe, the U.S. has sent its people in, and has blocked the import of Agropecuaria Montelibano&apos;s antelopes. Also, the FDA put out this set of cantaloupe-safety tips:
 The FDA recommends that consumers take the following steps to reduce the risk of contracting Salmonella or other foodborne illnesses from cantaloupes:

* Purchase cantaloupes that are not bruised or damaged. If buying fresh-cut cantaloupe, be sure it is refrigerated or surrounded by ice.

* After purchase, refrigerate cantaloupes promptly.

* Wash hands with hot, soapy water before and after handling fresh cantaloupes.

* Scrub whole cantaloupes by using a clean produce brush and cool tap water immediately before eating. Don&apos;t use soap or detergents.

* Use clean cutting surfaces and utensils when cutting cantaloupes. Wash cutting boards, countertops, dishes, and utensils with hot water and soap between the preparation of raw meat, poultry, or seafood and the preparation of cantaloupe.

* If there happens to be a bruised or damaged area on a cantaloupe, cut away those parts before eating it.

* Leftover cut cantaloupe should be discarded if left at room temperature for more than two hours.

* Use a cooler with ice or use ice gel packs when transporting or storing cantaloupes outdoors.
 In other food safety news, the U.S. Department of Agriculture&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced yesterday that it will hold a big meeting April 9 to discuss ramping up beef safety enforcement following the biggest recall ever . Sheesh. See if we ever buy groceries outside the farmer&apos;s market again.

 Inventor Of The Egg McMuffin Dead At 89 
 
Sad news to report. Herb Peterson, creator of McDonald&apos;s uber-popular Egg McMuffin, died on Tuesday of natural causes. He was 89 years old. A longtime advertising reprentative for McDonalds, he actively pushed the restaurant chain into expanding into the breakfast market. He eventually became a McDonald&apos;s franchisee. BY the time he passed away, Peterson was co-owner and operator of six McDonald&apos;s franchises in Santa Barbara and Goleta. From the International Herald Tribune :
 Peterson came up with idea for the signature McDonald&apos;s breakfast item in 1972. He &quot;was very partial to eggs Benedict,&quot; Fraker said, and worked on creating something similar. The egg sandwich consisted of an egg that had been formed in a Teflon circle with the yolk broken, topped with a slice of cheese and grilled Canadian bacon. It was served open-faced on a toasted and buttered English muffin. The Egg McMuffin made its debut at a restaurant in Santa Barbara that Peterson co-owned with his son, David Peterson.

 Three SoFla Chefs Nominated For James Beard Awards 
 
Remember all of those possible James Beard nominees we wrote about last month? That list has been whittled down to the official nominee list , which includes just three area chefs, all competing against each other in the Best Chef: South division:

•Zach Bell of Cafe Boulud 
•Michelle Bernstein of Michy&apos;s 
•Douglas Rodriguez of Ola 

There are only five nominees in the division, so the chances are pretty good that one of these three will bring the award home. We&apos;ll have to wait until June to find out.

 Looking Into The Future Of High-Tech Food 
 
A fantastic read today in Slate got us thinking about this Chez Pim post from a few days ago. Both are about Spanish avant-garde cuisine, but while Slate wonders out loud whether technology-based trends such as foaming will make lasting marks on the food landscape even after their stellar popularity, Pim declares, in no uncertain or complimentary terms, the lasting impression a certain such restaurant left on her.

From Slate&apos;s Lisa Abend: At its best, the Spanish version of &quot;molecular gastronomy&quot; stokes the emotions, shocks the senses, and, in the words (if not exactly the intentions) of that hedonistic gourmand Claude Lévi-Strauss, is &quot;good to think.&quot; It&apos;s also often delicious.

But, from the beginning, some critics have scorned a mode of cooking that relies, in their opinion, too heavily on technology (as if an oven weren&apos;t a machine) and often chooses form over substance. In asking whether the gastronomical experimentation has reached the end of its popularity, Abend sets out five modes of its possible destruction: Death by foam, death by scholarship, etc. This highly experimental cuisine might be the victim of anything from overexposure to its own version of rococo.

But Pim&apos;s complaint seems to cut to the heart of the matter: At &quot;quite possibly the worst meal of my life&quot; at Miguel Sanchez Romera&apos;s L&apos;Esguard, north of Barcelona, she describes a meal that seems almost totally divorced from anything that seems like real food. With most dishes packaged in a gelatinous &quot;Micrifilm,&quot; and served with what sounds like more attention to appearance than to taste, Pim pointedly complains about the chef&apos;s &quot;grand idea:&quot; But you know what? Sometimes all we care about is if your grand idea tasted any good. Because if it isn&apos;t, then it&apos;s just a big pile of crap. From the sound of it, Pim got stuck with the latter. But that&apos;s not to say that all scientifically experimental cooking necessarily suffers.

As for Slate&apos;s question of whether the 20-odd-year trend in hyper-experimental Spanish cooking will leave a long-lasting mark, well, we&apos;ll probably have to stay tuned. Likely, some techniques will become part of the long-term landscape, while others go away to die. What will become of Micrifilm? We&apos;ll let Pim cover that one.

 Closed: Nexxt Cafe Miracle Mile 
 
 According to Frodnesor over at Chowhound , the Nexxt Cafe on Miracle Mile, which has been open for just a few months, is now sporting a sign that says &quot;permanently closed.&quot; Guess they never quite recovered from the health code violations in late 2007.

What would you like to see come to the Mile next?

 How To Introduce Your Kids To Alcohol 
 
 We imagine our parents laughing while reading New York Times wine critic Eric Asimov&apos;s article over whether or not to let his 16- and 17-year-old sons drink wine with dinner. He consults experts, some of whom tell him to give them sips, others who advise enforcing a strict no-alcohol policy until 21. (One even wishes the drinking age were 25!)

This was one issue that our parents never thought twice about, which is why, perhaps, Asimov&apos;s hand-wringing seems a little silly. Alcohol was never forbidden; if we wanted a sip of something, we could have it. For as long as we can remember, we had our own wine glass at dinnertime—it was just a lot less full than the other glasses. We were never offered beer or cocktails until we were 18 and had returned from college.

The other MenuPages editors had similar stories. MP: Boston&apos;s Leila was allowed a glass of wine with dinner throughout her teenaged years. Adam of MP: San Francisco was still in elementary school when he started taking sips from his parents&apos; cups, although he didn&apos;t begin drinking wine or beer with dinner until he was 18. Neal of MP: Philadelphia was 14 when he was allowed a glass of wine on holidays and special occasions, and Adam of MP: Chicago wasn&apos;t all that interested in wine when he was first offered it at 14 or 15, but by 17 he was drinking wine with dinner and by 20 was sharing scotch with his parents.

So it&apos;s not exactly a representative sample, but it&apos;s telling that none of us has had any real drinking problems. Sure, we all drank more than we should have in college (didn&apos;t everyone?), but there are no stomach-pumping incidents or DUIs to report. Just a few bad hangovers. Which makes us think that Asimov should just chill out and let his kids have a glass of wine.

 Craving: Moqueca 
 
 
Look at the color on that thing. All sorts of seafood and rice in a gorgeous broth. You&apos;ll find this moqueca , a Brazilian seafood stew, at Sushi Samba Dromo on Miami Beach, where it comes with shrimp, squid, cod, crayfish, coconut milk, cashews, dende (palm) oil and chimichurri rice. The restaurant offers a lunch portion of the stew for $20 (it&apos;s $24 at dinner time). Cacao Restaurant in Coral Gables also features a lunchtime moqueca for $15. And for $14, you can get the catch of the day cooked moqueca-style at Oba Oba in Coconut Creek.

 Is Food Porn More Popular Than Food? 
 
While celebrity chefs and other food personalities don&apos;t seem to be hurting for gigs and endorsement deals, actual restaurants are feeling the economic pinch right about now. Does that mean that food porn is more popular than actual food?

Over the weekend the trade magazine Restaurants and Institutions linked on its site an article from the Baltimore Sun that made the case that a faltering economy is leading to scrimping among restaurant customers: Amid gloomy economic trends - falling real estate values, layoffs and stock market volatility - many consumers are changing their spending habits. And eating out is among the first expenses they look to trim in times of economic uncertainty, economists say. Consumers can adjust &quot;in terms of frequency, spending levels and venues,&quot; said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of Technomic Inc., a food industry consulting and research firm. On Monday, the blog Waiterrant ran a contemplative, though highly anecdotal, post about the recent decline in customer volume as well as spending per customer at the semi-fictional Cafe Machiavelli.

But even as the trade rags paint a bleak economic picture for restaurants, restaurant-related media shows no sign of slowing down. Last month, the Baltimore Sun reported on the continuing popularity of the Food Network : Now, almost 15 years later, the Food Network is going strong. In 2007, it had 90 million subscribers, which, according to Derek Baine, cable analyst with SNL Kagan, puts it on a par with such cable stalwarts as ESPN, Nickelodeon and MTV. Foodie-oriented websites continue to make headlines, such as last week&apos;s New York Times roundup of the so-called &quot; fat pack ,&quot; and even the New Yorker profiled a hot young chef in its last issue.

But for all the public&apos;s appetite for food media, where is its appetite for food? Perhaps the glossy pictures, lingo-filled dialogue and industry gossip work as a stand-in for the real experience for those unable to spring for frequent restaurant meals in these lean times.

Frankly, we hope not. Eating out is a good way to make a regular old evening special and can be done on the relative cheap. Part of the fun in eating out comes with discovering that perfect menu for your budget. We happen to know a great website that can help with that. Just saying.

 Good Deals: $1 Pitchers at Hooligan&apos;s 
 
 We were perusing the daily drink specials over at Hooligan&apos;s Pub&amp;Oyster Bar in South Miami when our eyes caught &quot;$1 pitchers.&quot; Initial reaction: WOW. Then we saw: 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. Unfortunately, that&apos;s a little past our bedtime, especially on a Tuesday night. But hey, if you&apos;re up at that hour, that&apos;s a pretty awesome deal. There&apos;s also a beer pong tournament at midnight. Makes sense, of course, since it&apos;s college night.

If you&apos;re like us (i.e. not a night owl), Hooligan&apos;s has happy hour every day from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m., when 20-ounce drafts are $4.75-$6.75. Show up after 5 p.m. and the oysters are $4.95 per dozen.

 Eat The Revolution: Comoros Islands 
 
The Comoros , an archipelago in the Indian Ocean halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar, recently squashed a coup attempt on one of its three islands in a rather hilarious manner. Reuters reports that no one was injured in the invasion, and the rebel leader &quot;was believed to have dressed up as a woman and to be trying to escape by boat to the nearby French-run island of Mayotte.&quot; They always try to escape to Mayotte! We make light of this because Comoros has had bloodless coups and coup attempts on average of once a year since it declared independence from France in the 1970s. National motto in this beautiful but isolated country of 700,000: &quot;there&apos;s nothing to do, so let&apos;s have a coup!&quot; (Their actual motto is &quot;Unity - Solidarity - Development,&quot; but very few of those things have happened.)

This is a perfect opportunity to bring up the country&apos;s delightful and virtually unknown cuisine. Its basis is the standard Swahili assortment of coconut-based curries served with grilled meats and fish, fortified with Indian snack food and graced with a dollop of the French sandwich aesthetic. When we visited a few years ago, our very favorite food item was a particular sliced hard-boiled egg and cucumber sandwich, served in shops around the capital on fresh-baked baguettes (France&apos;s most laudable colonial legacy) with mayonnaise and spectacularly ripe tomato. We might have been biased toward the sandwich since we had been stuck in Africa for several months without decent bread, but we will say with some surety that it is was an artful combination of simple, fresh ingredients, and thoroughly satisfying to eat with two hands.

Our second favorite dish was tuna sambusas, which are basically like samosas but less flaky:
 
On mainland Africa, they&apos;re usually filled with beef or lentils, but here, it&apos;s a lot easier to source tuna than cow or pulses. At four to the dollar or so, one could really go to town on these.

Our third favorite dish was a beverage: tap water. After a few days, we were running low on funds to pay for the incredibly expensive French bottles that were the only available water supply in the marketplaces. Why no local bottled water like in every other country, we wondered? How do the people afford it? Surely they weren&apos;t drinking tap water, the septic scourge of the global South! But after several locals told us it was okay, we tried a glass and a light bulb went off: the country is a volcanic island chain, and we were sipping pure volcanic spring water ! Don&apos;t tell anyone, or the next thing you know it&apos;ll be crawling with Fiji executives.

Oh yes, they also have crazy-looking lobsters for you to eat:
 
If you go, avoid: the incredibly sour injera-like sponge cakes they try to serve you with fish curries. Ask for rice instead. Also, manioc; it&apos;s just not a very good tuber. [ Um, untrue.–Ed. ]Finally, plan your trip around avoiding election day—they close all the roads in the country, and you&apos;ll have to hitch a ride with the Army. But it turns out the soldiers are quite friendly!

 Viewing Pleasure: Seared Tuna At Abokado 
 
 
We have no idea what the seared tuna dish shown above tastes like, but we so badly want to sink our teeth into it, mercury levels be damned. You can find this dish, which comes with vegetable wraps, at Abokado in Mary Brickell Village.

We love the concept of Latin/Sushi fusion, although initial reviews have been fairly lukewarm. Here&apos;s what consumable Joy had to say about it after a visit this weekend: All the food was beautifully presented, and it tries hard to be great. It may be trying a little bit too hard. We loved the way the food looked, and we enjoyed getting the plates with multiple flavors. Not all the flavors worked however, some overwhelming their bases they were supposed to be carrying, and others simply not carrying much flavor at all. The &quot;nachos&quot; -- tempura shiso leaf with sort of a tuna tartare on top -- were &quot;pretty good&quot; according to the DH, but &quot;not so-shiso-y&quot; because the batter was a bit too much for the delicate leaf. The rolls were ambitiously designed and fun to eat, but none of them have stuck in the mind enough for us to recall their precise names. Interesting. It&apos;s still fairly new, so perhaps it&apos;ll work out these kinks.

 Cracking The Big Egg 
 
 

Since reading this week&apos;s New Yorker profile of Momofuku chef David Chang, we&apos;ve been fascinated with the idea of eating ostrich eggs. Early in the piece, Chang describes trying to cook one, with unappetizing results: I wanted to pretend I was Fred Flintstone. So I got a big rondeau, put like two inches of oil, and I was gonna deep-fry the motherfucker, but there was so much water content in the white that it just sort of dispersed. It looked like cottage cheese. Gross, right? Chang says in the piece that an ostrich egg yolk is roughly equivalent to 24 chicken egg yolks.

We poked around online to see if there are any success stories of ostrich egg eating. After all, people have been trying to make ostriches a commercially viable livestock product for years, so there must be somebody out there promoting the eggs. We found some basic guidelines from the Indian Point Ostrich Ranch in Tehachapi (Kern County), Calif. Also a Chowhound thread on the topic. But our quick search couldn&apos;t turn up any in-depth recipes using the massive protein balls.

Meanwhile, the profile on Chang is great. Aside from the ostrich egg thing, he&apos;s inspiring both as a chef and a manager of people. The transcript of his speech to his staff is simultaneously riveting and shaming as you realize you don&apos;t even come close to understanding the word &quot;dedication&quot; as he does.

 Hotel Lobbyist Proposes 2% Tax On Restaurants 
 
The state is expected to face a $3.5 billion budget shortfall, so Stuart Blumberg, president and CEO of the Greater Miami&amp;The Beaches Hotel Association, suggested that restaurants pick up the slack with a two percent tax on all food and beverage sales. It also resolves an inequity between hotels and restaurants, he says. &quot;By agreeing to a bed tax, the hotels have been carrying the burden for 30-plus years. Our partners in the restaurant industry haven&apos;t contributed anything except sales tax.&quot;

Not so fast, argues Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association President and CEO Carol Dover. In 2007, restaurants paid $3.9 billion in taxes. Furthermore, bed tax revenue must be used for tourism-related activities, such as ad campaigns and convention center expansions, not budget shortfalls, Dover says.

And unlike hotels, where the customer base is mostly from out of state, it&apos;s locals who fuel the restaurant industry. &quot;Stu&apos;s contention that this will only affect tourists is just wrong,&quot; says Dover. Apparently what&apos;s really annoyed restaurateurs is the way Blumberg&apos;s proposed this whole thing; they&apos;re unhappy he failed to consult the industry before doing it. Of course, a lobbyist&apos;s proposal is worthless unless a legislator picks it up, and no one has done that so far. We should note also that Miami-Dade already has a two percent food and beverage tax for restaurants inside hotels and a one percent tax for other restaurants, so the county&apos;s restaurants would be exempt from this proposal.

And in other news, remember that toilet paper bill the Florida legislature was considering? The state House of Representatives decided to drop the bill , since state regulators already include bathrooms in restaurant inspections.

 Massive Starbucks Suit Involved Tiny, Obscure Union 
 
Big news on the labor front from a big chain that&apos;s been all up in the headlines : After losing a big huge class-action suit in California, Starbucks has to pay more than $100 million to about 120,000 current and former baristas in that state whose tips it diverted to shift supervisors. In California, owners, managers or other “agents” of business owners can&apos;t share in tips. In the first phase of the class-action suit, [San Diego Superior Court Judge Patricia] Cowett ruled that shift supervisors were essentially agents under state labor law, and therefore the company&apos;s policy allowing them to share in tips violated that law.

The company argued that shift supervisors were not managers or supervisors, that they performed many of the same tasks as baristas, and should share in the tips. Starbucks is, of course, appealing the decision. Meanwhile, it&apos;s been hit with an injunction ordering it to stop sharing tips with shift supervisors in California.

As the coffee giant clamors to extract itself from its scalding pot of labor trouble, we were just a little delighted to discover that a heating element in that pot is the Industrial Workers of the World . That&apos;s right, at least some Starbucks workers are organized with the party of Eugene Debs and Utah Phillips . Wow. Could it be there&apos;s power in a union after all? This one&apos;s for you, Wobblies ! From now on we&apos;re taking our coffee red.

 Is That Clam Anatomically Correct? 
 
It didn&apos;t occur to us until seeing the below video that we&apos;ve actually eaten this creature:

 

But we have and it was pretty good. On the plate it looked a bit like this (the white ones on the left):

 

It&apos;s called geoduck (pronounced gooey duck), but was listed on the menu as &quot;giant clam,&quot; which we pictured looking more like this:

 

But of course that&apos;s something altogether different. Want to know how they turn that phallic mollusk into a pretty piece of sushi or sashimi? Serious Eats pulled this video from the Discovery Channel. We love Mike Rowe :

 Now Open: Dune Oceanfront Burger Lounge 
 
 The Dune Oceanfront Burger Lounge just opened yesterday at the Ritz-Carlton on Key Biscayne, but the burgers first appeared at the South Beach Wine&amp;Food Festival&apos;s Burger Bash. They didn&apos;t win, but they were up against some stiff competition.

The burgers start at $16 for &quot;The American Classic&quot;; on the other end is a plate of Kobe beef sliders with sauteed foie gras and picolit grape jam. That is one pricey burger. But hey, at least the fries are included. You can also get a Chicago-style hot dog and a mini burger or a burger with fresh bacon and blue cheese froth. And if you&apos;d like a cocktail with that, well, that&apos;ll set you back another $15.

 Sit On This 
 
 Just as you can&apos;t keep away from the farmer&apos;s market to try out all the produce newly coming into season, it&apos;s hard to keep away from the flea market, where that totally cool, vintage cutlery service refuses to let you go home without it. Let this happen a few times and you&apos;ll have a fork explosion, and that could hurt. But what to do with the stuff you&apos;re not using anymore? Unlike last week&apos;s farmer&apos;s market goodies it doesn&apos;t naturally disappear.

The folks at Boing Boing today showcased artist Osian Batyka-Williams , who is putting all those old forks, knives and spoons to good use elsewhere in the kitchen or dining room by making chairs out of them. Hope the tines are faced the right way!

 Nobody Could Eat That Many Eggs. Could They? 
 
 Word&apos;s been circling the internets today that famed art collector Charles Saatchi , husband of famed British chef Nigella Lawson , lost about 50 pounds in 10 months eating nothing but eggs. Seems like an extreme (and extremely uncomfortable) version of the Atkins diet.

We wrote the feat off as impossible, not just because it&apos;s unclear that the diet would be effective, but who in their right mind could stand to live on an all-egg diet for nearly a year? Well, it turns out that just because there&apos;s one ingredient in your food, that doesn&apos;t mean there&apos;s no diversity. A conveniently timed (and beautiful) slideshow ran on Gourmet&apos;s website today showcasing a dozen types of eggs. Please check it out. It&apos;s great. Click the photo to get there.

 The Soft Facts 
 
 

The article on fat foodies in today&apos;s New York Times definitely caught the eye of those of us here at MenuPages and, we&apos;re betting, a good segment of our readership. We&apos;re all a bit food-obsessed and all probably not as good at moderation as we&apos;d like to be.

MenuPages has a pretty svelte staff—we all work hard to avoid joining what the Times calls the &quot;Fat Pack&quot;—but surely we can all (staff and readers alike) use the reminder to maintain a high vegetable intake and a sharp eye on the fatty meats and bulky breads.

Of course, none of us here at MP has written a whole book on hamburgers like Grub Street&apos;s Josh Ozersky. In a post Monday , he decried a &quot;lite&quot; future: ...as we told [ New York Times reporter Kim] Severson, the day we start eating salad she’s welcome to our place at the table. Grub Street may cost us the vitality of our once-springy carcass, but by God the work will go on! 

When you&apos;ve made a profession out of high-fat foods, we imagine it is difficult to switch to salads and lentils. Though many journalists, chefs and bloggers interviewed for the piece have made lifestyle changes, dropping weight and cholesterol counts on doctors&apos; orders, a certain machismo remains, as seen in Ozersky&apos;s defiant post.

MP: South Florida editor Carolina Bolado pointed out that most of the interviewees were men, and that the attitude of machismo—at least as represented by the Times —seemed a decidedly male one. &quot;I blame television and its constant pairing of fat guys with gorgeous women,&quot; she wrote in an instant message.

Whatever the reason for the disregard of health concerns, it would be a wise choice for foodies of all stripes to remember that the cost of incurring diet-related health problems skyrockets once the problems are in place and chronic. This is the most literal version of an ounce of prevention being worth a pound (or 100) of cure.

 Ask The Chef: Kris Wessel 
 
 We got a hold of Kris Wessel by cell phone yesterday to talk about his new restaurant Red Light on the premises of Motel Blu on Biscayne Boulevard; it&apos;s set to open as soon as he gets everything straightened out with Tallahassee. You might remember him from Liaison on South Beach and Elia in Bal Harbour, neither of which is still around. He also helped launch Paninoteca on Lincoln Road. 

 MP: What&apos;s with the delays? 
Kris: I’m actually being held back by Tallahassee on the food license. They lost the application in December. It’s a big issue with us and the regional inspection office. We’re still about three weeks out from serving food.

I’m pissed, needless to say. I’ve written my local commissioners. They’ve now held me up for a month and a half. I don’t have time to get into lawsuits and things like that. I’m at the mercy of the state. Not only do I find a restaurant in a beaten-down drug and prostitute motel, but now at the end of the road the state is giving me this surprise.

 MP: Speaking of the motel, how did you decide on this location? 
Kris: I was driving my daughters home about three years ago, and I looked out of the corner of my eye at this motel with broken windows. And I saw three letters and “restaurant.” It was a jungle of iguanas, manatees and turtles. At least that’s what my daughter saw. What I saw were crack addicts and prostitutes in this old abandoned Chinese restaurant. Now that I’ve pulled everything together, I’m noticing the manatees and turtles more.

 MP: Manatees? Seriously? 
Kris: It’s one of the largest migrations of manatees in South Florida. And they turn around at the dam, so I get them going in and going out. The manatee association sent me brand new manatee signs. They love me. And the birds from the El Portal bird sanctuary—they fly and inhabit this river. All on Biscayne Boulevard!

 MP: What will the food be like? 
Kris: I call it regional dining in the sense of the region of the southeast, but if you look at the southeast from the South, to Florida, to the Caribbean, to South America—everything that influences this region. That, blended with a dominance of organic foods. And all the menu categories will be subdivided into technique and protein and veg, and any starch will be on the side. I also have a little red smokehouse down on the water, and I have a section on the menu of smoked proteins. Lots of tropical fruit that is very easily had will be all over the menu. It won&apos;t be so overly Florida—it&apos;s a regional organic-driven restaurant.

 A few extra details we learned about the restaurant: there will be a raw bar down by the water, a main bar upstairs, and eventually a lounge. Wessel has also set up lots of riverfront dining, so you can watch the manatees (manatees!) swim by. Valet parking will be free. The bar will be open in two weeks, from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m., but there won&apos;t be any food until the license from Tallahassee comes through, and that will likely take at least three weeks.

 Pickle Pops Please 
 
 Okay, these weird things have been getting a lot of attention recently, so let&apos;s get into them. The warm weather is just a few short weeks away and we know you&apos;ll be looking for a cold, refreshing, um, briny treat. Enter: The Picklesickle.

Can a food become a viral phenomenon? We wouldn&apos;t have thought so either, but it seems just about every foodie, blogger and collector of weird things has something to say about these, whether it&apos;s &quot;eww,&quot; or &quot;tempting,&quot; and the proof&apos;s in the sales.

Chow&apos;s Grinder blog highlighted the weird snacks—invented by a Texas roller-rink owner—in a post today, and the Picklesickle website proudly links an article and video from last week&apos;s Washington Post . They&apos;ve been getting little shout-outs for months, which we&apos;re sure has to do with the 20,000-per-month sales figure in the Post&apos;s article. At that rate, they must be cultivating some real fans, right? Not just novelty collectors? But who would want to eat such a thing? Better order a box and find out.

 The Best Of The Best? 
 [Above: a classic from Royale , best old-school burger in New York]
 This list published in the UK&apos;s Guardian is ambitious, to say the least. In 10 cities worldwide, it attempts to pinpoint the best spot for the most famous cuisine, such as pizza in Naples and sushi in Tokyo. Wow. Seems unlikely they could do it, but they use local experts and seem to have a good handle on the scene in each city.

Our bet is that while most of the places listed are likely not the unanimous choice for the very best in their league, they&apos;re probably as good as you can hope for if you&apos;re just passing through a city on vacation. However, now that they&apos;ve made the list, will they stay as good or as fun to visit as they were? Will hordes of British tourists pack L&apos;Antica Pizzeria Da Michele in Naples any more than they had before?

Maybe, but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t explore the city on your own and use that recommendation as a back-up. That&apos;s the good thing about guides like this. They&apos;re just suggestions. And it&apos;s sure fun to read in the meantime.

•Apparently it was a Mexican food weekend at FoodTastic!, because Hilda visited Poblano Cocina Mexicana , where she had duck in mole sauce. We&apos;d never thought of duck mole, but boy does that sound way more exciting that the typical chicken or turkey mole. [ FoodTastic! ]

•The grand opening at the new Novecento in Coral Gables isn&apos;t until March 26, but cJ got in for a pre-opening bite. [ consumable Joy ]

 Norman Van Aken Leaves Tavern-N-Town 
 
Yes, it&apos;s true. Our jaw just dropped while reading the press release. Norman Van Aken was at Tavern-n-Town what, three months? Here&apos;s what Beachside Resort developer Robert Spottswood had to say about it: I have the utmost respect and admiration for Norman; however, his creative vision doesn’t coincide with what we feel Beachside Resort needs at this time. Our parting is amicable, and Norman is remaining on as a consulting corporate chef for Spottswood Hotels. In that position, he will be exploring our participation in high end food and wine events and other culinary projects we have slated for the Florida Keys.

We’ve created a simple steak and fish house menu for Beachside that adheres to the high standards of quality that Van Aken instilled in the project. The new menu at Tavern N Town focuses on wood-grilled local fish, prime steaks, poultry and savory daily specials, along with steakhouse-style side dishes and a menu of small plates, served in a beautiful but laid back atmosphere. Wow. Think he&apos;d consider re-opening Norman&apos;s in the Gables?

 Recycle Those Oyster Shells! 
 
 
An environmental preservation group needs oyster shells. A local restaurant discards hundreds of oyster shells. There&apos;s an obvious solution that should be agreed upon pretty easily, right?

Not exactly. The Loxahatchee River District , the group that needs the shells to encourage oyster growth, has had a difficult time getting Jupiter-area restaurants to participate. Only The Crab House has agreed to help since the start of the project in October.

&quot;We just haven&apos;t had any luck getting other restaurants to participate,&quot; said Jocelyn O&apos;Neill, an organizer of the project. Besides The Crab House, she approached another handful of restaurants, but none was willing to participate.

The practice of oyster-shell recycling has grown in the past few years in a handful of areas; the discarded oyster shells are bundled together and attached to spots underwater. They become homes for larval-stage oysters, which float around looking for shells in which to settle. The oyster reefs in turn provide homes for other animals, like small fish, shrimp and crabs. An added benefit, one that&apos;s gotten some attention in New York City , is that oysters are nature&apos;s filtration system; an adult oyster can filter anywhere from five to 50 gallons of water per day.

There are small programs in place in the Boston area , the Chesapeake Bay and Southwest Florida, but it&apos;s really taken off in the Carolinas, where clearly they are serious about their oysters. Not only did North Carolina set up a number of oyster shell recycling sites (many of which appear to be either seafood restaurants or markets), but legislators also made it illegal to toss oyster shells into solid waste landfills ( statute 130A-309.10 ). Residents and businesses also get a tax break of $1 per bushel of shells.

We&apos;re thinking this could be a great marketing tool for restaurants; imagine a sign in the front or a line on the menu that says &quot;We recycle our oyster shells.&quot; It&apos;s cool to go green nowadays, and if a restaurant can do it at no cost, well, that&apos;s pretty great.
