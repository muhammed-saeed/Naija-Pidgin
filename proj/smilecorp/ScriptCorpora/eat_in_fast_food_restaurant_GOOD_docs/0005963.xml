Obese (Overweight) People Should Avoid Fast Food / Junk Food Restaurants Meal

Although the link between belly fat and health is not entirely clear, experts do know that people with a lot of belly fat are at higher risk of health problems than are people who accumulate fat in other areas — and men are more likely than women to put on weight around the waist.

To lose weight — and keep it off — you have to get regular exercise. This means doing something active most days of the week. Most people need at least 30 minutes a day of moderate exercise to stay healthy. But to shed the pounds in the first place, you may need longer periods of activity.Diet plays an important part in losing weight. Getting more exercise is important, but it is really tough to get enough physical activity to lose belly fat without changing your eating habits.

To lose weight, you have to burn more calories than you consume. This means you need to avoid eating too much food high in fat and carbohydrates, and eat smaller quantities.

Fast-food outlets have become popular with consumers for several reasons. A fast-food restaurant is a restaurant characterized both by food ready to eat quickly after ordering, and by minimal service. One trait shared by all fast food establishments is that the customer pays for the food prior to consuming it. One is that through economies of scale in purchasing and producing food, these companies can deliver food to consumers at a very low cost. In addition, although some people dislike fast food for its predictability, it can be reassuring to a hungry person in a hurry or far from home.Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking. While convenient and inexpensive for a busy lifestyle, fast foods are typically high in calories, fat , saturated fat, sugar, and salt.

The most obvious health threat of eating too much fast food is weight gain - or even obesity. Teens are more at risk than ever of developing type 2 diabetes, a disease that&apos;s linked to overweight and used to affect only adults. But weight gain isn&apos;t the only problem. Too much fast food can drag a person&apos;s body down in other ways. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), what&apos;s important is a person&apos;s average food intake over a few days - not just in a single meal. So if you eat a meal consisting of only junk food, try to balance it with healthier foods the rest of that day and the next.

A new study provides the best evidence to date that eating fast food makes you fat.

Among nearly 3,400 young adults participating in a long-term study, every additional fast food meal they consumed each week correlated with a substantial increase in body mass index (BMI), Dr. Barry M. Popkin of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and colleagues found.

&quot;It&apos;s a large effect,&quot; Popkin told Reuters Health in an interview. &quot;That&apos;s enough of an effect to take you from being non-diabetic to diabetic.&quot;

Food eaten away from home now accounts for up to 42 percent of Americans&apos; calorie intake, Popkin and his team note in their report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. While the increase in restaurant and fast food consumption has occurred at the same time as the rise in obesity, they add, it&apos;s not clear if it&apos;s a contributing factor.

To separate out the effects of fast food meals and meals eaten in traditional restaurants, the researchers looked at 3,394 young adults participating in a heart disease study.

The investigators compared the study participants&apos; consumption of fast foods and restaurant foods during year 7 and year 10 of the study with their BMIs at both time points. BMI is a ratio of weight to height commonly used to determine if a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese or morbidly obese.

The more fast food the subjects ate, the higher was their BMI, Popkin and colleagues found. For each additional fast food meal eaten per week during year 7, BMI increased by 0.13 points, while each additional fast food meal per week at year 10 was tied to a 0.24 rise in BMI. This translates to 0.9 pounds and 1.7 pounds, respectively, for a person 5 foot 10 inches tall.

People whose fast food intake rose between year 7 and year 10 showed a 0.20 increase in BMI.

However, the researchers found no association between meals eaten at traditional restaurants and increases in BMI; in fact, some analyses linked eating more often in restaurants to a slightly lower BMI.

The study confirms, Popkin said, that people who eat more fast food pack on more pounds. &quot;People have been trying to say that, but they didn&apos;t have the kind of evidence that we have now.&quot;
