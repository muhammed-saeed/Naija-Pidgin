Wasabe Japanese Restaurant Buffet
 Comments Ipoh Food Wasabe Japanese Restaurant at 1 Casuarina Ipoh offer the first Japanese Cuisine Buffet in Ipoh as well as fine Ala Carte Japanese food. 

The initial feedback I got about the Japanese Food buffet at Wasabe is kind of mixed up. Some are happy with it while some end up with disappointment. So I took this chance to get a taste on this very first restaurant in Ipoh who serve Japanese food buffet. After all, I like Japanese foods and so as buffet. This time around, Id sure going to fill up to the max with Sushi, Sashimi and Teppanyaki.
 
1 Casuarina Corporate Park is a new place. Located right next to the new Impiana Hotel (formerly known as Casuarina), you can easily locate this Japanese Restaurant by the sign board place at the entrance in front of the business center.
 
I was among the early bird arrived to the scene. There is only one other table which is occupied and we are all-in to get whatever we want. There are 3 main sections in this buffet restaurant. The free-flow Japanese cuisines where you get a whole variety of Japanese food, the Sushi and Sashimi counter and the Teppanyaki counter.
 
Yumm, these raw fleshy and juicy Sashimi are mesmerizing. But not everybody is in for the raw meat as the population in this country grow up on cooked food. Though I have no problem with Sashimi but then, I couldnt tell what is a good Sashimi like.
Okay, you have to order the Sashimi from the helpful waiter/waitress there and they will deliver your order in just a few minutes time.

Want more, no problem. Just raise up your hand with a thumb up and their staff will come over to repeat your order. But if you put up a thumb down, maybe the Sashimi chef will come over holding his Sashimi cutting knife and take your order. Okay, joking only la.
 
Japanese food is artistic. This is a tofu and the other is an egg plant which is served in a small little bowl. They dont just dump it one lump sum altogether to preserve its individual elegant and taste.
 
Some fried squid on the left and a juicy cheese baked oyster on the right plus a grilled fish meat at the bottom. The fried squid is crispy and taste great while the cheese baked oyster were juicy.
 
Crisp looking Tempura. You also got to order this from the staff.
Now, the Soft Shell Crab is big but the Tempura prawns were kind of skinny a bit. All of, it looks better than it taste though. It wasnt so crispy and the soft shell crap was soft all over.
 
I cant get miss with the steamed egg every time I visit a Japanese Restaurant. Theyre so smooth and soft. But then, it got to be hot to get all the flavors out which in this case, not happening. The steamed egg isnt so hot and I guess that screw up its taste.
 
The Teppanyaki counter offer only 3 meat selection which consist of chicken, beef and squid. Vegetable holds a larger varieties which includes bean sprout, ladies finger, cabbage, mushrooms, carrot and onion. You just need to pick up your selection and hand it over to the chef and it will be done in a few minutes time. But this time, you got to pick it up yourself from the counter.
 
The teppanyaki taste quite decent. Definitely not so salty but in addition, it has a bit of that spicy taste which is quite appetizing. But then again, they are lack of varieties here on their Teppanyaki dishes.
 
Fresh oyster with some freshly squeezed lemon juice. I would have a few of this. Wifey wanted to try it out but still lack of that courage. Well, the oyster is very big so it would be easy enough for you to just swallow it up straight into your stomach without chewing.
For me, I still like to chew up the juice out of the shell fish.
 
You just cant miss out that Sushi at a Japanese restaurant. But again, the varieties is kind of lacking still. I was told that they have more types of Sushi and Japanese dishes initially.
 
Some Sashimi Sushi. There are many more great Sushi which they are not putting up. Also, the famous hand roll sushi is also nowhere to be found.
 
Fried Yaki Udon noodle. Apart of fried Udon, they also have fried Soba as well as fried rice.
 
Grilled chicken stick. For this one, juicy ~ no, flavorful ~ no, tender ~ no no.
So, I got nothing much to say.
 
Well, there are a few desserts available such as cakes, coconut jelly and flavored jelly. Apart of that, you could also max up with their selection of ice cream.
 
Lastly, some juice fruits for refreshment and of course, to help up with the digestion.

This buffet dinner cost RM58.00 per person and top up with another 10% service charge. Lunch is also available for RM32.00 per person which has some of the food excluded.

Last saying,
If you like Japanese food and is all-out for the quantity and could compromise with the quality, this should be okay for you. But if you love Japanese food and really want to enjoy a decent Japanese taste, with this same amount of money, I assure you that you could get way better satisfaction with ala carte order. In fact, Wasabe also has an Ala Carte section on the first floor of the restaurant.

Kind of pathetic, given the hype and the price of the buffet. For the same price you can actually get a very decent Japanese meal elsewhere, even in KL.
Thanks for the review anyway. :) #2 Kim (2010-05-03)
now, they have more variety on sushi ady. there are a special menu for customer to order sushi, maki&amp;handroll. #3 popipopia (2010-08-20)
rm58+ is a bit expensive,is that worth? #4 Nicholas Leong (2010-12-11)
With that kind of price we can have better variety&amp;place for buffet! I just went for tao cuisine&amp;the variety is way much more than what Wasabe has to offer. Not recommended. #5 Janet (2011-05-02)
I just try at this restaurant by 01/05/2011. Feel good. But who said don&apos;t have pork? I&apos;d order for the teppanyaki pork. :p #6 grace(2011-6-1) (2011-06-01)
i juz had dinner buffet there at 31may 2011. damn terrible...especially the grilled food...all grilled till charred. especially the stick.when u pick up the stick, it will fracture. less food choice compare with last few months. the price is decress abt RM5-6. but i prefer pay high n get nice food. now the dinner buffet there is cost RM56.8. and the people who server there is very slow come to take order. last time when u raise the hand, the waitress will come faster. and the food server very slow. untill the food we thought is finish so we take order again. but at the end all food is repeat order. WON&apos;T VISIT THERE AGAIN IN 3RD TIME. thanx.WILL POST THE PHOTO AT THE FACEBOOK SOON. #7 First and last time..... (2011-10-03)
Visited this place for the 1st time yesterday with my family. Anticipating to have a wonderful time lunching it out at this restaurant. It turns out to be my first and last time instead. Shows no standard for a full flight japanese rest. Dun be con by those tempting photos shown above. The stuff provided for steamboat was sheer disappointing. Only a marginal of each variety was placed on to a tray, the quantity and all were normal cheap stuff. The small pieces of salmon belly cut into hardly 1 inch piece was truly unbelivelable. Replenishment of food on the tray were poor which took about 20 minutes. Been walking round and round like an insane fellow for 4 times and yet the stuff has not been replenished. The teppan sucks. The sotong teppan which i ordered was damn horrible. Taste was bad and the squids taste like vegetarian sotong (tasteless)and the accompanied vege was filled with mainly cabbage with hardly any small quantity of bean sprouts. The cheap and hard shelled teppan prawn was also not fresh and flesh was soft. The person/s who prepared this dish has hardly any experience and could have been done by an inexperienced foreiger staff. Most of the grilled food was also bad. Mainly turns out over burn till charred including the stick itself. Tucking in carbon instead of its original. Overall the preparation and supplies of the food and espacially for the steamboat has left me truly disappointed. Not qualified to be a jap food outlet. Another matter is that my youngest son who was in year 4 was charged as an adult.How much can a year 4 student eat?? The rest of my family members to be exact was 5 and all were charged as adults. No problem about that as since we were all qualified. The question is since all of us are charged as adults why can&apos;t the youngest be charged as a child&apos;s rate as he is only in year 4??. Dun&apos;t they want any further business to come by? Whatever it is, this outlet is not recommended to anyone. If you dun believe then you&apos;ll be the judge. There are better qualified jap reataurants out there such as Alaii and Kampai. I wouldn&apos;t have patronise this place had not been my son&apos;s request. Truly disappointed !! #8 CK ( 2011-11-18) (2011-10-18)
My wife and I have tried it before. If you intend to go there for lunch,I think they will serve you faster. But if you want to try during the public holidays, it is a big NO! Maybe they are lack of staffs. #9 Like A Lou Sai (2011-12-13)
Are any free for birthday?? #10 Annie (2012-02-04)
I tried once.. nice..
So if I go at weekend after 2pm still consider lunch ?
How&apos;s da price ? :) Please Comment
