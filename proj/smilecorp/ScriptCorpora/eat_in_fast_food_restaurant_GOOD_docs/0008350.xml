 MovieDynamic : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 05:39 GMT   78 points I&apos;m really, really hungry. 
 
 vogz : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 05:42 GMT   13 points toughie considering i dont have many of these by me anymore...i&apos;m also not positive how happy i am with the (type) snack...i didn&apos;t really know what i was expecting out of it 
 
 MovieDynamic : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 05:43 GMT   36 points You really have to change the &quot;Mexican&quot; next to Taco Bell. If that&apos;s Mexican I&apos;m Steven Spielberg. 
 
 jaspa : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 05:55 GMT   31 points I&apos;m surprised there&apos;s no Krispy Kreme. I guess that must be a midwest-only thing? Also no Häagen-Dazs or Ben and Jerrys. Surprising. Agree with MovieDynamic, after taking this, I&apos;m headed to Taco Bell. Gotta love that &quot;authentic&quot; Mexican food. 
 
 Cheeseknight : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 05:58 GMT   19 points Krispy Kremes are where I live too (NC). I&apos;m shocked Dunkin Donuts made the list and they didn&apos;t. Starbucks should list &quot;Coffee&quot; btw. 
 
 smuglapse : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 05:59 GMT   13 points @Jaspa: We have Krispy Kremes in Florida and I was surprised it wasn&apos;t listed either.
I&apos;m sad because of the way I spelled &quot;Carls Jr&apos;s&quot;, &quot;Little Caesar&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Einstein Bros.&quot; Also, I wouldn&apos;t consider CiCi&apos;s or Fuddruckers as fast food. But otherwise, cool quiz. 
 
 Jaspers : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:10 GMT   32 points A couple of these I&apos;ve never heard of. Is it considered broadening my horizons if I&apos;m still eating fast food? 
 
 brianc : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:11 GMT   25 points starbucks, dunkin donuts are definitely coffee places, not &quot;snack&quot;. also, i know dairy queen sells burgers, but i wouldn&apos;t think of them as a burger place. is their place on this list including ice cream sales? because if not, them (and coldstone and baskin robbins) should just be listed as ice cream 
 
 DarkFlash: Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:12 GMT   14 points Haven&apos;t heard of at least 10 of these, let alone eaten at half. That&apos;s what the westside of Cincinnati will do to you, with our Skyline and PennStation taking away from everything else 
 
 dystopian : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:25 GMT   12 points Being from Cincinnati, I also naively put Goldstar and PennStation. haha 
 
 bsd987 : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:27 GMT   11 points if you accept carl&apos;s jr and hardees separately, you should force rally and checkers separate 
 
 IHateRegistering : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:30 GMT   11 points Its amazing the size difference between the top an the bottom of this list. McDonalds is across the globe while In-N-Out Burger is only in 4 states (nearly all of them are in California though). 
 
 onetheta: Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:54 GMT   17 points From about #13 down these companies should consider expanding into the UK more. We have thousands of McD&apos;s KFC&apos;s and Subways so it can be done. 
 
 HollywoodLeo : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:54 GMT   3 points Rubio&apos;s! 
 
 HollywoodLeo : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:55 GMT   19 points @I_Hate_Registering, they need to put In-N-Out in the other 46 states. 

I miss In-N-Out :( 
 
 Morby : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 06:59 GMT   15 points Fun quiz. You should put that it&apos;s based on US sales, which it obviously is. 
 
 hornplayer : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 07:00 GMT   8 points I spelled it &quot;in and out&quot;, I didn&apos;t realize it was a single &quot;N&quot;. Good quiz. I haven&apos;t heard of some of these, they must be regional. 
 
 GeminiNL : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 07:03 GMT   8 points Only got the top 8 answers. I haven&apos;t even heard of most of the rest. Maybe the fact that I&apos;m Dutch contributed to that, we don&apos;t have a lot of different fast-food restaurants. 
 
 MRL : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 07:15 GMT   18 points The list is from Quick Serve Magazine; the classification of Starbucks as &quot;Snack&quot; and the separation or non-separation of various chains is by them, not Sporcle. 
 
 Lilybert : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 07:27 GMT   10 points No Krusty?! ;-)) . . . . . . . . . . . . I&apos;ve always wondered what they mean by &quot;Sbarro&quot;. It&apos;s not Italian, does it mean something in English?

 xander : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 08:11 GMT   -14 points Fun! The next quiz should be rating which fast food place offers the best milkshake! 
 
 yankeessuck8991 : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 08:17 GMT   -2 points in n out ftw! 
 
 Observer: Mar 2nd, 2009 at 08:32 GMT   13 points I got most of these by doing a mental drive through the Atlanta area...I&apos;m upset that Krispy Kreme isn&apos;t there. They are better than dunkin... 
 
 Rackie : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 08:41 GMT   10 points Wow this was hard... I think we only have about 8 or 9 of these in the UK... 
 
 epaminondus : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 10:42 GMT   10 points Krispy Kreme is mainly a Southern to Midwest thing. If you head Northeast, there&apos;s a Dunkin on every corner. The difference is that lots of people go to Dunkin just for coffee as a cheap alternative to places like Starbucks (or when you just want to get your coffee and leave - Dunkin&apos;s pink and orange decor doesn&apos;t encourage loitering as much as Starbuck&apos;s cushy chairs and free wi-fi.) Krispy Kreme might have less US sales, but their donuts taste better, you can find them installed in many convenience shops and grocery stores, and they&apos;ve expanded to the UK. Take that, cakey Dunkin donut. I&apos;ll choose your yeast-based cousin over you any day of the week. 
 
 Cuthbert_Twilley : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 11:37 GMT   14 points Five Guys will be on here soon. Best burgers ever! I&apos;m probably biased, but I&apos;ve been eating them since the first one opened. 
 
 newenglander : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 11:53 GMT   15 points one of the reasons this quiz is hard is because a lot of these chains are only in certain parts of the country. 
 
 lulubelles : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 12:00 GMT   5 points aww krispy kremes are the best thing ever, they kick all our english doughnuts arses! the xmas ones are best, with mincemeat in the middle 
 
 colincorgi : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 12:14 GMT   11 points I have to agree with Cuthbert -- I generally avoid fast food, but Five Guys is where I make an exception. 
 
 Ribhump : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 12:16 GMT   -4 points where&apos;s wimpy, even using wikipedia it appears Wimpy much bigger than Fuddruckers 260 worldwide restaurants 
 
 Kamara853 : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 12:22 GMT   15 points Having worked at fuddruckers, I don&apos;t see how it&apos;s a quick service restaurant by any stretch of the imagination... 
 
 Bretzky : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 12:25 GMT   1 point This quiz makes me wish we had a Checker&apos;s in the Pittsburgh area. I haven&apos;t had one of their burgers since I left DC. Best fast food burger you can get.

BTW, give me a Dunkin&apos; Donuts doughnut over a Krispy Kreme one any day of the week. Biting into a Krispy Kreme doughnut is like drinking a bottle of frying oil.

 Joe_Ball : Mar 2nd, 2009 at 12:35 GMT   -29 points I got confused - Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell are all owned by Yum! International, which is what I tried to enter, but it didn&apos;t work.

 truth in advertising: Mar 2nd, 2009 at 12:45 GMT   5 points fwiw, Krispy Kreme had expanded into California and was present in many supermarkets. But recently they haven&apos;t been there anymore and I heard that they were cutting back nationally. This survey was probably taken after their cutbacks.
