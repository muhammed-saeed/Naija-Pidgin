Juicy, sloppy, greasy and amazingly flavorful just the way a burger should be! No health food here.

The Hungry Onion is a late 50s-early 60s drive-up burger joint. Before drive-thru restaurants existed, these places had waitresses who brought food to your car on trays that mounted on the driver&apos;s side window. The place is on one of the main streets of old Meridian and is a great place to get a burger, fries (or tater tots!). Recommended... More

The food is tasty and well cooked. The fries and tater tots are to die for. They still have car hops that are quick and personable. All in all, a nice experience every time we go there.
