Eden (Phoenix, Arizona )



Skip. I love that you are the diabolic hater.keep up the good work. love the show

Roller (Kentucky)



Well, we had the #1 ranking for one day...what can I say D. Downey was the man he took it to us and couldn&apos;t be stopped.

Chris Fiegler (Latham,NY)



What will be the next sport that a woman will beat a man for the first time in history?

rockit surjin (hurricane)



TRADE PETERSON!!! seriously, cause you can&apos;t trust him (especially inside either red zone) not to put it on the rug and lookat what you need and the players/picks you could get for him!vikes could make up for herschel trade. come on skip tell em thetruth!

Glyn (Freeman)



What is the deal with the Skip Bayless hate on the New Orleans Saints?! We have arguably one of the best offenses of all time, and I understand that after our starters went down on defense, our ranking decreased. But do yards against really matter when in the end you are taking the ball away from your opponent at an alarming rate?? Give it up Skip, we had and have a much better chance than your packers or Minnesota Favre&apos;s.

Keith (Baltimore (MD))



Good morning, I agree with Skip to me Lebron is over rated. He&apos;ll always be a good player himself but when will he start winning titles?? Unless you win atleast one title where do you stand as one of the greatest.. (He hasn&apos;t made everyone around him better yet) sometimes it&apos;s just the Lebron show.

Sterling Roig (Emerson, NJ)



Bayless.....you have been a Saints hater all season. Now you have to eat it and you STILL won&apos;t give them credit. Guess what! Your beloved Dallas Cowboys got spanked by the Vikings and the Saints D put a hurt on the team that schooled YOUR team. For once, JUST FOR ONCE, admit that you have been wrong about the Saints.

rockit surjin (hurricane, wv)



should the vikes think about trading peterson? you know he&apos;s gonna continue to fumble cause it&apos;s in his head now too and you might pull off a herschel walker and get a franchise QB a very good RB (and maybe more, who knows).

mod   (9:53 AM) 



good news Knuckleheads....more food talk today, on the show......strap a napkin around your neck and stay tuned...
 
tienhy (huynh )



i&apos;m with skip. adriane peterson sucks. barry sanders played for the worst franchise in history, never had a passing game or a full line, thanks to the run n shoot. he may run &quot;angry&quot;, but has no idea how to hit people, he&apos;s no chris johnson or even jamal charles.

Nathan Louis (Greeley,CO)



I do usually disagree with Skip, about trashing the premiere players. Then again im origanlly raised in ILL, therefore I have, Butkus, Ditika, Sweetness, and MR. JORDAN. Sweetness being my favorite,the best back ive ever seen.I know I know football and Adrain Peterson is overated !!!

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Morning first take...Roller, it&apos;s time for your boy Calipari to start coaching now...we know he can recruit and get rid of dead wood...now it&apos;s time to make them better and learn poise at the end of close games...

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Good morning room! Good morning 1st Take!

chris (SC)



whats up everyone

Kyle (Michigan)



Dwayne Wade had a better game than LeBron James last night. They each had 32 points, but you guys failed to mention that Dwayne Wade had more assists, steals, rebounds, AND blocks....on a worse team. I&apos;m a Heat fan, but even I have to admit the Cavs are a better overall team. James has more talent around him, so the fact they only beat a mediocre Heat team by one is actually not impressive. Therefore, LeBron James is not King James. He&apos;s a great player, but he&apos;s not the greatest.

Jeremy (Orlando)



Morning First Take. I bet skip will say J. Wall is the worst player in college today.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I knew we were talking about all that food yesterday for a reason

james (wyoming)



MAN V. FOOD!!! Right on ESPN!

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I hear Calipari was so upset about last night that he&apos;s actually making the players enroll in classes. Good morning, First Take chatters!

chris (SC)



That was a good game last night.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Adam Richman going to be on the show today, mod?

mod   (10:02 AM) 



yep, he&apos;s here now
 
Chris (Las Vegas, NV)



Being number 1 in college basketball is a curse!

matt (maine)



PASS INTERFAIRENCE....A BALL THAT WAS NOT A CATCH? that game was fixed........i believe football is fixed..just like basketball

mrbrandon225 (Baton Rouge, LA)



The Saints won the game, the Vikings weren&apos;t out there making theirselves fumble. The defense took the ball away from several different players. Brett Favre didn&apos;t beat his self up, the Saints defense did that too.

Malcolm Phifer (Plainfield, IL)



The line on any game posted by the odds makers does not reflect what they think the point difference of the game will be. It is a value calculated to get 50 % of the bettors to bet on team A and 50% of the bettors to bet on team B. So the 3 1/2 line on the Superbowl does not reflect oddsmakers belief that the Colts are 3 1/2 points better than the Saints, but this line will induce 50/50 betting on the game.

james (wyoming)



saints give up way too much to survive a shoot-out with peyton

joey (tx)



Are people still crying about the football game? Move on!

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Love &apos;Man v Food.&apos; My wife and kids are also fans although I think some of what he does repulses my wife.

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Morning first take...Obama was UK bad luck charm yesterday...USC has now beaten UK 3 times in a row

joey (tx)



haha thats what people get for not picking Texas as the top 3 on 1st and 10 and all about Kentucky

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



You only trade AP if you are getting a top five RB back in return. Despite his hands issue, he&apos;s still very talented.

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Saints fans will enver admit it because they are ignorant, but there were SO many blown calls by the refs that went the Saints way, especially in overtime. First off, that was NOT pass interference. He didn&apos;t even touch im AND the ball was uncatchable. Secondly, Colston did NOT make that catch! It hit the ground!

Reischea   (10:05 AM) 



Morning Nation!Should have a lot of fun with the show today. And wouldn&apos;t you know it, food will be involved.Oh, a correction for those who missed it by me yesterday... the Bread Pudding spot in Fresno... Cracked Pepper is the name of the restaurant, Cracked Pepper, NOT Cracker Barrel. My bad! :-)
 
megan (ohio)



mornin chat! mmmmm food again, what better way to spend the time til superbowl!

Mickey (Memphis )



Where are those kentucky fans this morning? I told you yesterday that coach cal can&apos;t coach. I,m from Memphis, so I should know.

trai ((big blue nation))



calipari should have got off his butt,he got out coached.wall,had a way inferior player guarding him;and why didn&apos;t we go to a 2-3 zone,they don&apos;t have not one dang shooter. what a miracle by one man

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Yea, Tiki had a problem handling the football and it eventually got fixed. AP will be ok

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Joey: You mean the same Texas that just had back-to-back losses? Sorry but right now, Syracuse is a better team.

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Are you guys serious about trading AP? That would never happen. His signing bonus is WAY too big and the cap hit against the Vikings would cripple them from making any other moves at all. Do you guys even know how football works?

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Good thing i ate breakfast and ran it off this morning

Brian (SoCal)



Good morning all. Had to leave early and missed the cookie debate.

matt (maine)



bre was clearly hit below the wast on 1 of his picks....hello....THE BRADY RULE.......THINK THE NFL GAVE THE GAME TO THE SAINTS

joey (tx)



Haha really? Syracuse!! Haha. Thanks I needed a laugh.

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Morning all

james (wyoming)



kentucky - filet - last night just bad game - but skip&apos;s right, they&apos;re very young and still formative, but I still say filet

Manny R. (LA)



Wrong Adam Jay you guys need Adam G

Roller (Kentucky)



Hey, we got beat nothing more to say.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Syracuse should be #1 right now

mod   (10:07 AM) 



way to face the music Roller, &apos;Cats will be fine, its one loss
 
New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



Morning, the question is did the refs try to give Favre the game?

chris (SC)



jeremy you were right about skip!!!

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Ok if this was the NBA playoffs i would believe that the refs gave a game to a team, but not the NFL

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



you missed a good cookie debate yesterday!!

Roller (Kentucky)



Tell Skip that S. Car. may not be that good but Downey couldn&apos;t be stopped...not by UK anyway.

Todd (Portland)



hey mod, where&apos;s dana at this morning?

mod   (10:08 AM) 



Dana&apos;s at XGames
 
J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Apparently Joey doesn&apos;t watch much college hoops that does not involve a team outside the state of Texas. &apos;Cuse is 20-1 Joey. Last I checked, one loss in a season is still better than two in a week.

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



The GameCocks gave the blueprint on how to beat Kentucky last night. They put the 4 man on John Wall took him off his game a little bit.

Brian (SoCal)



sunday&apos;s games are over. If your team lost deal with it. Do not make up excuses. Every game has blown calls.

mod   (10:08 AM) 



exactly Brian, its WEDNESDAY already!
 
james (wyoming)



Kentucky will get past sweet sixteen

Jonathan (ATL)



I guess First Take finally got the memo that college basketball season started 2 months ago. About time you give the hoopsters some coverage.

Manny R. (LA)



Come on no more cookie talk please

mod   (10:09 AM) 



no cookie talk today...we&apos;ve got other food items to discuss...stay tuned
 
J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



You&apos;re OK, Roller. Have to admire anyone who comes here and takes the ribbing.

chris (SC)



It&apos;s just one game though we knew they wasn&apos;t going to go undefeated

tony meeks (yankton,SD)



Skip, do u miss woody paige sitting across from you now? i love it when u guys would get into heated debates about everything in sports

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@Brian (SoCal) ur right dude get over it...

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



thx Brian, I have heard all kinds of excuses about the Vikes being the better team

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Kansas

Brett (Boise)



Mid season #1 in NCAA is a curse. How many have gone down this year already?

trai ((big blue nation))



come on skip the moons were alligned yesterday venus,nadal,lost. serena almost lost and ky. lost

John (Delaware)



The Eagles shouldn&apos;t trade Mcnabb, but probably will if they can get a first round pick, thoughts?

mod   (10:10 AM) 



rankings are much more fluid in college hoops than college football, change every week, more games, etc....as long as you set yourself up for a 1-seed come selection Sunday...
 
Brian (SoCal)



doesn&apos;t matter who is ranked #1 in NCAA hoops cause they have a TOURNAMENT to decide who is best. Just win the games and cut down the nets.

john (panama city bch, fl)



Morning Mod- First Take....i&apos;m hungry- guess Ky ain&apos;t!

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@mod wat do u got in mind for today??

mod   (10:11 AM) 



I&apos;m deferring to a pro in the house today, some dude from Food Network giving us a Super spread...
 
Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Kentucky will probably get a 1 seed anyway come tourney time, they&apos;re fine

Roller (Kentucky)



Syracuse is better than Kansas or Texas.

Careem (Washington, DC)



Kansa is still the best team in America. go KU

Mickey (Memphis )



LOL@roller from Kentucky. You should was saying a lot yesterday.

james (wyoming)



Sorry skip, but syracuse is better - they got Boheim

trai ((big blue nation))



rob u are worser than skip,are u skip&apos;s brother

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



I have heard that the vikes were the better team but they had all season long to obtain the #1 seed, which they didn&apos;t because they were not better and they had the chance to prove it head up and that didn&apos;t happen either

james (wyoming)



Eagles should trade if they get value for McNabb, but has to be first rd pick n player or two

bobby (georgia)



the eagles should trade mcnabb can&apos;t win the big game especially against dallas go cowboys

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Ok I got it...Mod = Scott Van Pelt.

Ray (Home)



Look the saints were flag 9 times and the Minny 5 times can someone tell me how did the saints get all the calls

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I think we&apos;ll be talking a lot about beef products in the chat today. Adam does a lot of burger and steak challenges.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I&apos;ve always been a McNabb fan but we&apos;ve seen the best of him

joey (tx)



No the better team is the better team! More losses dont matter. Remember when North Carolina lost a few and people wrote them off, they were still the better team. Just like Texas is better than Syracuse.

Jim (Y-town)



HeySkip,Kansas was loaded with seniors in 2003 and Syracuse had freshman and guess who won.CUSE no.1

james (wyoming)



Jim Boeheim is best college basketball coach right now, period

john (panama city bch, fl)



Serious question- WHY encourage ppl to TEXT donations to Haiti(standard rates apply)- you give TEN dollars and Nextel,Sprint AT&amp;T or Verizon gets a TEN dollar donation,too! Why not go to redcross.org and give TWENTY dollars?

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Look I think the Vikings may be more talented than the Saints but bottom line is they didn&apos;t execute Sunday and the Saints did. For that day the Saints were better and really that&apos;s the only day that mattered. Moving on.

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@John (Delaware) but they prob will,philly media kills him every time they lose,say he is a bum,let him go to another team and they will c he still got something left!

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Did Trai just say &quot;worser&quot;? Wow. Did you go to elementary school?

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



6 or 8 teams will bounce around at the top and at the end of the season and conference tournaments those teams will be top seeds in the big dance

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Ritchie would have made the Pro Bowl this year...David Garrard did

john (panama city bch, fl)



Is Joey Chestnutt gonna be a surprise guest?

Brian (SoCal)



Let&apos;s see Skip do one of the HOT chile challenges. Want to see him sweat.

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@mod ooh the man-vs-food dude,he eats some nasty stuff!!

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Jon Ritchie for Pro Bowl this year...

John (Delaware)



Yeah i worry mcnabb truly can&apos;t win the big game, im his biggest fan but its time to go

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



So Texas is better than Syracuse because Joey says so. Got it.

Roller (Kentucky)



My Eagles are talking about trading McNabb...need to think about trading Andy Reid.

megan (ohio)



do you get some of that food too mod? or do you have to snag some when no-ones lookin?

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Ritchie I got a call to play in the pro bowl come on this game is redunk (Stu Scott voice)

John (Delaware)



yeaqh its a joke that garrad is going to the pro bowl

Jim (Y-town)



when push comes to shove the BIG EAST is the best and deepest conf.

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



good comment JB, thx

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



if the saints go t ALL the calls, how did the get MORE flags?

james (wyoming)



McNabb still an elite QB and philly would be stupid to let him go without a serious return. McNabb can still win a championship

trai ((big blue nation))



ky has some talent,but when the experiance comes watch out

Mike (Morgantown)



Skip, did you watch the UK game last night? The freshman were the only ones playing with &quot;intensity&quot; the upperclassmen disappeared! And why doesn&apos;t ESPN show more love to Cousins he is the key for UK to win a national title this year!

Jonathan (ATL)



Brian&apos;s right......the polls in college hoops are pretty meaningless because of the tournament. They&apos;re good for a measurement of how good you are but that&apos;s about it. That what makes college hoops great.

Ray (Home)



Did Mcnabb get to the SB? Lost to the Pats and spygate?

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Nobody wants No. 1 this year get the No. 1 spot loose one of the next two games.

Chris (Las Vegas, NV)



Mcnabb is going to be a viking

Brian (SoCal)



Man vs. Food craziest challenge ws the &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot;. Like 2 gallons of ice cream subdae.

megan (ohio)



who would you like to see instead of reid, roller? any ideas?

bobby (georgia)



they should trade mcnabb

john (panama city bch, fl)



Adam G.- nope- gottabe a Mike Wilbon fan, hence the &quot;knucklehead&quot; addresses. It ain&apos;t Mike tho, cuz he couldn&apos;t post as fast- being something of a knucklehead, himself!

tropzone (Hattiesburg,Mississippi)



The saints in da superbowl has to be one of the top 50 greatest moments in history

james (wyoming)



Caddy Mike that&apos;s hilarious

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Dude... sorry but believe it or not worser is actually a word

JP (Baton Rouge)



What&apos;s interesting is last years game (Saints vs Vikings) the Vikings won 30 to 27 and the Saints had 4 tunrovers? thats just crazy!

james (wyoming)



mod&apos;s probably an intern lol

MOD (Tampa, FL)



John you&apos;re trying to hard

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



ESPN should trade mod

Roller (Kentucky)



Mod is running things...he doesn&apos;t need to ask for anything especially food. haha

james (wyoming)



Mike - right! underclassmen at one point outscored the others 20-0 in second half

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Why are people still crying about calls in a game from 3 days ago?!!! Build a bridge... get over it

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Adam Richman will eat Skip as a appetizer......book it!!

Jim (Y-town)



Texas and Kansas would have 5-6 losses if in the BIG EAST on a yearly schedule

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



I wouldnt blame the Eagles post season failure on Mc5

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I heard JoMarcus Russel and Derek Anderson were going to the pro bowl

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Great point John(panama) about the donations...sadly, I&apos;m afraid much of the money donated by generous people will not get to where it is needed

james (wyoming)



Wes - funniest thing posted today!

john (panama city bch, fl)



Mod and Buzz gonna be fightin over that buffet like seagulls over a dead carp- SWING THAT CAMERA AROUND,lol

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



ur right JP

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@tropzone (Hattiesburg,Mississippi) y is it one of the greatest moments in history?????

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Saints and Super Bowl - Never thought I would see it in my lifetime!!!

Jonathan (ATL)



I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the Vikings give up one of their QBs (Sage or Jackson) and maybe Chester Taylor plus a 2nd or 3rd round pick to get McNabb.

John (Delaware)



no the eagles defense lost the playoff game

Manny R. (LA)



TRADE PROPOSAL: Mod moves to John&apos;s basement for John to become the mod straight up.

John (Delaware)



kevin kolb throws a better ball than mcnabb anyway but still will suck to see him go

james (wyoming)



MAN V. SKIP!!!

Jim (Y-town)



I am a Browns fan and the only way DA is going is by buying a ticket

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Let&apos;s keep in mind that this expert coach is on the sidelines while Colts and their &quot;inferior offensive line&quot; are still playing for the title...

Mickey (Memphis )



Who do skip work for, the Washington Post. He can&apos;t give up his source. LOL

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Yes &quot;worser&quot; is a technically a word, but it&apos;s not gramatically correct. Not even close.

trai ((big blue nation))



rob needs his coffee cheacked

kevin (euclid, OH)



ya, russell and anderson got seats in my section

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



skip just said Brees is noy a hot QB

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



@ Jonathan - Chester Taylor is a free agent

Jonathan (ATL)



Rob&apos;s right....Bush is the X factor for the Saints. But Bush really hasn&apos;t shown up in a significant way except for one game this season. He won&apos;t show up for the SB. Colts win.

Brian (SoCal)



PIZZA. All the way. maybe a side of wings.

Roller (Kentucky)



Pizza

ben (nc)



why is no one hating on the saints D? their late hits on bret changed the game and their legal (but cheap) hit on Warner was kinda classless.

john (panama city bch, fl)



ain&apos;t in a basement- i&apos;m in a trailer by the river, thx anyway...besides NOBODY could replace Mod(Rhymes w/ God)

bobby (georgia)



skip, brees can compete with manning can get hot and be just as good as manning

Brian (SoCal)



Did richman bring cookies?

megan (ohio)



&apos;worser&apos; may be a word , but it sure ain&apos;t proper english!! ; )

Reemo (Washington, DC)



The Colts have won every game that they have tried to win. Im pretty sure that they&apos;re trying to win this one. Colts 27- Saints 24

Jonathan (ATL)



Skip&apos;s right....I think the Saints will be like a deer looking into headlights come SB Sunday. Colts will come out ready to take care of business based on experience. Colts win.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



SOME NY PIZZA!!!

Jim (Y-town)



PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



If pizza is the answer, what is the delicious question?

chris (SC)



Hot Wings!!!!!!

Manny R. (LA)



Skip what Saints games do you watch, any? Brees is a beast son

Brian (SoCal)



PIZZA. All the way. maybe a side of wings.

Brian (SoCal)



PIZZA. All the way. maybe a side of wings.

Nathan (Daytona Beach)



Saints will get expose..Defense isnt that good..Offense is good but the vikings stop them in secord half

Matt (Laramie, WY)



I usually agree with Skip but not giving the Saints a chance is crazy, Indy&apos;s D&apos; either and when the Saints get it together they can score at will.

rockit surjin (hurricane, wv)



should the vikes trade petersobn??? seriously, you can&apos;t trust him with the ball cause it&apos;s in his head now and think about what you could get for him! they need a QB and RB&apos;s are plentiful but a future franchis/very good QB is a must (who knows, they might be able to pull off a herschel type trade). whatcha think?

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



SAINTS have more weapons than Bush. Colts have 3, we have 7

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Pizza............and...........beer!!!!!!

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Skip lives in a VAN down by the RIVER

stacy (georgetown)



pizza

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Brick Oven Pizza period.

Don (Detroit)



Rob Parker again?? Why do they continue to give this dude air-time? I vote for Pizza!

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



Folks been saying saints get exposed all year, i&apos;m loving this exposition stuff. it got us to the supwebowl

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Colts have Wayne Clark Collie Garcon Manning

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@ben (nc) who cares those games r over and in the books...lets look to the superbowl!! plz people let it go!!!

john (panama city bch, fl)



Pretty much ANY finger food- you just don&apos;t wanna be tied down with a plate, knife and fork- ya know?

stacy (georgetown)



hey reish

Reischea   (10:25 AM) 



Hi Stacy
 
Franc (Kennesaw GA)



There&apos;s a restaurant here that has a challenge that if you can eat an 11 lb pizza pie you get $500!!!

John (Delaware)



trade peterson! your an idiot any team would kill for him fumbles and all

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I think &apos;worser&apos; was coined by some SEC school.

Nathan (Daytona Beach)



Wings all the way

Matt (Laramie, WY)



New York pizza is the best... thin, cheesy and greasy!!!

Brian (SoCal)



I just want an exciting game. To see those two offenses running on all cylinders and blow up the scorecoard.

trai ((big blue nation))



baby back ribs,hot wings,chili,nachos;teqilla.(superbowl menu)

Jim (Y-town)



Rob Parker is a homer!!!!!!!!!

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



pizza,wings for me

Reischea   (10:26 AM) 



Ohh the pain Franc, wonder if Man v Food has that spot on his calendar?
 
Roller (Kentucky)



megan: somebody that will use the run game more and let McNabb run more and not just pass the ball 98% of the time.

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida) thats y u dont do the cell phone donation,just go to red cross and donate,all the $ u donate WILL get to who needs it!!

trai ((big blue nation))



patrick patterson needs to step up and put those freash. in their place it&apos;s his team and calipari needs to back him or else he can hit the road to..........

john (panama city bch, fl)



Why trade for Donnie McNabb- he&apos;s almost as old as bERT- get Tebow or McCoy(if they are still around that late)

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



whats up with Tebow?

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



No problem NO 4 Ever. I&apos;m a Vikings fan and much as that game hurt, I have to give the Saints credit. The Vikings had plenty of opportunities and didn&apos;t get the job done. Great game looking back on it (well at least in terms of drama) but just wish it could have gone the other way. I&apos;ve been waiting a long time to see the Vikes back in the Super Bowl but heck, you folks have never been.

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@Roller (Kentucky) not gonna happen,mcnabb will go first,no way they r bouncing reid.

ben (nc)



if lebron thinks he could play in the nfl, let him do it in the pro bowl. thats the ONLY way people will watch it

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



rob parker is ok...its that ryan stewart dude who dont know wat he is talking about

ben (nc)



Rob&apos;s got a tough job bc ALLLL of the detroit teams are terrible except the red wings

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



i think Brees will expose the Colts weak corners, that&apos;s the real story

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Joel(Stanwood,Wa) that is a classic line...never get&apos;s old

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Hey Reish

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Better style of pizza: New York or Chicago? I&apos;ll go with the one that isn&apos;t a deep bowl of sauce that can be picked up, folded and properly consumed.

Reischea   (10:27 AM)

Nathan (Daytona Beach)



No vikings mistakes got you guys in the super bowl

Roller (Kentucky)



Can the human stomach hold 11 lbs of pizza...that is a lot of pizza?!

Billy (LAS VEGAS NV)



Jay, how do you deal with Skip&apos;s idiodic comments about pro athletes?I don&apos;t see how he can sit there ad argue with other pro athletes either.He is not an athlete,or if he was he wasn&apos;t very good.His opinion to me is REDONKULAS.

Nathan (Daytona Beach)



@trai you better have the pink stuff if your going to eat all that

megan (ohio)



yeah, i tend to agree, roller, mcnabb isnt the problem.

john (panama city bch, fl)



J.B&gt;- honey, HUSH- we don&apos;t need &quot;worser&quot;- we got &quot;geaux&quot;,lol

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I think Adam did the 11-lb. pizza challenge already.

John (Delaware)



tim tebow is going to be trash if he plays qb in the nfl he has no volocity on the ball

Matt (Laramie, WY)



ESPN the new Food Network, yesterday it was cookies and today pizza what is the food of the day for tomorrow?

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



JB you&apos; re right, refs made it to dramatic

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Jeff (PA) Ryan isnt as bad as Scoop. Scoop seems like hes there to agree with skip lol

Mickey (Memphis )



I say BBQ ribs. I,m from Memphis remember.

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC) i heard he was sucking it up trying to take snaps from the center...its always been shotgun for him...he is gonna b a TE not a QB

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Reish, be completely honest, do you think the Refs gave the Saints a few calls in OT? I think they were afraid of the backlash from the fans if they overturned the calls...

colonel (kentucky)



FRIED CHICKEN!!!

james (wyoming)



Tebow can definitely put some heat on the ball - a good arm , not great but good

Reischea   (10:29 AM) 



John, Tebow obviously needs to make adjustments to his throwing position, which will more likely improve the velocity. I don&apos;t know if he can make it happen, but I do know he will work his tail off to succeed no matter what.
 
Brian (SoCal)



Indy going with the cookies, classic.

Mike (Morgantown)



They should bet part of the city budget, make it an interesting bet!

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



ridiculous Joel, lol

Wes (Big Orange Country)



anybody like chitlins?????

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



In that challenge you can have a partner and split the $500! But ONE partner is all you can have

Billy (LAS VEGAS NV)



Jay can you tell me how does Skip think he is right about pro athletes?

kevin (euclid, OH)



i wanna see Skip go up against Ray Lewis in 1st and ten

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



John (PCB): the &apos;geaux&apos; thing made me laugh. Thanks (or is it &apos;thanx&apos; in SEC country?).

Roller (Kentucky)



I can always count on my friend J.B. for the SEC love. lol

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Jeff (Pittsburg) Thanks...That&apos;s what I did, but in a lot of cases, even like Katrina, often times sadly corruption happens

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



I&apos;ve been to St. Elmo&apos;s when I lived in Indy...the Steaks are great and the Shrimp Cocktail sauce is hot and awesome...

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Chitlins???!!! aaaaaaaand i just threw up all over my laptop!!!

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Food of the day for Thursday, Rocky Mountain Oysters!!!

Brian (SoCal)



Why would anyone from NO want to get seafood from Indy.

Branden (Florida)



Flash and the Akron Hammer are going to combine to become the best duo in NBA history!

john (panama city bch, fl)



just thx

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



How is that ridiculous new_orleans_4_ever? Do you really think that ball was catchable on the PI call? He barely even laid a finger on him too. Do you REALLY think Colston caught that ball and it DIDN&apos;T bounce off the ground? Come on man. Get past your bias.

james (wyoming)



Tebow probably the hardest working college football player this decade

John (Delaware)



i actually hope tebow is successful i just dont see it

john (panama city bch, fl)



I give Tebow 5 yrs in the NFL- then off to be a missionary.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I think Tim Tebow should take whatever bonus money he gets and the money from whatever contract he gets and invest it wisely. Somehow I don&apos;t see him having a long and fruitful NFL career.

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@Franc (Kennesaw GA) i dont mind skip,i just hate when they talk about things they clearly have not watched,or care about...i said it yesterday ryan stewart looks like a poor mans Shaq!!

D.I. (East Lansing)



Rob has always been wrong about Tom Izzo. Especially last year- his job was never in jeopardy, unlike Robs.

james (wyoming)



Skip versus Shannon Sharpe and Charles Barkley would be worth pay-per-view

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Did Charles Barkley ever answer Skips challenge for 1st and 10???

megan (ohio)



ah, kevin, ray lewis would be an excellent debate!

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@kevin (euclid, OH) Ray Lewis isnt the best person to put in front of a camera,he doesnt give good interviews

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



My fave is when Skip and Steven A. Smith debate!

Nathan (Daytona Beach)



Tebow isnt better than Tommy Fraizer

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Roller: I do it just for you.

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



That was Meachem and the balll was secured against his leg, watch it closely. It made up for the ridiculous call in the end zone with berrian that gave them 7 points

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Tebow great in college but will be another JaMarcus Russell in the NFL at QB... his size a great TE though, blocking TE.

Brian (SoCal)



Tebow just throws an ugly ball. I do wish him best of luck though.

Mike (C-Town)



How come everybody dismisses Tebow as an NFL quaterback since he played in the shotgun. Last time I checked McCoy and Bradford played in the shotgun 95% of the time as well.

Jim (Y-town)



Shannon Sharpe

megan (ohio)



yeah, jeff, but if ray focused on skip and the arguement, its not really an interview

Matt (Laramie, WY)



I want Obama to debate Skip!!!

james (wyoming)



Skip versus Scoop my all-time favorite

Mickey (Memphis )



I really think skip scare to debate Barkley.

kevin (euclid, OH)



Obama!! Nice

mod   (10:35 AM) 



I don&apos;t know about you but every time people put LOL at the end of their post, I never am laughing out loud
 
Brian (SoCal)



1st take road trip to the white house? excellent. Skip probably can&apos;t get in since he is on a hate list.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I just want to head to Eagle&apos;s Deli in Boston for that bacon cheeseburger and fries challenge. I know I could never complete it but the burger and fries look great.

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Urban Meyer never did prepare Tebow for the NFL but that&apos;s not his job...it&apos;s to win at Florida with the talent he&apos;s got...He won&apos;t be a good QB in the NFL...but that&apos;s the way it goes

Mike (Morgantown)



Jury is still out on Tebow. After a sub par first day of practice he actually looked pretty good yesterday and threw some good balls. Lets wait and see what happens over the next few months before we judge him

Jeremy (Dallas)



Mike. Its b/c he can not play the postion in the NFL!!!

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I bet some time in the near future we&apos;re Florida is going to have a Governor Tebow

Roller (Kentucky)



Come on, don&apos;t compare Tebow to Jamarcus R....no one will ever be as big a bust as this guy.

Brett (Boise)



Skip needs to debate Barry Melrose. I don&apos;t think Skip has ever seen a hockey game. He would just sit there in silence.

trai ((big blue nation))



this year could have all #1&apos;s in the final four

Brian (SoCal)



That lol thing sounds kind of like laughing at your own joke.

mod   (10:37 AM) 



kinda like whistling in the dark...sort of a nervous thing...doesn&apos;t do anything for anyone else but the dude who wrote it
 
kevin (euclid, OH)



then put LOI... laughing on the inside, LOL

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@megan (ohio) i understand but i dont think he is the type to sit and take getting bashed by skip...who knows it may b awesome..lol

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Skip vs Rampage Jackson!!!!!!that would be a classic

Roller (Kentucky)



mod: lol

John (Delaware)



its true, i&apos;ll give myself an F

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



good point, lol

Don (Detroit)



@mod, LOL

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Vince McMahon Vs. Skip in a debate... now there is a war of words!!!

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Jamarcus Russell could give Adam Richman a run for his money in food challenges though, Roller.

mod   (10:38 AM) 



Geez, Jon Ritchie looks nauseaus already
 
Brian (SoCal)



Barry is the funniest analyst and he knows his stuff.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



agree Roller. Russell wasnt even that good @ LSU! He had that ONE good game in the National Chompionship against a sorry defense

trai ((big blue nation))



meyer was selfish it is his job to prepare kids for the next level

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



I like Jay Wright..he is very polished and a real good coach

james (wyoming)



Tebow has too much work ethic to be shrugged off before he even has a team to play for, let alone take a snap

Matt (Laramie, WY)



My dream food job - Diners, Drive Ins and Dives... my kind of food!!!

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



Tebow is a FULLBACK if he wants an nfl career

john (panama city bch, fl)



Sry Mod, i&apos;ll ltm- (laugh to myself)

Roller (Kentucky)



That is true J.B., he could probably out eat anyone in the NFL.

Brian (SoCal)



If you want to give skip a beatdown, go for Lesnar.

john (panama city bch, fl)



No Matt- if it&apos;s Skip vs. McMahon- it&apos;s a cage match!

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@mod Well maybe u need to b a little happier...its ok mod things will get better...LOLOLOL

mod   (10:39 AM) 



bunch a comedians
 
Nathan (Daytona beach)



isnt Urban Meyer the same coach Alex Smith had in college look how that turn out

kevin (euclid, OH)



Courtney Brown #1 overall in 2000 by Cleveland was a pretty big bust. I know he&apos;s not a QB but...

Matt (Laramie, WY)



@ Brett (Boise) According to Skip he watches every game everyday he must have a lot of TV&apos;s and one Hell of a monthly cable bill. He is always say while watching that game last night...

D.I. (East Lansing)



Brett from Boise you&apos;re wrong. Skip has seen two seconds of a game, but he doesnt understand hockey. He said it one day on the air. He cant keep track of the puck. But it would be a good debate if Barry showed Skip the toughest sport (tougher than basketball for sure)

Mike (C-Town)



Jeremy - we will never know until he gets a chance. Just don&apos;t dismiss him because you don&apos;t like him. Atleast give Tebow a couple years to prove he can either play or not play.

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



ok, Im tired of you guys telling the TRUTH about Jamarcus Russell

Jeff (Pittsburgh,PA)



@mod prob shouldnt have said anything now everyone is gonna put lol at the end...LOL

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I&apos;d like Adam&apos;s job as Man v Food. Still can&apos;t figure out how he doesn&apos;t weigh 700 pounds.

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Please tell Jay(the most interesting man in the world) that he needs to get some Dos Equis for those guys

james (wyoming)



Russell is lazy and he&apos;s a whiner, not a winner

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



matt, agreed

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



J russell such a bust that it&apos;s unreal that the raiders will even work with further trying to develop him

Roller (Kentucky)



Caddy: agree about Jay Wright

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Jamarcus Russell&apos;s best audible: &quot;You know, put some bacon on that double cheeseburger while you&apos;re at it.&quot;

james (wyoming)



I doubt Skip has a cable bill to worry about

stacy (georgetown)



my favorite foods are chicken tenders, pizza, hambugers

john (panama city bch, fl)



After it&apos;s all over- Ritchie will have enuf room for SIX bags of chips.

Brian (SoCal)



Love triple D. only thing is they do overlap a bit.

Umor (Detroit)



Morning crew, Late to the chat, Was rockin to some Robert Gordon. Link Ray a guitar master.

Brian (SoCal)



If Tebow wants to be a NFL QB, he will need a team that is willing to coach him up for a few years.

john (panama city bch, fl)



Mod,If you prefer that- i can comply....yuck,yuck

mod   (10:42 AM) 



I think the room should call someone out if they say LOL and its really not funny...call me a comedy snob...

Umor (Detroit)



Skip not eating anything on the list. Maybe skinless bake wings. Yuck.

Matt (Laramie, WY)



USFL is supposed to be coming back, Tebow might make it as a QB there.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Skip&apos;s never hungry because he&apos;s always full from eating crow.

Ronnie (Vegas)



Mcnab to the vikings!? is it possible?

Roller (Kentucky)



Man, that is a good looking spread...I&apos;m hungry

Hayden (Logan, Ut)

Selena (Louisiana)



Morning Everybody. Just made my way here. What I missed? A lot! UK got spanked yesterday. Pretty sure it was mentioned already.

ty (new jersey)



Pro bowl before the superbowl is just wrong

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Where&apos;s Rex Ryan?

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



Everyone thought Steve Young should have been a Safety or Tight End in the NFL, but he stuck with a QB and now he is a hall of famer. Just sayin.

Brian (SoCal)



That must be the kiddie plate. normally Adam has twice that plate.

john (panama city bch, fl)



Dam, harsh, mod! I quit- i SWEAR

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



OK, you&apos;re a comedy snob.

Jim (Y-town)



Ask Amy Nelson if Jim Thome is a Hall of Famer

Hayden (Logan, Ut)

Brett (Boise)



J.B. I&apos;m sure you can figure it out. You just don&apos;t want to know because it&apos;s something you will never be able to &quot;un&quot; know.

matt (wilson)



Do you think brett favre is thinking about retiring

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



I thought Sliders were White Castle Cheeseburgers...suitable at 2:00am after a few drinks and tasty but you pay for it in the morning

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Get the Malox ready

Manny R. (LA)



Tebow goes 6th round like Brady he&apos;s doing that bad guys.

Mike (Morgantown)



Trai, somebody will take a chance on Tebow with a late first round or early to mid second round, he won&apos;t slip to the third

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



Steve Young had mechanics, tebow doesnt

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



name one running back jon ritchie help get a 1000 yards as a full back so what can he say lol that is what he is good for that eating lol

kevin (euclid, OH)



No wonder Skip is so cranky... get that man a chicken wing

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



JB and Skip eating crow...nice!

Nathan (Daytona beach)



@joel steve young was under center and was a pass first offense..His height was the factor during that time

Matt (Spokane, WA)



I think Brett Favre is thinking about himself and how great he is...

Manny R. (LA)



Rob you should take Skip you owe him about 30 meals you bum!

Ronnie (Vegas)

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Does blue cheese or ranch go better with crow?

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Never got the attraction to White Castle. If I&apos;m going to eat a burger I want it to be substantial and onion free.

Roller (Kentucky)



That is what is wrong with Skip, he can&apos;t just live a little and eat some bad food occasionally.

Mike (Morgantown)



Thousands of men have played Major League Baseball, only 25 have hit 500 homeruns, 25! By the time he retires he will be in the top ten all time home run hitters! How is he not a hall of famer?

Brian (SoCal)



No wonder Skip has so much hate. PowerBars are cardboard. Eat some good tasty food.

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



you&apos;re right Caddy Mike. Somehow sliders have come to the main stream. For what reason I don&apos;t know

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Skip&apos;s diet consist of a slab of rob parker and a bowl of 2-live stews

Thank GOD we have baseball now, gettin tired of bERT and Tiger,sigh- (that was sarcasm)

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



the saints got lucky in OT with some of those calls. without those calls they don&apos;t get near FG range

Umor (Detroit)



Payton got two weeks to study the Saints Defense. Unless they got something hidden, We can get a Superbowl shootout.

Roller: Skip is not real. He&apos;s just another Disney audioanamatronic figure.

Umor (Detroit)



Tebow can play in the NFL. get behind a good starting QB. Learn and be another Steve Walsh.

This guy is Jon Ritchie&apos;s hero.

Jeff (City Of Champions,PA)



@mod I agree

Umor (Detroit)



Yeag Steve young. My Bad I said walsh. But Tebow Can learn behind a QB. Maybe goto philly and learn their. Andy Reid will get himready to start in 4 years.

Brian (SoCal)



Rob is picking the mets again? At least he is consistent.

Who&apos;s Steve Walsh- don&apos;t you mean BILL Walsh?

Tebow can get the best job in the NFL... backup QB. collect the check, hold the clipboard. Prepare your political speeches.

ReischeaFutureHusbnad (Washington, DC)



Favre Did my Packers wrong, the Jets wrong, and he&apos;s going to do the Vikings wrong. I love the man but he has stop handicapping these teams in the Off-season

Roller (Kentucky)



love the Braves

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Didnt Thome get most of his HR with Manny in that same line up?

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the Twins invited Favre to throw out the first pitch on opening day this season. You know it won&apos;t be AP because he&apos;d drop the ball on the way to the mound.

Mike (C-Town)



Michael in PA - dude chill out man.

Brett (Boise)



No Edgar, then no Thome

Selena (Louisiana)



I think I&apos;m all Favre&apos;d out. If he still feels like he got it, than play and quit this I may retire. Its getting old. Talk is cheap, put it to action.

Jeff (City Of Champions,PA)



@kevin (euclid, OH) r u sure it was legit?...someone else said he did steroids...but does that even matter anymore????

Joel (Stanwood, WA)



I would let Brett Favre handicap my team during the offseason if it meant he would get us into the NFC Championship game!

Umor (Detroit)



How can Thome not be a HOFamer. And Mod ,Martinez Should be in the HOF. Stupid voters , Some of them are headcases too.

I&apos;ll say this about Thome though...nicest guy you&apos;d ever want to chat with
 
Mike (C-Town)



I think its funny how everyone thinks Thome was legit. Can we really believe that anymore. I mean look at the guy? He is 100 pounds bigger then he was when he came up.

Matt (Laramie, WY)



As I said yesterday, Favre will try to turn around the Rams next year. His new mission is to play for every team in the NFL. He will go play each season for the one team that he has not played for that has the highest draft pick.

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Ouch JB on AP dropping the baseball! Funny though

David Ortiz (Boston)



No DH should get in... Are you kidding me? What am I playing for then mister Roller?

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



The Farve thing is almost as bad as ESPN carrying on cowboys talk

Have to have a sense of humor about it, Caddy. If I didn&apos;t, I&apos;d have ulcers.

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Agree Mike(C-town)...Nobody knows who used roids or not

george (from the jungle)



oh wow he&apos;s bigger than he was when he got drafted. i think everybody is, i would be if i a MILLIONARE. i would be on the best regimen with the best supplements. no shit they are always going to be bigger guys than they were when they started.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Ben (NC): If you honestly believe that, you need to watch more football.

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



@ ben, those 3 regular season wins almost had them as #1 seed, but i see your point

Umor (Detroit)



I can&apos;t believe Oakland is spending money on any free agents. What happen to money ball?

john (panama city bch, fl)



D. Harvey....we GET it- you&apos;re not impressed w/Ritchie- move on!

george (from the jungle)



what does Thome have to do this year to get in? alll you people that think you know what your talking about?

mod   (10:59 AM) 



how &apos;bout he needs to put on a glove and contribute on defense...I&apos;m sick of DH&apos;s, man...and why can&apos;t pitchers take batting practice and hit for a respectable average??
 
New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



@ Ben, I figured Favre would lose the game for the Vikes, as he did, trying to keep up with Brees instead of gashing our defense with AP, which they didn&apos;t

Roller (Kentucky)



The thing is Thome doesn&apos;t look bigger as in muscular...looks like he might like pizza and wings as much as we do.

Jeff (City Of Champions,PA)



@mod in my opinion that means alot,should mean something for HOF voting too,but dont think voters look at how good of a person u were on and off the field

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I first saw Thome play in person when he was in AAA and came to Scranton. It took me about 10 seconds to realize I was seeing a guy who would have a long and prosperous MLB career.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



do people even care anymore about who used roids? at this point i&apos;m more surprised when a player is CLEAN

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



well george, how about winning a ring, playing better d, getting is batting average up....

Larry (Houston )



I bet thomes numbers are CLEAN so he should get in the hall of fame...

Brett (Boise)



Umor, I still trust Billy Beane until he proves himself wrong. I was pretty surprised about Sheets yesterday however.

James (Denver)



Tim Tebow wont be as big of a bust as Russel because nobody is going to take Tebow first overall! NFL scouts dont even rank him in the top 5 QBs in the draft and after watching him this week his stock has fallen even lower. Tebow will be lucky to get drafted at all. He shouldnt but one of the Florida teams will draft him to create a buzz. Hes not going to be on a NFL roster in 3 seasons! Hes going to be making anti abortion Super Bowl ads something he is good at because hes not a good QB.

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



Thome is a beast,,,,give that man some respect!!!!

Brian (SoCal)



I a DH can&apos;t get in what about AL pitchers that never hit? They only play one pat of the game, and only every 5th day at that.

ReischeaFutureHusbnad (Washington, DC)



Im a packers fan, however, I live with a lot of depressing Redskins fan. So on behalf of the deadskins, who should they draft with the 5 pick?

Roller (Kentucky)



If someone eats that burger their stomach will explode.

Jeff (City Of Champions,PA)



@EVERYONE wow thats a good looking burger!!

Barbara (sacramento)



I saw skips brother on an episode of iron chef america where the money went to charity and if not mistaken he won. they kinda look alike. look at that burger. bet skip just had a heart attack.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I WANT THAT BURGER!!!!!!!!

Umor (Detroit)



Hey, Enjoyed seeing porchello getting hits in interleague play last year. Should let the pitchers that can hit, hit instead of the DH in the A.L.

Larry (Houston )



good point brian (so cal)

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



If your fav athelete decides to put his health on the line for money, thats on them

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Mod: I&apos;m with you. I hate the DH. Strategy is better in the NL game because the pitcher has to bat. Also pitchers think twice about knocking a guy down when they know they have to step into the batter&apos;s box.

Mike (C-Town)



Larry - Just like Big Pappi was clean to right?

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



then why is he talking about football everyday

stacy (georgetown)



roller- what part of the state do you live in it is going to snow this weekend and if you go out this weekend.....be careful!!!!!

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



Sports is all about Dollars, its entertainment. It&apos;s not &quot;official&quot; who cares if they are roiding

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Skip Vs. &quot;The Rock&quot; best out of three falls. 1st fall a debate, 2nd fall cage match, 3rd fall lest go old school scaffold match.

george (from the jungle)



because pitches, their whole life, have concentrated one THROWING the ball, and that is their job in baseball, they should not have to pick up a bat and bat a respectable average, that means they are mastering two of the abilities, and not too many ppl do that. offensive players play offense because tahts how they trained their whole life, defensive players play defense because tahts what they have done their whole life. pitchers pitch. hitters hit. no reason to try and make him master another trade.

mod   (11:03 AM) 



because now even in little league they have a DH, so eliminate the DH year by year from the bottom up and in ten years lose the DH in the American League
 
Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Agree with Rob, the fact that we&apos;re even debating Thome being in the HOF means he doesnt belong!

Brian (SoCal)



Those crazy tall burgers are impossible to eat without a knife and fork.(or a bath towel)

&quot;The Icon&quot; (Unknown)



Colts!!!!!!end of discussion

john (panama city bch, fl)



Pizza&apos;s in the oven- THANK you VERY MUCH First Take...empty calories for breakfast!

james (wyoming)



Redskins need a RB - portis is getting up there in age and he&apos;s been gettin&apos; hurt

Mike (C-Town)



good looking burger and good looking girl surving the burger. Mod she could be right up your ally.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



is john ritchie going to do yoga after this?

Jeff (City Of Champions,PA)



the girl from sliders is pretty hott.

Larry (Houston )



Time 2 fire up the pit...

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



James (Denver): I&apos;d be willing to bet money that Tebow gets drafted but yeah, I don&apos;t see him having an illustrious NFL career.

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



Hmmmmmm,can&apos;t figure which way shanahan will go

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



How i would love to be there to eat with adam....

Selena (Louisiana)



What-a-burger!

kevin (euclid, OH)



As long as the DH is part of the game you cant fault guys for it

&quot;The Icon&quot; (Unknown)



now thats a &quot; burger&quot;

Jonathan (ATL)



Richie needs to learn how to eat wings. There&apos;s a lot of good meat left on dem bones.

Roller (Kentucky)



I agree also Mod and J.B., DH is not good for the game...let everyone hit even the pitchers.

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



roids been around since the 70&apos;s....i know..alot of my teamates were on them .....shame on mlb for saying they knew nothing!!!!

james (wyoming)



every position in baseball focuses on throwing the ball. geez. it&apos;s BASEBALL

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



tebow will be a frost out of neb big 12

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



George: But coming through from the time they were kids, weren&apos;t the really good pitchers often among the team&apos;s better hitters?

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



That settles it...Going to a nice burger joint for lunch today...ice cold brew...and good company

Umor (Detroit)



Awesome Burger God Burger. I would kill that sucker off. no pickles for me though.

george (from the jungle)



no, having the pitcher bat sucks. because half the time they dont bat they have to slow the game down and change batters and pitchers and positoins a bunch of times. dumb. keep the DH. THOME IS A HOFer

Barbara (sacramento)



maybe john will share with us. that looks good. who care if its healthy its not an everyday thing

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



adam rishman is a god, please give him my Kudos, thanks

Roller (Kentucky)



The only thing Jon Ritchie is going to doing after this is....well you know..

george (from the jungle)



a scrambler with a strong arml.

Don (Detroit)



keep the DH. Nothing worse than seeing a pitcher in trouble get an &quot;automatic&quot; out. He should have to earn his way through a complete lineup.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



It&apos;s in college and sometimes HS when they stop pitchers from hitting. But until then it&apos;s normally pitchers that are the best hitters

Larry (Houston )



lol selena....we have &apos;what a burger&apos; chains in texas

george (from the jungle)



shanahan wants clausen, he can mold him to be like elway.

joey (tx)



Hook me up with that girl!

James (Denver)



Why would you want to trade for Amare Stoudamire? So he can quit on you like he did the Suns last season? He didnt get traded before last seasons trading deadline so he quit on the team. Dont give me his eye excuse either it was bullsh*t! I am a Sheet Metal worker and have got metal in my eyes before. I am 70% blind in my right eye but guess what I had to go back to work the same day!

Roller (Kentucky)



Stacy: thank you and I&apos;m on the West side.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Adam&apos;s chat at 1:00 PM should be really busy although I find it a bit ironic that it is being held during the height of lunch time.

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



mlb needs to get rid of the allstar team wins home field rule

JP (Baton Rouge)



Why is &quot;The ICON&quot; so confident? Obviously the Saints have trouble against the run which is good becasue the Colts are last in the league in running the ball! Regardless it will not be a blow out like everyone thinks!

george (from the jungle)



pitching 50mph when you&apos;re a kid at a huge strike zone is a little different.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Five Guys Burgers and Fries. For those who have one in their area, take advantage of it. Trust me.

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Montario Hardesty is the best running back in this years draft!!!!who ever drafts this guy will get a stud!!!!!

Barbara (sacramento)



Lets solve the problem and get rid of the title DH. anybody that plays baseball and does well deserves to try and get to the hall. As long as they are clean

Don (Detroit)



Shanhan has never drafted or been interested in QBs with below average arm strength. No way he goes with or wants Clausen.

Bryan (Stafford, VA)



fIVE gUYS Started in VA

Matt (Laramie, WY)



My Skins post did it get lost? Been a few minutes and it still is not up?

mod   (11:07 AM) 



somebody explain how posts work in here
 
ReischeaFutureHusband (Washington, DC)



skip vs bam bam bigelow in a ladder match

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Can you imagine how many &apos;half players&apos; could be out of work without a DH?

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



he did not play qb in the nfl

Larry (Houston )



permanti brothers in pittsburgh....WOW that brings back memories

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



J.B!!! RIGHT ON!!! They have 5 guys here and it&apos;s the BEST BURGER!!! love their fries too!!!

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



That burger is on steroids...How can it be a hall-of -famer too...HAHA

trai ((big blue nation))



wow we crucified rex ryan when he forseen the future for the jets;now to cancel school,go saints

Selena (Louisiana)



Larry (Houston) - Thats why I said it. We have Whataburger here too!!

john (panama city bch, fl)



Doesn&apos;t matter where you attack it from- it&apos;s whether you can FINISH it!

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Matt: If the post is good, mod will put it up. If you don&apos;t see it, you need to pick up your chat game.

Wes (Big Orange Country)



J.B.(DUNMORE,PA)....5Guys burgers and fries is the shizz nitt!!!!

john (panama city bch, fl)



Simple- ya bribes th Mod, ya types th funny, ya sees ur name!!!

Mike (C-Town)



In and Out Burger is pretty solid.

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



saw a show about permenti bros, need me some o&apos; that!!

james (wyoming)



who cares how posts work? some get on, others don&apos;t. be polite, be interesting, and be patient and there&apos;s no problem.

joey (tx)



that was a fake laugh!

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Wow.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I usually give up fast food for Lent. On Fat Tuesday I will hit Five Guys for a loaded cheeseburger and a regular order of fries as a large would be complete overkill.

megan (ohio)



sad! im in n.e. ohio n i want a 5 guys burger!!

Larry (Houston )



where is &apos;5 guys burgers&apos; located?

Barbara (sacramento)



JB we don&apos;t have one here I don&apos;t think but I love burgers. when i make them at home they are huge. I just don&apos;t eat the bread. i don&apos;t like the mcdonald burgers or burger king. i watch food network and they show some really great burgers. have tried a bunch. i like bacon and cheese

Bryan (Cleveland,OH)



Hey Jay. I am a fellow Browns fan. I know when you saw Braylon &quot;NO Hands&quot; Edwards make that catch on Sunday you cringed. This is though, I know he wanted to drop it.. he almost did. He had to coast it in instead of going to get it.

stacy (georgetown)



and i also like wendy&apos;s, pizza hut....

Roller (Kentucky)



Do not be bothering Mod if something doesn&apos;t get posted, you gotta play better.

Mike (Ohio)



Maybe it&apos;s because it was about the Skins?

Jeff (City Of Champions,PA)



@Larry (Houston )Permanti&apos;s is like 10 minutes from my house,best food ever...good call dude!!

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



In and Out is my spot when i am really out of it in Vegas

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I dont consider 5 guys fast food

kevin (euclid, OH)



me too megan (ohio)

joey (tx)



Whataburger is the best we have

george (from the jungle)



so i dont think anybody needs to pick up their chat game, because that guy just said &quot;wow.&quot; thats not really worth posting. hahah niether is anything skip says though.

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Yes next season I will be with First Take can&apos;t wait apart of the crew finally

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Lets try again. The Skins need to draft a RB not a QB. They need to get Ryan Matthews out of Fresno State then they need to pull Colt Brennan off of the practice squad and let him sling the ball around. Brennan has an arm and Portis is hurt to much and may be out anyway.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I think Five Guys is more of an east coast chain. They have them down in MD and up through PA that I know of.

Larry (Houston )



i wanna know where this 5 guys burger joint is

stacy (georgetown)



roller what is your favorite foods?

New_Orleans_4_ever (Washington DC)



5 guys, northeast, Va, Pa, DC

Selena (Louisiana)



Larry probably a northern food chain

james (wyoming)



skip doesn&apos;t post, he&apos;s live

Brian (SoCal)



In and Out is only really good if you eat right there.

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



pizza hut buffet, high noon, I challenge adam richman to an eat off. BOY YA!!

Larry (Houston )

Matt (Laramie, WY)



@ Mod - Do you really read every post before it goes up?

mod   (11:11 AM) 



heck no
 
john (panama city bch, fl)



How&apos;d you manage that Adam G.? you can&apos;t even get an outing w/ Jay?

Brett (Boise)



J.B. We have 2 Five Guys out here as well.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



There are like 3 5 guys burgers here where i live outside of Atlanta

Hayden (Logan, Ut)

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Adam G.: You are getting a job with ESPN for real?

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Larry (Houston) we have a few in the Chattanooga area!!!! come get ya some my man!!!

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



I was joking they don&apos;t want me

Umor (Detroit)



That how you attack that burger. If it wasn&apos;t for the talkin. They&apos;ll be half way through with it by now.

Matt (Spokane, WA)



Today is National Kazoo Day-- just thought you should know

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Jacksonville, FL has 5 guys here...sounds good to me

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



We need a piece pipe to go with all this food

joey (tx)



is that how you say &quot;koom buy ya&quot;?

george (from the jungle)



its hard to talk about anythign because some posts take 20 seconds to come up, they should just post everything, and kick people out that say something bad or say too much.

Mike (C-Town)



Pizza hut buffett stinks, all the good pizza is alwys picked over and the only thing sitting there is the supreme with everything imaginable on it. Then when they bring out the desert pizza its a race to the buffett because its gone in two seconds.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Five Guys branching out west. Good for you guys!

John Madden (via mobile)



You know, it&apos;s real simple. You send in the post, mod sees it and it gets posted. Mod has to see your post to post your post, because that&apos;s how Mod posts posts. BOOM!

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



i&apos;d like that burger wit a side of rieschea

36crazyfists (ALASKA)



pizza hut buffet rules, the dessert pizza is better than jesus

joey (tx)



mr. gatti&apos;s is a cheap pizza buffet

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I prefer the local pizza joint to the chains. I think the pizza is better.

mod   (11:14 AM) 



you guys think Rob says Tebow is a 1st round draft pick?
 
ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



nothing like pizza made from true itailians

megan (ohio)



nice, mr. madden, nice

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Hey mod, we know Jay likes Ohio teams and and Dana is a fan of team from Michigan, what team do you root for in the big 4 sports?

mod   (11:14 AM) 



no rooting in the press box
 
ReischeaFutureHusband (Washington, DC)



Five Guys is the best Burgers joint ever

Dave (LV)



The pizza hut buffet stinks because...it&apos;s pizza hut.

&quot;The Icon&quot; (Unknown)



then ud be kickd out georg of jungle!!!

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



If Tebow goes in the first round, Al Davis is the one picking him.

Brian (SoCal)



Chain pizza is good. Local pizza is either Great or bad. If you find a great one you have a treasure.

Hook (Southern Maryland)



Adam Richman is on? I love Man V. Food.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I hate eating pizza from pizza chains! They&apos;re the fast food for pizza! NY pizza is the only way to go! REAL NY PIZZA!!!

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



im sure you do JB, you are the best at everything

john (panama city bch, fl)



like you said, J.B.- Brick Oven!!!

Richard (West Virginia)



The best pizza ive every had came from a tiny pizza joint in Brooklyn New york called fat sams the slices were bigger than my head

mod   (11:15 AM) 



small head?
 
Umor (Detroit)



Deep dish pizza with sausage and hot peppers. And five types of chesse. the best.

JP (Baton Rouge)



Maybe the Owner of Papa John&apos;s should give Tebow lessons how to throw the football! Anybody saw the commercial where it looked like he launched it 80 yards?

Selena (Louisiana)



Agree J.B. I love Johnny&apos;s Pizza over the others down here.

Barbara (sacramento)



here we go again bret again. can we not go one day without talking about him. I am sick of him and what he wants. i wish he would just go away and stay there

Larry (Houston )



the have a place here in houston called Sicily Pizza....they have a 15 lb pizza they sell for the super bowl...now THATS a BEAST of ao pizza i promise you

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Brett Favre&apos;s year was a 9.5

joey (tx)



Why did Dominos change there pizza? I liked that thin card board lookin pizza. It was good.

Richard (West Virginia)



big slices mad

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



^5@ ny pizza

Matt (Laramie, WY)



I have reported sports for years but to this day I am a fan first and yes we did root in the press box.

Donovan McNabb (PHILLY)



Rob the Slob looks like he&apos;s in a mob but really he&apos;s just a snob who thinks he&apos;s Bob...Barker.

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Allen (Port Washington,NY) screw the burger give me the side of Rieschea!!!!

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



tebow is a wildcat qb face it

Roller (Kentucky)



Mod: Rob probably hates on Tebow just like he hates on Favre.

Hook (Southern Maryland)



Fuddrucker&apos;s is awesome!!!

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Nobody cares what Childress thinks...I&apos;m more interested in what fans like JB think about Favre

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



tebow= first rounder, too much like steve young

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Best pizza every at Anthony&apos;s in Richmond, VA grew up on the stuff.

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Best chain pizza... Papa Johns.

Trevor (Clinton Township, MI)



You guys are hitting right up my alley...Man v. Food and Rob Parker...to quote Adam Richman &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot; (Not really my bday lol)

Umor (Detroit)



Tebow Late 1st rd pick. 31st pick. You need a HB and you use him on specail plays and he&apos;s learning the offense.

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



let the truth be told brett was a 10

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



At least he got to the NFC Championship at 40 Rob.

Hook (Southern Maryland)



The burgers at Fuddrucker&apos;s are rad. I can crush their 1 pounder easily.

megan (ohio)



robs right, he got skip right there

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



See now Brooklyn pizza intrigues me. If you want good Italian food I would think Brooklyn is the place to find it.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



There&apos;s a Johnny&apos;s here and they claim they&apos;re NY style... THEY SUCK!!!

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



blondies pizza on CAL&apos;s campus, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



get him rob!!!!

Larry (Houston )



Double Daves pizza...2 guys from the bronx...BEST PIZZA EVER

Brett (Boise)



Jags will be the only team that would even think about Tebow in the 1st round. And that will only be to sell season tickets.

SteveFitz (Cicero, IL)



NY pizza is terrible. I&apos;ll take Chicago pizza in squares. Not deep dish.

kevin (euclid, OH)



Great point Rob! Skip saying Lebron is overrated is the craziest thing ive ever heard

36crazyfists (ALASKA)



i said that because someone mentioned al davis picking tim tebow

Brian (SoCal)



Skip just loves him some Bret. If he didn&apos;t put up good stats but won he would be praising his leadership.

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



dominos didnt change that much, marketing ploy

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



i hear ya wes lol

Barbara (sacramento)



That is a good commercial jp. watch diners, driveins and dives on food network and they go to a lot of small restaurents that look like they have good food. they are small towns no one knows about. guy fieri has 2 places here in sac and he has good stuff and its not expensive.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Pizza from the Wildwood Boardwalk is usually really good. Found a place that makes a cheese fry pizza. Heart attack on thin crust but oh so good.

john (panama city bch, fl)



Barbara- mebbe he&apos;ll wind up on an episode of NCIS, lol

Roller (Kentucky)



Rob: that is just stupid!

joey (tx)



say any arguement and add in you like Lebron and Jay is on your side

Richard (West Virginia)



i think tebow can fix his delivery lika Aaron rodgers did but if is still inaccurate after that he better find a new position

Selena (Louisiana)



Matt- Anthony&apos;s too greasy for me. I need to try Fuddrucker&apos;s Hook. Its new here.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Chicago Pizza is AWEFUL!!!

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Wonder what Skip&apos;s &quot;Mystery Coach Source&quot; thinks about Tebow

Umor (Detroit)



I wanna go to Texas and try the chicken fried bacon.

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



your dead wrong steve....you wouldn&apos;t have pizza if it wasn&apos;t for ny....don&apos;t dis the creator

Matt (Laramie, WY)



There is not a good pizza place in Laramie, the one that claims to be good I personally think is horrible.

Barbara (sacramento)



tebow is another favre on the rise. watch and see. he is already talking smack and he hasn&apos;t even been drafted

Don (Detroit)



Pizzapopulis in Greektown (Detroit) is awesome.

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



50% take them under the snap.

Trevor (Clinton Township, MI)



I just had an Italian Chicken Pizza at Carrabba&apos;s on Saturday and it was utterly delicious....I also recommend Jet&apos;s Barbecue chicken pizza.

Richard (West Virginia)



SteveFitz (Cicero, IL) you can have that deep dish casserole you call pizza but new york pizza is the best pizza hands down

joey (tx)



It is good Umor, add gravy and its set!

ReischeaFutureHusband (Washington, DC)



Forget all dat, give me four wings and fries with mumbo sauce on everything

Wes (Big Orange Country)



The best Pizza is the next one i make!!!!!

Larry (Houston )



Its worth the trip umor...

Matt (Laramie, WY)



@ Selena - The Anthony&apos;s I am talking about is a mom and pop pizza joint not the chain.

james (wyoming)



Lebron is still unfinished - he&apos;s still, in some ways, a kid. He&apos;s unbelievable in every way except the intangibles.

Roller (Kentucky)



I&apos;m sure Tebow is the only qb to fumble a snap.

36crazyfists (ALASKA)



peyton and brees barely take any under center.

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



Allen, watch yourself, getting sorta lame

Mike (C-Town)



I have had Pizza Populis and it was really good. It was right by a casino in Detroit.

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Are you kidding me...

john (panama city bch, fl)



Skip just said ...&quot;Laugh Out Loud&quot;- git him, Mod!

Brian (SoCal)



Watch the games skip. NFL QBs take over half their snap under center.

james (wyoming)



Matt in Laramie - you are so very very right

Barbara (sacramento)



i said it before jay did. i don&apos;t get these spoiled rotten kids that think the world owes them everything. you earn what you get

joey (tx)



Oh and that could be wrapped around a corn dog too!!

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



thank you if tebow was black he would play rb no q ask

Umor (Detroit)



Wes ,Larry, How is it with some green chilli.

Brian (SoCal)



Tebow needs years to be ready, and then you probably trained him for someone else.

Trevor (Clinton Township, MI)



I don&apos;t get the NY/CHI pizza hate....if you love pizza, I don&apos;t understand why you wouldn&apos;t love both...I certainly do....its not like they pop a frozen Red Baron into the oven.

James (Denver)



JB I said some team will waste a draft pick on him just to create buzz! My point was he is undeserving of getting drafted. But some GM will draft him! Then they will get fired in a year! Steve Young was a high draft pick he just chose to play in the USFL. Steve Young didnt have to sit and learn behind Montana he chose the USFL over the NFL! He was alresdy NFL ready at best Tebow is a project who doesnt even have potential to be good. Hes just a good leader.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Caddy: If you really care, I was thrilled to have Favre. He made watching the Vikings fun again for me. Had the NFL Ticket this year for the first time so I saw every game. The man plays the game hard every time and makes it fun for the fans. I&apos;d be happy to have him back next season, even if it was just to help develop the other Viking QBs.

36crazyfists (ALASKA)



how does al davis still have a team, i mean seriously, dont people say stuff to him? doesnt he hear about it all the time? that hes almost senile? or maybe he already is? making ridiculous picks every year? dishing money out to people that do not deserve it? having press confereneces with a overhead projector on his face? sounds like he cant even read anymore? probably tells them how he wants to play and everything? seriously, cant somebody just get rid of him? wow, its like ruining the NFL, i dont like the raiders but i think the league would be better if they were decent.

megan (ohio)



id like skips brother to cook for me!

Larry (Houston )



ive never tried it with green chili umor...you may have somethn there

Matt (Laramie, WY)



James in Wyoming, you know the place I am talking about being bad, downtown on the corner of 3rd and Grand.

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



defense won the games skip look it up

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



tebow gonna be a good pro football player

Manny R. (LA)



I think Kevin Kolb is a beast anyone else here think he could lead the Eagles?

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



This segment brought to you by beano

Roller (Kentucky)



Jon R. looks friggin serious man.

Richard (West Virginia)



i think NFl Qbs take more than 50% of their snaps undercenter unless its a two minute drill or an obvious passing down your gonna take the snap undercenter

mod   (11:22 AM) 



you think wrong Richard
 
sam (nyc)



Who is the waitress in the Man vs. Food segment? She is even better looking than Skip!

Selena (Louisiana)



Matt -- Oh well I know one place on Base called Anthony&apos;s that sells pizza and wings. Its wasn&apos;t like a National chain and its not located off Base.

SteveFitz (Cicero, IL)



That&apos;s the problem with people outside Chicago. They think deep dish is all Chicago has. I never eat deep dish and I grew up in the city. Deep dish pizza is for tourists. I&apos;ll take Chicago pizza in squares over that skimpy NY garbage in triangles any day.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Crispy wings with sauce that is hot but not mouth burning. Good eating.

john (panama city bch, fl)



MISTER BAYLESS???? Child,Please- quit suckin-up!!

joey (tx)



No that just proves that people dont want runnng qbs, and it has nothing to do with color like people say.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



It&apos;s easy Trevor! NY style pizza is the best and Chicago pizza just SUX!

kevin (euclid, OH)



If Mcnabb is available the Browns better be knocking on Phillys door

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



We have a pizza place that is much better than Pizza Hut and it is only a block up. We laugh because while Pizza Hut is busy, we can always get a seat at this little place and we know we are getting a better product.

Mike (C-Town)



Yeah John Richie better clear an hour out of his schedule today for a bathroom break

ReischeaFutureHusband (Washington, DC)



Tebow is a tightend and a wildcat qb.

Richard (West Virginia)



36crazyfists (ALASKA) other than heyward bey show me a pick the raiders made that was such a great reach all their picks were players people expected to go early they just didn&apos;t work out

james (wyoming)



Yep Matt, I know. I&apos;ll just stick to burgers and wings and fresh brewed beer down at Lovejoy&apos;s

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Thank you JB and I do...I think he should play next year and say so before the draft

stacy (georgetown)



guys i think tim tebow will go to dallas...your thoughts on this mod,, reish.....

Matt (Laramie, WY)



@ Selena - I was in the Air Force and that Anthony&apos;s you are talking about I agree it is horrible ate it one time and swore never to do it again.

joey (tx)



Anybody gonna watch Psych?

Trevor (Clinton Township, MI)



I don&apos;t know if you guys have asked this, but does Adam Richman go &quot;refunding&quot; after his eating challenges or does he digest it?

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



I&apos;m in the AF, and I fully know about Anthony&apos;s eww

36crazyfists (ALASKA)



dude jamarcus russell? i guarantee most teams would have let him fall, it was obvious.

Matt (Laramie, WY)



James in Wyoming - I like the Chuckwagon on 3rd eat there quite often.

JP (Baton Rouge)



that would be pretty stellar with Tebow and Jones running the WIldcat for the Cowboys

Barbara (sacramento)



I hope not stacy. Don&apos;t need him in dallas. one prima donna there in romo is enough. besides he would be another TO and cry whenever he didn&apos;t get to play. dallas has enough drama and we don&apos;t need more

Richard (West Virginia)



Its not just the deep dish i don&apos;t want chewing gum for pizza crust the crisp new york pizza is the only way to go

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



I&apos;ve lived in Chicago, Indy, LA and Florida and I&apos;ve always liked the local spots better than the chains

ReischeaFutureHusband (Washington, DC)



Dallas? for what? i think they sell enough tickets. no point

Nathan (Daytona beach)



Skip is a hyociate he had this same argument about Russel that he play norte dame and he was overrated..Tim tebow played cincy and now it doesnt matter..gave me a break

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



Tebow to the Jets lol

mod   (11:26 AM) 



ya see, now why is that laugh out loud funny??? Can I get a ruling on that?
 
Selena (Louisiana)



Puhleese Dallas don&apos;t need Tebow.

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



no such thing as bad pizza

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



no joey, no

Matt (Laramie, WY)



@ Mod your call out was funnier.

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Tebow to the Colts....would be interrseting

kevin (euclid, OH)



NOT FUNNY

Mike (C-Town)



Nathan there is a difference. Jamarcus is a lazy fat bum and tebow has some worth ethic and will do what he can to make himself better.

Matt (Laramie, WY)



If you cannot fold you pizza in half it is not pizza...

Roller (Kentucky)



he said &quot;wrecking shop&quot;...like that

Richard (West Virginia)



no it wasn&apos;t when there were only two really first round Qbs in the draft and both were expected to be top 10 it was a major shock that brady quinn fell to the brown

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



i&apos;d take tebow on the jets

Wes (Big Orange Country)



Me too Mod he does things different

Selena (Louisiana)



Buffalo Wild Wings

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Tebow to the Jets is not LOL funny mod...you are right...he wouldn&apos;t like being on Page 6

Richard (West Virginia)



Adam G. that was not lol maybe lqtm but not lol

James (Denver)



Five guys burgers have been in Colorado for years and were pretty far from the East Coast here in Colorado if you havent noticed by the way ESPN seems to forget we exsist!

Roller (Kentucky)



Not LOL funny!

megan (ohio)

Hayden (Logan, Ut)

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



tebow would run the wildcat better than brad smith

joey (tx)

If there was a bacon double cheeseburger in the end zone I bet Russell would then play some ball.

Adam G. (Tampa, FL)



yall are on the mods bandwagon

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



tebow is not a good qb he is a rb

&quot;The Icon&quot; (Unknown)



none of you know what ur talking about: tebow will be a QB,will not be draftd 1st round,late 2nd round. NY pizza is the best!!buffalo has the best wings!!Colts win SB!!deanna said brett had his year, deanna makes the rules in thr farve household

Richard (West Virginia)



wasting picks is never funny

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



WHAT!!! Colorado is far from the east coast?!!! NO!!! YOU&apos;RE KIDDING RIGHT?!!!!!

trai ((big blue nation))



we love colorado;the springs

Dave (St. Pete)



Enough with watching people stuff their faces. This is unwatchable!See ya, and find another producer. Don&apos;t care to watch people stuffing their pie holes.

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Right Joey...Sliders Britney and Taco Bell Denise for my Super bowl party

john (panama city bch, fl)



ROMO&apos;s a Prima Donna? Mebbe i was just de-sencitized by T.O.- but What has Romeo do for self-promotion? Dating Jessica was personal- but hyped by the media...no sit-ups on his lawn!

kevin (euclid, OH)



I dunno guys, the snarl on Russells face when he walks off the field after overthowing a receiver is worth his salary

Trevor (Clinton Township, MI)



Whoever decided to fly in Adam Richman deserves a HOF burger themselves...bravo!

kenny (kentucky)



rob parker is so a farve hater, how can he even say mcnabb would be better than farve. Since when has mcnabb won a important game.

joey (tx)



Dallas is getting Shipley! And Earl Thomas!

Richard (West Virginia)



robert gallert was supossed to be a great left tackle but now hes a great right guard and i&apos;ll agree on fabian washington but Al davis loves cornerbacks

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



Trevor: Pizza preference can be about the proportion of sauce to cheese. If you prefer cheesy pizza, I think NY style is better. If you are one who wants more sauce, I would say Chicago style is for you.

Barbara (sacramento)



whats with all the attitudes today. good grief. so many rude people. dana not here to keep them straight

Mike (C-Town)



Dave St Pete - Don&apos;t let the door hit you on the way out.

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



tebow can not throw better than him

Richard (West Virginia)



D.HARVEY is tebow even fast enough to be a rb if he can&apos;t play good NFl Qb is there a place for him in the nfl

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Best chain fast food Taco Bell or Taco Johns.

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



I like Adam G. but that wasn&apos;t LOL funny.

mod   (11:31 AM) 



nothing personal intended here
 
Barbara (sacramento)



maybe dallas can somehow get stiller from clemson. that would be cool.

Roller (Kentucky)



lots of cheeeeeeeze

Larry (Houston )



earl thomas is STILL a freshman Joey

kenny (kentucky)



tebow to niners, they have 2 picks and singletary wants winners and football players. likely won&apos;t happen but thought i would throw it out there

joey (tx)



what is taco johns?

SteveFitz (Cicero, IL)



When I was in NY I must of tried 5 different pizza places and all of them were the same. Thin as paper slimmy grease dripping from the pizza. They were terrible. Reminded me of Sbarro&apos;s pizza and if anyone thinks that&apos;s pizza then they don&apos;t know pizza.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Arby&apos;s is best fast food!

Mike (C-Town)



Matt - Taco Bell? Are you serious?

trai ((big blue nation))



jack in the box case closed

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



Hardees/Carls is 2nd best fast food!

Umor (Detroit)



Jerry Jones would take Tebow in a heartbeat if he&apos;s availble. Just for the press.

Richard (West Virginia)



Franc your crazy i want a burger not roast beef

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



tebow would also be good on atlanta or houston

Selena (Louisiana)



With an earlier statement, Tebow could be an RB and in special situations be at QB. On another note, I never been to NY but when I get there, gonna hit up a NY Pizza!!!!!!!

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Taco Johns is a tex mex fast food restaurant similar to Taco Bell.

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



somebody has to hold for the extra point

joey (tx)



no he is not. rs soph and already declared.

Brett (Boise)



Kenny (Kentucky) Singletary doesn&apos;t want or need another Urban Meyer &quot;project&quot;.

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Mike (C-Town) I have alway loved Taco Bell don&apos;t ask me why I just alway have.

Trevor (Clinton Township, MI)



JB, I love all pizza....I just can&apos;t see how pizza &quot;lovers&quot; could hate on one or the other (NY/CHI)...like I said, its not a frozen DiGiorno going into the hot box.

kevin (euclid, OH)



Mcdonalds breakfast!! No question

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Taco Johns has better food than Taco Bell but you cannot beat taco Bells prices.

joey (tx)



no CHick-fil-a is the best, followed by weinerschnetzel (dont know how to spell it)

ALLEN (PORT WASHINGTON, NY)



i never tried chicargo pizza...so no coment

Mike (C-Town)



It&apos;s ok matt, I am sure in Laramie you don&apos;t have many options. For mexican food that is quick, find a Qdoba or Chipolte or even a pancharos.

Richard (West Virginia)



i say white castle is the best but mainly because i have had white castle in 9 years

megan (ohio)



we have sams in newton falls, the best mom and pop pizza ever!

Matt (Laramie, WY)



Best fast food breakfast - the Carl Jr&apos;s here in Laramie all you can eat biscuits and gravy for $1.59.

SteveFitz (Cicero, IL)



JB, that&apos;s about right. For us here in Chicago, it&apos;s all about the sauce.

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



oh yea, forgot about Chik fil a

J.B. (Dunmore, PA)



If Tebow was drafted by Miami, would the team nickname be changed to &apos;the Wildcats&apos;?

D.HARVEY (HOUSTON)



look at the offenses they have played

Trevor (Clinton Township, MI)



Has anyone been to Whataburger? I went to Oklahoma with my parents a few years ago to visit my brother and it taunted me the whole time we were there as we never went, so I&apos;d like to know what I was missing lol.

White Castle, love there burgers!!!

Umor (Detroit)



Hey, Don&apos;t be hating on sliders dawgs. A stack and a large big gulp. That&apos;s good eattin

I&apos;m a HUGE fan of the Champ Burger from Checkers. They used to ahve them here in Chicago, but not anymore. When I go to Georgia every year I make sure to have Checkers when I&apos;m down there.

joey (tx)



Churchs chicken is the cheapest fast food place in the history of the world. 14 piece meal for like 5.99.

Allen -- Oh Yes Popeye&apos;s cajun chicken. N.O. style.

Omar (Houston,TX)



For the most part I agree with skip on having a high standards on great athletes but Rob gave skip a taste of his own medicine on grading Favre season. Being great is judge by winning championships. skip has said the many times

Tyler (ATX)



Tebow needs to go to a team that needs a tight end or H-back. He won&apos;t make it as a QB or a RB. His slow delivery makes his Byron Leftwich that can move a little bit at QB and his far too slow to play RB in the NFL.

joey (tx)



Whatburger is the bomb. We are the smallest city in the world but we have 4 of them. thats how good it is. no lies by the way.

SteveFitz (Cicero, IL)



Anyone ever try a burger at the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix? Saw it on the food network once. Looked pretty good to me.

Roller (Kentucky)



It&apos;s the play calling and not McNabb...gotta run the ball more and why can&apos;t they let McNabb run more, come on?!

Caddy Mike (Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida)



Adam, not so far fetched...I can see Garcon with 2 td catches easily

Larry (Houston )



Now if ya want fried chicken, next time any of you folks come to Houston you should try FRENCHIE&apos;S CHICKEN, or WILLIAMS CHICKEN

joey (tx)



No KFC is the best people. Popeyes has the bet biscuits though

john (panama city bch, fl)



I don&apos;t like WhataBurger...guess that&apos;s why God made jelly beans in different colors- everybody&apos;s different.

tebow to SF!!

Richard (West Virginia)



Matt (Laramie, WY) trade him to someone else maybe the broncos

jason007thomas (Huntsville,AL&gt;)



hey as far as Tebow look - the guy catching all those passes for the colts last week, X-QB, also a guy for the Jaguars I think matt jones (i might be wrong) X-QB so just let the guy decide what he wants to do - but he does have the florida qb curse on him

Barbara (sacramento)



richard don&apos;t forget old bret. we will have to listen everyday about whether he will or he won&apos;t come back. thank God for remote controls. i would love to know what skip eats

Barbara (sacramento)



did anyone watch ncis la last night

Hayden (Logan, Ut)



tebow is gonna retire after a year to be a priest

joey (tx)



Does anybody else go to a Chinease buffet just for the chicken nuggets?

Franc (Kennesaw GA)



The loser of next years Ohio St./Michigan bet should do a Hot Dog eating contest vs. Joey Chestnut

For the most part I agree with skip on having a high standards on great athletes but Rob gave skip a taste of his own medicine on grading Favre season. Being great is judge by winning championships. skip has said that many times so admit you are wrong on this one.

matt jones was way better than tebow

James (Denver)



Do you guys know what the Wildcat offense is? It isnt what Tebow ran at Florida! That was a form of the Spread offense. Tebow just voupdnt throw the ball down 6he field so they had to let him run on almost every ppay. Tebow wont be bigger and stronger then NFL players and hes not at all fast! So hes going to have no success in the NFL at all. The Wildcat offense is the running back at QB and moving the QB around on the field. You cant run the true Wildcat with a QB at QB thats not the Wildcat offense.

joey (tx)



That was awesome that that baseball player retired to be a priest.

john (panama city bch, fl)



Yes Barbara- Bert fARVER and Tim Tebow guest starred

Richard (West Virginia)



jason007thomas he has decide he wants to be a qb and all those other guys had the skill to play other positions i don&apos;t think tebow has the skill to be a Rb or a TE i don&apos;t even know if he can catch

Hook (Southern Maryland)



Joey, those Chinese/American buffets are the greatest creation ever!!!

Tim Tebow played in a Spread Offense at Florida. They did not have one single Wildcat plat in there offense. Do you guy know what the Wildcat is? Odviously not because Tebow never played in anything close to a Wildcat offense. Floridas offense was closer to the true Option offense then the Wildcat!
