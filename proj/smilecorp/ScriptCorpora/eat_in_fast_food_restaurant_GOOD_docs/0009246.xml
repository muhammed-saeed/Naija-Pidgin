Dave&apos;s Bicycle Tips
 
 This is a page of bike tips that I will be updating from time to 
time.
 Recently updated item: 
* Crunching / popping noises comming from bottom area of bike 
 Quick Navigation: 
 Bathrooms | Bike Pumps | Bike Racks | Bottom Bracket - crank a bit tight even when you&apos;ve readjusted it a few times | Chewing Gum on Tire | Crunching / popping noises comming from bottom area of bike | Glasses | One Piece Cranks | Parking Lots | Patch Kits | Pedals | Personal Security | Rain | Rear Derailleurs | Rear Gear Cluster | Screw Removal | Sidewalk Riding | Spokes | Street/Road Riding | Twist Ties | Uses for steel wool soap pads | Water | Wheels | Winter Riding in the City | Wire Cutters |
 
 Bathrooms: 
 
 We have all had those times when on a ride we need the use of a nearby 
bathroom. If there is not a park nearby with restrooms, the following are places (usually) 
you can go into for bathroom use:

 Department Stores.
 Some Public Libraries (although, some Public Libraries restrict restroom use to patrions only, so look to see if a restroom policy is posted near the restrooms).
 Shopping Malls.
 Supermarkets.


 
There are also fast food restaurant chains such as McDonald&apos;s , Burger King , Arby&apos;s , ect, which have bathrooms. 
The basic rule of thumb here is that if the place in question has a sign in the 
window or inside that the bathrooms are for customers only, you will need to buy 
something to partake of the bathroom. However, if there is no such sign in the 
window or inside, then feel free to go inside and use the bathroom without 
buying something (however, with this, the rule of thumb is to get in and get out 
without drawing attention to yourself). But, while this usually works with a 
chain outlet, you won&apos;t want to try this at a privately owned fast food place.
Additional:
At fast food chains such as McDonald&apos;s , Burger King , Arby&apos;s , ect, if you&apos;ve been going to a location for a while to use the bathroom, another thing to keep in mind - if you&apos;ve been using an unlocked door that is close to the bathrooms and one day you suddently find it locked, it is probably an indication that the place in question dosen&apos;t like the idea that non-customers are using their bathrooms. At this point, proceed with caution. If there is another place nearby with a bathroom, go there instead. If this is the only bathroom in the area, then go in through another door and, without drawing attention to yourself, go to the bathroom, do your duty, then leave without drawing attention to yourself. But be aware that there is a 50/50 chance that you may be called on it - be prepaired to buy something to cover your tracks.
There is another thing to take into consideration at fast food chains when going in to use the bathroom. I&apos;ve been noticing a trend developing in which small groups of customers will get together at fast food chains in the morning, drink coffee, talk to each other, and sit near the bathrooms (usually, there is only one of these groups per location). Nine times out of ten, these groups will mind their business and not bother you. However, one time out of ten, you will go into a location to discover a group of customers that has nothing better to do that to mind the business of everybody walking through the door, and will harrass those who do nothing but come in to use the bathroom. If you encounter such harrassment, my advice is to ignore them, walk out, and never return to the place to use the bathroom since if they are bold enough to harrass you, they might be bold enough to do anything. Better to be safe than sorry.

 Bike Pumps: 
 
 When working with a floor bike pump, and suddently the internal plunger 
disconnects from the internal rod it is connected to, try this: with one hand, 
pick up the pump and turn it upside down, and keep holding the pump. With the 
other hand, pull out the pump handle a little bit, then, with the palm of your 
hand, smack the pump handle into the pump as hard as you can.
I once had the internal plunger on my floor pump disconnect from the internal 
rod it was connected to. On a hunch, I carried out the above action and the 
internal plunger reconnected with the internal rod it was connected to, and I 
had a working floor pump again. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Bike Racks: 
 
 The correct way to park your bike on a bike rack is to face your bike into the rack, then lock your bike up to the rack. In that way, you are making sure that more bicycle riders are able to use the rack.
In the event you are not able to face your bike into the rack (if, say, the bike rack is smaller than normal and has skinny openings only designed for racing bikes and you have a mountain bike), I&apos;d say forget that rack completely and find yourself a tree or other secure source to lock your bike to.
A suggestion for using a bike rack: we all like using the end of the bike rack, but let&apos;s try to be practical for each other&apos;s sake. If your using a chain or coil to lock up your bike to the rack, use the middle of the rack and save the end of the bike rack for those who use u-locks (those who use u-locks will thank you from the bottom of their hearts).
Another suggestion for using a bike rack: sometimes a bike rack will fill up quickly, and there isn&apos;t a place for you to park on the rack. When you see a bike rider approach the rack to unlock his or her bike and prepare to leave, don&apos;t, repeat don&apos;t, stand there and stare down the person unlocking the bike in an attempt to hurry them up (that&apos;s really quite rude when you think about it). Instead, wait patiently while the person unlocks his or her bike, allow the person to leave, then lock your bike to the rack. Also don&apos;t, repeat don&apos;t, try to force yourself into the spot at the same time a person is unlocking his or her bike (again, that&apos;s really quite rude). Again, wait patiently while the person unlocks his or her bike, allow the person to leave, then lock your bike to the now available space.
Meanwhile, a suggestion for department stores and grocery stores: if you have a number of customers who ride bikes and you want to provide a bike rack for them to use, please provide a longer bike rack with wider spaces that will accommodate both skinny racing bikes and wider mountain bikes. Please stay away from providing a short bike rack with skinny spaces only designed for racing bikes (the rack may be inexpensive for you to install, but you&apos;ll really be doing those who use mountain bikes a disservice and you may actually drive away some bike riding customers as a result). Also, please stay away from installing the kind of bike racks that sit close to the ground and act as simple grates that bikes roll their front wheel onto (these bike racks are only really designed for bikes that use a chain or coil to lock a bike to a bike rack, and are not designed for bikes that use a u-lock to lock up a bike).
While we are on the subject of bike racks, there is something to consider when parking at a grocery store or a department store that provides a bike rack. Be aware that some department stores and grocery stores will expect you to use their bike rack, and only their bike rack, and will frown on you locking up your bike to a nearby pole or firmly planted stop sign (in fact, don&apos;t be surprised at places like this if a cart person walks up to you and says in a polite but pert voice, &quot;you know, we do have a bike rack&quot;). In a case like this, try to avoid the hassel and use the bike rack if a space is available and the rack will accommodate your bike (fortunately, places with this attitude are few and far inbetween). If, however, the bike rack in question will not accommodate your bike, then I&apos;d seriously consider if you want to do business with that store.

 Bottom Bracket - crank a bit tight even when you&apos;ve readjusted it a few times: 
 
 Problem is most likely comming from inside your bottom bracket. Take apart your bottom bracket and check for cups that may be worn. Remove worn cups, replace the worn cups you removed with new cups, check your ball bearings while your at it and replace them as well if needed, grease internal parts, and reassemble the bottom bracket. This should take care of the problem. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Chewing Gum on Tire: 
 
 We&apos;ve all been there - you are riding along and before you know it, you run over some chewing gum that somebody has spit out. Before long, this wad of gum on your tire starts collecting dirt, small pebbles, and whatever else you might want to mention.
Yes, this can be a mess. However, this is also something that you can easily take care of.
First of all, always carry a napkin or rag with you in case something like this happens. Then, using the napkin or rag, wipe off as much of the gum from the tire as you can. Then, to finish up, take your water bottle and spray some water on the area of the tire where the gum was (this will make sure that what is left of the gum is no longer sticky, and in turn will no longer pick up dirt, small pebbles, and whatever else you might want to mention). Normal riding will then cause what is left of the gum to wear off after a while. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Crunching / popping noises comming from bottom area of bike: 
 
 When riding your bike, if you hear popping noises comming from the bottom area of the bike, first check to see if your kickstand is fully up (sometimes, the kickstand may not be fully up, and as a result the crank may hit the kickstand on each revolution of the crank, causing a popping noise of it&apos;s own). If the kickstand is the cause, make sure the kickstand is fully up and continue riding.
If it is not the kickstand causing the noises, then the noises are most likely comming from inside your bottom bracket. Take apart your bottom bracket and check for worn parts such as caged bearings that may be in the process of falling apart, and cups that may be worn. Remove worn parts, replace the worn parts you removed with new parts (and grease the new parts as well), and reassemble the bottom bracket. This should get rid of the crunching and popping noises. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Glasses: 
 
 For those who wear glasses: when wearing a helmet, when you take your glasses 
off for a moment while continueing to wear the helmet, when you go to put your 
glasses back on, make sure the temples of your glasses don&apos;t hook onto 
the chin strap of your helmet. If the temples of your glasses do accidently hook onto the chin strap of your helmet, when you go to take off the 
helmet at some point, your glasses will try to come off too (something you do 
not want to happen). So, it is always wise to make sure that the temples of your 
glasses arn&apos;t hooked to the chin strap of your helmet. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 One Piece Cranks: 
 
 If your bike has a one piece crank and you have trouble with your bottom bracket &quot;unscrewing&quot; a bit and becomming loose, even after you readjust the cone and locknut on the non-chainring side of the one piece crank, chances are that the locknut is worn and is not tightening up properly. In this case, simply visit your neighborhood bike shop, buy a new locknut, and replace your old locknut with the new locknut. This should fix the problem nicely. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Parking Lots: 
 
 Ah, yes - parking lots. What can I say except that parking lots are something that sometimes you need to be careful in, especially where bikes and cars are involved. When you, the bike rider, are passing through a parking lot, here is what to be alert for:

 People darting out into traffic lanes.
 Cars backing out of parking spaces.
 Cars darting across a series of open parking spaces.
 The occassional car and driver that dosen&apos;t obey a stop sign.
 The occassional car and driver that is speeding.
 Concrete islands at various points in the parking lot (these can become traffic bottlenecks real fast under peak traffic conditions. And watch out for cars that appear to come out of nowhere).
 Cars parked next to concrete islands, but sitting in the traffic lane.
 Cars comming out of nowhere. One moment, your path is clear. The next moment, thar she blows, a car that you swear wasn&apos;t there a moment ago is now heading toward you. And in most cases, does the car driver alert you that he or she is comming by honking the horn? No. If this happens, the best thing is to take evasive action immediately by either coming to a quick stop or swerving out of the way, whatever is best depending on your current situation. And resist the urge to yell - all that does is cause bad feelings on both sides.
 

Most times, riding through a parking lot is uneventful. But there are always those days where some people you encounter in a parking lot are in a hurry to get to god only knows where. Be alert, pay attention for what I have put above, and you&apos;ll be fine. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Patch Kits: 
 
 When buying a rubber patch kit in a department store, instead of heading for the bicycle department, head straight to the automotive department. More often than not, for about the same price you would pay in the bicycle department, you&apos;ll find a better quality rubber patch kit in the automotive department (for example, I recently had to get a new patch kit. I went to the automotive department of a local department store and found a patch kit that came with a whopping huge 1/2 fl oz tube of rubber cement, along with the rubber patches. That certaintly beat the patch kit being offered in the bicycle department which had the standard skimpy small tube of rubber cement. And the patch kit being offered in the automotive department was the same price as the patch kit being offered in the bicycle department). 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Pedals: 
 
 The most unlooked after feature on a bicycle: the pedals. Make sure you can 
unscrew them from the pedal arms easily. Once the pedals are removed or are unscrewed at least 75% (whatever is easier for you), grease the threads and screw the pedals back on the pedal arms. And check to see, say twice a month during dry weather (after every ride if you ride in winter weather due to the very wet conditions), that the pedals continue to be easy to remove. I am telling you this for a reason. You don&apos;t want the threads on the pedals to become so unlooked after that they &quot;freeze&quot; onto the pedal arms (and trust me, if this happens, you&apos;ll work like heck to get the pedals off. Not a fun thing to look forward to).
Replacing pedals: occassionally, you&apos;ll need to get a new pair of pedals. When doing this, be sure to notice what size the pedals are. When I talk about size, I&apos;m takling about the thread area where the pedal screws onto the pedal arm. Some pedals have a thread area where the thread area is skinny and long (known as 1/2&quot; thread), while other pedals have a thread area where the thread area is fatter and shorter (known as 9/16&quot; thread). You&apos;ll need to know which of these two sizes your pedals are so you can get the correct size pedals for your pedal arms (a good rule of thumb is this: one piece cranks normally take 1/2&quot; thread pedals, and three piece cranks normally take 9/16&quot; thread pedals).
Replacing pedals (additional information): for myself, I&apos;ve found that the less expensive plastic pedals simply don&apos;t hold up. They crack easily, and soon after they crack they start falling apart. When replacing pedals, it&apos;s better to spend a little more money and get a pair of pedals that will last much longer. When considering buying pedals that will last longer, two kinds that really hold up are metal rat trap pedals (available through many bicycle shops), and rubber block pedals (available through some department stores).
How to unscrew pedals: to loosen a pedal for removal, rotate its crank forward toward the front of the bike, fit on the wrench, then push the wrench downward toward the rear of the bike. This procedure will work for each pedal in turn.
How to screw on pedals: rotate right crank forward toward the front of the bike, then screw pedal marked &quot;R&quot; onto the right crank by pushing the wrench downward toward the front of the bike. After you have put on the &quot;R&quot; pedal onto the right crank, rotate the left crank forward toward the front of the bike, then screw pedal marked &quot;L&quot; onto the left crank by pushing the wrench downward toward the front of the bike.
Other:
Less expensive pedals where the dust cap is not removable: with these kind of pedals, they may &quot;squeak&quot; from time to time. Since you can&apos;t remove the dust cap on each pedal, you can&apos;t take the pedal apart to service the pedal. However, there is a way to fix the &quot;squeak&quot; - take off each pedal (most likely both pedals will &quot;squeak&quot;, so you&apos;ll need to check both), pour 3-in-1 oil into each pedal axle where the axle screws into pedal arm, turn each pedal axle with your fingers until the pedal axle becomes unsluggish (while occassionally pouring 3-in-1 oil into the axle if needed), then put each pedal back on the pedal arms. This should get rid of the &quot;squeak&quot;. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Personal Security: 
 
 Every once and a while, you&apos;ll have a non-cyclist come along and ask 
questions about your bike. Most times, it is somebody who is mostly harmless, 
who is curious about your bike, and just wants to start a conversation. I&apos;ve had 
some nice conversations with people like that. As long as it stays like this, 
you&apos;ll be fine.
But, be warned, some non-cyclists use this as a foot in the door as it were, 
then cleaverly start asking questions about you, such as where you live, and 
what your phone number is. In this case, keep being polite, act as though 
nothing has changed, but be cautious - this is now getting a bit personal, and 
you should never give out personal information to a stranger (you don&apos;t really 
know who this person is - the person could be mostly harmless, or maybe not). If 
asked for your name, just give your first name (if the person wants your last 
name, quickly make something up). If asked for your phone number (usually to 
talk to you later or to sell you something), give a false phone number (even if 
you just change one or two of the last four digits). If asked where you live, 
quickly make something up (but never give your real home location). Then, being 
nice, end the conversation and be on your way. That way, you were nice, and at 
the same time you avoided a breach of security as it were. Chances are you&apos;ll 
never see this person again.
Some of the non-cyclists described in the previous paragraph will also try to 
ask you if you have some change or a few bucks you can spare. The best response 
in regard to this is to nicely say something along the lines of &quot;Sorry, I&apos;m 
tapped out right now&quot; (usually, this is enough to stop them). Then, nicely 
end the conversation and be on your way.
Remember, simple curiousity is one thing. But when a stranger starts 
cleaverly trying to get personal information or money from you, that is the time 
to be cautious. It&apos;s a sad thing, but in this day and age, you can never be too 
careful. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Rain: 
 
 When there is a chance of rain, carry a plastic rain poncho with you (they 
are quite inexpensive, and are avaliable through most discount stores and dollar 
stores). If it does rain during your bike ride, by having a plastic rain poncho 
with you, you can put in on and stay dry. In addition to a plastic rain poncho, 
you might want to also carry with you a pair of lightweight gloves (rain can be 
cold on your hands, and if if rains, you&apos;ll want a pair of lightweight gloves to 
keep your hands warm).
As for actually riding in the rain, be aware that rain turns some car drivers 
into fricken idiots - some car drivers, while driving in the rain, will take 
stupid chances like darting out in front of traffic. So be watchful of this.
For the vast majority of bikes, equipped with hand brakes and rubber brake 
pads, when riding in the rain, give yourself twice the distance you normally 
would while breaking (because it will take twice as long to stop in the rain]. 
If you need to stop quickly, as you brake, rock yourself from front to back 
[this sets up an energy that helps the bike come to a stop).
After a ride in the rain, and after your bike is dry, spray the chain with a 
spray lubricant to prevent rust from forming on the chain. You&apos;ll also want to 
use spray lubricant on your front derailleur, rear derailleur, and freewheel to 
replace any lubricant lost while riding in the rain. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Rear Derailleurs: 
 
 You&apos;ve gone through your repair manual(s), checked into everything listed, 
and your rear derailleur still won&apos;t shift properly? Here&apos;s something else to 
check: perhaps your cable wire housing is crimped somehow, is dirty inside, or 
both? 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Rear Gear Cluster: 
 
 Having trouble with your chain automatically going down to the next lowest gear every so often? Try this: on the thumb shifter that controls the rear gear cluster, you&apos;ll find that it has a screw that is located on the top center of the thumb shifter. Tighten that screw a little bit, and the problem should disappear.
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Screw Removal: 
 
 We always need screws and nuts to attach fenders and rear racks to our bikes. Occassionally, we also need to remove these same screws and nuts. But what do we do if a screw and nut become a bit rusty and needs to be removed? First off, spray the area with something like Liquid Wrench Super Lubricant . Let it sit for a few minutes, then try to remove the screw and nut. More often than not, this will work and everything will be fine.
If, however, the screw and nut still won&apos;t come off, and you&apos;ve started to strip the flat or phillips head of the screw, what you&apos;ll need to do is to spray the screw and nut again, wait a few minutes, then get yourself a good pair of vice grips. Attach the vice grips as tight as you can to the sides of the screw head so the screw will not move. While holding the vice grips on the screw head so the screw won&apos;t move, take a wrench and start trying to slowly loosen the nut. After a while, the nut should start to loosten to the point where the nut should come off.
After you have removed the screw and nut, replace the screw and nut you have taken off with a new screw and nut (it&apos;s never a wise idea to reuse a screw and nut once they start giving you trouble - they will only keep giving you trouble. It&apos;s always better to replace a troublesome screw and nut with a new screw and nut).

 Sidewalk Riding: 
 
 If your community prohibits sidewalk riding, skip this section.
When riding on the sidewalk, you need to watch out for the following (in no 
set order):

 Dogs loose in yards (avoid if possible).
 Dogs running loose (avoid if possible).
 People walking dogs (avoid if possible).
 Broken glass on the sidewalk.
 People walking out of doorways.
 Kids racing out of doorways.
 Kids getting on and off school busses.
 People getting on and off public busses.
 People standing around at bus stops.
 Cars pulling in and out of driveways and parking lots.
 Car parked across sidewalk.
 At intersections: cars blocking crosswalks.
 At intersections: cars comming up like a bat out of you-know-where.
 At side streets: cars comming up like a bat of out you-know-where.
 People walking on the sidewalk.
 People walking on the sidewalk who, for whatever reason, see you comming 
 and decide that they want to walk right in front of your path.
 People walking on the sidewalk who don&apos;t like bicycles and bicycle riders and who will deliberately get in your way with the intent of forcing you off the sidewalk (note: if your community allows sidewalk riding, then you have every right to be on the sidewalk. These people are the ones with a problem - not you).
 People walking with their eyes looking toward the ground, not looking 
 where they are going.
 People walking on the sidewalk who are using canes, walkers, and crutches.
 Construction taking place on a section of sidewalk.
 Construction taking place on a storefront.
 Window washers.
 Large groups of people standing around restaurants or other 
businesses.
 Large groups of students getting out of school for the day. 
 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Spokes: 
 
 One of those Murphy&apos;s Law things: on the rear wheel, if a spoke 
breaks, it is most likely to be on the side where the freewheel is.
When doing a trueing job on one of your wheels, one easy way to remember 
which spoke you are working on is to tie a string to the spoke in question. 
That way, when you are moving the wheel to see if it is true and you have to 
do some more work on that spoke, you can easily find the spoke you were 
working on. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Street/Road Riding: 
 
 It is always better to ride with traffic instead of against traffic. If you need to ride against traffic for a short period, stick to the 
 shoulder of the road (no shoulder? then I&apos;d say forget about it).
When you come across road construction, obey the flag person. If the flag 
 person signals you to stop, then by all means stop and wait until you are told 
 to proceed. And yes, I am telling you this for a reason. I was at a road 
 construction site in 2003. When the flag person signaled me to stop, I 
 stopped. However, a bicycle rider right behind me proceeded to go right 
 through the construction zone and never stopped once [not only was this a 
 total disregard to the flag person, not only could the offending bicyclist 
 have been hurt (but thank whatever god you worship that he wasn&apos;t hurt), but 
 this kind of disregard can also give the rest of the bicycling community a bad 
 name - and it only takes one dummy to do this].
Watch out for:

 Dogs loose in yards (avoid if possible).
 Dogs running loose (avoid if possible).
 People walking dogs (avoid if possible).
 Broken glass on the street.
 Cars going in and out of driveways, parking lots and side streets.
 Drivers and passengers in parked cars suddently opening their car doors in 
 front of you.
 Jaywalkers suddently darting out in front of you.
 On residential streets, watch for kids playing sports (basketball, 
 foootball, street hockey) on the streets.
 At intersections, watch out for cars at intersections. The thing is that
 many car drivers don&apos;t think of bicycles as real vehicles, and will
 in many cases try to cut you off, even if you have the right of way.
 At intersections, watch out for car drivers who are in a hurry to make a turn in front of you. You can be waiting there, obeying a stop sign or waiting for a signal light to turn green, and a car driver wants to turn so bad that he or she honks at you because he or she thinks you are in the way (never mind you are sitting there over to the side out of the way obeying traffic rules).

 Twist Ties: 
 
 It is always a good idea to carry a few twist ties with you when on a ride. When a nut and bolt from, say, a fender mount shakes off during a ride, you can use a twist tie to secure the fender mount back to the bike frame until you can get a replacement nut and bolt. 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Uses for steel wool soap 
 pads: 
 
 Cleaning rusty spokes (in this case, don&apos;t wet the steel wool 
 soap pad - simply go over the spokes with a dry pad).
Cleaning gray vinyl bike seats (in this case, you want a moist, but not 
 completly wet pad. Use the moist pad and lightly scrub the seat until the dirt 
 comes off. Then use a wet rag to remove the soap from the seat, and then use a 
 dry rag to dry off the seat). 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Water: 
 
 Using your water bottle when eating at a fast food restaurant: 
If you don&apos;t like drinking soda when you are out riding, and you want to stop into a fast food restaurant so you can sit down and eat something, I have found it is perfectly acceptable for you to take your water bottle in with you and to drink from it. From the number of fast place restaurants I have been in, the attitude of the restaurants seem to be that as long as you are buying something to eat, they don&apos;t care if you use your water bottle for drinking. I would suggest, however, you don&apos;t try this at more upscale places where it might be frowned upon.
If you are not asked by the clerk if you want to eat in or take out, and you want to eat in, in a polite way make sure the clerk knows you want to eat in - some clerks will see your water bottle and automatically assume you want take out.
Be aware that there may be the occassional fast food restaurant that has a &quot;no outside food&quot; policy posted. In a case like this, it&apos;s better to leave your water bottle on the bike and order a beverage along with your meal.
Some privately owned diners and restaurants (other than those serving fast food) might frown upon you bringing in a water bottle, so unless you&apos;ve been there before and know you can do it, don&apos;t take the water bottle in.
A definate no-no is to take your water bottle in with you when eating at a department store snack bar or supermarket snack bar - your water bottle could be mistaken for a piece of merchandise, you might be mistaken for a shoplifter, and then you have a lot of explaining to do (better to be safe than sorry in this case - don&apos;t take the water bottle in).
Most shopping mall food courts will not have a problem with you bringing in a water bottle as long as you keep the water bottle confined to the food court and don&apos;t take it inside any store (I would suggest, however, you don&apos;t try this at more upscale shopping malls where it might be frowned upon). 
&gt; Return to top of page. 
 
 Wheels: 
 
 Front and rear aluminum wheels with a fancy rubber tip located between each wheel nut and the hub: due to the fact that these wheels have a fancy rubber tip located between each wheel nut and the hub, you might, once in a blue moon, hear a squeaking sound comming from one of the wheels. In my experience, what is going on here is that the rubber tip has become a bit dry and is causing squeaking in the process. There is a simple way to deal with this. Simply spray a very thin coat of WD-40 or any other liquid lubricant on the area between the rubber tip and the hub. This will take care of the squeaking.
Plastic spoke protector on rear wheel: The newer style plastic spoke protectors do not slide onto the rear hub. Instead, the newer style plastic spoke protectors snap directly onto the rear hub, on the same ring that the spokes attach to the hub, by way of three plastic hooks. To install a newer style plastic spoke protector, remove the rear wheel from the bike, remove the freewheel from the rear wheel, then remove the spoke protector that was on the rear wheel. On the ring where the spokes attach to the hub, find spaces between the spokes where you may attach the newer style plastic spoke protector, then, while pushing in on the middle area of the newer style plastic spoke protector, place the three plastic hooks on the ring where the spokes attach to the hub. When the plastic hooks are on the ring, stop pushing in on the middle area of the plastic spoke protector and you&apos;ll find that the protector will securily attach itself. At this point, you are finished putting on the protector. Replace the freewheel, and put the rear wheel back on the bike.

 Winter Riding in the City: 
 
 We will assume that you are living in an area which has snow and cold conditions in winter. If, however, you are living in an area that is not cold and has no snow in the winter, you may feel free to skip this section.
 ======================================== 
 A few things to start you off: 

 The best kind of bicycle to ride in the winter is a fat tire mountain bike. The mountain bike, with it&apos;s fat tires, will give you better traction and control on snow covered streets.
 It is winter, so it will be cold out there. Dress accordingly (warm coat, sturdy boots, and warm gloves are a must). As for a coat, I prefer the &quot;snorkle&quot;-type winter coats with the attached hood that covers your entire head (if you can find such a coat with a large hood that will accommodate your head while wearing your helmet, that is even better).
 One thing I can&apos;t stress enough is the fact that black ice is not your friend, and will throw you to the ground when riding on it, no matter what kind of bicycle you are riding. If you are planning to ride when black ice conditions are present, let me stress that you leave your bike home for the day and take another form of transportation - that way, you avoid a black ice accident that could leave you injured for a while.
 There will be times where a severe winter storm is expected in your neck of the woods and is forcast to dump a ton of snow on the ground. When this kind of storm arrives, it is best to leave your bike home for the day and take another form of transportation if you have to go out (afterall, during times like this, bicycling will be down right impossible considering the excessive amount of snow on the ground). 

 And now for some other Winter-related things: 
After the Winter Ends:

 Be prepaired after a winter season of riding to adjust or replace at least one or two spokes on your back wheel. With the harsh conditions that occure during winter, your back wheel takes a beating and it is not uncommon for your back wheel to become a bit out of true.

Bikes with hand brakes and brake pads:

 Shortly before the snow starts to fall for the first time (around November), be sure to put new brake pads on your bike for maximum stopping power. And remember to again put new brake pads on your bike right after winter (around early-April to mid-April) since brake pads get a lot of wear and tear during the wet winter months. Take these times to check your brake inner wires as well - replace if needed.
 Keep an eye on your brake pads during the winter. If they need replacing sometime during the winter, by all means do so. During the wet winter months, you&apos;ll want to make sure your bike has maximum stopping power.

Chains and chainwheels:

 After a wet winter ride, be sure to lubricate your chain and chainwheel, as well as your freewheel, to keep rust at bay. A good spray lubricant will work just fine for this.

Crunchy Snow:

 You will occassionally encounter a mixture of snow and ice particles I refer to as crunchy snow . This is usually a fine layer on the ground. The good news is that crunchy snow can be riden over with no problem.

Pedals:

 Check to see that you can unscrew and rescrew your pedals after every ride during the winter months. Moisture can cause rust on the pedal screws. One way to combat this is to coat your pedal screws with lithium grease everytime you unscrew and rescrew your pedals.

Sudden Snow Storms:
It happens from time to time - you are out on the bike, and a sudden snow storm comes out of nowhere. Here is what to do:

 Don&apos;t panic - these things happen. Keep your cool and everything will be fine.
 The goal here is to make your way back home before it gets worse.
 Ride your bike on the street, but take it slow. If you are worried about the new snow that is falling, take into consideration that the new snow will actually give you some added traction. As for cars on the street, you will find that in situations like this, car drivers tend to be quite accommodating toward bike riders.
 For those using hand brakes and brake pads, since riding in a sudden snow storm means wet conditions, give yourself twice the room to come to a stop than you would during dryer times of the season.
 Be watchful for sliding cars (but, ironically, while cars have a tendendy to slide in such conditions, it has been my experience that bikes tend to be much more controllable in such conditions).
 There will always be a few cars who are in a hurry in such conditions. Just let them pass you and be on their way (if they are in that much of a hurry to get themselves rapped around a light pole, well, they deserve what they get).
 At this point, concentrate on the conditions, the traffic, and getting home. As I said above, take it slow. It will take longer, but you&apos;ll get there. It is always better to be safe than sorry.
 Once home, dry off and get warm.

Things to take into consideration when riding during Winter:

 Avoid slush on the side of the street - it can throw you if the conditions are right.
 Avoid tire tracks on the side of the street - these can throw you if the conditions are right.
 For those using hand brakes and brake pads, since riding in snow means wet conditions, give yourself twice the room to come to a stop than you would during dryer times of the year.
 For those who ride on the sidewalk (and whose communities allow this), in winter this is more often than not out of the question. The sad part is that quite a few sidewalks in winter are not properly shoveled, and are impassable for a bike. You will want to stick to the street in winter for 1)because most sidewalks tend to be impassable for bikes, and 2)in winter conditions, street riding will make you more visible to car drivers.
 If it is bitterly cold out, leave the bike at home for the day - conditions are probably right for black ice (which can be a danger to bike riders), plus the fact that some days it is just too cold to properly ride (you don&apos;t want to risk getting sick).
 Watch out for small icy spots on the street. The good news here is that most are so small that you can simply ride over them with no trouble. But if an icy spot does look like it is more than you can handle, proceed with caution, even avoid it if possible - better to be safe than sorry.
 You will be, in winter, riding a little further out in the street than usual because of snow on the sides of the street. I have found this to be perfectly acceptable to the vast majority of car drivers out there - in winter, they seem to like this because it makes you more visible to them. However, be aware that some car drivers simply don&apos;t expect bicycles to be out in the winter, and will sometimes do things like darting out from side streets without looking for bicycles, and sometimes even stop in your path for whatever reason.

 Wire Cutters: 
 
 For those who do their own bicycle repairs, one tool you will really want in tip top shape is a pair of top quality wire cutters for when you need to cut the excess off of a brake inner wire (a hand-me-down pair of wire cutters that have been well used just won&apos;t do - just try to cut a brake inner wire with a blunt pair of wire cutters and you&apos;ll see what I mean).
You can find top quality wire cutters in department stores for a reasonable price.
