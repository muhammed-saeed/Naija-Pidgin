 Dialogue

Mr and Mrs Smith are out celebrating their wedding anniversary.

 It&apos;s 8pm. Mr Smith (Jack) and Mrs Smith (Jill) are celebrating 
 their 10th wedding anniversary. They have just arrived at the restaurant. Mr Smith: Well here we are. What do you think? Mrs Smith: It&apos;s lovely Jack. Are you sure we can afford it? Mr Smith: Well I may have to do some washing up, but you&apos;re worth it. The waiter arrives. Waiter: Good evening sir, madame. Mr Smith: Good evening. We have a reservation for a table for two in the name of
 Smith. Waiter: Yes sir. May I take your coats?
 Waiter takes their coats and hangs them up. Mr&amp;Mrs Smith: Thank you. Waiter: Your welcome. Would you like to come to the table or would you prefer to
 order in the bar? Mr Smith: I wouldn&apos;t mind an aperitif. We&apos;ll order in the bar. Waiter: Please follow me, I&apos;ll bring you the menu in a moment. 

 
Mr&amp;Mrs Smith order their drinks at the bar and 
 sit down to look at the menu.
 Mrs Smith: Oh dear Jack, it&apos;s all in French! Mr Smith: Well that&apos;s what we&apos;re paying for. Don&apos;t worry I&apos;ve got an idea. Waiter: Are you ready to order sir? Mr Smith: Not really. Could you recommend something. Waiter: Certainly sir. The fresh lobster is particularly good this evening, and for
 starters may I recommend a light consomme? Mr Smith: Sounds lovely, what do you think dear? Mrs Smith: Oh yes, I love lobster.
 Waiter: So, that&apos;s two consomme and two lobsters. Would you like to look at the
 wine menu? Mr Smith: Why don&apos;t you bring us what you think will go best. Nothing too expensive
 though. Waiter: No problem sir. I&apos;ll call you as soon as your table is ready.   The waiter walks away. Mrs Smith: You are clever Jack, but what about dessert. Mr Smith: Don&apos;t worry, they bring round a sweet trolley, so we just point at what we
 fancy! 

 A while later Mr&amp;Mrs Smith have 
 finished eating and are drinking their coffee. Waiter: Was everything to your satisfaction? Mr&amp;Mrs Smith Yes, lovely thank you. Mr Smith: The whole meal was delicious, our compliments to the chef. Unfortunately 
 we have to be back for the baby-sitter so could we pay now? Waiter: Certainly sir, I&apos;ll bring you the bill. Would you like me to order you 
 a taxi. Mr Smith: Yes that would be great, thank you. Mrs Smith: What a nice man, we must leave him a good tip. Mr Smith: Yes of course.
