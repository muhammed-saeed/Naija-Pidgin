 Farm Theft–Universal Tractor Key–vehicle security plant machinery agriculture dairy farming uk 
 
 

 
‘One key fits all’tractor policy blamed for countryside crime wave Last year, £1m of farm vehicles were stolen from South West Farms, according to the insurers’group, the National Plant&amp;Equipment Register (TER).“It’s extremely frustrating,”says Rob Canvin, who farms near Somerton, in Somerset, and has lost three vehicles in the last month.“If a member of the public had his Ferrari nicked, he’d be furious–but these vehicles cost more than that, and it’s really really annoying.”The extraordinary thing is, the manufacturers seem to make life easy for country crooks. When you buy any new car these days, alarms and immobilisers are standard. Yet on most tractors and farm vehicles, even a unique key is asking too much. Yes that’s right. All Massey Fergusson tractors have the same key , except the company’s 4400 series. All John Deeres have the same ignition key, as do JCB vehicles.“I’ve got a key in my pocket that will start every vehicle behind me,”claims Nick Mayell. Fortunately for West Country farmers, Mr Mayell is an investigator, not a thief. He is, in fact, the only full time investigator for the TER, based in Bath. He is, if you like,‘Nipper of the Farmyard’. He shows us how easily a big digger he’s recently recovered can be stolen. It is so simple, I’m not allowed to show TV viewers or this article will turn into a“how to steal a tractor”film. Most of the major manufacturers confirmed to us that universal keys have been their policy up to now, although …

 Question by J.B. Holiday : Did you know about‘Scammers’at the gas pump? 
Thieves Skim Credit Card Data At Fuel Pumps

Customers and police agencies across the USA are dealing with another pain at the pump–thieves who install hard-to-detect electronic devices at stations to steal credit and debit card data.

The skimmed data are used to create cards used at the victims’expense, says James Van Dyke, president and founder of Javelin Strategy and Research, a financial consulting firm that focuses on fraud and identity theft.

STORY: Meet A-Z, the computer hacker behind a cyber crime wave

http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/2008-08-04-hacker-cybercrime-zeus-identity-theft_N.htm

Investigations of theft related to skimming devices at gas pumps continue in California, Washington, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Delaware, according to various police departments.

Though the most recent cases don’t necessarily represent an epidemic, the Secret Service is investigating incidents across the country, says Ed Donovan, spokesman for the agency, which has financial and electronic crimes units.

Skimming devices have been used for several years, most often at ATMs. Thieves increasingly target pumps because it’s a cheap, easy way to steal credit and debit card information, Van Dyke says.

“Card fraud at gas pumps is a significant problem, and that’s because of the unintended nature of the checkout devices,”he says.“Essentially, every gas pump is an electronic cash register.”

The skimming devices can be installed outside or inside the pump. Thieves glue a plastic sleeve, equipped with covered wires that capture data, over the pump’s card reader or connect the device directly to the reader inside.

The devices are molded and painted to match the machine and are small, making them hard to detect, Van Dyke says.

Thanks for tips!
Yes i know it looks long but when I print it out is 2 pages long with the 2nd page only 1/3 the way down and I did use size 11 font thanks!

 Best answer: 

 Answer by garylee 
Your second one looks very good, however, you want to try and keep your resume to one page, if possible. Anything more than that is considered wordy. Remove unnecessay items, and try an 11 font if you need to.
