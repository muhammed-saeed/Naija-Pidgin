 Have You Cut the Financial Apron Strings? 
 by Heather Koerner on 06/11/2010 at 1:06 PM 
 
According to a recent Wall Street Journal article , chances are pretty good that you haven&apos;t.

The article cites a Charles Schwab survey of 1,000 parents of 23- to 28-year-olds. It found that 41% of these parents are providing some sort of financial support to an adult child, citing college debt and &quot;employment issues&quot; as the main reasons for their support. (Ah yes, college debt .)

But, the article states, &quot;the financial ties go beyond job issues and the now-familiar decision to move back home for a while.&quot;

Karen Blumenthal, the article&apos;s author, cites several areas where financial entanglements between twenty-somethings and their parents have increased in the past few years, and are likely to keep increasing:
 Health Insurance : Recently passed health-care legislation allows children to stay on the parents&apos; insurance plans until the age of 26. Pro: The cost of staying on Mom and Dad&apos;s plan may offer savings over an individual plan. Con: Ummm ... who pays? Credit cards : Other recent legislation requires credit card companies to require anyone under the age of 21 to prove their ability to repay (usually by proving an income) before issuing them a credit card. Pro: It just seems logical that a person should have an income before being allowed to borrow money. Con: Will college students continue on Mom and Dad&apos;s credit cards until 21 ... and beyond? Cellphones : Can you say &quot;family plan&quot;? The article states that &quot;According to a new T-Mobile survey, 73% of households with both family plans and children 22 or older still have an adult child on their plans.&quot; Can you say continued family financial entanglements? Housing : If a young adult does not have a credit card, sufficient credit record or sufficient income to satisfy a landlord, said landlord may require parents to &quot;guarantee&quot; a lease. 


But though these entanglements are becoming more common, they also may be stunting our financial maturity.

In their book, The Millionaire Next Door , Thomas Stanley and William Danko share their research on adult children who accept financial help from their parents. They point out four major concerns about such help:
 Giving precipitates more consumption than saving and investing. Gift receivers in general never fully distinguish between their wealth and the wealth of their gift-giving parents. Gift receivers are significantly more dependent on credit than are nonreceivers. Receivers of gifts invest much less money than do nonreceivers. 


What about you? Are you accepting financial help, or still financially intertwined, with your parents? Is the experience a good/bad/neutral one? Have you noticed (as per Stanley and Danko) that the help ends up encouraging some bad financial habits? Do you feel any pressure to cut those ties? Should you?

My parents fronted me the downpayment on my condominium.

However, it was very VERY clear that that assistance was a LOAN, not a gift. I have a graded payment plan based on my salary that will enable me to pay them back within three years of the loan date.

Speaking from the parent side of that equation, I&apos;m one of the 41%. My oldest son is 27, married, and on his own. However he did stay with us for several months during the breakup of his first marriage. We were glad to provide him a room and to have him around. As soon as he could he moved into a place with a friend. He was on our phone plan until recently, although he paid his own way.

My 23-year-old son is currently living with us, unemployed, and on our auto insurance and phone plan. He had a temp job until recently, and I can say unequivocally that he considered his income from that totally disposable for his own purposes.

We are seeing signs of maturity, but it is coming slowly. I truly wish that he could be on our health insurance, because he has none of his own, and if he were to get seriously ill it would devastate our finances.

I pray he is on his own feet soon. I love him and in general enjoy having him around, but he&apos;s not growing like this.

Wow. That hit close to home.

Yes, I&apos;m 25 and on my parents cell phone plan (it&apos;s $7/month, but those $7 come with a steep price of family money weirdness)

I&apos;ve been talking about&quot;someday&quot;getting my own plan, but I think this tips me over the edge. I need to do this now! Thanks for calling me out!

I guess I am financially intertwined with my parents due to the Family cell phone plan. I pay for my portion and never get the&quot;Oh, who is connected with this number?&quot;It&apos;s my only entanglement so I don&apos;t really see it as a problem . . . and it means that I only pay $16.50 per month.

My parents were really good about helping us become independent (we had to pay for car insurance and most of our college).

1. If the kid is paying their own part of the insurance premium, I don&apos;t see the problem with it.

2. The only way kids can get on their parents&apos;credit cards is if Mom and Dad make them an authorized user. This was true even before the requirement that people under 21 have to have an income.

(I didn&apos;t apply for a credit card till I was 23, on my own, and had an income, and was never on my parents&apos;cards.)

3. As long as the kid is paying a fair portion of the phone bill, this seems to be a smart way to save money. A family plan with 3 lines is cheaper than 3 separate lines, and it&apos;s costly and a hassle to change your phone number and billing plan just to say you&apos;re not on Mom and Dad&apos;s plan. Especially given that a lot of people don&apos;t have landlines anymore, it doesn&apos;t make sense in a lot of cases to split off phone service.

I also know of roommates who use the&quot;family plan&quot;and split the cell phone bill because it&apos;s cheaper than individual lines.

(I have a cell phone, no landline, but have an individual plan because I was living 800 miles from my folks when I got cell service.)

4. This has always been true. It&apos;s called co-signing a lease. If you can&apos;t provide the landlord with evidence that you&apos;re going to be able to make the rent (such as good credit, a record of steady income, and/or a sizeable unfront deposit), he or she is going to want someone to call when you&apos;re late with the rent.

As always, when putting any of these into practice, your mileage may vary.

I am 21, work part time and still live with my parents. I rely on them for food and shelter (I don’t pay them any rent), but I pay for all my own clothes, car insurance, health insurance, gas, car maintenance, doctor appointments, entertainment and some groceries. Basically the only things I get for free from my parents are things they are paying for anyway. Like food – my mom makes dinner every night anyway, I might as well eat with them. My parents pay the electric bill anyway; I might as well use their electricity.

I’m planning on getting married in a few months and then my future husband and I will be financially independent from our parents, except that we will live in a rental house his parents own for a few months – yay for free rent! His parents are planning to give us a large amount of money in the future when we decide to buy a house. Other than that, we don’t PLAN to depend on them financially. If we happen to hit hard times, there may be times when we’ll need a bit of help (hopefully not).

My boyfriend had planned to buy my engagement ring, but when his grandmother heard the amount of money he was planning to spend she decided the ring had to cost more than that (she’s big on jewelry), and offered to give us a large sum to buy the ring (thank you Popo!). My parents are paying for the wedding and it feels so weird. Yesterday we bought my gown and it was so strange to have my mom pay for clothes for me – she hasn’t paid for any of my clothes in about 5 years.

Anyway, I firmly believe once you’re married or living on your own you need to pay your own way. If your parents/relatives offer to pay for something special (like an engagement ring), there’s no need to turn them down. Be thankful for their kindness and generosity and strive to be able to do the same for your own children. But if you depend on them for everyday necessities, you’re still under their authority. That simply doesn’t work if you’re married. Sometimes parents who support their adult children feel they can still tell their kids what to do, which can cause all sorts of strife if you’re trying to “leave and cleave”.

Not sure if my experience is related to that of american young people - after all, things are different in Europe... But for what it&apos;s worth:

Health insurance: this is something that exist in my home country (Switzerland) for a very long time already. I and my siblings did use the&quot;family plan&quot;when it was less expensive than getting a student one (not always the case), but we paid for it as soon as we had an income. Don&apos;t see a problem there.

Credit cards: we never had a credit card in our hands before we could apply for it ourselves (and yes, banks there require an income proof). Just used debit cards and cash. If there was no cash available, then it meant no spending. In the few cases when we needed a credit card (online purchase, hostel booking), my parents did it with their card, and we repaid the money immediately.

Cell phones: we had cellphones before my parents did! In fact, my father still doesn&apos;t. We got it when we could pay for it...

Lease guarantee: same things happen on the other side of the Atlantic. But I think the problem is more: can you afford to pay the rent and do you fully intend to pay yourself, or are you counting on your parents to bail you out? The technicalities should not matter if you are mature enough to pay the expenses. And if your parents have good reasons to doubt it, they can always refuse to act as guarantee.

I was lucky enough not to have student debt (got scholarships and worked during my studies). I did not need to move back home due to employement issues, but one of my brothers did. I don&apos;t think it made him financially irresponsible.

From what I have seen around me, the issue is more tied to how the parents teach financial responsibilities than to anything else. But I have to say also that I&apos;ve been living in North America for the last 8 years and the culture shock related to the ease of credit and habits of spending here was quite something...

I’m curious to see how people respond to this post. I personally get pretty frustrated because I’m one of those Christian guys that have a good job (...house, 401K, all the boring stuff…) and have been financially independent for many years. However, “marry the guy with a great job” seems to have become such a taboo mentality in Christian circles. Now it’s more like, “marry the guy that plays guitar and has a ‘heart’ for missions” … and “God will provide no matter what.” Many Christian women in their mid-20’s buy into that mentality whole-heartedly, because mom and dad have always stepped in to provide the financial bailout. These people don’t usually really understand what it REALLY costs to run and support a household. It’s too bad.

Several generations ago, I think it was a lot easier to separate the boys from the men, because mom and dad let young couples face the world with less of a safety net. I think the way we do it now is a huge disservice and part of the reason we have so much trouble with men being immature, and women lost in some sort of gender-role limbo.

Financially intertwined . . . I guess you could say I am. My cell phone (which is also my only phone) is still on my parents plan. But, I pay them for my phone each month and they expect me to pay them by the due date of the bill each month, so the only difference is I&apos;m paying my parents, not the cell phone company.
Really, it&apos;s been a pretty neutral experience to do this. Not bad for sure. And my parents know it means that I phone them more often because their phone numbers don&apos;t use up minutes or cost me extra money to call.

My parents definitely helped me out when I was in college, but not always in the form of just giving me money for things. Sometimes they gave me the money as a gift but most the time they loaned me the money. They always made it clear that I was just borrowing the money and would be paying it back to them. Now, obviously, there is more flexibility in paying them back and the month that my car had major repairs I didn&apos;t have to pay them, but they do generally expect that I will pay them back, at minimum, the agreed upon amount each month until I have paid them back.

My husband and I are recently married and his parents are still paying for his school, but we pay all of our living expenses. He wouldn&apos;t be in school if they weren&apos;t paying for it, as his career field does not require a degree, but they desperately want him to get a degree, so they pay for it (almost as a bribe). I&apos;d actually rather he not be in school, but it works.

Well, seeing as how I am a 19 year old moving back home with my parents tonight... Yes. I&apos;m still financially dependent.

However, I&apos;m doing in my power to cut those ties as soon as I can.

In about a year, my younger sister will graduate and leave home, leaving my parents with an extra car.

I&apos;m working full time this summer, and I plan to save a good chunk of what I make in order to buy the car from them.

I know that they would just give it to me if I asked, but I&apos;d rather buy it - that way my pride is saved, and they have no collateral to hold against me.

Maybe that sounds bad, but I&apos;d rather pay than take my chances.

I&apos;m 29 and the financial apron strings have been cut for years. They might get retied a little bit though (cell phone). Switching to a family plan could save me about $40 a month. If that happens, I&apos;ll just cut my parents a check for six months or a year at a time to cover my portion.

I suppose Christmas gifts are mostly cash so I can shop for myself... I don&apos;t really consider that a financial apron string though.

My dad is a)wealthy b)shows loves through giving and providing. Therefore it&apos;s not a surprise that at age 27, even though I have a job that pays just enough, my cell phone and car insurance are still under his name and paid for by him, and he also owns the car I drive (I pay for all repairs/maintenance). In response to the above concerns:

1. I may be consuming a bit more, but a decent amount of each paycheck is still deposited to savings/retirement

2. This is probably true for me. Not necessarily due to the cell phone&amp;car, but because I still feel linked to my parents&apos;lifestyle in other ways. Example: I look at real estate ads for fun- and think&quot;hey, that price isn&apos;t bad!&quot;-compared to what my parents bought/sold for in their last move- but then I realize there would be no way I&apos;d be approved for that mortgage on my salary!

3. I have healthy credit card habits- put a few purchases on each month and always pay it off.

4.My dad made a lot of $ through investing, and has provided encouragement and teaching for me to invest wisely.

I go through phases of feeling guilty about this support. My general conclusion is that it&apos;s ok- for now. It&apos;s my dad&apos;s way of showing love, and I appreciate it but do not expect or feel entitled to it. In a way my dad rewards responsibility- my sister has made different choices than me (didn&apos;t finish college, is not on a career path), so she got booted off all the family plans because he did not want to enable her to be directionless.

However I do not want this support from my parents once I am married. I am not sure how that will go down...I think my dad may be a little hesitant at first, but will probably understand. Then he&apos;ll probably just find other ways to love me through giving...grandkids college fund?

22 and completely cut off from the family apron strings, although they occasionally give me money to afford to visit them. The only people I know who are still on their parents purse strings are either still in college (and while I was in university I depended on them for the first two years, and was independent for the last two, which occasional support in super tough times), or live at home.

I fall solidly into this category, but I have to disagree that sharing financial resources with your parents equals immaturity. In many cases, I think it&apos;s actually the wise decision.

My parents&apos;house is paid off, so letting me live with them while I work and attend grad school is a smart financial move for me. And because I help with many things around the house, it&apos;s a benefit for them, too.

We have the added bonus of more time together. Boundless talks a lot about mentoring, so let&apos;s not forget that parents can play a mentoring role for their adult children too. Living with my parents is a LOT more difficult than living with roommates. Parents challenge us in different ways than peers do, and I definitely need that kick-in-the-pants every now and then.

And I really believe that the Body of Christ needs to be interdependent. Yes, everyone should be financially responsible. But sharing our resources is biblical. Time, money, energy-- we all have those resources in differing amounts. Right now, I provide the time. My dad provides the money. Everyone benefits.

Put another way: if a family from my church said, hey, we have an extra room just sitting empty, and we&apos;d like to bless you with free rent this year. Come live with us. We&apos;re happy to share our home, food, utilities, with you in return for help with the house and your company. Most people would say that God has blessed you with a great gift through that family&apos;s generosity. Why is accepting my parents&apos;generosity any worse? Because it looks like I&apos;m taking advantage of them?

I&apos;m not trying to condone laziness. But I think it&apos;s sad when we insist on cutting ties so that we don&apos;t appear irresponsible. I know the time will come when I am more financially stable and when my parents will need support from me. Right now, God has gifted them to bless other people, and they&apos;ve chosen to bless me financially. I&apos;d be foolish not to gratefully accept.

My grandparents helped out when my parents needed money for various things throughout my childhood. And now it&apos;s my folks&apos;turn to help out me and my siblings. One day, I hope to do the same for my own adult children. My parents view this as a way of helping me stay out of debt. By loaning or giving me the money I need, which I repay in work done for them, I avoid debt and they avoid paying other people for work that I can do cheaply.

I guess I really don&apos;t see how this system is a bad thing. Can someone enlighten me?

People rag on us twenty-somethings for not cutting the apron strings, but there are some complex financial realities at work in most cases -- some that are our fault (too much college debt, over-consumption) and some that aren&apos;t (TERRIBLE job market, stagnation of wages), and I just can&apos;t get myself worked up or draw a bunch of dire conclusions about my generation&apos;s independence based on all that.

My whole family, including my brother and sister-in-law, are on the same family cell phone plan -- it&apos;s only $25/month for each additional line including unlimited talk and text, which is FAR less than if we were to try to do that individually. It&apos;s a frugal solution to an expensive problem. Same with car insurance -- my folks carry one umbrella policy for all our family cars and it costs much less money in total. Stewardship, right? ;)

Right now my sweet parents are covering my phone and car insurance because I have a dream job with a teeeeeny-tiny paycheck, and they&apos;re happy to help out for now, because they know it&apos;s temporary. That less than $100 per month right now is enabling me to fulfill a larger financial obligation with long-term benefits -- namely my mortgage. They consider it a good trade-off.

Had to move home for two yrs in my mid 20&apos;s due to losing a lot of my money from the company I worked for (it went under and the boss later convicted of fraud). I paid rent, and was never on my parents insurance or anything else. I was grateful for my parents help but it was a very low point in my life.

I fall into these categories in a few ways. I find this blog interesting, though, because I&apos;ve also seen articles encouraging parents to help out their young adults if they&apos;re able. One in particular was the Christianity Today article The Case for Early Marriage (I think that was the title...) Forgive me, because I don&apos;t remember exactly how it was said, but there was basically an argument for parents helping to support their children where needed so that marriage was indeed a feasible option for them earlier in life (as many of the arguments against early marriage have to do with financial stability). Not saying I agree or disagree, but just found it interesting.

To Jeremiah (from Denver):

I don&apos;t mean this in a smug and sarcastic way - maybe you should learn to play guitar...at the very least, you might find a new hobby.

You&apos;ve got a lot of good stuff going for you, so why not add something other than financial prowess to your arsenal? There&apos;s more to dating than flexing your financial muscles and the last thing you want is the kind of girl who just wants you for your money.

I get what this is pointing at - that you shouldn&apos;t go on and on into life dependent on your parents - but I just don&apos;t understand why that needs to be a rule. Who decides these things; that there&apos;s a magic age when you need financial independence? This idea just sounds new because the study is new! In generations past the family finances were generally entangled because everybody pitched in together on purpose. This is what God made family for!

Boundless did a whole article (or set of articles??) once talking about how the whole&quot;don&apos;t get married until you have enough money&quot;mindset was a fairly new creation and how it would be GOOD for parents to financially help their mature, adult children, even after marriage, in order to encourage young, healthy marriages. Then there&apos;s this post to guilt young adults into thinking that if they&apos;re still on mom and dad&apos;s cell phone plan they&apos;re immature. Still being on your parent&apos;s cell phone plan (or health care plan, or living at home, etc.) could mean that you&apos;re a good steward of your money. I actually know a young single woman who is trying to sell her condo and move back in with her parents - at 33 years old - so that she has more time and money to devote to ministry. I wouldn&apos;t want a post like this to discourage anyone in a similar position into thinking they&apos;re immature!

One of the strange, unseen perks about coming from a seriously dysfunctional family is that I wanted to get away from them so badly I&apos;ve never taken a single dime from them since I was 21 years old.

I&apos;m female and very tough. I take care of myself and have for a long time. I know how to be poor and live within my means and still manage to save; I&apos;ve been poor but rich in love and street smarts all my adult life. There&apos;s a lot of freedom in that. I know I could cleave to my husband should that man ever come along, but I know I&apos;m immune from the temptation of marrying someone so that I can be taken care of. I also know I&apos;m immune to making choices based on money instead of God&apos;s calling for my life.

I see a lot of comments on this blog that mention being financially independent EXCEPT for x, y, and z. That&apos;s not financially independent. Accepting help humbly and temporarily out of dire need is one thing. But the freedom that comes from being entirely on your own, leaning only on God for your provision. . .I wouldn&apos;t trade that for anything.

A few thoughts:

If we had affordable healthcare, young adults would be able to pay their own way.

What about when the roles begin to reverse? I put my parents on my cell plan (super cheap deal), so I could get them a cell phone. I did it to give ME some peace of mind.

My folks have kept me as a driver on their car insurance since I was a teenager because I drive it to help them with errands. We also have each others&apos;names on various credit cards and bank accounts to ensure that we have access to these accounts in case there&apos;s an emergency. I&apos;m single and they have health problems, so I felt it was best to intertwine our finances in case of an emergency. The passwords and account information are in a sealed envlelope in their safe (it&apos;s even fireproof!) and we have agreed to access them only if one of us is hospitalized (G_d forbid).

I don&apos;t consider this to be an issue of dependence as much as one of practicality. As our parents age it&apos;s important to be open about finances and legal matters before there&apos;s an emergency. A few years ago a friend&apos;s mother was seriously injured and it took weeks of threading through the legal system just to get access to her mother&apos;s checking account to pay the mortgage.

Maybe contingency planning is a good future post?

#15&quot;I guess I really don&apos;t see how this system is a bad thing. Can someone enlighten me?&quot;

I don&apos;t want to offend. …And I certainly don&apos;t know the particulars of your situation. However, when I hear of a 20-something woman living at home all the arguments she makes about being mature fall on deaf ears. The back of my mind is always worried, thinking about what this person expects in terms of lifestyle she is used to, compared with what I am able to deliver.

I personally left my parents home (for good) at age 19 and have paid all my bills since then. To be honest, some of the luxuries in life (like cable), I have opted to forgo… partly because of finances. A woman that lives at home can’t usually relate to that. 9 times out of 10, she just doesn’t get it! Every penny is hard to come by when you are totally responsible for yourself.

My last girlfriend was 24 and still lived at home… and there were a world of problems related to that fact. We just did not see eye to eye on things like money (how it should be spent/saved) and time (like why I couldn’t stay out on weeknights when I needed to work in the morning). One night, whgen we were on a date, my GF’s dad called me because I had kept her out too late - our conversation quickly turned into arguing. As somebody still under the authority of her father (at 24) my GF couldn’t understand why I was so upset. I couldn’t understand why a 24 year old would still want that for her life!! 24 and has a curfew!!! (Nothing wrong with a self-imposed curfew to stay out of trouble, but having your dad have to make a call to yell at your BF… just weird and creepy).

For me, never again. If you live at home, I assume you are a child.

I would agree with those who are thinking along the lines of the wisdom of sharing resources with their parents. I think there is a tendency by some to prove their independence by cutting themselves off prematurely, or on the other end of the spectrum, essentially leeching off their parents.

Sharing is good when it allows you to pay your share and save extra for big expenses like your own car, house, etc. I should qualify that married couples should cut the sharing ties with their parents. I think the independence is important when you are married though.

I am thankful that I had to work and pay for a lot of things growing up. Looking back, as child/teenager/young adult (now 23), I spent my money on a lot of silly things. I think now, what if I had saved it and used it for something worthwhile. But at least I am not learning that lesson now (or at least I am further down the road).

I also think that it is especially important for young men to learn good financial discipline. They are the one&apos;s called on to be the main financial provider for their family. Men tend to handle the family finances and it will likely make a big difference if he has good financial disciplines.

As a 24 year old recent college grad, I often feel misrepresented in these types of studies and articles. I have been paying my mom rent since I was 18, bought my own car, pay my own car insurance, gas money, clothes, cell phone (although I am on a family plan I pay my portion) miscellaneous items, entertainment and contribute to the food bill.

I am not some moocher who just works to fund weekend partying (what&apos;s that???). I haven&apos;t been able to find full time work in my field but I am working part time while searching for a full time job ANYWHERE.

I&apos;m not saying that this particular article is putting young people down for still living at home or being supported by their parents, but it&apos;s pretty frustrating to keep hearing about all this&quot;pressure&quot;to move out. I get along great with my mom and don&apos;t feel the NEED to move out now, although I would if I COULD, which I currently can&apos;t.

Yep. Dead right. I blame the parents. My folks made their expectations of me clear from the time I was 13 years old. When I was 18 and graduated high school, I was in college (and then onto a job or to graduate school), or I was working and either living on my own or paying them rent, or I was joining the military. Summers I was welcome at home as long as I was working a local job, and I took them up on that two of seven summers between college and law school, working at a local restaurant and then a local factory. People need to grow up.

Hmm. I am quite a bit financially intertwined with my family at 27. I did live on my own for three years, so it&apos;s not like I couldn&apos;t make it; I just prefer to be near my family. We do have a shared phone plan that I pay my portion of (and I feel I am being cheated because mine runs $36/month, much more than others have quoted.) I am still on my parent&apos;s car insurance, which I reimburse them for. My parents help me out in non-financial ways as well. But isn&apos;t that what family is for? Aren&apos;t we supposed to help one another and rely on each other? I do things for them too, like picking up groceries and printing things off the internet.

I do think that if I were male I would not want to be as entangled. I also think that if/when I get married, I would want to be more separate. Just my opinion, though.

Did I live at home in my 20s when I was going to grad school? yes....do I have daily contact with parents? yes....do my parents give me gifts and money every so often? yes...what has that done for me

1. Make me glad I belong to a wonderful culture that embraces family...go hispanics...we&apos;re different in our views of family and don&apos;t let anyone or any article tell you different

2. My parent&apos;s sacrificial giving has made me a sacrificial giver to the church, of my time, and to help out people in need....not to hoard or take for granted.

3. Now that I&apos;m in my 30s own my own home, and adopted on my own....I am proud to say I live within my means and don&apos;t carry a credit card.

So basically....parents helping out their children is not evil in the least....

as for poster #24....I&apos;m sorry you feel that women that live at home are beneath you, especially one that has a caring and protective father. My father would have kicked your rear end if you would have kept me out late....maybe this father just didn&apos;t like you...ever think of that? But the obvious disdain your post appears to have for him just solidifies that I&apos;m sure your ex-girlfriend is doing fine without a person willing to get in the way of her family and her. Sorry to be so harsh, your post just really rubbed me the wrong way...of course going back to my point #1, in a hispanic family....ALL the men would have gotton into an argument with you by that time!

I bought and insured my first car in grade 11, with no help from my parents. As soon as I graduated high school, I was responsible for my phone, school, shampoo, etc. If I wasn&apos;t in school, I would have paid rent to my parents. I think doing that has made it a smoother transition to living on my own. I feel I am very responsible with my meager income. I am glad my parents don&apos;t&quot;baby&quot;me when it comes to finances.

At first I read this and thought,&quot;Nope, I have no financial entanglements. I live in a different city, pay all my own bills, own my own car, etc.&quot;

But P&amp;P (#23) made a good point and that reminded me. My name is on my parents&apos;safety deposit box. I have my mom&apos;s name on one of my savings accounts. Both of these situations are to provide easier access if something happens in an emergency.

I am single, they are my beneficiaries, etc. Every so often (once a year or so) we have the discussion of the name of the lawyer, and who to contact for what, location of paperwork, in case one of us dies. We&apos;re very matter of fact about it. It just makes sense to have those discussions and having a few shared accounts makes sense, too.

I wrote a long comment explaining my personal situation but instead I&apos;m going to say this:

I don&apos;t think there is one hard and fast rule. We are all called to honour our parents and to be good stewards of our finances, including gifts that our parents may or may not choose to give us.

As young adults we need to walk the line carefully and be ready to refuse help when that&apos;s the appropriate thing to do. At other times, the best thing to do is to accept gifts gratefully and humbly and use them wisely.

@ Jeremiah (8)
I found your comment to be offensive, with regard to the comment about someone with a&apos;heart&apos;for missions. I hope to do missions long term, and have actively been working toward this goal for many years now. I do make a conscious decision to look for men with a&apos;heart&apos;for missions. I have also lived away from home for over six years, worked abroad (am about to again), finished university and currently manage the household of both myself and a sibling with special needs. I am very well aware of what is needed to run a household. By wanting to marry a man with a heart for missions as a higher priority than a stable income is a decision I made without checking my brains at the door, and one I stand by - it also doesn&apos;t mean that I don&apos;t take financial responsibility into consideration. Just because a girl is interested in something different to where you are going (which, by the way, sounds fantastic for most of my friends, just not me) does not mean that she is unaware of reality. I found your post to be very belittling.



I find this article interesting. I am 24. I work and am not reliant on my parents, although when I finished university they contributed to my savings. Ironically, due to an abroad hospitalisation, I had to lend my mother money last week (her insurance will only repay costs to here, not pay the fees whilst she is in hospital). Because I happen to care for a sibling with a disability, I get the car attached to them.

I am from New Zealand, so some things work a bit differently.

1. I do not have health insurance, as I live in a country with universal health care, so the most I will ever pay to see a doctor is $20US (approx), unless I choose to see a private one. A number of older (ie above 20s) people choose to have private health insurance so they can use the private system, and I was on my parents until I was 21. I cannot think of a single friend in my age bracket who has health insurance however, as the public system is more than sufficient.

2. I got my credit card, in my name with no security, at 21 - It is only for a small amount, and I am working to pay it back.

3. I haven&apos;t even heard of a family plan. My siblings and I are all on prepay phones, that we bought ourselves, and put the credit on ourselves.

4. My situation is odd at the moment, as my house is owned by the sibling I look after, and I pay board money to them (equal, if not slightly more than, what I would pay for a comparable room in a flat-share situation). In the past I have never had my parents co-sign a lease, but it is not common practice here anyway.

We do have&quot;safety net lending&quot;however, and this goes both ways (as stated above in my mother&apos;s case), and has always been paid back.

I&apos;m 41 and I&apos;ve been financially independent from my parents since around my 2nd year of college.

The problem is, from what I&apos;ve seen from friends and experienced from my in laws, he who pays the piper calls the tune. If you want to take money or other help from your parents you also have to follow their rules and allow a certain level of meddling in your life. This is a good thing if you have godly parents who are trying to help you stand up on your own two feet, and a very bad thing if you have ungodly, dysfunctional family relationships. Most people seem to want the financial help without the meddling.

If you are living off of mom and dad, and especially if you are married (or in a serious relationship), this can cause huge strain on the relationship between your spouse and your parents. Years ago, my in laws offered some help to my husband after he lost his job, but then acted as though they had bought so many minutes of complaint time to tell me all the things about me they didn&apos;t like (particularly me being a devoted Christian and a stay home mom). It continued until my mother in law&apos;s death a few months ago, though we&apos;d long since paid them back. I even think that accepting help that time lessened their openness to the gospel, because they brought it up every time we talked to them about the Lord.

Cut the apron strings now, because no one wants to have that kind of relationship with their in laws.

I have been actively searching for a job since Feb 2010.

Sure its great a large number of people here are able to take of themselves but alot of us have no choice but to depend on our parents.

I&apos;m 25 and am probably what others would class as&apos;financially dependent&apos;on my parents but, the same as every single person on this earth, am ultimately dependent on God for financial provision. And the ways in which he blesses and provides are as varied as the people he has created.
It seems that the general Christian view of&apos;God&apos;s provision&apos;is that it usually comes in the form of an anonymous cheque through the door, a deposit into a bank account from a fellow church member. I think we need to open our minds to what God&apos;s provision can and does look like.
I don&apos;t believe having money unexpectedly posted through my letterbox is any more holy or blessed than the money that my parents might give me as a gift. Both are a form of blessing, both undeserved and both point to the ultimate giver. Giving thanks and glory to God is a heart issue - it doesn&apos;t matter whether the money comes from my Dad or whether it appears miraculously in my bank the day before my rent is due, God is the same God and deserves the same thanks and praise however he provides.

Boundless is a big supporter of Mothers staying at home to raise, educate and train their children. Such a woman is fully reliant upon her husband&apos;s income enabling her to do her job. No shame there - it&apos;s a fact of life and a worthy calling.
How then, is it any different for a single 20-something woman? I have an incredible job that pays a pittance - I live out of home with some amazing girls and my father pays my rent (and I think the example is the same whether I live away or at home). By doing so he enables me to do a job that I wholeheartedly believe in, that I believe has eternal value, communicates something of who Jesus is and that touches and changes lives. Because I have been so blessed financially, I am able to give myself to this job in a way that would be impossible otherwise.

I experience God&apos;s incredible provision for me every single day through my father - I&apos;m no less thankful to God simply because it&apos;s conducted through my Dad. Some of us face the challenge of wondering where our next cheque will come from, some of us face the challenge of not putting our trust in wealth but our attitude should be the same, that ultimately we all rely on God to apportion resources. It is a question of an attitude of thankfulness and glory to the ultimate Giver, not how much we receive or how we receive it.

As an unmarried college student, my parents paid for my cell phone plan and my toiletries (though half the time I would just buy the toiletries myself). I was an authorized user on one of my parents&apos;credit cards so that I could shop for things they had agreed to cover and they would pay for them. I was on my parents&apos;health insurance, but the premium is paid by my dad&apos;s work.

At a later point, my then-fiance and I got on our own family plan so that he would be able to pay less money (he was formerly on his parents&apos;plan and paying a third of the total cost). We also got unlimited texting. My parents continued paying for my half of the base plan (not the texting).

When I was in a student apartment, I paid my part of the electricity, not my parents.

As a married college student, my husband and I pay for our own health insurance (about $250/mo but not a group plan and so does not include maternity), rent, electricity, cell phone, etc. If I could stay on my parents&apos;health insurance and be married I would have, because their health insurance was MUCH better than what we now have, but the insurance would not allow that. My husband was, in effect, given his car by his parents before we were engaged. We are on his parents&apos;auto insurance, but this is because it is WAY, WAY cheaper than having to be on our own plan and the car insurance allowed it!

We also became independent according to FAFSA. The only ways to be independent on FAFSA is to be over 25, have served in the military, or be married. (I think emancipated minors are also independent, but that&apos;s really hard to do.) Because we are independent, my husband can actually get the financial aid he needs to go to college!

I am VERY grateful that I was able to get credit cards before this new law about being 21 came into play. I actually have excellent credit, partly from being an authorized user on my parents&apos;card. My husband has been unable to get any sort of credit card, we think because he has no credit. He is an authorized user on one of mine, and we use it wisely. It is because of my credit that we were able to get on the electricity and phone plans we have without having to pay large deposits.

My only problem with adult children depending on parents is with situations like FAFSA, where there is NO WAY to be single, non-military, have a good relationship with your parents, and be independent if you are under 25. Those children don&apos;t even have the option of being independent, which I think is wrong.

Janelle {#15}, some interesting points were brought up by your post! I like to see the dialogue be intelligent.
Kind of along the same lines as what you said: My husband and I just got a loan of a few thousand from my dad when our car unexpectedly died and we had almost no money saved for another one. So obviously having a savings cushion is the number one important thing but after that all I can say is ... what a grace that God provided us a way to have an interest-free loan! You could be financially entangled with a bank or with your parent.... and since my dad is awesome I much prefer my dad!

One size doesn&apos;t fit all, I think.

Since everyone is detailing their own situations, here is mine:

When I was a teen, my parents expected me to learn financial responsibility, and I did, but along the way they helped me out two or three times when I accidentally went overdrawn in my bank account. The money was always a loan and I always paid it back.

When my Grandpa died, he left some money to my Mum with instructions that it was to be put towards my and my brother&apos;s education. My Mum used some of it to pay off my student loan from my first degree, which was only about £2000&apos;cause I&apos;d worked while studying and lived at home.

As soon as I was working full-time, I paid rent. I moved out and was completely independent for 2 years. Then I began my masters degree, and moved back home because I could no longer work full-time and afford to live by myself. This was planned. I work part-time and pay rent, but only enough to cover what I actually use. Now Ive finished my masters, I plan to move out when I again get a full-time job.

My Mum paid for my entire masters degree. By far, this is the biggest help she has given me financially. When my Dad died, she got a big insurance payout from his company, which meant she could afford to do it and offered to. I don&apos;t honestly know how I could have afforded it otherwise. It was a distant goal for me, which she was able to make into an immediate reality. I look at that as God&apos;s provision for something that was His will, and I&apos;m very very grateful for her help.

At 27, I&apos;d rather not be still living with my Mum. I want my own space, and I want to not be relying on her in lots of practical ways - however hard you try to foster an adult-adult dynamic, it is very difficult when you&apos;re used to a parent-child one. It&apos;s not ideal and it does destroy your independence to some degree. But it has been necessary to do my masters, and I think even working through those difficulties have probably done me a lot of good and been character building.

Re: #15 Janelle, interesting post. I think you bring up some good points!

Re: #24 Annon, #27 Craig
While it’s true that some people of adult age living w/their parents may be immature, there’s no way to make a blanket statement about it. You might as well say “If you don’t live at home, you are an adult.” Yet we all know that is not true either, as there are many individuals who do NOT live at home that are indeed very immature.

And in general, I think the whole “financial independence” thing for Christians has been negatively impacted by our American culture of independence. The New Testament church did not believe in financial independence. In fact, they believed in the opposite – sharing of everything you have, and considering your possessions not belonging to yourself but to everyone. And in order for the church to live that out, it must start in the home. So why everyone bashes on parents helping out their children is beyond me.

I’m not condoning laziness or immaturity – I do believe the onus is on the parents to teach their kids to be hardworking and mature. However, I believe we are far too quick to dismiss both the Biblical precedent as well as the practical wisdom to be gained from more intertwining of parents and children’s lives.

I think that the current job market and economy is going to affect how many young people are living with their parents. I have one more year of college left and my parents are funding my college, and I live at their house in the summers so I&apos;m obviously still holding onto the financial strings. Once I graduate, I will hopefully find a job and move out in due time. I feel that on Boundless it&apos;s always emphasized that independence isn&apos;t necessarily a Biblical idea, instead the idea that we have communities, family, and mentors help us move out on our own. Obviously I feel that financial maturity is extremely important, yet when you&apos;re in school and grad school until the age of around 24-25 it only makes sense that your parents support you in some way up until graduation. This isn&apos;t a new idea either, parents have historically always provided for their children to get their education. Once I have a degree that allows me to make a decent salary I will be on my own. But until then I don&apos;t see anything wrong with parents paying for their childrens&apos;education, health insurance, and providing a place for them to live. My parents have slowly since high school cut off what they pay for (clothes, car insurance,&quot;allowance&quot;) but education and a place to live have been gifted to me by them, and I hope I can do the same for my children one day.

My parents largely supported me throughout college, though for the last year or two I increasingly felt that I should be responsible for myself, and began to take on a few more small financial responsibilities. When I graduated I immediately moved in to my own apartment, not my parents&apos;house.

The only real financial entanglements that lasted after college were my cell phone and auto insurance, in both cases to avoid breaking contracts which would have been costly to break. Once those contracts were over I immediately switched to new services of my own.

Although I was motivated to be on my own financially I also have to say there was luck involved too. Many people who graduated when I did, many smarter than I, didn&apos;t find jobs for a very long time, but I did. If I hadn&apos;t been able to get a job immediately, I suppose I&apos;d have been asking for parental help.

I took a little longer than 4 years to graduate from college and while my parents didn&apos;t give me money they did allow me to live with them and stay on their insurance. Four years after graduating, I have my own family and while my parents like to give gifts to my child, they don&apos;t help us out financially.

Interestingly enough we have friends who could probably be the poster family for many of the ideals Boundless encourages among their readers. However, they are able to do this because they receive a fairly decent amount of money from their parents. They are the only single income family I know who does not struggle financially.

I&apos;m a 20 year old college student, getting married in 2 months, and my parents are definitely helping us out. My fiance and I attend a college where we work off our tuition. During the school year, we take 15-18 hours of classes and work 15 hours on campus. Basically, all of our time from 8-5, Monday-Friday, is accounted for by school obligations. When I lived on campus, my parents paid my room and board and gave me a small amount monthly for food, etc. They told me that they had saved up money to pay for my college tuition, and since I didn&apos;t have tuition, they were able to pay room and board, etc. This spring, my fiance and I started part time jobs. Now that it&apos;s summer, he works 40 hrs a week at his summer job (daycamp counselor), in addition to about 25 hours a week at his other job at a grocery store. My part time job is now a full-time job and I work 40 hours a week. Next summer, I&apos;ll work two jobs as well but we have some scholarship money coming this year as well as wedding money and we decided that I would work a little less and take time to plan the wedding. As for the money that my parents had been spending on my school expenses, they added everything up, divided it by 12, and give us that amount each month. Like I said before, they had planned on giving me that money while I was in school and they see no reason to just keep it now that I&apos;m married. They will also continue to pay my car insurance, health insurance, and cell phone bill, but only until I graduate from college. That&apos;s always been the plan and they saw no reason to change it.

I&apos;m very grateful for their support, because without it we would have a lot harder time starting out our married lives. Both of my grandparents were able to help my parents out when they first got married and they&apos;re just passing it along. My mom graduated with a lot of debt and they don&apos;t want the same for us. My fiance and I know that it is temporary and when we graduate, we&apos;re on our own. We&apos;re definitely not slacking off, but our situation makes it so difficult for us to earn enough money for everything. My parents see that, and they are willing to help.

I am kinda annoyed by Boundless attitude on this subject. Its perfectly A ok for them to promote wives deciding to never work again and demand the Man pay for The House, the Food, the Cars, The Insurance, the Doctors Visits, the clothes, and more. I mean if a sign of maturity means working and not relying on others then the wife should work just as much as the man, by boundless theory.

They act as if a Man might need help from his Parents he&apos;s immature and needs to just up and Say Dear God I know I have no work or money and have just graduated college thus have loans, medication, car stuff, clothes, food, a place to stay, and more I would have to pay for with zero income, but I know its immature and wrong of me to get help. Thus as a grown up I should just go live on the street and become bankrupt from not being able to pay loans and other bills I have that way I am at least not at home and thus being out of home means maturity.

Not to mention the other attitude they have for college students that during college they should be taking on the large majority of everything on their own as well. I am glad for those who can successfully work a 40 hour work week and still have time to take a full 5 course load and still manage to get A&apos;s or B&apos;s or even C&apos;s, but I couldn&apos;t get great grades while working more than 20 hrs if that a week and a lot of others cant either. Its unrealistic pressure on people to expect them to do everything at once(working a Full time Job and Going to School full time is not realistic for most people in most cases.)

as a Soon to be 25 year old Living at home. I hate it. I mean I love the space, but I hate being on my parents phone plan(but my phone broke a couple months ago and the only way to get me a new one was to renew my part of my families plan for another 2 years) I hate the fact that I have to rely on my parents for food and for shelter. I don&apos;t think its fair of me to ask hem to do such a thing this late, but guess what without work(which I am trying to get at the moment) and even with work when I get some work I have hundreds of dollars needed to repair my car to pass inspection next month, and a 300 dollar a month loan plan coming up its not like I can just up and say hey lets just say bye to the parents and I will be fine on my own. If I couldn&apos;t rely on their insurance to help me with my meds, I wouldn&apos;t be able to function in a way I could work successfully. If I couldn&apos;t rely on their car insurance right now I wouldn&apos;t be able to drive a car to look for work so I can eventually be out on my own. I wouldn&apos;t be able to afford to go to work when I got work for a while without that help. Sometimes that kinda help is needed to get people of the ground and going on their own.

This isn&apos;t like bible times when things weren&apos;t extremely expensive all around and people didn&apos;t have gazillions of bills then to pay in their 20&apos;s. Its awesome for people in Boundless who have established careers and finances to say oh they should just be able to do everything on their own without parents help without issue, because they aren&apos;t in the position we are in or even entering the job market when we are and I highly doubt when they were our age in our position they acted the way they try and pressure people into needing to act.

Hmmm.....

I&apos;d suggest that - while the OP has a point - it isn&apos;t a clear-cut issue.

My family were farmers, so I took the&quot;traditional&quot;route of the eldest son. I started working for wages, and paying my board and expenses. By my mid-twenties I had sufficient runs on the board to be given a full partnership in the family enterprise. In their later life, it was my work that paid all of their living costs. I was their retirement fund, and primary carer when my father became an invalid.

Family responsibilities do not just mean wife and children. Note that Christ was particularly critical of children who used a tradition to avoid taking financial responsibility for their parents. Mark 7:11

My experience is not a familiar one for the modern nuclear family, but it would have been very familiar to previous generations, especially before government pensions.

Completely independent (other side of the continent, even) in that parents are paying no ongoing expenses in any form for me, have been that way since half a dozen months after graduation from college. It would have been nearly impossible to be so earlier (well, nearly so: those months permitted me to take a much-needed seventh day, if you will, before starting work, after four years of the greatest stress I expect to ever face in life). Even with parents&apos;budgeting for future college costs, my college experience was particularly expensive -- much too expensive for me to have paid my own way through work while continuing full-time classes, especially not at my college.

I do have one financial obligation to them in the form of repayment for the loan implicit in my extra-expensive college. That plus a student loan (and whatever the outstanding balance is on credit cards, which I pay off promptly and in full every month) are the extent to which I&apos;m a slave to any lenders. I&apos;m extremely fortunate to be where I am now, and I believe this will make many future decisions with financial aspects much less complicated and worry-inducing.

Hey, Annon. Yelling at you is not good, but it&apos;s her father&apos;s job to take care of her no matter how long she&apos;s in his house.

If you knew she had a curfew, you were wrong to keep her out past that time. Period.

It isn&apos;t bad to receive money from your parents or from the government; it&apos;s bad when you refuse to take responsibility for what you can take responsibility for.

If my parents hadn&apos;t given me some money, I wouldn&apos;t be able to live by myself and take responsibility for my own well-being. Thus, giving sometimes actually enables responsibility rather than diminishing it. That seems to be true of many of the people who commented here.

Also, financial independence is an illusion; we get everything we have from God. We don&apos;t really earn it. God gives us jobs and the ability and skill to work, and He provides the income. We are managers, not owners of wealth.

Also, Jonathan (#41) seems to have hit the nail on the head. Christianity is about sharing, and not independence.

My parents give me money. They make the argument that they would rather share their wealth now while they are alive and see the fruits of it rather than give away a large inheritance after they are dead and never have the chance to see what good their money can accomplish.

I think I have missed the articles where Boundless advocates:
 &quot;wives deciding to never work again and demand the Man pay for&quot;everything that readers&quot;just go live on the street and become bankrupt&quot; and&quot;college students that during college they should be taking on the large majority of everything on their own as well.&quot; 


Could you provide links to those so I can check them out?

This post seems rather...out of context at Boundless, given past articles to the effect of&quot;live at home, save money, bond with your family, prevent temptation&quot;and&quot;women should never buy their own homes&quot;and&quot;parents should provide their offspring with financial help in order to marry young.&quot;It&apos;s a breath of fresh air to see Boundless encouraging some personal responsibility among young people (young women included, I presume?)

My parents began teaching me to be independent when I was a little kid. They gave me a (small) allowance, and I was forced to make choices. Not for my needs, obviously, but for things that I wanted.

They never paid for my cell phone because I was in and out of college before cell phones were widely accessible. My first plan had 40 minutes/month. Remember those days?!

I lived with them for a few years after I completed college, but I paid rent to them and was respectful of their rules. Not saying we didn&apos;t butt heads every once in a while, but it was their house.

Now they ask me if I want help. It&apos;s kind of a running joke. They brought me and my siblings up to be independent, and they&apos;re upset that it worked :)

I&apos;ve considered getting a family cell phone plan with my mother. My dad&apos;s phone is a company phone. I think my mom and I could save some money by having a plan together, but we both understand that we would be equally financially responsible for it.

27yearold single woman.

Health Insurance - Pay for myself. Provided by my job. Though honestly, I&apos;m never sick so the only thing I use it for is immunizations when I leave the country. :)

Credit Cards - My dad is still listed on my first (and primary credit card), but he hasn&apos;t looked at the statements in the 9 years that I&apos;ve had it. Every so often, one of us remembers that we should probably take his name off of the credit card but have never got around to actually doing it. Since I use it + pay it off, it hasn&apos;t mattered.

Cell Phones - My cell phone is paid for by the family business. I work part-time for their construction company, and so it works. I wouldn&apos;t consider it being dependent on my parents though, since I am providing them with necessary services for the business.

Housing - Lived on my own for 3 years. Lived with my parents for 4 years (they refused rent money, telling me to put it in savings). As a result, my car is paid off and I have owned my own house for the last year and a half.

Conclusion: I am financially independent. I never solicit my parents&apos;financial help. They are often willing to help with home projects, and paid for a door&amp;window installation as my last birthday present.. which I appreciated greatly. :) But I would never depend on them for my finances. I take responsibility for where I am financially, and pay my own bills and my own debts. It&apos;s my business and my life and though I often go to my dad for financial advice, he has never had to&quot;bail me out&quot;of a financial tough spot.

As a 33.8333 year old single female, I&apos;ve been&quot;financially independent&quot;for a few years. I rent my own apartment, and paid for my car (which is fully paid off now...and early!), all with my own money.

I do admit that the one financial&quot;help&quot;I get from my mother and stepdad is when I visit their home, I get to wash laundry for free (though I often mow their lawn or do other help around the house).

I do have a suggestion for Boundless , though: what to do when the situation is reversed: when parents rely on their (grown-up) children because of financial difficulties. You have no idea how close to home this hits (and not with parental units mentioned above, to clarify).

1. I see articles and Posts consistently trying to pressure women into believing they need to be stay at home moms, that its the only really healthy way to go about it and that women should be prepared to live off of just one income for at least 18 years, which is a large chuck of life and when you have kids staying at home relying on one income is asking the Man to basically pay for everything in a time where there will be more bills than any other time in life. maybe not telling women to rely on men forever, but at least when a second income is actually more logical than not.

I consistently see articles and Podcasts that state to stay at home or rely on your parents into your 20&apos;s makes you a bad steward and immature and thus promote the idea that people need to just get out of that house even if maybe the circumstances just dont allow for it, even when its not a matter of maturity.

I see abundance of articles and podcasts which talk about as how once you enter college or your early 20&apos;s its wrong and immature to rely on your parents and thus should be taking on the large number of your responsibilities.

Independent. I was paying for my own apartment, cell, car, ins etc. since I was 20. At 25 I understand the issue of living with parent&apos;s is cheaper, but it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a great idea in all situations. I guess I am sick of people classifying our generation as being lazy people who live off their parents. Yes the new laws aren&apos;t going to encouraging financial independents, but parent&apos;s can encourage it and we can learn to cut the apron strings ourselves.

I&apos;m 22, married to a 24yo; he has a fulltime permanent job, I have a fulltime contract.

We are, for the most part, completely financially independent of our parents. There have been some instances where our parents have paid for stuff. Last year we went on a holiday with my parents, and my parents offered to pay for our accommodation on the trip. Just before we got married, my mother-in-law entered a competition to win a $3000 furniture gift certificate. She was very dubious of her chances of winning, and said&quot;if I win this, I&apos;ll give it to Leah&amp;(husband)!&quot;She did win it, and sure enough she gave it to us. It bought us our bed, washing machine, lounge suite and fridge. But these were one-off gifts and not a continual dependence on them.

My husband was also on his parents&apos;auto insurance until shortly after we got married. (I was 20 and he was 22 when we married). He paid for his share, but it was all the one account under his parents&apos;name. He changed this soon after we married though (and the insurance we ended up getting was cheaper than what he&apos;d been paying previously anyway!)

I have no idea if I&apos;m still on my parents&apos;private health care. I possibly am, but I&apos;ve never used it.

MizattA - wow, chill. Do you think we all live back in bible times and you&apos;re the one sole boundless reader who lives in the real world? Link me to some articles that say women aren&apos;t allowed to work and have to rely on their husbands for everything. Link me to articles that say people have to be totally financially independent despite any out-of-the-ordinary circumstances. (ESPECIALLY college students!) You can&apos;t, because there are no such articles.

Nowhere does Boundless say women should not work and have to rely on their husbands for everything.
Instead, it advocates they work and save wisely so that once they become mothers they&apos;re able to stay home with their children.

Nowhere does Boundless say it&apos;s bad for someone with adverse health problems, or who simply CANNOT get a job, to get some help from parents.
Instead, it says that, as far as it&apos;s within your control, you should aim to be financially independent as a college graduate with a job. (It certainly doesn&apos;t suggest college students have to be financially independent and work fulltime jobs).

Also, Boundless has been quite accepting of the idea of Mums going back to work when their kids are school aged, or working from home. What do you think Heather Koerner and Candice Watters are doing? Do you think they write Boundless articles for fun, or their kids are all over the age of 18? Nope, that&apos;s their job, and their kids are still young.

You also say&quot;I see abundance of articles and podcasts which talk about as how once you enter college or your early 20&apos;s its wrong and immature to rely on your parents&quot;. Nope, again. They suggest once you finish college and get a job you should be&quot;cutting the financial apron strings&quot;, not necessarily during college.

I was at university from the age of 17 to 19 and lived at home with my parents, without a job. I lived at home a further 6 months after graduating (again without a job, though I do believe I should have tried harder to get a job then) til I got married at 20. For the two years I&apos;ve been married, I&apos;ve worked several contracts, adding up to a total of about a year, and intend to keep working til I have kids.

And in no way have I ever felt like Boundless is criticising what I&apos;ve done.

You have taken a few little tidbits and completely twisted them, blowing them out of proportion to say things they never said in the first place. You sound very defensive because you think they are criticising you for the position you&apos;re in.

theoneandonly (37) said:&quot;I think we need to open our minds to what God&apos;s provision can and does look like.&quot;I actually had to learn that because of my parents. Last summer I had lost my main job and was making very little in the one part-time job I had. I looked long and hard for a job, and my parents and some other extended family members helped me out a great deal, especially in regards to paying my rent. My parents have asked me several times to move back home with them, especially when I had to leave school suddenly and didn&apos;t have a place to live. I always said no, because it was very important for me to be an independent adult. My parents are very much enablers, and I can see it in my younger brother and sister. However, when I was broke and trusting God to provide, I prayed often that he&apos;d help me accept that maybe he was providing for me through my parents. I was thrilled when I got a full-time job and no longer needed my parents&apos;assistance, especially because it did cause some tensions between my dad and I. My dad offered to help me out for a few months so I could afford to get on my company&apos;s insurance plan. I refused, because I knew that I wouldn&apos;t be able to sustain the payments after he didn&apos;t want to help out anymore, and I didn&apos;t want to be dependent on that. It turned out to be a great move, because I got laid off and never would have used the insurance anyway.

My dad gives me money to show he cares. I hate that, because I feel really guilty taking money from him when money is tight for my parents. I try to pick my battles carefully, because I really do think he would be really hurt if I refused help when he offered, especially when I&apos;m obviously in need. I&apos;ve made offers in the past to pay for my part of the family cell plan, but he always said it wasn&apos;t a problem. I see my family&apos;s help as a blessing, and I try to honor that by not abusing their generosity.

Hannah C.O. (38) mentioned FAFSA. I can&apos;t tell you how frustrating it was, year after year, to fill out my parents&apos;tax information and get back and expected family contribution. It was always for thousands of dollars, and while my parents would help me out every now and then with incidentals while I was in school, I was responsible for covering my tuition, room, board, and parking permit. If only I could have gotten Financial Aid based on my actual income instead of assuming that my parents were able to help me out according to a government determined portion of their income.

I&apos;m 24, and I live four hours away from my parents. I love where I live, I love the church I attend, and I love having friends live nearby. But I just got laid off from my job, and I&apos;m really struggling with how I&apos;m going to pay the bills. I wasn&apos;t able to finish college, my job skills are limited, and so many jobs require a lot of experience and/or training, so it&apos;s hard to even get my foot in the door at a lot of places. I desperately want to be able to continue to live on my own, because I don&apos;t want to uproot my life and move in with my parents. I&apos;ve accepted, though, that it would be more financially responsible to move in with my parents than to ask them for financial help if I can&apos;t find a job relatively soon. Dealing with finances, especially given the current job market, is a tricky things. It&apos;s not at all cut-and-dried, one-size-fits-all. I&apos;m glad to see many readers accepting the financial blessings their parents offer.

Pray tell how I am to be financially independent unemployed? I would happily move out and ditch my parents for the emotionally- and psychologically-abusive terrors they are, but I can&apos;t. As is, by this September, my bank account will be totally empty, paying my student loans, which they never cosigned on. I will be uninsured, in debt, and with my credit rating trashed, yet by this article&apos;s ideals, I&apos;m a leech, a mooch, a&quot;gift-getter,&quot;and etc. All my parents provide is food and a house. I&apos;m 25 and still waiting for this economy to permit me to get my life started, and I do not appreciate article that make it sound like I&apos;m the problem here. Normally I love Boundless, but this article missed the target. Big time.

Ahhh. This is a touchy subject with me...

Female, mid-twenties. I actually was ‘forced’ to move back home. (Long story… short version: I don’t have their blessing to live on my own until I’m married.) Since this was mandated to me I refuse to pay rent, but I do clean the entire house weekly&amp;at times do their laundry, ironing, etc. I also take part in the meal prep, cooking, clean-up portion of household duties. I am on a family plan, but pay my parents each month. I also pay for car insurance, repairs, gas, etc. Currently, I have zero health insurance, but I’m expected to pay for any medical bills. So, beyond room/board I pay for it all…and the ‘free’ rent comes at a HIGH price.

My parents will loan me $$$ for financial emergencies, as needed. But, it is ALWAYS expected that I pay them back.

My situation is very complicated, and I wouldn’t say that I’m financially independent, but that’s not by choice.

Wow. I am appalled by some of the responses here.

In the interest of full disclosure: Same as 1 above, so yes, my parents do still have at least one significant financial tie on me. I&apos;m also on the family cell phone plan, but as someone above mentioned it&apos;s for cost-savings purposes only. I was on my own plan prior to my parents deciding that it was more cost-effective for us to get a plan together and me to pay them monthly instead of AT&amp;T.

That being said, I have to say that I am SHOCKED by the number of people justifying living off of their parents income -- and the total lack of preparation for the rest of their lives I see out of so much of my generation.

Seriously? Is it more cost effective for you to keep riding Mom and Dad&apos;s gravy train? Sure! Is it responsible of you at 25, 26, 27 to continue to place the burden on them for your continued upkeep and wellbeing?

Definitely not!

Now, I&apos;m not saying that your Mom and Dad don&apos;t recieve a few perks from having you around the house (after all, they can still send you out to the curb with the trash or have you mow the lawn) but if you really wanted to serve your parents, if that was really your heart here, you could do that kind of stuff while NOT LIVING AT THEIR EXPENSE AT HOME.

Lest you think that I&apos;m coming at this from an unbalanced perspective, My adult sister does still live with my mom and dad, and my boyfriend still lives with his parents. I love them both, very very dearly, but I still think, in spite of the financial benefits, it&apos;s a bad choice for each of them (and the only reason it&apos;s really still acceptable for either of them is because my sister&apos;s boyfriend and I have both been responsible adults. Regardless of what she and he do for the next few years, once proposals start flying, us two responsible folks will have homes, cars and an established way of living that will allow us to continue as adults.)

The flip side of staying at home is that a lot of you are NOT learning how to budget. Even if most of your cash is being set aside as tuition, You&apos;re probably still spending way too much on entertainment, and not setting enough of your disposable income aside for practical things. Mom and Dad pay for insurance, housing, even food, so you don&apos;t have to factor that into your budget. You go out and do stuff with your friends, you buy fancy new toys and you don&apos;t have to worry about your electricity, your water bill or your mortgage.

You think that some kind of responsibility light bulb is going to click on after you get married and you need to seriously consider those things? You think you&apos;re not going to experience growing pains when you realize that you can no longer live in the lifestyle you&apos;ve grown accustomed to because a movie every weekend would mean no running water?

And Men, you think it&apos;s not going to be humbling when you go out and date after date your lady-friend is picking up the tab? You think you&apos;re not going to have to have a deep discussion about never, ever resenting that she has made wiser financial choices than you? You think that being in that relationship is not going to make you question your ability to provide for her? You think that&apos;s not going to make your (already challenging) early years together rockier than they need to be?

Are there exceptions? Sure. There are always exceptions. If your parents require extensive hands-on in-home care and you are their primary caretaker, I applaud your act of selfless service. If you have part-ownership in an agriculture based family business, I get that. If you are actively pursuing full time employment and leaving the nest but are (legitimately!) hindered by the current economy, I understand. But you should be grinding your gears to GET OUT of there. Not hunkering down and prepping to camp out, while you justify your laziness away.

The honest truth is that so much of our generation is hung up on NOT GROWING UP. And there are so, so many people that will let folks get away with it.

If working a full time job and going to school full time is not&quot;practical&quot;for you, you need to seriously reconsider your life. I worked two jobs while I completed a Master&apos;s Degree. My Dad hauled concrete 60 hours a week while he earned an engineering degree. Times were different? Maybe. But probably not so much. I think the main difference is that our generation is spoiled beyond belief. We&quot;deserve&quot;to have a nice house with pottery barn furniture, instead of mom&apos;s second hand sofa, and eat at Chipotle and not top ramen.

It&apos;s part of the reason that proposals for student loan forgiveness chap my hide. I worked hard, I went without, I did what I could so that I could afford school (and I went to a school that I could afford not a fancy-pants one with a shiny name and prestine campus), so that I didn&apos;t have to rely on my parents to bail me out of my financial snafus and so that I never had to touch a single dollar of student loans. But here&apos;s what slays me: On various occasions I cut checks to girls that couldn&apos;t afford their summer rent, or their rent over Christmas break (not small amounts for a college student working two jobs). Then I watched those same girls go out and blow enormous wads of cash eating out, or on a new computer - making me feel like I personally financed their bad decision making. They never, ever learned to be responsible. I would have been better off writing my check directly to their apartment complex. Government financed student loans/grants basically force me to do the same thing.

There is NO voice of reason taking my generation to task for their rediculous, frivolous irresponsibility. And if you&apos;re living at home, not paying rent, not actively seeking ANY kind of of employement - i.e. not just jobs in your field, but also jobs that are&quot;beneath you&quot;. You ARE behaving in a rediculous, irresponsible manner no matter your justification. It&apos;s annoying. Stop it. Be a productive member of society.

Sure, Christianity is all about sharing and there&apos;s no need to be a cowboy, but even Paul said&quot;If you don&apos;t work, you don&apos;t eat.&quot;(2 Thessalonians 3:10)

I see a lot of folks in my generation eating and not working. Grow up.

#62 Ashley. Thank you!!! Your comments are spot on.

Like you, I realize there are exceptions (…taking care of sick parent, prolonged unemployment, etc.) However, so many people on Boundless seem to be making these ridiculous excuses as to why they HAVE to live at home with their parents.

Yes, I’m a little bit older than the average reader here… At 32, I arguably did graduate college into a somewhat better job market.

The point is though, that living on your own in your 20’s doesn’t have to be expensive. Just get out there and do it!

My first job out of school I took home about $400/week (about $20K / yr). Living in SoCal at the time, that was NOT a lot of money. However, I don’t remember having a problem… I shared an apartment with roommates, drove a paid-for older car, had yard sale furniture, didn&apos;t eat out much, carried bare minimum for insurance&amp;cell phone.

I can’t understand why all these parents continue to enable their adult children to remain as dependents. For those singles on here that are advocating (so strongly) that living at home is OK, how do you expect to cleave to a spouse when you are still cleaving to your folks?

I think the article is funny, because the person&apos;s who are our bosses is someone else&apos;s parent, who might be our age. Alot of the issue is that we are not guaranteed a job, let alone a good one like in the past. We have excessive dept, prices in general are higher due to inflation, and the wages and benefits we get have not kept up with costs.

You can&apos;t as a business owner or manager get mad at your kids for the horrible world you left them. I wanted to be out of the house at 18. I went to a school nearbye and lived at home. The job market in NYC has sucked for 10 years now, and its getting even worse. Plus we are paying high taxes and social security which we will never benefit from. Our parents alos get tax right offs for us living with them.

Ashley,

Pretty much every other post you&apos;ve written so far has made me want to literally give you a high five (yes really!), but I thought this one was quite harsh. I&apos;m a little confused though&apos;cause all the way through I thought you were talking about ALL young adults who live with their parents, but then at the end you said&apos;living at home, not paying rent&apos;- so could you clarify, are you just targeting people who don&apos;t pay their way? I&apos;d be with you on that (minus from the exceptions you noted).

Only one other thing - about working full-time while studying full-time. I realise lots of people do this and lots of people manage it, but I&apos;m really not convinced it&apos;s a wise choice. Some people who aren&apos;t used to having to worry about their health are be very cavalier about things like that, but it simply isn&apos;t good for us to drive our bodies to the absolute limit.

And m -- if you&apos;re in your mid-20&apos;s, you don&apos;t need your parents&apos;&quot;blessing&quot;to live on your own. You&apos;re an adult and you should insist on being treated as one. Respect is in the manner you convey that insistence, not in the content.

@Jeremiah #8

I&apos;m not sure, but I might disagree with you here. I&apos;ve been on my own for ten years (since I was 19), I&apos;ve paid for my own car, car insurance, cell phone (not on a family plan), rent, bills, school and school loans, medical expenses (I don&apos;t have health insurance), and travel. I cannot remember a time in my life when my parents bailed me out financially. Even when I was younger, we had to front the money for anything over basic life necessities.

It wasn&apos;t that my parents were stingy or even poor, it was that my parents knew that there was value in training us to be responsible and good stewards.

However, along with that training, they also trained us to value things that money couldn&apos;t buy. A 401K and 60K a year weren&apos;t good motivators for us growing up, and they aren&apos;t good motivators for us now. All of my adult siblings and I have pursued jobs that pay little, but are rewarding in other ways (and still all paying our own bills).

I&apos;m just saying that as a single woman having spent ten years paying the bills (and besides 15K in school loans, not in any debt), I&apos;m not any more inclined to marry a man with financial stability than I am to marry someone with only a guitar and a&quot;heart for the Lord.&quot;Neither are deal-breakers, but neither are also prerequisites.

Honestly, I believe that the issue of whether living at home is responsible or irresponsible financially is one that varies by situation.

Sometimes, while looking for work or starting at the low-paying end of the career ladder living at home may be the most financially responsible thing to do. As long as, in some way, you are contributing to the cost of living at home (ie. paying rent that is comparable to your income or assisting with things your parents would otherwise be hiring people to do), I don&apos;t think living at home is a problem. If you are not contributing to the household and you are just spending all your money on entertainment, then I would say that yes, living at home is financially irresponsible and you should be moving out.

Sometimes, especially in this economy, it may be difficult to get started and you may not have much money. Living at home may then be the most financially responsible thing to do, but you should be contributing in some way to your parents household (paying what you can or looking after yardwork/housework for them) and your entertainment costs should still be covered by you.

Jeremiah #8,

I wonder if dating preferences have changed.

When I was single, girls generally WANTED guys with a good job, house, car etc. I wasn’t taken seriously as mate material until I had at least 2 out of the 3.

Experienced at least one strange irony of dating life. One gf dumped me because she wanted to go to a mission field, and I did not. Profound.

Heather,

Although some singles may live with parents for all sorts of reasons, I do think it is possible for singles to show more independence than some report here.

Examples that come to mind include paying rent to your parents, saving to buy a car, and learning to budget for everyday expenses.

Danielle (#26) expressed this well.

MizattA #46 and #56,

I think I can appreciate where you are coming from.

Men are told they need to be responsible, get a good job, plan wisely, get marketable skills, invest in a career, save their money, be involved at church, participate in ministry, be of good character, set a good example and so on.

As a young single man, I was told women can fall pregnant at any time (despite family planning), and should ideally stay at home with the child at least until school. Factor in multiple children and those years at home (as a dependant) blow out quite a ways.

Then, knowing that women initiate the majority of divorces, and seeing a number of christians separate and divorce, no wonder I was scared witless!

I entered the job market at the tail end of a recession and it took four years to get more than temporary/contract work. Some people understood that finding a decent job was difficult. Some did not.

Jo,
 Pretty much every other post you&apos;ve written so far has made me want to literally give you a high five (yes really!), but I thought this one was quite harsh. I&apos;m a little confused though&apos;cause all the way through I thought you were talking about ALL young adults who live with their parents, but then at the end you said&apos;living at home, not paying rent&apos;- so could you clarify, are you just targeting people who don&apos;t pay their way? 
I admit that my tone was harsher than usual here :/ Yes, I&apos;m talking about people that are living at home, on Mom and Dad&apos;s dime, that aren&apos;t paying their way and aren&apos;t learning about how the real world works because their parents are artificially insulating them from their self-destructive decisions.

I think the reason I came off so harshly in this post is because I&apos;m tired of seeing my generation self-destruct from lack of responsibility. Most other areas, a well reasoned argument can sway folks over to the logical (dark? ;)) side, but in this instance, if you&apos;re not going to step up, suck it up, and take responsibility for your actions, no amount of logic or kind, prodding words are going to move you.

I have nothing against charity. I think it&apos;s a fabulous and biblical thing to care for the poor, the downtrodden and the needy, but I DO have a problem with people abusing charity. Gone are the days when folks were too proud and stubborn to take a handout, and they&apos;d sooner starve than be reliant on someone else. Our generation only knows how to say&quot;Gimmie more, faster, better, cheaper&quot;and it&apos;s making us lazy, obese and self-impressed.

The honest truth is that we&apos;re living in the middle of a recession. Finding work is hard. Dear friends of mine have been forced into sub-par housing situations because of it. I understand, there are harsh realities out there.

However, if one of my friends can work to pay off student debt living two and a half hours away from Mom and Dad on McDonald&apos;s wages -- you can too. It might not be pretty, you might have to resort to some interesting ways to get nutrients, or you might have to make some friends that will occasionally gift you a home cooked meal, but you can do it.

The general consensus of our generation is that such menial labor for such meager pay is&quot;beneath&quot;them. They don&apos;t want a job they can have, they want a&quot;decent&quot;job. And they&apos;re not willing to settle for less than their dream.

Folks don&apos;t want to get by, they want to live according to the same standard as Mom and Dad, without realizing that it took them 40 years to get to the place they are now. I remember when our family rule for eating at a fast food restaurant (three of us) was that all together the cost had to be under $5.00. Now we can eat at the Cheesecake Factory just because. But that&apos;s because my Dad worked HARD, made wise choices and behaved as a responsible, wise steward with what he was given.

I hear you on the health concerns, but so many of the same kids that would argue that&quot;working and going to school is too hard!&quot;are spending just as much time not-sleeping as those who are working two jobs (that was certainly my college experience!). There are, of course, exceptions, but they&apos;re few and far between. The health concerns associated with being a college student are much more tied to partying and late-night video game fests than they are studying too much or working too hard.

To the girl who feels like&quot;living at home&quot;is being dictated to her:

Disagreeing with your parents is hard, because they represent God-appointed authority over your life, but ultimately, you will not have to answer to them - you will have to answer to God for your actions. Your parents might be overprotective. They might cling to you and not want you to leave. You might feel like you&apos;re dishonoring them by not staying -- but you may be wrong. If living at home is causing greater stress than moving out, If you are able-bodied and capable of working to support yourself, then I would pray hard to seek God&apos;s will in that area.

My mother didn&apos;t speak to me for six months after I left the family home, mostly because she felt I should stay there until I married. I honored her by listening to her reasoning, politely defending my position, and respecting her silence, and reiterating my love and respect for her. It was hard. It was really, really hard. I cried a lot. But I learned to make my way on my own. I learned to be responsible for my own upkeep and well being and not to rely on my parents or the charity of others. It was a valuable lesson. And in time, the Lord worked in my Mom&apos;s heart and showed her that my decision, although not in allignment with her will for my life, was ultimately wise. You can honor your parents without letting them and their approval become idols you live your life by. Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.
