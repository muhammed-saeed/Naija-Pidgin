 Of course, a lot of people would say &quot;just avoid fast food altogether!&quot; But sometimes you just need a Wendy&apos;s double cheeseburger and fries.

The folks over at A Calorie Counter have looked at the nutritional info for all of the fast food outlets (McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, KFC, A&amp;W, Arby&apos;s, Hardee&apos;s, In-N-Out Burger, Jack in the Box, Little Caesars, Papa John&apos;s, Pizza Hut, Domino&apos;s, Sonic, Subway, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s, White Castle, Popeyes, Del Taco, Carl&apos;s Jr., and Dairy Queen) and have compiled a list of the 88 worst foods you can buy, in terms of the amount of trans fats. After the jump, the 10 worst. The link above gives you the whole list.


 
1. White Castle Homestyle Onion Rings (sack): 30 grams
2. White Castle Fish Nibblers: 16 grams
3. KFC Chicken Pot Pie: 14 grams
4. Burger King Hash Browns (large): 13 grams
5. White Castle Chicken Rings (20 rings): 13 grams
6. Jack in the Box Fish&amp;Chips (large): 12 grams
7. Jack in the Box Bacon Cheddar Potato Wedges: 12 grams
8. White Castle Clam Strips (sack): 12 grams
9. Dairy Queen Chicken Strip Basket (6 piece): 12 grams
10. White Castle French Fries (sack): 11 grams

People are getting a little nuts with this. Sure it&apos;s no good for you but give it a rest. The hysterical carping about the poisonous ingredient du jour is has reached comic proportions.

What you mean that FRIED foods are not good for me? Really? One serving and I am dead, dead, dead....
And, don&apos;t get started that it is just about trans fats... Please. Doesn&apos;t everyone know that fried foods are an occasional indulgence? No matter what they are fried in? Moderation. Now off for a glass of wine and some fried pork rinds.

 12-03-2007 @ 2:23AM flax seed said... If these foods have at least 5 grams of transfats, then it can really be considered as unhealthy. According to a very recent CNN report, feeding daily on at least 5 grams of transfats enriched food such as french fries increases the risk of heart disease by 5%. Fact is we need to fuel the diet with more Omega 3 nutrients or the unsaturated type of fat than the saturated and transfats for that matter. If you want to sustain your cardiovascular health, we should refrain from taking in excessive transfats in our diet.
