 Garlic Is So GOOD!!! 
 Posted on February 1, 2012 by Karl Reply 

 

I LOVE Garlic!  I can’t imagine why anyone wouldn’t!  It’s so tasty and lends itself to all sorts of unique and wonderous dishes.  You can go so many ways with it!  You can dice it, slice it, mash it, puree it, and please don’t forget to try of my favorites and make sure to give roasting it a shot! &lt;roasted garlic takes on a whole new life of its own!&gt; 

Some people I’ve talked with tend to think that garlic is a little overpowering as a spice.  In some ways, they’re correct.  But it doesn’t always have to be that way.  Properly prepared, garlic actually has a sort of sweet buttery taste and consistency.  When I cook sauces, I generally use raw garlic and I prefer to dice or mash it up &lt;I gravitate to a mortar and pestle but there are a LOT of great utensils that can do pretty much the same thing (see the next photo for a”peek”at mortars and pestles))&gt; .

 

Garlic in its raw form can be sort of strong to the taste buds.  But I’ve discovered ways to“soften it up” &lt;we’ll get to that in a bit.&gt; So now, for the fun and info, a little history and science…Many cultures have known the health benefits of garlic over the centuries.  It’s even been proposed that the Greeks would feed garlic to their athletes before competition in olympic games &lt;how kewl is that!&gt; 

Garlic is very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol, and Sodium.  It’s a good source of Calcium, Phosphorus, and Selenium.  And it’s a great source of Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, and Manganese.  The antioxidants in garlic help to protect us from free radical cell damage that occur naturally in the body from such things as cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet light.  The nutrients in garlic have been proposed to help prevent heart disease and cancer (the studies were a little more specific relating to cancers of the colon, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, and breast.). Additional studies have concluded that garlic might be beneficial in reducing high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, and the effects of the common cold.

I feel a need to warn you that the NCCAM has proposed that garlic may be related to increasing or prolonging bleeding in some cases &lt;so if you have a condition related to this, PLEASE talk with your health professional before going on a“garlic binge”&gt; .  You should probably avoid consuming garlic before a surgery and it may decrease the effectiveness of certain HIV/AIDS medications.

OK, enough about all of that…Lets talk a little more about preparation.  One of the things I have often run into regarding interactions with people about garlic is the difference between a“clove”and a“bulb”.  The picture up top represents“bulbs”.  This is how garlic naturally grows.  The cloves reside within the bulb.  So when the recipe says“one clove of garlic”, please don’t throw a whole bulb in there…You’ll just freak out your guests taste buds!

When you are working with cloves of garlic, you have to“strip”off their skin.  My brother-in-law uses a cutlery knife but I generally use a spatula &lt;I keep my knives really sharp and don’t want to get cut&gt;.. What you need to do is take the implement of choice and put some pressure on the clove on a cutting board.  Then gently roll it back and forth until you hear the“crinkle”sound.  At this point, the clove should just slip out of the skin and you’re ready to go!  A good point here is that there are many companies that sell products to avoid having to go this way.  One, from memory, is from
 ZAK Designs .  They sell a product called the“E-Z-Roll Garlic Peeler”.  It’s a sort of“silicone tube”that you put a clove into and roll on the cutting board until you hear that all familiar“crinkle”.  Same effect but you don’t have to worry about where the Band-Aids are &lt;grin&gt; !

Once out of its skin, you’re ready to do with it what you wish.  As I said before you have a lot of options.  A really good one is to take a razor and slice the clove, very carefully, into paper thin strips.  Drop the strips into a tablespoon or so of natural butter and saute for a while (3-5 minutes).  What you come out with should probably go on top of your entre de jour.  The garlic should be sweet and almost melt in the mouth.  Trust, they WILL thank you &lt;just don’t share our little“slicing secret”with them&gt;.  (We want to keep them coming back for more, right ??) 

Now, onto the end and to tell you about one of my very favorite recipes regarding garlic.  For this you will need“bulbs”.  Pre-heat your oven to around 375 degrees. Take 4-6 garlic bulbs and peel away the outer skin so that you can see the cloves inside &lt;don’t peel away the skins from the individual cloves, you need those for insulation from the heat to avoid burning the garlic pulp&gt;. Slice off about a half inch from the pointed top of the bulbs.  Now pour about a tablespoon or so of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) over the top of each bulb &lt;My personal preference is Bertolli &gt;(special note**  if you haven’t already been introduced to these oils and decide to do some searing or stir fry, you might want to go with the Bertolli Extra Light Tasting Oil&lt;its“smoke point”is about 60 degrees higher than EVOO and that helps out when you’re dealing with high temp cooking so you don’t smell up the kitchen so much [laugh]&gt;) .  While the EVOO is soaking into the bulbs, take out your baking dish and line it with aluminum foil.  spread a little EVOO onto the bottom to avoid sticking.  Then go back to the bulbs and drop on another tablespoon or so of EVOO and let it soak in again.

Place the bulbs into the prepared baking dish and cover the whole thing up with more foil &lt;this keeps the moisture in&gt;. Throw it into the preheated oven and let it cook for about 45–60 minutes.

Now get ready to ROCK your guests socks!  When you pull the garlic out of the oven and uncover it, a waft of amazing aroma will fill the room!  Everyone will be like“WHAT!!?”“What is that!!?”Let the garlic sit for a minute or so until it won’t burn your fingers and then just squeeze it out of the bulbs into an appetizer plate.  Serve it with crackers, toast points, pita, or whatever you wish but know that you won’t be sorry.  If you so desire, you could probably throw in some bruchetta dressings or a nice tapenade. &lt;it’s really all up to how creative you feel at the moment&gt;.. 

Done the right way, your guests will thank you in the end and you’ll be happier for it all!

 Health and Happiness!!

 Tomatoes! WOW!!! 
 Posted on January 2, 2012 by Karl 10 

 

OH my goodness!  I LOVE tomatoes!  They’re just so tasty and healthy!  I can’t think of a better food that has so much energy and kindness for our bodies!  Just think about all the possibilities we’re offered here!  Pasta sauce, tomato spreads, SUPER salads, tomato soup, tomato bisque, those lovely little grapes &lt;just for snacking of course&gt; (and NEVER forget the ULTIMATE of all sandwiches the BLT!!&lt;just please use something lean like turkey bacon for the health of it&gt;)! 

In my humble opinion,  the more tomatoes you eat the healthier you will find yourself!  I generally try to find local organic/sustainable growers (they take the extra time to make their product better) .  But, in a pinch, I sometimes have to go with a conventional/commercial product (it makes me cry just a little bit down in my heart but sometimes you just have to go with what you can get)… 

It would be somewhat remiss and neglegtful not to tell you what you will get out of all these little jewels..  One of the“big benefits”is lycopene.  This has long been known to be an outstanding antioxidant.  But it doesn’t stop there!  Tomatoes are low in sodium, saturated fat,and cholesterol.  They are a good source of Vitamin E, Thiamin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Magnesium, Phosphorus, and Copper.  They are a great source of dietary fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Potassium, and Manganese.  While they are only mildly anti-inflammatory in nature, their glycemic load is very low &lt;great news for all of us who are diabetic or hypoglycemic&gt; !

Now that we’re done with all the science stuff, I feel a need to give up a little recipe info..  I’m not allowed to give out Aunt Sandi’s pasta sauce recipe &lt;It ROCKS but it’s a family secret&gt;. I can, however, give you some hints to get you started!  Ready??

Start with maybe 12-24 vine ripe tomatoes.  Peel and dice them up.  Take 3-4 stalks of celery and use a knife to pull off the threads then dice them up too.  Dice up a half of a sweet onion and also a half of a green bell pepper.  Now move on to the spices &lt;it’s important to use fresh herbs instead of the powdered one’s you buy for general purposes&gt; .  Chop up a couple of tablespoons of fresh basil and oregano and perhaps a teaspoon or so of thyme.  A couple of teaspoons of natural sea salt never hurts in a pasta sauce.  Throw all this great stuff into a saucepan and gently cook it over medium heat for 10-20 minutes.  When it’s done cooking, toss it into your food processor or blender and give it a quick whirl.  Then return the mixture back to the saucepan and simmer it on low heat for about 30 minutes.  If you want to add meat to the equation, make sure it’s something like 90/10 ground round or nice steak bits.  If you DO go in that direction &lt;I always do&gt; you’ll need to be searing the meat during the first steps and adding it in the end prior to the final simmer.

I’m not going to give any advise on what pasta you should use for your dining experience but it would be awesome if you chose a whole wheat variety.  Just cook it all up and when you can’t wait any longer &lt;and the guests can’t wait either&gt; SERVE IT And Enjoy !!

I won’t make any promises, but I’m hoping that you might enjoy what you get in the end!

 Health And Happiness!! 

 HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!

 The Incredible Edible Egg? You’d Better Believe It!! 
 Posted on December 1, 2011 by Karl 47 

 

Whoa!!  How do I even get started on this one?!!  Fried, poached, scrambled, soft boiled, hard boiled, over easy, coddled, egg salad, deviled&lt; probably my most favorite.. (Oh yeah, you DO get a recipe out of this article!) &gt;.  And an omelete?&lt; you can’t possibly go wrong there! &gt;I’m getting a little misty here just thinking about the possibilities we have within our grasp at this point!

In my humble opinion the egg is totally misunderstood and unnapreciated as a healthful food that can make our lives SO much better!

Eggs, of course , come from hens ( these little girls work very hard to give us this awesome treat!  And we should really take the time to thank them for all that serious effort!) 

But let’s get on to a little bit of the science here to keep you on the right track!  Eggs are great for the eyes!  Think lutein and zeaxanthin . Both of these wonderful nutrients help to stave off macular degeneration.  One egg has somewhere arond 6 grams of pure protein and at the very least 9 essential amino acids!  Wow, that’s even better than the best slice of steak pound for pound!  Eggs are a great source of choline !  This is an important nutrient that helps regulate the brain, nervous system, and cardiovascular systems.  Eggs are known to have a positive impact on cholesterol levels!  They don’t hurt your lipid levels and can, in fact, improve them!  Eggs are one of the great foods that contain naturally occurring vitamin D!  Eggs can help to prevent breast cancer!  We’re talking about a researched 44% improvement when you consume about 6 a week!  The high sulpher content along with the vitamins and minerals in eggs also help with hair and nail growth!

Whew!  Who knew??!  But now on to a little recipe for deviled eggs!  This is one of my personal favorites!  There’s no real hardfast set of instrucitons here but there are a few rules you should follow to make it all work out right..

Take a dozen or so eggs and gently place them into cold water in a pot (if you can swing it, try to go with natural organic eggs.&lt;these are the brown ones&gt;). Regular store bought eggs are bleached and the hens aren’t treated as well as their cage free relatives &lt;the“factory production”they have to go through kind of stresses them out more than a little bit&gt;. The store bought eggs tend to be somewhat cloudier in consistancy and you will certainly notice the difference between the two varieties in the end!  Slowly bring the eggs up to a boil then turn down the temperature a little bit so that they can warmly simmer for about 15–18 minutes.  You might think that hardboiling an egg is the easiest part but really it’s not.  It takes a keen eye to know when the eggs are just right.  Too little time cooking yields an undercooked soft mushy yellow center&lt; We don’t want that because undercooked eggs can make your guests sick&gt;. Too much time cooking puts a green ring around the yolk. &lt;We don’t want that either! The gray green discoloration comes from the formation of ferrous sulfide where the yolk and whites meet&gt;. When you’re done cooking them, dump out the boiling water and run them under cool water for another 5 minutes so they can stop their cooking process.  At this point you get to crack the shells so that you have something to work with.  You might think this would be so easy as well but not so much.  There is a clear membrane between the shell and the meat of the egg.  If the egg is too cold, the membrane won’t want to come off very easily.  What I do is take the eggs, one by one, out of the cool rinse and shell them under lukewarm water.  Do it however you like but I generally take a blunt tool like a kitchen spoon or knife and give the shell a few“pops”to loosen it up.  You might also be tempted to try and use your fingernails to loosen up the membrane.  That’s never worked for me.  A gentle stream of lukewarm water and just using your thumb or forfinger to gently separate it has always been my best bet in the end.  I won’t lie, you WILL screw one or two up on your first attempt.  Don’t sweat it because you just get to pop the“rejects”into your mouth while your cooking up the rest of this wonderful dish &lt;grin&gt;! (Note!!  Please try not to throw the shells down the garbage disposal!  To date, I think I’ve jammed up more than three doing this.  I just throw them in the trash and take out the bag when all the other great food is done and disposed of.) Cut each egg in half and drop the yolk into a bowl.  I generally take the egg and sort of“roll it around”until I can feel the yolk being on top and then go with the cut.  I always wash the halves gently in cool water and chill them in the fridge to make sure I end up with a nice clean product while I’m working on the rest of the recipe.

Grab a fork and mash up the yolks.  Don’t be lazy, you want a clean consistency here.  Throw in a few dollops of mayonaise, spicy mustard, and sweet pickle relish (i usually drop in a little cayenne sauce to kick it up a bit but you may not want to go that far) ..  Mix it all up really well and get ready for the fun part.

Take the halved eggs out of the fridge and grab a pastry bag.  Load up the filling and pipe it into the egg halves!  You can sprinkle some paprika over them if you like but that’s mostly just a color thing.

At this point, you get to sit back and watch them get devoured!  Everyone’s going to ask how you made this incredible dish and your reward is going to be the pure joy of just laughing a little bit over the whole thing and knowing you made someone smile in the end!

I hope you enjoy the recipe..  To this date, I’ve never had one complaint and they always seem to ask why there’s not anymore left to eat!

 Health and Happiness!

 Hooray For Hummus!!! 
 Posted on November 29, 2011 by Karl Reply 

 

I got a little bit inspired to study up on hummus after a fantastic evening dinner with my family at Il Ponte here in Wichita, Kansas ( yeah, the secret’s officially out, I’m from the midwest USA&lt;grin&gt; ).  If you get the chance to visit them, PLEASE DO!!!  ( you won’t be sorry! )  This is one of the nicest restaurants I’ve been to in a very long time!  Everyone is welcomed and greeted with the utmost respect and kindness ( I’m talking about my mom getting a big hug and every gentleman getting a firm handshake and pleasant welcome to the establishment )!  The cuisine you ask??  Let me just say,“ OMG, this place is so far beyond awesome! “The portions are outstanding!  The service is remarkable!  And, they truly provide a“personal touch”to the entire experience of dining!!  Should you decide to patronize this establishment, I can offer a personal guarantee that you won’t be disappointed!  ( I’m not plugging them for cash, I REALLY DO like what they have to offer and I’m a TOTAL fan of all they do to make us all well fed and happy )…

But enough about that.  Let’s get on to the real substance of this topic..  Hummus…All in all, it comes down to a base of chickpeas ( garbanzo beans ) mixed up with a wonderful combination of other ingredients (please don’t be afraid to experiment ) in a way that makes your taste buds just WHIRL in delight!   I won’t lie and try to sell out someone else’s recipe ( I would never do that based on general principle ) but I can certainly try to help get you started on your journey into this wonderful food!

We have to take a small trip down memory lane before we get on to the great stuff you’re heart is begging for!  What we’re talking about here is a levantine food.  This particular food comes to us from our wonderful friends in the mideast.  The“Levant”is most properly defined as the region we know as Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria (tides change and so do boundaries but it’s still pretty much the same in the end.)  I can’t complain nor would I because this GREAT stuff came out of that region.  We’re talking about an incredibly passionate place filled with people who rejoice in wonder and love!  So it only makes sense that a wonderous food should follow!!

Now, on to a recipe so that you can get started..  ( careful, we have to take a few baby steps here&lt;snicker&gt;) 

You can pretty much run this any way you want but at least try to stay within the obvious boundaries of kindness to yourself and your family (I’ve been accused more than once about“over-spicing”my dishes&lt;laugh&gt;). This is what you should get in the end game..  A very healthy dose of iron, zinc, magnesium, saponins, folic acid, protease inhibitors, phytic acids and a whole gambit of other nutrients that will guarantee a healthful meal!!  Most of my recipe suggestions are carbohydrate based  ( I DO love the fruits and veggies!), but not this one !  We’re talking pure and natural protein in all its glorious vigor and this one will fill you up and make you happy for sure!

 1 head of garlic 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 16 oz of chickpeas (garbanzo beans) 1/3 cup roasted red pepper 2 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsp Tahini sauce 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 1/4 tsp sea salt (let’s get real and use the good stuff!) 1/4 tsp coarse black pepper 

“Oops! you said a head of garlic!!  How do I make that happen?!”It’s just so easy!!  Take the head of the garlic and cut off a quarter of the top.  Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over the whole thing and wrap it in foil.  Bake it for about an hour and you’re all done with that part!

Now we get to move on to the next step!  ( remember the baby steps?  Some people are allergic to sesame .)  We want everyone to be happy and healthy right?!!!  Cutting out the Tahini sauce won’t hurt the recipe at all. It won’t ruin the flavor and it’s just so much easier than having to escort your best friend to the ER over an allergic reaction!!

We’re down to the mix then!!  Just puree the chickpeas and roll in all the other ingredients!   What you get in the end will be totally awesome!  Serve it with flatbread(pita) or chips.  As usual, it’s all up to you!

 Health and Happiness! 

 And once again, HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!

 Butter Got a Bad Rap!!! 
 Posted on November 16, 2011 by Karl 1 

 

I’m getting ready to take you in a different direction due to the upcoming holiday season..  This isn’t an article that I would normally write ( given the fact that I usually tend to gravitate toward fruits and veggies ).  And its going to be a little wordy and technical so please bear with me.  After some consideration, research, and a genuine fondness for all things tasty and sweet,  I thought it would be prudent and justified to ( yet again ) hit the books in an attempt to put the 411 on something we’ve all been told was bad.  I found copious amounts of data and discovered that sharing it with you might mean everyone could be able to enjoy a little more of this unappreciated ingredient in their diet and not feel so guilty about it!

So let’s start by telling you how this article really came about…The whole thing was inspired by a phone conversation with my awesome daughter Ashbee.  I was asking for some recipe inspiration and I know she likes to bake..  Her comment??“Daddy, your site is for healthy foods like fruits and veggies!  I put way too much butter into my cookies and baked goods!”

Well, after doing a little math and science homework,  I figured out that this paradigm was TOTALLY at fault.  And now we get to go back to a trip through my research in order to explain it all..  As usual, hang on to your dictionary and grab another snack or two..  ( yep, you’re in for yet another one of my tirades! )

It all begins with a little bit of history..  Thousands of years of farming and providing for our loved ones could never be construed as being wrong.  About 4500 years ago domesticated animals that produced milk came into play.  There are numerous references in written history related to dairy products.  We’re talking indian, polynesian, middle eastern, european, biblical and the list just keeps going on and on.

But, let’s take a time trip up to circa 1960..  This is where butter became a“villain”.  Heart disease was a number 1 killer and somehow butter got some of the blame.  But, get this , the total consumption of butter had actually gone down!  We had been duped into the idea that fat was the thing killing us off!  Now, we all agreed and tried to limit the ingestion of butter and meat fats in the hope that we would be happier and healthier.  Then along came the baby boomers who were told that a new product called margarine was more convenient, safer, and easier on the budget.  I have more to follow regarding hydrogenated products ( that would be the margarine ) but we have to take this one step at a time.

As a result of all this propaganda, the early 1970′s Americans’average saturated fat intake had dropped considerably, while the rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease had surged!  Reducing healthy sources of dietary fat has contributed to a serious decline in our overall well-being, and those of us that speak out against it are still largely ignored .

So is Margarine Better than Butter?

 No, No, NO!!! Natural raw butter is a complete food essential to your health.  Especially when you eat it in its organic and unpasteurized form
 (the sidenote here is that pasteurization kills off the nutrients we would get if we didn’t cook them away.) Please make the extra effort to obtain high-quality organic, raw butter .  This point cannot be stressed enough! (A little problem here is that natural raw butter is difficult to obtain in the USA.  It’s sale is prohibited in most of our 50 states.) I did manage to find a source in Missouri and after a quick phone call discovered that while they don’t actually sell“true”raw butter, they do strive to provide the best source that they can.   Mr. Wood is (in my humble opinion) very kind and informative about his nutritional ethics and I encourage you to give his site a peek  ( US Wellness Meats ).  (BTW, although I was looking for butter, I quickly discovered that his farm in Monticello has SO much more to offer!)

But let’s get back to the“true”villain of our story.  Margarine (and a lot of the cooking oils we use on a daily basis) are essentially“processed foods”, created chemically from refined polyunsaturated oils. The process used to make these“ normally liquid” oils into a spreadable form is called hydrogenation .  I could, at this point, drag you into a whole biochem lesson but let’s just skip that part (it’s long, dry, and, pretty boring.)  All things being said, hydrogenation pretty much amounts to chemically altering a product and, in the process, making it somewhat toxic.

Please know this..

 Margarine and other similar hydrogenated or processed polyunsaturated oils are potentially detrimental to your health.   Saturated fats, in acceptable amounts, are actually good for you. 

So now that I’m done“preaching” (hang on while I jump back off of my soapbox) , let’s get on to the real reason you should enjoy the greatness of butter (and one of the real reasons I even studied up for this article) !  I’ll give you 20 to start and you can take it from there.. (Please don’t get me started back up about the science again.. It would just put you to sleep and nobody wants that )!

 Butter is rich in easily absorbable Vitamin A which helps with thyroid and adrenal health. Butter contains lauric acid which helps to treat fungal infections and candida. Butter contains letchin which helps metabolize cholesterol. Butter contains anti-oxidants that help with free radical damage. Those same anti-oxidants help with arterial damage. Butter is a great source of both Vitamins E and K. Butter is a very rich source of the essential mineral selenium. The saturated fats in butter contain strong anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties. Butter contains conjugated linoleic acid which is a potent anti-cancer agent, muscle builder, and immunity booster. The Vitamin D found in butter is essential for the absorbtion of calcium. Butter helps to prevent tooth decay. Butter helps to prevent calcification of the joints. Butter helps to prevent hardening of the arteries, cataracts, and calcification of the penial gland. Butter greatly helps in the digestion of minerals. Butter contains a highly absorbable source of iodine. Certain studies have concluded that butter may promote fertility in women. Butter is a quick source of energy and is not stored in our adipose tissues. The cholesterol found in butterfat is essential for children’s brain and nervous system development. Butter contains arachidonic acid which plays a role in brain function and is a vital component of cell membranes. Butter protects the young and elderly from gastrointestinal infections. 

Whew!  What a list!  So know that you’re“in the know”.  I guess there’s only one thing left to say… Baby Girl, can I PLEASE have one or two of your recipes for all of these wonderful people to enjoy?? 

As usual, Health and Happiness to you all! 

 And, of course, HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

 Let’s Give Celery a Gold Star! 
 Posted on November 5, 2011 by Karl 1 

 

OK everyone…Raise your hand if you don’t like celery ( who else hears crickets chirping? )…Everybody loves celery!  And there’s a good reason for that!  Celery is crisp, light, and tasty as well!  There’s so much you can do with it!  Think salads, stir-fry, peanut butter, cream cheese, yogurt, humus, (lest we forget the all famous and fabulous Chicago Dog &lt; my wife just slapped my hand for that suggestion but I had to toss you the hyperlink out of general principle! “What can I say..  I’m only human!”&gt;Whatever you like as a compliment to a meal and / or delicious snack, celery certainly fills the bill!

In my humble opinion, celery has gotten a bad rap.  Here’s this GREAT veggie just waiting patiently for you to partake and all you can say is“It’s just fiber and water, why even give it the effort?”Well, let’s introduce our new-found friend to a chance for getting into the mix and making sure you discover something FANTASTIC!..  I promise you will be excited in the end!

First off, we should get some history out-of-the-way.  For a long time celery has been known for its healing properties.  In ancient times it was considered to be a powerful medicinal herb and was used for such maladies as gallstones, constipation, menstrual issues, and kidney / liver disorders.  Our buddies, the Romans, ( party animals that they were ) often wore wreaths of celery in the hope that they could overcome the inevitable hangover from last night’s merriment ( good luck with that dudes!! &lt; grin &gt;).

Now, I would be remiss if I didn’t tell you about some of the downsides regarding this wonderful vegetable.  Celery, as with a lot of other veggies, produces a naturopathic pesticide to protect itself from fungi and other pests.  For celery, it comes in the form of psoralen .  This particular form of protection can be a little bit tough for some of us to deal with ( it can prove to be a little bit toxic to some people’s skin ).  But worry not.  Washing it off with some soap and water will usually take care of any issues you might experience.

But enough about the cons, let’s get on to the good stuff!  Celery is both nutritious and hydrating.  Because it’s alkalyzing in nature it tends to balance out the body’s PH.  Every part of celery is packed with vitamins and minerals!  It’s high in Vitamin A, Vitamins B1, B2, B6, and Vitamin C.  It’s also dense in potassium, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, iron, phosphorus, sodium and several essential amino acids.  Celery contains important concentrations of plant hormones and essential oils that lend to its characteristic smell.  These hormones and oils help to regulate the nervous system, and possess a natural calming effect.

The sodium that celery contains is both soluble and organic ( living ), and essential for the body.  Organic salts allow the body to process the other nutrients that we take in.  Every cell in our body is constantly bathed in a salt solution, and if the salt level is not in balance, dehydration occurs.  This is why celery juice is a perfect rehydration drink for athletes ( I know everyone loves Gatorade but it’s really high in sugar so celery juice is probably the better way to go ).  I’m almost certain that the coach would bring a whole truckload if it meant getting that hail mary pass across the line!

So let’s get on to some of the more awesome benefits celery has to offer ( Long story short, I’m about to take you out for a little biology class&lt;this part is way too much fun so grab a snack and snag a dictionary&gt; ).  Celery is rich in Vitamin C meaning it has antioxidant qualities and naturally boosts our immune system.  Celery is highly recommended in most detox diet plans as a cleanser to add to your juicing recipes. It has excellent cleansing properties that help to aid digestion and regulate body fluid by acting as a diuretic and also curbing cravings for sweets.  Studies have shown that celery contains a at least eight compounds that help to prevent cancer cells from spreading.  Certain compounds called acetylenics have been shown to stop the growth of tumor cells.  Celery contains other compounds as well called phonolic acids that block the action of hormone-like substances called prostaglandins, which encourage the growth of tumor cells.  Coumarins, another phytonutrient in celery helps prevent free-radicals from damaging cells and helps to prevent the formation and development of colon and stomach cancers.  Studies have indicated that butyl phthalide, a chemical found in celery, may help reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol.  Celery also helps to increase bile acid secretion which helps to remove cholesterol from the body.  Celery improves the digestion process because it is a natural laxative that helps to relieve constipation. Special nutrients in the fiber are released during juicing that aid bowel movements.  The potassium and sodium in celery juice are powerful body fluid regulators ( diuretics ) that stimulate urine production to help rid the body of excess fluid.  The polyacetylene in celery is an amazing relief for all inflammation including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, asthma and bronchitis.  A study found that another powerful phytonutrient called luteolin blocks the inflammation pathway in the brain.  Luteolin also inhibits the excess production of TNF-alpha, a direct cause of inflammation.  Chinese medicine has long recognized celery’s potential for reducing high blood pressure.  Studies show that drinking celery juice every day for 1 week can significantly help lower blood pressure.  A compound called phtalides helps relax the muscles around the arteries, dilating the vessels and allowing blood to flow smoothly.  Pthalides also reduce stress hormones, one of whose effects is to cause blood vessels to constrict.  Celery juice is said to have a calming effect on the nervous system, making it beneficial for insomniacs.  Its high magnesium levels help people to relax into a soothing and restful sleep.  Drinking celery juice frequently throughout the day is a popular natural appetite suppressant.  Snacking on celery during the day will help fill you up without adding extra calories.  Celery juice is great for cleansing toxins from the body and is a good natural remedy for dissolving and passing of urinary and gall stones.  Drinking it regularly will help to keep them from forming again.  Celery juice is beneficial for a weak sex drive without the effects of an uncontrollable urge that some pharmaceutical drugs have.

Wow!  I didn’t know how much celery had to offer when I started on this research!  But now that we’ve covered all the bases, I have hope that you will give it a shot as a regular part of your diet.

As usual, Health and Happiness!
