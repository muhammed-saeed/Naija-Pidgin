 The 
Restaurant Inventory Management Program 

 Scroll down for additional information on how 
it works for you. 

 

 
 Inventory 

 Why? 

 

 Taking inventory in your restaurant should be 
easy, accurate and most of all fast. You need to know how much inventory you 
have on hand and what it&apos;s value is but you don&apos;t need to spend a lot of time 
doing it. Your time is more valuable managing your restaurant, controlling the 
flow of customers and watching food quality instead of trying to get an accurate 
count of your inventory. The Restaurant Management Inventory software can make 
inventory counting, costing and control a breeze while saving you time. Accuracy 
is of the utmost importance in managing food cost and expenses. 

 

 Your Vendor Doesn&apos;t want you to use this program! 

 

 You food vendors don&apos;t want to be able to see 
what they are doing with prices and switching products on you. We hear it every 
day! This program allows you to track purchases and purchases form all vendors 
for any type of products. Most importantly it shows you when the price on the 
invoice goes up or down and by how much. The program also tracks a history of 
each product from each vendor and shows you how and how often the prices change. 
It also lets you know when the vendor substitutes another product for the one 
that you ordered. This restaurant software can save you thousands of dollars 
each year by watching your cost for you. 

 

 Inventory 

 How 

 

 The Restaurant Management Software System gives 
you and easy to use and learn software that can have you up and running in under 
1 hour making it easy to count, organize and control in one simple package. 
Keeping inventory prices and products accurately priced can be accomplished in 
many ways. First, most food service distributors can offer you a download of 
your items purchased form them from websites or directly from the vendor. This 
makes updating your inventory fast and accurate. No more fumbling around for 
stacks of vendor invoices every time you want to take inventory. No more 
guesswork on where this came from or what did we pay for that and when. 

 

 Restaurant software and restaurant accounting software from 
RMS software can provide you with the best alternative to normal restaurant pos 
software or restaurant point of sale software that is very limited and in many 
cases turns out to be an expensive cash register system. Our restaurant 
inventory software gives you the power to update your restaurant inventory 
prices electronically from major vendors such as US Foods and some of the 
biggest vendors in the country. Most 
restaurant pos software programs do not have this capability and the work 
involved in keeping prices updated is just to hard. Without current and correct 
prices the whole system is not effective. Both a restaurant business plan 
software and a restaurant menu software require current vendor prices to work 
properly as well as any restaurant computer software. Food service management 
software needs to be easy to use and yet powerful enough to get the job done. 
Unlike most food and beverage software or recipe software RMS provides to most 
power and ease of use in both food service management and in food cost software 
for customers and food service distributors as well. This software is a great 
asset to any type of restaurant business plan software.
