The food and service are outstanding. Once you get there, I find it very hard to leave. The atmosphere is very inviting. They definitely set the bar as to what a world class restaurnat should be.

I had heard about Parkside for years and when I finally got to dine here, I was not disappointed! The food is wonderfully tasty and the aroma of garlic will entice. Sitting in the downstairs room surrounded by all those plants is a calming, lovely experience. Be sure to make reservations unless you are going at a very off-hour time. You will love it here!!

This place has outstanding food and service.They are quite happy to alter any dish to you liking. I ordered a pasta dish with garlic and oil and sauteed broccoli. It wasn&apos;t on the menu, but they prepared it and it was delicious. All my meat-eating friends loved their dishes as well.

This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants. The food is so good
and the service is wonderful. They give a nice assortment of bread.
It can get quite noisy if you eat downstairs. They do have a room
upstairs that is more quiet. Someone must really like Marilyn Monroe because the walls are covered with her pictures.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Awful! Terrible!! BAD FOOD AND SERVICE!! 
by drusso23 at Citysearch 1 Park Side Restaurant 
 October 15, 2010 
if this restaurant was in manhattan it would have closed a long time ago!!! ? - ? - Today
I&apos;ve been to this restaurant three times. I went there each time hoping for better food and better service, each time i&apos;ve been disappointed. This last time was the last straw. My mother is in a Wheelchair and the valet wouldn&apos;t bring the car around. Instead my elderly father had to bring the car around and the valets sat in the booth and watched. I would have got the car myself but i had to stay with my mother. Not only is the food terrible and not worth it. The service inside and outside is terrible. I hope more people recognize that this restaurant is not good and they are prejudice against people in wheelchairs!!


 ★☆☆☆☆ Horrible! 
by MimiVS at Citysearch 1 Park Side Restaurant 
 April 30, 2010 
My husband and I have been looking into several Italian Restaurants within Queens in search of a place where to host a birthday party of about 60 to 75 guest (for the end of June). We came across this restaurant in the internet, and although we saw some of the awful reviews we decided to find out for ourselves...big mistake! From the moment we walked into this restaurant my husband and I were &quot;greeted&quot; by the rudest hostess who rather then walking us to our table simply pointed to the worst seating area in the restaurant and said &quot;Sit around there.&quot; Five minutes later my husband had to ask someone to let us see a menu. After our appetizers arrive our waiter, who previously greeted us with a not so friendly &quot;are you ready&quot; when taking our order, decides it is time to bring us our drinks. The food arrived soon after - and just as expected was mediocre. On a norm we like to sit and have a coffee and desert after a meal - needless to say we left right after the main course... left a much deserved tip of $0. And will never step foot into this place again, and will make sure the 60 to 75 attendants we were planning to host hear how horrible this place is.
For those of you looking for great service and excellent Italian food I highly recommend Bartolino&apos;s in Astoria definitely our top choice so far.

Pros: NONE - I gave it a 1 rating only because 0 was not an option

Cons: Hostess, Service, Food.


 ★☆☆☆☆ I advise everyone to avoid this place!!!

My boyfriend and I just came back from Park Side Restaurant very dissapointed. As far as Italian restaurants go, this has to be one of the worse. Food was horrible, definitely not worth the money which we paid.


 ★★☆☆☆ Dissapointing... 
by tattooeye at Citysearch 2 Park Side Restaurant 
 August 01, 2009 
My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night, we made reservations ahead of time, but had to wait 40 minutes to be seated. Meanwhile there were a few couples that have come in after us who seemed to know the manager that were proomptly seated. When we were finally given a table we had to wait for someone to acknoledge us for a while, although the table next to us (they were seated after us) got immediate service. The food here is quite mediocre. The crabcake I ordered for appetizer was terrible. My lamb chops were half fat and grissle. I would not recommend this place...

Pros: nice decor

Cons: service, food


 ★★☆☆☆ I will never go back 
by SHC at Citysearch 2 Park Side Restaurant 
 June 12, 2009 
My boyfriend and I went for my birthday. We are an interracial couple and I really think that is why they were so rude. I would NEVER go back, even if it was free.

We had a reservation&amp;still waited 30 minutes. When I asked the hostess how much longer she was rude and the second time I asked, 15 minutes later, I was ignored. We were finally seated at a crappy table. Even though there were at least 4-5 empty tables in the same section.

We waited a long time to even see our waiter. The service was slow and the food was only fair at best. I would not have minded the price if the food was better. I have no idea what people rave about.

Pros: Parking

Cons: Food/Service/Wait


 ★★★★★ Top Shelf Italian Restaurant 
by ItaliaPhil at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 June 10, 2009 
Ive been going to Parkside ever since It opened in my neighborhood.....Alfredo the Matre &apos;D is always acommodating and friendly and the waiters are top notch....The food has always been terrific and Ive NEVER ordered anything there that I was disapointed in.... How many popular places do you go to where you sit right down the second you walk in even with a reservation....This place is that busy 7 days a week....So I dont ever have a problem waiting a bit when I walk in....If your in a hurry when you go out...then drive thru a drive thru like mc donalds or wendys.....I promise you the food at Parkside will reward your patience at the door ten times over.....THE BEST KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER.....And the prices are so reasonable its amazing.......Ciao for now....

Pros: Excellant service and food

Cons: NONE


 ★★★★★ Consistently good 
by daco at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 April 02, 2009 
I am a huge fan of parkside and have been coming here for years. It is consistently good, and the staff is more and more professional everytime I come. I strongly disagree with all of Jiffy81&apos;s comments below. The bread basket is amazing you must try the proscuitto bread. They have an extensive menu but will make anything you request and its always delicious! I recommend trying the porcini risotto (i hate mushrooms but still love this dish) and the baby lamb chops (comes with a mustard sort of glaze/crust.. so good)

Pros: professional staff, excellent food, great home made wine

Cons: None


 ★★★★☆ HORRIBLE ITALIAN RESTAURANT 
by jiffy81 at Citysearch 4 Park Side Restaurant 
 March 12, 2009 
I was recommended to come to this &quot;great&quot; yea right restaurant for a while so me and my gf decided to try it out. The waiter was horrible with no smile and appeared to be an animal not a human. The food is terrible. The tomato mozzarella is the worse. They give you soggy mozzarella with only two small pieces and two tomatoes. It tasted terrible. The bread they give is hard as a rock and the caesar salad smells like fish. I have been to many great Italian restaurants such as Buena Serra, Baci in Westbury. The waiter was terrible and should be fired and the food is extremely bad. I advise everyone to avoid this place.

Pros: Nothing good

Cons: Extremely bad service


 ★★★☆☆ Just average 
by jgsued at Citysearch 3 Park Side Restaurant 
 November 22, 2008 
This was my first time eating here. I know, eat, and cook Italian food.

I hosted a birthday dinner here.

We made reservations here for a group of 9 at 8pm on a Friday night. The hostess was not really accommodating and would not seat us until the whole party was there even if two were running late. She also had the nerve to ask someone in my party if he could move over from the waiting area. All I wanted to say was &quot;well, where do you want a party of 7 to stand?&quot; The hostess, an older woman, really had an uppity attitude, so that didn&apos;t help. We ended up being seated around 9:20 pm.

Negatives: FOOD.
For appetizers, we ordered shrimp, calamari, and stuffed clams. They brought over two pieces of shrimp, applebee&apos;s like- calamari, and average stuffed clams. Needless to say, nothing stood out. We ordered a variety of things, from veal, to tortellini alfredo, to salmon, to linguini with clam sauce. The consensus was, the food was merely O.K. One of my guests who had been to this restaurant before said &quot;I remember this place being really good but there seems to be a drop-off in the quality of the food. This placed used to be much better.&quot; We ordered about six desserts and they were all sub-par except for one. Overall, the hype about this place used to be about the food. Either they had an off night or the quality of food has really dropped off.

Positives:
-Our waiter was excellent. He was attentive and always had our drinks ready.
-Our drinks were very good as well.
-Extensive selection of wines. We had an excellent bottle at a reasonable price.
-Valet parking.

Overall, this place seems to have been a great place, but no longer is. Food is o.k. definitely not worth the $500 we spent that night. Although this might sound reasonable, I should note that we ordered 7 drinks, a $30 bottle of wine, and my diabetic grandmother had a $5 soup for dinner. However, the service and wine selection was extensive.
Nothing standout, just average.

Pros: waiter service, wines, valet parking

Cons: food, hostess service


 ★★★☆☆ beautiful inside, 
by josehinannrusso at Citysearch 3 Park Side Restaurant 
 September 30, 2008 
I must be the only person who doesn&apos;t like the food, at parkside, but then again if you like fish which i don&apos;t maybe that&apos;s why, the food is so salty that you swell up after you eat, i remember parkside before it was a restaurant i grow up in corona and know what excellent food should tease like, the prices have gone up too but its a beautiful place on the inside with all the waiters in black tie. i never have to wait for a table maybe because we go early, but on the few times we didn&apos;t we never had to wait. If only the food was like it use to be, but i guess they have a new cook

Pros: place is beatuiful,

Cons: food too saltie


 ★★★★★ BEST ITALIAN FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
by ZOOLANDER212 at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 August 08, 2008 
ITS THE BEST RESTAURANT, I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT BY MY SISTER AND THEN I TOOK MY HUSBAND THERE, HIS FAMILY AND EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. ITS NOT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS. PEOPLE HERE ARE COMPLAINING THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS, AND THE WAIT IS 40 MINUTES, I NEVER EXPERIENCED THE WAIT. THE HOST IS ALWAYS POLITE AND PLEASANT. THE FOOD IS ALWAYS FRESH, THE WAITERS ARE ALWAYS THERE TO SERVE AND THEY ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FORGET ABOUT YOU, THERE ALWAYS THERE. THE PRICES ARE EXTREMELY REASONABLE, TRY THEIR STUFFED ARTICHOKE, TO DIE FOR. AMAZING RESTAURANT. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO GO THERE. ANYONE THAT WE TOOK THERE, ALWAYS GOES THERE AGAIN.


 ★☆☆☆☆ Used too be good! 
by gatitamum at Citysearch 1 Park Side Restaurant 
 July 24, 2008 
Park side is not the same restaurant from a couple of years before. You must make reservation, which is fine with me; but I they make you wait over 30 or 40 minutes!!
They offer valet parking, one parking lot is right next to the restaurant and another around the block; however, when they are full they park your car on the street which incovenience the people of the area. In that case you go and park your car yourself and don&apos;t tip their guys.
The food is not good anymore, they forget about you and really why bother!!! The manager thinks he is a hotshot, so if you are willing to wait when you have a reservation and want to get mediocre food, by all means... GO.

Pros: looks nice and decor

Cons: long wait, find your own parking spot


 ★★★☆☆ Ridiculous wait!! 
by ggrome at Citysearch 3 Park Side Restaurant 
 January 29, 2008 
ive both made reservations and just walked in and let me say that no matter what you do, the wait is way to long! 1 hour or so. did i make reservations or not??? did i tip the manager when i got there to help move things along or not??? why did i wait this long to be seated??? i used to be a regular customer and i mean every weekend! i finally gave up on the place. there are so many places to get better service and so, ciao parkside. i&apos;m done.


 ★★★★★ EXCELLENT ITALIAN FOOD 
by Jess1243567778 at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 January 22, 2008 
Parkside is BY FAR, one of the best italian restaurants in Queens. I am Italian and have been eating Italian food&amp;at Italian restaurants since I was a little girl, and I must say this is one of the best! I went here on my first date with my husband, and was extremely impressed. Yes, you do have to make a reservation and it is usually crowded, but it&apos;s well-worth the wait. Very nice people, great staff, and very reasonable prices. I&apos;ve yet to find another place with such amazing food for such a reasonable price. We had appetizers, dinner, and coffee for about 60 dollars. Beat that.

Pros: great prices

Cons: none


 ★★★★☆ A Queens restaurant that&apos;s good looking and serves good food 
by mzx380 at Citysearch 4 Park Side Restaurant 
 October 26, 2007 
Parkside is a great Italian restaurant. It&apos;s hard to find restaurants like this in the borough of Queens. Usually you have to make trips out to the city for places this nice looking. Went there with a friend for lunch to celebrate his engagement (I was recommended this place by a friend) we were both floored how nice looking it was. The service was top notch and got us our orders right away. Food was hearty Italian, they didn&apos;t get ambitious with the flavors so they were very old school. All in all, this a great restaurant that&apos;s convenient to get to, find parking and have a great Italian meal in a nice place that won&apos;t break your wallet.

Pros: food, ambience, service

Cons: funny smell when you first enter


 ★★★★★ Go Park Side!!! 
by fdaco at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 October 05, 2007 
If you&apos;re a met fan and you enjoy good food, then this is the place you want to be!!!!! I went there with my family last Sunday and was seated next to none other than David Wright, who apparently just strolled in after the game for a quick bite. I was told by other people that were dining there that this is very common being that the restaurant is located so close to Shea stadium. So Cool, not to mention the food was delicious!

Pros: Food, atmosphere


 ★★★★★ A warm welcome 
by fatboyslim at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 September 17, 2007 
I was in town visiting a few weeks ago and some of my buddies insisted that we go to the Park Side for dinner. I wasn&apos;t too crazy about the idea since earlier that day my flight was delayed an hour, i was tired and Park side was about 30 minutes away from where we were staying. Nonetheless, I agreed to go, and I must say I&apos;m glad I did. We got there pretty late, but were warmly welcomed, seated right away, and not rushed through dinner. The food was ample and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Pros: Accomodating service, good food!

Cons: There isn&apos;t one in San Diego


 ★★☆☆☆ Disappinting Food 
by gloryglo at Citysearch 2 Park Side Restaurant 
 September 11, 2007 
Went there for the first time 9/7/07. Was told it was a 4 star restaurant where the food was very good. It was not!
I ordered Veal Marsala. Big mistake. Veal was pounded patties sopped in sauce that didn&apos;t have a marsala taste. It was like a plate of soup. No vegetables.
I left half over and didn&apos;t even want to take it home. (Something I always do with a meal I couldn&apos;t&apos; finish) My spouse had Veal Parmegian and had stomach pains all night.
Very noisy and crowded downstairs. Upstairs nice quiet ambience. Nice decor.
Expected a real treat. Would not go there again..

Pros: Nice Decor- Quiet upstairs

Cons: Noisy downstairs, crowded- Food nothing to rave about.


 ★★★★★ Great atmosphere and delectable cuisine! 
by sforstein at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 August 27, 2007 
I&apos;ve lived in queens my whole life and the parkside is by far the greatest italian eating experience that I have had the pleasure of enjoying for nearly 20 years. Very few restaurants have the ability to provide such exquisite food, atmospere, and service like the parkside. Considering the amount of years they have been in service. Every time I go, I make Reservations in advance , or I go in and hang out at the bar to enjoy some good strong drinks while I wait for my table. Trust me when I tell you its worth the wait! You Will Not Eat Anywhere Like This In Queens!! But definitly leave the kids at home. Anyway who wants to hear a crying baby while you try to enjoy their amazing Tiramisu with a nice port. When I&apos;m done I even go and watch the guys play a little bacci ball with my wife....

Pros: Food, Elegant service, Valley parking

Cons: When they run out of apples in the front


 ★★★★★ Best Italian restaurant in Queens!! 
by tgoldbloom at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 August 20, 2007 
I went to Parkside for the first time on Monday night. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. For so many years whenever I wanted good food or to go to a &quot;fancy&quot; restaurant I always went to Manhattan. Well not anymore! We got right in and sat at one of their tables in the garden room which is great if you&apos;re looking for a romantic evening. I had the tilapia stuffed with crabmeat that was just delicious! The portions are huge and the prices were much less than I expected. I will definitly be back:-)

Pros: great service

Cons: none


 ★☆☆☆☆ INSULTING SERVICE FROM THE MANAGER OF PARKSIDE 
by seewalk77 at Citysearch 1 Park Side Restaurant 
 August 13, 2007 
Parkside Restaurant has not only disappointed me, but embarrassed me to a point of no return. Even though a person makes reservations, you still have to wait for about ONE HOUR UNLESS YOU ARE A FAVORITE of the restaurant&apos;s manager, Al. I felt so insulted when they kept asking couples to go ahead of us, when they arrived about 1/2 hour AFTER us without reservations. When we were finally told &quot;you can go upstairs now&quot;, we went unescorted and just stood there waiting to be seated. When our table was finally cleaned up for us, this young Italian couple (which coincidentally were one of the many who were given a table ahead of us) having drinks at another table, were given the table which was being prepared for us. You can only imagine the frustration that we went through that evening. I felt discriminated against, not because of race, instead, because of class...I am a middle class female who is employed at a lawfirm and depends on herself for a living. My friend is a diabetic and was almost at a point of an attack. I dont need to explain medical conditions to anyone at a restaurant. Parkside Restaurant is a very poorly managed restaurant who not only caters to their &quot;favorites&quot;, but does not bother to, at the very least, give their customers some type of courtesy for their troubles, they just continue to insult in more ways than one. As for the food, I can cook better, but we go to restaurants basically for service and to be catered to just like everyone else. We dont go to restaurants to stress out and be insulted. If anyone writes a different review, believe me, it is most definitely written by one of his favored customers.


 ★★★★★ Great atmosphere, ambiance, food, wines 
by ivanworking at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 August 08, 2007 
This restaurant is a wonderful choice for anyone who loves Italian cuisine. Food and wine menus satisfy basic to finicky palates (with prices to match), however, getting in is a problem. I would love to go there more frequently, however, this place is always crowded and reservations from 5 to 9 PM are almost impossible. I recommend trying this place with one other person because it&apos;s easier to get seated. I believe you will enjoy, it&apos;s worth it.

Pros: Great food and wine list.

Cons: Tough to get in


 ★★★☆☆ HOUR WAIT W/ RESERVATIONS/POOR POOR SERVICE 
by leelee5874 at Citysearch 3 Park Side Restaurant 
 May 22, 2007 
My family and friends have grown up the Corona area and we have all been very fond of Parkside until last night. I made reservations for 7:30p (MONDAY) to celebrate a friend&apos;s birthday. Our party consisted of 4 adults and 2 toddlers. When I made the reservation, considering the children and it was a Monday, I figured we wouldn&apos;t have to wait too long, we&apos;d be in/out. Boy were we wrong! We waited 1 HOUR to be seated, remember, we had two toddlers that were hungry. Once we started to complain on how we were the last to be seated, we received comp drinks and bread at the bar. We waited another 20 minutes, complained again, we were told that the table was being cleaned. Now in the ENTIRE place, they were waiting for this ONE TABLE for us to be seated. This to me was unacceptable. Finally we&apos;re seated, waiter took our appetizer and entree orders at the same time. We received our appetizers promptly, great! But then we waited another 1 1/2 hours for our main entrees. By the time, the first dish came out, the kids were asleep (full of bread) and we were ready to go...we asked for everything to be packed and we asked for the manager. This is not the norm with Parkside but I and the others were pretty disappointed that managment was not more considerate enough to let us know of the pending wait since we made reservation PLUS the wait in the kitchen. Did I mention we had two toddlers???? I know Parkside isn&apos;t really kid-friendly but it is a family restaurant. The say the least, I won&apos;t be visiting for a while, that&apos;s how disappointed and angry (and HUNGRY) I was by the end of the night.

Pros: Great Food, Reasonable Prices

Cons: Poor Management, Poor Service


 ★★★★★ The best Italian ever!! 
by jenny680 at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 October 12, 2006 
Delicious. I can&apos;t stop raving about this place to friends. I went there last week and ordered fresh oysters, crab cake, Linguine Vongole and a T-bone steak. All were wonderful. My linguine was cooked to perfection.. left me yearning for more. Prices were incredibly reasonable ... I&apos;;d even pay more to eat there b/c it is so delicious!! DEFINITELY make reservations.

Pros: WONDERFUL FOOD, good value for money

Cons: Must make reservations


 ★★★★★ My new favorite restaurant 
by bebbeface at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 September 04, 2006 
I went to Parkside this past weekend for the second time, and it did not disappoint. The food and service were excellent. The food is excellent, the portions are large, the prices are very reasonable, and the entire staff was courteous and professional. I have absolutely zero complaints. I look forward to my next visit.

Pros: Excellent food, ambience, service and value

Cons: Zero


 ★★★★☆ Don&apos;t bother making reservations 
by tl875 at Citysearch 4 Park Side Restaurant 
 July 17, 2006 
My fiance and I made 9pm reservations and were not seated until after 10pm. Why make reservations if you&apos;re not going to be seated until an hour later? The food was delicious but we were rushed through dinner because they were closing soon (since we were seated an hour later than we should have). They served the salad and the main course together and didn&apos;t even bring the dessert menu. We were looking forward to a nice relaxing meal but by the time we were seated, we were starving and then on top of that, we were rushed.

Pros: food

Cons: wait time to be seated


 ★★★★★ The Best 
by dnjtriolo at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 April 07, 2006 
We love it there. They have great bread and appetizers to start, the greatest seafood risotto and you can never get better veal spedini then there. It is still one of the only authentic Italian restaurants around. Classy waiters and staff.

Pros: Inexpensive, Delicious, Classy

Cons: Small Waiting Area


 ★★★★★ From a Young Girl to a Grown Woman 
by amartre at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 December 27, 2005 
I have been going there for almost 25 years now and I feel like I have grown up there. Great food, wonderful staff and an atmosphere to die for. Great for a casual dinner or wonderful for first dates (I have had many there). You have to have a great glass of wine followed by either a huge bowl of pasta or fish that will melt in your mouth. Dessert can not be missed either and that&apos;s coming from a daughter of a French Pastry Chef. It is Number 1 in my mind and in my heart. Enjoy and Bon Appetite.

Pros: Great Valets, Great Service, Great Wine List


 ★★★★★ Favorite place to dine! 
by sunspot at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 December 13, 2005 
My family and I have been enjoying dinner at this place for years. It is our favorite restaurant. Great food and great service. It is VERY popular, so be sure to make reservations.

Pros: great food, great service, valet parking

Cons: none


 ★★★★★ Exceeded Expectations 
by kedheim at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 December 05, 2005 
This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed! We weren&apos;t! The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food. We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.

Pros: Friendly staff

Cons: Small waiting area


 ★★★☆☆ mediocre 
by gajo at Citysearch 3 Park Side Restaurant 
 September 26, 2005 
we went to this place for my sister&apos;s birthday. she and her family been here before. so she recommended the place. my first time there last night and i thought the food was mediocre. my linguini primavera was blah. i normally don&apos;t do this, but i kept on adding salt and pepper to my dish. everyone at the table agreed that their entree was boring. the place was too loud. i couldn&apos;t hear anything from our table. the bread was cold. the cocktail drinks were watered. the price was too expensive for a meal that tasted &quot;blah&quot;. service was wonderful though!

Pros: valet parking

Cons: crowded, noisy, food was mediocre


 ★★★★★ You can&apos;t go wrong 
by dd16 at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 June 28, 2005 
If you&apos;re looking for excellent food, above-average service, and great prices, this is the place for you. The meal and whole dining experience is incredible, coupled with the charm of the old-time Italian guys playing bocci ball in the park across the street, and the Corona lemon-ice King up the block.

Pros: Food, Service, Valet Parking

Cons: None


 ★★★★★ Parkside is AMAZING 
by astoria01 at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 January 07, 2005 
My boyfriend and I discovered Parkside two years ago and celebrate events from graduating to my birthday (tonight). We loving enjoying the best italian or seafood dishes one can find. Queens is definitely a place that should not be docked. Try living outside your box and take an adventure.


 ★★★★★ Casual Class 
by flittlehouse at Citysearch 5 Park Side Restaurant 
 June 12, 2004 
Parkside is &quot;fancy&quot; enough to bring a date or business client but casual enough and priced right for your weekly &quot;I don&apos;t feel like cooking tonight&quot; dinner.

Pros: Food, Atmosphere

Cons: , Crowded at times


 ★★★★★ The real thing

True sibaritic experiences are not found in Manhattan but in Queens; Manhattan catters to the
American palate while this &quot;boro&quot; has real ethnic and honest places like Park Side. Although not a classic italian, I dare you to find seafood fresher, juicier and plumpier like the one that is served amongst fetuccini, inside raviolis or SIMPLY RAW LIKE THE BEST OYSTERS I EVER TRIED INCLUDING all THE PACIFIC RIM AND Half Shell oysters in KW. Tiramisu is special here. For coffee try a cafe romano in a big demitase cup, with its sugar lined rim and ask &quot;Epi&quot; to do the fireworks on it: a touch of Sambucca and the ignition of lemon peel (and human nails, sometimes). For the best seat, ask for the &quot;Manuel Vargas table&quot;, looking at the garden where the tomatoes are harvested.

Pros: Seafood, Price, Parking

Park your trench coat at the coat check and be prepared for fine dining, expert / attentive table service and a delectable cuisine. Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms). Great food at REASONABLE prices, makes for an evening that can&apos;t be beat! Want to impress? Definitely go here!!! NOTE: Plan ahead, make a reservation and arrive early - parking is tight in the area - valet service is available if all else fails! Enjoy!!!

Pros: Great Food, Great Service, Great Atmosphere

Cons: Tight Area Parking

This is a beautiful restaurant. I was hesitant about going because I didn&apos;t think it could be that great since it was in Queens but I was totally thrown off when I arrived. The owner is very friendly and accomodating for reservations way in advance.

Pros: valet parking, romantic, Service

To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe. The well mannered, pleasant staff that &quot;Tony&quot; has in his employ. You are treated just like royality. There is nothing more pleasant than that. The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you&apos;ll need no more. I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money. When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can&apos;t say any more, it a place you&apos;ll never forget If you never go, you&apos;ll miss &quot;A Meal&quot; of your life time

Pros: Great Food, Wonderful Staff, Great Cooks

Cons: Need Reservations :(, l

Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best. The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful. It is expensive but well worth the money. If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can&apos;t seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.

Pros: Terrific food, Friendly staff, Great wine list

Cons: Small parking lot, Expensive

View all the celebrities on the walls while eating some good italian food served by professional well-dressed waiters. Reservations should be made. This place is romantic, quiet, and dimly lit- food is very good also.

If you want great food, service and decor for a very reasonable price, you must go to Park Side. Everything I&apos;ve eaten has been incredibly tasty. Never a bad dish. A must try is the shrimp and lobster risotto. All other risotto pales in comparison. The crab cakes are the best I&apos;ve had anywhere. I&apos;m always shocked when the bill comes because it&apos;s so inexpensive. Be prepared for a semi-Sopranos crowd, but I think it just adds to the ambiance. It&apos;s usually hard to get a reservation at a normal hour so call way in advance or be prepared to eat at 5:00 or 10:00.

Pros: great food, valet parking, inexpensive

Cons: NOTHING!


 ★★★★★ The Best

Go here. Classy, inexpensive, high quality. I must say if you like Italian you will feel like you are sitting in the Godfather here. It is so so so good and so classic.

Pros: THE BEST, Inexpensive, Never Leave Hungary

Cons: In Corona

Parkside is situated in the small section left of Corona that keeps it&apos;s Italian roots. With Bocce (sp) Ball playing across the street and the amazing Lemon Ice King of Corona, Parkside is great. The dishes are reasonably priced and the restaurant is very nice instead. The Veal Sorrentino is great and so are the seafood dishes. Don&apos;t knock Queens. Parkside rules.

Parkside stands the test of time, I used to be a regular Friday night customer 20 years ago and the food, service and decor was superb then and to my delight is just as wonderful today! My compliments to both Owner and Staff!

I have eaten there for 20 years and never had less than a very good meal and service to match. The menu is solid and the specials are always delicious. Try the crab cakes you wont be able to compare them!

Pros: consistent quality, variety of specials

Cons: a little loud
