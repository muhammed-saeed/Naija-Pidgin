 Slow and Poor Service, Squeezy Seats and Normal Food~ 20 March, 2011 Was here for dinner with my family. We have passed by this place many times but never come in for meal and so we decided to give it a try. As it was near dinner time, the cafe was quite crowded.

The seating arrangement of the cafe was &quot;unique&quot;. Seats and tables were so closed to one another and you could easily knock against the tables on your left or right. Perhaps they were trying to maximise the seating place to have more diners! The chairs were wooden or with no backing and low level sofa which make seating uncomfortable. Because of the closeness of the seats and tables, it was very noisy as you could hear people talking all round you and so the ambience was a letdown. We felt like &quot;sardine&quot; squeezing to eat.

Foodwise. Average, nothing unique or special though the portion was quite generous. We ordered 2 sets of Fish and Chips (which came with a drink, soup of the day and a dessert which was a small piece of not sweet honey dew at $9.80 per set). The fish were quite bland and tasteless but were quite well prepared. Crispy outside and tender inside. The french fries that came with it were big and crispy too while the so called salad coleslaw were normal. The soup was just fine and the coffee with milk and lemon tea were far too sweet!

I ordered a Black Pepper Chicken Chop set. Like the same as above with the side dishes, the chicken chop nonetheless was quite well done. Maybe the black pepper sauce was good, the chicken chop was well marinated and cooked nicely. My set was $11.80.

On our table (table no. 23), the 2 bottles of sauces were used up and empty and were not restocked. After indicating to the crew for that where they &quot;act blur&quot; not to see, we have no choice but to take the ones 2 tables away from us that was empty. Staff were not attentive to these details.

Service? Poor and slow. As it is a self-service cafe where you will need to order and pay and helped yourself with the apettisers (while the main course would be served to you by the crew). The staff manning the counters were slow and unfamiliar with the keying in of the orders. As such, within a short time, a long queue was formed up as they had to call for the supervisor or manager to come and assist them to key in the orders or swapping of credit cards. (I noticed the manager was having dinner at the side table and had to come to and from a few times to help the counter staff) It also took quite a while for my Chicen Chop to be served to me (as my family members were 75% done up eating their Fish and Chips)

Next, they have this Citibank Credit Card promotion where you could enjoy 10% discount should your order is above $30. However, when I gave my card to the staff, they were unfamiliar with it and tried a few times to &quot;swap&quot; it through the card reader but failed. Then they told me my card was having &quot;something wrong&quot; which was not possible as before coming here, I was using it to pay for my grocery items at the nearby departmental store and have also paid up for the credit amount and so the problem of exceeding my credit limit was invalid.

When I asked them to retry again with another card reader, they were impatient and told me it would be the same result and need not try. As such, you can guess that no discount was given to me (not my fault or my card&apos;s fault) as I use another card to pay for it for I do not wish the long queue behind me to wait much longer time for the ordering. Well, I am not hard up for the discount but they were depriving me from the discount without trying my card.

In addition, when the staff brought us our main course, they were facially &quot;expressionless&quot; and we have to thank them for the service but no response or &quot;you are welcome&quot; were heard.

Well, my first experience here was &quot;horrible&quot; and you can bet that I will not be coming here again for normal food but uncomfortable dinning experience and poor and slow service. So do take note should you decide to give it a try here!

(to be fair to them, my experiences at other branches were quite ok like the one at GE Building or at Harbour Front)

 ok for a simple lunch 04 December, 2010 A regular lunch option I normally find myself once a month or so. Most recently on Friday, and I tried the superburger for something different. Ordering with some uncertainty as I&apos;m not sure Han&apos;s will be the best choice for a burger, but it&apos;s actually quite good. A tasty beef patty, well cooked and with an egg and some salad/coleslaw and fries. Previously I stick with the daily specials like curry chicken, beef stew, etc and they&apos;re always ok considering the pricing, only a small margin above food court but nicer atmosphere. Can be quite crowded at lunch so might need to queue, but can usually find a table as turnover is relatively quick. Overall I&apos;d recommend for a simple weekday lunch with reasonable range of choices both local and western.

 Han Enough (Had Enough) 05 August, 2009 Han&apos;s one of my PAST favourite restaurants has now deteriorated to that of a occasional patronage kind of restaurants.

Here&apos;s the review of my favourite dish @ Han&apos;s: Pork Congee

As simple as this dish might be. Pork Congee actually takes alot of effort and know how in order to accomplish a good congee. First, my idea of a good congee must be one that has fresh cut spring onion to garnish on top of a freshly cooked congee with minced meat and lean meat. At Han&apos;s they prepare this congee pretty well. Although I would give it a 7/10, the way the company has priced the food has left me confused.

I think to the general public we understand the concept of inflation and deflation. Simple economic terms that shape our financial world. I am not a self professed expert in the field. 3 Years ago when Han&apos;s was still a nobody, their pork congee was priced @ S$3.80. A year later it became S$4.50(DUE TO INFLATION) never mind that fast forward to 2009 and that same bowl of congee cost a cool S$5.00 This simply left me scratching for logical understanding! All I can derive, profit is more important than the first objective of the provide good and affordable food.

Its not like they added anything to the food nor did they improve the efficiency. Having said that here is the breakdown of the ratings

F/B 6: Better than average congee

Ambience 6: Nothing fantastic

Value 4: Not worth the price you pay for. ITS Singapore styled food in Singapore, not like if we crave for it must pay over the top to get it.

Service 5: As mentioned with previous reviewers, the staff use bare hands to handle some of the food items...

Will I return? Probably NOT~

For all feedback please send it to me so that we can trade information and I can improve! All comments are greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Today: 06 Oct 09

I decided to give Han&apos;s Another go... The pork congee and kopi o~ Not to shabby I must add. The portions were up, the taste was back.. Now, that seems so contradicory to my previous visit!? I guess, the chef was much better this time...

Then again, the service lady has to pick up my order better, sorry aunty, but when I order Pork congee, she thought it was coffee, ham sanwich and tea and lasty pork congee x 2... I don know how that happened..

The Kopi O was alright. But priced @ S$1.30, and having Kiliney just 1min away, I would pick the latter :/

All in all, I decided to up my value points for this review a notch from 4 to 6. F&amp;B;will be upped in this update as well from 6 - 7. I also recommend this place for:

 Cannot make it ..…. 08 April, 2008 

6 April 2008 : I came here for food - the chicken sandwich&amp;Iced Teh-C were fine.

However, i lost my appetite watching the food handler behind the counter grab cucumber slices with her bare hands from a container to put into the display cabinet for the preparation of sandwiches.

I will not return again. Must tries: (?)

 a very nice place with budget price 03 October, 2007 I have read others&apos; comments and I admit that there are quite a number of things to improve. But to me, Han&apos;s has always been a nice place that i&apos;d like to return times after times, especially Han&apos;s Marina Square, which is the place that I&apos;ve come the most times.

First, I wanna emphasize that Han&apos;s was originally a cafe, and now it has extended to serve as a fast food restaurant as well. And that&apos;s also why bakeries here is a must-try. Their pastries eg. chicken pies, curry puff which are the most popular pastries, are always nice and fresh, well heated and never become too dry as the pastries i tried in some other stores. About the small cakes, i would really love to have either the mini pandan kaya or choc eclair. Pastries n small cakes are around $1.2 only. For cake slices, mango mousse, durian mousse are the best. The price for whole cakes at Han&apos;s is also more reasonable than other cake stores. For drink to go with cake, i&apos;d like to recommend teh-si as this is the thickest and tastiest out of all the similar types (coffee here is rather thin, but if u want it thicker, it is also possible to ask the person who makes it). Previously, price for all coffee and tea was $1, recently, it has been changed to $1.20 due to GST.

The western food here is not bad but nothing special, it cost around $10 for a set meal, which consists of the main course, soup + garlic bread, drink and dessert. And the drink is restricted to tea, coffee, orange juice and ice lemon tea (if you dont wanna pay extra for things like Milo). My advice is to choose ice lemon tea, since it&apos;s freshly homemade everyday by the staff with the dried tea leaves and fresh lemon slices, which gives a great taste. Anyway, at least, you should stay away from the orange juice since it&apos;s made from the concentrate, even though it does not taste too bad. It&apos;s a better choice to have Chinese food after all, because of both the price and taste. U can have a dish from only $5 (congee), to around $6.5-7 (hor fan, bee hoon, mee, a few types of sweet n sour, fried chicken, beef etc). And fried rice with ham, prawn, veggies and egg top at only $6 and that&apos;s my favorite.

The burger here is not a good choice. However, about the super burger, i once asked why they call it like that, and the answer was simply that it is served with salad and french fries (normal burger is served with salad only) and doesn&apos;t mean anything special about the burger, so don&apos;t expect too much and get disappointed hor!

The breakfast sets are egg w sausage/bacon etc and tea/coffee. I think their tuna sandwiches (spicy/mayonnaise) are the best. Remember to ask them to toast the bread a bit longer to make it more crispy.

Beverages are nothing special, except for their various types of float, of which coke float is the type i like best.

I like the space, which leaves a choice of either open or private. The air con is also juz nice. And i like the staff there, they&apos;re not so formal like other places but very friendly. They even know the eating style of each customer (of course the returning ones) like sandwich w no butter or no edges, thick tea, congee without egg or even sterile utensils (lol)

One more thing, a few tables here have movable chair (w the table not so high), so if you are a wheel chair user, it&apos;d be no problem. I myself have seen quite a few ppl with wheel chair dining here, one of which was said to be a regular customer.

Overall i feel very comfortable here. Must tries: curry puff, chiken pie, mini pandan kaya, mango mousse, fried rice, aglio olio I also recommend this place for:

 Ok lah. Not bad. 03 September, 2007 I was scouting around for a place to eat on a sunday night when I pass by this restaurant. I saw the set menu which is quite affordable. In fact, a soup + a main dish + drinks + dessert cost around $10. So I went in.

This is a self service type of restaurant. So you order at the counter but the main dish will serve to you. It is pretty empty at this time and finding a seat is not hard. That is why the queue for ordering is short and food is served pretty fast.

The soup is a cream of chicken and it is warm only. The soup tasted ok but nothing fantastic. The main dish I ordered is chicken chop with mushroom sauce. The chicken is rather tender and nice. Sauce is also quite nice. Then I order the orange juice which is a bad choice. It tastes awful and bland. Should have ordered tea instead. Lastly, the dessert is two pieces of honeydew.

So overall, for a $10 set, I feel quite ok. So if you need a quick decent meal with not much expectation, Han&apos;s is a good choice. I also recommend this place for:

 Dipping standards~ 23 April, 2007 I used to frequent Han&apos;s for their fish and chips; for the simple fact that they&apos;re cheap, yet good. However, as their standards dipped over the years, i stopped patronising them~

However, as we walked past Han&apos;s at its Marina Square&apos;s outlet, we decided to have our dinner there jux to assess the current situation~

The pies on display~

I ordered their Fish and Chips set; for old time&apos;s sake. I realised that their prices are now much lower. For $7.80, i can get the whole set comprising of the fish and chips and all of the above (picture)~

The soup-of-the-day was cream of chicken. Tasted average; a tad diluted though. The lightly toasted bread was buttered with garlic spread which tasted bland. A single piece of honeydew served as dessert and it was rather tasteless. The only saving grace was the orange juice, which was probably straight out of a carton or something.

The fish and chips was still as bad. The fish was seasoned heavily with pepper; perhaps to mask the inferior quality of the fish they use. Gone were the days when their fish and chips was almost like their house specialty~

Bf got their Chicken Superburger (With Egg)~ Hardly deserving of its name. The supposedly Superburger comprised only of a single chicken patty and a fried egg. Did i mention that it&apos;s only $5?!

He complained that the chicken patty was heavily seasoned with pepper too~ When i tried it, i thought that it had this taste that strangely resembled shao xing wine~ O_o&quot;

On our way out of the restuarant, we saw this table of 4 who were pushing the food around their plates before 1 of them blurted out, &quot;Eh ur one nice onot? Mine not nice leh!&quot;

There&apos;s no service charge and the bill summed up to only $12.80 but we probably wun return any time soon! I also recommend this place for:
