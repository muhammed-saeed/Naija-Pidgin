My husband and I were in Franklin on Saturday and decided to try the Motor Co. Grill for dinner. The food was excellent. We both had the special Chicken and Biscuits. The price was right and the food was just like homemade (if not better). I paid the check totaling $19.66 with my check card. BUT, to my surprise, when I reviewed my checking account statement, I had been charged $24.57. What was the extra $4.91 for? I think this is an under handed way to do business. Was this a fee for using a credit card, an error on their part, or just taking advantage of an out of town visitor? I think when you sign authorizing a specific amount, you should be charged that amount and no more. I am thoroughly disappointed in this hidden charge. It isn&apos;t the amount I&apos;m upset about, but the sneaky way it was done. I&apos;ll think twice about visiting this Grill again.

Bill Stike, Owner at Motor co. grill, responded to this review June 23, 2010 To all of our Debit card customers I would like to assure you that we have no additional hidden fees or charges attached to any of our transactions. If you are using a debit card you may see an additional autherization to allow for a tip to be added to ensure that there are sufficient funds in the account. If you choose to leave a cash tip your card will process with only the original amount of your check. Autherizations on your cards happen instantly but, processing takes a minimum of 24 hours or over the weekend up to three days. We hope that this clears up any confusion over this issue.

This is , without a doubt, the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. The food was awful, the service was terrible and I was embarrassed to have taken friends there!!!!!!
Go ANYWHERE but here!!

My wife and I were in Franklin and enjoyed the annual Folk Festival events. It was great to see a community getting together to celebrate what America is all about. But, when we decided to eat lunch at Motor Co. Grill the&quot;wheels came off&quot;! We stood at the entrance beside the&quot;Please Wait to Be Seated&quot;sign for at least 15 minutes with no response from the staff even as they passed us by. After finally being seated, we did get our drinks quickly and it was a good thing. After ordering it was about 45 minutes before we got our food, Chicken Tender basket and a Philly Steak Sandwich. Way too long for just so so food. There was a sign posted on the wall that said they were not a fast food restaurant that quality was their goal. Well, they were right about one thing....they are not a fast food restaurant. After eating, we had to ask for our check to put the&quot;icing on the cake&quot;. I would not recommend this establishment. It may have been friendly outside with the celebration going on, but that stopped at the door.

I believe the ownership has changed this year. It is a great place for ambiance. That old 60 soda shop. Burgers, shakes and malts are great. Prices have gone up, and servings have gotten smaller.

Just had todays&quot;Specials&quot;a Turkey wrap and Cup of loaded potato soup. Flavor was good.

Value was not. I got a 6&quot;wrap with a lonely slice of turkey in it, and about 1/3 cup of soup for $10.
