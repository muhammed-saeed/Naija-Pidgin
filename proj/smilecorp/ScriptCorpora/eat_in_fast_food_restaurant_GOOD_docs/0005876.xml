 I Can&apos;t Get a Job, Because I&apos;ve Never Had a Job 
 

 Image Source 
 
I&apos;ve never really had a job.

I&apos;ve been an intern, camp counselor, teaching assistant, and grader, but it&apos;s all been very seasonal, very temporary. I&apos;ve never worked anywhere real, like a restaurant, clothing store, or movie theater. And sometimes I think I never will.

Why? I don&apos;t have any experience. 

During my year off from school, I tried and tried and tried to get hired anywhere, but I heard that same line over and over again: &quot;We want someone with experience.&quot; I couldn&apos;t wait tables because I&apos;d never waited tables before. Or sold clothes. Or groomed pets.

It got me wondering—how the heck am I supposed to get my foot in the door? You need experience to work, and work to gain experience, and the whole thing sounds very Catch-22. Is there some magical species of human I&apos;m unaware of, one that&apos;s born with such inherent skills as dog-grooming and restaurant-tray-carrying?

Once, though, I managed to get hired knowing practically nothing. It was the camp counselor job, and I&apos;d never been so much as a CIT, nor did I know anything about computer programming, a subject I would be teaching children for eight weeks.

How did I get the job? The camp was desperate. Horribly, horribly understaffed. My friend, who had worked there the year before, turned me on to the opportunity.

So, I suppose the lesson is this—it&apos;s really, really hard to find work without experience, unless your employer is really, really desperate.

 Have you ever been turned away for lack of experience? How do you get your foot in the door?

maybe your lack of verbs may be contributing to your lack of work.

My dad&apos;s a vet, and I&apos;ve loved animals from day one, so I basically grew up in his practice - so basically any animal job under the sun is mine, as long as it doesn&apos;t require a degree. Every interview I&apos;ve gone to for a veterinary or animal related job, I&apos;ve gotten a job offer. But when I originally tried to get a job (non animal), before my dad&apos;s clinic had an actual opening, no one wanted me because of the no experience thing. It sucks, for sure!

Yup, that&apos;s how I got turned down from a job I really wanted 4 times XP . I always make it to the final two though.

trade/vocational schools???. pick a trade, learn it and stick to it. i take trade/vocational schools as college, cheap alternative to college. dont give up though because theres always people worse, who have absolutely NO experience at anything plus times are tough right now. work experience is one thing but sincerity and &quot;that little something something&quot; will get you hired as well.

You&apos;re missing a &quot;get&quot; or something along that line in your title. 

... this reminds me how unqualified I am for things. But it may involve getting angry at angry customers until I decide to shank them with a mannequin&apos;s arm or scale the roof and pour hot oil on cars going through the drive through. 
I think I could be qualified to make websites for anybody who don&apos;t need secure pages but nobody&apos;s looking or they want all the bells and whistles *thinks about hurting idiots with bells and whistles*... I should take an anger management class or stress class.

I agree not having working experience makes it hard for you to get hired, but I believe there are certain things that employers do look at, sincerity, skills (like language), if you know you are lacking experience, work hard on other aspects and be positive, just remember employers won&apos;t believe in you if you don&apos;t believe in yourself

Start out as the low man on the totem pole in some sort of corporation and work your way up. If not, try temp work that is perhaps temp to hire. If that doesn&apos;t work, get certified through a local college in SOMETHING. Most community colleges offer a certificate for a variety of careers, from computers to business to hospitality.

Sadly, I am discovering much the same thing. And I have even had three jobs! All you can do is apply at places where you have friends. &quot;Knowing somebody&quot;, while some dislike using that foothold, is the best way to get a job that you want without having had experience. Personally, I&apos;d rather have the guilt of getting the job because of my BFF for a day, than be unemployed for months and months.

I have applied for jobs where I knew people who did/had worked there. I have worked at a high profile jewelery store, in the repair dept (really specialized, you would think) backstage at several different theaters (picking up how to do everything as I went along), at a Guitar Center, and at a phone campaign for my school. I guess the last one I just applied for at the right time, and got, but otherwise, it&apos;s good to have/make connections!

Okay, so I started at the lowest level to get experience: Fast Food. I started at Pizza Hut, went on to Dominos, then finally at Sheetz. Everytime I got a job, I would get paid more and more. So basically my advice is this: work the shittiest of shit jobs for 3 months minimum, then it will give you enough experience for the next job. Usually the shitty Fast Food jobs are always willing to hire, mostly because it&apos;s such a shitty job that people are always quitting. Hey, it&apos;s what got me started.

T_T so true. I keep getting turn down from jobs I apply too x_X

If people don&apos;t have experience, why can&apos;t they teach us? We&apos;re not born to be expert at first.

It won&apos;t take long to teach people, unless they really have a very low low IQ.

Use all the contacts you know (EVERYBODY) to get to know about a job opening, refer you etc. Networking works best and cold calling - find companies you are interested in working for and let them know you are interested. This shows initiative and willingness to work. Voluntary work is also a good option for it gives you what you need - experience.


good luck

However whilst looking for work I am always trying to improve my qualifcations and go on any course avaliable to better myself.

I thought u said u never had a job, anything that u do outside of a home means a job, unless u didnt get paid for those things that u did up above that u wrote about, anyways right now the economy sucks so its going to be real hard to find a job so thats why people are turning u down, plus it might not be that ur not expericance but thats the excuse they give u sense they have nothing else better to say...goodluck finding a job.

Yes, apply for a junior position to gain experience, then move on. Being hands-on is vita l for newbies.

Go somewhere, start working. . Eventually, they will hire you.

I think we&apos;ve all been through that dilemma. Does your school have a website where companies post job openings? I believe Monster Jobs also has a student section. Those positions you held should really count for something though. Anyway, just keep looking and you&apos;ll find something eventually. And keep in mind that even entry level jobs have a lot of competition right now.

Reminds me of my first attempts at getting into retail. I went when I was 16, they refused to hire me on the basis that they only hire 17+ (reason I was told later is that to sell the R/M rated games movies you have to be 17). Go back at 17, they refuse to hire because I didn&apos;t have experience. I ended up flipping burgers for a few months, tried again and they hired me because I then had experience (at a formal job).

I m having that problem right now, I have been out of work for 6 months. All I have ever done is taught swimming lessons and been a life guard. 7 years of it. I had a little space of time in there where I worked at a coffee shop (they were desperate). I have been dropping my resume off everywhere for the last 6 months, fast food, retail, anywhere that has a sign on the door saying they are hiring. I have not received a single call back. Not one. I am not an idiot, I know how to stock a shelve, I know how to carry a tray and I can handle money and a cash register. Hell I can dress a window, its not rocket science. I still am yet to receive a call. Going out looking again this weekend. It&apos;s just so depressing.

Sadly, the two ways you get jobs is either through your connections or their desperation. Just for a summer job, I applied at over 30 locations and only got one callback. They were desperate. However, they liked what they got.

The economy probably has something to do with it. Just keep looking. I hate to say it yet but if you haven&apos;t applied to McDonald&apos;s yet, you aren&apos;t trying hard enough.
