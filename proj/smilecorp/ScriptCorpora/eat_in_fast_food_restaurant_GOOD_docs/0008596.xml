Tier V Unemployment: Extension Shot Down Once More, Here We Go Again
 By Victor Hatley on December 1, 2010, 6:10 am 

 
 Well, they’re at it again. And just as it was before, the Republican Oppositionists have shot down another chance for the unemployed to have something, anything. This time it denies them a decent, comfortable Holiday season…and just maybe a few little things under the tree. Yesterday, our Senate failed to pass a measure that would have extended the current deadline, which by the way, expired at midnight last night, through the the upcoming year.



No One Really Expected This Measure To Pass

Senator Reed (D-R.I.) asked that lawmakers pass this quickly to avoid delays of benefits to recipients, but the support wasn’t in the Senate. Apparently now, even a few Democrats are opposing the expense, $56.4 billion, which would be added to the deficit. Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), raised the objection to the bill, and chided the Democrats for the last minute attempt at passage, but Reed responded“It’s unfortunate we cannot move this bill. We will try again.”

And While We’re Pointing Fingers

Reed and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) related the $56.4 billion extension with the 10-year, $700 billion cost of the Bush era tax cuts. They lamented that the benefits extension won’t be a long-term project and it should be categorized as emergency spending, due to the fact that it is economic stimulus. Reed said that the the debt we incur by making permanent the extension of the Bush era tax cuts“a huge structural change”where the budget is concerned.

 

 

An Alternative Was Offered

Brown did offer one solution, a yearlong alternative which would use the unspent or unobligated federal funds. Reed had a problem with this though, he objected to this proposal and said,“if you burrow down into those funds, they are from a category of programs that could be spent to help the economy move forward.”Senator Brown pleaded that lawmakers sit down and get together on a measure instead. All the while the last hours were ticking away for long-term unemployed who have used up their normal 26 weeks worth of state benefits and who could get up to 99 weeks. Once again the oppositionists strike.

Thanks to the mercy of friends, I could eat on Thanksgiving; a neighbor gave a some groceries the week before. I love their kindness, but I really need to get a job. I ran out of unemployment in October. My mind draws a blank trying to figure out what else could I do to get hired. I may take a page from the guy’s notebook and walk with a sign around my neck “hire me; I’m an honest worker” and walk the sidewalks of Manhattan.

If Obama had any BALLS, xtending UE for all would be a non-issue.

Since he obviously doesn’t have any, I am going to send Obama a pair of [tennis] BALLS for Christmas.

The Dems should have nominated the Hildebeast. She is a shrewd, calculating tart who would make Boehner and McConnell wet their pants.

Everyone who can afford it….. send your BALLS to the White House. The commander-in-chief needs your help!

@ RepublicansVictoryParty–“There are plenty of jobs at fast food restaurants, horse stables and topless bars. Take a job at one these places until your situation improves, and stop asking for a handout.

There will be no further extensions, and that’s final!!”

First of all, I find it hard to believe that you have a job because your comments are completely UNEDUCATED. It is nowhere near“final”that there will not be further extensions so you might want to read up a little more on that.

Second, take a job at a topless bar? That is just disturbing. Would you also recommend becoming a prostitute or drug dealer?

I am not quite sure where you live but for the majority of us it isn’t an option to go work at a“horse stable”.

And a fast food restaurant, I can tell you that although it is clear you aren’t too overqualified to work at a fast food restaurant (or horse stable or topless bar for that matter) most of us cannot get a job at a fast food restaurant because we are too OVERQUALIFIED.

Late breaking news on MSNBC: The Republadouche’s decided to take their greed one step further and write Harry Reid (THEIR LEADER) a letter implying they will hold American’s livelyhood hostage as well as any other bill that really matters, until their trivial tax cuts are put through. This in fact will actually backfire on them. A 20+ year Senator didn’t get to the top and stay there by being bullied around by the new Nazi party.

 Davey says: December 1, 2010 at 4:21 pm 
Most long term unemployed think they should be entitled to endless benefits. One of their favorite sayings is“we lost our jobs through no fault of our own”. They expect working taxpayers to continue funding their free paychecks for YEARS at a time. Well even if it’s not your fault that you lost your job, it’s not MY fault, either. Why should hard working people be expected to keep funding the payments on and on? Go out and find some kind of honest work, even if it pays less than your used to making!
 Monty says: December 1, 2010 at 4:40 pm 
@Davey–again another secure, employed person who hasn’t the empathy to know what it would feel like to be in a helpless, unemployed position. I understand your concerns as a‘tax paying citizen”, I too myself as a hard working individual felt your same sentiments, until my company (while continuing to pay their top corporate elite) decided to downsize the people whose work put them where there are. Extending unemployment benefits is a hard call…..but you can’t just turn your back on your fellow men in need. What we need is some security in our economy so companys will start hiring again. I truly hope your job is as“secure”as you must think…but don’t forget…the boss really feels anyone is replaceable, and I suggest you continue to say your prayers at night….that it is not You,
 megan says: December 1, 2010 at 4:47 pm 
That’s OK! I will say for those whom are saying you are paying for the unemployed just remember! you will never be able to stop welfare and housing for all the inmates in jails. you will fund them with your hard earned money! forever! bitch about that! there aint a dam thing you can do! when EBT cards are being used at strip clubs and casinos!
its your money honey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!lol
 Bailey says: December 1, 2010 at 4:48 pm 
@ Davey–I haven’t read anything where anyone says that they are entitled to“endless benefits”. Hopefully you’ll remember this high horse you’re sitting on right now if ever you find yourself in the same situation. Do you feel the same way about social security, medicare, food stamps, welfare, etc.? Or are you just angry about those that are unemployed and are receiving unemployment benefits?
 Jeff says: December 1, 2010 at 5:48 pm 
Folks, I wasnt going to join this heated debate but I feel I must. I’m a 99′er Im 45 and I have worked ever since i was a kid @ my parents business and always had a career. Let me tell anyone that I have lost everything I own. I have sent out 3,000 resumes over the last two years, Ive even paid a company to redo
my resume&amp;cover letter to see if that was the
problem, still no luck..I decided to take my life. now im just waiting to die.

Thanks America–what a dream
 Smithy says: December 1, 2010 at 7:17 pm 
Jeff,
Don’t give up, things will eventually get better. People will finally see how we got into this mess, why we are still in it, and actually do something about it. Unfortunately, letting the tax cuts expire will not do anything to create jobs. I say this because they are in effect now, and we do not see job creation, do we? Companies hire when there is a demand for services, believe it or not by stopping benefits for millions of families (the majority of which paid into the system for years) demand for services will go down. For over a decade the yearly income for working families has been stagnant, while the salary of those who make over $250,000.00 a year have been rising, so what are they doing with their money? Hiring employees or lining their pockets? I really don’t see how going back to the rates that were present under Clinton will hurt the rich. I can see how stopping the loopholes they enjoy that shipped manufacturing jobs overseas can (both parties are at fault). Jeff, don’t think you are alone, many of us are struggling to keep a roof over our heads. My husband and I work paycheck to paycheck and struggle financially. I shudder to think what would happen to us if one of us became unemployed again, could not find a job, and then lost the small paycheck that would only put food on the table. We both have degrees, and make less than $50,000., but are thankful we have jobs. My husband is 63 and was laid off 3 years back, and then got cancer. We spent our savings and ran up cards to save our house (he now works as a custodian and does any carpentry job during his spare time, not something he planned at this time in his life…he’s 63!!). I bring home less than $1,500 monthly teaching. We have a son in college who lost loan money because of our lousy credit report, a daughter who is mentally ill that owes school loans, and another who is a junior in high school. All of my kids are hard workers and it breaks my heart that I can not help them much. Most of these posters who belittle the unemployed, just have not experienced how life-changing it can be losing a few paychecks. Just remember you are not alone, and don’t do anything out of desperation, hang in there with the rest of us who are scared too.

What happened to basic humanity? No one knows what goes on behind closed doors so who are we to judge anyone? Have you naysayers ever had a grown man weep on your shoulder because he lost his job and now his home and has no where to go with his wife and children? Have you driven down the street and noticed the increased numbers of the homeless begging for a chance? Have your children come home from school upset because their best friend is moving because his/her dad lost his job and their house? I guess it is easier to point fingers and think the worst of people because to think of someone going hungry or a sick person not being able to afford medication or a child around the age of your own son or daughter sleeping in a car because they have no home would be to hard to bare. Imagine if we all acknowledged the degree of suffering that is going on right here in America!!!! I know it is scary but we have to accept it. People ARE hurting AND suffering and no matter how many people turn a blind eye to it the fact of the matter will not change. If Congress will not do their job then we need to step up and do whatever we can for our brothers and our sisters!!!!!!
 acompass? says: December 1, 2010 at 8:01 pm 
My thought is your conscience is your guide. To those who abuse the system, shame on you, you are the reason for this debate. For those who need to keep a roof over their head and feed children, hang in there and look for options. I’m an independent and believe the government has no choice but to pass an extension. With 5 unemployed to 1 job opening there isn’t much of a choice. We also know that unemployment money gets fed right back into the system, not in a savings account. It’s a crappy situation. I do applaud the debate in congress because it makes one think that our prosperity must come with hard work.
 acompass? says: December 1, 2010 at 8:09 pm 
BTW, I don’t like freebies, however, I don’t see much of a choice.
 Ryan says: December 1, 2010 at 8:59 pm 
So if the Congress does not pass extensions and a Tier 5 therefore
going by an estimate of 2,000 per month Welfare (if every benefit is applied for and approved )- 1620 max per month of unemployment in NY that gives a difference of $380
380 * 15 million unemployed produces a result of 5,700,000,000 more that the Federal government will be spending

COOL

Note
See in NY if the UI check is more than 302/ week , one does not qualify for Welfare

Maybe now the Repubs and Dems will work together and force companies to stop the practice of“Unemployed Need Not Apply”/“Must Be Employed To Apply”
Second there are more than 5 applicants for every opening
14.6 million unemployed
5 + million 99ers
5 + million under employed
People need help 500 + applicants for each opening nobody really stands a chance of getting hired. Company selects 25 applicants out of 500 for an interview. For those that got selected the odds just greatly improved, but it’s still a long shot. Now 3possible 4 are lucky enough to get a second interview, but even that does not guarantee anything since the company may decide to throw out the list and start over or not hire at all

The Republicans trashed the American economy with their Southern brand of trailor ignorance and now should have to pay for it through unemployment! I believe in paying a little more in taxes so the North can stay highly educated with the best schools. just look at how ignorant and poorly educated the former Conferderate states remain to this day!

 Oolana35 says: December 2, 2010 at 2:52 am 
I do have the qualifications to work with the Federal Government, as I was an employee with them for 17 years prior to the evaporation of my job. I have been trying to get back in for the last 2 years and they have found every reason not to hire me back (could it be that I was making a decent salary and they do not want to pay me it, or anything close to it again???). I have three manila file folders filled with job postings, applications and my resume that I have sent for these vacancies (and those are the just the ones I saved). I have interviewed many times, but I was an employee with a prior salary history and an established grade step. They just do not want to reinstate me as they will have to consider my prior position in order to determine my salary. It is the same in the private sector. Who are you kidding? So the next time you suggest getting a job with the Federal Government, think again….or with anyone for that matter. A lower paying job you say? My resume gets tossed in the trash before they even read my name at the top due to my past salary history, which is always required when applying for work. Get a clue! Do you think for a minute that I want to live on unemployment and pretend that my career did not exist? That must be crack you are smoking, or you are just plain stupid.

Hey Jeff,

Me too. I’ve worked most of my life. I’m 51 and everything I’ve owned has been parceled off. Been out-of-work for nearly two years. In that time, I’ve lost my best friend- my mom. My mother-in-law, and father-in-law. Oh yeah, my place too. One good thing, my divorce was finalized. I can’t rap, too fat to work the pole. I’ve moved in with my daughter, and I sell homemade soul dinners, to hustle up some cash. Thank God I can cook.

Things will get better. There is value in the valley.

You Democrats really are morons. Which part of no more money left don’t you get? The simple fact is this, the DEMON RATS stole 1.2 trillion (with interest) from the middle class in the Stimulus Bill. They spent this money on their union buddies and tunnels for turtles. Not to mention cocaine for monkeys. Why don’t you go picket the nearest Teachers Union and ask them to give some of that money back for your unemployment. The Republicans have asked time and time again to take unemployment extension funds from unspent stimulus. Every one of you who votes Democrat deserves to be unemployed.
 Groovy says: December 3, 2010 at 7:54 am 
WASHINGTON—The nation’s unemployment rate climbed to 9.8 percent in November, a seven-month high, as hiring slowed.

Employers added only 39,000 jobs last month, a sharp decline from the 172,000 created in October. The weakness was widespread. Retailers, factories, construction companies, financial firms and the government all cut jobs last month.

Private companies—the backbone of the economy—created 50,000 jobs. That was down significantly from the 160,000 private-sector jobs created in October and was the smallest gain since January.

With hiring so weak, the unemployment rate rose from 9.6 percent to 9.8 percent. The jobless rate has now topped 9 percent for 19 straight months, the longest stretch on record.
 demetri says: December 3, 2010 at 9:25 am 
The reason they would not vote the fast track to extend unemployment (aside from thwarting the Democratic party) is because they want to tie extending the unemployment to keeping the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. And why would that be? Because they ARE the wealthy!! It’s like voting to continue to give them more money. The next thing you know, they’ll be voting themselves raises. Now THAT’S what is important to them, their money, the management of their wealth and their friends’ wealth. They could care less about the people in this country who are suffering so long as everything remains status quo or improves for them; and of course, what President Obama is another Republican who posed as democrat to get elected.( What a real shame it is to be an American, watching our country during a Depression starve by the 45 plus million, and the government takes their “ Vacation”. Did you know that: ” The Unemployment Act of 1970 ” was signed into law that any state which has an unemployment rate of 7.5 % percent or higher will continue to receive unemployment compensation indefinitely.

When you look at counties in Europe and the rioting that takes place…they riot because they may have a small portion of their income taken away…and they also riot in fear of having their human rights taken away and becoming another Unites States of America.

* You collect up to 4 1/2 years unemployment of 93% your yearly income.
* Double pay on each holiday… plus, two months each year double pay for summer vacation.
* Double pay for each member of non-working family member i.e; wife and children etc.
* Continued Education is Free.
* No property tax if you only own 1 home.
*Full-time hours per week worked: 25-35.

You know what America…you can keep people like John Boehner GOP president who fights to never give any extension to the unemployed…but you can never take away the fact that”The American Government Kills American Citizens through starvation and homelessness…the American government is built on Fascism, SLAVERY and OCCUPANCY”

But there is one thing you can do…

You may be able to get Christmas Bonus, the one-off tax-free 10 payment made before Christmas. This is normally paid automatically to those customers getting a qualifying benefit in the qualifying week and who meet the residency conditions.

Who is eligible?
To get a Christmas Bonus you must be a resident in the Europe, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, any EEA country, or Switzerland. You must also be entitled to at least one of the following benefits in the qualifying week (normally the first full week of December):

•Attendance Allowance
•Carer’s Allowance
•Constant Attendance Allowance (paid under Industrial Injuries or War Pensions schemes)
•Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance (once the main phase of the benefit is entered after the first 13 weeks of claim)
•Disability Living Allowance
•Incapacity Benefit at the long-term rate
•Industrial Death Benefit (for widows or widowers)
•Mobility Supplement
•Pension Credit – the guarantee element
•State Pension (including Graduated Retirement Benefit)
•Severe Disablement Allowance (transitionally protected)
•Unemployability Supplement or Allowance (paid under Industrial Injuries or War Pensions schemes)
•War Disablement Pension if over State Pension age
•War Widow’s Pension
•Widowed Mother’s Allowance
•Widowed Parent’s Allowance
•Widow’s Pension

All we the American citizens who have worked and paid tax’s ever asked for was for human rights…extension of unemployment, to not be violated through credit checks in order to get a job, or be chaste out of society because of age.

foxbusiness.com/varney are still saying the unemployed does not need more than 6 months UI and that extending more than that make the unemployed lazy and use to Govt handouts. Also that there are jobs out there, not great jobs but jobs available for the unemployed.

This was discussed after today’s new increase that only 39,000 new jobs created in Nov and .2% increase in the unemployment Number.

Bloomberg says long term unemployment will last through 2011 and half of 2012.

If all 50 states + DC have high unemployment and it grew by .2%, what jobs is foxbusiness talking about and not mentioning or describing. Is it the virtual internet job that a mom at home makes $2200/week?

Hey Groovy…(I miss that word..it’s groovy)…I watched that same piece…they are so full of themselves…Rupert Murdock is behind all of it and they are all pretty much brown nosers to him and his cause. It’s just plastic far right wing theatre is all it is…any one of them that doesn’t conform to his ideal doesn’t last…

How stupid can someone–like the one who wrote this article be? I am sick and tired of the crap reported in these junk blobs. THERE WAS NOT TIER V UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENSION THAT WAS SHOT DOWN ONCE MORE…HER WE GO IDIOTS, ONE MORE TIME YOU MISLEAD THE PUBLIC.

WHAT WAS SHOT DOWN LAST WEEK WAS TIER 1-4 EXTENSIONS–NOT TIER 5! THERE WAS NO TIER 5 TO DEBATE AS TIOER 5 HAS NEVER BEEN PASSED.

GET YOUR FREAKING FACTS TOGETHER BEFORE YOU POST GARBAGE.

NO WONDER THE 99ERS CAN NOT GET ANYWHERE.

To Demetri:
You moron- better wash your mouth before you speak about America. Had it not been America you and your Eastern European buddies–you left wing liberals and Communists would not be speking freely today. GET LOST MORON!
 Anna says: December 4, 2010 at 11:33 am 
Yes, Demetri–you would not be speaking today…Get out of your parents basement and go look for a job. Try McDonald’s downtown Athens, Greece. McDonald’s in Thessaloniki, Greece is also hiring, LOL!!

Here a job that should be created:

FOREIGH IMPORT CHECKERS
Let’s put millions of folks to work checking all the crap that we import from foreign countries that are laden with toxic chemicals or are hazardous to our health…recalls upon recalls….

Anna, why do you always assume someone lives in their parents basement? Let me ask you this, how are you paying rent or mortgage without a job or unemployment? How do YOU pay your bills? You can poke at people&amp;dog on anyone that has a different thought so, what is it that makes you so much better than anyone else? Are you living with your parents? Or are you mooching off someone with money?
 Anna says: December 6, 2010 at 10:36 am 
Perhaps you need to read more carefully before you reply to my comments. Of course, you did not bother to read Demitri’s comments to which I replied. Yes, it sounds to me that Demitri is a spoiled brat living with his parents somewhere in liberal Europe bitching about the United States. I work for 4 different temporary agencies right now to make ends meet since I was laid off from my $52,000 salary job. I streched my UI benefits by supplementing my UI checks with the temp agency work. That is how I pay my bills. It would be great if we can get some more Unemploymnent benefits assistance but I would never reach the point that I accuse our country for killing our people. Demetri should explain to us why is it that all Eastern European Countries kicked Communism out–yet, he an some idiots in Greece and elsewhere wish that America becomes the 3rd experiment in Cimmunism. Hell NO!European style Socialism and Neo-COMMS (neo-Communists) will neverbe given a breathing ground in this land of ours. Left wing liberals and Neo-COMMS (as in neo-Communists) can pack their bags and head to Cuba or N. Korea.

Demetri- you can always head to Iran, N. Korea, or Cuba on order to enjoy a higher quality of living and…enchased human rights!!!

I’m sorry Anna, But we have no one to blame but ourselves for the state that our country is in. We the people knew that Bush tanked an oil company&amp;baseball team but yet we voted him into office, We bought into Clinton’s bullshit by showing up on MTV&amp;we knew Obama received funding from countries that support terrorist groups. America is to blame to America’s standings in the world. If you voted for the problem then you are part of the problem! I didn’t read all of is post&amp;I care even less to read all of your posts. The fact is, you alone stated that you work for 4 temp groups which means you are NOT unemployed! You have work! You can make money. So don’t act as if you’re a victim because you have an income. It may not be $52,000 but it’s better than nothing at all! I was unemployed for a long time&amp;now I’m a chef asst. I don’t make a ton of cash, I’m always in pain, I have infections, cuts&amp;burns but I have a job&amp;I’m making an honest buck just like you! So don’t dog on anyone just because they have an opinion that bashes the American public that made our situation the way it is by voting for the lies instead of the truth. Obama was in San Fransisco&amp;said Gay marriage was ok, then he went to the bible belt&amp;said it was wrong&amp;when he was questioned about it, he dodged all the answers that were needed.

Lastly, if America is the best place in the world, why does our country turn it’s back on our own people? Ever hear of EB-5? It’s a proposal being raised in Illinois to bring contracts from foreign countries to bring investors to fund a sports complex. They say it will employ 10,000 Americans. What do the investors have to gain? They will get legalization of their people in our country. So how many people from India will come here&amp;become LEGAL (to follow the contract)&amp;how many people who are already US citizens will be able to hold these steady jobs? We may employ 10,000 US citizens but who’s to say that the jobs wont be sold to the lowest bidder? They can always do what big business does&amp;send out jobs to vendors/temp agencies&amp;then eventually they are hiring illegals to do the jobs of Americans at a lower wage.

How do you think the restaurant business works? I get paid $60 a day. But there’s days I work 12 hours&amp;still, I only get $60. This is our new country, this is our new world&amp;we need to learn to adapt! But to always assume (you did on my posts) that someone lives in their parents basement is just ignorant. Just because someone’s ideas on this country is different than yours, it doesn’t give you the rights to make them look like less than you. How dare anyone stand up for this country when it’s turned it’s back on so many people? If you voted for Clinton, Bush or Obama than you turned your back on America too. I say that because it can all be linked back that far to figure out why we are where we are today.

The banks gave out bad loans then they let them take our houses for bad loans then they give the banks more money people that built this country need work because no new houses being built because no one can afford a bad loan it’s easier for a boss to pick up a Mexican pay no taxes on them then to have an American work they need to create more jobs were in the longest war in us history they said it’s going to get worse before it gets better because there making it get worse money for war no money for people 9 trillion missing look it up it’s getting worse
