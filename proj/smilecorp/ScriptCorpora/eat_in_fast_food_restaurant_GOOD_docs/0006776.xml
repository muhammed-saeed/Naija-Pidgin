 Consider the egg. Simple, delicious, and incredibly easy to prepare.

And yet, if you peruse the nutritional listings of America’s favorite fast food restaurants, quite a different picture of the egg emerges — and it’s anything but simple.

I took a look at the published ingredient lists for six fast food mainstays that sell breakfast: McDonald’s , Burger King, Chik-fil-A, Subway, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Hardee’s. I wanted to know just one thing: what’s in their eggs?

I found several interesting ingredients, and one big surprise (at least it was surprising to me). I fully expected that McDonald’s or Burger King would take the prize for the most unrecognizable ingredients, but neither one stacks up to the egg manipulation of Subway. McDonald’s still takes second prize, but as you’ll see, it’s the “Eat Fresh” folks whose list is easily the most baffling.

On the other end of the spectrum, Hardee’s, Burger King and Dunkin’ Donuts all come out looking decent with relatively short lists of ingredients. For the most part, they stick to nature’s simple delight. Chik-fil-A sits in the middle of the pack with ordinary and dubious ingredients.

What’s most intriguing is the comparison between lists. For example, Hardee’s sells its customers eggs with only one preservative added, while Subway sells a concoction that includes eggs and “premium egg blend” containing at least ten preservatives and additives nowhere to be found on most of the other lists.

Let me stress that this information has been published by the companies and is there for all to see; just follow the links (you’ll not find any secret formulas ahead). The ingredient explanations below the lists were added by me and not included in the published list.

 

 1.  Subway 

Egg Omelet Patty (Regular): Whole eggs, egg whites, water, nonfat dry milk, premium egg blend (isolated pea product, salt, citric acid, dextrose, guar gum, xanthan gum, extractive of spice, propylene glycol and not more than 2% calcium silicate and glycerin to prevent caking), soybean oil, butter alternative (liquid and hydrogenated soybean oil, salt, soy lecithin, natural and artificial flavors, beta carotene (color), TBHQ and citric acid added to protect flavor, dimethylpolysiloxane (antifoaming agent added), salt, beta-carotene (color).

 A few words on the ingredients: 

Propylene glycol, a solvent for food colors and flavorings, is also used in anti-freeze, to lubricate air-conditioner compressors, and in deodorant sticks.

Interesting and rather odd that there is such a disparity between the various vendors. But is it necessarily true that ‘more is worse’ when dealing with additives? And there are different questions about the same issues with food irradiation, ah, make that ‘ultra-pasteurization’ for dairy.

The question with additives isn’t ‘additive’ versus ‘natural’, implying healthy v. unhealthy. Rather, it is additive versus whatever problem the additive is used to address and both may have both short and long term consequences. Now and then something becomes unpopular (i.e. trans-fats), but otherwise there doesn’t seem to be easy-to-use consumer information on which to base choices. How can one deal with this?

For years I used to say as kind of a joke that you should make a point of eating preservatives and additives because they will protect you. Ironically, that turned out to be exactly correct in the case of anti-oxidants.

“Cottonseed oil, when fully hydrogenated, is 94% saturated fat.”

That is the difference between saturated and unsaturated, the amount of hydrogen atoms.

This article is very biased and paints an unjust picture of additives.
Citric acid: so what? Glycerin: Yes it’s used in shaving foam, but that doesn’t mean it’s in necessarily bad for humans.
The author tries to make us associate the ingredients with unnatural products, even though many of them occur in food items naturally

Interesting point. Let me make sure I have interpreted it correctly: the article I wrote is biased and many of the additives listed by the companies occur in food items naturally.

Ok, let’s address the bias issue first. All of the ingredients listed for each fast-food restaurant are available on their websites, and I simply transferred them word for word into the article. I then introduced the lists and gave brief descriptions of the additives I found most worthy of comment. I pointed out in the introduction what I was looking for in the lists, and drew attention to what I thought was most interesting–a comparison between lists.

Now, if I removed both the introduction and the discussion of the additives (the elements I assume you think are biased), do you think a reasonable person would read the companies’ lists and not raise an eyebrow? If you do, then I think you are fooling yourself. Anyone can read the lists for Subway and McDonald’s, compare those to Hardee’s, and plainly see a massive difference. The question is, why is there a difference? Both are purporting to serve their customers eggs, yes?

Which brings us to your next point, that many of the additives “occur in food items naturally.” Ok, if that’s the case, and we should expect to see things like propylene glycol and TBHQ in our eggs, then why don’t they appear on Hardee’s or Dunkin’ Donuts’ lists? For that matter, why aren’t the lists more or less identical?

Addressing your reference to citric acid, please note that nowhere in the article do I draw special attention to citric acid, which is a natural additive so common that it’s even in the herbal tea I am drinking right now. Had I pulled it out for special comment, you might have a point. As it stands, you have none.

As to your reference to glycerin, I can only say that if you like glycerin in your eggs, more power to you. In fact, I think that you should make a point to patronize Subway and McDonald’s exclusively so that you can dose up on as many of these “natural” additives as possible. Enjoy.

I have got to agree with Sebastian.

I put this article in the same class as declarations like, “100% OF SMOKERS DIE!”.

You should have also pointed out that eggs are approximately 10% Ovoglobulins. Then stated that ‘we don’t even know what these proteins do’.

Maybe add a exclamation point to drive that point home.

Is it worth pointing out the ingredients in these products?

I guess; but as the author states in his comments “All of the ingredients listed for each fast-food restaurant are available on their websites, and I simply transferred them word for word into the article.” I’d bet anyone truly interested would have taken a look for themselves.

I think what IS worth pointing out in these products is that they do not contain any added sugar. That seems pretty rare (and postive) in my opinion.

A better headline for the article might have been ‘Nothing unusual in fast food eggs’ or ’100% of fast food eaters DIE!’

Derek makes my point perfectly.

He doesn’t eat there because these ingredients bother him, fair enough.

The people that do eat fast food are not bothered by the additives, or eat it so infrequently that it’s no big deal.

Even though I prefer eating natural and whole foods, I think Sebastian makes a good point.

The structure of the argument (“This ingredient is also found in X”) is simply not persuasive. It would be better to do more homework and focus on (1) where the additive comes from and/or (2) what effect it has on people. I would guess that almost any substance meeting the author’s gastronomical approval could be incorporated in something nasty. This faulty argument structure distracts from the message, and makes the logic-minded reader view the rest of the article with a higher level of skepticism.

Doug — Actually, 100% of smokers do die. Whether they die from smoking related illness is another question.

But seriously, as I said in a previous reply, if you don’t mind ingesting the ingredients discussed here, by all means please enjoy the egg food product. Debating a person’s likes or dislikes isn’t worth anyone’s time.

I will, however, correct your mischaracterization of the article. If my argument included a discussion of links between various ingredients and cancer, for example, then you’d be at least in the ballpark with your “eat fast food and die” barb. Since I did not make that argument, or really anything like it, your argument is a straw man. Closer reading might have avoided that fallacy.

Rather, the article did exactly, and simply, what I stated upfront — built awareness of ingredients most people do not know is in their food, and shed light on a comparison between ingredient lists at different restaurants, which I think tells the most interesting story.

And again, as I said in another reply, if you or anyone representing the fast food industry cares to address why the comparison between lists reveals such a huge disparity, please do.

Also, Doug, the ovoglobulin in egg whites has been in eggs for roughly forever. Additives like propylene glycol and dimethylpolysiloxane are a slightly newer addition.

I smell a straw man burning.

I’d imagine, though, that it’s still possible you’re getting a healthier breakfast sandwich at Subway, where you might even get some vegetables. I doubt that using just eggs would be a sensible strategy for any of these chains. I didn’t find any of these THAT shocking or scary.

I do appreciate that you respond. Thank you.

When you say “If my argument included a discussion of links between various ingredients and cancer, for example, then you’d be at least in the ballpark with your “eat fast food and die” barb. ”

How is what you did say any different?

“
Propylene glycol, a solvent for food colors and flavorings, is also used in anti-freeze, to lubricate air-conditioner compressors, and in deodorant sticks.”

You chose those products for a reason. Why? They are all inedible and probably don’t taste very good.

You could have just as easily said ‘propylene glycol is also used in beer, salad dressing and pre-made cookie dough’ which are edible and delicious.

Thanks again

As DiSalvo himself states, the body of his article is merely a copy-paste with an intro and a (very limited) conclusion. So why the barrage of comments? Why the focus on specifics (citric acids) and refusal to focus on the bigger picture?

Because with fewer and fewer consumers breaking eggs and preparing meat in their own kitchens, fast food vendors are making even the most basic foods (e.g. the egg.) a complete abstraction. When eggs and meats are no longer just that, but instead substitutes and additives (and at the same time marketed as if ‘the real thing’), we as consumers are left completely frustrated as to where to find ‘a square meal’.

The fast food chains have all but wiped out the diners and small family owned restaurants, where you could actually see your food being prepared. Instead they are conjuring up meals just out of sight and some (as Subway) even having the nerve to claim that they are ‘the healthier alternative’ – when clearly they are not!

And when same industry’s response to consumers demand for ‘added disclosure’ of nutritional facts is burying the evidence on hard-to-reach websites and print in stores (“read the fine print”), then it’s a clear indication that the consumer cannot rely on industry to serve a need for a ‘square meal’.

So what to do? Frequent no-chain restaurants that you know and trust – and above all: get into the kitchen that you probably have spent a small fortune installing – and use it!

“‘Propylene glycol, a solvent for food colors and flavorings, is also used in anti-freeze, to lubricate air-conditioner compressors, and in deodorant sticks.’

You chose those products for a reason. Why?” — Because they contain them. Get over it. If you like fast food, eat it. Stop complaining about those who are skeptical of additives? I doubt you add propylene glycol when you cook an egg in your home. Why should Subway have to add it?

Actually, I had only two criteria for what to include in this piece: (1) Must be a well-known fast food chain, and (2) must sell eggs. I had no idea what I would find. So, no, I didn’t choose these items because they contain those chemicals; I chose them because they are eggs (or “eggs”) sold at well known fast food chains.
