Argentina, Chile, and Peru - February to August 2009
 From 2008 to 2009, I spent over nine months traveling in Central America and South America with side trips to Antarctica and Easter island. What follows are my journal entries from South America. Central America , Antarctica , and Easter Island are listed separately. The comments in square brackets were comments from my emails rather than entries in my journal.

Saturday, February 7: Panama City, Panama to Buenos Aires, Argentina

The Panama City to Buenos Aires leg of my trip left last night at
9pm. For this leg, I had a window exit row. I was concerned they
would make me move because I couldn&apos;t understand directions in
Spanish, but thankfully, that wasn&apos;t a problem. The exit row seats
had plenty of extra leg room so it was a pretty comfortable flight
even though I was hip to hip with my neighbor.
Shortly after take-off, we were served dinner. Chicken and rice or
pasta and meat sauce. I selected the pasta and it was surprisingly
good. Watched a movie but don&apos;t remember what it was.
It was a seven hour flight and a few hours after dinner, they served
sandwiches. There was definitely ham on them and something else I
never really identified.
After we landed, I found the ATM and got cash. Coming from Central
America, I got thrown off when the ATM showed money amounts with a
dollar sign. In Guatemala, it was Q for Quetzal, in Honduras, L for
Lempira, and in El Salvador, $ for US dollars. Not being sure whether
I was getting dollars or pesos, I only took out $100 but then got 100
pesos. Now I know they use the $ for peso amounts. There are about
3.5 pesos to the dollar. So, I ended up with just over 30 dollars.
Oops! But it was enough to get into town. Then found the bank and
got change (a hot commodity in this city - and absolutely necessary
for the bus). Then, rather than taking a 90 peso bus or a 45 peso
shuttle, I took a 1.75 peso local bus.
I followed the one other traveler on the bus to a neighborhood with
some hostels. His was full but they left me leave my backpack there
until I found another hostel to call home. I quickly dropped my gear,
sent a quick email message to family to let them know I made it OK,
and then crashed. I took a nap, had a long internet session with a
couple of Skype calls, took another nap and then in the evening, went
for a walk looking for a place to eat dinner when I realized I hadn&apos;t
eaten anything since that breakfast sandwich I had eaten on the
airplane. I couldn&apos;t make any choices though and ended up back at
the hostel. Finally, after 9pm, I wandered out in search of the
supermarket and bought yogurt, bread, an apple, and water. Perfect.
Back at the hostel, I ate and soon went to sleep. We are so far south
here that during the summer it stays light until at least 9pm. I
think that&apos;s what makes it easy to stay up so late.
Unlike everywhere else I&apos;ve been Buenos Aires is hopping well into the
night and morning. There are 24 hour places to get a meal. Night
clubs go to the wee hours. People are out walking and driving all
night long.
The people here are taller and many look more European than Latin. I
can make very few assumptions about where people come from based on
their looks here whereas in Central American, it was pretty easy to
tell who were local and who were the travelers. Even the buses are
different. They have set stops and are similar to the city buses we
have at home. No old U.S. school buses here. Avenida 9 de Julio
reminds me of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston - expect that it&apos;s wider.
In places, there are seven lanes in each direction plus an addition
two lanes in each direction on separate parallel streets. It takes at
least two light cycles to cross safely with the walk signals. 
Sunday, February 8: Buenos Aires

After a horrible nights sleep where I woke up with hundreds of bug
bites, I got up at 10:00, ate the breakfast that came with the hostel
of rolls with a bit of butter and plum marmalade. I checked out at
11:00 and moved a block away and checked into the Milhouse hostel, a
new and very large hostel. I couldn&apos;t get into my room until 1:00 but
I could have left my bags if I preferred. Instead, I hung out and
moved into my room just before 1:00. I took a shower, changed, and
then got directions for the Feria de Mataderos, a local street fair in
one of the far off neighborhoods. By the time I got there, it was
nearly 4:00. There were a lot of street vendors but not a whole lot
else going on. I followed the sound of music and found a place set up
as a club where for 5 pesos, you could go in and do traditional
Argentine dances. These are the traditions of the gauchos and while
they did play some tango, it was mostly other traditional dances.
In season which starts in April, this fair also has gauchos racing
their horses at a full gallop down the street trying to use a little
stick to snag a ring hanging overhead that is no bigger than what you
might wear on your hand. I have to wonder what came first, the
merry-go-round tradition or the gaucho tradition. If I ever return to
Buenos Aries between April and November, I&apos;ll be sure to return to the
Feria to watch the spectacle.
With not much going on, I stepped into a restaurant for a late
lunch/early dinner of chicken and fries. The fries were delicious and
the chicken just a bit dry. I met a couple from Canada and a man from
the US there. They were all Peace Corps volunteers in the early 60s,
when the program was just starting, and they and a bunch of others,
have remained close friends ever since. The two men were in Columbia
and the woman stationed in Peru. The couple had met during their time
in the Peace Corps.
At the restaurant, I noticed a poster for the Feria and it seemed the
off-season activities were just getting going in the evening. I stuck
around and sure enough, there was a concert and dancing starting at
8:00 or so. It started off with a marching band of a sort called
murgas with a lot of drumming and a great many children, teens, and
adults in fantastic costumes dancing through the streets. After one
marching band, the stage was turned over to a trio playing traditional
dance music and people danced in the street. It was an easy enough
dance but with no real place to practice, I couldn&apos;t really get into
it. After another set of marching bands, the next group on stage
played a set with a couple dance done in closed position where the
footwork was all triples. When a local man could find another local
partner, I stepped in and ended up doing a few dances with him. He
talked to me in Spanish. I talked to him in English. We didn&apos;t
understand more than a few words we had said to each other but were OK
dancing together.
After the third murga set, I took off and grabbed a better bus back to
where my hostel was. On the way back, we passed at least two other
areas with local Ferias. 
Monday, February 9: Buenos Aires

Somehow, I seem to have made some sort of transition to the &quot;late&quot;
lifestyle here. For two days in a row, I didn&apos;t get up until nearly
10:00am, almost unheard of for me at home, but just early enough for
me to grab breakfast. Here at the Milhouse hostel, breakfast consists
of rolls with butter, marmalade, and dulce de leche, as well as corn
flakes and milk, an orange drink that is decidedly NOT juice, and
oranges. Dulce de leche seems to be the Central and South American
(or maybe just Buenos Aires) version of the North American peanut
butter and the European Nutella. It comes in tubs or jars and is
spread on everything. Delicious!
I grabbed a shower and hand washed some laundry before heading out.
Being a weekday, I could finally run errands and get a lot done. I
started at Wildlife, an outfitter. They have what I need, socks and
overmitts, but rather than buying right now, I want to return with my
mittens to make sure they&apos;ll work.
Then I grabbed the nearby Subte (subway) for my next errand. The
Subte was very similar to the US system but much cheaper. I had to go
to a nearby hospital for a blood test. Before I left home, I was
diagnosed with Hashimoto&apos;s thyroiditis or at least suspected to have
it. It&apos;s at an early stage but my doctor wanted me to get a follow-up
blood test in early February. She&apos;s expecting my test values to
return to normal about now. With any luck, it&apos;ll be many years before
I have to worry about daily treatment. Thankfully, I was able to go
straight to the lab and did not have to see a doctor first. Also,
because I&apos;m leaving town, it was important to be able to get my
results by Wednesday or by email or internet access. Turns out, my
results will be ready Wednesday morning and I can log onto their web
site to get them. How convenient. Wish I could do the same at home.
I grabbed a lunch at Burger King. I went in for a snack but ended up
with cheeseburger, fries, and then followed up with their version of a
waffle cone sundae. Not bad, for soft serve.
Back at the hostel, I got tips for where to look for some of the other
things I need. I headed out for a couple of converters. I need one
for US to Argentina and another for US to the two prong European
system. I got sent to the electronics neighborhood where I started
going in and out of every store. Some had no converters, some had
transformers but no converters, some had converters but only to the
Argentina outlets, and finally, after a lot of searching, one store
had very cheapo versions of both converters. I hope they do the job.
Then, I went in search of camera accessories. Along the way, I went
past the book store section of town so I stopped in looking for the
Lonely Planet South America guide book. I found it in a couple of
stores, but only new ones which at $199 (or 55 US dollars) were a bit
steep. I decided to hold off in the hopes of finding a trade for my
Central American book. Then I found the camera stores section of town
and like the electronics section, none of the stores had what I needed
but then one literally pointed me into a non-descript office building.
I walked past the bank of elevators and found another shop behind
them. This store is the professional photographers store in town, not
where the tourists go for extra batteries and memory cards. I bought
a hood for my camera to replace the one I had lost from the back of a
motorcycle taxi in Phnom Penh last year for just $19. It screws onto
my camera but then the rubber hood retracts quite easily. I then
balked at paying $192 for a polarizing filter for my camera. I
decided to do a bit more research to find out if it was necessary or
merely suggested for Antarctic photography. So I made note of where
to find this shop again if I want to go back tomorrow.
Walking back to the hostel, I walked through the jewelry and watches
section of town. I&apos;ve now identified, the textiles street, the
bookstores street, the electronics and fishing stores street (the same
street for some reason), the photography street, and the jewelry and
watches street. You go down any of these streets and see countless
shops that all seem indistinguishable from one another. Obviously
there are small differences, but they mostly seem the same to me.
All this running around town took time. By the time I got back to the
hostel and relaxed a bit, it was time for dinner, say nearly 9:00pm.
I got directions to a restaurant that had been recommended to me a
number of times and headed out. It was maybe another 1.5 to 2 km
away. No problem. This is not a late hour for dinner. And sure
enough, when I got to Des Nivel&apos;s in the San Telmo part of town, the
place was packed. If Argentina is known for steak, the restaurant in
Buenos Aires seems to be the place to go to eat beef. I ordered a
mixed salad and the tenderloin with mushrooms and potatoes noisette.
The salad was something other than iceberg lettuce, a nice break for
almost every salad I had in Central America. The tenderloin was HUGE.
I&apos;m guessing it was at least a pound of meat. It was probably 7-8&quot;
long, 3&quot; wide, and 1.5&quot; thick. There wasn&apos;t an ounce of fat or
grizzle on the steak and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. The
mushrooms were good but I wasn&apos;t crazy about the sauce they came in.
Oh well. And the potatoes were delicious, rounds of potatoes, some
cut thick and cooked until soft on the inside and others cut thin,
almost like big potato chips. I washed it all down with pomelo soda.
The Fresca and Squirt that had been mostly readily available in
Central America don&apos;t seem to be available here but pomelo soda is.
It&apos;s similar but maybe a bit less sweet.
When I got the bill, I was a bit surprised to find an extra $3 charge
on the bill. It was for the rolls and salt, oil and vinegar caddy.
The salad did not some with any other dressing and the rolls weren&apos;t
all that great. I only ate one small roll which for anyone who knows
me knows they couldn&apos;t have been at all good. I usually eat a lot of
bread if it&apos;s at all good. Oh well, so I&apos;ve lived and learned.
Before bed, I continued reading Rusty Young&apos;s &quot;Marching Powder&quot; about
the strangest prison in South America. It&apos;s one of my hostel mates so
I won&apos;t be able to finish it, but I&apos;ve read enough to know that if and
when I get to Bolivia, I will be taking a prison tour. Prisoners must
buy they&apos;re own prison cell, they&apos;re food, and many have their
family&apos;s living in the prison with them. Hope I can find another copy
of this book eventually. 
Tuesday, February 10: Buenos Aires

After breakfast, I hand washed more laundry and then went to get a haircut. On
my way to the salon, I got sidetracked by a political march complete
with a few brass instruments playing hava nagila. Huh? Then I
finally went back to a place I had seen when I first got to town and
Nino cut my hair for $25, that&apos;s pesos, not dollars. A good cut
though - I think.
Between errands, I keep returning to the hostel to wring out my
clothes as there&apos;s no good place to let them dry except the bathroom
until they stop dripping and then I can hang them on my bunk.
I then went off to buy a polarizing filter for my camera. Yesterday&apos;s
research made me realize that while not necessary, the filter can make
the difference in how well my pictures come out.
I also visited a Farmacia to get some non/drowsy antihistamine with
decongestant. I had bought my Dramamine yesterday. Plus the
pharmacist confirmed that the cream I&apos;m using is appropriate for the
bug bites I&apos;m dealing with. Yesterday&apos;s research also confirmed that
it probably really is bug bites even though I had always heard the
bite in lines and threes and my bites are much more random but on-line
pictures showed enough variability that it&apos;s more likely bed bug bites
than anything else. I&apos;m just glad got out of that first hostel after
one day.
I realized I&apos;ve now bought just about everything I&apos;ve needed for my
trip and should be able to enjoy the city tomorrow as a sightseer
rather than a consumer. I may try to catch a tango lesson as well. I
was going to try one today but when I started to get ready to go, I
realized it was pouring outside. That plus the fact that I was wiped
out from my shopping had me decide to forgo the lesson. The rain must
have started right after I had gotten back to the hostel this
afternoon. I got lucky as I&apos;ve been out and about without my rain
gear.
Later, when the rain stopped, I did some shopping at Carrefour, a
French supermarket and bought some goodies for the cruise, including
packets of Crystal Light in flavors I haven&apos;t seen before...
Kiwi/melon, two different flavors of apple, orange, orange dulce, and
more. I bought some granola bars, cookies, and more. I probably
won&apos;t need much as the food is supposed to be good and plentiful, but
I think I&apos;m a bit food shy after my El Mirador trip.
For dinner, I bought half of what would be a medium pizza at home for
$5 (that&apos;s just 1.5 US dollars). Crazy. It wasn&apos;t the greatest pizza
but it wasn&apos;t at all bad. After last night&apos;s $54 meal, this would go
a long way to averaging out my food costs here in Buenos Aires.

Subject: 2/11-15: Buenos Aires to Ushuaia
This is likely my last transcribed journal entry until after my
Antarctic trip. We sail tomorrow evening. I do expect to be back
on-line again during the day tomorrow for any last minute emails but
then not at all for the duration of the trip. When I get back, it&apos;s
likely to take a while to catch up.
I&apos;m going to miss the easy access to information. For example, the
bird list below was compiled after I had seen the birds in the wild
and then returned to use the internet. A google search on birds of
Tierra del Fuego resulted in a number of sites with good pictures that
I could match up to the birds I had seen. On board the boat, I&apos;ll
have access to their library of things related to the Antarctica, but
not much else. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be the only one going through a bit
of internet withdrawal. But, I think life on board will be
interesting enough without the computer.

Wednesday, February 11: Buenos Aires

Went to sleep relatively early as did three others in the room, for a
change. Of the ones that didn&apos;t, one came in falling down drunk and
proceeded to fall down with a crash and wake up the room when trying
to climb into his top bunk. Then, his bed being somewhat kitty corner
to mine, he started reaching down towards me to try to &apos;introduce&apos;
himself. I just turned over and tried to go back to sleep, knowing
there was no way he could reach me. Then I heard something and turned
just in time to see him swinging his legs over the side of his bed to
try to climb down. I think he kicked Stefan, the guy sleeping in the
bottom bunk, and then he fell on his butt in the middle of the floor.
And he didn&apos;t fall quietly. Stefan got up, and told the guy to leave,
so he did. Two hours later, he was back and climbed into the bunk
above me. If he had gone to sleep, it would have been fine, but he
started reaching down towards me but once again couldn&apos;t get near me.
I told him to go to sleep. Then I saw his head leaning over the edge
of the bed. Once again, I told him to go to sleep. He got indignant
and told me &quot;tranquilo, tranquilo&quot; (relax, relax). So, not only was
he a creep, but I was scared he was going to fall out of the bed head
first. So I went down to the front desk and ended up talking with the
night manager who knew why I was there even before I opened my mouth.
He came up to the room and told the guy to go to sleep. If he didn&apos;t
he would be sleeping downstairs on the couch - or out on the street.
That did it and the guy wasn&apos;t a problem any more. Of course, it was
right then that the sixth guy came into our room who was supposed to
be sleeping in the bunk on top of mine. He had to retrieve his stuff
from around the drunk guy and then went to sleep where the drunk guy
was supposed to be. Of course, by then, I was too wired to sleep.
Argh!
Ah the joys of hostel rooms. Thankfully, these situations are very
few and far between.
I ended up getting up relatively early and got a full hour on the
computer, an unusual occurrence in this humongous hostel with a 20
minute limit when others are waiting. After breakfast and a shower, I
took the bus to go visit the Duarte&apos;s. The cemetery in the Recoleta
part of town is a major tourist destination. Eva Duarte, better known
as Evita Peron, is interred there. Walking into this cemetery is like
walking into a miniature city. The entire cemetery is mausoleum after
mausoleum. Most are in Spanish but I noticed a few in English.
There&apos;s a map of the cemetery just inside the door so I avoided the
tout offering 6 peso maps and just remembered the directions to
Evita&apos;s tomb. Otherwise, it would be pretty easy to just follow the
crowds. I wandered around the cemetery afterwards for a while, noting
some were in great condition, some were in bad condition. Many had
stairs going down. Not sure to what, especially since the stairs
didn&apos;t look big enough to bring a coffin down.
I continued a walking tour of that section of town, walking past the
hulking Gothic building, to a museum. Being Wednesday, it was free so
I did a quick tour. As is usual, I wasn&apos;t all that enthralled with
the paintings on the walls but some of the other art caught my
attention. Then I went to visit the giant metal flower, floraris
generica, a 20m high hydraulically operated flower with petals that
open in the morning and close at night.
Stopped in a church and saw decorations that included human bones. Weird!
I tried to take a tango lesson today, but the place that has offered
daily classes in the past wasn&apos;t offering a class either today or any
longer. Oh well. I could go to a show but will likely skip it
altogether.
Back in the neighborhood of the hostel, I went in an unsuccessful
search for a used book store with English language books. Then it was
back to the hostel where I played the waiting game to get access to
the computers to download pictures from my camera. After finally
getting the pictures copied, I went in search of Italian food.
Apparently, a very large percentage of people in the area have some
Italian heritage. I went to Al Fiorno on a recommendation and while I
didn&apos;t particularly like my selection, I think the place was probably
pretty good. Back at the hostel, I set my alarm for 3:30 and went to
sleep. 
Thursday, February 12: Buenos Aires to Ushuaia

I rolled out of bed mostly ready to go. Just had to get dressed and
have the front desk call a taxi. The taxi drove past the giant flower
so I had a chance to see it glowing with the internal red lights in
it&apos;s closed position. It was cool.
With the problem I had last year with a similar backpack flying from
Malaysia to Thailand, I didn&apos;t take any chances and paid $30 (9
dollars) to have my backpack wrapped in plastic. Then I got an exit
row seat. In the waiting area, I sat next to a 1939 Jewish refugee
from Austria who has been living in Buenos Aires ever since.
Interesting guy. Played the guessing game about the others waiting
for the same flight. The group of Japanese tourists, 50 something
group of four with outdoors duds (maybe on the same expeditions),
other backpackers, etc.
I was pleasantly surprised when getting on this plane. It was all
leather like seating with plenty of leg room even in the regular
seats. In the exit row, there was so much space, I could even cross
my legs. Wow! The plane stopped in Calafate but I never saw either
the town or the glacier the area is known for on the way in. Then we
continued on to Ushuaia and I was surprised to see the plane
descending through mountains that seemed to be reaching up for us.
From my aisle seat though, I couldn&apos;t see down to the Beagle Channel
that the plane was following until it took a turn. The mountains were
rugged and spectacular. Their jagged peaks looked like difficult
climbs and impossible hikes. There were a lot of glaciers and snow
fields in the area and this is the middle of summer down here so if it
hasn&apos;t melted yet, what I saw wasn&apos;t likely to go away any time soon.
Retrieved my bag which arrived intact. Had to open my carry on to
make sure there wasn&apos;t any fresh fruit or other items that could bring
fruit flies into the area. Met Anna and Peter, a couple from Poland,
also flying in on a one-way ticket with plans to travel north, hiking
and backpacking as they go. We shared a taxi to a hostel, took one
look and went to another nearby hostel. We all decided to stay there.
I thought Ushuaia would be a rough fishing village, but it anything
but. The main drag in town is full of high end stores and lots of
tourists. The signs are frequently in English. There are pubs, other
restaurants, and a lot of outfitters with gear priced double what I
would see at home. Glad I got most of my shopping done in El Salvador
and Buenos Aires.
Having similar interests, Anna, Peter, and I ended up visiting the
information booth in town, then grabbed lunch in a pub while it poured
down rain outside. By the time we finished lunch, the weather changed
again and it was nice. We decided to stick together and headed for a
nearby hike in town. We climbed to the Glacier Martial for great
views of town and the Beagle Channel in one direction, and we ended up
at the foot of the glacier. We descended partway and then went up the
Caadon Negro, a drainage that led to a spectacular view of a deep
valley being dominated by glaciated mountains above. Easily a better
view than from the glacier. Altogether, we probably climbed close to
3000&apos; that day. Coming down, we took an alternative trail which ended
up being extremely muddy and slick. It was a nice trail if it hadn&apos;t
been so wet though. This trail ended half a kilometer below where we
had started so we hailed a taxi that had just dropped others off at
the ski area where we had started.
We walked to the supermarket and made dinner of pasta with an
appetizer of carrots and tomatoes. Not a huge selection of veggies in
that market.
The three of us got along just great so we&apos;re likely to spend the next
few days together exploring Tierra del Fuego National Park. 
Friday, February 13: Ushuaia to Tierra del Fuego National Park

In a room of six, the two Israeli girls were loud and obnoxious when
waking up at 5:00 this morning. Rather than planning the night
before, they were noisy, rustling bags, talking with each other,
dropping things, etc. That&apos;s a good example of how not to behave in a
hostel. Oh well. By the time I got back to sleep, I ended up
sleeping until 8:30. I hopped on the internet for half an hour and
then ate my breakfast. I had to shower and get out of the room, but
not the hostel, by 10:00. No problem. Then I joined Anna and Peter
for breakfast. We decided to spend the next few days together in the
park as we had similar interests and abilities. We shopped for food,
repacked our bags and got ready to go. I was surprised when my hotel
wouldn&apos;t hold my extra bags for me so I had to bring them back to the
hostel. Then we had a bit of a wait for the shuttle to the park. We
were let out on this gorgeous island with free camping. We were
surrounded by mountains and cliffs. There was a river on one side and
a bay on the other. The terrain reminded me of the highlands (either
Grayson in Virginia, or Scottish) with open areas and then scrub
areas. Not much protection from the wind which was strong. I was
just hoping the wind would die down in the evening.
We then walked to the other camping area and waited for the 5:00
shuttle to the other side of the park. We started a three hour hike
just before 6:00pm. It wound along the coast, looking out over the
Ensenada and Lapataia Bays both leading to the Beagle Channel. The
Beagle Channel is well south of the Straits of Magellan, the better
know channel. Across the channel to the south, is Chilean land.
With a late sunset and a long dusk, we got back to our camp with
plenty of time for them to cook their dinner in the light. I didn&apos;t
bother with a stove on this trip, knowing I could make one along the
way, if necessary, so I just ate my cold sandwich of ham and cheese.
Thankfully, the wind had died down so it was OK to bundle up and sit
outside. While we were finishing dinner, a Fuegian Red Fox came and
wandered through our camp. It was obviously very used to humans as it
came within a few meters and we were talking the whole time it was
there. Of course, my camera was in my tent at the time. Argh!
Met a Russian guy along the road near our campsite today. Turns out
he&apos;s from Kazan, the same town where my niece and nephew are from. He
was a bit weird, otherwise it would have been interesting to hear a
bit about Kazan from him.
It was only as I was writing this journal entry that I realized it was
Friday the thirteenth. Oh well. We didn&apos;t have any bad luck today. 
Saturday, February 14: Tierra del Fuego

Slept badly last night. Allergy nose congestion and an occasional
cough. May buy some antibiotics in town just in case it turns into
anything on the boat. Can&apos;t get prescriptions once on board. The
wind picked up in the morning and it started raining. So rather than
trying to get up early, I slept in. I had already decided I wasn&apos;t up
for the mountain hike we had hoped to do. When the rain finally
started dying down at 9:30, I inquired of the others about their
plans. Turns out Anna had a cold and wasn&apos;t up for the hike, either.
So, we all spent the day doing small hikes nearer to our campsite,
including one that led to the end of the 3079km Route 3, better known
as the Pan American highway. Not sure if that&apos;s 3079km in Argentina
or through South America. We visited a mirador (viewpoint) over the
Lapiteria Bay, an active beaver colony. Beavers are an introduced
species and are causing havoc here. And we visited a beat bog in the
making. There were a lot of birds to be seen.
 Ringed Kingfisher diving into the beaver pond. Ruddy Headed Geese at our campsite Southern Caracara at our campsite Austral parakeet in a flock near the beaver pond Silvery Grebe along the coastal walk Great Grebe in the river near our campsite - we were wondering what
would look sort of like a cormorant (we were far away) but with a red
neck. Condor over the cliffs above the beaver pond - distinctive white collar. There were other water birds, a plover type bird, and more geese types.

Back at our camp, I napped for a couple of hours. Woke up at 6.00pm
so went for a walk around the camp area and took picture of a bunny
and a goose. It started raining again so I went back to my campsite
to close up my tent. Sat a while talking with Peter while Anna slept
longer. Ate dinner - another ham and cheese sandwich on the fattest
pita bread I&apos;ve ever seen. Hung out until dark, at about 10
something. Then sleep. 
Sunday, February 15: Tierra del Fuego to Ushuaia

Woke up to a very unusual occurrence here in Tierra del Fuego. There
was a big yellow orb in the sky and the sky was blue and clear. Wow!
It&apos;s always been cloudy and frequently rainy though we&apos;ve managed to
do most of our hiking &apos;while it has been dry though we&apos;ve had
occasional sprinkles. The bit of condensation on my tent dried before
I had to pack it. then we headed off to Roco Lake for our pickup but
didn&apos;t make it as the guy in the van was driving in our direction so
we could flag him down. I think he was in a rush as he drove crazy
trying to get back to town.
It was too early to check in so I left my backpack at the hotel and
went back to the hostel to pick up the rest of my stuff and meet Anna
and Peter. They decided on another hostel so were only picking up
their stuff. So, we ended up saying our good byes. They&apos;re going to
be heading north visiting the same areas I want to visit in Patagonia
and other areas when I get back from Antarctica. I hope to hear from
them and get some tips before I head north. We&apos;ll see.
Back at the hotel, I checked into my room, grabbed a shower, and then
got a load of laundry together. I stopped to do a bit of research on
the computers available at the hotel before heading for the
laundromat. It was only when I got there that I realized that it was
Sunday and many businesses are closed. I&apos;m going to have to do my
laundry tomorrow and then carry it around with me all day. Argh!
I grabbed some yogurt from the store and some sodas for the boat and
headed back to the room. I ate and watched a bit of TV. Then spent
some time on line though I couldn&apos;t hook up my hard drive to the
computers at the hotel. At 6:30, the cruise meeting started. There
wasn&apos;t a lot of new information imparted but some clarifying points
were made. Plus I finally met my roommate here at the hotel and my
roommate, someone else, for the cruise.
I hadn&apos;t eaten much all day so was hungry even though it was a bit
early for many of the restaurants in town which open at 8pm. After I
grabbed my jacket from my room, I met Sanjay in the lobby, another
cruise person. We ended up going for pizza near the hostel I had
stayed in. It was delicious.
By the time we got back to the hotel, it was nearly 10:00. The
computers were free so after writing my journal entry for today, I had
time to transcribe it. 
Monday, February 16 to Thursday, March 5: Antarctica cruise

From Ushuaia, I took a twenty day cruise to the Falklands, South Georgia Island, and the Antactic Peninsula. I&apos;ve included my journal from that cruise on a separate page .
 Top of page 
Friday, March 6: Ushuaia

We pulled into port at 6:00am. Docking was so smooth nobody felt a
thing. I was in the shower at the time so missed out on watching the
process.
I ate well for our last breakfast but it was so early, it wasn&apos;t going
to be brunch no matter how long I tried to stretch it. I left my
luggage at the storage facility until I could find and check into a
hostel. I went to Yakush, a hostel which had a much better feel than
the previous one I had stayed in in Ushuaia. It was nicer, felt
cleaner, and had a better and more social atmosphere without turning
into a party hostel. It costs the same as the previous hostel and
includes breakfast. Not bad. By the time I checked email, scoped out
the nearby laundromat, and retrieved my backpack from the storage
facility, I could check in and get to my bed.
I quickly pulled my laundry together and washed almost everything,
leaving me to hang out in a rather cool town wearing my light skirt,
crocs, and a fleece sweater. I had my rain jacket but needed to wash
my heavier jacket after hanging out with penguins for a couple of
weeks.
I napped both before and after lunch, eating at the hostel in the
hopes that I can get a bit more serious about watching where my money
is hemorrhaging, knowing I also want to make it to Easter Island and
the Galapagos. Being back in money saving mode is difficult in this
relatively expensive town but shopping at a supermarket and cooking
one&apos;s own food helps.
Burgers on the grill for dinner. Then gave my first Antarctic
presentation to Wim, another hosteller who is heading to the Peninsula
in a week or so. 
Saturday, March 7: Ushuaia

Visited the PO today. It&apos;s VERY expensive to mail even small packages
home from here. I&apos;ll try again when I get to Chile. It certainly
can&apos;t be more expensive.
I visited a few bus companies and now know my options for getting out
of town. Not knowing exactly when I wanted to leave, I didn&apos;t book
right away. By the day&apos;s end, I had decided to do a two to three day
hike with Wim, the Antarctic bound guy I had met the day before. He
was just hanging around town, not particularly motivated to do much
and with the murmurs of others who had done this hike and gotten lost,
I decided I didn&apos;t want to do it alone. I asked him if he wanted to
join me and he was game. Then I booked my bus out of Ushuaia for
Wednesday.
I was completely unsuccessful in finding an Internet Cafe with a DVD
reader that would read my DVD from the Quark boat and/or recognize my
hard drive. Argh! I wanted to include information about the ship&apos;s
program with the first of the journal entries I mailed out. Oh
well... I&apos;ll keep trying as I travel north - at least until I mail
the DVD home.
For our evening&apos;s entertainment, Wim and I made a soda can stove. He
hadn&apos;t been able to find any fuel for the heavier stove he was
carrying and was intrigued by the stove I was planning on making for
myself. I had never successfully made one before but had only tried
one half-hearted attempt so between the two of us, we managed to pull
together a pretty good stove. We put the holes in the side so that we
wouldn&apos;t need a separate pot stand. We attracted quite the crowd in
the hostel, especially when we filled it and lit the thing on fire.
It worked perfectly. The first pot we tried to use didn&apos;t work
because the bottom was a bit concave. It put out the fire. Before
realizing what the problem was, we tried again with the same pot but I
was ready to lift it up before the fire went out and was rewarded with
an interesting sight when the bottom of the pot continued to have a
flame even though I wasn&apos;t anywhere near the stove. The concave
bottom held the vapor which continued to burn for a surprisingly long
time.
When we tested the stove with Wim&apos;s pot, it worked well. With about
27cc of fuel, it vaporized the fuel in 1.5-2 minutes, then boiled half
a liter of water in 8 minutes, and then continued to burn for another
7 minutes or so.
Wim, skeptical when I first mentioned my stove plans to him, looked up
the stoves on-line before he really believed me. Then even so, he was
impressed with the results. Jerome who had been giving us moral if
skeptical support, was amazed and kept trying to steal the stove once
he realized how well it worked. Well, he kept threatening to steal
the stove anyway. 
Sunday, March 8: Ushuaia to Lago de Cominante

Happy International Women&apos;s Day. Who knew? Many of the men here have
wished me a good day today and yet for a holiday that ostensibly got
it&apos;s start in the US, I really knew (or had forgotten) anything about
it. In any case, IWD seems to be a good day to start a hike.
I was up, showered, and breakfasted before Wim got up. No problem. I
had been warned and we&apos;re not in too much of a rush. Sunset is still
very late in these parts. I packed and put my extra stuff in the
hostel&apos;s storage room. Then went shopping for the food I would need
for three days. By the time I got back to the hostel, Wim had almost
finished packing so by the time I packed my food, we were ready to
call a taxi. It&apos;s amazing how consistent taxi fares are here. When
someone says it&apos;ll be 18 pesos, it is. This ride cost someone else 21
pesos and that&apos;s what it cost us.
We were dropped off near the edge of a rural community on the
outskirts of town. There were a few small houses and larger ranches
in the area. We walked to the end of the road and went through the
fence marked no trespassing. We had been told about that in advance,
too. A few hundred meters on, the road turned and we continued
straight onto an old woods road that had been converted to an ATV
track. All the downed trees were cut back just enough for horses and
ATVs as was in evidence by the hoof prints, tire tracks, and mud. We
passed a peat farm with triangular horses supporting the sheaths of
drying peat.
We had been warned by others about getting lost but when we entered
the well marked Tierra del Fuego park boundary, we found the trail
well marked with yellow pickets at any points of potential confusion
and a few extra places as well. At the border, we were greeted by a
herd of a dozen horses or so. They looked very well fed. We almost
immediately came upon a beautiful campsite and stopped for lunch. It
was only an hour into our hike but since we hadn&apos;t started until
almost noon, it was time for food. I had a ham and cheese sandwich,
apple crystal light, Cheetos, and some Milka chocolate.
Continuing on, we were careful not to enter the Caado Negro, the same
canyon I had seen from my hike on the day I first got to Ushuaia. But
as long as we followed the marked trail, we stayed on the right path.
We were following a beautiful river drainage and at one point I
noticed we had veered away from it and it was now a pond. Beavers, an
introduced species, were wreaking havoc in the area but since Wim had
never seen a beaver pond, we went to look at the dam. By the time we
got back to the trail, we had to sit and remove all the burrs that had
gathered on our pants, socks, and shoes. That&apos;s when Tom and heather
caught up with us.
It didn&apos;t take long to realize that they were also Appalachian Trail
thruhikers, having hiked southbound in 2001. We hiked together for a
while but then they went ahead while I waited for shutterbug Wim to
catch up. We started climbing out of the valley and when we got to
our well-marked trail junction, we went from AT-like trail through
forest to PCT-like sidehill trail high up on the mountains. From the
junction, it was a relatively short walk to the lake through the trail
down left a lot to be desired. We basically had to descend straight
down along a muddy path that was almost a stream.
At the bottom, we joined Tom and Heather camping in the lenga forest.
These lenga trees are part of the beech family but are twisted like
bonsai trees and grow as much horizontal as vertical. Their trunks
make great seats.
Dinner of pasta and cheese with mushrooms was delicious. Later Tom
and Heather treated us to Hot Chocolate and Wim shared the bottle of
wine he had carried in. It was a great way to end the day and we
didn&apos;t crawl into bed until after 10pm, very late for most backpacking
trips. 
Monday, March 9: Lago Cominante to unnamed horse camp

High hopes for spending the day at the lake were stymied by wet gray
weather. it never really rained but kept threatening to. We finally
gave up after lunch and started hiking at 2:00pm. We knew the wind
had picked up at the lake but were shocked when we got to the sidehill
trail and started getting blown around. It was scary for me just to
get back to the trail junction. We should have learned and gone back
the same way we came but were hoping that the wind would have died
down on the other side of the pass. We were wrong.
The walk up to the pass was a bit muddy until we got to the talus but
it was quite reasonable if windy. Going over the pass however was
interesting. On relatively flat ground, three points of contact were
necessary to keep from getting blown over. Once on the other side of
the pass, where some others had gotten lost, we once again found the
trail to be well marked. We knew to stay high and to the left so
looking that was, we found picket after picket marking our way. We
soon found ourselves well high over the valley bottom but being blown
about by the wind going through the valley. If it weren&apos;t so windy,
it would have been a great hike but the wind was dangerous. I was
getting blown over quite frequently and at one point, broke a hiking
pole, banged an elbow, tore a hole in the pants that had been made for
me in Guatemala and put a corresponding hole in my knee. Ouch! Wim,
who was able to stay on his feet a bit better than me saw me go down
and came back. There wasn&apos;t much he could do except lend me one of
the hiking poles he wasn&apos;t using.
On another occasion, one of my water bottles blew out of the side
pocket of my pack. Thankfully, it came to rest maybe 20 meters
further down the trail so I was able to retrieve it. Mostly, when the
wind dies, I would hoof it down the trail trying to make as much time
as possible. When the gusts blew however, I would just lean into the
hill and wait for the gusts to pass. This often took minutes. My
upper body and torso got a workout doing all these modified push ups.
We expected the trail to descend into the valley but ended up staying
very high for hours, fighting the wind the entire way. Finally we
descended a series of switchbacks through a talus slope and then
entered the forest. There was immediate and very welcome relief from
the wind. Plus, while it had been threatening to rain all day, we
hadn&apos;t been able to use our pack covers as they were getting blown off
out packs when we tried. So here, we could use them if necessary.
I think today&apos;s hike was one of the scariest hikes I&apos;ve ever done, if
not the scariest. I may have had short scary sections in the past but
to be scared for so many hours in a row was a very new experience for
me and not one I would wish on anyone else. That said, I would
recommend the hike to anyone interested but just advise them if the
wind was strong at the trail junction to the lake, to go back the way
you came, and not go through the pass.
We traveled through the forest, once again, used by horses and muddy
at times and when we got near the edge, found a horse camp (for lack
of a better word) and set up camp. We set up our tents in the light
and started cooking in the light, but finished cooking with our
headlamps. Dinner was eaten by headlamp. 
Tuesday, March 10: horse camp to Ushuaia

I woke up early to a beautiful sunrise but being somewhat obscured by
trees, I didn&apos;t wake Wim up. I went back to sleep and woke to rain.
Argh! Nothing like packing a wet tent plus the extra time it takes to
pack when trying to keep everything dry. Of course for Wim, the nearly
hour it took him to pack was the fastest he had ever packed up camp.
It helped that we had run out of water so he didn&apos;t have to fire up
the stove for a hot drink.
We hadn&apos;t realized last night, but we had set up camp just inside the
fence. A few minutes from camp, and we were on an old road, no longer
used by motor transport, but still easy to navigate. The terrain
changed as well and we were back in highlands like landscape. Our
road led to a fence near some buildings. It was obvious to me that
many had gone under the fence but there was no gate and no indication
which way was best to get back to the main road which we could see.
So instead of going under the fence near the buildings, we walked
along the fence until another fence had us backed into a corner. At
that point, we went under, followed the new fence line and went under
one more fence to gain the road.
A couple of crested caracara on fence posts kept the walk interesting
and we soon intersected with the main road. From there, we tried
hitching but all the trucks passing by us had just filled up at the
nearby quarry and weren&apos;t stopping and most of the cars that passed us
were either full or pointing at some unknown destination to let us
know they weren&apos;t traveling into the town of Ushuaia. Finally, a taxi
happened by and we took that back to town. Turns out we flagged it
down just before we would have hit the paved section of road. I&apos;m
glad to have gotten the ride. The walk through town would not be fun
and we were probably unlikely to get a hitch once inside of town.
We were back at the hostel before 11am so had to wait an hour to get
our beds. Then we had the typical pack explosion with wet items
getting hung wherever we could find space. I showered and did some
hand wash knowing that my heavier socks were unlikely to dry by
morning when I would have to hop on my bus to Chile. Then lunch was
leftover hiking supplies. I spent a bit of time on the internet and
then tried to go get hiking poles. But, 3pm was too early for many
places to reopen to I tried again at 4pm and found all the stores open
again. I finally chose a cheapo hiking pole replacement for all of 79
pesos or $21. While sometimes you get what you pay for, I&apos;m hoping
I&apos;ve gotten a bit more than that with this pole.
Tom and Heather didn&apos;t show up for a tentative dinner gathering so we
did our own thing again and then spent the evening making another
stove. This time, we had an even bigger audience, some of whom were
playing very close attention to how we made the stove. One thing led
to another and I was soon giving and impromptu session on how to use
hiking poles. if only Tom and Heather had shown up... It would have
been a true Ruck experience.
It got late and I was leaving very early in the morning so I said
goodnight to Wim who was crashing before me and then updated my
journal before going to sleep myself.
 [Date: Fri Mar 13, 2009 10:21 pm
Subject: 3/11-13: Ushuaia, Argentina to Puerto Natales, Chile
If everything goes well, I&apos;ll be out backpacking for the next week or
so. I&apos;m planning on doing a loop in Torres del Paine National Park
that takes 7-9 days. I bought food for seven days. If worst comes to
worst, there&apos;s overpriced food available for sale at some of the
refugios along the way but I hope I don&apos;t need to take advantage of
them.
In any case, I plan to spend another day or two here in Puerto Natales
upon my return.
So here&apos;s my up to the minute journal entry, including today&apos;s entry...
Mara] 
Wednesday, March 11: Ushuaia, Argentina to Puerto Natales, Chile

I woke up early to find I was only one of maybe eight or so from
Yakush Hostel heading north on the same bus. It was a very nice bus,
not just compared to those I had taken in Central America, but
compared to ones I&apos;ve taken in the US, too. Unfortunately, the leg
room was rather limited and the bus was full but the guy who thought
he was in the back of the bus in seat 45 agreed to switch with me when
he saw he was in the front in the single seat just behind the door.
that means I traded foot room for knee room but I could sit sideways
and stretch my legs out behind the door to the driver&apos;s compartment.
On this 11 hour ride, we first crossed over the mountains east of
Ushuaia and then descended into the Pampas which reminded me of the
northern plains states in the us. It was dry with mostly flat short
scrub and grass with occasional rolling hills, mostly in the distance.
After traveling east, we turned north along the Atlantic Ocean until
we came to the Argentine border control. We all had to get off the
bus and go through immigration. That took the better part of an hour.
Continuing on, it was a good 20km before we came to the Chilean
border control. There, we not only had to get off the bus to go
through immigration, but we had to unload our backpacks and take them
individually into the immigration to go through x-ray control. That
took maybe another hour but then we were delayed when they found an
apple on the bus. They had to wait until we all got back on the bus
to find out whose it was and then she was brought off the bus. I
don&apos;t know if she was fined, but she could have been. She was smiling
when she got back on board so maybe they gave her a break. No fruits,
vegetables, seeds, or other farm products are allowed across the
frontier.
The pampas would be our landscape for the rest of the trip. Calling
the pampas home are the guanaco, llama-like animals that surprisingly
can jump like deer, and Rhea, ostrich-like birds though a bit smaller
than ostrich.
Our next stop was when the bus pulled onto a ferry to get across the
Straights of Magellan. Once again, I find myself marveling at the
fact that I&apos;m actually visiting places that seemed otherworldly when
reading about them in history and geography classes. Still unable to
find my pesos, I scrounged the last of my change and a few centavos
from someone else to buy a hot dog on board the ferry. Then I went
out to watch for dolphins. Leaning over to look at the bow wake had
others telling me &apos;don&apos;t jump&apos; not realizing that the bow wake is
where many dolphins choose to play. I did spot two dolphins with
white sides swimming at breakneck speeds directly towards the boat on
our port side. I didn&apos;t see them turn towards the bow so they
probably went under. I looked at the other side but never caught
sight of them again.
Later in the day, continuing through the pampas north of the
Straights, I saw what was probably a South American Gray Fox cross the
road in front of the bus. We followed the north side of the Straight
the rest of the way to Punta Arenas.
The only food stop other than the ferry we had made all day was a 15
minute stop in the morning at a panaderia. I couldn&apos;t find most of
the pesos I thought I had so just bought one chicken empanada and an
apple pastry. Both were delicious. I&apos;m just glad I had other
munchies with me on the bus.
We pulled in Punta Arenas just after 6pm so had almost an hour and a
half. The first bank the bus station sent us to wouldn&apos;t take Visa so
I found a Bank of Chile and used the ATM there. Then I found a small
store with a soda fountain like counter and got a cheeseburger. It
was a two burger cheeseburger on a huge tostada. I noticed a park
paying homage to Antoine de Saint-Exupry who not only wrote The
Little Prince, but was the head of the Argentine postal service for a
few years, as well.
Back at the bus station, I retrieved my backpack from storage and
climbed onto the bus only to discover there wasn&apos;t enough knees room.
Based on what a German passenger said, I went back inside and was
surprised to find I could change seats for the front row. Once again,
there was no foot room, but I had two seats and could sit sideways
quite comfortably. Turns out, I couldn&apos;t see the Pirates of the
Caribbean movie they were showing but as I had heard, others have seen
the beginning many times but never the end. Sure enough, I read my
book but when we pulled into our final destination, the movie was still
playing.
I ignored the touts and walked to the hostel I wanted to go to but
couldn&apos;t find it so stopped at another which was a bit pricey at 8000
Chilean pesos (C$600 to the dollar) but got me a TV in my own room. I
watched a bit but then crashed.
I did eventually find the rest of my Argentinean pesos. They were in
my wallet where they belonged. Argh! 
Thursday, March 12: Puerto Natales

I woke up much too early at 8:00am, normally a late morning for me.
Noise in the corridor was to blame. I tried to use the Internet but
had to install some free malware removal software first. That took a
while so I ate breakfast of tostadas, with cheese, sandwich meat,
butter, jam, and one little muffin.
While waiting for the computer to scan, I ran out long enough to know
that there were better and cheaper options for lodging in town. I
later checked out and then checked into Hospedaje Gloria, not a
hospital, but a home hostel/guesthouse. Breakfast and internet are
included. My new place is just C$6000/night. No TV but my bathroom
is almost a private bathroom. Everything else is better than where I
was the night before.
With at least ten of us here, I&apos;m the only non-Israeli here. As a
percentage of travelers, there are more Israelis around here than
travelers from any one other area. I generally try to avoid
stereotypes but the stereotypes associated with traveling Israelis
hold true quite frequently. In general, they are loud, insular,
cheap, and inconsiderate of both other travelers and locals. Almost
every time my sleep has been disrupted, it&apos;s been the Israeli&apos;s to
blame. If you say something, they shrug and say it&apos;s their right to
behave however they want. They think their time in the military
entitles them to bowl over everyone else&apos;s feelings.
They frequently speak only Hebrew to each other even when there are
others around. I don&apos;t believe they are required to speak English,
but when you see mixed groups with almost any other language and
nationality involved, they usually try to accommodate others and speak
a common language, usually English. Some will switch to English but
many don&apos;t. In the afternoon, I) might have well been the only one
here. Any attempt I made to engage them resulted in short responses,
no continuation of conversation, and immediate return to talk with
each other in Hebrew. Later on, a couple of Chileans came in and then
a Brit who was probably just as happy as I was that there was one
other person there who was willing to speak English.
One of the Israelis was cooking up a storm in the kitchen, baking
challah and then making stuffed peppers, with boiled potatoes in a
tomato sauce and rice cakes to use the extra rice. She made way too
much for her and her boyfriend and so shared with me and others.
Delicious! She was one of the few to talk with me in the afternoon.
It came out while talking with her that I was Jewish. I don&apos;t know if
word got around, or if people just wanted something new to talk about,
but in the evening, I had an interesting conversation with a couple of
the other Jewish guys about the state of Israel. Even with just the
two of them, they were on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum
when it came to the use of military force to fight the Hamas.
Finished the day with an internet session. 
Friday, March 13: Puerto Natales

More internet in the morning before having to fight off the crowds.
Turns out the crowds had already left to their various destinations.
Had the usual breakfast of tostadas with cheese and other options such
as butter, jam, and dulce de leche. Spent the morning taking it easy
at the hostel. Then at 4:00, when stores reopened, I finally bought a
pot, food for seven days, denatured alcohol, and a bus ticket to
Torres del Paine for 7:00am tomorrow morning. My knee is still
complaining but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s mostly the bruising from the fall,
not anything that requires more rest.
Back at the hostel, I fashioned a pot cover from a small round
aluminum foil tin and a windscreen from a larger 13x9 type pan. Then
I packed and ran out to get the bread I forgot to buy on my first
shopping spree. Not wanting to cook, I stopped for a salmon dinner at
a nearby restaurant. The fillet of salmon was HUGE and delicious.
The fries were a bit undercooked and smelled funny. Perhaps the oil
was old? I just hope I don&apos;t wake up with a case of food poisoning.
It was so much food that I couldn&apos;t finish it anyway and having made
the acquaintance of the long-distance bicycling couple sitting at the
next table, my offer of my leftover fish and fries was eagerly taken
up.
Back at the hostel, the Israelis are celebrating shabbat, not so much
in a religious sense as in a traditional dinner sense with more than
enough wine. It was also noted that today is the second Friday the
13th in two months. Once again, nothing bad seems to have happened on
this day noted for bad luck.

Subject: 3/14-21: Torres del Paine National Park
Here&apos;s my Torres del Paine journal. I&apos;ve been out of the park for a
week already and this past week&apos;s journal entry will be much smaller
and posted relatively soon.
Once again, I&apos;ve found myself hanging out in one town for an extended
period. More details to come...
Mara - from Puerto Natales, Patagonia, Chile] 
Saturday, March 14: Puerto Natales to Campamento Seron, Torres del
Paine National Park

Woke up for an early breakfast after being told my bus would come at
7:00. My ticket said 7:30 though. And the bus finally came at 8:00.
It then continued its rounds to pick up people at a bunch of other
hostels in town. We probably didn&apos;t get going until 8:30 or so. The
ride took a couple of hours through mostly pampas and rolling hills.
There were guanacos and rheas to see along the way. From far away, we
could see our approach to the park and the three towers for which the
park is named, Torres del Paine, surrounded by larger mountains.
When we arrived at the park, we quickly paid our admission of 15,000
pesos and just four of us set off on the large &apos;O&apos; circuit from there.
Most others stayed on the bus to go further into the park or took the
shuttle to get to a different trailhead.
The trail started through pampas with an ever changing view of the
towers. Eventually, we lost sight of the towers and reached the
river. We followed the milky blue glacial river that had rapids that
made me want to go rafting rather than hiking. While it was wide and
flat in places, the water moved even in the flat places. At the
rapids, my untrained eye put many of them at class III and IV and
possibly higher in places. Windy areas brought back none too pleasant
memories of last week&apos;s hike around Ushuaia and had made me nervous
about the upcoming trip through the John Gardner Pass. I arrived at
Camp Seron at 2:30, just too late to continue the next six hour
stretch to Dickson Camp.
The wind was still blowing and made tent setup a bit of a chore. Once
up though, the tent withstood the powerful wind albeit with a bit of
flapping. I passed the afternoon and evening with an Austrian and a
Czech guy traveling together as well as one French guy, unprepared for
conditions he&apos;s likely to encounter. He&apos;s wearing jeans, has one
other pair of cotton pants, and no wind or rain pants. This is his
first ever trek.
When I learned to hike, I started on small day hikes and when I
started going overnight, I started on short one night trips before
venturing out for longer hikes. I have to wonder about all these
people (and it happens on the AT, as well) who think that a long trek
is a good place to learn how to hike. At least no the AT. there are
places to bail out within hours of most places. Not so for much of
Torres del Paine.
There&apos;s a British guy here with an interesting lightweight tent. It&apos;s
a Laser Photon by Terra Nova and weighs in at 800g including the one
pole and handful of wirelike titanium stakes. It&apos;s made out of a very
thin, single ply Gore-Tex which means it&apos;s probably very expensive (330
pounds according to the Terra Nova web site). It was designed for
adventure racing.
I cooked dinner in the lee of my tent with only a little coaxing of my
stove and pot combo. As planned the stove vaporized the alcohol
properly but when I tried to put my pot on the stove, it repeatedly
put out the flame. After a few minutes though, I was able to leave
the pot on the stove without any problems. Go figure! My pasta with
mushroom sauce was pretty good and it was nice to be able to wash my
pot when I was done. I could also discard my trash here as well as use
a flush toilet. If I had planned better, I could have brought shower
gear and made use of the showers, too. I guess I am entitled to some
services for the 4,000 peso camping fee I have to pay. Here in the
park, you are supposed to camp only in designated spots and many, but
not all, charge a fee. Unfortunately, the free sites aren&apos;t well
distributed so there&apos;s no way to legally avoid the pay sites. Bedtime
at 9:30. 
Sunday, March 15: Campamento Seron

After a cold night where I could never really warm up, it felt good to
get out this morning. With daylight savings ending here in Chile and
the clocks falling back and hour, it was just after 7:00am when I
started walking this morning. Because I was so cold all night, I
started out walking in all my clothes in an attempt to finally get
warm. Just a few minutes after I started out, it started raining so I
quickly took shelter in a tiny copse of trees and stripped off one
layer of dry clothes to ensure I would have something dry in my pack
at all times and started to put on my rain gear. It stopped raining
while I was doing all of this so I just left the rest of my rain gear
handy and continued walking. I should have put it all on the first
time. After another few minutes, it started raining again and I just
happened to be near another small copse of trees so once again, I
stopped and put the rest of my rain gear on as well as my packcover.
I would stay covered up as such for the rest of the day&apos;s hike.
I soon caught up with a couple just leaving their stealth camp.
That&apos;s one way to avoid the camping fees in the park.
We soon started climbing the headland over which the views were
supposed to be spectacular. Unfortunately, the view was completely
obscured by clouds and rain. The weather continued to deteriorate and
I was having a hard time staying warm. My fingers and toes were the
main problems. Even with the overmitts I bought in Buenos Aires for
Antarctica but never needed there, I couldn&apos;t keep my fingers warm. I
had mittens in my backpack but wanted to keep them dry for camp if at
all possible. The wind also picked up at the top of the hill and
going down the far side. I made it down the hill and took a break in
the first sheltered area I came to in yet another copse of trees.
There I was protected from the wind and from at least some of the rain
as well. I decided to eat some food and reassess my situation at that
point.
As much as I don&apos;t like to start hiking in the rain, I normally don&apos;t
mind once I am hiking. Today was different as I was having a hard
time staying warm. While it was wet and windy, it didn&apos;t seem all
that cold. Perhaps this is related to my thyroid problem? I was also
having yet more doubts about the wind situation through the pass. But
what really got me thinking was my knee. Last week&apos;s fall resulted in
what I thought had been just a scrape and a surface bruise. It hadn&apos;t
really bothered me much in the last few days and on yesterday&apos;s hike,
I didn&apos;t have any problems. But yesterday&apos;s hike was basically flat.
Coming down this relatively small 400m hill was also relatively easy
because it was a fairly gentle grade. But there had been a couple of
steep sections and I realized that the bump I got on my left knee last
week had to be more than a surface bruise. For those short steep
sections, me knee had been rather painful. I usually favor my right
knee and now it was a toss-up which knee to favor. And it&apos;s really
hard to favor both of them at once. I also know that the descent on
the back side of the John Gardner pass is a long and steep descent.
With all of these issues facing me, I decided to turn back. By
turning back now, I would still have enough food with me to do the
entire &apos;W&apos; if my knee was up to it. If I continued and turned back
tomorrow or the next day, I would run low on food and limit my options
on the other side of the park.
There were plenty of other hikers with me as I took this break. When
I made the decision to turn back, I told those that were there what I
ws doing in case anyone at the next campsite would think to wonder at
my absence.
The weather had continued to deteriorate and climbing the hill on the
way back was much wetter than when I had descended. But at least I
had the strengthening wind at my back rather than blowing stinging
rain and sleet in my face. I passed a number of other hikers on my
way back including the sopping wet French guy, other well prepared
hikers, and two Chilean girls who were also unprepared for the weather
and hiking in cotton who seemed unsure about their own abilities. I
caught one oftheir packcovers just as it was about to be blown off of
her backpack. A way to attach packcovers to your pack is essential in
these winds.
Going down the hill on the other side made me realize I had made the
right decision. It was the steeper side of the hill and it was very
slow and painful going for me. Four or five hours after leaving the
Camp Seron, I was back in site of the camp and happy to see smoke
coming out of the chimney at the main building. While not feeling
particularly welcome to go in the main building the first day, today,
I was going to ask directly whether I could at least go in to warm up
for a while. When I got there, I was surprised to see as much smoke
in the building as going out of the chimney and I was glad that the
caretaker was OK with my going in to warm up. They were just getting
the fire going as I arrived and were having a hard time of it.
Thankfully, it was soon blazing away and the draft was soon working
and taking the smoke up the chimney where it belonged. I ate lunch at
the table with a girl on a one day horseback tour. It was her guides
getting the fire going. Once the stove was warm, I joined her and
stood near the stove to warm up and start to dry all of my wet
belongings. Others soon joined us who were just starting the &apos;O&apos;.
The two Chilean girls also returned after realizing they weren&apos;t all
that prepared for what the weather was throwing at them. Since they
were near the end of the line leaving the camp that morning, they
hadn&apos;t gotten word to anyone going ahead that they were turning back
and later, a radio call went out to ensure that they had returned to
Seron when they failed to show up at Dickson.
At 4:00pm, the rain finally quit after it&apos;s all day onslaught. The
hikers crowded inside started going outside to dry gear in the wind
rather than the heat. I waited a couple of hours for the sun and wind
to dry the ground a bit and then set up my tent for the evening, being
very careful to avoid any potential depressions. After last nights
group of eight of us, tonight&apos;s crowd of 20 or so seems huge,
especially for this late in the season. This camp shuts down on March
24 and Philipe, the guy who&apos;s been overseeing it all summer, goes back
to Punta Arenas to work as a history professor. Yesterday, I wasn&apos;t
sure if hikers were supposed to be inside the building at all. Today,
we&apos;re not only hanging out in there all day, we&apos;re cooking there, too.
At first, it was only on the wood stove which was going to be hot
whether anyone was cooking on it or not. Then when it had cooled off,
I asked if I should put more wood on the fire and he indicated I could
just use the propane stove to cook. Wow! Backcountry cooking made
easy.
Unfortunately, the pipe that supplies the building&apos;s water had
collapsed under the flood from today&apos;s rain so there were no showers
and no fresh water to drink. An American couple also getting warm in
the hut offered to give me a liter of their pumped water to save me
from having to walk up the hill to the now muddy stream. Sweet! When
I had set up my tent, I had noticed theirs and it seemed vaguely
familiar. Sure enough, it was a Stephenson Warmlite, the first
manufacturer of tents using silnylon that I&apos;m aware of. They were
surprised that I knew of their tents.
We spent time talking over dinner. Then I journaled in the warmth of
the hut before going to bed. After freezing for much of last night, I
almost rented a sleeping bag to supplement my own, but the rain
brought a warm front with it and even with the wind, I was plenty warm
to start the night. 
Monday March 16: Campamento Seron to Campamento Paine Grande

I woke up to a very dry tent after a night of very windy conditions.
While my tent, a first generation Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo,
withstood the onslaught, the inability to pitch it tautly meant that
it flapped all night and kept me from sleeping as well as I would have
liked. Plus, with the wind, the tent kept pressing gently against me
through the night. I found that as long as I had the sleeping bag on
my head and shoulder where it was pressing into me, it didn&apos;t bother
me so much. At least there was no condensation to get pressed into my
down sleeping bag.
I said good-bye to Susan and Ralph Alcorn, the American couple with
the Stephenson tent, this morning. Turns out, we know many of the
same people from the PCT-L (Pacific Crest Trail) email list. She&apos;s
also the author of &quot;We&apos;re in the Mountains, Not Over the Hill&quot; a book
that I&apos;ve sold when working at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.
The walk out to Torres took longer than it should have but I was
dealing with a migraine that slowed me down a bit. I met Severine
along the way, a park employee from France out for a morning walk
before her shift at the refugio that afternoon. We walked and talked
for a while and both she and I seemed happy to have someone to talk
with who understood the concept of &apos;Leave no Trace&apos;, something
completely foreign to most of the park&apos;s visitors.
After wandering through the Eco lodge area because there were no signs
indicated where to go when I got to the Torres area, I was pointed in
the direction of the campground. I ate lunch and then made my way to
the refugio to get the information I would need to figure out how to
spend the rest of my time in the park. I was finally able to get some
good information when Severine came on duty at 3pm.
I ended up taking the 4pm shuttle to Laguna Amarga, where I had
started my hike three days earlier, then caught the bus to the
catamaran and took the catamaran to the Paine Grande area. I found a
tent site, set up camp, and then took a look around. This camp has a
quincho for the campers to use. It&apos;s a kitchen facility complete with
propane burners and cold water sink. The nearby refugio is for those
with much deeper pockets. Full meal service is also available.
There&apos;s a bar with drinks and snacks, too. It&apos;s also where I had to
go to pay for my campsite. Here, it&apos;s 3,500 pesos per night. They
give you a sticker to put on your tent guylines.
The sites are in tiny clearings between low scrub. I tried to find
the highest of the low shrub to offer my tent the most windbreak. In
the neighboring clearing, just a few feet away, two other hikers were
sharing a site with a picnic table between them. They were friendly
so I felt free to use their picnic table as my clearing is too small
for one.
The three of us ended up having dinner together in the quincho where
it was really nice to get out of the relentless wind and into the
relative warmth of an enclosed building. Of course, that meant
dealing with many of the other campers but it was a friendly
atmosphere. I used the propane stove provided in the building to cook
my meal. Many others opted to use their own stoves and cook on the
tiled tables built for that purpose rather than wait for a chance at
the stove.
On my first day in the park, I lost the mud basket to my new hiking
pole. I was kicking myself for not checking that the guy in the shop
put it on correctly. I should have known better. Knowing that the
piece of plastic was out there littering irks me. Well, today, I
found a mud basket. It wasn&apos;t the one I lost and it doesn&apos;t fit my
hiking poles, but at least I could feel a bit better about helping
clean up what someone else lost. 
Tuesday, March 17: Campamento Paine Grande

Happy Saint Patrick&apos;s Day, but more importantly, I can&apos;t believe it
has been exactly TEN years since the start of my Appalachian Trail
thruhike.
I woke up this morning to a gorgeous sunrise. Mist surrounding Grande
Paine and the Cuernos Mountains turned vibrant red with the rising
sun. My tent survived the night but since I needed my hiking poles
for today&apos;s hike, I collapsed my tent and ensured it wouldn&apos;t blow to
bits in my absence with a number of well placed rocks. The forecast
was for 60kph winds today.
Walking to Gray Glacier, I can believe it. I got to the mirador along
the way and couldn&apos;t stand up there. I thought about turning back at
that point given that it was much more downhill to go the rest of the
way to the refugio but then the Italian I was camped near caught up
and we walked and talked the rest of the way, frequently keeping my
mind off the pain in my knees. At the refugio, we caught up with
Dennis, the Czech also at our camping area. He had already been at
the mirador and said the wind was picking up so we decided to eat
lunch at the refugio campground and then visit the mirador. Turns
out, I was the only one who brought lunch. They just munched on candy
bars.
I&apos;ve noticed many of the people out here don&apos;t eat nearly enough for
their activity level. They eat a thin cup-of-soup type soup for a
meal, don&apos;t bother to snack much en route, and then have more soup at
their destination. Then there are the others who carry huge loads and
pack in fresh vegetables. Sometimes, they are only doing that for the
first night where they don&apos;t have to carry their backpack at all, but
some have the veggies in the backcountry.
The day&apos;s hike started in a valley, twisting and winding along a
mostly gentle rise, and eventually losing sight of the lake behind us.
Soon, we gained sight of our destination lake along which the rest of
our hike would stay. The morning&apos;s rainbow was frequently visible as
we walked along. Some bright blue icebergs were visible in bays along
the way well below us. A tiny berg further out in the lake finally
resolved itself to be the sightseeing boat that was positively dwarfed
by the icebergs. Continuing, we came to a rise and then got our first
view of the Gray Glacier. I could see two prongs entering the lake.
The mirador came up a couple of hours after leaving camp but it was
too windy to spend any time there. I got to a spot out of the wind
and contemplated whether to go on or go back given the rest of the way
was going to have a lot of downhill (the painful way) to get to the
refugio. I continued with my camp neighbor. After lunch at the
refugio, we went to the mirador. I stayed near the top, and got good
views of the icebergs and foot of the glacier. Also got a picture of
my friend near the water that put the rest of the glacier in
perspective.
After taking &apos;map&apos; time of 3.5 hours to get to the refugio, I took my
time going back and took 5-5.5 hours on the way back. This time, the
wind had died down a bit and the mirador was a nice place to stop and
contemplate the sheer size of the glacier.
Continuing down the valley back to camp, there were many lenticular
clouds forming in the near distance. They were stacked on top of each
other and strung along on multiple places. Many look like UFOs.
Their formation is a regular occurrence in this part of the world and
may be why Steve Fosset&apos;s gliding world record as well as many
other gliding records were performed in this part of the world.
Once back in camp, I re-erected my tent and went to dinner in the
quincho hoping my tent wouldn&apos;t blow away in my absence.
I did a lot of thinking today about how much more hiking I could or
should so. Not just here, but in general. I was told in high school
to avoid stairs and hills and my lifestyle has certainly taken its
toll on my knees. Every hike I do seems to get more difficult and
more painful, with more miles of having to be careful to step this way
or that way to minimize pain. At some point, when thinking about how
to minimize pain becomes my primary focus rather than enjoying the
natural settings around me, then it just won&apos;t be worth it any more.
As it is, for my immediate future, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be doing the
valleys which are the highlight of this national park. Oh well. I
will continue to do what I can. Right now, I&apos;ve got food to last
eight days so even if I just camp and look at the scenery instead of
hiking through it, that&apos;ll be good enough.
As a traveler, if I were to forgo carrying my backpacking gear, my
pack would be so much smaller and lighter, making for easier travel
between destinations.
Well, I don&apos;t have to make any decisions right now and even if I do, I
can always reserve the right to change my mind. :-) Or, maybe I&apos;ll
just research the world&apos;s best flat hikes.
Tonight, the clouds cleared, the winds settled to aggressive breezes,
and satellites raced each other across the sky. 
Wednesday, March 18: Campamento Paine Grande

Today&apos;s sunrise was not so spectacular so I didn&apos;t wake any of my
neighbors to suggest they take a look. I communed with the ubiquitous
rufous collared sparrows, bold little birds happy to scratch at our
campsites for any crumbs left behind. Here, with the quincho, that
generally means slim picking as most campers seem to be happy to eat
inside and out of the elements. I watched a condor off in the
distance.
I was a bit sore this morning and didn&apos;t feel like hiking. By 9:30, I
figured out why. I had a migraine. I took some Excedrin and the
headache was gone within an hour but a weird &apos;off&apos; feeling stuck
around. I was happy to do nothing and take a zero day here at Lago
Peho. The morning was nice so I spent some time at the picnic table
near my tent but when it got cold, I was happy to move indoors to the
quincho. Working Sudoku puzzles and talking with other hikers helped
pass the time. After carrying it around for five days, I finally
opened my peanut butter and jelly. The peanut butter, a brand from
the US is in a handy plastic jar. The jelly is in a plastic packet
that doesn&apos;t have any way to reseal it. Getting creative, I found a
small stick and split it to use like a clothespin on the folded
packet. Keeping the jelly in a Ziploc bag in my pot should keep it
from getting squished and squirting all over the place. I took a much
needed two hour nap in the afternoon and spent the evening in the
quincho. Like the hiker boxes along the AT, this quincho has some
shelves where hikers leave behind what they no longer want. There are
more started propane/butane canisters here than anyone could possibly
use. I managed to snag some powdered milk and butter that will make
this evening&apos;s meal a bit tastier than usual. I also grabbed some
bread that will help me stretch my tortillas out another day or so. I
might run out of sudoku puzzles before I leave the park. Yikes! Warm
evening and low winds for a change. 
Thursday, March 19: Campamento Paine Grande

Stormy night with dramatic temperature change as a cold front swept
through. It was so nice last night, I started the night with my
vestibule cover up. A few sprinkles had me pulling it down - just in
case the rain got heavier while I slept. The temperature dropped and
the rain started in earnest by 2:30 accompanied by the wind that is
the norm here. My tent was not designed for these conditions. As a
first generation Lunar solo, rain came in through the vestibule door
though it was a small enough amount that a small Packtowl on the floor
by the door absorbed most of the drops and the few that reached me
where I slept, backed away from the door a few more inches than usual,
were shed easily by the water resistant shell on my sleeping bag. At
5:00am, the entire campground was awakened by a bright flash
accompanied immediately by a huge earthshaking clap of thunder. The
thunderstorm immediately left the area as there were only two further
bouts of lightning, both followed much more distantly by their
accompanying thunder.
I finally got up and between rounds of rain, I moved to the quincho to
sit out the worst of the storm. If the rain had let up long enough
for the tent to dry, I probably would have left on the 12:30
catamaran, but it was mostly non-stop rain so I just sat and stayed
dry in the quincho. At 12:30, when the catamaran was leaving, the
rain let up a bit and I went back to check on my tent, left on it&apos;s
own since 7:30 this morning. The vestibule was flapping and open but
with the tent situation properly with the door away from the wind,
there were only a few drops of spray in the tent so I mopped them up,
grabbed what I would need in the quincho for the rest of the day,
sealed the tent again, and went back to the quincho.
The forecast is horrible for the next few days but the forecasts
around here have less in common with reality than any forecasts I have
seen for anywhere else in the world. If accurate however, I&apos;m likely
to skip much of the rest of the park. Also, many of my other plans
for this region are in question, too. There&apos;s a lot of hiking to be
done around here and with my knee, I&apos;m just not sure what I&apos;ll be able
to do. The knee injury I got in Ushuaia that I thought was a surface
bruise seems to be more than that. I think it may have accelerated
the degenerative process I&apos;ve been fighting since high school. At
least the Fitz Roy area is supposed to be easy so I probably won&apos;t
have any problems there.
The wind calmed to fits and starts by evening as did the rain. I&apos;m
just hoping the wind quiets for the night so I can get some good
sleep. The temperatures have also dropped and I&apos;m concerned I may
have another cold night like the first where I just could not get warm
enough. A couple of strong gusts came by as I wrote this so I&apos;m not
hopeful for a good night&apos;s sleep. 
Friday, March 20: Campamento Paine Grande to Refugio Torres area

I woke up well rested after a breezy rather than windy night. Plus,
the weather was dry so I decided on an easy five hour hike and shuttle
back to the Torres end of the park. If the weather is still holding
at the end of the day, I&apos;ll go back to Torres, spend the night, and
hope for a good night to climb up to see the parks eponymous towers.
The mountains around the campsite, obscured by rain and clouds all
yesterday, have been revealed and are now veiled in snow and ice
outlining all the cracks and crevices in the rocky spires. My walk
today had my back to the views so I was constantly stopping and
turning around to examine the views I was leaving behind. First, the
walk by the lake yielded beautiful views. Then across the pampas.
The wind was fierce and I was glad it was at my back. After
struggling with the wind, I was glad to pull into the Campamento Las
Carretas free campsite along the trail. It has a lean-to with a
picnic table inside. It&apos;s not meant to sleep in like on the AT, just
to provide protection for breaks, cooking, and eating. In my case, it
provided a well need break from the wind and I could care less that it
was facing a hillside just a meter from the opening of the lean-to.
At least I could have something to eat without fighting the constant
and heavy winds blowing by.
After lunch, I started passing the few northbound hikers that had
started at the bottom of the &apos;Q&apos; to head into the park. They would
have great views for almost their entire hike during that day but
would pay for it with the ferocious winds and all the dust and at
times, rocks the wind blows around. Sunglasses are necessary here,
not just for the sun, but for eye protection from everything that
blows around.
I continued out of the valley and into open pampas where the wind
lessened a bit. I watched a herd of horses and a flock of Black-faced
ibis settled uneasily near me, feeding a bit, then flying a few feet,
then feeding some more, etc. After watching them for a while, I
almost stepped on a European Hare, huge compared with the European
rabbits (cottontails) that I had commonly seen in Tierra del Fuego.
I soon finished the day&apos;s hike at the Visitor&apos;s Center, located so far
south in the park that most visitors never get there. I spent a good
half and hour perusing the well thought out displays. Summaries in
English were helpful but I know I missed out on a lot of information
in the much more extensive Spanish descriptions.
I managed to hitch a ride to the Laguna Amargo entrance with Helen and
Luis, a British, Chilean couple that met in Wisconsin, lived in
Britain for seven years, and now resides in Chile. It was much nicer
than taking the bus which never stops and drives at breakneck speeds
over the dusty roads through the park. With the car, we had the
ability to stop here and there to look at guanaco and their chulengas,
or baby guanacos, a fox that was obviously used to handouts at the
Lago Nordeskjold overlook, and many of the countless views of the
mountains.
Once at the park entrance, I had no luck hitching to the Torres
Refugio so just waited for the regular shuttle. I ate dinner while
waiting. Once there, it was dark and I had to cross the river and
riverbed with only my headlamp. I&apos;m glad I had been there nearly a
week early and knew the layout of the land. I found the campground,
paid my 4,000 peso fee, and set up my tent in a relatively protected
area. 
Saturday, March 21: Torres del Paine to Puerto Natales

I was up and on the trail by 7:00am, hoping to see the towers before
clouds moved in later in the day. It was an uphill hike on fairly
easy trail until an hour and twenty minutes later, I got to a sign
that said I had come an hour and a half and had half an hour to go to
get to the refugio. Just after that sign, I got to a windy section of
trail. For ten or fifteen minutes, I tried to get past that section.
I could actually see the refugio from this point, below me in the well
protected valley but after being battered by the wind, first in
Ushuaia, and now, for a week in the park, I just couldn&apos;t deal with it
any more. Even for a view of the towers, I couldn&apos;t get past this
bottleneck of wind on this day with winds forecasted at 75kph. I
finally inched my way back and started down the hill. Half an hour
later, I started passing all of the other people heading up the hill
for the day. I wondered if I could have gotten past that point had I
been with others but I wasn&apos;t about to trudge up the hill yet again to
find out. I know I&apos;ll have some regrets for not either waiting
another day when the forecast was for less intense winds, but for now,
I felt great relief at knowing I was putting these dangerous winds
behind me - at least for a few days.
I was down the valley by 10:00 and ran into Helen and Luis just
starting up. A short while later I was breaking down my campsite and
having lunch at 11:00am. With showers threatening which were mostly
rain blown over from higher in the mountains as it was sunny where I
was, I finished lunch, grabbed my stuff and made my way to the
refugio. I sat there for a couple of hours keeping company with other
hikers waiting for the shuttle. While waiting, I watched some
employees mixing beer and orange Fanta. Combined, it looked like
Fanta but it&apos;s not like they were trying to hide the fact that they
were drinking. (Apparently this is fairly popular in Germany if not
other parts of Europe.) I caught the 2pm shuttle to the 2:30 bus,
napped a bit on the way back to Puerto Natales, and was back in my
hostel by 5:00pm.
I was able to get back into &apos;my&apos; room but had to dig out my stored
bags from under a huge pile or mostly (all?) Israeli bags before I
could get to my clean clothes and toiletries. I stripped my eight day
stinky and dirty clothes right into my laundry bag and then stepped
into the shower. It took my three washings to get the shampoo in my
hair to finally suds up. I&apos;ve been out for a week before and I don&apos;t
ever remember needing to wash my hair more than twice, even in
conditions that seemed dirtier and sweatier. Maybe it was just the
shampoo that I took from the hotel in Ushuaia.
I finally got on-line and found out that for the second year in a row,
my credit card company saw fit to issue new credit cards well before
the 2010 expiration date. That means that I now have a useless credit
card with me. To make matters worse, my bank card also expires this
month. I&apos;m going to have to figure out how to deal with this
tomorrow.
I had dinner here at the hostel and sat with an Australian/Chilean
couple. They live in Australia and visit her family here in Chile
every now and then. While here, they take the opportunity to travel
and see other parts of South America. It was interesting to have met
two Chilean mixed couples in two days and been able to compare their
stories.
Back in a bed for the first time in over a week, I listened to the
owners of the hostel in the next room snoring through paper thin walls
all night.

Subject: 3/22-27: Puerto Natales
Hi all,
I&apos;ve been in Puerto Natales for the last week and expect to be here
for at least another week. As usual, when I stay in one area for a
while, the journal entries tend to get very small so I&apos;ve been able to
catch up this last week&apos;s entries very quickly.
As I type this, Gloria went out and in the tradition of this last
week, she made sure I knew she was going to the supermarket in case
anyone came by looking for her. In this case, the laundry lade from
across the street delivered the day&apos;s batch of laundry. Upon Gloria&apos;s
 return, she still found me sitting here and just handed me a plate
with an empaada. One bite finds it filled with manzana, or apple.
Delicious. Now I know what I&apos;m getting paid for my services. Wim
will laugh.

Sunday, March 22: Puerto Natales

Had my laundry done. Spent time online researching my options for
getting mail here from the US. Did food shopping. Sabrina, a French
woman I met in the park, returned to town and we went in search of
brownies she knew about. Being chock full of walnuts, I passed on the
brownies and was happy with a small cup of orange hot chocolate.
Sabrina, on the other hand gorged on a large brownie with ice-cream
and whipped cream with a very tall hot chocolate that included dulce
de leche layered in the bottom and maybe more whipped cream on top.
We went from the chocolate place to a pizza place for dinner. I was
glad I hadn&apos;t gorged but Sabrina managed to chow down on her pizza,
albeit a bit slower than the rest of us.
After dinner, we all went to a nearby cafe. Some got Pisco Sours,
some tea or coffee, and I had my first banana shake since El Salvador.
In Central America, bananas were bananos, and plantains were platanos.
 Here bananas are platanos and there are no plantains. There peaches
were melocoton and here they are durazno. There, corn is maiz and
here its choclo. Choclo is NOT chocolate. 
Monday, March 23: Puerto Natales

I woke up with a nasty cold today. Given that I&apos;m likely to be in
town for up to a week just recovering from this cold, I decided to
have my sister Lori send me my new credit cards here in Puerto
Natales. It&apos;s going to take 6-10 business days for the box to arrive.
 And since the &apos;Small flat-rate International Priority&apos; box costs the
same as an envelope and can weigh as much as four pounds, I&apos;m having
her put a few other items in the box as well. I&apos;m about out of both
ibuprofen and Excedrin. Ibuprofen is available here for a small
fortune like $5 for 10 tablets. Excedrin doesn&apos;t exist here.
Hopefully there won&apos;t be any customs issues getting them through.
Plus, my journal is running out of pages and the paper products here
leave a bit to be desired so she&apos;ll stick a journal in too.
If I get better and don&apos;t want to wait around town, I can always go to
Calafate and El Chalten and then return. Then I might take the boat
from here to Puerto Montt, another journey that comes highly
recommended to me.
Lunch of Ramen noodles prepared with just a bit extra water into which
a generous spoonful of peanut butter and some chopped cucumber and
tomato made for a delicious Asian peanut noodle dish that was much
better than the regular preparation. Dinner of bread with smoked
salmon cheese spread with cucumbers and yogurt.
I confirmed today that I am irretrievably missing the 300 pictures I
took on my last day on land in Antarctica. These are the pictures
that included me on a hilltop in a t-shirt, extreme close up pictures
of a shag, and pictures of three fin whales cavorting all around us
while we were on a Zodiac cruise. Argh! 
Tuesday, March 24: Puerto Natales

Breakfast here at the hostel is always pan, oven warmed rather than
toasted, with butter, cheese, apricot marmalade, homemade plum jam,
dulce de leche and hot water or hot milk for coffee or tea. I&apos;ve
bought some hot chocolate mix which has sugar but not milk to have
something warm to drink in the often cool dining room.
My cold is worse today with constantly runny nose and lots of sneezing.
More noodles for lunch. it&apos;s a good day to nap and do not much.
Unfortunately, today they started painting the ceiling in the
dining/living room. The fumes are a bit much at times. I left when
it got bad and did some chopping now that I anticipate being here for
a while.
I discussed the &apos;Israeli problem&apos; with one Israeli who like many
agreed that there is a problem but of course, he&apos;s not part of it. He
ended up making a sign in Hebrew with the hours for the kitchen and
computer. There are no other signs in the hostel. The Israelis are
the only ones who need the rules spelled out because common courtesy
guide them like most other travelers.
I got an email from Wim, the guy I went hiking with around Ushuaia.
He&apos;ll be here tomorrow and wants to start a stove making business.
Didn&apos;t spend much other time on the computer today. Too many paint
fumes. 
Wednesday, March 25: Puerto Natales

Another slow day or eating, sleeping, reading Michael Palin&apos;s
&apos;Himalaya&apos;, and doing more Sudoku puzzles. My Sudoku book is not
going to outlast Puerto Natales. I tried to go to the museum here in
town but even though I was there during hours, it was locked tight and
there didn&apos;t appear to be anyone there.
Wim showed up tonight with Vincent, a friend he had met on his
Antarctic trip. It&apos;s good to see Wim again but it was late, they were
hungry and I&apos;m still sick so they went to eat and I got online and was
just going to bed when they came back. 
Thursday, March 26: Puerto Natales

Hung out with Wim and Vincent. Breakfast at the hostel. Wim and I
caught up while Vincent went and bought his ticket to go to the park
this afternoon. When he returned, we all went for a walk at the
waterfront. There were a lot of sea birds there and inlaid elements
of the walkway included arrows pointing north and oversized shorebirds
such as the black-necked swan. There were also a lot of interpretive
signs not only describing the shorebirds, but the mountain views
across the water.
We also passed this large statue that I had seen from the bus and
puzzled over. It was a statue of a Milodon, a long extinct giant
sloth. The remains of one had been found in a cave 15 miles from town
in 1896. The cave is now a natural monument with a life-sized statue of
a milodon for perspective but the remains of the milodon were long ago
transported to the British Museum.
Unable to find a restaurant with a water view, we settled on a nice
place on the plaza. I had salmon (farmed in Chile) with a delicious
king crab sauce that was more like king crab in sauce over salmon. It
was served with fries and was delicious.
After Vincent headed off into the park, Wim and I went to take in the
Park introduction offered at a nearby hostel. Had I know about it
before my trip into the park, I would have gone then but now, as
someone who performs a similar function for aspiring long-distance AT
hikers, I was curious about what they had to say. The Erratic Rock
hostel which Wim had first mentioned to me as the Erotic Rock hostel,
is run by a couple of Americans formerly from Portland, Oregon. (For those wondering, the
Erratic Rock hostel gets it&apos;s name from &quot;erratics&quot; or glacial erratics , a term that describes rocks, often huge boulders, left behind by
glaciers in areas where they differ from the typical rocks of the area.)
The talk was pretty good though I didn&apos;t agree with everything our
presenter had to say. I mentioned a couple of alternatives to him
after the talk. Don&apos;t know whether he&apos;ll include them in future
talks, but the talk is certainly better than nothing for those with
little to no previous experience traveling in these conditions.
Back at the hostel, we played with Google Earth for a while. Then we
checked out Wim&apos;s blog where there
were pictures of me getting blown off the mountain in Ushuaia and a
picture of our soda can stove. He read his blog to me, translating
from the Dutch. Then, just for yucks, I passed it through the
babelfish translator. We got a good laugh at that, especially when
he, having described me as a &apos;professional hikester&apos; had it translated
as &apos;professional hiccupping ester&apos;.
We talked about doing some travel together that involves hitchhiking
that neither of us wants to do alone when he returns from Torres del
Paine. Given the wait I have for my box from the U.S., it seems
likely we&apos;ll be on the same schedule at that point. We eventually
started looking at journals of other people who had hitchhiked, or
tried to hitchhike, the route we want to hitch, from El Chalten to
Bariloche, Argentina (about 1300km). It doesn&apos;t look promising but
we&apos;ll see how we feel after El Calafate and El Chalten, our next stops
with convenient bus connections.
A couple of notes...
Gloria, for whom this hospedaje is named, has started calling me her
&apos;secretaria&apos;. Every time she comes and goes, she tells me where she&apos;s
going and when so I can tell whoever it is who comes looking for her
when to expect her back. Wim is much amused by this and is wondering
how much I am getting paid.
There&apos;s a new supermarket in town named Abu Gosch. It&apos;s just a few
months old. The name doesn&apos;t sound Spanish and the Israeli&apos;s tell me
there&apos;s a town in Israel with the same name. Nobody knows if there&apos;s
any sort of connection though. 
Friday, March 27: Puerto Natales

Breakfast with Wim and then back to bed waiting for Excedrin to kick
in to fight a migraine. then we did some shopping and I managed to
find a box just big enough to fit the broken hiking pole I want to
send home. Everything else I&apos;m sending (mostly the fleece stuff I had
made in El Salvador) will fit easily around it without too much extra
space.
I also took some time in the supermarket to take pictures of
interestingly named products. There&apos;s the soda named Kem. I have a
friend named Kem so took a picture to send to him. Then there&apos;s the
unfortunately named PAP, also soda. And Nestle&apos;s dairy products often
fall under the product line called Svelty. A fairly good but cheap
chocolate there is called Garoto but I haven&apos;t choked on it. Hmm, I
guess that would have been with two &apos;r&apos;s, anyway.
I&apos;m not back to 100%, but my cold is much better today and I no longer
wander the town with pockets full of snotty tissues, sneezing at every
inconvenient moment.
The Israeli&apos;s took over the kitchen this evening and were very proud
of the effort they put in for their very complicated meal. The only
stove here is an old style gas stove that looks like an old wood fired
stove. There are two settings, on and off, and the oven portion is to
the right of the stove and can only be used when the burners are hot.
Like wood fired stoves, if the stove is on, pots of hot water are also
on and boiling away. But the Israelis were completely ignorant that
others might have also wanted to use the kitchen. I pointed that out
to some of them who were sitting in the living room and they admitted
that they had never thought if it that way. No surprise. They never
think about how their actions affect others. It&apos;s the same refrain,
over and over again. None of them are religious but when they can,
they like to have their big group shabbat dinners and say a bracha.
It being Friday, they made a special effort, but this happens on other
days of the week as well.
Anyway, at 9pm, Wim and I went out to the pizza place. After eating,
as Wim enjoyed a Pisco Sour and I a Mousse de Toblerone (good, not
great), in walks Vincent. We were both very surprised. He was
supposed to be in the park until tomorrow and then go straight to El
Calafate without returning to Puerto Natales. But, he couldn&apos;t take
the wet weather and bailed. So he ordered dinner and the three of us
sat there until we got kicked out at 11:30 or so when the place
closed. Even though the tradition of a maddening siesta where nothing
can get done in the afternoon continues in these cold and far flung
reaches of Chile, that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that restaurants stay
open correspondingly late. 
Saturday, March 28: Puerto Natales

Nasty day outside and dissipating paint fumes meant I didn&apos;t go out at
all today.
I took the time to go through most of the papers I had been carrying.
I got rid of a bunch of them and decided to send another bunch home in
the box I&apos;m putting together.
I passed time working Sudoku puzzles and talking with Justin, an
American ex-Pat living in Thailand but traveling in South America for
a while until it&apos;s time to head to California for his little sister&apos;s
High School graduation. He&apos;s got an Argentina guide book with more
specific information about Ruta 40 than is available in my South
America guide book. I might copy some pages tomorrow. 
Sunday, March 29: Puerto Natales

Lucas is the dog of the house. He&apos;s a large tawny colored short-haired
dog with a huge head. He lost one of his legs at the knee to a run in
with a car some years ago. I&apos;ve seen much smaller three legged dogs
in the past getting around as if they never had another leg, but it&apos;s
a bit more difficult for Lucas. He gets around OK, but it&apos;s clearly
an effort. Inside the house on the slippery hardwood floors, he&apos;s got
the slide method clearly worked out. He also has everyone in the
house well trained. A bit of groaning at the door, and he&apos;s out for a
neighborhood jaunt. The only time he barks is when he&apos;s outside and
wants to get inside. He thinks he&apos;s a smaller dog and it&apos;s funny to
watch him fold himself up into a small ball to fit on some of his
favorite chairs in the house. Thankfully, he doesn&apos;t think he&apos;s a lap
dog. Today, he came into the living room and found all of his chairs
taken so he settled in on the floor. As soon as someone got up to go
get something from another room, Lucas was up and curling himself into
the chair - it was a clear case of move your feet, lose your seat.
When the guy came back, he was going to get Lucas to move until I
suggested another chair. Score one for Lucas.
I went to photocopy the Ruta 40 pages from Justin&apos;s guidebook today.
I had to wait a couple of minutes for the woman who was going to copy
the pages to return. When she did, she handed me three of the tiniest
apples. The were perfectly shaped and colored. I shared them with
Gloria and Justin, keeping just one for myself. When I ate it, it was
hard, tart, and just a bit juicy. Surprisingly good.
Looking for a book exchange at the Erratic Rock Hostel, I didn&apos;t find
anything that was immediately appealing but Bill, (one of the owners?)
allowed me to borrow Marching Powder from his personal (not for
exchange) stash, knowing I would return it before leaving town. It&apos;ll
be nice to finish reading it after starting it in Buenos Aires.
I had yucky pasta with boring sauce for dinner. I&apos;ve got another meal
or two&apos;s worth of pasta left. I&apos;ll give it a few days before trying
again. 
Monday, March 30: Puerto Natales

I finished Marching Powder this morning. It&apos;s a good book with a
fascinating story. I now have one more thing to do when I finally get
to La Paz, Bolivia. I went for a walk around town, took some
pictures, returned Marching Powder and picked up another book. During
my wandering, I discovered a small supermarket that had fresh
mushrooms. As I hadn&apos;t had any fresh mushrooms since leaving home, I
picked some up, bought an individually wrapped frozen burger, and made
it all into a great meal with bread and a salad. The burger was
easily the best hamburger I&apos;ve had in months and the entire meal was
delicious. 
Tuesday, March 31: Puerto Natales

Spent much time on the computer today trying to figure out if I could
prevent the Conficker virus from causing harm tomorrow. Based on the
fact that I couldn&apos;t load sites that had tools for cleaning the
computer, I&apos;m pretty sure this computer is infected. I tried to
upgrade the operating system, but as best I could understand, this
computer may have a pirated copy so I&apos;m not sure if the update will
take. Given that the other computer here is so badly infected with
another virus that it can&apos;t be used, I would hate for this one to go
down as well.
I also uploaded some pictures to an unlisted album in Picasa. I&apos;m
going to have a couple of people look at them and if they think it&apos;s a
good, rather than annoying system, I&apos;ll make them available to those
who ask. I don&apos;t want to use it if Picasa will spam people. I also
don&apos;t know if I need to be worried a out plagiarism and having my
pictures stolen. It&apos;s not that I&apos;m a great photographer or anything,
but some of my pictures are pretty good. I&apos;ll upload at the lowest
resolution which is find for on-line viewing but not so good for
printing. Maybe it&apos;ll keep people from stealing pictures. I also
have no idea if I&apos;ll be willing and able to upload pictures when I&apos;m
traveling rather than sitting in one town for a couple of weeks with
nothing else to do. We&apos;ll see...
I also read a bunch today and finished Ken Follett&apos;s &quot;The Hammer of
Eden&quot; before going to sleep.

Wednesday, April 1: Puerto Natales

Reana, Tim, and Reuben from Australia, New Zealand, and New Zealand
but all living in New Zealand are staying here at the hostel but all
seem to speak less Spanish than I do. And they are planning on trying
to find work in Chile. They are hoping to find work as architects and
a forensic scientist but realize that the best they may do with their
lack of language skills is to teach English.
As there have been quite a few guests with no Spanish language skills,
Gloria has turned to me surprisingly frequently to help out. It&apos;s not
that I can translate (my language skills aren&apos;t good enough), but I
can interpret a bit the meaning of each for the others. It works out.
Anyway, they were hoping to see either the Cueva del Milodon or the
penguins in Punta Arenas but when they heard most of the penguins were
gone, having migrated already, they decided to join me today. Since
the tours were overpriced at 15,000/person perhaps not including
entrance fees, we saved some cash and rented a car (diesel SUV) for
27,000 and drove the 25km to the cave. The road was well marked and
paved for all but the last 7km. The dirt road was a bit bumpy but not
so bad that we had to go all that slow. It was fun to drive for the
first time since November. Since they were all used to driving on the
wrong side of the road, they were happy enough to have me driving.
There was very little traffic and no need to rush so I calmed my
Boston driver tendencies and just enjoyed the ride through pampas.
The SUV we rented was a bit strange. It was an automatic which I
thought a bit strange. And then the signal controls were on the wrong
side, as if it were supposed to be a left hand drive car. I signaled
a couple of times with the wipers but soon got used to the controls.
Then of course, it started raining so I had to figure out the wipers
anyway. I had already done that when I tried to signal with them.
It only started raining after we had toured the cave. I was a bit
disappointed that we hadn&apos;t come more prepared. There were two other
caves on site that we didn&apos;t visit and a few kilometers of hiking
trails that would have been fun to explore. But, the others weren&apos;t
into it, being much more interested in having pictures taken of them
with their feet off the ground, jumping in front of the fake milodon
at the cave&apos;s entrance. They jumped, I took the pictures. My knees
hurt just watching them jump.
We stopped to take pictures a bunch on the way back from the cave. A
crested caracara in a tree and then flying away. Sun on far off
mountains (there was no sun where we were), waterfront pictures
including a large brownish heron I&apos;ll have to ID from pictures. It&apos;s
neck was folded in so I couldn&apos;t see it, but it didn&apos;t seem to have
much color variation. I first thought Bare throated tiger heron but
they don&apos;t come this far south. A stop at the market on the way back
to the hostel, keeping the car just in case we wanted it for something
else later in the day.
Then hot dogs for a very late lunch. Eventually a very late dinner of
a mushroom cheese omelet. Delicious.
I started Paul Theroux&apos;s &quot;The Old Patagonian Express&quot; facetiously
referencing a railroad I&apos;m likely to pass near if not take in this
part of the world. Timing will be everything. As best I can
determine, the train only runs on Saturdays this time of year.
The strange thing about the book was that it disconcertingly brought
me right back to Boston. Unbeknownst to me when I picked up the book,
it starts in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, just 5 miles
(8 km) north of town. Paul Theroux grew up in Medford and Medford is
where I lived for seven years until I gave up my apartment two years
ago to travel and hike. Even though the book was written 30 years
ago, what Theroux writes about his experiences getting out of Boston
on the train are just as true today as they would have been thirty
years ago.

It&apos;ll probably be a while until I completely catch up on transcribing
my journal, but here`s the last of my stay in Puerto Natales...
I`m presently back in Chile, successfully hitching north with Wim, and
fighting yet another flu-like cold. Ugh! So far, I haven`t let it
slow me down too much but sitting by the side of the road with your
thumb out doesn&apos;t take too much effort so we can still make progress.
More soon though, I hope...

Thursday, April 2: Puerto Natales

I`m still waiting for my box to arrive from the States. Today is the
first day that I could really have expected it given the 6-10 day time
frame listed on the USPS web site. But, Wim is back from Torres del
Paine already. With any luck, the box will come in the next couple of
 days that he`s planning on sticking around town, anyway. He arrived
back at the Hospedaje with two Czech girls, Jena and Lucie, that he
had first met in Ushuaia and then again in Torres del Paine. The four
of us had dinner at a parilla where they could all get massive cuts of
steak. I opted for chicken and only ate one of the two split chicken
breasts I was served. Thankfully, they do doggy bags so I took the
rest back to the hostel for tomorrow.
After dinner, we met four other travelers at Roberto`s, the Irish pub
in town. Well, I can`t say it was all that Irish, but they did have
Guinness. I got to sleep at 1:30. 
Friday, April 3: Puerto Natales

Still no box. I even checked at the PO in case they were holding it
there instead of delivering it to the hostel. Made an interesting
lunch of my leftover chicken, a hamburger, pasta and sauce, salad, and
the last of my mushrooms for Wim and myself. I ate hot dogs for
dinner. Then Wim, Jena, Tomar (an Israeli guy) and I went back to the
pub. I called it a bit earlier tonight at got to sleep shortly after
midnight. Today was my first truly rain free day in Puerto Natales
since returning from Torres del Paine. 
Saturday, April 4: Puerto Natales

Even though the box was addressed to me at the hostel, I still wanted
to check at the PO before the 1pm closing time just in case they
couldn&apos;t deliver it for customs reasons. At noon, an hour before
the PO was due to close, I was literally heading out the door to go to
the PO when my box was delivered. I just had to sign for it.
Woohoo!!!
After my box came, I had time to finish packing the box that I wanted
to send home and got it mailed off at the PO before it closed at 1pm.
It`ll make my upcoming travels (especially hitching) easier with a
lighter and less bulky backpack. I sent home extra warm gear from the
Antarctica portion of my trip, the backup DVDs I`ve accumulated, the
extra paper stuffs I`ve accumulated, the broken hiking pole which can
be repaired with replacement sections, and my first journal which
ended with the April 1 entry.
The box I received had everything I expected (bank card, credit card,
new journal, ibuprofen, Excedrin) and a few extras my sister put it:
Chocolate chip cookie crumbs (with a few whole cookies, too), and some
Passover candy which I sort of hid from myself to try to hold out for
the upcoming holiday that I wouldn`t otherwise be able to observe.
The meds are very expensive here so since it didn`t cost any more to
send the small box from home than an envelope, it was worth sending
all the other stuff, too.
Had I not been delayed here in Puerto Natales, I might have been able
to get to Bariloche for Passover. There, a fancy schmancy hotel puts
on a free seder primarily for traveling Israelis but others observing
the holiday are welcome, too. A few years ago, they served 400
people. But, there`s no chance of my getting there in time so I`ll
probably celebrate on Fitz Roy. I am a wandering Jew, after all. Wim
and I then bought our tickets for El Calafate for tomorrow.
We walked to the waterfront and made our way out the pier and then
along the more industrial part of the waterfront, having been on the
promenade already. There were a lot of boats pulled out of the water,
perhaps for winter, and lots of work being done on them. We also saw
a lot of birds, including a bunch of oystercatchers (austral?), one
Chilean flamingo, I think my first ever wild flamingo, and two
interesting birds with black and white faces, smaller than ducks,
don`t think they had webbed feet, but should be easy enough to pick
out of a field guide.
I spent time at an internet cafe, using Skype to activate my new
credit and bank cards. Who knew I could call US toll free numbers
using Skype? I was surprised. I also took the opportunity to talk
with one of my sisters. Then I returned to the Erratic Rock Hostel
where I&apos;ve been borrowing books to trade my Michael Palin book for
Michener`s &quot;Centennial&quot;. Its probably formulaic Michener but at over
100 pages, it should keep me going for hours of hitching on lonely
roads. I spent a few minutes talking with Bill, one of the owners of
the hostel, and found out that Deia Schlosberg and Gregg Treinish, a
couple that had walked from Ecuador to the southern tip of South
America, had stayed at the hostel. I had met them last October
shortly after they had returned to the US when they came to the ALDHA
Gathering to be our Saturday night keynote speakers. They had needed
a ride from the airport, an hour from the Gathering, after the Friday
evening program, so knowing I was heading for South America, I had
picked them up and had an hour to pick their brains on more practical
aspects of travel and hiking in South America than they might have
otherwise planned to present to the larger group the next night.
I finished packing and then Wim and I had pizza for dinner. Earlier,
we had found a pool hall so went and played one of the longest games
of pool I&apos;ve ever played. I&apos;m not the best player and neither is Wim,
but I realized as we played that the holes on this table didn`t have
the same cut away banked corners I was used to on pool tables. That
made the openings much smaller and the game much more challenging. It
took us an hour and a half to finish one game. Wim won but I only had
one striped ball left on the table. Not too bad.
I started to rain a bit only later in the evening.

Subject: 4/5-9: Puerto Natales, Chile to El Chalten, Argentina
Hi all,
Well, I finally started traveling again in early April. Here`s the
beginning of that part of my travels.
Next up will be the hitching portion of my trip. Not sure when I`ll
get around to typing that up as I`m leaving the town with the best
internet prospects for a while.
Oh well...
Mara] 
Sunday, April 5: Puerto Natales, Chile to El Calafate, Argentina

Our bus picked us up at the hostel at 7:45 in the morning. By the
time it made the rounds to the other hostels, it was maybe 15 minutes
later. It had rained a lot overnight and was still raining as we left
town. An hour later, it had stopped raining and we went through the
Chilean border, stopping so that each of us on the bus could get our
exit stamps in our passports a 30 minute stop or so. As usual, the no
man`s land between Chile and Argentina is huge. 15-20km later, we
reentered Argentina. With this smaller bus and the less strict rules
about transporting goods from Chile to Argentina, it only took maybe
30-45 minutes to get everyone through immigration. Today`s ride was a
long one through Pampas with fogged up windows blocking our views.
Found a cheap hostel for 25 Argentinean pesos a night. Then went in
search of lunch and ended up at Libertad with lots of tango pictures
on the walls and music to match. My burger came with lettuce, tomato,
ham, and a fried egg. Yes, ham and egg on hamburgers is pretty normal
for a loaded burger. The fries looked good but weren`t great. Oh
well.
It being Sunday, the car rental place was taking an extra long siesta
and wouldn&apos;t reopen until 6pm. So we went to the supermarket and
bought food for four days, enough for a two day backpack and to get
stuck on the road for a couple of days when we leave El Chalten when
hitching north.
Then we started hitting the ATMs only to find they were all out of
cash. We found two while walking around town. Then back at the
hostel, I was directed to one we had missed when walking through town.
No luck there either. I had the bright idea of going to the casino
thinking they would have one but they didn`t and indicated that the
only other ATMs were the ones I had visited. Finally, back at the
hostel, our host pointed me to two other ATMs. The first one had
money but a 320 peso limit. The second one didn&apos;t have a limit but
the computer was screwed up and kept giving me partial screens. After
cancelling the transaction three times, I finally managed to finish a
transaction and get more cash.
Back at the hostel, we got a ride to the car rental place with a group
that was returning their car. Then we were able to return the favor
and using the same car which we had just rented, gave them a ride back
to the hostel. Perfect! There, we rounded up three others to share
the rental car for the next day. Instead of paying for an 80 peso
each bus plus 60 peso entry fee for the Perito Moreno Glacier and
getting there too late for sunrise, the five of us are paying 200
pesos split 5 ways and will get there not only for sunrise, but too
early for the entry gate to be open. Plus, we`ll have the flexibility
of our own car.
Restaurants here are expensive but we found a sushi place which while
not cheap, wasn`t any more expensive than it would be at home. So we
had sushi and for the first time, I finished Wim`s meal instead of the
other way around. Played a card game called &quot;shithead&quot; at the hostel.
After having a room to myself for two weeks in Puerto Natales, I am
once again sharing a room with a six others. At least I managed to
get a solo bed rather than having to deal with the lack of head room
of a bottom bunk or the climb of a top bunk. 
Monday, April 6: El Calafate

Up at 5:00 and was surprised when the group of us managed to actually
leave within a few minutes of the 6:15 Wim and I indicated the
previous day. As I had woken up with a migraine, Wim drove out to
the park. It was dark with bright stars. I actually spotted a
satellite from the moving car. A couple of the others fell asleep in
the back. One stayed awake but as soon as we moved off the long
straight road he started getting sick and we had to stop the car three
times to let him out. I don`t know if it was purely motion sickness,
if he had partied too much the night before, or if something else was
going on with him. I wouldn`t be surprised if it was the latter. He
just didn`t seem all that well to begin with.
We had heard that it took a long time to get out there because of
all the rabbits on the road. People kept their speed way down while
driving out. We saw a few dead rabbits and a couple of live ones on
the first road and then after the turn to the park, saw four more
hopping around. These are the large European Hares, not the smaller
cottontails. The way others had talked, we had expected to see a lot
more of them.
We got to the glacier after an 80 minute ride and still before
sunrise. It was cold so we all bundled up in all the clothing we had.
Wim and I were glad for our wind and rain pants. The others must
have been freezing. It was trying to rain a bit as we started down to
the overlook but that soon stopped and thankfully wasn`t a bother for
the rest of the day. The walkway soon turned into an incredibly
overbuilt metal grated, elevated walkway with beautiful wooden
handrails. These walkways went for hundreds of meters to a variety of
viewpoints giving different perspectives at differing elevations.
We were here to see the Perito Moreno Glacier. It`s one of three
glaciers in South America that is considered stable. It gains about
as much ice each year as it looses. But, it advances very quickly and
calves very frequently. In all the glaciers I`ve seen so far, I`ve
never seen more than just a sprinkling of snow coming down the face of
a glacier. Here, almost immediately, we could hear creaks and groans.
It didn`t take long for us to start seeing chunks of ice falling off
the glacier and soon entire spires calving into the water, sending out
large waves. The peninsula we were standing on afforded a perfect
view of the glacier. It looks more like a collection of spires than
the river of ice with tributaries joining in from the sides. The
cracks in the ice are all shades of blue and purple. There are also
brown cracks where dirt had covered the ice at one point and then
gotten buried by more layers of ice. There are also areas shaded red
in the glacier. To the human eye, white is of course the predominant
color.
As the sun came up, it would cast the glacier in areas of golden
yellow and peach.
This glacier periodically advances completely across the straight and
dams the Lago Argentina. Then, it bursts the dam with amazing
ferocity. It does that on average every ten years but it had been
thirty years until it dammed the river in 2004. Then it has dammed
the lake again in both 2006 and 2008. It`s easy to see how it could
happen as it just wasn`t all that far across the water in this very
shallow area.
We met some people on a group trip as photographers. They were there
with David Meunch . I`m familiar
with some of Meunch`s coffee table books. I was looking for him as we
continued meandering the walkways but never saw him. One of the other
photographers, Lance Kuehne had
mentioned Meunch was carrying the same camera I was using that day so
I could have picked him out if I had found him. No such luck.
Wim and I took a boat trip on the north side of the glacier in the
afternoon. We came within 300m of the 60m tall ice face. In addition
to some smaller calvings, we were witness to one of the largest
calvings we had seen all day from the boat. Amazing! The floating
ice from that calving would affect not only our return path to the
shore of the lake, but the next boat trip as well.
After driving to the second boat launch area where we had lunch but
declined to go on the other boat trip, we returned to the viewing area
only to find we could no longer drive there. So in order to meet the
others from our car, we parked the car and took the shuttle in. I
went off to visit one overlook we hadn`t gotten to in the morning and
eventually rejoined Wim at the best one, low down near the shallows.
We watched a submerged piece of very old ice abruptly surface. It
must have been stuck to the bottom or been held under by another piece
of nearby floating ice. By this point, I had gotten more still
pictures of the glacier and not-quite-the-beginning-of-calvings and I
was determined, or rather very hopeful, that I could get video of one.
I had 45 minutes to stand there with my camera in video mode pointed
in the direction of the glacier. I missed some calvings but then
heard a crack and started rolling. I couldn&apos;t believe it. I actually
got video of the glacier calving, right from the very beginning. And
it was a huge calving. One of the largest we had seen all day and one
of the closest, too. What luck!
And in the afternoon, that face of the glacier was in full sun.
Beautiful. Somehow over the course of the day, I took nearly 3gb
worth of pictures of the glacier. Yikes! I guess it was all the
bracketed photos I took to ensure I got the right exposure, not a sure
thing when pointing at a lot of white ice and snow.
I drove back to town, stopping a couple of times for viewpoints.
Errands back in town included gas, shopping, returning the car,
loading pictures onto my hard drive, and a late dinner at the here at
the hostel cooked by our host. The lasagna was delicious but I wish
there had been more of it. He usually does beef but having had that
the last four nights, tonight was his night for a change and I was
glad for it. Eight of us ate for 96 pesos or about $3.50 each. 
Tuesday, April 7: El Calafate to El Chalten

With an afternoon bus out of town, there was no need to rush in the
morning. I finished the milk and cereal that has been such a nice
break from the bread and cheese I had been eating for weeks in Puerto
Natales. Then I took a walk to the nearby Laguna Nimez to see the
flamingos (flamenco - as in the dance - ah ha!). Eduardo had given me
overly simplified directions but I managed to find it anyway. There
were maybe a hundred flamingos and they were pretty far off, but it
was still nice to see them both in the water and flying around the
area a bit. They make Great Blue Herons look small. I had seen my
first flamingo yesterday near Puerto Natales. Today, just one
ventured a bit closer so it was nice to get a better look at them.
I realized only my way back to town how many horses there were living
just a few blocks from downtown. Cattle Heron were taking advantage
of them stirring up bugs as they moved around but the town dogs chased
the herons and kept them from feeding.
Back in town I bought a couple of DVDs but then realized I didn`t have
quite enough to bother to burn a new DVD. I`ll wait to the next town
where I have the option to burn a DVD to backup my hard drive. I
rejoined Wim at the hostel, checked email one last time, and then we
bought some empanadas on the way to the bus station.
Wim has a huge amount of stuff with him and it`s heavy. I have a hard
time seeing him hitching with it all but he says he can get it into
two bags. He grates at any attempt I make to help out. Like me, he
likes to be independent. But, I also like efficiency and so we`ll see
how it all goes over time.
There was plenty of room on the bus so we each had two seats. It
wouldn`t have mattered on this bus anyway. I think I have more leg
room on this bus than any other bus I&apos;ve every been on other than the
sleeper I took in Thailand. Lots of great views along the way as we
got closer and closer to Fitz Roy. At the turn off to Chalten, I
noticed absolutely nothing on the road that had continued ahead.
There`s a good chance we&apos;ll be hitching there in a few days. Yikes!
The bus stops at the visitor`s center on the way into town as almost
everyone coming into town is headed into the National Park.
In town, the HI hostel near the bus terminal was full so we ended up
at the cheapo hostel run by Eduardo`s son. It wasn&apos;t so nice but it
was OK. We had a tiny room for four people. We squished and made do.
Wim hadn`t felt well in the morning so we took it easy for the
afternoon. We had dinner at the restaurant attached to the hostel.
Turns out it was the most reasonably priced place in town and had good
food to boot. Wim had a huge steak and I had ravioli. Both were
delicious. Both the restaurant and hostel are named Ahonikenk. 
Wednesday, April 8: El Chalten

Slow morning. Went back to the visitor`s center which was incredibly
well done. They have a whole room devoted to displays on climbing in
the Fitz Roy area and another with lots of natural history displays.
The displays are in Spanish but some have translations on separate
fliers to be read while looking at the displays. They apparently have
a lot of time during the winter to work on the displays and do it all
themselves.
Unfortunately, the forecast for the next few days is rather horrible
but today was supposed to be nice so we quickly hit the trail for a
day hike. I had some fun taking silly Wim pictures on the way up and
Wim was a willing participant.
We went to the Laguna Capri, first for the overlook to Fitz Roy which
was spectacular in the clear blue, cloudless sky. The view equaled or
even exceeded that of Torres Del Paine with its grand spire reaching
to the sky. Plus, it`s now full into autumn and the trees are nearing
peak and full of reds, yellows, and orange colors. It`s not the same
palette as New England, but it is pretty.
Then we circled around to the lake and spent some time there. We
wanted to try to make it to the mirador on the other side of town for
sunset so we left after a while but at a different overlook on the way
back to town, Wim decided to stop there and skip the other overlook.
I continued on and planned to meet him back at the hostel after
sunset. But, a short while after heading down, I ran into a pair of
woodpeckers. I believe they are Magellanic Woodpeckers though one
reference I saw mentioned Patagonia Woodpeckers. These are large
striking birds. The female is black with a red patch around the beak
and white wind patches. The male has an all red head, white wing
patches, and otherwise is all black. They are large woodpeckers and
remind me of the pileated woodpeckers I see along the Eastern US.
After watching them for a long time, I was about to move along when a
large flock of Austral parakeets came in. There must have been well
over 100 birds in this flock. They are large green parakeets with red
along the back of the tail. They are about the size of cockatiels or
maybe a bit bigger.
I continued on but got distracted by yet another birds, maybe a
flicker, near the parking lot. By the time I got back to town, it was
too late to head up to the mirador so I just went back to the hostel
and found Jena and Lucie there. Hung out with them until Wim came,
equally surprised to see them there. Wim and I went for dinner. I
had a salad and he a lentil stew. Both good. 
Thursday, April 9: El Chalten

Wim didn`t want to try to leave town today even though the weather was
deteriorating. So we stayed to see Jana and Lucie off on their own
hitch out of town. After they left, we finally set off to visit a
waterfall just a few kilometers out of town. Given the peaks were in
the clouds, this seemed a likely prospect for the day.
To get there, we walked along the braided river and I marveled at how
big the floods must be to rearrange the river bottom and affect the
flow of water as much as it does. The waterfall was big but not huge.
 There weren`t any obstructing trees so you could get the whole thing
in one camera shot.
We had lunch on the rocks below the falls. At one point, I reached
into my bag and just before I grabbed it, I realized there was a huge
fuzzy caterpillar on my fleece inside the bag. I was able to extract
the fleece and caterpillar with no harm to either - or myself.
I almost left my poles behind, but Wim realized I was missing them as
we started walking. it was strange that I hadn`t noticed sooner but
we had been playing on the rocks without them so I probably got used
to the rocks without them for a while.
Shower and hand wash back at the hostel. then I shopped for some
hitchhiking supplies... A notebook and magic marker so we could make
relevant signs. I had a short and very expensive internet session to
let family know of my plans with Wim. Split a steak dinner and a
pumpkin ravioli dinner with Wim. A whole steak would have been too
much meat for me. Both were delicious. Then dinner continued with an
ice cream. We split a 1/4 kg of that, too.
I finished Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, a freebie book that I
had gotten in El Calafate that I really don`t want to carry around any
longer.
 [Date: Tue Apr 28, 2009 8:54 pm
Subject: 4/10-14: El Chalten, Argentina to Chile Chico, Chile (hitchhiking)
After traveling with Wim for over three weeks, I&apos;m on my own again in
a small town with nothing to do at night. As luck would have it,
there&apos;s an internet cafe here.
Here&apos;s the start of the hitchhiking portion of my travels. Wim and I
were both interested in hitchhiking but neither wanted to do it alone.
So we teamed up for a while and had a great time. We also both
gained a lot of confidence about hitchhiking in the area and would now
each hitch on our own. As a matter of fact, I had my first solo hitch
earlier this evening and it took less than a minute to get a ride.
More to come - sometime...
Mara] 
Friday, April 10: El Chalten to Gobernador Gregores (335km hitching)

Wim has so much stuff. It took him forever to pack but he did get it
all into two bags which is probably the max manageable for hitching.
At least he let me carry ALL the food for both of us as I&apos;ve got
plenty of room in my backpack. Together, we got our load down to two
backpacks and one day pack. It looks bulky to me but should be OK for
hitching, especially if we can get rides in pickups. We stopped at
the store to get a bunch of chipas, these wonderful cheese/bread rolls
for lunch. We have plenty of other typical backpacker type food with
us in case we get stuck along a road for a day or two. We finally
started out at 11:00.
It had rained hard all night and into the morning as we ran around
doing errands but as we started out, the rain was already clearing out
and we could see the peaks, spectacularly peeking through the clouds.
It was frustrating to realize that this was turning into a nice day
and we could have been enjoying it while backpacking instead of in
town. Oh well. The weather here is as changeable and as hard to
predict as in New England.
We went to the gas station to start hitching. Towns here are so
spread out that almost everyone would top off before heading out on
the road. In a short time, we had our first ride the 89km out to Ruta
40. Fitz Roy receded in our rear window as we drove along the huge
Lago Viedma. We got dropped off at the intersection I had noted a few
days earlier. There was absolutely nothing there except the
intersection. I was extremely surprised to see the car that had
dropped us off do a u-turn and head back into town. Apparently they
had just driven us to the intersection to do us a favor. That was a
90km each way trip out of their way. Wow! What a way to start our
hitch.
As usual, the pampa was extremely windy so we walked across the street
to where we could start our hitch north. We found a place where we
could keep our gear and maybe one of us at a time out of the worst of
the wind. So we dumped our stuff there. Wim took the opportunity to
go relieve himself, being careful to piss with the wind. He hadn`t
even finished when the first car came by that didn&apos;t turn to go to El
Chalten. It was a pickup and as I stuck out my thumb, it stopped. We
hadn&apos;t been waiting for a hitch for 5 minutes along an extremely
remote and infrequently traveled road and we got a ride. Once again -
WOW!
This pickup was only going the 34km to Tres Lagos but at least it
would be a better place to wait for an ongoing hitch. Wim sat in the
back of the pickup (his preferred ride) which left me up front with
the driver who spoke no English. So we talked what little I could for
a few minutes and then I just enjoyed the ride.
At Tres Lagos, we got dropped at the gas station. We ate, hung out,
and not too much later, the owner came out with a couple of steak
knives and indicated that instead of being bored while we were
waiting, we could help out if we wanted by helping to scrape the
multitudes of stickers off the windows that other travelers had left
behind. I think the guy thought we might do a few and then get tired
of the work, but Wim and I got into it. After just a few minutes, the
guy came out with a plate of food for Wim and I to share. Salmon,
potatoes, rice and ham, bread, and mushrooms. Wow! After our second
lunch, Wim and I went back to work. The guy left a few minutes later
to pick up his daughter and Wim and I kept at it. By the time the guy
came back, to the amazement of both the guy and his wife, we had
finished scraping almost all of the stickers off all of the windows.
At that point, Wim and I knew we were assured of a meal and a place to
stay if we didn&apos;t get a ride that day.
We had been dropped off around 1:00 and four hours later, someone
pulled up who was going in our direction and had space in his vehicle.
Woohoo!!! We had a ride going 212km further north in a newish Fiat
SUV. This guy spoke English quite well and switched back and forth a
few times when necessary to include me in the conversation. I always
use Spanish when I know it but switch back when I don&apos;t. It works.
Leaving Tres Lagos, we were off the paved part of Ruta 40. We saw
lots of guanaco and a few rhea along the way. We also drove over a
small armadillo that was crossing the road. I&apos;ve seem armadillos
pancaked on roads in the US but that was the first live one I had
seen. But, our driver wasn&apos;t a tourist so wasn&apos;t about to stop so we
could get a better look. We drove past rolling hills, grassland, and
milky blue lakes. We stopped to say &apos;hi&apos; to some friends of the
driver who were hunting guanaco from their pickup. They had just shot
one and I could see it 100m up the hill with blood running down its
leg. A few seconds later, it went down for good as I watched and then
two helpers, one with an ATV and one on foot soon closed in on the
fallen guanaco. I think some people used to eat the meat but now they
just use the meat to feed their dogs. I think they keep the hides as
well.
We pulled into town as the sun was setting, turning the tall trees
used as windbreaks a vivid gold.
Turns out the guy who gave us the ride owns a hotel in Gobernador
Gregores and gave us a 240peso room for just 120. That&apos;s a bit more
than Wim and I would usually spend on a room but it wasn&apos;t outrageous
and gave us a wonderful splurge for not much extra money. This small
splurge got us a room that would be nice even in the US, with TV,
towels, soaps, shampoos, a heater, toilets that can handle flushing
toilet paper, and toilet paper with blue puppies on it.
We found a place to shoot pool and had mediocre pizza for dinner
there. The pool tables here are what I&apos;m used to from other pool
places but Wim and I keep proving to each other how bad we both are at
pool. At least here with the banked holes, we could play three games
in an hour and a half rather than the one game we had played in the
same amount of time in Puerto Natales.
One big surprise for us today is the size of this town. Our guide
books barely include it but it is bigger than El Chalten, has at least
a couple of ATM machines, a reliable gas station, a bunch of lodging
options and at least one large supermarket.
A thought... While we would prefer to have our own wheels for this
trip, we probably wouldn&apos;t save any travel time. Our drivers go fast
and don&apos;t stop whereas we would constantly be stopping for this view
or that view or those guanacos, so ubiquitous to those that live here.
They drive fast on bad roads and we would go slower, not knowing the
roads as well. But time is not the issue and it would be so much
better to have our own wheels.
So this hotel, while quite nice, still has it&apos;s problems. I leaned
against the headboard and the lights turned off. They put a
convenient switch on the wall above my bed, but then put in a
headboard that hits the switch when you lean against it. Oh well. A
well placed folded towel solved that problem. In the shower, the
shower head is so high (a good thing in my book) that it shoots water
mostly over my head (not so good) and clear across the shower rather
than down into the tub. Once again, nice ideas have gone awry. It&apos;s
Good Friday today and Easter Sunday is coming up so there some
consternation about he amount of traffic we&apos;re likely to see along the
road as we hitch out of here. 
Saturday, April 11: Gobernador Gregores

Crappy &quot;free&quot; breakfast at the hotel. Finally got out at 11:00. I
would normally chafe at these late starts but with no schedule, I&apos;m
just taking it in stride and we&apos;ll see if it matters in the long run.
We started at the gas station but then after Wim had heard from
multiple people that the crossroads might be a better place to hitch,
we got a ride that far, just a few kilometers from town. There&apos;s a
detour right at the road out of town. Ruta 40 is slowly being paved
and there&apos;s construction going on here. We`re hitching just before
the detour sign so we know we can be seen. We were also sitting just
beyond the entrance to the autodromo, the local dirt racetrack,
similar to one we had seen in Ushuaia. We smiled and waved or thumbed
at all the construction vehicles going by, as much to give them a
laugh as to keep ourselves amused but we and they knew that they
couldn&apos;t help us out at all. We took turns stretching our legs. At
one point, I went for a &apos;drive&apos; around the autodromo, just walking out
on the course and pretending to race around, and do donuts. It was
windy and the wind got worse as the day progressed. We had fun
videoing our clothes flapping in the wind. We had blown grit in our
sandwiches for lunch. Three cars went south all day long and only one
went north. With winds getting increasingly bad and blown rocks and
grit getting worse, we gave it up at 4:30. We got an easy hitch into
town in the back of a pickup with three freshly caught fish.
We found a different place to stay that was a bit cheaper and a lot
less nice. Oh well. Along the way, someone mentioned the police
station radio, and perhaps a call going out over the radio for a ride
the next day. Well, it wasn&apos;t the police radio, it was the radio
station across the street from the police station. When we finally
figured that out after a visit to the police station, they were happy
to send an announcement out over the air. We left there, stopped at
the supermarket, and then made our way to the pool hall. It was too
early to eat anywhere as restaurants wouldn&apos;t be open until 8pm so we
shot a few games of pool and I wondered who I was playing against.
All of a sudden, Wim seemed dialed into the pool table and all his
balls were sinking fast. I was having no such luck. It got to the
point where it wasn&apos;t fun anymore. He was having to dodge most of my
balls to sink his and I just couldn&apos;t get any to fall. Back at the
hospedaje, no luck so far with responses to our radio call. Went to
dinner at Criollo and had a strange experience. It was as if they
didn&apos;t want to run a restaurant. No menu, so he told us a few options
and we ordered from that. I ordered ravioli and was surprised to get
cheese and spinach ravioli with a bunch of steak on top. Wim got the
Milanesa, a typical dish here of breaded steak. As others came in, we
could hear them ordering all sorts of stuff that Wim and I didn&apos;t even
know were options. As we were leaving, we met three Argentinean&apos;s at
the restaurant who were traveling in our direction. It would have
been great to go with them but there&apos;s no room in their vehicle.
Back at the hostel, the wind has continued and doors bang in the wind.
 The heater in the hallway is going full blast and it&apos;s so hot we have
to close our door to keep the heat out. Earlier, the outside door was
open to let the excessive heat out. Why don&apos;t they just turn it down
and not waste energy? This isn&apos;t the only place we&apos;ve been with
blasting heat and open doors. There seems to be no connection between
wasting energy and high utility bills here. Oh well. Maybe it&apos;s all
so cheap that nobody cares? At least one place we&apos;ve been cared so I
just don&apos;t know. A small wad of folded paper in the door kept it from
banging all night.
Walking through the streets, I became aware that every house has a
permanently installed garbage basket out front. The households put
small plastic bags of trash out for pickup. and don&apos;t need to put out
barrels. Many are standard baskets provided by the town but some are
specialty metal sculptures of men or other shapes holding the basket
or what have you. I&apos;ve seen this in other towns, too. 
Sunday, April 12: Gobernador Gregores to Bajo Caricoles (234km
hitching, 569 total)

Today being Easter Sunday, Wim and many others did not have high hopes
for much traffic on these remote roads. But since travelers rarely
stop for holidays, I was hopeful we might get a ride. We got an
earlier start today, not the 8am start I would have hoped for to take
advantage of all the daylight, but we were hitching before 9am after
walking from the hospedaje and stopping at the ATM. We decided to
hitch from the gas station today.
Once again, we got many friendly waves from everyone not going in our
direction. We were also surprised at the number of people working
today, even some of the construction workers were busy.
Finally, at 11:30, a small three door car pulled into the gas station.
 I think it was supposed to be white (silver?) but it looked more
brown with all the mud and dust caked on it. It had obviously been
traveling but from here, we had no idea which direction it was going.
Wim was soon talking with them and they were heading north. They
didn&apos;t immediately invite us along but when I went over to introduce
myself, they were talking as if we were going with them so just over
24 hours after we first started trying, we finally got our hitch
north. My pack fit in the trunk with their stuff. Wim and I shared
the back seat with Wim&apos;s backpack and day pack. It was tight but
wasn&apos;t all that bad. The backpack did limit our views out of one rear
window though.
The terrain here was not the featureless pampas we had heard others
talking about. There were hills, valleys, exposed escarpments,
distant mountains, and rivers to keep it all interesting. That said,
all views are expansive and distant. We saw more guanaco, rhea,
another armadillo crossing the road, and a fox. We were surprised to
get to a 56km stretch of paved road along the way. We know the road
is being paved but it seemed strange to get to one stretch in the
middle of nowhere, rather than near a town. Today we were surprised
at the number of vehicles going south. With only three pulling into
Gobernador Gregores yesterday, if most of these don&apos;t go into
Gobernador Gregores, then we&apos;re surprised at the number of cars that
bypass the town, the only source of gas for many miles around.
I realized along the way that the body aches I had this morning
weren&apos;t from carrying my pack yesterday and the dry throat I had in
the morning wasn&apos;t from the excessive heat. I was sick - again.
Another flu type illness. I&apos;m getting sick of being sick but don&apos;t
know if I would be sick less if I stayed at home. So, I would rather
keep traveling and deal with the illnesses as they come. At least the
hitching part of the travel is relatively easy and likely something
I&apos;ll be able to continue to do rather than have to stay in bed waiting
to feel better so I can go on a hike.
Our ride got to Bajo Caricoles where there&apos;s supposed to be a reliable
source of gas only to find there was no gas here. With their small
car and small gas tank, they weren&apos;t going to make it in and out of
the Cuevos de los Manos (Caves of the Hands) and then all the way to
Perito Moreno and since they have to be home to work tomorrow, they
decided to skip the cuevos altogether. We stayed behind an checked
into a hotel. As soon as we did, I crawled into bed for a nap while
Wim went exploring around town a bit. It&apos;s not much of a town, just a
few buildings at a crossroads. I had considered continuing to Perito
Moreno thinking a bigger town might be a better place to be sick, but
I have all the meds I might want with me so decided to stick it out
here in the hopes I feel well enough tomorrow to visit the cuevos.
After an hour long nap, I woke up feeling well enough to go out and
get some fresh air. I could see Wim on the hill next to town but
decided to just walk up the road a bit rather than tackle the hill.
Maybe in the morning, I&apos;ll walk up. I got back to the hotel just
after sunset and crawled into bed to wait for Wim. When he returned,
we braved the locals that were in the bar to watch soccer and got
crappy microwave pizza for dinner. Back to the room for antibiotics
for my stomach which is acting up, ibuprofen for my body aches, and
Benadryl to help me sleep well. 
Monday, April 13: Bajo Caricoles to Los Antiguos (282 miles hitching, 851 total)

I didn&apos;t sleep well last night. I was too hot and too cold. I ate
breakfast, took ibuprofen for the body aches and more antibiotics to
get going. Wim performed heroics and got us a ride to the Cuevos de
los Manos (Caves of the Hands) with a couple who had also stayed at
the hotel the previous night. They were also heading north afterwards
so we were entirely likely to continue after the caves with them. We
left all our bags at the hotel and piled into the car. It took about
an hour to get to the National Park. Once there, we bought our
tickets and then had to wait for 50 minutes for the next tour to leave
at the next hour. I ate more breakfast while we waited. Wim and the
other couple drank the ubiquitous mate. When it was time for our
tour, they had us don hard hats. There is no independent visiting of
the cuevos any longer. I&apos;m sure too much vandalism had occurred in
the past. I was the only one on the tour without a good understanding
of Spanish but our guide was happy to repeat things in English for me.
 Even Wim told me later that he benefited from the English.
The hand print negatives, made from putting a hand against the rock
walls and blowing paint around them, are as old as 9000 years old
though some are newer. They were not able to date the paint, but
sections of rock that had fallen off the walls and then got buried
with other rocks that were able to be carbon dated were where those
number came from. Most of the images are hands with 90% being left
hands, the thought being that the right hand was used to aim a tube
that was used to spray the paint around the left hand. One has six
fingers. One has three. One has stubs for fingers. There are also
pictures of guanaco, rhea feet, and hunters surrounding herds of
guanaco. There are jagged lines thought to represent the nearby
mountains. There are concentric circles. All meaning for why any of
these images are here and what they mean is speculative.
The physical area was similar to the areas with cliff dwellings that
I&apos;ve visited in the southwestern US. There was only one cave but a
lot of overhanging rock that would keep the area below dry if not
protected. There were no walls obviously created to delineate
dwelling areas though. The area ran along a fertile valley with cows
grazing below. A river ran through the valley. While much bigger
than the cliff dwellings I&apos;ve visited, when I clearly heard a cow from
the valley mooing, I inquired if they thought that people in the
valley could communicate easily with those along the cliffs, I found
they had never tested that theory. The woman who gave us the tour was
clearly interested in the other areas that I had visited. Our tour
which usually takes an hour and twenty minutes took an hour and forty
five, more because I kept asking a lot of questions rather than her
having to repeat everything in English.
On the way back to Bajo, we had great views of the mountains to the west.
Back in Bajo, we knew we had a ride to Perito Moreno (the town, not
the glacier or the National Park) if we could get in the car with all
of our gear. If we had thought our ride the day before was cramped,
this one was much more so. We rode in the back seat with all of our
gear and a bit of theirs. We sat next to Wim&apos;s pack and had my
backpack going across our laps.
It was extremely uncomfortable and for my knees, painful. I still
can&apos;t believe they did the three hour drive without one break to
stretch legs or look at a view. Oh well.
After refilling their gas tank at Perito Moreno, they drove us to the
roundabout at the edge of town. It was early enough to try to get our
next hitch. We stood there for 45 minutes before a car stopped for us
after passing us and doing two u-turns to come pick us up. it was a
great ride. Our driver heard my halting Spanish and immediately
switched to English. I don&apos;t even know if he ever realized that Wim
spoke great Spanish. But he was a wealth of information and we got
some great tips for the days ahead and soon changed our plans
accordingly.
He dropped us right at the hostel we hoped to stay at. There wasn&apos;t
anyone there so we left our packs in the back and went to dinner to a
place with a sign that indicated that English, Dutch, Spanish, and
German were spoken there. Wim declined to let on that he spoke Dutch.
I ate Chupin de Pescada, a delicious seafood stew of salmon, other
fish, squid, veggies, and potatoes in a tasty broth. It was
delicious. We had lamb empanadas to start. This restaurant was so
obviously run by people form outside the area. They were attentive
and made sure everything was OK and got anything else we needed in a
fairly timely manner. Usually, we order, get our food, and then never
see anyone again until we want our check.
We were able to check into our hostel when we returned. It was nice
enough except there were no seats on the toilets. Argh! 
Tuesday, April 14: Los Antiguos, Argentina to Chile Chico, Chile (17km
hitching, 868 total)

We&apos;re so far west in Argentina that sunrise isn&apos;t until 8am or so.
Getting up at 7am seems really early. It was nearly 9am by the time
we hit the road. We started hitching right away but were soon
directed to walk to the border control a fraction of a kilometer
ahead. We got within sight of the Argentine border control and saw a
road off to our left leading to a mirador. So we stashed our
backpacks out of sight and walked up to the mirador. The sign
pointing to the mirador ostensibly had it looking towards the valley
in Argentina we had just passed, but in reality, the view was to the
west, to the mountains in Chile and over Lago Buenos Aires as it&apos;s
known in Argentina (Lago General Carrera in Chile), the second largest
lake in South America after lake Titicaca.
We were soon down and through the Argentine border control but with a
14km long border swath, we could do nothing but wait until another
vehicle going our way would be willing to pick us up.
The fourth vehicle going our way was a pickup with nothing in the
back. Perfect for our purposes. Turns out they were an American
couple who come each year to go fishing in the area. They brought us
to the Chilean border crossing where I was prepared to trash my open
cereal and other food that I thought to be restricted but when I
showed the customs agents, they said I could keep them. We did have
to open our backpacks and start taking things out but when they saw
the rest of the food I had was all packaged, they stopped there and I
didn&apos;t have to take anything else out of my pack. For me it wouldn&apos;t
have been a big deal, but for Wim, it takes him a long time to get
things &apos;just right&apos; so he was extremely glad not to have to completely
unpack and repack.
We were done fast enough that we could put our stuff back in the
pickup we had come with and continue with the same ride that brought
us across the border area. That was convenient. Then they drove
through town a few times looking for their friends and that gave us a
chance to see what our options were in town. They dropped us in front
of the place with one hospedaje we were interested in but they were
full. So we left our packs there and went to the visitor&apos;s center to
get information about trying to get to the Cuevos de los Manos here in
the Chilean side of the border. We ran into Rachel there, someone Wim
and I had met separately in Puerto Natales. She directed us to the
hospedaje where she had stayed the previous night. We would have
ended up there anyway, but it was nice to have the recommendation.
She was on her way out of town that day on the ferry crossing the
lake.
We soon checked in, retrieved our bags, and then continued trying to
make our plans happen. Unfortunately, we couldn&apos;t find transportation
and a guide for the next day so we decided to just hitch out.
I did a bit of sightseeing at the tourist office/museum and the
cultural center with the boat the Andes on dry land next to the center
building.
Dinner was uninspired at a nearby restaurant and they tried to
overcharge Wim for his wine. We paid half of what they wanted which
was twice what the menu said and left the restaurant after our
complaints fell on deaf ears. Back at the hospedaje, I was too tired
to socialize and went to bed. 
Wednesday, April 15: Chile Chico to Puerto Guadal

Being in Chile means turning the clocks back an hour. That means
sunrise comes an hour earlier and I&apos;m back on Eastern time, the same
time zone I live in Massachusetts.
As is often the case in Chile, there&apos;s little to no heating so the
beds are piled with lots of warm blankets. They are often very heavy,
too. I stayed in bed as long as possible but had woken up early so
just read for a while. Once again, our breakfast was included with
our stay and as usual, there was cheese. For some reason, the cheese
in Chile all tastes like nothing. It&apos;s got texture and bite that adds
something to the bread and butter, but no flavor. It&apos;s weird.
Our hosts offered to let us use their computer rather than going to an
internet cafe so I took an hour or so to copy my pictures from my
memory cards to my hard drive. Yesterday, we had heard something
mentioned about a radio station but it was only when we were brought
back to use the computer that we realized exactly what they meant.
Our host runs the local radio station which is in his back yard. He
was also the head of the county seat at one point. While my
pictures were copied, Wim sent some email. Then we got on our way.
We stopped at an ATM for money and only then realized that with only
Visa cards, I couldn&apos;t get money. So, Wim took out a bunch for me
knowing I could get him back when we got to Coyhaique a few days up
the road. One of these years, I have to find a bank with Master Card
check cards - preferably fee free.
We walked to a good place to hitch which was at the base of some
stairs to an obviously great mirador. So we dropped our packs and
took turns going up to the mirador, keeping an eye out below as we
went up in case our ride came. We started hitching at 11:30. Every
town has tons of dogs and it&apos;s inevitable that every day, one will
latch onto us and just follow us around. We don&apos;t do anything to
encourage the behavior, they just chose to do it. So, our &quot;dog of
the day&quot; as we&apos;ve started calling them, joined us as we waited for a
ride. It joined each of us as we climbed the hill and descended.
Then, when we got boring and just sat there, it took turns resting in
the sun (hot) shade (cold), and chasing the few cars that passed by.
This one was a cute black dog smallish to medium sized, with white
marks on its rear paws and a white stripe from its chest to its belly.
 We got silly, making up stories for each of the vehicles passing us
about why they would or wouldn&apos;t pick us up.
At 3:30, we gave up and headed back into town to catch the minivan/bus
going in our direction. It wasn&apos;t going as far as we wanted it to but
it was a good start. For 6000 pesos ($10), we took a four hour ride
to go 100km to Puerto Guadal. When getting into the bus, we ran into
Angela, another woman Wim had met in Torres del Paine. The bus ride
along the lago General Carrera was beautiful. The road was carved out
of the rock for one famous 30km stretch.
My seatmates were also interesting. One found every reason to elbow
me whenever possible. I couldn&apos;t tell whether it was done on purpose
or not. They were also getting very drunk on beer as we traveled so
we had to stop for a lot of pee breaks. We also made deliveries of
boxes and other supplies along the way and went miles out of our way
to drop off one of the people on the bus. Cows, horses, and dogs, all
slowed our progress at times.
We got into town well after dark and the van started driving us around
to the hospedajes which for some reason were all full. He kept
avoiding the one that was written up in our guide books so we insisted
he go there but it was dark and run down. So he tried one more place
and finally, on the fourth or fifth try, we found a place to stay.
The ceilings were so low, I couldn&apos;t stand up straight in the upstairs
which is where our rooms were but we had fun picking out our rooms.
We each got a room and we could have whatever one we wanted. I found
one with a queen sized bed and a fluorescent light. The other room
with the big bed had an incandescent and I was concerned I would break
it getting up in the middle of the night. Our place was in the middle
of nowhere. There were no dinner options in town so Wim and I pulled
together a dinner for the three of us including Angela.
I took the last of my Benadryl as much to help sleep as for the nasal
symptoms I now have. We&apos;ll all be traveling together to Puerto
Tranquilo tomorrow where Wim and I (and maybe Angela) will visit the
marble caves. 
Thursday, April 16: Puerto Guadal to Puerto Tranquilo (30km hitching
plus 20km bus ride)

Puerto Guadal is 10km shy of the Carratera Austral so this morning,
our hosts arranged for us to hitch a ride with a local transport going
through the next town - no charge. It dropped us at the intersection
where an hour or so later a bus would come. We started hitching
anyway and although there wasn&apos;t much traffic, we did get a ride about
halfway to Puerto Tranquilo. We rode in the back of the pickup much
to Wim&apos;s delight. It&apos;s a great place to take pictures from but left
our butts a bit bruised.
They let us out in the middle of nowhere. We hoped to hitch the rest
of the way but after an hour, with no traffic to speak of, the bus
came. We flagged it down and took that the rest of the way to town.
They only charged us for the distance we travelled with the bus.
Gotta love the system here. Plus the bus had windows that opened so
we could still take pictures. We continued to follow the same lake
now for the third day and the views continue to amaze. The water is a
vivid aqua blue.
In town, the three of us soon found lodging in an inexpensive cabaa.
Then we arranged for our boat trip to see the Capilla de Mrmol or the
marble chapel. We got settled into the small boat and only then, when
we got under way, did Angela let on that she hated boats, especially
small ones like the one we were in. But, the way was pretty smooth
and she did OK. There was a bit of spray so Angela and I put on our
rain pants as we went. Then we got to the caves area. The water in
some areas of the shore is slowly undercutting the rock in the most
amazing formations. The holes are so large the entire boat can go
through some of the tunnels created by the wave action. I would love
to do this trip by kayak sometimes but that could only be done on a
day with little wind and wave action. We not only went through some
tunnels, but poked into others with no outlets and circled some sea
stacks also undercut.
Back in town, we had tomato, avocado, and cheese sandwiches for lunch.
 We visited one of the supermarkets in town afterwards. It was the
size of my last living room, that is, very small. We then walked back
to the cabaa past the church and plaza, performing a Rocky like dance
at the top of the much too short staircase leading to the top of the
tiny hill. The rain started so we were forced back into our cabaa.
I looked so bad to Wim and Angela that they put me in the room with
the large bed. I then took a much needed one hour nap. Pigs snuffled
outside our door. Another shopping spree later for the smallest onion
we could find and ended up with a one kilo onion. It was huge and we
only needed a small portion of it. Wim and Angela cooked our tuna and
egg salad with mashed potatoes. I cleaned. 
Friday, April 17: Puerto Tranquilo to Villo Cerro Castillo (130km by bus)

Roosters woke us up but not all that early. We got out early enough
to hitch for 1-1.5 hours before the bus came but we had no luck so
hoped onto the bus for the ride to Coihaique. Here in Chile, buses
are much more affordable than in Argentina so it doesn&apos;t make sense to
let buses pass to keep on hitching these remote roads. When the bus
came, it was a bit crowded so we all ended up in the back seat with me
in the middle so I could stick my legs down the aisle in the middle of
the bus. The windows on this bus did not open so we just watched the
passing scenery. Whereas Ruta 40 in Argentina went through open
pampas with sweeping vistas, here on the Carretera Austral, we still
have great views but we&apos;re often in narrower valleys, with lots of
trees. It&apos;s peak fall foliage season in many of the areas we are
currently traveling through so the mountains are aflame with reds,
yellows, and orange. We are now traveling in and along the Andes
rather than viewing them from afar. As Such, the road twists and
winds much more here than in the pampas.
There&apos;s also a lot more rain on this side so the road is muddy rather
than dusty. It rains a bit here and there as we drive.
After 1.5 hours, we came to a view of a huge majestic butte and we
realized we were looking at Cerro Castillo. Then we approached the
town of Villa Cerro Castillo and it looked beautiful So rather than
continue to Coihaique as planned, we all got off the bus here. I was
nursing a migraine so watched the backpacks as Wim and Angela went to
find a place to stay. By the time they came back, I had taken
Excedrin and eaten something. We soon checked into a triple room at a
nearby hospedaje.
Then Wim had lunch in a converted bus. I had eaten when taking my
headache meds and Angela had made herself a lunch that she ate.
There&apos;s hiking in the area but still fighting the flu, I didn&apos;t feel
up for that. I did however, recognize horse country and expressed a
desire to find horses for rent. Angela was also interested and Wim
was willing enough so we went looking for information. First we found
a sign indicating horses for rent. Then we found the horses. But we
couldn&apos;t find anyone to get us set up. Along the way, we met someone
who mentioned a special day of riding the next day that we could
probably join. But the person responsible was busy and would be back
later.
So, we went for a walk, hung out on a bridge over a deep and narrow
gorge just south of town, and eventually headed for the local &apos;manos&apos;
paintings. We ended up getting a ride there which was just as well
from my point of view. Then we wandered unattended to the hand prints
here. Many more right hands than we had seen before as well as more
positive rather than negative prints. We got a ride a short way back
towards town and walked the rest.
Back in town, we found those responsible for the horseback riding the
next day and were soon signed up for what promised to be a full day,
not just riding but experiencing other truly local events. From what
I could figure out, we would be the only non-Chileans along for the
ride.
Back at the hostel, I had enough of a second wind to help cook but
went to sleep shortly after eating. 
Saturday, April 18: Villa Cerro Castillo

We got up at 7:30 and made it to our rendezvous point by 8:30. Then
we stood around for an hour waiting until the horses and a film crew,
including interviewers, were ready to go. Then gave us half chaps to
wear, just like gaiters for hiking but out of leather. Finally, we
got on our way. Wim who had only ever once before been on a horse,
lagged way behind. They probably gave him a placid horse but they
should have given him one that liked to be with the crowd. I was on a
responsive horse that mostly paid attention to me. It wasn&apos;t without
its quirks though. My horse never wanted to lead the group but was
happy to go whatever speed I wanted as long as there was a horse in
front of it. It also liked to scratch its nose on the rump of the
horse in front of me so I had to keep both of us from getting kicked
at times. And then there were the times when it either knowingly or
ignorantly tried to brush me off, passing too close to other horses.
Mostly though, these weren&apos;t problems. Once I had figured it all out,
I could avoid the situations reasonably easily.
A short time into our ride, we were joined by another larger group
that had started out at 6:30 in the morning.
Our entire ride was along a valley with views of Cerro Castillo along
the way. It was an amazing place to ride. We both crossed and rode
in quite a bit of water with a lot of splashing going on. Mostly
though, it was along dirt road that made me really want to go. Only
near our destination did I really have the opportunity to let go and
ride at better than a jog.
Our destination was a ranch. Once there, we watched as cattle were
brought in for branding and ear marking. Thankfully, there was no
castrating going on. It seemed like fishing in a barrel. A dozen
gauchos with lariats stood in a circle a few meters from the edge of
the ring and from a holding pen, one at a time, a cow was singled out
and forced into the ring. In order to bring it down, it had to be
running so there was much yelling, whistling, and barking of dogs to
get those that preferred to stand to move so their legs could be
lassoed. They were eventually brought down onto one side, branded,
and had their ears cut. They bellowed for a short time but within
seconds were chased out of the ring and were soon grazing nearby as if
nothing untoward had just happened to them.
I realized as I was watching that while I had seem similar action in
the rodeos I had visited in the US southwest, these actions were for
business. The cattle here are beef cattle and keeping track of
ownership of these animals is absolutely necessary for eventually
having them turn up on dinner tables.
Speaking of food, after the brandings, we went to the main house for
asado. There we found an open campfire with three very large cuts of
beef cooking over the fire as well as one closed pan on which steaks
were cooked. We started with the steaks. There were no plates, just
pan (rolls) to hold the steaks. Once those were eaten, it was time
for the asado. Those in the know which was just about everyone but
us, brought their own very sharp knives. You just walk up to the beef
over the fire and cut off the piece you want. Wim&apos;s knife was
adequate but the others cut tough cuts of meat like butter. Mostly,
if someone saw me looking at one of the pieces of beef, they would
step forward and cut me a piece. I had one piece that was mostly fat
which after I nibbled the meat off, the dogs were happy to get the
fat. Then I had another piece which tasted great but was a little
tough. I ran out of room at that point as there were also boiled
potatoes going around, salad stuffs, and more bread. Still no plates
or silverware so you just had to manage. The two vegetarians got
plates to eat more of the potatoes and salad stuffs. Angela was one
though she tasted the meat just for yucks.
There was music from a very old accordion being played by one of the
gauchos. Some people danced to it. They were also playing a
horseshoes like betting game. This weird object sandwiched between
two pieces of metal had to land in a pit but often got deflected out
of the pit. I found out later that the white piece sandwiched between
the metal pieces was a piece of ankle bone from a cow.
We had arrived at the ranch at about noon and didn&apos;t saddle up for the
ride back until about 4pm. With the sun behind the mountains, it was
a colder but faster ride back to town. We had a lot of periods with
extended gallops. It was a lot of fun especially since this was the
most comfortable saddle I&apos;ve used in years. Other saddles I had used
in Central America were too small and extremely painful. This one had
a lower pommel, no horn, and was covered in a thick sheepskin that
worked wonders as a cushion.
Once back in town, we had parrilla for dinner, or barbecue. This time
on a more recognizable barbecue, on a grate over coals. More meat,
potatoes, and salad. Then there was dancing. They started with some
traditional dances but soon transitioned to modern stuff. I preferred
the traditional music but got to dance to the other. The local men
will not dance with a partner my height. The videographer kept
pulling me up for dancing but nothing partnered. But he was a lot of
fun and we kept not only ourselves amused, but the other there as
well.
I was about to call it quits when someone pulled a guitar out. That
was worth staying for. Three people took turns handing the guitar off
between songs. But, half an hour later, the party broke up.
This entire day cost 25,000 pesos or about 42 dollars including 5
hours of horseback riding, guides, two large meals, drink (alcoholic
and non), and the dance. The three of us were the only non-Chileans
there. There&apos;s no way we could have planned a day like that for
ourselves. We just got lucky. Days like this are what we always hope
for when traveling. I crawled into bed at 1:00, tired, sore, and
happy. 
Sunday, April 19: Villa Cerro Castillo

Slept late and then enjoyed a much needed shower. Then put on my dirt
clothes. Oh well. We had breakfast and then went for a hike. I&apos;m
still taking it easy so they went on ahead. I kept hiking slowly
until I got distracted by what was probably a family grouping of
Magellanic Woodpeckers. There was one adult male with a bright red
head and the rest were all black except for a red ring around their
beaks and white wing markings. I could see at least four at one point
and hear at least one or two others at the same time. They were
fascinating to watch and listen to. As they moved, it seemed like
they had to announce their new location to the others before staying
silent for a short time (maybe listening for movement by the insects
in the trees) and then they would start pecking away at the trees.
There were times when there were two on the same tree and three within
one frame of my camera. I stayed and watched them for over an hour.
I then continued but came to an amazing viewpoint almost immediately.
I could look down into a gaping gorge with a whitewater river running
through it or look up to glaciers below the imposing peak of Cerro
Castillo. I stopped there for lunch, wrote in my journal, and then
started down. As I neared town, I found a patch of scrub and trees
with a lot of bird life including a smaller variety of woodpecker that
I haven&apos;t been able to identify yet.
I got back at 4:30. Wim and Angela returned at 5:30 having gotten
lost but still having had a great hike and a good day.
Dinner of guacamole on bread then ramen noodles with tuna, tomato,
carrot and onion. They watched the Simpsons in Spanish. I read.
I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;ve admitted it to themselves yet, but Angela and
Wim are a couple and have been almost since the day we met Angela in
Chile Chico. I&apos;m beginning to feel like a third wheel so I&apos;m not sure
how long the travel partnership I have with Wim will continue,
especially since we&apos;re already triple and three people hitching seems
unlikely. Maybe tomorrow in Coihaique, I&apos;ll find out if we&apos;re still
traveling together.
In the meantime, Wim and I have frequently run into signs that say &apos;tu
usted aqui&apos; (you are here) and we keep joking about how we can&apos;t get
away from here or here we are again, etc. We also frequently find
ourselves being accompanied by dogs. Almost always, there&apos;s one dog
that latches onto us early in the day and stays with us wherever we
go. We never encourage them. We never feed them. But they stay with
us when we walk, wait at doors when we go inside our hospedaje or a
store, and then move with us as we do about town. We&apos;ve come to call
them our &apos;dog of the day&apos;. 
Monday, April 20: Villa Cerro Castillo to Coihaique (97km by bus)

Good breakfast of bread, butter, banana, yogurt, and cheese. Then
after sleeping late, the three of us started hitching. No luck so we
eventually took the bus. The ride to Coihaique was along completely
paved road, the first time that&apos;s happened to us in weeks. The area
we drone through was beautiful. Valleys and mountains and rolling
hillside.
Getting into town was a shock. There was traffic and a lot of it.
Traffic jams, even. Traffic lights, lots of shops, and most
surprising, expensive hospedajes that were full in this off season
time. Plus the attitude of the people renting the rooms left a lot to
be desired. Usually those in the hospitality industry are hospitable.
 No necessarily so here. Weird. We ended up looking at a bunch of
places before settling on one. We retrieved our packs from the first
place we had tried that was full and settled in. Then hit the
internet cafe.
For dinner, Wim and I shared a huge plate of Pichanga. When I first
heard the name, I thought it was a dance, but the dance is the
pachanga. Pichanga is a melange of french fries, chorizo, beef, hot
dogs, avocado, pickled vegetables, hard boiled egg, and cheese. We
were told the grande was enough for three and there was certainly
plenty left on our plate when we were done.
Bad TV back at the room before bed. 
Tuesday, April 21: Coihaique

With no hot water for our showers, we moved hostels after breakfast.
We&apos;re now in a four bed attic room where I have to duck to go through
doors and can only stand up in the very middle of the room. This new
hostel which seemed promising yesterday, turned into a nickel and
diming establishment. We could use the kitchen - for a fee. When I
took a shower right after checking in, I was told there was only one
shower per person per night paid. When we left with bags of laundry
for the laundramat, she wanted us to do our laundry at the hospedaje
even though she was charging an absurd amount per kilo. Usually, the
hospedaje&apos;s offer competitive or better rates for laundry - at least
they did further south. She gives the three of us one key and then
complains if one of us returns without the others and needs to ring
the bell to get in. This after telling us she would be back so we
could get into the house at 11:00 to check in, only to leave us
standing outside until 11:30 with all of our gear. This is the only
hospedaje I&apos;ve been to where the kitchen and living room doors have
locks on them to keep out the guests.
We&apos;re all getting fed up with Coihaique so we ran around getting the
information we needed to get out of here tomorrow.
We had all hoped to go through Chaiten, a town north of here that has
been wracked by a volcano twice in the last year, the last time in
February. The government wants to relocate the entire town.
Transportation options seems a bit limited but not impossible. The
biggest problem is that all the buses that go there go to meet the
ferry that would take us away from there. We were told there were no
other services available in the town. Finally, we figured out we can
get there one day by bus if necessary as traffic there is supposed to
be non-existent and then take the ferry the next day. We&apos;ll go
prepared to camp or even just sit up overnight to wait for the ferry.
I spent more time online and then me the others back at the hospedaje.
Later, when Angela had run out to do an errand without the key and the
doorbell rang, I ran down to answer the door only to find our friend
Malienko who we had met on the horseback ride a couple of days
earlier. He came over to tell us when and where he and some others
would be meeting for music that evening. The owner surprisingly
didn&apos;t have a problem with him coming up to our room even though he
wasn&apos;t staying there. Then Wim ran down to answer the door when it
next rang to let Angela back in. I can&apos;t imagine what the hospedaje
owner was thinking.
We went to dinner at a restaurant with a great menu. Unfortunately,
both Angela&apos;s and Wim&apos;s first choices weren&apos;t available and then even
Wim&apos;s second choice wasn&apos;t available. We eventually had a good dinner
even though Angela&apos;s Ceasar salad ordered off the vegetarian menu had
chicken in it. She&apos;s been trying to eat a bit more chicken and meat
so she ate some of the chicken and pushed the rest to the side. After
my pasta, I ordered dessert and splurged and had it with hot chocolate
as this is one of the few places with an espresso machine and steamed
milk. The hot chocolate was better than the cake layered with manjar
(dulce de leche in Chile), crema, and topped with chocolate ganache.
Malienko caught up with us again at the restaurant purely by accident
but then we were able to go with him to the club which ended up being
a salsa club.
I did a few dances with Malienko who knows salsa much o everyone
else&apos;s amusement. He&apos;s not just shorter than me, he&apos;s short for a
local so he got some good natured ribbing but mostly we were
complimented on our dancing. He danced with all the women in our
group. One other knew the dance a bit, and two didn&apos;t know the dance
at all. Unfortunately, he&apos;s a dancer not a teacher. Oh well.
During the evening, lots of alcohol was running and with inhibitions
lowered, Wim and Angela finally figured out that they were a couple.
It started raining again this evening.
Ah yes... For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;m no longerhitchhiking partners
with Wim but we&apos;ll continue to travel together until our paths diverge
- maybe tomorrow if nothing else happens to keep us going in the same
direction. 
Wednesday, April 22: Coihaique to Puerto Puyhuapi (214km bus)

On this very rainy morning, we were surprised and thankful when our
hospedaje let us leave our luggage there while we ran errands in town
in preparation for the afternoon bus north of here. With no kitchen
access, we ate breakfast of empandas standing up in the entrance of
the supermarket.
We then made our way to the ferry office and were delighted to speak
with Carla in English who was a positive wealth of information. And
when she didn&apos;t know something, she even made phone calls on our
behalf to get bus information relevant for our travels to the ferry.
With this new information, we are all rethinking our plans again for
about the tenth time in the last two days. Now, I&apos;m thinking of going
through Futaleuf and skipping Chaiten but I still have a few days to
figure it out as I go north.
I managed to burn two more DVDs at an internet cafe that said they
couldn&apos;t burn DVDs. I sat down to use the computer and realized that
the computer I was sitting at had the software and the burner - and it
was blazingly fast. It took just 8 minutes or so per full DVD.
Fantastic.
We left town at 3pm for a three hour trip north which took 5 hours.
We arrived in a very dark town, and found a nice hospedaje to check
in. I think we&apos;ve all come to the same conclusion that a cold place
with hot water is preferable to a warm place with cold water. This
place ended up putting Wim and Angela in their own room with bathroom
and then I got my own room with bathroom. Fantastic. And it includes
breakfast and is relatively inexpensive at 6000 pesos. No extra
charge for the two rooms and private baths after showing us the triple
and seeing that we preferred separate rooms, if possible.
No charge for kitchen access even though she runs a restaurant. But
we were too tired to cook so we found a house down the street with
someone to cook us huge salmon fillets, with bread and mine with
fries, theirs with salad. 3500 pesos, less than $6.
TV and reading before bed. 
Thursday, April 23: Puerto Puyhuapi

It was still raining when we woke up today. After talking with the
owner who&apos;s nephew runs the buses in this neck of the world, I am
changing my plans yet again and hope to make it to Chaiten after all.
Wim and Angela went to the hot springs south of town, walking the 6km
to get there. I stayed in town, using the somewhat expensive internet
cafe as the free internet access at the tourist center was down for
the day in preparation for the afternoon inaugural there. Lunch back
a the hostel of my own bread and cheese. More internet. Dinner at
the hospedaje - more salmon fillets, with bread, rice and salad for
3000 pesos, $5. Watched the Mentalist on TV before bed. 
Friday, April 24: Puerto Puyhuapi

Still raining today but less than yesterday. While waiting for Wim
and Angela to get their stuff together, I went ahead to the Visitor&apos;s
Center (still closed) so made use of the free internet room in the
same building. It&apos;s a room full of computers that can be used for an
hour for free. Not sure if they are really keeping track of the time
spent as I was only there for 30 minutes or so, but what a wonderful
resource for the town.
Spent the day exploring the town and surrounding area with Wim and
Angela. The new bypass being built to take the Carretera Austral out
of town obliterated the Sendero de Colonos that we were trying to
follow. It&apos;s a trail leading to a historic section of town. Lunch
back at the hospedaje. Then more exploring and a trip up to the
mirador. We passed an older couple on their farm with a small
building smoking in the background. Sure enough, they were making
smoked salmon but didn&apos;t seem to have it for sale. Oh well. I should
have brought my hiking poles and ended up taking a flop at one point
on the way down. It hurt my right knee but there was no loss of
function so hopefully it won&apos;t be more than a temporary ache.
More salmon for dinner tonight. I hope this doesn&apos;t keep up for much
longer. I like salmon and would hate to get sick of it. With the
price of full meals so cheap, it just doesn&apos;t make sense to cook. 
Saturday, April 25: Puerto Puyhuapi to Villa Santa Lucia (113km hitch,
1001km total hitching)

Knowing the road south of town was closed between 10am and 2pm, we
knew our most likely hitching opportunities would be early so we ate
at 7:15 and were hitching by 8:15. I stood apart on the other side of
the road knowing two were more likely to get a ride than three and was
willing to hitch on my own or catch the bus later in the day if
necessary. But just 10 minutes later, a truck pulled up and he was
willing to take all three of us. That meant that Angela sat on Wim&apos;s
lap for the duration of the trip. We had planned on just getting to
La Junta today but Wim soon ascertained that our driver was going to
Villa Santa Lucia, where we were going to go tomorrow. We had no real
reason to go to La Junta so we kept on going with Abdias, our 20 year
old driver.
About five hours later, we got to Villa Santa Lucia. We thanked
Abdias who was continuing on to Futaleuf on his way to Argentina and
Bariloche. Had we not already figured out a way to spend a day in
Chaiten, I would have continued with him but Chaiten was more
important to me.
As we stopped at the store to ask directions to a hospedaje, we were
joined by our dog of the day, a medium sized playful black dog. We
were checked into the only hospedaje in town rather reluctantly. It
was only 4000 pesos. Then we went back to the market to get
vegetables to supplement our lunch. After we found the playground
with benches to sit on, our dog of the day found us again and dropped
a rock at my feet. He wanted to play fetch. I threw the rock for him
a few times but them settled down to eat lunch. As we ate, the dog
would continue to look expectantly at me. She was not begging food,
she just wanted to play. If I hid the rock under my foot, she would
go off and find another. If I ignored her, she would first tap the
rock with her paw. If I continued to ignore her, she would then tap
my foot with her paw. Then she would try the others, moving the rock,
tapping the rock, and finally tapping their feet. She was so cute.
After lunch Wim and Angela threw rocks for the dog, tossing one before
she had brought back the other and completely wore her out at least
for a while. Later, Angela took a nap and Wim and I went to explore
separate areas of town. The dog followed me so when convenient, I
would kick a rock along the road for it to chase. We were also joined
by another very large boxer cross who was happy to go along for the
walk and mostly kept to me side, ignoring the rocks I was kicking.
There is a military base in this town and we could see what looked
like barracks, but saw very little activity that would suggest
military and few personnel.
At dinner, Abdias showed up. He had gotten to Futaleuf and then had
a change of plans. He was staying at the same hospedaje as us and
going to Chaiten tomorrow. We were welcome along for the ride - and
he knew of a hospedaje that was open in this supposedly abandoned
town. Not only that, he was interested in going to the same hot
springs south of town that we were interested in. So, once again, we
change our plans to take advantage of opportunities that come up.
 [Date: Fri May 1, 2009 1:03 pm
Subject: 4/26-4/28: Villa Santa Lucia to Chancho (including recently volcano ravaged Chaiten)
This part of my journal is primarily about Chaitn, a town ravaged
twice in the last two years by a volcano that had been dormant for
over 9000 year ( Boston.com pictures and wikipedia info ). The volcano is just 6 miles from the town. The
volcano came to life in May, 2008, spewing ash which coated the town
and built an ash cone. When heavy rains then came days later, a
lahar, or mud flow, washed the ash down and rushed through town. It
kept to the river route at first, then dammed itself and chose a new
route through town, pushing houses into the Pacific, completely
inundating others, and surrounding others in cement-like ash/mud once
it stopped flowing.
The Chilean government at first vowed to rebuild and a project to help
the town was underway in January of this year, 2009. It was scheduled
to end in early February and probably did. Then later in February of
this year, the volcano erupted yet again and sent yet another lahar
through town. No lives have been lost as a result of these eruptions.
Now, the government believes the town too dangerous for habitation and
wants to abandon the town and rebuild it 12km away, in an area
considered safe. Turns out there are about 60 people living back in
town. There are few town services. The police are here to keep
looters away. The fire department is still here. There is a small
military presence but politics keep them mostly away. The hospital is
closed. There is no electricity. Those living in Chaitn have
generators for whatever electricity needs they have. Those that have
stayed feel like the government should rebuild.
This is the town I had been hoping to visit but information was scarce
and most of what we heard was discouraging. As we got closer and
closer to the town, it seemed more likely we would be able to visit.
I wanted to visit Chaitn for a number of reasons. First of all, it
was on my way north and was the best way to get from points south to
points north. Second, I&apos;ve long been fascinated by volcanoes and have
visited many but even though I visited Mt. St. Helens 25 years after
that volcano blew and I&apos;ve roasted marshmallows over lava on Volcan
Pacaya in Guatemala, I&apos;ve never seen how volcanoes affect people on a
human scale. I&apos;ve only before seen the changes on a grand, geological
scale. I&apos;m also curious about the few people left in town. I had
thought the entire place would be abandoned and yet there are people
around. To be sure, most of the town is certainly abandoned.
Thousands used to live there. Now it&apos;s just 60. What are their lives
like?
So here&apos;s my experiences for those days I was in Chaitn...
Mara] 
Sunday, April 26: Villa Santa Lucia to Chaitn (81km hitching, 1082
total hitching)

Great breakfast today. All the usual (bread, cheese, spreads) and
fresh moist apple cake to boot. For some reason, most cakes here seem
to be dry and/or stale so this one was delicious. We each ate
multiple pieces.
After Abdias got a jump start for his truck which fortunately uses a
car battery, we got on our way. It was only 81 kilometers to Chaitn
but tired of sitting on Wim&apos;s lap, Angela crawled into the back of the
truck with the grocery items, many stacked on a palette, and made
herself comfortable while looking out the open side door of the truck.
 Wim and I stuck to the relative comfort of the cab.
Abdias is great. We got to a relatively large suspension bridge and
he let Wim and me out not only to take pictures, but to walk ahead of
the truck across the bridge. Continuing on, we started seeing ash
lining the road at about the same time we got to the paved section of
road. Then it only got worse. As we got closer to Chaitn, more and
more ash piled up. Many of the trees were also dying. The hillsides,
covered with evergreens, were about half and half green and gray. I
couldn&apos;t tell if others were still dying off or if the dead trees were
just from the eruptions.
We all had very mixed emotions as we pulled into town. I think the
devastation and emptiness of the town hit us all a lot harder than any
of us expected it to but over time, we all had to find a way to be in
this town with the destruction all around us. I also realized that
those who chose to continue to live here also had to find a way to
live with it. The evidence of the destruction is everywhere but you
have to get on with your lives and continue.
We also realized that as people were trying to get on with their
lives, they might not appreciate tourists coming around to take
pictures. But then I realized that most of the time, there just
weren&apos;t people around to even see me taking pictures and those that
did didn&apos;t seem to mind. There was also a film crew in town so maybe
those left behind are used to cameras by now.
After an hour or so in the center, Wim and Angela stayed in the center
as I drove around town with Abdias. Our first destination was the
port but as we drove there, we were stopped along the shore front road
because part of the road had gotten washed out and was a deep pit,
maybe 5m deep. Had it been nighttime, he might have easily driven off
the end of the road. We circled around, not just the block, but a
hill to get to the port from the other side. Abdias wanted to see if
he could get his boat on the ferry the next day to Puerto Montt but
that ferry was full so he would keep his original reservation and go
to Quellon on Tuesday. We returned to town and then drove to the
other side of town to deliver goods to a store. Even though he told
me I didn&apos;t have to, I helped unload the truck. Why not help speed
things up?
We returned to town, parked the truck, found Wim and Angela, and went
for a walk through town. We walked on what was left of the promenade
near the old coast line and could see the mud from the lahar spread
out below us for quite a ways. There were houses out there, buried in
the mud, that had been pushed there from town. We walked up a hill to
a mirador. From there, we could see the extent of the destruction in
town. A large swath in the middle was inundated.
From town and the mirador, we could also look up and see the volcano
spewing more ash into the sky. Everywhere we went, it was still
there, changing from moment to moment but still throwing ash.
Later, we walked on the mud flow, where the river used to run. We
could see houses at rakish angles, others mostly buried, some with
cars also buried next to them. Even though the government wants to
abandon town, there were workers out all day Sunday and into the
night, building a levee to keep any further lahars in the channel. I
have no idea why they would do this when they are talking about
relocating the entire town, anyway.
Like after natural disasters in the US, people left messages on their
windows as they abandoned their houses. I love Chaitn. Chaitn
lives. And political messages for both the government and the US
landowner that owns most of the nearby land as Parque Pumalin and has
expressed interest in buying the property of Chaitn.
We also went to the cemetery where the paths had been cleared and many
of the graves had been cleared of mud but many still had half a meter
of mud capping them.
We had dinner at one hospedaje where we had steak, a nice change from
the three days of salmon we had just had. Abdias was staying at this
hospedaje but they didn&apos;t have any more room but they do cook meals
for more than they have room for. After dinner, we walked through the
very dark town using our headlamps to get back to our hospedaje, about
a kilometer away. It was strange to see a town so dark. At night, it
was possible to tell which houses were occupied. They had generators
and lights on. The rest were black.
When we got to our hospedaje, the owner and her friends asked if I had
felt the temblors. I hadn&apos;t but then a little while later, we all
felt one. I&apos;m sure I must have felt the earlier ones but they were so
small that I chalked them up to passing trucks (what passing trucks?),
etc. Now that I&apos;m in tune with them, I&apos;ll probably feel more.
Our hosts gave us sopapillas smothered in caramelized orange sauce
that reminded me of the candied sweet potatoes I had grown up with. 
Monday, April 27: Chaitn (50km hitch, 1132 total)

At 5:30 in the morning, I was jolted awake by a short but powerful
temblor that shook the bed and made the entire house creak. I could
tell it had woken others as the bathroom got a bit of use. Then, at
7:35, I was woken up again by another temblor, this time not as
powerful. I was still awake at 8:02 when a third one gently shook the
house. This last one would not have woken me up had I fallen back to
sleep beforehand. In New England, houses shake in the wind or rattle
when trucks go by so anything like these I would usually just dismiss.
Here though, it&apos;s the volcano.
As we walked to town this morning, Nicolas La Penna, an ex-pat living
in town, stopped his van to greet us in Spanish, English, Dutch, and a
little German, too. Turns out he has roots in Canada, the US, and here
in Chile. He&apos;s lived in all these countries and now lives in Chaitn.
 He runs Chaiturs and we had seen him running a French film crew doing
a documentary about Chaitn around town the previous day. He is a
friendly guy and seemed to want to talk but was busy and had to drop
someone off to catch a bus.
When we caught up with him at his home a few minutes later, he handed
each of us a piece of obsidian that he had picked up on the volcano.
I usually avoid carrying rocks around in my backpack, but this one
will be an interesting souvenir of the area. Nicolas doesn&apos;t
recommend anyone go to the volcano but he has gone himself a few times
and picked up the obsidian along the way. It was nice to finally talk
with someone in English with first hand experience living in Chaitn.
He was busy though so we couldn&apos;t talk long but we found out a bit
about the politics of the area and the strain between the government
and the people who want to keep living in Chaitn.
We had a couple of hours to kill before meeting up with Abdias so I
wandered the town a bit. I found some pumice that someone had put on
a bench and took a small piece. There&apos;s more on the beach but it&apos;s a
bit difficult to get down to the beach right now. The piece I took is
about the size of my pal, about twice the size of the obsidian and
half the weight. Now I&apos;m carrying two rocks.
We met Abdias at 1:00 and piled into the truck again. We then drove
to the Amarillo Termales (Yellow Hot Springs) about 25km south of
town. After a couple of hours, I was ready to go when Abdias had to
leave at 4:00 so I went with him but Wim and Angela stayed behind to
spend more time in the hot water. We thought he had to get back to
load his truck onto the ferry before another vehicle. In reality, he
had to load another vehicle, a van, into his truck before driving
onto the ferry tomorrow. I watched as they went through pains to get
a van loaded into the back of the truck. By doing this, they only had
to pay for one vehicle to take the ferry and would split the cost.
Apparently this is done quite frequently.
After the van was loaded, I stayed at the waterfront to watch the
sunset and was joined by the film crew driven by Nicolas. The two
French videographers were more than a bit overbearing. Quiet please!
was a command, not a polite way to ask someone who had been watching
the sunset before they got there to refrain from talking. They also
complained with sharp words to Nicolas about how if he had driven a
bit faster, they would have gotten the sun going down and not just the
clouds. It was them that decided at the last minute to try to catch
the sunset. If they had decided earlier, they would have see the sun
going down behind the clouds. Oh well. At least the Swiss guy with
them was nice.
I walked up to the hospedaje to check in again but nobody was home so
I let myself in with the hidden key and by headlamp, dumped the stuff
I wouldn&apos;t need until later. With nobody home and no lights, I walked
to the other hospedaje where I would be having dinner once again and
asked if I could just sit and read until dinner was ready. So I
settled in for the couple of hours before dinner was expected.
A short while later, I was treated to my favorite Chilean food to
date: milcao. It&apos;s like a potato pancake stuffed with roughly chopped
meat. It was greasy and delicious. I&apos;ll be keeping my eye out for
more of them. Dinner tonight was chicken and rice, a dish I had
gotten sick of in Central America but was able to enjoy here. We had
one sizable temblor while I was waiting for dinner.
When one of the other men staying at the hospedaje realized I was
about to walk back across town in the dark all alone, he assisted on
accompanying me. I thought it rather silly as he would then have to
return alone but then as we left, I realized he meant to give me a
ride. Oh, that was better. He had started to ask the hospedaje
owners for directions but then realized I could point the way. It was
nice to get the ride as I was very tired. Wim and Angela were there.
They had wanted to spend the night in a hospedaje near the hot springs
but it was full. So ten minutes later, they got a hitch back to town.
 No problem there. 
Tuesday, April 28: Chaitn to Chonchi (79km hitch, 1211 total)

Woke up at 3:40 to another temblor that lasted a few seconds this
time. Then another long shake at 5:22. When I finally got up, I
couldn&apos;t get the pilot lit on the shower so skipped the shower for the
day. Argh! I hadn&apos;t planned well and only had two small cereal bars
for breakfast. Then it was a quick walk down the hill to the ferry.
The ferry was scheduled to leave at 10:00 which was about the time it
pulled up to the dock. It was quite the operation to get it docked
just right. It couldn&apos;t approach the ramp directly. It had to drop
anchor and then use a small helper boat to fetch the lines and bring
them to shore. Then, once the lines were on shore, it could shorten
the lines and bring the boat to the ramp.
While there, Nicolas and the Swiss guy came up so I introduced the
Swiss guy to Angela, also Swiss and they were off and running in Swiss
German. They were there waiting for a scientist to come off the boat
to accompany the documentary crew to the mountain. They would be in
radio contact with the appropriate authorities in case the mountain
decided to get active again. At least they might have a bit of extra
time to get off the mountain.
Finally, after the other passengers got off, we could get on and the
vehicles, including Abdias&apos; truck could be loaded. They take your ID
as you get on but were happy with my driver&apos;s license. Then as you
go, you go to the office and pay your passage. If you take your time,
they call you over the loud speaker. Once you pay, you get your ID
back. We left Chaitn at 11:00am, only one hour late.
Under way, at first it was foggy looking back but the fog was just
along the shore and we were soon out from under the cloud. Then we
could see the town under the cloud and the ash plume from the volcano
above the cloud. Even with the temblors, I had never felt nervous
being in Chaitn with the volcano rumbling above us, but leaving on
the ferry, there was a little sense of relief. Perhaps it wasn&apos;t from
the danger of the volcano, but maybe just the return to normalcy after
spending a couple of days in a deserted town where the topic of
conversation is almost always the volcano and related issues.
Four hours later, we arrived in Chilo, a large island off the coast
of southern Chile with it&apos;s own culture. Even though we were at the
pier, it was still another 1.5 hours until they could land the boat
properly and offload people and vehicles. Then Abdias dropped Wim and
Angela in town. They wanted to go to the end of the Pan American
highway, just a few kilometers away. It was raining and while it
would have been nice to go to the end of another very long road, I
wanted to continue north. So I said my goodbyes to them. I am glad
to be traveling on my own again.
I continued with Abdias another 79km to Chincho. Abdias dropped me
off on the Pan American highway and I hitched to town. It was dark
when I was hitching but the first car to turn the corner picked me up.
I got in and it was only after a few minutes that I realized it was a
taxi. Hmm... All the other times when I was hitching, the taxis just
passed us by without stopping. I clearly had my thumb out so wasn&apos;t
looking to flag down a cab. Was I expected to pay? There was someone
else in the car, too. So when I got to town and got out, there was no
mention of money so I guess I hitched a taxi. Strange. Maybe the
other passenger told him to pick me up. I have no idea. They let me
off in the middle of town.
I walked down (literally, down a very steep hill) to the shore road
and found Skorpio, a hospedaje for 5000. It&apos;s the nicest place I&apos;ve
been to since the fancy hotel in Gobenador Gregores. I have my own
room with key. It&apos;s a shared bath down the hall but with the best
shower in a real tub I&apos;ve had since maybe the fancy hotel in Ushuaia.
Got a yogurt for dinner at the nearby supermarket that had, among
other items, Edy&apos;s Ice Cream. Not what I expected to see here. Then
I found another small market with internet access. There&apos;s nothing to
do in a town this small at night so I spent a couple of hours
transcribing my journal.
 [Date: Sun May 3, 2009 8:37 am
Subject: 4/29-5/2: Chonchi to Castro
Well, I intend to leave Castro later today but it&apos;s warm in the hostel
and raining cats and dogs outside so we&apos;ll just have to see what
happens in the next few hours...
Until then, this journal entry brings me up to date for the first time
since maybe Puerto Natales.

Wednesday, April 29: Chonchi

Breakfast in my room looking out over the harbor. Grabbed stuff for
the day and made my way to the bus stop. Took the bus towards Queilen
but got off for the ferry to Lemuy. It&apos;s free for pedestrians.
I walked to the nearest town on the Isla Lemuy, about 4km from the
ferry landing and saw lots of bird life and beautiful flowers along
the way. Here, it still seems to be summer. Everything is still
green. Being out of the mountains and near the water, it&apos;s much more
temperate. Plus, it just happens to be a sunny and warm day. This is
the first day in weeks (months?) that I&apos;ve been able to walk around in
a t-shirt. I had to stop in a bus stop to remove the tights I had
been wearing under the lightweight pants I&apos;ve been surviving with
since Central America.
The island is pastoral with checkerboarded fields on sloping
hillsides. The special churches of the Chilo area continue on this
island. They are built of wood and have their own design elements,
different from other parts of Chile.
From the ferry and from the island, I could see a lot of the salmon
farming that goes on in this area. It&apos;s a huge industry and there&apos;s a
huge processing plant near the ferry landing. I have to wonder if
some of the salmon we eat in the US comes from here.
The only traffic of note on the island was the periodic spate of cars
heading to the next ferry, or coming from a recently arrived ferry.
Other than that, there were very few cars out and about. After lunch
along the beach at the small town just 3km from the ferry landing, I
walked back to the ferry and returned to the island of Chilo. There,
as I waited for the bus, I noticed I could see the Chaiten ash plume
from 60km away. While still waiting, one of the truck drivers that
had brought his truck across on the ferry drove up the ramp, saw me
waiting for the bus, and indicated that I could have a ride. So,
without even trying to hitch (admittedly, I was thinking about it), I
got a ride for the few kilometers back to town. Wow. Two weird
hitches in one small town.
Back in town, I ran into a couple who looked very familiar. I had met
them in Flores, Guatemala back in December. They&apos;ve been traveling
south the whole time while I skipped south and have since been
traveling north. They&apos;re the first travelers I&apos;ve run into from the
Central American portion of my trip. Wow!
Wandering around the waterfront, I saw a sign advertising a cultural
festival with music and dance. It was this evening and it was free.
I couldn&apos;t tell if it was participatory or a performance, but either
way, I was going. I spent more time on line in the afternoon.
I ran into Wim and Angela about to head to Esmeraldas, a hospedaje
further down the road. It&apos;s listed in the guide book and has kitchen
facilities. I told them about the evening&apos;s festivities.
I then went to the supermarket cafe for dinner. I had been hearing
about completos throughout my travels in Chile and seen them on many
menus, but it was never appropriate to order one until now. It&apos;s a
hot dog with tomatoes, guacamole, and mayonnaise. It was pretty good.
I even added ketchup to the mix. I had it with fries and a meat
empanada. The fries were great. The empanda, not so good. Even the
apple empanada from the bakery next door wasn&apos;t all that good. Oh
well. The apple empanadas will make me look at the fried pies I eat
along the AT in a whole new light. From now on, they&apos;ll look like
empanadas to me.
I ran into another couple staying at my hotel and told them about the
festival. They&apos;re going to show up as well. When I got to the
festival, I realized it was a night of dance performances. I got
there in time to get a seat and save two more for the other couple
from the hotel. They were the last seats that were more than one seat
in a row. They came in just as a school group came in and thankfully
grabbed the seats just before they would have been snagged by the
kids. They were from Buenos Aires and he spoke great English and
translated a few of the relevant parts of the intros for me.
The performances started with kids performing the traditional dances
in gaucho dress. These &quot;Chilean&quot; dances were the same as I had seen
in Buenos Aires. Then a group of teens came on and performed a bunch
of hip hop routines. Some of the routines were quite good. Many were
from those still learning. A favorite routine was a synchronized
routine from one of the older dancers and the smallest one performing
together. An adult version of the tradition dance came next. There
was a belly dancer and then a large group of musicians, singers, and
dancers came on. The finale was a couple performing the tango and the
were phenomenal. They performed a tango that was a joy to watch but
no so flamboyant as to seen inaccessible. They also performed a
milonga, I think, that was also beautiful. It turns out that they are
the Chilean tango champions who happen to come from Chilo. They
represent Chile at the World Championships.
For the first time either on this trip or maybe since Central America
or Buenos Aires, I had people twice ask me for money. The first time
was from an understimulated teenager with nothing better to do. He
probably asked on a dare from his friends who were hanging out. the
second time was from a man who looked like he may have been a down and
out fisherman. The circumstances were a bit weird so I was wary and
pretended not to understand, saying that I don&apos;t speak Spanish.
The culture here really is different than on the mainland so it
remains to be seen in this is part of the Chilote culture, or just the
fact that I&apos;m moving north towards a more temperate climate where I&apos;m
more likely to encounter poorer people. 
Thursday, April 30: Chonchi to Castro (bus)

A morning internet session had me coming closer to catching up on my
journal. Then with frequent and cheap buses, I didn&apos;t even try to
hitch. I just hopped on the bus for the relatively short drive to
Castro. I knew it was a bigger town, but I was surprised at how many
people were out and about, walking on the sidewalks, and for once,
populating the main plaza. Even though it feels weird to be in such a
&quot;metropolis&quot; after being in small towns for so long, at least this one
felt good with all the people milling around. I was glad I paid
attention to a friendly low pressure tout offering lodging. When I
excused myself to look around, I found the visitor&apos;s center on the
plaza to be closed for the afternoon break, then as I tried other
hospedajes, they were either too expensive, or surprisingly, nobody
answered the bell at many of them. So, I ended up at the Torre del
Babel Hospedaje. It&apos;s a really nice place, quite affordable, with
kitchen access, breakfast included, and I have my own locking room
with TV. All for 6000. I found out later that it&apos;s probably the off
season price as others who had booked online paid more.
I wandered the town for a while with two American college students,
Julia and Jillian, studying in Buenos Aires for a year. We visited
the artisans fair, found a place for dinner that evening, and went to
look at the colorful palafitas, or stilt houses that dot the
shoreline. They remind me of houses I&apos;ve seen in the US and Cambodia.
When the visitor&apos;s center reopened, I went in to take a look at the
models of the Chilo churches they have on display there. This models
are complete on one side and open on the other so the construction can
be seen.
Took a break before dinner then walked to the restaurant with the
college students. There, I had a avocado and tomato salad and shared
a dish called curanto with Jillian. our version had lots of mussels,
some clams, sausage, chicken, a small pork rib, and potato bread. It
comes with a dipping sauce. Other versions also include fish, beef,
lamb, potatoes, and more.
To be honest, it wasn&apos;t nearly as special as I had hoped but it was OK
and I&apos;m glad I tried it. Maybe if I could find a place where it was
prepared the truly traditional way, in a hole in the ground with lots
of vegetable matter about, it might have been more interesting.

Friday, May 1: Castro

It&apos;s Labor Day here and lots of businesses are closed, including the
supermarket. But some restaurants are open and some of the smaller
markets are open. The weather started out gray and rainy and stayed
that way all day. I took a zero day and did nothing. I got out of
the hostel once before dinner to by some yogurt and other stuff.
Other than that, I spent the day on the computer, transcribing my
journal and doing an initial sort through my Honduras journal and
uploading some pictures to Picasa. When others were using the
computer in the afternoon, I watched most of Notting Hill on the TV in
my room. 
Saturday, May 2: Castro

I came to Castro for an afternoon or maybe one overnight but when you
find a nice place to be, why rush it. So, I&apos;m staying for a third
night.
Today, Angela (this one from Australia) and I went to some nearby
towns to look at houses, their wooden shingled siding, and churches.
The construction techniques used here on Chilo are unique and not
seen in other parts of Chile. We started in Dalcahue and soon
realized that although I had seen examples in Chincho and Castro, the
decorative elements we saw in the towns we visited today were more
interesting and creative.
We started in Dalcahue. We visited the plaza and went into the
church. While we were inside, a funeral procession arrived. We
waited while they moved to the front of the church and then discreetly
left. There was a guitar and violin (I think) playing music and the
song they were singing seemed familiar, as if I knew the words in
English, but I couldn&apos;t place it.
We then walked onto the ferry going to Isla Quinchao. We got lucky
when the bus we needed boarded the same ferry. When it was time to
disembark, we just climbed aboard the bus for the 20km trip to Achao.
We went through Caraco and decided we would stop there on our way
back. The houses there were prettier and had a bit more interesting
architecture than many of the others. In Achao, we visited the oldest church in Chilo .
There, we found a restaurant on the beach for lunch. I had fish of
some sort with fries. We watched beached boats slowly righting
themselves as the tide came in.
We spent a few minutes in Curaco on the way back but it started to
rain so we beat a hasty retreat to the bus stop and took the next bus
back to Castro. I stopped at the supermarket on the way back to the
hostel.
The French couple I had met - again - in Chonchi showed up here at the
hostel today.
The hostel is full tonight so I had very limited computer time. I
ended up watching a very old, really bad Steve McQueen movie. The
alternatives on the TV seemed even worse. I still have a bit of my
book to read but without prospects for a trade, I&apos;m holding out on
finishing it during any time when I have anything else to keep me
busy. 
Sunday, May 3: Castro to Puerto Varas

Another rainy morning. I took my time leaving the hostel this morning
and just missed one bus so had to wait 1.5 hours for the next one.
So, I left my backpack at the bakery across the street and took a walk
down the hill to see the palafitos, or stilt houses, there. These
houses are considered special here but they remind me of many of the
stilt houses I&apos;ve seen in the US (Louisiana and other coastal areas),
Cambodia, and perhaps other locations, too. These however, probably
take the prize for the most colorful.
Back at the bakery, I bought a milcao for lunch and two alfajores.
Live and learn, I should have checked... I ordered with chocolate and
got with coconut, not at all my favorite food. If I had checked in
the bakery, I would have been able to change for the right ones. Oh
well.
At least I had plenty of other munchies to keep me going for the
duration of the bus ride.
The bus ride was uneventful though surprisingly full. It was also a
local and stopped at every possible bus stop if anyone was waiting to
get on or off. At least until the bus completely filled up and there
was no more room to even stand in the aisles.
On the ferry, I wasn&apos;t going to bother getting off the bus until I
realized I could see sea lions from the bus. So I bundled up against
the cold wind and rain and went to watch a bit. A few brown mottled
pelicans flew by as well.
In Puerto Montt, I was glad to be taking others&apos; advice and just pass
through the city. I couldn&apos;t believe there were glittery high rises
lining the beach. Yuck! After a quick visit to the supermarket, I
grabbed a bus to Puerto Varas. Once there, I found the hostel that a
couple of others had recommended to me. It was a nice place with good
beds, neat, and clean. It had a kitchen and free internet access
though the computer was too old for the USB ports to be functional.
Nasty weather kept me inside where it was warm and dry for the evening. 
Monday, May 4: Puerto Varas

Another slow day. After struggling with beg bugs all night - even in
this nice hostel, I have yet another reason to do laundry today. I
had planned to anyway though. Since I needed to wash almost
everything, I&apos;m stuck once again wearing the bar minimum for the
weather so mostly sticking indoors today to stay warm.
If this had been a crappy hostel, I would have moved out immediately.
Instead, when I mentioned the problem, they took it seriously
immediately. They first offered to have me move to a bed in a
different room. Then when they found a bed bug in my bed, they had the
other guy in my room move as well. They then cleaned and fumigated
the room. I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll be using it for a day or two.
That other guy is a Japanese guy named Kanai (Can I) and he is fishing
his way around the area. So, when he went out this morning and came
back with a good sized trout, he offered to share. So then I ran out
to the supermarket and got salad stuffs and potatoes to go with.
Together we made a really nice meal, with him frying up the fish in
two different flavors.
Later, I visited the tourist office and got a great idea for how to
cross the border into Argentina but they couldn&apos;t tell me if it was
too late in the season to do that route. It would have involved a few
days of walking on a track that seemed high enough to be cold and
potentially snowy or icy. I had to find someone else who knew that
area better. When I did, they too weren&apos;t sure if that route would be
passable. But they had another suggestion. I gave up on the route I
found which would have been great in the summer, and latched onto
their alternative. It&apos;ll still be a bit of an adventure, well off the
usual tourist route, but with limited hiking and reasonable
transportation options for most of the route.
So, after spending a day in Ensenada tomorrow, hopefully doing a small
hike on Volcan Osorno, I plan to get back to Argentina by using buses,
ferries, independently hired boats, hitching, and walking. It should
only take a day or two to get to El Boson, a hippy enclave and from
there, it&apos;s an easy bus ride to Bariloche, a ski area settled by
Germans and known for its beer and chocolate.
From there, I have a number of options for moving north again and will
probably only spend a short amount of time in Argentina before
crossing back into Chile. Should be an interesting crossing. The two
American college students I had met a few days ago in Castro had to
submit to having their temperature taken on their way into Chile as an
attempt to prevent the H1N1 virus from spreading into the country. I
haven&apos;t been in the US since November and I&apos;ve been out of Central
America (not having visited Mexico at all on this trip) since
February. Will they bother to take my temperature anyway? We&apos;ll see.
Earlier when I bought stuff for dinner, I thought I would be here a
couple of days. Now that I&apos;m planning on leaving tomorrow morning, I
have extra food in the house. When Kanai came back without a fish for
dinner, I shared my mushrooms and burgers with him.
Spent some time talking about the Patagonia Sin Represas! (Patagonia
Without Dams) campaign. I had first
become aware of this project when in Chile Chico. My host family had
shown me a coffee table book of before and after images of the natural
Patagonian environment should the proposed dam building projects go
through. This was the first time I had the opportunity to talk with
someone outside of Patagonia who could tell me about some of the
politics in English. The project has not started to be built so
hopefully the growing movement throughout the country, and not just in
Patagonia, will prevent these pristine natural environments from being
destroyed. 
Tuesday, May 5: Puerto Varas to Ensenada

Feliz Cinco de Mayo. Found an interesting web site that gives a U.S
spin on the Mexican holiday. Got some good news
today. An acquaintance from the Appalachian Trail long-distance
hiking community who had gone missing a week earlier has been found
alive and well near the A.T ( Article ).
I was heading for the bus when I saw a church on the hill. It was
alpine style with white sides delineated by dark exposed beams and
quite pretty. It was over a grotto of a sort with a statue of Mary -
very picturesque.
Then, I found an internet cafe and with the limited ability of the
computer at the hostel, I decided to step in for a few minutes - which
turned into a couple of hours given the way I can get absorbed. So,
it was lunch time when I finally climbed into the bus for Ensenada.
The bus ride gave me peeks of Volcan Osorno, getting closer and closer
as we traveled. In Ensenada, I found the lodging expensive so paid
2,000 to camp instead of 10,000 to stay in a hospedaje. The campsites
back up right to the beach on the lake.
Then I hitched the 5km to a trailhead for the Sendero de Solidario.
Turns out the family in a vegetable truck, drove out of their way to
bring me to the trailhead. Once again, the people are amazing. Then
it was a 6km walk with views of the volcano looming above at times
through the vegetation. Then a bit more than halfway through, I came
to a huge rock field with spectacular views. I took my second break
there and then continued, following orange arrows painted on rocks.
2/3 the way through, the trail gave out. I thought I might have to
turn back but managed to find clues here and there that indicated
where the trail continued. A cairn here, a log stuck upright in rocks
there, some orange flecks of paint on a rock, etc. I eventually made
it to the other side of the rock field and found the path back into
the woods there. Phew! This trail is mostly downhill so I&apos;m glad I
didn&apos;t have to backtrack. Plus, the road where I started is only in
the park and doesn&apos;t carry much traffic. While only 5km back to town,
I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t have to walk it.
I got extremely lucky with the weather with quite a few clear or
almost clear views of the volcano today, some in almost clear blue
skies.
As I emerged back on the main road to town, the bus was just driving
by so I flagged it down. I almost wish I had missed it because I&apos;m
sure I could have hitched without a problem. In town, I checked out
the restaurant, decided not to eat there as it was pricey, so picked
up a few supplies at the market. Then walked back to my campsite
along the beach but almost had to turn back as I encountered a stream
that was too big for me to jump. The sun was setting as I was walking
and it was a pretty sunset. Back at the campsite, each site has a
light so I ate on a table under a light, then organized. There was a
family of cats and kittens hanging around, curious about my presence
but too skittish to get too close. The weather was great so I decided
to sleep out. I couldn&apos;t figure out how to get the light by the table
under the gazebo to stay off so I picked another table to sleep on.
The lake that I traveled along from Puerto Varas to Ensenada is called
Lago Llanquihue and pronounced Yankee Way. There&apos;s even a nearby
cabaas site that uses the English spelling for it&apos;s name.
Peeking up behind the flanks of Volcan Osorno (2652m) is another
volcano called Volcan Puntiagudo (2493m). 
Wednesday, May 6: Ensenada to Lago Inferior

When I woke up in the middle of the night last night, the dew had
started to form on my bag and the light was off at the covered picnic
table so I displaced the kittens that had made themselves comfortable
on my gear that I had left there and moved my bag to that picnic
table. As I had hoped, by the time I got up in the morning, my bag
had mostly dried. Having gone to sleep very early, I was up for
sunrise and was treated to brilliant pinks and peach colors reflecting
on the snowfields of the volcano. I then finished packing and started
hitching along the road. I hitched unsuccessfully for an hour and
then moved to the police station to wait for my bus, not realizing it
would be another hour.
I boarded the bus and had a similar experience there that I&apos;ve had
many times when I try to speak Spanish. My pronunciation may not be
all that great, but when I say Lago Tagua Tagua, and the bus helper
repeats back to me Cochomo, I know they just plain aren&apos;t listening.
I would say &quot;No, Lago Tagua Tagua&quot; and again, he would say &quot;Cochamo..&quot; 
I know they don&apos;t sound anything alike so once again, I said &quot;no, Lago 
Tagua Tagua&quot; and finally he heard me
correctly. Argh! I think it&apos;s just that most tourists don&apos;t go to
the end of that particular bus line. I was going well off the tourist
trail today.
There was one other tourist on the bus who I pegged, correctly, as a
Brit purely because he was wearing Montane brand clothing. We finally
introduced ourselves only at the ferry landing. Jack was going most
of the way I am, stopping just shy of the border to do some volunteer
work for a month. When he went off to grab lunch before the ferry
sailed, I met a French woman, Francoise, who has been living on a
tiny island in the middle of Lago Rocas for 20 years. By the time we
got off the ferry, she wanted to offer me a ride but couldn&apos;t as her
truck was full with both supplies and the electrician that was
accompanying her from Puerto Montt to do some work on the island. I
can&apos;t imagine having to travel so far to do the job he&apos;s going to do.
She also ascertained that the bus that usually runs on the far side of
the lake wouldn&apos;t be running apparently for the second day in a row,
but there was a guy with a pickup on the far side who piled seven of
us in and on his vehicle. It wasn&apos;t a true hitch as he expected the
same payment as the bus would have gotten.
At the invitation of Fran, I had him drop me at her farm where her
oxen were waiting. Yes, her oxen. She got there just a few minutes
later and we were soon unloading the pickup and loading the oxcart.
The well matched pair of oxen would be carting her load to the boat
landing, beyond the end of the road where her truck would be forced to
stop. So, with an invitation to visit her house on the way across the
lake, I left my backpack with the oxcart, and together we started the
walk to the lake. It was maybe 3km past the end of the road to get to
the lake. Along the way, we picked up garbage and picked berries to
eat. At the lake, we waited for the oxcart. Once it arrived, we
loaded the boat with her load, then crawled on, and finally pushed off
for the 20 minute boat ride to her island. It was nearly dark when we
got there but light enough to see that it was beautiful. Her house
was rustic but gorgeous. She&apos;s a weaver and painter and has a studio
there. And the house blends in well with the surroundings.
When they finished unloading the boat, Jack and I hopped back in for
the rest of the trip across the lake. With the moon nearing full, we
could see quite well. Otherwise, we wouldn&apos;t have had any idea what
this end of the lake looked like. I seem to have lucked out and
either Fran paid, Jack&apos;s volunteer stint paid, but somehow nobody
wanted my money. I had hoped to get this far in daylight but expected
to get here alone. Had I been alone, I would have just found a place
to camp and reviewed my surroundings in the morning. But because Jack
was here and being met by people from the organic farm he&apos;ll be
working on, I ended up joining them. They loaded our backpacks on the
4x4 ATV driven by Jeff and then Chardo led Jack and me on a 15 minute
night hike to Ulaa, the failed resort turned organic farm and soon to
be outdoor enthusiast camp.
I had no idea what they were going to charge me, but they were so
relaxed about my being there that I just relaxed and went with the
flow. We got there and it was dark, with candles lighting the kitchen
and living room. They turn the generator one just before dinner and
so we had lights for a few hours in the evening until the generator
ran out gas. We had an amazing dinner of roasted lamb (slaughtered
just days earlier) and roasted vegetables (potatoes, two types of
squash, onions, garlic, and greens) along with salad. Delicious.
Chardo took my passport to get its exit stamp and would be returning
with it the next day. I&apos;m a bit nervous about that, but with the
transparent nature of life here (everyone knows everyone else, and
everyone else&apos;s business because it&apos;s all goes out over two way radio
that everyone listens to), so I felt reasonably OK with letting my
passport go with someone else for the night. It was only after my
passport went that the invitation to extend my stay came and I&apos;ll
consider it as long as my passport situation won&apos;t be a hindrance.
Geff, the guy who is mostly responsible for getting me set up and I
established an instant connection. Turns out he not only spent 15
years living in the US. but he went Harvard, lived in Boston, the
Cape, and Portland, ME in that time. He&apos;s Brazilian and only returned
to South America last fall. We had a lot of fun comparing notes. I
admit to quite a bit of homesickness and though the US is no longer
his home, he also obviously missed a great deal about living in New
England.
They put me in a comfortable room with luxurious bedding though I saw
evidence of mice and heard a bit of scrambling as I got ready for bed.
 Nothing after that though. 
Thursday, May 7: Lago Inferior, Chile to El Bolsn, Argentina

I woke up to find that last night&apos;s hike had taken us from the shore
of Lago Rocas to the shore of Lago Inferior. The view from the
windows of this cabin are fantastic!
It rained last night and this morning had light showers on and off. I
decided to stay another few days and take up the offer that had been
extended to me assuming my stay wouldn&apos;t tax their resources and they
had real work for me to do. So after a very light breakfast (too
light in my book), I started helping Jimmy who was chopping wood. We
first reorganized one of the wood sheds and I was happy to offer a
technique that would get more wood stacked in the shed without it
leaning against the gas tank that needed to remain accessible. Then I
started carting wheelbarrow full loads and stacked the wood higher and
higher. As I was working, Chardo returned with my passport already
stamped and it took a while to get the communication going, but in the
long run, my boat had already been called so there was no way I could
stay any longer. I quickly packed my bag and and was seen off at the
dock by everyone at the farm.
Kent Shoenauer was a seemingly humorless American ex-pat, now living
in South America for 40 years. He handed me a life jacket which I
declined to wear through the first lake, Lago Inferior. It was a
beautiful crossing with a bit of a chop and wind-blown spray. As we
neared the end of the lake, I knew what was coming and donned my life
jacket. At the end of the lake, Kent pointed the boat up the Rio
Puelo and we pushed our way through a series of rapids. My amateur
estimate of the ratings for these rapids based on paddling and rafting
trips on other rivers with known classifications up to class V
included, a couple of class I and II rapids to start and then two or
three class III rapids, with one possibly III+. Kent&apos;s boat was
extremely stable and he was certainly knowledgeable about the vagaries
of the river and which lines to take through the rapids.
Once through the rapids, there was another 20-25 minutes of lake
crossing to get to the immigration office on the far side of Lago
Puelo. Along the way, rain to the west and sun to the east made for a
pretty rainbow. With the time change, we made it by 11:45 or so, just
in time to get to immigration before it closed for the day or at
least for hours. It would have been possible to have it reopen for us
but only for a hefty fee.
It took a long time to get through immigration but mostly because of
the officer&apos;s hunt and peck use of a very slow computer. But, I was
in no rush.
I then made the acquaintance of Lechuga (lettuce), a 5cm long pet
turtle that one of the woman who works at the National Park brings to
work with her. We watched as it ate grass and wandered around - very
slowly. I called it Lechuga la Tortuga much to the lady&apos;s amusement.
Then when it was time to leave, I found my pack which I had left on a
bench under a pine tree covered with tiny green flying insects. I had
to brush them off before I could heft it.
Then I wandered the one kilometer to the nearby town and caught the
bus to El Bolsn. When I realized the bus would be picking up many
passengers, I consolidated my stuff to take up as little room as
possible. When three Israeli girls got on, they each grabbed two
seats, one for each of them and one for each of their backpacks. The
bus was past standing room only when they decided it might be a good
idea to try to consolidate. Argh!
In El Bolsn, I found lodging to be expensive and the places the guide
book recommended either closed or much more expensive than listed. I
finally found a refugio a fair walk from the town center and settled
in. Then I walked back to town to see the rest of the artisan fair
that happens four times per week. This town is known as a hippy
enclave and the people here would fit in with the NEFFA crowd at home
quite easily. I grabbed a burger and fries, then wandered town, went
shopping for dinner, and returned to the hostel.
Spent time on the computer there. Eventually made dinner, using the
pasta packet I had been carrying for a couple of weeks in case I ended
up somewhere without options. I seem to be squarely back on the
tourist track right now so probably won&apos;t need to carry such groceries
until I go to Easter Island. I organized some photos online. There
are at least three of us here tonight with my exactly journal - except
theirs are the original Moleskine brand which I&apos;ve never seen in a
store at home (not that I ever looked). Mine is by Markings and I had
bought my first one at Staples. My sister bought the one I&apos;m using
now on my behalf so I&apos;m not sure where she found it. 
Friday, May 8: El Bolsn

What a night... After a woman came in well after midnight and woke us
up, she then got up at 5am to shower and didn&apos;t leave until 5:45.
Then there was banging at the door and the doorbell buzzed over and
over again so I finally got up and let in three people looking for
lodging. I just turned my back and went back to sleep. It was 6:30.
They found a room with beds and went to sleep themselves. When I got
up this morning, I was assured that all the disturbances were unusual
and so I agreed to spend another night.
Just noticed something interesting this morning... A Kellogg&apos;s box
with braille on the side. It spells out Kelloggs Honey NutOs 240g.
I&apos;ll have to try to figure out if other Kellogg&apos;s boxes have braille,
too. Has anyone else seen braille on boxes where they live? It&apos;s
across the nutricional information side of the box here.
It&apos;s a rainy day today so after running out to the store (forgot to
look at the cereal boxes) for food to last until tomorrow, I&apos;m happy
to stay inside where it&apos;s warm and dry. The forecast for this area
tomorrow calls for snow tomorrow night and on Sunday, 10-20cm of snow.
 But, I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s in the hills and not here in town.
By then, I&apos;ll probably be in Bariloche, just a couple of hours north
of here. There&apos;s a bit of snow in the forecast there, too, but once
again, that&apos;ll be the forecast for the hills and the people of
Bariloche would love snow. It&apos;s a ski town and they&apos;re just waiting
for the winter ski season to start.
Met a guy here, Benoit, who has walked here from Ushuaia, taking about
four months to get here, frequently in the mountains where there are
no trails. He&apos;s young and not interested in hearing about lighter
options because he can carry his load - even when it tops out at 40
kilos. Ugh! There&apos;s plenty of these types on the AT, too. He&apos;s
tired and is going to stop in Bariloche.
He also spent time in Chaiten and managed to be there during clear
weather. His pictures of the ash plume against blue skies are
fantastic. 
Saturday, May 9: El Bolsn to Bariloche

Last night was uneventful, the way it should have been. I slept well, too.
After breakfast, I finally figured out that the striking but fairly
ubiquitous birds I&apos;ve been seeing since Puerto Natales are Southern
Lapwings. Other birds I&apos;ve been seeing occasionally are Buff-throated
Ibis. The Chimanga Caracaras I first noticed in Ushuaia are still
common and as gregarious as ever.
I walked to the bus station with Benoit. We got there only to find
out that the bus going now was a semi-cama (bed) bus that would cost a
bit more but it wasn&apos;t worth waiting the two hours for the next,
cheaper, bus. So, I got to see how I would fit - or not as the case
turned out - in one of these buses. There is definitely more knee
room on these buses bus less foot room as the hole to the space under
the seat in front is blocked off for the foot rest. I still managed
to get fairly comfortable and think I even nodded off once or twice.
Many of the long distance bus rides show movies. The last one showed
a violent adult movie even though there were little kids on board.
This one was halfway through A Brilliant Mind when I boarded. It was
in English with Spanish subtitles but the volume was so low, the
English was almost useless, anyway. Even still, it was nice to see
something other than mindless entertainment on one of these buses.
Someone had recommended a hostel to me and Benoit already had a
reservation so I just tagged along with him. Glad I did. The local
bus system was not at all obvious. All the buses go to Centro which
in other places is one small area. Here, it seemed like the entire
downtown area is considered Centro and only a couple buses went where
we were going.
At the 1004 hostel, I managed to get the last bed of this large
hostel. This place is unusual. It&apos;s on the 10th floor of a 10 story
building and the views from the dorm rooms and the common areas are
amazing. Bariloche is on a large lake and we overlook the lake.
Fantastic!
I relaxed a bit and then took a walk to try to get my bearings a bit
but it was very cold so after stopping at the supermarket, I returned
to the hostel for the evening. I made cheeseburgers, potatoes and
onion, and broccoli. I think this is the first time I&apos;ve had broccoli
since Central America and there, it was always overcooked. The
potatoes and broccoli allowed me to use up the rest of my butter and
the burgers will go a good way to using up my ketchup. My backpack
will be getting a lot lighter.
Met Mick at the hostel, a 50-something Aussie traveling for the first
time in his life. Interesting guy... He&apos;s going to try to get to
Burning Man this year. 
Sunday, May 10: Bariloche

Woke to rain. It rained all day. Breakfast is included here at the
hostel as is fairly normal in these parts and it includes the usual
bread and marmalade, but the butter is not butter. it&apos;s not even
margarine as far as I could figure. So I gave that a skip and instead
found happiness with the cereal and milk they also offer, unusual for
most hostels.
Lunch of leftovers. Not much on the book exchange shelves here so
just borrowed one to read... Dick Frances &quot;Second Wind&quot;. When I
finished that, I read more Don Quixote. I have been surprised at how
many travelers have never even heard of Don Quixote. I at least knew
the name and something about a crazy guy who went tilting at
windmills. I wasn&apos;t at all sure I would want to read the book, but
I&apos;m finding it quite amusing and clever at times. But, it&apos;s rather a
pain to read as it&apos;s necessary to constantly refer to the notes in the
back of the book in order to get context. There are many references
to other books of the era that I&apos;m not at all familiar with. These
are mostly books on chivalry and knights errant which gave Don Quixote
his idea to become a knight.
It&apos;s Mother&apos;s Day and when Mick let me use Skype on his computer, I
managed to catch my whole family together celebrating with my Mom. It
was great to talk with them. The funny thing was they were eating
Mexican food. I&apos;ve had very little ethnic food on this trip and since
there&apos;s a Mexican place here in Bariloche, that&apos;s where Mick and I
were planning on going even before I called home. It was so nice to
have something different for dinner. The picante sauce was only a
little picante but tasted good. I had a delicious burrito that was
grilled and served with a huge pile of guacamole and a smaller pile of
lettuce and sour cream.
After dinner, it had stopped raining so we walked around town a bit.
This town is known for its chocolate and there are more chocolate
stores here than I think I&apos;ve seen anywhere in my life. And they are
huge stores, too. There&apos;s a large German influence here so there&apos;s a
lot of exposed beams in the construction around here. Also a bunch of
rustic wood trim housing.
We successfully resisted the chocolate shops and had flan for dessert.
Flan can be bought in small refrigerated cups in the supermarket,
right next to the pudding cups. It&apos;s not quite as good as home made
but it&apos;s not bad and it&apos;s something I&apos;ve been eating quite frequently
when I want something to follow a meal.
But we had the flan before we realized the hostel was doing an ice
cream run. But our little flan cups weren&apos;t a barrier so we got in on
the ice cream run, too. I had some delicious Chocolate Profundo (Very
dark chocolate) and Dulce de Leche. Delicious! 
Monday, May 11: Bariloche

Woke up to a beautiful sunrise shining on all the new snow in the
hills just above town. When it rained here, it was snowing there.
Temperatures are just above freezing here at the lake front so you
don&apos;t have to go high to get to ice. Alternated picture taking on the
balcony and breakfast while warming up.
Mick and I went to Cerro Catedral, a large ski area near town, but
were disappointed to find that the gondola wasn&apos;t going to be running
so we wandered around, slipping and sliding on the snow and ice, got
some hot chocolate and waited for the next bus back to town. Wasn&apos;t
feeling great after lunch so I just took it easy regardless of the
great weather. Read Carver&apos;s &quot;Cathedral&quot;, a collection of rather
strange short stories. 
Tuesday, May 12: Bariloche to Villa la Angostura

Plans to rent a car to visit the lakes in the region disintegrated
this morning when we couldn&apos;t get through to the car rental agency and
the others involved just didn&apos;t seem all that interested in finding
alternatives. So I packed up and checked out.
I grabbed a bus to this little town where almost all of the hospedaje
have closed for the season. Left my backpack at the visitor&apos;s center
while I walked around downtown and did some shopping at the grocery
store. Then walked the 1 kilometer out of town to the affordable
hospedaje. It&apos;s a nice place with full kitchen access, slow internet
on an old computer, a TV, and with so few people here at the hospedaje
(just one other couple), that I have my own room, albeit a very cold
room.
There are some touristy things to do in the neighborhood but since
transportation is a bit of a problem around here (everything is a few
kilometers from the town), I&apos;ll probably just head out in the morning
and make my way to my next stop, San Martin de los Andes.

Subject: 5/13-14: Villa la Angostura to San Martin de los Andes
Well with rain expected today and torrential rain expected tomorrow,
I&apos;m going to try to get out of town and back into Chile, not that I&apos;m
expecting the weather to be any better there. Tim&apos;s sticking around
here a bit longer so I&apos;ll be on my own again.
Not sure if I&apos;ll make it all the way to my destination today or not.
Once again, I&apos;m planning on taking a route little used by tourists but
through what should be pretty mountains and lakes. After finally
leaving Patagonia for the last time, I entered the Lakes region and it
has proven true to its name. There&apos;s plenty of water in these parts.
Mara] 
Wednesday, May 13: Villa la Angostura to San Martin de los Andes
(about 100km hitching)

Sent one last email from the Windows98 computer at Hospedaje Hongo
(mushroom) this morning and then hit the road. Rather than wait for
the 1pm bus, I stuck my thumb out. As I had sort of expected, one
person stopped and gave me a 15km ride to the crossroads. From there,
I wouldn&apos;t have to thumb the cars heading to Chile on most cars
passing me would either be going very locally, would be going to the
next crossroads, or would be going all the way through to San Martin
de Los Andes. Quite a few cars passed me and most pointed. It
doesn&apos;t matter where they point. If they point, then I know they&apos;re
going someplace locally.
Standing there, I came to the conclusion that hitching in the cold may
not be all that great an idea. Then again, as soon as I got the ride,
that idea flew out the window and I keep wanting to hitch some more.
I really do prefer to hitch.
I had waited maybe 15 minutes for my first ride and then maybe 30
minutes for the second. When a car finally stopped, it was a couple,
perhaps around 60ish, who were on their own vacation and traveling
from Buenos Aires. With just my smallish pack, it was easy to climb
in the car. Finally, I got into a car with tourists who wanted to be
tourists. They didn&apos;t stop at every mirador, but they did stop at
quite a few of them. Not only that, they frequently got out of the
car, too; sometimes to smoke, sometimes to take pictures, but always
at a picturesque spot. So, I could get out as well and get pictures
of some of the very pretty lakes and mountains in the region. I think
I&apos;m glad the car rental thing didn&apos;t work out for yesterday as much of
the route we would have taken was repeated in this stretch of road.
So, I missed one side of a loop, but it was the side with only one
lake so I didn&apos;t miss out on much.
In town, I got dropped at a plaza and soon made my way to the main
plaza and information center. Surprise, surprise! This one had
public bathrooms. Most Information Centers do not.
The gave me a map of the town, pointed me in the right direction for a
good hostel, cheap, not in the guide book, with breakfast, kitchen
access, and a blazingly fast computer. Or is it just fast relative to
the dinosaur I used yesterday? Hmm...
I dropped my stuff, and grabbed a burger and fries at Pepperoni&apos;s.
Then I went for a small hike, 40 minutes to a Mirador Bandurrias,
overlooking the lake. The views were great and the hike was nice,
too. It was an easy enough hike that my knees only gave a few little
twinges here and there. It was nice to do a hike and feel great on
the trail and have no aches and pains once back in town.
I haven&apos;t been here for long, but I think I like this town even though
it&apos;s very touristy. I think it`s because the town has active people.
I&apos;ve seen people running, road cycling, mountain bicycling, playing
tennis, playing soccer, and more. They&apos;re locals participating in
these activities, not tourists. That&apos;s unusual. I&apos;ve rarely seen
anyone enjoying physical activity much less this many people enjoying
this many sports all in one town. Of course, in many of the towns
I&apos;ve been through, people use hard physical labor for their jobs so
may not be inclined to get more physical exercise for fun.
I stopped at the store and got some dinner provisions. Back at the
hostel, there were a few other people there so I&apos;m not alone here like
I thought I might have been. They ended up going out for dinner so I
stayed behind and cooked my own. I wish I had gone with them. The
ravioli I bought were rather doughy and though supposedly filled with
ricotta, I couldn&apos;t taste any cheese whatsoever. The sauce I bought
was also rather bland. Oh well. I&apos;ll probably end up tossing the
leftovers tomorrow as I won&apos;t want to eat them again.
One of the people here is an Irish guy who&apos;s been doing a bunch of
surfing. He&apos;s interested in going back to Chile and expressed
interest in joining me for one of the routes I&apos;m thinking of hitching
back into Chile. But I&apos;m not sure I want to hitch with a guy carrying
two surfboards even though he said he&apos;s not had problems getting
rides. Hmm. I&apos;ll have to decide if I want to deal with this. Of
course, the weather may decide this for me. I&apos;m not all that keen on
hitching in the rain and the weather is supposed to deteriorate
tomorrow while I`m still here in town and get steady for the next day.
 Yuck. That may make it bus weather regardless off this guy&apos;s
adventurous spirit.
Knowing I would be here at a hostel with fridge and freezer for two
nights or more, I bought ice cream for dessert. 
Thursday, May 14: San Martin de los Andes

After a meager breakfast of bread with butter (at least it&apos;s real
here) and elderberry jam, supplemented with my own banana and orange,
I walked up to another mirador with Veronica (from Germany) and Sarah
(from Austria). It was 4km each way. The rain in the forecast for
today has held off and made for a nice though cold morning.
We stopped at a supermarket on the way back to the hostel so I picked
up a prebaked pizza crust and some cheese to use with the sauce I have
back at the hostel. It made a cheap but halfway decent lunch. Hung
out at the hostel. Went to dinner with Tom and Veronica and had trout
with mushroom cream sauce that was delicious. The potato torta thing
could have used fewer herbs but was an OK accompaniment. One quick
game of cutthroat air hockey at a gaming store with Tim and then back
to the hostel to hang out.

Subject: 5/15-16: San Martin de los Andes, Argentina to Valdivia, Chile
Here are a couple of journal entries including a link to letters some
students in Wisconsin wrote to me and the text of my response below.
Mara] 
Friday, May 15: San Martin de los Andes, Argentina to Puerto Fuy,
Chile (45km hitch)

As of 3:30pm, it&apos;s already been a good travel day and the day&apos;s not over yet.
This morning, Tim made eggs to go with the meager bread, butter and
jam we get. I then sent off an email to a friend&apos;s, daughter&apos;s 
teacher. Her class is doing a section on South America and each
student wrote me a letter with questions. With permission and with
all identifying information blanked out, the letters are posted at
(site deleted as it was temporary and no longer available). As it&apos;s not a 
permanent site, I&apos;ll probably post a copy on my own web site
eventually. I&apos;ve also included my response to the letters below. I
consolidated the answers, by topic rather than respond to the
individual letters, into one email and sent it back to the teacher. I
also suggested to the teacher that any unfamiliar terms I used could
be fodder for more class activities such as creating a glossary for my
letter. I imagine that some of the animals I mentioned and place
types such as Pantanal would be worthy to include.
I walked to the bus station to get information for the bus along the
route I want to take only to find out there is no bus. I did confirm,
however, that if I could get to Lago Pirihueico, on the Chilean side
of the border, the ferry would be running. I also checked into
alternative ways of getting into Chile and there&apos;s a bus going the
less interesting way leaving at 6am in the morning tomorrow. So, I
decided to try my luck at hitchhiking today knowing that if I don&apos;t
get a ride, I can always return to the hostel and leave on the bus
tomorrow.
Back at the hostel, I grabbed my backpack and my sign (I&apos;m still using
the notebook that Wim and I had bought to show our destination).
Then, as I was walking toward the edge of town where the hitching is
better, I left my sign out and managed to get a ride to the best
spot to hitch. Then, not 10 minutes later, I get a ride. This route
is not well traveled (or else there would be a bus even in the off
season), so I just got lucky. The guy who picked me up told me he was
going 12km. But we went a lot further than that and I realized he was
going as far as only 12km to the border - a walkable distance. When
we got to his destination, he had decided to just drop his load (he
was pulling a large oil tank) and he would take me to the border
himself. Cool!
So, I got to see the lumber yard that he apparently operates. The
lumber yard operation and harvest area was interesting. It&apos;s either
in or surrounded by Lanin National Park and was started generations
ago by German and Italian immigrants who planted Ponderosa and Oregon
Pine trees from North America. These trees grow for 30-32 years
before being ready for harvest. The area is now being converted
solely to National Park. I think the last planting of trees was 20
years ago at this point. What they do now, is that when they harvest
these plantations of non-native trees, they replant with native
species. The process will apparently take 60 years (retroactively,
maybe), but then the entire area will be National Park lands. I also
got a tour of the facilities and saw raw logs on one side, some cut
for log cabins, and others cut into regular boards. There wasn&apos;t any
saw work going on when I was there but I did get to see the large
sawmill where trees are stripped and cut as desired. They also had a
large German generator(?), Wolf brand, from 1928 there. I&apos;ve seen
quite a few of smaller versions in various towns representing the
pioneers who started many of these smaller towns.
There were also Cypress and Sequoia trees on the property, both types
of which were probably also imported and non-native.
What was even more interesting was that even though it took a bit of
explaining and restating, I managed to glean all this information from
my ride even though he spoke almost no English. Every now and then,
he would pull a word out of his hat, but for the most part, I was
figuring it all out from his Spanish. So, I might have gotten some
specifics wrong, but the general gist is correct.
After the tour, when he finished pumping the oil from his portable
tank to the larger permanent tank on site, he gave me a ride the rest
of the way to the border. There, I got my exit stamp for Argentina,
ate my lunch (I had an apple with me that couldn&apos;t be brought into
Chile), and then knowing how little traffic there was, started hoofing
it to Chile. Yesterday, not one car had passed through the border.
It was threatening to rain so I almost stayed put hoping for a ride
and to stay dry but I had limited time and knew that I could make it
to the ferry by walking if I started right away.
So, I started walking. It turns out that this frontier, Paseo Hua Hum
(ho hum?) is probably one of the shortest between the two countries.
It was only about 5km from the Argentinean and Chilean immigration
stations. I made it in just over an hour, including stops to pile on
the rain gear when it started raining and to take pictures at the
actual border signs, something I hadn&apos;t been able to do for most
crossings. Thankfully, the rain never got all that heavy and it was a
reasonably pleasant walk. I think I surprised a few of the people
living in this frontier area when I went walking through.
The folks at the Chilean immigration office were obviously a bit
surprised to see me walk up to the immigration station. They had to
run and get someone who spoke English to get me through the process.
I had to answer all the usual questions about what I was doing, where
I was staying, and how long I would be in the country, but they also
asked me some new ones, too. Sure enough, they wanted to know when I
was last in the US, had I been in Mexico, when I left Central America,
etc. It was all about the pork flu. Err, swine flu, err, H1N1 virus.
The woman who saw me through had spent years working both in Park
City, UT and on Nantucket. Go figure. This remote immigration
station is not a permanent position for them, rather, they rotate in
and out on a ten day rotation before working in other areas for a
while.
After getting me through immigration, the woman who helped me through
offered to ask if I can get a ride to the ferry with a pickup she
knows is going across. I got the ride so waited in the dry office
rather than walk through the rain. I put all the warm clothes I had
taken off for my walk back on, and sat to wait for the ride. It was a
good time to write in my journal.
Good thing I got the ride. I had been told it was 10km total to the
ferry from Argentina, but it was 10 MORE km from the Chilean
immigration station and I&apos;m not sure I could have made it in time by
walking. Had I not, I would have had to wait another full day to get
across on the one 5pm (4pm Chilean time) ferry that now runs each day.
The ferry was a large one. It carried two double logging trucks as
well as four pickups. There were comfortable seats in heated rooms
inside. So, even though my ride was also getting onto the ferry, I
grabbed my backpack and brought it inside with me. It was sort of
clear to me that I would not be continuing with the same pickup that
got me to the ferry.
The ferry doesn&apos;t cross this lake, rather is runs the length of this
long skinny lake. Lago Pirihueico is more like a fjord. It&apos;s long,
skinny, and has steep mountains lining both sides of the lake. The
channel markers were frequently placed right on shore. It was rainy
and foggy, but I could still see enough to appreciate the beauty of
the area. I wish I had been able to do the crossing in better weather
but at least the water was calm. It could have been much worse.
I hadn&apos;t really made an effort to find a ride continuing on the other
side of the ferry. One car offered me too short a ride so I let it go
and checked into a hospedaje in Puerto Fuy, deciding to figure
something out the next day. On the ferry, I had been told there were
no buses from Puerto Fuy. It had started raining harder and I didn&apos;t
want to hitch in the dark or the rain.
I got checked into a place for 6000 pesos per night. The power was
out in town but expected back on within the hour. That didn&apos;t happen
so I read first by headlamp, then by candlelight that my host brought
me. Finally, I ate the dinner of carne (beef) she brought me. As
best I could tell, it was chopped beef with shredded carrot, served
with rice, bread and butter, and salad of peeled not quite fully ripe
tomato wedges - about three tomatoes worth. I had no idea how much
dinner was going to set me back, but with the worsening rain and no
power in town, I wasn&apos;t heading out when I didn&apos;t have to.
I read some more, wrote in my journal, and started getting very tired.
 When the power came back on after 8pm, all the guys (construction
crew, perhaps?) staying at the hospedaje turned on the TV to a Spanish
station so with nothing left to hold my interest and being back in the
land of little to no heat and lots of blankets, I crawled into bed at
8:30 and called it a day.
With no bus and worsening weather, I was faced with the possibility of
spending extra time in town until I could hitch out. But, there was
nothing I could do at this point and just went to sleep. The maxim
the long-distance backpacking crowd often uses, &quot;Things will always
work out&quot;, holds true for travel, too. 
Saturday, May 16: Puerto Fuy to Valdivia

As forecasted, last night&apos;s rain turned into this morning&apos;s torrential
downpours alternating with merely very heavy rain. Ugh!
After going to sleep so early, I woke up very early and then slept on
and off until 7:30 when I finally dragged myself out of bed and joined
the last few men having breakfast downstairs. It was the usual bread,
butter, and cheese but today, I was offered hot chocolate instead of
the coffee and tea that are usually the only beverage options.
Fantastic!
After breakfast, I looked out the window and was surprised to see a
bus there. It wasn&apos;t there last night so someone had driven it and
parked it. When I asked about a bus, sure enough, there was going to
be a bus leaving for Panguipulli at 10am. Then, one of the other
people there said 9am. Either way, fantastic! This is another
stretch of road that would have been good to hitch, but not in this
weather. So at 9, I started getting ready but was told to wait.
At 9:40, my host finally sent me outside and the bus came just as I
got to the road. I flagged it down even though it was going in the
wrong direction. The end of the line was at the port so I figured it
was better to wait on the bus than in the rain. As I got on, a little
cat got off. Someone had to go out into the rain to retrieve it. It
seemed to be the driver&apos;s cat. When we got to the port, the driver
got out for a break at the restaurant there and the cat meowed
mournfully for 5 minutes before giving up and curling up next to the
driver&apos;s seat to wait.
Had I missed the bus going in that direction, I would have eventually
found the bus stop shelter and waited in the cold there. But I would
have gotten completely soaked in the process even though it was only a
couple hundred meters down the road.
The driver had parked the bus broadside to the wind and there were a
couple of violent gusts that I thought might send the bus over on it&apos;s
side. Yikes! I did look around and there wasn&apos;t much to land on top
of me if it did, but it was still scary at times. I was looking
forward to getting back into the relative safety of the more enclosed
road rather than the open beach at the port. This wind was also
having an affect on the lake. What had been a nice smooth ride along
the lake yesterday would be quite a bit rougher today. The waves on
the lake were surprisingly large.
As we drove, I got the impression it would have been a beautiful drive
through valleys, between mountains, and along lakes but the rain and
fog outside not to mention the foggy windows inside the bus almost
completely obscured any views I could have had. Even after 11 hours
of sleep, I still nodded off a lot in the bus.
With heavy rain and one very long construction delay along the way, we
were 30 minutes late pulling into the bus station at Panguipulli.
Once there, I didn&apos;t even have time to find out when or if there would
be another bus to Valdivia as one was leaving right away. I gave my
backpack to the helper to put under the bus, and went to grab some
yogurt, chips and cookies for the road. Even so, the bus driver was
closing the door as I walked up. I did not have time to buy my ticket
before boarding the bus but that&apos;s never a problem on these buses that
stop at every little bus stop to take on and let off passengers going
only part of the way. I just paid the helper on his first walk
through of the bus.
Once again, it rained the entire way but this time I got lucky, the
rain quit just as we pulled into Valdivia. I was able to walk through
town, check out one nice but expensive hostel and then make my way to
another cheaper place with better vibes though not as nice.
Once checked in, my first order of business was to get online and use
Skype to call my friend Betsy who was celebrating her birthday. She
wanted me to be there and I even went so far as to check into flights
but it was much too expensive to fly up for the party so I joined them
as best I could with a phone call. It was great to talk with Betsy
and wish her well. Then the phone got passed around to the others
there that I knew, David and flown in from California and Benson from
Boston. I also talked with Ken for the first time in ages.
It was great for me to talk with all of them and a fun surprise for
them to talk with me, too.
I then went for a walk around town, found the market which had already
closed but was still being washed down with high pressure water hoses,
sending scraps of fish back into the river. So, I got to see two huge
sea lions there, begging for scraps and look forward to coming back
when the market is going full blast to really see them in action. The
sea lions are regulars there, begging for food. I knew they were big
animals but I didn&apos;t realize how big. Not as large as elephant seals
but I still wouldn&apos;t want to ever get in their way. The sea lions
were sharing their meal with the chimangas, turkey vultures,
cormorants, gulls, and terns.
It was getting dark, so I made may way to the Bigger supermarket and
bought staples for the next couple of days. A Pasteleria had me
buying a piece of kuchen for after dinner. This area was settled by
Germans and their traditions are still here in the chocolate and beer
available in town. Also things like kuchen are throwbacks to the
original German settlers. Then back at the hostel for dinner,
watching Erin Brokovitch on TV, and more computer time.
---------------------------------------
Here&apos;s my response to the letters I received from the kids...
---------------------------------------
Dear Intermediates;
I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have enough time to answer each of your letters
individually so I&apos;ll answer as many of your questions relevant to my
travels in South America as I can. Since many questions were repeated
in your letters, I&apos;ve organized my response to address the topics
you&apos;ve asked about.
Please forgive me for not answering questions unrelated to South
America. Given the limited time I spend on-line while traveling, I
thought it better to more fully address the topic you are currently
studying. Here are the topics I&apos;ve identified:
Travel information for this trip

I started this trip in Central America, visiting Guatemala, Honduras,
and El Salvador. In February, I left El Salvador and stopped in
Buenos Aires on my way to Ushuaia, in the very southern part of the
continent. After a 20 day cruise to visit the Falkland Islands, South
Georgia Island, and the Antarctic Peninsula, I returned to Ushuaia and
started my travels in South America.
South America is a very large continent and I&apos;m taking my time as I
travel. Since I left Ushuaia in March, I&apos;ve only been to the southern
parts of Argentina and Chile, the two countries that make up the
southern part of South America. At the end of May, I will travel to
Easter Island to see the large stone moai. Easter Island is part of
Chile even though it takes a long plane ride to get there.
Before I return to the United States from this trip, I also hope to
visit Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador including the Galapagos Islands.
But, I&apos;ll only visit those countries if I have enough time.
All of my travels are for personal interest. I enjoy meeting people
from many different places and seeing many different types of
environments. I also enjoy learning about these new places and though
I do learn a great deal by reading, it means so much more to see a
place than to read about a place.
Jet lag

There&apos;s something unusual about visiting South America from the US.
South America is very far away, but the western part of the South
American continent is still in the same time zone as the eastern part
of the United States. So, when I&apos;m in Chile, it&apos;s the same time as
when I`m at home. So, even if I had directly flown here from my home
in Boston, there would be no jet lag.
Now, while I&apos;m traveling back and forth between countries by bus or
boat and there&apos;s at most one hour difference as I go back and forth,
jet lag is not a problem.
Speaking Spanish

When I first got to Central America. I spent two weeks in Guatemala
learning some Spanish. So, I don&apos;t speak very much Spanish but I do
speak enough to get by when I&apos;m traveling. The most important words
to learn in any language when I travel are &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;.
In Spanish, they are hola and muchas gracias. But in Spanish, I can
now arrange bus tickets, a place to stay, and talk a little about my
family, friends, and travels in Spanish.
Culture

In most ways, the culture here is very similar to the culture in the
US. In big cities like Buenos Aires, it&apos;s basically the same as in
big cities in the United States. The primary difference here is that
many people start work later, take a long break in the middle of the
day when many businesses are closed, and go back to work in the
evening. Then dinner doesn&apos;t start until 9 or 10pm.
There are other differences too, especially in small towns or for
those people who live on large ranches away from towns. For example,
many of these people often use horses to get around. They may check
on their cattle or go visit a neighbor. Or they may ride into town to
go shopping. It&apos;s not unusual to see horses on the streets of smaller
towns in South America.
Gauchos are the cowboys of Argentina and Chile. They wear traditional
dress including hats, baggy pants, boots, and ponchos. The women
don&apos;t seem to have traditional clothing that they still wear.
Food

Much of the food in South America is similar to food in the United
States. In Argentina, they eat a lot of beef. In towns, they prepare
it using a parilla, a large indoor grill. In the country, if they&apos;re
able to cook out over a fire, they put very large pieces of meat over
an open fire to cook it slowly and then cut off pieces to be eaten
with your fingers. In Chile, eating fish is very common with salmon
being the most common fish. They farm salmon in Chile.
Other special foods I&apos;ve eaten are milcao which are like potato
pancakes stuffed with pork and fried. This is one of my favorite
foods from South America - so far. Empanadas are common through both
Argentina and Chile. These are pockets of dough filled with spiced
beef, pork, ham and cheese, chicken, or sweet fillings like apples.
They are then baked or sometimes fried and eaten as a snack. Another
common snack in Chile is the completo. The completo is a hot dog on a
large roll, with chopped tomatoes, guacamole, and mayonnaise.
The one thing I miss from where I live in the United States is the
variety of food I can get. In the small towns of southern Argentina
and Chile, there are no ethnic restaurants other than an occasional
pizza restaurant. I don&apos;t have choices like I do at home so rarely
have Chinese, Mexican, or other types of ethnic food.
Environment

The environment in South America is as varied as in the United States.
 So far, I&apos;ve seen pampas, mountains, lakes, fjords, rivers, islands,
rain forest, and more. As I travel north, I hope to also visit
desert, tropical rain forest, jungle, salt flats, and maybe the
Pantanal, a tropical wetland system. Continue reading for more on the
environment.
Weather

I&apos;ve been traveling north from Ushuaia, Argentina, near the southern
tip of South America. I arrived there in February, near the end of
summer. In South America, the seasons are exactly the opposite of
North America so when it&apos;s winter in Wisconsin, it&apos;s summer in South
America. Now, it&apos;s autumn here so the leaves are turning pretty
colors, it&apos;s getting colder, and there&apos;s been some snow in the
mountains. In the towns I&apos;ve been visiting recently, it&apos;s been very
rainy with a nice sunny day every now and then. I try to get out and
see what I can on those nice days. I hope to get to drier areas as I
continue north.
Rain forest

Traveling through southern Chile on the west side of the Andes
Mountains, I traveled through one of the few temperate rain forests in
the world. The area was very green with some very large plants. I
saw ferns that towered over me and some giant rhubarb with leaves as
large as a table.
Volcano

The western part of South America is part of the Ring of Fire. Chile
has hundreds of volcanoes some of which are active. Recently, Volcano
Chaiten erupted and sent ash raining over a large area of Chile and
Argentina. Afterwards, during heavy rain, a lahar sent a huge amount
of mud and ash through the town of Chaiten and forced everyone to
leave. I was able to visit this town during my travels. It was very
strange to see houses buried in mud. Also, when sitting still, we
could frequently feel small earthquakes shake the ground.
Volcan Chaiten also gave me a couple of rocks for souvenirs... I now
have one rock called obsidian and another called pumice. Both are
interesting rocks. Arrowheads and knives with extremely sharp edges
can be made from obsidian. And did you know that pumice is a type of
rock that can float?
Animals

Some of the animals in South America are similar to the ones in North
America. There are beaver, rabbits, hares, skunks, cats, dogs, deer,
seals, and sea lions. Others such as guanaco are very different.
They are related to the alpaca and llamas of other areas of South
America. The birds here are probably the most different from the ones
I&apos;ve seen in the United States. There are flamingos, rhea, penguins,
chimanga caracaras, and more.
Fun

I have had a lot of fun on this trip. Some of my favorite activities
have been hiking in the mountains, doing traditional dances, taking
boat rides, and watching wildlife. One of the most unusual things
I&apos;ve done was to take a boat ride from Puerto Tranquilo to a place
called Marble Caves. The boat actually went into and through some of
these caves that form beautiful archways over the water.
I&apos;ve enjoyed sharing my experiences with you. I hope that you will
all someday take the time to travel and see the world yourselves.
Sincerely,
Mara 
Sunday, May 17: Valdivia

Didn&apos;t do much today. Searched out a laundromat near the hostel only
to find it&apos;s closed for good and the map on the window pointed to one
that didn&apos;t even have a sign out front. So, I&apos;ll eventually just bite
the bullet and pay at the hostel for their very expensive service.
It&apos;s Sunday so many stores are closed. I did find a mall and a huge
supermarket. Did some shopping for foodstuffs that don&apos;t need
immediate refrigeration and got lunch stuffs heated up at the deli
department. Then I took my stuff to the mall and ate in the food
court there.
After lunch, I checked out the theater there and noted the movie times
of the movies I am willing to see. Star Trek is playing as is Angels
and Demons.
Then, for the first time since Buenos Aires, I saw an American fast
food store. This one was McDonald&apos;s but not a full restaurant, just
an ice cream stand. While I&apos;ve seen plenty of The North Faces stores
and even a few Timberland and a United Colors of Benetton in Puerto
Varas, this was the first place in the MickeyDs, BK, or KFC realm I&apos;ve
seen in months.
I was recently trying to figure out the longest period in my life that
I&apos;ve gone without seeing a typical American fast food restaurant, and
it may have been here in South America. Certainly in Southeast Asia,
every time I returned to Bangkok, I saw Burger Kings and McDonalds.
It was maybe 2.5 months between my longest time away from Bangkok
during my 2007/2008 visit. Here, I left Buenos Aires maybe around Feb
12 and it has been more than three months since I&apos;ve seen one of these
restaurants until today. And even today, I only count it because the
golden arches are so recognizable. It&apos;s still not a restaurant, just
a soft serve ice cream cafe.
Oh well... There&apos;ll be plenty more of that when I get to Santiago in
the next week or so.
It was raining when I left the mall so I put on my rain pants and made
my way down to the riverfront to watch the sea lions in action. By
the time I got there, it was only raining in fits and starts so I took
cover under the market awnings in the rain, and stepped out only when
it wasn&apos;t. I made the acquaintance of Pancho, the big bull sea lion.
He would eat entire fish, almost a meter long, in one gulp when handed
to him by the local fishermen. Mostly though, the fishermen would
just throw scraps into the water or to the sea lions as they were
cleaning the fish. These sea lions are huge and fat. They don&apos;t work
for a living any more and I wonder how they compare to those that
don&apos;t rely on humans for food. Are they as healthy, less or more?
Are they overweight for a sea lion or do they self regulate?
They weren&apos;t the only beneficiaries of the fishmongers. Gulls, terns,
turkey vultures, cormorants, chimanga caracaras, pigeons, and even a
few dogs had at it with the scraps.
After seeing a smoke house weeks ago with Wim and Angela, and then
only seeing very expensive smoked salmon in the supermarket, I was
happy to see reasonably priced, or downright inexpensive smoked salmon
at the market. I bought a piece big enough to last me for a couple of
days. It cost 2000 pesos, or around $3.50. The salmon was delicious.
I spent a good part of the evening on the computer deleting pictures
to help make room on my hard drive. So far, I&apos;m still just at the
point where the decisions to keep or delete are easy. It&apos;ll be later
passes where it gets tougher to make those decisions. 
Monday, May 18: Valdivia

Morning computer session. Wandered town with Nicole. With no rain, a
nice surprise, we arranged for an afternoon boat tour. Then as we
made our way to the bus station, we found a great bakery with bread
just coming out of the oven. Delicious. Then at the bus station,
Nicole booked her bus to Bariloche tomorrow and I got bus schedules
for Santiago. I&apos;ll have to decide if I want to go overnight, during
the day, and what kind of seats I want to pay for. There are regular,
semi-cama, cama, and suites available for the 8-11 hour ride.
We went to the mall to see if Nicole could find a game she had been
looking for but got sidetracked by baby goods for her sister&apos;s
upcoming kid, and a home goods store with lots of cute socks. Then
back to the bakery for kuchen, empanadas, and more bread. We went to
the riverfront to eat lunch and then found our boat. Our empanadas
were different from most others. The dough was like soft pretzel
dough, perhaps made with high gluten flour. Delicious. The filling
was good though nothing special.
Finally, we hopped on the boat for a three hour tour (uh oh. Where
have I heard that before? Cue theme from Gilligan&apos;s island.) Our
guide introduce himself in Spanish and then ask me in english if I
understood him. I told him &quot;when you speak English&quot; then wondered
over the next hour and a half why he had bothered to ask me since he
didn&apos;t try to explain anything in English during the tour. So, at one
point when he took a break, I asked if he spoke English and when he
said a little, I asked if there was anything he had already explained
in Spanish that would be interesting for me to know about. So, he
told me a little about what he had already explained. From then on,
he tried to tell me a little about what we were looking at in English.
 Oh well. I don&apos;t really expect tours to be in English but usually
when someone wonders if I understand them, they usually intend to
ensure that I do. He didn&apos;t. Oh well.
The first part of our tour was around the area near town. it was
industrial with a few houses of German architecture. There was also a
submarine that we passed.
I was a little surprised to return back to where we started after an
hour to pick up more passengers. Then we set out on the better part
of the tour. I wish I had taken just the second part of the tour. It
was through the more natural setting of the rivers that led to the
coast from Valdivia. We stopped at the little town of Punucapa to
visit the church that had something from a church in the Canary
Islands but I was more interested in the large and beautiful cypress
tree on the grounds. It was 200 years old and had some wind damage
that it&apos;ll hopefully recover from.
Then we went to a cafe for tea and coffee. We had a choice of fried
cheese empanadas or kuchen. I chose the empanadas and wish I had
gotten the kuchen. I ate one of my empanadas and gave the rest way.
So much of the tour was a bust for me. Oh well. It was cold and dark
by the time we returned so I bundled up and Nicole went inside but
most of the people stayed outside for the return.
With our guide and one of the other passengers, I got into a
conversation about the impact an environmental disaster had a few
years ago when 5000 black necked swans were killed due to an
industrial &quot;accident&quot; where the company was never really held
responsible. That morphed into a discussion of the corruption of the
government and the current state of environmental awareness of both
the people and the politics. Chile&apos;s current economic growth are just
beginning to allow for the added expense (not that it has to be
expensive) of environmental awareness. Many people aren&apos;t aware of
the possibilities and practices associated with recycling and there
are no facilities to do so right now. There has to be awareness from
the people before the government will step in.
We stopped at the smaller Bigger market on the way back to the hostel.
 Nicole and I are the only paying customers in the hostel tonight. So
for the second night, I have a room to myself - and it has a bathroom
so basically I have a private bathroom, too.
I sorted more pictures but mostly watched TV. 
Tuesday, May 19: Valdivia

I woke up to the long expected rain so with nothing else to do in the
morning, I sat in shorts, my rain jacket, and wrapped in my sleeping
bag so that everything else I owned could be put in the laundry at the
same time. It may seem weird to other travelers but at least my
backpack is small and relatively light. It enables me to have
experiences others couldn&apos;t have, such as walking across borders while
carrying all of my stuff.
After lunch, I took an apparently much needed nap of 2.5 hours. I
might have slept longer but someone opened the door to my room and
woke me up. No problem, I needed to get up anyway.
It was still raining but I needed to get out so I decided to go to the
movies. I hoped to see Star Trek. I stopped at a bakery, then did a
bit of shopping in the supermarket attached to the mall. It was only
then when I tried to get money out of the ATM machines that I realized
the ATMs in the mall would only take Master Card and Cirrus. I use
VISA and Plus cards. Argh! I ended up having to go back out into the
rain to find another bank. By the time I got back, Star Trek had long
started so I grabbed a quick dinner at the food court and ended up
seeing Angels and Demons which started an hour later.
For the second time on this trip, I found a movie with a significant
portion of dialogue in a language other than English. What that means
is that here, it was subtitled in Spanish and I missed almost all of
that dialogue. Oh well. It wasn&apos;t a great movie but it kept me
occupied for a few hours. I don&apos;t particularly recommend the movie
but if you have any interest in particle physics and want to see how CERN is portrayed in the movie , it might be worth seeing.
I got soaked on my way back from the movie so am glad I still have a
large room to myself where I can spread out all of my wet gear to dry.
 [Date: Sun May 24, 2009 10:21 am
Subject: 5/20-23: Valdivia to Santiago
I&apos;m sitting here typing with a tiny little kitten sitting on my lap.
Yes, yes, I am allergic to cats, but I like them all the same and this
one is much happier and much quieter sitting on my lap. She, and two
resident dachshunds have kept this place interesting and entertaining
for the time I&apos;ve been here. Unfortunately something happened to one
of the kitten&apos;s eyes last night but while she complained bitterly last
night and the eye still looks very swollen, she seems to be taking it
in stride and isn&apos;t letting it get her down.] 
Wednesday, May 20: Valdivia

Another wet day spent mostly indoors. I finally made it out for the
6pm showing of the Star Trek movie. For anyone who has seen a lot of
the original Star Trek series, it puts a lot in perspective. Actually,
that&apos;s mostly what the movie seems to be about. More about background
history than a story in and of itself. If Angels and Demons was a
date movie, this one was anything but. Last night, everyone or almost
everyone there was part of a couple. Tonight, there were quite a few
other singles, groups of kids, families, friends, etc. but I don&apos;t
remember seeing a single couple in the audience.
I&apos;ll be popping some popcorn in a minute and settling in back here at
the hostel for Mission Impossible III. That is, assuming it&apos;s in
English. 
Thursday, May 21: Valdivia

I woke up to a 21-gun (or cannon) salute, followed by church bells
ringing throughout town. It&apos;s a holiday today commemorating some war
victory over Peru. Many businesses and schools close today so any
take tomorrow off, too to get a four day weekend.
It&apos;s another very rainy day. I went out this morning to buy a bus
ticket for Santiago for tomorrow night. I managed to get a great deal
on a semi-cama seat so hopefully, I&apos;ll find some way to get
comfortable enough to get some sleep on the overnight ride.
I ate Chinese at the food court in the mall. It was a nice change of
pace but the wasn&apos;t all that great.
I spent the rest of the say in the hostel, playing UNO, burning a DVD,
watching movies, and drying out my clothes that got wet while out and
about.
After four nights in a large room to myself, there are now four of us
in the room.
 [Typing continuing from Santiago where, alas, there&apos;s no little kitten
contributing to the effort.] 
Friday, May 22: Valdivia

Spent the day (afternoon, really), at the Kunstmann Cerveceria
(brewery). No tours on tap, just a one room museum to peruse. Then
had lunch at their restaurant. I mostly ate mine while my friends,
Elodie, Adolfo, and one other mostly drank theirs though they did
order a plate of munchies at one point. I had a very good hot dog,
this time with sauerkraut, some sort of salsa, mayonnaise, and maybe
some other stuff. Even the actual hot dog was good and flavorful on
this one. Had a moist cinnamon apple strudel for dessert. Delicious.
We had been overcharged by a taxi whose meter quit on the way out to
the brewery so grabbed a bus going back, especially since the rain was
quitting. We stopped in the center to go see the sea lions where they
haul out of the water for the night.
Needing a bathroom, we went to one ubiquitous place that usually has
public bathrooms. McDonald&apos;s. I didn&apos;t know there was one in town
until we went to see the sea lions and caught sight of a full
McDonald&apos;s restaurant. Oh well. As usual, they are good for one
thing and they had no complaints when we went to use their facilities.
 But, we ended up getting McFlurries there. I think they are a bit
smaller than in the US but a lot cheaper, at only 1000 pesos or less
than two dollars. But they don&apos;t mix them here, just put the toppings
on top and serve it like a sundae.
Back at the hostel, I played a bit of UNO until it was time to get my
ride to the bus station. I caught a 10:15pm overnight bus to
Santiago. I was surprised at how much smaller these seats were than
the semi-cama bus I had taken in Argentina. It was going to be a
tight fit and the person in front of me wasn&apos;t going to be happy to be
told they couldn&apos;t recline but then I found a double seat in back
where I could sit or lie sideways and take up two seats. 
Saturday, May 23: Santiago

I went to sleep last night in wet, cold, windy, and miserable
Valdivia. I woke up this morning, 800km further north in Chile, to
warm, sunny weather. Sometime in the middle of the night, we passed
through a transition area from the wet southern region to a dry more
tropical region. Not only the weather changed, but the vegetation as
well. I&apos;ve already seen a few palm trees here.
Once here in Santiago, I was about to hop on the metro system for a
couple of stops when I decided to walk the couple of kilometers to my
hostel. I walked out of the bus station/mall/train station and found
a bunch of kids doing a variety of forms of juggling. There were also
some drummers there and they were juggling in time to the drummers.
There were traditional jugglers, devilsticks, diablo, and a rhythmic
ribbon performer as well. Some of them were fantastic, especially the
diablo guys. Two of them were not only doing their own tricks, but
were tossing back and forth to each other as well.
I would have watched longer but they were with a religious outreach
group and though when asked what religion I was, I told them I wasn&apos;t
there to discuss religion, it sort of grated on the woman who was
there to talk with people. The kids however didn&apos;t care and were just
happy to have someone there who appreciated what they were doing and
wanted to pose for pictures.
I then walked the couple of kilometers to the Casa Roja, an old
mansion with 15&apos; high ceilings turned hostel. I spent the morning
there, researching where to find things in town, then went to the
supermarket to buy food for lunches and breakfasts. It was nice to
make lunch and then eat it in the garden, enjoying good weather for
the first time in months, having been chased north by fall and winter
through all of Patagonia and the Lakes regions.
I took a nap and then eventually found the Israeli woman, Anate, I had
met in Bariloche. She and a Brit, Naomi, and I went out to eat at the
one Indian restaurant in Chile which was at a Best Western Majestic
Hotel nearby. I had heard good things about it from some travelers I
had met further south. We knew it was likely to be expensive and it
was, relatively speaking for this area, but I wasn&apos;t expecting really
good food. It was very good food and we were all happy with out
dinner. We shared a Vegetable kofta dish, Chicken Korma, and Nan.
All were very good.
When we got back to the hostel, we saw an interesting looking group
heading into the restaurant next door. There were three women dressed
in long black dresses with capes that had puffy shoulders and one guy
dressed normally. I thought they might be part of an SCA (Society for
Creative Anachronism) group but they were a singing group that had
permission to provide entertainment in the restaurant in exchange for
tips. But they were told to wait an hour so with us being a willing
audience, they proceeded to give us a private concert right on the
street. They all sang, one played mandolin, another guitar, and the
third played a mean tambourine and danced.
Three were students at the local college and the dancer was still in
high school. They were wonderful. It&apos;s quite amazing that twice in
one day, I get semi/private street performances by people who were
really good at what they do. Fantastic! 
Sunday, May 24: Santiago

I was up relatively early (8am) but still didn&apos;t get out until 10:30
or so. I made my way past the Gothic church we had seen in the dim
light last night and over the cable stayed pedestrian bridge. I
passed a bunch of homeless sleeping on the street who asked for money
and found the pedestrian area. My map was wrong so I circled the
wrong block looking for the pre-Columbian museum only to find it on
the next block after asking one of the police. I thought it would be
a small place and not take much time, but I spent a couple of hours
there easily. The museum included many similar artifacts to those
that I had seen in Central America but then also showed how southern
Central and South American artifacts relate to those from further
north and to each other. There was plenty of information in English
though there was more in Spanish. No complaints though. It was still
interesting.
There was also a temporary exhibit there showing pictures of a
pictographs from an area north of Santiago. I&apos;m now hoping to go
there but I don&apos;t know how accessible it is. This exhibit also had
mummified remains that are 3000 years older than those found in Egypt.
By the time I emerged from the museum, it was 1:30 and too late to
seek out another of the museums that are free on Sundays but only open
until 2pm.
So, I wandered the pedestrian areas where there was a street fair of a
sort set up regardless of the fact that many of the businesses behind
them were closed for Sunday. I found more traditional dancing there
but it was only the dance that requires set steps so not something I
could step up and do. I watched for a while and then walked to the
nearby Plaza de Armas in the center of the city. Lots of people out
and about there including many evangelists preaching quite often to
nobody.
I returned to the hostel to cook myself a late lunch. I was tired so
I spent time on the computer and took a nap. I was woken up when
Jimmy, one of the volunteers I had met at Ulaa, moved in. We caught
up on each others adventures. His included just getting out of Ulaa.
All of the rain we had been having amounted to a lot of flooding in
their area. A couple of people who had gone across to Argentina had
gotten stranded there and are waiting for the water level to go down
so they can get back. And when Jimmy left, all the usual transports
were flooded and rock slides were blocking roads so alternative
transport with the police had been arranged to get him back to Puerto
Montt.
Jimmy and I ended up going out for Chinese for dinner. The spring
rolls were delicious and the mains were pretty good, too. Just
Cantonese options though.
I hope to continue to have a wide variety of food here in Santiago
where there are options. Most of the food in the rest of the country
is rather plain and bland. Other options I hope to have here in town
include Thai and Sushi.
Experiences I don&apos;t particularly want to have include all the American
fast food restaurants I found around the Plaza de Armas area including
Burger King, McDonald&apos;s, KFC, and Dunkin Donuts. I&apos;ve also seen Tony
Roma&apos;s and Benihana advertisements here, too.
Back at the hostel, the internet was down so I took the opportunity to
use the computer to copy pictures from my camera to my hard drive
without worrying about the 30 minute per session limit. 
Monday, May 25: Santiago

Argh! I seem to have brought the rain with me. Anate, the Israeli
who has also been traveling slowly north feels the same way. It had
rained once in the last six weeks here in Santiago and after just a
couple of days here, it&apos;s already raining. So, a slow morning getting
out of here. Finally got out of here after lunch of leftover Chinese.
Went for a walk with a bunch of girls from the hostel, repeating much
of what I had done yesterday but yesterday&apos;s deserted streets were
bustling today. We tacked on the fish market which was more
restaurants and less market than I had expected. But the wrought
iron building, in and of itself an attraction, was interesting and a
man there was able to tell us where other similar buildings in the
world were.
Went for delicious hot chocolate when it started raining. Then a
supermarket visit. Hung out at the hostel and then went to the Vacuna
Gordos (Fat cow) restaurant for dinner with a crown of seven. This
time, I had the filet mignon - delicious. I mostly went for the
social aspect though. It meant putting off sushi dinner another night
or two.
Back at the hostel, I met Igor, a guy I had met in Puerto Natales
twice, then Villa Cerro Castillo, and finally here. Apparently Ron,
another Israeli is in town, too. I&apos;ve met him in a few places
including Puerto Natales, El Calafate, El Chalten, Puerto Tranquillo,
and Villa Cerro Castillo. He&apos;s got a disability that makes walking
very difficult and slow but has managed quite a few hikes with the
help of some irreverent but cool other travelers he befriended in El
Calafate. It&apos;s pretty amazing how much he&apos;s gotten around, including
a bunch of hitchhiking as well. 
Tuesday, May 26: Santiago

Wandered town this morning, &quot;discovering&quot; completely new sections of
town including the markets that only locals tend to visit. I found
the flower market, the fruit and vegetable market, the clothing
market, and even vendors selling freshly squeezed orange and
grapefruit juice right on the street. I also wandered through
sections of town with electronics stores and other themed
neighborhoods reminding me of my experiences in Buenos Aires albeit on
a smaller scale.
I was walking through these areas en route to Clinica Davila, a
hospital with walk-in clinic and laboratory. As I thought, I didn&apos;t
need to see the doctor, I just paid my $40 and had the tests done. I
can get the results Thursday night or when I return from Easter Island
in June.
I returned to the hostel by way of the fresh squeezed OJ and a flaky
pastry version of an alfajore as well as a Chinese restaurant for an
order of rice. Jimmy left last night but left his leftovers behind so
I ended up eating them for lunch. Real juice, even from concentrate,
is almost impossible to find here. All the juice in the supermarkets
here is &quot;nectar&quot; or water, concentrate, sugar, and other additives.
So, having the fresh squeezed OJ was delicious.
Mid-afternoon, I walked to the metro station and took the subway six
stops and then walked to the base of Cerro San Cristobal. There, I
took the funicular up the hill with two woman I met in line. We also
bought tickets for the cable car and then rode that down and back up
the hill. We climbed to the top to see the view from the feet of the
very large Madonna that overlooks the city. It was built in 1987 or
so after a visit by the Pope. A church, a large outdoor area for
services and a smaller area for more private church-type gatherings
all occupied the top of the hill and religious music was blaring from
loudspeakers. But the view had potential not fully reached today.
There was no rain but the smog in the area is very bad so the view was
obscured by haze.
We stayed on top until it got dark, they lit the Madonna, and the
lights in the city twinkled on. Igor showed up, having walked up,
something I might do another day. Once at the bottom, I checked out
the Thai restaurant and was disappointed to find that it was mostly a
sushi place that has pad thai and maybe a few other Thai dishes on the
menu. Without others to share a few dishes with, I didn&apos;t want to
stick around for another hour and a half until the restaurant opened
at 8pm so I made my way back to the hostel and spent more time trying
to figure out if I should commit to a return flight back to the US.
Earlier today, I decided to start paying attention to how much flights
are back to the US so I would know if a good deal came up. Well,
after checking out any number of one way tickets from Ecuador or Peru
to Boston or New York in the $700 range, I stumbled upon a round trip
airfare from either Ecuador or Peru to New York for just $400. I can
use the outgoing ticket and just throw away the return ticket.
Somehow, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to find any fares better than that
but I have to purchase this ticket by the end of the week. The
problem is trying to determine where I&apos;m going to be at the end of
August.
And hey! If I decide I want more time in South America, I can always
use the return portion anyway, and just turn it into a vacation in the
US from my travels in South America. LOL.
So, I spent more time on-line in the evening trying to figure out
where to fly home from, when to fly back based on whether or not I can
visit friends in New York City area, and other related stuff.
I eventually realized I had never had dinner. I wasn&apos;t all that
hungry though that probably had to do with the banana/orange ice cream
cone I ate when I didn&apos;t stop for Thai food. So, I sipped a cup of
bouillon, ate some crackers, had an apple and called it dinner.
 [Date: Thu May 28, 2009 10:37 pm
Subject: 5/27-28: Santiago
I&apos;m leaving tomorrow morning to spend a week on Easter Island. Of the
people I&apos;ve met who spent three or four days there, they all said it
was enough time. Those who spent a week there, said they needed more
time. Hopefully, I&apos;ll find a week is enough time.
I&apos;m looking forward to seeing the moai and marveling at a culture that
found some value in carving huge pieces of rocks into large heads and
bodies and transporting them with methods that are still a puzzle to
this date. Last year, it was the Plain of Jars in Laos that had me
wondering the same thing.
I&apos;m not sure if internet access will be all that affordable there
unless I end up at a place where it&apos;s included so if I don&apos;t get
around to sending email for a while, it&apos;ll probably be just a short
break until I get back to Santiago on June 6.

Wednesday, May 27: Santiago

Not much sleep last night... Three times someone came in and turned
the overhead light on. Then it seemed like someone was doing laps in
the hallway, slamming doors as they went, and finally, it sounded like
people were moving furniture outside our door. I finally gave up at
8, ate breakfast, and showered in time for a 10am haircut I had
scheduled for here at the hostel. Yes, someone came to the hostel to
cut my hair. How cool is that? It reminded me of the time I was
hiking the PCT and someone came to the motel I was staying in to give
me a haircut. (Wow! May 15, 2003 .)
Today&apos;s goal was to find some cheap sunglasses and I found a great
deal of them but only very expensive ones in the optician section of
town - yes, an entire section of town with small shop after small shop
of opticians. Mostly, I had been looking for a small kiosko or street
vendor selling them. I did find a couple of street vendors selling
them but with a tiny selection that wouldn&apos;t work for me. I realized
that this time of year in Santiago it&apos;s cloudy and smoggy almost all
the time so the need for sunglasses is rare. There are many more
vendors selling umbrellas than sunglasses.
So in all my wanderings today, I never found a pair of cheap
sunglasses and since I don&apos;t seem to be able to keep them in one piece
for very long, having already broken two pair on this trip, I don&apos;t
want to spend the small fortune that the optician&apos;s shops want. But,
I may get taken for a ride once I get to Easter Island. If it&apos;s sunny
and I need them, I may have an even smaller pool of sunglasses to
choose from once on the island.
I did make it up Cerro Santa Lucia, a small but steep, much
castellated hill in the middle of town that affords great views all
around. The climb up involves taking any number of maze/like
stairways and paved paths. There are bridges where the &quot;trail&quot; goes
over itself and arches to go through. As I was on my way up, two
grown men seemed to be roughhousing as they came down the hill. I
gave a shout to make sure they didn&apos;t bowl me over and they continued
past me without involving me in their little shoving match. It was
only afterward that I realized one of the men was a security guard and
wasn&apos;t a willing contributor. I was watching other guards watching
them descend and I think there were more guards meeting the pair at
the bottom but judging by their behavior for the next hour, the guy
must have gotten away.
I took the shortest path I could find going up the hill but then
explored the hill a bit, taking random paths and staircases as I came
down. I ran into one of the other hostel guests on the hill and since
I was trying to get a good look at one of the many hummingbirds
flitting around, I was able to point one out to him, his first ever
sighting of a wild hummingbird.
After a stop at a supermarket for breakfast food for tomorrow, I made
my way back to the hostel for a much needed nap. In the evening, I
watched the slide show of a tour group that goes north from here.
They are trying to drum up business but rushing north to do all of
northern Chile in a week or so is not my idea of a good time.
Afterward, Johanna and I went next door to Platypus for a delicious
meal of sushi. 
Thursday, May 27: Santiago

Slept somewhat better last night but still woke up early to more
activity that I wanted. Met Julia and combined our laundry so that
left me hanging around today in shorts. It&apos;s warmer here than down
south, but it&apos;s not really shorts weather so I&apos;m mostly stuck in the
hostel for the day. I ran out to copy the Easter Island pages from
someone else&apos;s Chile and Easter Island guide book as there&apos;s more
complete information in there than in the South America guide book.
Booked my flight home from Lima, Peru to New York on August 25. I
didn&apos;t really want to buy my ticket home this early because I&apos;m not
sure where I&apos;m going to be but I got such a great deal I decided to go
with my best guess. I&apos;ll visit with friends in NY and then make my
way to Boston, perhaps picking my car up in Connecticut on the way.
Went to a local restaurant for lunch and had Alemana Asado, the
meatloaf with an egg in it. It came with ensalada which was just
sliced celery with a few strands of grated carrot on top, fried
potatoes, and dessert but they were out of flan so the only other
choice was raspberry jello. But for 1800 peso plus 200 tip, I can&apos;t
complain. That&apos;s less than $4.
I did an initial pack of my backpack and came up with a plastic
shopping bag full of stuff to leave here in Santiago until I return.
Then realized I had a lot of room to fill in my backpack. I did some
food shopping as it&apos;s much less expensive to buy food here than on
Easter Island plus it&apos;ll help fill my backpack so it&apos;ll travel better
on the airplane. Then I found a lady making cheese and mushroom
empanadas. Even though I&apos;m not crazy about the fried ones, I couldn&apos;t
resist and bought some. They were delicious! With an apple and a
pudding, I called it dinner.
Shortly before 10pm, I went upstairs to the TV room to see if people
would be willing to watch the Mentalist at 10pm. Nobody said they
were watching anything else so when it came on, I was a bit surprised
when this guy who seems to be living here at the hostel started
switching channels. When I asked if he was planning on watching
something else, he didn&apos;t say anything. At more prompting, he said he
had been trying to watch this other movie. When I asked which one, he
ignored me again and just pointed at the TV and told me Lionsgate. I
said that&apos;s the production company, not the name of the movie. Oh
well... The name of the movie eventually came on. it was Hard Candy,
nothing I wanted to see starting at 10pm when I have to get up at 5am
tomorrow morning. 
Friday, May 28 to Friday, June 5: Easter Island

From Santiago, I took a side trip to Easter Island. I&apos;ve included my journal entries
 from that trip on a separate page .

Saturday, June 6 : Santiago

Did laundry and since it was cold, that meant I passed the day at the
hostel. I took the time to sort through Easter Island pictures. I
had a good chunk of time on the computers because the internet went
down and nobody else wanted to use them. How convenient!
I also spent part of the day having one of the hostel staff members
help me try to get my battery charger back. I left it on Easter
Island but at least from there, almost everyone comes through Santiago
so it should be a no brainer to have it sent back on the plane with
someone. We&apos;ll see what happens...
Went back to the Best Western Hotel Majestic for Indian dinner. It
wasn&apos;t as good as last time. Oh well.
With internet back up in the evening, I uploaded a bunch of pictures
to Picasa. (Let me know if you want the link to see them.) 
Sunday, June 7: Santiago

It was a very cold and gray day today with the sun just trying to make
an appearance in the afternoon. I visited the Museo de Santiago (Casa
Calorado) with dioramas depicting important historical events in the
history of both Santiago and Chile. Then I went to the Palacio de
Belles Artas to visit the Museo de Belles Artas which was mostly
painted wall art, not my favorite though I did marvel at the sheer
size of some of the pieces. They reminded me of the Night Watch.
When I was done there, I walked around to the other side of the
building to visit the Museo de Arte Contemporeano. I was surprised to
see a very long line waiting to get in. Knowing that the exhibits
there are supposed to be hit or miss, I figured this one must be a hit
and got into line.
I did notice while in line that there were a large number of families
in line. It was only after waiting in line for 30 minutes, when I was
finally approaching the building that I engaged the family in front of
me in conversation. It was only then that I realized it wasn&apos;t
&quot;families&quot; in line, it was parents and &quot;girls&quot; in line. The special
exhibit at the museum was the 50th Anniversary of Barbie exhibit.
Hey! What else was I going to do during the day. So I stayed in line
and besides, there were other exhibits there, too. When I realized it
looked like people were paying, I tried to ask if people were paying
because the other museums were all free on Sundays. And if so, how
much did it cost. Most are inexpensive and I wouldn&apos;t have a problem
paying. The man in front of me, perhaps thinking I didn&apos;t want to pay
to see a Barbie exhibit, paid my entrance fee. I tried to pay him
back but he wouldn&apos;t take the cash.
So, I went to see the Barbie exhibit. I couldn&apos;t believe the crowd.
I found one from 1959, the year Barbie came out. I found one from
1965, the year I was born, and it was astronaut Barbie. There were
others but not necessarily one from each year. Many years had
multiple examples and many years had none. I think I might have had a
Barbie doll at one point in my life but since I don&apos;t remember, I
don&apos;t think it was ever a huge deal to me. It was interesting to see
how elaborate some of the Barbie costumes got. Major designers
designed for Barbie and Barbie copied many of the worlds popular
women. Imagine Barbie in Cher&apos;s black costume.
After having my fill of the crowds, I beat a hasty retreat to the main
level to visit the other exhibits. My favorite of the other exhibits
was Antonio Quintana&apos;s ( 1904-1972) photography .
After the museums, I wandered back through Plaza de Armas where they
had all the roads closed in preparation for a concert that evening.
It was cold so I ducked into a McDonald&apos;s for an ice cream (yeah,
yeah, outside temperature has nothing to do with eating ice cream) and
to sit for a while and start to figure out where I&apos;m going next and
what I want to see as I travel further north in Chile. Back at the
hostel, I napped, then went shopping but it was too cold to go back to
the plaza to stand outside to listen to music.
No news about my charger today. I might be here in Santiago for a
while if the hostel on Easter Island puts it in the mail for me
instead of sending it with someone flying over. 
Monday, June 8: Santiago

This morning, I went with Sandra, Peter, and one other from the hostel
to have a private tour of the municipal theater in Santiago. It was
inaugurated in 1957 and is absolutely beautiful. It seems to be a
small theater without that many seats on the floor but there are three
or four balconies all with seating. The details of the walls,
balconies, ceiling, etc are all meticulous. Medallions between two of
the balconies honor the greats of music, theater and more. I saw
medallions for Beethoven, Verdi, Goethe, and even Cervantes. I can&apos;t
get away from Don Quixote if I tried.
After our tour, we stopped in the cafe in the theater building for hot
chocolate and muffins. We all split up after our tour. I went back
to Clinica Davila to get the results of my blood test nearly two weeks
earlier. Everything looks normal.
Then back at the hostel, I ate lunch of smoked salmon pat and/or
cheese on toast.
I still hadn&apos;t heard anything from the folks on Easter Island so I
tried calling them again with no luck. Then I had one of the workers
who has been helping bridge the language barrier help write an email.
I seem to be getting in the habit of napping. It worked again for me today.
Went back to the Chinese place for dinner. Even with three of us,
there were a lot of leftovers. It&apos;ll feed all of us tomorrow for one
meal.
Finally got word later in the evening that my charger, battery, and
adaptor will be sent back to Santiago on tomorrow evening&apos;s flight. I
just have to go to the airport to meet the person doing me this great
favor. Woohoo! 
Tuesday, June 9: Santiago

Knowing I would be getting my charger back this evening and therefore
be able to leave the city tomorrow, spurred me on to finally spend
time transcribing my Easter Island journal entries. So, I spent most
of the day doing just that. In the evening, I went to the airport to
pick up my charger. I got there very early so grabbed a sandwich at
Dunkin Donuts, the most affordable of the options at the airport. I
did check out Gatsby&apos;s Bar and Grill which had a great looking AYCE
buffet for about $16. If I was leaving from there sometime I could
plan on going but it wasn&apos;t going to work out this time.
It was finally time for the flight from Rapa Nui to come in so I stood
with all the taxi and limo drivers with their signs looking for
passengers that had arranged for transport. I had a sign of my own
with Erika&apos;s name on it, hoping she would remember to look for it
when she left the baggage claim area. No problem. She saw me
straight away and signaled which exit she was heading to. Thankfully,
the battery, charger, and adaptor were all together. It was really
nice of her to bring them back to Santiago for me.
They grabbed the same bus I was taking but since they were heading
straight for Valparaiso, they got off at the bus station while I
continued back into the city.
I ate the leftover Chinese for dinner and then thinking I would leave
my big backpack in Santiago while I went to Valparaiso for a few days,
I repacked my bags. I took some Excedrin to fight off an impending
migraine and went to sleep early. 
Wednesday, June 10: Santiago to Valparaiso

I woke up feeling much better. After breakfast, I finally took a look
at the map and realized that going back to Santiago when I was going
north after Valparaiso just didn&apos;t make sense. So I repacked again.
I killed time using the internet in the morning, ate the last of my
food stuffs for lunch and then walked to the metro which I took to the
bus station. As seems to be the usual case these days, I was falling
asleep on the bus even though I wanted to stay awake to see the
terrain. We went through two very long tunnels to get to Valparaiso
on the shore and there was a distinct change of vegetation at one
point. I could look back and see hills covered in cactus. At one
point, there was a cactus nursery.
In town, I took a local bus to the base of the hill I wanted to stay
on. From there, I took an &quot;ascensor&quot; or funicular. It was the
Acensor Cerro Concepcion, the oldest of 15 funiculars in Valparaiso
having been built in 1883. At the top, I continued my climb and found
a reasonable hostel and checked in. I was beat though so just hung
out there with the others for the rest of the afternoon. Went out to
dinner with Ewen, an Aussie at an all day breakfast place. Ordered
lasagna but they were out so we ended up eating quiche instead. It
came with soup, salad, and baked apple a la mode for less than $8
each. 
Thursday, June 11: Valparaiso

&quot;Breakfast&quot; of a single roll, two little cookies, and coffee or tea
was included in the hostel. Oh well. I had my roll with water and
supplemented it with a yogurt I had bought.
Spent the day with Ewen, touring Via del Mar. We climbed to the top
of the hill in the Parque Quinta Vergara only to be told by the
security guards there that it was very dangerous and we should go
down. We thanked him for his concern and continued on our own way.
It was a small park so didn&apos;t take long to finish our own tour. We
went down by way of a huge amphitheater in the park.
We had lunch at this great little Middle Eastern restaurant called
Jerusalem. I ate a small chicken shwarma sandwich with a piece of
falafel and a stuffed grape leaf on the side. I should had skipped
the shwarma and had more falafel.
Then we wandered to a nearby funicular. All the others in town were
labeled acensors. Why was this one labeled funicular? This one was
different. It only had one car rather than the two counterbalanced
cars I had seen on all the other funiculars I&apos;ve been to around the
world. Instead of a similar car counterbalancing this one, there was
a weight on a sled like mechanism that slid down between the tracks as
the car went up the hill. According to wikipedia, these are both
types of funiculars.
Then we wandered to the beach so Ewen could touch the other side of
the Pacific. We looked at some of the sand sculptures there.
I visited the museum and then we both caught the bus back to
Valparaiso. Ewen got off at the bus station. I kept going back to
the hostel.
We met there and then later, went to dinner at the Casino Royal J
Cruz. It had nothing to do with a casino. It was down this dark
alley that neither of us would have likely ever explored on our own
especially given the guy who started down the alley with us only to
use it as his own urinal. But, this place was listed in our guide
book and it sounded rather curious.
Sure enough, when we got to the door, even the door whispered of
something special. It was stained glass - sort of - but covered over
with a lot of stickers. When we went in, we couldn&apos;t believe our
eyes. The entire place, every wall, and even hanging from the
ceiling, was covered in a variety of collections and lots of writing
from visitors. The table cloths were completely scribbled upon. It
was a visual feast to accompany our dinner. When I asked about seeing
a menu, the man shook his head and just indicated we should sit down.
Turns out there was only one thing available here. it&apos;s called
Chorrillana. You just order for however many people there are in your
party. Then you also order your beverage. Chorrillana is a plate
piled high with french fries, sauteed onions, scrambled egg, and cubed
pork. It&apos;s served with the vinegary pepper sauce that I don&apos;t care
for and bread to sop up the last of the juices on the plate.
Chorrillana is available all over the place but there&apos;s no restaurant
with the character of J Cruz. It&apos;s also the type of food that makes
you feel your arteries clogging so I don&apos;t expect to order it very
much.
As for the decor, every wall was lines with glass cases to house the
collections. There were collections of African art, Chinese ivory,
pocket watches, beer steins, glass, porcelain shoes, and so much more.
Walked back by way of the supermarket and acensor. 
Friday, June 12: Valparaiso to Ovalle

I was supposed to have a tour of the area today by Hospitality Club
member with a number of good write-ups but it was cancelled after a
strange set of emails. For example, how was I supposed to know to
give out the hostel number so he wouldn&apos;t have to take 6 minutes to
send me an email? It never would have occurred to me to give out a
hostel number. Ah well...
Perhaps without the email exchange with him, I would have stayed
longer, but he put a bad taste in my mouth for Valparaiso so I just
wanted to leave. I got my stuff together and left it at the hostel so
I could go take a short harbor cruise. But with the weather being
cold and gray, there were no other takers and given that it was just a
collectivo, they wouldn&apos;t go without more people. I waited a while
and then gave up. So, I went back up - literally - to the hostel,
grabbed my backpack, and made my way back down the acensor for the
last time. Took the bus to the bus station only to find out the only
bus leaving that day would be at 7:30pm. Argh! I tried to figure out
how to hitch out of this town but gave up and spent the rest of the
day in internet cafes to kill time after putting my backpack in the
custodia - left luggage.
In one cafe down an alley, I could hear a marching band. I poked my
head out only to see the bottom half of a man on stilts walking by and
what looked like a four piece marching band. I never did figure out
what that was all about. I did take the time to book a bed in a hotel
in the town I was going to. It was the first time on this trip that
I&apos;ve booked ahead. But getting to a small town at 1:30 in the
morning, I didn&apos;t want to be ringing random hospedaje bells.
Dinner was a set meal of a burger, fries, and drink. My burger had a
choice of tomato, avocado, or mayonnaise.
Then I made it to the bus station, retrieved my backpack, and had time
to help someone start a sudoku before catching my bus. I got the
front seat which meant no foot room whatsoever but no worries about my
knees being crushed by the seat in front of me. I played musical
chairs with the empty rows in the back of the bus until it filled up
enough that I had to go back to my seat and put up with the cramped
conditions for the last few hours.
Once in town, the hotel that I had booked earlier in the day because
it was supposed to be close to the bus station wasn&apos;t anywhere near
the bus station but it was still a small enough place that I just
walked there. It was a bit overpriced and the bed had crumbs on the
cover and hairs on the pillow. But I was tired so I slept in my
clothes and decided to move on or to another place the next day.

Subject: 6/13-19: Ovalle to Vicua
Sorry for the delay in getting some journal entries out. My hard
drive is out of space and I&apos;ve been spending more time deleting crappy
pictures to make space for new pictures and less time transcribing
journal entries.
I&apos;m still behind and likely to get more so as I may have a few busy
days ahead with limited access, but here&apos;s what I have so far...
Mara - from Chaaral] 
Saturday, June 13: Ovalle

Visited the museum with great examples of pottery. I had seen similar
types in Santiago. Then I went to the plaza to stop at the
information booth cum jewelry vendor and got some good tips for
visiting Valle del Encanto, my destination for the rest of the day.
When asked, the guy there thought I could hitch so I did. It was
easy. 12km out of town I got dropped off for a 5km walk but I got
picked up there after walking maybe 1km. The guy who picked me up had
his kid with him and I thought he was also going to the Valle but he
wasn&apos;t. He just dropped me off and went back maybe a km to the pisco
grape vineyard where he works.
I was the first person to sign in to the register in three days. But
there was someone there to collect the 300 peso fee - about 50 cents.
He gave me a map and then pointed out the different areas from the
high point with the booth. I then walked into the valley.
There were quite a few petroglyphs (scratched in rock) to explore. As
the guy in the booth said, they looked like martians. The few
pictograph (painted on rock) sites were easy to find but hard to
decipher. I did find some of the painted markings but often I just
saw what looked like plain rock to me.
There were also interesting geological formations there, too. This
area was perhaps South America&apos;s answer to the Devil&apos;s Marbles of
Australia. There were also huge natural pots carved out of the rock
when a river once engulfed the area. Now, there&apos;s a small stream and
it&apos;s unclear if it ever floods. Looking around, I don&apos;t think it does
so these natural pots, now named the Bathroom of the Incas rarely see
any water any longer. The largest of these pots would be large enough
for me and five friends to climb into. But it would be awfully
difficult to climb out so I just took a picture and backtracked to the
picnic area, finding other places to explore along the way.
There were a lot of man made mortars there. Large flat rocks often
had many of these holes ground into their surfaces.
I was also surprised at the amount of wildlife I saw there. There was
a large European hare that almost ran me over. I saw a few small
rodent-like animals and when talking with a family picnicking there, I
realized they were chinchilla. There were quite a few birds in the
area as well. The ubiquitous Chimango were there but there were other
larger hawk-like birds there. Vultures. And smaller birds including
the red collared sparrow I&apos;ve been seeing since Ushuaia. There was
also a pigeon sized bird there with a startling red breast. I haven&apos;t
been able to figure out what it was yet.
The flora was dominated by one type of cactus and one type of leafy
bush. There were a few other plants there but none as prodigious as
these other two. The cactus had huge thorns that must have been as
long as 4 or 5 inches. I was very careful to avoid them. The long,
slender, red blossoms on these cactus kept many hummingbirds busy.
I had stopped at one point to have my own lunch near the family
picnicking and they gave me a mandarina (mandarin orange) and talked a
bit. Caroline and Marcos, an Ovalle police officer, were there with
their kids, picnicking and exploring. They ended up not only giving
me a ride back to town, but bringing me to their house so I could use
their internet and then brought me back to town. I stopped at the
info booth again to thank the guy there and then got another idea for
the next day so with a suggestion from this guy, I moved to a cheaper,
cleaner, nicer residencia. I went to the local supermarket cafe for
dinner, and went to sleep early.
This residencia gave me the second degree before allowing me in. They
didn&apos;t want anyone up late, making noise, checking out late, etc.
They were willing to hold my backpack if I didn&apos;t take it with me the
next day. This kind of place makes you feel rather unwelcome at first
and there&apos;s no way Lonely Planet or any other guide book could ever
include it in their pages.
But, it served my needs. 
Sunday, June 14: Ovalle to Pichasca

I got an early start but the bus never came so I ended up taking a
collectivo to Pichasca. Without knowing how far off the main drag it
was, I had agree to pay the driver extra to take me to the entrance
gate of the Monument Natural de Pichasca but just after we turned off
the main road, his phone rang. He wanted to drop me at the bus stop
rather than take me all the way and I wouldn&apos;t have to pay the extra.
Well, at the turnoff I had seen it was only 3km and he had easily
already taken me one of them so I agreed to walk.
I had hoped to find a business I could leave my backpack with but it
was only a residential area so I carried the backpack the one or two
kilometers up the hill to the entrance to the park. There, I was able
to leave my backpack and just take my daypack with food and water.
They gave me a map to borrow. I paid my entrance fee and went off to
explore this park starting with the little one room museum.
This park is known as the Jurassic park of the area. There are
dinosaur remains here, petrified wood, a cliff dwelling, and geologic
features that easily show a wide range of time periods. The museum
gave information about all of these elements of the park. I certainly
missed out on a lot with my limited Spanish, but I think they may have
missed out on describing the circumstances in which petrified wood is
formed. They did describe the replacement of natural materials with
those like silicon, but not that the silicon might be present
following a volcanic blast such as the one at Mt. St. Helens.
After the museum, I walked the 2km interpretive trail, saw the
petrified wood and the geological features that make the park unique.
I then visited the dinosaur site but the large plastic dinosaur there
in place of the bones seemed unnecessary to me.
The large cave dwelling would have looked right at home in Mesa Verde
or Gila though there were no interior walls like I&apos;ve seen elsewhere.
There were pictographs on the ceiling of the cave, however.
As far as I could tell, only three other cars came to the park the
entire time I was there. Maybe two of them went to see the cave
dwelling or more likely, the plastic dinosaur which didn&apos;t require
going down stairs. I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;m the only one who walked the
2km interpretive trail to see the petrified wood and the geologic
layers.
I walked the 3km back to the main road and got a ride to the nearby
eponymous town of Pichasca. I had hoped to get a ride to a hotel 30km
further up the road but the only traffic was local and the next bus
was going to come when it would be nearly dark. So, I checked into a
local residencia and only then found out that the first bud going past
Pichasca the next day wouldn&apos;t go until 2pm. I was trying to take a
very back road to Vicua and if I had to walk, I would have had to
start first thing in the morning. And it still would have taken me
two days to get there if I couldn&apos;t get a ride. But not being able to
get to the place to start the walk until late in the day, I gave up.
So, I spent the night in Pichasca, once again where nobody spoke
English, but still managed to communicate quite a bit with the lady of
the house and her sister who came by to visit. They were amused that
I was reading Don Quixote and were surprised that I only took two
weeks of Spanish. I don&apos;t think my language skills are all that great
but we did have quite a little bit of a conversation. I was beat
though and went to sleep very early. 
Monday, June 15: Pichasca to La Serena

Took the 8:15 bus back to Ovalle this morning after giving up on the
back road. The weather in Pichasca was great but as we descended down
into Ovalle, we moved into the fog and by the time we got to Ovalle,
it was trying to rain.
I took the opportunity of my return to Ovalle to get a couple more
tuna in packets. This is only the second time on this trip I&apos;ve seen
a supermarket with the option and they are so handy for travel.
Then got online and connected with a couchsurfing host who couldn&apos;t
offer me space but as an astronomer, was able to offer tips for more
observatories to visit. I had expected to visit at least two but it
looks like there may be more to visit and quite a few that are not
open to the public.
I grabbed the bus to La Serena and was glad when we drove out of the fog.
The first hostel I went to was being renovated but the owner noticed
me and came out to apologize. he suggested a friends place around the
block. It was one I was likely to try anyway. I got there and though
the place was great, the flowers there were sure to give me an allergy
attack and a migraine. So, I left my pack there, checked out a couple
of other places, and finally ended up at the place the second hostel
recommended. There are a lot of flowers in this town but fewer on the
cactus at Maria&apos;s Casa.
I brought my backpack here and settled in with a plate of fruit that
Maria offered. On it was a piece of banana, half an orange, and some
pepino. Now, I had learned pepino as cucumber but this was a
melon-like fruit called pepino. Unripe, it has a yellow skin. Ripe,
it&apos;s skin turns purple or streaked with purple and it&apos;s called
treemelon or mellowfruit. (I saw it in a supermarket a couple of days
later called pepino dulce (sweet) as opposed to pepino ensalada
(salad) for the cucumber.)
I&apos;m the only one in my room with two beds. We&apos;ll see if that lasts.
Outside my room is one of those welded found metal object sculptures
of none other then Don Quixote. Would I really see this many
references to him if I wasn&apos;t reading the book?
It&apos;s cold here and I&apos;m back in the land of the houses with a lot of
exterior rooms. My hands are freezing as I type this. There&apos;s a very
friendly, very furry, long-haired ginger cat that prowls the grounds
looking for unoccupied laps to jump onto, whether you&apos;re paying
attention or not. When he jumped onto my lap, I welcomed the lap
warmer and he didn&apos;t seem to mind that I wasn&apos;t actively petting him. 
Tuesday, June 16: La Serena

I spent a good portion of the day doing research into the many
observatories in the area. Many are closed to the public but some
allow visits, usually during the day on Saturdays. The tours are free
but they require you to have your own transport. By design, they are
up long roads with limited access. No buses go there. It&apos;s easy to
get permission to visit but paying for rental cars will be
prohibitively expensive if I can&apos;t find others to share the costs.
But I booked a tour of one nearby &quot;professional&quot; observatory for this
Saturday and they&apos;re holding five spaces for me in case I can find a
car full of people to rent a car with. I reserved a car in the
afternoon for Friday. I put up a sign in a nearby hostel that might
have others interested in going but I don&apos;t really expect to hear from
anyone until Thursday.
I joined some Aussie girls (does calling them girls show my age?) for
dinner at the Mall food court and we went to see &quot;Ghosts of
Girlfriends Past&quot; only we didn&apos;t really know that was the name until
we got into the theater and started watching the movie. The Spanish
translation had us thinking it was something else. It was at most
entertainment but mostly a really bad remake of a Christmas Carol. 
Wednesday, June 17: La Serena

I got details about Collowara Observatory and I don&apos;t need my own
transportation to get there so I made reservations for this evening,
packed my small pack for overnight, and planned to leave my large pack
at the hostel. I had hoped to get to Andocollo early to explore the
town but when I went to the bus station, I found there was only one
bus going later that afternoon. So having been told reservations were
unnecessary, I returned to the hostel only to find out that the
observatory tour had been cancelled already due to clouds. So, I
checked back in and just went back to the bed I had been in as it
hadn&apos;t been remade yet.
I had lunch at the supermarket cafe opposite the archeological museum.
 I had the lasagna and the pasta was mushy, just like the few times
I&apos;ve made pasta while in South America. Maybe it&apos;s the pasta and not
me.
The museum is very proud of the fact that its two mummies are much
older than the Egyptian mummies. They also have a moai from Easter
Island. It&apos;s a well traveled moai having spent years in France and
Spain before being brought to Chile.
Jerome from the Casa Roja hostel in Santiago showed up. He and a
couple others might be interested in the observatory tour on Saturday
but I doubt they want to stick around that long.
Supermarket visit for dinner stuffs, ate at the hostel, had another
night of the cat lap warmer. I&apos;m going to bed hoping to have another
good night&apos;s sleep. Last night had been the first full night&apos;s
uninterrupted sleep I had in weeks. 
Thursday, June 18: La Serena

Finally, a partially sunny day so I did laundry. Laundry service is
not offered at the hostel but Maria offered to do mine if I went out
and bought a tiny box of laundry detergent. I visited the Jumbo store
first only to realize they don&apos;t carry small boxes. I had to go to
the neighborhood kiosko to buy the overpriced tiny box Maria wanted.
Still it was cheaper than going to a laundromat.
I finally got to the beach this afternoon. There are a lot of shore
birds there. Here&apos;s a list, probably incomplete:
 White backed stilt Gray gull Kelp gull small plover like bird - got pictures for later ID Peruvian (most likely) pelican Southern lapwing pigeons

I got a bit bitten up maybe because the skirt didn&apos;t keep the bugs off.
Found a cheaper car rental place on the way back from the beach. Now
I&apos;ll go if just one other person wants to go. 
Friday, June 19: La Serena to Vicua

I woke up to find an email from the lady at the other hostel saying
there was someone there who wanted to join me for the Tololo
Observatory tour. Perfect. I stopped by the hostel but we couldn&apos;t
find the guy but we finally connected after 10am and confirmed our
spaces at the observatory, called to rent the car, and got on the list
for the evening observatory tour at Mamalluca.
Thomas and I then walked to the nearby university to get our permit to
visit Tololo. This is not a tourist observatory. The visiting hours
are only on Saturday during the day.
We connected at the car rental place that afternoon and had no
problems getting the car. Strangely, it didn&apos;t have a full tank of
gas so we just have to return it with 5/8.
We had a nice drive to get to Vicua where we checked into a hostel.
It was nearly sunset but we decided to drive as far as we could to
take in as much of the valley as we could. it got dark but we ended
up continuing all the way to Pisco Elqui in Elqui Valley. This area
is known for growing the Pisco grapes required for pisco and Pisco
Sours. Too bad we couldn&apos;t see anything. But we did stop for dinner
and hook up with a foursome at a place that makes pisco sours on the
spot rather than pouring them from a bottle.
Over the course of the day and evening, I found out that Thomas is a
mountaineer and also a Tango dancer. He does a bit of salsa but
that&apos;s about it. Upon our return to Viocua, we went out in search of
a pub so Thomas could get a beer, but instead followed our ears to the
Municipal Theater where we found a performance of folklorico music and
dance. It was very similar to the show I had seen on Chiloe but we
only caught the last part. Then we struck out when trying to find a
pub later on. We found them, but they weren&apos;t conducive to hanging
out and talking.
All day, it had been moderately exasperating talking with Thomas. I
would always have to repeat the first sentence of everything I said.
I wondered if he had a problem with his hearing and only when we
turned in did he mention it.
I would have to be the one to hear the alarm and get us both up in the
morning. No problem. 
Saturday, June 20: Vicua to La Serena

Thomas&apos; watch alarm went off repeatedly at 3:30am until I finally
figured out how to turn it off rather than snooze. I knew he didn&apos;t
use the alarm because he couldn&apos;t hear it so he wouldn&apos;t have been
able to figure it out and faster than me. But some noisy neighbors
had woken me up just before the alarm so I wasn&apos;t all that annoyed
with the alarm so much as the neighbors. I figured out how to reset
the alarm and turn it off over breakfast. Thomas had no idea and I
can only wonder how many people he&apos;s annoyed with his alarm going off
probably every night while he&apos;s been traveling.
We got to the observatory gate very early but so did others. I was
surprised how many others. I counted 39 people on the tour at one
point.
We caravanned to the summit along a dirt road. I left a lot of space
in front of my car in order to stay out of the dust from the car ahead
of mine so Thomas could use my camera and take pictures. He had
forgotten to recharge his batteries so was using my camera while I
drove. The drive up was spectacular and I joked how the drive was
worth the trouble to rent the car. As we reached the summit, there
was a small spotting type telescope that came in view just before the
parking lot, and I remarked to Thomas&apos; amusement, &quot;Oh look, a
telescope.&quot; Never mind the fact that we had been catching glimpses of
very large domes building all the way up the road that house huge
telescopes not to mention the numerous smaller domed buildings with
smaller telescopes here and there.
We toured the two largest telescopes including the 4.1 meter Blanco
telescope. It&apos;s an optical telescope with the ability to switch to
infrared on nights with too much moonlight. It was this telescope
that observed the 1987 supernova. Our guide was proud to describe how
the large telescope was anchored to bedrock, not the building, so that
the safest place to be in an earthquake would be under the telescope.
Hmm, I think I would rather be outdoors. It&apos;s a huge machine that
weighs in excess of 600 tons. The movable part is about half that and
is so well constructed that a 1/4hp motor is all it takes to rotate
the telescope to change the viewing angle.
I had taken the elevator up to see the telescope but then we started
smelling burning rubber and realized that it was the elevator so the
others had to walk up about 6 flights. Our guides were a bit out of
breath but managed to get the job done. We all had to walk down after
the elevator went out of service.
There was a lot of talk about the dark skies initiative. If you&apos;re
not familiar with it, check out darksky.org for more
information. Most people who live in urban areas and even suburban
areas can&apos;t see the Milky Way. Those of us who either live or manage
to spend good chunks of time in areas with dark skies know what
everyone else is missing. Apparently there are large chunks of Japan
where the only way to see the sky is online.
There is concern at the observatory that light pollution will get
worse. There&apos;s already some from La Serena and with Santiago growing,
there&apos;s concern that may become an issue, too. New observatories are
being built in the northern part of Chile precisely because the area
is remote and it&apos;ll take a lot longer for light pollution to catch up
with those areas but with growing tourism in northern Chile, there is
concern that the communities near those telescopes will also grow to
the point where light may become an issue even there.
At the end of our tour, we watched some of a Smithsonian Air and Space
Museum IMAX show (projected on a wall, not in an IMAX theater) of the
Cosmic Voyage, narrated my Morgan Freeman. I&apos;ll have to look it up
when I get home. We didn&apos;t get to see all of it.
We had to caravan on the way down the mountain but it was a bit looser
than on the way up and since we left basically last, we took our time.
 We weren&apos;t supposed to stop, but I did a few times to take pictures
from the windows. Plus, with one of the cars having a flat tire, I
knew we wouldn&apos;t be last so didn&apos;t rush. When we got to the bottom
and I wanted to explain to the guard where the other car was, I
figured out the international sound effect/mime for flat tire. I
pointed to my tire and then made the lovely noise of a fart. He got
the idea. I was able to tell him that they had a spare and were
changing the tire but they would obviously be delayed.
In town, we dropped off our stuff at our respective hostels and added
gas to the tank but we didn&apos;t know the gage was broken so we ended up
filing it even though it read less than 5/8 full. We returned the car
and complained about the gage. If he had apologized and mentioned
being sure to get the gage fixed right away, then we would have
swallowed the added expense but he didn&apos;t so we kept trying to get a
bit of satisfaction and a return of the extra 4000 pesos worth of gas
we had added to the car. He didn&apos;t want to budge so as I talked in
English with Thomas about how we were going to have to pay and since
they had my credit card info, we couldn&apos;t get away with only giving
him part of the cash. I grabbed my credit card imprint and we handed
the guy the cash that he told us we owed. We were surprised when he
gave us back enough to cover almost all of the extra gas we had paid.
I figured he understood a lot more English than he had let on.
In any case, we did get satisfaction from Santiago Car Rental and they
were the cheapest in town, but they would still be hard to recommend.
We had the broken gas gage and it was one of their trucks that had a
flat tire.
By the time we had finished returning the car, it was 4pm and we had
only had a small breakfast early in the morning. So walking down the
street, we went into the first restaurant we came to, Mistral. We
both ordered this strange item on the menu. It was marketed as
pancakes and the description said lasagna but the ingredient list
looked too good to forgo. Mine had salmon, tocino (prosciutto), and
mushrooms. Thomas&apos; chicken and other stuff. When it came, it was
three crepes layered with the ingredients listed above with gooey
cheese and cream. It was the most delicious meal I&apos;ve had on this
trip to date of all the original dishes I&apos;ve had. Come to think of
it, I think it might have been the most delicious of the entire trip
without condition. Of course, I could feel my arteries clogging as I
ate it.
I had a milk with strawberry smoothy - also delicious.
After walking back to the hostel, I realized something about that
dinner wasn&apos;t agreeing with me as it went right through me. But, I
would still get it again and contemplated staying another day just to
get it again.
The weather has generally been great though the high thin cirrus
clouds that do little to bock the sunlight prevent nighttime
stargazing so once again, the Collowara observatory canceled the
evening&apos;s tour. Argh! 
Sunday, June 21: La Serena

I spent a good part of the day deleting pictures from my full hard
drive. I&apos;ve still got 2.5 months of travel and need a lot more space.
 I should have bought another drive in Santiago. Not sure if I&apos;ll
have another opportunity.
The skies were cloudy this afternoon so I didn&apos;t book and observatory
tour only to have the skies clear and beautiful stars come out in the
evening. Argh! so much for winter in northern Chile. Feels strange
to be in &quot;northern&quot; Chile after spending so much time in southern
Chile.
Splurged on Philly Salmon Cream Cheese for lunch. Pancita has to do
for bagels. Food court Chinese for dinner with Oscar, a Spanish guy
heading to Easter Island soon. Internet was down today. Andreas
thinks it&apos;s my hard drive but I&apos;ve rebooted with and without it to no
affect. He rebooted and internet works again. Argh!
I&apos;ve been fighting bug bites that seem an awful lot like bedbugs but
they only started after I had been here a few days, on the day I put
clean clothes on to do laundry. Weird. I hope they are starting to
heal and I don&apos;t get new ones now.
Anyway, a day with a lot of frustration. 
Monday, June 22: La Serena to Copiapo

I took my time getting out this morning and caught the 10:30 Pullman
bus. I wish I had taken just a bit more time though. The bus broke
down and we sat there for 1.5 hours while they fixed it. Other buses
that left later passed us by. A few people got off to watch. Others
managed to flag down a passing bus or other transport. I finally got
off to document the broken down bus with a picture that will probably
look remarkably like a picture I took in the Australian outback when
my bus there broke down. Do other people have as many buses break
down on them when they travel?
I had just enough time when I got to town to make it to the tourist
office before they closed. I got a good map and some good information
about town, the surrounding area, and the area I was heading. A stop
at the mall for a bathroom and then I made my way to a residencial.
My room has a TV but it&apos;s only broadcast TV. Don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen
that before in Chile. Nothing in English so fairly useless to me.
I looked into the laundry place in case I cold get a load in tomorrow
morning but it&apos;s too slow and too expensive.
With nothing else to do, I spent two hours at an internet cafe and
made enough space to download my pictures from my camera. Now my hard
drive is full again.
Went to the mall for dinner to get try a local chain I&apos;ve been seeing
and have a place to stay warm while eating something that&apos;s not too
expensive. Not only are the houses half outside, but the businesses
usually keep their doors wide open regardless of the cold
temperatures. I haven&apos;t experienced winter in a few years, but I
have&apos;t been in reliable t-shirt weather either. I&apos;m tired of being
cold but don&apos;t see any chance to break the routine. Even as I head
north, I&apos;m going to be spending a lot of time at high elevation and in
desert. It may be warm in the sun during the day, but it&apos;s going to be
COLD at night. 
Tuesday, June 23: Copiapo to Chaaral

Not a good start today. I walked five blocks in the wrong direction.
Then once at the bus station, I remembered I needed to get to a cash
machine so back to the square I should have passed had I not gone the
wrong way. Another four blocks each way. Argh! Back at the bus
station, I realized that my ticket was for the bus that had already
left even though I told her the next bus when I bought it. No
problem. She changed it without a fuss.
Then things started going better.
We drove through beautiful desert that has less and less vegetation as
we go north. Caldera, the town, was a couple of kilometers off the
main drag. The bus dropped me off in town. I walked to the
waterfront which was quite nice. I wish I had more time but for once,
I&apos;ve given myself a time constraint. I want to be in San Pedro de
Atacama on the 29th for a festival.
So, I took pictures, found a place with a set lunch and had a very
hearty soup and then delicious fried fish with rice for about $4.
I ended up having to walk all the way to the other end of town to
start hitching. This time, I hitched a long-distance bus. They were
dropping someone off near where I was trying to hitch so I went over
and asked to get a ride for 15 kilometers. I was heading for a place
they didn&apos;t know about so they let me on and as we drove, I pulled out
what little information I had about the place. It was only 11km from
town so they soon dropped me off and wouldn&apos;t take payment. Sweet.
Just as I started walking down the side road, just 1km to the shore,
another car pulled up and offered me a ride. So, I put my pack in the
car and joined Carlos and Margarina with their small daughter Sofia
for the drive.
We were visiting Santuario de la Naturaleza Granito Orbicular, a site
with very unusual outcroppings of orbicular granite. See the Wikipedia entry for more information
about these granite rocks with leopard-like spots.
While at the site, I was about to hitch further up the road with a
truck driver that had also stopped at the site when my last hosts told
me they were going to Chaaral and they would be happy to have me
continue with them. Perfect. They were tourists and had planned to
stop at a couple of points along the way. We drove through the
amazing landscape with mountains and rocks that looked like Swiss
cheese. Many of these holes were huge. I have to wonder if there are
any full fledged caves in the area. Their planned stops turned into
non-stops when the communities they were planning on visiting turned
into non-communities. These were mainly collections of squatters
lodgings though I don&apos;t think the land was owned by anyone else.
I went my own way in Chaaral. It took a while to find a place to
stay. Places were either too expensive, full, or didn&apos;t answer the
door. I finally got some tourist information at the municipal office.
 Their map was horrible but good enough to serve my needs. They also
knew of one hostel, also good enough though a bit expensive.
I dropped my stuff and then climbed to the millennium tower and the
religious grotto with a statue of Mary which was just another hole in
the mountain turned into a religious site.
Back in town, I stopped at the hostel, met Shawn, and walked to the
store with him. We had dinner together back at the hostel and then I
went off for another internet cafe to delete pictures and copy my cards
onto the hard drive. In these small off the tourist track places, I
seem to always get my own room as they don&apos;t have dorm accommodations.
 Also, TV may be turning into the norm. 
Wednesday, June 24: Chaaral to Taltal

Saw Shawn at breakfast. I think I inspired him to hitch a bit. He
got out before me but I saw him on the main road before I found the
road I needed with two false starts to my hitching to Parque National
Pan de Azucar. When I finally got to my hitching spot, I had just
enough time to take pictures of town before my ride came. What luck,
they were two park employees heading to where I needed to go.
The drive along the coast there was beautiful. It&apos;s desolate with
less and less vegetation. There were areas with absolutely no plant
life and others with piles of cushion cactus that looked more like
piles of something a herd of horses would leave behind.
I left my backpack at the office and started on the 10km walk to the
Mirador. Wouldn&apos;t you know it, it was mostly a road walk. I had
almost finished the worst of the road walk when the rangers came by so
I hitched a ride with them for the last 5km to the mirador. There&apos;s a
spectacular view from there. There&apos;s an island in view with Humboldt
Penguins, seals, and sea lions. Had there been others in the park, I
would have taken the boat out to see them but it&apos;s prohibitively
expensive for one person.
As the rangers had dropped me at the summit, a curious fox (zorro)
came to greet us. I figured it was used to getting handouts from the
few visitors that make the trip up there. After the rangers left, I
was giving it plenty of room, but circling it to get some other
pictures and came within a meter or so of another fox that I would
have stepped on had it not moved away from me. I got more pictures of
both of them. Then went to see the rest of the views. When I decided
to stop and have something to eat, I moved away from the foxes and
found a rock with a view to sit on. But no sooner that I had opened
my bag and rustled a plastic bag, than the foxes showed up, not just
the two that I had seen earlier, but four of them. One of which was
extremely vocal, and barked a lot and squealed quite a bit, too.
They were very curious and kept crawling closer. They mostly stopped
at about 2 meters from me though one eventually ran out of patience
and tried to circle me to see if he could steal food from the other
side. He came within a meter of me and so I had to shoo him off. As
it was, I was extremely careful to keep my bag between my feet and the
rest of the food on my lap. Had I dropped anything, I&apos;m quite certain
it wouldn&apos;t have been mine any longer. But they were cute, they
listened well, and kept good company.
I had to walk all the way down but that gave me a chance to have a
fairly good close up encounter with a guanaco. I had seen it on my
way up the mountain, just as the rangers had arrived but it was nice
to have the opportunity to get pictures of one without it being
through dirty car glass going 60kph.
I retrieved my backpack and then sat by the road to wait for a hitch.
I had plenty of time for lunch number two. But then it wasn&apos;t long
before a ride came. It was a pickup with six guys in the cab and one
in the back. I joined the guy in the back where it was perfect for
taking pictures.
Back in town, I got dropped at Ruta 5, the Pan Americana highway and
started hitching north. It seemed to take forever but it was probably
only 45 minutes or so before a truck driver pulled over for me. I
had a few misgivings at first. He had me sit on the bed rather than
the other seat. Turns out he wasn&apos;t supposed to have others in the
truck and I had to be able to duck down should he pass another truck
from his company. In the 2.5 hours or so I was with him, I only had
to duck a few times.
He was also a flirt, but a harmless one. Actually, I&apos;m pretty sure he
would have backpedalled fast if I had responded to him at all, but I
didn&apos;t. Mostly, we listened to music.
By the time he dropped me off at the road to Taltal it was almost
dark. I still had 22 km to hitch. One taxi passed me. One car
passed me, but only because there was a bus behind it. I caught the
bus. This time, rather than get a free ride, they took me for a ride.
 I got charged rather a large fee for the ride but it was OK, I got to
town and overall, I&apos;m still way ahead if you look at the hitches from
a financial point of view.
In town, I wandered far to the expensive places only to find the cheap
place right near the plaza where I had been let off. Perfect. Dinner
was in my room at the hotel. They operated a restaurant and there was
no other common area to eat. Plus it was too cold to sit in the
beautiful plaza.
Then I wandered into town and following my ears, I found a group
practicing some music in a hall that had a photo exhibit of night sky
images from around the world. (I found out the next day that the
exhibit had ended the day I saw the pictures. I got lucky...) I
don&apos;t know if the place was technically open to the public at that
hour but they didn&apos;t mind my wandering around. An Internet session
and reading rounded out the evening. TV was broadcast only with no
English channels.

Subject: 6/25-29: Taltal to San Pedro de Atacama (including the Very Large Telescope)
Michael Jackson has been a big topic of conversation this past week,
especially when people find out I&apos;m from the United States. Most of
them however seem to have stronger feelings than I do. I&apos;ve never
heard Thriller get quite this much play time. For a couple of days,
it seemed to be playing everywhere I went.
Plus, the last couple of days I thought my allergies were acting up
but now I&apos;m wondering if I have a full fledged cold. We&apos;ll see what
happens over the next day or so. I just hope it doesn&apos;t turn into the
flu. I&apos;m planning on leaving the country for Peru in the next week or
so and don&apos;t want to be sick when trying to cross the border.
Oh yeah... I&apos;ve purposely left information out of my journal to
obfuscate information about the location of a threatened species.
During the week or so when I was traveling along quite a bit of
coastal Chile, I once had an opportunity to see Humbolt Penguins.
These penguins are most often viewed on islands by tourists from boats
but given that I&apos;m traveling in the low season and wouldn&apos;t have others
to share the expense with, the boats weren&apos;t an option for me.
At one point, a local who realized I had interest in birding, pointed
out some of the penguins along the shore - no boat required. He did
not want me to &quot;advertise&quot; the location in order to help protect the
fragile toehold this species has in the area so I agreed not to be
specific about the sighting.
Mara] 
Thursday, June 25: Taltal to Antofagasta

Up early and had breakfast in my room. Then I went in search of information.
The municipal office here tried to give me a large wall calendar and
book with information about the region but both were too large to
carry so I took a picture of the two relevant pages in the book and
left both the book and the calendar behind. Other than that, they had
very little information to offer but someone there pointed me to the
right road out of town - sort of. They took me along the scenic route
so I had to walk a bit further than had I taken the straight road to
the best hitching spot, but it was a nice walk along the coast for
part of the way. Once at the edge of town, I found a group of local
men also hitching. I made it clear that if my presence would hinder
their chances for a ride, I would move on but they insisted it
wouldn&apos;t be a problem. When we finally got a ride, they insisted I
get in the truck. I thought they waited for another truck and sort of
felt bad but then after a while, the truck stopped and the guys
climbed off the payload. They had just left the cab for me even
though one or more would have fit inside with me and the driver. The
driver had no use for conversation so we just listened to music.
It was a long ride and the driver left me off well above, literally,
town. But, right behind the truck was a pickup that gave me a ride
down to town. The first person I asked not only indicated that I
should be able to get a ride to El Mdano, but that she was going and
I should just wait with her for her ride. It was only after a while
that I realized she had been waiting for a couple of hours already.
It took maybe another hour before her ride left but at least I could
go with her.
When the driver heard where I wanted to go, he indicated it wouldn&apos;t
be a problem. It was only when they dropped me off in the middle of
nowhere that I realized the site wasn&apos;t near the community. Then they
said it was a three hour hike - each way - and difficult. They were
gone before I could truly assess my situation. I had camping gear but
not enough water for overnight. There was no water in the area. It
was also so late that I wouldn&apos;t be able to complete the hike in the
rest of the daylight and have time to view the pictographs in the
area.
I gave up but I still took some time to walk in towards the ravine to
get a better view and realized that the hanging valley seemed to
approach vertical. I turned back to the road and ate lunch while
waiting for a vehicle to come by that could give me a ride. One full
truck passed. It stopped but couldn&apos;t offer a ride. A couple of
vehicles going the other way stopped to make sure I wasn&apos;t any more
crazy than anyone else they would find in the middle of nowhere or in
distress which I wasn&apos;t. Finally, I got a ride with a young man in a
pickup, surprisingly devoid of other people.
He dropped me at the bottom of the hill. I made use of the portopotty
there for the construction workers and talked with the flag lady there
until she had to stop some traffic. That was my cue to get a ride to
the crossroads where I could find vehicles only going north. Right
after my first ride dropped me at the intersection, another pickup
came by and offered me a ride all the way to Antofagasta. Perfect.
As best I could figure, they were white collar workers associated with
a mining company that has operations in various parts of Chile.
Miguel spoke quite a bit of English. Juan not so much. We kept
company for a while, I shared some of the munchies I was carrying, and
we listened to music. They dropped me a few blocks from the plaza in
the center of town so I walked along a pedestrian zone to the plaza.
The tourist bureau had closed but the guard at the municipal building
dug up a map for me and I quickly found and checked into an el cheapo
hotel. I dumped my stuff.
For dinner, I found Spiedo Chicken and got some of the most delicious
rotisserie chicken I&apos;ve had, perhaps ever. It was perfectly cooked
and extremely moist. They have their operation down and seem to be
backing up maybe a hundred chickens at a time. They serve Chicken and
French Fries. Nothing else unless you get a beverage. too.
Spent my evening at an Internet cafe and then read Don Quixote before
going to sleep. This is a big city but not the kind of place where
I&apos;m likely to run into other travelers. There are no hostel-like
accommodations with dorms that would concentrate travelers like myself
in one place.
My shoulder is still bothering me though it&apos;s not getting worse. It&apos;s
hard to tell if it&apos;s getting better though. 
Friday, June 26: Antofagasta

I spent the morning getting information I would need while in town.
Then I changed hotels to one with a fairly flat bed instead of the
horribly concave one at the really cheap place.
Finally, after lunch, I went to the fish market where I wish I had
eaten lunch and grabbed a bus from the fish market to head out to the
airport, about 20km to the north. My goal was a monument on the other
side of the road from the airport and once I finally found the right
bus, I got there in good time. I&apos;ve been traveling north from
Antarctica since February and today, I crossed the Tropic of
Capricorn. There&apos;s a monument here delineating the imaginary line.The
monument is about 15m tall and is the green color of copper on a bed
of copper ore. Quite fitting given the large number of copper mines
in the area. This is the second monument to the tropic of Capricorn
I&apos;ve visited. The first was in the outback of Australia.
Then I hitched back towards town 8 kilometers and got dropped at the
turnoff for La Portada, a natural arch formation at the coast. It was
only a couple of kilometers from the turnoff so I wasn&apos;t hitching but
a truck stopped anyway, as I climbed in, we realized he was turning
off just down the road so maybe he saved me 10 minutes of walking.
But still, it was nice of him to stop.
The sea stack archway at the shore is famous in this region and is a
major tourist attraction from the town. Most people pull up, go to
the railing, snap pictures from there, and leave. But there&apos;s so much
more here. I visited the office which had some informative displays
outside but the office wasn&apos;t geared for visitors. I wandered the
cliff area a bit more and was about to head down some of the stairs to
the beach when the man from the office, Marcelo, caught up with me.
He ended up telling me a lot about the birds of the area and even lent
me his binoculars so I could get a better look at the birds.
We walked down eh stairs to the beach, maybe 40m below, and then
walked along the beach together. We saw one dead pelican and other
dead chick of a vulnerable species. We saw a Christo-esque art
project underway where panels smoked black are being hung from the
cliffs about at intervals depicting 100 years of sedimentary layers.
we walked through two arches or tunnels to go further along the beach
to the point opposite the archway. There, we saw a seal that was
apparently in some distress. It only acknowledged us when we got a
lot closer than it should have allowed us to get. There&apos;s a chance it
was hypothermic according to the expert Marcelo was talking with.
Since it didn&apos;t seem in immediate danger, they would leave it
overnight and see if it was still there in the morning before taking
any more proactive action.
After a while, I left Marcelo on the beach and went back up to the top
of the cliff. I caught a ride back to town with a couple I had met on
the beach. They dropped me right at the plaza.
I finally got confirmation from Paranal Observatory that I could
attend the tour session tomorrow so I printed out the release form to
give tot he guard at the gate once I got there.
More chicken for dinner. More internet. More Don Quixote.
Being off the typical tourist track means there&apos;s nobody to socialize
with at hostels so at least I know how to kill time on line. 
Saturday, June 27: Antofagasta

With permission to visit the VLT (Very Large Telescope) at Cerro
Paranal but no transportation, I got up and out by 8am even though it
was only a 2-2.5 hour ride to the observatory and I didn&apos;t need to be
there until 1:30. Having passed the access road to the observatory on
Thursday, I knew exactly where I was going but wasn&apos;t at all sure how
quickly I could hitch. I started with a city bus to get to the road
to La Negra, the community on the Pan American highway. This was the
only place I ended up using my sign. I had made one for La Negra and
it took only 5-10 minutes for a truck to stop. Unfortunately, he was
going north but could at least get me to the Pan American Highway.
He dropped me at a gas station just before the police checkpoint on
the highway. There was a pulloff there so I started hitching in sight
of the checkpoint. Mostly, I just wanted to get to the observatory
and I didn&apos;t care how so when a bus pulled up a few minutes later, it
was worth it to me to pay for the ride. They wanted 1000 pesos to the
&quot;cruces&quot; or crossroad for Paposo. What a deal! But as we went along,
I looked at my watch and realized I had gotten out of the city so
quickly and had so much time to kill, that I actually had time for a
detour. I asked if I could get a ride all the way to the Mano del
Desierto, the Hand of the Desert. It is a huge concrete sculpture of
a hand reaching out of the desert and was maybe 20-25 minutes past my
turnoff. They agreed but it would cost me all of 2000 pesos instead
of 1000. No problem.
So they dropped me off at the Hand which is truly in the middle of
nowhere. There aren&apos;t any other signs of humanity other than the
highway near the hand. The bus driver and helper did give me a
skeptical look and a raised eyebrow to make sure I really wanted to
get off there, but I was sure I could get a ride on the highway
without a problem.
So, I walked the few hundred meters off the highway to visit the huge
hand. As I walked up, the two cars that had been visiting the hand
left the area waving to me as they went. I thought that was a good
sign and maybe others would pull up and I could just ask for a ride
rather than thumb. So, I took my time and took all the requisite
pictures with me in front of the hand, with the sign, and more.
Nobody turned in while I was there so I walked back to the road
expecting a quick ride. I was surprised when truck after truck passed
by without stopping. A couple of cars also passed by. There were
always cars or trucks in sight from one direction or another but I
still waited a half and hour or so before a truck driver picked me up.
He took me halfway back to where I started and also expressed
skepticism when I told him where to let me off. There were no signs
for the observatory facing the south. So, after he left me in the
middle of nowhere again with only the intersection in sight, I walked
along the highway to check the signs facing the other direction.
There were quite a few and I had to walk a half a kilometer or so to
the last one (from the south) to find one that referenced the
Observatory and make sure I was in the right place. I was. Phew!
I then had to walk back to the intersection to start hitching the last
of the public roads to the observatory. I was hoping to walk down a
ways to get out of easy sight of the highway so I could take a pee
somewhere. I wasn&apos;t meant to be. Before I got far, a car came along
and gave me a ride. It was a family in a pickup with the mother
riding in the back with the toddler. I got the front seat again.
Sweet.
This family was going to Paposo but didn&apos;t seem at all surprised to
let me off at the turnoff for the observatory.
Finally, I was on a road with even less traffic. I could see far in
both directions so quickly found a place out of sight and peed. No
sooner had I gotten back to the road did a pickup come by heading for
the observatory. They offered me a ride and before I accepted, I
asked if it would be a problem to arrive for the tour hours early.
They indicated no problem so I climbed in with the four of them. I
knew they had to work there so I asked what they did. The guy I was
talking with spoke excellent English which was no surprise given that
scientists from all over the world visit and work there.
Wouldn&apos;t you know, they were the tour guides. LOL. They dropped me
at the guard house where I would have to wait. It was only 11:30 but
I was hungry so I ate my second breakfast or was it my first lunch.
Then I took some pictures from that area. Finally, having forgotten
to use sunscreen, I told the guard I was going to look for shade and
he invited me in to a waiting room of a sort with a couch and a
bathroom. It was quite nice and fairly comfortable. So, I waited
there until others started showing up shortly after 1pm. I handed in
my paperwork and got my visitor&apos;s name tag.
I started talking with a family, a couple in their thirties and their
daughter 10 +/-, who were also there for the tour. It didn&apos;t take
long but they soon offered to shuttle me around the site as we would
have to drive to the summit and then they would be happy to take me
back to Antofagasta afterwards. Perfect! Now I could enjoy the rest
of the day without having to worry about how or when I was going to
get back to town.
In total, there were at least 15 people and maybe as many as twenty on
the tour. Most were Chilenos but there was one group of six from
Germany and Poland and another German with a Chileno friend. I was
the only native English speaker but the Germans also preferred
English. The Polish guy spoke excellent Spanish though and could
translate if necessary.
We started the tour at the Visitor&apos;s Center. They showed a video
there but it was only in Spanish so they recommended the English
speakers look at the displays which were in both English and Spanish.
They didn&apos;t really give the Spanish speakers time to read the displays
so it all worked out.
Then we piled into the cars for the drive to the summit. The tour was
split into language groups. Even though Paranal Observatory was built
by a European Alliance with Germany playing a primary role, and there
were a large bunch of Germans on the tour, our tour was in English.
We visited just one of the four large telescopes. These each have an
8.2m reflector which would dwarf the 4.1m reflector I had seen last
week at Tololo. This one is used for optical viewing and also has
both infrared and ultraviolet instrumentation, useful for when the
moon is too bright for optical viewing.
These four telescopes can be used independently or in concert using
interferometry. I could draw parallels between this VLT and the VLA
(Very Large Array, a humongous radio telescope in New Mexico) in that
together, they can see a lot more about one object than when used
individually.
Also on the summit, are four 1.8m telescopes. They look like huge
gold balls on white pedestals. These telescopes are on tracks and can
be moved into different configurations, kind of like the radio
telescopes of the VLA.
We visited the control room. Each of the four large telescopes has
its own area with its own set of control computers for the actual
telescopes and other computers for the scientists to use to analyze
the images and data they collect. I noticed there were quite a few
keyboards that had two large monitors.
Even though it was Saturday during the day, there were still quite a
few people working there. We saw one looking at an image with a lot
of galaxies. Most of the others were looking at a lot of numbers or
other representations of the data they were observing. There was also
one group that seemed to be laughing and having a good time. That
went right along with all the humorous comic strips and other drawings
sprinkled on the walls which were well integrated with the more
technical and professional postings.
We piled back into the cars to return to the living area below. We
visited the hotel where the visiting scientists stay. It&apos;s mostly
subterranean with a dome that looks deceptively small from the
outside. Inside, you see exactly how large the dome is. It covers a
large arboretum filled with the only green living plants in miles.
There was also a blue pool below but it was unclear if that was for
show or swimming. We weren&apos;t permitted beyond the access hall but
that was interesting enough. It was lined with a nice selection of
photographs. Some were of the stars and by the same photographer that
was featured at the exhibit I saw in Taltal, Stphane Guisard . Others were by other
photographers and covered a side variety of topics. There were under
water images including a skin diver sitting on a sunken toilet.
Others were from places I had visited in Southeast Asia. There was
one recursive picture taken of itself and the picture next to it on
that display wall (recursed twice more). I took another pictures of
the two of them.
There was one picture of uniformly green hills that seemed nice enough
but not particularly special until you read the caption. Only the
English speakers really got it. It read &quot;Paranal Dreams
(Nightmares!)&quot;. We got a good laugh at that having just been told how
important the dry air in the area was as good as it gets for optical
observing on the planet.
Speaking of which, the observatory site is cloudless for 350 days a
year. That said, you can look down to the ocean and see a sea of
clouds. But they stay far below and never make it to the mountains.
It&apos;s so clear up here you can see distant mountains quite easily but
when asked, our tour guide had no idea how far the visibility actually
extended.
One of the reasons why the hotel is included on the tour is that it
was used in the James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace. They even left
behind a prop in the form of a large boulder. We had fun moving the
seemingly large and heavy rock around quite easily.
The return to Antofagasta had a surprising amount of conversation. I
feel like I don&apos;t speak all that much Spanish but we talked for most
of the trip and eventually just listened to music though that would
spark conversation every now and then. There was a lot of music in
English, some bad Spanish covers of English songs, and one very good
cover of Total Eclipse of the Heart in Spanish. I couldn&apos;t understand
the words to know how accurate the translation was, but the tone,
voice, and instrumentation seemed to be right on.
Back in town, they dropped me at the plaza, just a couple of blocks
from my hotel. I checked out the local MallPlaza mall and ended up
having a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza for dinner. Unlike the ones I
had in Guatemala, this one was the same small US size pizza. But it
was only 690 pesos, maybe $1.40.
A supermarket empanada while I shopped for breakfast food rounded out
dinner. Then internet stop and reading before bed. 
Sunday, June 28: Antofagasta to San Pedro de Atacama

Caught the bus to baquedano this morning. Was surprised how small the
tired dusty town was. I just wanted to visit the museum there but
after three false starts with people giving me completely wrong
directions, I finally took a chance and left my backpack inside one of
the little kioskos there and tried again. This time, it took two
tried before the directions from the fifth guy pointed me in the right
direction and found the museum, such as it is.
The museum here is an old railroad roundhouse and turntable. There
are about four antique engines sitting forever idle and the turntable
bridge is bent so that even if it did turn again, the tracks wouldn&apos;t
be able to guide the train cars any longer.
It was completely deserted. There was nobody there to take any fees.
You just wandered around. There were active tracks nearby with car
after car of explosives. This turntable and roundhouse were also
featured in the last James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace.
Historically, this entire area was used for saltpeter (potassium
nitrate) production and that drove the economy of the area. This
railroad and many surrounding towns owed their existence to the
mineral but when demand faltered, they fell on hard times. There are
many ghosts towns in the area and ruins dot the landscape as I move
along the roads in the area.
Copper mining now sustains what&apos;s left of the area and the railroad
tracks are in use to support the mining efforts.
But this speed bump along the road is a common stopping point for many
trucks and long-distance drivers. In the roadside pull-off were two
extremely large flatbed trucks each hauling a humongous new
Caterpillar frontloader. The frontloaders were each much wider than
the trucks they were sitting on, the wheels themselves much taller
than the truck and the front shovel positively immense. It would be
amazing to see them in action.
From this parking lot, I hitched a ride 33km down the road to the next
crossroads hoping to hitch the rest of the way to Calama but being in
a mood to get there, I took the first thing that stopped - a bus. I
ended up having the entire upper deck to myself and had no idea if I
was paying or not. In Calama, they dropped me at the bus terminal
where I did end up paying for my ride (shucks) and then paid for
another bus to take me to San Pedro de Atacama. I had just enough
time to grab some chicken and fries but they were disappointingly dry
after the wonderfully juicy chicken from Speido Pollo in Antofagasta.
When I got to town, I wandered through the tunnel like covered
artisans alley to the main plaza. As I arrived, I heard some very
familiar music. The first of the murgas was coming through. I had
aimed to get to San Pedro today for the eponymous festival tomorrow
but some of the festivities were happening the day before and I got
here just in time.
I dropped my pack and watched the first group come through and then
made my way to a hostel. The places in this town are more expensive
than other areas. Even though it&apos;s a small town, I&apos;m in culture
shock. Once again, I&apos;m in a mainstream tourist destination and I hear
English and languages other than Spanish being spoken on the street.
So, I paid a bit more than I prefer but at least I found a place.
It&apos;s really nice and though there are bunk beds in my room, I&apos;m in a
single. There&apos;s a heated common room with TV, internet access, and a
large kitchen. In this high desert, that heat is going to be nice in
the evenings. There are also lockers that include keys and towels for
the asking.
Back in town, I watched more of the festivities near the church with
costumed gauchos, matadors, and a bull.
Thomas, from La Serena, found me on the street and we went to get
something to eat. I had dessert, he had a huge calzone-like empanada.
 My dessert was two crepes filed with manjar (dulce de leche). 
Monday, June 29: San Pedro de Atacama

It was freezing in my room when I went to sleep last night only to
realize the window had been left open. I closed the window and some
hours later, it had warmed up in the room, possibly with the help of
the warmth of the two other people also sleeping in the room. They
came in late but left early. The Geyser tour leaves at 4am. I&apos;m
likely to take it one of these days.
With nothing specific to do in town in the morning, I spent the time
on the computer deleting pictures. This isn&apos;t really how I want to
spend my time traveling, but at least it&apos;s going to save me a lot of
trouble when I get home. Even then, I&apos;m going to have to go through
this process a few more times to weed the sheer number of my pictures
down to something manageable. I finally managed to squeeze my full
two gigabyte card onto the drive.
Today is a festival here in honor of San Pedro y Pablo. Given the
town is named after San Pedro, it&apos;s a very special day here in town
with a lot of festivities. I made it to town just in time for the end
of the religious ceremony that happened in the square rather than in
the church. That set off the parade. I got to see many of the parade
participants as they set off but then made my way to the end point of
the parade and got to see all of them when they comes through there.
The costumes ranged from the fantastic rainbow colors with feathers,
and fringe to what I would say looked typically Peruvian.
We are very close to Bolivia and Peru here so it hasn&apos;t been a big
surprise to see the people here starting to have more and more of what
I would call are Peruvian features. Plus, this part of northern Chile
used to be part of Bolivia until the Chileans won it during the War of
the Pacific in the 1800s.
The parading groups were similar to the murgas I had seen in Buenos
Aires. Bands playing music and troupes of people in costume dancing.
But here, they weren&apos;t quite as athletic and for some troupes, the
steps took on obviously different meanings. Some of then mostly
walked or had very simple steps. They frequently walked backwards to
honor the religious heads of the ceremony who were coming up the road
behind them. Some troupes had two leaders who wore Rhea skins
complete with legs hanging down their backs and head and neck hanging
down their fronts. Seeing me taking pictures, one came up and shoved
the head into my face. I tried to take a pictures but think it came
our blurry. He was saying something about pajarito that everyone
laughed at. Since a pajaro is a bird and a pajarito is a little bird,
and a rhea is by no means little, I can only imagine.
Food in this town is expensive so I&apos;ve been frequenting the empanada
places rather than eat in restaurants too much. Empanadas were
perfect for eating while waiting along the road for the parade to come
through.
After the parade, I took a nap and got dressed in my newly and
expensively cleaned clothes. Since last week&apos;s episode with the
potential bed bugs, I&apos;ve been looking for a place where I could get
all of my clothes cleaned, even the ones that were clean or haven&apos;t
been worn in ages.
In the evening, I went on a sky tour. There&apos;s a French astronomer
living just outside of town who hosts daily night sky tours. He&apos;s got
a huge setup with about nine telescopes for the viewing public. He
starts off by giving a pretty good history of the how people have come
to understand the night sky over the ages. He also knows how to keep
is interesting and informative while quite humorous. Then, we
ventured outside to do some naked eye viewing and to get a better
understanding from there. It was this point that went on way too long
for me. He probably spent and extra 20-30 minutes explaining how to
make observing interesting to a potential romantic partner rather than
making it completely geeky. But the reality was that I already knew
how to read a star chart, was more interested in learning the objects
visible in the southern skies, and really wanted to get at the
telescopes. I can read a star chart on my own once I have a dark
place.
He also explained how bright stars can be further than less bright
stars, the earth&apos;s rotation and how it affects the sky through the
seasons, and how our position on the earth affects our view of the
night skies. This was nothing new to me but good for the potential
newbies in the group.
The largest of his telescopes for the viewing public is 60cm. He also
schedules his tours around real astronomical events. Tomorrow, he
needs to be viewing at 7:45 so the tour won&apos;t start until 8pm. Mine
started at 7pm.
We started with the obvious and moved on to the more esoteric. Some
of the objects we viewed included: the moon, the Milky Way, Saturn,
Vega, Alpha Centuri, a nebula, a globular cluster of stars, Jewel Box
(a constellation with three different colored stars in the middle, the
Butterfly, and more.
I was finally able to pull out my star chart that I had gotten art
Observatorio Tololo and ID some constellations other than the obvious
Southern Cross. I think Alaine, our guide, was amused that I had a
chart and a red light.
It was when he was taking pictures with my camera that he confirmed
something I had been wondering about... The image on the screen often
does not reflect the reality of the pictures I&apos;m taking. There&apos;s
something wrong. But, since, I use automatic mode most of the time, I
just look at the pictures after the fact and they still come out
correctly.
Thomas was on this tour as well as Bernd, the guy I had me on Easter
Island who I had taken a picture of while he was riding a bicycle in
front of my jeep.
Back at the hostel, I watched most of Kingdom of Heaven, a rather
gruesome movie about the crusades in Jerusalem. 
Tuesday, June 30: San Pedro de Atacama

I spent the morning on the computer, deleting pictures and copying my
SD cards to my hard drive. Then I went to town to get cash from the
ATM and book a few tours. There are now three ATMS in town. Two take
only the MasterCard family. The other takes both MasterCard and Visa.
Unfortunately, with the long holiday weekend, all were out of cash
for a while. And today, the Visa machine was still out of cash. You
would think that with this being an ongoing problem, one bank would
get smart and figure out that maybe it would be worth their while to
add another machine or two.
Luckily, the tour agencies seem to be used to the problem and they
allowed me to book the tours and start my tours before paying for
them. They know I&apos;ll be in town for a few days and if worst comes to
worst, I can always pay with a credit card or change some of my US
dollars at the change booths but both give horrible rates so I prefer
to get cash at the ATMs and pay for the tour in cash. You get a
significant discount when paying in cash, too. 47,000 is the going
rate for all three tours but I&apos;ll get the package for 40,000 (45,000
to pay with a credit card).
I&apos;m running so low on cash that restaurants are out of the question.
I&apos;ve put the money I&apos;ll need for the entrance fees aside and will
stick with empanadas and other minimarket (there are no supermarkets)
food until I can get more cash.
I ate my leftover ham and bread sandwich from last night for lunch
today. Then I tried to take a much needed nap but only slept for a
few minutes.
I met my tour at 3pm at the agency. We spent the rest of the
afternoon touring natural sculptures such as the three nuns, an
abandoned and very small salt mine, and visited an overlook with an
overhanging rock that&apos;ll be right at home with the other pictures of
myself that I have sitting over high cliffs. Of the 10-15 people on
our tour, only three of us ventured out to the edge of the cliff for
that picture. None would have if I hadn&apos;t seen the possibilities. We
also visited Death Valley and the Valley of the Moon. These
formations are comprised of sedimentary layers of clay, sand, and salt
have been sculpted by many years of wind and occasional rain. The
changing angle of the sun gives them changing appearances as we watch.
We climbed a dune and walked along a ridge before sunset. The view
was good but only got better after the sun had actually set. I was a
bit surprised at that. I had more fun with my camera taking almost
daytime looking shots once it started to get dark. Long exposures
with the light of a quarter moon came out surprisingly bright. My
favorite shot of the day may have been in the afternoon. We walked
through a cut in the rock to view Death Valley and I got a picture of
the moon in full daylight with the upper edge of the cliff near it.
You can see all the features of the moon quite easily.
Back in town, Daniela, the other woman on the tour who sat on the
cliff&apos;s edge, and I went to see if the bank machine had been filled.
It hadn&apos;t. Then knowing I was low on cash, Daniela took our guide and
myself out for a drink. We whiled away a couple of hours there,
taking a break at one point when someone came in who knew we were
looking for cash and told us the machine had been filled. I went
first and got the cash I would need to pay for my time in town. I
bought a few munchies for the next couple of tours on the way back to
the restaurant. Then Daniela took a turn going to the cash machine.
It&apos;ll be a little nicer to relax in town now that I know I&apos;ve got some
cash at hand.
After a couple of hours, I left them at the restaurant to go get some
much needed sleep.

Wednesday, July 1: San Pedro de Atacama

After two nights of having my sleep disrupted at 4am, I woke up this
morning around 4am even though nobody else was moving about the room.
I tossed and turned for a while and then decided to try to take a
shower but the water never got warm. I found out later some of the
hoses had frozen overnight. I crawled back into bed and managed to
get some sleep until my alarm woke me at 7am. I found the table set
for breakfast. I had expected to just grab a bowl of cereal from the
cupboard so that was nice.
My bus came at 8. There were just five of us including Daniela on the
tour to the Altiplano. We stopped at one town, Jeres, in a valley
with a river to see all the green trees and the old irrigation system
they were using. We visited a cave dwelling and saw where tuff, the
lightweight volcanic rock used for the light colored houses in the
area is harvested.
Our next stop was at the Laguna de Chaxa in a huge salt flat. This
salt flat was unlike others I&apos;ve seen in other parts of the world. It
was a jumble of sharp grey rocks. We stopped there to see the
flamingos. On the way in, they had an aquarium with the brine shrimp
on display so we could understand what the flamingos eat.
However, when I saw the shrimp, I thought of something else, too. When
I was growing up, all the comic books had ads for tiny and mysterious sea monkeys . These brine shrimp are the
sea monkeys or very similar to them. It was kind of amusing to
contemplate these sea monkeys as flamingo food.
I was also interested in the other birds of the area and was happy to
see a display that showed pictures, with the Spanish names and English
names of the birds. Hopefully I can match up the display pictures
with the pictures of the real birds I took. I did have some
difficulty here at the laguna. Right as we got here, I got a bloody
nose. And it was a good one so for my entire time here, I had to walk
around with one hand holding a tissue to my nose while I used my other
to take pictures.
Thankfully, by the time I got to the bathroom on the way out of the
area, my bloody nose had basically stopped. But as I was cleaning up
after one, the other nostril started. This one wasn&apos;t all that bad
though and I was soon able to get everything under control and our
tour continued.
Next, our vehicle climbed nearly 2000m to the Altiplano at 4300m. As
we went up, I was surprised to see more and more vegetation. The snow
that accumulates on the peaks around us slowly melts and provides
limited moisture for the plant life in the area. Our next stop was at
the twin lagoons of Miscanty and Miiques.
The mountain peaks near us had bits of snow in the crevices. The
lagoons were beautiful blue ringed with white salt and this against
the reddish color of the hills and the yellow of the local grasses.
We got out to take a look and were able to walk down the hill and then
across to the other lagoon. We didn&apos;t have time to take the walkway
down to the water&apos;s edge but could only see the wildlife from afar.
There were flamingos there, Andean gulls, ducks, and kati (sp?). As
we walked along, a fox wandered past us, just a couple of meters off
the road we were walking on. It ignored us completely but took great
interest in the pickup truck coming along behind us. When the truck
stopped, it went to maybe within a meter of the truck. It was clearly
used to getting handouts from people in small vehicles. We could also
see a few herds of vicua in the vicinity.
At the second lake, there were more flamingos and there were vicua at
the waters edge drinking the salty water.
We started back and stopped in Socaire for lunch. Our vegetable soup
had quinoa and potatoes in it and I think the bread we had may have
been made with it as well. The only thing missing from the three
traditional foods originally grown in the long disused terraced fields
we had been passing were corn.
We had roast chicken, rice, and potatoes with frozen carrots and peas
in mayonnaise served warm.
Our last stop was in Toconao to see the bell tower and grass roofed
adobe church.
I was pointing out herds of vicua as we drove along. And I spotted
another fox, too.
Back in town, I finally paid for my tours and then went back to my
hostel to clear out some of the directories that I now know I had
backed up before I left Boston. I started with the big ones and
immediately cleared out 12gb of space. I immediately filled 3gb with
the pictures from my SD cards. I&apos;ve got more to clear out when
necessary, too, but it&apos;s going to be hard to find other large chunks
of memory to clear up.
Had a fried empanada for dinner filled with chicken, cheese, mushroom,
and onions. It was delicious. Socialized at the hostel with a good
group of people.
I finally had a chance to look at the skin on the backs of my knees.
They have been bothering me for a couple of days. Sure enough, it&apos;s
the same lizard skin I had in New Mexico when I was hiking on the
Continental Divide Trail with Jim and Ginny. So, I immediately put
the same cream on it. Funny, I think the tube of cream I&apos;m using is
the one I had bought in New Mexico. I just hope this goes away soon.
This time, I&apos;ve been doing almost no walking around and I&apos;ve always
been wearing long pants rather than shorts which exposed my legs to
the sun. 
Thursday, July 2: San Pedro de Atacama

After yet another bad night&apos;s sleep, I got up at 3:30 in the morning
and got dressed in almost every last stitch of clothing I have with
me. I wore my tights, my tight shorts, my pants, and my overpants
along with the socks I used in Antarctica. For my top, I had a
t-shirt, two long-sleeved shirts, my fleece sweater, my filled jacket,
and my rain jacket. I also had gloves, mittens, and overmitts, a hat,
and the hood from my jacket.
It&apos;s cold in the desert at night and my tour picked me up at 4 to go
to the El Tatio Geysers , like
the Altiplano, at 4300m, 2000m higher than San Pedro. By the time we
got there two hours later, it was -18c or about 0 Fahrenheit. Along
the way, I was probably the only person who even tried to look outside
and I enjoyed the stars until the windows eventually started fogging
up. Then I closed the curtain over my window but was sitting where I
could see out the front window. I saw a meteor streaking across the
sky at one point and the headlights made the terrain look very
interesting. I was going to want to take it all in on the way back to
San Pedro.
The geyser field was much bigger than I had expected. I thought there
would be one large geyser and then a few smaller ones and fumaroles
here and there. But there were geysers spread out all over the
place. Admittedly, it was difficult to tell where the geyser stopped
and the steam continued. In the predawn light, leading to sunrise and
increasing sun, the changing angles of the sun made the geysers take
on different character from minute to minute. We took a break for
breakfast at one point. Our hard boiled eggs had been cooked over a
fumarole and our hot chocolate and hot milk for coffee had also been
heated over the fumaroles.
Once again, I was reminded that we weren&apos;t in the liability shy US any
longer. The only safety features of this part of the geyser field I
saw were a few holes with a circle of rocks around them. We went to
another part of the geyser field which was somewhat more protected -
probably protecting the geysers from the people rather than the people
from the geysers. This area had three very tall geysers. It also had
a thermal pool where we were allowed to go into if we wanted. It was
still well below freezing outside so I was satisfied to touch the
water to feel its warmth. In our group, I don&apos;t think anyone put more
than a hand in. Other groups had people sticking their feet in and a
few brave souls went all the way in. We were also snowed on by
crystals that froze from the steam that had gone up. They were
beautiful to see in the sunlight. The other geysers were much too hot
to try to touch.
The down side was a piece of machinery left over from a previously
failed attempt to use the field for geothermal energy. Unfortunately,
the Chilean government apparently didn&apos;t learn from its past and has
already approved another attempt to build a geothermal plant there
that will eliminate the field as a tourist attraction. There&apos;s a
great deal of local opposition to the plan.
On the way back to San Pedro, we stopped a number of times to view
local wildlife. We saw vicua, llamas (OK, not so wild), vizcacha, a
rabbit-like animal with a longer tail and stripe down its back, and
andu, rhea.
We stopped in another town with interesting grass roofed houses and
had an opportunity to try llama asado, grilled llama. So I bought a
skewer. It was pretty good but not particularly all that different
from beef. I also bought a cheese empanada there.
Back in town, I was so exhausted after not sleeping well for most of
the week, regardless of the fact that the bed there was great. I just
hung out in the house for the rest of the day, getting online every
now and then and mostly watching TV. I was also sniffling a lot and
concerned that I might be getting a cold. I am out of strong
drowsiness inducing antihistamines but when I was looking for them, I
realized I had some muscle relaxants that may cause drowsiness. With
my shoulder still bothering me, I decided to take on of them thinking
it might help me sleep and it might help my shoulder, too. 
Friday, July 3: San Pedro de Atacama to Tocopillo

I slept well last night and woke up feeling quite well rested. Woohoo!
I got an easy hitch with a local guide and his daughter back to
Calama. I had a couple of hours to kill so just wandered the main
drag but with my backpack in town, I didn&apos;t go too far. I ate lunch
in the plaza and eventually made my way to the waiting collectivo.
When nobody else showed up to fill our car, a couple that had already
been waiting an hour and I agreed to pay extra to get there. Turns
out the car behind us only had three paying customers and didn&apos;t have
to pay extra. Argh! I thought that was the case but the other couple
had already agreed to pay the extra.
We got to Chuquicamata, &quot;Chuqui&quot; Mine, one of the worlds largest open
pit mines. They offer free tours but you have to register in advance
which I had done yesterday. Our tour started in the now abandoned
town of Chuqui. It was just abandoned in the last few years due to
the pollution from the processing facilities which are too close to
the town. It&apos;s a ghost town but since it is still relatively modern,
just doesn&apos;t have that ghostly feel yet. Even more noticeable than
the absence of people, is the absence of dogs.
We started with a history of the mine and a description of the
processes necessary to get copper from the two different types of ores
being mined in the area. We then visited the mine itself. The mine
is now more than a kilometer deep, 5 kilometers wide. And it will
soon be connected to the mine to the south and be even larger. To
make the connection, they are having to move a lot of the
infrastructure for the mine that it&apos;s already in place but since the
ore goes there, so goes the mine. The tailings piles which are more
like mountains are also being recycled. Large sheets of plastic are
being laid down with the recyclable ore on top and then solution to
leach out the copper will be leeched through. The plastic allows them
to collect the solution and get more copper out of the material.
We watched the mining operation in the pit. Some of the worlds
largest trucks operate here. One dump truck costs, $4 million. One
tire on these trucks costs, $30,000 dollars. That same tire weighs 3
tons (or is it tonnes?) It lasts nine months. These trucks last 10
years. They operate an average of 22 hours a day. 80% are in service
at any time while the others are being serviced.
I never did see any of the types of trucks I had seen on Baquedano
operating here.
Before arriving in northern Chile, I had heard of the mine and decided
to visit if time permitted. I expected it to horrible blight on the
earth. But as I got closer and further north in Chile, I began to
wonder. And now that I&apos;ve been here, I just don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s as
bad as I thought I would. This mine is in a barren area with no
vegetation, no noticeable animal life, and no water. The discard piles
or mountains look much the same as the original hills and earth from
which it was taken. Unlike the mountaintop mining in the Appalachians
for example, there is no polluted runoff affecting areas far from the
mine downstream. I can&apos;t say I like the mine, but I can&apos;t say it&apos;s
all that bad. Now there&apos;s is probably waste pollutants that I don&apos;t
know about, but it still just seems like it can&apos;t be as bad as a
similar mine in an area with water and life to be affected.
After the tour, instead of returning to Calama, I hitched two rides to
Tocopilla, on the coast. It&apos;s much warmer here, especially at night.
I found an expensive room here at 8000 which is the same as I had been
paying in San Pedro. Dinner of Tuna while watching TV in my room.

Subject: 7/4-7: Tocopillo to Arica
I am planning on heading into Peru in the next couple/few days.
I&apos;ve been hearing about road blockades in Peru for quite some time.
Some of them allow vehicles to pass for a small &quot;donation&quot;. Others
you can cross on foot but may have to walk a few hours or even a day
or two to get to the other side of the blockade where other vehicles
wait to bring you further along the road. Others still completely
block the road with boulders or are too sketchy to cross on foot. And
there are some where a long detour can get you past the blockade.
Some tourists have been forced to fly from place to place or skip
areas they wanted to visit. This is especially true for those short
on time.
Since I have no set schedule, I will be prepared to detour around,
cross on foot if possible, or wait out any blockades that seem like
they may turn violent. One of the things I&apos;m doing before entering
Peru is mailing home any of the extra weight and bulk I&apos;m currently
carrying. That way I&apos;ll be in a better position to walk if that&apos;s my
best way through.
These blockades started out politically motivated when the government
decreed Amazonian land be sold to outside interests in the name of
&quot;development&quot; seemingly without regard for the native people who
already live there. However, other blockades may have started up as
purely opportunistic ways of making money for the locals. They are
not just targeting tourists. There are also union strikes targeting
transportation.
In any case, I will be careful as I move around Peru but for as many
people as I&apos;ve heard traveling in Peru, nobody has had any bad
experiences other than delays and a few extra dollars paid to get
through blockades.] 
Saturday, July 4: Tocopillo to Iquique

Woke up early and watched White Fang 2 on TV this morning. Then it
was time to start hitching.
As I had hoped, I got a short hitch to the edge of town. Then a small
car that already had four people in it did two u-turns to come pick me
up. Cool! I squished into the middle of the back seat for the better
part of an hour. They were going to a beach town. Turns out the one
other guy in the back seat that didn&apos;t react to the shenanigans of the
other three was also hitchhiking. They let him off first and I kept
going with the others.
They stopped at one of the unofficial beach towns but it was big
enough to have a bus stop. So, I started hitching from there. In the
first 15 minutes, two buses went by that I didn&apos;t stop. Then a car
stopped. I had heard about this, but this was the first time I got
into a car and they guy asked me to talk to him to help keep him
awake. I had to explain that I knew very little Spanish. He didn&apos;t
know much English so I was my scraping the bottom of the barrel of my
Spanish skills for two hours of conversation with this guy. But we
kept the conversation going - mostly - and all was good. At one
point, we had to go through an immigration checkpoint. While stopped,
the guy bought me a soda and cookies. Then we stopped at another
roadside stand that was obviously very popular and the guy bought me a
cold seafood dish with peppers, cilantro, onion, in a broth and with a
hearty fish with a good bite but not chewy. I did try to protest but
he would have none of it.
He dropped me off at the southern end of Arica so I grabbed a bus to
get to the center. No problem. I could see paragliders above as we
went and remembered this was a paragliding mecca. Hmm... It&apos;s
something I&apos;ve wanted to do for a long time... I&apos;ll have to think
about it.
I checked into a hostel, dropped my bags, and took a walk. I started
with the corner bakery, known for their local specialty cookies,
chumbeques. They gave me a sample to try and I bought a few more in a
variety of flavors. These cookies are layered with sticky stuff
holding them together. They come in traditional flavor as well as a
variety of fruit, manjar, and chocolate. Traditional was OK, Orange
was good, chocolate so-so, and manjar OK. They were rather dry,
sticky, and only sort of sweet.
I walked around the plaza and saw some performances by little kids on
a stage in front of the arts building. Song and dance kind of stuff.
The area has beautiful old buildings and the sidewalks, believe it or
not, are wood. There&apos;s just no rain here to make that a problem.
I looked into tours to go to the areas I&apos;m interested in seeing and
there aren&apos;t any that are appropriate so I&apos;m hitching tomorrow.
Dinner and then Internet at the hostel, transcribed journal, copied SD
cards.
And oh yeah, it&apos;s Independence Day and N. Korea has seen fit to test a
medium range missile. 
Sunday, July 5: Iquique

No breakfast appeared at 8:30 as I had been told the previous day so I
waited nearly 30 minutes and when there were no signs of life, I took
off and found my own breakfast at the local supermarket that was
supposed to open at 9 and didn&apos;t open until 9:10. The wonders of
Chilean time.
I went to the road out of town to try to hitch. It turns out there
was only a small space just beyond the police checkpoint where cars
could pull over. Two Chileans were there also trying to get a ride.
A collectivo taxi pulled over and they went to talk with the driver.
One motioned me over so I hitched my first collectivo. He brought me
up the hill to Alto Hospicio, a town a few kilometers away and at the
top of the hills or cliffs behind Iquique. They let me out where it
might have been possible to hitch but with two lanes going my way, I
gave up after not too long and started walking. I soon found the bus
stop and just took a minibus to get to the Pan American Highway. They
turned south, my direction, so I stayed with them through the next
town to the place where they turned off. I got out there and started
hitching. It was a good place to hitch as lot of the traffic turned
off. So only the vehicles going my way would pass me from here. A
truck soon picked me up and drove me through the salt flats and
tamargural forest. There&apos;s a forest here of obviously planted trees,
but I think they are native to the area.
After driving through more salt flats that look more like brown dirt
than the white salt underneath, my driver dropped me at the turnoff
for Cerro Pintados, and I started walking. I knew I could walk to my
destination 1.5 hours away and didn&apos;t know if anyone else would come
along so I started walking. It was a long dusty road to a ghost town
and then along the base of the hills. It was here that the only
vehicle to pass me came by. It was a guy on a motorcycle who stopped
to tell me my destination was at some trees I could see in the
distance. Like at the salt flats in the altiplano, I could hear the
salt groaning and cracking kind of like ice on a lake.
Shortly after he passed me, I started seeing some of the geoglyphs
high in the hills. I could also start to make out more in the
distance. I knew they were spread out over a three kilometer area in
these hills.
A little while later when I got to the gate, I realized the guy on the
motorcycle was the gatekeeper for the site. I sat with him to cool
off a bit, used the bathroom, and talked about the wildlife in the
area. Then I went to the picnic area to eat lunch before touring the
main part of the site.
As I finished my lunch, one car came by but drove right past the
picnic area. I hoped they would picnic after touring the area and
maybe I could get a ride out with them.
I started walking through the remaining two kilometers of the site.
There are over 350 geoglyphs here, some or all of which may have been
restored. I wasn&apos;t sure exactly what to expect but found these images
were created by clearing the darker surface rocks off the lighter
sandy surface they rest on. They are huge though. I felt no need to
try to climb a hill to go see one of these closer up. They were much
easier to see from further away.
I was also surprised at how high many of the geoglyphs were. Some of
these hills are very high and some of the geoglyphs were right near
the top.
As I continued walking into the site, the car I had seen go in while I
was picnicking passed me on its way out. Oh well. There went my
ride. I continued though, knowing I could walk it. The geoglyphs
took on all sorts of forms. There were llamas, people, geometric
shapes such as squares and circles, patterns that reminded me more of
southwestern US Indian designs, birds, arrows, a star, and more.
Another car came in as I was walking out. They had stopped to take
pictures and we exchanged cameras to get the proof pictures we all
wanted and for them to have a pictures with all four of them in it.
They agreed to give me a ride out of the park but I had them pick me
up when they were leaving rather than take me now. I walked back to
the guardhouse and used the bathroom again and waited for my ride out.
Turns out, my ride was a group of off duty Chilean Army people. They
were taking part in exercises that some American Navy people I had met
yesterday were taking part in. They gave me a ride all the way back
to Humberstone where I toured the long defunct saltpeter plant there.
There&apos;s also a ghost town there and I got to see how time stood still
after an entire community moved away. The theater, school, and a
bunch of other buildings were open for touring. Even many of the
plant buildings were open.
After Humberstone, I walked to the nearby Santa Laura plant, about 30
minutes away. I toured there and as the sun was setting, started
walking back to the bus stop at Humberstone. It wasn&apos;t the best area
to hitch with little area for cars to pull off and lots of traffic so
I wasn&apos;t trying all that hard but a car did eventually pull over and
give me a ride.
I wish it hadn&apos;t. It was my first &quot;bad&quot; hitch. The guy was drunk
which wasn&apos;t immediately evident. On the straight road, he was OK,
but I did wonder why he was going so slow. And it&apos;s not unusual for
me to not understand some people when they speak Spanish so I just
thought he was mumbling when he was slurring. Then we started hitting
some curves in the road and he started to get out a cigarette. He was
all over the road and when I kept saying &quot;watch out&quot; (in English)
because I was scared and trying to think how I could get out of the
car, he finally asked if I wanted him to stop so I could get out. I
think he was surprised when I said &quot;yes&quot;. It was dark. This was
still not a god stretch of road to hitch because of all the traffic
and lack of space to pull over. And I was now only halfway to where I
was trying to go, maybe 23 more km away. Then I realized I was only
15 km to Alto Hospicio and the nearest bus stop. I could walk that in
three hours if necessary.
I walked the road to a place with some street lights and tried to
hitch from there but only the last car in any line of traffic would be
able to stop so I gave up and knowing I could get back to town in
three hours, started walking. I had my headlamp with me so turned on
the flashing red light to face backwards as I walked. There was
nearly a full moon so I had plenty of light to see by. Any time I got
to a place where a car could pull off, if cars went by, I would hitch
but otherwise I would just keep walking.
It didn&apos;t take all that long, maybe 30-45 minutes, but finally, at one
of those places where I stopped to hitch, the last car in the line
pulled over. I had to run maybe 300m to get to the car. When I got
in the car, I immediately thanked them and explained that my last
driver had been drinking too much. They had been wondering what a
gringa was doing in the middle of nowhere. They were a really nice
couple on their way to Alto Hospicio where I could get a bus, but when
we got there, they drove right through and brought me all the way to
Iquique. Wow!
And then when I got back to the hostel, my free internet was no longer
free (I could pay 500/hour which is expensive in this town) and the
lady who owned the hostel said her son was wrong to tell me breakfast
at 8:30 but he was sitting right there and she didn&apos;t tell him because
an hour or so later, after I had been talking with a couple other
people staying there, the son told them 8:30, too. 
Monday, July 6: Iquique

Socialized with two morning arrivals from Belgium and ended up making
plans to meet them for dinner. Breakfast today, was being put out
before 9am but didn&apos;t start until after 9am. The two new arrivals had
been told that internet was free. Plus, I tried to get a hot shower
this morning and the water wasn&apos;t hot. Someone else said they had hot
water, but the other guy in the dorm said his wasn&apos;t hot. That was
the last straw at this hostel and I decided to move to another hostel.
I finally got out and wandered town looking for another hostel. I ran
into some Germans I had seen in San Pedro and then again on my tour of
the Chuqui Mine. One of the guys in this threesome is very tall and
may have legs as long as mine. Wow! I may see then again in Arica.
Kept wandering until I found a more expensive but quite nice hotel.
I&apos;ve got my own room, too.
When I checked out and paid for my second night at the first hostel,
the lady gave me back an extra 500 pesos because she knew I wasn&apos;t
happy. Oh well, it was a bit too late. I brought my pack and had a
very nice shower with no weirdness from the people that run the place
save the lock on the front door. You can&apos;t leave without them
unlocking it and locking it behind you. Other doors lock
automatically but not this one. Oh well.
There was cheap and fast laundry nearby so I did laundry. I spent the
rest of the day burning a few DVDs. Then I met the two Belgian guys
for dinner. I had a pizza but their salad plates looked better.
I ran into two German girls staying at my hotel and we walked and
talked for a while before bed, and made plans to visit the Gigante de
Atacama together tomorrow. 
Tuesday, July 7: Iquique to Arica

I took a walk around town early this morning. I visited the beach
with it&apos;s violent surf, walked past the Casino that was closed,
otherwise I would have visited the paintings of Don Quixote inside.
Then I had time to exchange the bad DVD I had bought yesterday for a
good one and bought a couple more.
I met the two girls as planned and we soon found a minibus to Alto
Hospicio, then a bus to the Pan Americana and started hitching. Of
course, it turns out another bus came by so we just ended up taking
that rather than wait for a hitch.
We got out at Haura and were going to try to hitch to the Gigante when
we were approached by a man who would take the three of us to the
gigante and back for 10,000 pesos. With as little traffic as we saw,
we didn&apos;t take too long to decide to go with him. Even if we had
gotten another bus, it would have cost 1000 each, for each leg so 3300
each wasn&apos;t too bad for a sure thing and a ride all the way to the
base of the hill rather than just the stop on the main road.
The Gigante is the largest prehistoric geoglyph of a human form. It&apos;s
86 Meters high. It is possible to climb the hill so two of us did but
we were careful to steer clear of the geoglyph even though it&apos;s
obvious from the footprints that others go wandering in the geoglyph.
Given how easy it is to wreck these, I&apos;m guessing most are restored.
Back in Haura, we had lunch together at one restaurant and all had the
typical daily menu. 1500 pesos for a huge plate of soup with a large
chunk of chicken and a potato as well as noodles, veggies, etc. Then
another plate of food, this time with lentils with meat, and rice.
Less than $3. Not bad.
After lunch, they went to hitch back to Iquique and I started hitching
north to Arica. 10 minutes later, I got my ride, all the way with a
guy who sells car accessories who was on his way to Peru for business.
We talked a bit but mostly listened to music. He was surprised that
I preferred the Chilean music to Michael Jackson (how many times can
you listen to Thriller in a week?), Kiss, and Pink Floyd. We listened
to a lot of Cumbia and Reggaeton. He was leaving his car at the bus
station so I grabbed a bus to the center from there. It was only on
the bus that I read my guide book and realized the hostel I was aiming
for was near the bus station. Oh well. I walked and it wasn&apos;t too
far. The Sunny Days hostel is big, clean, with nice people running
the place and a good crew here to socialize with. A stop at the
supermarket and the super agro market for tomato for sandwich stuffs
for dinner.
Internet is free here and I have less than 100 pages of Don Quixote to
read. I don&apos;t think Don Quixote will be accompanying me to Peru.
 [Date: Wed Jul 15, 2009 12:33 am
Subject: 7/8-13: Arica to Putre and back
Well, I heard there were some difficulties with transport across the
Chile/Peru border today. Collectivos that normally go from here all
the way to Tacna stop at the border and it was necessary to get
another collectivo on the Peru side to get to Tacna. I may try for
the train instead of the bus tomorrow. That way there&apos;s no border
stop. Unfortunately that means that I may have to take the night bus
to get to Puno, a town on Lake Titicaca. Not my idea of a good time
but I&apos;m still hoping to get there for the holiday on July 16.
Maybe hitching to Puno will be an option.
Stay tuned...] 
Wednesday, July 8. Arica

Burned one last DVD. Now I&apos;ve got a bunch to mail home. I sorted
through my backpack to find anything else I no longer need to keep
with me. Ate leftover deli for lunch. Read. Watched Crocodile
Dundee. Hamburguesa papas for dinner which turned out to be a
hamburger with french fried piled on the sandwich. It was pretty
good.
The German girls I went to see the Gigante with showed up. The three
Germans I had met on the tour of Chuqui Mine showed up. And another
German couple I had met in Bajo Caracoles showed up. Seven others I
had met previously showing up all at once and all German. 
Thursday, July 9: Arica to Putre

Most of the tourists who come through Arica visit Lauca National Park.
 It&apos;s a long day trip from sea level to 4500m (14,763 feet) or an
expensive three day tour. Since the sights seen there seem to be
similar to other places I&apos;ve visited recently and I know how badly I
usually do at elevation, I had sort of decided to skip the experience.
But then, the three Germans, a couple and a friend in their fifties,
rented a car and offered me a ride to Putre, the town at 3300m. I had
15 minutes to decide and pack. I went with them.
We had a great day climbing from Arica at sea level to Putre at 3300m.
 We saw the Lluta geoglyphs spread out along a dry mountain. We drove
through a quebrada (river valley) with its green agriculture butting
up against the dry desert walls of the valley. We stopped to look at
Cactus Candelabro, with its Medusa like growth on top of a single
large stem of spiky cactus.
We ate lunch at Posada Pueblo Taki with its environmentally sound use
of renewable energy. Lunch of veggie sandwiches was served with a
lecture about how their way of life, living in the middle of nowhere,
was the best way to live and every other way was not good. We
wondered at the upbringing of their homeschooled kids who have
extremely limited contact with other kids and only hear their parents
point of view about the world. Their mate was supposed to be good for
those of us heading to high elevations so I tried the mate de local
plants. Even with a ton of sugar, it was still rather unpalatable.
We stopped at the Pokra de Copaquilla to marvel at the chasm below and
the building of the pre-Columbian fort to defend against others who
might otherwise encroach on the fertile valley below still being used
for agriculture.
When we got to Putre, Karsten, Hans, and Dagmar were checking into
one hotel and asked if I wanted to share with them. I indicated that
it was a bit expensive but if they would like a fourth person along
for the next few days, I would love to join them and would therefore
stay at the same hotel with them. Otherwise, I would probably seek out
a less expensive option. They conferred in German and I was very
quickly invited to join them. So, Hans and Dagmar got a room and
Karsten and I shared a room.
Not a great start when I visited the bathroom only to flush the toilet
and have it overflow when I flushed. Apparently the people before me
had flushed their toilet paper, something that is just not done in the
country unless specifically directed to. We left the owners to clean
up the mess and went for a walk around town. We returned after dark
to pile on more clothing. High elevation desert is hot during the day
and extremely cold at night. We soon went out to find a restaurant
with heat. I had the local specialty, alpaca steak. It was like a
very flavorful cut of beef.
Back at the hotel, Hans and Dagmar went to sleep, I wrote, and Karsten read. 
Friday, July 10: Putre

Today was an acclimatization day. We stayed near town and went for a
local walk that climbed only a few hundred meters. Anywhere we found
water, there was ice. We found a sluiceway and followed that for a
ways. We saw vizcacha, rabbit-like animals with shorter ears and
longer tails. We tried to find a different way back along the base of
the hills but ran into a gorge. We had to climb in and out of a
couple of sizable gullies to regain the same road we had used to walk
out of town.
We had to get out of the way of a shepherd with cows, calves, a herd
of sheep coming up the road as we went down.
Back in town, empanada for lunch with Doritos, shower during the
afternoon, the only time it was warm enough to take one, nap. Took a
walk to a neighboring hostel as we have to change places tomorrow.
Tea and bouillon. Computer time. Empanada for dinner. Rummikub
played with cards to keep busy in the evening.
One interesting thing about this hotel... The bathroom is so narrow I
have to sit sort of sideways on the toilet. That&apos;s not all that
unusual. But what is unusual, if that I don&apos;t have to duck to get
under the showerhead. Even more strange is that Karsten, who towers
over me, could also stand under the shower without having to duck. He
also pointed out that the mirror in our bathroom is useless for anyone
who isn&apos;t tall. How strange in this land of relatively shorter
people. 
Saturday, July 11: Putre

After moving our stuff to our new hostel, we drove another 1000 meters
higher to National Park Lauca. We stopped in the small town of
Parinacota and walked with some difficulty due to elevation about
10-12 km round trip to visit a laguna at the base of Volcano
Parinacota. We had to go over gentle hills along the way and my
breathing was definitely labored. I walked with Dagmar and Hans along
a marked path while Karsten preferred to go cross country.
There was quite a bit of birdlife at the lagunas but mostly birds I
had seen before.
Back in town, I was feeling the affects of the elevation and was
looking forward to descending to Putre. But back in Putre, I found
that going down only 1000 m wasn&apos;t enough. I felt crappy. I found
that Excedrin doesn&apos;t work nearly as well on altitude headaches as on
migraines so I tried ibuprofen and found it worked about as well as
Excedrin. Since I have more ibuprofen than Excedrin at this point,
I&apos;ll use ibuprofen to help my elevation headaches.
I had no appetite for dinner. The computer was down. It was too cold
to go for a walk or go stargazing and I had nothing to read having
finished Don Quixote in Arica.
Going to my room at one point, I could hear music and followed it to
the gymnasium across the street. As best I could tell, it was folk
dance practice. My best guess was an Aymara Folk dance. The dancers
had already learned a long sequence but still needed a lot of
practice. It seems like they are preparing for a festival in a month
or two. But it&apos;s just as cold in the auditorium as outside so I only
stayed for half an hour and then crawled into bed. 
Sunday, July 12: Putre

I woke at 2:15 this morning to find my bed shaking. It was an
earthquake (later verified as a 6.1 in southern Peru).
Went back to Parinacota to see the wildlife near the lagunas near
town. In addition to the llamas and alpaca (not wild) and the vicua
and viscacha, we saw many birds including flamingos, Puna ibis, tagua,
Andean Geese, Andean Gulls, and more.
We drove down to a laguna we hadn&apos;t been to yesterday but my headache
was coming on too fast so I didn&apos;t hike as far as the others. I
returned to near the pickup and sat to watch some of the birds. A
small duck dove for up to 30 seconds at a time. The tagua were
building nests in pairs.
Hans came back to tell me of some nearby flamingos. I walked around
to see them but three flew away. Got to see the remaining flamingo.
I pointed out a hip bone that Hans took for Dagmar.
We drove to the Bolivian border to get a look at the volcano across
lake Chungara. Very nice. My stomach has been acting up today so I
visited the bathroom there, trying not to get caught up in the muddle
of those crossing the border.
Back in town, more bouillon while the others had tea. Then I went for
a 30 minute internet session. We met at 7:30 for an overpriced dinner
of chicken and rice with salad at a place crawling with locals who
weren&apos;t eating chicken and probably weren&apos;t paying much either.
Our little heater does little to reduce the chill in our room. I&apos;m
sleeping in tights and lots of layers on top as well as my hat. My
bed has a sheet, two very heavy thick wool blankets, a quilt and a
bedspread. I&apos;m warm enough with all this but if I were to sleep in
fewer clothes, I would need to pull out my sleeping bag.
Noticed Google was honoring Pablo Neruda&apos;s birthday today. Was that
just here in Chile or worldwide? 
Monday, July 13: Putre to Arica

Celebrated Karsten&apos;s birthday at breakfast today. Dagmar set his
place setting strewn with Smarties and a couple of sleeves of cookies,
a tub of peanut butter, and a large candy bar. We lit a candle and
sang the Happy Birthday song in three languages to him all at the same
time.
This hostel is weird. The guy put bread and manjar on the table and
left. Yesterday there was ham, cheese, and butter, too. So we found
four eggs on the counter along with butter so we decided to eat them
but when we tried to cook them, the stove in the common area didn&apos;t
work. So we ended up cooking them in the little kitchen in or cabana.
Of course the guy showed up just before we checked out. He hadn&apos;t
collected his money yet. Argh!
Karsten set off on his own to walk the 15-20km to the next town.
Dagmar and Hans were going to visit the hot springs nearby and since I
was dealing with a sore toe and a persistent headache, I wasn&apos;t
excited about either option. So, I decided to just head back to Arica
early. I brought whatever I would need for the day and left my
backpack for the rest to bring down later in the day. I got dropped
off at the main road. I was in the process of trying to take a
picture when a truck came by. I stuck out my thumb and didn&apos;t even
notice when the truck stopped until it blew its horn. Oops! It was
the first vehicle to pass by and only a minute after I got dropped
off. I ran to catch my ride and never got the picture. Note to self:
 Don&apos;t hitch until truly ready for a ride.
The driver was Bolivian and hauling European sesame seeds to Arica.
With a full load, we were one of the slow vehicles on the road
crawling up and down hills as others passed us like we were standing
still. In true Bolivian fashion, he asked for money for the ride. I
agreed and then tried to figure out how much to pay him. We stopped
at one point so he and the driver of the other truck he was traveling
with could eat breakfast. I just bought a soda so I could break one
of the larger bills I was carrying.
He dropped me at the truck depot. I gave him 2000. He tried to ask
for more but when I told him others never asked for anything, he
realized I knew a bit more than the average gringa and smiled at
having been caught. So, I felt OK at having given him enough to cover
a meal and I think he felt OK at having gotten anything. It&apos;s pretty
common knowledge that in Bolivia and Peru, it&apos;s common to pay a bit
when hitching but not in Chile and I think my driver knew that.
I walked to the roundabout to get to the road to town and tried to
hitch. But I was avoiding trucks at this point and the cars weren&apos;t
stopping., I eventually flagged down a local bus and the driver
wouldn&apos;t take my money but just brought me to a place where I could
catch the right bus to get to my part of town. I paid the second
driver and got dropped at the Agro market. Perfect.
One of the benefits of my coming to town before the others was that I
could buy a birthday cake or pie for Karsten. But the bakery was
closed so I went to check into the hostel. Then later, when the
bakery reopened, I went back but they didn&apos;t have the pie I was
looking for. No problem, they were making more. I could come back at
7:30 that night. So I reserved a pie and went back to the hostel.
Ross, one of the owners, is from New Zealand and is extremely helpful
and quite knowledgeable. He got me set up with a box for the stuff
I&apos;m mailing home, gave me information about when and where to go to
the post office, had packing tape, and more. He also saved me a trip
to the bus terminal with information about buses to Tacna and from
there onwards to Puno.
I hung out at the hostel, talking with others and sort of waiting for
the rest of the group to return from Putre. I was a little surprised
when they didn&apos;t show up by 6pm and a little worried when they didn&apos;t
show up by 7pm. At maybe 7:15, I got a call. Karsten, who had set
out on a what was supposed to be a 3-4 hour hike hadn&apos;t shown up. The
police had been notified and Hans and Dagmar had checked back into the
hotel in Putre. They weren&apos;t sure what they were going to do. Hans
may come back to town tomorrow to return the car and would bring my
backpack. I told them there was nothing in my backpack I needed to
just not even worry about that. They would keep in touch as
necessary.
When we got off the phone, I was extremely worried but knew I couldn&apos;t
do anything until the next day. I just hoped that Karsten would be
smart about spending a night out in the below freezing temperatures if
it came to that.
At this point, Art and I went to the market. I had to tell the bakery
that I no longer needed the pie. The person it was intended for was
missing in the mountains near Putre. Was it a problem? They said no.
 I did not have to buy the pie. I bought a slice anyway. More like
lemon chiffon with meringue topping than lemon meringue pie.
Then, not wanting to deal with making dinner, I bought a burger - the
same one with fries on it I had a few days earlier. I got it to go,
just wanting to hole up in the more familiar setting of the hostel
with others I could talk with. By this point, I had already decided
that I would go back up to Putre tomorrow to see if there was anything
I could do to help with any search the authorities put on. With my
limited Spanish, I wasn&apos;t sure any of the experience I had gained with
my previous search and rescues would help but at least I could try.
By the time I got back, the hotel had gotten another phone call.
Karsten was back and everything was OK. No story yet. I&apos;ll have to
wait for tomorrow when they all return to Arica to find out what
happened. In any case, I was very relieved. Now I could relax and
continue my planning to go to Peru.
I sat down for dinner with another couple from the US. They had been
in Peru and had gotten scammed when they changed money. So, they
pulled out their bad money and some good money and gave a few of us a
little course in how to detect bad money. I&apos;ll be looking for money
without red and blue fibers, without color changing ink, without
clearly printed metallic stripes, and without raised embossed
printing. These features can all or only partly be present in any
combination. This information should prove useful in the next day or
two when I finally get to Peru.

Subject: 7/14-17: Arica, Chile to Puno, Peru (Hey! A new country.)
I may be for a few days as I explore the islands of Lake
Titicaca. As usual, I find interesting places only get more
interesting as I get closer and find out more about them. I will
eventually visit the floating islands but first, I&apos;ll visit some of
the more distant islands with cultures less impacted by tourism.
I expect to be gone for three or four nights before returning to Puno.

Tuesday, July 14: Arica

Hung around the hostel this morning until my friends returned from
Putre. Karsten walked in looking very sheepish. Basically he had
underestimated how far he had walked and then misread the not very
accurate or detailed map and ended up going cross country for hours.
He missed his destination completely and eventually came out on the
main road just as darkness fell, 3-5 hours later than he should have
gotten to his destination.
He had the presence of mind to stop the first truck going by (in the
wrong direction) just to have the driver call the police to let them
know he was OK. He accurately figured that Hans and Dagmar would have
called them when he didn&apos;t show up. The police ended up picking him
up and driving him back to Putre. There it took three hours to go
through all the paperwork.
All&apos;s well that ends well.
I grabbed a ride with them when they went downtown to return the car.
We then walked to the Post Office where I mailed out a five pound box
for $35. Yikes! At least it&apos;s five pounds I won&apos;t have to carry
around for another five weeks.
We wandered the pier, looking at the sea lions, pelicans, and other
shore birds before stopping for a sea food meal overlooking the water.
 The seafood soup was delicious and would have been a good meal alone
but then we had our second plate of fried fish and rice. It was
rather dark and a little tough, but we could have paid more for the
white fish that was softer. As it was, it was too much food for me to
finish. I can rarely say that. With individual errands to run, we
went our separate ways after lunch. I tried to find a place to
exchange my book to no avail. But, I did find the perfect gift for
Karsten&apos;s birthday - a compass. Then I ran into Hans and Dagmar and
joined them to read the crappy book I had picked up at the hostel
while they wrote postcards. I tried the books store after 4 to see if
it would reopen but it didn&apos;t so I walked back to the hostel to meet
the group to finally celebrate Karsten&apos;s birthday. I found some
candles for Karsten to blow out and he amused at the compass as a
timely gift. We nearly demolished the fruit and custard tarte on a
delicious cookie-like crust, each having two fairly large pieces. It
was after 5pm when we ate that and it turned into dinner.
Watched some bad TV for a couple of hours and then went for a walk
along the beach and the long and dilapidated pier. Saw a Greater (or
was it Lesser) yellowlegs along the way in addition to all the usual
suspects. Watched men fishing successfully for small fish from the
pier. On the way back, we stopped for ice cream. That was dessert.
Then back at the hostel, we played rummikub again. This time, there
was a bit of a lesson in how to shuffle the cards and arch them
afterwards. While playing, Karsten pulled out his chocolate bar to
share. That was the evening snack. Oy!
Not knowing if I would see them again in the morning, I said my
goodbyes and hit the sack. 
Wednesday, July 15: Arica, Chile to Moquegua, Peru

I managed to get up and out in time to catch the train to Tacna, Peru
from Arica, Chile. It meant that I wouldn&apos;t get to say goodbye to my
friends again. It also meant that I didn&apos;t have to worry about the
border delays others had experiences the previous day. It was also
cheaper. The train was a single car train. It was old and held 60
people. It was supposed to be full but I got lucky and the person
across from me and next to me didn&apos;t show up meaning I didn&apos;t have to
share leg space or leave my backpack in the aisle. The train and
tracks were quite rickety and we rocked and bumped along more than
some of the bad sections of the Pan Americana Highway.
In Tacna, I found my way to the plaza and admired the church designed
by Eiffel. Unlike the Eiffel designed church in Arica, this one isn&apos;t
all metal. Then I found an ATM there. After I got money out of the
ATM and went to the counter to get smaller bills, the lady looked
carefully at my bills and didn&apos;t bat an eye when I took the time to
look carefully at the bills she gave me in return. Everywhere else
I&apos;ve spent bills today, the same thing. They always look. I just
hope I remember to always look. I&apos;m also glad I had the presence of
mind to trade in my biggest bills for lots of small ones. That means
fewer bills as change.
Got directed to the police tourism office and got some good
information there including that the police didn&apos;t think it would be a
problem to hitch to Puno. Wow! Talk about a confidence builder. I
stopped for lunch at a sandwich place and got a couple of empanadas
and my first Inka Cola. It tastes like sweet tarts or bubble gum.
I&apos;m sure to drink more of it.
I did stop at the bus station on the way out of town but there are no
buses to my destination until night time and I don&apos;t care for night
buses. I got to the place to hitch and shortly after I got there, the
National Police showed up, stopped the next two cars seemingly at
random, and then took off. I didn&apos;t try to hitch while they were
there.
It took while but the a car offered me a ride for gas money. No
problem. I hopped in but at the first ADUANA government checkpoint,
they ended up with a problem. It&apos;s not unusual for newly bought cars
not to have tags, but they had left town without getting one of their
documents notarized. They were let through but stopped almost
immediately because one had to go back for the notarized document. I
got out and flagged down the next collectivo and paid to 10 soles get
to Moquegua in the way back of the small station wagon. I was only
one of two people back there. From Moquegua I took another minivan
combi to Samegua where I started hitching. But it was late in the
afternoon already so I gave myself and hour and then returned to
Moquegua. Argh! I should have gone the long way by way of Arequipa.
So now I had to decide whether or not to take the night bus or try
again in the morning. I decided to get a room and try again in the
morning. I rejected the 40 soles room and got a perfectly nice 15
peso room. Just $5. Cool! I wandered the town trying to find the
car that everyone said would go to Puno in the morning but there was
none to be found.
I got a set menu dinner which included a large bowl of chicken soup
with a whole potato, noodles, and a chicken foot. I ate all but the
foot. Then it was followed by a large plate of rice with a small
piece of chicken and another potato. There was also a large slice of
carrot, a roll, and a cup of pepperminty tea. All this for 3 soles
($1). I can get used to Peru.
Spent some time in the internet cafe where prices are one soles an
hour ($.33). Got a nice piece of Oreo cheesecake for 4 soles (hmm,
spending more on dessert than the meal), and went to sleep early.
Peru is an hour later (Central Time) than Chile so I gained an hour
today and was beat. It now gets dark shortly after 5pm.
I had been a little worried about how I would feel about dealing with
travel in Peru. After a long trip, I start to want life to be easier
but so far, I think it&apos;ll be OK. the prices are cheaper so if I want
something a bit nicer for a night here and there, it won&apos;t be a big
splurge.
Oh yeah... I noticed the roadside shrines have continued into Peru.
In the Boston area, we have Mary on the Half-Shell or Mary in the
Bathtub. These are often in people&apos;s yards. Along the roads, we&apos;re
more likely to see crosses where someone was killed. Here, many of
the roadside shrines seem to be Mary in the Doghouse. The shrines
look like doghouses and if you look inside, there are figures of Mary
and sometimes Jesus, too, and maybe a bunch of other offerings. This
is just an observation of what I have seen. That said, I do have to
wonder about the proliferation of these shrines. There are some
people who must cross themselves every time they pass one of these
shrines. It&apos;s one thing when they are passengers in buses, but for
those that are driving, these shrines are often near places with
dangerous road conditions, precisely the places where perhaps drivers
should keep both hands on the wheel. 
Thursday, July 16: Moquegua to Puno

I slept well last night but woke to church bells every fifteen
minutes. I bought a couple of rolls for $.10 and caught a combi to
Samegua and started to hitch. After a while, someone told me I could
take another combi to Totora, a town 25km up the road. So I did and
continued trying to hitch from there. I gave up when the bus came.
Peru just doesn&apos;t have the same culture for hitching as Chile. So, by
the time I grabbed the bus, I knew I had missed any of the festivities
that would have been happening in Puno. I was first seated in the
bottom of the overpriced semicama bus. But after not too long, we
broke down. By the time we got going, a bunch of passengers had
traded to another bus that passed us. So, I moved to the top floor of
the bus hoping for more ventilation. The bus was hot but the
passengers all seemed cold. Weird. I wondered if it was me, but
later when I ate my chocolate and realized how soft it was, I knew it
wasn&apos;t me.
Anyway, I had eaten my bread before boarding the bus so I resorted to
crackers when I got hungry. then remaining cookie crumbs from a bag
of cookies I got yesterday. Then the last two cookies from Putre.
Finally at 3pm, we stopped at a roadside stand and I tried the
chicharon, something I had been seeing but never could get myself to
try. It was grilled alpaca pieces with potatoes, these huge corn
kernels with no flavor, and some other potatoes that start white
before cooking but turn black while cooking. To me, they look more
like something horse leaves behind on the prairie. When I pointed
that out to the family I had befriended along the way, they looked and
started laughing having never thought of it that way before but
immediately seeing the resemblance. I did have a good time talking
with this family, in almost all Spanish though my English words were
largely understood by Janet, the older daughter studying Finance.
By now, I was familiar with all the regions we were passing through.
The lowland green valleys butting up against the dessert mountains.
The mountains without a vestige of life, then as we go higher, some
cactus like the candelabro cactus and others. For the first time,
large groves of paddle cactus. More grassy areas as we ascended. We
passed tiny villages and it was nearly sunset by the times we came
close to the Bolivian border and finally got to see Lake Titicaca. We
could see the huge snow covered mountains across the lake in Bolivia.
And I think there must be a volcano sending up an ash plume. It
looked an awful lot like the Chaiten in Chile. Anyone know if there&apos;s
a currently active volcano in Bolivia near Lake Titicaca sending up an
ash plume?
I finally got to Puno around 7pm, shared a bicycle taxi with a cute
guy from the bus. He got off at the other bus station and I continued
to the plaza. 2km and about $.66 for the ride - uphill partway. I
checked into a 7 soles / night hotel. For $2.33, I got a huge room to
myself with two beds, and a reasonable bathroom down the hall. I&apos;m
not in Chile anymore. I walked around town which is very touristy and
ate in the tourist area. 9 soles for a good sized personal pizza and
another 2 for an Inka Cola. I wandered town a bit more than went back
to my room to read and sleep. 
Friday, July 17: Puno

Subject: 7/18-22: Puno
Not unexpectedly, transportation strikes have affected my travels.
I&apos;ve been stuck here in Puno for the last two days due to a
transportation workers strike. I&apos;m glad I have enough time to sit out
these strikes without panicking as those with limited time and a lot
of advance reservations might.
The extra time here gave me a chance to see the town from a more local
perspective rather than just as a tourist. I will resume my travels
tomorrow as a tourist with a fancy bus tour with guide and stops on
the way to Cuzco where I expect to stay for a week or two.
I am looking forward to seeing Machu Picchu and the other sights in
the area but not the crowds I&apos;m expecting to be there. For the first
time on this trip, I am traveling in an area during peak tourism
season. I am also looking forward to eventually descending to lower
elevations and warmer weather. I&apos;ve been in cold weather for almost
my entire trip. It&apos;ll be nice to not have to wear multiple layers all
the time.

Saturday, July 18: Puno to Isla Amantani

I woke up to the noise of fireworks at 4:30am. It reminded me of
Guatemala. Then I finally got up at 6:30. I left my backpack at the
hotel and just took my day pack for an overnight or four on the
islands of Lake Titicaca.
I tried to go back to Rico Pan for another good breakfast but though
the bakery was open at 6, the restaurant was far from being ready to
open. So I grabbed some bread, a couple of muffins, and an empanada
and wandered towards the port. I passed a market setting up so found
someone to sell me some mandarinas at 8 per soles, that&apos;s 24 for $1. I
bought some for myself and some in anticipation of host families on
the islands. I resisted buying puffed wheat there from huge bags
almost as tall as I am and a meter wide.
Without my planned breakfast stop, I got to the port very early and
had to wait 45 minutes after buying my ticket to board the boat and
then another 45 minutes before we finally set off. Our first stop was
the Uros Islands, a series of floating reed islands not far offshore
from Puno. It took maybe 20 minutes to get there.
We stepped off our boat onto the floating spongy mats of tortora reeds
meters thick. As they rot out from below, new layers are added on
top. Their houses, also made of reeds must be easily raised every now
and then. Even the beds in their houses were made of reeds and while
firm, weren&apos;t too hard. Their boats are also made of reeds though
some of their new ones are wood and outfitted with woven reed matting
on the upper decks. I saw a floating minimarket in this format that
rowed from island to island.
Each little community on the islands has a tower that they climb to
try to entice the tour boats to come to their landing. Ours was
shaped like a whale - or was it trout? Then the tourist gets out and
we get an orientation speech in Spanish but accented with Quechua to
the point most people didn&apos;t get much. I got almost nothing. I did
wonder, however, who ever taught the guy the joke about the &quot;Titi&quot;
part being for Peru and the &quot;caca&quot; part being for Bolivia. We did
have a chance to sample the edible portion of the reed and I found it
tasted similar to celery. I liked it.
After stopping at a couple of floating islands, we set off again for
the more distant Isla Amantani - not a floating island. It took a few
hours to get there. Once there, our boat was greeted at the dock by a
gaggle of colorfully dressed women. They wear layers of skirts,
embroidered shirts, and choco, or wide black shawls with colorful
embroidery that they wear over their heads. We were assigned to a
woman as we got off the boat. There was one other single woman on
board, Rosie from Nottingham, England, and we ended up getting
assigned to the same family.
There are no roads on these islands so our host, Julia, guided us up
the hill, across the bridge, through fields and over rock walls to her
house. Julia spoke Spanish but the native language on these islands
is Quechua. We settled into beds in our own room complete with
divider so we each had a side with two beds. My side ended up having
the table with the candle. Her side had the electric light that
didn&apos;t work.
While our lunch was being prepared, we went for a short walk up the
hill and found the plaza. There were small markets so if we go hungry
at our host&apos;s house, we can get munchies there. As we walked, we
noticed the primary paths are often inlaid with beautiful pictures of
local life.
Back at the house, we had quinoa vegetable soup and a plate of
potatoes, fried cheese that squeaks like Wisconsin cheese curds, and a
purplish vegetable similar to potatoes called
