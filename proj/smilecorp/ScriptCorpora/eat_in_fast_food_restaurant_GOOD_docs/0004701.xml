 Interview Someone From Different Culture 
 I interviewed one of my classmates who is from Brazil. If I am invited for dinner. I would go there on time because I would not let any bady wait on me. I would take wind, so everybady can have a drink before dinner. I would wear long sleeve clothes because that what they would expect form me. I would take my shose off next to door and put out side of house. I would take some dessert so everybady can eat after dinner. I wouldn&apos;t take dishes to kitchen because I am guest. I wouldn&apos;t smoke at her place because they would think I have bad habbits. I would have dinner in family style, sit with everybady and pray before food is served. I would appreciyte the person who cooks food. Enjoy dinner with everbady. After dinner, I would like to stay for some time, but that all depends on what time it is or is it weekends or weekdays. If it&apos;s weekends I would stay until midnight. I would bring some good topics that impresses everbody and learn more about their culthre. I would know about their currnt life. I would make good imression. Posted by Enzo at 10:28 PM 2 comments: 
 Working at McDonald&apos;s 
 Working at McDonald&apos;s is not an ideal part-time job. Working at McDonald&apos;s pay is low. Mostly McDonald&apos;s pay start with $5.00 to $6.oo that I can&apos;t even pay all my bills. Mostly too much stress because McDonald&apos;s is fast food restaurant it get busy all day and work hard. No self-improvement I got work everday same think. There are better part-time jobs who pay more money and easy job. Those are the reasons McDonald&apos;s job are not an ideal jod. Posted by Enzo at 6:57 PM No comments:

 The things I hide when people come to my home. First of all, I would hide all the private thing in my house.

After that, put away my dirty shose, so when people enter in every things look goods. Finally, throw all bear in trash can other wise people gonna think I&apos;am a drunker.

 Places Visited on Vacation 
 I have visited a lot of placeson my vacation. I have been to Disney World a couple of times. I went there with all of my family. We took about five or six cars because my family is big. I took most of rides there with my cousins. It was crowded at Disney World. I took some water rides in the afternoon because it was hot. I enjoyed the Mount Rusumore ride the most. Last year in the summer I went to Busch Gardens. I went there with my friend, once we got there, we took those yearly passes, so we could go again if we want to. I liked the Busch Gardens a lot. It was crowded we took almost all rides twice. It wasn&apos;t that busy in the morning, but it got busier in the afternoon I liked the Shikra ride the most. Mostly I enjoy where ever I go on my vacation. Posted by Enzo at 5:41 PM 2 comments: Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
