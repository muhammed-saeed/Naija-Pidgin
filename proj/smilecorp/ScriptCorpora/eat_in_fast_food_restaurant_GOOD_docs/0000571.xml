Gene’s Place bar open in Rockford
 Posted on February 28, 2011 at 4:45 pm by Melissa Westphal Tweet 
Gene’s Place, a new bar near Harrison Avenue and South Alpine Road, opened its doors on Friday.

Rockford resident Gene Hayenga—an Auburn High School graduate—renovated the space at 4412 Manchester Drive behind the Chase bank building. The bar features nostalgic Rockford prints and postcards for decor.

The bar is open from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to midnight Sunday. It has eight beers on tap, six flat-screen TVs, pool tables and dart boards.

Gene’s Place also features a food menu with signature overstuffed sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, salads and soups.

Call the bar at 815-977-4365 for more information.

I don’t get the connection of being a Auburn graduate and owning a bar? My wife graduated from Guilford and has owned her own restaurant for 20 years. Is he the first Auburn graduate to ever own their own business?

That’s great for your wife, JD. They should do a story on her too, if one has not been done.

I think it’s good to show local kids that opportunity and success can still happen locally. Leaving town is not always mandatory.

No need to hate.

Bad food–bad service–why can’t someone get it right–not what Rockford needs!

JD and Marisa: Thanks for your comments. Gene decorated his bar with Rockford postcards and photos, so I included in there that he’s a Rockford native and graduated from Auburn. If business owners are Rockford natives, I typically include what high school they graduated from just as an FYI for readers and if they bring it up.

I don’t know what Sherry Mills is ranting about–I’ve been there for lunch as well as dinner and the service was impeccable and the food was awesome, and there was a decent, albeit not outstanding selection of drafts.

I dont think the point being was specifically Auburn High School .. I do give him credit he is doing something and had a goal as with the others . I can appreciate the fact its being noticed too many times its not and maybe this will inspire others to make a goal and pursue it . I don’t see any harm done. Its on a possitive note. It’s not his fault nor issue you didnt get recognition .. Congrats Gene on your accomplishment . At least you motivated and made something out of your life.
