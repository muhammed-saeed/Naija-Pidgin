 Review: We were very disapointed!! We have eaten at Sara J&apos;s almost since the time she opened in Garden City and have always been well pleased. This time however we were diasppointed. Ther first clue should have been that the parking lot was not crowded, the second one was that were seated immediately, because ther was not many customers. Dinner was served on a very small oval dish (6-8 inches long) contyaining a baked potato,slaw dish and the food. Very bad. The baked potato was poorly cooked and the oyster and scallops looked as though they had been sent down from a fast food restaurant up north. The hush puppies were not good. all in all it was a bad experience and we will not return.

 Review: I love seafood and Sara J&apos;s looked like a good Seafood Restaurant. I will rate the food since I was disappointed and will not eat there again. The hush puppies were served first and were just barely warm and chewy so I only ate one. I ordered the seafood platter and was disappointed except for the fried shrimp. Flounder for the platter is extra so I tried the white fish. I would say the food was just OK but not good enough to go back. I guess I am spoiled with the seafood at Calabash, NC.

 Review: Having eaten at Sara J&apos;s many times in the past, it was a given that on our first visit to Garden City in several years that we would eat there again. We certainly weren&apos;t disappointed. The wait was a little long but they were very busy--just difficult to keep a 5-year-old child occupied during the wait. The waitress was doing her best but since the place was so busy, she was pushed to handle everyone. All that having been said, the food was fantastic, as always. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking tasty, well-prepared fresh seafood.

 Review: Our party of 20 went to this restaurant last night and we have nothing to say but great things. The food was great, the prices were very reasonable, and the service was outstanding.

The service is what stands out the most. The bus boys were very entertaining to watch. They walked so fast and gracefully with those trays over their head

I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

 Review: We just happened on this resturant one year because it was near our condo and we loved it! That has been twelve years ago and we got back every year. It has actually become a family tradition. The food is excellent and the hush puppys are to die for. The best clamchowder I have ever tried.

 Review: We make sure Sara J&apos;s is a dinner stop every time we come to Myrtle Beach and ever time they never fail to serve us wonderful food! The only problem is I fill up on the delicious hush puppies they give you while waiting for you meal that I am almost too full to enjoy it!

 Review: Somethings change while others stay the same. We have been going to Sara J&apos;s for the last 5 years, and has become a family favorite. The food was superb as always, but this year we brought all our grandchildren, and you know the biggest disappointment was for the kids. 2 of the kids came last year and got these spray tattoos, and all they talked about was which one they were getting. Then we show up late July, its packed, and no tattoo gal. Try explaining that to 4 kids under 9 that wouldn&apos;t quit talking about such a thing. To me it was all about the great food, but to them chicken fingers taste the same anywhere, but they remembered the tattoos. Oh well, luckily we ran into that tattoo gal at another nearby restaurant. Needless to say they already know where they want to eat this year.

 Review: 3rd visit to Sara J&apos;s. First and second visits everything was great, 3rd visit our daughter and son-in-law came with us and all I had talked about was the oyster stew. Boy, was I in for a surprise!!!, it tasted like water. Don&apos;t know if I will ever go back.

 Review: We had a party of 6 from (2 from PA, other 4 from NC) - ordered softshelled crabs (great), Lobster tail (great), Flounder (great), Combination w/Flounder was great, the Seafood casserole was OK - not what the person expected. The service was wonderful - on top of everything - you did not sit waiting for anything and it was busy.

 Review: Don&apos;t know how this place gets any good reviews. Long wait to be seated,overpriced mediocre food and service. As a local I&apos;m often asked about this place. I recommend avoiding it.It looks nice but ambience is only one part of a dining experience.

 Review: this was the worst seafood i have ever eaten. the place looks great and the service was great but my god i think the fish had been frozen then thawed in a microwave because the center of the fish was cold(never had that before) we thought this would be good but those places that have the buffets are better than this crap.

 Review: I took my daughter and son and law, my son, and friends with two daughters....a group of eight. Service was great, we were given a choice of inside or outside. We chose outside, nice breeze over looking the inlet. I had the oysters and scallop combo and it was outstanding. Oysters were above average and the scallops were so sweet and succulent! Salad and baked potato was very good, no one had any complaints to my knowledge....We will definitely go back. Was my 3rd time at Sara J&apos;s, but the first in over 10 years and it was just as good as before...

 Review: I took my wife, and children to diner here the boys, and I had steak and lobster it was very good my wife had staek she said that it was like better &quot;tender&quot;. Service was great, and as for the atmosphere, well we were a little to close to the bar, however, we will go back next year, and much of this one comes to expect in a Beach Location. I often recomend this restaurant.

 Review: Four of us ate. Three of us ate the Senior Platter- Oysters and Shrimp were under cooked. Clams were not good. The only thing on the platters that was good was the fish. The platters are smaller and so the portions are smaller which did not matter since the food was not good, The fourth person order blackened mahi mahi and said it was good. After many years of eating only at Sara J&apos;s we will be finding another place to eat when we come back to the beach next month.

 Review: Always been a favorite restaurant when goto Myrtle every year for past 9 years but this year was horrible!!!
Waited over an hour--which is commom and use to it because we had a party of 17!! It was too hot in the main dining room--when walked out thru hallway--the AC was blasting!! My hubby ordered one of the Treasures of the Sea platters!! Had no salad or potatoe that came with it!!!! Waitress was rushing us thru our meal!! We had 2 tables-parents sat at one and kids at another with differ waitresses and had to pay 2 bills!! Although my waitress loused up our bill and put one of the other parents meal on ours. Was not noticed when I paid. But when it was noted by the other couple-my bil was redone and I resigned the new cost which was less!! But the bill that was to be void still showed up on my checking account!!!! That made me MAD!!! MIGHT NEVER GO BACK!!!!!!!!

 Review: Have been going to Sara J&apos;s since I was a little girl... had to convince other members of our family to go this year because they&apos;d been hearing bad reviews over the past year or so... wish I would have listened... A lot has changed in a short amount of time... The food was mediocre at best, the atmosphere was still beautiful, but the prices were very high, and the amount of food was very low... Looking for somewhere new. :/

 Review: This was first time (May 4th, 2010) my wife, me, and my family ate at this restaurant and it was wonderful beyond description! Great food, service and atmosphere (Not to mention a beautiful place too) !!! 
 We will be back this weekend coming for Mothers Day. We&apos;ll be driving 100 miles to come to Garden City, but believe me, IT IS WORTH THE TIME AND DISTANCE. We really enjoyed it !!!!! 
 If they were located in Summerville, SC, I know a stove that would be for sell. Thanks Everyone, Frank

 Review: We have been vacationing in Garden City Beach for the last 16 years and have been loyal Sara J&apos;s customers the entire time. The quality of the food is always god. the staff is very friendly. Certainly (like any good restaurant in the MB area) the wait can be long, but it is well worth it. We alos use their take-out service. And of course, one has to get their new t-shirts every year.

 Review: I have a beach home in Myrtle Beach so I visit frequently. My favorite restaurant there is Sara J&apos;s! I was taught by my father that you rate a good restuarant according to the number of cars in the parking lot. Sara J&apos;s lot is always full. The earlier you go the shorter the wait. They have the best tasting shrimp I have ever had! I highly recommend Sara J&apos;s!!

 Review: My girlfriend and I come to Surside every year on vacation in September. I can&apos;t tell you how many times we&apos;ve both passed by Sara J&apos;s and note &quot;look at all the cars. We finally decided this year 2009 to eat there. It was better than good. Excellent. I am a critic of good or bad seafood and again it was excellent. We were fortunate to get there around 5:00 and got a seat outside. Great view. We will be back next September around the middle of the month and plan on coming back to Sara J&apos;s.

 Review: My family has been going to Garden City, SC. close to 30 years! We absolutely LOVE Sara J&apos;s. True the wait is long, but well worth it and we tailgate to make the time go by faster. Being a Marylander, we are very critical of seafood and how it prepared; however, Sara J&apos;s does a great job! The food is excellent, staff is professional and prompt. If you are willing to wait for good food, then Sara J&apos;s is the place!

 Review: Really don&apos;t know why this place gets the glowing reviews it does. The food is so-so. The wait staff are less than professional. And the wait times are horrendous. Would recommend getting there very early. Maybe the food&amp;service would be better. BTW....their Margaritas are terrible.

 Review: Been traveling to Myrtle Beach all of my life and every year it goes without saying that we are going to Sara J&apos;s at least twice during the week. The food is EXCELLENT, especially the fried shrimp. We have never had a bad experience with food or service. This past June we vacationed again and ate there twice and it was great!! My only concern is the fries - please go back to the old fries.We went to the beach in January of 2009 and made certain we went to Sara J&apos;s, but were broken hearted when we found it closed until sometime in February.
Please keep up the great work and we look forward to our next visit.

 Review: July 1, 2009
We have been coming to Garden City for over 10 years. Each time we try to take our family out for one nice meal. We had always seen the crowds waiting at Sarah J&apos;s so decided this year we had to try it. I wish we hadn&apos;t. We paid $$$$ for a very small piece of mahi mahi. We were disappointed and would not recommend or go back to Sarah J&apos;s. Prices to high for quality and quantity of food.

 Review: We decided to try Sara J&apos;s because it was highly reccommended by several locals. We were extremely dissapointed with the food. My lobster was raw and cold in the middle. My husbands seafood platter was very greasy. The prices are very high and I expected a fine dining experience for the price. They may as well provide plastic tableware. The atmosphere is dirty and noisy. We don&apos;t know why anyone would reccommend this place. We will never go back!!!!! There are too many other restaurants to choose from where you can get a great meal for reasonable prices.

 Review: We just got back from a trip to Myrtle Beach and tried Sarah J&apos;s on a recommendation for the staff where we were staying. Awesome food and Atmosphere. If you go you have to eat on the deck, its enclosed and has a great view of the Salt Marshes. Best Shrimp and Oysters i have ever had and the Hushpuppies are out of this world. Its the only thing i could think about the rest of our trip. We were talking about it even on our trip home. Definitely will be a regular place to visit from now on each time we are in the area!!!

 Review: We have always loved Sarah J&apos;s. This week we were very dissappointed for the first time. Our appetizer, soup and main course arrived on top of each other. We were almost done eating in 20 minutes so the food would be warm. We were barely finished when the server asked us if we wanted dessert! We both had indigestion. If you go, do not order one course before finishing the one you are eating.

 Review: We ate at Sara J&apos;s twice last week (8/24/08). Both times was really good. Our group of 11 enjoyed it. The fried shrimp, fried oysters, fried flounder, and fried scallops were all good. The clam chowder, sauteed shrimp and teriyaki shrimp were delicious! Some of us did not like the cole slaw, but we had enough food that we didn&apos;t really need it. We&apos;ll definitely go back next time we are at the beach.

The inside dining is a little noisy so we enjoy dining on the outside and the atmosphere is awesome!

 Review: As a local, the service at this restaurant is probably one of the worst I have ever experienced here in our area. Our food was rushed out to us because they were so busy, and it was not worth the price. We also we not offered any type of dessert, or asked how our meals were. Our drinks also went empty twice. The wait was definitely not worth the experience. Also the restaurant is very loud, and you have to shout to talk to the person sitting right next to you. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone.

 Review: Our family went to Sara J&apos;s on 8-3-08. Several of our friends had eaten here before and loved the food but warned us to go early or you will wait for a table. The restaurant open&apos;s at 4pm and we got there at 4:15pm and was seated right away. By 4:30pm every table inside was taken. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. Our party ordered the Sara J combo, shrimp pasta, 2 choice combo - shrimp&amp;deviled crab, and kid&apos;s chicken tender&apos;s. Everyone was happy with what they ordered. The shrimp pasta was VERY good. I LOVED the cocktail sauce, it is the best I have ever tasted. We enjoyed our dinner and would go again just remember to go early!

 Review: I really hope that the owner and wait staff trainers will read these reviews. The foot was good, but we almost had to explain our drink order to the waitress and we order a standard drink off their dinner menu. Others were seated after us and served before us having ordered what appeared to be comparable. We had to ask several times for refills on tea and water. Finally getting other staffers to help us. The waitress acted as if she had rather be anywhere else than where she was. We went around 4:30 to beat the crowd so we can&apos;t say she was tired yet. We thought the food was fair, a little overpriced, but then our opinion was tainted somewhat by our uninterested waitress. We&apos;ll try again, and review again next year. My mother and I will be going again in October. Hopefully the wait staff has improved.

 Review: We used to come here every year, until this time. The shade on the deck fell when the velcro straps let loose. It hit two of us in the head. The manager showed no sypathy towards what happened. The bill came and nothing was taken off for their injuries. When we asked that he do so, he only took off for one, when two were hurt. He was very rude and uncaring. I will never go back. Most restaurants would have taken care of the entire bill considering none of us finished eating once the accident happened and we were nice enough not to make a scene in the middle of their busy restaurant.

 Review: Sara J&apos;s is our favorite beach resturant for seafood and has been for a number of years. My wife and I are light eater&apos;s so it is not unusual for us to share a meal. Our favorite is the senior seafood platter, which is a light serving but even with us sharing, we ask for a doggie bag. We also use their carry out service if there is a long line. We recommend to get fast service, be in line by 3:45 since after that, you may have to wait an hour or so. Nothing is better on the south end of the beach.

During peak season it is common to get frantic waiters. We leave good tips all year. The wait staff work their asses off and should be commended for putting up with all kinds of rude people.

 Review: Yes, it appears the owner-manager is writing most of the good reviews. The Sara J&apos;s of the 90&apos;s and early 00&apos;s is not the the Sara J&apos;s of today. Prices have inflated, portions shrunk, and the attitude of the servers and manager are terrible. Near the end of our over-priced child-portioned meal we noted an item we had ordered had not been served. We said &quot;That&apos;s OK, just take it off the bill&quot;. The manager-owner refused. She said &quot;the server should have brought it and you should have asked for it sooner, - the bill will not be adjusted&quot;.
She was an arrogant _itch. I&apos;ll not return unless new owners take over and will tell others to do the same!

 Review: The food was very good but the noise level in the porch area was horribly loud. This was not necessaraly Sara J&apos;s fault but a large group of yankees who thought it appropriate to SCREAM between two large tables to each other while others were trying to enjoy their meals. My only complaint is that the management did nothing to quite the guests eventhough many tables had complained about the noise level. Otherwise the food was wonderful and I will return to dine. Hopefully the quality of guests will improve next time.

 Review: Over the years we have we have been going to Sarah J&apos;s for our seafood meal, over the years it has always been very, very good and we have over the years recomended it to many friends and people. What in the world happened on 6/4/08. Our fish was extremely greasy, the hushpuppies that were always sooo good were like 3/4 cooked balls of dough. My wife could not even get a small portion of flounder, she always could before. The only way she could get flounder was to order the one $19.95 portion which was 4 large pieces. She ate one piece and carried the rest with us which wasn&apos;t that great to eat later. My meal, Sarah J&apos;s seafood platter, gave me a yucky feeling stomach for the rest of the evening and into the next day because of the grease. Again I say, what in the world happened, we are just sick that our favorite seafood place has gone sour.

 Review: I have eaten at Sara J&apos;s at least 15 times over the last 14 years, and I have to say that the service and quality of food has consistently gone down over the years. The first time I went there (in 1994) I thought it was the best restaurant in the Grand Strand. When I went there last week, I honestly believe I could have gotten better shrimp at Long John Silver&apos;s. The wait staff has progressively gotten younger and more rude over the years. If you go during tourist season you will wait at least one hour, and the food is just a little better than fast food. I am so sad to see a restaurant that used to be so fantastic turn into a less-than-mediocre establishment.

 Review: Just had my first, and I do mean first meal, from Sara J&apos;s. Absolutely the best food on the Grand Strand. Where I was a bit unsure what I wanted to eat I was greeted by one of the owners who quizzed me on my tastes and made some recommendations but not until after being tempted by a peep into a clean busy kitchen emitting wonderful smells. The service was out of this world and we never suffered without anything for one minute. The four of us ordered various seafood dishes and were overwhelmed by the mass quanities of food. Way too much to each in one sitting. Our waitress brought us to-go boxes to package our still burgeoning dinners to take away for later enjoyment. She anticipated our every need. The chef is obviously a lover of find food since our dinners were unbeatable and all who had the scallops mentioned the tenderness and quality. The manager repeatedly came by our table to see how we were enjoying our lucious meal. The bar was well taking care of our drink needs promptly as well. The value for the the money was above board. We did have a most pleasant 20 minute wait on a very busy Saturday evening; so needless to say it was a quick turnover, but we were never encouraged to rush. We were there almost until the doors locked, and that was a disappointment. I&apos;m sure they wanted to go home, but never rushed us, we could of sat there and enjoyed the atmosphere until we were hungry again!!! I&apos;ll definitely make the two hour drive to Garden City on a regular basis!

The lobster is the most tender, sweet lobster. My husband always gets the fried seafood platter and especially loves the fried scallops. We go there every year and always have had a great experience and a fantastic meal.

Clams were good, oysters were ultra-greasy. Bottom line: This place is not a good value. Cost for 4 to share two plates with water was $64!! You&apos;d be better off going to one of the nearby good national chains like Carabbas or Outback.

I enjoyed the service, the food, the atomsphere, etc. There was about a 25 minute wait, but that seemed like no time since we could walk out down the path and watch the fisherman and the boats.

We&apos;ve eaten at ALOT of seafood restaurants on the Grand Strand and always end up wishing we went to Sara J&apos;s instead. You might be in for a wait, but it&apos;s always worth it. We always request the porch if the weather is nice and the atmosphere is so wonderful. The shrimp and fish are quite possibly the best we&apos;ve ever had. Every time we get shrimp at a restaurant around home someone always makes the comment &quot;It sure isn&apos;t Sara J&apos;s shrimp&quot;.

 Review: Others have talked about noise and having to wait, this is the beach. People are there to enjoy the food with family and friends. Of course there is sometimes a longer period you have to wait, that is because of the awesome food. My family has been going to the restaurant for several years and by far they have the best seafood and staff. They do their best with the enormous crowds that come through. If you have ever had a problem try them again if not go elsewhere and see how fresh the other restaurants seafood is. NO COMPARISON!!! As for the price, it&apos;s cheaper than paying over $20 per person for greasy fish at the buffets. Love the SJ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Review: We have been eating at Sara J&apos;s since it opened during our annual trips to Myrtle Beach. However, the last two years I have noticed the service being well below par. The food is excellent as usual. But unless the service improves we will be looking for some place closer to North Myrtle. Our waitress brought our drinks in plastic cups. We thought this was because they were so busy they couldn&apos;t keep them clean. No, everyone else had regular glasses. She didn&apos;t bring us hushpuppies until we requested with only 1 basket and 1 honey butter for a table of 6 adults. Also, no refills. We had to go to the bar to get refills. Definetely not what we are used to. If we hadn&apos;t noticed similar behavior last year we would have chalked it up to a bad night for our server. They better step up the service or people will go elsewhere, no matter how delicious it is. There used to be a waiting list to even work there. Must not be the case now.....

 Review: Looking at the reviews for this restaurant I decided to write one on our last visit there summer of 06. I don&apos;t mind the wait, I don&apos;t even mind bad service, but what really bothers me is when you pay $20 for something and it is not worth it. Portions are small for the money. This use to be one of the best places on the strand, then the owner manager who came down from Calabash sold the restaurant the quality went with her. I don&apos;t know where to get good seafood on the strand any more, it is all tourist traps, way overpriced and not any good. We find the best seafood back home. We stick to steak and the basics anymore at the beach. Nothing here is the way it used to be, you go to one place and its good then on your next vist it is awful just like Sara J&apos;s.

We tried it and everytime we go to the beach (which is about 7 times a year) we always make one trip to Sara J&apos;s. We have never been dissatified with any of the food we have gotten there. I would recommed it to everyone. My husband is very picky about his food and a great chef himself so if it passes his taste test, its got to be GREAT!

 Review: Our family visits Garden City Beach each October. We LOVE to eat at Sara J&apos;s. We just returned home from our annual trip today. We ate at Sara J&apos;s three times during the week. The wait was never over 20 minutes. The meals were served perfectly every time.

 Review: Being locals we asked friends about good seafood restaurants and a few mentioned Sara&apos;s. It was OK but not as good as many other places around town. No major problems, but just average. Definitely an older crowd at this place.

 Review: Wow, we just love Sara J&apos;s!!! We go there every year. It is on the top of our &quot;things to do&quot; list. We are usually there in October, so the crowds and kids are not bad, but we still try to get there early. The food is the best I have ever had!!! Look foward to going there again.

 Review: My family and I were vacationing in Garden City the first week in August, 2006, and chose to eat at Sara Js based on the recommendation of friends who had enjoyed their meal there. We had a wonderful meal especially enjoying the steak and the steak/shrimp combo. Delicious!

Two days later we decided to order from Sara Js menu as a take-out. We ordered 2 steak meals, 3 steak/shrimp combos, and one chicken salad. We were delighted with the steaks and steak/shrimp combos, however that is where our enjoyment ended. We did not receive some of the items (French fries and hush puppies) we had ordered and did not feel the chicken salad was very good for a restaurant of Sara Js caliber.

I called to inform Sara Js personnel about our order, and when I mentioned the chicken salad, all the person answering the phone who identified himself as the manager, said was,&amp;quot;What else?&amp;quot; and did not offer any explanation or alternative. I was also told that we must return to Sara Js to pick up one of the missed items (the French fries), and that we would receive a piece of Key Lime pie as recompense.

When my niece returned to Sara Js Seafood Restaurant to retrieve the French fries and pie, the person waiting on her, who also identified himself to her as the manager, told her that I had been rude to him on the telephone. She was also told that if we wanted anything done about the chicken salad, she should have brought it with her.

1. I was not rude to Sara Js employee on the telephone. I stated my displeasure in a calm voice asking questions about Sara Js take-out service. I could have been more aggressive, but chose instead to remain calm.

2. If Sara Js has an employee receiving complaints via the telephone who cannot handle criticism, that employee needs to be replaced.

3. I was not told about returning the chicken salad to make any type of change. If that is Sara Js policy, I was not told about it.

4. Informing a patron that a member of her party was rude is not good PR on Sara Js employees part and will only create very bad publicity for the restaurant.

5. While my niece was returning to retrieve food that Sara Js employees did not include in our order her food was getting cold. Her appetite for Sara Js food was ruined.
6. Our order was never completely corrected. Thanks for one piece of Key Lime pie - how do you divide that among 6 adults? - but that is hardly recompense for Sara Js mistakes.

As you can see, we were extremely disappointed by the time our meal was finished.

My recommendation is that Sara Js instruct employees in proper telephone ettiquette and how to properly handle mistakes and to double check take-out orders.

 Review: Don&apos;t go to this restaurant if you would like room to eat and for your food. We have six children and waited 45 minutes for a table. When we finally got a table with two high chairs it was almost too small for six people let alone 6 people and two highchairs w/out trays. When we asked for a larger table they told us there would be a wait. We were not going to wait any longer. They have no regard for what it takes to go out to eat with infants and young children. We tried to speak to the manager who was inconsiderate and arrogant as the waitress. He lost a yearly visit from us consisting of over $200. He could have cared less.

 Review: You may have to wait... but it is worth it! We go often and when we take friends and family they are always pleased with the food. GREATEST hushpuppies at this end of the beach. This is a very clean and eye appealing restaurant.

 Review: In the past, Sara J&apos;s has been one of our favorite places to eat while here in the area. In the past couple of years, however, the quality seems to be declining. The food must be prepared in large quantities and then held in warming lamps for plate assembly. The baked potatoes were barely warm and NOT fresh at all! I&apos;m quite disappointed and will not return. This seems to be one of those places that has gotten complacent with its good reputation.

 Review: Not such a great place. In fact it was one of the worst experiences we&apos;ve ever had in a restaurant. Don&apos;t tell them that you don&apos;t like the food! My wife&apos;s meal was inedible. The shrimp tasted rotten and very fishy smelling. We returned the food and tried to get the attention of our waitress. She had the busboy give us our check and we paid for my portion. They corraled us in the parking lot and threatened to call the police if we didn&apos;t pay the full bill. What a disaster!

 Review: My family and I went to Sara J&apos;s during our last Myrtle Beach vacation and we are looking forward to going back this year. I asked the locals where to eat and this is what I got: Sara J&apos;s! That was the best advice ever! The wait was long and well worth it, I am still talking about the shrimp and grits!

 Review: This was surely one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life. My wife and I have been vacationing in Garden City for 10 years and always have intentions of dining at Sara J&apos;s but never took the time, oh what we missed.

Sara J&apos;s is now my favorite seafood restaurant of all times. This will definately be an annual stop on our vacation.

The quality of food was out of this world.I had the Sara J&apos;s Special. This is a wonderful fare for a seafood lover, fish, shrimp, oysters, deviled crab and scollops. The scollops were the best I ever had, tender moist and the flavor burst in your mouth with every bite, no sauce or butter needed. The only thing I would change about this treasure from the sea would be to add a side of steamed vegetables. My wife had the 12oz ground Angus beef with potato and salad. According to her the beef was char grilled to perfection, tender and moist so no sauce was needed. Our salads were fresh and the dressings were top notch, smooth and creamy. She had the honey mustard and I chose the blue cheese.

The level of service provided was outstanding. Our waitress was on top of her game. I must say she was in the top three of waiters and waitresses I have had. She earned more than the recommended 18% gratuity and we were very happy to oblige. I only wish I could remember her name so you could ask for her. The one thing I would have negative to say about her is she didn&apos;t offer us any of the famous Key Lime pie but she really did us a favor because we didn&apos;t have any room left for it.

Atmosphere of the restaurant is some of the best in the Myrtle Beach area. The waiting area is very comfortable and tastefully decorated. Excellent opportunity to meet other guest in a pleasant environment. The dining area has an excellent view of the marsh and it&apos;s wildlife. This was a great plus to us. We love the marsh as much as the beach. Very few restaurants can offer this view, I can only think of two more in the area. The climate inside was very comfortable, it must have been just right because my wife never complained and if she is going to complain about anything it would be the temperature.

Value for the money is right in line with other fine restaurants. You get what you pay for. The only item on the menu that I felt was a little off was the 8 oz Lobster Tails for $41.95. This did not affect my menu selection, only a casual observation. If I had wanted the Lobster tails I would have paid it because no doubt in my mind they would have been the best.

Length of time to be seated was average. I had heard stories of 2 hour waits so I was prepared. To my pleasent surprise we only had a 30 minute wait. Time passes by when you have good conversation with your best friend and this gave us an opportunity to meet other guest. I could have easily passed an hours time. If you do have to wait for an hour or longer you will not be disappointed.

Noise level of the restaurant, what noise? Again, soft conversation with my best friend what a pleasure. To be such a busy place the noise level was soft and quiet. The staff is excellent. They can be as busy as bees around you and never disturb you.

If you are looking for a memorable dining experience that will last a life time this is the place to be.

When I make my next trip to Sara J&apos;s I will be having the sauteed shrimp and scallops. Sauteed in wine and lemon with just the right seasonings. A dinner guest at the next table ordered this and oh my what a feast for the eyes to behold. I can only imagine the mouth watering flavor.

 Review: We followed the old chef from what is now Coleman&apos;s in Calabash to Sara J&apos;s when they reorganized. There is no better cold boiled shrimp or hushpuppies in the world. My husband doesn&apos;t eat seafood but raves about the steak. And my 4 year old can make two meals out of the enormous kid&apos;s hamburger! The atmosphere is gorgeous, the food and service are always superb (even when we dashed in during a hurricane evacuation!) and we NEVER miss going there twice during every stay. We always go over to the Garden City Pier afterward for games, music, and a walk on the pier for a truly memorable evening!

 Review: Our frist visit was in February. We can&apos;t wait to go back again this September!

The food is wonderful, large servings, the service is excellent, the wait a little long, but worth it.

Sara J&apos;s has the best seafood in the area. Come early and enjoy the best of dining out.

 Review: This is our favorite place to eat when we&apos;re at the beach.. the food is the best on the Strand! The view across the marsh is fabulous, especially at sunset. The wait is always too long, but to be expected. Unfortunately, most of the waiting area is outside, which can be a problem when those evening rainstorms roll through! We love it anyway and always make a couple of visits during our stay.

 Review: We have been visiting the Garden City area since the early 90s and watched Sara J&apos;s being built. We waited a couple of years before trying it and I must say it was our loss. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. We usually have the Combo Platter and then share the different seafoods. If you call ahead, they will tell you the approximate wait and you can have your name added to the waiting list. It&apos;s not a reservation but it saves you from a long wait, although you do meet some very nice people while you&apos;re waiting.

 Review: This was our first visit to Sara J&apos;s (6/21/05). Last year the wait was nearly 1 hour 45 mins so we went else where. This year we planned to go early. We arrive at 4:50 pm and were seated at 5:25 pm. I had the Buffalo Shrimp for starters, then the Shrimp and Grits for the meal. OMG was that good! I&apos;m told by a couple locals this place is a well kept secret. I can see why. The prices are typical for what you get. The servings are huge so bring your appetite. You won&apos;t be disappointed.

 Review: Go early! They opened at 4pm, we got there at 4:20 and didn&apos;t have to wait. By 5pm there was a line to get in. The steak was one of the best I&apos;ve had in the Myrtle Beach area. Both the seafood souffle and crab cakes were good but had a lot of breading; don&apos;t get them if you don&apos;t like breading. The grilled shrimp and scallops were excellent. If you only get one thing there make sure it&apos;s the key lime pie - outstanding!

 Review: My family and I usually go to the beach for 2 weeks. During those two weeks we eat at Sara J&apos;s AT LEAST 4 times. The food is wonderful as well as the atmosphere. Everything is great from Chicken to Seafood! Be ready to wait, but it is well worth it!

 Review: I have been visiting Garden City since I was 13, I am now 50.

I use to crab where Sara J&apos;s now stands.

I must say I would much rather be in Sara J&apos;s eating the wonderful seafood prepared there than outside trying to catch my dinner!

I have not found anything on the menu that I do not like.

The servers are always friendly...even during the July rush!

If you have to wait, you will not be disappointed!

The food is excellent.
