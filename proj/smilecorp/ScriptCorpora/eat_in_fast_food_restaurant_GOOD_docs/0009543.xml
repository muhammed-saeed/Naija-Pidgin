 How to Organize a Birthday Party for Kids 

Edited by Jamie Bresee and 28 others 
 Pin It Article Edit Discuss History 


Kids&apos; parties are more fun than adult parties. You don&apos;t have to be so serious, and you can let your inner child out as well. Plus, by the end of the day when all the kids&apos; energy has come to a halt, and they fall asleep, you&apos;re right there, laying next to them, taking a little nap yourself! 
 
 Edit Steps 
 
 1 Pick a theme with your child . He or she might want a licensed character ( Sponge Bob , or Scooby-Doo ) or a pirate party, fairy princess party, etc. But make sure it is age appropriate. We don&apos;t want them having a &quot;poop party&quot;. Write down all your child&apos;s ideas on a sheet of paper, from theme to decorations, so you don&apos;t forget. 2 Get invitations . Check your calendar to make sure you&apos;re not scheduling the party at the same time as your child&apos;s soccer game or piano lessons. Make sure you write down the name of each guest invited, so you know how many chairs, how much food, goody bags, etc. that you will need. 3 Buy decorations . If you go to a party store, they will have everything you need, and you won&apos;t have to go to five different stores for all your supplies. At the party store, they even have goody bags, and toys to put in them. 4 Plan some games . These are almost mandatory for children&apos;s parties, but you can substitute craft projects, or renting a bounce room or a clown. (Look in your phone book for party rentals near you.) 5 Plan the party food . Most importantly, you&apos;ll need to decide whether to buy a cake or make one (or two). Make sure to get your order in on time or to shop for ingredients ahead of time so you can make the cake(s) the night before the party. Decide what kind of food to have - some suggestions are pizzas (very easy to just have them delivered); finger sandwiches; lunch bags with a sandwich, small bag of chips and a party favor; or you can make large orders with a fast food restaurant for chicken nuggets or cheeseburgers or, of course, from a catering company. If weather permits and you have a willing BBQ chef, kids love grilled hot dogs and hamburgers. Don&apos;t forget the trimmings! 6 Plan the party drinks . You could have canned soft drinks, lemonade, punch, juice, etc. Having a cooler filled with small bottles of water is a good idea too, particularly during hot weather.

 Edit Tips 
 
 You can hang painted styrofoam balls from a ceiling or tree for a space party (use acrylic paints or spray paint), spray paint pebbles gold for a pirate party (and have the kids find the gold throughout your yard) or you can purchase silk butterflies, and adhere them to walls, trees, and fences for a girl party. Just think of all the things that you can do for the theme, and go with it. If you have a theme party then make it into a plot. ex. if its a car themed party then you can have a car break down so in every game they play they can get a &quot;tool&quot; to fix the car. it&apos;s an easy way to have a goal but no competition. You can set games up the night before the party, that way they are ready to go on the day of the party. If you want to, you can have different games set up at once, and the kids won&apos;t be bored. It will be like a mini carnival, and they can pick which game they want to play. Scatter some beach balls around your yard. Little kids and babies will keep themselves busy and entertained. Plan for more games than you think you&apos;ll have time for. Younger kids tend to get bored easily and take less time at a game than you think. Set up an activity at the beginning that can be joined as the children arrive. Doing a craft works well. They can make masks for themselves, decorate hats, or just coloring. 

 
 
 Edit Warnings 
 
 If you&apos;re having a party for young children, and babies will be present, make sure the prizes and games in the goody bags are safe, and they cannot choke on them. Competitive games may upset younger children. Make sure beforehand if anyone attending the party has food allergies.
