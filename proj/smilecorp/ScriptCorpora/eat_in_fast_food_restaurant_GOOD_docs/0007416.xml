I tried them for the first time last friday. It was my first time eating Indian food, and might I say, the food was DELICIOUS. The naan bread is to die for! It&apos;s soft and doughy, cooked to perfection. I like that the orders are large, so I left feeling super content. I order the eggplant vegetarian dish and my friend ordered a spicy chicken dish. My server was kind, attentive, and recommended the dish that I ordered.

While waiting for my food I was delighted to watch some Indian music videos. Nice entertainment. The restaurant is small and it had a home-y feel to it. It was nice and comforting.

I would recommend that you go if you&apos;re in the area. It&apos;s worth it!

This is the worst indo-chinese food ever. She didnt even respect the yelp coupon because it wasnt printed out. She said there were foursquare coupons but didnt know how to use it.

The hakka noodles were really bad, i almost had a gag reflex. The manchurian was disghusting. The tables are dirty.

I made a big mistake by going, hope you dont.

Overall Rating = 3.5
Service - 2, Food - 4, Prices - 4.

The mango lasse is the best I have had.
The nan is excellent and fresh out-of-oven. The majority of clients seem to be regulars, meaning they tend to return. The rice brianny, lamb korma, and goat were great!
Service is slow and a bit unattentive. The food is good enough I&apos;d go back in spite of slow service.

I alomost forgot:  Even when you ask for a level of &quot;mild&quot; spive, the food will be considerably spicy (as in HOT SPICY!!).

It&apos;s hard to find decent Indian food around here especially in Pines so I will go here when I have a craving for Biryani and Naan. The place is rather small and the service is not the best. i&apos;ve never tried the buffet but the food is ok. Some items are better than others.

We went for the Sunday buffet. It was simply horrible, they thrive to be famous for their Indian Chinese food. They did not even have one of the dishes that was chinese. For $12.99 I was expecting a spread of dishes as buffet should have. This place had 2 chicken dishes, 2 types of veg rice, 2 veggie curry and 1 sweet dish. Just a horrible place, there was absolute no body there except for us. That should have been the sign to get out.... Just a horrible place

This resto is very near and dear to my heart, for it was at Indian Chillies that I discovered I love Indian food.

Okay, so is place isn&apos;t perfect - yes, the service can be slow, but they are always attentive.  The owner Jasmine is extremely friendly, always greets us when go in, and remembers our orders.  She has also pushed us into new realms of deliciousness, one day telling us, &quot;you don&apos;t want samosas, you want samosa chaat&quot;. Guess what? Turns out she was right =]

The nann is outrageous - crispy on the bottom, fluffy in the middle, buttery on the top. I like coming for the buffet - usually there is butter chicken, plus a goat dish and a chickpea dish, with basmati rice, nann and other sides.  I think it is the best bang for your buck.

Everyone here is very friendly, and the food is nomnomlicious.  Stop by when you&apos;re in the neighborhood, and tell Jasmine I said, &quot;hi!&quot;.

I went here two times, the first time was great with good food that tasted fresh.  The second time I came around on a weekday at 4 and they I could tell that they served me the leftover from their lunch buffet.  This place would have gotten a 4 star if it had not been their lack of attention to quality.

Drove from Miami to check this place out. I knew from the beginning it was a dive, so the appearance wasn&apos;t shocking. Was attracted by menu prices - a bit more expensive then the joints in Chicago (Devon) but way more affordable then the rest of SoFL.

- The Biryani SUCKED. Avoid.
- They forgot our nann.
- The samosas SUCKED.

The waitress was nice, but she asked for tips in cash. She said the owners retain all credit card tips because they get paid above minimum wage. Weird.

Not worth driving. ONLY if you&apos;re in the immediate area.

Bleh.

My husband and I often comes here and we always leave the place happy and satisfied. Sometimes too full and ask ourselves:&quot;why did we eat so much?&quot; they make the naan, eggplant curry and lamb curry soo good that you can&apos;t help it.  Will visit again soon.

Food was OK. Had a hard time understanding the server, she spoke in a really low voice and she did not know much about Indian food...this made the experience frustrating as I was about to ask her for a recommendation. Turns out, I ordered the wrong dish. Instead of chunks of goat with curry sauce, I got some lentil kinda soup with shredded goat - was OK.

After reading all the reviews we decided to give it a try. We are disappointed. The food is not authentic at all. The taste is just all right. The naan is definitely not baked in a clay oven, and taste like pizza crust. We think they probably get them from next store, papa John. However the chicken in chicken tikka masala was cooked well.

I&apos;m being gracious but they were nice and the food was decent and even more so very fairly priced for Indian food. Worldwide I would definitely give it more of a 3.

They are small and have this weird bright green decor that screams mom and pop but I don&apos;t mind. Yes, the servers wear t-shirts and the Haitian lady &apos;s shirt was a bit stained but since the food was relatively cheap what do you expect? Surely not Cheesecake Factory servers dressed in all white.

They are very practical. It&apos;s refreshing actually. Props. The cups and silverware are already on the table and they drop off a pitcher of water if you want water which works for me and reminds me of Korea and China except I still had to tip and the price was still more. Anyways so it was busy because it was Friday night, Groupon offer, a lot of Indian tables, watever the reason.

The samosa was good. $4 for 2. The sauce was a bit strong and distinctive so I didn&apos;t use it. My bf ordered the Tikka Masala. It tasted more tomato based and I thought it was supposed to be sweeter bc of the coconut but I am probably mistaken as I&apos;ve only ate Indian food 3xs prior to this. It did have flavor and wasn&apos;t bland.

My Korma Chicken had bones which I was a bit surprised and kind of didn&apos;t like picking through but it was flavored. As I said before this is not the best Indian restaurant but it&apos;s surely not bland, reasonably priced and the service is pretty good for a restaurant it&apos;s size and ambiance if you know what I mean (I don&apos;t mean to sound harsh or anything).

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  My husband and I had the non-vegetarian sampler dish and I enjoyed everything.  We had it medium spice and it had just the right amount of kick for us.  As stated by most people, the naan is to die for.  I could eat it all night long.
It&apos;s not a fancy place, it&apos;s one of those hole in the wall where you just relax and have some good food.
Came to redeem my Groupon deal but I will definitely go back again.

Wow i have to start off by saying, After reading the reviews about this restaurant
im in two minds, Maybe i went on a really really bad day ,Or The people that have given this restaurant anything over a single star has never eaten indian food before.
Im not claiming to be an expert on indian food but growing up in Nottingham England  in a Indian area ,Indian food was our go to option ,Dont want to cook go to the curry house , going out on the town go to the curry house , Indian food was just a part of the culture, Anyway My wife and I are always looking for a great indian Resturant
My wife found this one and even found a groupon for like spend $40 for $20 something along those lines....
My Experiance...
First impressions looked more like a truck stop cafe than a restaurant...But that actually made me more exited about the food ,surely the food must be incredible in order for people to overlook this and still give great reviews !!!
we seated ourselves and waited and waited about 5 mins later the waitress came over and kind of caught me off-guard she looked very scruffy and had such a frown it would curdle milk, No good evening no smile she just walked to the table and stood over us....
Yes er er  thanks i would like to start with some pompadoms - &quot;we don&apos;t have&quot;
Ok how about some Keema Naan - &quot;eh eh&quot;...No sorry no smile just eh eh
Ok ,all right  i know its not on the menu but do you have mulligatawny soup??
she looked at me confused for 3 seconds ...&apos;No&quot;
Starting to wonder at this point Ok keep it basic Chicken Samosa and two Pepsi&apos;s please
10 mins Later the samosa&apos;s arrive  no pepsi...
we were able to eat half of one samosa , the rest were inedible dripping in cooking oil
Ok we order main Course
Me Nihari
Wife Korma
while waiting i notice my waitress coming from Kitchen and retrieving items from the Buffet line Plates and then coming back for meats and other items...
Didnt think anything of  it at the moment ,But did walk over to the buffet to take a look ...what i saw looked old and picked over  I mentioned to wife wow glad we didn&apos;t get the buffet

Main course arrives and so does the Pepsi !!!! Yea
i piled on the Basmati rice and the the Nihari picked up a huge fork full
.....I  grabbed a napkin and expelled into!!!! it was disgusting
Not Bad Disgusting!!!!!!!!!ONE MORE TIME NOT BAD !!!!!!!!  DISGUSTING
THE RICE WAS COLD NO NOT LUKE WARM ,COLD LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF THE FRIDGE .....THE NIHARI WAS LUKE WARM ,AND SWIMMING IN OIL.....

I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!

I ASKED FOR THE MANAGER  , HE CAME I ASKED HIM TO TOUCH THE FOOD
I ASKED HIM THEN TO TASTE IT.....&quot;HOW CAN YOU SERVE THIS !!!!!!!!&quot;
&quot;THIS IS THE WORST FOOD I HAVE EVER BEEN SERVED  ITS DISGUSTING&quot;
I WILL PAY FOR MY 2 PEPSI&apos;S BUT IM NOT PAYING FOR THAT

He did apologize!!!! i automatically felt bad for the guy
and Left

I have had bad food before but this set a new bench mark
looking back.....
First its an indian restaurant that also sells chines food !!! uh
i believe our food was pulled off the buffet
Sorry if you enjoyed the food in this place i would hate to see what you call bad food
This was probably in the top three worst Dinning experiences in my life

For being such a destination for great chefs and foodies, Miami and the South Florida area in general is lacking in certain cuisines. I have found it challenging to find a good, basic, fresh, simple Indian menu.

Today, in Hollywood, I found one.

Let&apos;s get the few bruises out of the way. The location, decor, and bathrooms are very simple and unassuming. If you need those things to be updated and luxurious, you may be disappointed. However, if, like me, you take simplicity like this as a sign that the energies are being spent on the food, then you are in luck, because Indian Chillies does a great job.

A friend and I enjoyed their lunch buffet. All of your usual suspects were present, hot and fresh naan made to order (not placed on the buffet table), delicious and well-chilled chutney, tamarind, mint, and yogurt dips and sauces, Chicken Tikka Masala (saltier than I&apos;m normally used to, and I found that to be a plus today), Palak Paneer with unusually large slices of green pepper as part of the deal, Haleem, Channa Masala, and your standards of rice and boiled potato.

The service was simple and casual. There was a giant plasma TV tuned into Indian soap operas with surtitles.

On the way out, our lovely server, multi-tasker told me that there is also a $4.99 breakfast buffet on the weekends. I may have to return just to see what exactly happens at an Indian breakfast buffet.

&quot;I was the first Indian model to have a career in Paris, Milan and New York. I am the first one to admit I was a novelty.&quot;  -Padma Lakshmi

Good Indian food may be a novelty down here in the tropics. I am glad I live close to this place!

When in Miami, this is where I go for my Indian cravings.

If you&apos;re expecting fancy, this is not the place. This Indian restaurant serves great food&amp;has good service. The owners are very warm and friendly.

I almost always come here with friends to have the butter chicken, garlic naan, and a surprise dish. Every single random dish we&apos;ve had has been very flavorful and delicious. I&apos;ve been here for lunch as well---nice selection for the buffet, and the food is still as good as when you order to serve, which I had been wary of.

I love the homey feeling here as well. Every time I go, family members/friends are coming in and out of the restaurant, all greeting each other and sitting around for a meal or light conversation. And in the midst of these reunions they never lose sight of the customer.

I&apos;m also liking the upgrades, such as the new copper cups as Patty G mentions in her review.

This place is easy to miss, but if you&apos;re craving Indian food, I&apos;d say definitely make an effort to stop by this place. The decor and space is very modest, but the staff is always great. I myself always go for the chicken tikka masala (sometimes spicy, sometimes medium, always tasty). It doesn&apos;t exactly measure up to all the wonderful Indian places I left on E. 7th Street in NYC, but it&apos;s pretty damn close.

Some notes: They do offer take out. Also, if you pay via credit card, it is a $10 minimum. Other than that, just enjoy!

Why are there no negative or fraction ratings possible ? We were around the area yelping for a place, my roomie saw a review say &apos;Best Indian food&apos; , also saw a deal of $20 for $40 order and we landed here . Oh moms, what a disaster !!! I wish to sue Kevin B for that misleading review !!! If this is the best Indian food he has had, then I shudder at what he calls worst !!! he has a long way to go before learning Indian food .
We had a seekh kabab starter which came at the end and was as cold as a salad, had chicken tikka which had more color than spices, and a lamb gosht, which had only bones ... no meat and little gravy !!! whatever meat was there was so chewy, that it felt like from a lamb cut on independence day !!!
Okey fine, I am exaggerating. But trust me guys, that food didn&apos;t feel justified for $20  let alone $40.
And lastly, just to confirm credentials, I have had Indian food from Shanghai to London, from San Francisco to Toronto ... and even if you say I don&apos;t know well cooked Indian food, I sure know the sad ones ....
Yes, in Florida good Indian food is hard to find, but if you want to, ping me .... I will tell you where to go. Restaurant ho ke bhi Ma ke haath ka khana milega wahan !!!

I have read some of the most recent reviews for this little spot and decided &quot;Ahh what the heck, lets try it out&quot;. As I was in the mood for a buffet and indian food. (I have tried Royal India&apos;s lunch buffet and was not very pleased.)

What I liked about this place was there was alot of indian people here eating from the buffet. Usually thats a good sign.

The boyfriend&amp;I were greeted right away by a super nice young girl, which later I found out shes usually there on the weekends&amp;is the owners daughter.

The atmosphere was eh, okay? Nothing special. There was a large LCD tv playing music videos, bollywood i suppose. It was pretty cool.

Now for the food, they had curry chicken, Butter chicken, tandoori chicken, the usual rice&amp;a couple other things. I tried everything, and everything was really good. All of it was a bit spicy for me, but nothing I couldnt handle. For dessert they had out the Jalebi. Which I had no idea what it was but it was sooo good! Picture a small sugary fried reddish orange funnel cake. Super sweet&amp;sugary&amp;chewy. YUM!!
Oh and I tried their free Mango Lassi (cold yogurt smoothie) drink for first timers, pretty good as well.

The weekday lunch buffet was $7.99. Not bad eh?
The owner is super nice too. She&apos;s real friendly. Try this place out..the owner was interviewing new wait staff so the bad waitress i read about must no longer be there. Plus she said theyre super busy and she needs more help. So that must mean the food is good! Try it!

My husband and I went to Indian Chilies for dinner last Friday night. Typically I am used to buffet style, but for dinner, you must order off the menu (not bad, just an FYI). We arrived around 7pm, and the restaraunt was mostly empty (maybe 3 other occupied tables).

A really nice woman greeted us (looked like the manager/owner) and I told her it was our first time, so she explained some of the dishes to us, and gave us recommendations. We ordered simple drinks, and I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, my husband had the Butter Chicken. The chicken dishes came in their own little pots, and they initially gave us 1 dish of rice between both of us, but when we asked, they brought another dish of rice. Another waitress explained that they bring one to start, but each meal does come with it&apos;s own rice dish.

We also ordered garlic naan which was AMAZING, along with the yogurt dipping sauce. All the food was DELICIOUS, and served quickly. The only thing my husband sort of wishes they had was a side of vegetables included with the dish, instead of just the chicken and white rice. Just another FYI, the Butter Chicken was not spicy at all, but the Chick Tikka Masala had a kick even though I ordered it mild. If you are new to Indian food, at least you can know to expect it.

Honestly, this is a no frills place with great food. I loved it, and will definitely be back. We want to go back and try the lunch buffet so we can get a better idea of what Indian dishes to order in the future.

p.s. We really enjoyed the Indian Television station playing on the big screen tv!

First off let me qualify my rating,  I am giving this restaurant 5 stars on the food and I am adjusting this scale to Indian food in the Dade and Broward Markets. Having come from the West Coast my palate for indian food was cultured in San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver with some occasional binges in Britan, not saying I am an expert food critic but I know good Indian.   Moving to Miami 8 years ago was a culture food shock to me.  Things have gotten a million times better overall here but living in Dade,  Indian options for the most part are either really bad or good but 50 bucks a person.  Broward has proven to be a lot better and this particular restaurant reminds me of eating in an Indian Diner in the Tenderloin in San Francisco.

The silverware looks like it came from a high school cafeteria,  the decorations are old and faded,  the napkins are so thin that you need 5 of them to wipe the curry from your face but man I didnt want to leave.  The 60 inch flat screen playing Bollywood in HD immediately sucked me in and then I opened the menu and felt like I was back in San Francisco.  Too many choices and they all sounded great,  I was bummed there was only two of us because there were at least 5 things I saw right off that I wanted.

I got partway through the menu and immediately passed judgment when I saw what appeared to be a chinese section to the menu with chow mein and a couple other Chinese sounding items, I thought here is an attempt to please these Broward people that know nothing about Indian.  The woman that runs the restaurant assured me that Chinese food is very popular in India and this is the Indian version, she just got back from India and it is still all the rage.  That was enough for me,  my date agreed,  we ordered the Chilie Chicken Chow Mein and Mutten Curry (exact names a little different).  I have not had Indian Chinese before but I am a fan,  the curry was excellent as well.  For naans we went with the garlic and regular naan,  both were very good.

We quickly both went into a food coma and got again sucked in to the Bollywood.  Tons of leftovers in front of us we finally decided it was time to go. Total check,  $28.  I will probably be back next Thursday.

2 minuses --
No beer,  we need to convince them that BYOB is ok.
I ordered very spicy,  could have been spicer (I do have a high toerance though)

Back to enjoying my leftovers,  still great cold!

Great Food, Great Service - don&apos;t let this one pass you by. The owner is almost always there and is sure to say hello. We probably wouldn&apos;t have found this place on our own, but they catered a wedding at Bahia Mar Hotel. The food was fantastic and we inquired further and discovered they had a restaurant as well. We&apos;ve been here on numerous occasions using all sorts of Groupon-type deals (they advertise everywhere and don&apos;t mind you getting a deal). They do have a diverse buffet, but we have a selection of favorites we order time and again. The decor is unassuming - nothing fancy, but you&apos;re coming here for gastronomic delight, not white glove ambiance. LOVE this place!!

The WORST Indian food.....
Went there for Dinner based on the Reviews but very very disappointed.  Walked in the restaurant and place was small and A/C was not working to full capacity. We were well received(only good part), and menu prices is like fine dining Indian restaurant, but the water was served in plastic cups.
The Food was  flavorless and dull, and Indian food should be anything but that.  The service was condescending.  One star because I feel sorry for them.
There was also a fight in the restaurant between the management and a group, when they complained about the bad food. Don&apos;t go there..

I went for the lunch buffet.

First, I agree with another reviewer that this place is not well marked. Had my GPS not led me into the parking lot and then walking up and down the sidewalk, I would have missed it. There is next to no signage.

Second, I also agree with the ambiance, i.e., there is none. Doesn&apos;t matter to me, but may matter  to you.

Third, as a buffet, I was disappointed with the lack of variety. They had two veggie dishes (chic peas, and mixed veggies -- maybe it was supposed to be cauliflower and potatoes) and two chicken dishes (looked like a cream sauce and a curry sauce). Nothing marked.  Minimal condiments (no pickles). Lots of starch: plain rice, fried rice and noodles. Single appetizer was alu (potato) samosa. Plain salad. Gulab jamun. Nan is brought to the table (the nan was tasty!)

The flavor was OK. Bland, nothing special or exotic. Nothing spicy, though there was some chili paste available.

Fourth, service is good. Seated quickly, plenty of utensils. Dirty dishes not cleared, but the staff was eating at the same time (late lunch time). Since the place was nearly empty, there was plenty of room to stash stuff if one were so inclined.

Fifth, cheap. As mentioned, it&apos;s $8 for lunch

Maybe the food would be better off the menu, but I would not go out of my way for this buffet.

Hello fellow Indian food lovers.

I have been looking for an Indian restaurant for some time now that would offer authentic Indian food made for Indians. Well I finally found one after going through quite the list of Indian restaurants. The food here is both fresh and great. Their lunch special offers a large variety of food for a good price. I highly recommend anyone looking for a good Indian restaurant to come check out Indian Chillies. This restaurant was actually not listed in yelp so I decided to list it and leave a great review since I come here so often with my girlfriend.

Went here because of a Groupon. Went on Friday for the lunch buffet. Right off the bat, where told we could not use the Groupon on buffet, which made no sense to me....what difference does it make if the money is applied toward a $7.99 buffet or a $7.99 dish off the menu??
Went with my mother and son, we are from the Islands, and like spicy food, particularly curries and Indian food.
Got there around 12:45. Buffet started at 12. I believe they were serving three types of chicken dishes, but there were only small amounts of each left. Two types of rice, white and fried, but they were out of the fried when we came in. I asked the waitress if they were bringing more food out. She said yes. I lingered a bit, waiting for fresh hot food to come out. After about ten minutes nothing came, so I took the last of the scraps that were left. While I found the overall taste to be good, I was put off by the fact that it was on the cold side, and I wanted a fresh batch of food put out. Also, it was not very spicy. We were there an hour, and none of the chicken dishes were ever re-filled. They did eventually re-fill the fried rice. Why did the waitress tell me they would refill the food if they had no plans to, at least in the hour when I was there? I still have to go back and use my Groupon, but will order off the menu and try some of the dishes that people have said positive things about. But unless that turns out to be really good, I won&apos;t be back. They made no effort to display the food in an attractive manner. Were it not for the restaurant being relatively full, I would have been reluctant to eat there at all. The mango drink was good, thick and very mangoey. We were able to share it between the three of us. I tried the fried ball thing they call dessert, but it was gross.

Driving around Pembroke Pines, I was super hungry. I saw &quot;Flavors of India&quot;on University Drive thinking it was a restaurant, but it was actually a grocery store. But right next to it, was Indian Chillies. I recognized their name from a bridal expo i had attended so I figured I would try it out.

They have coriander green and rust colored walls with about six booths and three center tables. I was greeted by a pleasant indian guy in his 40s who gave menus and got us seated.

Okay then I was sitting around with my menu waiting for someone to get my order for like 10 minutes...the guy who greeted us sat in a corner with two other overweight Indian people while a Haitian lady (the waitress) kept on spraying tables and going in and out of the kitchen. So I asked her if I could get my order please...she seemed annoyed and she was def not waitress material; I could hardly hear what she was saying and she didn&apos;t know anything about the food on the menu. I had to walk over to the other table to ask them what chicken 65 was.

I placed my order and waited and waited for about 20 minutes. In this time, I watched bollywood dance songs. It was kind of a dull environment because there was no other activity going on, the two other guests were blah too. Anyway, after 20 mins the girl brought out my brother&apos;s coke can and ONE naan. I was like ??? how does that even help. The food kept coming out in this weird order, like then we got one bowl of rice. Finally after five minutes, food came out in small copper dishes. We were like, &quot;ahh finally&quot;. We had chicken manchurian and chicken tikka masala. The chicken manchurian had no spice at all; it just tasted like tomato paste with a touch of black pepper!! We asked for mild, not no flavor. The chicken tikka masala was slightly better but still below average. The sauce was watery. Between us three people, we did not even finish two dishes (and the dishes were small sizes). The best part of the dinner was the naan; it had a good fluffy texture and was buttered like i requested.

But the naan was not enough to redeem the meal. I feel bad giving such a low rating because  i did like several things; ex. their attention to sanitation, the main host guy, and that we got real plates and utensils....but the mumbling bored waitress, inattentive management, dull atmosphere, and mediocre food make it unlikely that i&apos;ll ever eat here again.

It tasted as though someone googled &quot;how to cook Indian food&quot; and then used the ingredients  they had left over from an Italian restaurant . It was terrible. Greasy. Over fried.  I have had Indian food around the world and this was the worst ever!  The Pepsi was good though.

Indian Chiles is the best Indian food I&apos;ve had since moving to Florida a year ago. The decor, and service isn&apos;t necessarily the finest, but if I were looking for that in a meal, I&apos;d go to a country club. No, I go to Indian Chile for gratuitous amounts of spicy, flavorful Indian food, of which they offer plenty. I usually have the old standby of chicken tikka masala, but that is so good, it makes me want to venture out and try more of their enticing menu. The food is awesome and the people are friendly. If you like Indian food, give it a shot.

Butter chicken is delicious.  Garlic naan amazing! Chicken tikka masala could use some work...chicken was not moist enough.  Wish they had the onion chutney like most indian restaurants do.  Price is not bad when you want a close-by indian food fix.

Went back to Indian Chillies today for some yummy lunch and it was absolutely great. During my last visit the AC seemed to have been broken, well they fixed it because it was nice and cool inside. They have also added some nice touches with copper cups at each table. LOVED them. The service was great, just like last time. Very nice people and great customer service. And of course, what can I say, the food is great as well. Had the butter chicken with garlic non. MMmmmmm. Will definitely be coming back!!! My friend even said this place was better than all the Indian restaurants she&apos;s been to in NYC. Now that&apos;s a statement!

We had the lunch buffet at Indian Chillies. There was a wide selection of dishes both vegetarian and meat dishes. The buffet had chicken tikka masala and it was nicely spiced. Too often at other restaurants if even offered on the buffet it is bland,  but not at Indian Chillies. I tried a little bit of everything, it was all delicious! The woman working there was very nice and pleasant and explained that the buffet selections change daily. She brought us fresh naan to the table, and offered a second naan once we devoured the first. Nothing beats good fresh naan. The buffet is a great deal at $7.99 as we easily spend $40 for 2 people on a typical Indian meal in the area.

This was the best indian restaurant ever! The service was exceptional. The restaurant was clean. The food was spectacular. They were so friendly and actually cared to please us. It was a very clean and cozy setting. The lassis were great..the perfect blend of sour and sweetness. SUPERB!  I ate the butter chicken, chilli chicken, and Manchurian noodles. I am so impressed. I just moved to the Miami area and this is my new favorite restaurant. Definitely worth trying and you wont be sorry! They give you special attention. I am very picky when it comes to restaurants so this just shows how happy i am with them. You will NOT be disappointed!! the best indo chinese, and pakistani cuisine in the miami area :)

I&apos;ve been here thrice now, and am yet to be disappointed, and trust me, many Indian places around Ft.Lauderdale easily disappoint. What I.Chillies lacks in fancy ambiance, it makes up with extremely friendly service and great food.
The must-have is of course the scrumptious Aloo-Paratha. Served with hot mixed vegetable pickle and a side of yogurt-cilantro mix, this is usually enough to win you over.
Other than this, I&apos;ve tried the Karahi Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Masala...perfect sides for the Tandoori Naan (and even the Aloo-Paratha).
The Mutton Biriyani is made in the North Indian style, and while tasty, could have used smaller mutton pieces.
They are also supposedly good with Chaat dishes, but I can only vouch for the very good Paani Puri.
Mango Lassi was delicious even though I didn&apos;t enjoy biting into tiny pieces of cardamom with every sip.

There is a 6.99$ lunch special (indian thaali) advertised that I will try soon, as also the Indo-Chinese dishes I&apos;ve seen on the menu. Can&apos;t wait. :)

This is a great hole-in-the-wall Indian diner serving traditional and authentic Indian dishes with some westernized favorites, and apparently some Indian-Chinese fusion type stuff that I haven&apos;t really bothered with. I probably wont either, their Indian is SO good.

Their wait staff has always been very friendly, but often times not so attentive. I may be wrong but I think it&apos;s a cultural thing. They will gladly recommend a dish or refill your water, but dont expect it to get done by blankly staring at the menu, or sliding your empty glass of water to the edge of the table. You have to ask.

This did change the last time I was there. Their new waiter is super awesome. They have listened to other yelpers and switched to glass cups, as well as added a secondary mobile AC unit to their central AC. I hope it&apos;s temporary as it&apos;s in the dining room, but who are we kidding this isn&apos;t exactly fine dining.
