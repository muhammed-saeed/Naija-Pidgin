By Carre Joyce Gordon

The New Beetle convertible and I were both looking damn
good, top down (only the cars), my skin glowing in the summer
sun, and a smile beaming from ear to ear because I was driving
such a cute car.

I pulled up to a stoplight and found myself next to a male
friend driving in his 1993 Bonneville.

The light turned green, I put the pedal to the metal, and
as I waited for something to happen, the old Bonneville took
off leaving me in its dust. Yeah, yeah, I know the New Beetle
has only 115 horsepower, I know its built for beautybut
knowledge does not always overcome embarrassment!

This non-turbo powered model would be a great (and safe) car
for a lead footed teenager, but not for an experienced driver
who enjoys some zip and wants a cars performance to be
commensurate with its looks.

The New Beetle is definitely a looker a real cute car;
everyone agreed on that, it is a cute feminine car.

After a week with this car, my male friends who were not in
touch with their feminine side pronounced that they would not
be caught dead driving this car, but on the other hand all of
my female friends now want a New Beetle of their own.

It is so cute and Wheres the testosterone in this car?
are the two remarks I heard over and over during the week I
drove the soft yellow 2003 Volkswagen New Beetle
convertible.

I really loved driving around in this car, but there is no
way I could live with a New Beetle convertible as my only
wheels. On the practical side I could barely fit my laundry
basket in the trunk and when I took a friend to a golf driving
range we had to put our club bags upright in the backseat.

I need a lot more space in my car; actually I believe all
girls need a lot more space because of our need for a traveling
closet.

With the top down the VW New Beetle convertible is like a
mullet haircutbusiness up front and party in the back. There
is so much wind at speed that there is absolutely no way to sit
in the tiny (understatement) back seat and then walk straight
into a meeting or a party without having a whole hair salon at
your disposalunless you want to make a fashion statement, my
hair?, oh I just drove over in my friends VW convertible.

The wind conditions in the front seats are much tamer as
long as you keep the windows up. An even better solution is to
use the temporary wind screen (optional $275), which does
eliminate most of the wind damage, but changes this VW into a
two seaterno friends or pets in the back seat...in fact no
nothing except for maybe grocery bags or small overnight bags.
Dont plan on a long road trip with a companion if you would
like to take a change of clothing or golf clubs, or boogie
boards, or even Fido.

I do give credit to the Beetle for my new tan, with the top down and
the wind blowing, its even better than lying out on a raft in
the pool.

However, due to the difficulty (understatement) of putting
the roof up and down, (Volkswagen must have tested this top on
Helga the woman weightlifter), it was sometimes more expedient to
just leave the top up and go out of the car to bask in the sun
and not risk that a sudden shower that might fill the topless
car with rain during an epic top- closing experience.

On nice sunny days with absolutely no chance of rain I put
the top down and cruised around town really enjoying my topless
experience.

Unfortunately I learned that with the top down, in just the short
time it took me stop and run into a fast-food restaurant for
lunch, the black (leatherette) vinyl seats absorbed enough heat
to make them feel like a pile of hot coals. Although this
allowed the backs of my thighs to soon match the already sunburned
fronts, it is not something that VW should be proud of.

I did come up with a low tech solution to prevent vinyl
burn: place a big, thick towel on the seat a better solution
would be to use real leather which wouldnt get nearly as
hot.

Hot seats, tepid acceleration; and impossible to operate
convertible top aside, there are quite a few nice features to
the car.

Besides looking mahvulous, the CD player and sound system
are awesome; the tiptronic transmission is as smooth as it can
be; the car is really easy to parallel park; and the electronic
door locks(automatic) gave me the secure feeling that there is
no way for someone outside to unlock the doors while I was
inside.

Carres Call: At about $24,000, the VW New Beetle is like a
trophy companion, it has great looks, smells good, and causes
stares wherever you take it, not bad if you are just into
looks, but I think it needs a little more going for it.

How cold is that?
