Where Should You Go when the Emergency Arises?

 Flag Close Post a comment Deciding where to have a bowel movement when away from the home is no easy task. The choice to purge is brought on by sheer pain, not enjoyment. Public restrooms are the worst nightmare for germ-conscious Americans. There are, however, locations that offer a combination of the four things most necessary when the urge to blow arises: 1) peace and quiet, 2) cleanliness, 3) availability, and 4) ambiguity (the ability to easily vanish into a bathroom and return without drawing suspicion).
 Kohl&apos;s - Kohl&apos;s, the mega clothing store which currently operates over a thousand stores in 49 states, has bathrooms that are tucked away in remote corners - often by their customer service sections. The retailer also provides the Pooper with options when making the decision to have a bowel movement. There&apos;s the Men&apos;s bathroom, the Women&apos;s bathroom, and the lockable and extremely private Family bathroom. Artificial plants adorn their walls, and facial tissue is provided at each sink. Both push button and sensor flushes are available in these low-traffic, clean, bathrooms. It would be best to go when the customer service employees are engaged in dialogue with customers - this will enable the Pooper to take their time without bringing attention to themselves.

 Hospitals - Just follow the big blue &quot;H&quot; sign when the emergency strikes. Hospitals, by law, are supposed to be clean. It would be a good idea to avoid Emergency Room bathrooms, as they often attract the most traffic. (Unfortunately, they are the most accessible). Depending on sphincter strength, it would benefit the Pooper to take the elevator and visit the I.C.U - usually the patients there will have their own bathrooms, so the &quot;public&quot; one will hardly be public at all. Just to exit one of these bathrooms, a person needs to sanitize themselves in a decompression chamber. Hospitals are discreetly busy, so the Pooper&apos;s presence won&apos;t even be noticed.

 Borders Bookstore - Borders is hit or miss and really depends on two factors: 1) the store manager, and 2) the neighborhood location of the store. If both are good, then the Pooper is in luck. Borders&apos; also vary in traffic, as some are extremely busy, while others are off-the-beaten-path. Visiting one of these locations in case of an emergency may be beneficial, or detrimental to the Pooper. But if the Pooper stumbles upon a quiet Borders in an affluent neighborhood, then they can be sure their experience will be remarkable.

 McDonald&apos;s/Chevron Gas Station Combo (or virtually any restaurant/gas station combo) - Typically, it&apos;d be wise to stay away from a gas station or a fast food restaurant, but combined they offer - legally - once of the cleanest and most pleasurable pooping experiences known to man. These joint operations are State enforced, and under extremely strict codes of operation. Officials routinely visit these establishments to ensure that they are up to code. The only potential downside is the traffic they draw, which is often a large amount. But in terms and availability and especially cleanliness, they&apos;re a sure bet.

 Office Depot/Office Max/Staples - These three draw the same clientele as one another (administrative and business driven people). They afford less foot traffic than a Best Buy, or a supermarket chain. The three combined provide availability (which is important) to the Pooper. And, simply said, these locations don&apos;t promote their Restrooms like restaurants (a person is almost expected to go to the bathroom there). A shopper at an Office Max, Office Depot, or Staples location is not interested in going to the bathroom. They&apos;re interesting in picking-up a three-hole puncher, and some coffee cups for the office. That&apos;s it. Consumers are in and out, no playing around. And while most office supply stores don&apos;t offer the fancy décor of, say, a Kohl&apos;s - they more than hold their weight in cleanliness, ambiguity, and availability.

Notice that with the exception of the gas station/fast food restaurant combo - all locations were relatively large, allowing the Pooper to blend in with the rest of the clientele. That should be a major consideration when deciding where to poop (although the Pooper may not have that luxury). While bathrooms in a Subway, or Burger King, or Starbucks may be clean, these locales are just way too small for a Pooper to slip in and out unnoticed. And that, after all, is the most important thing.
