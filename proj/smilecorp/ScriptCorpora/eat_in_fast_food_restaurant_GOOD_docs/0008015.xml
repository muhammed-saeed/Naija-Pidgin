 Ozark Billy, Meet Ozark Bill 
 September 15, 2011 
Since Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a family values Republican, has stumbled over a Penthouse Pet on his way to becoming our next governor, I thought I would bring to your attention the only Republican officially running against Missouri governor Jay Nixon at this time: Bill Randles .

Bill who?

That’s Bill Randles, from the little ol’“ Ozarks town of Springdale, Arkansas ,” who says he“ is still just a country boy at heart ,”who has“ never lost that Southern accent .”And, he says:
 
His garage is stacked with trout fishing gear and his mind is stacked full of ideas for how to make Missouri the standard to which all other states will aspire.
 
I think I know who the trout is in this scenario, and I say to the trout, watch out.

This latest Ozark Billy, let’s call him Ozark Bill, has been a minister and a Haarvard-trained big-city lawya (the big city was first St. Louis and then Kansas City) and perhaps most interesting:
 
But by the end of 2008, Bill’s professional focus changed.  After watching his former law school classmate, Barack Obama, run for president, and a mediocre career politician ride Obama’s coattails into the Missouri governor’s office, Bill decided it was finally time for him to reclaim the goals he had when he left Harvard.
 
Ozark Bill made this claim in his website bio:
 
Despite the liberal orthodoxy taught by most of Harvard’s esteemed professors, and swallowed whole by most of his classmates, the liberal teaching helped Bill to further analyze his own conservative views, to carefully understand and dissect the other side’s accounts of the world we live in, and to better articulate his own.  As a result, Bill left Harvard even more conservative than when he arrived.
 
Damn!  Those Harvard lefties didn’t fool this Ozarkian conservative! Why, he didn’t go to Harvard to swallow whole any of that liberal nonsense like the rest of his classmates, including Barack Obama. And he certainly didn’t go there to be one of them there mediocre career politicians like Jay Nixon. Rather than alter his Baptist-preacher worldview, those dumb liberals merely helped him sharpen his game as a future leader of our state!

In any case, those of us in Southwest Missouri may see this new Ozark Bill around here a lot, as he thinks a lot of us.  From CBS St. Louis :
 
…he says it’s important the party pick a candidate who energizes conservative Christian voters in southwest Missouri.

“If you go to the southwest part of the state, the buckle of the Bible belt, it’s the determining factor,” Randles said, “For a Republican in Missouri, if you can’t win the southwest part of the state, you can’t win.”

Randles was asked if those conservative Christian voters in southwest Missouri might stay home or even vote for Governor Nixon  — if faced with a choice between Nixon and Kinder.

“I do think that’s a factor that has to be considered, of course,” Randles said…
 
By the way, you can probably guess some of the policy positions of this brand of Billy, but in case you’re stumped :

 Fair Tax —check.

 Pro-bidness —check.

 Eliminate public-sector unions —check.

 School choice —check.

 Tort reform —check.

 Cut government and kill state agencies —check.

 Scale back eminent domain —check. (This one won’t come in time to help the woman standing in the way of constructing a new high school in Joplin, dang it.)

As I said, watch out trout!

 Arts&amp;Life 

 For The Grieving, A Thin Lifeline To The Departed Alps follows a foursome of people who act as substitutes for deceased loved ones — wearing the same clothes, imitating mannerisms, re-enacting life events. Critic Joel Arnold says the film&apos;s power comes from its focus on both those who&apos;ve lost love and those who never found it. (Recommended) Two Fractious Sisters, Reunited But Still At Odds Lucy (Mira Sorvino) and Jenny (Tammy Blanchard) are estranged sisters with opposite temperaments who reunite in Union Square, the first film in almost 10 years from Nancy Savoca. Critic Scott Tobias says that great dialogue and lead performances add life to a formulaic story. Science And The Paranormal, At Odds To The Finish Red Lights stars Sigourney Weaver and Cillian Murphy as two academics sparring with a psychic (Robert De Niro) whose powers they doubt. Critic Mark Jenkins says the film&apos;s one refreshing feature — its skeptical outlook — doesn&apos;t survive to the end. &apos;The Imposter&apos;: Tell Me Lies, Tell Me Sweet Little Lies Bart Layton&apos;s documentary tells the story of Frederic Bourdin, who joined the Barclay family by pretending to be their missing child. Critic Scott Tobias says that while Bourdin&apos;s story has been told before, Layton uncovers new layers of deception that makes his version a must-see. (Recommended) In A Conflicted India, A Doomed Romance Unfolds Trishna, an India-set adaptation of Thomas Hardy&apos;s Tess of the D&apos;Urbervilles, folds the heroine&apos;s various love interests into one conflicted suitor. Critic Ian Buckwalter says the film expertly conveys Tess&apos;social conflicts, while also giving its love story a feeling of inevitability. (Recommended) A Humble Servant, Watching As The Throne Totters Farewell, My Queen takes place in Versailles as the French Revolution approaches. But it focuses on Marie Antoinette&apos;s servant more than on the aristocracy. Critic Mark Jenkins says that approach makes the film more than a tale about doomed royalty; it&apos;s also about commoners on the verge of freedom.

The&apos;Political Animals&apos;Running Washington, D.C. Greg Berlanti&apos;s new series on the USA Network stars Sigourney Weaver as the secretary of state and former first lady.

McGlynn was a swimmer who turned to evangelical Christianity in college. A Door in the Ocean is a compelling coming-of-age story marked by random tragedy and biblical tracts, church coffee and chlorine.
