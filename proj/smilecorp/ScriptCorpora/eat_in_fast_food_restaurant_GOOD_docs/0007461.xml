 William Goh Contact Agent Answer Posted on Jan 27, 2012 Hi Potential Agent

Before you burn the bridge to embark into this industry, I urge that you have a savings of about 6 months. In this industry, the fastest to collect your commission is through rental transactions. As for sales transactions, you will receive your commissions about 3 months later. I have agents who close deals within 1 month while some is between 6 to 8 months.
On the other hand, you may wish to start off as a part-time agent to get a feel of this industry before switching to full time.
With the implentation of CEA (Council for Estate Agencies), all aspiring agents must take and pass RES (Real Estate Salesperson) course and join an agency which will register to apply for the license on your behalf from CEA (Council for Estate Agencies). In order to be a property agent, the min age is 21 yrs and must have 4 O level passes.
PropNex is one of the appointed training centres to conduct RES course and the course fee is $888. There are many other training centres offering RES course. You may visit the following website which provides a list of training providers for you to select:
www.cea.gov.sg
Currently PropNex offer refund of RES training fee up to max $888 (with receipt) after you joined the company and achieved:
(a) $10k commission within 6 months after registration with CEA;
(b) $20k commission within 12 months after registration with CEA.
After passing your RES, and before deciding which agency to join, i strongly urge you to speak to a few agencies to have a better understanding of their systems and network.
You are welcome to be part of our team Powerful Negotiators, the No. 1 team in PropNex with more than 800 agents, a platform which provides you with effective networking. In our team, you will never work alone. We also have our own Realtime web system with listings (free leads), in detail (full address with unit no) for you to kick-start and to match buyers. All of us have pw to access to the system. Once you are part of our Team, you can immediately use all the listings to match your buyers already.
I am successful today because i was fortunate to have found the right team 5 years ago. Previously, i was from logistic industry and when i join this industry, after my early retirement, i dont have any experience in sales at all. Now i am leading a team of 40+ agents.
Pls feel free to drop me a mail if you need any clarification.
