 MAKE EATING ON THE RUN HEALTHY 

What is the major reason why many people don’t eat healthy?  Lack of time.

Fast food restaurants are on every street corner.  It’s available, cheap and filling.

What should you do?

 Watch portion sizes. Have a small portion of what you crave. Don’t deprive yourself.  Order a kid’s meal if you have the need to satisfy that greasy meal craving. Look for chains that have sandwiches on whole wheat bread or that offer wraps or salads.  Most restaurants now offer low-fat and low-calorie options. Combine healthy side items to create a meal. Order a side salad.  The side salad will fill you up and provide some vitamins and fiber to balance the meal. Order a grilled chicken sandwich and hold one portion of the bun and the mayo. Stop at the grocery store for your food break.  Many stores now have healthy, prepared items you pick up on the run. Make sure you put items your car such as bottled water and healthy snacks.  This helps when you kow your day is going to be hectic.  You won’t be as tempted to pull into a fast-food restaurant drive-thru. When you feel hungry, grab a bottle of water and drink it.  More often than not, your body is actually craving hydration not food.  You will find that your hunger pangs will go away. 

These are a few things you can incorporate into your daily schedule when you find you are on the run.

It takes a combination of both exercise, eating healthy, and knowing how to lose weight the right way.  I believe I have found right weight loss program.

The weight loss program is called Strip That Fat.  You can read my full review here!
