 June 11, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Tonya Munoz ( 2 reviews ) My family and I love Chacho&apos;s. We had never been to this one so it was close and we went. At first sight we thought kids would have a great time haveing a very large play area When we got in I had a different oppion. I have never been to a family restaurant when there is a police office standing at the order line. This restaurant was pretty dirty and the staff argued openly in front of us as we ordered. We ordered tacos kids wanted pizza perfect we thought. When we asked how many slices a large pizza gives. Employee say&quot;I don&apos;t know buy it and and find out&quot; We as a family think the feeling if a restaurant is as important as the food. Not the case here. We are no one to gudge people by the way they look, however we did feel uncomfortable here. We will not be back here. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful March 15, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it GROSS, DIRTY AND SMELLY by angelnsatx ( 25 reviews ) We will never eat there again. It was dirty, it smelled really bad and the food was just plain un-appetizing. The parents of all those kids that just let them run around like animals, screaming, fighting and crying, should be ashamed of themselves, but for management to allow this is just plain dangerous and un-appealing to other customers that just want to eat. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if someone got seriously injured in that death-trap of a play-place. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful April 11, 2012 Likes it Best Margarita in SA by Duke G. ( 3 reviews ) The food was great, and the Margaritas were awesome! October 26, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Chacho&apos;s Nachos by Food Addict ( 36 reviews ) Apparently people started getting shot here so now my grandma doesn&apos;t really want to go back, but that&apos;s okay I guess since the only good thing I&apos;ve really had here was their nachos. Too bad though, they are REALLY good nachos. Plus with the play area there, all the little brats I mean kids... are screaming at the top of their lungs the entire time you are there. January 29, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Lisa Holt ( 4 reviews ) I always get my food here to go...love the king kong nachos and the shredded chicken burrito is delicious. The ingredients are are fresh and the portion is enormous. Get your burrito double sloppy. ;-) October 24, 2009 Likes it OK not thrilled by benhunted ( 194 reviews ) The food was ok, not somewhere I see myself going to frequently or giving a glowing recommendation for. So-so overall. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful March 25, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Kerri Hernandez ( 1 review ) You will not find better food for the price. Delicious, fun atmosphere, and open 24 hours! My husband and I eat here all the time when we come into town. Greatest nachos con picadillo ever! March 5, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by DeeDee ( 2 reviews ) I was reccomened this restaurant by a coworker, but I would definitely NOT recommend this restaurant!! When u walk in no one is there to tell u how u order, then when u walk up to the counter to ask, it STINKS horribly!! Very DIRTY environment !! We still ate there since it was 11 pm and did not know the area for another restaurant that would have been open!! So we order, everythings cool then my hubbs orders a michelada and the guy doesn&apos;t even know what that is!! So we go to the bar, my hubbs orders 2 of them and is told the limit is one!! So he goes back up the bar is closed, then back to the front, still the cashier has no idea!! So he orders 2 beers, and how is that when the bartender said limit 1!! So I personally go to the bar and tell the guy&quot;my hubbs is trying to order 2 micheladas and the ppl up front don&apos;t know what it is!!&quot;so he tells us to hold on, he finishes doing whatever he&apos;s doing then gets us our glasses!! Soo Long story short.. Do NOT waste ur time and as in any restaurant I have now learned if it STINKS definitely just walk out don&apos;t eat there!!! November 13, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it dirty, food was bad... by Amanda Jamma ( 127 reviews ) ..i heard people get shot here a lot? but mostly, in case the title didn&apos;t tip you off, the food is LOUSY. Somehow my Mexican friends keep dragging me here? Not sure why...the margaritas come from a slurpee machine&amp;the chicken is over-seasoned&amp;kind of dry in every dish I&apos;ve had it in. I&apos;ve lived in Mexico...food is not authentic at ALL. Taco Tote is a good alternative if you&apos;re looking for a place with a good salsa bar. Plenty of other places have Margaritas that are actually GOOD, without the worries of a potential gunshot wound (Mi Tierra, SoLuna). February 7, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Brittany S ( 8 reviews ) Horrible food. Ordered a chicken quesidilla and was served what I would describe as two tortillas with a few pieces of chicken and some cheese in between. January 1, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Big Ben ( 16 reviews ) Good food, service leaves a great deal to be desired. March 6, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Rob Kenworthy ( 10 reviews ) This place has the best maragarita I&apos;ve ever had the 1800!! And food portions are very generous! Service is average to poor but you don&apos;t go here for the service it&apos;s all about the food and drinks! Great loose environmnet easy to bring 20 friends plus no wait for tables and they have a diverse menu. December 13, 2009 Likes it Chaotic but Yummy by Miranda ( 15 reviews ) Everytime I have gone to Chacho&amp;Chalucci&apos;s it is filled to the brim with people. There is a huge selection of Tex-Mex favorites on the menu. I love the carne asada nachos and the carne guisada tacos. The meat on both items is well flavored, and the meat is always tender. I love their tortillas harina (flour); they are big, and fluffy! It has a self-serve drink fountain and a salsa bar. The salsas are great! There is salsa verde, salsa roja, mango salsa, a thicker picante sauce, a simmered salsa and a pico de gallo availabe, all for free! Oh, and the backery is not to be overlooked. I love the chocolate cake and it costs less than $3 for a huge slice. I don&apos;t know what flavoring or extract they put in the chocolate cake, but I love it! The seating area is huge with long tables, that everyone must share. I like the huge flatscreens spread around the room. Whenever there is a Mexican soccer team playing, the room is filled with noise! A+ August 19, 2011 Mobile review by Vincent ( 4 reviews ) The first time I came here the food was mediocre at best, I ordered bean tacos and wasn&apos;t impressed. I only went because it was open. The second time I went there I went with four other people. No one talked about how good the food was or how much they enjoyed it. But thats not the worst part. Within the twenty minute ride home two of us felt some rumbles in our stomachs...by the time we got home we were both sick with two of the other people saying they didnt feel good, but not quite as bad as me and my friend. So never again! I can&apos;t say much about the crime, I&apos;ve never experiences it. Guess I got lucky. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it at all. The place is filthy. We had to switch tables because the first one we sat at was sticky. We watched the people cleanthe tables and in all honesty, they don&apos;t clean the tables. Just pick up the plates and the cups and move on to the next one. Go at your own risk. July 14, 2009 Likes it Mobile review by BILLY BOBZ ( 7 reviews ) I just went there a few days ago, staff as nice as ever. Playground was fine. And there were like five people mopping so that covers that. Otherwise the food is deliciso! June 18, 2009 Mobile review by Charlie Sullivan ( 3 reviews ) People get shot there a lot January 12, 2010 Likes it Great for Consuming Mass Quantities by GuyWhoLikesFood ( 24 reviews ) I hate to admit liking this place. It is almost always crowded and noisey. The food is not authentic at all; it is pure Tex-Mex with everything smothered in sour cream and cheese. There are basically two reasons to go: (1) huge mountains of food for cheap; and (2) High octane margaritas. A full order of nachos here will feed a family of four. The same goes for any of the deserts. The margaritas come in three categories: regular; top shelf; and cuervo 1800 gold. The regular margaritas are decent but I usually go for the top shelf because it is much better for a little extra. If you are like me and hate large crowds, go in the afternoon when it is not so crowded; feed the wife a top shelf margarita and that will put her in the mood to take care of the rest of the evening&apos;s entertainment (if you know what I mean). Now I remember what I like about this place! 1 out of 2 found this review helpful March 30, 2009 Likes it Wow, great deal by help ( 4 reviews ) We ate here for the first time on Saturday evening. Good food, good price, amazing deals for dessert. Most places would sell that as a whole cake. Double layer german chocolate cake.. huge for 1.99 The kids loved the play structure(indoor) I loved the salsa bar... mango pico all by itself. 24/7 Good breakfast too. July 14, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Amy ( 1 review ) It was very dirty, staff was not friendly, the playground area was falling apart and the food wasn&apos;t worth the price March 19, 2010 Likes it It&apos;s all about expectations by Sergio Mendez ( 1 review ) First off, Chacho&apos;s and Challuci&apos;s is NOT, nor does it sell itself as an&quot;authentic&quot;Mexican quiet dining restaurant. What C&amp;C&apos;s is is an unpretentious&quot;something-for-everyone&quot;24 hour fast food Tex Mex joint. It&apos;s a sort of Chuck-E-Cheese for grownups. Cheap food and drink, generous portions, and a variety of entertainment for kids and adults alike. The location itself is a two-story building located just off the highway on the north side of San Antonio. It features a stage for live music and DJs, a dance floor, a full bar (open after 5), a massive kid&apos;s play area, billiard tables, and a patio area for outdoor dining. Same may consider it tacky; I call it unpretentious. Service: It&apos;s a fast food restaurant. You do most of the leg work. Everytime I&apos;ve been there, the cleaning staff have been pretty good about pre-bussing tables and keeping the place tidy. The food itself is ready in a fairly short amount of time from when it&apos;s ordered.

Everytime I&apos;ve been there, the cleaning staff have been pretty good about pre-bussing tables and keeping the place tidy. The food itself is ready in a fairly short amount of time from when it&apos;s ordered. However, they could probably do a better job of keeping their menus stocked and available for customers. A few times I&apos;ve had to go up to the ordering counters to retrieve the menus that customers take up there with them. Food quality: It&apos;s not authentic Mexican food. You&apos;ll be hard pressed to find a&quot;Mexican&quot;restaurant in San Antonio that didn&apos;t serve primarily Tex-Mex fare. That said, it&apos;s definitely on the higher end of the fast food quality scale. Some of their entrees, however, are quite on the decadent side; with their massive helpings of cheese and sour cream piled on, Nachos can wreak havoc on anything but the strongest of stomachs. If I can make a recommendation, though, the grilled fish tacos are surprisingly top notch. Served on corn tortillas and with a savory avocado salsa; the fish tacos are probably my favorite dish on the menu. Portions: This is one thing that C&amp;C&apos;s definitely does not skimp out on. As any stoner on a budget can tell you, five dollars is enough to come out with a full stomach. The King Kong nachos will easily feed a family of 6-8 people. Overall, it&apos;s a fun place to take the family during the day and a cool after-work or after-club hangout with friends. It&apos;s not exactly a place for anniversaries or first dates; unless you both have a good sense of humor. If you&apos;re looking for fine-dining or real Mexican food, this is not the place.
