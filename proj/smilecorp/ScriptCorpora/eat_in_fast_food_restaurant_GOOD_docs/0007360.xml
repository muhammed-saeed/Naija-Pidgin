Breakfast on the Go?

While high-fat, high-calorie breakfasts abound at the nation&apos;s fast-food restaurants, most chains offer at least one or two healthier items -- if you must fill up at a drive-through. Cruise our photo gallery of the worst offenders and better choices to fuel your day. WebMD doesn’t endorse these &quot;better bets&quot; for everyone, since some still may be too high in sodium or calories for your diet.
 
McDonald&apos;s: Worst Choice

Take a pass on McDonald&apos;s Big Breakfast with Hot Cakes . It&apos;ll weigh you down with 1,090 calories, 56 g fat, and 19 g saturated fat -- close to the daily limit for this unhealthy fat. Even the biscuit is loaded with saturated fat, topping even the sausage patty or eggs. The sodium hits 2,150 mg, nearly the daily limit.
 
McDonald&apos;s: Better Bet

The Egg McMuffin is a better choice under the golden arches at 300 calories, 12 g fat, 5 g saturated fat, and 2 g fiber. Lean Canadian bacon offers protein and a meaty taste with very little fat. In any restaurant, ask for the nutrition information. Items with some fiber and protein will keep you satisfied for hours.  Sodium watchers take note: the Egg McMuffin has 820 mg.
 
Burger King: Worst Choice

Skip the Double Croissan’wich with Double Sausage , which comes in at 700 calories, 49 g fat, 18 g saturated fat, and 1,510 mg sodium. Burger King stacks two sausage patties, double cheese, and fried eggs on a giant buttery croissant bun. This high-calorie, high-fat sandwich contains almost a day’s worth of total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.
 
Burger King: Better Bet

The Egg and Cheese Croissan’wich offers fast-food taste at a nutritional cost that many people can afford: 320 calories, 16 g fat, and 7 g of saturated fat. The sodium content may be a tough fit for restricted diets at 690 mg. Eleven grams of protein will help keep you feeling full until lunch.
 
Jack in the Box: Worst Choice

Steer clear of the Steak&amp;Egg Burrito with Fire Roasted Salsa. Jack in the Box loads a flour tortilla with scrambled eggs, steak, greasy hash browns, and cheese. It contains a whopping 821 calories, 50 g fat, and 15 g saturated fat, along with 1,544 mg of sodium. The burrito does provide 38 grams of protein, if you don&apos;t mind eating 50 grams of fat along with it.
 
Jack in the Box: Better Bet

The Breakfast Jack has better nutrition numbers than many breakfast choices with 283 calories, 11 g fat, 4 g saturated fat, and 16 g of protein to fuel your day. As with most fast-food items, the sodium could be a problem for some at 780 mg. The Breakfast Jack is simply a hamburger bun with fried egg, ham, and American cheese.
 
Skip Carl’s Jr. for Breakfast

The Breakfast Burger leads an unhealthy parade at Carl&apos;s Jr. It&apos;s a tall stack of beef, egg, bacon, cheese, and hash brown nuggets -- adding up to 810 calories, 42 g fat, 16 g saturated fat, and 1,480 mg of sodium. The Loaded Breakfast Burrito adds sausage to the same fatty list of ingredients for equally bad nutrition numbers. French Toast Dips have less saturated fat but too much total fat and calories to be recommended.
 
Dunkin’ Donuts: Worst Choices

Stay away from the high fat Sausage Egg and Cheese Croissant (710 calories, 48 g fat, 19 g saturated fat, 1,370 mg sodium), as well as the Sausage Egg and Cheese Bagel (690 calories, 35 g fat, 13 g saturated fat, and 1,650 mg sodium).
 
Dunkin&apos; Donuts: Better Bets

The Egg and Cheese on an English Muffin sandwich comes in at 320 calories, 15 g fat, 5 g saturated fat, 14 g protein, 1 g fiber, and 820 mg of sodium. The protein will help will keep you going strong through the morning. Choose a wheat bagel to bump up the fiber to 5 grams.
 
Starbucks: Worst Choice

The Cranberry Orange Scone is one of several high-fat, sugary treats at Starbucks that probably won&apos;t keep you full until lunch, despite a hefty calorie count. Indulgences like this icing-topped scone vary in flavorings by restaurant, but any scone is a buttery affair. This one contains 490 calories, 18 g fat, 2 g fiber, and 8 g protein. Note that the saturated fat -- 9 grams -- is 45% of the daily limit.
 
Starbucks: Better Bets

The Spinach&amp;Feta Breakfast Wrap caters nicely to health-conscious commuters in a hurry. It&apos;s easy to eat out of hand and contains just 290 calories, 10 g fat, and 3.5 g of saturated fat. Ample protein (19 g) and fiber (6 g) help keep you full. Perfect Oatmeal is another good choice at 140 calories. Or try the Greek Yogurt Honey Parfait with 300 calories.
 
Subway: Worst Choice

The 6&quot; Sunrise Subway Melt can be problematic on some low-calorie diets. Turkey, bacon, ham, cheese, and eggs do provide 32 grams of hunger-quenching protein. And the egg white option (seen here) trims some fat. But the total calories and fat run high. The regular version has 470 calories, 17 g total fat, 7 g saturated fat, and a whopping 1,590 mg of sodium. The egg white version shaves off 40 calories, 4 g total fat, and 2 g of saturated fat.
 
Subway: Better Bets

The Egg White&amp;Cheese Sandwich is a better choice at Subway with 150 calories, 3.5 g fat, 1.5 g saturated fat, 12 g protein, 480 mg sodium, and 5 g fiber. It comes on a light wheat English muffin for a healthy high-protein, high-fiber, portable meal.  Add tomatoes, green peppers, cucumbers, or other low-cal choices from Subway&apos;s famous spread of toppings to boost the flavor.
 
Benefits of a Healthy Morning Meal

Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day -- it gives you energy to start the day and is linked to many health benefits. Studies show that eating a healthy breakfast can help give you a nutritionally complete diet, higher in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals; better weight control; improved concentration and performance in the classroom or the boardroom; more strength and energy to engage in physical activity; and lower cholesterol levels.
 
Bottom Line on Breakfast

If you find yourself at a fast-food chain in the morning, always opt for the healthiest breakfast options, or eat a smaller portion and save the other half. You can eat out healthfully, but nothing compares to the numerous breakfast options at home, from an egg and whole-wheat toast to a whole-grain breakfast parfait with fruit and yogurt. Short on time? Pack it the night before and take it along with you.
