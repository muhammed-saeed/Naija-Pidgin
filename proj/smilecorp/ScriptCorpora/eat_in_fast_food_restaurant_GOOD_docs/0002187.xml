The Best Oatmeals at Fast-Food Restaurants
 
Find out which fast food oatmeals are the healthiest.

If you’re going to a fast-food restaurant for breakfast, oatmeal is likely to be among the healthiest picks. Oatmeal is fiber-rich and contains protein—two key nutrients that will help keep you feeling full and satisfied until lunch. And no matter what type you choose, quick-cooking, steel-cut and rolled oats are equally healthy nutrition-wise—and can take mere minutes to cook.

Here’s a look at just how healthy—or unhealthy—the oatmeal is at some common fast-food restaurants and 4 of the healthiest choices to order. These chain restaurants’ oatmeal choices clock in at under 500 calories (some even well under), which (depending on how many calories you are, or should be, consuming) can fit into a healthy diet. For comparison, a plain 1-cup serving (cooked with water) DIY version at home delivers about 166 calories, 4 g fat, 1 g saturated fat, 9 mg sodium, 4 g fiber, 6 g protein.
