 Okay, but needs work

Like the game play idea; however, at times its hard to put items on the burgers and hotdogs. Also there have been times it takes me 4 or 5 times to get the burger on the bun. There is no way to keep the customers happy in between fixing food either. Many customers just leave. Game can be frustrating. I&apos;ve bought all the upgrades but can&apos;t make the goal very often. Please just work on fine tuning to make not so frustrating otherwise it would be a good game.
 
 Rotation fixed!
