Yes this will be the best non-homemade vegetarian burrito you&apos;ll ever have.

Yes you&apos;ll enjoy the crunch of the cabbage, carrot, and lettuce mixed with the flour tortilla, beans, cheese, and rice.

No, you won&apos;t ever think of going anywhere else for a burrito in this neighborhood.

This is good, clean food and it appears to be lovingly prepared. Everything is fresh and each item is cooked to order.  Those who like greasy Mexican food will be disappointed. I ordered a burrito today with just freshly grilled chicken, black beans, guacamole. No Rice and No Cheese.
My burrito was perfect. Exactly as ordered and I didn&apos;t feel stuffed nor did I feel I was a new candidate for a coronary.  I like the salsa bar. They have a good selection of cilantro-free items, including a delicious mango salsa and just some plain diced, ripe tomatoes and onions.

Super Delish!! It&apos;s a no frills spot with fresh food and an authentic taste. My favorites here are the Border Tacos and Burrito. The steak and chicken are cooked to perfection.... not dried out like Poquito Mas.
For a special treat try the spinach and mushroom quesadilla..... mmmm cheesy goodness!!

Also, bring cash... no cards accepted.

Complete Fan of Eduardo&apos;s!! It&apos;s definitely not a &quot;date&quot; place, but a great mexican place... I always get the Fish Tacos w/ grilled corn, Never failed me on a hungry day.
They have great &quot;help-yourself&quot; sauce bar, try the Mango spicy sauce (it&apos;s NEW!), with a bit of cilantro, it&apos;ll make your free chips taste like they were an extra side dish.
It is CASH only though, so bring your greens.

I come here a lot, and I only get one of two things: the fish burrito or the tostada salad. Those two things are excellent, but I find the chicken dry and overcooked here.

And who says this place is cheap? I&apos;d say it&apos;s either right in line with or even a little more than Poquito mas, Baja Fresh, etc. Speaking of prices, given that it&apos;s cash only and the lady at the register is no flash gordon, it might be wise to alter the pricing of the menu items so that the change isn&apos;t so awkward. A fish burrito is $7.52 after tax. C&apos;mon, you don&apos;t want to make 48 cents change, and I don&apos;t want to carry it.

I was there last week with my girlfriend, she said it was a great place.
Had the border Burrito with chicken.
As you walk in you can tell this place is an institution. It feels like it&apos;s been around for ages.
The food is grand, it has the cheap diner feel about it; but great portion size and tasty.
I would have no problem in going there again.
It is cash only, but a couple of doors down there is an ATM.

THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD.  I eat it like once a week.  AMAZING FOOD.  I AM WRITING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE I GET EXCITED JUST THINKING ABOUT EATING AN EDUARDO&apos;S BURRITO.

All kidding aside this place has really good burritos, definitely the best in West LA and possibly in the city.  I always get the Original Burrito so I can&apos;t really comment on the other items but it is amazing.  The Salsa Verde in their salsa bar is also really good.

Be advised, parking SUCKS, it closes on the earlier side (9:30PM), and it is CASH ONLY.  The being said I don&apos;t care about any of that since it&apos;s so good.  Also, if it&apos;s like 9:15 and you&apos;re worried it might close before you get there, fear not!  Pho Citi (also good) is in the same shopping center and open 24-hours.

Best Mexican in town.  All of the burritos are fabulous; I love the vegetarian burrito with black beans even though I am not a vegetarian.  The chips and salsa are yummy and fresh.

CASH ONLY.  Parking stinks, but I have always been able to find a spot.

This is a small eatery in a strip mall but it has really good food... and the salsa bar kicks...munch down on the southwest burrito(i prefer carne) and you can&apos;t go wrong... don&apos;t forget to dress it up at the salsa bar...
I have some friends that drive from San Gabriel Valley regularly to eat at Eduardos...
don&apos;t forget to bring cash and it does get crowded around the lunch hour...

If you are in the mood for huge portions of food for a reasonable price, this is the place to go. I had the Original Burrito with steak, Ranchero Style (a very smart decision!). And when I say steak burrito, I don&apos;t mean the burritos at Chipotle that barely has one piece of meat, but instead a TON of meat! My buddies got the the Original Burrito with chicken, and it was the same deal.

They also have a salsa bar with fresh made salsa. Tried their Spicy Mango salsa... not really for me but its nice to see them trying to spice things up, no pun intended.

I will definitely be going back sometime, need to try the tacos!

Oh and make sure you bring cash, since they take no plastics!

Being a blue eyed guera who has a fondness for all things Mexican (in terms of food) I was excited to try this place.  Went with my assistant manager who is El Salvadorian and evidently a regular.  Ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was muy delicioso.  The chicken had great flavor and I loved how there was guacamole in the quesadilla.  Also found the salsa bar very full and fresh.  I don&apos;t think there is a bathroom here and parking was easy when we were there...

Here&apos;s the thing.  I tried this for the first time super hung over, on the recommendation that they had great carne asada.

From the outside, it looks like a super standard over-Americanized burrito shop, right at home in a strip mall, but if, for some reason, you&apos;re lured inside, you&apos;re in for a little surprise.

The carne asada border burrito is one of the greatest steak burritos I&apos;ve had.  I typically shy away from mass grilled carne asada because it tends to come out dry, but this stuff was great.  Plus, they&apos;ve got a pretty robust salsa bar, including a delicious little mango salsa.

Unfortunately, I tried a few other things and I was pretty disappointed.  Their chicken tacos are plain, their chicken quesadillas are also pretty boring.  I wouldn&apos;t waste my time on these, but the carne asada border burrito is definitely worth a visit!

One of the earlier remains of the taco places after Mrs. Garcias and La Salsa, back when la salsa was still using American cheese on their burritos, ick. Anyways, I think some of the newer spots like baja fresh and poquito mas have improved the product in some areas and not others.  I really wish Eddie&apos;s used freshly made tortillas.  Anyhoo, I think that Eddie&apos;s has some of the better quality beef and chicken, especially the beef marinate. A pretty darn good selection of salsa&apos;s (but I think poquito mas has it beat).  The items that I really enjoy though are the one&apos;s that aren&apos;t found in the other westernized burrito joints, specifically the spinach and mushroom quesadilla, but really my favorite is the shrimp burrito.  I like the shrimp marinate tons.  On that topic, the rice has a pretty good flavor too it as well.  I wish these places served breakfast burritos. Every once in awhile I&apos;ve seen Eddie&apos;s open for breakfast, but it can&apos;t be a money maker so he must waffle, hee hee, speaking of breakfast -  &quot;waffle&quot;.

I&apos;ve seen their food catered cooked to order at weddings, which I think is a pretty novel idea, just have no idea how much it costs.

Owner is pretty nice. I hear an ex-employee stole the menu and opened up a joint in SF, don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any truth to that rumor.

Hanging out with a group of friends on a Saturday. Our stomachs were growling and they suggested we check out Eduardo&apos;s. Cool, I love Mexican food! One group of friends got there before my group which was awesome since the place was packed! They ordered and got a table while me and my buddy waited in line. I ordered my food, paid, and went to be seated. We&apos;re all seated, chatting, and waiting on our food. Then, the owner approaches our table, looks over the group, and to my face, tells me I didn&apos;t pay for my food! WTH?!? I told him I had and even told how I paid and the change I got back. He still persisted I didn&apos;t pay and I was getting away with a free meal. Guess it was so busy he didn&apos;t collect money from someone; had to blame somebody, and since I was the only non-caucasian in the group, I was a good scape goat. I&apos;ve never stolen anything in my life and this was quite embarrassing. Need less to say, horrible customer service and I will never support this place again. No bueno.

Delicious burritos crafted for a gringo palate. Everything was delicious on the taco bar we ordered - from the soft sharp cheddar, to the well-seasoned chicken, to the crispy/fresh tortilla shell. And, it&apos;s owned from a fellow Jew apparently - which it totally neat.

I dunno what all the hype is about. How can someone give this place a 5 star rating? My wife ordered the enchiladas and I ordered their signature burrito with special sauce and I thought both were above average but no where near 5 stars. There was way too much cheese on both the enchiladas and burrito (and I love cheese). From a distance the plate looked like a really greasy cheese pizza. The carne asada was overcooked and dry (think flavorful beef jerkey).  Their salsa was really good though. Overall, there&apos;s nothing special about this place... I would equate Eduardo&apos;s Border Grill with Poquito Mas down the street.

The burrito is ok.  Seems more like a privately owned version of a Baja Fresh.  Good enough to consider having every once in a while, but man.  Why can&apos;t they have San Diego style burritos up in LA?

When you need a quick bite of vegetarian protein- this is the place to go.  The bean burrito is packed with beans, vegetables, and lettuce.  I actually like this burrito more than Poquito Mas.  The salsa bar is fresh and stocked nicely too.  You can wash your car at the nearby carwash while you grad a quick bite.  All in all- a good solid fast mexican spot.

GREAT tasting food. it may not be the most authentic mexican food (for that, check out campos tacos), but it sure tastes great. salsa is pretty good to. it reminds me a bit of the taquerias in sf mission district. not dirt cheap, but quite reasonably priced. in and around westwood, this is one of the better and higher quality stops for mexican take-out

The burritos and tacos are pretty good.  Ingredients are fresh, but it wasn&apos;t anything exceptionally mind-blowing.  I really liked that they use black beans rather than refried beans.  Prices are average (6-7 for a burrito, 2-3 for a taco) and they only accept cash, but the salsas are awesome.  The spicy mango salsa left deliciously lingering heat in the back of your throat.  The fire roasted salsa was really yummy too.

I&apos;ve long kept this place as my secret hidden gem...Eduardo&apos;s is my go-to for amazing (and healthy) Mexican food. This is not the type of restaurant you go to for atmosphere but strictly for fresh and delicious Mexican food.

It is located in a strip mall and no they don&apos;t have table service but this is a perfect spot for a weekday casual dinner. The portions are huge! They are cash only...so remember that before you go.

I dream about the Grilled Veggie Salad with Grilled Shrimp added and their huge selection of salsas. So delicious...

Eduardo&apos;s is a quick walk from the office, but I didn&apos;t find out it until recently. One lazy day I was craving a burrito like crazy... As I&apos;m not familiar with Westwood, a co-worker recommended Eduardo&apos;s, and I sauntered down Westwood Blvd. to this lovely little cantina.

The lady behind the counter was a little...well, snappy, but it was more old-lady character than being legitimately angry or rude. She&apos;s a badass.

For being Mexican food...Eduardo&apos;s IS a little pricey, but it&apos;s worth it. Expect to pay somewhere in the $8-$10 range for a burrito, salads and plates are a little more expensive. Which kind of gets to me; perhaps I need to stop frequenting taco trucks, they&apos;re skewing my perception of what&apos;s acceptable for lunch prices.

My go-to here is the border burrito with steak, which is sooo tasty. The steak is juicy and a little crisp from the grill, which is just the way I like it. The salsa bar puts La Salsa&apos;s to shame, especially with the spicy as heck mango variety.

If you go during the lunch hour, be prepared to pay for street parking, as the free parking lot is packed from about 11:30-2. Evenings are a little better, and they&apos;re open late-ish!

Anytime I crave a burrito and nachos on the West Side, I head over to Eduardos.  Located in a strip mall next to a Fantastic Sam&apos;s and a cheap Sushi joint, Eduardo&apos;s is a great destination for lunch or dinner.  I always order their Border Burrito with steak with a side of pico de gaulo.  Their nachos are also really great- tasty, filling, messy, everything they should be!

Fresh, cheap and fast.  Superior to Chipotle in flavor and much cheaper.

Not quite as good as Taco Zone or other questionable taco trucks in terms of complex flavor or price, but Eduardo&apos;s has a much higher level of sanitation standards that those joints.  Eduardo&apos;s is fresh and uses black beans, while those other places have a more complex/authentic flavor but use lower quality ingredients.  It is a trade off I am undecided on.  Considering I live a block from Eduardo&apos;s -- I&apos;m here frequently.

Salsa bar is no joke.

Good college-age date spot after the dinner rush.  Cheap, casual, and impressively good.

This is my 2nd favorite Mexican place in all of LA. It&apos;s extremely addicting. What makes this place amazing is the chopped skirt steak and freshly made salsa they use in their burritoes.  The border burrito is the best in town.  While big, the burritoes don&apos;t make you fee sick because everything is fresn and not too greasy.  I love the tortillas they use...although they break easily.  They have excellent orchad as well

Great fresh Mexican food!  They&apos;ll even make it healthier for you (whole wheat tortilla, etc.) if you&apos;d like.  If you go for lunch during the week, be sure to say &quot;Hi&quot; to Edith at the cash register.  She&apos;s a sweetie!

Best burritos in California outside of the Mission district in San Francisco. The ingredients are fresh, the portions generous, and the friendly staff greet everyone like a regular. The Border Burrito with chicken is delicious. Make it healthier with the whole wheat tortilla option.

BEST FLAVORFUL CARNE ASADA BURRITOS IN THE 310. Not to mention, the BEST SALSA BAR in all of West LA or LA for that matter. I love the burritos at Eduardo&apos;s. The pico de gallo salsa is chunky and plentiful and the chile rojo is mamasita smokin&apos; HOT that you can send smoke signals to the folks in the 818 area code.  Eduardo&apos;s takes care of patrons by serving flavorful, meaty tacos and burritos. The place is known for packing on a lot of steak in their tacos, which they mildly garnish with cilantro and onions.

I wandered in this place while my car received a good cleansing next door.  I went for the carne asada tacos and I have to say, they were seriously tasty.  Great salsa, too.  The ambience here could be better but the tacos hit the spot!

Solid 3.5 stars.  Finally, a decent place to get Mexican food near UCLA.  The food here is not much to rave about, but for what and where it is, it does an admirable job.

I got the regular steak burrito, which has onions, tomatoes, guacamole, and according to the menu, melted cheese, which I personally could not taste or see.   The best part of the burrito is the steak which is good quality and grilled well.  You can really taste the charbroiled flavor of the grill.  It really elevates an otherwise mediocre burrito.

The salsa bar had a lot of variety, though the salsa all tasted equally mild to me.  There was no kick but luckily  there was flavor.  My two favorites are the roasted chile salsa and whatever the next spiciest one down is.

Overall, I&apos;d come here again for the shear convenience of the location.  For those who claim this is the best burrito you&apos;ve had, I ask compared to what?  Chipotle?  If this is your gold standard for Mexican food, please  venture out of the west side and find real Mexican food.  It&apos;ll blow your mind.  Border Grill is only a slight step up from Rubio&apos;s or Baja Fresh.  Still good though.

Went here for a Friday lunch after a week full of healthy eating, and it did not disappoint. I got the spicy steak burrito - no rice, no beans, no cheese (personal choice). Yee-ha!!! My coworker suggested that there is such a thing as the &apos;best steak burrito&apos; and Eduardo&apos;s makes it. I don&apos;t believe in absolutes, but this burrito was really, really, really good.
