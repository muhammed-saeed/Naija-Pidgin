Rooms To Go Furniture Complaint – Poor Quality Furniture and Horrible Customer Service Support
 By cuse3210 
 





On October 28 th , I purchased a recliner couch and recliner loveseat.  My girlfriend and I were really excited to be able to purchase and enjoy brand new furniture, but disaster what awaiting us right around the corner.  We had purchased this living room furniture from Rooms To Go, brand new out of the box.

A few days later on November 2 nd , I went to sit on the edge of the couch and I heard something snap.  I then stood up and opened the recliner to see what that snap was.  When I looked under the seat, I found that the piece of wood snapped.  I couldn’t believe this would happen especially it was brand new!

I then had to call 1(800)766-6786 the next day since they had closed at 6p.m.  The next day when I called the customer service number, I had to explain to the representative what happened and he couldn’t believe what happened.  He had to put me on hold for a little while because he had to speak to someone about the problem.

When he returned to the phone, he told me that they could send a service technician to come look at the couch.  He was able to have the service technician come out that Saturday, October 6 th .  When I had asked what time frame he would be coming, he told me that I would receive a phone call on Friday which would be to let me know the time.  I really needed to know because I had to work in the afternoon on Saturday.

Today, I received a phone call from my parents because Rooms To Go had called the secondary number on the account.  The reason they had my parents number and house address is because I applied for the Rooms To Go credit card.  In order to apply for the credit card, I needed to supply my parents address because I have only lived in my apartment for a year and a half.  I called rooms To Go back and was put on with Diana in which I had to explain what was happening.

Diana was able to change the address on the account for me.  The salesman that sold us the couch and loveseat told me that it didn’t matter that they had my parents home address down because it wasn’t being delivered.  When I was speaking with Diana she told me that I wouldn’t be able to have someone come tomorrow (Saturday) because my parent’s home address was in the next zip code over.  My parents don’t live any more than 25 minutes away from me.

The earliest date that a service technician would be able to come out to my apartment wouldn’t be until 2 weeks from now.  I told Diana that we just bought the couch and have yet to enjoy the couch because of this problem.  She told me that she was very sorry, but I am still pissed off because I wanted to have my family and friends over to show them the brand new living room furniture.

I would not recommend anyone buying furniture from Rooms To Go because of the horrible customer service and the poor quality of the furniture.
