 Ruby&apos;s Diner makes big beef change 

January 19th, 2011, 3:24 am· ·posted by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 
 

Irvine-based Ruby’s Diner is changing the kind of beef it serves.

The chain is switching to natural beef to satisfy a growing consumer demand for a“cleaner”and“richer”beef  product. The beef comes from cattle raised naturally (hormone and antibiotic free) and fed on pastured grass, natural grains, legumes and corn, Ruby’s said.

The new beef“is the best tasting beef we have ever offered,”Chief Executive Doug Cavanaugh said. Menu prices will not be increased.

By the end of January, all restaurants will convert to using the natural beef for standard burgers, Kobe beef sliders and Kobe chopped steak, said Weny Wu, director of marketing at Ruby’s.

 Tell us: Do you prefer restaurants that serve natural beef? Does it really taste better? Or, do you prefer certified organic beef?

Chicago Tribune Auto Letters Column.

Chicago Tribune (Chicago, IL) June 18, 2000 Byline: Jim Mateja Jun. 18–QUESTION: I just purchased a 2000 Honda Accord. The dealer tried to sell me a“protective Teflon coating”to guard against paint damage from acid rain, bugs and bird droppings. Normally, I would just write this off as a money-making scheme, but since non-lead-based automotive paint hasn’t been around that long, it makes me wonder if this coating might actually preserve the life of my automotive paint finish. Or is it just a $300 wax job?

–A.D., Gurnee, Ill.

ANSWR: It’s not a $300 wax, but it’s not necessary, either, so your first inclination to write it off as a money-making scheme makes the most sense. If you want to protect your vehicle finish, you might want to invest in a few items that will cost substantially less than $300—a hose, bucket and sponge.

Q: I took your advice and am glad I did. I rented a car I had intended to buy and took it on a trip to St. Louis, during which time I found out all the things I liked and didn’t like about the car. Now I know to look at another vehicle to purchase. You were right, four right turns around the dealership are no test drive. Perhaps those lining up to buy a Chrysler PT Cruiser should do the same.

–S.P., Oswego, Ill.

A: We’ve long maintained that buying without testing is asking for trouble and long have suggested the test drive should include putting the car through the paces you will put it through once you buy it—from its ability to move without hesitation from the light to its ability to climb hills, merge, make turns and maneuver through corners while maintaining control and stability, as well as its ability to stop as advertised. go to web site 2000 honda accord 

Rental cars often are abused and so performance, ride and handling aren’t easy to judge, but a rental will give a good reading about such things as roominess and comfort, luggage holding capability, sight lines, ease of finding and using controls, storage space and whether the vehicle will even fit in your garage.

Q: I’m the original owner of a’91 Chevrolet Lumina Euro with a lot of miles on the odometer. A few weeks ago, the engine cradle dropped to the ground while I was driving. Had it fixed and was told by the mechanic he had never seen this happen before. The nuts and bolts had rusted out. Chevy doesn’t seem too interested. Any suggestions?

–S.R., Park Forest, Ill.

A: Suggestions for a’91 model with“a lot of miles”on it? Invest in another car.

Q: What designer chose the colors for the 2000 Dodge Intrepid? Yuck. Have you heard about or seen any of the 2001 colors?

–M.M., Naperville, Ill.

A: Dodge officials said a few new colors are coming but wouldn’t say which. However, they did apologize that you think the current schemes are yucky.

Q: Enjoyed your review of the Saturn SC2. Liked your comment about Saturn being treated as a second-class citizen. I have the GM Card and always wondered why the Saturn is excluded from the rebate program. go to site 2000 honda accord 

–G.C., Wheaton, Ill.

A. The reason for the Saturn exclusion can be summarized in one word: stupidity. But now GM has found wisdom, and in an effort to help revitalize weak Saturn sales, the midsize L-Series is now eligible for purchase using GM card earnings during a 90-day pilot program that began June 1. You can apply up to $3,500 in GM card earnings toward the purchase of a 2000 model L-Series sedan or wagon.

Q: I’m told my car, an’87 Porsche 944, only has to pass the state emissions test for the 1987 model year. So how do I know whether the state is using that year’s standard or the current standards that will force older cars such as mine off the road?

–M.R., Homewood, Ill.

A. When you pull in with a 1987 model car and hand over the notice calling you in for your test, the computer takes over to ensure the standards in effect in 1987 are the ones your car has to meet. Don’t know whether the standards eventually will force your car off the road or whether the stupid dyno test that needlessly shakes, rattles and rolls your vehicle will.

Q: Can the 2001 Ford SuperCrew short bed handle a fifth-wheel trailer or will the trailer hit the cab on tight turns?

–K.A., Glenview, Ill.

A: Ford said no, you need at least an 8-foot box in back for a fifth wheel to properly negotiate turns. The SuperCrew bed is 5 1/2 feet long.

Q: I’ve seen a picture of the 2001 Chrysler Sebring convertible and, frankly, am very disappointed. To me it looks too much like the 2000 and older Sebring convertibles. The only new thing is the 300M grille, maybe a slightly changed hood and a bigger V-6. So what happened to the“bold”changes the 2001 was supposed to have to look like a Jaguar? Do you agree with my assessment?

–C.R., Naperville, Ill.

A: Nope. In person, the car looks very nice. And the new V-6 should not only be more potent, but quieter as well.

Q: When will the new Ford Thunderbird come out?

–F.O., Lauderhill, Fla.

A: Ford just announced it will be out for the 2002 model year.
