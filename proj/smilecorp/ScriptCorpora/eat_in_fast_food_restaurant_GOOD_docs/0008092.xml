AN I.V. PHILLY DISPATCH

By Michael Newall

I.V. Philadelphia Correspondent

Philadelphia – If you visit a McDonald’s in West Philadelphia and an order a McFlurry, be forewarned: Eat and like it.

That’s because an employee who allegedly punched a customer in his eye after he complained about the size of his McFlurry is still working at the restaurant – even though the customer lost his eye as a result of the assault.

Authorities say the cashier slugged the customer in the left eye with a key he placed between his fingers after the customer complained about the size of the McFlurry he ordered for his child.

Doctors eventually had to remove the man&apos;s eye. And while authorities have a surveillance tape of the incident and the cashier was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime, the employee is out on bail  – and back to work at McDonald&apos;s.

“Yeah, I still work there,” the cashier, Khalif Lewis, 18, said after a July court appearance. “I got the 4 o’clock shift tonight.”

At a preliminary hearing in May, Brandon Henderson, 35, testified that he and his wife, Rashee, were on their way home from dinner on Feb. 15 when they stopped at a West Philly McDonald’s to pick up some food for their children.

Upon ordering, the couple was told the restaurant was out of fries.

“How is this a McDonald’s and you don’t have any French fries?” Henderson recalls asking. “The logo is a French fry.”

The Hendersons requested a McFlurry ice cream as a substitute. They were served a small one, and asked for a regular-size instead.

The shift manager and Rashee Henderson began arguing, with the customer requesting a refund. In an effort to defuse the situation, Henderson testified, he escorted his wife to the restaurant door and then went back to cancel the order and get his money back. Upon his return, he said, the shift manager called Rashee Henderson a bitch.

“You don’t have to disrespect her like that,” Henderson said he told the shift manager, pointing out that his wife was a larger woman than she. “I asked her to leave because she is too much for you.”

Then, he said, Lewis, who was working the register, threatened him.

“This p--- think he tough,” he remembered Lewis saying.

“I don’t got to think I’m tough; I&apos;m not here for that,” Henderson said he responded. “If you’re going to give me my money back, give it to me, so I can get out of here.”

Then, Henderson recalled Lewis saying next, “I’m going to knock you the f--- out.” He said Lewis then left the counter for a few moments.

After receiving his refund, Henderson turned to leave the restaurant but only made it to the store vestibule. That’s when authorities say Lewis rushed him and struck him in the eye with his key. Henderson testified that he immediately could not see from the eye, and began yelling, “My eye, my eye!”

He then felt his diamond medallion chain being ripped from his neck. (Lewis has been charged with that theft.) A crowd formed to watch, and Henderson testified his wife fought to pull Lewis off him. She then put her husband in the car and brought him home, his eye still gushing blood. Once home, a panicked Henderson and his wife rinsed his eye with water, but his sight was not returning.

“Your eyeball is gone,” his wife told him.

The couple returned to the McDonald&apos;s and identified Lewis for police, who then had Henderson transported to a hospital.

Police initially detained both Rashee Henderson and Lewis, and then released them both that night. An investigation followed after detectives interviewed Henderson in the hospital and realized the gravity of his injury. Lewis was soon re-arrested.

Meanwhile, after two surgeries, Brandon Henderson’s damaged left eye was covered with an eye patch. By the preliminary hearing, Henderson wore his new glass eye, which had been fitted during a grueling eight-hour operation.

Appearing in front of Judge Jimmie Moore, assistant district attorney Nicole Siller asked Henderson to explain the extent of his injuries. Henderson spoke of his physical pain and of his depression, of how he could no longer work at his job.

“I can’t believe I lost an eye over this,” he said.

Henderson, who changed his phone number after the attack, could not be reached for this article. It is unclear if he has filed a civil lawsuit against McDonalds.

Lewis has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. In the interview after his court appearance, he admitted to throwing the first punch, but only because Henderson “came at him.” He disputes the police report, which states he “knowingly, intentionally or recklessly attempted to cause bodily injury to the complainant by punching him about the eye while gripping keys.”

“I don’t even have keys to my house,” Lewis said.

He regrets the incident, he said.

“If I could do it over, I would have avoided the jawn,” he said, “but I’m in it now.”

He says his employers have been supportive.

“Yeah, they’re cool,” he said.

Police sources say this particular McDonald’s, at 52nd and Chestnut, has been the scene of violence in the past.

During a recent afternoon visit, a store manager, who would not give her name, said only, “I’m busy right now. I can’t talk.”

   Comments (7) What an idiotic response! 7 Monday, 10 August 2009 07:40 Tweet Just Deserts, how can you possibly justify this situation?? If you read and comprehended what the article said, that ADULT came from BEHIND the counter and assaulted a customer...then robbed him!! WTF! All that had to be done to alleviate the situation was to give the man his money back - PERIOD! The irresponsibility is not in the journalism, it&apos;s in people like you who find ridiculous excuses for the inexcusable! A what for a what? 6 Friday, 07 August 2009 12:43 Tweet This is exactly the sort of situation Hammurabi was hoping to avoid with his code. just desserts 5 Friday, 07 August 2009 09:47 Tweet What the hell is going on in this world...When a mans eye is put out getting ice cream..It doesn&apos;t matter who is at fault.. NONE OF THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! DON&apos;T YOU ALL GET IT!!! McFlurry 4 Thursday, 06 August 2009 14:02 Tweet Fast food is bad for your health for you to say Henderson Got What He Ordered is pure evil. 3 Thursday, 06 August 2009 13:23 Tweet @just desserts

Its people like you who are helping to destroy the black community because you refuse to accept personal accountibility.
This is why so many black men are in trouble now in days because they refuse to realize that they are responsible and accountible for thier
own actions even when things are geared against them.

Nothing in this article validated that Mcdonalds employee to physically attack this customer. Even if this customer was rude and disrespectfull,
the employee should have maintained his composure and simply resolved the issue the way costomer service reps are suppose to. Henderson Got What He Ordered 2 Thursday, 06 August 2009 11:16 Tweet If the McDonald&apos;s employee is still on the job, then it seems likely that there&apos;s evidence that Henderson and his &quot;large&quot; wife provoked the situation. At the very least, the article alone suggests that Henderson wasn&apos;t just standing there politely asking for his money back when the kid poked him in the eye.

This is irresponsible journalism, suggesting that the kid is a dangerous person and that McDonald&apos;s is somehow liable for allowing him to keep working -- especially when readers have no idea what the kid does there. Is he interacting with customers? Or is he in the back frying fries?

Either way, as the kid says...they&apos;re both in the jawn now.

And for the record: McDonald&apos;s logo is an ARCH, not a french fry. I am waiting more than ever for God to return me home 1 Thursday, 06 August 2009 10:50 Tweet This is the type of cruelty were seeing from people now in days. This unprovoked, unnecessary babaric behavior. I man lost his eye over this? This situation could have easily been resolved with a simple talk. I mean an animal would have handled this situation better than this. yvComment v.1.20.0
