Treasurys Buoy Credit Markets, but Junk Is King

High-Yield Corporate Debt Extends Strong Gains on Ravenous Risk Appetite, but the &apos;Easy Money Has Been Made&apos;

By SERENA NG 

The recovery in credit markets took hold during the third quarter, as investors&apos; desire to put cash to work outweighed concerns about the economy.
 
The Journal Report

 See the complete Quarterly Markets Review report. 
 
Corporate bonds extended gains from the previous quarter, while a combination of low interest rates and strong investor demand sparked a rush by companies to raise cash by selling debt. Treasurys and short-term debt markets also benefited from improved conditions, helping to keep rates low.

Markets for riskier assets have run up between 15% and 50% year to date, recouping some of the losses sustained in 2008. Many analysts expect the rally to continue for the rest of the year, but they also are sounding notes of caution.

&quot;The easy money has been made,&quot; said Jared Epstein, a managing director overseeing credit trading for clients at BNP Paribas in New York. &quot;We&apos;re now at a crossroads; many people think valuations have gotten ahead of themselves and there are still problems in the world, but there&apos;s still a lot of cash going into riskier assets.&quot;

In contrast to late 2008, when credit markets were frozen amid the worst financial crisis in decades, markets &quot;melted up&quot; during the third quarter, said Jeffrey Rosenberg, head of credit strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. &quot;As prices moved higher rapidly, a lot of the fundamental bearishness began to melt away,&quot; he said.

Holders of U.S. government bonds overcame worries that foreign central banks would scale back purchases. Strong interest from overseas investors, coupled with purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by the Federal Reserve, helped support bond prices and keep yields and home-mortgage rates low.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 3.309% at the end of September, after touching a high of 3.852% in the third quarter. The 10-year yield was 3.521% at the end of June and remains well above its closing low of 2.078% last December, when investors fled to havens amid the financial crisis. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.

The Treasury asset class gained 2.1% during the quarter, according to a Merrill Lynch index that tracks price changes and interest payments.

Low short-term rates and paltry returns from safe investments such as money-market mutual funds have prompted investors to move more money into higher-yielding and riskier assets. Those strategies paid off for a second consecutive quarter as most sectors rallied.

High-yield, or junk, corporate bonds, those issued by companies with speculative-grade credit ratings, gained 15% during the past three months, according to Merrill data as of Tuesday. The gap between their yields and those of Treasurys narrowed to 7.9 percentage points, from a spread of 10.6 percentage points at the end of June. In the year to date, junk bonds have gained a record 48%.

Investment-grade corporate bonds also rallied in the third quarter, chalking up gains of 8.3%. Their spreads dropped to 2.35 percentage points at the end of September, from 3.3 percentage points three months earlier and six percentage points at the start of the year.

The average yield of high-grade corporate bonds is now hovering near 5%, reflecting how cheap it is for financially sound companies to borrow by issuing debt.
 
U.S. companies issued $166 billion in bonds in the third quarter, down from the second quarter but more than double in the same period a year ago, according to data provider Dealogic. This year, corporations have raised about $700 billion in the debt markets, up 38% year over year. Investment-grade debt comprised 87% of issuance.

&quot;There&apos;s not been a major sea change [since the second quarter] but there&apos;s been continued improvement and repair across the market,&quot; said Jim Merli, head of the U.S. fixed-income syndicate at Barclays Capital in New York. Companies, he said, are selling debt in a more opportunistic manner, raising money not so much because they need cash immediately, but because they want to lock in low long-term interest rates.

Financial markets once again hospitable to fund raising by companies allow many of them to pay off debt, build up cash on balance sheets, and, most important, avoid going into default. Individuals, too, are benefiting from a recovery in the banking sector and increasing issuance of securities backed by credit-card debt, auto loans and mortgages, thanks in large part to actions the Fed and Treasury have taken to support the markets.

&quot;The most significant improvement from where we were is the ability to refinance debt,&quot; said Bank of America&apos;s Mr. Rosenberg. Over time, as companies start to see improvements in revenue and profitability, they will be able to use the cheap funds they raised to undertake acquisitions to expand, setting the stage for the next phase of growth, he said.

There remain, however, hundreds of financially weaker companies that will need to refinance roughly $750 billion in junk bonds and leveraged loans in the next few years, and &quot;the markets [for high-yield debt] are still nowhere near where they were in their heyday,&quot; said Mark Okada, chief investment officer of Highland Capital Management in Dallas.

Following two consecutive quarters of strong rallies, there is a sense among investors and analysts that the worst is over for the credit markets and the recession has ended. But the economy remains weak in spots, and many issues, such as proposed regulatory overhauls, have yet to be resolved.

&quot;Banks still have some wounds to heal, so it&apos;s hard to see how we&apos;ll return to a bubble anytime soon. But as short-term rates remain extraordinarily low, investors will be looking for extra yield,&quot; said Jim Vogel, an analyst at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tenn.
