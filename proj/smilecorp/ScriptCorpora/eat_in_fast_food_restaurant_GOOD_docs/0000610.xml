Easy Summer Picnic Snacks
 By: Helen Polaski 
Picnic snacks should be easy, breezy and simple. You want to spend your time enjoying the great outdoors, not stuck in the kitchen, so stick to the basics-sandwiches with peanut butter will please the kids, and ham and cheese will keep the adults satisfied. Add a few small bags of snacks, such as potato chips or pretzels, plus a baggie of celery sticks, and you&apos;ve got yourself a nice little picnic.

 Cold Lunch 
When you&apos;re outside in the sun, a cold lunch will really hit the spot. Some appetizers that are excellent in cold lunches include ham rollups, pickle bundles and hard-boiled eggs. Of course, raw vegetables and fruit-cut up or whole-are always perfect, too. Just don&apos;t forget the dip.

Cold sandwiches can be made ahead and kept cold until you&apos;re ready to go, or you can make them and toss them into the cooler and be on your way in minutes. For easy picnic meals that are packed with protein, choose tuna and egg salad sandwiches or a cold cut submarine.

 Tuna And Egg Salad Wraps 
 Ingredients You Will Need: 
6 hardboiled eggs, chopped
½cup diced celery
¼cup diced green onion
¼cup peas
1 can drained tuna
¼to½cup mayonnaise
Salt
Pepper

Mix all ingredients, and spread over one half of a flatbread wrap. Roll the bread tightly, sealing the ends under to prevent leakage. Wrap the sandwich in waxed paper or foil, and pack the sandwich in a cooler. Always keep meat and egg sandwiches cold, and don&apos;t eat the sandwich if the ice has melted or you&apos;ve been out over two hours. For a variation, omit the tuna and peas, and add a cup of diced cooked chicken.

 Cold Cut Submarines 
 Ingredients You Will Need: 
Baguettes
Salami
Ham
Bologna
Provolone cheese slices
Pepper Jack cheese slices (optional)
Shredded lettuce
Tomato slices
Pickles
Banana pepper rings (optional)
Mayonnaise
Mustard

Slice the baguettes lengthwise about three-fourths of the way through, and then pull the baguette open gently and start layering the ingredients.

 Fast Food Picnic Ideas 
If you really don&apos;t have time to make sandwiches, don&apos;t worry. You can always pick up a few submarine sandwiches on your way out of town. Better yet, fill an empty picnic basket with take-out chicken or Chinese. In fact, any fast food restaurant you pass on the way to your favorite picnic grounds would fit the bill nicely. Kentucky Fried Chicken offers great potato salads and cold chicken, and Arby&apos;s has terrific deli sandwiches. Whatever you do, don&apos;t forget drinks, napkins, utensils and sunscreen.
