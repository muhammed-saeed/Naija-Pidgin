 Lil’Pop Shop Cart Helps Cool Us Down 
 
 

Lil Pop Shop opened its West Philly Pop Shop in May. More recently though, its lil cart has been popping up around town, bringing their icy treats to Center City. Which is lucky for us considering Food and Wine just named them as one of the best popsicle in the country. Pops are $3 and flavors vary.

 Press Hard on the Touch Screens at Honeygrow for A Healthy Lunch, And Don’t Forget Dessert 
 
 Luncher John is checking out the newly opened Honeygrow. 

 

The first week of June featured the debut of two notable lunch spots in Center City. There was Shake Shack, where the lines have yet to die down. Less hyped but almost as popular since its opening is Honeygrow , which is located near the corner of 16 th and Sansom. With its two-pronged focus of“honest eating”+“local growing”, Honeygrow has immediately appealed to those seeking healthier and better tasting lunch food than traditional lunch fare.

Having previously braved the Shake Shack lunch line, I was ready for the Honeygrow lunch crowd. While the wait can be a bit maddening, fortunately, the food makes up for it.

 Asian Fusion Garden Thai&amp;Noodle Bar Opens This Weekend 
 
 

Asian Fusion Garden Thai&amp;Noodle Bar, whose name adequately conveys its menu, is opening tomorrow. The menu is divided into two sides, one being the Chinese side with  Lan Zhou hand pulled noodles,BBQ skewers, hot pot, and smoothies, and the other side consisting of Thai food, with curries, more noodles, and chicken lunch specials. The hand pulled noodle chef was formally cooking in Chicago’s Chinatown, while another chef works on the Thai stuff. Prices are a few dollars higher than what you might find in Chinatown; hand drawn noodle soups range from $7-$10. Looking forward to seeing if its worth it!

The full menu after the jump:

 Hot Diggity is the Wiener Winner (Plus they have a Pickle Plate this month!) 
 
 

Hope you all had a lovely 4th of July. I am no Hawk Krall , but I have tried a good amount of hot dogs in this city. For some reason, I put off trying Hot Diggity- despite having won Phila Weekly’s hot dog battle against Underdogs . For the most American day of the year, I couldn’t put off a visit any longer.
