 I&apos;m unsure of the procedure for tipping on take out. I recently got some take out at a chain sit-down relatively nice restaraunt and called the order in ahead of time. I went and picked it up and paid with a card. I filled out the receipt and just put a slash through the tip blank. I figured I wasn&apos;t being served and therefore no tip was needed. When I handed the receipt back the girl she gave me a look like I had slapped her mother. I&apos;m a very good tipper, usually in the area of 20-25%. But, to me tipping on take out seems a little weird, esp. when the person giving me the food is not a tipped employee(waitress). Am I wrong?

 I do take-out at Outback a couple times a week, and yes we do expect to get tipped. Usually the same person is going to take youe order, pack it all up, and make sure everything is 100% correct. I actually think that doing takeaway on a busy day is much harder than serving and there is no way that I(or anybody else that is competant)would do it if we didn&apos;t get tipped unless they payed us $15 an hour(not going to happen)or something like that. That being said, we usually do not provide the same amount of service as a waiter would so the expected tip is lower. I say 10% is good, but honestly I average probably 15% somedays even 20%. But then again, I am very good at playing people for tips.

So to answer you question, yes the people that do takeaway at places like Outback, Chile&apos;s, Applebee&apos;s, ect do expect tips. I&apos;d say at least 90% of people do tip me. If you stiff me when I&apos;m doing takeaway I won&apos;t be nearly as pissed as if you did while I was serving because we don&apos;t pay tipshare on takeaway sales but I won&apos;t care how long your food takes next time either.

This is a copy/paste from a previous thread about take-out to tipqueen I am reposting to let you know NOT TO EVER TIP FOR TAKE-OUT if you pick it up inside, because it&apos;s truly just like McDonald&apos;s(only if it&apos;s doesn&apos;t have self-serve soft drinks), Wendy&apos;s, and Burger King(only if it&apos;s doesn&apos;t have self-serve soft drinks). Since they sometimes do even LESS service, WHY TIP? Look at the website I quoted of ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINK IT&apos;S NUTS TO TIP FOR TAKE-OUT. OF COURSE they are going to say they&quot;EXPECT&quot;a tip, because they want MORE MONEY, DUH! If I order a pasta dish at Applebee&apos;s and go pick it up inside. It&apos;s just like if I ordered it at McDonald&apos;s, except, McDonalds workers have MORE WORK for most things like getting syrups, butters, and utensils which they DON&apos;T keep out, but they don&apos;t get a tip, is that really fair if you tip an Applebee&apos;s take-out employee for possibly even LESS WORK than not to tip a McDonald&apos;s one? NO, it&apos;s not. Applebee&apos;s has the utensils and napkins all-in-one pack. WHY TIP FOR THAT? They bagged your food and handed it to you as well as rung it up and gave you change. THAT sounds like McDonald&apos;s to me, doesn&apos;t it to you?

Now if I get car-side-to-go, I would tip, because people are taking it to my car, which is a MAJOR service, because they have to go out in the rain, heat, and cold to bring you your food and get change or come back to let you sign the credit card. McDonald&apos;s doesn&apos;t do that for the most part, unless they ask you to move up due to a large order.

&quot;A job she never has done nor ever could!&quot;

That&apos;s 100% WRONG! I HAVE done take-out and phone orders at the donut shop, you IDIOT!

&quot;No you idiot, it is NOTHING like KFC where they have several people working on filling one bag with a piece of chicken, a piece of corn on the cob and yet another to pour a coke.&quot;

YOU are 100% WRONG about that! At KFC for instance, Ive gotten a 6 piece meal with sides. They put my plastic utensils and napkins. They put it into a bag and they took the order. Ive even seen the CASHIER get some of the food like she got a thong for the biscuits and put them in*****HERSELF******in the box, meaning, SHE BOXED food for NO TIP at all. Isnt that the SAME****EXACT THING*****that a sit-down restaurant to-go employees do?

A Wendy&apos;s worker filled my cup with coke as well as took my order and money, DUMMY! TRULY*OBSERVE*fast food workers. Ive seen THE SAME PERSON THAT TOOK MY ORDER, bag my food and put ice and coke in my cup! YOU ARE AN IDIOT!

&quot;Keep your freaking opinion to yourself until you have finally walked in the shoes of the one you are bashing!!&quot;

I HAVE walked in those shoes at the DONUT SHOP and it&apos;s NOT AN&quot;OPINION&quot;that it&apos;s just like some fast food places(EXCLUDING SONIC), it&apos;s pure 100% FACT!

People called in orders, even king cake SHIPPING orders during a couple of months when mardi gras is, which was a PAIN in the ass, because the boss made&quot;US&quot;fill out everything like addresses to and from, name to and name from, credit card numbers, et, because he wanted to be able for US to read it instead of someone elses handwriting we couldnt make out. We also had call-in orders for king cakes and had to keep an inventory count of them. Sometimes, someone would order a certain filling in one. We also had quite a NUMBER of people that would call-in their food orders and come pick them up. SOME even came through&quot;DRIVE-THRU&quot;to pick them up, which OF COURSE I didn&apos;t get tipped and I SHOULDN&apos;T have anyway, because it&apos;s&quot;BAGGING&quot;someone&apos;s food like MCDONALD&apos;S. I had LOTS of TO-GO orders when people would order several drinks, fries, and burgers. I HAVE BEEN IN YALLS SHOES!

The McDonald&apos;s cashier fills the cokes that don&apos;t have self-serve ones and takes my order. I&apos;ve seen the SAME PERSON bag my burger and get my fries.

 http://jobs.esc.state.nc.us/skn/docs/app3mr4.001 

Job Summary: MCDONALD&apos;S/CASHIER, WASHING DISHES, SERVING FOOD THRU 2ND WINDOW AND FRONT COUNTER

See,****WHO****BAGS THE FOOD, IDIOT? They do NOT have SERVERAL people filling the bag. Fast food places have people MAKING the food like a cook does at a non-fast food place. The CASHIER has even gotten me a cup with tartar sauce and/or mayonnaise LOTS of times as well as packets of mayonnaise. THE*********CASHIER***********IS THE ONE BAGGING THE FOOD, GETTING CONDIMENTS, AND GETTING DRINKS, YOU IDIOT! The cooks put it the food down the little slot and the*******CASHIER********GRABS IT and puts it in the bag. Have you EVER been to a fast food place? Were you born under a ROCK?

That person handles the phone

Thats just like getting an order from someone IN PERSON, NO DIFFERENCE! You can put them ON HOLD just like RECEPTIONIST DO or tell them to hold on.

When I order hotcakes and sausage at McDonald&apos;s, the cashiers get me butters and syrups, knives and forks, and jelly for my sausage. They bag it too and ring me up. Do they get a tip for that? I THINK NOT! BE FAIR and tip for the*SERVICE*you receive.

 http://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=470548 

Look at this website. Look at ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT DONT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT.
BottomFeeder said There&apos;s no point in doing so since all this person did was wrap up my food that someone else made for me, and that&apos;s it.

Kaiser said Tipping on take-out? Why, because you carried the styrofoam containers from the kitchen and bagged them for me?

SDscooby said Agreed, I don&apos;t tip on take-out. Thats just ridiculous.

Incorporeal said I dont tip for takeout, I tip about 20%+when I eat in though.

Hunter S. Thompson said And no I don&apos;t tip if I get take out. If someone delivers it then I will.

Eric Anderson said Yeah&apos;GEE THANKS FOR OPENING MY BEER!!! here is a buck!&quot;

honestly... when did we start taking moron pills. - THIS one was to PROVE my point that opening a beer is LESS SERVICE than a McDonalds employee does to give me a coke with ice.

Stitkacik said&quot;Takeout = no tip.&quot;

nhluhr said&quot;This means no tips for Takeout.&quot;

Eric Anderson said&quot;And I NEVER do for takeout.&quot;

1. They give me napkins.

2. They give me ketchups or syrups or butters, or jellies or whatever condiments.

3. They put the item in a bag.

4. They ring up the item and give people change.

5. They fill a cup with ice and soft drink or whatever drink like tea.


I feel WHY tip for service that we don&apos;t tip for AT ALL when we order at fast food places? THAT is NOT FAIR to tip for a take-out entree at Chili&apos;s, but NOT for a combo at McDonald&apos;s. THE*****CASHIER****BAGS MY FOOD, GIVES ME CONDIMENTS AND UTENSILS, GIVES ME MY MONEY AND TAKES MY ORDER AS WELL.

What&apos;s to tip for here? FAST FOOD PEOPLE DO THE SAME EXACT THINGS? Do you truly know of a difference? A phone called order is just like if I was standing telling the cashier what I wanted. It&apos;s just a DIFFERENT way of taking an order down. It&apos;s NOT MUCH DIFFERENT if I go to Applebee&apos;s to get a alfredo pasta dish or go to KFC to get a chicken family dinner with sides. Actually, KFC workers do MORE WORK. The utensils are separate from napkins at KFC and arent OUT like at McDonalds. Applebee&apos;s has it all-in-one little bag with a napkin, fork, knife, and salt&amp;pepper packets also. KFC workers get the chicken and biscuits to put into the boxes. THE*SAME*PERSON THAT TOOK MY ORDER even puts the sides in the containers. They don&apos;t get tips, so WHY tip for LESS WORK at Applebee&apos;s? That&apos;s just plain STUPID!

I want you to TRULY THINK ABOUT that fact that the CASHIER DOES do the bagging and filling the cups, because its*FACT*, NOT an OPINION!

 I don&apos;t think it&apos;s unreasonable to tip, since the service they give you affects your dinner, so it&apos;s like waiter. Although 15-20% for take-out seems very high.

The problem with tipping is, you only find out whether or not they gave you good service(packed everything carefully, plenty of condiments, etc)AFTER you have given the tip. So, unless you do this frequently, and therefore are familiar with the person or place, it&apos;s hard to know whether they&apos;ve earned a tip or not.

It&apos;s a little like most people tipping pizza delivery. Most people don&apos;t even look at the pizza before tipping. Then they open it and find out it&apos;s the wrong pizza or missing the garlic butter or something.

For me, when I get a pizza, I always open the boz before paying or tipping. One time, it was a cross-cut pizza with about 24 small pieces, and they were all stuck together at the one side of the box - obviously the driver had dropped it, and didn&apos;t care to fix it, was hoping I wouldn&apos;t notice until he left. Pretty funny because I started to open the box to look, and before I even did that, he had this look on his face that I knew something was wrong. No tip for that uy, just a call to his manager.

 Lords, you are a fuckin cunt and you don&apos;t know what the hell you are talking about. Ever sell $1200(probably about 40 orders)worth of togo food in five hours at your stupid donut shop doing everything yourself? One Friday shift doing takeaway at my store would be all it would take for you to start crying and walk out, I promise. Nobody cares what the hell you think and you should just go kill yourself because of how pathetically stupid and ignorant you are.

westley has a good point, it might be a good idea to quickly check to make sure everything is correct. Even though I can&apos;t remember the last time I screwed an order up, it happens and we don&apos;t deserve a tip if it does.

Just a reminder: I am 100% positive that you have ingested the bodily fluids of many servers because you are such a cunt. The only way to avoid this happening again in the future is to start behaving like a regular human being when you go out to eat. You can ignore me if you want, but I know that you are going to think about it next time you go to Applebee&apos;s and eat 5000 calories and 200 grams of fat in one sitting.

 Do the servers have to share their tips with you when you work take out? If not, is there any compensation for working take out? I would assume the employer would treat the take out person with the same attitude as a cook or a greeter or a table bus.

 No we don&apos;t get tip-outs from servers even though when we are slow I&apos;m basically a food runner. They do pay me $6/hr for doing takeaway. They can definitly pay less though, and it is my understanding that the most takeaway people get paid the same as servers($2.13/hr where I live), even people at other Outbacks. We also get&quot;compensated&quot;for doing takeaway because takeaway sales are usually higher than most servers&apos;sales and we can thus make up for the lower tip percentages. I would say that they treat us much more like servers than anybody else in the store.

 &quot;Even though I can&apos;t remember the last time I screwed an order up, it happens&quot;

You can&apos;t remember because they&apos;ve already left when they realize it&apos;s screwed up. That&apos;s not an attack on you, it&apos;s just reality - you&apos;re human, and you screw up sometimes, or the cook screws up and you don&apos;t catch it, or whatever - tons of orders go out wrong all the time, of course most people don&apos;t bother to do anything about it or even call and tell the restaurant.

We get takeout all the time and probably have something screwed up one time in ten. Last week we got salads that were supposed to have balsamic vinegarette, and it was in those standard plastic cup containers, and when I opened mine, it smelled funny, turns out they accidentally grabbed the wrong containers - the ones with maple syrup look an aweful lot like the ones with balsamic.

 Believe me, most people will call/come back if you screwed something up. Or at the very least mention it the next time they order. When I was new and did occasion mess up, I usually realized before the person even called back that I messed their order up. I simply don&apos;t screw things up(anymore)because I know what I&apos;m doing. Now if the your steak is cooked well done instead of med-well, it really isn&apos;t my fault and there was nothing I could have done besides cut it open to determine it was overcooked.

 TIP THEM OUT!!!! I believe that is what my point was!!!

It&apos;s a underpaid job(and paid LESS than McDonalds and KFC emps), and NO tips aren&apos;t expected... but they are APPRECIATED... just as you APPRECIATE them&quot;baggin it up&quot;...Hell, tip em&apos;at McDonalds if you feel the urge... I&apos;m sure they&apos;d APPRECIATE it too!!

 I went and ordered takeout yesterday from a pizza-wing place. We paid her first and put a tip in her jar. Told the high school girl we&apos;d be having a beer. An hour later I asked her where the food was and she said it got busy and she didn&apos;t have time to tell us it was ready and since we were at the bar she kind of forgot. I got a cold pizza and pasta and she got a tip.

Kind of pissy.

 *sigh*it is so sad i can&apos;t curse...takes away a lot of what i really want to express to this idiot...

first of all LOA i did not bother to read all of your sh**...go f***yourself you miserable piece of human waste...

ok that said...

i do take out only...i get paid $3.80 and i make my money of tips. no my only job is not taking your food to where you are. i have to take your order, quote you, bag it, prep your sides, dressings, and sauces, and make sure everything is there.

I DO NOT GET PAID $8 AND HOUR, LIKE MOST PEOPLE THINK.

sure in some places the take out people get paid a lot more per hour, but in most causal chains they don&apos;t.

everytime someone tries to tell me that doing take out is a piece of cake i invite you to join me during take out rush and lets see if you can handle it....most servers at my job can&apos;t handle it...

jenaclaree: that sucks...as busy as i am if i
have a tipping customer that is at the bar i will go take their food to the bar. ALWAYS...now if they tip me a $1 or change...i will attend to my paying customers before.

 oh dtugg don&apos;t i understand .... the phones constantly ringing...people on hold, people coming in to order, food coming out, boxes all over the take out area, sides to be made, extra dressings to call out for...people outside honking their idiotic horns...people that you quote 45 minutes and they show up in 20 and start bitching...people that order $230 worth of food and don&apos;t tip you...

take out is a world of its own...

thank god i have my regulars that some actually tip 25% or more when they order and i am there...

 Robert is that your picture? It is most unflattering. I am trying to imagine your face all unscrewed, I bet its not bad. Get rid of the pic and put something that resembles you more. And tip on to go, 10% is perfectly acceptable. Formerly Jammie

 Penelopemarie,

You might know the place. It&apos;s called College Park Inn across from MDCC on 104th st. Like I said she was a High School girl. Didn&apos;t realize she should tell us.

 i have no clue as to where this place is, but i guess their system is not like ours. we have some customers that tell us, oh we&apos;ll be back in 20 minutes, or i&apos;ll be at the bar...so we usually know where to find them to give them their food...but still if you have a good customer that tipped you and you realize it has been a while you tend to look around the restaurant to see if you spot them...if we appreciate the customer we really do not want them to get cold food....

 I really don&apos;t understand why people get to go food for dinner. Don&apos;t people have the time at dinner to actually sit down at the restaurant to eat??

I can understand if there is someone sick at home or unable to be mobile or some other weird reason, but seriously, Outback&apos;s food isn&apos;t all that great in the first place, as is with any other chain that does curbside service.

The only other reason I could see it happening is if a potential customer doesn&apos;t like to tip period and that&apos;s their&apos;way out&apos;.

At lunch, I can see the reasoning behind take out, but that&apos;s it. But you should still tip something(you damn hairdressers).

&quot;Hell, tip em&apos;at McDonalds if you feel the urge... I&apos;m sure they&apos;d APPRECIATE it too!&quot;

 http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Make_20McDonald_27s_20Employees_20Smile 

Without actually knowing anything about it firsthand, I guarantee you McDonalds&apos;employees aren&apos;t allowed to keep tips. Putting money in their pockets while at the register is grounds for dismissal, I&apos;m very sure.

 http://www.thefoodpornographer.com/?cat=39 

A sailor tried to give me a tip(no doubt for his excellent ketchup service)but we were not allowed to accept tips. The manager, who happened to be standing next to me when the sailor offered me a tip told him to put his money in the Ronald McDonald House donation box. The sailor thought this was a stupid idea because he wanted me, not McDonalds(in an American accent), to have the money, and so when he left he tried to sneak me five bucks. I had no where to put it though - those damned McDonalds trousers didnt have any pockets. Presumably to stop us from stealing.

 http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/3326/2879.html?1103223247 

I made $6.50 /hr at McDonalds trying to support my family and we employees arent even allowed to accept tips.

 http://www.plastic.com/article.html ;sid=02/11/07/15120362

Somewhere here in IL they opened up a restaurant-style McDonald&apos;s, with a supposedly&quot;pleasant&quot;atmosphere, and waiters that bring you your food. I guess this could be an interesting strategy, except that waiters aren&apos;t allowed to accept tips.

 http://community.livejournal.com/honestyisabitch/158829.html 

When I worked at McD&apos;s, we were taught not to accept tips- even though occasionally I did some.

See, this person WENT AGAINST THE MANAGER! THEY ARENT****ALLOWED*****TO ACCEPT TIPS! IF THEY DO, THEY COULD GET FIRED OR REPRIMANDED! THEY ARENT SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT TIPS! DONT YOU GET THAT?

 http://www.sports-central.org/community/boards/archive/index.php/t-9299.html 

Or working at McDonald&apos;s(even though McD&apos;s has a policy that you are NOT allowed to accept tips... but how many customers actually know that and why wouldn&apos;t they feel obliged to tip a poor teenager working in a restaurant, even if it were a fastfood one??)

 http://www.edupass.org/culture/tipping.phtml 

You do not tip the cashier in a fast food restaurant.

 http://people.howstuffworks.com/tipping1.htm 

Who are we NOT supposed to tip?
There are still a few people out there who we are NOT supposed to tip. Some of these include:
Restaurant owners
Salon owners
Other owners of establishments where you tip the service providers
Food deliveries under $30, such as those from the grocery store(although this is debated)
Airline flight attendants
Busboys in restaurants(waiters usually give busboys a percentage of the tips they receive)
Hotel desk clerks and doormen(unless they provide some special service for you)
Bus drivers
Theater ushers
Museum guides
Salespeople
Employees at fast food restaurants

There is no tipping at fast food joints!

No tipping in McDonald&apos;s or like fast-food restaurants.

 http://www.retailworker.com/node/26097 

Starbucks tips are nice, and always appreciated but not necessery, in terms of McDonalds, we are not allowed to accept tips, and any money donated to a member of staff is [apparently] by all rights to [a] be refused or [b] owned by the company... im leaving on sunday!

 http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:xg69uxqpzTsJ:www.mcdepk.com/mcdonalds3n1rest aurant/downloads/3n1_lead_release.pdf+%22no+tipping%22+McDonald%27s&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5 

McDonalds 3n1 invites customers to take a seat, relax and order via a special red
phone at their table. Although this concept offers table service, a no tipping policy
adds to the overall value of the experience.

 http://roadtrip.beimers.com/day56.html 

4. Pay at the Diner-To-Go cashier. No tipping!

See, even McDonalds doesnt let employees who do TABLE SERVICE accept tips. Think about that! IT CLEARLY STATES NO TIPPING POLICY!

There will ALWAYS be people that just dont follow the RULES. That person that accepted the tip, DIDNT FOLLOW THE RULES! THEY COULD GET FIRED FOR ACCEPTING TIPS! LOOK WHOS THE MORON!

 I feel WHY tip for service that we don&apos;t tip for AT ALL when we order at fast food places? THAT is NOT FAIR to tip for a take-out entree at Chili&apos;s, but NOT for a combo at McDonald&apos;s. THE*****CASHIER****BAGS MY FOOD, GIVES ME CONDIMENTS AND UTENSILS, GIVES ME MY MONEY AND TAKES MY ORDER AS WELL. 

These are your words Lords, here is your answer:

McD&apos;s, KFC, etc are&quot;Fast Food Restaurants&quot;. They take the order, bag it up, and ship you out. Done.

Chilis, Applebees, etc are&quot;Family Restaurants&quot;. They cater to table dining AND Take-out, whether it be curb-side, or bar side.

Just as you have the right to tip a waiter, you also have the right to tip the curb-side/bartender for getting your togo order together.

If you want to treat these people like the people in Fast Food Restaurants, then so be it. It&apos;s you choice to be uncaring.

 lords you f***tard, you said it in your extensive research...mcdonalds people get paid $6.50 an hour...I GET PAID $3.80, SO I MAKE MY REST OF THE MONEY OFF TIPS...and i do work harder than a fast food employee. we do not have 2 windows one to order and take payment and the other to pick the stuff up. we have one person that answers the phone, takes you order, rings it up, takes it to the back, preps the sides and dressings(those are not already prepared), takes the food and boxes it, and bag everything.

it is not pressing a little button on a computer, taking payment, saying drive to the next window, and waiting for the second half to throw the burger that ALREADY SOMEONE WRAPPED, the fries that maybe that same person put in a box, and throwing a couple of condiments in the bag.

they attend to maybe 2 people at a time. i have had more than 20 orders in 15 minutes. all to bag up and prepare, and keep adding more people that want to order or pick up their food. people like you that can&apos;t wait because that would be*uncaring*and*unfair*.

people like you wait longer for their food, it might be ready but i might just leave it in the back longer just for fun. paying customers go first. paying customers get all their extra sides of ranch. paying customers get their food hot and fast. loards gets cold food, half a side of ranch, and has to wait. you can complain all you want and maybe the next time you&apos;ll get 3 half way filled sides of ranch...etc.

i don&apos;t give a f***how uncaring and selfish you think i am...and yes i am a b****, i already know it

Glad you said it since everyone not currently in the industry(and many in it)are thinking it!!! I doubt you work harder than the folks at McDonalds.

LOA is really wacky most of the time but really for take-out you are doing what a minimum wage worker is doing. You do realize that the two McDonald&apos;s people are doing more than you do since they have to answer phone, take orders from drive thru, key it in, individually bag the fries, pour the drinks, make the sundaes, get the salt, the ketchup, silverware for salads and such, then pack everything up to go etc. You aren&apos;t even putting it in the to-go box from what goes on in most restaurants(it comes that way from the kitchen)????

Even the host on NPR and an expert on etiquette and other things interviewed recently agreed NO REASON TO TIP FOR TAKE OUT!!!!

But assuming you are doing as good a job as the workers at McDonalds do. You claim 20 orders in 15 minutes, so 80 orders an hour? I don&apos;t believe you. But assuming your takeout orders average $20 each and each tipped you $.10 you would make $8.00/hr from tips plus $3.80 = $11.80 which is pretty high pay for you to get paid, right???

If you got tipped 10% or $2 you would make $2 times 80 orders
$160/hr+3.80 = $163.80/hr BUSTED!!!!!!! like I said don&apos;t believe you get that many orders.

You do realize that at McDonalds or another fast food restaurant they have to deal with MORE ORDERS than you do. The drive thru&apos;s at McDonalds ROUTINELY have 80+orders an hour. In fact, in many of them you can see the hourly order counts posted from your car.

You may not like it but take-out is not tipped by custom. Yes, you may be very lucky since some people do but don&apos;t try and change reality.

 When did anybody from Mickie-D&apos;s ever have to take an order from over the phone?

Also, I don&apos;t ever see customers in Mickie-D&apos;s ever get raging mad if they forgot something, as would sure as hell happen in a restaurant.

You tip for to-go at a restaurant because there are higher expectations from the person doing take out. They are ultimately responsible for everything wrong in the customer&apos;s eyes. If they forgot something in an order, that may be grounds for dismissal. Do you really think that Mc-D&apos;s managers care that much? They&apos;re just happy to have halfway behaved high school kids employed there.

Oh yeah, do these HS kids need more than the minimum to get by? Not usually. It&apos;s a job to begin to learn responsibility, not a job to make rent and pay bills. These kids don&apos;t really care if your order is correct. Adults that are trying to make a living, possibly with kids at home do, for the most part. Do you find these adults with real bills working at Mc-D&apos;s? I didn&apos;t think so. Do you find them at better places like Outback where tipping is appreciated? Yes.

F***off all of you non-tipping bastards and stupid-ass reasons for trying to get out of doing it. You probably just can&apos;t afford it because your job sucks worse than ours does.

 i don&apos;t think that you understood what i wrote or maybe i didn&apos;t express it correctly. when do mc donalds employees answer the phone. they attend the drive thru. that person puts the order in the computer and takes payment. then directs the customer to the person that is packing the order.

i answer the phone, write the order, put it in the computer, take it back. prepare all the sides for potatoes, all the mashed potatoes, dressings, butter, sauces for steaks, sauces for fish, etc. then i box the food; where i work the food does not come in a box. in mcdonalds the food comes wrapped up the person takes it and puts it in the bag. takes all the prepackaged sides and puts them in the bag. my dressings and sides are not prepackaged. i deal with 20 customers in an hour in rush hour. if 8 called in at the same time, i have to deal with those 8 orders in the same 20 to 25 minutes i quoted. in the drive thru you can only have three people that paid and are waiting for their food, and another ordering, cause well the line can be so long. sure they can have more orders than me, but those won&apos;t come out until all the others that are waiting in the drive thru lane are done. my 8 orders come out at the same time and people get there at the same time so i have to make sure they don&apos;t wait too long. i have to quote the correct time. i have to make sure everything is fine because most people get their food messed up from a fast food and they don&apos;t call back to complain, since this is a restaurant you can bet they call for every little thing.

rush hour in take out is more hectic than rush hour in a sit down restaurant as well. sure mc donalds handles more order, obvious but the rush goes to the people cooking it. once you are waiting in the drive thru there is really not much you can do. people do not expect that from take out that is why they call it ahead of time.

if you don&apos;t believe how many orders i can get from take out, go to one of these casual dinning restaurants that do take out, ask how the business goes. right now our business is slow because it is not season and my restaurant does not move a lot of take out business. other restaurants have to have at least 5 people a night to handle the take out rush. so yes in some cases it is a very busy area. like i said we do not get paid like mcdonalds employees, and yes when i am busy i work harder than even the servers on the floor.

 I&apos;ve always tipped on take-out, even before I was in the restaurant business. Whenever I work behind the bar and have to do take-out orders, I cringe a little. I know that it&apos;s basically a 50/50 shot that I&apos;m going to get a tip, and I don&apos;t really have the time to do it. We don&apos;t have a take-out person, so the bartender has to put together the take-out orders in between making drinks for customers, making drinks for servers, making change for servers who forgot their bank, and taking tables in cocktails.

It&apos;s especially fun when a group of say, 13 nurses from the hospital up the street calls in with an order with all sorts of special requests, gets there early, and then don&apos;t tip a dime. I don&apos;t really have time for that. If I was getting paid more than $3.50 an hour, I&apos;d be happy to do it, but I&apos;m not.

This is one of the main reasons I refuse to bartend. I make so much more money serving. I&apos;d much rather bartend because it&apos;s more fun and laid back(minus the take-out part), but I just don&apos;t get paid enough to do so.

And I don&apos;t think penelope&apos;s a bi***, just probably fed up with the clientel that don&apos;t know any better/don&apos;t care.

 regguy, I promise you that doing takeaway at a place like Outback is very hard work. I am one of the few at my store that can handle doing curbside by myself on a busy night without freaking out or screwing stuff up. And bistroy is right. If I start messsing up orders they will not hesitate to fire my ass. Seen it happen before.

The last time that I did takeaway, I ended up selling about $700 with about 25 orders. Off of that I made about $90 in tips. I worked five hours at $6/hr. Works out to $24/hr which is above average. You might say that is way too much but you know what, if people didn&apos;t tip me for takeaway, I wouldn&apos;t do it. I would have a much easier job and make much more money serving.

 My friend works Chili&apos;s to go(only 45 minutes north of penelope)and makes $7.50 an hour. She says only about 50% tip her but it averages to about $10 an hour bc there&apos;s usually 2 or 3 of them.

 Is this for real? How can you even consider comparing curbside like Outback to freakin McDonalds. I&apos;ve worked at McDonalds, and have friends who do curbside.

At McDonalds, one person takes your order and takes your money, another one person takes the sandwhich and puts it in a bag, puts fries in as well, hands it to another person who makes the drink and hands the drink/bag out the window, if you want pre-packaged crappy condiments, they throw those in to. Hell, many fast food restaurants even have machines that automate the drink making process to make it even easier.

You are comparing that to someone who takes your phone order, bags up fresher items, packages your souffle cups with sauces, walks you through the menu describing items mind you, special requests besides&quot;no mustard&quot;, more like&quot;I want this side with this, blah blah blah&quot;... then has to time it since it doesn&apos;t come up in 30 seconds 10 feet away, instead they walk 50 feet to the kitchen, anywhere from 10 - 20 minutes, checks the food, puts your sides together, verifies all your special requests are taken care of instead of just reading&quot;no mustard&quot;on a ticket, packages it nicely, runs it out to your car, takes payment, runs back in to take the payment, runs back out to your car, and you are on your way. All this while handling several OTHER time and responsibility intensive orders at the same time.

You are ACTUALLY comparing these two? Holy crap, LOADS, go DIE!! Please, I hope you die in your sleep tonight and forever make the world a better place. You have NO IDEA what you are talking about, NONE WHAT-SO-EVER. You don&apos;t get it, you never will. EVERY single person on EVERY single thread continuously tells you that you have NO CLUE what restaurant staff ACTUALLY do compared to your donut shop or anything else for that matter, stop putting people down, you are looking like a fool.

 vitalryan.... clap clap clap(and the servers stand to their feet!)THANK YOU... that is exactly what I&apos;ve been saying... there is no comparison between the 2, I agree with your every word!!

penelopemarie, dtugg.... I tip my hat to you, as your carry out job IS very hard!! I am an Outbacker myself dtugg, and unfortunately I have never volunteered for the take away posistion when we have been short staff.... it seems WAY more fustrating than the routine at work that I am used to! You two deserve a BIG KUDOS for doing it!!!

(ps...dtugg, what state are you in? Our takeaway isnt nearly as busy as yours... its a good thing too, I dont think ANYONE could handle those sales at my Illinois store)... so an extra kudos to you!

 In my previous restaurant, we would always do between $1500 - 2500 worth of takeout - every night. Most of the time, it required two people. You could have as many as 8 $25 - $50 orders going on simultaneously. Each order had to be unpacked in front of the guest to assure its accuracy. How much did the to-go people get paid? $2.13 an hour. Just like any other server. And guess what? Most of the people tipped*something*. It usually ended up averaging about 10% overall. So the servers working takeout would make about a bill each, which is just about what we dinner servers would make. But they did it in a more concentrated fashion, having to deal with as many as 8&quot;tables&quot;at a time. And they had to deal with the people who were told that it would be 45 minutes, but they were there in 15 because&quot;they were in the neighborhood&quot;. Believe it or not, you had a small percentage of people who would tip 20%(this made up for the no-tipping ingrates).

I think that to-go customers get over on their dining-in bretheren if they don&apos;t tip, because they are paying the same menu price but not paying for the convenience(read&quot;service&quot;). I wonder how many of them would pay a surcharge to pay for the wages of those who perform the service for them, because I can guarantee you that if my restaurant had to pay a server to work to-go(in other words, similar compensation to what they are missing by not being on the floor), one of two things would have to happen. They&apos;d either have to raise prices for EVERYONE, or they&apos;d have to tack on a fairly hefty surcharge on to-go orders. I think that fairness dictates that dining-in guests shouldn&apos;t have to pay for the convenience of those who want to eschew the dining-in experience.

It&apos;s an issue of fairness on both sides - the guest and the restaurant/server. I think that 10% is a fair amount, IF everyone complied. As it is, knowing what I know about the stress of dealing with to-go orders and the fact that some people just don&apos;t&quot;get it&quot;, I recommend tipping roughly the same, especially if they do the extra things like remembering you from your last order, unpacking the order to verify what you&apos;ve ordered, taking care of special requests, etc.

Comparing McDonald&apos;s to a restaurant takeout is fairly absurd. I wonder how many $50 orders they have to pack? And this is to the sororities who would order $200 worth of food on a Sunday night and not leave a thing - who do you think assembled and packed those 8 grocery sack sized bags of food?

Oh yeah, our takeout people would tip out the food runners because they were needed in the assembling and packing process.

Thank goodness I now work in a restaurant that only does take out once or twice a week(and it&apos;s handled by the bartenders). I think that the proliferation of takeout cheapens the product of most restaurants(just my opinion)and pretty soon there&apos;s going to be a tipping point where adjustments are going to have to be made if people on the whole don&apos;t tip for the service, because servers won&apos;t be willing to lose their floor shifts in order to work for far less. The only way it works in a full service restaurant is if the to-go servers are fairly compensated, either by the restaurant or by the guest, and probably a combination of the two.

&quot;When do mc donalds employees answer the phone.&quot;

When you take a call-in order it&apos;s EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT AS if the person is actually in front of you, so this is STUPID to say that there&apos;s ANY DIFFERENCE in it.

&quot;They attend the drive thru. that person puts the order in the computer and takes payment. then directs the customer to the person that is packing the order.&quot;

In drive-thru, they do that, but NOT, I repeat***NOT***if you go to the counter and get it to-go or for here.

&quot;In mcdonalds the food comes wrapped up the person takes it and puts it in the bag.&quot;

At McDonald&apos;s it IS like that, but***NOT***at KFC. As I said before, this is TRUE, I am NOT LYING, the SAME person that took my order as well as took my money ALSO put my chicken in the box as well as put biscuits in a container. McDonald&apos;s may be like that, but***KFC***. It all depends on what TIME of day you go. I am pretty sure at a busy time as long as they have workers, they probably have several people doing the jobs, but this was at 6:30p.m. at night, when it wasn&apos;t busy at ALL. Also, it depends on if they are short staffed or not at the time, like if 2 people just quit or had to leave because of an emergency.

&quot;My dressings and sides are not prepackaged.&quot;

So is the TARTAR SAUCE at McDonald&apos;s I ask for in a cup for the filet o&apos;fish as well as Burger King. Also, Mayonnaise I ask for in a cup, because it taste MUCH better than the packets. They get these things and DON&apos;T EVER get tipped. I&apos;ve even asked for the mayonnaise they have with the snackers at KFC in a container before and they got it for me. That person didn&apos;t receive a tip.

&quot;Like i said we do not get paid like mcdonalds employees, and yes when i am busy i work harder than even the servers on the floor.&quot;

For one thing,*HOW MUCH*you get paid is COMPLETELY 100% IRRELEVANT. Think about employees at Starbucks that get tipped for a coffee to-go and even I did quite a NUMBER of times at the donut shop. One regular guy would tip $0.92(the rest from $2.00, which the large coffee was $1.08), sometimes even in drive-thru. Did he consider&quot;Oh, she gets paid at least minimum wage, so she doesn&apos;t need a tip?&quot;OF COURSE NOT, he tipped anyway. Do these customers that tip for a black coffee that doesn&apos;t contain cream or sugar consider that these Starbucks employees make at LEAST $6.50/hr? NO, they don&apos;t, they pay them MORE ANYWAY, so WHAT&apos;S WRONG with NOT CARING ABOUT&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;you make the other way around when it&apos;s LESS? Those Starbucks employees as well as the employees of the donut shop I was at still want tips. Do you think just because you get paid&quot;LESS&quot;you deserve more than someone that does sometimes LESS WORK than you do?

Think about this once again. If I order a fettucine alfredo from Applebees, which is ONE entree, NO DRINK. If you claim you have to put it into the to-go box, that doesn&apos;t make sense, because WHY wouldn&apos;t the cook do that? If you do have to take the pasta and put it in the box, that&apos;s just like McDonald&apos;s cashier giving me extra tartar sauce in a cup that a LOT of times, THAT CASHIER GOT, NOT SOMEONE ELSE, HONESTLY, it is. Applebee&apos;s has ALL-IN-ONE napkin-fork-knife-salt-pepper. So all you have to do is put it into a to-go container, bag it, ring it up, and get the money or credit card. So tell me, in this situation, honestly, do you see a ANY DIFFERENCE in this than at McDonald&apos;s getting me tartar sauce in a cup? The McDonald&apos;s cashier DOES fill the soft drink(as long as it&apos;s not the self-serve McDonald&apos;s), which Wendy&apos;s doesn&apos;t have self-serve soft drink machines I&apos;ve ever seen. The*CASHIER*DOES put the burger into the bag. Sometimes the CASHIER has put the fries in the bag, sometimes it&apos;s someone else. My point is, if it&apos;s a*SIMPLE*order such as a dish&quot;AS IS&quot;such as a pasta dish, then WHAT is SO DAMN DIFFERENT of what you do vs. what a KFC cashier does? If they do even LESS work, WHY would ANYONE tip for that? I know people that have tipped me for a coffee to-go and I think that&apos;s INSANE. I TRULY DIDN&apos;T deserve that, but who in their right mind wouldn&apos;t take it? I think it was insane for people to tip on a dozen donuts, whether or not I was making $6/hr.&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;someone makes doesn&apos;t have ANYTHING to do with tipping. It&apos;s****HOW MUCH WORK*****did the person do and do we tip for that work with OTHER PEOPLE in the world to be FAIR.

kleykulele
&quot;It&apos;s especially fun when a group of say, 13 nurses from the hospital up the street calls in with an order with all sorts of special requests, gets there early, and then don&apos;t tip a dime.&quot;

If it was a HUGE order like that, sure I&apos;d consider tipping 15% ONLY, that&apos;s ONLY, if the order was 100% correct as far as what they can SEE is wrong that is.

vitalryan
&quot;How can you even consider comparing curbside like Outback to freakin McDonalds.&quot;

Because they are just about the same 98% of the time.

&quot;At McDonalds, one person takes your order and takes your money, another one person takes the sandwhich and puts it in a bag, puts fries in as well, hands it to another person who makes the drink.

The*CASHIER*DOES PUT MY SANDWICH in the bag. I am NOT talking about*DRIVE-THRU*at all. Drive-thru is DIFFERENT at McDonald&apos;s.

The*CASHIER*puts fries in 95% of the time. OBSERVE sometimes when you go out to eat at McDonald&apos;s or Wendys or Burger King. Once in a while, SOMEONE ELSE will put the fries in. Again, I am NOT talking about drive-thru.

The*CASHIER*99% of the time fills the drink as long as it&apos;s not a self-serve place. Wendy&apos;s DOESN&apos;T HAVE SELF-SERVE soft drinks that I&apos;ve EVER encountered. Plus they don&apos;t&quot;MAKE the drink&quot;, they FILL a cup with ice and soft drink or whatever drink.

&quot;You are comparing that to someone who takes your phone order.&quot;

If you are right by the register, gee, putting it in is***EXACTLY***like taking an order if the person was actually in front of you in person. Don&apos;t you get this?

&quot;Walks you through the menu describing items mind you.&quot;

NOT if you know 100% exactly what you want, which with internet menus for these chain restaurants, there&apos;s no reason for someone not to know what comes in an entree. If you do describe items to them, that is just like if I asked Wendy&apos;s to describe one of their sandwiches. What&apos;s the difference here?

&quot;special requests besides&quot;no mustard&quot;, more like&quot;I want this side with this, blah blah blah&quot;&quot;

I order SPECIAL at ALL fast food places. McRib I order without pickles and with mayonnaise. I order a cup with mayonnaise for the fries with that. If I get a filet O&apos;fish or fish sandwich at Burger King, I order tartar sauce in a cup and extra tartar sauce on the sandwich. If I order a single at Wendy&apos;s, I order it with lettuce, mayo, and onions only as well as a cup with some mayo. So WHAT&apos;S THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS, HUH?

&quot;runs it out to your car, takes payment, runs back in to take the payment, runs back out to your car, and you are on your way.&quot;

As I stated before, anytime someone*BRINGS*me my food, drink, rings me up, and comes back with change or credit card slip, they**ARE INDEED***doing a SERVICE. If I go to get it inside as&quot;COUNTER SERVICE&quot;like McDonald&apos;s, KFC, etc., then I will NOT TIP unless it was a really HUGE order. I have NEVER gotten curb-side-to-go, because I hardly EVER get take-out, but the few times I have, I just went INSIDE to pick it up.

Also, there have been times where McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, etc., have brought out the person&apos;s food due to a large order in drive-thru, that the*MANAGERS*make the employees to make them pull up. So, see, there&apos;s another similiarity right there.

&quot;You are ACTUALLY comparing these two?&quot;

You don&apos;t realize there are SO MANY things that are SIMILAR? Are you that dumb?

&quot;You have NO IDEA what you are talking about, NONE WHAT-SO-EVER.&quot;

NO, that&apos;s YOU 100%. You***OBSERVE****what McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, etc. does and see if I&apos;m not correct. Don&apos;t you know that the CASHIER does the filling of the cup of soft drink? It&apos;s TRUE, I KNOW, because I REMEMBER quite a number of times at Wendy&apos;s, IDIOT!

&quot;EVERY single thread continuously tells you that you have NO CLUE what restaurant staff ACTUALLY.&quot;

Because, OF COURSE they want more money and so did I when I worked at the donut shop. SO WHAT I got paid more than $2 or $3/hr, but that doesn&apos;t mean what I did always constitute a tip when it doesn&apos;t constitute it at McDonald&apos;s, but for some reason, people tipped anyway. I don&apos;t get that they want to play UNFAIR by not tipping them, but tipping me for the SAME things such as a black coffee to-go.

&quot;You are looking like a fool.&quot;

YOU are, because you KNOW I am 100% correct when I tell you the*CASHIER*at Wendy&apos;s fills that cup of soft drink, you IDIOT! THE CASHIER puts that burger in a bag and fries in the bag 99% of the time. Sure, there may be a time or 2 that someone else puts it in the bag, but MOST, MOST, of the time, it&apos;s the*CASHIER*that puts it in the bag. LOOK WHO&apos;S THE FOOL!

tipqueen
&quot;There is no comparison between the 2&quot;

There IS, you idiot, just read the above. Even McDonald&apos;s brings out your food at times for some drive-thru customers that have huge orders. I&apos;ve even done that, by my MANAGER telling me to ask the customers to move up, due to loosing the customers that are waiting for things that take MUCH less time.

 lords: DO NOT TRY AND TELL ME WHAT MY JOB DESCRIPTION IS AND WHAT DO I DO EVERY NIGHT. HAVE YOU EVER WORKED THE TAKE OUT IN A CASUAL DINNING CHAIN?

have you ever stopped to observe what does the take o ut employee does. no because most of the work is done in the kitchen where annoying people like yourself have to stay away. how are you so sure the food comes in a box. let me explain something to you...IT DOES NOT COME IN A F*****BOX...it comes in a plate with foil under the food. i take the burning plate and slide the freaking foil in the box. if the foils is to juicy i change it. then if required i label the stupid box, not with a sticker with my handwriting...

how can you tell me what do i do every night and how to do it when you have no clue. the only thing you can do is exactly that WORK AT A FAST FOOD PLACE. you could never even start to imagine handling a take out rush.

customers like you are the ones that should tip. i want 5 sides of ranch per order, 3 sides of tartar sauce, 4 breads hot not cold, extra this and that, 86 this, this, and that...all those things you request are my responsability. if you are a regular and don&apos;t tip you can forget about all those little extras you&quot;NEED&quot;....

You didn&apos;t seem to know that Weight Watchers&apos;entrees didn&apos;t come with french fries(that would require a modicum of common sense, of course). Besides, in my previous restaurant(and with most restaurants for that matter), the actual ingredients aren&apos;t generally listed. So if you were allergic to, say, ginger, you&apos;d probably have to ask. Or if you were bothered by red peppers, you would probably need to make sure that they weren&apos;t part of the dish.

Oh wait, I forgot - you are just interested in burgers and fried cheese sticks.

 Loads,
I don&apos;t have to observe, I WORKED at McDonalds as a swing manager when I was 17-18 yrs old.

I have also worked at several restaurants, have friends that SPECIFICALLY do ToGo at restaurants like Outback, and my sister was a manager last year at Outback.

YOU, however, have never done EITHER, yet act like you know everything, and even say I don&apos;t have a clue what I&apos;M talking about. Thats laughable.

I&apos;m TELLING YOU, from actual experience, it&apos;s not even close to the same. Packing a piece of chicken with some biscuits from a heat lamp 5 feet away is NOT the same as packing and setting up a togo order at any other restaurant.

At McDonalds, the cashier USUALLY has a runner who gets EVERYTHING. If it&apos;s super slow, they&apos;ll be alone, big deal, grab a sandwhich 5 feet away and put it in a bag, grab fries 5 feet away, put it in a bag, hand you a cup, have a nice day.

You seem to think running out to your car is worthy of a tip, but completely don&apos;t accept the fact that running 50 feet to the kitchen, packing your sauces, special orders, verifying orders with the guest, the added responsibility of tons of different ingredients, side options, etc... is the same as KFC and doesn&apos;t deserve a tip.

Trust me, the McDonalds people are mixing bodily fluids into your mayo and tartar when you do stupid crap like that, they HATE stupid requests like that, and $6/hr employees WILL do that, I&apos;ve seen it MANY times.

Again, if you honestly can&apos;t see the difference, you need help....

 Lords, the problem your having with understanding the issue is what your comparing:

Server vs Counter/Cashier

Sure, the job may seem the same, but what about:

Taxi Driver vs Bus Driver

Why tip taxi, but not bus?

Can you answer that, Lords?

&quot;IT DOES NOT COME IN A F*****BOX...it comes in a plate with foil under the food. i take the burning plate and slide the freaking foil in the box. if the foils is to juicy i change it. then if required i label the stupid box, not with a sticker with my handwriting.&quot;

For one thing, as I said before, comparing a pasta dish and a cup with tartar sauce at McDonald&apos;s is the SAME AMOUNT of work. If you change the foils as you said sometimes you have to as well as write something on it, well that&apos;s what you get your $3.80/hr for, DON&apos;T YOU GET THAT YOU GET PAID FOR DOING*SOMETHING*for the company? Also, as far as writing it goes, McDonald&apos;s has to put a sticker and write on the sticker on the sandwich at times, depending on what McDonald&apos;s it&apos;s at.

&quot;The only thing you can do is exactly that WORK AT A FAST FOOD PLACE.&quot;

NO, I worked at the donut shop with CALL-IN orders and orders TO-GO, dumbass. THAT IS*NOT*fast food. They did*COOK*99% of the things to order. The non-donut food was ALL cooked to order. McDonald&apos;s lets it sit under a heat lamp, IDIOT.

&quot;You didn&apos;t seem to know that Weight Watchers&apos;entrees didn&apos;t come with french fries(that would require a modicum of common sense, of course).&quot;

Since the*MENU*stated&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;and the only exclusions were the rollsups, but NOT an exception for the Weight Watcher&apos;s sandwich. As far as common sense goes, if it&apos;s listed EXACTLY on the menu, THAT is what they HAVE TO go by, otherwise, it&apos;s FALSE ADVERTISING. That is still a&quot;SANDWICH&quot;, so it is supposed to include fries as it states. What section it was under is IRRELEVANT to what the menu states.&quot;ALL&quot;means&quot;ALL&quot;with NO EXCLUSIONS for***ANY***of the sandwiches. Don&apos;t you get that I read that&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;, so that is WHY I didn&apos;t ask or think otherwise? If the menu states it, just like a coupon that managers go&quot;WORD FOR WORD&quot;by, then WHY would the menu be ANY different. One time I asked if the appetizer I made as my entree could be used with a coupon that had $5 off 2 entrees and you know what, OF COURSE they didn&apos;t except it, because on the****MENU****it&apos;s an*APPETIZER*, NOT AN ENTREE. The menu states it comes with something, it is supposed to come with that item, NO EXCEPTIONS unless the server tells you they are out of the item. Then, they should offer a substitution or a discount off the bill due to the missing item.

Ah, once again trying to get something for free. You are the cheapest human being I have ever had the displeasure of coming across. Why should they give you a discount if they told you up front that the item was unavailable? You&apos;re a common thief.

Neither is chilis or applebees. It&apos;s a restaurant with servers, cooks, dishwashers, managers, hostesses and bartenders, ie a Family Restaurant.

You worked in a donut shop. People work in Fast Food, and others work in Fine Dining. The concepts are different, which also pay differently in some cases and have curb-side service, or bartenders taking the togo order.

My statement still stands, if you want to be uncaring and treat these people like McD&apos;s employees, then that&apos;s your problem. Tsk Tsk, so uncaring and unfair.*shakes head*

Yes, that was the sandwiches, burger and rollup section. It wasn&apos;t the Weight Watcher&apos;s section.

&quot;What section it was under is IRRELEVANT to what the menu states&quot;.

You&apos;re simply wrong. Simple as that. If it had been a global announcement, it wouldn&apos;t have been in THE SANDWICH SECTION, it would have been outside any particular section.

Besides, the listing stated EXACTLY what the sandwich was served with, with a picture of the actual plate. Here it is,&quot;WORD FOR WORD&quot;:

TANGO CHICKEN SANDWICH
Grilled and seasoned chicken breast topped with reduced-fat cheese and a barbecue ranch sauce. Served on a toasted wheat bun with lettuce, tomato and red onion with fresh fruit on the side.

Nope, no fries.

You lose.

Again.

 The only thing that bugs me is the expectation for the customer to know how the pay system works in different types of restaurants. It sounds like the employer who should be compensating you for working take out, not the customer in form of a tip. The service you provide is the same as a fast food restaurant.
-The people in the kitchen put the food in the boxes and give them to you... just like a fast food restaurant.
-You have to make sure the order is correct. Just like a fast food restaurant.
-You have to take phone orders. Just like the guy at the drive through at the fast food restaurant takes it through a microphone.
-However... your job IS easier because at peak lunch time hours at fast food places like McDonalds, Taco Bell etc. That guy at the window who you look down upon because you are working at Applebee&apos;s is processing up to 130 orders per hour. He is taking the orders and money, and verifying that you get the correct items in the bag. And he&apos;s not allowed to keep a tip... huh.

All I&apos;m saying is don&apos;t blame the customer for a bad pay plan. Blame your employeer and get a different line of work.

You are providing the same SERVICE as a fast food restaurant as far as the customer can see as you are handing them food in a bag they are paying for without waiting on them at a table. You should not EXPECT a tip.

You&apos;re wrong. Simple as that.

&quot;It sounds like the employer who should be compensating you for working take out, not the customer in form of a tip&quot;.

Actually, it sounds like you want to get over by paying the same price for food that is priced according to people making far less than minimum wage and doing table service. I can guarantee you that if to-go people are to be paid to sell $2000 worth of food during a shift as they were in my previous restaurant, YOU will be paying more, even if the restaurant pays more directly per hour. YOU will pay with higher food costs and actually, the only fair thing to do would be to add an automatic&quot;to-go charge&quot;since those who are paying their servers directly through tipping shouldn&apos;t have to suffer for the convenience of you.

&quot;That guy at the window who you look down upon because you are working at Applebee&apos;s is processing up to 130 orders per hour&quot;.

From my experience, I don&apos;t see a window person processing 2 cars a minute for a straight hour. I think that you&apos;re exaggerating for effect.

&quot;All I&apos;m saying is don&apos;t blame the customer for a bad pay plan. Blame your employeer and get a different line of work&quot;.

And don&apos;t expect to get something for nothing either. Until you&apos;ve had to process the equivalent of 8 four tops simultaneously(meals costing a combined couple of hundred bucks), you have no concept of how much more&quot;difficult&quot;it is than throwing fries, burgers and drinks in a bag. And, considering how many times I&apos;ve gotten the wrong burger, or the wrong sized fries or drinks, I don&apos;t think that there&apos;s much&quot;verification going on. I know that they don&apos;t unpack the bag and show each item to me like they did in my previous restaurant.

I would also question the wisdom of someone who had taken the picture and name of a very money-hungry ex-televangelist who used to fleece his following...

 If you already have an opinion Robert, then why did you solicit any advice? You asked if you were wrong 2 days ago. Now you are handing out suggestions as to where we shouldn&apos;t work if we dont agree with you, as well as what we should expect. I have an idea, I&apos;ll tell you what I expect, o.k.? You are a piece of work buddy. Formerly Jammie

 ROBERT:

you asked and we explained a lot of things that as i can see, you did not read or even take into consideration. again someone comparing what i do to what a fast food employee does is ridiculous and for me it is still a very cheap way to get out of tipping. you do not want to tip us, then simply go to those fast food restaurants.

if the expectation of trying to figure out how the pay system works bothers you so much, ask. i have a lot of customers that don&apos;t know how it goes and they think i get paid $8+per hour. when i explain to them what i get paid and they see what i do most of them have no problem at all tipping. the ones that have problems tipping don&apos;t even ask, they don&apos;t even try to make eye contact. the best are the ones that get out of their car with the excuse of not tipping. another cheap excuse because again, i have to pack your food. my job description is not looking pretty while i carry your bag of food to your car(as an idiot once told my manager)

let me clarify this again...THE FOOD DOES NOT COME IN A BOX, WE PUT IT IN THE BOX. the same goes for mashed potatoes, grilled onions, mushrooms, veggies, potato sides, ketchup, oil, vinegar, ranch, honey mustard, etc. if i am not mistaken in fast food everything comes in little packets. again, you get the wrong stuff at a fast food, once you get home do you call back and complain and get your free food? um, nope. in the casual dinning, SINCE THE CUSTOMER EXPECTS A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE, you better get that order right.

you think people understand why do you have a 45 minute wait for food. some of them don&apos;t. 45 minutes wait for food happens when in an hour you have 30+orders. try to deal with that. you are going to say well fast food has an 80+orders per hour. yep the rush then goes to the cook, re-heating your food(not cooking it fresh)and packing up the food. the other person just takes everything and throws it in the bag. if you are at the drive thru and you see 10 cars before you you know there is a wait. when you call an order and i tell you 40 minutes and you show up and see 3 cars parked before you and wait the most 5 minutes, you leave happy.

the only time i have seen a fast food rush is in hurricane season, after the storm, when nothing else is open. now that is a rush....TRY WORKING CASUAL DINNING TAKE OUT DURING MOTHER&apos;S DAY, VALENTINE&apos;S DAY, CHRISTMAS EVE, AND.....AFTER A HURRICANE WHEN THE OTHER THING OPENED IS A FAST FOOD....

oh and the
&quot;well if you don&apos;t like it get a better job&quot;is very used out. again cheap people use it all the time. if i didn&apos;t make money thanks to the intelligent and educated people that tip me starting at 10%, i would not do it. it just gets very frustrating serving these uneducated people for free.

Why should they give you a discount if they told you up front that the item was unavailable?

Because if its not available, then you arent getting the amount of items for your money that you paid. If anything, the CUSTOMER is being JIPPED out of the item if the manager doesnt give something in the place of the missing item. Like lets say they are out of cinnamon apples that come with the ribs at Chilis. The cook SHOULD include a substitution such as extra fries or a small amount of a side dish like beans to COMPENSATE for the $13.99 price. If they dont, then the RESTAURANT is RIPPING OFF THE CUSTOMER to charge them STILL $13.99, but DONT RECEIVE $13.99 worth of items.

You&apos;re a common thief.

NO, the MANAGER is a thief if he or she doesnt provide*SOMETHING*to make up for the missing item or make the price lower like $12.99 due to the missing cinnamon apples if the customer prefers not to have extra fries or a small amount of a side item. Dont you get that the CUSTOMER would be paying for items NOT received, which is STEALING from the customer, NOT the customer stealing from the restaurant? HOW CAN YOU SERIOUSLY NOT SEE THAT THE MANAGER IS ROBBING CUSTOMERS FROM GETTING THE ITEMS FOR THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT IS BEING CHARGED IF HE DOESNT MAKE UP FOR THE MISSING ITEM IN*SOME*WAY OR ANOTHER?

Tell me WHY should I pay the FULL $13.99, if I DONT RECEIVE the cinnamon apples or extra fries? If they are out of an item, I should either get the price reduced, not serve the entre at all, or give some type of substitution for the $13.99 price, otherwise, I would be paying for the cinnamon apples in the price and not be receiving an item I am paying for.

There was a restaurant that was kind of like Luthers bbq where you go up and place your order at the window in 1997. Anyway, they came out with coupons for students on campus at the college I went to at the time. The coupon stated basically this: Free small drink and frie with the purchase of*ANY*sandwich. There were NO EXCLUSIONS on the coupon as I felt there should be when I ended up using it and had a problem. What happened was, the seafood sandwiches(which we call po-boys down here), came with fries on the menu and the rest of the po-boy sandwiches such as turkey or ham DIDNT come with fries. Well, my mom and I ordered a shrimp po-boy to split, because these were like sub sandwiches, which were big. Anyway, when I mentioned the extra free frie, the workers were arguing with me and I showed them and talked about that the coupon states*ANY*po-boy sandwich, so I told her to either LOWER the price of the sandwich or give us the free fries. Well, eventually, we won of course, because they DIDNT have ANY EXCLUSIONS. Technically we got 2 orders of fries, which one of them was the free one and one of them was the one that the sandwich came with. I dont remember the exact price, but lets say if it was $5.99, then if I wouldnt have received the free fries, they would have been ripping me off of the coupon. It should be that just like what happened, that we received the free fries. If the seafood po-boy sandwiches wouldnt come with fries, they would be like $4.99 more than likely at LEAST. At LEAST a dollar less more than likely, because an order of fries normally cost around a dollar. So they were trying to get out the coupon price. I SHOWED THEM THE THIEVES!

You&apos;re simply wrong. Simple as that. If it had been a global announcement, it wouldn&apos;t have been in THE SANDWICH SECTION, it would have been outside any particular section.

NO, if the menu states ALL SANDWICHES WITH*NO*EXCLUSIONS for ANY of the sandwiches, then it supposed to come with fries, PERIOD!

Besides, the listing stated EXACTLY what the sandwich was served with, with a picture of the actual plate. Here it is,&quot;WORD FOR WORD&quot;:
TANGO CHICKEN SANDWICH
Grilled and seasoned chicken breast topped with reduced-fat cheese and a barbecue ranch sauce. Served on a toasted wheat bun with lettuce, tomato and red onion with fresh fruit on the side.

Each listing DOESNT contain fries.

Like the Bacon Cheeseburger doesnt list FRIES RIGHT BY the sandwich, so doesnt ANY of the sandwiches. So you are trying to prove a bunch of nothing, because there isnt ANY PROOF of what you are saying. For the tango chicken sandwich, the customer gets 2 side items according to the menu. You dont know what ALL SANDWICHES with NO EXCLUSIONS means? Sections DONT MEAN A DAMN THING. If its stated on the MENU, it comes with it, PERIOD!

 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 0menu%20%20pdf%22 

All sandwiches, rollups, and burgers(Except Steak Fajita Rollup)includes fries

READ UP IDIOT!

Nope, no fries.

Uh, YES, FRIES. Dont you see that by stating ALL SANDWICHES with NO EXCLUSIONS what-so-ever, that the Tango Chicken sandwich comes with fruit*AND*fries. That is the ONLY other SANDWICH on the menu. IT IS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH FRIES AS WELL AS THE FRUIT. ALL SANDWICHES MEANS EXACTLY THAT, NO IFS ANDS, BUTS, OR EXCLUSIONS ABOUT IT.

You lose.

Again.

YOU LOSE, YOU MEAN. You didnt prove A DAMN THING, because the listing for the ALL the sandwiches DONT contain right under them&quot;fries&quot;, IDIOT. Its NOT JUST THAT SANDWICH that doesnt have fries listed directly underneath them. LOOK AT MY PROOF!

 Lords, what you lack is common sense. Most people understand that when parts of a menu are sectioned off, the comments about sides pertain to that section of the menu. Why on earth would a weight watchers sandwich come with fries? Common sense would tell you it doesn&apos;t.

You sound like a frustrated lawyer wannabe, always fighting about stupid little things that normal people don&apos;t worry about. You want whatever you can get for free and everybody&apos;s a thief and out to get you. Do you think that&apos;s normal?

Your story about the po boy is just sad. You actually had fries in front of you but had to fight to get more fries for free? Does your cheapness and trying to get something for free ever end?

I can guarantee that you&apos;re legendary in the food industry in your area and that you indeed ingest much more than you order. I&apos;m sure they&apos;re thinking&quot;here comes that cheapass prima donna who wants us to bow to her, let&apos;s give her a freebie she&apos;ll never know about. Fo sho!! So they stand there and smile while you drink the&apos;rita they just spit in, or worse.

And you deserve it. You are a pig.

Enjoy your dinner tonight, and I have pity for whomever has to wait on your skanky ass.

 Oh, and I forgot to add: it&apos;s because of you that simple appliances have to come with stupid instructions. Like when you buy a hairdryer and it says not to use it while sleeping, or not to step into a tub full of water while using it. It&apos;s because dummies like you that don&apos;t have common sense so everything has to be spelled out or else their liable for a lawsuit for the consumer&apos;s simple stupidity.

 I know Jammie, it&apos;s scary. I guess everything really does go back to bad parenting. From the few comments she&apos;s made about her mother, it&apos;s obvious that she was raised this way. It&apos;s still not an excuse to live with her head up her ass.

Listening to her talk about restaurant, grocery store and now a sub shop experiences it&apos;s definite that her whole area knows what a cheapass she is. I&apos;d love to be a fly on the wall.

NO, the MENU stated it did, so I went with what the MENU stated. Remember, what&apos;s in*WRITING*means EVERYTHING. There&apos;s proof on that pdf menu that I&apos;m 100% correct.

&quot;You actually had fries in front of you but had to fight to get more fries for free?&quot;

The COUPON STATED we were supposed to get the fries free as long as you buy a sandwich, so it&apos;s the OWNER of the restaurant than wanted the customers to get the free fries, otherwise, he or she would have included SOME EXCLUSIONS if they didn&apos;t want the seafood po-boy sandwiches to get the free fries. You act like I asked for them to give me free fries just to do it or something. BLAME THE STUPID IDIOT that wrote the damn coupon! DON&apos;T BLAME THE INNOCENT CUSTOMER!

&quot;And you deserve it. You are a pig.&quot;

You deserve it. I bet YOU are overweight that you are calling me a pig. LOOK AT YOURSELF!

 You sound more stupid every time you post. The menu stated fries came with every sandwich within that section of the menu. No owner of a sub shop that a greedy customer would actually come in and demand more fries on top of the fries they already got just to be cheap and get a freebie. Common sense Lord of Ass, try it if you can acheive it.

You aren&apos;t an innocent customer, you&apos;re a low-life scammer. And I&apos;m five foot nine inches tall and weigh 120 soaking wet. You seem to be a little sensitive about your weight. If you&apos;re as small as you say you are I bet it wouldn&apos;t be hard to kick your ass into next week, and that&apos;s probably going to happen to you eventually.

Enjoy your ranch and tartar sauce tonight. Ask politely for extra napkins so you can wipe that swill from your huge lower lip this evening, please. Spare decent humans dining in your vicinity the gross vision of your precious condiments all over your disgusting face while you pace the server and bitch so you get your swill for free.

&quot;When do mc donalds employees answer the phone.&quot;

When you take a call-in order it&apos;s EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT AS if the person is actually in front of you, so this is STUPID to say that there&apos;s ANY DIFFERENCE in it.



Poll time.... how many HUMANS on this board actually call McDonalds with a take out order??
I personally thought and I&apos;m sure loads of bull will&quot;prove me wrong&quot;on this with some anal one time at band camp story.... but is that not the reason that fast food has drive threw? I have actually called KFC to warn them that I was going to be in at about such and such a time for 40 snackers.(Only because it&apos;s common decencey to do such a thing.)
I can hear it now.....
Thank you for calling McDonald&apos;s. How may I help you?
Yeah GIMME a fish sandwhich, extra tartar. And I mean extra tartar. I want fries. Hot fries. With ketchup, ranch and bbq. I want them when I get there.
Excuse me oh wait I know who you are.... sure come right over and pick it up. Better yet, we know where you live... we&apos;ll bring it to you because we know we have to kiss your butt or corp is getting a call... So let me get this right... You ordered a fish sand with alot of what you think is only tartar sauce... Let us PLEASE serve you a complimentary cup of aids! It&apos;s on the house. Have a nice day! And the person answering the phone hangs up and says... it&apos;s for lords... screw it up. throw it on the floor. pee on it. whatever.

 Posted on Sunday, October 01, 2006 - 02:00 am:   
 tipqueen, I work at a store in Arizona.

Today I got stuck in takeaway. Actually I shouldn&apos;t say stuck because I don&apos;t mind doing it if I&apos;m by myself and don&apos;t have to split tips with anyone. Anyway, today was very busy. I ended up selling $1065 with 39 orders. I did EVERYTHING by myself except for the expo manager bagged up one order for me. I know for a fact that most people(and even most servers)especially some high school kid that works at McDonald&apos;s couldn&apos;t do that while getting everything 100% correct and getting everybody their food in around the time they were quoted(highest I quoted somebody today was 35 min). Would I have done all this for my $6/hr or even say $12/hr(which is the most they pay any cook)and no tips? HELL NO. Luckily just about all of my guests know how hard I work and I was only stiffed one time out of 39. I ended up making $140 plus my $6/hr, which was probably more than any server made. But I know that I worked harder than any of them so I deserved it. I know this because yesterday I served and ended up selling about $900(in six hours)which is more than any server sold today or yesterday and I didn&apos;t work nearly as hard as I did today.

One more thing that makes doing takeway at a casual dining restaurant much harder than McDonald&apos;s that I don&apos;t think anybody has mentioned. There are up to 18 servers that I have to compete with for space and for food. Plus busboys, managers, dishwashers, ect. The kitchen of a busy restaurant can be very crowded and hectic. I&apos;ve never worked fast food but I seriously doubt that its anywhere near as bad.

Lords, did you enjoy the huge loogie that was no doubt in you ranch dressing this evening?

So, you&apos;re wrong.

LOOK AGAIN:
 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 

Do you see anything that states:&quot;IN THIS SECTION ONLY?&quot;I DIDN&apos;T THINK SO. ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES, PERIOD!

&quot;No owner of a sub shop that a greedy customer would actually come in and demand more fries on top of the fries they already got just to be cheap and get a freebie.&quot;

The coupon stated I was supposed to receive a free small drink and small fries with*ANY*sandwich purchased. So if they can&apos;t ABIDE by their coupons, then look who&apos;s trying to get something free from the customer. They tried to take some money from the customer that was supposed to be in the form of extra fries for the customer.

&quot;You&apos;re a low-life scammer.&quot;

NO, I am NOT&quot;SCAMMING&quot;things. The COUPON stated*ANY*with NO EXCLUSIONS. So if anything, by the cashier trying to argue with me about it, was the CASHIER trying to scam us, NOT me. Don&apos;t you get this? The COUPON STATES&quot;EXACT&quot;things of what you can or cannot do. When I asked a waitress at a restaraunt to ask the manager if the appetizer I ordered could be considered an entree to be able to use the coupon, of course the answer was no. So WHY when it&apos;s the CUSTOMER&apos;S TURN to be LITERAL and go WORD-FOR-WORD EXACT, it&apos;s somehow scamming according to you? HOW is going by word for word being a customer according to a coupon ANY DIFFERENT than when a manager decides to not to accept the coupon, because the customer didn&apos;t follow the EXACT WORDING? I went by the EXACT WORDING, just as that manager at that other restaurant told us that we had to purchase 2&quot;ENTREES&quot;NOT 1 appetizer and an entree, to use the $5 off coupon. If they go by EXACT WORDING when it&apos;s their turn, WHY NOT go by EXACT WORDING when it&apos;s the CUSTOMER&apos;S TURN? Isn&apos;t that ONLY THE FAIR WAY TO DO THINGS? They are doing it to us customers, so WHY NOT GO BY THE EXACT WORDING TO THEM?

coorslite
&quot;Poll time.... how many HUMANS on this board actually call McDonalds with a take out order?&quot;

I was talking about that if the take-out server is by the register when they answer the phone, then when the take-out server is taking the order, they can just punch it into the computer as if the person was standing in person and not even bother to write it down, so WHERE is the DIFFERENCE in taking a phone order and taking an order in person for take-out or a McDonald&apos;s? There is NONE! If the register is not by the phone, it&apos;s up to the server to write the order down or not, so don&apos;t blame customers for making you do an extra step. NO ONE is making the server write the order down.

teleburst
&quot;YOU ARE WRONG.
The only sandwiches pictured on that menu are pictured WITH FRIES.&quot;

 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 

ALL the sandwiches though are NOT PICTURED. The Zesty Ranch Chicken sandwich and the Jalapeno Jack Chicken Sandwich are NOT PICTURED AT ALL, so MENTIONING THIS IS A MOOT POINT. This is IRRELEVANT to the argument. NOT EVERY SANDWICH IS PICTURED.

&quot;They don&apos;t have to LIST fries, because that section says that they come with fries and the pictures show that.&quot;

Actually, the&quot;SECTION&quot;doesn&apos;t do ANYTHING, it&apos;s the simple fact that the menu states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;and NO EXCLUSIONS ON ANY OF THE SANDWICHES. DO you see ANYTHING that states&quot;ONLY SANDWICHES IN THIS SECTION&quot;or&quot;EXCLUDING THE TANGO CHICKEN SANDWICH?&quot;I didn&apos;t think so. THERE ISN&apos;T ANYTHING THAT STATES THOSE THINGS.

&quot;When you go to the Weight Watcher&apos;s menu.&quot;

Remember, this is the*APPLEBEE&apos;S*menu, NOT the Weight Watcher&apos;s menu, so mentioning this is IRRELEVANT. Weight Watcher&apos;s is a SEPARATE thing from the Applebee&apos;s menu. Applebee&apos;s is in charge of what comes with each sandwich, NOT WEIGHT WATCHERS.

&quot;Because Weight Watcher&apos;s have to count their&quot;points&quot;, AND the exact dish is photographed exactly as it&apos;s served.&quot;

Again, this is the******APPLEBEE&apos;S MENU*****that includes some Weight Watcher&apos;s items. Read the title of the Weight Watcher&apos;s section:&quot;WeightWatcher&apos;s menu items from*APPLEBEE&apos;S*.&quot;Does it state Weight Watcher items from&quot;WeightWatcher&apos;s?&quot;NO it doesn&apos;t. As I said before, the Tango Chicken sandwich comes with FRUIT AND FRIES. 2 sides it comes with according to the EXACT WAY THEY WROTE THE MENU. They DON&apos;T HAVE**ANYTHING**that states&quot;IN THIS SECTION ONLY&quot;OR ANY EXCLUSIONS to ANY OF THE SANDWICHES, so it COMES WITH FRIES AS WELL AS FRUIT. CAN YOU READ IT? It&apos;s the TRUTH!

&quot;So, you&apos;re wrong.

Again.&quot;

NO,*YOU*are WRONG again. LOOK AT WHAT THE MENU STATES:&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;&quot;MENU ITEMS FROM APPLEBEE&apos;S&quot;&quot;EXCEPT FOR STEAK FAJITA ROLLUP&quot;.

NOWHERE IS THERE****ANYTHING*****ABOUT THAT IT HAS TO BE IN THAT SECTION ONLY. The Tango Chicken Sandwich is even called&quot;SANDWICH&quot;in the name of the entree. It&apos;s a sandwich, so it&apos;s supposed to include FRIES AND FRUIT. There&apos;s NOTHING ABOUT IT HAS TO BE IN THAT SECTION. IF IT&apos;S LISTED ON THE MENU WITH NO EXCEPTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE SANDWICHES, IT COMES WITH FRIES.

WHY do you think I thought my food would be delivered with fries? BECAUSE THE MENU STATES&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;and it doesn&apos;t contain ANY EXCEPTIONS for ANY OF THE SANDWICHES. THAT IS WHAT I BASED THE WAY I ORDERED ON, the EXACT WAY IT WAS WRITTEN. What&quot;SECTION&quot;it&apos;s under doesn&apos;t mean ANYTHING when they put&quot;ALL&quot;and they don&apos;t have&quot;EXCLUSIONS&quot;for the sandwiches. ALL MEANS ALL, PERIOD!

 As someone who is on Weight Watchers, I can tell you, Lords, for a fact that there is no possible way that the Tango Chicken Sandwich entree that appears on the Applebee&apos;s menu can have 7 points if there are fries included. An order of fries cooked in oil can have between 5 and 18 points(or more, depending on the size of the serving). Suppose, for arguments sake, there were fries included with the entree and the fries were only worth 5 points, that would leave a total of 2 points for the sandwich itself. There&apos;s no way the sandwich can only have 2 points, unless it&apos;s just a wheat bun.

The entree has 7 points because the wheat bun has 2 points, the chicken breast has 3 points, the reduced fat cheese and the barbecue ranch sauce probably have a total of 1 point and the fresh fruit has 1 point. That adds up to seven points. No fries.

I printed off the menu and showed it to my eight year old and asked her if the Tango Chicken Sandwich would include fries. She said no because&quot;it&apos;s Weight Watchers and that&apos;s supposed to be healthy&quot;and because&quot;it says All Sandwiches, Rollups and Burgers include fries and that looks just like the name above the Weight Watchers stuff.&quot;She understands the menu and she&apos;s only 8.

Well, you probably did that because you&apos;re really stupid. 99% of humans know how to read a menu and don&apos;t kick up a fuss to get freebies out of the technicalities of a menu. Do you want cream and sugar with your entree too, just because another area of the menu mentions cream and sugar is available with coffee?

Menus and many other things in this world are sectioned-off for a reason. That&apos;s why there are sections. There&apos;s the drive-thru section, the counter section, and of course, there&apos;s Section 8, but I won&apos;t go there right now. We already know you&apos;re trash.

WFT is up with your capslock thing? Do you really think that doing the equivalent to screaming on the internet makes you sound smart or knowledgeable? You sound like a two year old that had her fries taken away.

If you can&apos;t understand the basic reasoning of sections on a menu you should probably stay at home. If you can&apos;t master that very basic concept of normal society you have no business being out and about with normal people.

It probably isn&apos;t your fault that you&apos;re so stupid, somebody obviously didn&apos;t raise you well and teach you common sense. You&apos;re of an age to learn decency and you shun it.

So fark off and die. There&apos;s no excuse for you. You&apos;re a skank and you like it that way. You are useless.

I know those currently in the industry can&apos;t seem to see it from the real world perspective but those who are now outside do. Look at how Robert came in looking for opinions, got industry as well as yours and mine outside and saw some truth in the comparison to fast food, and then got trashed here. No offense, but I think shorter, to the point posts would get you more respect here. You posts are so long and rambling I end up giving up in the middle.

A lot of what you say has nuggets of truth. You are right the actual menu(I looked at it)is a bit misleading with the statement about ALL sandwiches include fries. However, coming with fruit might be a clue that it is instead of fries. But the biggest clue is the calorie count for the chicken sandwich meal of 370 calories --&gt;can&apos;t include fries way too low.(ie fries alone would add 500+cals to the meal)

But I agree it is a little misleading.
BIG_MOMMA: Technically, you could say its in a separate section but the notation is at the top of the page that the item is on.

 Regular guy, are you serious? You don&apos;t understand sections and how sections of a menu work either?

I&apos;m considering taking my children from public school and going with the private schools. This is a good case for going private.

 reg... chicken nuggets maybe. But not many on here will agree with anything it says because...
1. Never worked in a restaurant before.
2. Is a person that uses every&quot;grey&quot;area to get free food.
3. Steals and calls it okay. But will call servers out on every penny.....
and just sucks the life out of anywhere it goes.

 Did you notice it is on the same page? Big Momma: seems like a cheap shot at my education and frankly I have an undergrad engineering degree and an MBA from top 20 National private universities both with honors.

Would I pissed off at not getting fries? I probably would have read the menu as including fries but seeming odd, see my post above, and would have asked. Frankly I might have asked to substitute fries for fruit since they are about the same price as those above.

If I did not ask when I ordered, I would probably be a little surprised, if the server offered to swap one side for another ie fruit for fries = good solution. Probably not enough to dock the server if I felt they could not fix the situation, nor go bananas over. And of course order something else next time.

Bottom line, having served before and being in the outside world I could see how people might not realize the intent. Actually, a footnote in the&quot;section&quot;to the effect,&quot;Thinking of the health of our diners WW entres/sandwiches include fruit instead of fries&quot;or add to the disclaimer at the top of the page,&quot;and WW entrees)&quot;

 &quot;I know those currently in the industry can&apos;t seem to see it from the real world perspective but those who are now outside do.&quot;

I haven&apos;t worked in the industry for over 20 years and I still know how to read sections of a menu and I indeed live in the&quot;real world&quot;and have the&quot;real world&quot;perspective. I don&apos;t expect my ass to be kissed and I don&apos;t scrutinize every menu or server&apos;s actions trying to scam a freebie.

What&quot;real&quot;world are you living in?

Sorry, but I have to ask. What is the&quot;outside world&quot;? Is that the world where people have to be told not to use a hairdryer while sleeping? Did I miss something? Is common sense not expected anymore?

You have an MBA and can&apos;t understand a simple menu that&apos;s sectioned? How&apos;s that working for you?

Not well, obviously.

&quot;how are you so sure the food comes in a box. let me explain something to you...IT DOES NOT COME IN A F*****BOX...it comes in a plate with foil under the food.&quot;

I am being serious here, why doesn&apos;t your kitchen bother to box it???

When I have done take-out its been done by the cook. I guess there are varieties of takeout when I compared it to McDonalds and I still say usually they do all the same things other than bringing it to your car or MAYBE doing sides by hand if needed.

So you guys understand I am talking about picking up from a casual dining non-corporate type diner. I walk in the door, order at the register, its written down, and pay, they turn around and hand it to the kitcen through the window(literally). The food comes back in 2 styrofoam boxes in the window, which the person takes and puts in a bag with the prepacked(utensils and napkin)turns around and hands it to me.

No offense in this situation, they actually do less than when you walk into McDonalds, right?(At McDonalds they usually have to scoop the fries themselves and have to do more walking around.)

For a fact that there is no possible way that the Tango Chicken Sandwich entree that appears on the Applebee&apos;s menu can have 7 points if there are fries included.

For one thing, I DID NOT order that chicken sandwich because it was WEIGHTWATCHERS. I ordered it because its the ONE grilled chicken sandwich that DOESNT have bacon. I didnt feel like bacon that day. WHY would I have wanted them to charge me an extra $0.50 for something I DIDNT want? Also I wanted to have mozzarella sticks to share with my husband as our appetizer, so if I wanted to be able to eat part of the appetizer and my entre, I wanted a SMALLER sandwich than the bbq chicken grill. So someone also could be ALLERGIC to bacon and order that sandwich. Does that mean that*ALL*people that order that sandwich are concerned about POINTS? OF COURSE NOT. I didnt read the POINTS part, because I was ordering my FOOD, which I was ONLY CONCERNED about my FOOD.

If the menu would have stated All sandwiches in this SECTION include fries, then I would have known for a fact that that Tango Chicken sandwich didnt include fries, but as regularguy states, SANDWICHES is at the top of the page, but I would have automatically assumed it didnt come with fries, because the sections were sectioned off a little by the title of each section. But the menu DIDNT state In this section or The above entrees include fries. SO HOW ARE PEOPLE THAT DONT NORMALLY EAT WEIGHTWATCHERS FOODS ARE NOT GOING TO THINK THEY WILL RECEIVE FRIES? I keep my weight well under 100lbs. I am 90lbs-92lbs, and sometimes go up to 93lbs and sometimes go back to 88 and half lbs like I did Friday. I WOULDNT have a CLUE about HOW the POINTS work, so WHY should you assume that the SOLE PURPOSE of ordering a WeightWatchers item is because they are watching their weight? As I stated before, you havent thought about allergies or not wanting bacon or wanting a smaller sandwich. Also, if you read the description of each grilled chicken sandwich, they arent the SAME. One had wheat bread. What if someone wants Wheat and thats the SOLE PURPOSE on getting that sandwich? Also, the bbq chicken sandwich is NOT seasoned, but the Tango Chicken sandwich IS. You act like EVERYONE that orders the WEIGHTWATCHERS MENU ITEMS ARE DEFINITELY PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR WEIGHT WHEN THEY ARE DECIDING ON AN ENTRE TO CHOOSE FROM. You are FAR from the truth. I wanted that sandwich because it didnt have bacon. WHY pay more for things you dont want?

&quot;It&apos;s Weight Watchers and that&apos;s supposed to be healthy&quot;

 http://www.weightwatchers.co.uk/food/rcp/index.aspx?recipeid=7015352 

Just to PROVE to you that WeightWatchers DOES have entrees that are SERVED WITH FRIES. Sure, they are baked, which is a healthier way of making fries, but my point is, I am NOT WRONG FOR THINKING THAT I WOULD BE DELIVERED FRIES WITH MY MEAL. Your 8 yr old DOESNT KNOW HOW TO READ IN GREAT DETAIL. She wouldnt make a good lawyer, when she cant see the DETAILS. See how NOT SMART SHE IS.

She understands the menu and she&apos;s only 8. And big_momma 99% of humans know how to read a menu and don&apos;t kick up a fuss to get freebies out of the technicalities of a menu.

I KNOW WHAT THE MENU STATES IN EXACT WORDING JUST LIKE WHEN COUPONS ARE WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY WITH THE PURCHASE OF 2 ENTREES. Does it state APPETIZERS if you order it as your meal? NO, so if they can be VERY TECHINCAL, SO CAN THE CUSTOMER. Shed NEVER make it as a lawyer.

Menus and many other things in this world are sectioned-off for a reason.

Well its on the top of the page, so that SECTIONED OFF stuff doesnt matter UNLESS it stated All sandwiches in this section include fries.

regularguy
You are right the actual menu(I looked at it)is a bit misleading with the statement about ALL sandwiches include fries.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH! I cant believe someone sees it the way I did considering it really has ALL SANDWICHES and doesnt state IN THIS SECTION as SOME MENUS DO. The problem is with this sandwich, it is the ONLY sandwich thats WEIGHTWATCHERS, which thats why it caused a such a problem. Maybe if there were many WeightWatchers sandwiches on the menu, then they would have written the menu better. These people act like I ordered it on purpose or something to get something free. I just didnt want bacon and I didnt want to pay for something I didnt want as well as I wanted a smaller sandwich. Granted, I would have gotten more chicken for my money with the bbq chicken sandwich, but I didnt want that much food and I didnt want bacon. Bacon was my MAIN reason for not ordering the bbq chicken sandwich.

Technically, you could say its in a separate section but the notation is at the top of the page that the item is on.

THANK YOU for also metioning the TOP OF THE PAGE HAS IT THERE EVEN IN BIG LETTERS SANDWICHES. I never ordered a WeightWatchers item before from a restaurant, so I didnt expect not to get fries, because since I read the menu that stated it, I DIDNT ASK.


Probably not enough to dock the server if I felt they could not fix the situation, nor go bananas over.

To me, the server SHOULD be docked SOME for the CUSTOMER KNOWING THE MENU BETTER THAN THEY DO. Thats ASHAME that this happened and the waitress and food runner argued with me about it. Telling me about the SECTION when I KNOW FOR A FACT it states ALL SANDWICHES and no exceptions to that were listed, so I TRULY BELIEVED what I read.

 regular, nobody was rude to Robert until he got on his high horse. Then proceeded to tell us to find another job and all of that lame crap. He directly asked if he was wrong, 2 days later he had formed an opinion. O.K. thats fine but extended the opinion as to what servers should expect and telling us to change professions. that was pushing the envelope a little too far. Sorry but Robert earned it. The problem is not that he formed an opinion that differed from mine, I didnt quite like his approach to expressing it. I thought him to be rather rude. Formerly Jammie

 Face it lords you think the server should be docked for everything. Couldn&apos;t get a close parking post, Dock the server. Long wait for a table Dock the server. Too much cigarette smoke, Dock the server. Burnt out light bulb, Dock the server. Dirty bathroom, Dock the server.
Tell me what shouldn&apos;t you dock a server for? Please be more specific than for something thats not their fault. Because I seriously wonder what that might be. Formerly Jammie

 HOW CAN YOU SERIOUSLY NOT SEE THAT THE MANAGER IS ROBBING CUSTOMERS FROM GETTING THE ITEMS FOR THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT IS BEING CHARGED IF HE DOESNT MAKE UP FOR THE MISSING ITEM IN*SOME*WAY OR ANOTHER

How can I&quot;see&quot;this? Well, I can&apos;t I can&quot;Read&quot;it. You see if you - Load of Crap - could read you would see that I said that you were made&quot;Aware&quot;that the item wasn&apos;t available. So if you choose to purchase the item minus the side no one is a thief for not providing you with something extra or even equivalent, they are just giving you what you ordered with full knowledge of what was not going to come with the meal. You are a lazy pig. You purposely look for ways to scam the service industry to save yourself money. You are disgusting, and filthy in ways I can&apos;t speak of here.

 regularguy...ok but i was trying to explain that there is a difference. i know there are places where the take out person just takes the food out to you because the kitchen does everything else, but that is not my case or the case of other casual dinning establishments. in those places where the kitchen does everything else i still tip $2-$5 depending on what i ordered. i always ask though who gets the tips because in some places the tips go to the restaurant and not the employees.

lords: how f******stupid are you. how do you expect something from the weight watchers menu to come with fries. like bigmomma did, her kid understood. it is&quot;OBVIOUS&quot;a simple use of&quot;COMMON SENSE&quot;will help you understand what life is really like. do you even have an IQ, did you even go to school...i mean wow&quot;GET A LIFE&quot;...better yet&quot;GET HELP NOW&quot;...there are doctors that can help you...

&quot;YOU ARE WRONG.
The only sandwiches pictured on that menu are pictured WITH FRIES.&quot;

 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 

ALL the sandwiches though are NOT PICTURED&quot;.

Please learn to read. I didn&apos;t say that ALL sandwiches were pictured. I said that the only sandwiches pictured were pictured with fries, because the pictures on the menu are of the actual servings, just like in the WEIght Watcher&apos;s section.

&quot;Actually, the&quot;SECTION&quot;doesn&apos;t do ANYTHING, it&apos;s the simple fact that the menu states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;and NO EXCLUSIONS ON ANY OF THE SANDWICHES. DO you see ANYTHING that states&quot;ONLY SANDWICHES IN THIS SECTION&quot;or&quot;EXCLUDING THE TANGO CHICKEN SANDWICH?&quot;I didn&apos;t think so. THERE ISN&apos;T ANYTHING THAT STATES THOSE THINGS&quot;.

You are a moron, you know that? You are such an idiot that I&apos;m not going to go into your moronic shouting about what&apos;s Weight Watcher&apos;s and what&apos;s Applebees. You don&apos;t have the brights to get a job that pays more than $7 an hour, so I&apos;m pretty sure that explaining the concept of copyrights and contracts and legal obligations would go right over your head. However, I will say this - it would be false advertising to claim that ordering the Tango Chicken would be 7 points if it also included fries. Simple as that.

&quot;SO HOW ARE PEOPLE THAT DONT NORMALLY EAT WEIGHTWATCHERS FOODS ARE NOT GOING TO THINK THEY WILL RECEIVE FRIES&quot;?

Ummmm, they use common sense, maybe?

Now, you are dismissed.

 Lords, your an idiot.

Reading the menu, it clearly says the following:

All Sandwiches, Rollups, and Burgers(except Steak Fajoita Rollup)include fries.

This is located in the area titled&quot;Sandwiches, Rollups, and Burgers&quot;section of the menu. Duh!

Then on the bottom part has&quot;Weightwatchers&quot;section. Under this section is Apps, Entrees, Dessert, etc that have low calorie type items.

Your seeing the Chicken Sandwich and assuming that because it&apos;s a sandwich, it get&apos;s fries.

Three things that make you a dumbass:
1: Fries have high calories, why put fries on the dish?
2: It&apos;s under the&apos;Entree&apos;portion of weightwatchers. The name of the item has sandwich in it, but it&apos;s considered an entree.
3: You could have easily asked the server if the low-calorie items include fries. But you didn&apos;t, you instead assumed, then made a big fuss and posted your drivel on the boards in hopes of someone supporting your insane thoughts.

You got one idiot to support your idiotic confusion, but everyone else with common sense on the board agrees with one thing: Your a moron.

 Seriously, Lords you are an idiot. If I were the server in that situation I would have subsituted the fruit or whatever for the fries no problem at all(although I would have thought you a moron for ordering a weight watcher&apos;s meal with fries)if you had just asked me. You are simply an idiot. An idiot that ingests the bodily fluids of servers/cooks on a regular basis.

 Run down of the world according to LOA:

It&apos;s my grandmother&apos;s fault that she got lung cancer and died.

It&apos;s jena&apos;s grandfather&apos;s fault that he got cancer and died.

Big momma&apos;s 8 y/o can&apos;t be a lawyer because she&apos;s not smart enough at 8 to understand how a woman with a severe personality disorder thinks.

File clerks are more important than servers.

The sun rises in the west.

Servers are responsible for every thing that happens inside of the restaurant...from the temperature of a meal to the shrieking kids in the back to the bad day LOA had before coming into the place.

Perfect service never happens unless the server follows LOA&apos;s constantly changing guidelines.

You can eat the most high fat foods on the planet and drink along with them as long as you are mildly anorexic the rest of the week.

If a doctor tells you that your diet is detrimental to your health, he&apos;s wrong and uncaring.

All servers are selfish and uncaring because they go to work in order to make money.

The legal system works the way LOA says it does...not the way my doctorate professors claim.

Getting worked up over every little thing is the right way to live.

Thinking only about yourself is the way everyone is, and it&apos;s okay...unless you happen to be a server. Then it&apos;s a mortal sin.

I think I got it all.

LOA, shut yer piehole. &quot;Life&apos;s gonna suck when you grow up&quot;

&quot;Tell me what shouldn&apos;t you dock a server for? Please be more specific than for something thats not their fault.&quot;

The server is supposed to compare the menu with what they are serving and charging you, that is there JOB. Not getting a parking space or waiting for a table has NOTHING to do with the*SERVICE*what-so-ever. Be brought the correct food according to what&apos;s described on the menu IS part of the service that a customer receives. The server was DOCKED for her not comparing the menu with the plate of food. HOW can you say that it&apos;s not their fault the fries weren&apos;t with the entree? For one thing, the waitress could have told the cook*BEFORE*bringing out our food&quot;Oh this comes with fries according to the menu&quot;, so fix an order of fries with this entree BEFORE I take the food to the customers. THAT****IS****IN THEIR CONTROL 100%!

rev_rund
&quot;That you were made&quot;Aware&quot;that the item wasn&apos;t available. So if you choose to purchase the item minus the side no one is a thief for not providing you with something extra or even equivalent, they are just giving you what you ordered with full knowledge of what was not going to come with the meal.&quot;

SO tell me HOW in the world is that FAIR to the people that get the item for their money? I pay $13.99, but don&apos;t receive something for the missing item just because they are out of it, so I have to pay the same amount of money. THAT&apos;S A RIP OFF! THAT IS THEFT! YOU HAVE TO REPLACE SOMETHING IN THE PRICE TO MAKE IT WORTH THE EXACT AMOUNT BEING CHARGED, OTHERWISE, IT&apos;S AN OVERCHARGE. YOU KNOW THAT&apos;S THE TRUTH!

penelopemarie
&quot;Lords: how f******stupid are you. how do you expect something from the weight watchers menu to come with fries. like bigmomma did, her kid understood. it is&quot;OBVIOUS&quot;a simple use of&quot;COMMON SENSE&quot;will help you understand what life is really like.&quot;

Did you read that website that has&quot;FRIES&quot;with a WeightWatcher&apos;s Sandwich?

LOOK IDIOT: http://www.weightwatchers.co.uk/food/rcp/index.aspx?recipeid=7015352 

&quot;Cheeseburger with Fries&quot;

Do you understand that&quot;FRIES&quot;CAN BE A PART OF A WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S ENTREE? YOU ARE THE IDIOT!

teleburst

&quot;I said that the only sandwiches pictured were pictured with fries, because the pictures on the menu are of the actual servings.&quot;

NO THIS is what you said:&quot;Besides, the listing stated EXACTLY what the sandwich was served with, with a picture of the actual plate. Here it is,&quot;WORD FOR WORD&quot;

Meaning your conveying to me that it has to have a picture for it to merit that it comes with fries, which it DOESN&apos;T and I PROVED that to you as well as you admitted it, so WHY THE HECK MENTION&quot;THERE&apos;S A PICTURE&quot;if it&apos;s NOT RELEVANT to the arguement?

&quot;You don&apos;t have the brights to get a job that pays more than $7 an hour.&quot;

I DO make MORE THAN THAT.

&quot;However, I will say this - it would be false advertising to claim that ordering the Tango Chicken would be 7 points if it also included fries. Simple as that.&quot;

Well, then WHY did the menu state&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;then?

&quot;Ummmm, they use common sense, maybe?&quot;

You are supposed to go by EXACT WORDING, NOT&quot;ASSUMPTIONS&quot;you IDIOT! Just like the managers go by the EXACT WORDING with a coupon that has&quot;ENTREE&quot;and NOT&quot;APPETIZER.&quot;

merryteri
&quot;At least we can count on Lords to be consistent in her ignorance.&quot;

It&apos;s funny how you can&apos;t respond to the TRUTH that SOME people are NOT ORDERING THE SANDWICH because they are*NOT*concerned with&quot;POINTS&quot;and CALORIES. Some people just want a sandwich with NO BACON. Some people may be allergic. WHY CAN&apos;T YOU ADMIT THIS THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD***NOT***be CONCERNED WITH&quot;POINTS?&quot;YOU KNOW IT&apos;S THE GOD&apos;S TRUTH! YOU ARE AN IDIOT! SO WHY CAN&apos;T YOU ADMIT THIS? ARE YOU SCARED I&apos;M PROVING YOU 100% WRONG THAT*SOME*PEOPLE DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THE POINTS THAT ORDER THIS SANDWICH, SO YOUR ARGUMENT TO ME IS IRRELEVANT, WHICH THAT&apos;S WHY YOU CAN&apos;T RESPOND, BECAUSE I&apos;VE MADE VERY, VERY,*VALID*POSSIBLITES. I bet you can&apos;t admit that I may have made your argument about&quot;points&quot;look STUPID?

vozveratu
&quot;Your seeing the Chicken Sandwich and assuming that because it&apos;s a sandwich, it get&apos;s fries.&quot;

NO, it&apos;s NOT an&quot;ASSUMPTION!&quot;YOU CAN&apos;T OBVIOUSLY READ, CAN YOU?

&quot;ALL SANDWICHES, ROLLUPS, AND BURGERS INCLUDE FRIES(EXCEPT STEAK FAJITA ROLLUP)INCLUDE FRIES&quot;

THAT STATEMENT SAYS IT ALL! DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;MEANS? IT MEANS EVERY ONE ON THE MENU, NOT A CERTAIN SECTION, BECAUSE IT DOESN&apos;T STATE&quot;IN THIS SECTION&quot;OR&quot;THE ABOVE ENTREES&quot;, LIKE OTHER MENUS DO THAT I&apos;VE SEEN. DON&apos;T YOU GET THIS?

&quot;1: Fries have high calories, why put fries on the dish?&quot;

THE MENU STATES IT. THAT IS WHY!

&quot;2: It&apos;s under the&apos;Entree&apos;portion of weightwatchers. The name of the item has sandwich in it, but it&apos;s considered an entree.&quot;

The name&quot;ENTREE&quot;DOESN&apos;T MEAN ANYTHING. THE NAME&quot;SANDWICH&quot;DOES. If you think about it, ALL the meals are truly&quot;ENTREES.&quot;Only sides, appetizers or a cup of soup or side salad would not more than likely be considered an&quot;ENTREE.&quot;Under the STEAK and Neighborhood Favorites sections, I don&apos;t see the word&quot;ENTREE&quot;, so does that mean it wouldn&apos;t be one? OF COURSE NOT. THOSE ARE ENTREES AS WELL. Stating it&apos;s an&quot;ENTREE&quot;is IRRELEVANT, because not only do the other items not have&quot;ENTREE&quot;by them, but that since the tango chicken sandwich is called a&quot;SANDWICH&quot;, which is the main key of this argument,*NOT*if it&apos;s considered an&quot;ENTREE&quot;or not. Calling it an&quot;ENTREE&quot;doesn&apos;t make ANY DIFFERENCE in the fact that the menu states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;with no exceptions to ANY of the sandwiches what-so-ever.

&quot;3: You could have easily asked the server if the low-calorie items include fries.&quot;

For one thing, I NEVER&quot;ASSUMED&quot;, I READ THE MENU AND IT STATES&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;with NO EXCLUSIONS, so why would I bother to&quot;ASK&quot;, if it was*WRITTEN*****EXACTLY****on the menu that ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDED FRIES? I was GOING to ask, but then I saw that part of the menu that had that, so I didn&apos;t. Do you understand if the menu would have stated:&quot;IN THIS SECTION&quot;or&quot;THE ABOVE ENTREES&quot;, I would have known only in that particular section it would have applied to? IT DIDN&apos;T THOUGH, so according to the menu, it&apos;s SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE FRIES. YOU CAN&apos;T READ OBVIOUSLY. I also wasn&apos;t thinking about&quot;CALORIES&quot;as I stated before. I was thinking about I DIDN&apos;T WANT BACON. I don&apos;t think about the&quot;CALORIES&quot;when I dining out. I ONLY think about the calories(S-Th)when I DON&apos;T eat out. Can you see that*SOME*people may order this sandwich for reasons OTHER THAN CALORIES? Maybe they don&apos;t like bacon, maybe they are allergic to bacon, maybe they want a small sandwich? NOT EVERYONE THAT ORDERS THAT SANDWICH IS CONCERNED ABOUT CALORIES. YOU ARE AN IDIOT IF YOU DON&apos;T KNOW THIS!

&quot;But you didn&apos;t, you instead assumed, then made a big fuss and posted your drivel on the boards in hopes of someone supporting your insane thoughts.&quot;

Regularguy does AGREE with me. It&apos;s NOT&quot;INSANE&quot;, because it&apos;s*WORD FOR WORD, EXACTLY HOW IT&apos;S WRITTEN*, which is NOT drivel. It&apos;s STUPID to ONLY THINK that people that are concerned with calories order that sandwich. Since when does a person*HAVE*to be concerned about calories in order to order a WeightWatcher&apos;s menu item?

&quot;Your a moron&quot;

NO, that&apos;s*YOU*for not being able to*READ*THE******EXACT******WORD FOR WORD THAT IS STATED IN THE MENU. ALL MEANS ALL as long as there are no exclusions, which there are none for the sandwiches.

dtugg
&quot;(Although I would have thought you a moron for ordering a weight watcher&apos;s meal with fries)&quot;

WHY, when I wanted NO BACON? So can you tell me*HOW*is that being a&quot;MORON&quot;not to want to pay for something you don&apos;t want? That&apos;s just being a&quot;SMART SHOPPER&quot;looking for the best bargin. THAT&apos;S BEING SMART. YOU ARE AN IDIOT! WHAT&apos;S WRONG WITH WANTING TO SAVE MONEY WHEN YOU CAN?

&quot;If I were the server in that situation I would have subsituted the fruit or whatever for the fries no problem at all.&quot;

There was no need to&quot;SUBSTITUTE&quot;, because it comes with(2)sides: THE FRUIT AND THE FRIES ACCORDING TO THE*EXACT*WORDING ON THE MENU. If I was a server there, I would have told the cook to cook some fries for the sandwich BEFORE taking the tango chicken sandwich out to the customer considering the menu states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;with NO EXCEPTIONS FOR THE SANDWICHES.

thegirl
&quot;Servers are responsible-the temperature of a meal.&quot;

Actually they*CAN BE*if they forget to get it and leave it sit out for 10 minutes, so it GETS COLD. HOW IS THE COOK AT FAULT FOR THE SERVER FORGETTING, HUH? If they forget to get it or they print the ticket&quot;rare&quot;instead of&quot;well done&quot;as it was ordered, well YES, it&apos;s the*SERVER&apos;S*FAULT.

 Are we really still discussing this sandwich? I thought we went through this a year ago.

We all know it doesn&apos;t include fries. If she chooses not to believe us that&apos;s her problem. I do have to admit I am enjoying reading how worked up she is getting over an order of fries.

Lords,
You&apos;re becoming belligerent. You should probably calm down. The name calling is just making everybody laugh at you. Real people just don&apos;t get this upset over fries.

 Did you read that website that has&quot;FRIES&quot;with a WeightWatcher&apos;s Sandwich?

LOOK IDIOT: http://www.weightwatchers.co.uk/food/rcp/index.aspx?recipeid=7015352 

&quot;Cheeseburger with Fries&quot;

Do you understand that&quot;FRIES&quot;CAN BE A PART OF A WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S ENTREE? YOU ARE THE IDIOT!


um, did you read the f******recipe. of course it is served with&quot;fries&quot;....they are baked fries...ok BAKED not fried...a meal that is made to keep or loose weight cannot have fries fries. it is too fattening and it beats the whole purpose. so no i am NOT the IDIOT, YOU ARE THE MORON...again COMMON SENSE


2. Cut potatoes into wedges; boil, steam or microwave until tender. Place wedges, skin side down, on prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with combined pepper and salt. Bake until lightly browned and crispy, about 30 minutes.

 It&apos;s been a little over a year since I worked Crapplehell... but the menu at the store I worked at had a special section for weight watchers. In the entire year that we had it on the menu not one time did I have anyone so ignorant to not realize it did not come with fries as it was on the weight watcher program. True I did have several people request to have fries substituted for the fruit that the menu clearly stated it came with. Simple request from people that can read. I&apos;m not going to go to Crapplehell&apos;s website but there was a disclaimer from weight watchers somewhere on the menu(the ww section)that stated any substitutions voided the point system. Or some wording to that effect. I&apos;m assuming that our store had the only menu that people could understand. Oh wait 99.99% of the people here understand it. I don&apos;t know I guess I&apos;m just an uncaring thief. If I wasn&apos;t so lazy I would point out AGAIN that lords never answered thegirl&apos;s question about her thinking she was intelligent. But I&apos;m too stupid to remember if she ever apologized to her or anyone here that she has personally offended.
Her last post was too ignorant for me to read. Lack of beer or maybe I&apos;m just a moron that just doesn&apos;t care. Whatever Lords... you suck as a human... come back with the name calling... but I just did it all for you... But I sleep well at night. You just suck.

 &quot;HOW can you say that it&apos;s not their fault the fries weren&apos;t with the entree?&quot;
Where did I ever say that it wasnt their fault? I haven&apos;t given an opinion on this issue. I mean really lords we all know Weight Watchers meals should come with fires. Its probably served with a hunk of chocolate cake too. Formerly Jammie

&quot;Lords: how f******stupid are you. how do you expect something from the weight watchers menu to come with fries. like bigmomma did, her kid understood. it is&quot;OBVIOUS&quot;a simple use of&quot;COMMON SENSE&quot;will help you understand what life is really like.&quot;

Did you read that website that has&quot;FRIES&quot;with a WeightWatcher&apos;s Sandwich?

LOOK IDIOT: http://www.weightwatchers.co.uk/food/rcp/index.aspx?recipeid=7015352 

&quot;Cheeseburger with Fries&quot;

Do you understand that&quot;FRIES&quot;CAN BE A PART OF A WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S ENTREE? YOU ARE THE IDIOT&quot;!

Ummmmm, those aren&apos;t fries. Fires are...well...fried. Those are sliced, parboiled baked potatoes. They might*call*them fries, but they aren&apos;t the kind of fries that you get at Applebees.

&quot;teleburst

&quot;I said that the only sandwiches pictured were pictured with fries, because the pictures on the menu are of the actual servings.&quot;

NO THIS is what you said:&quot;Besides, the listing stated EXACTLY what the sandwich was served with, with a picture of the actual plate. Here it is,&quot;WORD FOR WORD&quot;

Meaning your conveying to me that it has to have a picture for it to merit that it comes with fries&quot;,

Well, that&apos;s because you&apos;re not bright enough to understand the written word.

&quot;which it DOESN&apos;T&quot;

The above statement referred to the Tango Chicken Sandwich. You left out the other part, which referred to the sandwich section, where I mentioned the two sandwiches that WERE pictured, both of them with fries. I never said that ALL sandwiches were pictured. Of course, I would be correct if I said that all sandwiches in the Weight Watcher&apos;s section were pictured, right?

&quot;and I PROVED that to you as well as you admitted it, so WHY THE HECK MENTION&quot;THERE&apos;S A PICTURE&quot;if it&apos;s NOT RELEVANT to the arguement&quot;?

I don&apos;t know what you think you&quot;proved&quot;, but the relevance is that no sandwich that is supposed to&quot;come with fries&quot;is pictured without fries, AND the Tango Chicken Sandwich is pictured exactly as it is supposed to come, with exactly what&apos;s described in the description. Don&apos;t blame Applebee&apos;s if you can read the WORD FOR WORD description or can&apos;t see the picture that&apos;s right in front of you.

&quot;It&apos;s funny how you can&apos;t respond to the TRUTH that SOME people are NOT ORDERING THE SANDWICH because they are*NOT*concerned with&quot;POINTS&quot;and CALORIES&quot;.

That&apos;s fine. Just order the fries separately. Nobody&apos;s stopping you from doing that. It&apos;s obvious to anyone with half a brain that the Weight Watcher&apos;s menu has specific items that have been carefully assembled to meet the criteria of the Weight Watcher&apos;s point system, but there&apos;s nothing stopping you from ordering the fires separately, since they&apos;re listed as an ala carte item. Heck, you can order fries with your dessert as well. In fact, I bet that if they had an ice cream sandwich dessert, you&apos;d demand fries with IT too.

&quot;&quot;3: You could have easily asked the server if the low-calorie items include fries.&quot;

For one thing, I NEVER&quot;ASSUMED&quot;, I READ THE MENU AND IT STATES&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;with NO EXCLUSIONS, so why would I bother to&quot;ASK&quot;, if it was*WRITTEN*****EXACTLY****on the menu that ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDED FRIES&quot;?

Well, it was written&quot;****EXACTLY****&quot;on the menu what came on the plate AND there was a photo of the plate. Suddenly&quot;exactly&quot;doesn&apos;t matter?

&quot;There was no need to&quot;SUBSTITUTE&quot;, because it comes with(2)sides: THE FRUIT AND THE FRIES ACCORDING TO THE*EXACT*WORDING ON THE MENU. If I was a server there, I would have told the cook to cook some fries for the sandwich BEFORE taking the tango chicken sandwich out to the customer considering the menu states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;with NO EXCEPTIONS FOR THE SANDWICHES&quot;.

You are SO wrong here. The sandwich DOESNT COME WITH FRIES. How many times do you have to be told that? As others have pointed out, all you had to do was ask, but no, you saw the statement in another section of the menu and were blinded by it. It struck you so blind that you couldn&apos;t see the picture of the plate nor read the description. And that was dumb, because all you had to do was ask a server who couldn&apos;t read your mind to see if you could substitute fries for the fruit salad and see what the house policy was for that. And if that particular restaurant wouldn&apos;t do it, well, you were free to order some fries all on your own. But don&apos;t blame the server for giving you the exact dish that you were ordered. Gee, even an 8 year old can look at a picture(in fact, that&apos;s why they put pictures on a menu...for those who don&apos;t even have the intellect of an 8 year old). Of course, an 8 year old isn&apos;t old enough to go to law school, but YOU are. What&apos;s YOUR excuse for being a $7 an hour drudge worker?

 we&apos;ve halved the calories and fat in this cheeseburger.


Ingredients


1 medium portion potato(es),(use 2 potatoes)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
175 g extra-lean beef mince
1 small onion(s), red, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
2 tablespoon parsley, flat-leaf, finely chopped
3 tablespoon dried breadcrumbs
1 portion egg white, beaten lightly
2 medium burger bun, wholemeal
4 small leaf lettuce
1 medium tomato(s), sliced
20 g half-fat cheddar cheese, grated

Cut potatoes into wedges; boil, steam or microwave until tender. Place wedges, skin side down, on prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with combined pepper and salt. Bake until lightly browned and crispy, about 30 minutes.

The potato part says to BOIL STEAM OR MICROWAVE... NOT FRY!!!(as this was already pointed out to you peebrain!!)




Burger:

Combine beef, onion, garlic, parsley, breadcrumbs and egg white in a small bowl; shape into 2 patties.


Cook patties in a nonstick pan over medium heat, turning once, until browned and cooked through. Top each patty with 1 tablespoon cheese, place on baking sheet and bake in already heated oven until cheese is melted.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!! She would&apos;ve TOLD the cook to cook some fries before taking out the sand!!!!!!!!!! More proof of her ignorance! Anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant*********KNOWS********you never TELL a cook anything! First of all as been explained over and over and over again.... There is an expo. Fryside in Crapplehell is no joke. You would have to ring it in the pos first. Then politely... concept beyond lords... ask the expo to get them for you on the fly.(Because some crazy fool can&apos;t read the menu and is being a pain!)THEN.. if fryside has some extra fries they will toss them on a plate that goes to the expo. Period. You do not TELL a cook anything. You can&apos;t do our job. Yet you try to tell us how.
Just for the humans... picture lords telling a cook during rush how to do thier job!!!!!!!!! She&apos;ll have a real experience of MEAN, UNCARING, AND RUDE! Gotta love the boh!

 &quot;It&apos;s funny how you can&apos;t respond to the TRUTH that SOME people are NOT ORDERING THE SANDWICH because they are*NOT*concerned with&quot;POINTS&quot;and CALORIES. Some people just want a sandwich with NO BACON. Some people may be allergic. WHY CAN&apos;T YOU ADMIT THIS THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD***NOT***be CONCERNED WITH&quot;POINTS?&quot;YOU KNOW IT&apos;S THE GOD&apos;S TRUTH! YOU ARE AN IDIOT! SO WHY CAN&apos;T YOU ADMIT THIS? ARE YOU SCARED I&apos;M PROVING YOU 100% WRONG THAT*SOME*PEOPLE DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THE POINTS THAT ORDER THIS SANDWICH, SO YOUR ARGUMENT TO ME IS IRRELEVANT, WHICH THAT&apos;S WHY YOU CAN&apos;T RESPOND, BECAUSE I&apos;VE MADE VERY, VERY,*VALID*POSSIBLITES. I bet you can&apos;t admit that I may have made your argument about&quot;points&quot;look STUPID?&quot;

Are you quite done with the infantile name-calling? Of course I know that people that don&apos;t count points order the Tango Chicken Sandwich. I&apos;ve dined with people who have ordered the sandwich and aren&apos;t on Weight Watchers and don&apos;t count points. Don&apos;t make assumptions about what I am saying.

You seem to miss the entire point of the Weight Watchers section of the Applebee&apos;s menu. It is targeted towards people who are looking for a healthier alternative to the traditional trash that Applebee&apos;s serves. Weight Watchers at Applebee&apos;s is the same kind of gimmick that the Atkins menu is at Friday&apos;s and the Guiltless Grill crap is at Chili&apos;s. They are healthier alternatives to the other unhealthy, fat-laden food that is on their menus. Does someone need to be a card-carrying member of Weight Watchers to order off the Weight Watchers menu at Applebee&apos;s? No. Of course not. Why you or anyone else orders from these menus is completely irrelevant. The menu items are there to provide a healthier alternative. Get it?

As can be expected, you&apos;re once again proving that you are consistent in your ignorance.

 All name calling and interpretations of the menu aside. If I really wanted fries, I would aske the server politely if it came with fries. If per chance my sandwich did not I would pleasantly ask the server if I could substitute fires. I bet that would go a long way. Lordsie poo just might get her ever loved fries at no additional charge with no temper tantrum and scrutinizing of the menu. I am really going out on a limb here try being nice to people, usually if they can do it for you they will. That&apos;s a new concept.
Further more I would assume that fries did not come with items on the weight watcher menu. I mean really, grab hold of yer pea sized brain and squeeze for just one second. Maybe just maybe some common sense might leak out.
BTW Yes I can read and no I did not click onto your links to crapplebees menu. Because I used my good judgement and I dont have to read the menu to gather that Weight Watcher Sandwiches are not served with french fries or anything else fried. I bet also they are not served with mayo or ranch dressing either. Now I have offered an opinion. Formerly Jammie

&quot;Of course it is served with&quot;fries&quot;....they are baked fries...ok BAKED not fried...a meal that is made to keep or loose weight cannot have fries fries. it is too fattening and it beats the whole purpose. so no i am NOT the IDIOT, YOU ARE THE MORON...again COMMON SENSE.&quot;

I mentioned in one of the other post that those fries were baked. CAN YOU READ?&quot;Sure, they are baked, which is a healthier way of making fries, but my point is, I am NOT WRONG FOR THINKING THAT I WOULD BE DELIVERED FRIES WITH MY MEAL.&quot;

I MENTIONED THIS ALREADY. It&apos;s still includes&quot;FRIES&quot;NO MATTER*WHAT WAY*THEY ARE MADE IS THE POINT! FRIES ARE FRIES NO MATTER WHAT!

teleburst
&quot;They might*call*them fries, but they aren&apos;t the kind of fries that you get at Applebees.&quot;

SO, they are still&quot;FRIES&quot;aren&apos;t they? YES, THEY ARE!

&quot;Well, that&apos;s because you&apos;re not bright enough to understand the written word.&quot;

Uh, that&apos;s YOU, because the written WORDS have&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;and it doesn&apos;t have ANYTHING about sections or exclusions to these sandwiches. SO YOU CAN&apos;T READ THE*EXACT*WORDING FOR WHAT IT IS.

&quot;AND the Tango Chicken Sandwich is pictured exactly as it is supposed to come, with exactly what&apos;s described in the description.&quot;

Haven&apos;t you EVER saw an advertisement for something such as&quot;chips&quot;such as Doritos and it didn&apos;t picture*EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR?&quot;It&apos;s the SAME THING with this. Does that mean that cool ranch doritos isn&apos;t $2.00 a 13oz bag just because it&apos;s NOT*PICTURED?*OF COURSE NOT. ALL OF THE 13oz bags are on sale as always. I KNOW, because I do buy doritos and I KNOW FOR A FACT they may put regular doritos in the picture, but*ALL*the flavors are on sale as well. It&apos;s NOT GOING TO SHOW EVERY SIDE DISH ON THE PICTURE. The menu states it&quot;INCLUDES FRIES&quot;and that is ALL THAT&apos;S NECESSARY TO PROVE THAT. PICTURES DON&apos;T MEAN ANYTHING! It&apos;s in the wording that counts.

&quot;Just order the fries separately.&quot;

I didn&apos;t because the menu had&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;so WHAT IS SOMEONE SUPPOSED TO THINK, THAT IT&apos;S A LIE? I BELIEVED IT. There&apos;s NO NEED TO CONSIDERING THE MENU STATES IT INCLUDES*BOTH*SIDES.

&quot;Well, it was written&quot;****EXACTLY****&quot;on the menu what came on the plate AND there was a photo of the plate. Suddenly&quot;exactly&quot;doesn&apos;t matter?&quot;

The photo DOESN&apos;T matter, it&apos;s what written in*WORDS*that matters. The photo is just that, a photo. Most of those photos aren&apos;t aucurate to what a sandwich actually looks like and you know it.

&quot;You are SO wrong here. The sandwich DOESNT COME WITH FRIES. How many times do you have to be told that?&quot;
IT DOES COME WITH FRIES. THE*MENU*HAS IT WRITTEN THAT IT DOES! HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT? IF THE MENU HAS&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;, THAT&apos;S WHY I BELIEVED IT? DON&apos;T YOU GET THAT? THEY LIED on the menu according to YOU. WHY WOULD A MENU HAVE SOMETHING FALSE ON IT?

&quot;But no, you saw the statement in another section of the menu and were blinded by it. It struck you so blind that you couldn&apos;t see the picture of the plate nor read the description. And that was dumb, because all you had to do was ask a server who couldn&apos;t read your mind to see if you could substitute fries for the fruit salad and see what the house policy was for that.&quot;

NO I SAW THE PICTURE that it included fruit and I also saw the part of the menu that states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES.&quot;THAT IS WHAT MATTERS. THE PICTURE IS IRRELEVANT TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY SAID WORD FOR WORD. THE WORDING OVERRIDES THE PICTURE BECAUSE THE MENU STATES&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;with NO EXCLUSIONS OR&quot;IN THIS SECTION.&quot;

&quot;But don&apos;t blame the server for giving you the exact dish that you were ordered.&quot;

The SERVER is responsible for reading the menu and KNOWING it is supposed to include fries. Do I work there? NO, so WHY THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW THE MENU*BETTER*THAN THEY DO? Doesn&apos;t that sound STUPID OF THEM? YES IT DOES! Do you order a burger that states on the menu it includes fries and bother to say&quot;FRIES?&quot;If you do, most people DON&apos;T, because they go by what the*MENU*STATES.

&quot;Gee, even an 8 year old can look at a picture(in fact, that&apos;s why they put pictures on a menu...for those who don&apos;t even have the intellect of an 8 year old).&quot;

For one thing, an 8yr old only is going by the picture, which is STUPID of ANYONE TO DO. It&apos;s the DESCRIPTION ON THE MENU THAT COUNTS. Do you realize when you look at that picture of the sandwich, it&apos;s not going to look so perfect looking as it does in that picture? You know they photograph plastic ice cubes in drinks to take photos for instance of a soft drink to make it look so PERFECT. WHY WOULD*ANYONE*in their right mind trust a picture over WORDS? Words mean EVERYTHING. THE PICTURE MEANS NOTHING.

&quot;What&apos;s YOUR excuse for being a $7 an hour drudge worker?&quot;

I make more than that.

tipqueen
&quot;It seems to ONLY talk about the BURGER, the fries are just a photo additive!!! Being that most people eat fries with burgers.... if you can READ... it only states info on/about the BURGER, excpet in the title... you idiot!&quot;

&quot;Cheeseburger with Fries&quot;

If it states&quot;WITH FRIES&quot;, then it can be served WITH FRIES for a WeightWatcher&apos;s entree, IDIOT! It&apos;s in BIG LETTERS EVEN. You&apos;re the one that can&apos;t read.

&quot;The potato part says to BOIL STEAM OR MICROWAVE... NOT FRY!!!(as this was already pointed out to you peebrain!!)&quot;

FRIES ARE STILL*FRIES*NO MATTER WHAT. PLUS, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT APPLEBEE&apos;S WON&apos;T MAKE BAKED FRIES FOR THIS ENTREE, HUH? YOU DON&apos;T KNOW.

coorslite
&quot;True I did have several people request to have fries substituted for the fruit that the menu clearly stated it came with. Simple request from people that can read.&quot;

You were supposed to INCLUDE BOTH unless they stated they didn&apos;t want the fruit, meaning you should have told them it came with both, because it DOES. IT COMES WITH BOTH SIDES: FRUIT AND FRIES.

&quot;You never TELL a cook anything!&quot;

For one thing, I can tell a cook*WHAT THE HELL I WANT TO*!

 http://www.mtsusidelines.com/media/paper202/news/2003/10/01/Opinions/Tips-Are.Ea rned.Rewards.Not.An.Ordained.Right-508957.shtml?norewrite&amp;sourcedomain=www.mtsus idelines.com 

Never, ever take food out that is incorrectly done(I had a waitress rip me a new one for something I goofed up on as a cook and she demanded I fix it then and there - and she was right and I learned).&quot;

This waitress did and look what happened? A GOOD THING. The customers DIDN&apos;T receive their food wrong. THAT IS VERY CARING OF THAT WAITRESS AS WELL AS EXTREMLEY SMART!

I CAN TELL THE COOK WHAT THE HELL I PLEASE!

merriteri
Of course I know that people that don&apos;t count points order the Tango Chicken Sandwich. I&apos;ve dined with people who have ordered the sandwich and aren&apos;t on Weight Watchers and don&apos;t count points.

Then WHY say this then? As someone who is on Weight Watchers, I can tell you, Lords, for a fact that there is no possible way that the Tango Chicken Sandwich entree that appears on the Applebee&apos;s menu can have 7 points if there are fries included.

If you are saying Of course theres SOME people that dont count points&quot;, then*WHY*are you making an ISSUE over the points, because points dont matter in this argument, which you just admitted that SOME people dont count the points? You are CONTRADICTING your own argument here. Mentioning points, but then agreeing with me about that some people wouldnt pay attention to those points. You DONT make*ANY*sense. WHY BOTHER MENTIONING POINTS IF ITS IRRELEVANT TO THE ARGUMENT?

Why you or anyone else orders from these menus is completely irrelevant.

Well then WHY would someone that orders an item from the WeightWatchers sandwich that isnt weight conscious is going to count POINTS? Do you understand that you mentioning POINTS is IRRELEVANT to the argument considering***SOME PEOPLE***dont give a crap about the damn points? WHY MENTION POINTS in this argument?

As can be expected, you&apos;re once again proving that you are consistent in your ignorance.

Thats you when you talk about POINTS that is supposed to indicate according to*YOU*that it doesnt include fries, when NOW you are looking like a FOOL to be AGREEING with me that SOME PEOPLE DONT COUNT POINTS. QUIT MENTIONING POINTS, BECAUSE POINTS HAVE ABSOLUTELY*NOTHING*TO DO WITH ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES. If some people dont count points, then WHY THE HECK WOULD THEY NOTICE&quot;POINTS&quot;, IDIOT?

As far as you saying this: Are you quite done with the infantile name-calling, well look at what YOU said in your ignorance, so your name-calling also HYPOCRITE!

&quot;I bet also they are not served with ranch dressing either.&quot;

It DOES: BARBECUE RANCH SAUCE
 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 

You&apos;re WRONG about that one.

&quot;If I really wanted fries, I would aske the server politely if it came with fries.&quot;

If you know the menu states it comes with something(ANYTHING AT ALL), do you bother to*ASK*EVERYTIME? Like if a steak entree states it comes with mashed potatoes, do you ask&quot;DOES IT COME WITH MASHED POTATOES?&quot;I am willing to be you don&apos;t ALL THE TIME? AM I right? Be HONEST here. If you do, that&apos;s rare, because most people don&apos;t say something if it&apos;s listed that it comes with a certain item unless they either want to substitute it or want it a certain way like no salt on fries or maybe don&apos;t want the particular item at all. My husband doesn&apos;t say&quot;Chicken ranch sandwich&quot;when he has ordered that already and said&quot;Fries&quot;, because the menu states that already that it*COMES*with fries. WHY BOTHER MENTIONING SOMETHING LISTED ON THE MENU ALREADY? WHY WASTE THE CUSTOMER&apos;S TIME AND THE SERVER&apos;S TIME AS WELL OVER STUPID QUESTIONS?

 Lords,

You crack me up! Your ignorance is hysterical. The name calling is great too. Especially since you only have two : idiot and moron.

Good news this year. Only one more storm expected to come by. Expected to be only a tropical storm.No more hurricanes!

 &quot;FRIES ARE STILL*FRIES*NO MATTER WHAT. PLUS, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT APPLEBEE&apos;S WON&apos;T MAKE BAKED FRIES FOR THIS ENTREE, HUH? YOU DON&apos;T KNOW.&quot;

Straight from Merriam-Webster&apos;s dictionary:
Main Entry: 1french fry
Function: noun
Usage: often capitalized 1st F
: a strip of potato fried in deep fat -- usually used in plural

Did that say baked anywhere in there, Loads?

Oh, and if you were to go into Crapplebee&apos;s and ask them to bake some&apos;fries&apos;for you, you&apos;d get laughed right out of the place.

Go away and die already.

 Restaurants need to start playing the same game with lords.

LORDS:&quot;The coupon says you get fries free with the sandwhich, I want my second order of free fries with it&quot;

MANAGER:&quot;But it already comes with fries... I don&apos;t understand?&quot;

LORDS:&quot;I want my free stuff, I want my free fries, the coupon says I get free fries with any sandwhich, no exlusions, I don&apos;t understand common sense and look for any way around common sense to get free stuff, I know the coupon actually means that the sandwhiches that don&apos;t already have fries, you get a free order, but since it can be misinterpreted to fit my agenda, I want free stuff, you need to either lower the price of the sandwhich to compensate me for the difference of the fries, or I want another order for my fat mother&quot;

MANAGER:&quot;Oh, I see, well, our menu doesn&apos;t state that we charge you for the fries when you get the po-boy sandwhich, so they are already free fries, we decided to give them free with certain sandwhiches already, so you already have your free fries on your plate, you only paid for the sandwhich&quot;

LORDS:&quot;But it says it comes with fries, I interpret that as part of the price&quot;

MANAGER:&quot;Nope, it does say it comes with fries, but those are free fries, you already got your free fries, if you don&apos;t stop your disruption, I&apos;ll have to kick you out with no refund.&quot;

Hell, applebees could probably figure out a loophole to get around her sandwhiches all have fries scam. And yes, Lords, it&apos;s a SCAM you are pulling. You see, 99.9% of people KNOW that it means the sandwhiches on that specific page, it doesn&apos;t have to actually say&quot;ONLY ON THIS PAGE.&quot;But there is that one in a million, or, YOU, that reads every word, and tries to figure out a way to get free crap... either that, or you are too STUPID to actually understand a menu that 99.9% of other people have no issue with.

 BBQ Ranch sauce is not ranch dressing its an ingreediant in a sauce. The fat and calorie content of ranch dressing is dramatically reduced by the addition of BBQ sauce.
If the statement were not on the same page of the menu that I ordered the item from, yes i would ask. Then there is the fact you are ordering a healthful choice, so I would seriously doubt french fries came with it. Again lords common sense. Besides if I really needed those fries I would definitely ask. ARHG!!!!!!!!!! I just cant wait till you artery&apos;s slam shut. Formerly Jammie

&quot;They might*call*them fries, but they aren&apos;t the kind of fries that you get at Applebees.&quot;

SO, they are still&quot;FRIES&quot;aren&apos;t they? YES, THEY ARE&quot;!

Are they Applebee&apos;s fries? NO, THEY&apos;RE NOT!

You lose.

Again.

&quot;Haven&apos;t you EVER saw(sic)an advertisement for something such as&quot;chips&quot;such as Doritos and it didn&apos;t picture*EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR?&quot;It&apos;s the SAME THING with this. Does that mean that cool ranch doritos isn&apos;t $2.00 a 13oz bag just because it&apos;s NOT*PICTURED?*OF COURSE NOT. ALL OF THE 13oz bags are on sale as always&quot;.

Untrue. I&apos;ve seen only certain flavors of chips on sale before.

So, you lose.

Again.

Plus, comparing an advertisement to a menu is pretty bogus. One has nothing to do with the other.

So, you lose.

Again.

&quot;The SERVER is responsible for reading the menu and KNOWING it is supposed to include fries. Do I work there? NO,

Exactly.

&quot;so WHY THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW THE MENU*BETTER*THAN THEY DO?

Because you don&apos;t. Tell you what - why don&apos;t you write the Applebee&apos;s corporate office and ask them if fries are supposed to automatically come with any of the Weight Watcher&apos;s dishes. Go on, I dare you.

&quot;For one thing, an 8yr old only is going by the picture, which is STUPID of ANYONE TO DO. It&apos;s the DESCRIPTION ON THE MENU THAT COUNTS&quot;.

Exactly. And the&quot;description&quot;of the dish says NOTHING about fries.

&quot;&quot;What&apos;s YOUR excuse for being a $7 an hour drudge worker?&quot;

I make more than that&quot;.

I&apos;m sorry. $7.50.

 You know lords you didnt want to spend the seconds requesting the beloved french fries. We all know how valuable seconds are to you, since you have made that abundantly clear on numerous occasions. However, you will spend hours on this site defending you actions, researching links to crapplebees menu, complaining about the stupid lazy server. This is exactly what makes you appear to be such a buffoon. Wouldn&apos;t it have just been easier to ask for fries instead of the hysteria afterwards? I know you didnt think you shouldn&apos;t have to. Obviously they are real important to you. You have placed much emphasis on fried potatoes. This is called being a grown up and being responsible for meeting all of your needs. For most fries are not a need, for you they seem to be. Formerly Jammie

&quot;Lords, it&apos;s a SCAM you are pulling.&quot;

LOOK IN THE F**MIRROR:&quot;I purposely don&apos;t ring in soft drinks from time to time for certain people.&quot;

I AM*NOT*&quot;SCAMMING&quot;ANYONE, THAT&apos;S YOU AND YOU&apos;VE PROVED IT. YOU ARE SCAMMING THE RESTAURANT YOU THIEF! You should go to jail for that. STEALING FROM A RESTAURANT IS A CRIME!

&quot;I know the coupon actually means that the sandwhiches that don&apos;t already have fries, you get a free order.&quot;

NOT if the coupon doesn&apos;t state that. If MANAGERS are LITERAL about their wording such as&quot;ENTREE&quot;vs.&quot;APPETIZER&quot;, SO CAN CUSTOMERS. It&apos;s ONLY FAIR you know. They go to the*EXACT*WORDING SO CAN CUSTOMERS. WHY NOT CUSTOMERS?

&quot;Our menu doesn&apos;t state that we charge you for the fries when you get the po-boy sandwhich&quot;

Actually, it DOES when the sandwich states it comes with fries already and the price listed by it. YOU&apos;RE 100% WRONG! THE FRIES AREN&apos;T&quot;FREE&quot;THAT ARE SERVED WITH THE seafood po-boy, IDIOT! The extra set of fries ARE the ones that are FREE according to the coupon. See, that restaurant didn&apos;t cover their butts. They should have had some exclusions if they didn&apos;t want the seafood po-boys to have the extra set of fries or not put*ANY*sandwich without exclusions on the coupon. The owner that wrote this coupon was AN IDIOT!

&quot;We decided to give them free with certain sandwhiches already, so you already have your free fries on your plate, you only paid for the sandwich.&quot;

If that&apos;s true, the manager would*OWE*me money on the po-boy then if I get the fries that normally come with the po-boy for free, because the coupon states I get an extra set for free, so if I pay full price for the sandwich that includes a set of fries already, I*AM*paying for those fries if I don&apos;t receive an extra set. GET THIS? Like if the price is $4.99. Let&apos;s say I use the coupon. So according to you, I shouldn&apos;t get the second set that the coupon states. Well, since I wouldn&apos;t be according to you, they&apos;d have to give me*SOMETHING*then in the place of the item considering I did*EXACTLY*what the coupon stated to do, which is buy*ANY*sandwich in order to receive a small drink and small fry, free. I am supposed to have 2 fries according to the coupon and menu combined, plain and simple. Blame the owner that wrote the coupon, NOT the customer.

&quot;MANAGER:&quot;Nope, it does say it comes with fries, but those are free fries, you already got your free fries, if you don&apos;t stop your disruption, I&apos;ll have to kick you out with no refund.&quot;

THAT DIDN&apos;T HAPPEN. They gave us the free fries as the coupon states. You are a DUMBASS. They had to give it free if they wanted our business, because it would be false advertising then. You don&apos;t seem to understand that when you purchase an item that comes with a side dish, YOU**********ARE**************PAYING FOR THAT SIDE DISH! IT&apos;S************NOT*************FREE!

&quot;Hell, applebees could probably figure out a loophole to get around her sandwhiches all have fries scam.&quot;

It&apos;s*NOT*a scam. WHY WOULD I WAIT TO HAVE MY FOOD NOT DELIVERED TO ME CORRECTLY? I saw the menu stated&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;and I didn&apos;t see any exclusions about the sandwiches, so I didn&apos;t ask the server, plain and simple. I DIDN&apos;T DO THIS PURPOSELY SO I COULD HAVE MY OUTING RUINED YOU IDIOT! The STUPID WAITRESS AND FOOD RUNNER CAN&apos;T READ THE MENU FOR WHAT IT STATES. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE STUPID.

&quot;It doesn&apos;t have to actually say&quot;ONLY ON THIS PAGE.&quot;

It should say like other menus I&apos;ve seen things like&quot;All sandwiches within this section&quot;or&quot;The above entrees include fries.&quot;Also, if they don&apos;t have those type of things, then they should have an exclusion to the tango chicken sandwich since it is called a&quot;SANDWICH&quot;in the TITLE of the item. Even regularguy would have thought it would have came with fries, which it SHOULD as well as fruit. THE MENU STATES IT.

bistroy
&quot;Did that say baked anywhere in there, Loads?&quot;

It DOESN&apos;T HAVE TO SAY&quot;BAKED&quot;, because the word&quot;FRIES&quot;is on the page of the WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S RECIPE. DON&apos;T YOU SEE THAT?

 http://www.weightwatchers.co.uk/food/rcp/index.aspx?recipeid=7015352 

Just look at the word&quot;FRIES&quot;on the site in BIG LETTERS. You are a dumbass.

 I don&apos;t know if you actually read the dictionary definition that I gave you there, but you didn&apos;t seem to include it in the quote that you put up there for me, but it did say something about cooking in fat. I don&apos;t give a rat&apos;s ass what&apos;Weight watchers&apos;calls fries, but they&apos;re not fries, plain and simple. You see where I&apos;m going with this, Loads??

&quot;I AM*NOT*&quot;SCAMMING&quot;ANYONE, THAT&apos;S YOU AND YOU&apos;VE PROVED IT. YOU ARE SCAMMING THE RESTAURANT YOU THIEF! You should go to jail for that. STEALING FROM A RESTAURANT IS A CRIME!&quot;

Good luck wasting the tax-payer&apos;s money with such a heinous crime, sending people like this to jail over what really costs about a quarter, at most.

Loads, I&apos;m seriously about to alert every Applebee&apos;s, Chili&apos;s, and other crap restaurant near where you live, just to let them know not to&quot;pay&quot;you for coming back to them for the scams that you are pulling. Don&apos;t think that I don&apos;t have the connections or the brain-power to pull something like this. Soon, you&apos;ll be recognized as soon as you walk in the door. I don&apos;t think that it would be hard to point out the person that gets extra ranch, bbq sauce, ketchup, mayo and every other condiment every time that they frequent the place, other than the fact that you have a gift card or coupon for every single little visit. I might could just tell them what you&apos;re going to order, based on the crap that you spew on here.

Good luck getting anything else from any corporate place. Looks like you might have to move your free trailer to another city before long, huh?

 So, which of these Applebee&apos;s should I alert first:

1000 W. Esplande Ave
1220 S. Clearview Pkwy
3701 Veterans Memorial Blvd or
4005 General Degaulle Dr.?

How about Chili&apos;s in the area:

4201 Veterans Blvd or
1741 Manhattan Blvd


Methinks that there&apos;s a similarity in a couple of the addresses, and can figure out which one you frequent mostly.

I&apos;ve got my finger on the red button. Don&apos;t push me.

 weight watchers calls them fries to make it seem as the&quot;real thing&quot;. once you read the freaking recepie you see that these are not fries. so stop trying to prove soemthing that is just ridiculously not possible. of course someone that drowns its food in ranch and bbq and eats only in corporate places(where the food is not healthy at all)would not know the LOGIC in the weight watchers menu.

again you are a class a moron. i can picture you all smart a**posting the site of the recipe without reading it, and then bam. you retarded f***tard....read before trying to prove everybody wrong, when in the end you are the moron.

ps. don&apos;t waste the whole day trying to find something else to post to back up your stupidity

&quot;Untrue. I&apos;ve seen only certain flavors of chips on sale before.

Again.&quot;

IT IS TRUE. LOOK AT THE PRICES AT WAL-MART. The price is the SAME PRICE for*ANY*of the flavors. Spicy Doritos SAME PRICE for 13oz bag, regular Doritos, SAME PRICE 13 oz bag. You are just making up this, because I can*PROVE*it. I can*SCAN*one of the ads to show you. Just like different colors of Ivory or Dove. 2-pack of white Dove is the*SAME*PRICE AS 2-pack of pink Dove. IT&apos;S TRUE!

YOU LOSE. AGAIN!

&quot;Plus, comparing an advertisement to a menu is pretty bogus. One has nothing to do with the other.&quot;

YES IT DOES. When you have a price on a menu, THAT&apos;S A*TYPE*OF*ADVERTISMENT.*YOU ARE DISPLAYING A PRICE THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT. It is the same in that a*PICTURE*is MEANINGLESS to the avertisement. An example would be a store that use to have here called&quot;Albertson&apos;s&quot;had on their ad&quot;Coke, Dr. Pepper, and Sprite&quot;for $1.99. I went to that store and you know what? ALL COKE PRODUCTS WERE ON SALE. They only had pictured those I just listed above. YOU LOSE AGAIN!

&quot;Tell you what - why don&apos;t you write the Applebee&apos;s corporate office and ask them if fries are supposed to automatically come with any of the Weight Watcher&apos;s dishes. Go on, I dare you.&quot;

I DON&apos;T HAVE TO ASK WHAT I ALREADY KNOW. I KNOW HOW TO*READ*THE***EXACT***WORDING.&quot;ALL SANDWICHES MEANS*ALL*SANDWICHES considering there are NO EXCLUSIONS for*SANDWICHES*.

&quot;And the&quot;description&quot;of the dish says NOTHING about fries.&quot;

The description on the*MENU*itself****DOES****!

&quot;I&apos;m sorry. $7.50.&quot;

&quot;I know you didnt think you shouldn&apos;t have to.&quot;

bistroy
&quot;Sending people like this to jail over what really costs about a quarter, at most.&quot;

NO, a soft drink is usually around $1.99. You don&apos;t know what the hell you are talking about. It DOESN&apos;T MATTER WHAT THE RESTAURANT OWNER PAYS FOR IT, IT MATTERS THAT YOU VITALRYAN DID NOT RING UP AN ITEM, WHICH IS THEFT! Go ahead and take a pack of gum out of a store WITHOUT PAYING and see if you don&apos;t go to JAIL, IDIOT!

&quot;Loads, I&apos;m seriously about to alert every Applebee&apos;s, Chili&apos;s, and other crap restaurant near where you live, just to let them know not to&quot;pay&quot;you for coming back to them for the scams that you are pulling.&quot;

I AM*NOT*pulling ANY SCAMS. Also, I pay for my meals 99% of the time unless they send me something for free due to the bad service. I AM NOT PULLING SCAMS. The coupon situation with the po-boy was in 1997 at a place called&quot;Khaki Kabana&quot;that DOESN&apos;T EXIST ANYMORE in Hammond, LA, when I went to SLU back then. It was from walking distance from the campus. They had a coupon book they&apos;d give to students on campus and it had that coupon in it. Obviously they went out of business due to there BAD coupon writing. They are STUPID.

&quot;I don&apos;t think that it would be hard to point out the person that gets extra ranch, bbq sauce, ketchup, mayo and every other condiment every time that they frequent the place, other than the fact that you have a gift card or coupon for every single little visit. I might could just tell them what you&apos;re going to order, based on the crap that you spew on here.&quot;

Do it, if you want, I DON&apos;T GIVE A DAMN. If you find out what I look like, you&apos;ll be VERY SUPRISED TO SEE that I&apos;m*NOT*fat like you think I am that you keep calling me&quot;LOADS.&quot;If you find out, SO WHAT. I could CARE LESS.

penelopmarie
&quot;Once you read the freaking recepie you see that these are not fries.&quot;

They call them*FRIES*, so they*ARE*FRIES according to WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S that is.

Lords,
Not all fries are fries. Come on. French Fries are short for french fried potatoes. If there is no frying involved it&apos;s not a fry. Weight Watchers can call it whatever they want. Doesn&apos;t make it a french fry. Just like how you call yourself smart. Doesn&apos;t make it true.

 again*YOU*F***TARD...

fries comes from the fact that they are fried in oil or any type of grease...people love to eat fries, but if you are on a diet you really can&apos;t consume*FRIED FRIES*you can consume*BAKED*potato wedges that we like to name fries...it makes us think we are eating the&quot;real&quot;thing.

no*FRIES*ARE NOT*FRIES, and no that&apos;s not that...

of course i don&apos;t expect someone that devours extra greasy food in a weekly basis to know the difference between good fries and bad fries.

GET A LIFE....GET HELP...you are going to end up killing yourself over chilis&apos;ranch and applebees, and outback...and all that other crap you like to consume.

Well, since it&apos;s a&quot;WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S ITEM&quot;, to them it is called&quot;FRIES.&quot;Applebee&apos;s wouldn&apos;t have it on the menu if they didn&apos;t want*****EVERY*****SINGLE SANDWICH TO INCLUDE THEM. They would not have&quot;SANDWICHES&quot;at the top of the page to be included in&quot;SANDWICHES&quot;if it wasn&apos;t included it with ALL THE SANDWICHES now would they? NO, they wouldn&apos;t.

penelopmarie
&quot;of course i don&apos;t expect someone that devours extra greasy food in a weekly basis to know the difference between good fries and bad fries.&quot;

Ah Huh, you*ADMIT*THEY*ARE FRIES. You are CONTRADICTING YOURSELF HERE I SEE. Saying this:&quot;no*FRIES*ARE NOT*FRIES, and no that&apos;s not that&quot;and then saying that:&quot;to know the difference between good fries and bad fries.&quot;See, you are calling them************FRIES***********, isn&apos;t that something?

teleburst
&quot;Sure it does. You will never find the kind of fries that Applebee&apos;s offers as part of ANY Weitht Watcher&apos;s meal.
You lose.
Again.&quot;

FRIES ARE STILL*FRIES*NO MATTER*HOW*THEY ARE COOKED!

YOU LOSE AGAIN!

&quot;Besides, it has nothing to do with a printed menu anyway.&quot;

YES IT DOES! When a menu states $9.99, that is the*ADVERTISED*PRICE in the restaurant. They*CAN&apos;T*bill you $10.99 if you don&apos;t add anything extra to it.

If the menu states&quot;All entrees below come with a side dish&quot;, well you can&apos;t just say one of them doesn&apos;t, because it&apos;s a*LIE*if you do unless it states&quot;EXCEPT such-n-such entree.&quot;Applebee&apos;s DIDN&apos;T COVER THEIR BUTTS ABOUT HAVING FRIES WITH*EVERY*SINGLE SOLITARY SANDWICH! The menu states&quot;ALL&quot;so there&apos;s no argument with it considering they don&apos;t have*ANY EXCEPTIONS TO ANY OF THE SANDWICHES like they do with the rollups.

&quot;That&apos;s not a description of the dish.&quot;

It&apos;s a description of a******************SANDWICH*********
with NO EXCEPTIONS OR EXCLUSIONS to*ANY*of the sandwiches. So, YES, it&apos;s a description of the dish, because it&apos;s a*SANDWICH*and that&apos;s all that matters, because there are NO EXCEPTIONS to*****ANY*****of the sandwiches on the menu, NONE!

&quot;I&apos;m sorry. $7.75&quot;

I make MORE THAN THAT!

I forgot to respond to this sentence:&quot;Looks like you might have to move your free trailer to another city before long, huh?&quot;

We have a brick house. We also didn&apos;t get a fema trailer or any other type of trailer. I bet you live in a trailer and you&apos;re just JEALOUS.

 um thanks for taking my words out of context and spinning them the way your little pea sized brain wants. i know what i said. i said bad fries(the ones fried)and good fries(baked)so that the most idiotic person*ahem YOU*could understand what i meant. obviously you didn&apos;t, because you are just stupid. i never thought i&apos;d meet someone with such lack of common sense. it is great to see though that you base your life on casual dinning crappy food and what you can get for fee...*sarcasticly*WOW no wonder you are so happy.

all this research only to try and prove that the stupid sandwich comes with fries, and to get them without paying. i can picture you throwing a tantrum and the managers and employees laughing their heads off cause i mean it is kind of OBVIOUS. and of course a fat ass like you would want the fries with extra extra ranch..eeeewwwwww!!!!

what about the restaurant that has an atkins menu. what if in one part of the menu(the normal one)it said all steaks come with side of potato. then you have 2 steak dishes IN THE ATKINS AREA OF THE MENU that come with veggies. who in the right mind will argue when everybody knows that in the atkins plan you DO NOT eat carbs.

If the*MENU*STATES IT, it would come with the side of potato. The written words are what you go by on the menu. If the menu has it, it includes the potato, plain and simple.

&quot;Then you have 2 steak dishes IN THE ATKINS AREA OF THE MENU that come with veggies.&quot;

 http://plantanswers.tamu.edu/vegetables/potato.html 

I didn&apos;t even have to look this site up to know that a*POTATO*is a*****VEGETABLE*****YOU IDIOT! It&apos;s STILL A VEGETABLE!

&quot;Of course a fat ass like you would want the fries with extra extra ranch..eeeewwwwww!&quot;

Again, I&apos;m*NOT*FAT. I&apos;m actually UNDERWEIGHT. I weighed 91 and half pounds this morning. HOW can you call a 5&apos;0&quot;woman that weighs only that to be&quot;fat?&quot;I bet your the fat ass and are just JEALOUS.

 bbq ranch sauce made at applebee&apos;s is fat free ranch with thier bbq sauce added to it. Applebee&apos;s also serves lowfat ranch out of a gallon plastic jug. YUMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!! Now I didn&apos;t have to research anal websites to find that information out. I worked at Applebees. I like many here work in restaurants, have worked in restaurants and have knowledge that comes with life. Imagine that! Have a great day everyone! Well not you loads. Nothing makes you happy.

 Did I mention anywhere that you lived in a FEMA trailer?

I&apos;d go with the phrase that when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me, but in your case, you&apos;re just making an ass out of yourself.

Fries are fried, in fat. A potato that is not fried in fat cannot be literally called a fry, but they can still call it a fry.

Just like we can call you fat. You say that you are not fat, but we can still call you that.

 I thought the term fries is from the&apos;cut&apos;of the potatoes. Potato cut into strips of any size can be called fries.

Now the cooking method of the fries can be; Fried, Baked, Broiled, or Grilled.

Lords is probably on the ground in a fetal position from all of my intelligent information, so I&apos;ll stop here.

They wouldn&apos;t have put it INSIDE the&quot;Sandwiches&quot;section if they had wanted fries to apply to the Weight Watcher&apos;s section either. They would have actually put it at the top of the page outside of the section, or at the beginning of the menu, or repeated it in the Weight Watcher&apos;s section. It&apos;s only common sense. Oh wait, no wonder you don&apos;t understand...

PS, did you write Applebee&apos;s to find out whether fries automatically comes with the Tango Chicken Sandwich? Of course you didn&apos;t. :cue Jack Nicholson voice:&quot;You can&apos;t handle the truth&quot;!

&quot;&quot;Besides, it has nothing to do with a printed menu anyway.&quot;

YES IT DOES! When a menu states $9.99, that is the*ADVERTISED*PRICE in the restaurant&quot;.

No it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s the actual price in the restaurant. Are you saying that if Applebee&apos;s runs a coupon, that the coupon isn&apos;t good because the menu is the&quot;advertised price&quot;of the item? Oh dear, guess you&apos;re out of luck with those buy one ontree get one free coupons...

When I first read this post I thought that it was somebody mocking lords for sure. Then I realized that yes, lords posted it and it really is that stupid. Man I wish we had an Atkin&apos;s menu where I work and somebody tried to tell me that a baked potato came with it. I would be laughing so hard, probably right in your your face.

 the only time in my life that i weighted 92 pounds was when i was anorexic. it was from when i was 18 until i was 23. i would eat nothing for 5 days and then i would go to the crappy corporate places you go and devour greasy food, including*fried fries*. trust me i am not jealous, and i am not even close to being fat. i actually have a child and look better than most people that haven&apos;t any children(like yourself)and i am healthy.

of course a potato is a vegetable, but it is also a carb, so it is not a vegetable you can eat if you are in the atkins diet. the same way that you can&apos;t eat fries if you are counting points in the weight watchers menu.

again and again you are the ignorant moron. you might have a lot of info on the internet but you are still ignorant, and very ignorant; it is really very sad.

 There is a VERY good reason Loads Of Ranch goes only to these crappy corporate restaurants, she can walk all over em, because they just don&apos;t want complaints, etc... Give her some fries and shut her fat ass up.

Any private restaurant would laugh her ass right out the door. Loads, most people have common sense, and understand something as simple as the fact that WEIGHT WATCHERS wouldn&apos;t have fries, especially since the description on the menu specifically says what it comes with. Hell there is even a picture. I guess&quot;comes with fresh fruit on the side&quot;doesn&apos;t click that it means, yes, it comes with FRESH FRUIT instead of fries. Loads, you should be embarrassed posting this, it makes you look STUPID.

That leaves one of two things, either she is too stupid and really believed it came with fries, or she just saw the opportunity to get free stuff.

Loads go die already, or visit a private restaurant and get your ass handed to you.

 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 0menu%20%20pdf%22

For one thing,&quot;SANDWICHES&quot;are on the page of&quot;TANGO CHICKEN SANDWICH&quot;, it*IS*PART OF THE&quot;SANDWICH&quot;SECTION. They wouldn&apos;t have&quot;SANDWICHES&quot;on*TOP*of the page in*BIG LETTERS*, now would they? NO THEY WOULDN&apos;T.

YOU LOSE AGAIN!

&quot;It&apos;s only common sense.&quot;

NOT to all people that don&apos;t eat WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S it&apos;s NOT. It didn&apos;t occur to me that I wouldn&apos;t get fries delivered with my meal, because the menu*STATES*&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES.&quot;The written words said it all.

&quot;PS, did you write Applebee&apos;s to find out whether fries automatically comes with the Tango Chicken Sandwich? Of course you didn&apos;t.&quot;

No, because I complained about it when I made my complaint about the service last year, which I received $40 for, which was MORE than what we spent and she didn&apos;t charge me for the mountain dew I had either. Also, OBVIOUSLY, because it was such bad service, she didn&apos;t receive a tip. We made approx. $8 from Applebee&apos;s, because we only spent around $32 if I remember correctly.

&quot;Are you saying that if Applebee&apos;s runs a coupon, that the coupon isn&apos;t good because the menu is the&quot;advertised price&quot;of the item?&quot;

The coupon OVERRIDES THE PRICE because the*OWNER*made these coupons, so he or she can lower or higher the prices the*METHOD*they choose to. I was talking about if there*ISN&apos;T*a coupon. If the price on the menu and the description doesn&apos;t match what you get and are charged, that&apos;s false advertising, plain and simple. You CAN&apos;T have on the menu $10.99 and charge for the exact entree $12.99. Now don&apos;t you think that&apos;s a bit IMMORAL of the restaurant as well as*ILLEGAL?*The price is what&apos;s on the menu and that&apos;s that. The description of what you are supposed to receive is on the menu. If you have a coupon, that description OVERRIDES the menu to*SOME*degree, but the menu still states if a sandwich comes with fries and the coupon states it comes with another set of fries, well, they will*HAVE*to give you 2 sets of fries, unless of course they choose not to do business with you, which*ANY*store has a right to refuse someone&apos;s business.

penelopmarie
&quot;The same way that you can&apos;t eat fries if you are counting points in the weight watchers menu.&quot;

As I stated before to merriteri, the*POINTS*are IRRELEVANT to the people that are getting that sandwich(LIKE ME)for reasons such as&quot;DON&apos;T WANT BACON&quot;or&quot;SMALLER SANDWICH&quot;or&quot;Seasoned Chicken.&quot;They might just want the sandwich, but don&apos;t really care at*ALL*about the points, so mentioning points is*TRULY, TRULY, TRULY*IRRELEVANT. Do you honestly think I looked at the points? OF COURSE NOT, because I wanted*NO BACON*and they don&apos;t have a grilled chicken sandwich that doesn&apos;t have bacon, besides the WeightWatcher&apos;s one. Some people DON&apos;T look at the points, don&apos;t you realize that? WHY KEEP MENTIONING THINGS THAT ARE IRRELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION?

&quot;Again and again you are the ignorant moron.&quot;

NO, I*TRUSTED*the****MENU****for*EXACTLY*what it stated, WORD FOR WORD.&quot;ALL SANDWICHES&quot;with NO EXCLUSIONS OR EXCEPTIONS, MEANS****ALL*****that is on the menu. Espcially, because on the top of the page, it states&quot;SANDWICHES&quot;, so what do you expect someone that doesn&apos;t normally order WeightWatcher&apos;s food to think?

vitalryan
&quot;Loads, most people have common sense, and understand something as simple as the fact that WEIGHT WATCHERS wouldn&apos;t have fries, especially since the description on the menu specifically says what it comes with.&quot;

The description of*SANDWICHES*on the menu and the TOP of the page, states it&apos;s*ALL*sandwiches. To think I wouldn&apos;t have gotten fries, would have been*ASSUMING*, when the menu states it&apos;s supposed to come with fruit and FRIES.

&quot;Hell there is even a picture. I guess&quot;comes with fresh fruit on the side&quot;doesn&apos;t click that it means, yes, it comes with FRESH FRUIT instead of fries.&quot;

NO, because the menu stated the*WORDS*&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;with no exceptions to*ANY*of the sandwiches as well as it had the word&quot;SANDWICHES&quot;on top of the page. So the picture is MEANLINESS. How many times have you seen a McDonald&apos;s commercial for a sandwich and when you get that sandwich, it&apos;s WAY SMALLER than what it looks like on the screen? Pictures don&apos;t show EVERYTHING. WORDS MEAN EVERYTHING.

As I stated before, when I buy a bag of Doritos in a store,*ANY*of the flavors are the SAME PRICE, but they only put*ONE*flavor on the picture on the ad, maybe 2 flavors at the most. Same thing with hot pockets. As long as it&apos;s the 9oz pack, any of the flavors of hot pockets are on sale on an ad. Pepperoni is the SAME PRICE as four cheese. They have a lot of flavors. Also, think of&quot;coke&quot;vs.&quot;cherry coke.&quot;The 12 pack cans of&quot;COKE&quot;are $2.25, but you know what, ALL the coke products are. They ONLY*PICTURE*&quot;COKE&quot;and maybe&quot;DIET COKE&quot;, but*ALL*the coke products are still&quot;COKE&quot;and are the SAME PRICE in the store. So the&quot;Cherry coke&quot;is the SAME PRICE as the coke and diet cokes are. You SHOULDN&apos;T*EVER*GO BY*JUST*PICTURES, EVER, is my point.

&quot;That leaves one of two things, either she is too stupid and really believed it came with fries, or she just saw the opportunity to get free stuff.&quot;

Believe me, if I would have known to make sure by saying:&quot;I want fries also with the fruit&quot;, I WOULD HAVE. I DIDN&apos;T KNOW. I DIDN&apos;T DO IT ON PURPOSE. I&apos;d MUCH RATHER pay for everything, than to go through that hell again. That sucked. I just go by the*EXACT WORDING*of the menu. When you order a burger let&apos;s say at a restaurant that states&quot;All burgers come with fries&quot;, do you worry about ordering fries? Most people don&apos;t and that&apos;s what I did, considering the menu stated&quot;ALL SANDWICHES include fries&quot;, it WASN&apos;T NECESSARY TO SAY THE WORD&quot;FRIES.&quot;

It&apos;s just like if someone orders a side of bbq sauce with chicken tenders. If the menu states&quot;comes with honey mustard&quot;, then*BOTH*items should be delivered with no questions asked unless the customer states they don&apos;t want honey mustard. If it comes with the item, it should come with the item, period. The server shouldn&apos;t*ASSUME*the person is substituting the bbq sauce for the honey mustard. If the menu states something includes something, it should unless otherwise stated it&apos;s not wanted by the customer. THE WORDING ON THE MENU IS WHAT YOU GO BY WHEN YOU ORDER THINGS, NOT PICTURES!

 Posted on Friday, October 06, 2006 - 09:12 am:   
 let me see why do i keep mentioning things that are irrelevant tot he conversation....hmmmm, well maybe because points = weight watchers menu and weight watchers menu does not = french fries(too many points). if you didn&apos;t want bacon you could have ordered another sandwich*WITHOUT*the bacon.

see how you post that you got $40 from applebees. again you are just a sad excuse to get free food.*PATHETIC*and*TRASHY*. you even say she didn&apos;t charge you the mountain dew. did you tell her she forgot. oh no no no of course not you don&apos;t play like that, you only are*HONEST*if they overcharge you.

*ALL*of what you post and i mean*ALL*is completely*irrelevant*. i wonder why would they post a picture f a particular sandwich WITH FRUIT and have this complete moron throw a 3 year old tantrum because in her world IT COMES WITH FRIES.

here is some*EXACT WORDING*you can go by 100%: you are a complete and utterly waste of what a human person should be. you are one unhappy person. i honestly think you have a mental disease. no one in their right mind can go on and on and on about the irrelevant bull****that you go on. when you go out to eat you go to relax, have a good time, and enjoy the company of other people. you just go to see what you can get and who you can criticize. i wonder who does or did this in your life for you to be so miserable. get help, grow up, and stop being such and uncaring, annoying, bitter, and disgusting person.

You&apos;ve never heard of borders? Of headers?

I guess that Tilapia is part of the&quot;sandwich&quot;section as well.&lt;snort!&gt;

&quot;We made approx. $8 from Applebee&apos;s&quot;

And there is is. That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about. Getting over. An you complain about restaurants losing money on the 1 out of 10,000 unwanted beverage refils.

&quot;The coupon OVERRIDES THE PRICE because the*OWNER*made these coupons, so he or she can lower or higher the prices the*METHOD*they choose to&quot;.

But you said that the menu price is&quot;the advertised price&quot;. Thanks for proving yourself wrong.

&quot;unless of course they choose not to do business with you, which*ANY*store has a right to refuse someone&apos;s business&quot;.

Not always.

&quot;Do you honestly think I looked at the points? OF COURSE NOT&quot;

And you didn&apos;t read the description or look at the picture either. Just like someone who makes $7.85 an hour because she&apos;s unwilling to anything that is more complex than hiding in an office doing the least amount of work possible.

&quot;Believe me, if I would have known to make sure by saying:&quot;I want fries also with the fruit&quot;, I WOULD HAVE. I DIDN&apos;T KNOW. I DIDN&apos;T DO IT ON PURPOSE. I&apos;d MUCH RATHER pay for everything, than to go through that hell again&quot;.

Oh yes - that was truly hell.&lt;chortle&gt;

Funny thing is - it&apos;s a hell of your own making.

&quot;THE WORDING ON THE MENU IS WHAT YOU GO BY WHEN YOU ORDER THINGS, NOT PICTURES!&quot;

Yes, and the wording had nothing about fries with The Tango Chicken Sandwich. Only fruit salad. Thank you for proving yourself wrong yet again.

 See, the problem with your reason of confusion Lords, is that fact that it makes you look more stupid each time you post.

If you ignore the borders, titles, weightwatcher program and only focus on&quot;All Sandwiches come with fries.&quot;Then yes, your right. All fries would come with every sandwich on the menu.

However, the marketing people at Applebees think they have smart customers who can see that the program of having fries come with burgers, sandwiches, etc are part of a&apos;section&apos;titled the same way and weightwatchers who are watching their weight would assume the sandwich(which is under&apos;Entree&apos;of that portion would know that it comes with fruit by the picture that is supplied.

Man, your stupid.

WRONG! Because then you would&apos;ve been charged for a side of fries. If you had been civil to your server and asked if you could sub them there would&apos;ve been no extra charge. You wanted to be a greedy scamming pig. You don&apos;t want to pay for everything. Especially service!

 I guess I wasn&apos;t the only one who gets that. From Loads last post, she is basically saying,&quot;No, I&apos;m not trying to scam the restaurant&quot;and&quot;yes, I am a complete IDIOT&quot;.

After actually looking at the menu, holy crap, loads, you are a freaking retard.

The Tango Chicken Sandwhich is on a completely different section on the menu, listed under ENTREES, underneath 15 other items that have NOTHING to do with sandwhiches. Clearly in a DIFFERENT section of the menu, but YOU don&apos;t seem to get that, god are you retarded. Guess the big black BORDER and big WEIGHT WATCHERS sign didn&apos;t give you a clue, let alone the NON-SANDWHICH items... Retard.

Lol, I didn&apos;t realize crapplebees prices were so low, god, no wonder you eat there, you poor loser. Get a decent job, lol.. go WAIT TABLES and make some decent money. Then you can go eat at way better restaurants. And then you&apos;ll actually have a clue as to what you are talking about.

 vital i am sorry to disagree with you on this one. i don&apos;t think she will make money serving tables*holds back laughter*can you picture it, she will be arguing with the customers, well no you didn&apos;t order it like that, you ordered it like this*SEE*i wrote it down because it is always better to write everything down. well*YOU*didn&apos;t ask me for a refill, how was i supposed to know that*YOU*wanted a refill if*YOU*didn&apos;t ask me for one.

just imagine if she gets triple sat...remember she has to go in order. she won&apos;t recommend anything, she won&apos;t upsell anything. that would just be hilarious.

 Is it possible that eating a diet consisting of frozen foods, garbage and high fat causes brain damage?

Food for thought.

 Ignorance is bliss..... You know I really meant ignorance is lords. She gives Rainman a bad name. Imagine being that miserable??? Rainman was at least happy in his world! Lords lives in the world of the nutshop where we all owe her. This one time at bandcamp she went to bitter and tipping and they were sooooooo mean and uncaring and only concerned about the money they made. I search the internet and look like a ftard everytime I post. Lord of Rainman how many times have you posted the same anal crap that no one but you cares about? How many times and different ways does it have to be explained to you before you stop spewing 2 minutes for ranch 2 minutes for ranch. Forgot the tartar. Forgot the tartar. Counting pennies counting pennies... Grow the fuc up and be the wonderful kind and caring person you claim to be. Stop scamming restaurants. Apologize to everyone on this board and on bitter for all of your horrible acusations. We are not thieves. We are not mean. You deserve all the abuse you get because you are ill mannered, demandind, closeminded and the meanest evil being I have ever had the misfortune to meet. Get over yourself. The rest of us can agree, disagree and not shout at each other. You however provide a reason to not forgive you because you are never sorry. I can&apos;t speak for the rest of the board but I for one can not understand what kind of pleasure you get out of getting free food. Are your food stamps not enough? I don&apos;t care what kind of service you get anymore. I am sure that the servers at crapplebee&apos;s and the other chains hate you as much as I do. Have you ever walked in to crapplebee&apos;s and a server was HAPPY to see you? Not just the fake smile, but a real smile. I thought not. It is because you are not wanted. Not here... except we get to use you as a punching bag.... and not at any restaurant. Get it? You are the worst customer any server could ever have!


Ahhhhhhh stepping off soap box.... I know I suck but couldn&apos;t help myself.*smiling and cracking another much needed beer!*

&quot;....hmmmm, well maybe because points = weight watchers menu and weight watchers menu does not = french fries(too many points).&quot;

HOW THE HELL WOULD SOMEONE THAT DOESN&apos;T COUNT POINTS, KNOW*HOW MANY*POINTS = WHATEVER AMOUNT? I sure didn&apos;t order it for that reason. THAT IS MY POINT. SOME PEOPLE, just like merriterri stated, don&apos;t order the sandwich because of the&quot;POINTS. They order it, because they want that particular sandwich. WHY WOULD ANYONE THAT ORDERS THAT SANDWICH FOR OTHER REASONS OTHER THAN WEIGHT,*KNOW*OR*CARE*ABOUT POINTS? MOST WOULDN&apos;T unless they were on a health kick. Though if they wanted to eat really healthy, they&apos;d probably get a salad instead.

&quot;If you didn&apos;t want bacon you could have ordered another sandwich*WITHOUT*the bacon.&quot;

 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 0menu%20%20pdf%22

LEARN HOW TO READ THE MENU! Don&apos;t you get it? I would have been*PAYING******MORE*****for the damn bacon that wasn&apos;t wanted, which is*NOT*fair and I DON&apos;T want to be locked into the price with bacon if I can get a cheaper sandwich without bacon. WHY PAY FOR BACON IF YOU DON&apos;T WANT IT? It&apos;s not like they can magically adjust the price just because I don&apos;t want bacon. They AREN&apos;T going to do that. THAT IS THE*ONLY*Grilled Chicken SANDWICH that had&quot;NO BACON&quot;on it. THAT was the MAIN REASON FOR ORDERING IT.

&quot;Again you are just a sad excuse to get free food.&quot;

NO, I PROMISE, I DIDN&apos;T DO THIS INTENTIONALLY. I&apos;d MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, RATHER PAY FOR MY FOOD THAN GO THROUGH THAT CRAP AGAIN. I mentioned that ONLY because to PROVE that they thought I was RIGHT, because WHY would they pay me TWICE about the SAME SITUATION? I got $20 2 different times for the same situation. The first $20 was probably for the bad service itself. The second $20 was for the poorly written menu more than likely.

You even say she didn&apos;t charge you the mountain dew. did you tell her she forgot. oh no no no of course not you don&apos;t play like that, you only are*HONEST*if they overcharge you.

HELL NO I DIDNT TELL HER. WHY would I make myself***WAIT****EVEN*****LONGER****to leave because of all of their mistakes? They SHOULD give something for messing up all that stuff to*MAKE-UP*for the mistake out of*COMMON DECENCY. Its NOT about the NOT WANTING TO PAY, its about my********TIME******I dont wont to WASTE. The past few weeks, weve been having overcharges, which took a while to fix. Dont think I want to WASTE TIME getting more added to the bill. ARE YOU NUTS? If they forgot and if they did well, the money will be in the tip for the soft drink and they can decide to be*HONEST*ENOUGH TO RING UP THE DRINK AFTER I HAVE LEFT. Telling me about being honest, but you aren&apos;t telling vitalryan about his DISHONESTY BY NOT RINGING UP SOME SOFT DRINKS. You&apos;ve got your nerve ONLY telling me something. BTW, it&apos;s*NOT*THE CUSTOMER&apos;S RESPONSIBILITY TO BRING UP THINGS THAT AREN&apos;T CHARGED. So, if anything, the*SERVER*is being dishonest to the restaurant owner by*NOT*DOUBLE CHECKING THE CHECK. Like if the service was good, Id just give a couple of bucks MORE in the tip, so in a way, I WOULD be paying for it, just not have the damn LONG WAIT to ENDURE, which if they want a better tip, they are damn well***NOT***going to make me wait ANY LONGER to leave. In other words, if I have to sit there and wait for them to add a soft drink to the bill, their tip will go down quite a bit. If they want a good tip and if they do notice it after they delivered the check, it would be in ANY servers best interest*NOT*to tell the customer and the customer will appreciate NOT having to*WAIT LONGER TO LEAVE. Some people go to movies or something like that, so MOST people DONT want to wait after they have finished several minutes to get the check fixed to leave. I had ENOUGH of****WAITING*****with all the forgotten and messed up items. LIKE HELL IM GOING TO WAIT TO GET MORE PUT ON MY BILL. They put me through ENOUGH WAITING. HELL WITH THEM WITH THEIR NO APOLOGIES! They treated me with no respect, so I will do EXACTLY THE SAME in the tip as well as not telling them about the mountain dew. Its NOT MY FAULT HER LAZY ASS*DECIDED*NOT TO DOUBLE CHECK THE CHECK!

teleburst
&quot;I guess that Tilapia is part of the&quot;sandwich&quot;section as well.&quot;

But the title of the entree is*NOT*&quot;SANDWICH&quot;is it? See how Applebee&apos;s put&quot;Sandwiches, Burgers, and Rollups&quot;on the top of the page, which I feel that is VERY MISLEADING. That page should only contain those items it states considering its in BIG, BOLD PRINT AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE.

&quot;And there is is. That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about. Getting over. An you complain about restaurants losing money on the 1 out of 10,000 unwanted beverage refils.&quot;

NO, THAT&apos;S NOT WHAT IT&apos;S ABOUT AT ALL. YOU ARE SO WRONG! I mentioned that to prove to you they*PAID*me for this experience, because they*KNOW*the menu is misleading. They are*ADMITTING*AT FAULT by paying me to come back to their restaurant. THAT IS THE****ONLY*****REASON WHY I MENTIONED THIS. TO PROVE TO YOU THEY KNOW I AM RIGHT ABOUT WHAT THE MENU STATES TO PAY ME TO COME BACK TO THEIR RESTAURANT TWICE, FOR THE SAME INCIDENT.

&quot;But you said that the menu price is&quot;the advertised price&quot;. Thanks for proving yourself wrong.&quot;

As I said before,*ONLY*if theres a coupon does it override the price. This is what I said about it: If you have a coupon, the description OVERRIDES the menu to*SOME*degree. You do have to go according to*BOTH*because if the menu states 2 sides come with the entre, but the coupon states a free side, thats altogether 3 sides the customer is supposed to get as long as there are no exclusions or exceptions to that entre.

Just like someone who makes $7.85 an hour.

I make MORE than that. I just forgot to talk about it in my last post.

And you didn&apos;t read the description or look at the picture either.

YES I DID. You have NEVER had an entre before come with(2)sides? I bet you will tell me YES? They do have entrees that come with 2 side dishes you know.

Funny thing is - it&apos;s a hell of your own making.

NO, it was the hell of the*SERVER and the FOOD RUNNER*NOT READING the menu for***EXACTLY***what it states and the person that wrote the menu that way in the first place.

So*HOW*is that the*CUSTOMERS*fault? There are NO EXCEPTIONS to*ANY*of the sandwiches, just rollups. LEARN HOW TO READ.

Yes, and the wording had nothing about fries with The Tango Chicken Sandwich. Only fruit salad. Thank you for proving yourself wrong yet again.

The wording was ALL SANDWICHES, ROLLUPS(EXCEPT FOR STEAK FAJITA ROLLUP, AND BURGERS INCLUDE FRIES. Well, you have proved YOURSELF WRONG YET AGAIN! READ THE MENU!*ALL SANDWICHES*MEANS EXACTLY, EXACTLY, EXACTLY, THAT CONSIDERING THERE ISNT ANY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS SANDWICH.

vozveratu
Weightwatchers who are watching their weight would assume the sandwich(which is under&apos;Entree&apos;of that portion would know that it comes with fruit by the picture that is supplied.

Thats exactly the problem. For one thing, even merriteri has ADMITTED NOT ALL PEOPLE ORDER THAT SANDWICH BECAUSE THEY ARE WATCHING THEIR WEIGHT, so NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO KNOW THEY WILL NOT GET DELIVERED FRIES. Also, if you*ASSUME*instead of going according to the*WRITTEN EXACT WORDS*, then you are asking for you food to come out wrong. Just like when a server*ASSUMES*I am ready for the check or*ASSUMES*I want a refill of the same soft drink. NO ONE SHOULD*****EVER*****ASSUME ANYTHING AND ALWAYS GO WITH THE EXACT WORDING OF THE MENU.

Man, your stupid.

NO, THATS YOU WHO CANT READ. Even at the TOP OF THE PAGE that the Tango Chicken Sandwich is on it lists: SANDWICHES, ROLLUPS, AND BURGERS. A*SANDWICH*IS A*SANDWICH*NO MATTER WHERE IT IS ON THE MENU, CONSIDERING THE MENU DOESNT STATE IN THIS SECTION ONLY OR ALL ENTREES BELOW OR ANY EXCLUSIONS FOR****ANY****OF THE SANDWICHES.

 http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:z8_3GEdzqgEJ:federalhillrestaurants.com/balt imorerestaurantmenu.pdf+entrees%27+below+come+with+fries&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd= 28 

All entrees below except Jambalaya include two sides: Veggie or Potato Du Jour,
Cole Slaw, Potato Salad, Mushrooms Marsala, Boardwalk Style Fries, or Rice Pilaf)

This menu states EXCEPT(KEY WORD)and it also has ALL ENTREES****BELOW****(OTHER KEY WORDS)that Jambalaya DOESNT include 2 sides.

See, these people COVERED THEIR BUTTS, APPLEBEES DIDNT!

coorslite
WRONG! Because then you would&apos;ve been charged for a side of fries.

NO, according to the*EXACT WORDING*on the menu, EVER SINGLE SANDWICH INCLUDES FRIES. So, NO, I WOULDNT HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR FRIES.

If you had been civil to your server and asked if you could sub them there would&apos;ve been no extra charge. You wanted to be a greedy scamming pig. You don&apos;t want to pay for everything. Especially service!

YOU ARE SO DAMN WRONG! Be civil to a food runner and a server who DIDNT apologize for forgetting EVERY CONDIMENT I asked for, is NUTS after all those mistakes they made. I asked for a side of ranch with the mozzarella sticks, NO APOLOGY, which I WAS NICE about it and told the food runner I ordered a side of ranch. The waitress brought out the ranch with NO SORRY. Then my food arrives from the food runner with NO 2 sides of mayonnaise, NO 1 side of mustard, and NO 1 side of ranch as I ordered. NO SORRY FOR ANY OF THESE MISTAKES. Then I see my sandwich doesnt have fries. NO SORRY for that either and trying to argue with me about it, when the menu states*ALL SANDWICHES(TANGO CHICKEN******SANDWICH*****)INCLUDE FRIES, doesnt make*ANY SENSE*to ARGUE ABOUT THIS. I also had bbq ranch on my sandwich which possibly may have been the cooks fault, but she may have also printed the ticket incorrectly, but I got NO SORRY FOR THAT EITHER.

I DIDNT DO this on purpose. I went according to the menu. I AM*****NOT****trying to SCAM ANYTHING. The service was awful and I gave ZERO for her lack of being nice. I told her Thank you when she brought my forgotten ranch the first time around with the mozzarella sticks I was sitting waiting to eat and she didnt have the DECENY to say she was sorry. My husband was almost finished his share of the cheese sticks by the time I got the ranch. I respected her, she gave me NO RESPECT BACK. With ALL THOSE MISTAKES and ARGUING WITH ME about what the menu EXACTLY STATES, she got her ZERO TIP as she deserved. Any good waitress would have brought all those condiments BEFORE the meal, because the food runner doesnt care, because they are getting paid ANYWAY through a percentage of the sales. The food runner SHOULD have done his job, but he didnt read the ticket as usual and he didnt read the menu, just like the server didnt read the menu.

Stop scamming restaurants.

IM*****NOT******SCAMMING RESTAURANTS! HOW IS THIS*SCAMMING*THEM AT THEIR OWN WORDS? IF THEY WROTE IT, THEY SHOULD BLAME THEMSELVES FOR WRITING THINGS WRONG. DONT BLAME THE CUSTOMER FOR THAT!

Apologize to everyone on this board and on bitter for all of your horrible acusations.

WHY APOLOGIZE WHEN THEY ARE CALLING ME LOADS AND FAT, when I AM***********NOT**********FAT? HONESTLY, have you EVER seen black before because your blood sugar went too low? Have you almost fainted from not eating enough sugar? I HAVE. Just recently around labor day, which was the Thursday before the labor day weekend, I ate 1 and half cups of reeses puffs cereal for breakfast with a little skim milk. Then for lunch I ate a peach and then for dinner I ate a small banana. I also went power shopping getting a bunch of cokes that were on sale, so I was walking in and out of the store a bunch. I probably was on my feet for about an hour and a half power walking most of that time. Well, I also had things to do at home like shower, get things ready for work, etc. My body felt tired, MUCH more than usual, because of all that power walking with less than 500 calories in my body. Well, you know what? That night I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw black and I had to eat some sugar to feel better. I felt hot and weak. I tried at first some coke, which didnt work very well, so then I ate some reeses puffs cereal which DID the trick. My point is, I AM NOT FAT! I GO THROUGH SOME BIG THINGS JUST NOT TO GET FAT. I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT I WORK HARD***NOT***TO GET FAT. I know that I could eat better and not do all that, but then HOW WOULD I ENJOY LIFE? I LOVE FOOD. MOST PEOPLE DO. When people get together at a party or anywhere for that matter, MOST people think of food. You go to the movies, popcorn or candy, you go to a fair-corndogs or funnel cakes or candied apples, you go to the bowling alley or football game-snack foods like nachos. Dont you get that its hard to be not fat and ENJOY life as great without food and STILL BE NOT FAT? I dont know ANY OTHER WAY TO*PROVE*TO YOU IM NOT FAT, except for a picture, which I am NEVER DOING, because someone could hunt me down and kill me, literally, because you all hate me. I dont want to make it that easy to find out what I look like. If bistroy does, well, hell see Im NOT fat. Hell also see that I give 25% or higher tips to great serves and that I am NICE to the servers if he finds out who I really am. Im not going to make it easier for him though by putting a picture on here.
I also dont know how penelopemarie did it by being anorexic for 5 days without fainting? Just one day for me without enough sugar and too much exercise got me almost fainting.

We are not thieves. We are not mean.

BULLCRAP! YOU WERE TOO LAZY ASS TO DOUBLE CHECK PEOPLES CHECKS IF YOU WERE GOING TO OVERCHARGE THEM OR NOT! THATS UNCARING, WHICH IS*MEAN*OF YOU ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF! YOU ARE A THIEF IF YOU DID NOT RETURN THE MONEY YOU STOLE TO THOSE INNOCENT CUSTOMERS.

Because you are never sorry.

YOU ARENT SORRY YOU OVERCHARGED THOSE INNOCENT CUSTOMERS, BECAUSE YOU HAVENT RETURNED THE MONEY YOU OVERCHARGED THEM AS WELL AS RECEVIED HIGHER TIPS FROM, YOU THIEF!

Are your food stamps not enough?

We DONT LIVE ON FOOD STAMPS. Ive NEVER USED A FOOD STAMP IN MY LIFETIME.

Have you ever walked in to crapplebee&apos;s and a server was HAPPY to see you? Not just the fake smile, but a real smile.

YES, LOTS OF TIMES AT DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS.

The Tango Chicken Sandwhich is on a completely different section on the menu, listed under ENTREES, underneath 15 other items that have NOTHING to do with sandwhiches. After actually looking at the menu, holy crap, loads, you are a freaking retard.

Calling me a RETARD when you CANT SPELL SANDWICHES correctly. LOOK IN THE MIRROR! Anyway, you are a RETARD, because in the*****NAME****OF THE ENTRE IS CALLED*********SANDWICH********, so it has*******EVERYTHING******to do with EVERY********************SANDWICH**************! LOOK AT THE NAME OF THE ENTRE. IT HAS THE WORD*****SANDWICH*****, DUMBASS! THE SECTIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING, considering the menu has on the TOP OF THE PAGE SANDWICHES, ROLLUPS, AND BURGERS and the menu DOESNT state: All sandwiches in this section include fries.

Let alone the NON-SANDWHICH items... Retard.

YOU ARE A RETARD, BECAUSE IT IS A*****SANDWICH*****ITEM, IDIOT!
See how***SPECIFIC***this menu is.
 http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:X41sHO5cN8AJ:www.daveandbusters.com/pdfs/men u.pdf+menus+%22include+fries%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=21 

All our hamburgers are served with French fries, lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles.

Double Cheeseburger Stack
9 Net Carbs
Double meat and double cheese without the bun, specially seasoned with Mesquite pepper.
Served with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles. Does not include fries.

See, how they made sure to put one of the burgers that dont include fries to be in the DESCRIPTION of that burger. Thats a type of EXCLUSION. Meaning, the Tango Chicken sandwich SHOULD have had that description or something like that if Applebees doesnt want you to have BOTH fruit and fries. See, these people are covering their butts. ALL BURGERS, but then they list an exception for this particular burger: DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER STACK. WHY DIDNT APPLEBEES COVER THEIR BUTTS? THEY COULD HAVE, BUT CHOSE NOT TO. The Tango Chicken Sandwich DOES come with FRUIT and FRIES as the menu states, PERIOD!

Get a decent job, lol.. go WAIT TABLES and make some decent money.

So I can work on holidays and weekends. Youve got to be kidding me that I want that CRAPPY JOB. TELL ME*HOW*IS IT*DECENT*TO WORK ON THANKSGIVING OR ANY OTHER HOLIDAY? I think that SUCKS. So DECENT that people HATE working as waitress or waiter. So GREAT that waiters and waitresses DONT normally make it as their CAREER, because they want to do something*BETTER*with their lives. Yeah, its such a decent job! NOT! YOU ARE A RETARD! So DECENT that they have that dru darby list around the ENTIRE INTERNET that people keep reposting on xanga, myspace, livejournal, blogger, etc.
 http://www.drudarby.com/other/tipping.htm 
YOU ARE AN IDIOT TO CALL BEING A WAITER OR WAITRESS A DECENT JOB! NO, ITS NOT DECENT.

Then you can go eat at way better restaurants.

I MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, RATHER EAT AT CHILIS, OUTBACK, APPLEBEES, AND RED LOBSTER****ANY DAY****OVER SOME FANCY CRAP RESTAURANT. Ive tried margaritas at fancy restaurants and Chilis DEFINITELY has MUCH BETTER margaritas than fancy restaurants. Id MUCH RATHER have a burger from Chilis than a steak thats $30 an entre. It TASTE BETTER to me. I wouldnt want to eat at those places very much even if I was a millionaire , HONESTLY, Id still go to chain restaurants even if I had money to throw away. You dont get that I LOVE THE FOOD AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS. WHY have filet mignon if I can have baby back ribs from chilis you know? I remember when I went to a luncheon for Christmas in 2004 with my former co-workers at the job at the law firm I used to work at. They only gave us 2 choices from this fancy restaurant, which was a fish entre(cant remember the name, I think salmon)or filet mignon and I chose the filet mignon. I HONESTLY preferred eating a Wendys hamburger than to eat that. Yes, it was good, but I PREFER junk food. It taste SO MUCH BETTER than that steak did in my opinion.

And then you&apos;ll actually have a clue as to what you are talking about.

YES, I KNOW HOW TO READ! IF THE MENU STATES THAT ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES WITH NO EXCEPTIONS TO ANY OF THE SANDWICHES, THEN THATS WHAT IT MEANS.

caby_kay
Why have&apos;t you replied to bistroy about all of the chain restaurants in your area? SCARED?

NO, I DID REPLY. YOU JUST CANT READ, CAN YOU? THIS IS WHAT I SAID ABOVE: Do it, if you want, I DON&apos;T GIVE A DAMN. If you find out what I look like, you&apos;ll be VERY SUPRISED TO SEE that I&apos;m*NOT*fat like you think I am that you keep calling me&quot;LOADS.&quot;If you find out, SO WHAT. I could CARE LESS.

I REPLIED YOU IDIOT! READ NEXT TIME! NO, IM NOT***SCARED***BECAUSE I AM***NOT***SCAMMING ANYONE!

 Loads,
Again, it&apos;s on a completely seperate part of the menu. Even if they missed the specific exclusion when printing the menu, the point is, that 99% of the people ordering the food, KNOW it doesn&apos;t come with fries, since its, well, on a DIFFERENT part of the menu, and even STATES WHAT IT COMES WITH.

And you can keep bashing the serving job, lol... You are hilarious. You are a data entry chump, you make 1/3 of what I make, i GAURANTEE IT. I get health and dental benefits, and a schedule that is extremely flexible, I can have almost any day off I want. Suck on that! Mind you, I only need to work 3-4 days a week as well.

Many servers DO make it as a career, but you wouldn&apos;t know that because you frequent crappy chain restaurants with crappy college kid servers who DONT make very much and could care less about the job. There are waiters all over New York who pull down 6 figures. And most waiters at GOOD restaurants have been waiting for years, and pull down VERY good incomes. And from my experience, when they do leave, it&apos;s for a job that they love, not about the money. You however, work a dismal, pathetic data entry job, your job SUCKS, you make no money, don&apos;t have a flexible schedule, and should be embarrassed to just mention what you do.

There is a BIG difference between me and you Loads, your life is pathetic, I turn down $15-$20/hr jobs all the time. I would rather spend my mornings working on my business, or diving off my boat, or at the beach, etc. You sit and punch in data. Then when you can, you go and get a $6 burger and a happy hour margarita, then bitch about everything, all because you have unreasonable expectations from crappy restaurants who can only employ people that don&apos;t give a crap about you or your side of ranch. With the attitude you have, and the way you carry yourself, and the way you live your life, you&apos;ll ALWAYS be a loser. lol. pathetic.

And of course you don&apos;t eat at better restaurants, your&quot;I like Chili&apos;s food&quot;is a joke, their burgers are nasty compared to a nice restaurants options. The service is not near as good either, which seems to be YOUR beef. You just can&apos;t afford to eat somewhere better, so you convince yourself that you like the crappy restaurants, it&apos;s funny.

Has it occured to you that your servers forget your sides ON PURPOSE. Stiff a server ONE TIME, and you will be hated by EVERYONE in that restaurant forever. We had a guy that was just like you, everyone would ignore him when he came in, give slow, crappy service to him, forget his drinks, etc. He thought he was hot sht, but after a couple months, he finally stopped coming in since every server he had was so&quot;terrible&quot;... lol.. loads, it&apos;s not because the servers suck, it&apos;s because they don&apos;t like you.

 &quot;I asked for a side of ranch with the mozzarella sticks, NO APOLOGY, which I WAS NICE about it and told the food runner I ordered a side of ranch. The waitress brought out the ranch with NO SORRY. Then my food arrives from the food runner with NO 2 sides of mayonnaise, NO 1 side of mustard, and NO 1 side of ranch as I ordered.&quot;

You actually require that many condiments to eat a meal? You can&apos;t eat mozzarella sticks without ranch? I can actually picture you sitting there pouting while waiting for your ranch. You wanted your waitress to kiss your butt because she dissed your ranch. LOL

The waitress argued with you because logically, the stupid freaking sandwich wasn&apos;t supposed to come with fries. I know you wanted to go all lawyer-like on her ass about a stupid side of fries talking about exclusions and what&apos;s irrelevant, blah blah blah, but the fact of the matter is, that sandwich wasn&apos;t supposed to come with fries. You&apos;re probably the only person in the history of that restaurant that ever kicked up a fuss over a $1 side of fries. Are you proud of that? Do you think you impressed anybody there that night? You made an absolute fool out of yourself over something so trivial and I&apos;m sure everybody clapped when you left.

&quot;WHY PAY FOR BACON IF YOU DON&apos;T WANT IT?&quot;

What, if you order a sandwich that ordinarily comes with bacon, without the bacon, you think you&apos;re actually out a little money? What, 50 cents? Is that worth all of this drama? Don&apos;t you have anything more important to do with your time? You&apos;re always so concerned about people wasting your time, but do you actually do anything worthwhile with your time, besides power shopping to get the cheapest price on the garbage you consider food?

&quot;Dont you get that its hard to be not fat and ENJOY life as great without food and STILL BE NOT FAT?&quot;

Are you serious with this? I enjoy food more than anyone I know(doritos, soda, hot pockets, etc are not considered real food)and I&apos;m not fat. Food is great but you can consider life GREAT without the stuff you consider food.

&quot;I GO THROUGH SOME BIG THINGS JUST NOT TO GET FAT. I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT I WORK HARD***NOT***TO GET FAT.&quot;

Starving yourself four days a week in order to eat junk on the weekends would be considered an eating disorder. I&apos;m almost twice your age, with a lower metabolism and I eat great food every day, depriving myself of nothing.

You not only have an eating disorder, you have a personality disorder. You create your own problems, worrying about people trying to get over on you, counting pennies, starving yourself and then gorging on the most unhealthy foods imaginable. I think you have an intense self-loathing and you punish yourself constantly and you don&apos;t even realize it.

There&apos;s no accounting for taste and you were obviously brought up to believe that the swill you enjoy is real food. You&apos;re supposed to be a grown-up now and take care of your body.

I have to ask, was your mother proud when you pulled the hissy fit over the fries with po-boy coupon? Is your husband proud and impressed when you act like a recalcitrant child in public places, or is he trying to disappear under the table or in the men&apos;s room? I ask because if my son, daughter or husband ever treated waitstaff or others the way you treat people, I&apos;d knock them into next week. Of course they know that, so they&apos;d never do it. They were raised correctly.

Why do you think everyone here hates you? Is this the only place everyone hates you? Is there anyplace that anyone actually likes you?

 &quot;My point is, I AM NOT FAT! I GO THROUGH SOME BIG THINGS JUST NOT TO GET FAT. I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT I WORK HARD***NOT***TO GET FAT. I know that I could eat better and not do all that, but then HOW WOULD I ENJOY LIFE? I LOVE FOOD. MOST PEOPLE DO.&quot;

so there it is. again GET HELP, stop taking out your eating disorder on the people that are there to serve you your food. it is not our fault that for*YOU*it is the end of the world if you don&apos;t get everything you want to stuff your face with. this is your own fault, and if you choose to keep having this eating lifestyle it is of your own doing. at least when i wanted to starve myself i was unhappy with myself but i didn&apos;t take out on anyone. i almost screwed up my digestive system and my metabolism. you are killing your body. i would actually feel more sorry for you if you weren&apos;t such a disgusting immature little crap of a person.

&quot;HOW THE HELL WOULD SOMEONE THAT DOESN&apos;T COUNT POINTS, KNOW*HOW MANY*POINTS = WHATEVER AMOUNT?&quot;

i didn&apos;t say you should KNOW how many points something should have. you should have the common sense to know that weight watcher = healthy loose or mantain weight food, and that does not include fried potato strips(french fries). DO NOT TAKE WHAT WE WRITE OUT OF CONTEXT TO SOUND MORE,*holds back laughter*i mean less dumb.

it is ok not to tell your server that she didn&apos;t charge you for your drink, because that is the way you pay for your lost time. what about the time and the mental pain your server had to go through to serve you. it is ok not to get charged, but it is a&quot;living hell&quot;to get overcharged. are you that much of a money controling freak. THE WORLD WON&apos;T END BECAUSE OF LITTLE MISTAKES. maybe they already know your sorry ass and they do all this on purpose just to piss you off....i would it is fun.

&quot;YOU ARE AN IDIOT TO CALL BEING A WAITER OR WAITRESS A DECENT JOB! NO, ITS NOT DECENT.&quot;

so being a waitress is not a decent job, hmmmm pissed because we can make more money than you, and that of course you didn&apos;t make half the money we make while you were having your adventures at the donut shop. explain to me why it is not decent. i make greatm money, i am not robbing anyone, i don&apos;t prostitute myself while i serve. what is the f******problem with it. YOU ARE THE PERSON THAT IS NOT DECENT, PEOPLE THAT TREAT OTHER PEOPLE THE WAY YOU TREAT RANDOM PEOPLE IS NOT AT ALL DECENT OR RESPECTABLE.

so you prefer fast food and food that is loaded with salt, sugar, and fat than real food. wow what a great taste you must have. i thought you just had mental problems, now i know that not only are you disturbed, you are also TRASH.


i highly doubt you are any different in your life from what you post on these sites. poor family of yours. i really do not know how they can manage.

i am going to let you in on a little secret...keep eating like you do and you will get fat, and you know what else you won&apos;t know how to eat. you will starve yourself more and eventually your body will want more and more and more,but the damage is done. tsk tsk...in the end you will still be miserable.

anorexia and bulimia are not things to take as a joke, especially if you have them...so don&apos;t you dare make jokes at my expense, at least i was a stronger person, accepted my problem and fixed it. i eat, i look good, and i don&apos;t deprive myself.

 Haha, me too! I&apos;m killing time waiting for my sauce to cook down so I can assemble my lasagna. Should I eat it? Would a Hot Pocket and a few doritos have less calories?

Maybe I should have a bowl of cereal instead. Maybe that&apos;s the secret to living a GREAT LIFE.

 big_momma, no just hit up your local applebees right quick, get a burger with 12 sides, when they show up with 11 sides, whine and complain, get it for free. Then come back home and continue writing books on internet forums.

 Vital, if I ate the way that moron does I&apos;d have to hook up the internet in the bathroom. Who eats like that?

Did you ever notice that people that live on junk food smell funny? They have a very strange&quot;aroma&quot;. It&apos;s almost as if stale grease is oozing from their pores. There&apos;s a woman in my office like that and I can always smell where she&apos;s been.

 Yes, for an insurance company. She&apos;s probably entering executive claim summary data, which would explain her pathetic new attempts at using legalese.

She can talk like them lawyers fo sho! All she needs to do is use the words exclusion and irrelevant and she&apos;s ready to take the bar.

 you should definitely eat a cereal...the resees puff that is*sarcastic tone*extremely healthy yeah right. i remember when i used to eat 500 calories and burn 400, then i&apos;d wait till sunday or saturday, starve all day, exercise, and then go to these casual dinning places and stuff myself. i lived for that day, just like lords does, but i wasn&apos;t a anal b****about it. now i can&apos;t stand the food, after seeing just how many calories, sugar, salt and fat...no way. plus i have a daughter and i want to teach her good habits, not a way to kill your body to feel like you accomplished something.

 &quot;I know that I could eat better and not do all that, but then HOW WOULD I ENJOY LIFE? I LOVE FOOD. MOST PEOPLE DO.&quot;

This statement says it all, Penelope. For Lords, junk food is life. She has a serious disorder. For her the only enjoyment of life is eating trashy food. What does that say about her life in general?

Most people enjoy life and do it without getting fat. For Loads, power shopping is a workout. I&apos;m sure she&apos;s one of those people that have to park closest to the entrance of wherever she goes. She has no idea what a workout is. Then she pours that garbage into the skinny body she seems to be so proud of, taxing her liver. She&apos;s also a martyr, as if she&apos;s the only person that has to&quot;work&quot;to remain thin. Starving yourself isn&apos;t&quot;work&quot;, it&apos;s self-mutilation in a way.

If she wants to live like that, hey, more power to her. But don&apos;t confess to such stupidity and then tell servers how to do their jobs. She doesn&apos;t have the brains to maintain a healthy body or lifestyle for herself but she&apos;s smarter than servers and everyone on this board? She&apos;s not smart enough to cook for herself, which is cheaper than buying the trash food she eats, and usually healthier. She can&apos;t even reason how to read a menu, and how sections work. Not the brightest bulb on the tree, obviously.

Give me a break.

&quot;Even STATES WHAT IT COMES WITH.&quot;

That DOESN&apos;T mean it doesn&apos;t have(2)sides.

&quot;I get health and dental benefits, and a schedule that is extremely flexible, I can have almost any day off I want.&quot;

I was talking about college students working at these chain restaurants. Here&apos;s a couple of blogs of some people&apos;s opinions about the holidays and working as a server. For some reason, they think you should tip more just because it&apos;s a certain day. That is just plain RIDICULOUS. I am NOT talking about professional waiters at a fancy restaurant. I am talking about working at chain restaurants or restaurants that have prices like chain restaurants.

 http://family2love.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-tip-and-why.html 

&quot;12. Holidays for us don&apos;t exist. Example: If you are eating at our restraunt on a holiday like Thanksgiving and you wish us a happy Thanksgiving, do you honestly think we are having a good Thanksgiving. No, we are stuck at work because it is mandatory for us to be there serving you lazy people, who don&apos;t want to cook, instead of being at home with your families. So be a little more thoughtful when tipping because we are stuck there working and no we do NOT get paid overtime.&quot;

 http://jonimsane.blogspot.com/2006/03/tipping-education.html 

&quot;On holidays, you should tip extremely well. Take into consideration that these people are spending their time serving you instead of being with their loved ones so that you can enjoy time with yours. Reward them for it.&quot;

&quot;You make no money&quot;

YES I DO.

&quot;Don&apos;t have a flexible schedule, and should be embarrassed to just mention what you do.&quot;

I have weekends off and time at home at the end of the day. I am***PROUD***of being able to have a job that I don&apos;t have to work weekends and holidays as well as don&apos;t EVER have to work overtime either. Like with servers at chain restaurants, sometimes you have to say over the time due to someone not showing up or people that stay passed closing time, etc. In other words, when the clock says 5:30p.m., I know I can clock out. Servers don&apos;t have that luxury normally unless they are at a fancy restaurant more than likely. Like at the donut shop, I had to z-out my register and count the money, checks, etc. So I&apos;d work a shift such as 6a.m.-2p.m., but wouldn&apos;t get off until(depending on if the worker that was on the next shift was on time)2:15p.m. or so. At my job, I&apos;d be able to leave at 2p.m. if that was my shift and NOT have to stay ANY LONGER than that. Servers end up staying longer after their shift. I know, because my sister-in-law is a waitress and going to college. Technically the shift ends let&apos;s say 11p.m., but you still have things to do after. It&apos;s not like a set schedule and on top of that, if someone doesn&apos;t come in, who do they call, the server to take their place. That happened when my sister-in-law worked at Chevy&apos;s Fresh Mex a couple of years ago. She didn&apos;t have a day off for 7 days one time and got a call from the manager to work on her day off. She told him&quot;No&quot;, that she wanted her day off. I don&apos;t blame her. It reminds me of the donut shop days where they&apos;d call me to come in for someone that quit or wasn&apos;t coming in and that I&apos;d end up working sometimes 50-65 hrs a week. Even a couple of weeks broke 70 hrs. I DON&apos;T WANT THAT LIFE ANYMORE, NO WAY! These chain restaurant managers work servers like slaves at times. So SHUT THE HELL UP ABOUT THAT IT&apos;S SUCH A GLORIOUS OF JOB. Maybe your job is, but MOST servers that are college students working at Applebee&apos;s, Chili&apos;s, Outback, etc. AREN&apos;T HAPPY with their jobs as servers.

&quot;I turn down $15-$20/hr jobs all the time.&quot;

WHO CARES. Just as you rather turn down those jobs to work on your business, well I&apos;d RATHER not make that type of money and be off on the weekends and holidays as well as have no overtime. I don&apos;t care about the money you turn down. I REALLY DON&apos;T CARE, HONESTLY.

&quot;I like Chili&apos;s food&quot;is a joke, their burgers are nasty compared to a nice restaurants options.&quot;

TO EACH IT&apos;S OWN. Your opinion. My opinion is, the burgers are DELICIOUS. I&apos;d rather have a burger from there ANYDAY than from a fancy restaurant. Your entitled to your taste and I&apos;m entitled to mine, so QUIT putting my taste down. I AM NOT YOU AND YOU ARE NOT ME. People all like different things, don&apos;t you know this?

&quot;You just can&apos;t afford to eat somewhere better, so you convince yourself that you like the crappy restaurants, it&apos;s funny.&quot;

I CAN AFFORD TO EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE, but&quot;BETTER&quot;is in the eye of the beholder. To me, HONESTLY, CHILI&apos;S, OUTBACK, RED LOBSTER, AND APPLEBEE&apos;S have BETTER TASTING FOOD THAN UPSCALE RESTAURANTS. As I just stated before, even if I was a millionaire or billionaire, I&apos;d STILL RATHER go to Chili&apos;s more often than go at an upscale restaurant. The food taste better. When TGIFridays was here before they left Louisiana, I use to LOVE their ribs. I think that had some of the best ribs and still probably do, but in other states, not Louisiana. They had good food too and good margaritas. I went to an upscale place with my husband in may for our anniversary and I had a margarita there, it was CRUMMY. I ended up getting a white russian, which was ok, but I have had better. I also had a glass of wine, which was pretty good for wine, but I STILL RATHER MARGARITAS AT CHILI&apos;S. They just taste SO MUCH BETTER. Also, my entree I got a steak, which was ok, but it&apos;s not as good as Chili&apos;s food that isn&apos;t steaks. I do think the steak quality was better at the fancy restaurant, but I&apos;m not a big steak eater. Like if I have a choice between tacos and a burger, I&apos;d pick a burger even though I DO like both, well this is the same thing. I liked the steak, but truly would have preferred Chili&apos;s food(NOT their steaks). My point is, I RATHER junk food stuff like mozzerella sticks, southwestern eggrolls, nachos, burgers, fries, shrimp, etc. Like I wouldn&apos;t pick steak if I could have mozzerella sticks. Sorry, but I MUCH RATHER THE TASTE OF MOZZERELLA STICKS.

&quot;Has it occured to you that your servers forget your sides ON PURPOSE.&quot;

NO, because we&apos;ve had times where we&apos;d get great service after a stiff LOTS AND LOTS, AND LOTS OF TIMES. Also, they are ONLY HURTING THEIR POCKETS. If they don&apos;t try to do well, well, what kind of tip do you expect? You expect 25% to forget things, you have to be kidding me. If they do it on purpose, that would be making themselves work harder to make another trip, which would be punishing their feet. I doubt that people would do more trips if they don&apos;t have to. Also, I&apos;ve been to restaurants for the VERY FIRST TIME and been in the areas for the first time, such as the Tango Chicken Sandwich incident happened in Nashville, TN when Katrina happened. NO ONE KNEW US AND WE DIDN&apos;T KNOW THEM. Servers forget because they are UNCARING AND TOO DAMN LAZY TO CARE IF THE CUSTOMER HAS WHAT THEY ORDERED. On some blogs I&apos;ve seen where servers say things like tell your server everything at once, not one at a time. Then, they decide to not double check the food and they end up forgetting the condiments, so then they end up making another trip for nothing. It boggles me they say&quot;ALL AT ONCE&quot;, but then don&apos;t bother to make themselves have less trips, because the customer(such as myself)make it easier for the servers when I don&apos;t ask for the condiments to be delivered before my meal and just order it WITH the meal. They make it harder on themselves.

I HONESTLY think they DON&apos;T do it on purpose. If they do, well you know what, their tip won&apos;t be as nice as it could have been. That&apos;s THEIR LOSS as well as mine. It&apos;s not like they are just hurting me.

&quot;Loads, it&apos;s not because the servers suck.&quot;

YES IT IS. A LOT of servers aren&apos;t smart enough to double check the food and bring out OBVIOUS things that are wrong and they also bring the check without an item or an item added or the wrong price. YES, SOME SERVERS***DO****SUCK!

big_momma
&quot;You wanted your waitress to kiss your butt because she dissed your ranch. LOL&quot;

I didn&apos;t want her to bow to me or something, just be*NICE*about her mistake, that&apos;s all. I EXPECT people to say their sorry when they mess up, just as anyone would expect for people to say&quot;Thank you&quot;for things or when someone holds the door for you to have a&quot;Thank you&quot;said to you. It&apos;s all about just being*NICE*about the mistake. You know you messed up, so at least*TRY TO MAKE-UP*for it. When I said&quot;Thank you&quot;when she brought the ranch for the mozzerella sticks, she COULD have said&quot;Sorry about that.&quot;It wasn&apos;t a wrong entree or something, so that type of apology would have been good enough. Honestly, I shouldn&apos;t have said&quot;Thank you&quot;, because she and the food runner forgot it. They should be apologizing to me for it, but I was nice to say&quot;Thank you&quot;, so I could have gotten a little bit of that respect back, you know. I found that was mean of her not to say sorry when I said&quot;Thank You.&quot;SHE SHOULD HAVE APOLOGIZED FOR ALL OF HER MISTAKES!

&quot;The stupid freaking sandwich wasn&apos;t supposed to come with fries.&quot;

The menu states it DOES.

&quot;What, 50 cents? Is that worth all of this drama?&quot;

I DIDN&apos;T KNOW THAT MY FOOD WOULD BE DELIVERED TO ME WITHOUT THE FRIES. WHY NOT SAVE 50 cents? Don&apos;t you ever use coupons? I use coupons a LOT when I shop at the store and I also have used coupons at some chain restaurants. WHY NOT save on the sandwich? I&apos;d rather give more to the server if they do a great job than to give it to the restaurant, honestly, I would.

&quot;Starving yourself four days a week in order to eat junk on the weekends would be considered an eating disorder. I&apos;m almost twice your age, with a lower metabolism and I eat great food every day, depriving myself of nothing.&quot;

I DON&apos;T STARVE MYSELF FOR FOUR DAYS. For one thing, I have(1)diet day, which is Thursday. From time to time, if I get over a certain weight, I will do a sorta of diet day where I will eat about 600 or so calories, so I do at most(2)days a week, but some weeks I only do(1)day a week. I do eat things on those days I may add if you read my post, which obviously you didn&apos;t to think I do this for 4 days. I have in the past when I was much younger like about 10 years ago, did diet for that long, but I don&apos;t do that anymore.

&quot;I have to ask, was your mother proud when you pulled the hissy fit over the fries with po-boy coupon?&quot;

She was arguing with the people along with me. So SHE WAS ON MY SIDE. She saves money just like I do. She uses coupons just as I do.

Plus this wasn&apos;t*WAITSTAFF*, because this was a place where you picked up your order at the window and placed the order at the window. So when you say:&quot;I ask because if my son, daughter or husband ever treated waitstaff&quot;, doesn&apos;t make ANY SENSE. I told you all how this place worked. There WEREN&apos;T ANY SERVERS.

penelopemarie
&quot;So there it is. again GET HELP, stop taking out your eating disorder on the people that are there to serve you your food.&quot;

I&apos;m NOT blaming anyone for*MY*choices. I was simply trying to explain that these people on here call me&quot;fat ass&quot;and&quot;loads&quot;to simply say I do things to control my weight so I don&apos;t get fat. THAT WAS MY ONLY reasoning for talking about it. Coorslite said to apologize to you all, when I feel that&apos;s ridiculous considering a lot of you say I&apos;m fat. THAT is WHY I mentioned this.

&quot;You should have the common sense to know that weight watcher = healthy loose or mantain weight food, and that does not include fried potato strips(french fries).&quot;

NOT to people who don&apos;t order that normally it&apos;s NOT. Also, if the menu states it does, that overrides*ASSUMPTIONS*which to you is called&quot;common sense.&quot;

&quot;I didn&apos;t say you should KNOW how many points something should have.&quot;

THEN WHY THE HELL MENTION POINTS THEN? THAT MEANS NOTHING TO THIS ARGUMENT. NOT EVERYONE THAT ORDERS THIS SANDWICH CARES ABOUT POINTS. SO MENTIONING THIS IS IRRELEVANT.

&quot;Hhmmmm pissed because we can make more money than you.&quot;

NO, as I said before, the Chili&apos;s manager OFFERED me a job and even last week when we were there, he made conversation about me working for him. If I wanted that job, I would, but I don&apos;t want to work weekends. I want to have some days off like anyone else would. My point is, I&apos;m NOT JEALOUS OF THE MONEY. That is the LAST THING I am thinking of. I KNOW I&apos;D MAKE MORE MONEY THAN MOST SERVERS BECAUSE I WOULD MAKE SURE THE FOOD IS 100% CORRECT AS FAR AS WHAT I COULD SEE. I&apos;D MAKE SURE I WOULDN&apos;T OVERCHARGE SOMEONE. I&apos;D MAKE SURE I&apos;D GO IN ORDER. Sure, everyone makes mistakes, but mine would be very few compared to most servers that are just too damn lazy to double check things or even write drink orders down, but then forget the damn drink or get the drink wrong.

 I don&apos;t think you got big_momma&apos;s point. It&apos;s not the fact that you were treating waitstaff terrible; it&apos;s the fact that you were treating people in general terrible. Who cares if the people at the pick-up window were waitstaff. You still treated them like sh**.

Get over yourself. You disgust me.

 Lords, what is wrong with you? Seriously, there&apos;s something in your brain that doesn&apos;t work right. Have you seen a doctor?

Why does it not surprise me that your mother was right behind you in the po-boy incident? She raised you to be the pig you are today. And a pig doesn&apos;t have to be a large person; a pig is a pig. It scratches in it&apos;s pen, wallows in the mud, has no manners and eats garbage with gusto. The description fits you to a tee.

 Cereal named after a candy, how suiting. How about some Raisin Bran? Cheerios? Low Fat Granola? You know grown up cereal? You could actually eat healthy food and more of it. When you starve your body of food, which fuels it, your metabolism slows down. So when you do eat your body stores it not knowing when it is going to get more nourishment.
But really who cares anyway, by lords standards she should be dying of something related to an eating disorder, and she would deserve it. Right lords? What you are doing to your body is every bit as bad as smoking cigarettes. Formerly Jammie

 Lol, Lords, why would you want to be off on weekends so bad? I LOVE working weekends and having weekdays off. Stores aren&apos;t busy at all, restaurants have no waits, beaches aren&apos;t crowded, theme parks have short lines, etc.. lol... And I don&apos;t have to work holidays, especially thanksgiving.

I NEVER have to work overtime, in fact, they are STRICT with the fact that we cannot work overtime. Plus, if I want a day off, I can just say&quot;hey, chris, switch shifts with me&quot;and bam, day off so i can go on the boat with my friends or whatever.

Did you READ my post about the fact that crappy chain restaurant serving gigs SUCK. Funny you repeated that to me, as if I didn&apos;t just say that.

The point is Lords, you are EASY to figure out. Your that pathetic&quot;I&apos;m content with having no money&quot;loser. People like you disgust me, you have no motivation to do something better with your life. Instead, you go into chain restaurants that EVEN YOU AGREED only have unhappy, lazy college student servers because well, they are cheap crappy chain restaurants where you make no money, who do you expect to work there? It all circles around YOU. You can&apos;t work a pathetic job and make no money, visit crappy restaurants because you have no money, yet expect to get big ticket treatment. The way YOU act is a self-fulfilling prophecy, you call everyone else lazy, but look in the mirror, you&apos;re a pathetic data entry monkey because you are TOO LAZY to get a decent job. Which again, trickles down to the type of treatment you&apos;ll get.

Oh, and TRUST ME, they forget your stuff on PURPOSE, they don&apos;t care about making an extra trip, they gotta come back anyways, but they&apos;ll go make a phone call while making that trip for your mayo. You see, to be to ruin YOUR meal is worth the extra effort and lost tip. But my god, TRUST ME, they do things like that on purpose ALL THE TIME. Some waiters suck, but the places you frequent, ESPECIALLY if you have stiffed or tipped very poorly at, will jack your stuff up so bad, it&apos;s not even funny.

 Lords,
Was the sandwich really good? Because it has cost you hours of your life sitting here posting about it. And we also did this a year ago. Must have been one hell of a sandwich.

 Jena, by her own admission she had to&quot;endure&quot;it and it was a&quot;living hell.&quot;
With that said wouldn&apos;t it have just been easier to ask&quot;May I have fries with that?&quot;I dont buy she had not a clue on the weight watchers menu fries were not included. Give me a break already. If per chance she did believe it, she sure shouldn&apos;t put it out on the world wide net. That is just down right stupid. Formerly Jammie

 just wait till your metabolism starts slowing down, you&apos;ll be having more than 2 diet days and probably a lot of binging and purging days. sometimes anorexia and bulimia go hand in hand. a little info i am going to sure with you. your mental problems with food are making you a miserable controlling person. that is why you want things done a certain way. do you know how many years of your life you are wasting on this petty sh**. i&apos;ve been there done that, but i would actually feel sorry for you if you weren&apos;t so mean and so f******ignorant...and so entitled.

stop taking my words out of context. the weight watchers menu was created for those people that do the weight watchers diet, and this diet consists of the damn points. so yes it is relevant because that is the whole point of the f*****weight watchers menu.

 Apologize to everyone on this board and on bitter for all of your horrible acusations.

WHY APOLOGIZE WHEN THEY ARE CALLING ME LOADS AND FAT, when I AM***********NOT**********FAT? HONESTLY, have you EVER seen black before because your blood sugar went too low? Have you almost fainted from not eating enough sugar? I HAVE. Just recently around labor day, which was the Thursday before the labor day weekend, I ate 1 and half cups of reeses puffs cereal for breakfast with a little skim milk. Then for lunch I ate a peach and then for dinner I ate a small banana. I also went power shopping getting a bunch of cokes that were on sale, so I was walking in and out of the store a bunch. I probably was on my feet for about an hour and a half power walking most of that time. Well, I also had things to do at home like shower, get things ready for work, etc. My body felt tired, MUCH more than usual, because of all that power walking with less than 500 calories in my body. Well, you know what? That night I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw black and I had to eat some sugar to feel better. I felt hot and weak. I tried at first some coke, which didnt work very well, so then I ate some reeses puffs cereal which DID the trick. My point is, I AM NOT FAT! I GO THROUGH SOME BIG THINGS JUST NOT TO GET FAT. I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT I WORK HARD***NOT***TO GET FAT. I know that I could eat better and not do all that, but then HOW WOULD I ENJOY LIFE? I LOVE FOOD. MOST PEOPLE DO. When people get together at a party or anywhere for that matter, MOST people think of food. You go to the movies, popcorn or candy, you go to a fair-corndogs or funnel cakes or candied apples, you go to the bowling alley or football game-snack foods like nachos. Dont you get that its hard to be not fat and ENJOY life as great without food and STILL BE NOT FAT? I dont know ANY OTHER WAY TO*PROVE*TO YOU IM NOT FAT, except for a picture, which I am NEVER DOING, because someone could hunt me down and kill me, literally, because you all hate me. I dont want to make it that easy to find out what I look like. If bistroy does, well, hell see Im NOT fat. Hell also see that I give 25% or higher tips to great serves and that I am NICE to the servers if he finds out who I really am. Im not going to make it easier for him though by putting a picture on here.
I also dont know how penelopemarie did it by being anorexic for 5 days without fainting? Just one day for me without enough sugar and too much exercise got me almost fainting.

You should apologize to my friends on this board because....
1. Their relatives dying of cancer does in no way relate to your not receiving ranch dressing.
2. You are the meanest human on the face of the earth next to BinLaden. You deserve all the abuse you get here. You have come to a place where servers in or out of the business, managers, bartenders ect... come to talk about tipping. Your input is useless unless it&apos;s for a few(and lately you are meaner than ever so it&apos;s very few)laughs.
3. If you were not so worried about pennies and crimes that are meaningless you may have actually read when penelopemarie first started posting she stated that she had an eating disorder. But then you don&apos;t care as long as you get your $5 off.
4. You get what you give. You give attitude. You get crap service. Karma.
5. We don&apos;t care about your inability to understand that we know because we work in the restaurant business that you are a scam artist. You are no better than the people that bilk old people out of their life savings. Oh wait... how did you get that house again?
6. Your agruements are so anal that no one reads your entire post. Because we are lazy? No because it&apos;s too much fun to pick apart your anal spewing!
7. Yes I did not check the new menu. I made about a nickle. And as far as that goes two of the women that I overcharged... Names are Mona and Susan... I told them. They work at Homedepot in Lancaster SC. Call them. Ask them what they said when I told them... I&apos;ll bet that nickle that they said... AND??????????? I also told the Duracell crew. No I didn&apos;t aplogize. I just told them. Guess what???? They didn&apos;t care. It was life ending for them! Imagine that~no I don&apos;t imagine that you can in your small mind.
8. With all that is going on in the world.... The amish shootings... 5 little girls died! The sixth is not expected to make it. The amish have forgiven the shooter, invited his family into thier homes... yet you are still concerned about a tango chicken sandwhich that comes with fruit not fries, how mean uncaring and selfish does that make you?
9. Your refusal to listen and learn makes you ignorant.
10. You suck and we don&apos;t.

 coors one thief to another. A few years ago my customer left me a tip in cash it was $5.00. When I cashed out the check, I entered into the computer $5.00 in the tip section. I should not have entered anything, since it was left in cash and didnt need to be entered into the computer. So basically I got double tipped, if I didnt take the five out of the drawer my drawer would be over. I know this woman&apos;s daughter, called her immediately. So when her mom came in again I gave her back $5.00, and explained my error. I was embarrassed, she told me&quot;calm down honey, $5.00 isn&apos;t worth all of that energy, but thanks for giving it back.&quot;
This is how normal people handle situations, same as your guests. Im sure these people have made mistakes so they are forgiving. Its a shame when a persons world is so small that they have to get irate over pennies. Lets put it in to perspective, the more things you let stress you the higher your blood pressure goes. Those pennies that have lords all wound up are going to end up costing her hundreds in Dr visits and co pays for medication to lower her blood pressure. Big picture is it worth it?????

 NO, as I said before, the Chili&apos;s manager OFFERED me a job and even last week when we were there, he made conversation about me working for him. If I wanted that job, I would, but I don&apos;t want to work weekends. I want to have some days off like anyone else would. My point is, I&apos;m NOT JEALOUS OF THE MONEY. That is the LAST THING I am thinking of. I KNOW I&apos;D MAKE MORE MONEY THAN MOST SERVERS BECAUSE I WOULD MAKE SURE THE FOOD IS 100% CORRECT AS FAR AS WHAT I COULD SEE. I&apos;D MAKE SURE I WOULDN&apos;T OVERCHARGE SOMEONE. I&apos;D MAKE SURE I&apos;D GO IN ORDER. Sure, everyone makes mistakes, but mine would be very few compared to most servers that are just too damn lazy to double check things or even write drink orders down, but then forget the damn drink or get the drink wrong.


Great chuckle over breakfast. Thanks Loads of crap! You wouldn&apos;t make it one day!!!!!!!! The manager probably wanted to hire you so that he could prove to you how**W**R**O**N**G**you are on so many levels!
Go away now and make some pizza delivery guys life a nightmare! At least you do abuse everyone equally~

It&apos;s the fact that you were treating people in general terrible. Who cares if the people at the pick-up window were waitstaff. You still treated them like sh**.

WERE YOU THERE? NO, YOU WERENT. I******DIDNT******TREAT THE PEOPLE LIKE SH**. The lady cashier and the guy employee or manager she was talking to about it with should have***NOT***ARGUED with a customer, PERIOD! That is NOT GOOD BUSINESS. Especially, I had*WRITTEN PROOF*that the*CUSTOMER WAS RIGHT*! HOW DARE THEY ARGUE WITH A CUSTOMER OVER THE COMPANYS BAD COUPON WRITING! We WERENT mean or anything. All we said was that the menu stated the po-boy sandwich came with an extra set of fries and that if they didnt want to give us the extra set of fries, then they should take off a buck for the sandwich w/fries, because the price includes fries on the menu. The coupon stated we were supposed to get a free small drink and a free small fry with the purchase of ANY sandwich. Which was the word ANY was in BIG BOLD LETTERS. It also DIDNT have*ANY*EXCLUSIONS OR EXCEPTIONS for the po-boys. ANY MEANS EXACTLY THAT WHEN THERE ARE NO EXCLUSIONS TO THE COUPON. They shouldnt have told us ANYTHING and gave us the fries WITHOUT****ANY****TYPE OF ARGUMENT WHAT-SO-EVER because the COUPON stated the EXACT WORDING that they were supposed to include an extra set of small fries with*ANY*sandwich purchase. They didnt just have shrimp po-boys, which is the po-boy we ordered. They also had oyster po-boys as well. They may have even had other seafood po-boys as well. My point is, if the COMPANYS OWNER didnt want*ANY*sandwich to get an extra set of free fries, they would have COVERED THEIR BUTTS and put an*EXCLUSION*such as NOT VALID ON SEAFOOD PO-BOYS or EXCLUDES SEAFOOD PO-BOYS. ALL KIND OF OTHER COMPANIES DO THIS. MOST ACTUALLY DO! Ive seen a gift shop that sold compact discs and the coupon had 10% off ANY item and it also had on the bottom of the coupon EXCLUDING MUSIC. So that gift shop owner COVERED HIS ASS. This restaurant owner did not. Its not rocket science to write a coupon. If you dont want someone to get a free fry for a certain sandwich, then have EXCLUSIONS with I just as EVERY OTHER COUPON IS WRITTEN THAT IVE SEEN. They should have not made a deal about it. The coupon had*EXACTLY*what we were supposed to receive for our money. So there SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN ANY SITUATION ABOUT IT. The words speak for themselves.

Get over yourself.

YOU GET OVER YOURSELF! If you dont want to use coupons, thats your STUPIDITY. Spend more for no real reason. What an IDIOT you are if you dont use coupons. You cant imagine the money Ive saved by using coupons throughout the years. Why do you think they have coupons? So you can go to that particular store or restaurant and buy their items. They WANT you to use them so they can make more money, because they want you to go and maybe spend more or even try the place for the first time and love it, which you would keep going back. Repeat customers and word of mouth that a restaurant is good are VERY GOOD for business.

vitalryan
Lords, why would you want to be off on weekends so bad?

Because my husband is off on weekends. It would suck if we never got to see each other at all and never had much time together. Yes, I know I spend lots of times on here, but, a lot of times, its when either hes sleeping(which he normally sleeps later than me on the weekends)or hes somewhere else like cutting grass or going to get his hair cut or whatever. Sometimes he likes a certain movie or show I absolutely hate such as science fiction type of movies. If he is watching that, Ill go do something I like doing. I LOVE having weekends off.

And I don&apos;t have to work holidays, especially thanksgiving.

Well, thats wonderful. I was just pointing out at the chain restaurants these college students DO have to work most holidays such as Thanksgiving. That is why I posted those blog entries to show you Holidays dont exist for us type of attitude as what one of them said. Maybe you have off, but those college students dont at the chain restaurants. I am not saying all people that work in a restaurant go to college. I am just saying that they are usual college age(18-25)type of age range. We even went on CHRISTMAS day to Dennys in 2004, because it snowed here a bit and they closed most of the roads out, except for around the area. We were supposed to go to my parents house that year, but they closed the roads and bridges to get there. I remember the waitress, as usual, didnt remember 2 sides of syrup. We didnt tip ANY better than any other day, because it wasnt good service. If it was great service, I may have tipped more than 25% because it was the one day a year ALL RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE CLOSED I FEEL, but forgetting things when its the SAME PERSON taking the food to you, is NOT GOOD SERVICE. I DONT CARE WHAT DAMN DAY IT IS. Christmas is just another day. Ive worked on Christmas day at the donut shop 3 TIMES. One of those times I worked from 12p.m.-10p.m., which was 2 hours longer than the normal shift. If the service sucks, SO WHAT IF ITS CHRISTMAS. Ive worked it, so if they work it, they have their share of crap too. Do you honestly think I wanted to work on Christmas day? HELL NO! The people that were supposed to work with me in Christmas 2001, didnt show up, so I worked with my boss at the counter. I was the ONLY PERSON that showed up as far as the counter help went.

I NEVER have to work overtime, in fact, they are STRICT with the fact that we cannot work overtime.

MOST college students that are servers in chain restaurants DO. They wouldnt be bitching about staying after closing time in dru darbys blog(which this set of customer rules is ALL OVER THE INTERNET)and that other blog I posted, now would they?

 http://www.drudarby.com/other/tipping.htm 

 http://family2love.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-tip-and-why.html 

Your that pathetic&quot;I&apos;m content with having no money&quot;loser.

I have money. I didnt say I earned most of that money did I?

Because you are TOO LAZY to get a decent job.

NO, its just what I rather. Just like you rather work on your business instead. Well, Id rather spend time with my husband. Its not about being LAZY, its about I feel I DO have a decent job. I have paid holidays, paid vacation after a year, insurance(if I needed it, which Im under my husbands policy), etc. I RATHER be with my husband on the weekends. WHY work if you dont need the money? We ARENT poor or something. An average Friday, we spend at least $60-$80 dollars just on going out to eat. We do the same thing on Saturday. From time to time, well go bowling or go to the casino(which we limit it no more than $60)or something like that. Sometimes we have gone to play pool or to a movie. My point is, if we were that broke, then I would be working on the weekends or at least 1 day a weekend, but we have the money. Sure I could get a job as a waitress and make more money, but WHY? So I can have just one day off a week and not enjoy my life. If I was broke and living completely on my own, Id have no choice, but to work like that, WHY bother if I dont NEED TOO? What good would it do to have more money if you cant enjoy your life if you dont NEED it? Its not like we are struggling to pay bills. We have money to spend. Think about that on an average weekend we spend around $160-$200 or more dollars just in food and drinks and maybe over that if we go bowling or something like that. In Kenner, since Katrina, the bowling alley has raised the prices due to renovations from the storm. It was $51 for 2 hours of bowling and that doesnt count bowling shoes, which we bought our own bowling shoes, because we went a lot. It was cheaper and nicer to have our own bowling shoes. My point is, think about that in one weekend we could be spending over $200. Thats a lot of money. We have the money to do it, so we do it. I dont see ANYTHING wrong with having the type of job I have if we arent broke.

Oh, and TRUST ME, they forget your stuff on PURPOSE, they don&apos;t care about making an extra trip, they gotta come back anyways, but they&apos;ll go make a phone call while making that trip for your mayo. You see, to be to ruin YOUR meal is worth the extra effort and lost tip. But my god, TRUST ME, they do things like that on purpose ALL THE TIME.

Well, if they do, its still their loss. If they dont want to make the MOST MONEY possible, then if they do horrible, theyll end up LITERALLY PAYING to serve me by having to tip out on sales that we didnt tip on. So, in the end, is it really worth doing that to be in the hole? Maybe, youll say they think its worth it, but THEY are the real losers in it. We would have saved a lot of money they could have had, but chose to treat us like crap. So if they do poorly, I have requested NOT to have them ever again. It works. We get great service when I request servers that have done well and they KNOW well tip them well. They DO TRY THEIR BEST, because they KNOW WE TIP THEM WELL.

Most of the time lately though, I have asked for the condiments ahead of time and you know what? THEY DID GET THEM FOR ME AS I REQUESTED*BEFORE*MY MEAL. So, I am making my own destiny. If I want them to remember them, I make sure I get them BEFORE my meal arrives MOST of the time. From time to time, I dont ask, but MOST of the time I do.

As far as what you said about They don&apos;t care about making an extra trip, they gotta come back anyways, DOESNT MAKE SENSE. Think about it, WHY would they have to come back to the table at****ALL****if they remember the condiments with the meal when they bring it to me? YOU ARE AN IDIOT! THEY WOULDNT BE COMING BACK TO THE TABLE. Even if they came back after a couple of minutes to find out if everything was ok with our entrees , they wouldnt have to necessarily go all the way to the kitchen again, because they could be just going to greet another table thats next to us and then after they got their drink orders, came back to ask us if everything was ok. See, you are an IDIOT! THEY WOULDNT BE MAKING AN EXTRA TRIP AT ALL IF THEY REMEMBERED THE CONDIMENTS AS LONG AS I DIDNT REQUEST FOR THEM TO BRING THE CONDIMENTS BEFORE THE MEAL! They would have(1)TRIP YOU IDIOT!

jenaclaree
Lords,
Was the sandwich really good?

YES it was really delicious. I found it to be a bit better than the bbq chicken grill, because the chicken was seasoned and the bbq chicken grill wasnt seasoned. I havent order it again, because the next times I wanted bacon and a bigger sandwich with NO appetizer to share.

hacinta
I dont buy she had not a clue on the weight watchers menu fries were not included. Give me a break already. If per chance she did believe it, she sure shouldn&apos;t put it out on the world wide net. That is just down right stupid.

Its the GODS TRUTH! I READ ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES and I saw it DIDNT have ANY EXCLUSIONS OR EXCEPTIONS TO**ANY**OF THE SANDWICHES. I believed it. Just as I believed the coupon about the ANY po-boy sandwiches get a free small drink and a free small fry. I BELIEVED IT. I dont think about Well, ok its WeightWatchers, so it may not get fries. I read what it stated on the menu and TRULY BELIEVED ID RECEIVE FRIES, HONESTLY, I am NOT LYING.

Think it about. Just as you feel it was common sense doesnt mean EVERYONE sees things as COMMON SENSE. Ill give you an example. We went to Chevys Fresh Mex for the second time since 2001 to only get drinks and a dessert. It wasnt busy at all. In 2001, we got food and didnt like the food as well as I got a regular margarita, NOT a fancy one. Well, last weekend my husband and I got the specialty margaritas they had on the menu. They even had prices on the regular menu for them as well as the drink menu. We ordered. She comes back with them and I thought they were kind of big for the price, but we didnt think anything of it. We just thought we were getting EXACTLY what we ordered. During the time we were drinking, I saw this waitress sit sideways at a booth for about a minute or 2 doing nothing, because it was slow. They even had another employee say something to her, because it was kind of strange she was sitting on the job. Well, anyway, the check comes, we were billed $9.95 for both margaritas, even though on the*MENU*it stated mine was $6.75 and my husbands margarita was $5.95. We told her and she stated Yall got the bigger ones just like that. Even my husband mentioned We werent offered a bigger size. I told her were went off of what the menu stated. She didnt apologize at that time and got the manager. The manager fixed it. When she came to get the credit card to ring it up, she told me this was her first time ringing it up and that she had been there for 3 weeks. We were ONLY THERE less than an hour and altogether with the 2001 visit, not even 2 hours worth. She was saying how she was going by the picture. Now, do you think she had COMMON SENSE? Common sense would be that when she goes to McDonalds or Taco Bell or even Applebees or some place like that, she goes according to a*MENU*to find out*HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS*when she buys things for herself. This waitress looked to be in her mid 20s at least. She acted as if she didnt even realize there were prices for these drinks listed anywhere. Now, it wasnt her first day, this was 3 weeks she had as well as she had TIME TO*SIT*and rest on the job, so she had ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO DOUBLE CHECK OUR CHECK. I guess she guessed that we wanted bigger ones, but we did look, directly at the drink menu when we ordered. I understand maybe she didnt get trained to ask if we wanted a bigger size, but COME ONE NOW, when she buys things, she goes by a menu or price on the shelf, so WHATS THE DAMN DIFFERENCE when she charged us? In her mind, it*WASNT*COMMON SENSE to treat other people as she treats herself when she buys things off a menu. My main point is, whats common sense to one person is*NOT*common sense to the other person.

Just like when servers bring out a wrong entre that took the persons order. Its like DUH, bringing a steak entre out instead of a burger entre is COMMON SENSE to double check, but they dont. So DONT put me down about Give me a break, well look at all the situations that Ive posted on her. I think A LOT of situations were COMMON SENSE. Like the waitress that brought me a bowl of cinnamon apples on my baby back rib entre, even though SHE wrote down EVERYTHING, which I ordered extra fries INSTEAD of the cinnamon apples. I feel THAT was COMMON SENSE to make sure she was not taking the wrong things to the table. I didnt think about Weightwatchers being healthy at all. I just read what was on the menu. Just like the waitress didnt think about the prices were on the food menu and the drink menu for the margaritas we ordered at Chevys Fresh Mex. She didnt think about it the way MOST people do as well as the way she does when she orders food off a menu. I didnt think about WeightWatchers the way most people think about it. I think its common sense to go by a menu as ANYONE does when they order food, but she didnt see it that way. It looked like to me, she didnt even KNOW they had prices for these drinks. WHERE WAS SHE AT FOR FREAKIN 3 weeks? I guess UNDER A ROCK APPARENTLY. To me, that situation was pathetic. We werent even there for 2 hours with both times we were there and shes been there for 3 weeks. My point is though, as my mom even pointed out, everyones brain works differently. To you, it may be common sense about not getting fries, but I didnt. You may not think its common sense to make sure you bring the correct side dish to a customer that you took the order from. I think its COMMON SENSE.

Even my husband was pretty pissed about it, because we DIDNT order bigger margaritas, so even if we would have known(which we honestly DIDNT, because we NEVER ordered ANY specialty margaritas before from there or have even been in that restaurant since 2001), we should ONLY pay for what was ordered. Like one time, my mom got by mistake an omelet with ham instead of just cheese at Waffle House. Well, she decided to keep it, because she didnt want to wait longer to eat, because she was hungry. She did really want a cheese omelet. I dont think they charged her for it and they wouldnt have a right to, because she didnt order that. If the wait staff messed up, they definitely shouldnt charge you more. If anything, the manager should be offering to give something for the inconvenience.
My point is, SOMEONE MAY SEE SOMETHING AS COMMON SENSE AND ANOTHER PERSON MAY NOT.

This is how normal people handle situations, same as your guests.

MOST people would be VERY MAD over a major amount of almost $5 overcharge. Its NOT like its just $0.05. YOU ARE SO WRONG AND YOU KNOW IT! MOST PEOPLE GET VERY ANGRY WHEN THEY HAVE AN OVERCHARGE. Just like ilovecharlotte said:
Yes I have over charged before, but I have always corrected it. Does that matter, no it doesn&apos;t. Most are still upset. Even when given something free to make up for the problem. Yes approved by management.

 http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/9/3130.html#POST15256 

SEE MOST NORMAL PEOPLE*****DO*****GET UPSET. WHY CANT YOU ADMIT THAT**IS**THE TRUTH! $5 is a LOT TO OVERCHARGE SOMEONE as well as take their TIME up for that. It is truly RARE to have someone not care. I will say that most people dont care about cents, but they DO HOWEVER CARE ABOUT DOLLARS. Like they may not care if they are overcharged 50 cents, but if they are overcharged $3, theyd be pretty pissed about it.

Its a shame when a persons world is so small that they have to get irate over pennies.

WHY? MONEY IS MONEY. A few cents one time, then they dont fix the mistake, and you go back, it would have been another few pennies. Its still THEFT, because the server***CHOSE***NOT TO DOUBLE CHECK THE CHECK OR CHANGE THEY WERE HANDING TO THE CUSTOMER. Since there is a*CHOICE*to do it or not, its THEFT and***NOT***AN ACCIDENT. An accident is when you dont INTENTIONALLY NOT DOUBLE CHECK SOMETHING.

penelopmarie
Sometimes anorexia and bulimia go hand in hand.

I WILL NEVER THROW UP ON PURPOSE. I NEVER HAVE. NO, they DONT come hand and hand and I dont have anoerexia. I dont starve myself with nothing to eat at all and I dont do it for many days either. I binge eat without throwing up. In other words, I eat a lot on the weekend, but I dont eat NEARLY as much during the week to get back to my weight. If I had to throw up, Id rather not eat. I cant remember the last time I threw up, honestly. It was a time that I drank too much years ago. Yes, it was my fault I had drank too much, but you learn from your mistakes. I NEVER induced vomiting before, EVER! That is just soooo disgusting and gross.

The weight watchers menu was created for those people that do the weight watchers diet, and this diet consists of the damn points. so yes it is relevant because that is the whole point of the f*****weight watchers menu.

NO, ITS NOT! Those people that merriteri said that didnt order the sandwich for their weight, werent interested in the points more than likely. Do you HONESTLY THINK that ALL PEOPLE that order that sandwich*CARE*about the points or even BOTHER TO READ ABOUT THEM? I didnt. If someone orders the sandwich for the SAME reason that I did not want bacon and not to be charged for not getting bacon, they DONT CARE WHAT THE POINTS ARE! DONT YOU GET THIS? POINTS DONT MEAN ANYTHING TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT ORDER IT FOR REASONS OTHER THAN WATCHING THEIR WEIGHT OR THEIR HEALTH! So telling me about POINTS is stupid, because I ordered that sandwich NOT putting ANY TIME THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT DOESNT AFFECT ME, WHICH WOULD BE THE POINTS. Dont you get that SOME people arent bothered reading about the points that order this sandwich? The customers that merriteri talked about said they asked to have fries. Do you think they cared about points? MORE THAN LIKELY IF YOU ARE TRULY HONEST WITH YOURSELF, THEY DIDNT GIVE A RATS ASS ABOUT THE POINTS!

coorslite
No I didn&apos;t aplogize.

Look at the pot calling the kettle black. YOU ARE MEAN AND UNCARING! LOOK IN THE MIRROR. You SHOULD HAVE APOLOGIZED!

You wouldn&apos;t make it one day!

YES I WOULD. I WOULDNT MAKE***NEARLY***THE MISTAKES THAT ARE MADE THAT I GET WHEN IM A CUSTOMER AND YOU**KNOW**IT. I WOULDNT OVERCHARGE PEOPLE LIKE YOU, THATS FOR DAMN SURE, like you did for almost 2 whole weeks. That seems LAZY of you not to double check prices in that LENGTH OF TIME. Not to even apologize is just plain WRONG and you know it.

The manager probably wanted to hire you so that he could prove to you how**W**R**O**N**G**you are on so many levels!

WHAT LEVELS? I see that servers are overcharging me and they can PREVENT THIS situation from getting to the customer by DOUBLE CHECKING the check. I see that servers bring out wrong food or things that are missing. I see that servers forget things, but of course they were too damn lazy to write them down as they SHOULD have. I see that servers dont apologize for their mistakes as ANY DECENT HUMAN BEING SHOULD FOR***ANY***mistake, NO MATTER***HOW***SMALL. I see in ALL THESE SITUATIONS that***MISTAKES***WOULD*************NOT***********HAPPEN, because I KNOW WHAT I EXPERIENCE. YOU ARE SOOOO WRONG and you KNOW IT! The manager KNOWS I would do well, because he would know Id take the first step to write the order down and I would VERIFY that order***BEFORE***it would reach the customer as long as*I*would be taking the order out and not some food runner.

 I watched&quot;Rainman&quot;with Dustin Hoffman on TBS this morning. I&apos;d forgotten what a great movie that was.

Lords, you&apos;re an idiot. No matter how much you stomp your feet, rail at the world because your brain doesn&apos;t work the right way, or how&quot;spechul&quot;your momma says your are, you&apos;re still an idiot. If 99% of the world has common sense that works one way and your feeble brain works differently, the problem is yours, not the world&apos;s.

And when you&apos;re an idiot, it&apos;s better to just be quiet about it and hope nobody notices. Getting on the internet and screaming out your inadequacies in the real world just makes it funny at some point. Just shut up, sit in a corner, clip coupons and count your pennies.

Who&apos;s on first? Indeed.

 &quot;NO, ITS NOT! Those people that merriteri said that didnt order the sandwich for their weight, werent interested in the points more than likely. Do you HONESTLY THINK that ALL PEOPLE that order that sandwich*CARE*about the points or even BOTHER TO READ ABOUT THEM? I didnt. If someone orders the sandwich for the SAME reason that I did not want bacon and not to be charged for not getting bacon, they DONT CARE WHAT THE POINTS ARE! DONT YOU GET THIS? POINTS DONT MEAN ANYTHING TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT ORDER IT FOR REASONS OTHER THAN WATCHING THEIR WEIGHT OR THEIR HEALTH! So telling me about POINTS is stupid, because I ordered that sandwich NOT putting ANY TIME THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT DOESNT AFFECT ME, WHICH WOULD BE THE POINTS. Dont you get that SOME people arent bothered reading about the points that order this sandwich? The customers that merriteri talked about said they asked to have fries. Do you think they cared about points? MORE THAN LIKELY IF YOU ARE TRULY HONEST WITH YOURSELF, THEY DIDNT GIVE A RATS ASS ABOUT THE POINTS!&quot;


Let&apos;s get something straight here. I NEVER said that the people I knew asked to have fries. I stated that I knew people who had ordered the Tango Chicken sandwich and were not on Weight Watchers. Does that automatically mean that they asked to have fries? Uh no. Never said it. Don&apos;t attribute words to me that I didn&apos;t post.

My husband is one of the people who ordered the Tango Chicken sandwich during my rare Applebee&apos;s visits. He doesn&apos;t count points, because he is not on Weight Watchers, but he tries to eat healthy. He wouldn&apos;t be caught dead eating nasty fries from a corporate joint, therefore he didn&apos;t want fries with the meal, nor did he expect to get any. Do I need to expound on the dining experiences of the other people who ordered the Tango Chicken sandwich on my other visits to prove that none of them wanted or expected fries, even though they weren&apos;t counting points?

Also, my username is merryteri, not merriteri. If you&apos;re going to misquote me, can you please get the username correct?

Sorry, I thought you said that about fries. My mistake, sorry.

&quot;He doesn&apos;t count points.&quot;

My point was****HE DOESN&apos;T COUNT THE POINTS***was my point. He ordered that sandwich NOT CONSIDERING the&quot;POINTS&quot;at all when he ordered it and I didn&apos;t either is my point. Points are IRRELEVANT to ordering this sandwich thinking it wouldn&apos;t have fries with it, because he didn&apos;t count points and I didn&apos;t either when we ordered that sandwich.

You said this:&quot;At least we can count on Lords to be consistent in her ignorance....&quot;and then now you say this:&quot;Also, my username is merryteri, not merriteri. If you&apos;re going to misquote me, can you please get the username correct?&quot;

You DIDN&apos;T use my username correctly either, did you? Look in the mirror, before you tell me about my misspellings. Sorry I misspelled your name, but you didn&apos;t write&quot;lords_of_acid&quot;, you wrote&quot;Lords&quot;, which is NOT my whole username. You got technical, so will I.

 I dont know what you were talking about in your band camp 2001 story. What was or wasnt common sense? Something about looking at pictures and you husband wanted a bigger one ? Its like DUH lets go to a weight watchers meeting after Taco bell ? Did I get everything?
Do you really eat two orders of fries?
What do you mean I was wrong about the $5.00? What am I wrong about ? I made a mistake corrected it, all was good. You can write caps to me all you want, you are wrong about that one. Formerly Jammie

Sometimes anorexia and bulimia go hand in hand.

I WILL NEVER THROW UP ON PURPOSE. I NEVER HAVE. NO, they DONT come hand and hand and I dont have anorexia. I dont starve myself with nothing to eat at all and I dont do it for many days either. I binge eat without throwing up. In other words, I eat a lot on the weekend, but I dont eat NEARLY as much during the week to get back to my weight. If I had to throw up, Id rather not eat. I cant remember the last time I threw up, honestly. It was a time that I drank too much years ago. Yes, it was my fault I had drank too much, but you learn from your mistakes. I NEVER induced vomiting before, EVER! That is just soooo disgusting and gross.



like i said you moron...SOMETIMES they go hand in hand. go do you research and you&apos;ll see that some people agree that sometimes anorexia and bulimia go hand in hand. i should know right? i had anorexia and ok you might not starve(technically not eat anything), but eating 500 calories in a day is starving your body, counting calories to the extreme and trying to burn them all off is not healthy. i never did throw up either, because well i couldn&apos;t, but there are other types of bulimia like exercise bulimia or laxative abuse. it all ends up in the same...an eating disorder.

having to have to eat all the crap you eat perfectly because if you don&apos;t get it you&apos;ll throw a tantrum and your feast will be ruined is not normal either.

so sad....but so entertaining at the same time...

You have NO CLUE. Simple as that.

 Actually lords, I&apos;m a server in a&quot;crappy chain&quot;restaurant that you frequent, and according to you, I&apos;d probably be what you call a&quot;lazy college student&quot;. I evaluated myself over the weekend and have decided that you must, of course, be right.

I worked an 8 and a half hour shift at my full time job on Friday, because I am so lazy that my parents won&apos;t pay for college and thus I have to keep a full time job to do so, and for insurance benefits, because I&apos;m too lazy to actually pay for it on my own. Then, I went directly from there to my crappy serving job so I could take advantage of my laziness until the restaurant closed at 11:15 at night. You see, I love to close on Friday nights because I&apos;m so lazy, and that gives me a chance to sit on my as$ instead of running around my 5 table section to take care of my guests. I*LOVE*being able to screw everything up and make no money and screw people out of 3 cents here and there, whenever I get the chance. It&apos;s quit disappointing when I walk out of there with $130. I don&apos;t know how it happens. I mean, I&apos;m so lazy, and I work at a chain restaurant, and I&apos;m a college student who&apos;s overworked and underpaid. I just don&apos;t get it.

Then I got up on Saturday morning for my 8 and a half hour shift at my day job and did some homework. It&apos;s a good thing I have a desk job and that I&apos;m allowed to do that in my off time, because I&apos;m too lazy to do it at home. It&apos;s so odd, but for some reason, when I get home after work, I just can&apos;t bring myself to do homework until 2am, even though I should, and you&apos;ve helped me to see the errors of my ways. I&apos;m still trying to figure out my problems as I write this though, so hang with me. Once I left my day job, I again went straight to work at my serving job, where I was relieved to be able to slack off in the back and not read tickets before I ran them out to tables. I freaking ADORE being able to forget condiments and bring out coke instead of diet coke and regular coffee instead of decaf for people(I&apos;m too lazy to care about if they have diabetes or sugar problems; that&apos;s too much work for a silly college kid like me). Again, I worked until close even though I wasn&apos;t scheduled to because I had a party of 9 stay a bit later than they should have. Which of course ticked me off because I could have been spending that time being lazy instead of helping them. I don&apos;t know how I made any money.

I should have gone home to do more homework, but I was so lazy that I went to bed instead, not thinking of my professors in doing so. I mean, they probably would have advised me to stay up and get their homework done ahead of the game, but I really felt like I should sleep. I was probably wrong about that. I&apos;m not sure; you&apos;ll have to let me know.

I woke up on Sunday and went to my serving job. I BD(work the business decline)every Sunday, so I work from 11am to 9 pm, straight through, no breaks. You see, I&apos;m trying to pay for classes and rent and food and gas and all of that stuff, so even though I&apos;m really lazy, I have to work two jobs. I had a party of 20 at the very end of my shift, and even though I&apos;m lazy and only checked back on them about 7 times and got them all the refills they needed and cleared their plates(without asking, dangit!! I completely forgot that I should have asked them if they needed a refill while they were halfway through their meal; who knows, they might have wanted to be parched for the last half. I probably should have made sure they didn&apos;t want those empty plates on the table either. I was totally lazy and an idiot)and made sure everything was okay(okay enough for them not to realize how lazy I am), they gave me a round of applause. I don&apos;t know why. I was too lazy to thank them though; I just curtsied and laughed.

Then I did something terrible. I went to a movie and had a drink after work, and tipped the lazy bartender $1.50 on a $3.50 drink. It was half price, you see(kamikaze which is SOOOO much alcohol and normally $7), and instead of doing the right, money saving thing, I splurged and tipped her on the regular price of the drink instead of the&quot;coupon&quot;price. Which was lazy of me for giving her more than she deserved and for not taking the time to figure out 20% of $3.50(even though I know it&apos;s 70 cents, I just was too lazy to count that out), and honestly, I probably should have tipped her less because she poured two drinks at once, one for someone in line behind me. How dare she help someone else before she was finished with me. I can&apos;t believe how lazy she was; but then again, I was too lazy to say anything about it to her manager. Anyways, I did that instead of homework, so I had a pretty lazy day.

Now I&apos;m at work(I got her at 7am)until 3:30pm, and I should probably be doing homework because I have class at 4:45pm, but I guess I feel that this is more important. I&apos;m trying to assess how lazy I actually am. I don&apos;t have to work at my serving job during the week(which is pretty lazy of me, but I get to be at home with my dog and my roommates and I love that), so I have an entire 5 days to figure out how to be less lazy.

What would you suggest Lords?

&quot;Something about looking at pictures and you husband wanted a bigger one?&quot;

NO, we BOTH ordered the ones on the menu, that apparently were SMALLER. We had NO IDEA they had ANY other sizes. The*WAITRESS****ASSUMED***we wanted the bigger margaritas that weren&apos;t on the menu. THAT is what happened. We just ordered straight from the menu.

&quot;Do you really eat two orders of fries?&quot;

My mom and I had split the po-boy with the fries. I ended up being able to take the extra set of fries back to my dorm room in my little refrigerator. I DIDN&apos;T eat 2 sets of fries at once.

&quot;What do you mean I was wrong about the $5.00?&quot;

That it&apos;s RARE that&quot;NORMAL&quot;people don&apos;t get upset about dollars of overcharge. Now, cents, I will agree, most won&apos;t care, but dollars, especially 5 dollars or more is VERY significant. MOST people get MAD. I said that ilovecharlotte said that people get upset about her overcharges she did and I am willing to bet these overcharges were UNDER $5 even. YOU ARE VERY WRONG about that normal people don&apos;t get upset over dollars of overcharge. Especially if they are going somewhere after like a movie and are in a hurry.

&quot;I dont know what you were talking about in your band camp 2001 story.&quot;

Again, I NEVER BEEN IN BAND BEFORE.

 Obviously you didnt pay to close of attention, but I really cant complain becasue I kind of scan your posts, since they are all so similar.
This normal person wasnt upset, I alerted her to the situation and had already corrected it. She wasnt even aware of what had occurred. There was not wait on her part. This is how normal people react, you are wrong. Can I ask you does getting mad change the situation? Have it corrected with more speed? Make you feel superior? Get more free stuff? In the big scheme of things does an error that has already been corrected(even if it is for the large sum of $5.00)that important? Never mind I forgot who I was asking, not a normal person.

 &quot;NO, as I said before, the Chili&apos;s manager OFFERED me a job and even last week when we were there, he made conversation about me working for him. If I wanted that job, I would, but I don&apos;t want to work weekends. I want to have some days off like anyone else would.&quot;

I would bet my life that he was messing with you. In fact its probably a running joke at that store. There is actually a pretty good chance that this manager spits in your food himself every single time you go in there. You would without a doubt be the worst server ever. I can imagine you in my head getting triple sat, it would be too funny.

&quot;Well, if they do, its still their loss. If they dont want to make the MOST MONEY possible, then if they do horrible, theyll end up LITERALLY PAYING to serve me by having to tip out on sales that we didnt tip on. So, in the end, is it really worth doing that to be in the hole? Maybe, youll say they think its worth it, but THEY are the real losers in it. We would have saved a lot of money they could have had, but chose to treat us like crap. So if they do poorly, I have requested NOT to have them ever again. It works. We get great service when I request servers that have done well and they KNOW well tip them well. They DO TRY THEIR BEST, because they KNOW WE TIP THEM WELL.&quot;

Honestly, being stiffed would definitely be worth it if it meant that I never had to serve you again. Either because you never came back(preferable)or because you complained and said you didn&apos;t want to have me serve you again.

 Lords, honestly most people will not be upset about an overcharge as long as it is corrected. You are not a normal person.

And I have a question for you:

Do you have any sense of humor at all? In all of the posts of your&apos;s that I have read(skimmed)I don&apos;t think that I have ever detected one bit of humor. You must be a sad, miserable person. I am actually almost sorry for you. If I had to chose between being dead or being you I would chose death.

 Here&apos;s Applebee&apos;s official response to the dreaded fries controversy:

&quot;Dear teleburst(sub. for my real name),

Thank you for your recent email. I apologize for the confusion. The Weight Watchers menu is like a separate menu. Fries are not a part of that menu. You can make the substitution, but then the points are no longer valid. I will share your feedback with the Marketing Team for future consideration however.

If we can assist you further, please call 888-592-7753.


Sincerely,

Heidi Marshall
Guest Relations Coordinator
Ref # 489720

My feedback was that because one out of a million people wouldn&apos;t understand that the Weight Watcher&apos;s part of the menu was separate from the other sections, that they put a disclaimer in there.

So now you might understand why a server wouldn&apos;t automatically bring fries, nor should any server be expected to.

Feel free to substitute all you want, but don&apos;t expect the server to READ YOUR MIND.

Oh yeah, don&apos;t claim that you&quot;know the menu better than the server&quot;.

she kinds of forgets that we have been working there for years, or months(unless yu are new of course)and that we know the freaking menu and abbreviations by heart, including the descriptions and what comes with it and what you can&apos;t substitute things for. IF SHE DOESN&apos;T GET WHAT SHE WANTS, then we are wrong, LAZY, UNCARING, RUDE, AND SHE DESERVES....*FREEBIES*

i hate when moronic entitles people want to tell me how to do my job, or think that they can do it better than me.

&quot;This is how normal people react, you are wrong.&quot;

You are WRONG. Ilovecharlotte would NOT have stated that her customers got upset at overcharges. MOST PEOPLE DO GET UPSET OVER OVERCHARGES! She PROVES IT.

&quot;Can I ask you does getting mad change the situation? Have it corrected with more speed? Make you feel superior? Get more free stuff?&quot;

Actually, it gets things done RIGHT AWAY so we can leave faster. The time the waiter last year at Chili&apos;s rung our bill on the wrong table and overcharged us $21 and something cents, the manager gave us $25 in gift certificates and our $26 exact check got comped as well. He saw that my*HUSBAND*got pissed off more than I did even. We didn&apos;t do it for the&quot;Freebies&quot;, we did all that because we were pissed off. NO, it doesn&apos;t help blood pressure, but how can you be someone you aren&apos;t and not let it bother you? I can&apos;t be someone I&apos;m not.

teleburst
&quot;Fries are not a part of that menu.&quot;

They ARE, because of this statement:&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES.&quot;Read the title of the Weight Watcher&apos;s section:&quot;WeightWatcher&apos;s menu items from*APPLEBEE&apos;S*.&quot;

So that person that wrote to you LIED, because the menu is FROM(drumroll please)****APPLEBEE&apos;S***. That is written PROOF that it&apos;s APPLEBEE&apos;S OWNS THOSE ITEMS, NOT WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S.

See, FRIES ARE A PART OF THE APPLEBEE&apos;S MENU, which includes WeightWatcher&apos;s items. They cant have Menu Items From Applebees under the WeightWatchers section and claim they fries arent part of the menu, because they ARE considering the WeightWatchers section as Menu items FROM APPLEBEES, so ALL ITEMS ARE FROM APPLEBEES ON THE MENU. It IS PART of the ENTIRE MENU.

&quot;You can make the substitution, but then the points are no longer valid.&quot;

See, the point is that person that wrote this letter(supposedly)is looking at the&quot;POINTS&quot;aspect, NOT the fact that the menus states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;, because they DO! They COULDNT SAY ALL SANDWICHES with NO EXCEPTIONS to ANY of the sandwiches and not include them with ALL the sandwiches. The words speak for themselves. You DONT ASSUME that ALL SANDWICHES dont come with fries, because the menu states ALL OF THE SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES.

&quot;Oh yeah, don&apos;t claim that you&quot;know the menu better than the server&quot;.&quot;

YES I DO! THE MENU STATES&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;WITH NO EXCEPTIONS TO THAT SANDWICH AND IF THEY DON&apos;T ABIDE BY THAT, IT&apos;S FALSE ADVERTISING, PLAIN AND SIMPLE! As I stated before, Id bring out fries with it if I worked there, because its supposed to come with fries, plain and simple.

 http://www.goradio.net/123fargo/takeoutmenus/applebees.pdf#search=%22applebees%2 0menu%20%20pdf%22

LOOK RIGHT DIRECTLY UNDER THE WEIGHTWATCHERS part. These items are from APPLEBEES. So they are ALL part of the*SAME*MENU. If they wanted to make it separate, they should make a separate menu called WEIGHTWATCHERS in a separate menu, NOT on the SAME PAGE as the word SANDWICH in big bold letters. Just like a drink menu that only included drinks, desserts, and appetizers, but doesnt include the entrees. They should have a booklet just like the drink menu of WeightWatcher items if they dont want to reword they menu.

So now you might understand why a server wouldn&apos;t automatically bring fries, nor should any server be expected to.

NO, because the menu STATES ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES with NO EXCEPTIONS TO ANY OF THE SANDWICHES. Its part of the SAME MENU as what the menu states: MENU ITEMS FROM APPLEBEES. I DONT care what that person says, because the wording on the menu states ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES and that INCLUDES the tango chicken sandwich. The even have SANDWICH in the name of the entre.

Feel free to substitute all you want, but don&apos;t expect the server to READ YOUR MIND.

I expect them to READ THE MENU, NOT MY MIND. The MENU STATES ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES, IT HAS SANDWICHES ON TOP OF THE PAGE, IT HAS NO EXCLUSIONS OR EXCEPTIONS FOR SANDWICHES, AND IT HAS RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE WEIGHTWATCHERS WORD THE MENU ITEMS ARE FROM APPLEBEES. So that DEFINITELY*****{PROVES}*****that the server should bring fries without me having to tell the server ANYTHING about fries. This lady doesnt know the menu or knows what the hell shes talking about. They should either have a separate menu, state In this section or above entrees, or they should have Excluding the tango chicken sandwich. They didnt cover their butts, so that is WHY I ordered it without knowing I wouldnt receive fries. THEY ARE STUPID!

Actually, thats NOT ALWAYS TRUE. I had a waitress at Fox and Hound on January 14, 2006 and had her again on March 11, 2006. Meaning, about 2 months AT LEAST that she was there. That was when I was overcharged for the sandwich that was supposed to be according to the menu $6.99, on their LIMITED menu at the time(because of Katrina). I was charged $7.29. I presented the situation to her and she looked surprised. My point is,***SOME***servers that arent new even DONT KNOW THE MENU AND THE CUSTOMERS KNOW THE MENU BETTER THAN THE SERVERS. THATS SAD, it really is. I even knew the price better than the manager that was on duty. The manager was shocked herself. The manager thanked me for pointing it out and gave us half off the $6.99 price of the sandwich for our inconvenience. YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT SERVERS KNOW MORE. MAYBE YOU KNOW MORE, BUT MOST DONT!

 &quot;The even have SANDWICH in the name of the entre.&quot;

Sorry Loads, a&quot;sandwich&quot;is not an entree and you just called it an entree. The menu does not state that all entrees come with fries now does it? Everything under the weightwatchers menu are considered weightwatchers entrees. It may be a sandwich, but should never come with fries. It&apos;s a little thing called common sense and it&apos;s free. Now go out and get some before everyone else in New Orleans uses it up.

 Loads Of Fat,
You are such an idiot, you are the only one who can write that freaking much about something you are totally wrong about, and not just wrong, OBVIOUSLY WRONG.

Has it occured to you that you are just taking advantage of a technicality, not only did the cooks, the servers, the food runners, and now even applebees corporate office state that it does NOT come with fries, you continue to insist that the item DOES come with fries.

Has it occured that it&apos;s just a technicality? They didn&apos;t realize people were as dumb as you and would figure the weight watchers item would come with fries. Now they know, hopefully they&apos;ll fix it, that way the 1 in 10,000 who are dumb enough to think it comes with fries, will be able to fully understand now.

You ACTUALLY noticed and bitched about 0.30 on a sandwich? You are just the most ignorant, and just flat out retarded person I&apos;ve ever met. See, NORMAL, DECENT human beings assume it was an error when inputing it into the computer. And NO server checks the prices again to make sure it&apos;s the same as the menu, you are assinine to think they would. That doesn&apos;t mean YOU know more, you just happen to be a cheap loser who verifies every penny you spend, and noticed a freaking THIRTY CENT overcharge.

It, by your own admission, was a limited menu, meaning, they had to re-input prices and items, etc. into the computer, oh my freaking god, a human error, no way! Lets whine and cry and get upset.

&quot;&quot;&quot;He saw that my*HUSBAND*got pissed off more than I did even. We didn&apos;t do it for the&quot;Freebies&quot;, we did all that because we were pissed off. NO, it doesn&apos;t help blood pressure, but how can you be someone you aren&apos;t and not let it bother you? I can&apos;t be someone I&apos;m not.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

So not only are you BOTH trash, you are sick as well. And now you&apos;ve said it all, you got charged ACCIDENTLY on the wrong check, instead of just asking to have it fixed, you ACTUALLY got VERY PISSED by your own admission, you are NOT decent, good, human beings. Decent people are understanding of mistakes, happy they caught it when they did, and are happy to have it resolved. You are a sick, trashy, disgusting human being. You do NOTHING but make the world worst, you AND your husband should seriously drown yourselves together, the world would only get better.

 Loads, you and your fat ass husband actually let things like this raise your blood pressure?!? Get a f******life!!!

 The question needs to be asked again. Lords, do you consider yourself to be intelligent.

I&apos;m too tired of banging my head against the wall to deal with the stupidity of that post.

I&apos;ll say it again. Lords, you have the class, breeding and brain power of a farm animal.

 like you said she was there at least 2 months...i have been working for more than 2 years and i know all of the menu....including the prices...like you said you were eating there and katrina had just passed so things were not a 100%. sometimes the prices go up and they have to change all the menus in the restaurant and the prices in the computer. this is done by a human person. humans have an error margin, even when they quadruple check all the s***they need to check to keep your blood pressure in check. whine and complain all you want 99% of the people that deal with you secretly roll their eyes while they smile at you(in a fake way, screw with you, and make fun of you and call you names behind your back. so sad you have no real friends, and your man is either as crazy as you or just scared senseless because he did not know what he was getting into. was it an arranged marriage. did he pay your family for you or was it a done deal when you were born. the way you express yourself makes it seem that you come from some kind of weird religious cult in very far away rural areas of the united states.

&quot;Fries are not a part of that menu.&quot;

They ARE, because of this statement:&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES.&quot;Read the title of the Weight Watcher&apos;s section:&quot;WeightWatcher&apos;s menu items from*APPLEBEE&apos;S*.&quot;

So that person that wrote to you LIED, because the menu is FROM(drumroll please)****APPLEBEE&apos;S***. That is written PROOF that it&apos;s APPLEBEE&apos;S OWNS THOSE ITEMS, NOT WEIGHTWATCHER&apos;S.

See, FRIES ARE A PART OF THE APPLEBEE&apos;S MENU, which includes WeightWatcher&apos;s items. They cant have Menu Items From Applebees under the WeightWatchers section and claim they fries arent part of the menu, because they ARE considering the WeightWatchers section as Menu items FROM APPLEBEES, so ALL ITEMS ARE FROM APPLEBEES ON THE MENU. It IS PART of the ENTIRE MENU.

&quot;You can make the substitution, but then the points are no longer valid.&quot;

See, the point is that person that wrote this letter(supposedly)is looking at the&quot;POINTS&quot;aspect, NOT the fact that the menus states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;, because they DO!&quot;

First of all, you are an idiot.

Now that I&apos;ve got that out of the way, the person who wrote me back is from Applebee&apos;s corporate office. They just told you that Applebee&apos;s DOESN&apos;T OFFER FRIES AUTOMATICALLY WITH THE WW PORTION OF THE MENU. You are simply wrong, no matter how you try to twist things. What part of&quot;is like a separate menu&quot;don&apos;t you freaking understand?

You are simply wrong, and a bit out of your head to boot.

The good thing is, now that they know that there is at least one crazy person who needs things spelled out like a 4 year old, they&apos;ll probably change the wording of the menu just for you. I&apos;m sure that this will make you proud. But it won&apos;t change the fact that you&apos;re going to have to ask for a fries substitution in the future.

 Applebee&apos;s items can be changed from spec for certain conditions per franchise or store, but Applebee&apos;s cannot change anything under the Weight Watcher&apos;s menu because that part of the menu is controlled by Weight Watchers, it&apos;s all in the contract with them on portions and what goes into the meals. LOA you are a piece of absolute crap, my animals are smarter than you!

 You still haven&apos;t responded to my post, Lords. You just glossed right over it. I gave you a very specific example(which I thought would be to your liking, because your posts are so lengthy and drawn out)of what a typical weekend is like for me, and I asked you for suggestions on how to be less lazy.

So again, after reading through the summary of my lazy weekend, how should I make it better?

&quot;The menu does not state that all entrees come with fries now does it?&quot;

NO, but a&quot;SANDWICH&quot;is STILL a&quot;SANDWICH.&quot;I called it an&quot;ENTREE&quot;, because it&apos;s NOT an appetizer or a dessert. When you think about an&quot;ENTREE&quot;you think of what is NOT considered a dessert or an appetizer normally. THAT is WHY I called it an entree.

&quot;It may be a sandwich, but should never come with fries.&quot;

YES IT SHOULD, because the*****MENU*****states it does.

vitalryan
&quot;You are such an idiot, you are the only one who can write that freaking much about something you are totally wrong about, and not just wrong, OBVIOUSLY WRONG.&quot;

YOU ARE WRONG.

&quot;Has it occured to you that you are just taking advantage of a technicality, not only did the cooks, the servers, the food runners, and now even applebees corporate office state that it does NOT come with fries, you continue to insist that the item DOES come with fries.&quot;

At O&apos;Henry&apos;s Food and Spirits restaurant, the manager took advantage of the fact that the item I bought was labled&quot;APPETIZER&quot;on the menu even though I made it my&quot;ENTREE&quot;, she still said I couldn&apos;t use the $5 off 2 entrees, because mine WASN&apos;T an&quot;ENTREE.&quot;If the managers can be techincal, SO CAN CUSTOMERS.

&quot;You ACTUALLY noticed and bitched about 0.30 on a sandwich?&quot;

You DON&apos;T REALIZE***HOW MANY***times we&apos;ve been overcharged. We just got overcharged this weekend. I ordered a margarita that was listed on the menu as $6.75, which they were OUT of blue ceraco to make it, so I ordered the margarita listed on the menu that had $6.50. We had a newbie, so we left SOMETHING for his tip, which was about 9%. He overcharged us a quarter on something I didn&apos;t receive and he also charged us $0.50 for bbq sauce and they NEVER had before when I&apos;ve gotten things that didn&apos;t come with bbq sauce. See, EVERY CENT ADDS UP overtime.

&quot;NO server checks the prices again to make sure it&apos;s the same as the menu, you are assinine to think they would.&quot;

That&apos;s because they are LAZY ASSES. That&apos;s what I&apos;m talking about that customers know MORE about the menu than the workers. SEE WHAT I MEAN.

&quot;That doesn&apos;t mean YOU know more.&quot;

YES IT DOES! If I KNOW the menu has $6.99 and they don&apos;t, they PROVED THEY KNOW LESS. That was the VERY FIRST TIME my husband ordered that sandwich and I NEVER ordered it, so we NEVER knew what the price was before that day. It&apos;s ashame, about an hour we were in there and we KNEW THE PRICE BETTER THAN THE WAITRESS and she was there at LEAST 2 months worth.

&quot;You got charged ACCIDENTLY on the wrong check.&quot;

You DON&apos;T KNOW THAT FOR A FACT THAT IT WAS&quot;ACCIDENTAL&quot;and you KNOW IT! We had waited 10 minutes and the waiter came by, but NEVER picked up the credit card with the check. Finally, my husband went up to him to ask why it was taking so long. My husband was pretty pissed considering it wasn&apos;t very busy or anything. I think the waiter did it on purpose, because my husband told him something. If I can remember, my husband said something like this:&quot;Can you tell me why you haven&apos;t came to get our check yet?&quot;

I think he did on purpose. My husband just went right to a manager and we didn&apos;t see the waiter again, so no apology from the waiter.

&quot;Decent people are understanding of mistakes, happy they caught it when they did, and are happy to have it resolved.&quot;

I DON&apos;T KNOW***ANYONE***in their right mind that wants to not leave when they ask for the check, because most people have a LIFE AFTER they leave like go to a movie or to someone&apos;s house or shop. Do you HONESTLY THINK they want to sit there LONGER to get an overcharge fixed? I am PISSED when I find the overcharge to see that the SERVER was TOO DAMN LAZY to verify the check and to know, NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT TO GET THIS CRAP FIXED! People want to LEAVE when they ask for the check normally. People DON&apos;T WANT to have to WAIT LONGER to leave. Think about it, do you know lots of people that will wait to get back 4 cents? They will wait to get back $4 more than likely, but 4 cents is not worth their time to some people. My point is, the****TIME****is worth more to them, which is my point that they don&apos;t want to get delayed over an overcharge.

&quot;You just happen to be a cheap loser who verifies every penny you spend, and noticed a freaking THIRTY CENT overcharge.&quot;

List of HOW MANY TIMES we&apos;ve gotten overcharged tiny amounts.

$6.99 sandwich that was charged $7.39

The waiter that rung up our check
The $0.31 that I didn&apos;t get back from(2)$20 gift certificates, which the check was for $34.69, only received a $5 bill back, NO coin change.

Twice $0.04 for a Cucos Rita(margarita)that was $4.95 on the menu(ordered it as is), and I was charged $4.99.

The baby back ribs from Chili&apos;s that had the old menu given to me and charged me $14.49(my husband&apos;s menu), but my menu had $13.99.

The $1.99 house salad that was the price if you purchased an entre, which I did and she charged me $3.50 for a total of $1.51 overcharge.

$0.30+$0.31 $0.50+$0.04+$0.04+$ 0.75 = $1.94
If you add the over a dollar overcharge you get $1.94+$1.51 = $3.45

See how cents adds up if I NEVER said anything and paid the check with the overcharges. It EVENTUALLY ADDS UP TO DOLLARS. Also, the items that were wrong in the computer, the next time I&apos;d get that item, I&apos;d pay the 30 cents or 4 cents MORE each time, which would be ripping me off as well as OTHER CUSTOMERS.

I bet you never use coupons. Some are just a quarter or 50 cents off. Sometimes, you have to buy 3 to get off a buck for things like cereal. That&apos;s about $0.33 off a box. Cents ADD UP! I don&apos;t care if it was only 30 cents or the 4 cents, it&apos;s still THEFT and the CORRECT amount should be charged.

So maybe you want to throw your money away to thieves, but I DON&apos;T. If you let the owner of the restaurant keep on charging a price that isn&apos;t the price on the menu, go ahead, you&apos;re the STUPID one that won&apos;t have as much money saved to buy OTHER THINGS with. 30 cents, is still 30 cents. It&apos;s MORE than a quarter. I bet if you were short 30 cents to buy something in a store, the store cashier wouldn&apos;t let you slide. If they would, the cashier would be stealing from the store or the cashier would put their own 30 cents into the register. MONEY IS MONEY. I pick up pennies when I see them even. EVERY PENNY ADDS UP. You&apos;d be suprised at how much you can keep if you brought home each day 30 cents. 30 times 100 days is $30. So think about that. Think about that I would have been overcharged almost $2 for just&quot;CENTS&quot;overcharge overtime and you all talk about tip a buck or 2 for take out, which right there is almost $2. MONEY ADDS UP. I&apos;d rather have 50 cents for a tip, then have zero. MONEY IS MONEY. If you are TOO STUPID to use coupons or find overcharges, which is letting yourself be taken advantage of, then go ahead, be the STUPID ONE. I would have more money than you if let&apos;s say we had the exact same amount of money and bought the same things as well as left the same amount of tips, because I would make sure I wouldn&apos;t be overcharged and you wouldn&apos;t bother to get that 30 cents back. You&apos;re the STUPID ONE that would let them STEAL IT from you. What an IDIOT you are!

If you add the over a dollar overcharge you get $1.94+$1.51 = $3.45
 

You deserve it, but looking at the numbers, how long did this all take? You don&apos;t go out EVERY night and you don&apos;t get overcharged EVERY time you go out. Month? Three Months?

For the time wasted and the headaches caused by your crappy attitude, I&apos;d easily pay 3.45 a month.

AQpparently YOU don&apos;t even follow this last bit as you outline at the bottom of this post.

&quot;It may be a sandwich, but should never come with fries.&quot;

Nope. Applebee&apos;s corporate office has told you otherwise. Of course, they are nice enough to give you the opportunity to sub fries for the fruit salad, but YOU HAVE TO ASK. They aren&apos;t mind-readers you know.

vitalryan
&quot;You are such an idiot, you are the only one who can write that freaking much about something you are totally wrong about, and not just wrong, OBVIOUSLY WRONG.&quot;

YOU ARE WRONG&quot;.

Nope, it&apos;s you who&apos;s obviously wrong, and you can&apos;t even see it, even after Applebee&apos;s tells you what the rest of us have been telling you. YOUR inability to distinguish between sections of a menu is a problem I guess we&apos;re going to have to hear about ad nauseum.

&quot;Has it occured to you that you are just taking advantage of a technicality, not only did the cooks, the servers, the food runners, and now even applebees corporate office state that it does NOT come with fries, you continue to insist that the item DOES come with fries.&quot;

You should have asked first, shouldn&apos;t you? You KNEW that the menu labeled your dish as an appetizer(and you are so wound up about&quot;technicalities&quot;and&quot;menu wording&quot;). And now you&apos;ve admitted that you really DON&apos;T expect the&quot;menu wording&quot;to be followed to the letter. Of course, it&apos;s a rather inflexible manager that won&apos;t give a guest a one-time break on something as insignificant as that, although most people can certainly understand that a coupon designed to give $5 off the price of two entrees is to encourage the sales of ENTREES, not drinks or appetizers or desserts. At some point, I&apos;m sure that some managers are tired of people like you trying to scam their restaurant or rewrite special offers or play dumb.

 So let me get this straight. The manager at O&apos;Henrys should go against everything that you believe to be true. Going word for word on a coupon? Is that what I am reading or am I imagining it? Because all the hours you spent posting on the subject lords has just been cancelled out, by that statement. Isn&apos;t that what you believe with every fiber of your being? But wait... this decision is not in your behalf so it must be disputed or dismissed as a technicality? Let me further this by adding that totally different people at a totally different restaurant are getting the brunt of this. The poor people at crapplebees had nothing to do with the technicality. But since the manager at O&apos;Henrys was technical, you feel you must capitalize on all technicalities at all restaurants. Am I reading too much into this? Formerly Jammie

&quot;You deserve it, but looking at the numbers, how long did this all take?&quot;

You deserve to get overcharged then. You are mean.

It took a while.

$1.51 overcharge was Jan. 2005. The 2 $0.04 were in the spring of 2005. The $0.31 was in December 2004. The $0.30 was in March 2006. The 0.50 was in November or December of 2005. The $0.75 was just last Saturday Oct. 7, 2006.

&quot;For the time wasted and the headaches caused by your crappy attitude, I&apos;d easily pay 3.45 a month.&quot;

You all beg to get tipped for take-out, which would be at 10% normally a buck or 2 a check $20 or less, so MOST OF YOU ON THIS BOARD WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT $3.45. So this is BULL CRAP for you to say this!

penelopemarie
&quot;DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY THING I CAN DO WITH $3.45, so many things i can buy.&quot;

You BEG people to tip for take-out, so THIS IS BULL CRAP THAT YOU DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THAT $3.45. You&apos;d LOVE to have that from your take-out customers and YOU KNOW IT! That&apos;s an extra money that you CAN BUY something with. Hell you can get a couple of tacos at Taco Bell.

&quot;Nope. Applebee&apos;s corporate office has told you otherwise.&quot;

NO, they Applebee&apos;s corporate office doesn&apos;t KNOW**HOW TO WRITE A MENU***then if they are saying it doesn&apos;t come with fries, but it DOES include fries according to the menu.

&quot;And now you&apos;ve admitted that you really DON&apos;T expect the&quot;menu wording&quot;to be followed to the letter.&quot;

I KNEW they were going to say know, but there was a&quot;CHANCE&quot;they could have let us use it, because that time, we had bad service and were given a free dessert. I DIDN&apos;T EVER, EVER, EXPECT THEM TO ACCEPT IT, because the WORDING says it all. I can still try though. It didn&apos;t hurt to.

&quot;At some point, I&apos;m sure that some managers are tired of people like you trying to scam their restaurant or rewrite special offers or play dumb.&quot;

It&apos;s NOT A&quot;SCAM&quot;, it&apos;s a&quot;QUESTION&quot;and if the&quot;MANAGER&quot;chooses to overlook the item as an&quot;ENTREE&quot;, that is the&quot;MANAGER&apos;S&quot;RIGHT. IT&apos;S NOT A SCAM. A SCAM would be erasing the expiration date(which would be fraud)or altering the coupon itself with typed letter or writing. I DIDN&apos;T DO THOSE THINGS. I DIDN&apos;T SAME ANYONE, YOU IDIOT! YOU DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT A SCAM IS!

hacinta
&quot;The poor people at crapplebees had nothing to do with the technicality.&quot;

The OWNER does.

&quot;The manager at O&apos;Henrys should go against everything that you believe to be true.&quot;

ONLY if they want to. Coupons can be accepted or denied. ANY place had a RIGHT NOT to accept coupons, PERIOD.

I had a Papa John&apos;s internet coupon in 1997 and they REFUSED to accept it. I cancelled my order. If they can&apos;t abide by the coupons they have, they shouldn&apos;t advertise that you CAN use them. My point is, this is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than what the Applebee&apos;s corporate situation, because the if they accept your business, they HAVE to ABIDE by the ADVERTISED menu that states&quot;ALL SANDWICHES INCLUDE FRIES&quot;with no exclusions to ANY of the sandwiches. Just like when I use a coupon and they accept it. My point is, if they don&apos;t want to abide by the menu, they can either refuse my service or give me what comes with the item according to the&quot;WRITTEN PROOF.&quot;

At Lonestar Steakhouse last July, I had a situation with one of the manager&apos;s there and the coupon didn&apos;t have&quot;equal or lesser value&quot;on it. All the coupon had was after 4p.m. buy an entree and get an appetizer free. It also had&quot;YOU CHOOSE&quot;in BIG YELLOW BOLD LETTERS. It listed the appetizers on the coupon even. I WON the situation. Not only did the general manager give me both appetizers for free that I made as my meal, but I got a letter from the VICE PRESIDENT that stated free $50 dinner for my husband and I. The guy I talked to on the phone at the Baton Rouge area Lonestar that called back about my letter from the internet before I received that letter from the vice president, said I was RIGHT. That I could choose ANY APPETIZER I WANTED for the coupon. SEE, how the&quot;WORDING&quot;means EVERYTHING. That the&quot;MANAGER&quot;can say one thing, but that DOESN&apos;T MAKE IT RIGHT OR WRONG. The entire fight was about $6.99 amarillo cheese fries and $9.99 half rack of ribs with no sides. Those were the 2 appetizers the fight was about. I WON! SO HA HA! I got almost $60 for technicalities. See, I would have gotten the $9.99 one anyway if they would have abided by the EXACT, EXACT WORDING and COVERED THEIR BUTTS LIKE BENNIGAN&apos;S DOES. They have&quot;buy a burger and get one of**EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE**FREE. I WON! THE WORDING IS THE KEY TO****PROVING****THE POINT! The bitch manager that talked to me right after this happened said&quot;It&apos;s Lonestar&apos;s policy to take the lesser one&quot;, but DIDN&apos;T HAVE*****ANY*****WRITTEN****PROOF! WHAT A DUMBASS!

Wrong, if I had an a-hole of a customer, I&apos;d rather boot them out of the restaurant than get any type of tip. It&apos;s NOT all about the money. I like working and I have a good time taking care of customers and working with my co-workers. Money is icing on the cake.

Your situation is reverse. Do I pay a little extra or deal with all of the headaches on getting it fixed. It&apos;s your right to dispute an overcharge, but it doesn&apos;t get fixed with a snap of the fingers. Proceedure requires the manager to get involved and it can take time. So deal with the outcome if a mistake happens. Tip or don&apos;t tip. Doesn&apos;t matter to me, your the ass.

&quot;DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY THING I CAN DO WITH $3.45, so many things i can buy.&quot;

You BEG people to tip for take-out, so THIS IS BULL CRAP THAT YOU DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THAT $3.45. You&apos;d LOVE to have that from your take-out customers and YOU KNOW IT! That&apos;s an extra money that you CAN BUY something with. Hell you can get a couple of tacos at Taco Bell.

first of all if i get overcharged i am still tipping. if i get overcharged more than $5 then i&apos;ll POLITELY ask why is their a difference in price...it really is not that big of a deal. i DO NOT BEG people for their tips. i try to explain that we deserve tips because we are still giving you a service. if you don&apos;t want to tip fine, then i&apos;ll see just how much care i&apos;ll put in your order. i don&apos;t beg anyone for money, i really don&apos;t need a couple of bucks as much as you obviously need them.

oh and i don&apos;t eat taco bell, or fast food for that matter, so i nope i can&apos;t use my $3.45 to buy anything decent. i can&apos;t even buy a fruit salad with $3.45, that&apos;s right i like to eat healthy and decent food, i don&apos;t like to polute my body with the crappy, full of grease, salt, and sugar, food you LIVE to eat.


NO, they Applebee&apos;s corporate office doesn&apos;t KNOW**HOW TO WRITE A MENU***then if they are saying it doesn&apos;t come with fries, but it DOES include fries according to the menu.


WOW, then i wonder who writes the menu for applebees if it is not corporate office...you really have the IQ of a rock...

 I work at Lonestar. We hate people like you. HATE THEM. Which is why corporate has done away with&quot;koopins&quot;all together. We once had a woman(probably you, visiting Nebraska, you whore)come in and order a glass of water and a half rack of ribs. She had CUT OFF the expiration date and the part of the coupon that said she had to order an entree.

Seriously.

Why the hell do people think they are entitled to something for free?! I don&apos;t go into the a clothing store and say&quot;hmmmm, I really want this shirt, but I don&apos;t want to pay for it. Now where was that coupon...&quot;

Jesus.

 kleyjulele, welcome to the human race.

Going to ramble:

There are people who support the system. They work, clean, pay taxes, support others; family, friends, co-workers, etc. They don&apos;t take advantage of anything and they understand mistakes that can happen in any place they visit.

There are people who steal; violent theft, white collar theft and people who take advantage of a system in place to support and promote business.

We all know violent theft; robbing, mugging, etc.

White collar is office theft, money laundering, identity theft, etc.

Taking advantage of systems/programs are done by people who feel cheated in life. The people who get charged a service fee in the checking will call and complain, but a deposit mistake and they think the money is theirs, so they go and spend it knowing the didn&apos;t make the deposit. Restaurant sales/programs being taken advantage of, like Lords and other people who want something free for a technicality. People who know they can get a discount of something free if the item is priced wrong, etc.

These are to promote business, but in most cases it can hurt if the program is not done right, because let&apos;s all face it; there is evil in the world and because of that evil, we have to suffer for it.

Once again, you&apos;re simply wrong. 99.99999% of people understand how to read a menu. They understand how statements within a section apply to that section. They understand the concept of a diet menu. They understand that when it says that you can get a discount when you order two&quot;Favorites&quot;, it applies only to the&quot;Favorites&quot;listed in that section, not additionally to the previous&quot;Favorites&quot;section. Most people understand these things. But now you know DEFINITELY what the fries statement applies to officially. So now, you can&apos;t claim to expect them to be brought automatically and that the server is wrong for serving it EXACTLY as described AND pictured. No more excuses. Now you actually have to ASK for the substitution and stop using it as an excuse to save money on a tip.

&quot;And now you&apos;ve admitted that you really DON&apos;T expect the&quot;menu wording&quot;to be followed to the letter.&quot;

It DOES hurt. You know what it hurts? Your self-respect and credibiility. You were willing to scam them out of money, all the while complaining about the cost of refills.

If you weren&apos;t expecting them to honor it, then why use it as any type of example of anything? If I were to say that I demanded a $1000 tip from my last table, and they said no, would that say anything about anything, other than the fact that I was strongarming guests?

As others have pointed out, all it did was show that you&apos;re a flaming hypocrite.

You lose.

Again.

 I don&apos;t think I can take LOA seriously anymore. Every post makes it look more and more like someone is just playing a big joke. And I mean that seriously. NO ONE could possibly be that retarded. NO ONE is possibly cheap enough and whiney enough to try and get everything free at every restaurant they visit.

Oh, and I&apos;d take that $3.45 all at once, that would be a decent overcharge... BUT... there are two sides to that story, as they say, time is money, and dealing with a FOUR CENT overcharge, whether it adds up or not, is NOT worth the time involved.

You see, LOA clearly would complain about a 4 cent overcharge so the corporate pansy restaurants would give LOA a free meal, thus, saving even more money.

Anyone who would do stuff like that is a piece of trash, and quite unbelievable.

There is NO WAY LOA is a real person, no one is THAT bad.

 Depends on the service I receive, the amount of tip would vary. And ofcourse it is about the restaurant I&apos;m getting the service from. fast food or casual restaurant matters to me.

 ryan, after all of these posts she so much as admitted she was wrong. The manager could have if he wanted to. So this means everything that is written is not done so in stone. Unless it benefits the almighty ranch sucking, menu monoritoring, penny counting scammer.
So crapplebees doesn&apos;t know how it write a menu? Its their frickin menu, how can anyone else say its wrong? I am ending this foolishness right here and now. The cuntflap has been beaten. Formerly Jammie

I DO NOT BEG people for their tips.

Is this your blog? If it is, you are asking people to and I quote: please TIP, which is BEGGING customers to tip on this blog for take-out. Maybe you arent begging your customers on the phone or in person, but you are begging on this blog.

 http://thecustomerisnotalwaysright.blogspot.com/2006/04/please-tip-your-take-out -person.html 

If i have a regular tipper i am going to take care of him first.

See how you are UNFAIR to people. Its NOT OK to let someone CUT in front of someone else, no matter if they tip or not. When I worked at the donut shop, I DIDNT put a regular customer that always tipped FIRST if they werent FIRST. I went***IN ORDER***out of COMMON DECENCY. All you care about is the MONEY you make. I cared about peoples FEELINGS and had CONSIDERATION for people. If drive-thru came first, THEY would be first. I wouldnt serve someone inside that normally tipped and ignored drive-thru until after. Thats NOT NICE. Thats WRONG! WHY DO YOU DO THE SAME TYPE OF THING? YOU KNOW ITS MORALLY WRONG!

kleykulele
She had CUT OFF the expiration date and the part of the coupon that said she had to order an entree.

By cutting off things on a coupon is FRAUD. I NEVER DID THAT, EVER! You CANT compare me with her. She did something ILLEGAL, I didnt.

Why the hell do people think they are entitled to something for free?

If there is a major mistake like a wrong entre or an overcharge, the manager SHOULD give you SOMETHING to MAKE-UP for it, even its just a coke. They shouldnt just not give you ANYTHING for your time that was lost. Thats just wrong if they dont. I would rather things go perfect and pay for everything personally.

vozveratu
Restaurant sales/programs being taken advantage of, like Lords and other people who want something free for a technicality.

I DIDNT want something free for a technicality. I wanted what the menu stated the food came with. The workers DIDNT abide by the menu.

People who know they can get a discount of something free if the item is priced wrong, etc.

Honestly, please believe me, HONESTLY, Id MUCH RATHER have a correct check than to have to go through an overcharge just to get a freebie, which most of the times I got overcharged, we didnt get ANYTHING at ALL for the overcharges. Like the almost $11 at Applebees when the waiter rung up the wrong table on my credit card. The manager didnt offer us ANYTHING, nor would I ask such a thing. I do think its appropriate to give something free for a customers trouble of getting it fixed though. You dont get Id rather NOT go though bad service and everything go perfectly. Its NOT WORTH not having to pay for something. It REALLY ISNT.

teleburst
Once again, you&apos;re simply wrong. 99.99999% of people understand how to read a menu. They understand how statements within a section apply to that section.

I know what the menu states.***ALL SANDWICHES, BURGERS, AND ROLLUPS(EXCEPT STEAK FAJITA ROLLUP)INCLUDE FRIES***THAT IS ALL IT STATES. NOTHING ABOUT DIFFERENT SECTIONS IT ONLY PERTAINS TO.

They understand that when it says that you can get a discount when you order two&quot;Favorites&quot;, it applies only to the&quot;Favorites&quot;listed in that section, not additionally to the previous&quot;Favorites&quot;section.

For one thing, the first section of favorites is called NEIGHBORHOOD FAVORITES, NOT JUST FAVORITES like the second section does. The word NEIGHBORHOOD is what makes that area DIFFERENT. Its like saying a section for instance has the word Grillers and another section would have HOT Grillers. See the DIFFERENCE in the fact, yes they are both GRILLERS, but they have a DIFFERENT NAME IN FRONT OF THEM TO MAKE THEM DIFFERENT GRILLERS. This is the SAME thing as the Favorites sections.

You can&apos;t claim to expect them to be brought automatically and that the server is wrong for serving it EXACTLY as described AND pictured.

As I stated before, THEY DONT PUT CHERRY COKE IN THE PICTURE ON AN AD, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ON SALE LIKE ALL THE OTHER VARIETY OF COKES. WHO CARES WHAT IN THE PICTURE. Its what the ad states that matters. The sandwiches are supposed to include fries.

 http://weeklyad.target.com/target/listing_detail.asp?ListingID=-2094332006&amp;Store ID=2395936&amp;SearchText=coke&amp;redirected=Y 

See, they ONLY PICTURE COKE AND DIET COKE. If you actually go there, the other flavors of coke ARE ON SALE AS WELL. PICTURES DONT TELL YOU EVERYTHING. They just show SOME of the items, NOT ALL. If they did, theyd take up the whole menu or ad.

 http://cvs.shoplocal.com/CVS/Default.aspx?action=browsepagesingle&amp;storeid=241661 6&amp;rapid=319861&amp;pagenumber=16 

 http://cvs.shoplocal.com/CVS/Default.aspx?action=browsepagedetail&amp;storeid=241661 6&amp;rapid=319861&amp;pagenumber=16&amp;listingid=-2094309754 

See the picture with the Doritos. The picture ONLY shows those 2 kinds, but states 10-13 oz., assorted types.

Do you see what I mean by a PICTURE DOESNT SHOW EVERYTHING?

Now you actually have to ASK for the substitution and stop using it as an excuse to save money on a tip.

Its NOT an excuse to save money on the tip. Dont you get, I DIDNT DO THIS ON PURPOSE? I DIDNT KNOW FOOD RUNNER WOULDNT BRING OUT FRIES. Id RATHER EVERYTHING GO 100% PERFECT THAN TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. The server is supposed to bring a side of fries with ALL SANDWICHES. That sandwich includes the fruit as well as fries according to the menu.

You were willing to scam them out of money.

NO, the manager was, because that day we had bad service and bought a gift card. We bought a gift card BEFORE we were seated, because they had a promotion you get a free $15 gift card if you buy $50 of gift card worth around Christmas time as a lot of restaurants do around here. Anyway, the bitch manager said something like this: Next time you cant use it on the same day you purchased it, because you had bad service this time, you can use it this time. See, the gift card had NOTHING WRITTEN ON IT about that you couldnt use it the day you purchased it. Ive used gift cards at Chilis the SAME DAY I bought it with NO PROBLEM. THAT MANAGER WAS TRYING TO SCAM US, NOT US SCAMMING THEM. Youve got it WRONG! We should be able to use that as payment just as any other type of payment that they normal accept(which most restaurants dont accept checks), considering its from that restaurant. We knew we went there a lot and we figured why not get $15 free, because we were going there a lot ANYWAY, so WHY NOT? Thats why we had Chilis gift cards as well. Anyway, the manager would have made us have to use it another time, which would have been WRONG of her. See, she was trying to make us go another time, without ANY WRITTEN PROOF that we wouldnt have been able to use it the same day I purchased it. If they want that rule, HAVING IN WRITING, just like Bennigans has Equal or lesser value for their burger coupons. Just like Lonestar Steakhouse and that manager that said: Its Lonestars policy to take the lesser one. She was just telling me WORDS to SCAM ME out of what the coupon stated. She didnt have physical PROOF. When you go into a court room, you need PROOF you paid something lets say, like a receipt would be PROOF. These bitch managers at both these restaurants were trying to scam US and DIDNT HAVE PROOF. They were trying to get over customers and I wasnt about to let that happen. If the manager at OHenrys Food and Spirit wouldnt have let us use it, I would have wrote the corporate office for them NOT having it written on the gift card that you cant use it the day you purchased it. It would NOT be to get something for FREE, it would be to NOT have this happen again. The corporate office would agree with me, because theres NO PROOF of what she said, just as Lonestar didnt have their proof, SAME THING.

If you weren&apos;t expecting them to honor it, then why use it as any type of example of anything?

I explained that already. If the managers can be technical with WORDING such as entre vs. appetizer, then so can the CUSTOMERS. Theres NO REASON CUSTOMERS CANT GO WORD FOR WORD WITH THE MENU AND THE COUPONS, IF THEY CAN DO IT.

As others have pointed out, all it did was show that you&apos;re a flaming hypocrite.

HOW?

Whether it adds up or not, is NOT worth the time involved.

Thats YOUR OPINION. I DONT WANT PEOPLE TO STEAL FROM ME, WHETHER ITS ONE CENT OR 1 DOLLAR, ITS STILL MY MONEY AND I WANT IT BACK!

You see, LOA clearly would complain about a 4 cent overcharge so the corporate pansy restaurants would give LOA a free meal, thus, saving even more money.

I NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FREE FROM CUCOS, which is the place that overcharged me twice for the Cucos rita. I did, however, have a free pizza from dominos over 4 cents, which I told the lady that called about my situation I wrote on the internet about that I didnt want them to send anything. I HONESTLY DID! I complained about it, because I didnt want it to happen again. That situation I explained here before when I ordered 1 pizza with a competitors coupon(which they state they take competitors coupons as stated)for $8.99 with 2 orders of breadsticks and 1 order of cheesybread. The sticks and bread were $3.99 a piece. Well, the guy cashier I called the order into, rounded everything up to a penny. My subtotal was supposed to be $20.96 and he charged me $21 subtotal. Everyone that has a competitors coupon will be overcharged if I didnt take some action. I didnt want it to happen again to us or anyone else, so I reported it. I DIDNT DO IT TO GET THE DAMN FREE PIZZA. I did it, because I want to be able to pay the EXACT CORRECT AMOUNT when I go. Do you think I want to go through that crap? HELL NO! For a free pizza, its NOT WORTH IT. I want to be charged the CORRECT AMOUNT.

Ryan, after all of these posts she so much as admitted she was wrong.

NO, Im RIGHT.

So this means everything that is written is not done so in stone.

That doesnt mean its right when they do override something such as if the manager would have let me use that $5 off 2 entrees coupon with me ordering an appetizer. Just because someone overrides something, doesnt make it right to do that. Just like stars get a slap on the wrist for things like winona rider had. Does that make it right that she didnt get punished much for her theft? People override things, but it doesnt make it right. Just like someone that knows a judge and can get traffic tickets off someones record. The traffic laws are written, but some people do what they want to do anyway. If they do have word for word on something that is what should be gone by. There SHOULDNT be ANY OVERRIDING DONE. Like the manager that didnt take my coupon at OHenrys SHOULDNT HAVE. She did the right thing there, but did the wrong thing when she told us that we couldnt buy it the same day purchased without written proof.

Do you give the grocery checker the same amount of grief when it&apos;s time to pay w/your food stamps?

I DONT USE FOOD STAMPS!

Once again, you&apos;re simply wrong. 99.99999% of people understand how to read a menu. They understand how statements within a section apply to that section.

I know what the menu states.***ALL SANDWICHES, BURGERS, AND ROLLUPS(EXCEPT STEAK FAJITA ROLLUP)INCLUDE FRIES***THAT IS ALL IT STATES. NOTHING ABOUT DIFFERENT SECTIONS IT ONLY PERTAINS TO&quot;.

It shouldn&apos;t have to, especially when you consider the heading&quot;Weight Watcher&apos;s&quot;.

They understand that when it says that you can get a discount when you order two&quot;Favorites&quot;, it applies only to the&quot;Favorites&quot;listed in that section, not additionally to the previous&quot;Favorites&quot;section.

For one thing, the first section of favorites is called NEIGHBORHOOD FAVORITES, NOT JUST FAVORITES like the second section does. The word NEIGHBORHOOD is what makes that area DIFFERENT&quot;.

Hmmmm, exactly like&quot;Sandwiches, Rollups, etc.&quot;and&quot;Weight Watchers&quot;.

If I wanted to be like you, I&apos;d say that the word&quot;Favorites&quot;appears in both sections and so the comment applies to both sections, especially since one of the dishes is in BOTH sections. But even*I&apos;m*not willing to even pretend to go there.

&quot;Now you actually have to ASK for the substitution and stop using it as an excuse to save money on a tip.

Its NOT an excuse to save money on the tip. Dont you get, I DIDNT DO THIS ON PURPOSE? I DIDNT KNOW FOOD RUNNER WOULDNT BRING OUT FRIES. Id RATHER EVERYTHING GO 100% PERFECT THAN TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. The server is supposed to bring a side of fries with ALL SANDWICHES. That sandwich includes the fruit as well as fries according to the menu&quot;.

You&apos;re wrong, and Applebee&apos;s has officially told you so. NONE of the Weight Watcher&apos;s meals&quot;come with fries&quot;. This would be contrary to exact number of points specified, it would be against the description,*and*it would be against the picture of the dish that&apos;s supposed to be delivered to you. Feel free to ask for a substitution of fires for fruit salad since Applebee&apos;s is nice enough to offer it, even though they don&apos;t have to.

&quot;If you weren&apos;t expecting them to honor it, then why use it as any type of example of anything?

I explained that already. If the managers can be technical with WORDING such as entre vs. appetizer, then so can the CUSTOMERS. Theres NO REASON CUSTOMERS CANT GO WORD FOR WORD WITH THE MENU AND THE COUPONS, IF THEY CAN DO IT.

HOW&quot;?

I can&apos;t believe that you&apos;re asking this questi...oh wait, I can, because you&apos;re a 40 watt bulb in a 100 watt socket.

You are a hypocrite because you castigate a manager for being&quot;literal&quot;while demanding literalness when it benefits YOU.

I DO NOT BEG people for their tips.

Is this your blog? If it is, you are asking people to and I quote: please TIP, which is BEGGING customers to tip on this blog for take-out. Maybe you arent begging your customers on the phone or in person, but you are begging on this blog.

 http://thecustomerisnotalwaysright.blogspot.com/2006/04/please-tip-your-take-out -person.html

okay let me just finish laughing......

*sigh*listen you retarded idiot, that is the title of the blog...it is a title that informs what the blog is about. if you read it you can see that i am not begging anyone to tip, i am just stating the difference in service a non tipping moron gets versus what a tipping customer gets. do you beg everytime you say please can i have 6 sides of ranch filled up to the rim....or don&apos;t you even have the manners to say please. i just love the way you just copy and paste the things that fit into your fantasy world of theories, and you never answer the real things that, well you have no answer for. you just keep saying the same crap over and over...the menu said, in 2004 i was overcharged, i want my ranch, i want my mayo, i don&apos;t have an eating disorder, i, i , i.

 I don&apos;t tip for takeout. They aren&apos;t providing a service that a fast food place doesn&apos;t provide. They aren&apos;t refilling glasses, clearing my table, or anything like that. I am happy to pay for what I get. What they do behind the scenes isn&apos;t really important to me. If they do a lot of work to get the service done, I pay for the service. If they do a little work to get the exact same service done, I pay the same amount.

If a restaurant chooses to provide two different services(full service and fast food service), it&apos;s expected that they&apos;ll get paid different amounts for different services.

 It&apos;s fast food service. Fast food service is what I, as a customer, get. They hand me stuff. People who simply hand me stuff don&apos;t get tipped. It doesn&apos;t matter whether they&apos;re putting diamonds in a bag or dirt. The service that I get is the same.

Fast food service doesn&apos;t get tips.

 That&apos;s cool, genise. Come on in to my place and order some&quot;fast food&quot;. I&apos;ll just hand you some raw product without any condiments or to go silverware or no napkins or even a box or bag, and then you could be justified for not tipping me.

 Penelopemarie and bistroy, you&apos;re not paying attention to what I said.

Penelopemarie, fast food restaurants hand me food. They don&apos;t get tipped. Take out is exactly the same in terms of the service I get.

Bistroy, you&apos;re not paying attention to what I said. That&apos;s frustrating because I already explicitly argued that it doesn&apos;t matter what goes in the bag(or box)when we&apos;re talking about*service*.(&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter whether they&apos;re putting diamonds in a bag or dirt.&quot;)

Bistroy, the food gets cooked no matter what type of restaurant it is. The server doesn&apos;t get tipped simply because the cook did his job. Servers get tipped for providing a service above some basic level of simply handing over a good. That basic level is fast food. Fast food restaurants give condiments without tips. Why should take out places get tipped for doing the exact same thing? They shouldn&apos;t. Both places are simply handing me condiments and plastic silverware. Taco Bell employees stuff burritos in a bag and toss in condiments and plastic utensils. They receive no tip. There&apos;s no reason why customers should pay for that exact same service at a higher class restaurant that offers the exact same service. It doesn&apos;t matter whether they&apos;re stuffing a $3 burrito or a $9 burrito in a bag. Either way, they&apos;re doing the same service for me. It doesn&apos;t matter whether they&apos;re stuffing $0.05 salsa or $0.25 cent salsa in a bag for me. They&apos;re doing the same service for me.

Penelopemarie says,&quot;if you think that is not worth paying me for the service i give you then you can a)come pack it yourself, b)cook at home, or c)go to a fast food not a restaurant.&quot;

A - I don&apos;t have to pack it myself at a fast food restaurant.

B - Who cooks it doesn&apos;t matter. Servers aren&apos;t cooking the food. The cooks will cook the food no matter what happens with tips.

C - Take out offers the same service as fast food. Take out is nothing more than more expensive fast food. They simply stuff more expensive items in the bag. That&apos;s the whole point. The server does nothing for me that a fast food worker doesn&apos;t do.

If you people are frustrated, that&apos;s fine. But your anger is misplaced. You should be angry at your restaurant for turning you into part-time fast food workers. But it&apos;s not the customer&apos;s fault that part of your job&apos;s service requirements were downgraded in terms of what the customer gets.

 So do you really enjoy that burrito from Taco Bell as much as you enjoy your potato to have all of the right toppings from a steak house? Do you enjoy it as much as actually having all of the right condiments? Someone that works in a real restaurant does more work than just&quot;handing it to you.&quot;Get a job in the industry before you start talking smack. You&apos;re just as bad as Loads over there, except you don&apos;t capatilize or call us idiots. Get a life. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

 It doesn&apos;t matter how much I enjoy the burrito. The server didn&apos;t make it. And even the people at Wendy&apos;s get the baked potato toppings right without a tip.

It doesn&apos;t matter how much work the servers do behind the scenes. What matters is what the customer gets. You don&apos;t get points for effort; you get paid for results. In this case, that&apos;s service the customer receives.

I don&apos;t know why you can&apos;t have a civil conversation. What&apos;s with telling me to&quot;Get a life&quot;? I don&apos;t know why you have to turn this toward personal attacks.

Though it doesn&apos;t really matter, I*have*had service jobs. In the last 10 years I&apos;ve been a bellhop, I&apos;ve been a waitress, I&apos;ve worked the frontline and the backline at Burger King, and I&apos;ve been a courier driver.

I think the easy way to look at the issue is to ask this: What do take-out workers provide the customer in terms of actual service that fast food workers don&apos;t? I can&apos;t think of anything. They both assemble an order and send the customer on his or her way.

 genise, I can tell you from experience that doing take out at a casual dining place like Outback is much more work and much harder than the drive through window at McDonalds and there is no way that anybody halfway competent would do it if no tips were received. I can also tell you that if you don&apos;t tip I don&apos;t give a damn about your order. You&apos;ll get it, but it might have been sitting in the window for an extra 15 minutes.

Anyway you can do as you wish, I really don&apos;t care about the $3. My tipping customers realize that the extra 10% will mean that their order is correct and out in a timely manner 99% of the time.

 I don&apos;t do takeout. I either eat in the restaurant or get it delivered. So I don&apos;t have much of an opinion because I tip in both of those situations. However, as a server I hate to hear these things turn into a matter of blackmail.&quot;See how long it sits in the window&quot;or&quot;I won&apos;t make sure you have the condiments you need&quot;. These things compromise the integrity of the restaurant. Let&apos;s face it, working takeout is a gamble. Not everyone will tip. Does it have to turn so ugly? I find it hard to believe takeout employees don&apos;t realize they will get stiffed.

&quot;What do take-out workers provide the customer in terms of actual service that fast food workers don&apos;t?&quot;

The ONLY difference is that if you get car-side-to-go, you get it delivered to your car as well as the employee has to take payment(whether it would be a credit card they have to swipe or change to give)and go all the way back to give it you. So, if you are brought food to your car such as&quot;car-side-to-go&quot;, would you tip? See, I&apos;m against tipping for if I pick it up inside and agree COMPLETELY with you about that it&apos;s the same thing as fast food places(excluding Sonic Drive-in).

I would like to know your answer, because when you get it delivered to your car as well as give payment and get change or sign the credit card receipt, THAT&apos;S a different service than fast food employee&apos;s(exluding Sonic)do. Now, I have seen a Sonic in Mississippi a few years ago that you could swipe a credit card at the area you ordered from by the menu, but the ones over here in Louisiana, they don&apos;t have that here. The employee has to bring the food, take the credit card or change, ring it up, and make a second trip back to the car. I personally tip at Sonic as long as my food is correct. Would or do you tip at Sonic?

See, at Burger King or any other type of fast food place(excluding Sonic), they do sometimes bring food to the car if a person in drive-thru has a large order. I know, I ordered 5 sandwiches before for my family and the drive-thru lady asked me if I could move up. She brought it out to me. The difference here is, they didn&apos;t have to come back and go back for payment and change. Also, think of the people that have to walk in the rain or heat or cold to bring you your food to your car. I NEVER got car-side-to-go EVER, because I hardly ever get take-out and when I have, I wasn&apos;t that lazy enough to get it delivered to my car. Maybe if it was raining really hard I would get it delivered to my car. I also rather go inside to make sure my order is correct. It&apos;s MUCH EASIER to open up boxes and bags in the restaurant than in a car.

I COMPLETELY agree that if I pick up the food inside, NO TIP, unless it&apos;s a HUGE order. They bag the food, ring you up, give you change, put condiments and utensils in a bag, give you napkins, and if you order a soft drink or tea, fill a to-go cup with soft drink or tea. This is ALL just like fast food workers do(Not counting Sonic, because they have to bring out the food, ring it up, and bring back the change or credit card receipt). Sometimes even, McDonald&apos;s workers do MORE WORK for certain items and NEVER get tipped. It&apos;s just NOT FAIR. Hotcakes and sausage is more work for the employee at McDonald&apos;s than 1 pasta entree at Outback. It&apos;s the TRUTH.

Now, I do think if I was to order 30 entrees for instance, I would tip 15%, because that&apos;s a lot of work. Would you tip if you ordered 30 entrees out of curiosity?

 I haven&apos;t thought about tipping at Sonic because I always use the card swiper at the stall. And there&apos;s no tip line. Moreover, there&apos;s no service difference. Whether you park, pay, and get your food(at Sonic)or pay, get your food, and park or drive off(any other fast food drive through), you&apos;re getting the same thing just in a slightly different order.

Whether they go back and forth doesn&apos;t matter to me. What matters to me is the service I get. They&apos;re only walking back and forth because they haven&apos;t invested in the more efficient technology that allows the person to swipe the card at the stall. I&apos;d even say the person walking back and forth is providing worse service because it takes much longer. Tipping for worse service is just perverse.

Tipping is for people who are attentive to my dining needs, wishes, and preferences beyond basic fast food service.

Would I tip if I orderd 30 take-out entrees? I don&apos;t know. Maybe. If I did, it would be out of a sense of pity, not out of a sense of obligation to pay for services actually received. McDonald&apos;s employees don&apos;t get tipped if you buy 30 Happy Meals.

 Maybe if these people were brought up better they wouldn&apos;t consider Sonic and McDonalds the standard of dining and tipping. If you eat at these kinds of places more than once per month, chances are you&apos;re trashy and can&apos;t afford/don&apos;t know how to eat better.

 Big momma, why can&apos;t you be civilized?

And what does the frequency of eating at fast food restaurants have to do with paying for services that exceed a minimum level?

If you had read my previous posts, you&apos;d see that I refer to fast food service as a minimum level of service. All they&apos;re doing is giving you what you ordered. That&apos;s very different from your red herring about Sonic and McDonald&apos;s being the&quot;standard of dining and tipping.&quot;They aren&apos;t the&quot;standard.&quot;They&apos;re a minimum service reference level.

The bottom line is that take-out workers do not actually provide the customer a service that untipped fast food workers do not provide.

 It&apos;s hard to be civilized when we&apos;ve been having this same&quot;discussion&quot;with the resident idiot, Lords of Ass, who has not one civilized bone in her body. She can&apos;t comport herself as a civilized person and your posts are very similar to hers.

The fact that you hold casual restaurants to the same standard as fast food restaurants is an indication to your dining habits and your lack of knowledge of the difference between the two.

Fast food workers are robots on a line that pick up the same items day after day and stick them in bags. They only attend to one order at a time and there&apos;s a limited menu.

Dining to-go workers attend to many orders at a time and they don&apos;t get the items handed to them wrapped in paper ready to go into a bag.

The fact that you don&apos;t understand these basic facts is uncivilized and offensive to me.

 If casual restaurants provide the same service, they should get paid the same amount. Casual restaurants chose to emulate the fast food model for part of their business in order to make more money on food sales.

Your comment about fast food workers on a line doesn&apos;t matter. First, it&apos;s factually wrong. There are generally several people working in back on multiple things. Second, single people may work on multiple things at once. Cashiers are the most obvious example. Third, the fact that fast food companies have finely tuned their businesses to provide fast service isn&apos;t a reason take-out servers should be tipped.

Whether the menu is limited doesn&apos;t matter in terms of the service receive as a customer. In both cases a worker is handing me my order. Moreover, there are actually dozens of items on most fast food menus. Go to Jack in the Box and tell me how many items you see. So you&apos;re wrong when you say&quot;there&apos;s a limited menu,&quot;unless you&apos;re also going to concede that most restaurants have&quot;limited menus.&quot;

You then say, that take-out workers have to attend to many orders and the orders aren&apos;t wrapped and ready to go. That&apos;s not the customer&apos;s concern. The customer&apos;s concern is the service they actually get. Casual restaurants can stick an extra assembler in back if they have a healthy flow of take-out orders. In fact, many restaurants do have them. I can think of two restaurants near my house that have such a person.

But if the restaurant decides not to do that, that&apos;s a problem for the restaurant, not the customer. The customer shouldn&apos;t be penalized for the inefficencies of the restaurant.

Customers should pay for what they get. And take-out workers don&apos;t actually provide a service beyond the service that fast food workers provide.

 Blah blah blah..........blah. If you choose to justify being a cheap a$$, go ahead. I don&apos;t care. You&apos;ll get the service you pay for.

I could pick your post apart and point out discrepances but I&apos;ve wasted enough time trying to do that with our resident idiot. Whatever, I&apos;m done.

You are, however, as cheap and dumb as Lords. Good luck with that.

 I&apos;d prefer that you&quot;pick [my] post apart and point out discrepances&quot;to calling names for no good reason.

Bottom line: Take-out workers don&apos;t actually provide a service beyond the service that fast food workers provide.

Take-out is nothing more than fast food service provided by restaurants that also offer full service to other customers.

Full service gets a full tip. Fast food service gets no tip. That&apos;s not cheap. That&apos;s reasonable.

&quot;Whether they go back and forth doesn&apos;t matter to me. What matters to me is the service I get. They&apos;re only walking back and forth because they haven&apos;t invested in the more efficient technology that allows the person to swipe the card at the stall.&quot;

Them walking back and forth to and from your car**IS**a&quot;SERVICE&quot;. Think about when you get a pizza delivered to your house, just because they go from the restaurant to your house and back to the restaurant in a&quot;CAR&quot;instead of on foot, doesn&apos;t make it all of a sudden not a service. Walking outside in the rain, heat, and cold weather***IS***DEFINATELY a service not to have to get your butt up to get out of your car. HOW can you say it doesn&apos;t matter? What if you were handicapped and couldn&apos;t get up? Wouldn&apos;t you be happy they&apos;d have such a service not to have to depend on a friend or relative to get up to get your food inside for you? Delivering your food to your car or your doorstep***IS***a service. I don&apos;t know HOW you can say you don&apos;t care if they walk back and forth. The car-side-to go servers**ARE**doing more than a McDonald&apos;s employee or an Outback employee that is doing take-out over the counter. If you have to walk outside back and forth to someone&apos;s car, that&apos;s a DIFFERENCE and it&apos;s a service.

As far as the technology not being up to date, that still doesn&apos;t mean the employee should be made to work harder without getting paid for the*SERVICE*they are providing which is bringing the food, ringing your order up and bringing your change or credit card receipt.

&quot;Tipping for worse service is just perverse.&quot;

Don&apos;t you get that without them bringing it to your car, having them have to make the trip back inside to ring it up and bring the change or credit card receipt back to you is the**ONLY**service that is more work than a fast food worker(excluding sonic)? Since they are doing MORE WORK by bringing the food to you as well as your change or credit card receipt, shouldn&apos;t they deserve SOMETHING, even a buck or 2, depending on how much the bill is, that is? Imagine you walking in the rain to deliver customer&apos;s food and how fun that is. You SHOULD tip when you get food delivered to you as long as it&apos;s correct whether it is to your doorstep or to you car, it&apos;s still DELIVERY.

 Walking back and forth isn&apos;t a benefit to me. It&apos;s not a service to me. Service is the benefit I get. I get the exact same thing regardless of whether it&apos;s a Sonic that decided to upgrade or it&apos;s a Sonic that didn&apos;t.

I don&apos;t care whether a person takes my credit card or a machine takes it. It&apos;s the same service.

Pizza delivery is different because they are leaving their place of business and coming to my home. There are risks and costs involved in that that exceed those that are experienced by a person who walks 50 feet to my car.

You seem to think that not getting out of the car is, itself, worth of pay. It&apos;s not. Drive through windows also keep me from getting out of my car. They don&apos;t get tipped either. One Sonic near me only has stalls. The other one has a drive through in addition to the stalls. I don&apos;t care whether I get my food and park in a stall or whether I park in a stall and get my food. Either way, it&apos;s just food being passed through my window.

You say the car-side servers are doing more than a McDonald&apos;s employee, but that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean they&apos;re doing more for me . They can work harder without increasing the benefit to me. Picking up a take-out order from a drive-through window, as permitted by some newer casual restaurants, is at least as good as having someone come out to my car.

You&apos;re having a hard time distinguishing between work and service. They are very different concepts. More work can lead to more service, but it doesn&apos;t have to. Often it doesn&apos;t. My experience is what&apos;s important when I&apos;m a customer. I don&apos;t care how hard someone works behind the scenes. I care about what I get. If someone(or something)provides me something almost effortlessly, it&apos;s worth just as much to me as when someone exerts lots of effort behind the scenes to provide me with the exact same benefit. For instance, I wouldn&apos;t tip an obese server more because it takes them more work to bring me my food. I don&apos;t care about the work expended. I care about the service I get.

You&apos;ll get no sympathy from me by appealing to working in the rain. I worked as a courier delivery driver and received no tips. Walking between vehicles and buildings in the weather was just part of the job. And, for Sonic workers and curb-side delivery workers, it&apos;s just part of the job. I agree that there&apos;s probably a stronger argument to be made for workers who actually deliver the food to your car, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s strong enough to justify tipping.

And 50 foot&quot;delivery&quot;at Sonic doesn&apos;t count as delivery in the same way that pizza delivery does. I already gave my reasons earlier in this post.

 genise,
I am going to try to explain this the best way I can. You&apos;ve already met cuntflap that is our #1 troll. And we have tried a million different ways to get it to think. Not possible. So...
Tipping at your local Crapplebee&apos;s or Outback to take out is in no way the same as going to Wendy&apos;s or KFC. A carside person has to answer the phone, take your order, put it in the pos, answer a million questions, confirm the order and then send it back to the kitchen. That is the first part of the service they are providing for you. THe second part is they personally go to the kitchen and get the food, check to make sure the expo has it correct, get the condiments, silverware, and whatever special needs you have asked for. Third they have told you how long it should take to have all of this ready for you. They have asked what kind of vehicle, and what color you are driving. They bring the food to your car when you arrive. They take your payment, give you change or go back inside to run your credit card. There is about 20 steps I may have left out. This is only your order.... they have many many orders going at the same time. They do this for all the orders. This is nothing like going to Wendy&apos;s threw the drive threw or even going inside. I don&apos;t know how else to explain it to you. Don&apos;t hate, listen and learn. 99.999999% of us have worked in restaurants, work in restaurants, have been bartenders, servers, cooks, expos, hostesses, carside, management. We really do know what we are talking about. On the other hand cuntflap worked at a nutshop and has no manners and no clue how the restaurant business works. Like I said don&apos;t hate, please listen and learn.

 Coorslite, I think curbside is a borderline case. I ask you to please read my posts again. It&apos;s clear that we are not just talking about curbside delivery. In fact, until LOA showed up today, I was talking only about take-out, which includes drive-through and walk-in pickup service. Curbside delivery is a subset of take-out, but it&apos;s not all of take-out.

There&apos;s no reason the worker should be tipped for merely getting the order right. Every business that delivers goods has that obligation.

Going to the kitchen and getting the food is not my concern. As a customer, I don&apos;t care whether there&apos;s a window directly opening to the take-out area or whether the kitchen is on the other side of the building. That&apos;s just not my concern.

You also say that&quot;they have told you how long it should take to have all of this ready for you.&quot;You know, Chipotle does that for free. Go to http://www.chipotle.com and pick&quot;order.&quot;

You might have an argument based on curbside delivery, but there&apos;s absolutely nothing special about taking an order, getting it right, and handing it to the customer.

You say that I need to&quot;listen and learn.&quot;I would tell you the same thing. You&apos;re making the same mistake LOA made by confusing work with service. You think that the customer should care about all the stuff you do behind the scenes. As I customer, I don&apos;t care. You should listen and learn so you know what customers care about.

And, if you&apos;ve read my other posts from today, you&apos;d notice that I&apos;ve worked service jobs including fast food*and*waiting.

One of the restaurants I was a waitress at did pretty strong take-out business. It was a Mexican restaurant where we had a drive through window and an area where people could walk in to pick up their food. There was a direct window to the kitchen. They&apos;d assemble the meals, pass them to us, and we&apos;d pack the condiments and utensils. If it was a pre-order, we&apos;d put it in a warming oven. If they ordered at the restaurant, we&apos;d hand them the food after it was prepared.

Sometimes people left tips. I was happy to get tips because, hey, who doesn&apos;t want more money? But that doesn&apos;t mean we were doing anything different for the customer that I didn&apos;t do for customers at Burger King when I was in high school.

Some restaurants are poorly designed with respect to their take-out business. But why should the customer care about that? They just want to get their food and leave.

 genise, none of us expect 20% tip on a to go order. You are not getting the same amount and level of service if you were to sit in the dining room. However you are getting some personalized service, and a person is doing just that.
All of us in a tipped trade run the risk of being stiffed. We as tipped employees depend on tips to earn an income, that&apos;s why we work. I know you are thinking take that up with your employer. How would you like it if the to go menu was 20% higher so the establishment could get people to work to go? If for nothing else it is the right thing to do and creates good karma. Don&apos;t you just feel better when you have done the right thing? Its a few bucks genise, and maybe that few bucks is enough to keep someone off medicaid or food stamps. Which by the way we all pay for, with no choice. People try to support themselves and families on the money they make at their jobs. No its not up to you to support the world, but sometimes its just the few bucks that make the difference. Formerly Jammie

 If tips aren&apos;t expected then why are most takeout positions paid below minimum wage? It is expected that tips will make up the wage.

 Hacinta, if the take-out menu were 20% higher, the restauraunt would probably loose a lot of business. The whole point of take-out at most restaurants is to get a reasonably fast, decent quality meal for a good price(as opposed to fast food, which is just fast and cheap). Restaurant sales are very sensitive to changes in price. In most cases in a competitive market -- which is just about everywhere -- a 20% increase in food prices would lead to greater than 20% drop in sales, which would cause the restaurant to actually lose money.

I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the&quot;right thing&quot;to tip people who handle take-out order. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a moral issue at all. For me, it&apos;s simply an issue of paying based on what you actually get.

It&apos;s likely that an experienced waiter is being underutilized when they&apos;re working on take-out orders. But I don&apos;t think that makes it the customer&apos;s duty to help make up the difference between what the waiter gets normally when providing full service and what the waiter gets when the waiter is only providing fast food service.

Often the management is making a mistake when it staffs the take-out counter with a server. It takes less ability to be a take-out worker than a server. The transition should probably be the other way. Take-out servers should be occasionally pulled off take-out duty to help with serving rather than the other way.

Is it a bummer that you&apos;re being asked to do lower-level work? Sure. But it&apos;s not the customer&apos;s fault.

Caby_kay, as long as the tips received from all sources push the wage above minimum, there&apos;s no problem.

 I don&apos;t agree with this person&apos;s opinion but why are they a troll? Just because we don&apos;t agree doesn&apos;t make someone a troll. She&apos;s been pretty calm and hasn&apos;t really been insulting. Let&apos;s be a little more open-minded.

&quot;You think that the customer should care about all the stuff you do behind the scenes.&quot;

Walking to and from someone&apos;s car is*NOT*behind the scenes. You can see them go and come back.

&quot;You&apos;re making the same mistake LOA made by confusing work with service.&quot;

If they are walking back and forth so they can deliver your food to your car as well as take the payment and give you change or the credit card receipt so you don&apos;t have to get your butt up, YES, that work**IS**service that is DIFFERENT than Burger King. IT IS!

 Posted on Wednesday, October 25, 2006 - 11:24 am:   
 you want to be us to be civilized and still in one of your post you say that we are frustrated about our jobs. if was unhappy or frustrated i would not still be doing it, and if it didn&apos;t pay my bills i would not still be doing it either. i make great money in take out, on good night i can average 20% and in rare ocassions i have made more money than servers.

don&apos;t come here and tell me that my job is the same as a fast food employee. i already explained the differences in an above post to LOA. i don&apos;t go and trash your job or try to tell you that you are a glorified something. what kind of stupid rationalization is that.

of maybe 50 people i have on a shift, 10 won&apos;t tip, for example. sometimes i get lucky and only 3 people don&apos;t tip. should i get annoyed even though other tips are sort of making up for it, oh yes, i am giving the same service to this idiots that decided not to tip. tipping on 1 appetizer, not really that annoying, unless you ask for 6 extra ranches and 4 extra breads with butter. i still have to prepare that and pack it so yes it deserves a tip. now a $40+order with specifications, yes i expect a tip and if you are a weekly regular that doesn&apos;t tip, then yes you will have to wait for the paying customers and you probably won&apos;t get everything that you wanted. your food won&apos;t be packed up nicely it will simply be thrown together in the bag and if it spills in your car oh well, you should have checked it before you left.

try doing take out on a busy night and still serving every customer 100% . try handling the phones for at least one hour when all the calls that come in are for take out. try taking care of people that come in and want to order in between the phone orders. you have to have the pace to be able to turn those orders in within a certain time so that the customers don&apos;t wait past the time you quoted. you have to pack those orders and do all the sides, dressings, toppings, etc. while you box the food the cook just cooked for you(no they don&apos;t come in boxes already), handle people that call back to add or change something in orders that are already put in, go back to the front and take care of the customers that are already here to pick up their food. deal with the people that add things when they get to the restaurant while you have at least 15 more orders in the back, 3 more orders in the phone, and maybe one more person that walked in to order. if you get the food 100% correct, hot, and in the time i quoted you in the middle of the rush yes a tip is deserved. a tip is deserved even when there is no rush because i still packed everything you asked for and i still took your food out to the car in the time i quoted you.

fast food employees have everything wrapped up for them. you don&apos;t have to wait for the food to be cooked just reheated(unless they ran out of nuggets and they throw them in the fryer). sometimes if you are at the drive thru you have someone that already boxes the fries and what the drive thru person does is the soda and put in the PRE PACKAGED sauces(i have to go and put the sauces in the little containers, including the ketchup and the A1..)in the bag. the line of the drive thru can only be so long. if one person orders there are maybe 3 cars in front of the one that just ordered. one paying and the others waiting to pay and get their food. they can&apos;t really have more than 4-5 customers at the time. sure they will have more overall sales during the whole day(they are opened sometimes 12+hours. we are opened for 6-8 hours), but i get to deal with at least 20 people at the same time. 20 orders that mostly sometimes do not consist of one burger with fries and 2 nuggets combo.

take out orders are usually one appetizer with extra dipping sauce, 3 entrees with sides i have to get or get the toppings for(they are not pre packaged, everything were i work is fresh), salads with extra dressing and specifications of what they want more or don&apos;t want on it. maybe they will include dessert that most of the time we prepare. when the food comes out it does not come in a box. we have to take the order and make sure they don&apos;t get mixed up; in the middle of the rush, usually everything comes out together. label the boxes if asked(and if you don&apos;t tip i don&apos;t care how many times you ask i will always manage to forget and picture you trying to figure out which steak is medium and which one is well)or if simply the steaks are all the same with different temps and different sides. you have to make sure you are on top too with the people that are outside, you see they don&apos;t want to wait outside. that is why you quote them the time and you make sure the food is ready by the time you quoted them.

a fast food employee stands there while you order from their limited menu takes your cash or card and maybe makes your soda while he throws in the packets for sauce. 60% of the time when i used to order from fast food i got my order wrong or even missing parts of it. who calls back a fast food to complain, almost no one because it is cheap. trust me if there is something wrong with a take out order they will call back, even if you forgot the bread. that is why it is so important that we take the time to make sure that everything is there. in the middle of the rush you can forget things especially if the kitchens sells them to you late.

i have more things to think about than a fast food employee while i handle your order. you don&apos;t get a robot or static when you order thru the phone with me. i can explain the menu if you don&apos;t have one. i can&apos;t really see a fast food employee explaining something without giving you attitude. i guess we do have something in common. if you don&apos;t tip and i have to see you every week i guess i will treat you with the same attitude. no wonder you like fast food so much.

what you say you don&apos;t care to see because it happens in the back, is what i do to give you the service you say you don&apos;t have because you are not seeing it. that for me is just a cheap excuse not to tip. who do you think prepares your order. why would they have someone that just walks the bag to your car, that is just stupid. places that don&apos;t have a take out personel just give the order to the hostess, bar, or other servers. they still have to do what i do and they have to go out of their normal duties to do so, so yeah they still deserve a tip. you are like the people that get out of their cars or walk in the room to get their meal, they think that then they don&apos;t have to tip cause well they walked in, i didn&apos;t walk out. again who packs your food....common sense people common sense.

 If you don&apos;t care about what happens&quot;behind the scenes&quot;, then you really shouldn&apos;t care to tip a server either, should you. Because all they&apos;re really doing is the same thing that a take out person is doing, except you get to sit somewhere other than your home or office.

Please think before you speak, sir. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

 LOA,&quot;behind the scenes&quot;isn&apos;t meant to be taken as a literal reference to a play&apos;s set design.

Teleburst, you say you don&apos;t believe that I&apos;ve been a servier because I said I don&apos;t care about what goes on behind the scenes. You didn&apos;t fully quote me. As a customer , I don&apos;t care about what goes on behind the scenes. There&apos;s a difference there.

Penelopemarie, you say,&quot;you want to be us to be civilized and still in one of your post you say that we are frustrated about our jobs.&quot;After all the name calling and complaining, that seems to be the case. I&apos;m not saying that anyone is somehow bad because their manager assigned them a particular job -- in this case, take-out.

You tell me to not&quot;come here and tell me that my job is the same as a fast food employee.&quot;From your perspective, it might not be. From the customer&apos;s perspective, it is. And the customer is the one paying for the service.

You also say,&quot;if you are a weekly regular that doesn&apos;t tip...you probably won&apos;t get everything that you wanted.&quot;That&apos;s a bad attitude for any worker to have. Fast Food workers try to get everything and they receive no tips. Are you saying you&apos;re better than them, that you should be able to extort money from people because you&apos;re somehow special? Tell me that&apos;s not the attitude you have.

The rest of your post is your saying how hard it is. As a customer, that doesn&apos;t matter to me. I don&apos;t care if you have to put ketchup in a container or whether it&apos;s in a packet. Customers don&apos;t need to pay you extra because your business is inefficient. The service is the same. It&apos;s just packaged condiments.

I understand that you think your job is harder. But that doesn&apos;t mean your extra work is an extra benefit to me.

You then, for some odd reason say,&quot;no wonder you like fast food so much.&quot;What makes you say that?

Bistroy, the reason I am willing to tip servers when they provide full service is because they are offering my personal service beyond what untipped fast food servers offer. They&apos;ll refill my drinks. They&apos;ll check to see whether everything is ok. Take-out workers don&apos;t do that.

Bistroy, please read more carefully before you type, sir. I&apos;m not a&quot;sir.&quot;That&apos;s pretty clear from my posts.

Again, the bottom line is that, as a customer, I am not receiving a level of service that&apos;s greater than what I&apos;d receive at a fast food restaurant regardless of how hard the server/cashier is working. The only real difference from a customer perspective is that people like penelopemarie are willing to use poorer-than-fast-food service to essentially extort tips.

 Oh, and take out people won&apos;t stand there while you unbox everything and get everything else that you need? That&apos;s not making sure that you&apos;re ok? So they don&apos;t refill your drinks. That&apos;s one less thing that they&apos;re doing below full service standards, and you haven&apos;t seen or heard a single person on here say that you should tip the standard 15-20%. Many have simply stated that 10% is cool.

And sorry for the sir thing, I was just trying to be more civil. Ma&apos;am, please try to refrain from being a smart-ass and condescending. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

That&apos;s EXACTLY why I don&apos;t think you were ever a server. You show no sense of having been one, because the servers that I know factor in everything when they are a guest(I don&apos;t consider restaurant patrons&quot;customers&quot;but&quot;guests&quot;), precisely because of their experience.

&quot;Hacinta, if the take-out menu were 20% higher, the restauraunt would probably loose a lot of business. The whole point of take-out at most restaurants is to get a reasonably fast, decent quality meal for a good price(as opposed to fast food, which is just fast and cheap)&quot;.

I&apos;m glad that you finally acknowledge that restaurant to-go food isn&apos;t the same as fast food. Good. You&apos;re making progress.

&quot;Again, the bottom line is that, as a customer, I am not receiving a level of service that&apos;s greater than what I&apos;d receive at a fast food restaurant regardless of how hard the server/cashier is working&quot;.

Ooops, backsliding again, I see.

 Posted on Wednesday, October 25, 2006 - 05:00 pm:   
 so now i am extorting tips(and you say you are not attacking anyone...yeah i know your kind). i guess then for you to see the level of service required for take out i guess i am going to have to get you into the kitchen so that you can actually see the work. you pay for what you see. you see the server at your table bringing you the food. you don&apos;t see me preparing and bagging the food. that is the only difference, oh and that i don&apos;t get you refills. you choose not to tip because you don&apos;t see what i do. wow great mentality.

i never said i was frustrated at my current job. people like you frustrate me because i am working for free. anybody in any other job would get frustrated if they don&apos;t get paid for the job they just performed. again the manager did NOT assign me this job, i chose it. i want to do it because aside of the cheap people like your self i make a pretty decent income.(extorting people like you said)

this is not the customer&apos;s perspective this is your perspective as a customer. this is what you think it is 100% right. of course you are going to be right you can&apos;t seem to look beyond your own cheapness. you are trying to explain to me what MY job consists off, when you haven&apos;t even done it.

about my bad attitude. if you are not paying for the good service you think you are entitled too, i have all the right in the world to give you any attitude i want, without of course crossing the line and getting fired. a fake smile goes a long way, and the fact that i control the accuracy and how fast the food can be out for you to consume...well you do the math. why should i take priority over someone that won&apos;t pay me to do so. if i have a regular tipper, his order will be attended to first and double checked. yours on the other end will have to wait until i get the chance to get to it, probably sitting in the window and i will probably not have the time to prepare and pack all the extra sauces you actually need to have a pleasant dinner at home that you did not have to cook.

&quot;I understand that you think your job is harder. But that doesn&apos;t mean your extra work is an extra benefit to me.&quot;

wow you understand I THINK my job is harder...no I KNOW my job is harder. and yes my extra work is a benefit for you. if we didn&apos;t have take out you will be enjoying fast food all the time. don&apos;t tell me the fast food service is great when half the time what you ask for is not even in the bag. and they just have to pick the right packet and throw it in the bag....they don&apos;t prepare anything.

as customer you should care about what happens behind the scenes, because if your steak get burnt and i have to re cook it, i guess you should care about that. if there are no clean glasses for your drink and you have to wait 15 minutes for your coke, then i guess you will complain about it meaning it is something that happens in the back. if your food falls to the floor and we have the decency to tell you that we dropped your food it will be 5 more minutes so that we can re cook it i guess you must care about that too, and that happens behind the scenes. if your food is missing your toppings or your salad is missing your extra dressing, guess what that gets prepared and packed behind the scenes so you should start caring about it. without a back of the house or behind the scenes there can&apos;t be a running restaurant.

 &quot;Extorting tips&quot;

Yup... and??? If you have a problem with that, maybe YOU, Genise, should take it up with the establishments and make a change. But for now, WHY would you possibly expect someone who gets paid LESS than minimum wage, to not look for every avenue to make more money legally.

There is NOTHING at all unusual about&quot;extorting tips&quot;... In fact, isn&apos;t that the very premise of the tipping system? You give a nice tip to insure service is as good as possible, like a bribe. You also reward for service that is well done. If you fail to tip, although it&apos;s not mandatory, any server will feel the same as a painter who doesn&apos;t get paid for painting your home.

Thus, when you get someone who comes back who does NOT tip, you are going to do what you can do to make tips happen from them in the future, or, insure they don&apos;t come back and waste your time again.

Again, this is nothing new in the restaurant business, at my location, even bussers get in on it, you can read&quot;non-tippers&quot;like you wouldn&apos;t believe, and the bussers often times will clear off even the drinks from tables to try and&quot;push&quot;the people out the door. You open the presenter, see $5 on $45 and bam, get the FUK out. No more mister nice guy.

Heck, at my previous restaurant, a guy would come in all the time, and tip poorly, he would specifically NOT request certain servers because after the 2nd or 3rd visit, they would give him horrible service. After a couple months, there were no servers left who he could get decent service from and he just stopped coming back all-together.

This is the reality of it, live with it, tip 18 - 20% for decent service, 10 % on takeout, and enjoy your dinners.

 You know, I was actually swinging toward Genise&apos;s way of thinking. There is nothing different from handing a bag of steaks, potatoes, etc to a customer than a bag full of big macs.

HOWEVER

The problem your failing to see Genise is what you just said in your own words:

 I am not receiving a level of service that&apos;s greater than what I&apos;d receive at a fast food restaurant regardless of how hard the server/cashier is working. 

But you are. Your guaranteed hot food for both places and the quality of food should meet their standards. Both employees work hard and it&apos;s their hard work that gives you hot, correct food.

What you don&apos;t see behind the scenes may not be a concern to you, but isn&apos;t it? What if the server is bringing the food out cold? What if the server is slow? What if the food is incorrect?

McDonalds has a manager who would step in and probably give you a replacement, or take the steps on coaching the employee.

Same goes for the server in a restaurant, but your tips help the desire to make sure everything is fast, everything is hot, and everything is correct. In this case the manager wouldn&apos;t have to step in because the server is making SURE that your needs are met. If that isn&apos;t service, then I don&apos;t know what is.

Granted you&apos;ll run into a Mc&apos;Ds employees who give great service by doing something out of the ordinary, but they don&apos;t take tips. Corporate policy. So other than losing their job, they have nothing else to lose.

So when your at home enjoying your hot food without anything missing to make the meal enjoyable, who are you going to thank?

Now on the flip side, I think Corp is trying to make an extra buck. This curbside crap is another way of the restaurant to sell more food. Since people now can order to-go food without waiting for a table or in their minds(like Genise)don&apos;t have to tip for service, who gets punished?

The Server.

Actually, with every change in policy, tipping, etc the number one person who is impacted is the server. We&apos;re the ones who get arrested/fined if we sell underage liquor, we&apos;re the ones who have to tip out support staff, we&apos;re the ones who face customers with poor quality food or upset customers because another table is loud. We&apos;re the ones who have to do to-go orders, micro-manage multiple tables and make sure customers are happy. And we get paid the least per hour in terms of hourly wage.

Tough job and I love it!

&quot;Put in the PRE PACKAGED sauces(i have to go and put the sauces in the little containers, including the ketchup and the A1..)&quot;

Sometimes it&apos;s the*CASHIER*that took my order and rung me up actually put my tartar sauce or mayonnaise in a cup at McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, and Burger King.

&quot;60% of the time when i used to order from fast food i got my order wrong.&quot;

This is EVERYWHERE. I ordered take-out from a local pizza place(NOT a famous one like Dominios). I ordered a side of bbq sauce(they have bbq pizza)and a side of ranch. Do you know what I discovered that the cashier did? She***DIDN&apos;T****CHECK*the bag. I had to check. I saw there was my bbq sauce and ranch missing. My point is, this is NOT fast food and the cashier made a couple of mistakes. This place serves different type of pizzas, pasta, mozzarella sticks, salads, etc. My point is, for you to limit this to fast food is just STUPID.*ANY*place is subjected to mistakes, whether it&apos;s fast food or not. Do you see that she didn&apos;t check the bag, but I did? WHY didn&apos;t she do that? You know, because she&apos;s LAZY. Thank goodness I didn&apos;t get it delivered or I would have been some pissed off. We ordered at least $20 or more worth of food. People that are too damn lazy to look in a bag to make sure the order is correct deserves NO TIP, so you are only hurting YOURSELF by not making sure things are in the bags or boxes are correct.

&quot;Who do you think prepares your order.&quot;

Your EMPLOYER pays you an hourly wage. The preparing is part of the reason you get a wage per hour.

&quot;They think that then they don&apos;t have to tip cause well they walked in, i didn&apos;t walk out. again who packs your food....common sense people common sense.&quot;

NO, common sense is that you are doing a&quot;FAST FOOD WORKER&apos;S JOB&quot;(excluding Sonic).

That is the only difference, oh and that i don&apos;t get you refills.

You are SO WRONG. Keep reading the responses below.

People like you frustrate me because i am working for free.

You have a**CHOICE**to work at a job that pays MORE per hour you know. Secondly, you arent working for free. Didnt you say you make at least $3 and something cents an hour? Thats not working for free.

If i have a regular tipper, his order will be attended to first and double checked. yours on the other end will have to wait until i get the chance to get to it, probably sitting in the window and i will probably not have the time to prepare and pack all the extra sauces you actually need to have a pleasant dinner at home that you did not have to cook.

See, you dont treat all customers EQUALLY. You expect a tip for something that Wendys workers do, when they dont get tipped, so WHY should they treat you ANY DIFFERENTLY when you are doing the SAME things they do for no tip?(excluding car-side-to-go or curbside)

They just have to pick the right packet and throw it in the bag....they don&apos;t prepare anything.

Again, NOT TRUE. Ive had tartar sauce in a cup EVERYTIME Ive order a fish sandwich at Burger King and McDonalds. Ive had mayonnaise in a cup also lots of times at McDonalds, Wendys, and Burger King. Sometimes it was the cashier that got it, sometimes it was someone in the back. My point is, SOMETIMES IT WAS THE**CASHIER**that took my order and rung me up that got a cup and a lid to fill it up as well as got me a knife or spoon.

genise
&quot;I don&apos;t care if you have to put ketchup in a container or whether it&apos;s in a packet.&quot;

I agree with this, because as I said before, I&apos;ve had cashiers fill a cup with tartar sauce and a cup with mayonnaise before quite a number of times. Sometimes the cashier gave it to someone in the back, sometimes they filled it themselves.

&quot;Bistroy, the reason I am willing to tip servers when they provide full service is because they are offering my personal service beyond what untipped fast food servers offer. They&apos;ll refill my drinks. They&apos;ll check to see whether everything is ok. Take-out workers don&apos;t do that.&quot;

You told Bistroy! Way to go! It&apos;s the TRUTH! Bistroy is an IDIOT!

bistroy
&quot;Because all they&apos;re really doing is the same thing that a take out person is doing, except you get to sit somewhere other than your home or office.&quot;

That&apos;s a flat out LIE. Do I see to-go customers get refills? NO! Do I see a to-go server have to walk give you your bill? NO! Do I see a to-go server(when you pick it up inside)walk to give you your bill, walk to get the payment and walk back to give change or a credit card receipt? NO! Do I see a to-go server checking on you several times during the dining experience? NO! Do I see them making extra trips to get things such as extra napkins when you are picking up the order inside? NO!

PROVED YOU WRONG, YOU IDIOT!

&quot;That&apos;s not making sure that you&apos;re ok?&quot;

I&apos;ve gotten my order wrong at places that weren&apos;t fast food that I placed an order to-go, so just as penelopemarie said she makes mistakes in her blog, so can ANYONE. Getting a to-go order DOESN&apos;T GUARANTEE NO MISTAKES. Also making sure its ok is something EVERYONE that serves food does. Some people are just too lazy to do it.

That&apos;s one less thing that they&apos;re doing below full service standards.

NOT TRUE AT ALL. Ive gotten 2 refills before in one dining experience, which means MORE than(1)trip. Also, you are forgetting about they come to check on you. They have to sometimes take back food to the kitchen if its wrong or cold. They also have to make separate trips for condiments, because some people ask when their food arrives, I KNOW, Ive SEEN IT HAPPEN at another customers table. Also, they bring you your check, come to get the check and either money or credit card, and bring those things back to the table. Sometimes people like myself ask for extra napkins, because I use a lot of condiments, so things get to be messy sometimes. All that walking is SO MUCH MORE WORK than take-out workers do. Its the TRUTH.

vozveratu
It&apos;s their hard work that gives you hot, correct food.

Ill agree its hard work, but correct food, NOT NECESSARILY. As I stated above, the cashier didnt double check the bag and handing me my pizza and mozzerella sticks order WITHOUT the bbq sauce and ranch. CORRECT FOOD, MY ASS.

 http://thecustomerisnotalwaysright.blogspot.com/2006/04/please-tip-your-take-out -person.html 

This is part of penelopemaries blog:

Yes we make mistakes. if i realize i have an appetizer floating around i probably forgot to put it in someone&apos;s bag. i try my best to call the customer as soon as i realize after all i am only human, and try to make up for the mistake.

NO GUARANTEES THAT MY FOOD WILL BE 100% CORRECT. If you leave something out, thats NOT double checking. This is EVERYWHERE you order food.

 Bistroy.... when did you become stupid? And why wasn&apos;t anyone but the ass notified? I told you I was a thief. I am deeply hurt that you have hid your ignorance from all of us. And you are an idiot too. I am sooooooo upset. Why would you keep this from us? I thought we were friends, are you a liar also? I&apos;ll bet you are. Come out of the closet now and all will be forgiven! I&apos;ll bet you&apos;ve been watching paint dry with me. That would explain everything.

 I really stopped caring about what Loads of Fat has to say, lol.

It all works out, seriously, DONT TIP, I don&apos;t care that much. Sometimes it&apos;s fun to have a reason to totally screw someone.

Hell, last night, a couple customers sat at the bar, rang up a $30 bar check, and then went to a table, after finishing their drinks, stiffed the bartender... of course the server was then told this, who then gave HORRIBLE service, and if thats not enough, when they ordered more drinks, they were poured about 1/3 of the actual shot. Their drinks rarely got refills, no check backs, etc.

You think we don&apos;t take it out on you? Are you serious? Go ahead, DONT TIP... it only hurts YOU. Take out servers blatantly say it, there is a REASON your food takes longer, is NEVER right, and is always cold. And the booger hidden in the mash, oh, you didn&apos;t see that, HA!

Lol... It all comes around, and believe it or not, I sometimes look forward to the non-tippers, if you know you aren&apos;t getting paid, it&apos;s actually quite fun to screw em.

So Loads, yes, keep being a dumb idiot. And stiff the wrong people one time, stiff the bartender then go get a table one time because he had a shot with another guest. Thats fine... it&apos;ALL comes around sweetie.

Thanks for cutting and pasting only what would benefit your arguement.

Here&apos;s what I really said:
&quot;If you don&apos;t care about what happens&quot;behind the scenes&quot;, then you really shouldn&apos;t care to tip a server either, should you. Because all they&apos;re really doing is the same thing that a take out person is doing, except you get to sit somewhere other than your home or office.&quot;

and...

&quot;Oh, and take out people won&apos;t stand there while you unbox everything and get everything else that you need? That&apos;s not making sure that you&apos;re ok? So they don&apos;t refill your drinks. That&apos;s one less thing that they&apos;re doing below full service standards, and you haven&apos;t seen or heard a single person on here say that you should tip the standard 15-20%. Many have simply stated that 10% is cool.&quot;

Try arguing with a whole post next time. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

 Vitalryan,

hey were poured about 1/3 of the actual shot.

And the booger hidden in the mash, oh, you didn&apos;t see that, HA!

These are CRIMINAL acts! You could be charged with a crime for this and be fined or do jail time. This is no different from a car salesman sabotaging a customers car because he didnt buy.

This does NOT enhance your standing with the members of this forum.

 yeah, okay. you go ahead and sue for that.


it&apos;d be pretty hard to prove that a bartender did that on purpose as opposed to making a&quot;mistake&quot;.

or, perhaps that&apos;s all the drinks are*supposed*to get.

i don&apos;t know a lot of bars that post how many shots each specific drink gets.

so, yodeler, better be nice to your&apos;tender.

 This is criminal fraud; ask a lawyer.

No yodeler, criminal fraud is intentionally portryaing a good or service with the intent to deceive. Please before we continue go find the statute that declares what a&quot;Shot&quot;is. Here I&apos;ll help - a&quot;Shot&quot;is most commonly defined - although in no legal sense - as 1 and 1/4 ounces of liquor. If a sign hangs in the establishment that states a price and a specific quantity of liquor than you may have a case. If you find a bar that makes such a claim I&apos;ll suck a monkey&apos;s balls. The reason is as everyone knows, Bars and bartenders make a good chunk of money by shorting liquor to people who either;
A. Don&apos;t tip
or
B. Can&apos;t tell the difference between 1/2 ounce or 1 1/4 ounce in their drink.

I actually bankroll my liquor. Douchebag cheap kids come in: half ounce. I save that half ounce so that when my regular good client comes in he gets something extra. It is a win, win situation. People who don&apos;t like to tip, don&apos;t have to, and I recoup my losses on them by giving more to people who do tip. But it is in no way a case of fraud if I short pour because there is*******************NO LEGAL DEFINITION FOR A SHOT OF LIQUOR******************Once in a while I gotta get all lordsy up in this piece.

(PS I hope no one knows of a bar that advertises specific amounts of liquor - monkey balls taste terrible, uh or so I&apos;m told)

 Well, to state honestly, it is wrong to take out on the customer what was taken out onto you. I don&apos;t like to stoop to the level of an ass and make myself an ass, but that&apos;s just me.

The only thing we do in our restaurant is not give the&apos;extra&apos;service to the customers who are known not to tip. Extra liquor? Yeah right. Free food for a special occasion? Not!

Those who do take care of us are in turn taken care of. That&apos;s the way we play our game. To each his/her own.

 That&apos;s how I do it. We were allowed to offer a round of drinks or dessert for special occasions or just because we felt like. Of course that was not to be used liberally just at our discretion. If I had jerks I never offered them anything. But I didn&apos;t stiff them either.

 i give what i recieve. if i recive a tip i will give my standard service. if i recive a good tip i will give my good standard service. if i don&apos;t receive a tip i will not give my standard service, and if you are a rude a**i will go out of my way to return the favor in a way that allows me to do so. no i won&apos;t put disgusting things in your food(although i have thought about, but you have to be real REAL A**for me to do so)but you won&apos;t really get what you want and i will return your attitude with my own.

now for those saying i can get fired, yeah sure if i go overboard and call someone a F******A**, but there are ways to imply things without really saying them.

 Our difficult customers who are not happy because they are not happy and try to take it out on the server?

Manager time.

My partner and I had a customer who was like that. Started getting all pissed off because he asked me if we still had a sushi item, which wasn&apos;t on the menu. I said yes and find out later that he is pissed because it wasn&apos;t ordered. Well you didn&apos;t say you wanted one!

Still raging and waiving us off, we finally got a manager to step up to the plate. Manager basically waited on the table for the rest of the night. We haven&apos;t seen the customer since then.

Aww, too bad...

 No I mean when penelope starts implying that the customers an a____hole. I know if I was a customer and somebody implied that I&apos;d go off.

She mentioned that there are ways to let a customer know they&apos;re being a jerk without actually saying it so she doesn&apos;t get fired. Well if I was a customer and somebody did that to me(hypothetically of course because I am nice!)my line of thinking would be I can say whatever I want because they can&apos;t fire me, all they can do is ask me not to return. So i would use to it go off on the implying server.

 once the customer crosses the line and starts yelling and cursing they tend to get kicked out of the restaurant. i don&apos;t go up to random people and try to get them pissed off, but once or twice i have had entitled idiots treating me like crap so i just returned the favor. once they thought i was doing it on purpose they started yelling at me(ghetto people or super entitled people react like that 95% of the time). downside of yelling, there are always people as witnesses that will side with the poor server(me!!!!), and management will 99% of the time side with me if the customer crossed the line. if you are flat out treating someone like crap, don&apos;t try to get all offended because i have a backbone and i will not take it.

 Yodeler, I call it as I see it. You think that it&apos;s immature, good for you. I never claimed that I wasn&apos;t immature. I tend to reserve my immaturity for people like you that think they know our jobs better than we do. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

 You&apos;ve had too many posts over a period of time that suggest that.

You just came back into our light recently, after much posting, so no, I can&apos;t quote that part of your post, without wasting more of my time.

You, and many like you are just here to stir up some controversy, and unfortunately, it works.

Like many have said before, do the job before making such remarks about it. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

Yodeler, you are just calling a spade a spade. Bistroy has trouble answering in a coherent way without resorting to calling names and does it over and over.

Bistroy, you are stirring things up calling names. As jenaclaree said in another thread this is a board for opinions. It&apos;s not for grown people to act like 5th graders calling names at recess.

&quot;Yeah, a booger in mashed potatos is gross, and could cause some legal issues.&quot;

Or at least result in a visit from the health department on a tipoff or bad PR if reported to the right sources. Though of course the restaurant gets hurt more than server unless restaurant does the right thing and fires the server.

&quot;But pouring a 1/3 shot is not criminal. Good grief. Its funny.&quot;
Not criminal but immoral, they should get whatever the standard amount is, but it is obviously hard to prove.

 I can understand a server&apos;s frustration if a customer is treating them rudely or if your not getting good tips for good service. It&apos;s the nature of the beast. Happens, will always happen and we either love it or hate it.

As much as I understand this frustration, I do agree with some of the not so liked people on the board that this would be wrong to do. I know we want to live by the rule; An Eye for an Eye, but we are more special than that.

As a server we have the patience and professionalism to overcome difficult people and show them that no matter how hard they make our life, we will not stoop to the level of rudness they show.

What I love to do with people who act this way is when they are with friends. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than to see their friends roll their eyes, or speak up in defense when a jerk is acting like a jerk. Basically the reason the night is ruined, is not because of you, but because of the customer acting like a jerk.

Now some of the things that servers on the board are doing(I know your probably not really doing it)does nothing to resolve the issue other than self-gratisfaction. Customer will still come back. Still be a jerk. You need to do things that will keep the customer away without losing your job. Don&apos;t be overfriendly, get a manager involve; he or she may kick the customer out, or just put the customer on the backburner. Take care of your nice guests. Can&apos;t get in trouble for that.

Peace

 Regularguy, I do answer in a coherent way first. It&apos;s when people constantly berade every thing a service employee does that I resort to name calling.

Oh, and I&apos;m glad that I could be a part of the stirring up as well. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

 Only a few times have I tampered with food, I&apos;m pretty straight-foreward in the fact I don&apos;t believe in it. The&quot;booger&quot;in the mashed potatoes is not something I ACTUALLY do... but I HAVE taken a big swirl in my mouth with my finger and jam it into a cheesecake when boxing it up for the customer... lets just say it was a $140 check, he handed me the presenter with cash in it, and like the ghetto loser he was, said&quot;it&apos;s all there&quot;--- was like $143, screw that. Then proceeded to ask me to pack up the rest of their cheesecake, yeah, SURE!! Smashed it into a box with some slobber inside for good measure... WHATEVER, I really don&apos;t care.

I TYPICALLY deal with rude customers by being&quot;uncaring&quot;or just kind of rude back, things like they ask their partner if they are ready to order, they are undecided, and clearly are&quot;wanting&quot;to order, I&apos;ll just turn and walk away without saying anything, even though we were clearly in the ordering process, things like that.

To non-tippers? BARE-MINIMUM, and I mean BARE, shorting on the shots of liquor, double charge for cokes, charge for EVERYTHING, sometimes I&apos;ll leave a coffee off if they order dessert since I know it&apos;s so expensive, I won&apos;t waste ANY time dealing with them, no refills unless they get real pushy, which of course pisses them off at that point anyways... etc... Standard crappy service. Enough so they won&apos;t dare sit in your section again. The best part is when you give them horrific service, then give AWESOME service to the 3 other tables only a couple feet away. I go from pissed off crappy hole-in-the-wall diner style,&quot;yeah, you wanna order&quot;to&quot;thank you sir, would you like to place your order at this time or wait a few more moments&quot;It&apos;s quite fun... bleh, anyways, enough on this subject.

But yodeler, sue for shorting liquor, GO AHEAD, give it a shot(pun intended) .

 ~Not criminal but immoral, they should get whatever the standard amount is, but it is obviously hard to prove.~

I think immoral is a pretty lordsian standard to use here. The free market is devoid of a social concience or morality anyway so anything that goes on within the market can&apos;t be held to moral standards. Anyway when I used to take my crappy VW to the Euro car place I didn&apos;t get near the service or handouts that the guy driving the Lotus did. I don&apos;t have a lot to spend on lawyers so when I contact mine he doesn&apos;t take me out to lunch or dinner for discussion as he does with better paying clients. It&apos;s the way the system works, you gets the seats on the ride that you pays for.

 Good point Rev.
In this business being nice helps. I&apos;m sure we have all had the customers that are not the best tippers but are so nice and a pleasure to wait on.
The lotus owner can be compared to the good tipper.
Not fair? To who? The lotus owner feels like they deserve the preferential treatment, they have spent large sums of money on a car. The car dealership has the same mind set. The 50-100% tipper is also deserving of the special treatment.
The only people who have a problem with this system are the ones not willing to spend the money. Still wanting the extra service. Just the way it is. Formerly Jammie

 if you want the extra service then you pay for it...don&apos;t expect it if you are a cheap idiot. hacinta you are right, the ones that get all offended are the cheap ones, the ones that always have to make a big deal out of leaving a 20% tip. no one has said to tip regardless. you tip if the service was good or the best. if it was flat out bad then you don&apos;t tip or tip less that the standard depending on just how bad the service was.

I agree that was my point, the bad tipper should get the regular shot ie what he paid for. For the ones giving great tips, give them more than normal for going above and beyond.

hacinta, the 50-100% tipper damn right deserves special treatment, although in most cases those folks do expect it too. 

At one bar a friend of mine knows a bartender well. He never gets charged for drinks and ends up leaving 100%+as the tip. We got talking about it, when he thought about it he really doesn&apos;t save any money. Works great for the bartender but of course sucks for the bar since they make no money to even cover their costs.

At a bar I go to often, different bartenders serve me differently. or most bartenders, I tip $1 on a $3 beer(regular price)and after my 3rd purchase the 4th is free. If you know a bartender isn&apos;t going to treat you right, you start tipping $1 every other beer which is almost 17% anyway.

Other folks at the same bar are treated differently. For mixed drinks the regulars who like expensive top shelf $5-6 mixed drinks, versus $2(special)or $3 regular well drinks will tip $2 when the bartender charges them well price for premium liquor. I have never seen a weak/cheat pour, they generally heavy pour with everyone.

Obviously, the under charging/freebies for regulars hurts the bars margin but helps the bartenders get rich and lets the bar do lots of volume.

 What is standard for takeout? I don&apos;t think most people know. I was a server(we didn&apos;t do takeout)and don&apos;t know. Of course I never get takeout from a casual dining place. All this curbside to go stuff is fairly new. I have a feeling more people would tip if they knew that&apos;s what they were supposed to do.

This is tricky. Pizza delivered, I tip. Pick up pizza, I don&apos;t tip. Would the same apply for Restaurants? Is that maybe why people do tip?

Sit down kind of restaurant that has waiters/servers who get tipped? Check.
Food is prepared in kitchen, assembled by waitstaff? Check.
Waitstaff accepts tips? Check.
Your happy with service? Check.

Then tip.

See what I&apos;m thinking is that if I get takeout from a casual place 10% would only be $1. I&apos;ve already read that is unacceptable. Is there even a standard?

 reg, I never agree with not charging a customer/friend. That is bad for everyone. Been in the situation before, I charged the customers for what they had. The other bartender didn&apos;t charge them for half of their drinks. So at tab time they assumed that I was padding their tab. These people wernt even aware that they were being undercharged. Other people when they don&apos;t pay for a lot of their drinks feel a sense of entitlement. In the event they do get charged for all drinks consumed they all of the sudden didn&apos;t get something they deserve. Its just bad, bad, bad. People should get charged for what they order, well, premium or call.Then there is the issue of the inventory, that is now screwed. Most bartenders do have the authority to get a drink on the house for a guest, at their discretion. Which is cool and good for business I believe. Your friends bartender is a thief, unless she/he is buying the drinks out of her/his pocket. This is a very sore spot for me, a career bartender. I have felt the brunt of these actions more time than I care to mention. Formerly Jammie

 hacinta I feel the same way, once you get into the mess of giving people things it always ends badly. Everybody losses when you give stuff away. The bar losses because they aren&apos;t making profit. The bartender losses because they either get fired, or the bar closes because they&apos;re giving the place away. And the customer losses because dishonest bartenders lead to higher prices. There are very few jobs in the world that have the type discretion bartenders do when it comes to determining how much they will&quot;Make&quot;in a night.

Having said that I don&apos;t feel the least bit bad about skimming from non tipping customers.
as reg said:
I agree that was my point, the bad tipper should get the regular shot ie what he paid for. For the ones giving great tips, give them more than normal for going above and beyond.

Giving more to the good tipper without taking from the bad tipper results in a loss to the bar. Giving equal shots to the good tipper and bad results in a loss to me and the good tipper. The only fair system is to take liquor from the bad tipper and give it to the good. This way the bar makes every penny they should have off of the liquor. The good tipper and myself are rewarded with better drinks and more money. And the poor tipper doesn&apos;t have to spend money on something he views as unimportant - quality service. Why should I give something to someone who clearly doesn&apos;t respect the business or the job that I do?

 Hmm, percent. I think everyone has their own opinion on what service they receive when doing carry-out. I personally tip anyone who has done some sort of service for me, in this case; taking my order, supplying me with what I need in a timely manner, and getting my food packed right so it stays yummy and hot by the time I get home.

For me, I tip 10-15% from these req.

There is no standard since the system of carry-out is so young compared to other service jobs that receive a standard tip.

Can&apos;t give you a direct answer. Maybe someone can find it and help.

Hmm, I know. When you call in an order, ask if gratuity is included and ask what the proper amount is, just to see what is said.

 Well I&apos;m just curious. To be honest I don&apos;t find that most casual dining food is carry out friendly. how do fries or a quesadilla make it home and still be appealing? The other thing is I don&apos;t like the food from any of those places enough to take it home. Chinese, Japanese, or Thai is where I get my take out.maybe an occasional pizza

 for take out 10% is fine, standard for regular orders. if the order is a big order then 15%. it depends if you have a small order but you want separate bags and a lot of extras then i guess 10%-15%. my regulars tip me 20% which is a lot for take out,but they get great service. if you order a $8 order, will it kill you to leave $10? in that case then $1 is fine, it is actually 10%. we really don&apos;t get that offended if you don&apos;t tip on less than $10, but on a $40+yes. if you drive up sit in your car, wait for me to come out to order then yes a tip is expected, especially if it is raining and you can&apos;t call on your cell phone.

now my new manager lets me add a 10% to orders over $150....

 vozveratu, jenaclaree, penelopemarie:

Way back when I mentioned about not tipping for take-out generally, I don&apos;t think I made clear that I don&apos;t ever pick up from casual dining places like penelopemarie works at. As she says because of their set-up she does a lot of work and is paid server minimum only. So I am not talking about that type of situation.

My takeout tends to be like you jenaclaree - pizza, thai, chinese. For pizza I order ahead, for Chinese and Thai I just walk in order at the counter, pay and it comes out of the kitchen boxed and bagged. The only condiments usually are soy sauce packets.

To me Thai and Chinese come much closer to the pick up a pizza model vozveratu mentioned where a tip isn&apos;t really expected.

vozveratu, and everyone here a question if no tip on pick up pizza, what if you order something else from the menu(buffalo wings or a sandwich etc)? I would tend to treat it like the pizza since its all done by the kitchen.

Actually as I think of these pizza, thai, chinese places they often have the manager or family member ringing the register and taking orders but not serving so they probably are making at least minimum anyway. What do you guys think?

 I think that your right about that one, Regular. At places like those, the majority of work done is done by the kitchen, and only the manager or owner has access to a drawer, so that there aren&apos;t too many people with their hands in the till.

I am the GM of our restaurant as well as the bartender(small place). We are however, a full service fine dining establishment. The thing that grinds me sometimes is what happened to me today.

A lady comes in and orders a salad with chicken to go. The chef is in a meeting with someone and the only other cook on was nowhere to be found. I decided that I would run into the kitchen and make it for her. We have an open kitchen, and I looked up out into the dining room a few times, and I saw that she noticed that I was making her food. I then boxed it up, put it in a bag with the to go silverware and ran it to her, then had to run all the way to the other side of the dining room where the credit card machine is to run her card. From step 1 of taking her order all the way to the last step of handing her the cc slips, I handled every single part of her order. Did I recieve a thing other than a line through the tip part? No.

I&apos;ll remember this lady the next time she comes in, and I just might&apos;forget&apos;to ring her order in for about 15 minutes. You get back what you give.

Say that I don&apos;t represent my restaurant very well. I don&apos;t give a flip. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

 Rev, the couple that I was making reference to, you know the ones I was padding their tab.(yeah right)They drank Dewars with shots of 1800. By the time they got their tab, they didn&apos;t know if they had 8 or 12 shots of 1800. The other day shift bartender did not charge them for a lot of them. They were highly intoxicated therefore had not a clue as to how many freebies they were actually getting. All they knew was that their usual 50-60 dollar tab was now 80-100. My point being is that they really didn&apos;t know how much of a savings they got. Their first instinct was to accuse me of adding on drinks. Not thinking that the other bartender may have not charged them properly. I have never in my life padded a tab, that is of no benefit to me. Sure bigger tab bigger tip, or we hope, I would not compromise my integrity for a dollar or two.
This was a very big deal at my job. I got into trouble, first it was that I was talking about how much they drink and that&apos;s why they are not coming back anymore. I told my ex boss&quot;That&apos;s funny I heard that you never bought them a drink that&apos;s why they are boycotting.&quot;Again I have been the innocent victim by bartenders that are thieves. You are right by saying that&apos;s what causes prices to escalate. Formerly Jammie

 Vitalryan,

Since you think that it is ok to spit in someone&apos;s food, it must also be ok for a customer who is unhappy with the service to spit in the waiter&apos;s face, right? Why not, it is what you do?

And when you take your car to be serviced and you don&apos;t tip the mechanic, he then doesn&apos;t do a full job, or puts old parts in your car. That is ok too, isn&apos;t it, because he is spreading it around with the good tippers, right?

If a customer doesn&apos;t tip to your satisfaction, do you hit them with a chair? Shoot them? If I don&apos;t like your service, can I shoot you? Spit in your face? Not pay for the food?

The way grown ups deal with it, is to go to the manager and tell them that they do not want to wait on that person and give the reason why. If the manager backs you up, he should tell the customer, that they should take their business elsewhere. If the manager won&apos;t, then the waiter has a problem with the manager.

Bistroy, I am glad we can agree on something. You are immature.

 I actually do tip the mechanic believe it or not when they are friendly and do a nice job, $5 usually when I get my oil changed if I don&apos;t feel like doing it myself.

yodeler, I think you are wrong about that, if I go to the manager, typically its&quot;too bad, so sad,(insert big corporate restuarant)doesn&apos;t give a damn about your concerns&quot;Thus, I would rather just deal with it myself.

Your logic is severely flawed, if they don&apos;t like my service, they DONT TIP... thats how they respond to it. If I provide terrible service and don&apos;t get a tip, I don&apos;t care, it&apos;s when everything is smooth, you provide a great meal for the customer, and they don&apos;t tip, is when you simply boot em.

Thats the way restaurants work, if you don&apos;t tip for the service, don&apos;t expect ANYTHING, it&apos;s difficult to have a meal at a restaurant with no service.

 Vitalryan,

I tip my mechanic as well(I go to the same guy all the time,)and others to get better service. But if one didnt, would it be ok for the mechanic to pee in the car or to only say he changed the oil, when in fact he didnt? Of course not. So can it be right to short a customers drink or to spit in his food?

It is unfortunate that your manager has such little regard for your welfare. I would say that the problem is with him for not backing you up. It is an unfortunate fact of life that some people are jerks and sometimes it seems like there are an awful lot of them. I think that your target for revenge would be better placed with the manager than with the customer. Perhaps leaving that restaurant could be a blessing in disguise.

I do not think that wait staff should have to deal with rude customers or those who have to a history of not tipping. I also do not think that spitting in the food it the correct recourse.

 Mechanics also get paid for their service, a tip is EXTRA. The mechanic should do a decent job no matter what, in fact, most mechanics are happy to just have the extra work. However, by tipping, you can insure you get priority treatment.

Stiff a server, and the server gets NOTHING, servers are NOT paid for their service by ANYTHING other than a tip, period. It&apos;s VERY different.

Why should I allow a non-tipping sleezebag customer cause tensions between me and my manager? Thats not a solution.

&quot;Why tip taxi, but not bus?
Can you answer that, Lords?&quot;

You know what, that IS NOT COMPLETELY FAIR. If I rode a bus, I&apos;d tip them, because it&apos;s the ALMOST the SAME THING as a cab ride, but there&apos;s BIG DIFFERENCE, you have to leave your car or get someone to drop you off or walk to a bus stop, where as when you get a cab, that person picks you up from your HOUSE, so, honestly, a bus driver should get 10% at the MOST for a tip. 15%-20% or more for cabs. Getting a bus requires getting to the bus stop, which require MOST of the time, to use some of&quot;YOUR OWN&quot;wear and tear, mileage, and gas. You don&apos;t seem to get that getting to a bus stop requires&quot;MONEY&quot;MOST of the time. Even where I live, I would have had a half a mile or a mile if I wanted to get to a bus stop, which in a years time, DEFINATELY WOULD add up to gas and mileage. Sure not one day wouldn&apos;t be much to even bother with, but everyday(5 days a week)would. MOST people, don&apos;t live by a bus stop that they could WALK to the bus stop. In the rain, I wouldn&apos;t bother walking to possible get wet. That&apos;s just not worth it.

 Lords,
last night I went to dinner with my husband, fabulous sushi/japanese restaurant. You know, not a place that serves ground up chicken assholes dropped in batter and fried in trans fat for twats like you to drown in ranch. It&apos;s real food from the ocean and the land, and, oh, nevermind...so anyway, we are know for being great(30%)and more tippers because I am also a part time bartender. The place was packed and we didn&apos;t make a res, last minute thing, and guess what? When a tableopened up, we got it before the others that were there first. Maybe not right, but you know what? We go there, sit the hell down, thank our servers, order off the menu, don&apos;t analyze every move they make, enjoy ourselves, tip well and leave! Try it you skank, but you can&apos;t wear your&quot;God bless the troops&quot;sweatshirt and you black acidwashed jeans and tell hubby to trim up the mullet, k? Wow, you are a piece of work, you know that?

&quot;Yes you should tip 15% at least.&quot;

WHY? All you are getting is something in a BAG and possibly a drink? GEE, doesn&apos;t that sound like ANY fast food restaurant? YES, IT DOES EXACTLY! If they bring it to your car, that&apos;s a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY! I am ONLY talking about if someone picks it up at the counter. Think about the ACTIONS: YOU BAG IT UP, GIVE UTENSILS, NAPKINS, CONDIMENTS, ETC. YOU RING IT UP AND GIVE CHANGE. GEE, SAME EXACT AMOUNT OF WORK FOR NO TIP AT MICKEY D&apos;S, WENDY&apos;S, MCDONALD&apos;S, ETC., SO WHY TREAT***ANYBODY***ELSE DIFFERENTLY FOR THE**********SAME***********EXACT AMOUNT OF WORK YOU IDIOT?

Do they give you refills? NO
Do they bring you a check to a table? NO
Do they bring the rung up check to a table? NO
Do they bring extra napkins or condiments to the table? NO
Do they even take your order at your table while SITTING? NO!
Do they check on you while you are eating or even looking at your bag? MOST PROBABLY NOT! MORE THAN LIKELY NOT!
Therefore, WTF SHOULD 15% EVER, EVER, EVER, be considered for a take-out order? If it&apos;s a HUGE order, maybe 10%. But, let&apos;s say you order two entrees in your order. HELL F***NO, would I tip for them HANDING ME WHAT MCDONALD&apos;S DOES, especially take for example such as hot cakes and sausage at McDonald&apos;s. The CASHIER that not only TAKES YOUR ORDER, PUTS forks, knives, butters, syrups, jellies, in a bag as well as gives you change. WHY IS IT*OK*TO YOU NOT TO TIP THEM BECAUSE WE AREN&apos;T ALLOWED TO, BUT TO TIP TAKE-OUT FOR SOMETIMES LESS WORK LIKE A ONLY 1 PASTA DISH AT LET&apos;S SAY APPLEBEE&apos;S? IS THAT FAIR FOR LESS WORK TO TIP THAN SOMEONE WHO IS DOING MORE WORK? I tip according to**HOW MUCH WORK IS MORE WORK THAN FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS***TO BE****FAIR*****TO EVERYONE! WHY AREN&apos;T YOU FAIR TO****EVERYONE***that SERVES people IN THIS WHOLE WORLD? 15% is for people that do MORE WORK than FAST FOOD and that is the TRUTH! Putting things in a bag is EXACTLY JUST LIKE FAST FOOD! WHO TTF CARES WHAT THEY GET PAID BY THEIR EMPLOYER? IS THAT OUR PROBLEM FOR THE************SAME***************EXACT AMOUNT OF WORK, SOMETIMES LESS WORK EVEN? HELL NO, IT&apos;S NOT!

 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. You have no clue how a restaurant is run. You have no clue what it takes to run take out. You don&apos;t have any idea what the difference between McDonald&apos;s and Outback is. You don&apos;t understand the basic functions in a restaurant. The only thing you do seem to be able to do is screw up a servers and cooks shift. You suck and need to shut up. Hell I even skimmed your rambling crap. You can&apos;t even read a menu. So SHUT UP!
Everyone else... We know what it is like to do this. Hell yeah tip tip tip on take out! Screw that cunts way of twisted thinking! Tip period.

WHY CAN&apos;T YOU PLAY FAIR FOR ONCE? YOU ALREADY OVERCHARGED PEOPLE FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS BY NOT CARING TO DOUBLE CHECK THEIR CHECKS AS WELL AS WORRIED MORE ABOUT YOUR CO-WORKER&apos;S PROBLEMS THAN YOUR JOB! YOU ARE A CUSTOMER&apos;S NIGHTMARE! WHO WANTS TO BE SERVED BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN&apos;T CARE IF YOU OVERCHARGE THEM OR SERVE THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER? NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD! THAT&apos;S WHY***YOU***NEED TO LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR FOR*******STEALING********FROM INNOCENT PEOPLE BY NOT EVEN***************TRYING****************TO MAKE SURE THE PRICES WERE CORRECT!

THAT&apos;S NOT RIGHT AND YOU KNOW IT! Also the overcharging for almost 2 weeks, WHERE the HELL you get off not even************TRYING**************to charge people correctly, huh? Would YOU want ANYONE to do that to you? Isn&apos;t YOUR money important to you, no matter if it is just a dime or a quarter? If you say no, YOU ARE LYING THROUGH YOUR TEETH, because most of you say here, tip before a coupon, well most coupons, literally, are cents more not even a dollar more of tip you&apos;d have, especially if the coupon was only $2 off. It really isn&apos;t much more. Think about $50. $2 more $52, let&apos;s say those are the exact prices including taxes. $50 just at 15% is $7.50 vs. $7.80. You all want the $7.80 amount at the very least, maybe even $8. My point is, just 30 cents makes a diffence if lots of people have that coupon and spend that much. You act like a 30 cents is no big deal, but it truly is to servers OBVIOUSLY that they want people to tip BEFORE all discounts. Most coupons end up being less than a buck difference or a buck difference in tip, literally. If your money means a lot to you, WHY can&apos;t it mean a lot to customers you STOLE it from by***********CHOOSING****************NOT to double check the check againts the menu? I TRULY HOPE SOMEONE STEALS MONEY FROM YOU AND SEE HOW IT FEELS!

&quot;You can&apos;t even read a menu. So SHUT UP!&quot;

If I couldn&apos;t&quot;read a menu&quot;, then I wouldn&apos;t NEVER, EVER catch the wrong price is rung up now would I, DUMBASS? I would also not catch the items being brought to me without the items the MENU stated like marinara with cheese sticks, etc. I CAN DEFINATELY READ, IT&apos;S YOU THAT OBVIOUSLY CAN&apos;T OR TAKE THE***EFFORT**TO OR TO EVEN CARE TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS CORRECTLY, WHICH YOU&apos;VE ADMITTED AND PROVEN BY OVERCHARGING PEOPLE FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS!

 First of all, Fast food employees get paid more than servers do in most States. So they are already compensated.So it isn&apos;t the SAME. Why should a Mickey D&apos;s employee get paid more for the same job if fairness is all that loa cares about? Servers and Take-Out only work for Tips. By not tipping a togo person, the restaurant would have to raise the price of the food for all togo orders and charge for togo boxes. but loa im sure you don&apos;t care.

By not tipping a togo person, the restaurant would have to raise the price of the food for all togo orders and charge for togo boxes. but loa im sure you don&apos;t care.&quot;

For one thing, WHO CARES&quot;HOW MUCH THEIR EMPLOYER PAYS THEM FOR EITHER THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT OF WORK OR LESS WORK?&quot;WHY is it fair that a McDonald&apos;s employee can&apos;t earn MORE MONEY from doing the same or less amount of work? THAT is what isn&apos;t fair! If you tip an Applebee&apos;s take-out server 15%, WHY NOT a fast food employee? What does&quot;HOW MUCH THEY MAKE&quot;truly have to do with being*FAIR*as a customer? In other words, it&apos;s the**EMPLOYER**that isn&apos;t being fair, NOT the customer if they choose not to tip. If you tip the Applebee&apos;s take-out server, you should also tip fast food employees, otherwise, it&apos;s***YOU***WHO ISN&apos;T being FAIR to EVERYONE that does the SAME OR LESS amount of work for you! YOU KNOW IT&apos;S THE TRUTH!

Just because I was paid $6/hr plus any tips, doesn&apos;t mean I didn&apos;t want more money. WHO DOESN&apos;T want to make more money if they can? In other words, just because take-out servers get paid from their employer UNFAIRLY, DOESN&apos;T mean CUSTOMERS should be UNFAIR when they tip. In other words it&apos;s YOU who is paying one person to do what they other is truly doing also or even less work that doesn&apos;t get paid from you. THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S NOT FAIR! Their employer is the problem. WHY let the employers make us pay their employees more, because they are too cheap to do it? THAT&apos;S NOT THE CUSTOMER&apos;S RESPONSIBILITY, IS IT? TIPS are for more service than ANY(excluding Sonic Drive-in because they BRING you your food to your car)fast food worker does. Like when I get a daiquiri, I NEVER tip. WHY? All the person does is get a cup, lift a lever, fill the cup, put a lid on it. Then they ring you up. THAT is actually LESS WORK than fast food restaurants that don&apos;t have self-serve soft drink machines such as MOST Wendy&apos;s and SOME McDonald&apos;s. I tip according to&quot;IF IT&apos;S MORE WORK THAN A FAST FOOD EMPLOYEE DOES TO PAY***********EVERYONE***********FAIR AND SQUARE! The EMPLOYER of the take-out servers is the one who is being unfair, so let that be between the take-out server and the employer, NOT the CUSTOMER! It&apos;s the take-out server&apos;s choice to do that work for only $2.13/hr. NO ONE IS MAKING THEM DO THAT, YOU KNOW! I pay people FAIRLY, WHY DON&apos;T YOU? Don&apos;t you think that McDonald&apos;s worker should get a tip for them serving you hotcakes, sausage, butters, syrups, and utensils as well as took the order and rung it up considering you would tip a take-out server for only getting you a pasta dish with the ALREADY PREMADE PACKAGE that Applebee&apos;s has which includes the utensils, salt&amp;pepper packets, and a napkin? WHO truly did more work here? The McDonald&apos;s employee did for NO TIP. Tell me, is that TRULY FAIR that McDonald&apos;s employee can&apos;t earn more money from you for MORE WORK? NO, it&apos;s not. I be fair to EVERYONE by tipping when there is more work involved than what a fast food employee does(excluding Sonic drive-in). WHY CAN&apos;T YOU DO THAT? WHY do you have to worry about what they are getting paid by their employer? So that somehow gives you the right to be unfair also? It&apos;s enough that the take-out server employer is being unfair, WHY do you have to? It shouldn&apos;t make a difference&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;they make, it&apos;s all about being fair. The McDonald&apos;s employee would love to make more money from you. Just because they happen to get paid at least $6/hr, doesn&apos;t mean they shouldn&apos;t deserve a tip too. WHY should it matter that the take-out servers don&apos;t make as much as fast food employees when it comes to tipping? IT SHOULDN&apos;T have ANYTHING TO DO WITH TIPPING! Tipping should be based on&quot;HOW MUCH WORK DID THE PERSON DO FOR ME&quot;and&quot;IS IT MORE THAN FAST FOOD WORKER DOES OR EVEN LESS WORK?&quot;Think about that*********YOU*********are the person paying people unfairly. Since we aren&apos;t allowed to tip fast food employees(excluding Sonic drive-in), WHY should ANYONE EVER tip for take-out that they come in to pick it up inside? All take-out service at non-fast food restaurants is just&quot;FANCY COUNTER SERVICE&quot;, that&apos;s ALL IT IS! That is the TRUTH!

Take-out servers that serve the counter only do the following:

1. They take my order(whether over the phone or in person by ringing it up on the register)If they choose to write it down, that&apos;s a CHOICE, not mandatory.

2. They bag it up, put napkins(sometimes already pre-packaged utensils like Applebee&apos;s has)utensils, condiments, salt&amp;pepper, etc. into the bag.

3. The take-out server rings it up and gives either change or the credit card receipt.

Tell me what is the TRUE DIFFERENCE in what a McDonald&apos;s employee does for someone that gets hotcakes and sausage vs. a take-out server that serves a pasta dish at Applebee&apos;s? The difference is, the APPLEBEE&apos;S EMPLOYEE had******LESS******WORK. Tell me WHY is it fair to tip them, but not to tip the person that did MORE WORK, huh? IT&apos;S***YOU***WHO ISN&apos;T PAYING PEOPLE FAIRLY. What they make per hour has NOTHING to do at all with what work they did. The tip is for the WORK they provided you, NOT if one employee makes more than the other per hour.

&quot;By not tipping a togo person, the restaurant would have to raise the price of the food for all togo orders and charge for togo boxes. but loa im sure you don&apos;t care.&quot;

I&apos;d actually rather do that than pay someone UNFAIRLY, to be honest with you. I am a FAIR person and I will NOT pay a take-out server unless they BRING the food out to me. At least restaurants are being fair that they DO have EVERY RIGHT to charge for their containers. If they raised the prices of the food, SO WHAT, at least it&apos;s all FAIR. NO ONE would be getting paid unfairly. It shouldn&apos;t matter HOW MUCH someone makes an hour if you tip or not, it should be the AMOUNT OF WORK that should be the decider if a tip is earned or not. Truthfully, a fast food employee should be able to earn tips too for the same or more amount of work they do at times, don&apos;t you agree? Just because fast food employees happen to be paid better by their employer shouldn&apos;t mean CUSTOMERS should have to take the fallout of that by having to tip take-out servers for doing less work or the same amount of work. I will say this again, it&apos;s the take-out server&apos;s EMPLOYERS and customers such as YOU, that are making things unfair. I am fair to ALL the people that serve me by treating them with the payment they deserve. We can&apos;t tip fast food employees(excluding Sonic drive-in), so tell me HOW is it fair to tip&quot;counter service&quot;for sometimes even less work or the same amount of work?

I see. Fair is only what YOU think is fair.

Take out in a full-service restaurant isn&apos;t fair to the tipped employees that have to take time away from paying(read tipping)customers in order to give you the opportunity to get something other than fast food to eat at home unless you compensate them for it through tips. Otherwise, restaurants would be forced to charge more for take out in order to pay those people to do the job.

I can see you now -&quot;I wanna be served - I deserve to be served!! Why is my bartender taking care of someone who just walked in instead of me!! Waaaa - I was first in line!! Oh, you mean that person was first in line because they called 30 minutes ago!! Oh, I guess they WERE in line before me. I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;ll shut up now...&quot;&quot;

BTW, I think that 10% is&quot;acceptable&quot;, but 15% is more appropriate because you are actually paying for the convenience of someone giving you food that you would normally have to sit at a table for. Personally, I think that if restaurants offer take out(which I really don&apos;t think they should), they should simply tack on a 20% surcharge so that they can afford to have dedicated to-go people and not force the guest to worry about a&quot;tip&quot;. Surely, lords wouldn&apos;t be in favor of someone having to work for 2.13 an hour. Fortunately, enough people understand TRUE fairness and leave enough tips where cheapskates like lords can skate through without tipping. I just hope that one day, lords gets her fairness wish and has to pay a surcharge for her take out food.

 LOA you are not being rational. If all you think about is it not being fair, then when you go to a restaurant like Applebees I guess some of the hardest workers in the restaurant are the cooks. They have the longest shifts and work in the hottest enviroments. They don&apos;t get tipped!! Do you tip them when you have dinner? I wouldn&apos;t think that a cheap ass like you would. Cooks are payed more per hour. If a restaurant cannot pay the back of the house something comperable to what the front of the house makes then tips should be pulled. However larger chain restaurants don&apos;t have that problem only smaller ones do. LOA to you who would rather pay a higher price then pay someone unfairly?? Well you would still be paying them more. Their hourly would be much higher, may-be $15 an hour, plus they would still be getting gratuities from people who are not such cheapskates. LOA just stick with what your cheapass can afford. You probably don&apos;t find it necessary to tip a server a brunch, or all you can eat, just because they don&apos;t take a food order from you and bring you your condiments.

You said earlier&quot;... First of all, Fast food employees get paid more than servers do in most States.&quot;

You&apos;re quite wrong about that.

Fast food employees and full service employees ALL receive the full federal or state statutory minimum wage, no exceptions. The difference is in the way that the minimum wage entitlement is paid to those two types of employees.

Fast food employers have to pay their employees the full statutory minimum wage in cash(their employees are not tipped). But the only cash wage employers have to pay tipped employees is a percentage(commonly 50%)of the statutory minimum hourly wage. That&apos;s where servers who really don&apos;t understand that they ARE paid the full minimum wage come up with that&quot;...I only get paid two(or three)dollars an hour ...&quot;mantra.

To make up the rest of their minimum hourly wage obligation, employers of full service restaurant employees get to take credit for the tips their tipped employees&apos;receive(the FLSA&apos;s Section 3(m)&quot;tip wage credit&quot;provision)and call them&quot;employer-paid wages&quot;.(Those&quot;employer-paid wages&quot;are really pseudo wages that are treated as real wages by the IRS for employer&apos;s payroll tax purposes.)

The sum of the employers&apos;cash wage payment and the pseudo&quot;employer-paid wages&quot;wage created by the employers tip wage credit are required by the FLSA to equal the statutory minimum wage. Any shortfall has to be paid by the employer to the employee as a supplemental wage payment.

Looking at it another way, tipped employees ALWAYS get the full statutory minimum wage, usually getting half of it in cash from their employer -- and the other half of it from the cash they&apos;ve received in tips.

In other words, tipped employees always get the full statutory minimum hourly wage, just like any other wage earner. The difference is that tipped employees pay part of their minimum wage themselves.

 Researcher I am sure that works on paper, however in the real world of serving it is not that way. I have never been compensated by an employer because i did not make and average of $6.75 an hour, my hourly plus my tips, for the night. An employer does not pay a supplemental wage to any server. I would love to see such a restaurant. If I was to work a private party whose check was $2000 but they did not leave a gratuity(not all restaurants add gratuity, mine included)I am screwed. I don&apos;t get a supplemental wage. If that is the law, well I sure as hell am not going to sue for a measly $30 bucks or whatever it would be. Most Fast food employees still get paid more than minimum wage, Servers or Busboys are not that lucky.

 I think it is fair to the McDonald&apos;s employee who took the job at how ever much an hour, with no tips. they made a choice and after all isn&apos;t life all about choices?
FAIR, FAIR, FAIR, who gets to decide what is fair? What one person thinks is fair, is not fair to another. That is a matter of opinion, what is fair. Formerly Jammie

 In other words...............WTF is up with that? Why do morons type on and on and then try to sum it up with&quot;in other words&quot;.

Just be cogent the first time and you won&apos;t need a summmation and type on and on and on until people can&apos;t read that crap anymore.

Lords, you are simple-minded. Deal with it.

Researcher, what you put on paper is very nice but the bottom line is the bottom line.

 For toadrick:
You&apos;ve never gotten a supplemental wage payment because you&apos;ve always made more per hour in tips than the tip wage credit allowed in your state.

Not knowing what state you work in(the tip wage credit varies from state to state)it isn&apos;t possible to say here how much of your minimum wage you paid yourself out of that $6.75 an hour you say you make(cash wage plus tips).
Also, you don&apos;t realize it, but the IRS makes you pay income and withholding taxes on all those tips that you make that the IRS says your employer&quot;pays&quot;you towards your full minimum wage. So you pay the taxes on the benefit your employer gets by taking the tip wage credit allowance to lower his business&apos;wage expense.

 An update for toadrick:

You&apos;ve never gotten a supplemental wage payment because you work in a state that prohibits the tip wage credit, and has done so for many years. You get paid your state&apos;s full minimum wage, just like all other wage earners in your state. You&apos;re not penalized for getting tipped by your restaurant&apos;s customers. The states of Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Nevada, Montana and Minnesota also do not allow the tip wage credit.

If the Republicans had kept control of Congress in the last election, your state was one of those targeted to be forced by Congress to allow employers to take a minimum wage credit for employees&apos;tips. Very lucky for you that the Democrats got in instead of the Republicans.

If you really want to know how the tip credit works, just drive over to Arizona and talk to servers there about the employers&apos;tip credit. Talk to them about how it affects their wages. They didn&apos;t before, but now their state allows employers to take a tip wage credit.

&quot;I think it is fair to the McDonald&apos;s employee who took the job at how ever much an hour, with no tips. they made a choice and after all isn&apos;t life all about choices? FAIR, FAIR, FAIR, who gets to decide what is fair? What one person thinks is fair, is not fair to another. That is a matter of opinion, what is fair.&quot;

NO, FAIR means what is TRULY&quot;FAIR&quot;meaning employee A that takes a fast food cashier job makes $6.50/hr with no tips is EXACTLY like a take-out server that makes $2.13/hr. They DO THE SAME TASKS, but get LESS from their employer. The person that is unfair is the EMPLOYER, NOT the CUSTOMER INTIALLY! NO, it&apos;s NOT one&apos;s&quot;OPINION&quot;about what is fair, it&apos;s what is**FACT**that what is truly fair. Fair is that BOTH employees would get paid EXACTLY the SAME AMOUNT for the SAME OR LESS TYPE OF WORK. UNFAIR is the employer paying take-out servers LESS for the SAME OR LESS amount of work through a tip that fast food employees(excluding Sonic Drive-in.&quot;Tipping customers are fair in that they pay workers for doing the SAME AMOUNT OR EVEN LESS AMOUNT OF WORK such as an employee that just bags, puts condiments, utensils, salt&amp;pepper, etc., in a bag and rings it up as well as give change, NEVER, TIP for those type of ACTIONS, because they would be TRULY UNFAIR to the fast food employees that DO TRULY DO those type of actions and sometimes TRULY EVEN MORE WORK! What&apos;s fair is NOT of the&quot;OPINION&quot;of the person, it&apos;s what is FACT! Fact is, if fast food employees(Excluding Sonic Drive-in)were allowed to accept tips, then tipping for take-out would be fair, but since they aren&apos;t, the only thing you can do to be fair is NOT to tip for LESS or the SAME amount of work as a customer. THAT IS TRULY WHAT IS FAIR! IT&apos;S***NOT***AN OPINION, IT IS FACT! WHY CAN&apos;T YOU SEE FACT, because it&apos;s the TRUTH?

&quot;LOA just stick with what your cheapass can afford.&quot;

I CAN afford, the upscale restaurants, but even then, on our anniversary, we had RESERVATIONS and didn&apos;t get greeted for 10 minutes as well as had 2 desserts worth $12 off the check for it. We didn&apos;t complain, they just took it off the check. My point is, ANYWHERE a mess up can happen. Just look at this person&apos;s blog, it says it all:

{http://www.red-shift.net/index.php?p=266,http://www.red-shift.net/index.php?p=266}

&quot;Get the damn order right
Forgetful? Carry a frigging notepad and pencil! At the Chop House, a $40/pp steakhouse here in Denver, Ive gotten sirloin tips when I ordered a steak, beef when I ordered buffalo, and mashed potatoes when I ordered rice.&quot;

This customer got mashed potatoes instead of rice. Think about how STUPID that makes a server look. Come on now, the server wrote it down, so when that SAME SERVER brings the food out, it should EXACTLY MATCH the written order as long as it&apos;s VISABLE WITHOUT TOUCHING THE PERSON&apos;S FOOD.

&quot;Would you eat it?
Look at the plate youre about ready to take to the table. Does it match the order(youve got your notepad, right)? Does it look edible? I sh**you not, an adult waitress at Chilis served us salads with rotten lettuce. Not just a few pieces, mind you, the whole damn salad was rotten. Even worse it was unwashed! There was literally dirt from the field on the plate!&quot;

These say it all. This person that wrote this blog deals with the crap we deal with at restaurants that have some STUPID, LAZY servers that can&apos;t REREAD their pad of paper BEFORE taking the food to the customer wrong and making us customers have to repeat our orders when the food arrives as far as OBVIOUS mistakes go. I am NOT talking about an undercooked steak or something like that a server CAN&apos;T SEE, I am ONLY talking about VISABLE mistakes like wrong entrees, side dishes, missing condiments. You may say why do I go out to eat? Because the times things do go well, it&apos;s a VERY nice experience. I can&apos;t tell the future you know.

At the very upscale restaurants, there are truly STUPID IDIOT SERVERS WHO ARE TOO DAMN****LAZY****TO REREAD THEIR PAD OF PAPER THEY WROTE THE ORDER DOWN ON! Cheap you say to me is stupid. WHY do I have multiple servers talking to us that have had us? It&apos;s because we tip well, because they now they do well and DESERVE it. If they would make lots of mistakes, they know they&apos;d get their tip DECREASED. It&apos;s just COMMON SENSE, LIKE DUH!

Also, for one thing, I truly HARDLY EVER get take-out, but when I have it&apos;s either the cashier didn&apos;t even bother to**LOOK**in the bag or just the simple fact that are doing what FAST FOOD WORKERS(EXCLUDING SONIC DRIVE-IN)DO and they KNOW IT!

I have NEVER gotten car-side-to-go, but if I ever did, I would tip(UMLESS THE FOOD IS SO OBVIOUSLY WRONG), because the server not only BROUGHT the food to me like as if I was in a restaurant, but they also had to ring up my check and either give me change or the credit card slip to sign as well as deal with**WEATHER**issues such as rain. I would tip more if I knew the server would be getting all wet over me, which would be VERY CONSIDERATE. I bet you wouldn&apos;t even considerate that, unless the order would be obviously wrong? Am I right?

&quot;You probably don&apos;t find it necessary to tip a server a brunch, or all you can eat, just because they don&apos;t take a food order from you and bring you your condiments.&quot;

A dollar per person at the most for buffets, due to the server ONLY bringing a soft drink(NO REFILLS DUE TO HUGE DRINK NORMALLY)and also only bringing the check and ringing it up. HALF THE SERVICE OF WHAT IS TRULY*NORMAL*TYPE OF SERVICE. If I serve myself for 99% of my service, WTF SHOULD I TIP SOMEONE 15% for that? GET REAL if you think someone should!

 Lords I give up. You are not human. You go to work to make money. But you don&apos;t care about money. Just your feelings. Okay then on payday you should get a thank you, not a paycheck. Just a thank you. After all you don&apos;t go to work to make money. You don&apos;t even have to work. So we as servers and take out should go to work and pay to be there because the world according to lords is all about just showing up kissing some stupid bitches ass. You need help. Please let me send you some of the pennies(maybe)that I stole from customers. I&apos;m so glad that today I didn&apos;t wait on some freaking scammer like you. I waited on humans that understood the kitchen was busy, the entire restaurant filled in about 30 minutes. We don&apos;t have a to go person so we do that ourselves. You will never ever ever ever act properly in public. That being said... SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Exactly. Thats why it&apos;s a non-issue for 99% of us servers. Now if you&apos;d only UNDERSTAND it.

You misread the original poster. He didn&apos;t say that he made $6.75 an hour. Please reread.

&quot;Also, you don&apos;t realize it, but the IRS makes you pay income and withholding taxes on all those tips that you make that the IRS says your employer&quot;pays&quot;you towards your full minimum wage. So you pay the taxes on the benefit your employer gets by taking the tip wage credit allowance to lower his business&apos;wage expense&quot;.

No, the IRS makes us pay taxes only on our hourly wages plus tips - simple as that. At least that&apos;s the case for 99.9% of restaurant servers. Because we make so much more than minimum wage, restaurants don&apos;t ever have to pay the supplemental(as I said, at least for over 99% of us). Sometimes, restaurant*will*pay a shift differential for certain low earning shifts, but that&apos;s an incentive sort of thing. I know a lot of servers and I&apos;ve never known a server that&apos;s averaged less than $9 or $10 an hour(tips plus hourly, even at 2.13 an hour)over a month&apos;s period, which is the period that DoL considers for the requirement to be a tipped server. Even in the hypothetical case of getting stiffed on a $1000 check that the original postermentioned, that in itself wouldn&apos;t casue the tip credt to be triggered, because the DoL uses a month as the basic measure of figuring tips and wages for the purpose of defining a tipped employee.

&quot;Please let me send you some of the pennies(maybe)that I stole from customers.&quot;

WHY don&apos;t you give them to the people you STOLE them from, huh? Giving them to me would STILL BE SOOOO UNFAIR and you know it. I DON&apos;T want them, because that&apos;s NOT&quot;MY&quot;money, that&apos;s THEIR MONEY.

&quot;I&apos;m so glad that today I didn&apos;t wait on some freaking scammer like you.&quot;

LOOK IN THE MIRROR AT****WHO****IS THE SCAMMER! You OVERCHARGED people for almost 2 weeks, because you didn&apos;t bother to make sure you were charging people correctly. You only cared about the tips you were making, not about their money. Therefore, HOW can you call me a&quot;SCAMMER&quot;when I NEVER&quot;SCAMMED&quot;ANYBODY out of ANYTHING? YOU HAVE, THOUGH!

&quot;That being said... SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

The ONLY reason you are saying that is because you KNOW I am RIGHT about that a to-go server does the SAME or even LESS amount of work that fast food workers(excluding Sonic Drive-in)do. If you had ANY PROOF that I was wrong, you would be writing that, but instead all you have to say is&quot;SHUT UP.&quot;WOW, WHAT A COME BACK! You KNOW I am RIGHT. It&apos;s the TRUTH that putting stuff in a bag and ringing it up as well as giving change or a credit card receipt is EXACTLY like ALL FAST FOOD PLACES(excluding Sonic Drive-in). People should treat people with FAIRNESS by since they NEVER get to tip a McDonald&apos;s employee for hotcakes and sausage, WHY should they tip for a pasta entree to-go when it&apos;s even LESS work for them to do that work for that pasta to-go order? That&apos;s SOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT FAIR to tip for that, but not to tip for more work. WHY can&apos;t you see that it&apos;s the TRUTH?

&quot;I see. Fair is only what YOU think is fair.&quot;

NO, it&apos;s what is TRULY FAIR. Fair means EVEN.

Look at the synonym of fair:
 http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fair 
&quot;Fair implies the treating of all sides alike, justly and equitably&quot;

Treating people&quot;ALIKE&quot;ALL SIDES.

That&apos;s EXACTLY WHAT I AM DOING.*I*as the CUSTOMER, are paying ONLY the people that do MORE work than fast food employees(excluding Sonic-Drive-in). So DON&apos;T tell me it&apos;s ONLY what&quot;I&quot;think is&quot;FAIR&quot;, because it&apos;s REALITY that if I pay ONLY that people that do more work than fast food employees(excluding Sonic-Drive in.), then I am TRULY being FAIR TO ALL EMPLOYEES THAT SERVE ME FOOD TO-GO. Tell me, HOW am I not being fair? It&apos;s the EMPLOYER that isn&apos;t being fair to the to-go servers by not paying them at least $6/hr, NOT the CUSTOMER!

&quot;Take out in a full-service restaurant isn&apos;t fair to the tipped employees that have to take time away from paying(read tipping)customers in order to give you the opportunity to get something other than fast food to eat at home unless you compensate them for it through tips.&quot;

Did I say that was fair? Blame the OWNERS of the restaurants, DON&apos;T blame the customers for that. That&apos;s STILL NO EXCUSE to be UNFAIR by paying a tip to them, but not to a McDonald&apos;s worker is it? NO, it&apos;s NOT!I treat people fairly as a customer. I shouldn&apos;t have to care about if they have other tables to attend to, because that&apos;s NOT what tips are for. When people tip, they tip on******************THEIR******************service, NOT ANYONE ELSE&apos;S SERVICE, THEIRS ONLY!

&quot;BTW, I think that 10% is&quot;acceptable&quot;, but 15% is more appropriate because you are actually paying for the convenience of someone giving you food that you would normally have to sit at a table for.&quot;

If anything, it&apos;s more inconvenient to stand waiting for the food, than to sit. It&apos;s just FASTER in that you can get it right when it&apos;s ready, not having to wait for your server or a food runner to bring it all the way to a table. So if I am not being&quot;BROUGHT&quot;the food to a table and I am standing(making my feet tired)waiting for my food, WHY do you think they deserve a tip just because they aren&apos;t bringing it to my table? If anything, dine-in service at a non-fast food restaurant is more convenient that the customer just has to sit there and the server is doing all the work. That is why people normally tip for dine-in service at non-fast food restaurants. You are WAAAAAY off that it&apos;s somehow more convenient to stand and wait for the food. It&apos;s very INCONVENIENT to do that. I am NOT sure WHERE you get that from that it would be convenient to have to walk futher and stand around waiting to get the food? The server is the one that walks futher and doesn&apos;t make the customer stand if they dine-in at a non-fast food restaurant.

&quot;cheapskates like lords can skate through without tipping.&quot;

It has absolutely**NOTHING**to do with being&quot;CHEAP&quot;, it&apos;s all about paying workers EQUALLY AND FAIRLY. If I don&apos;t tip for bagging my food at McDonald&apos;s, WHY should I at a non-fast food restaurant to-go server to do the same, sometimes even less work that that Mcdonald&apos;s worker? I treat workers EQUALLY, WHY AREN&apos;T YOU FAIR TO EVERYONE that servers you food to-go?

&quot;lords gets her fairness wish and has to pay a surcharge for her take out food.&quot;

Well, that would be the RESTAURANT&apos;S MONEY, so that&apos;s up to the restaurant&apos;s owner. I would MUCH RATHER pay more, than to treat people UNFAIRLY. Don&apos;t you get that? Life is not fair, but SOMETIMES people can MAKE some things in life fair if you try to as much as possible. Like going in order of arrival and not tipping employees for bagging food considering we never tip for that at fast food restaurants(excluding Sonic Drive-in). I treat people with FAIRNESS, YOU OBVIOUSLY DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT BEING FAIR MEANS!

 For teleburst:

Give it up, old man. One of the great problems among wait servers is the misinformation passed around by people like you, stated as fact when it&apos;s nothing but your own personal opinion.

Your post on another thread on this website where you have stated categorically that you know all about the tip wage credit because you&quot;... date an employee who works at a Waffle House...&quot;. That was one of the most utterly ignorant statements about the tip wage credit that I&apos;ve yet to read on any of the websites about wait serving and tipping. And as for&quot;triggering&quot;the tip wage credit? What a laugh! How absurdly ignorant can it be to believe -- as you so obviously do -- that the tip wage credit is an EMPLOYEE benefit!!

The problem with your unsubstantiated, undocumented pontifical statements is that naive servers will take your statements as&quot;fact&quot;-- which IMHO that&apos;s exactly what you want them to believe. That you know it all. When in a previous post of yours which included your usual know it all statements of&quot;fact&quot;, a reply was directed at you that put the simple question&quot;why?&quot;to you for every one of your statements of&quot;fact&quot;... and you never responded.

Your challenge to my statement that tipped employees pay income and withholding taxes on the pseudo wages employers&quot;pay&quot;tipped employees is a case in point. Your challenge, and your basis for that challenge, clearly shows that you have a completely garbled idea of how the employers&apos;tip wage credit works. Thankfully you at least have enough intelligence to state that servers pay taxes on hourly wages plus tips. But evidently you lack the intelligence to comprehend that a part of those tips are used as a credit by employers so they don&apos;t have to pay servers the FULL statutory minimum wage. So in other words, sport, servers pay taxes on tips that are used by their employers as&quot;employer-paid wages&quot;, and those phantom, pseudo wages are&quot;paid&quot;to servers instead of cash. Get it?

You claim you too are a&quot;researcher&quot;-- but you obviously don&apos;t know the first thing about research documentation and substantiation. An evidence of that is your undocumented&quot;extract&quot;you used from a purported Department of Labor publication when you pontificated with your opinion on my statement on tip pools.(FYI, there IS a Department of Labor bulletin that clearly supports my statement. Just keep reading the bulletins and you&apos;ll come across it.)

I&apos;ve read many of Lords_of_Acid&apos;s recent and past posts. They may be long winded and involved, but at least she&apos;s honest in clearly stating HER opinions. She doesn&apos;t try to make you believe that what she believes is universal fact ... as you do in your posts, teleburst.

As for your comment about my rereading toadrick&apos;s statement about his hourly income, I suggest you go back and reread it yourself and get his answer straight in your head, instead of mouthing off like you&apos;re so intent on doing in your replies.

 Lords, you&apos;re excusing your cheap behavior toward takeout servers in the guise of being&quot;fair&quot;. You cheaping out on them is not doing McDonalds employees a favor. You&apos;re just making excuses for being cheap. After all, we know you&apos;ll do anything to save your precious pennies.

Have you no shame for your resorting to ridicule of Lords, putting her down instead of simply stating your reasons for disagreeing with her?

You treat Lords horribly, her opinions disrespectfully, yet you expect everyone else to look upon you and treat your opinions with decency and respect.

 Posted on Sunday, March 11, 2007 - 11:36 am:   
 I&apos;ve obviously pissed off Mr. Hyphenated-Last-Name because I&apos;ve challenged most of his inaccurate statements. I remember the last time I challenged him and he was too afraid to address it because he knew I was right. As to the Waffle House anecdote, at least I was willing to concede that there were possible situations where my previous comments might not apply. Mr. H-L-N can&apos;t being himself to even go THAT far.

&quot;As for your comment about my rereading toadrick&apos;s statement about his hourly income, I suggest you go back and reread it yourself and get his answer straight in your head, instead of mouthing off like you&apos;re so intent on doing in your replies&quot;.

You said, AND I QUOTE:

&quot;&quot;Not knowing what state you work in(the tip wage credit varies from state to state)it isn&apos;t possible to say here how much of your minimum wage you paid yourself out of that $6.75 an hour you say you make(cash wage plus tips)&quot;.

Here is what he actually said:

&quot;I have never been compensated by an employer because i did not make and average of $6.75 an hour, my hourly plus my tips, for the night&quot;.

What he is saying is that he never made just $6.50 an hour. What you are saying is something to the effect of,&quot;An auto worker makes $20 an hour. There&apos;s no telling how much of that she paid herself towards the minimum wage&quot;.

Can&apos;t you understand that it doesn&apos;t matter WHAT the minimum wage is or what a theoretical tip credit is if a server makes MORE than the minimum wage? The tip credit is a safety net that virtually NEVER gets triggered in the restaurant business because no server makes less than minimum wage with tips as averaged over a month.

The tip credit is a way to ensure that the minimum wage is enforced while acknowledging that tipping has become de rigeur in this country.

&quot;You claim you too are a&quot;researcher&quot;

Nope. Never did.

&quot;-- but you obviously don&apos;t know the first thing about research documentation and substantiation&quot;.

See below for evidence of this hypocrisy.

An evidence of that is your undocumented&quot;extract&quot;you used from a purported Department of Labor publication when you pontificated with your opinion on my statement on tip pools.

Stop being disengenous. If you haven&apos;t seen this exact&apos;extract&quot;, you&apos;re lying out of your ass. But in case you aren&apos;t, I&apos;d suggest that you simply type in the words&quot;tip credit&quot;into Google and see what you come up with. Since I suspect that this might be too difficult for you, here&apos;s the link:

 http://www.dol.gov/esa/regs/compliance/whd/whdfs15.htm 

&quot;(FYI, there IS a Department of Labor bulletin that clearly supports my statement. Just keep reading the bulletins and you&apos;ll come across it.)

Ahhhh, NOW we get to undocumented...good show, Holmes. I could reasonably assume that you saw the basic DoL factsheet on the tip credit, since you claim to have extensively researched the subject(although it appears that you do your research by cherry-picking conversations with disgruntled servers). OTOH, I don&apos;t see how I could be expected to read your mind on this one. Feel free to quote from this phantom bulletin if you want...

&quot;The problem with your unsubstantiated, undocumented pontifical statements is that naive servers will take your statements as&quot;fact&quot;-- which IMHO that&apos;s exactly what you want them to believe. That you know it all. When in a previous post of yours which included your usual know it all statements of&quot;fact&quot;, a reply was directed at you that put the simple question&quot;why?&quot;to you for every one of your statements of&quot;fact&quot;... and you never responded&quot;.

I have no idea what you&apos;re referring to. However, I can say that YOU never responded to me when I corrected you about your false statement about a written agreement being required for tip pooling(presumably what you&apos;re referring to when you talk about me quoting the DoL. You went strangly mute, didn&apos;t you, Mr. H-L-N?

&quot;Your challenge to my statement that tipped employees pay income and withholding taxes on the pseudo wages employers&quot;pay&quot;tipped employees is a case in point. Your challenge, and your basis for that challenge, clearly shows that you have a completely garbled idea of how the employers&apos;tip wage credit works.

Get it&quot;?

Nope. Sure don&apos;t. I don&apos;t care what my employer isn&apos;t having to pay. I just care about the bottom line. If giving the employer a break on payroll helps open far more opportunities for employment by allowing far more restaurants to get open and stay open, I&apos;m all for it. Your thought process is similar to the idea that I shouldn&apos;t make more money because then I&apos;d have to pay more taxes. That&apos;s a bass-ackwards way of looking at it.

&quot;I&apos;ve read many of Lords_of_Acid&apos;s recent and past posts. They may be long winded and involved, but at least she&apos;s honest in clearly stating HER opinions. She doesn&apos;t try to make you believe that what she believes is universal fact ... as you do in your posts, teleburst&quot;.

Physician, heal thyself. I&apos;m speaking from the benefit of many years of experience in this biz, in most market niches and from both an hourly ANd a managerial standpoint. I&apos;m upfront about this. OTOH, we know nothing about you or your motivation for your crusade on this issue. I suspect that most of the servers on this board would tend to agree with my outlook on this issue. I suspect that if you actually talked to a wide spectrum of servers in real life, you&apos;d never find a single server who you could document had to have a tip credit applied to their wages to bring their wages up to minimum wage.

 Let&apos;s see. Lords is barely literate and I love reading her free speech for the entertainment value it holds for me. Did you&quot;considerate&quot;that?

She is worthy of ridicule; she actually begs for it in the way she behaves in society. Everyone here laughs at her. She actually says her feet get tired waiting for her takeout and when she gets to a table she wants her drink immediately because she&apos;s thirsty and if she doesn&apos;t get it, the waitperson gets dinged on the tip. She behaves like a two year old. She excuses not tipping for takeout because she doesn&apos;t have to tip McDonalds employees.

I&apos;m not ashamed of ridiculing Lords. She&apos;s disgusting. She&apos;s the person we all see and look away because it&apos;s just too hard to believe.

Are you her cousin?

 &quot;Your post on another thread on this website where you have stated categorically that you know all about the tip wage credit because you&quot;... date an employee who works at a Waffle House...&quot;.

I meant to add that, as a researcher, you should either use quotes to quote exactly, or at least paraphrase my quote properly.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Oh yeah, I guess name calling is something that you now find acceptable.

No, she just says over and over again IT&apos;S THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT!!!!!

Much like a two year old.

Nobody here agrees with her, but what she believes is supposed to be the truth and we&apos;re supposed to know it.

LOL

 My husband is a heavy equipment operator and makes $35.00 an hour. Does this mean every operator in the world should make that amount of money? Otherwise it wouldn&apos;t be fair.
I believe that it is fair to fast food employees, that is a fact.I dont care how many capitols or asterisk you use.
Researcher:
&quot;THAT IS TRULY WHAT IS FAIR! IT&apos;S***NOT***AN OPINION, IT IS FACT! WHY CAN&apos;T YOU SEE FACT, because it&apos;s the TRUTH?&quot;
Tell me that is not an inflammatory question. Lords frequently calls people stupid and lazy. I am afraid she has earned every insult. You have not noticed how combative she is when others dont agree with her? If you had read my post you may take note I was certainly undeserving of this derogatory innuendo. Lords lashes out like a small spoiled child. Complete with her infantile style of writing. Formerly Jammie

 researcher, while you have a thorough understanding of tip credit, you seem to be confused as to which part of your argument is fact and which part is your opinion.

The fact is that server wages are split between a portion paid by the restauranteur and a portion made up by tips equivalent to State and Federal minimum wage. If the tip portion does not equate to minimum wage then the restauranteur must pay the full minimum wage him/herself.

Where your opinion gets blended in is the insistence that the Server pays the other share of the tip credit. In doing this You are purposely misconstruing the law. No where in the any wage and hour law do the words&quot;Servers shall make up the remaining portion of their minimum wage through tips&quot;exist. All the law says is that tips will make up the portion of wage.

One could just as easily say - and many, many, many, do - that the customers have to pay the other portion of the Restauranteurs wage. I have no problem with anything you say about the actual tip credit, I think your research is admirable. I find it disengenous to that you continually apply your opinion that&quot;Servers Pay their own Minimum Wage&quot;, to the rest of your argument. Thanks

 i see people are still arguing for the take out tipping...i am still impressed with people&apos;s mentality...if you walk it to my car i&apos;ll give you a $1...WOW thanks for your generosity. why don&apos;t you keep your crappy $1 and open your thick head and realize that just because you see me walking your crappy bag to your car, doesn&apos;t mean that that is all of what happens. do you think a phone operator takes your order. do you think a machine in the back packs it, throws everything you asked for in the bag, and then i just pick it up and pray i give you the right food. yeah...still impressed with how people have an excuse to be cheap, but still demand, demand, demand.

you think you don&apos;t have to tip for take out, don&apos;t order to go. order from a fast food place. if you order take out because you can&apos;t eat in because you can&apos;t tip...again GO TO A FAST FOOD. i don&apos;t work for free, and yes i make my money with tips. i make an average of 15% of my sales. yes i make decent money. most of my customers are regulars that have been using our take out for a while. do i still complain about cheap people, yes. no one likes working for free. i don&apos;t either.

no one else answers the phone to take your order, i explain the menu to you over and over again, while you decide on the phone what is exactly what you want. i wait with you on the line while you ask the other people in the area what do they want to order, while i explain dressings and sides all over again...all of this while my phone keeps ringing with other impatient people that want to order. or while people are outside seating in their car waiting for me to bring their food out.

no there is not a take out computer that bags your food and gets all of your extras. i do that. i get your 4 sides of dressing, your 3 loafs of bread, your sides, your toppings; i pack your food when it comes out, i label the boxes so that you do not get confused trying to figure out what is what. i make sure you 3 salads have romaine only, no tomatoes, extra croutons, add bacon, add egg. i make sure you have extra steak sauce. i try to make sure the kitchen cooked what you ordered right.

no one else bags the other orders. i bag them all. if i have 20 orders at the same time, i have to take care of 20 orders at the same time. when you sit down at a restaurant, usually servers have 3-5 tables. they divide your service into those tables. i can have 25 orders in half an hour. all of which have to be ready by the time i quoted. if they are not ready i have to make sure i don&apos;t leave the customer their standing because well some people do not know how to wait. i deal with idiots that don&apos;t under5stand that just because you order take out doesn&apos;t mean your food will be ready in 2 minutes. they still cook it just like if you came in to eat.

now what happens to those wonderful non-tippers. of course they are demanding. they want their food ready as fast as possible. they want extra, EXTRA everything, they want their boxes labeled of course. if they have a $100 order you don&apos;t expect them to open box per box to figure out what is what. do i bother. NO. are you paying me for the service you think you are entitled to. no. why should i give you extra if you are not giving me extra. sure you got all your food, but i didn&apos;t have time to label it. sure you got 1 dressing per salad, but i didn&apos;t have time to get extra. of course you got bread; one for 6 people and it got cold. you needed steak sauce and ketchup, but honestly i forgot. you needed no croutons on 3 of the salads, but i forgot as well, i mean i am sure that since you can&apos;t tip you can take out the damn croutons yourself. why didn&apos;t i have time...simply because i dedicate my service and my time to the people that deserve it. the people that deserve it know and understand that i work take care of them.

sure i see that i will get flamed by a lot of people. they will say that i have a service to give. i give it, i just give it very differently depending on the customers. i have been doing this for 4 years. i chose to do it, the job is convenient and it pays the bills. yes i went to school, yes i finished a career, and yes i chose to do this for the time being. i am the main take out person and have been for the past 3 years. regular customers love me, cheap jerks not so much.

oh and lords, again GET HELP...yes i work for money and no i don&apos;t really care about feelings. yes you can call me selfish and whatever you want...um i don&apos;t really care. i care about my normal customer needs, my regulars and the new customers that are normal. all of those that are disrespectful, jerks, and of course demanding and cheap can go rot in hell. i could care less for your 13 sides of ranch, your need to have extra extra bbq sauce, or if your food is hot. yes i am mean and selfish, and in ocassion rude...to those that deserve it, of course.

 For those who work take-out....how much does your restaurant require for you declare in tips? Also...how much does the restaurant pay you per hour when you work take-out?

 I can&apos;t resist, I have to throw in my two cents. Though I tip anywhere from 10-20% for take-out, I resent it. Where do we draw the line on tipping? The ladies at Macy&apos;s wrap my jeans in tissue paper, put them in a bag and take my credit card for payment. I am not expected to tip them, so why should we tip people in a restaurant for the same thing? I would much prefer that a service charge be clearly added onto the bill. I&apos;m not saying that I don&apos;t think the person packaging my food doesn&apos;t deserve to be paid fairly. What causes resentment for me is that I always overtip, because I am a generous person and I know how hard we all work. If the tip was included, then I could expect the same service and not have to make up for the cheap clientele.

It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t expect the employees to make good money(these jobs are hard physically, emotionally and intellectually), but I think it would make everyone feel more comfortable if the pay of the employees comes from their employer. I have worked in the service industry for over 25 years and I resent that I have to feel like a charity case to make my living. The generosity or not of the patrons determines my paycheck. As many of you have so eloquently pointed out, there are cheap people who use all kinds of excuses for not tipping fairly. I pray for the day that all tips are included in the price of the goods, so that customers or&quot;guests&quot;don&apos;t have to do the math and do not have the unfair advantage of cheating their server.

The whole tipping system exists so that the owners of the bars and restaurants can offer lower prices, leaving their employees at the mercy of the customers for their pay. This is grossly unfair and why so many cheat and steal from the employers, which is not right either, but is the result of an unfair system. The argument that employees won&apos;t provide good service if they are guaranteed their tip is 100% wrong. If a server doesn&apos;t perform, then they should lose their job, just like in any other profession.

I see how confused some customers are about what is proper, which is also an unpleasant aspect for them. If tips were included(service charges), then there wouldn&apos;t be a need for all of this debate. It is a broken system that needs to be updated to reflect the times we live in, where not all people can be trusted to do the honorable thing. Some are just ignorant and some are just cheap.

I am sensitive to everyone&apos;s arguments here, so please don&apos;t feel insulted if we disagree. Most importantly, I am very much in support of EVERYONE making a decent and fair living, no matter what their job is. My biggest resentment is that(not all, but most of)the owners of these establishments are driving expensive cars, living in mansions and sending their kids to private schools, while the employees are cleaning up the vomit and working for charity. I refuse to support businesses that pay their employees minimum wage and have a CEO who earns hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars a year. We need to wake up to see that our country is becoming the very rich and the very poor. Which are you?

 nocharity, I agree with a lot of what you said.

I don&apos;t resent tipping for takeout because having worked both retail and multiple restaurant positions, as much as we&apos;d like to equate them, wrapping my Macy&apos;s/Target/Costco purchases isn&apos;t the same as putting together a takeout order. It&apos;s not the same amount of service as a table in the dining room, but it is a service beyond fast food and retail.

However, I am totally on-board with your points about tipping vs. real living wages. Tipping works for most restaurant owners, and most servers think it works for them(because ultimately the good servers make okay money)but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s fair or right. There may have been a time when tipping truly worked, and even was the right thing, but as we progress to a service economy, I agree that it is no longer.

Serving could even be seen as a profession rather than a second class job if we began paying servers an actual wage and eliminating tipping or making it 100% optional. Thomas Keller is doing it with Per Se and so far it has been successful all around.(The menu and the check include a line saying&quot;Service included.&quot;There is an additional line on the credit card receipt for&quot;Additional Gratuity&quot;but it&apos;s clearly stated that it&apos;s not expected. It&apos;s only in case of really extraordinary service, and from what I have heard -- all secondhand -- probably less than a quarter of the guests do tip additionally, and usually when the restaurant truly did go above and beyond what a restaurant can reasonably be expected to do...)

But, until it&apos;s law, the average restaurant owner isn&apos;t going to get on board because it will ultimately cost him far too much money. And the NRA is a strong enough lobby(not as strong as the other NRA, but strong enough)to make sure that the law never passes. We&apos;re sort of in a standstill until enough servers begin to turn on the system and demand $10-$20/hour in actual wages vs. tips.

And I think we&apos;re probably 20 years from that happening. Not that it&apos;s right, just reality.

Sometimes I even feel like a hypocrite because I 100% agree with you that we have moved beyond the useful life of tipping, but still tip, and in most cases I overtip. But I just can&apos;t punish the people doing the hard work because we have an inequitable system.

I just wish I knew how to provoke the change, you know?

 You low Applebees servers may demand $10-$20/hour in wages... but a switch to hourly pay would severely hamper most servers.

I make $25-$30 regularly, often times more. But obviously no restaurant will pay that to servers and pay $11/hr to the cooks. There will be a balance, they would drop me to $15/hour or so.

We get great wages BECAUSE of the tipping system, so as I understand your points, it&apos;s NOT in the best interest of the servers to abolish the system. I think it&apos;s well known that servers get fairly inflated wages compared to most positions, why do you think that is?

 Low Applebee&apos;s servers??? I&apos;ve never worked at Applebee&apos;s. Heck, the last time I served, I regularly walked with $40/hour during dinner shifts. Lunch shifts were more like $8-10 because I usually closed lunch(working 6 hour shifts)and walked with $50-$60.

That&apos;s a really condescending thing to say; that you&apos;re*not lowly*because you make more money. Most servers in cities with average costs of living are not making $40K/year - the equivalent of just under $20/hour. Most are making a lot less... It would be the minority who would be&quot;harmed.&quot;

But, that&apos;s not the point. My point is that it&apos;s not only about what is in the best interest of the restaurant owners, or a very few number of servers. It&apos;s what is*right*- right now a lot of servers are making a lot more money than they pay taxes on(not*right*)and many don&apos;t have the benefits that normally waged jobs have. Some of those are making a lot less money than their hard work is worth, and some are making a lot more money than they really&quot;should&quot;. Some are cheating the system, and others are getting cheated by the system.

Serving will never be viewed as a professional job as long as the compensation system is based on tipping. Good service is just as important as good food, but the only people who are professionally compensated are the cooks and chefs.

So, sure, if you&apos;re only concern is you*personally*getting ahead, you don&apos;t want a real wage. If you&apos;re concern is having an equitable system - for servers, restaurant owners and the public at large, real wages make more sense...

At Per Se, the waiters do not receive this service charge and it is divided up among many members of staff. The restaurant uses your gratuity to pay lots of other employees. The waiters only receive the additional gratuity left by the minority of guests that do leave extra. I have read that there is constant turnover for the waitstaff there because ultimately waiters will not wait on people with ultra fine dining standards for crappy money. So, now people are forced to pay for service and it just goes into the restaurant&apos;s pocket further; the restaurant still expects the customers to pay the waitstaff even though it is charging a service charge. Problem solved? Not.

What I think is often missing in the argument of whether tipping should exist and whether tipping should be non existent is the varying degrees of service possible. People say if tipping was abolished and either a service charge be automatically added or it should just be included in the cost of the food, then service would deteriorate. The argument against that is that if the server gave unacceptable service they would be fired; they want to keep their jobs. No one talks, though, of the difference between just acceptable,&quot;okay&quot;non-fireable service and good or great service. There is such a difference.

I went to McDonald&apos;s recently and asked what were the main ingredients in something are; the cashier thought for a moment, shrugged, said she had no idea and then stood in silence with a sheepish grin on her face. There was no offer to go find out nor was she a person who cared in the least. Is she fired for not knowing a menu item at all(when she serves the freaking thing every day)? No. She was doing her job- ringing me up- just, just competently. When I go to a decently priced restaurant and ask a waiter what a dish is, a good waiter can describe it. A competent waiter will go find out if they do not know. Rarely have I been left staring at a person who stands with a sheepish grin on their face shrugging. If I was paid a flat hourly rate, would I really care to know the menu and the food descriptions so well or do you think a waiter is going to care to learn about wine to help you decide on which red will be the most appropriate accompaniment to your veal dish? I worked at a Pan Asian restaurant that was a little funkier than the people in the area were used to. It was like a Manhattan restaurant in a NJ suburb. People in NJ are not used to items like black and blue honey glazed tuna, it was way trendier than they were used to, but they all wanted to feel like they are eating exotic food. Every table wanted me to stand there for 10 minutes describing every dish and helping them decide every single part of their meal; I had to describe and help the table pick appetizers, encourage their entree selections and pick the best desserts, I even would have to help them pick out what teas to drink. Rarely could I ever just take an order without this whole long process. If I was paid $10 to 12 an hour, I can guarantee you I would not have been so freaking knowledgable or enthusiastic or helpful and would have just said&quot;I&apos;m not sure&quot;or&quot;It&apos;s all good.&quot;The only thing that made me stand there for several minutes describing all those dishes in great detail at just about every single table is the hope for 20% for my services. I would make sure people had share plates for their appetizers. If I was not receiving a tip and I didn&apos;t feel like bothering to bring them sharing plates, do you think I would be fired? Please. They got their food and had utensils, right? I made sure everyone was happy and giddy and gay with their meals and had everything they needed. I really wouldn&apos;t try so hard if I was paid a moderate wage. I would be very mediocre and I wouldn&apos;t lose my job for it. My tables would just have to settle for a lower standard.

Would I remember at the end of the meal that you told me an hour and a half ago that it is Aunt Sally&apos;s birthday and you wanted a surprise piece of cake and singing? What if I forgot? Would that be a fire-able offense? Would I bring you that refill before you ask? Do you think I&apos;d be fired for not bringing that automatic refill before your glass was more than half empty? Or, what if you asked for a refill and I forgot it until the end of your meal when I suddenly remembered? Would I be fired for that? No. Without the possible tip at the end, you wouldn&apos;t get any kind of caring service 90% of the time. Or, you would get good service only at expensive upscale places where they would pay waiters more; kind of like a place like Saks Fifth Avenue is going to give you stupendous customer service because what you are buying costs you an arm and a leg and they pay their employees more than say K- Mart. So, only the really expensive places would offer great service and care that you receive it.

I once went to crapplebees and no offense to anyone who works there, but I got a waiter who really couldn&apos;t care less, he may as well be asleep. He didn&apos;t know if there were mushrooms in a stir fry when I asked and then just decided that no it doesn&apos;t have mushrooms. When I got my food, not only were there mushrooms, but they were diced up into smithereens so I couldn&apos;t just take them out. After sitting for several minutes with no waiter in sight, I had to go to the bartender to ask her to get my server. I informed him politely that there were indeed mushrooms to which his reply was,&quot;Well, I asked the cooks and they said there weren&apos;t any.&quot;Well, gee, that just solves that. There was not an offer to get me anything else and there he was standing with a sheepish grin, shrugging his shoulders and standing in silence. Would he get fired for such a thing if I complained? No, don&apos;t be ridiculous. I don&apos;t expect much more from a place like Applebees or a cheap, inexpensive chain because I know the servers are not making a killing there and they aren&apos;t going to get the most motivated, best servers to work and stay there, just like McDonalds. What could I do? I gave him a rare for me 13% tip(we never saw him again and had to ask the bartender to search for him to get our check). We were his only table so it was not because he was swamped. I fear that if tipping was abolished and we paid waiters a flat wage say $12 an hour, everyone would be like that freaking waiter. We would all have to settle for mediocrity and there would be nothing we could do about it.

I wait on long lines at the supermarket and no one is moving any faster or putting more cashiers on. There is nothing you can do about it. I wait on long lines at McDonald&apos;s and the manager doesn&apos;t seem to be making any apologies or giving out freebies for my inconvenience. People when they sit in a restaurant expect everything right now and when they don&apos;t get it in the timely manner they expect, they complain and it&apos;s often instantly corrected. I think tipping for service gives the customers an edge and lets them have higher expectations. I think many Americans just take so much for granted. Everyone expects so much when they go out to eat, rarely do people actively appreciate when things go really smoothe and well; it&apos;s par for the course. I think the par would change drastically without a tip dangling over my head.
I have heard, for example, that in Europe where waiters receive a standard flat wage and an ocassional 5 to 10% extra tip, that the service is just horrendous. People who I know have told me they waited and waited forever for anything in a restaurant.

When I go to get gas, they have one attendant handling like 10 pumps. I sit there and watch the guy mosey on back to the credit card machine in the office, taking his sweet time. He could have put the nozzle in someone&apos;s car and started them off on his way, but why should he? Does the gas station put more than one guy on? No, that would cost more money. Does this guy get fired when I am left waiting for eternity? No. No one surely cares when he goes to another car before me who got there after me. If restaurants paid waiters a competitive wage, how many servers do you think they would have on the floor if now servers are costing them money? One server having only 3 tables? HA HA HA. How much do you think the restaurant would care if you had to wait more than 45 seconds for a greeting or more than 2.5 minutes for your drinks to be delivered? We&apos;d all be sitting thirsty and hungry watching one server have 12 tables moseying on at his own pace coming to us when he felt like it. And, we&apos;d all be paying for it anyway!

I&apos;d rather tip well when I receive good service rather than be forced to pay for service that sucks or is mediocre at best!
The problem is people want the best of both worlds: they want great fantastic service and food at cheap prices and they don&apos;t want to pay for it. One way or another, you are going to pay for it because no one gives you something for nothing.

 Great recap, Scarlet.

About this though:

&quot;I have heard, for example, that in Europe where waiters receive a standard flat wage and an ocassional 5 to 10% extra tip, that the service is just horrendous. People who I know have told me they waited and waited forever for anything in a restaurant&quot;.

Based on my 7 years in Germany, I&apos;d have to say that service is horrible only by&quot;American standards&quot;. Dining out there is more of a special occasion sort of thing and they use it more as a social occasion where the company is as important as the act of eating. They plan on long dinners and don&apos;t like to be rushed. So when an American goes over there, they think it&apos;s poor service when in actuality, it&apos;s just a more leisurely paced environment. It&apos;s also the way that they can get away with paying a good salary because they don&apos;t have to staff as intensely as we do. Many restaurants only have a couple of servers for the entire restaurant.

Hell, in Germany, it takes exactly 7 minutes to pour the perfect glass of pilsner. Seriously. They pour it so that half the glass is head and they scrape off the extra dome over the top of the glass. Then they let it sit and repeat several times until the head is perfect. Apparently, this is the optimum way to pour a pils, and people are suspicous if a bartender can do it in a minute or two. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a cultural thing or a scientific thing(with Germans&apos;pragmatism and belief in the rational, I suspect the latter). I think it has something to do with the quality and texture of the head.

I&apos;ve told this story before but when my ex brought her mom here and we went to a German restaurant, she was amused by a group&apos;s obvious discomfort as they had to wait at the door to be seated. After about 2 minutes, they were anxiously looking around. The thing is, the restaurant(in Memphis, BTW)was totaly German style. They only had a couple of waitresses, who also had the responsibility of seating people, just like in the old country. We overheard them grousing when they were FINALLY sat(after about 4 minutes&lt;chuckle&gt;)and Sonya turned to me and whispered,&quot;Americans. So impatient. Can&apos;t they see that the poor waitress is busy&quot;?

And over there, it&apos;s traditional to simply round off the bill to the next even amount. If your bill was DM98, you&apos;d leave DM100. Or if it were DM 36, you&apos;d leave DM40.

 For takeout, a couple of bucks... If you made me wait for my food while it&apos;s been sat there on the counter getting cold, you&apos;ll get zip.

 I do not understand why someone would tip for takeout, though what people want to do with their money really isn&apos;t any of my business. I am not going to pay for service that I am not receiving. I understand that someone or someones had to do work to take my order, prepare the food, and box/sack it up. That is true whether we are talking Outback or McDonalds. I don&apos;t tip either one.

 Ummm....hey Johnny come lately, or Kelly, whatever your name is.... try to reread this thread so we don&apos;t have to go over this with people every 7 posts. McDonalds workers are paid minimum wage. Outback take out workers are usually not. Most restaurant take out people are still paid the server pay. Not all, but most that I know. And at McDonalds you can&apos;t possibly be serious with equating the service with a sit down restaurant that you are getting take out from. So if you can acknowledge this:
&quot;I understand that someone or someones had to do work to take my order, prepare the food, and box/sack it up&quot;
Then try to also consider the new information that the payscale for both is not the same. Most people tip for take out. Ask the take out workers. &quot;and yeah...why don&apos;t you go ahead and come in on Sunday, too...get a jump on the week, k?&quot;

&quot;McDonalds workers are paid minimum wage. Outback take out workers are usually not.&quot;

WHY should HOW MUCH THEY MAKE MATTER? Its NOT fair if I dont tip the McDonalds cashier to do even MORE WORK or the SAME AMOUNT OF WORK, but then tip a to-go server to pick up my order inside. Fast food cashiers DO DESERVE a tip too, but since we arent ALLOWED TO, I will choose to be FAIR TO EVERYONE. The fact is, the EMPLOYER is the person not playing FAIR. WHY should the CUSTOMER play unfair by tipping lets say for 2 pasta entrees at Applebees as well as 2 soft drinks, but NOT tip 2 orders of hotcakes and sausage and coffee(some McDonalds DO NOT have SELF-SERVE drink areas)when a customer goes inside to get the food and drinks to-go? LOOK WHO DID THE**MOST WORK**! The MCDONALDS CASHIER DID. The CASHIER had to put INDIVIDUAL utensils in a bag, had to get at least 2 butters and 2 syrups as well as some jelly packets for the sausage(which I eat jelly with my sausage when I get that, just as a LOT of people do). The cashier rung my order up and gave me change. The to-go server at Applebees rings me up and gives me change also. They put the boxes in a bag and if they ended up having to box the pasta, thats still just as much work as getting those condiments at McDonalds for the customer. They had to put the all-in-one convenient bag of utensils w/napkin and salt n pepper packets. So tell me this, HOW IS WHAT*******SERVICE*******I AM RECEIVING***ANY***DIFFERENT THAN THIS MCDONALDS EXAMPLE? People tip on the SERVICE they receive, NOT the fact that to-go servers make less money any hour.

Also, I have read online, at some places like Chilis, the person stated a to-go server makes $7/hr when they are a TO-GO SERVER according to THIS person on THIS message board at their Chilis.

I currently work for Chilis, and this is how it goes:

Hostess: starts at 7.50 an hour
Busser: 2.80 an hour+2.5% of the restraunts total sales during their shift, split between any bussers clocked in.(the later comes directly out of the servers tips)
Server: 2.15 an hour+tips.
Cook: Starts at 8.50 an hour.
Bartender: Hourly wage and gets a portion of their sales.
Expo: Hourly wage and gets tipped out by servers.

TOGO: 7.00 per hour+their own tips(not tipped out by servers)

So GEE, SOME of these TO-GO servers get paid MORE than MINIMUM WAGE.

WHO HONESTLY CARES HOW MUCH THEIR EMPLOYER IS PAYING THEM WHEN THE SERVICE CONTAINS THE SAME OR LESS AMOUNT OF WORK? That is NOT the CUSTOMER&apos;S CONCERN. The customer&apos;s concern is getting their food and bill correct. For instance, we all tip servers because they do WAY THE HELL MORE WORK than a to-go server that you pick up your food inside. People tip according to the SERVICE they receive, NOT go by HOW MUCH they are making. GET REAL! Like I really care if they are making $2.13 or $7/hr. Starbucks employees make at least $6.50/hr for sure, because my sister-in-law worked there a few years ago. I feel even though she was getting at least that much money per hour, that still doesnt mean that someone that works there that makes a frappuccino is giving me LESS SERVICE than a BARTENDER DOES. WHO CARES IF SHE WAS MAKING THAT MUCH? She still deserved a $1 tip just as the norm for a mixed drink such as a margarita is $1/drink at a bar. She would have given me the SAME EXACT SERVICE. She just happened to be paid more than some bartenders do from her employer. That still DOESNT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CUSTOMER BEING FAIR TO EVERYONE THAT MAKES DRINKS whether they are alcoholic drinks or not or whether the person making the drink is making $5/hr(bartenders may make only $5/hr)or $7/hr(by now Starbucks employees may make that much)shouldnt matter what they make, whch that has NOTHING to do with the QUANTITY AND QUALITY of SERVICE you are RECEIVING.

I will say it one more time: WHO CARES HOW MUCH THEIR EMPLOYERS PAY THEM IF I AM RECEIVING THE**SAME**OR EVEN***LESS***SERVICE FROM THEM THAN MOST FAST FOOD EMPLOYEES DO FOR NO TIP WHAT-SO-EVER! It tip on SERVICE, NOT on HOW MUCH the person is making. So do most people.

 http://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=470548 

Look at this website. Look at ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT DONT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT.

BottomFeeder said Theres no point in doing so since all this person did was wrap up my food that someone else made for me, and thats it.

Kaiser said Tipping on take-out? Why, because you carried the styrofoam containers from the kitchen and bagged them for me?

SDscooby said Agreed, I dont tip on take-out. Thats just ridiculous.

Incorporeal said I dont tip for takeout, I tip about 20%+when I eat in though.

Hunter S. Thompson said And no I dont tip if I get take out. If someone delivers it then I will.

Stitkacik said Takeout = no tip.

nhluhr said This means no tips for Takeout.

Eric Anderson said And I NEVER do for takeout.

 http://www.fohguild.org/forums/general/29367-take-out-tipping.html?highlight=tip ping+take-out 

Cadrid said the only people really working with to-go food are the chefs whom wouldnt see a dime of the money if I tipped.

Zuuljin said I actually had one of the servers tell me that I forgot to tip him when I made a pickup. I told him that I didnt forget, I just dont tip for take out and he said that I should tip regardless. I then asked him if he gives a 10%-15% tip whenever he picks up his food at a drive through at a fast food place. He said no, and I told him, Exactly and just walked out.
If your going to apply a tip, might as well apply it universally right? If you tip at a restaurant for takeout, then tip the guy behind the counter at McDonalds or burger king. They both did just as much work getting your food to you.

My point EXACTLY just as I pointed out in my post above this post. It should be treated just like getting food to-go at McDonalds or Burger.

Goldenrod said: since you only typically get at most 10 orders at a given shift, you are left with a lot of free time.

So you mean to tell me they are not even working hard at times? Like they should get tipped for that? GET REAL!

Also look at another thing this person said: they also boosted your hourly pay from 3.50 up to 6.50 an hour

So I just proved 2 different people saying their pay was INCREASED when they did to-go orders.

Goldenrod also said The fact that people generally dont tip the servers who take your order over the phone, enter it into the computer, take it when it is finished cooking and wrap it and bag it,

So see, if MOST people see it as FANCY FAST FOOD TO-GO then obviously it TRULY IS JUST THAT! The main difference is that the food is higher in price. WHO CARES if I am taking away time from them serving other tables that are inside? That has NOTHING to do with the service I am receiving. Looks like in Goldenrods case, the to-go servers dont even serve tables during their to-go shifts.

Findar said in major chains they usually pay the person working drive through a higher wage(minimum)to compensate for the lack of volume in business this employee would normally deal with.

Confirmed again, that a lot of restaurants give their servers a higher pay during their to-go shifts.

Isnt it COMMON SENSE that a lot of these chain restaurants INCREASE the to-go servers pay in that customers arent truly expected to be tipping them, so that is why the restaurant is willing to pay them a decent hourly wage, because they wont be getting tips for the most part? Seriously, just think about that.

Just read some of the people that wrote on this forum, because A LOT of them, say they DO NOT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT. The ones that do, truly arent being FAIR to fast food cashiers. If I tip the to-go server at Chilis, I should also tip the Wendys cashier. WHATS FAIR IS FAIR! Just because some employers dont pay their to-go servers as much as fast food cashiers get DOESNT mean the CUSTOMER should have to treat people UNFAIRLY. These fast food cashiers do less or the same work as the to-go servers do, plain and simple!

&quot;Most people tip for take out.&quot;

As far as this statement, it is truly FALSE! MOST people DO NOT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT!

THE ONLY REASON to tip for take-out would be if the server delivers the food to your car, THAT IS IT! I am willing to bet the&quot;MOST PEOPLE THAT TIP&quot;are the group that get their food delivered to their cars, NOT them going to pick it up inside.

&quot;Then try to also consider the new information that the payscale for both is not the same.&quot;

Again, that&apos;s NOT the&quot;CUSTOMER&apos;S PROBLEM&quot;is it? That is between the EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE! WHY treat people unfairly? So Jane Doe serves me take-out at Applebee&apos;s by giving me an entree to-go. Jane Doe also works at McDonald&apos;s as well and sometimes even does more work than Applebee&apos;s, but doesn&apos;t receive tip money from customers for her extra work. Is that fair? HELL NO! So WHY be UNFAIR to tip one person who does the same or less work, but not to tip the other just because of what they do or don&apos;t get paid per hour? That shouldn&apos;t be the customer&apos;s concern. It&apos;s truly NOT the customer&apos;s business what they make per hour. As I stated before, it looks like some or maybe all Chili&apos;s gives their employees at least minimum wage or better. So unless you would ask the person, you wouldn&apos;t know. They may lie to you also to get a tip.

We consider when we dine in at a restaurant to tip, because the server is doing MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MORE WORK than a take-out employee does. Servers bring our food to our tables, get us refills, bring and ring up our checks, check on us, etc. THAT is WHY we consider the wage they make. When people get take-out, we don&apos;t get all of that extra service. We actual get sometimes even LESS service than a McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, or Burger King employee provides. I treat people EQUALLY, WHY DON&apos;T YOU? Just because their EMPLOYER may not be treating them equally doesn&apos;t make it your problem to pay the rest? If you pay them more to do the same or less amount of work, then you aren&apos;t treating EVERYONE that that does that type of work EQUALLY. If ALL fast food places accepted tips, that&apos;s one thing, then I would say of course, tip, but they don&apos;t, so what&apos;s fair is fair from the CUSTOMER. The EMPLOYER is the person not being fair. As I stated before, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;THEY GET PAID PER HOUR?

I did read some, though not all, of this extremely long thread, and I did see the discussion on how those that pack the meals for takeout are compensated. To be blunt - I don&apos;t care. That is a discussion that needs to happen between the server/sacker and their employer. I have read over and over again that waiters/waitresses deserve tips because of the service they provide. I don&apos;t get that service when I pickup takeout and I am not going to pay for something I don&apos;t receive.

I am absolutely serious about equating the service from a sitdown restaurant with McDonalds. I place my order either over the phone or at a drive up window. Someone cooks the food(or, in the case of McDonalds - has already cooked/heated the food). Someone packages that food and gives it to me. I pay for it.

I am not about to equate the quality of the of food - but that is paid for separately.

I understand that someone has to do work for my order to turn into food that I will take home. I also understand that doing that work is someone&apos;s job - they are not doing it as a favor to me. The payscale is a matter between the server and restaurant.

Ask the take out workers? Of course they think they deserve more money. Ask almost anyone doing almost any job and they will tell you that they&quot;deserve&quot;more money. Ask a pro baseball player that makes 10s of millions of dollars a year and he will tell you he deserves more. It doesn&apos;t change the fact that I do not get the service I would get if I were dining in the restaurant, and I will therefore not pay as if I am.

 Okay, Kelly. Do you enjoy extra extra extra ranch? Do you like said ranch to get nice and warm by having it come out 15 minutes before the food - so I don&apos;t forget about it? If I did forget, would you sulk and say I was uncaring? I&apos;m starting to think so.
I will now refer to posts by the two of you fragile minded gals as Kelly/Lards. Since you both seem to have the same moronic rationalizations, its easier to post to you both at the same time.
Kelly/Lards, yelling&apos;you no play fair!&apos;in your posts reminds me that you have the intellect of a tennis ball, and the emotional maturity of a rock. I glanced at the large type that said GOO GOO GAH GAH NO TIP GAH GAH PLAY FAIR SNIFFLE SNIFFLE GAH or whatever it was and stopped reading. Kelly/Lards, why don&apos;t you try educating yourself to something besides your file clerk job or binging and purging. I have never had a friend that didn&apos;t know how to tip and why we tip. I mean, I&apos;m amazed at the people who&apos;s parents just completely failed when it came to instilling class or social graces. Sorry to be blunt, but honestly, its disgraceful. Really shameful.
But since you are both a little weak in the reading comprehension department I should expect the poor social skills. I think that kind of thing may go hand in hand, like Kelly and Lards.
 &quot;and yeah...why don&apos;t you go ahead and come in on Sunday, too...get a jump on the week, k?&quot;

I NEVER have made my self throw up. That is totally disguisting.

Also, isn&apos;t interesting you have NO COME BACK for what I&apos;ve said? That&apos;s because you KNOW I am telling the GOD&apos;S TRUTH when I say customers are receiving the SAME SERVICE OR EVEN LESS SERVICE when they pickup their food at the counter, whether it would be McDonald&apos;s or Applebee&apos;s. You have NO come back, because you DON&apos;T HAVE ONE. PROVED YOU WRONG, IDIOT!

 I have a come back.

The take out food you get at a full-service restaurant is not, for all intents and purposes, intended to be&quot;taken out.&quot;Restaurants offer this option because it&apos;s a way of bringing in more quick money.

Since this food is not really meant to be taken out, there is more prep work for a to-go order. The food is, oftentimes, transfered directly from a plate to a container. The kitchen doesn&apos;t change their routine, but the servers do. We are made to do extra work rather than just expo&apos;ing the food and running it out to the dining room.

So, that being said, a To-Go&quot;Specialist&quot;at an Applebee&apos;s or Chili&apos;s may or may not be getting paid sub minimum wages. It varies from chain to chain and from state to state. I can testify that the to-go people at my old Applebee&apos;s used to get paid $5.00 an hour, less than state min. wage.

This said To-Go&quot;Specialist&quot;doesn&apos;t have tables to deal with, but they have a list of phone calls and to-go orders. They package up your food, individually wrap your condiments and such. And this is for food that is, and this is my whole point, not intended for travel. 

This makes their job harder than a McDonald&apos;s worker because McDonald&apos;s and any other Fast Food establishment is set up for the SOLE purpose of take-out. They have a chain of 3-10 people working on each order, making it like clockwork and making it come out the speed at which you expect it.

Restaurant take out, however, is usually prepared by a single person not working along with the rest of the team. Know why? The rest of the team is set up for dine-in guests because that is their primary business.

Fast food workers are paid at least min. wage, no matter what state. Restaurant to-go people are, probably about 1/2 or 3/4 of the time, paid sub min. wages.

***ALSO: Please realize that NO restaurant that I know of(chain or otherwise)has a To-Go person during daytime hours. This means your to-go order will ALWAYS be prepared and packaged by a server. A server who does have tables and a server who is getting paid sub min. wages(unless your in one of the 7 states where we all know it&apos;s illegal).


*gasp*The End.

Why do you think that? All I have said in this thread is that I do not get the service I would if I were sitting down in the restaurant and that I refuse to pay for the service I didn&apos;t receive. That tells you absolutely nothing about how demanding I am when I order takeout from a restaurant. I could easily say that you are an incompetent server as I have as much evidence of that as you do of my habits when ordering out.

You seem to believe that my belief that I do not receive the same type of service when picking up takeout as opposed to dining is is&quot;moronic&quot;. To me, it is an obvious statement. However I would love to hear your reasons why putting items in bag(and yes - I know there is a bit more to it)is equivalent to acting as a server for an hour or more at a table in the restaurant.&quot;

I also find it funny that you are the person that resorted to insults when your ideas were challenged, but you think I am the one lacking in emotional maturity. Do you see the humor in that? I sure do.

Wow. What was the thought process that went from&quot;won&apos;t tip for service that isn&apos;t given&quot;to&quot;file clerk who binges/purges?&quot;. Anyone capable of those types of leaps of logic should be in the circus. Or politics.

Now it poor reading comprehension and poor social skills? Do you know how hard it is to practice your reading skills while purging?

I was going to add a line about being late for my job as a file clerk when it occurred to me there is nothing wrong with being a file clerk. While I believe you meant it as an insult - it is honest work, even if it doesn&apos;t happen to be mine.

 Kelly/Lards,

Do I really need to keep going on? I mean, your sentence here proves your lack of comprehension:

To me, it is an obvious statement. However I would love to hear your reasons why putting items in bag(and yes - I know there is a bit more to it)is equivalent to acting as a server for an hour or more at a table in the restaurant.

So, okay, if you know there is more to doing take out than putting items in a bag, why do you keep saying it? Why do you in one breath say&apos;I&apos;d love to hear your reasons why putting items in a bag is equivalent to acting as a server&apos;; in the next breath you say&apos;well, I know they do more than that&apos;. Okaaayy....so if you know they do more, why do you ask? I know your amazing skimming abilities probably lack, but did you try to read any actual take out workers experiences? Did you follow how they are doing much more than a cashier would be doing.
Or, are you, like your better half, being SELFISH by not bothering to realize that these people are working on many orders at a time. They aren&apos;t just there for you, I&apos;m sure thats a newsflash. I&apos;m not going to outline what they do start to finish for you just becuase you are incredibly lazy or unable to read for more than a paragraph, but you should read it before you answer next time.
I can&apos;t believe you really are equating McDonalds with Outback type places service wise. Perhaps you are getting such stellar service because you refuse to tip. Just because they aren&apos;t standing in front of you while you sit doesn&apos;t mean they haven&apos;t done just about everything a server at a table does. With the packing, its actually more, you nitwit. And yes I insult you not becuase you challenge anything(you don&apos;t have that capacity)but because you are truley a nitwit. And a shiftless customer, as well. You saying you&apos;refuse to pay for service I didn&apos;t recieve&apos;shows your true colors - cheap trying to get out of a tip. You did receive the services, but you can&apos;t open your eyes and acknowledge it. You are quite sad, really, but I blame your parents in the end.
Oh, and as another example of your fine comprehension skills, I never said ask take out servers if they deserve more money. I said ask them if most people tip - believe me if they didn&apos;t, there wouldn&apos;t be anyone working those take out stations.
I&apos;m done with you...you bore me with your stupidity. At least Lards is actually crazy. You&apos;re just cheap and sad. &quot;and yeah...why don&apos;t you go ahead and come in on Sunday, too...get a jump on the week, k?&quot;

 Scarletfever,

Did you really ask at McDOnald&apos;s the ingredients in an item? Okay, here are the ingredients in all McD&apos;s slop: Trans fat, beef fat, chicken feet and asses, salt sugar and artifical flavor. Read Fast Food Nation and steer clear from fast food.....

 I&apos;ll tip on take-out orders depending on what I ordered. If I called up Olive Garden and asked them for a small bowl of salad and 3 bread sticks, I won&apos;t tip. If my whole family orders meals, I&apos;ll likely give something for that.

To those who say the services of McDonald&apos;s and take-out of something like Outback aren&apos;t the same, what makes you think that? I&apos;ve stood at bars waiting for take-out orders and witness just what the server or bartender does when gathering my order. I&apos;ve watched them yell at the cooks in the kitchen for orders and when they realize it&apos;s ready, they walk back there, grab the boxes of food, place them in a brown bag and walk back to the register to ring me up. Talk about a work out. Now sometimes, sure a server may contribute to an order a little more than that. But how in the world is that different from what the kids at Mickey D&apos;s do? They typically put together more orders in an hour than a restaurant&apos;s take-out section does in a whole day. They run around trying to put together 5 different meals for one family, including the drinks. On top of that, they often get treated like crap, because I mean hey, they work at a lousy McDonald&apos;s restaurant. So they&apos;re probably all just idiots, right? They deal with a lot of crap throughout the day, no matter if there are 3, 6, or 9 people working back there. Why don&apos;t they deserve a tip?

 iloveny -

When I say that I know there is more involved in getting a takeout order ready than putting the food in the bag, I was referring to adding things like silverware and condiments. I didn&apos;t put each individual item in the list for the sake of brevity. In substance it is still the same as what is done at McDonalds - food is ordered, cooked, and put in container for me to take elsewhere. As for the assertion that a server is doing much more than a cashier at McDonalds would do - I would agree. At McDonalds they have a group of people who are paid to produce my order. At a restaurant, from what I have read here, they have fewer people working on each order and the takeout person does more of the work. However, the same work is still done. What the most efficient use of resources is, is a decision of the management of the restaurant.

&quot;Or, are you, like your better half, being SELFISH by not bothering to realize that these people are working on many orders at a time. They aren&apos;t just there for you, I&apos;m sure thats a newsflash. I&apos;m not going to outline what they do start to finish for you just becuase you are incredibly lazy or unable to read for more than a paragraph, but you should read it before you answer next time.&quot;

I do realize that the person doing takeout is not just there for me. They are working on many orders at the same time. That is my point! They are not providing the services to me that I would expect and tip for if I were dining in the restaurant. They are doing many other things for many other people. Why should I tip as if they weren&apos;t?

I don&apos;t do takeout from restaurants very often, but I have never had a problem getting my orders when I have. So I am not sure where you got the idea that I don&apos;t get good service.

You also said that you believe that I am cheap and trying to get out of tipping. Tipping is optional(in the&quot;you can&apos;t force me to if I don&apos;t want to&quot;sense). If I didn&apos;t want to tip, whether dining in or having takeout, I could simply not do it. I wouldn&apos;t waste my time trying to justify it to anyone. I am not tipping for take out because I will not receive the service that I would typically tip for while dining in.

And can we leave my parents out of this? Since I am an adult, I am responsible for my own actions - good or bad. After all, I didn&apos;t point out how proud your parents must be for such witty remarks as&quot;Loser&quot;(with the oh-so-clever picture)and&quot;nitwit&quot;.

&quot;With the packing, its actually more, you nitwit. And yes I insult you not becuase you challenge anything(you don&apos;t have that capacity)but because you are truley a nitwit.&quot;

You do realize that you mis-spelled two words in a sentence where you called me a nitwit on a website that has a spell check feature, right? I don&apos;t usually point out spelling or grammar mistakes online. I make way too many typos myself to start that, but that sentence was so funny I couldn&apos;t resist.

&quot;I can testify that the to-go people at my old Applebee&apos;s used to get paid $5.00 an hour, less than state min. wage.&quot;

It&apos;s still MORE than a server makes just serving tables. Do you understand WHY they pay more for these servers? It&apos;s it OBVIOUS? The restaurant owners**EXPECTS**customers NOT to tip, so they are giving a decent wage instead of the $2.13/hr. If the restaurant owners expected people to tip, then there would be no increase in pay for the to-go servers. You may say, well, some people tip 10% for to-go, which is not as much as 15%-20% when we dine in a restaurant. Still, the owner of some chains is paying more per hour, because they know MOST people DO NOT TIP for take-out in general, so the to-go servers wouldn&apos;t be making much of any money if the owners didn&apos;t pay them at least $5/hr.

&quot;And this is for food that is, and this is my whole point, not intended for travel.&quot;

That is BS. The restaurant has to-go containers already for people who take a doggie bag home when they want to take their food home with them, so YES, it IS INTENDED FOR TRAVEL, otherwise, they would NOT have to-go containers at ALL. It&apos;s like DUH! I have taken my food home in a box many times when I couldn&apos;t finish my food as well as little containers to put my condiments in.

&quot;This makes their job harder than a McDonald&apos;s worker because McDonald&apos;s and any other Fast Food establishment is set up for the SOLE purpose of take-out.&quot;

NO, that is BS. It also depend on what it is as far as certain situations being less or the same amount of work. For instance, if I ordered fettucine alfredo from Applebee&apos;s and I order hotcakes and sausage from Mcdonald&apos;s, which one has MORE WORK for the&quot;CASHIER&quot;or&quot;TO-GO SERVER?&quot;McDonald&apos;s OF COURSE! The Applebee&apos;s cashier takes the already all-in-one(napkin, salt-n-pepper packets, plastic fork&amp;knife)puts it in a bag. Rings me up and gives me change or a credit card receipt to sign. The McDonald&apos;s cashier on the other hand has to give me 2 syrups, 2 jellies(for my sausage), and 2 butters. They also have the utensils separate, so they have to grab a knife out the box and a fork out the other box. This cashier has to put it in a bag, ring me up, and give me change or credit card receipt. See which one did MORE WORK?

Now let&apos;s s I were to get a burger with fries from Applebee&apos;s. Also, let&apos;s say I get a burger and fries at McDonald&apos;s. The McDonald&apos;s cashier LOTS of times has HERSELF OR HIMSELF put mayo in a cup or tartar sauce in a cup or/and mustard. At Applebee&apos;s, let&apos;s say the to-go server gets the same thing, mayo and mustard in containers. both bag the person&apos;s food, ring it up, and give change or credit card receipts. They both also give utensils, which McDonald&apos;s cashiers have to go to a box for a knife, just as the Applebee&apos;s to-go server gives the all-in-one napkin/s&amp;p/utensils. So in this case, BOTH the to-server and the cashier at McDonald&apos;s did the SAME EXACT AMOUNT OF WORK.

My point is, it&apos;s NOT&quot;MORE&quot;work than a McDonald&apos;s cashier.

&quot;Restaurant take out, however, is usually prepared by a single person not working along with the rest of the team.&quot;
I would say only SOMETIMES. I just recently, like about 2 months ago, witnessed at Wendy&apos;s at an off hour like 3p.m. or so on a Sunday afternoon, the CASHIER not only ring us up, but put our burgers together with the lettuce, onions, mayo, mustard, etc. Also, SHE got the fries on the tray. She also put some mayo in a cup for me as well as mustard. My point is, SHE(the CASHIER)DID ALL THE WORK. No, she didn&apos;t COOK the food, but she did PREPARE it. Same thing as a to-server does when they get a sandwich order.

At KFC, I remember the CASHIER BOXED UP my biscuits, my chicken, my beans, and my macaroni&amp;cheese. The cashier also rung me up as well.

I also have had MANY of times that the CASHIER either went to give a cup to the cook for some tartar sauce at McDonald&apos;s or the CASHIER THEMSELF went to actually put some in a cup for me.

My point is, you can&apos;t say it&apos;s a team effort, because a lot of the times, it&apos;s NOT. I would say maybe sometimes it is, but since it&apos;s NOT ALL the time, so this is not valid to compare something that isn&apos;t stable. You can&apos;t say all the time that fast food workers work as a&quot;TEAM.&quot;

&quot;Fast food workers are paid at least min. wage, no matter what state. Restaurant to-go people are, probably about 1/2 or 3/4 of the time, paid sub min. wages.&quot;

I will say this again, WHO CARES&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;THEY MAKE? I SURE THE HELL DON&apos;T! I would say 99.9% of people ONLY care about when they get take-out at the counter would be if they had to wait a long time, if their order is 100% correct as well as their bill. They DO NOT CARE ABOUT HOW MUCH THE PERSON BAGGING THEIR FOOD IS GETTING PAID. WHY SHOULD THEY? Do you think they care what their customer&apos;s get paid? So shouldn&apos;t&quot;CARING&quot;be a 2-WAY street? If you don&apos;t care about MY INCOME, WHY THE HELL SHOULD I CARE ABOUT YOURS? I tip when I eat inside or get the food delivered to my car, because it&apos;s a BIGGER service than what McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, or Burger King provides. It&apos;s NOT about that they only get paid&quot;$2.13/hr&quot;, otherwise I wouldn&apos;t tip at Sonic, because they get paid minimum wage at least. I don&apos;t tip based on&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;someone is getting paid. I tip based on&quot;HOW MUCH WORK DID YOU DO?&quot;That is how it SHOULD be based. HOW is it truly fair to tip a bartender for for grabbing a beer out the refridgerator and flipping the cap, but not to tip a cashier at McDonald&apos;s that served me that hotcakes and sausage that I described above? It&apos;s NOT, because the McDonald&apos;s cashier did WAY THE HELL MORE WORK for NO TIP.

It&apos;s just like Starbuck&apos;s. WHO CARES if they make at least $6.50/hr? The fact is, when they make that frappuccino for me, they are performing just as a bartender would. Just because there happens to be no alcohol in the drink, doesn&apos;t mean that person isn&apos;t doing the SAME AMOUNT OF WORK. If I tip a bartender for a white russian, I should tip for a frappuccino.

People should tip on the&quot;AMOUNT OF WORK&quot;someone does, NOT&quot;HOW MUCH THEY MAKE.&quot;Even if a server in a restaurant got paid $8/hr, I still feel we should tip them the normal 15%-20% or even higher, because they are providing me with a service that is MORE than a fast food cashier would provide me. Do you understand that it SHOULDN&apos;T matter&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;someone makes per hour? It&apos;s HOW MUCH WORK did you do for your money that should count. Think of when you worked at Applebee&apos;s and when you may have had a customer that was very needy. Don&apos;t you think you deserved MORE MONEY when you had to do MORE WORK for that table that was needy? Well if you say yes, then there&apos;s NO DIFFERENCE in this situation. If you feel more work deserves more pay, then less work or the same amount of work for people who do it for no payment from customers should get no payment from customers. What&apos;s fair is fair to EVERYONE! Blame their employers, NOT the customers. Don&apos;t make us pay for the cheap employers. We have NOTHING to do with what someone makes an hour. Why make it our problem?

Not in some states. Different states pay servers anywhere between $2.13 and $7.50 an hour. Does this change your(warped)opinion on tipping servers?


 &quot;Restaurant take out, however, is usually prepared by a single person not working along with the rest of the team.&quot;
I would say only SOMETIMES. 

And you are qualified to say this...why? You don&apos;t work in the industry. You can&apos;t make generalizations based on a couple things you&apos;ve seen when standing on the other side of the register.

Once again, a fast food establishment is set up for only food to-go. A restaurant is not. You have no idea what the servers&apos;side of a line or an expo looks like in a restaurant, but I can tell you that it is not convenient for setting up to-go food(especially at my current restaurant!)unlike the chain of stations at a Wendy&apos;s or McDonald&apos;s. Their line is set up in order of application, and is basically idiot-proof(but it&apos;s amazing how often they still get things wrong).


 Do you understand that it SHOULDN&apos;T matter&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;someone makes per hour? It&apos;s HOW MUCH WORK did you do for your money that should count. 

Okay, then I&apos;ll start tipping my financial adviser and my professors, but not my bartenders. Having hour-long meetings with me, counciling me on my Roth IRA, and investing my funds sounds like more work than shaking up my martini. Makes sooo much sense, right?


 Blame their employers, NOT the customers. Don&apos;t make us pay for the cheap employers. We have NOTHING to do with what someone makes an hour. Why make it our problem? 

I&apos;ve noticed that since you started posting here, you&apos;ve changed your opinion about a lot of things, none of them logical. And this is a POV you&apos;ve adopted from many of the trolls who post around here once in a while about&quot;It&apos;s not our fault that your employer sucks and won&apos;t pay you good hourly wages!!!&quot;Why do you choose to begin thinking this way and not take our logical arguments to heart? I find it fascinating.

So by these statements I should only be doing $2.18/hours worth of work? If so then who is going to refill all of the condiments you claim to require in order to enjoy your food? Who is going to refill the ice so you may or may not have a refill of your drink? Who is going to answer the phone while the take out person is outside with 6 different vehicles? Who is going to help the expo out so that all the food goes out hot? Because for a void paycheck why should I do anything?
We all do this because we don&apos;t care what our paycheck is, we make our pay with tips. Take out is a demanding job at any restaurant and they rely on tips also. But since you lords have never worked in a restaurant in any capacity have no idea how things work. After all your posts and the people that have tried to explain to you. Some of them even nicely, you still have no clue. And yes I&apos;m a thief, I stole pennies.

You need to be schooled in the English language.

I never said that a restaurant is not equipped to make the food travel. I said that the food is not intended for travel. It&apos;s not. Restaurant food is prepared(in recipe brainstorming and actual preparation both)to be eaten right away, as it hits the window. My current manager actually used to the phrase&quot;doesn&apos;t travel well&quot;when describing our food, which is why take-out orders and even packing up leftovers is such a pain for us.

You, Lords, are confusing the concept of food being prepared for the sole purpose of travel(i.e. McDonalds, Wendy&apos;s, Taco Bell, etc)and food being able to be taken out(any full-service restaurant which offers take-out). Like I said before, restaurants offer take-out because it&apos;s a quick and convenient way to make extra money. However, the food you are ordering is intended to be eaten in and eaten as soon as it is prepared. When the execs at Applebee&apos;s and Chili&apos;s Corp paid some&quot;chefs&quot;to come up with their recipe&apos;s, they did not intend for this food to be immediately crammed into a plastic container and taken home in your Honda Civic. It is truly meant to be eaten ASAP, because that&apos;s when it&apos;s at its best.

Duh.

And as for your whole

 &quot;2 syrups, 2 jellies(for my sausage), and 2 butters&quot; 

garbage, that is what is truly BS. Firstly, you have no idea what type of work is required at either job because, well, you&apos;re an inexperienced idiot.

Secondly, your point system which you apply to all aspects of the world, not just server performance, is absurd and I pity you.

 LOA, you need to be introduced to America, 2007 if you think $5/hr is a decent wage.

$5/hr is a good wage...in 1987.

Not anymore.

Otherwise, can someone please disconnect her internet? &quot;Life&apos;s gonna suck when you grow up&quot;

You said: Not in some states. Different states pay servers anywhere between $2.13 and $7.50 an hour. Does this change your(warped)opinion on tipping servers?

I was ONLY talking about the $5/hr you said they were paid at some restaurants, NOT what EVERYONE that does to-go gets paid. As far as changing my opinion, NO, what they get paid has absolutely NOTHING to do with&quot;HOW MUCH WORK&quot;they provided me.

You said:&quot;Restaurant take out, however, is usually prepared by a single person not working along with the rest of the team.&quot;

YES, because I EXPERIENCED IT. As I said before in the previous post, the***CASHIER***MADE MY SANDWICH with putting mayo, mustard, cheese, lettuce, and onions on it and put FRIES on the tray at Wendy&apos;s. She also made my husbands sandwich as well. She also rung me up and gave me my receipt. She put MAYO AND MUSTARD IN A CUP! SHE DID THIS, NOT ANOTHER PART OF HER TEAM,**SHE**DID IT. I also forgot to mention she also filled our soft drinks as well, which I have seen 99% of the cashiers at Wendy&apos;s fill the drink cups with ice and drink, because I honestly CAN&apos;T think of a time I&apos;ve been at Wendy&apos;s that I truly haven&apos;t seen the cashier not be the person to fill the soft drinks. Now, I have seen Wendy&apos;s employees work as a team, that the cashier only took my order, gave me change, and fill my cup with ice&amp;drink. That is why I said&quot;SOMETIMES&quot;, because it&apos;s&quot;SOMETIMES&quot;that they work as a&quot;TEAM&quot;and sometimes they don&apos;t. I don&apos;t have to be&quot;QUALIFIED&quot;to KNOW WHO DOES WHAT WHEN I CAN******SEE*******IT WITH MY TWO EYES. So YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY I DONT, BECAUSE IS**SEE***WHO DID WHAT!

As far as working in that industry, there were MANY, MANY of times that I had to-go orders at the donut shop. Some of them were called in at the donut shop, some of them were at the counter, and some of them were in drive-thru. I didn&apos;t expect a tip for bagging their food, ringing them up, giving them change, and if they ordered a drink, filled their cup with ice&amp;drink. If they needed utensils I put them in the bag or if they wanted packets, I have to put them in the bag as well. Sure, I didn&apos;t have to put condiments in a cup, but that&apos;s about the only thing I didn&apos;t do that fast food cashiers and to-go servers do. If I&apos;ve fixed to-go food before, so I KNOW what it&apos;s like. Sometimes people would order several things like a chicken tenders meal with fries and a burger with fries along with a few soft drinks. At times, some orders would be more complicated at drive-thru for no tip and other people that just got coffee with a couple of refills as well as a couple of donuts tipped something just because they ate inside. That&apos;s stupid. I feel if I gave more work to the people in drive-thru, I should have gotten tipped from them and NOT the customers at the counter that had minimal service.

You act like I don&apos;t know, well its YOU who DOESNT understand. This place made regular food like burgers, pork chop sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, fries(cajun&amp;regular), biscuits, croissants, biscuits with choice of meat or egg or cheese, gravy biscuits, chicken tenders, white kastle burgers, etc. So, my point is, I KNOW what it&apos;s like to fix to-go food, whether it was a call-in order or a person at the counter that ordered to-go or a person in drive-thru. I DO NOT feel I deserved to have gotten tipped the times I have for even just a dozen glaze. Some people would put a whole dollar in the tip jar over putting a box under the shelf, ringing them up, giving them change, and handing them the box, because the glaze were made hot, so we wouldn&apos;t even box the glaze ones. That makes absolutely NO SENSE to tip me for doing almost NOTHING basically to get a tip at all for that. It&apos;s strange how I would serve food inside to some people, get them refills, got their order right, brought them their check and change, but wouldn&apos;t tip a penny. They still had people who would tip for only a dozen glaze or just a cup of coffee with a couple of refills. It just doesn&apos;t make ANY SENSE. I feel I deserved a tip for serving people at the table or booth or the counter(if they ate inside only)if there was food I was serving and I don&apos;t feel I deserved a tip for just a dozen glaze or a to-go order.

&quot;Once again, a fast food establishment is set up for only food to-go.&quot;

This is one of the STUPIDEST statements you have EVER SAID. WHY THE HELL WOULD McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, KFC, Burger King, and Popeyes, have places to SIT INSIDE if it was set up for&quot;ONLY&quot;&quot;TO-GO&quot;food? What an IDIOTIC STATEMENT! Use your common sense here. A place like&quot;RALLY&apos;S&quot;is set up for MOSTLY to-go food. They do, however, have tables outside the place to eat on, just not inside. Fast food restaurants like Rally&apos;s are RARE. MOST have a place to eat inside. Long John Silvers does also have places to sit. For you to make that statement makes you look like you have never set foot in a fast food restaurant before ever.

&quot;A restaurant is not.&quot;

It IS, because they would NOT have&quot;TO-GO&quot;BOXES OR CONTAINERS FOR CUSTOMERS WHO WANT TO TAKE THEIR FOOD HOME. This is COMMON SENSE! If they wouldn&apos;t want people to take food home, they WOULDN&apos;T even have to-go containers. Think about this logically, it&apos;s like DUH! If they felt a customer warming up most of their food would taste crappy, they wouldnt spend money on to-go containers, now WOULD THEY? It IS a expense for the restaurant to have to-go containers you know. Its not like they are free for the restaurant.

&quot;Okay, then I&apos;ll start tipping my financial adviser and my professors, but not my bartenders. Having hour-long meetings with me, counciling me on my Roth IRA, and investing my funds sounds like more work than shaking up my martini. Makes sooo much sense, right?&quot;

They couldn&apos;t accept tips more than likely. In those types of jobs, that may be considered bribery. People should tip based on the&quot;NORM&quot;to be FAIR, that since we don&apos;t tip for MOST fast food type of work, we shouldn&apos;t tip for that at non-fast food restaurants either that serve food to-go at the counter. Since we tip bartenders for a mixed drink, we should tip when we get a Starbuck&apos;s Frappacino or a shake at Baskin-n-Robin&apos;s or Cold Stone. Do you understand that ONLY places that are similar to who accepts tips and who doesn&apos;t that we should consider tipping or not tipping. If I try to tip my bank teller, they more than likely couldn&apos;t accept a tip, but if I tried to tip at Baskin-n-Robbin&apos;s for a shake, they could accept the tip, which McDonald&apos;s cashier&apos;s can&apos;t. So what you are saying is stupid in that a lot of jobs, you couldn&apos;t TIP them, because it&apos;s not allowed by their employer.

&quot;I&apos;ve noticed that since you started posting here, you&apos;ve changed your opinion about a lot of things, none of them logical.&quot;

Changed my opinions on WHAT? I HAVEN&apos;T changed a THING. They are LOGICAL, because it makes sense not to tip someone for doing the same type of work or even less work just because they happen to get paid less. Whats fair is fair. Whats unfair is unfair. WHY should I tip someone for instance to fill a cup with a white russian daiquiri since the person isnt making the white russian and only pulling a lever? This is LESS work than a McDonalds cashier does to give me a coke with ice even. The cashier has to fill a cup with ice and with liquid. Even if I chose to have no ice, then thats equal amount of work for both people. HOW is it logically to tip for someone not making the white russian? You still never answered me about you Applebees experiences with needy guest. If you feel that you deserved a bigger tip for doing more for a table, then HOW is what I am saying ANY DIFFERENT? If you feel more work deserves more tip, then less work should deserve a less tip or no tip, depending on if we tip the other person that does the same or less amount of work that we are comparing it to.

&quot;Why do you choose to begin thinking this way and not take our logical arguments to heart?&quot;

Because your arguments have false statements in them, that is why. Non-fast food restaurants have to-go containers already, so they ARE ALREADY set-up to put food in to-go containers. Also,&quot;to heart&quot;would be to care about the&quot;CUSTOMER&apos;S MONEY&quot;that they make. If you don&apos;t care about my income, WHY should I care about yours? Like if you served me to-go at Applebee&apos;s. You dont care what I make at my job, so WHY the HELL should I have a&quot;heart&quot;and care about if you only make $2.13/hr serving to-go considering you are doing the same or less amount of work for people we NEVER tip at McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, Burger King, KFC, and Popeyes? I care about treating EVERYONE in this world as**EQUALLY**as I can, which you didn&apos;t when you worked at Applebee&apos;s. I remember you said you would give some customers the least amount of service due to if they tipped lower due to mistakes than customers who would tip you 15%-20% no matter what happened? It was in 2005, you basically said something about that you would cater more to the better tipping table than to a table that took off tip points for mistakes. Which here it is:

 http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/9/2459.html#POST11074 

Once your server gets a look at the type of customer you are, we save the energy that otherwise would have gone to serving you, and we give it to our other normal guests. We fail to care about you or your $4 tip.

So basically you ADMITTED that you felt and probably STILL FEEL, that you EXPECTED MORE PAYMENT FOR MORE WORK, therefore you felt you deserved a better tip for MORE work. Gee, DOESNT that sound familiar? You felt the more work, the more tip you should have received, so the less tip, the less work the customer should have received from their server. Also, you sounded very SELFISH by saying that. You honestly only cared about yourself and your money, NOT your customers whether or not they were happy or not.

Anyway, my point is, you didnt have a HEART to feel you deserve how much you got if you made mistakes, so WHY should customers have a heart to care about how much you make? If you didn&apos;t care about your customers, then WHY should have they cared to tip you at all? Its not like you care what I make an hour if you served me a to-go entre at Applebees, so WHY should I care about how much you make? Caring is a 2-way street, so if you dont care, why should I?

I never said that a restaurant is not equipped to make the food travel. I said that the food is not intended for travel. It&apos;s not.

Before you said this:&quot;And this is for food that is, and this is my whole point, not intended for travel.&quot;

HOW are these 2 statements**ANY**DIFFERENT in that BOTH have food TRAVELING from the restaurant to the persons home or wherever they go after they leave the restaurant? The food still TRAVELS, so OBVIOUSLY if the restaurant is already EQUIPPED with to-go containers, they ARE INTENEDED FOR TRAVEL, otherwise, the restaurant would NOT HAVE**********************ANY**********************TO-GO CONTAINERS, PERIOD! Dont you get that?

You, Lords, are confusing the concept of food being prepared for the sole purpose of travel(i.e. McDonalds, Wendy&apos;s, Taco Bell, etc)

NO, as I stated above, McDonalds, Wendys, Taco Bell, Burger King, KFC, and Popeyes ALL have TABLES to eat INSIDE, so NO, their SOLE purpose is NOT to have TO-GO food orders. Now, Rallys is 99% basically for to-go orders in that the only tables they have is OUTSIDE the restaurant, which they dont have too many tables to sit at. I cant say Rallys 100% purpose is to-go, because they wouldnt even have tables outside, which is eating on THEIR PROPERTY, even though its not INSIDE the restaurant.

However, the food you are ordering is intended to be eaten in and eaten as soon as it is prepared.

I would say maybe FRIES are if they are warmed up in the microwave, but not if they are warmed up in the oven. I have had ribs from Outback warmed up in the microwave from leftovers, which tasted just as if I got it from the restaurant. It was delicious. I feel MOST foods can be at the very least, warmed up in an oven or toaster oven and some even in the microwave. They STILL can taste GOOD. So for you to say the food is intended to be eaten as soon as prepared is RIDICULOUS, because Ive warmed up food from restaurants LOTS of times and it STILL taste good. Ive put a shrimp and duck pasta dish in the microwave and it STILL TASTED GOOD. Sure, putting pasta in the microwave dries up the food, but some things DO still taste good. Now I would say a chicken sandwich in the microwave doesnt work to well, because I have tried it, but in the oven, would probably taste good, because I have had Popeyes fried chicken in the oven which tasted very good. All I am saying is MOST foods***ARE***intended NOT to be eaten right away, otherwise restaurants would NOT have to-go containers at all. Dont you get that? If the restaurant owners felt the food wouldnt stay tasting good once it left the restaurant, they wouldnt bother to offer for someone to bring the food home, NOW WOULD THEY?

It is truly meant to be eaten ASAP, because that&apos;s when it&apos;s at its best.

That is truly ANY food, whether you get McDonalds inside vs. to-go or if you go to Chilis to get something to-go. Sure, the food taste the freshest when its cooked immediately, but I truly feel I have had some VERY good leftovers that I sometimes have enjoyed MORE at HOME than in the restaurant. Sure, it could be many factors like maybe I was hungrier for the food at home, because I ate part of an appetizer at the restaurant when I originally ordered it or that it just taste just as good as it did when I got it at times. My point is, the food CAN be still GREAT and WONDERFUL when its brought home as well. As I stated before, SOME foods dont warm up well. I would say one of the only foods I can think of(which there may be more Im sure)that wouldnt work well at all for to-go would be pancakes. Pancakes I find have to be eaten right after, otherwise they dont taste right in my opinion. But look how MANY foods CAN be warmed over and STILL have a great taste! Think about it.

I Said: 2 syrups, 2 jellies(for my sausage), and 2 butters&quot;

You said: garbage, that is what is truly BS. Firstly, you have no idea what type of work is required at either job because, well, you&apos;re an inexperienced idiot.

NO, YOU ARE THE IDIOT, because EVERY FREAKING TIME IVE ORDERED HOTCAKES AND SAUSAGE, which I have quite a bit in my entire lifetime, the*****CASHIER*****gives me 2 syrups and 2 butters. If I chose to order the sausage too, I ask for at least 2 jellies. The CASHIER***VOLUNTARILY****gives me the 2 syrups and the 2 butters for my hotcakes along with the fork and knife as well which you forgot to mention. If I experience the service, I am NOT UNEXPERIENCED with KNOWING EXACTLY WHO DOES WHAT. Dont you get that?

coorslite
So by these statements I should only be doing $2.18/hours worth of work?

According to the to-go servers employer, if that is how much they pay, then they feel the to-g0 servers work is only worth that much. Dont you get that? WHO says its worth more? Thats to someones OPINION, NOT a FACT. Its truly ONLY an OPINION of what someones job is truly worth, no matter what you do.

If so then who is going to refill all of the condiments you claim to require in order to enjoy your food? Who is going to refill the ice so you may or may not have a refill of your drink?

This type of stuff is called SIDE WORK and it is done BEFORE or AFTER a customer leaves. If you have to do it during their service due to things running out, its still for RESTAURANT. Think about it. If you refill the ice bin, the servers that are serving customers inside are benefiting from it as well. Its not just the to-go customer that benefits from refilling and restocking items. According to some to-go server employers, they feel that work is only worth $2.18/hr.

Who is going to answer the phone while the take out person is outside with 6 different vehicles?

Answering the phone is part of why you get the $2.18/hr. This service is for the RESTAURANT. Since when do people get tipped for answering a phone, huh? Ive NEVER heard of that before. If that was so, I would have gotten tipped at the law firm from customers that would have called when I would have been sitting at the receptionist desk and when they would have came in, they would have tipped me. I NEVER have seen ANYONE TIP SOMEONE FOR ANSWERING A PHONE! THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS YOU CAME UP WITH EVER! Also, when you take an order over the phone, its just like as if they were in person telling you their order, so its truly NO DIFFERENT. Think about it. If the phone happens to not be by the register, its a CHOICE to write down the order on a pad of paper, NOT mandatory.

Who is going to help the expo out so that all the food goes out hot?

As far as helping the expo get food out hot, thats just like McDonalds work. Now, if you are talking about delivering it to someones car, I do feel a person should tip a couple of bucks at least for an order of $20 lets say(10%). If its a $10 order or less I would say only a buck at most. I am against tipping when picking up the food inside at the counter. I feel counter service is counter service. I dont feel I deserved a tip for handing someone their food, giving them utensils such as if they order a biscuit and sausage theyd need a knife for jelly&amp;butter as well as getting them jelly and butter when I worked at the donut shop. I also would have to ring them up and give them change. I also would bag their food. WHY would have I deserved a tip for that?

Because for a void paycheck why should I do anything?

Thats the to-go servers decision if they want to do anything. Remember, NO ONE is making that person take that type of job. A person that takes a job that basically solely depends on CUSTOMERS for their money is taking a gamble with their income. Its probably not a very steady income. One day they may make more than another. I chose to take a job that has steady income. Its a personal choice.

Take out is a demanding job at any restaurant and they rely on tips also.

Its not DEMANDING because its just as easy as McDonalds as far as counter service goes. As far as them relying on tips, some restaurant owners wouldnt be giving them an increase in wage if the restaurant owner felt that theyd make tips. Obviously, there is a reason why at that particular Chilis that I quoted on one of my above posts, that the to-go servers make $7/hr. The reason is they KNOW 90% of people dont tip at all for to-go orders.

Also, Ive had a time I picked up an order from a pizza place that sold sandwiches as well. I specifically ordered 1 side of bbq sauce and 1 or 2 sides of ranch(cant remember if it was 1 or 2). Anyway, I went inside to pick it up. I opened my bag, NONE of the bbq sauce or ranch was there. It was an order of around $25. Now WHY THE HELL would I tip someone to NOT EVEN LOOK IN THE BAG? I honestly wouldnt have tipped if they would have gotten it right anyway, but definitely not for getting the order OBVIOUSLY WRONG. Thankfully I never get delivery anymore from anywhere. Its not that I dont want to tip, its because my order doesnt come to the door correctly. At Papa Johns, lots of times they forgot the extra cheese sauces I ordered, which I actually did PAY for. They werent free like most condiments usually are. I am just tired of getting my food wrong when it arrives, so I gave up on getting delivery EVER again. Sure its nice to save a few bucks to go pick it up instead of getting things delivered, but honestly, its not because of that. Its because my order hardly ever is correct. The delivery person cant look in the box even for 5 seconds it seems.

Some of them even nicely, you still have no clue. And yes I&apos;m a thief, I stole pennies.

If I had NO CLUE, I wouldnt see HOW MANY MISTAKES I WOULD AVOID THAT YOU, FOR INSTANCE DIDNT such as overcharging for almost 2 weeks. I DO KNOW A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU KNOW about a LOT OF THINGS, because otherwise, you wouldnt have overcharged people for almost 2 weeks and I would make MUCH LESS mistakes than you ever would, because you dont care about your customers happiness. You care just about yourself. I on the other hand, give 25% or over tips to people that SHOW they care about my happiness, so I do pay them more than the normal amount when I get that type of service. As far as your overcharges go, ANY sensible person would have realized their error within the VERY FIRST DAY and the VERY FIRST OR SECOND TRANSACTION they did at the register. You basically PROVED you were an idiot for almost 2 weeks and that you didnt CARE about your customers money, so WHY should they care about your tip? What goes around, comes around.

thegirl
LOA, you need to be introduced to America, 2007 if you think $5/hr is a decent wage.

What I meant was, its A LOT MORE DECENT than $2.13/hr is. At least its $5/hr- instead of barley $2/hr.

 This is one of the STUPIDEST statements you have EVER SAID. WHY THE HELL WOULD McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, KFC, Burger King, and Popeyes, have places to SIT INSIDE if it was set up for&quot;ONLY&quot;&quot;TO-GO&quot;food? 

Is the food prepared or wrapped any differently than if it&apos;s being shoved out the drive-thru window? No. There&apos;s your answer.

As for everything else you said, I go back to telling you to learn the English language. I cannot have a normal conversation with you if you don&apos;t know what words like&quot;intend&quot;and&quot;generalization&quot;mean. You also don&apos;t understand the phrase&quot;to heart&quot;and you wasted your time ranting and raving about me being heartless, for some reason. You also don&apos;t understand the idea of a company offering something that customers want, merely as a convenience. You seem to think this convenience trumps all. You&apos;re completely hopeless. I&apos;m shocked you graduated high school, or that you can hold down a job.

Just because it&apos;s&quot;WRAPPED UP&quot;DOESN&apos;T mean that food and drinks are not served INSIDE. WHY would these fast food restaurants I mentioned have spent thousands of dollars putting tables and booths to eat inside at these places if their intention was to as you said&quot;ONLY&quot;to serve food to-go? McDonald&apos;s wouldn&apos;t have a playland area for kids if they wanted the food to be available just TO-GO now would they? Some of these places now-a-days are built INSIDE the building, so children don&apos;t even have to go outside anymore. YOU ARE THE ONE THAT NEEDS TO GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL! I mean YOU are the one that said this statement:&quot;&quot;Once again, a fast food establishment is set up for only food to-go.&quot;If that were true, these fast food restaurants wouldn&apos;t have an option&quot;FOR HERE&quot;to pick from you IDIOT!

If fast food restaurants&quot;ONLY&quot;purpose was to serve food to-go, the restaurant would NOT have tables and booths to eat inside, nor would the cashier ask&quot;Will this be&quot;FOR HERE OR TO-GO&quot;&quot;NOW WOULD THEY, YOU IDIOT? YOU ARE A MORON WITHOUT&quot;COMMON SENSE!&quot;

&quot;I cannot have a normal conversation with you if you don&apos;t know what words like&quot;intend&quot;and&quot;generalization&quot;mean.&quot;

I KNOW what they mean. I also know what the word&quot;ONLY&quot;means. By you stating&quot;ONLY&quot;, you are saying that the only reason fast food restaurants exist is because of to-go orders, which is VERY UNTRUE. Just remember that when you go to McDonald&apos;s to eat inside or pick up something to-go inside. They will ask&quot;Will this be for here or to-go.&quot;Meaning, they have MORE than just&quot;TO-GO&quot;food. RALLY&apos;S is intended mostly for to-go food, but McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, Burger King, KFC, Long John Silver&apos;s, and Popeyes AREN&apos;T.

 http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/intended 
&quot;v. intr.
To have a design or purpose in mind.&quot;

When the fast food restaurants were designed, they decided to put tables and booths in them. So their purpose was to serve people to-go as well as inside. Also, think about the trays to eat inside that these fast food restaurants have. That is another thing that PROVES these fast food restaurants I mentioned above(not counting Rally&apos;s)provide customers with trays to carry their food to EAT INSIDE. YOU ARE AN IDIOT!

Also, the non-fast food restaurants have to-go containers already, so that means they TRULY DO INTEND FOR CUSTOMERS TO TAKE THEIR FOOD HOME. If they wouldn&apos;t have to-go containers, then that would mean they wouldn&apos;t intend for you to take food home at all. Are you that stupid you can&apos;t UNDERSTAND THAT?

You still NEVER said anything about this statement I said:&quot;You felt the more work, the more tip you should have received, so the less tip, the less work the customer should have received from their server.&quot;

If you did more work for a needy table, didn&apos;t you EXPECT to get paid 20% or over that considering you said you didn&apos;t care about a $4 tip? SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE WITH TO-GO ORDERS AT A NON-FAST FOOD RESTAURANT? THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. You basically admitted you wanted more money for more work. SO WHY NOT TIP FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK SOMEONE DOES? ISN&apos;T THAT ONLY FAIR?

&quot;I&apos;m shocked you graduated high school, or that you can hold down a job.&quot;

I am SHOCKED that you graduated high school, because you are too stupid to know that fast food restaurants have places to eat inside at. If these fast food restaurants only wanted to cater to to-go orders, they would be set up like Rally&apos;s without any tables even outside. They wouldn&apos;t have tables or booths, now would they, you idiot?

You also are too stupid to realize that if non-fast food restaurants have to-go containers, OBVIOUSLY to them it&apos;s OK to take food home in them.

Look WHO is the one that is DUMB! I just proved that.

&quot;that you can hold down a job.&quot;

ANY IDIOT who tries their best should be able to hold a job. Even people like you that don&apos;t have common sense.

 Lords, when have you ever done take out or been a server in a restaurant? And can you answer this adult question without random caps? I&apos;m not talking about when you were a fast food donut shop counter help person. I am talking about a restaurant. Do you have real restaurant experience or do you just love to argue with people that do this everyday and make a living? I&apos;m not calling you any names, I&apos;m just telling you for a fact you do not know how a restaurant operates and that there is no way you will ever understand. The reason you do not understand is because you do not think you are ever wrong and think we(as servers)are concerned about your feelings. We really don&apos;t care how you feel, and we have all waited on tables like you. We want a table like you in and out asap! If for all your ranting and name calling you had ever tried to see what we are trying to tell you I may have respect for you. That is not the case. You come on here and think that you know everything when you have never worked in a restaurant before. You don&apos;t know the difference between a restaurant and the dollar menu at Wendy&apos;s, who also want you in and out asap. You just don&apos;t get it. And never will. Instead of respect I should pity you. But someone that doesn&apos;t learn after people have tried and tried to explain the difference??? Not even worth the pity.
Oh yeah and I am a thief that stole pennies for the restaurant for 2 weeks.

 Lords, are you aware that the very first McDonald&apos;s a walk-up window only? They didn&apos;t have a dining room. It truly was only to-go food. That is what the chain began as.

The reason they added dining areas is because that&apos;s what people wanted, but they didn&apos;t change their preparation and presentation of the food(which is it being packaged to go). It remains that way to this day. So, once again, fast food is prepared and packaged to go. They don&apos;t give a flying F***if you drive away or eat in. The tables are their for your convenience, not for the staff to change the prep of the food.

Restaurants exist for the purpose of you eating in. If you want to take food out, it goes against the grain of what the intent is, which creates more work for the staff. Common sense says, you should tip. We&apos;re not telling you to tip 20%. 8% - 10% should suffice.

Yes, if a table ran me ragged, I would expect them to tip me 15%-20% assuming I did everything I needed to do for them. But get this: I expect that from every table that I perform well at. I expect the tip to reflect my level of service regardless of how needy they are. The percentages remain the same.

However, if you are farsighted enough to recognize that you are a difficult customer, and you say to yourself&quot;Well, the service wasn&apos;t perfect, but my server did the best he/she could based on the amount of work we were throwing at them,&quot;and your tip reflects that, then that&apos;s even better.

Oh, and I&apos;m shocked I&apos;ve spent this much time responding to you. Because, like I said before, you&apos;re hopeless. I&apos;d like to clarify that I&apos;m not ignorant about the industry, as you insinuate. You are because, well, you&apos;ve never worked in it. I sufficiently know the English language and can accurately assess a sentence without twisting and skewing the meaning(unlike yourself). I&apos;d start throwing SAT scores and GPAs at you if I thought it would prove anything. But once again! You&apos;re hopeless.

 Oh, and you little Lordsie Ass, my billing rate is now $45 per hour. What are you pulling down our little loser that likes to diss waitstaff? You think you&apos;re so smart but you couldn&apos;t spell yourself into next week, never mind be civil in civilized society.

Pig.&quot;Gimme mo&apos;ranch dressen&apos;now and be gone witchew right now! I want it right now or I&apos;ll be dissin&apos;yo tip now! Run and fetch it now and I&apos;m timming ya!&quot;

Piggish, rude and crass. Pretty much what you&apos;d expect in a low class restaurant like Applebees or Chilis.

 I couldn&apos;t resist going back to this:

 I would say maybe FRIES are if they are warmed up in the microwave, but not if they are warmed up in the oven. ... I feel MOST foods can be at the very least, warmed up in an oven or toaster oven and some even in the microwave. ... So for you to say the food is intended to be eaten as soon as prepared is RIDICULOUS, because Ive warmed up food from restaurants LOTS of times and it STILL taste good. ... All I am saying is MOST foods***ARE***intended NOT to be eaten right away, otherwise restaurants would NOT have to-go containers at all. 

Now you&apos;re talking about food quality?!?! Okay, we already established a long time ago that your palate is atrocious. That&apos;s the first thing. The next issue is: Did you suddenly become the consulting chef for every restaurant in the country that offers food to-go? No? That&apos;s what I thought.

You can&apos;t say boo about &quot;MOST foods***ARE***intended NOT to be eaten right away&quot; because you are not the one creating these dishes. You don&apos;t even know how to cook! Hence the reason you seem to think food isn&apos;t mean to be eaten right away. ?!?!?? Not only do I work in food service, but my father was a sous chef and a pastry chef. They are meticulous and have unbelievable standards for themselves and the food they create.

There&apos;s a reason my managers won&apos;t let us take food out to the dining room if its been sitting in the window too long. The quality is not what it should be; not what it was 3 minutes ago. The chefs intend for that food to hit the table within seconds of putting it in the window. Rather than take out food that has been sitting too long, according to their standards, they make a new dish.

And believe me, these standards aren&apos;t just practiced at nicer places. Even my old Applebee&apos;s had pretty high standards for sending out what they considered to be&quot;old&quot;food. If it was in the window for more than 5 minutes, get rid of it, or use it for something else. Have the staff eat it, because the quality isn&apos;t good enough to hit a guests table.

The issue of take-out at the full service restaurant is based on the guests&apos;choice. If you choose to order take-out, the restaurant lets you because they make quick cash off of it! They do the best they can to make the meal last, but its not always expected to because that was not the original intent. It never was. You&apos;re confusing the intent of the chef and the intent of the restaurant to make money. Of course the restaurant is not going to turn down a sale for take-out, but the kitchen does not make take-out a priority when setting up their line or creating recipes.

Duh.

Lords, when have you ever done take out or been a server in a restaurant? And can you answer this adult question without random caps? I&apos;m not talking about when you were a fast food donut shop counter help person. I am talking about a restaurant.

Just because I didnt do a take-out order in a regular non-fast food restaurant, DOESNT mean I didnt do a TAKE-OUT order before. The steps for doing a to-go order are the SAME or LESS whether you work at McDonalds or Applebees.

I DO NOT have to DO IT to*SEE*what the cashier at Wendys did to put my burger together, to put my condiments in 2 cups, to fill my drink with ice and soft drink, and to ring me up as well as give me my credit card receipt or if I would have paid with cash, given me change. Can you HONESTLY tell me truthfully when MORE WORK is involved than what that Wendys worker for instance did for me and then if you can PROVE that, then I would say tip for take-out when a customer picks up an order, but if you CANT PROVE that, then you have NO BASIS for this argument? Answering the phone DOESNT count, because I didnt get tipped for answering the phone when I had to do receptionist work part of my day as a file clerk at the law firm, so you shouldnt get tipped for answering the phone at a restaurant. Whats fair is FAIR! I honestly DO NOT think you can truly PROVE that I am wrong. Think of all the steps it takes to get an order to-go at Applebee&apos;s lets say for a burger with fries, which is comparable to a burger and fries at Wendys. The to-go server and the Wendys cashier went through a lot of the same steps and even the to-go server did LESS work, because I KNOW the to-go server doesnt put LETTUCE, ONIONS, MAYO, AND CHEESE on my burger, but that cashier did, because I SAW HER MAKE IT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES. So unless you can TRULY PROVE there is somehow there is MORE WORK involved in a to-go order at the counter at non-fast food restaurants, you have NO BASIS to argue with me. I feel I have PROVEN you wrong already. I am NOT saying EVERY TIME I go to Wendys I get my burger made by the cashier, but sometimes I have. The times when another person makes the burger at Wendys, thats just like the cooks at Applebees making my burger. Theres NO DIFFERENCE in the amount of work the to-go server and the Wendys cashier does. The condiments part is the same also. Until you can truly PROVE there is more work involved with these 2 situations, then we have nothing to talk about with this subject.

Lords, are you aware that the very first McDonald&apos;s a walk-up window only? They didn&apos;t have a dining room. It truly was only to-go food. That is what the chain began as.

WHO FREAKING GIVES A CARE HOW IT BEGAN? The fact is NOW-A-DAYS 2007, they have not only tables and booths, but also, a playland inside for kids. When I was around 6 or 7 yrs old, they had the playing equipment OUTSIDE such as slides, Grimace, hamburgerler, merry-go-round, and slide. SEE HOW MUCH has changed since 1983-84 when I was 6yrs old in 1983 and 7 yrs old in 1984? So think about when a McDonalds FIRST OPENED HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. WHO CARES HOW IT BEGAN? The fact is, NOW, they have made sure customers have a to-go option as well as a for here option.

They don&apos;t give a flying F***if you drive away or eat in. The tables are their for your convenience, not for the staff to change the prep of the food.

If they didnt, as you said give a flying F***,, then they wouldnt bother to have booths and tables in their restaurants, NOW WOULD THEY? They wouldnt bother to make a playland for kids if ALL the food was made for the SOLE PURPOSE TO-GO, NOW WOULD THEY?

If you want to take food out, it goes against the grain of what the intent is, which creates more work for the staff. Common sense says, you should tip. We&apos;re not telling you to tip 20%. 8% - 10% should suffice.

NO, COMMON SENSE would be to treat people EQUALLY as one of the people said on the message board I mentioned in earlier posts, that treatment of people should be UNIVERISAL, that if I dont tip McDonalds for doing the same or less work, WHY should I tip someone else for doing the same or less work than at Applebees? Also, you say 8%-10% should suffice, well, NO, NOTHING should suffice for the same or less service I get for COUNTER SERVICE. SAME OR LESS AMOUNT OF WORK=SAME OR LESS AMOUNT OF TIP. Which means ZERO=ZERO tip in this case.

I expect the tip to reflect my level of service regardless of how needy they are. The percentages remain the same.

But before you said this: http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/9/2459.html#POST11074 
Once your server gets a look at the type of customer you are, we save the energy that otherwise would have gone to serving you, and we give it to our other normal guests. We fail to care about you or your $4 tip.

So basically what you truly said was that you expected a bigger tip from me, because I am a NEEDY customer. So, you have just PROVEN yourself WRONG through your OWN POSTS. The thing is, you had said you EXPECTED a $4 tip(lets say thats less than 15% of my bill I am assuming this is what you meant by a $4 tip), but you DONT KNOW if you would have received that from me or not until AFTER I paid my bill. So that means, the percentages DO NOT remain the same, because as you said, you would give me LESS service due to your ASSUMPTION that I would tip you lower than 15%(lets say). SO NO, its NOT REGARDLESS OF HOW NEEDY THEY ARE as you said, because you actually expect a BIGGER TIP for the MORE NEEDIER THE GUEST IS. You have PROVEN that by your past post that you save your energy for your normal guest. Well, normally, most guests dont ask for 5 condiments. That is being NEEDY.

I&apos;d start throwing SAT scores and GPAs at you if I thought it would prove anything.

HONESTLY, if you can GUESS correctly for multiple choice test, that truly DOESNT PROVE A THING. Ive had people tell me in my PUBLIC high school, they did dot-to-dot on the ACT and made an 18 or a 20. Does that mean they were that smart? HELL F NO! They just happened to GUESS THE CORRECT ANSWER. So when you say stuff about your scores, you are right, that DOESNT PROVE ANYTHING. Some people like you can be BOOK SMART, but have NO COMMON SENSE WHAT-SO-EVER.

I said: Look WHO is the one that is DUMB!

You said: Umm, you?

Tables are their for your convenience,

Gee, YOU HAVE PROVED that you DONT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR and THERE. Their is to refer to someone. You are should have stated Tables are THERE for your convenience. You act so smart, but you CANT EVEN SPELL CORRECTLY! GO BACK TO FIRST GRADE. I CANT BELIEVE YOU MADE IT THROUGH to the first grade, much less HIGH SCHOOL, when you CANT even SPELL. LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR NERVE TO TELL ME ANYTHING? LOOK IN THE MIRROR WHO IS UNEDUCATED! I may spell things wrong, but at least I ADMIT that, unlike you. You act like you are SOOOO SMART, when you cant even spell correctly.

Restaurants exist for the purpose of you eating in.

Fast food places are still considered Fast food restaurants. NO, then they would NOT offer take-out, nor would they have containers to bring leftovers home, now would they?

Isnt it FUNNY as all HELL how you NEVER RESPOND to the things I PROVED YOU WRONG such as this: I Said: 2 syrups, 2 jellies(for my sausage), and 2 butters&quot;

You said: garbage, that is what is truly BS. Firstly, you have no idea what type of work is required at either job because, well, you&apos;re an inexperienced idiot.

I responded: NO, YOU ARE THE IDIOT, because EVERY FREAKING TIME IVE ORDERED HOTCAKES AND SAUSAGE, which I have quite a bit in my entire lifetime, the*****CASHIER*****gives me 2 syrups and 2 butters. If I chose to order the sausage too, I ask for at least 2 jellies. The CASHIER***VOLUNTARILY****gives me the 2 syrups and the 2 butters for my hotcakes along with the fork and knife as well which you forgot to mention. If I experience the service, I am NOT UNEXPERIENCED with KNOWING EXACTLY WHO DOES WHAT. Dont you get that?

Gee, no, I cant exactly SHOW you what Ive experienced in the past, but I can tell you about my TRUE EXPERIENCES. The CASHIER got me the 2 syrups, 2 jellies, 2 butters, and the utensils. She served me for NO TIP and is truly more work than a pasta entre to-go at Applebees.

You come on here and think that you know everything when you have never worked in a restaurant before.

I worked at the donut shop/diner. In the name of the place, it is called a DINER. It is STILL considered a RESTAURANT just as fast food places are STILL CONSIDERED RESTAURANTS. I DO NOT HAVE TO BE A WAITRESS TO KNOW HOW TO PREVENT A LOT OF MISTAKES AND HOW MUCH WORK IS INVOLVED IN A TO-GO ORDER.

big_Momma
You think you&apos;re so smart but you couldn&apos;t spell yourself into next week, never mind be civil in civilized society.

Dont you remember, you COULDNT spell EMBARRASSED on bitterwaitress, remember? You act like you are miss PERFECT, WELL YOU ARENT just as Im NOT.

You also have misspelled other words as well.

 http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/9/2934.html#POST13944 

obssessing over service into learning interpersonal skills.

The word is spelled: OBSESSING

Neither could Nuvola09 for instance here: Tables are their for your convenience

Whats good for her, should be good for me to do as well. Whats FAIR IS FAIR, just as you couldnt spell EMBARRASSED YOURSELF. LOOK IN THE MIRROR!

Pretty much what you&apos;d expect in a low class restaurant like Applebees or Chilis.

Gee, you even TRIED Chilis and heres PROOF:

 http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/9/3124.html 

I&apos;ve only been to a Chili&apos;s once and it was disgusting.

GEE, if you are putting down something YOU have tried, GEE, doesnt that make you look STUPID? I mean really, if you feel those type of places are disgusting to begin with, WHY would you even dare to TRY them since you feel they are so LOW CLASS?

&quot;You can&apos;t say boo about&quot;MOST foods***ARE***intended NOT to be eaten right away&quot;because you are not the one creating these dishes. You don&apos;t even know how to cook! Hence the reason you seem to think food isn&apos;t mean to be eaten right away. ?!?!?? Not only do I work in food service, but my father was a sous chef and a pastry chef. They are meticulous and have unbelievable standards for themselves and the food they create.&quot;

As I stated before, the restaurant would NOT PROVIDE customers with to-go containers if they felt the food would be no good leaving the restaurant.

&quot;There&apos;s a reason my managers won&apos;t let us take food out to the dining room if its been sitting in the window too long. The quality is not what it should be; not what it was 3 minutes ago. The chefs intend for that food to hit the table within seconds of putting it in the window.&quot;

You are talking about dining inside the restaurant. That&apos;s is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Us customers do NOT have a microwave or oven at our tables, DO WE? When person can take the food home, most normal people have ways to warm up their food such as an oven, toaster oven, or microwave. Sure, I agree with the managers not to serve cold food when dining in. We aren&apos;t talking about&quot;dining in&quot;are we? We are talking about take-out. The food is MEANT to be WARMED OVER considering they don&apos;t make you either throw your leftovers away or make you bring your own to-go containers. Think about that. The restaurant provides to-go containers, because they KNOW the person won&apos;t be eating it FRESH. As you said, it&apos;s like DUH!

Eating inside is different. As I said before, the restaurant provides to-go containers, because they know their customers won&apos;t be eating their food fresh.

Restaurants would not provide us with to-go containers at all if they intended for us not to bring the food home. THAT PROVES my point.

&quot;Rather than take out food that has been sitting too long, according to their standards, they make a new dish.&quot;

So they make a new dish with the take-out food. I seriously doubt that they do, but if you are serious about that, that is just because they don&apos;t want the customer to bitch and gripe about their food being cold when they pick it up. It DOESN&apos;T mean the restaurant did not intend for the food not to leave the restaurant at all, otherwise there would be NO to-go containers at all available in the restaurant.

 Okay Lords I get it. You can not answer an adult question without random caps and name calling. I was trying to deal with you on a different level but you will never come out of the gutter long enough to be a reasonable thinking or acting adult. Someone needs to bend you over thier knee and give you a spanking and throw you in&quot;time out&quot;for your uncalled for childish outbursts!
And until you have ever worked in a real restaurant we really do have nothing to discuss because you don&apos;t have a clue what you are yelling about.

You have OBVIOUSLY answered my question that you CANNOT PROVE that to-go servers do MORE WORK than fast food cashiers(excluding Sonic), because they DON&apos;T DO MORE WORK. It&apos;s just a FACT, NOT AN OPINION, A FACT!

OBVIOUSLY I DO have a clue, otherwise, you would have gave me some type of example where a to-go server does MORE WORK than a fast food cashier does. You CAN&apos;T come up with ANY EXAMPLES, can you?

 No I didn&apos;t read your post because of your inability to respond to a question without random caps and act like an adult. I skimmed it and refuse to read the entire rant because you will not behave. When you feel that you can respond in a responsible manor maybe I will read you insane concept of how a restaurant should be run and how we are so selfish or lazy and how your feelings were hurt. There have been so many people on this board and on bitter that have tried to help you yet you are too childish to entertain the concept that the grown ups know more than you do.
Most to-go servers(by the way they are carside or takeaway servers at the holes you chose to dine at)not only man the phones, make sure your order is correct, help with the expo line, deal with several different orders at one time.... no please don&apos;t bring sidework into it because then you will spew about you don&apos;t care. Whatever you think you know. You really don&apos;t. You have never worked in a restaurant therefore you are not an expert. Fast food workers have a tough job also especially when someone like you wants to rearrange the menu and add a million sides. They are not happy to serve you. They don&apos;t get paid enough to deal with a person so unhappy with themselves that they take it out on others. However they took that job without tips. Take out people take the job that should be tipped because they make sure that your 10000 sides of whatever come with your meal. But if you are a known nontipper or complainer as you are because you have such rotten service and complain about everything from chit chat to free refills you will not get hot pizza delivered, your sides of ranch will be forgotten. Not because we don&apos;t care about our jobs but we just don&apos;t care about customers like you. We give our best until we realize that our best is not appreciated by a child like you. I&apos;ve never had a customer complain to management at any restaurant they deserved free food because feelings were hurt, but then I wait on adults. Yeah some of them are out for a free meal. Some of them like you are inbred and don&apos;t know how to behave in public.
I have seen carside at Crapplebee&apos;s so backed up that it was a 30 minute wait for food. The two girls working it were nuts and balls to the wall. They both made over $100 that night. Why because it was a Friday and they treated every guest carside like a table. They answer the phone take the order ring the food in while the customer is on the phone, god forbid it is someone like you that knows everything(like that weight watchers should come with fries because somewhere else on the menu it said so but not in the ww section)and then read it back to you. Go to the kitchen and explain that some ignorant screw wants 3 sides of honey bbq, one side on bbq, 4 sides of tartar, and a gallon of the light ranch(sorry all of the Applebee&apos;s in SC,NC,Georgia, Virginia&apos;s, Penn, NY, serve lite ranch to everyone. Get it from the Applebee&apos;s whorehouse)I have never seen a Wendy&apos;s&quot;to-go&quot;server. They are counter help. You know like you used to be at the nut shop in what 1987? I feel sorry for you that you can&apos;t have a decent meal with great service. Do you think maybe that would be your fault for being so miserable in life? Nah didn&apos;t think so. See an entire post by an adult can be typed without random caps. Now grow up, apologize to thegirl, stop using random caps to prove you are an indiot(that is how you spell it right?), get a job itb, leave bigmomma alone, she is a better person than you will ever be, nuvola09 is smarter than you will ever be, bistroy is amazing something you will never be! Jena, Jammie and so many others are people to learn from! Fantastic people! You are not!

and many many more have tried to reason with you... so keep your misery and get a job in any restaurant.... wait you tried that and no one hired you because of your attitude.... imagine that~ sucks to be you. Prove me wrong again when you get hired. Most Crapplebee&apos;s have a personality test........ hmmmmmmmm can you pass that?
Don&apos;t think so, you want a sooooooooo soooooo sorry from your server but can never admit that you are an insult to life. You think you are so perfect yet the rest of us can admit our faults... remember I am a thief that stole pennies, whatever. Get a job at fast food and then a restaurant... not a nut shop.

 lords_of_acid,
How is this for an example, in fact, I KNOW I&apos;ve told you this before, so this is just you being an ignorant retard.

I used to work in fast food both as crew and as management, I&apos;ve also done ToGo&apos;s at a more contemporary restaurant. They are night and day. Totally incomparable. The ToGo server does way more work.

It&apos;s a totally different job, a worker at mcdonalds hands a burger out of the window, if you think this is the same as a ToGo server, then I can&apos;t help you.

And how did playlands and Hamburgler get involved in this argument? You amuse me to no end.

&quot;Most to-go servers(by the way they are carside&quot;

WHY bother mentioning carside, when I feel you should tip when you get food delivered to your car? I am ONLY talking about when a customer picks their food up INSIDE at the COUNTER, which is COUNTER SERVICE.

&quot;not only man the phones,&quot;

I answered the phones and NEVER got a tip, SO WHY THE HELL SHOULD THEY? I even took call-in orders over the phone at the donut shop even BEFORE I EVER worked in an office. Taking a phone call DOESN&apos;T MERIT a tip.

&quot;make sure your order is correct,&quot;

Fast food cashiers can do this too. This is NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. It&apos;s called CARING ABOUT IF WHAT YOU ARE SERVING IS CORRECT, WHETHER YOU GET A TIP OR NOT FOR IT. Since we don&apos;t tip Wendy&apos;s for making sure my food is correct, WHY should I tip for the to-go server making sure my Applebee&apos;s to-go food is correct? Again, I am PROVING YOU CAN&apos;T COME UP WITH AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE A TO-GO SERVER IS DOING&quot;MORE&quot;WORK THAN A FAST FOOD CASHIER!

&quot;help with the expo line,&quot;

If you are taking about food that is for the people DINING IN, then that has absolutely NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING, to DO with the service that the to-go server is providing the customer. That is other services for dine in customers.

&quot;deal with several different orders at one time.&quot;

So, you think McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, Burger King, KFC, etc., DON&apos;T deal with multiple orders too? This is STUPID to mention. Also, just because they are dealing with&quot;MULTIPLE ORDERS&quot;has NOTHING TO DO with the INDIVIDUAL PERSON&apos;S ORDER. Do you understand that? In other words, people aren&apos;t tipping you because you are getting Joe Schmoe&apos;s order together? The other orders have absolutely NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING to do with the service I am receiving when I pick up my order. Just because you happen to be getting together Joe Schmoe&apos;s, John Doe&apos;s, my order, and Jane Doe&apos;s orders all at one time has NOTHING to do with the service you are providing ME. WHY would ANYONE base a tip on something that has NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR SERVICE they are receiving?

&quot;Take out people take the job that should be tipped because they make sure that your 10000 sides of whatever come with your meal.&quot;

If I pick it up inside, NO, because McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, and Burger King make sure I have my sides of mayo, mustard, and/or tartar sauce as well. There&apos;s NOTHING DIFFERENT HERE EITHER. You STILL CAN&apos;T PROVE that to-go servers do more work than fast food cashiers(excluding Sonic). Again, I am ONLY talking about if I pick up my food INSIDE, NOT if they bring it all the way to my car.

&quot;I have seen carside at Crapplebee&apos;s so backed up that it was a 30 minute wait for food. The two girls working it were nuts and balls to the wall. They both made over $100 that night. Why because it was a Friday and they treated every guest carside like a table.&quot;

As I stated before, I AM***NOT***TALKING ABOUT GETTING MY FOOD DELIVERED TO MY CAR! I am ONLY talking about&quot;COUNTER SERVICE.&quot;

&quot;I have never seen a Wendy&apos;s&quot;to-go&quot;server. They are counter help.&quot;

I have had a Burger King cashier take the food to my car if it was a big order, because they ask if you can pull up, but the difference is, I paid at the window as well as got my change at the window, which to-go servers have to get the change or credit card, walk all the way back inside the restaurant to get the change or to ring up the credit card, then walk all the way back to my car to give me my change or credit card back. So when I get food delivered to my car, the to-go server does more work than the fast food(excluding Sonic)cashier does.

&quot;nuvola09 is smarter than you will ever be&quot;

She may be&quot;BOOK SMARTER&quot;, but she has NO COMMON SENSE. I have MORE COMMON SENSE THAN SHE DOES.

vitalryan
&quot;The ToGo server does way more work.&quot;

CAN YOU PROVE IT IN AN EXAMPLE OR SOME EXAMPLES? If you can&apos;t, then I&apos;ve proved you wrong.

&quot;It&apos;s a totally different job, a worker at mcdonalds hands a burger out of the window, if you think this is the same as a ToGo server, then I can&apos;t help you.&quot;

Unless you can come up with an example of a situation, I can&apos;t help you either believe me when I have WITNESSED that the Wendy&apos;s cashier did more work than a to-go server does.

&quot;How is this for an example, in fact, I KNOW I&apos;ve told you this before, so this is just you being an ignorant retard.&quot;

By you not PROVING your point with an example shows you can&apos;t, so that truly proves YOU are the RETARD. If you can&apos;t PROVE it and I CAN by what I have TRULY EXPERIENCED as well as have SEEN with my own two eyes, then WHO is the one who looks like a retard, huh?

nuvola09
&quot;Uh, we already have but you won&apos;t listen. Since you love to scour over old posts looking for spelling and grammar errors, you should be able to find our examples.&quot;

Obviously you CANNOT PROVE me wrong. You can&apos;t even come up with something new even. That just shows that you have proved me right.

&quot;And how did playlands and Hamburgler get involved in this argument?&quot;

Because you want to talk about how McDonald&apos;s began. WHO GIVES A CARE HOW IT BEGAN? The fact is, NOW-A-DAYS, we have 2 options- TO-GO OR FOR HERE at McDonald&apos;s. As far as the Hamburgler and playland stuff, I am just stating how times have changed, so WHY can&apos;t you understand that by bringing up how McDonald&apos;s began DOESN&apos;T PROVE ANYTHING and is truly INVALID to this argument?

 Well, loads, it seems that there are people that have done it full time, and those that have had to do it for just a short while.

I wonder who the ultimate judge would believe.

I wish to bring up this arguement...when you go to fast-food places, is your food really cooked to order? No. It is put together to order. Whopee!! The food is pre-cooked, and really isn&apos;t that good for you, but you really don&apos;t care about that.

Some people like it, some don&apos;t.

Now, say you call into Chili&apos;s, and order the same crap that you always order, and with all of the extras...I&apos;m pretty damn sure that they know who you are,(and while it seems like they&apos;re taking good care of you)something extra might just plop into the batter of your chicken fingers.

Really though, you may have perfected every possible way of re-heating crap food after taking it home, but you are also the exception. The microwave is on it&apos;s way out. [img]http://top100.kontraband.com/files/top100/1704/cdumper2.gif[/img]

 She may be&quot;BOOK SMARTER&quot;, but she has NO COMMON SENSE. I have MORE COMMON SENSE THAN SHE DOES. 

Wrong again!

Not only do I have an impressive post-high school track record, but I&apos;ve experienced lots of hard times in life. I&apos;ve been working and making my own money since I was 14, had to sell drugs when I was 16, was briefly homeless when I was 17 and have somehow managed to not kill myself because of bad doctors who took me on and off meds for dysthymia and seasonal affective disorder over the years.

I could have easily become a crack whore at 16, but I didn&apos;t. I&apos;ve been financially independent of my parents since then, and managed to live on my own as well. Someone with no common sense wouldn&apos;t be able to pick themselves up again and live on their own(I would have gotten my parents to buy me a brick house, like you did). I can confidently say I am savvy in school, and have scads of street smarts and lots of common sense.

I hate to be sexist here, but I attribute a lot of that to being raised by my dad. I try not to be overly emotional about things, and I try to keep problem-solving fairly basic. You, Lords, on the other hand, make things as complicated as possible, get very very emotional and make snap judgments before getting all the facts(typical of women). So basically, F***off.

Oh, and if you can&apos;t figure out why you should listen to vitalryan, you&apos;re the biggest indiot I&apos;ve ever known. But you&apos;d won that award a long time ago...

 Obviously you CANNOT PROVE me wrong. You can&apos;t even come up with something new even. That just shows that you have proved me right. 

First off, you&apos;re talking like a five-year-old on the playground, arguing about who&apos;s finger painting is better. Second, all you&apos;re looking for is new information? Like I said, we already provided you with plenty of examples. Why should we have to baby you and post new ones? You have not&quot;proved us wrong&quot;as you say, you&apos;ve just invented more and more BS to try to remain right in your own mind.

Lastly, no one has proved you right. You worked in a law office, so you might realize that the burden of proof is on you. We have already proved our end, whether you choose to realize it or not. You don&apos;t have a leg to stand on because you don&apos;t know squat about either industry.

 WHO GIVES A CARE HOW IT BEGAN? 

Because we were talking about intent. The company&apos;s intent back in the day determined their preparation. Their preparation has not changed over the years. Hamburgler has nothing to do with that. IT&apos;S like, DUH! as you would say.

For one thing, NO ONE has PROVED that a to-go server does more work than a fast food cashier on this board. Secondly, by not even trying to come up with something at all,******PROVES******YOU CAN&apos;T COME UP WITH ANYTHING TO PROVE ME WRONG. Even one little thing you CAN&apos;T come up with even. NONE OF YOU CAN! It&apos;s just hilarious.

&quot;Lastly, no one has proved you right.&quot;

By you NOT coming up with SOME TYPE of example of when a to-server does more work than a fast food cashier when the customer gets counter service, DOES PROVE ME RIGHT! You can&apos;t come up with ANYTHING. There ARE NO EXAMPLES ON THIS BOARD that show there is more work involved when a to-go server fixes an order at a non-fast food restaurant than a fast food cashier does for counter service.

&quot;The company&apos;s intent back in the day determined their preparation.&quot;

&quot;BACK IN THE DAY&quot;means EXACTLY THAT, NOT 2007! Their intent&quot;WAS&quot;DOESN&apos;T MEAN ANYTHING NOW. What their intent is&quot;NOW&quot;is what matters. We AREN&apos;T talking about back in the day when McDonald&apos;s was just serving to-go food. Now-a-days they DO HAVE tables and booths to sit at to dine in.

&quot;Their preparation has not changed over the years.&quot;

That is NOT TRUE. This has nothing to do with the argument of to-go food, but it IS something that has CHANGED at McDonald&apos;s: Remember when McDonald&apos;s had styrofoam containers to put the burgers in? Now-a-days they have paper to wrap the burgers in. My point is, THINGS DO CHANGE over the years. Their&quot;PREPARATION&quot;HAS changed in that they don&apos;t serve their food in stryofoam boxes anymore.

&quot;Hamburgler has nothing to do with that.&quot;

It has to do with the fact that THING HAVE CHANGED at McDonald&apos;s since it began. They didn&apos;t have a&quot;PLAYLAND&quot;if it was a to-go place ONLY back then. That was my point of why I mentioned it. The fact that things HAVE CHANGED over the years. It matters what is happening NOW.

&quot;Like I said, we already provided you with plenty of examples.&quot;

I found an example on this page for instance that still proves me right.

penelopemarie said this:&quot;we have one person that answers the phone, takes you order, rings it up, takes it to the back, preps the sides and dressings(those are not already prepared), takes the food and boxes it, and bag everything.
it is not pressing a little button on a computer, taking payment, waiting for the second half to throw the burger that ALREADY SOMEONE WRAPPED, the fries that maybe that same person put in a box, and throwing a couple of condiments in the bag.&quot;

With KFC, as I stated before, the***CASHIER***put my chicken in the box, NOT SOMEONE ELSE, THE********CASHIER**********! THE CASHIER PUT THE BEANS IN A CONTAINER AND THE MACARONI IN A CONTAINER. THE CASHIER PUT THE BISCUITS IN A BOX. I SAW THIS WITH MY OWN TWO EYES. THERE WAS NO HELP INVOLVED IN PUTTING THINGS IN THE BOX.

I still do NOT see ANYONE COMING UP WITH an example that proves me wrong, STILL!

&quot;if you can&apos;t figure out why you should listen to vitalryan, you&apos;re the biggest indiot&quot;

NO, if anything, BOTH of Y&apos;ALL ARE IDIOTS, because you CANNOT PROVE ME WRONG EVER! If you were right, you would write**SOMETHING**that could prove me wrong, but you CAN&apos;T nor can he, can y&apos;all?

 Omg, Lards/Kelly, are you still posting about this? Leave it alone already! Lucky for me I ignore all of your posts so I don&apos;t have to try to figure out what cheapass&apos;I&apos;m not tipping&apos;excuse you&apos;re both using today!
Just stop already!
Wow Lards/Kelly, green is really your color:

 &quot;CAN YOU PROVE IT IN AN EXAMPLE OR SOME EXAMPLES? If you can&apos;t, then I&apos;ve proved you wrong.&quot;

Umm, no, thats not how it works. Maybe you should read a book on debate. You haven&apos;t proved anything.

&quot;Unless you can come up with an example of a situation, I can&apos;t help you either believe me when I have WITNESSED that the Wendy&apos;s cashier did more work than a to-go server does.&quot;

Plenty of people have given plenty of examples. Again, if you think a cashier at wendy&apos;s who drops fries and a burger in a bag, and hands you a drink from the fountain 6 inches away is the same as a togo server, then you don&apos;t know what you are talking about, as EVERYONE here has pointed out.


&quot;By you not PROVING your point with an example shows you can&apos;t, so that truly proves YOU are the RETARD. If you can&apos;t PROVE it and I CAN by what I have TRULY EXPERIENCED as well as have SEEN with my own two eyes, then WHO is the one who looks like a retard, huh?&quot;

again, so many people have given examples, I didn&apos;t see the need. I&apos;ve done it, I have the experience, examples aren&apos;t really required. If someone who has done the job is TELLING YOU that it&apos;s not the same, well, idiot, that is EVIDENCE that it&apos;s not the same, and it&apos;s just about the best evidence you could ever get at that.

What you&quot;see with your own two eyes&quot;is laughable. Does it not occur to you that EVERY single person here is saying you are wrong, EVERY single person who actually works these jobs is telling you that you are wrong. And yet, you think you are right? If you are that ignorant, then no one can help you.

But as everyone has pointed out, answering the phone, having KNOWLEDGE of the food you are selling, explaining different items - ingredients, temperatures, what can and cannot be substituted, etc.. timing the food which takes 15 minutes instead of 30 seconds, then running to the other side of the restaurant, preparing condiments, expo&apos;ing your food, verifying temperatures, side items, bagging it, carrying it back to the other side of the restaurant, taking payments. And all this with several orders at once, yeah, thats just like dropping a burger in a bag and handing it to someone standing 3 feet away.

 iloveny(who supposedly isn&apos;t reading this)-

I am a bit confused on why you are posting a message to someone you wish to ignore. It is usually easier to ignore someone if you stop writing posts addressed to them.

I also see that you have once again posted a witty little picture and have completely ignored my previous post. I do understand that juvenile humor is much easier than rational discussion. I do have to congratulate you though - you managed to spell your insults correctly this time.

 I have seen several posts that seem to say that if you have never worked in a restaurant then you are not entitled to an opinion on whether a person should tip for takeout. In other words - Shut up and hand over the money. I disagree.

I fully admit that I have never worked in a restaurant and I am not an expert on how restaurants work. I am an expert on what I have experienced, though.

At a McDonalds drive thru I pull up and place my order - time elapses - I pull up to the pick up window - I pay for my order - someone hands me my food - I drive away.

At a restaurant for take out - I place my order(typically over the phone)- time elapses - I go into the restaurant - I pay for my order - someone hands me my food - I leave the restaurant.

To me these are fundamentally the same. I fully admit that I do not know what happens to turn the food order into food I am taking home. I don&apos;t know what it takes at McDonalds(and I am probably happier not knowing). I don&apos;t know what it takes at a real restaurant. But I do not see anything that I feel deserves a tip.

If I were dining in, I would see a server at my table side taking my order and answering any questions I have concerning the menu. The server would be bringing my food to me one course at a time and checking that everything was okay. During this time the server would refilling bread(if applicable)and drinks. I would see someone who is attempting to make my dining experience enjoyable for an hour or more that I know is not even being paid minimum wage for the privilege of waiting on me. While I am not a fan of the tipping system, I also would not show my dislike of it by stiffing the server. Therefore, I tip.

Noooo, no no no. You misunderstand. You&apos;re reading all the posts in this thread addressed to Lords. One example of why her theories make no sense and shouldn&apos;t be listened to is because she has no experience, but claims she knows all. You, on the other hand, admit to not having experience but also don&apos;t claim to know everything. Hopefully you&apos;re willing to listen to what insight we have on these topics(unlike Lords), considering we work in the industry.

 I fully admit that I do not know what happens to turn the food order into food I am taking home. I don&apos;t know what it takes at McDonalds(and I am probably happier not knowing). I don&apos;t know what it takes at a real restaurant. But I do not see anything that I feel deserves a tip. 

In some states, to-go&quot;specialists&quot;at full-service restaurants are paid less than min. wage, just like your table servers.

The assembly line at a fast food place is set up for speed and convenience of making an order to go. A restaurant line(behind or in front)is not. The person, oftentimes a server, preparing your order is going through sometimes double the prep work that a fast food worker goes through. This is one reason the food takes long than a drive-through(the other reason being that your food is, most often, made to order in a full-service restaurant).

If you are getting to go from a person who is not a labeled To Go Specialists, like the ones you see wearing the special aprons during night shifts at places like Applebee&apos;s an Chili&apos;s, you are most likely getting your order from a server or a bartender. In all likelihood, your to-go order will contribute to their total sales that they must tip out on. If this is the case, and you don&apos;t tip them, they pay out to the host/bar/bus staff on your order anyway. Again, I must stress that this depends on the restaurant youre ordering from because everyone&apos;s policies are different.

Does this help you understand how the two situations differ? I may think of more reasons later, if you&apos;re interested.

 kelly,
We have also said over and over that togo service and table service are different. The same level of tip expected in togo is about HALF that of table service.

Full service restaurants just do things differents. Tipping is a custom there, and they are designed to work with a tipping system, ToGo&apos;s as well. 90% of the people follow that custom even with togo&apos;s. I gave a list of what makes togo service different than mcdonalds as well only a couple posts up.

You said:&quot;Umm, no, thats not how it works. Maybe you should read a book on debate. You haven&apos;t proved anything.&quot;

IT DOES WORK THAT WAY, BECAUSE I HAVE THE EXAMPLES TO PROVE TO YOU ALL AND YOU ALL DON&apos;T!

&quot;What you&quot;see with your own two eyes&quot;is laughable. Does it not occur to you that EVERY single person here is saying you are wrong,EVERY single person who actually works these jobs is telling you that you are wrong. And yet, you think you are right? If you are that ignorant, then no one can help you.&quot;

The people that agree want the tip MONEY, YOU IDIOT, SO OF COURSE THEY WILL AGREE WITH EACH OTHER. OF COURSE they WOULDN&apos;T WANT TO ADMIT TO ME BEING RIGHT, OTHERWISE, THAT WOULD MEAN THEY WOULDN&apos;T MAKE AS MUCH MONEY. WHO CARES IF SERVERS SAY THEY ARE RIGHT, WHEN I KNOW FOR A&quot;FACT&quot;I AM RIGHT. HOW COULD I BE WRONG IF I CAN PROVE WITH EXAMPLES I AM 100% CORRECT?

&quot;But as everyone has pointed out, answering the phone&quot;

As I stated before, you don&apos;t get tipped for&quot;ANSWERING THE PHONE&quot;YOU IDIOT! SINCE WHEN DOES THAT HAVE****ANYTHING*****TO DO WITH SERVICE AS FAR AS TIPS GO? I didn&apos;t get tipped as a receptionist, the to-go server SHOULDN&apos;T EITHER! WHAT&apos;S FAIR IS FAIR!

&quot;having KNOWLEDGE of the food you are selling, explaining different items -ingredients,temperatures, what can and cannot be substituted,etc..&quot;

That&apos;s STILL*****NOT******SERVICE. You are just TALKING, THAT&apos;S IT! SELLING SOMETHING AND GIVING SOMETHING PHYICALLY TO THE CUSTOMER WOULD BE SERVICE as far as working in a restaurant goes. Also, I can ask about McDonald&apos;s food to a cashier just as easily. They MAY have the KNOWLEDGE, you never know. NO ONE MAKES TIPS FOR JUST TALKING ON THE PHONE TO SOMEONE, DUMBASS!

&quot;then running to the other side of the restaurant preparing condiments,&quot;

That&apos;s NOT TRUE AT CHILI&apos;S. I SAW WHERE my server got my condiments from when I was seated last year by the to-go area. It&apos;s***RIGHT BY****the condiment area. Also, I have had my cashier go ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OF THE MCDONALD&apos;S TO GET MY TARTAR SAUCE IN A CUP. I STILL DO NOT SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT STILL!

&quot;verifying temperatures, side items, bagging it,&quot;

That&apos;s what McDonald&apos;s workers do too, YOU IDIOT! NO DIFFERENCE HERE EITHER.

&quot;carrying it back to the other side of the restaurant,&quot;

As I stated before, at Chili&apos;s, the kitchen is RIGHT BY the to-go area. I SAW into the kitchen by the to-go area, SO I KNOW FOR A FACT! If you do have to walk further, as I stated before, it&apos;s just like them getting me my tartar sauce in a cup at McDonald&apos;s.

&quot;taking payments.&quot;

McDonald&apos;s does that too.

&quot;I have seen several posts that seem to say that if you have never worked in a restaurant then you are not entitled to an opinion on whether a person should tip for takeout. In other words - Shut up and hand over the money.&quot;

NO, I DO***********NOT**************HAVE TO WORK IN A RESTAURANT(even though I HAVE worked at the donut shop/diner(which IS a&quot;RESTAURANT&quot;)TO*****KNOW******WHAT GOES ON IN A TO-GO ORDER. IF I CAN**SEE**WHAT GOES ON, THEN HOW CAN I BE PROVEN WRONG? Also, by you saying&quot;Shut up and hand over the money&quot;shows me that&apos;s ALL YOU CARE ABOUT.

&quot;One example of why her theories make no sense and shouldn&apos;t be listened to is because she has no experience, but claims she knows all.&quot;

Experience as a CUSTOMER SHOWS me what they do and how far they got to walk even to do these things.

&quot;In some states, to-go&quot;specialists&quot;at full-service restaurants are paid less than min. wage, just like your table servers.&quot;

WHO CARES HOW MUCH THEY MAKE? QUIT TALKING ABOUT STUPID CRAP! WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO FOR THEIR MONEY! IF THEY DO THE SAME THINGS AS FAST FOOD CASHIERS(excluding Sonic)DO, THEN WHY SHOULD THEY GET TIPPED? Just because they make less DOESN&apos;T MAKE THEM DESERVE A TIP.

&quot;This is one reason the food takes long than a drive-through(the other reason being that your food is, most often, made to order in a full-service restaurant).&quot;

At the donut shop I worked at, the FOOD WAS MADE TO ORDER as far as burgers, sandwiches, fries, etc.! The glaze donuts were cooked to order. So this cook to order thing, that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the to-go server or tipping.

&quot;If this is the case, and you don&apos;t tip them, they pay out to the host/bar/bus staff on your order anyway.&quot;

WHO CARES if they have to tip out other staff? THE SERVICE REMAINS THE*********SAME*********, SO WHO CARES ABOUT THAT! THAT IS THEIR PROBLEM, NOT THE CUSTOMER&apos;S!

&quot;The person, oftentimes a server, preparing your order is going through sometimes double the prep work that a fast food worker goes through.&quot;

This is COMPLETELY FALSE! PROVE IT IF YOU DARE TO TRY! Also, preparation work COULD be sidework such as refilling mayo or mustard. That&apos;s something McDonald&apos;s employees would have to do too, you know.

Yes, and as an interior architecture student, I can verify that all Chili&apos;s are set up in exactly the same way. Same measurements and dimensions, and exactly the same distance from the To Go area to the kitchen.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Are you stupid? One chili&apos;s location being close to the kitchen doesn&apos;t mean anything. Many older chain locations had to have additions built on when the companies started working so much to go food, my old Applebee&apos;s included. They built them wherever it was convenient and/or where the zoning and building codes allowed them to build. And, yes, I do know what I&apos;m talking about because I&lt;u&gt;am&lt;/u&gt;and interior architecture student. I wasn&apos;t being sarcastic about that part.

To be taken seriously and have a good understanding of what you&apos;re talking about, you do.


 Also, by you saying&quot;Shut up and hand over the money&quot;shows me that&apos;s ALL YOU CARE ABOUT. 

Actually, that was a quote from Kelly that I was responding to. She was describing what her opinion was of the posts on this thread. Learn to read, dumbass.

Once again, I was responding to a question/comment that Kelly made. Shut up.

Preping a to-go order and sidework are two totally different things. And since we&apos;ve given countless examples to prove our point but you won&apos;t listen, I now challenge you to get a job in a restaurant to thoroughly learn the difference, since words and descriptions mean nothing to you.&quot;Seeing is believing&quot;seems to be your motto. Well, go stand in an Applebee&apos;s kitchen for an evening and witness what they do.

 Lords of Stupid,
You have given examples, and we over and over have notified you that your examples are not correctly portraying the job. We have also given you countless examples explaining the job and the differences. Your ignorance here is paramount, you are basically telling a scientist that he doesn&apos;t know what science is. Do you see the stupidity in this?

&quot;&quot;verifying temperatures, side items, bagging it,&quot;

That&apos;s what McDonald&apos;s workers do too, YOU IDIOT! NO DIFFERENCE HERE EITHER.&quot;

hey IDIOT, since when does mcdonalds cook burgers to order at specific temperatures?

I know you will never&quot;see anything different&quot;-- you haven&apos;t worked EITHER job. You have no clue how the expo line works at a restaurant, you have no clue how the inner workings of a mcdonalds differ from that of a restaurant, and whats worse, is you are completely shutting out all the people who are TELLING YOU how it works.

I managed a mcdonalds, I have worked togo&apos;s, jesus, I&apos;m TELLING YOU it&apos;s not the same, what more do you possibly need?

Going to the back and squirting a shot of tartar into a sundae cup lid is a hell of a lot different then going to the expo line and trying to get a line cook to prepare a side of madeira sauce that is cooked to order, while the expo is working 15 checks deep and the cook has 5 other items he&apos;s working on. Then timing when you can pick that up, since the ToGo station is usually on the other side of the restaurant is a whole new ballgame.

I&apos;m glad you are now arguing that certain things don&apos;t deserve tips, when at first the argument was&quot;the same amount of work&quot;-- once I proved that wrong, you took a different approach. I just gave you an****EXAMPLE******about how getting condiments is different and mcdonalds does***NOT****cook meat to order, which you called me an idiot and said they do.

This goes on and on, if you don&apos;t want to accept the testimony by quite a few people IN THE BUSINESS who DO THE WORK, oops, forgot the**************************, then you are only showing your complete ignorance. You make yourself look like an absolute fool.

When you work at mcdonalds, they train you for a few hours on how to operate a register, it&apos;s much different than the 2 days alone I needed for training on properly writing up a ticket, entering into the computer, etc... You need about 10 minutes to learn that a burger has mustard, ketchup, onions, and pickles at mcdonalds, you need about 2 or 3 days of hard training to learn every ingredient in every item, including marinades, seasonings, sauces, sides, etc... This translates into the service you provide, even when doing togo&apos;s. A mcdonalds worker will take your order in 30 seconds or less, pop a burger in a bag that is made in 45 seconds or less and hand it to you. This is much different than a highly trained server explaining the ingredients in the mashed potatoes in case of allergies, why you can&apos;t take the butter out of a madeira sauce, etc... Do you really not see a difference here? Or are you just playing stupid?

Thank god I now work somewhere you couldn&apos;t possibly afford to eat at.

It truly DOESN&apos;T MATTER, because it&apos;s NOT OUR FAULT as customers you have to walk further at one Chili&apos;s vs. another. Think about the different McDonald&apos;s. The ones in the mall are SMALLER than a regular stand alone McDonald&apos;s. So some McDonalds are BIGGER than others, meaning one McDonald&apos;s may have a cashier walk FURTHER for things than others.

I said: Also, by you saying&quot;Shut up and hand over the money&quot;shows me that&apos;s ALL YOU CARE ABOUT.

You said: Actually, that was a quote from Kelly that I was responding to. She was describing what her opinion was of the posts on this thread. Learn to read, dumbass.

YOU ARE THE DUMBASS, that CANNOT QUOTE people. You are supposed to put quotes at the beginning and at the end of a sentence someone said. By you just putting it in italics DOESNT mean you are QUOTING the person.

&quot;To be taken seriously and have a good understanding of what you&apos;re talking about, you do.&quot;

I KNOW WHAT I SEE, so YES, I DON&apos;T HAVE TO WORK AT A RESTAURANT TO KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.

I said:&quot;WHO CARES HOW MUCH THEY MAKE? QUIT TALKING ABOUT STUPID CRAP!&quot;

You said:&quot;Once again, I was responding to a question/comment that Kelly made. Shut up.&quot;

So, just because you were responding to her doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t respond to the nonsense you spew. What a person makes per hour has absolutely NOTHING at ALL to do with tips.

Preping a to-go order and sidework are two totally different things. And since we&apos;ve given countless examples to prove our point but you won&apos;t listen, I now challenge you to get a job in a restaurant to thoroughly learn the difference, since words and descriptions mean nothing to you.

REAL LIVE AND TRUE EXAMPLES OBVIOUSLY MEAN NOTHING TO YOU! NO, YOU HAVENT GIVEN***ANY***EXAMPLES TO PROVE ME WRONG. I have given you all examples to prove that I am RIGHT though.

&quot;Seeing is believing&quot;seems to be your motto. Well, go stand in an Applebee&apos;s kitchen for an evening and witness what they do.

I DON&apos;T have to, because I SAW what they did at the donut shop. BTW, you neglected to comment about what you said about that they cook the food to order. That has NOTHING to do with tips or a to-go server&apos;s job at ALL. Cooking the food to order has ONLY, ONLY, ONLY, to do with the COOK&apos;S YOU IDIOT! TIPS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT!

vitalryan
Your ignorance here is paramount, you are basically telling a scientist that he doesn&apos;t know what science is. Do you see the stupidity in this?

Gee, tonight, the 25th time we have been overcharged, was $1.50. The waitress ADMITTED she didnt BOTHER to add up the $4.99 charge to add crawfish with the $21.99 entre. She let the computer do it and yet, she FOUND THE TIME to WRITE THANK YOU and her name. But I bet she will be saying We dont have the time crap. So SEE, just because you are WHATEVER, DOESNT MAKE YOU AN EXPERT! Instead of 25%, she got under 4%. Sorry, but INTENTIONALLY ADMITTING YOU DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO ADD UP THE ITEMS IS TELLING ME IT WAS INTENTIONAL! MAKE ME DO YOUR JOB, Ill MAKE YOU PAY FOR IT! STUPIDITY YES, because if you rounded EACH item $22+5=$27, NOT what was on our check $28.48. We were supposed to be charged $26.98 for my husbands entre. GEE, doesnt that look like even if youve done it, which we tipped her before 20% on 04/13/07, she STILL MESSED UP. She didnt even TRY to make sure the computer didnt mess up. She put her 100% trust into the computer for her tip. WHAT A DUMBASS! Yet, she FOUND THE****TIME****to write Thank you and her name. Yeah, like that makes SELFISH SENSE! ONLY THINK OF TIP POINTS, but NOT WHAT IS TRULY MORE IMPORTANT! WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS CHARGING SOMEONE CORRECTLY! My point is, you can be a SCIENTIST or have experience in ANY FIELD, but that DOESNT mean you know EVERYTHING about it.

hey IDIOT, since when does mcdonalds cook burgers to order at specific temperatures?

HE STUPID IDIOT, SINCE WHEN DO*****TO-GO SERVERS***ACTUALLY************COOK***************ANYTHING, YOU IDIOT?

YOU ARE A***MORON***FOR MENTIONING SOMETHING THAT THE TO-GO SERVERS****DONT****EVEN DO, YOU IDIOTIC IMBECILE!

I managed a mcdonalds, I have worked togo&apos;s, jesus, I&apos;m TELLING YOU it&apos;s not the same, what more do you possibly need?

An actually**EXAMPLE**of WHEN YOU TRULY DO***MORE****WORK, which YOU HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO PROVE YET OBVIOUSLY, because the COOKS DONT COUNT IN WHAT A TO-GO SERVER DOES! The to-go server is making the tip, remember that. The cook ISNT!

Going to the back and squirting a shot of tartar into a sundae cup lid is a hell of a lot different then going to the expo line and trying to get a line cook to prepare a side of madeira sauce that is cooked to order, while the expo is working 15 checks deep and the cook has 5 other items he&apos;s working on.

So you think Mcdonalds ISNT working on drive-thru orders AS WELL AS to-go orders and dine in orders? ARE YOU THAT DENSE? NO, theres NO DIFFERENCE IN WHAT A*************************TO-GO SERVER***********************ACTUALLY DOES FOR THEIR MONEY! You are talking about the COOKS, NOT the TO-GO SERVERS! The TO-SERVER is the person making the tip, NOT THE COOKS!

You are talking about a LINE COOK to actually PREPARE a side of sauce,******NOT******THE TO-GO SERVER DOING IT, DUMBASS!

Also, putting some tartar sauce into a sundae cup or whatever cup is JUST LIKE putting mayo and mustard in cups at Chilis or Applebees, or Outback. There is****NO*****DIFFERENCE HERE EITHER. Ive gotten a lid for my cup before for my tartar sauce at McDonalds.

I really want to know WHY the you keep bringing up what the COOK does? WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? Also, by saying the cook has 5 other items he&apos;s working on is talking about what the****COOK****is doing, NOT what the TO-GO SERVER IS DOING! YOU ARE AN IDIOT!

Ask yourself a question: AM I TIPPING THE COOK OR THE TO-GO SERVER?

once I proved that wrong, you took a different approach. I just gave you an****EXAMPLE******about how getting condiments is different and mcdonalds does***NOT****cook meat to order, which you called me an idiot and said they do.

THE DONUT SHOP I WORKED AT COOKED THE FOOD TO ORDER, SO FREAKIN WHAT! DOES THAT MAKE ME DESERVE A TIP, JUST BECAUSE THE COOK COOKED THE FOOD TO ORDER? HELL F NO! THAT HAS NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING, TO DO WITH WHAT THE**********************TO-GO SERVER*********ACTUALLY DOES and YOU KNOW IT! THE COOK cooks the food to order, NOT THE TO-GO SERVER, YOU IDIOT PERSON!

You make yourself look like an absolute fool.

NO, YOU look like the FOOL that talks about what the CO-WORKERS DO, instead of what the*****************************TO-GO SERVER*******************************************ACTUALLY DOES! WHY MENTION SOMETHING THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH WHAT SERVICE THE ACTUAL TO-GO PERSON PROVIDES? SO WHAT IF A CO-WORKER(such as the cook)cooks the food to order? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? PLEASE TELL ME THAT? ID TRULY LIKE TO HEAR YOUR ANSWER.

A mcdonalds worker will take your order in 30 seconds or less, pop a burger in a bag that is made in 45 seconds or less and hand it to you. This is much different than a highly trained server explaining the ingredients in the mashed potatoes in case of allergies, why you can&apos;t take the butter out of a madeira sauce, etc... Do you really not see a difference here? Or are you just playing stupid?

My husband and I WERE****NOT******WAITING JUST 30 seconds at the counter to get our food at Wendys just about a month ago. We waited about 3 minutes at least, maybe more. The CASHIER ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER OUR FOOD AS WELL AS FILLED OUR DRINKS. She actually made my burger and I even had to tell her I had ordered onions, which SHE had to also remedy her mistake to put onions on my burger. SHE put my burger together as well as my husbands burger. SHE put the both sets of fries on the tray. NO, we didnt take it to-go, but still, for here or to-go, SHE still would have put everything in a bag instead of on a tray. SHE actually got a cup to put mayo in(a bunch of spoons worth)and a little mustard in a cup. SHE DID ALL OF THAT FOR************NO*******************TIP! TELL ME***HOW***IS THAT*****ANY****DIFFERENT THAN WHAT TO-SERVERS DO?

Thank god I now work somewhere you couldn&apos;t possibly afford to eat at.

WE CAN, we JUST DONT GO TO THOSE FANCY PLACES, because they arent as GOOD TASTING as the CHEAPER PLACES, HONESTLY. Honestly, I truly PREFER to have Wendys food than a fancy dinner.

I honestly want to know WHY the HELL you KEEP MENTIONING COOKED TO ORDER as if it is something the TO-GO SERVER DOES? WTF DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT THE TO-GO SERVER ACTUALLY DOES, HUH? The food at the donut shop such as when people would call-in for burgers or regular food items that werent donuts, they didnt tip me 99% of the time, SO WHY TIP ANYONE ELSE YOU IDIOT? The food was CORRECT, just that its COUNTER SERVICE, so whether or not the food is COOKED TO ORDER has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH WHAT THE PERSON THAT IS SERVICING YOU HAS TO DO, DUMBASS! I FOR SURE DIDNT DESERVE A TIP FOR THAT! I actually had to walk a ways to get the soft drinks. It WAS NOT(right by)the drive-thru. I had to walk on the other side of the donut shop to get it, so it wasnt as easy as Wendys has it right by the register. I STILL DO NOT THINK I DESERVED A TIP FOR THAT! WHY SHOULD YOU?

This translates into the service you provide, even when doing togo&apos;s. A mcdonalds worker will take your order in 30 seconds or less, pop a burger in a bag that is made in 45 seconds or less and hand it to you.

Thats NOT TRUE AT ALL, UNLESS YOU ARE IN DRIVE-THRU. Second of all, the Wendys experience we just went through recently I mentioned above, we waited several MINUTES to get the sandwiches fixed, NOT just 45 seconds.

Taking my order for a burger with fries is at Chilis is the SAME THING at McDonalds or Wendys or Burger King. It takes JUST AS MUCH TIME at EITHER PLACE to say Lettuce, mayo, and onions only and fries. Sure, I may add the medium well part, but big deal, thats 2 extra words and an extra button to push(gee that&apos;s tipworthy)NOT!! I also order sides of mayo and mustard at both places. If you consider putting cooking temperature as being tip worthy, you are nuts. That&apos;s not even doing anything more than pressing an extra button.

This is much different than a highly trained server explaining the ingredients in the mashed potatoes in case of allergies, why you can&apos;t take the butter out of a madeira sauce, etc... Do you really not see a difference here? Or are you just playing stupid?

YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND TALKING IS NOT EXTRA WORK! If I ask what comes on a burger at Wendys and they tell me each thing that comes on the burger, thats talking also. Are YOU just plain STUPID to realize that talking and having knowledge have NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH SERVICE at restaurants? Talking DOESNT get you a tip at McDonalds and it certainly shouldnt get you a tip at Chilis or Applebees or Outback for counter service. Also, 90% of people already KNOW what they want BEFORE they even get there or when they order, they dont even ask any questions whether its in person or over the phone. What about those people that just order and don&apos;t ask any questions? I bet you still think the to-go server should still get a tip, huh?

When you work at mcdonalds, they train you for a few hours on how to operate a register, it&apos;s much different than the 2 days alone I needed for training on properly writing up a ticket, entering into the computer, etc... You need about 10 minutes to learn that a burger has mustard, ketchup, onions, and pickles at mcdonalds, you need about 2 or 3 days of hard training to learn every ingredient in every item, including marinades, seasonings, sauces, sides, etc...

WHAT in the WORLD does this have to do with actually SERVING a customer a to-go order at the counter? Training has NOTHING, AT ALL, TO DO WITH SERVING SOMEONE A TO-GO ORDER.

 You are supposed to put quotes at the beginning and at the end of a sentence someone said. 

Aha! She does know how to use quotations! Wasn&apos;t I yelling at you about this, like, a year ago? You keep using quotations incorrectly to emphasize statements, when all you&apos;re doing it making yourself look ridiculous. Now that you&apos;ve told me that you know how to use them, please take your own advise. And I&apos;ll use italics in lieu of quotes any day I damn well please. Other people seem to figure it out just fine, and so have you up until now.


 It truly DOESN&apos;T MATTER, because it&apos;s NOT OUR FAULT as customers you have to walk further at one Chili&apos;s vs. another. Think about the different McDonald&apos;s. 

Okay, but... you were the one using it as an example of why you shouldn&apos;t tip to-go workers when you said, &quot;If you do have to walk further, as I stated before, it&apos;s just like them getting me my tartar sauce in a cup at McDonald&apos;s. &quot;I was merely pointing out that you don&apos;t have a leg to stand on because, once again, you have no friggin&apos;idea what you&apos;re talking about.


 I really want to know WHY the you keep bringing up what the COOK does? WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? 

Cooking the food to order in a full-service restaurant kitchen means there is a totally different set-up than in fast food. The to-go server must be in constant communication with the line to let them know what they need and when they need it. You have dining room orders coming out along with to-go orders, and it&apos;s the expo and to-go servers responsibility to organize everything and set it all up.

And assembly line at a fast food place does not work like that. Everything is preped and wrapped the same way. It&apos;s more efficient for to-go because that&apos;s what it&apos;s set up for(yes, they have booths, you crazy bitch, but that doesn&apos;t change the way an order is prepared).

Your to-go server at a restaurant is in constant negotiation with the cooks and the expo to organize your order. The work is more intricate and requires more skill and knowledge. And this is all because the food is not pre-cooked. If it were, the to-go person wouldn&apos;t have to go through most of that hassle.

I just want to point out the only reason I&apos;m still arguing with you on this thread is because it get tiring bouncing between Myspace and Facebook when I&apos;m bored. Thank you, Lords, for being SO stupid that you keep me occupied this long.

 That post was way to long, and the absurdities I&apos;ve come across while skimming it right quick just made me not even want to read it.

Sorry Lords, you just aren&apos;t worth that much time. Keep your posts shorter and people may actually read them.

I did catch the part about the sauce, as I keep pointing out, the ToGo server has to go back there and fight to get that side made, talk to the expo, catch the right cook at the right time, they also have to time returning to the kitchen at just the right time to pick it up since it takes several minutes to make and they can&apos;t sit there and wait, since they have several cars lined up awaiting service and a phone ringing off the hook.

As I said before, if you really think this is no different than squirting mayo into a cup, then you are beyond stupid.

As others have pointed out as well, there is a REASON why they have an expo in a restaurant. This is usually the hardest job, as negotiating an order is very difficult with so many different cooks and types of items, overloads of checks, etc. It&apos;s intricate, it&apos;s not a mcdonalds assembly line...

You have shown yourself to be a retard, I don&apos;t need to help you with that anymore. And jesus, you are the only one I&apos;ve ever seen whine and cry about a little mistake, a buck or two. In my years of serving, I&apos;ve not only never had this happen on my own checks, I&apos;ve never seen OR heard of anything like this happening. And you even remember the date you last dined with that waitress, you sick idiot.

I&apos;m finished with ya, I think. Ciao.

 Exactly iloveny,
Anyone who would rather eat a disgusting wendy&apos;s burger over a nice filet mignon or prime rib, is either two things. One, has no class, and you nailed it on the head&quot;trailer trash&quot;. Or two, really can&apos;t afford it.

I&apos;m actually leaning towards both with LOA. The reason being, we don&apos;t get people like her in my restaurant.

 I have seen posted that servers when doing to-go orders are required to tip out bus people/bar/hostess on the to-go order. Is that correct? That makes no sense to me. Why would you tip out people that had nothing to do with the order? In a takeout situation, no table was bussed, no one seated, and it is highly unlikely that bar services were used.

I have also seen it stated that there is no difference in the quality of food between eating it in the restaurant and taking it home to eat. I have to disagree. I have stated before that I rarely order takeout from restaurants(not including fast food). The reason for that is that it just doesn&apos;t taste as good as when I dine in the restaurant.

However, I do agree that it is possible for cheap restaurants to taste better than expensive ones. I have eaten at P.F. Changs, and I prefer the local chinese buffet. And there are times I would prefer a hamburger to filet mignon - it all depends upon what I am hungry for at the time. However, assuming I am not craving a hamburger - steaks will win hands down.

That&apos;s just how the system works. Computer systems are not sophisticated enough to separate your to-go sales from your dine-in sales. At the end of the shift, you just tip-out on the whole amount. This is only if it is a server doing to-go orders, the way bartenders usually have to during afternoon or when a server rings in a to-go order for their table. The To-go specialists that you may see at certain chains usually don&apos;t tip out anybody. Maybe an expo, but even that is a stretch.

Other than the everyday occurrence of bartenders doing to-go order during the afternoon(nearly every restaurant I&apos;ve worked at does this, chains or not), I have a good example. Not long ago, I had a guy sit down and have lunch at one of my tables. His-dine in food amounted to about $30. Then he ordered over $150 of to-go food. Thankfully, he tipped 20% on the whole order. I would not only have to tip-out my support staff on that entire bill regardless whether it was dine-in or to-go, I also am responsible for setting up the to-go boxes and packaging up the order. This takes just as much, if not more, time than a normal dine-in order.

That&apos;s was Lords, and she&apos;s an idiot.

This concept has absolutely NOTHING at ALL to do with customers service they receive. HOW is Communicating with the cook have ANYTHING to do with what service the customer receives? Thats co-worker to co-worker work, NOT to-go server to customer work.

Your to-go server at a restaurant is in constant negotiation with the cooks and the expo to organize your order.
I will say this again, SO WHAT if you are communicating with your co-workers! WHAT IN THE HELL DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOW MUCH SERVICE YOU ARE PROVINDING THE CUSTOMER? So you dont think I havent ever seen a cashier at McDonalds asking the cook to fill my cup with tartar sauce at times? QUITE a NUMBER of times this has happened. She was COMMUNICATING with her co-workers FOR NO TIP!

Computer systems are not sophisticated enough to separate your to-go sales from your dine-in sales.

That is why an actual HUMAN BEING should KEEP the restaurants copy of the receipts so that they CAN KNOW which ones are to-go orders. The to-go server can keep copies of their receipts. They can ADD them up at the end of the shift. So, quit blaming the COMPUTER SYSTEMS and start blaming the LAZY to-go servers who dont want to put forth the EFFORT to make sure they ONLY tip out dine-in sales to their co-workers.

I also am responsible for setting up the to-go boxes and packaging up the order.

I had to put together donut boxes, SO WHAT? Packing the orders, thats what the KFC CASHIER did for my chicken, my macaroni in the container, the baked beans in the container, and even got a thong to put my biscuits in a separate box. That CASHIER CANT receive a tip, WHY SHOULD YOU for doing the same or less amount of work?

I also am responsible for setting up the to-go boxes and packaging up the order. This takes just as much, if not more, time than a normal dine-in order.

How can you say it&apos;s more work than a dine-in situation? I would say it would be a very rare case for a dine-in situation to be more work than a to-go order. When a person eats inside, they&quot;USUALLY&quot;(not always)get refills, the server has to bring the food to the table(or another server), they have to get condiments at times, they have to bring napkins at times, sometimes they even have to bring utensils to the table, in MOST restaurants they bring you your check and pick up your method of payment to ring it up, they check on you from time to time to see if things are ok, they also fix food problems if they occur, they also have to get overcharges fixed at times, they also have to get a manager to take off a coupon, they have to come to take your order which usually entails writing the order down, etc. I would say an example of more work may be a person that orders something simple dining in alone, doesn&apos;t need refills or condiments or napkins or anything extra for that matter or nothing went wrong, and even gets up to pay their bill compared to someone&apos;s order that would be worth $150 that would contain several items that may have condiments and special things to alter. I would say MOST situations are more work when someone dines inside than to-go orders.

As I said before, if you really think this is no different than squirting mayo into a cup, then you are beyond stupid.

There isnt a difference in that the to-go SERVER can put the condiments in a container just as a fast food cashier can.

the ToGo server has to go back there and fight to get that side made,

Usually, at most chain restaurants, the ranch is NOT HOMEMADE, so grabbing a jar or bottle of ranch or mayo is NOT THAT DIFFICULT. Whats to be MADE? Also, lets say they have homemade ranch, thats the**COOK**making the ranch, NOT the to-go server, dumbass!

since it takes several minutes to make

For one thing, the to-go server is NOT making anything. Secondly, it doesnt take SEVERAL MINUTES to fill a container with a condiment, thats BS! Even if I asked for 3 sides of condiments, that wouldnt take several minutes. I could do that under a minute.

And jesus, you are the only one I&apos;ve ever seen whine and cry about a little mistake, a buck or two.

That buck or 2 turned into a LOT MORE THAN THAT OVER THE YEARS.

$1.38 Wrong price from menu for soft drinks($1.99 was charged, but the menu stated $1.30 for each soft drink at a Mexican restaurant called Mi Mamacitas.
$0.75 - Charged for extra cheese when I ordered extra onions, not extra cheese-Corkys Bbq
$0.50-$0.25 on a margarita listed as a price on the menu that the server charged me for the wrong margarita due to I ordered a margarita that was on their menu that had blue curacao, but they were out, so I ordered one of their regular margaritas on their menu, which I was charged for the one with blue curacao which was 25 cents more. 25 cents I more I was overcharged for extra bbq sauce, even though we had gone there MANY, MANY times at OHenrys Food&amp;Sprits, I was NEVER charged extra before for bbq sauce, which they took off both 25 cent issues off the check.
$1.51 House Salad charged without an entre, but I ordered an entre at a restaurant that is no longer in business which was called Maxim.
$11.00-Waiter rung up wrong table on my credit card at Applebees
$21.50-Waiter at Chilis rung up wrong table on my husbands credit card
$1.50-Wrong price from menu at Copelands.
$4.50-Estimating the wrong amount rung up on my credit card which was $23 and something cents and I was rung up $27 and something cents, which is $4 and something cents overcharge at Bennigans.
$3.00-Grand Mariner shot I NEVER ordered that was for the table behind us at Outback.
$15.00- Estimating 3 free wines that were supposed to be taken off with a purchase of an entre for each person at the table at Zea Rotisserie&amp;Grill Restaurant.
$0.31-Waiter not giving back my FULL AMOUNT of change from $34.69. He only gave a $5 bill back, but no cents at local seafood and Italian restaurant called Tecoros.
$0.04-Cucos Rita $4.95 menu price, charged $4.99-Waitress at Cucos Mexican Restaurant.
$0.04-Cucos Rita $4.95 menu price, charged $4.99-Waiter at Cucos Mexican Restaurant.
$0.50-Chilis Ribs that had on an old menu that was given to me when I ordered which had $13.99 and we were charged $14.49 from the waitress we had. My husband received the newer menu.
$0.30-Ribs at Outback-$17.29 was charged, but on the menu had $16.99 from the waitress we had.
$0.30- Fox and Hound had $6.99 on their menu for a sandwich my husband ordered and we were charged $7.29 from the waitress we had.
$4.91- This is adding up an over and an undercharge at Chilis from the waiter we had. Was actually charged $6.50 for a drink I NEVER ordered, but wasnt charged for a $1.99 coke. I figured out tax and that is the price with tax I was overcharged.
$1.50-Bennigans waitress took my $20 off comp paper for a previous bad service experience and gave it to the manager to fix, but still handed us the bill with $18 and about fifty cents off instead of $20 off the bill as she could SEE it should have been.
$5.25- Charged for a drink I NEVER ordered at Chilis from the waiter we had.
$4.00-Charged an extra $4 for Bacardi just because I ordered a pina colada with Bacardi rum, which I was charged altogether $8 for a pina colada that I was charged for lots of times in the past at that restaurant only $4. The waitress admitted it was a mistake.
$7.00- At Chevys Fresh Mex, the waitress actual charged us $9.95 for both my husband and Is margaritas which one was $5.95, the other was $6.95.
$4.75-I, the week before, had gotten a margarita made with Jose Cuervo at this seafood and Italian restaurant called Tecoros for $4.50. A week later, a waitress charged me $9.25 for the same exact margarita, same exact size glass. They fixed it, so I was correct. The next times I went in there, still only charged $4.50.
$0.25-Waitress not only got my drink order wrong, but also charged me for the wrong drink which was a 25 cent difference in the drinks at Serranos Salsa Company.

Grand Total:

$89.79

Some of these dont include the taxes. NONE of these include the extra gratuity that would have been made by the servers due to the higher check amounts.

It is also not counting when my mom in 1996 or 1997 was charged for eggs she didnt order at a restaurant called Russels Grill in Hammond Louisiana when I had gone to college back then. Things like getting the wrong check at Corkys in 2001 could have possibly been an undercharge, which I have no idea what the check total was that we had received back then. Another thing was getting a wrong check at a restaurant called Lagers. Another thing was getting charged for something, when my husband had ordered something else at a Mexican restaurant. Thats 4 more times who KNOWS what amount were overcharged in those situations. These I listed are the situations I can remember, which possibly there might be more, I dont remember right now.

A buck or 2 over approx. 6 and years turns into a LOT MORE THAN A BUCK OR 2. Even if you subtract the $21.50. the $11 overcharge, and the $15 which are the bigger overcharges, its still $42.29. A LOT MORE THAN A FEW BUCKS HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. A little mistake is like the four cent overcharge or 30 cents or anything pretty much under a buck. ANYTHING OVER A BUCK IS PRETTY HUGE. I NEVER saw ONE of these servers take ONE CENT out of their pockets not to make me WAIT LONGER to get the check fixed, so OBVIOUSLY these servers I had wanted EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PENNY they made to belong to THEM. They DIDNT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS MONEY, SO WHY THE HELL SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THEIR MONEY? What goes around, comes around. You steal from me, I steal most of your tip from you or possibly all of it. If the servers that overcharged me as little as 30 cents would have just given me 2 quarters to basically make up for the taxes and extra tip as well as the hassle, I would have tipped them 13% instead of one of these servers I tipped 8%. See, they care about EVERY SINGLE PENNY THEY MAKE. If they feel a few bucks is a lot, then HOW IS IT*****************ANY***************DIFFERENT FOR THE CUSTOMER TO FEEL THE SAME EXACT WAY ABOUT THEIR MONEY? The 2 times I had the 4 cent overcharges, they didnt give me a nickel or 4 pennies as the server SHOULD do not to make me wait for something THEY should have noticed considering its not even a quarter worth even, but you see that they CARE A HELL OF A LOT ABOUT THEIR MONEY, DONT THEY? 4 cents is still TOO MUCH MONEY for a server to part with, but YET, its OK for the customer to part with money for an overcharge that is usually MUCH MORE than a few cents.

If servers would handle things the way one waitress did which I will be telling you, then they would receive at least 13% tip for overcharging me, even if it was a buck. One waitress at a restaurant called Lagers, one time gave us our check. For some reason, the check she printed out was for the people that sat their before us. She took 2 things off the bill without her managers permission. Yeah, that could have gotten her fired, but she did it. She got a decent tip. See, ONE server was caring out of ALL those overcharges. See how EVERY SERVER IS OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR MONEY, but its OK to overcharge the customer though and still feel like they deserve a decent tip though, huh? I will not pay someone well to not care if they overcharged me. Its sad that all of those servers, except for the Lagers waitress, were SELFISH that they couldnt take it out of THEIR money.

A couple of waitresss recently had the time to write THANK YOU and signed their name on their check(meaning ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR TIP), but yet they couldnt FIND THE TIME to make sure they werent overcharging us. Its a SELFISH WORLD OF SERVERS OUT THERE FOR THE MOST PART. It is RARE today to find a server that would part with 4 cents even. If I was a server and lets say I overcharged someone even 50 cents. Id just give the customers 75 cents(to cover taxes and tip)not to have the hassle of getting the check fixed. You know what; I bet I would get a decent tip for not making them have the hassle of getting the check fixed? I also would feel better about mistake to MAKE-UP for it in SOME WAY. Today, servers dont want to take 4 FREAKIN PENNIES out of THEIR OWN POCKET, but yet its OK to take it from the CUSTOMERS POCKET. THIS IS RIDICULOUS to have overcharges at restaurants EVER! It is COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE 100%! If they care about their money so much, WHAT&apos;S WRONG WITH CARING ABOUT MINE? I didn&apos;t see ANY of them(besides the Lager&apos;s waitress)that showed they CARED about OUR MONEY. They care A LOT about a few bucks and even you all say at about 10% for take-out. For a $20 take-out order, 10% is $2. You all are begging for that $2, but yet it&apos;s NOT OK for me to want our 2 bucks back when we got overcharged? You are such a HYPOCRITE. You want your 2 bucks, WHY can&apos;t I have MINE? WHY can&apos;t I feel my 2 bucks is important just as you do or just as a lot of to-servers feel?

And you even remember the date you last dined with that waitress, you sick idiot.

I didnt remember the date I last dined. I keep my receipts, which I looked it up you idiot. I do remember the servers of the people that stole from me though.

In my years of serving, I&apos;ve not only never had this happen on my own checks, I&apos;ve never seen OR heard of anything like this happening.

Thats because MOST PEOPLE DONT EVEN LOOK AT THEIR BILL and secondly, since we go out very often, it can HAPPEN MORE OFTEN. The less times you dine out, the less it can happen to you.

You have to remember, we go out to eat friday and saturday EACH weekend since 2001. Possibly a weekend or 2 we may have skipped over the years, but MOST weekends we go out to eat. We also sometimes go to eat at one restaurant, then go get drinks at another. So sometimes that&apos;s 3 restaurants in one weekend. The more you go, the more it can happen. 2 of the times this year, 2 overcharges for extra drinks happened when we just got drinks.

I bet if you surveyed everyone in a restaurant, only 5% would say they check the prices against the menu as well as the entire check in general. Even my father-in-law says he didn&apos;t think about checking the prices, but he does check for extra items or wrong items. My point is a LOT of people DON&apos;T double check their check, so if you don&apos;t know you have an overcharge, it doesn&apos;t get reported or even if some people do know, they may not bother with reporting 30 cents due to the hassle of getting it fixed. So that makes situations unreported when customers don&apos;t tell anyone or know about it even.

 The moral of the story is that you&apos;re a sad human being. No one dedicates their life to trying to bring servers to justice.

All the crap you just said has no relevance because you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. You can&apos;t tell us how hard or easy our job is being you don&apos;t do it , we do. You have no idea what it takes to do our jobs.

And it&apos;s just sad you are able to keep track of all those mistakes on your checks. Just sad.

You dedicate your life to bring customers like me to justice, so WHAT&apos;S THE DIFFERENCE?

&quot;All the crap you just said has no relevance because you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about.&quot;

No, I KNOW what I am talking about. The fact is, talking to your co-workers about getting condiments has NO relevance to what&quot;SERVICE&quot;the CUSTOMER is receiving. The talking back and forth to the kitchen staff is working for the restaurant, NOT for the customer. People don&apos;t tip their servers when they eat inside partly because a customer orders a side of ranch after they have their food delivered, meaning, the server has to COMMUNICATE with the cook. The COMPLETE REASON the customer is tipping their server is because their server is****BRINGING*****the ranch to the table. The tip is**NOT**for communicating with the kitchen staff. Since when do you tip for that when you dine inside a restaurant? If you don&apos;t, then WHY would ANYONE in their right mind consider that when getting take-out? I am willing to bet your tip is not being based on co-workers communicating; that it is based on the server&apos;s SERVICE they are providing you? MOST people tip on their server&apos;s service they provided, NOT if they have to talk with their co-workers. People tip based on actual&quot;SERVICE&quot;, NOT communication with the rest of the staff.

You still NEVER answered my question:&quot;HOW is Communicating with the cook have ANYTHING to do with what service the customer receives?&quot;

I would like to know your answer, because honestly, communicating with your co-workers is************NOT**************service.

&quot;You can&apos;t tell us how hard or easy our job is being you don&apos;t do it, we do.&quot;

I can and I don&apos;t have to&quot;DO IT&quot;to KNOW. You are forgetting I HAVE done call-in orders before at the donut shop.

&quot;And it&apos;s just sad you are able to keep track of all those mistakes on your checks. Just sad.&quot;

It&apos;s sad that you probably have been ripped off sometime or another, but were to lazy to pay attention to your check. It&apos;s sad that a lot of people don&apos;t look over their checks for errors. It&apos;s sad they don&apos;t care about the money they earn. It&apos;s sad that people&apos;s time is worth more than their money they have spent time at WORK to earn to bother with getting back 50 cents even.

I am willing to bet you have been overcharged or even undercharged at least once in your lifetime at a sit-down restaurant, but you wouldn&apos;t know, because you probably have never bothered to verify each exact price on your check?

 LOA,
That is YOUR tipping procedure, maybe. Fortunately, a vast majority of guests do not feel the same way you do.

Most consider the extra work in dealing with the kitchen and other issues worthy of extra gratuity. You may not agree, and thats why I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t wait on people like you.

You are quite stubborn, it&apos;s almost comical(except that you are a lunatic so that makes it not so funny). On every site you post on, whether as Springs1 or LOA, almost everyone tells you that you are wrong and have no idea what you are talking about. Even non-servers. Since tipping is a custom, and is pretty much regulated by what the public feels is reasonable, doesn&apos;t that basically mean that if everyone(the public)tells you that you are wrong, well, then you are wrong?

You can tip based on your own whacky rules, in fact, our steps of service are the top in the nation, and your little 32 things a server should do list almost completely disagrees with what we feel is propper service. Yet we are very busy and everyone raves about our service, funny how that works.... guess you are WRONG.

But anyways, tip however you want based on whatever rules you want, thats how tipping works, nice eh? But stop acting like the authority on tipping, since, as everyone has pointed out, you don&apos;t know what you are talking about.

 I don&apos;t think I&apos;m ever going to get over the fact that you have the mind of a 5-year old.

Communicating with the kitchen is how you, the customer, get anything. If no one worked with one another, you wouldn&apos;t get service. Period, the end. You just wouldn&apos;t. And the original question regarding this Kitchen Communication Issue was more along the lines of&quot;Why is take-out harder in a full-service restaurant?&quot;, that question being a byproduct of&quot;Why should I tip for take-out?&quot;

Umm, no you can&apos;t tell us whether or not our job is hard or easy. You just can&apos;t. I work in a Houston&apos;s in Los Angeles. Do you? Umm, not so much. You can try to tell me what the difficulty level of my job is, but you&apos;re just being stupid.

And I&apos;m not sure when you decided that my life&apos;s goal is to&quot;bring customers to justice.&quot;Seriously, you are a 5-year-old. I&apos;m not the one jumping to every website imaginable that will allow me to post my BS about how to do a job I know nothing about. We asked you this question years ago, and I am reminded of it again: Don&apos;t you have friends? A social life? Do you even speak to your husband? You spend all this time online making 41 point lists about how someone should do a job you know nothing about. You&apos;re on a pointless crusade, and it&apos;s so pathetic.

And of course I&apos;ve made mistakes on checks in my meager 5 years of serving and bartending. I&apos;m human, I&apos;m busy, I&apos;m slightly dyslexic, very blonde and can be absent minded. But I do good work, I know that much. If I didn&apos;t, I wouldn&apos;t make any money and wouldn&apos;t be able to hold down a job.

What you don&apos;t seem to get is when a mistake is made that it&apos;s rarely malicious. For you, I can&apos;t say that confidently because if I knew who you were and waited on you, I&apos;d want to punch you in the face. Any server who&apos;s gotten wind of what you&apos;re like can&apos;t possibly be putting their best foot forward. I wouldn&apos;t, you&apos;re not worth it. You expect your server to go behind management&apos;s back and do something that could compromise their employment to make you happy, and then you tip them 13%? You&apos;re a psycho.

And if everyone checked every item against the menu, no one would get anything done. No one. I have never seen one person do that in all my years of working in restaurants, no one ever will, and I certainly never will. And I guess that makes me lazy, uncaring, selfish and money hungry, right?

That is all for now. Thank you once again for entertaining me for another 20 minutes.

 I just LOVE reading how stupid LOA keeps making herself out to be post after post.

Every server story I read on here I can relate to. 10years of working in a 4-star restaurant(that does take in people like LOA from time to time)and you can honestly say you have seen it all.

And while I wouldn&apos;t punch you in the face LOA, I would defiintely make sure a customer like you would get your drink LAST, your order taken LAST, your food served LAST, tell our busperson to not worry about you...maybe a little culinary alterations too.

People like you should seriously reshape your dining habits after seeing how @$$holes are treated when dining out.

LOA, go watch&quot;Waiting...&quot;(or watch it again, since it apparently didnt sink in)and stop wasting your breath babbling on here to people would could care less what you think

&quot;Since tipping is a custom, and is pretty much regulated by what the public feels is reasonable, doesn&apos;t that basically mean that if everyone(the public)tells you that you are wrong, well, then you are wrong?&quot;

NO, because I KNOW WHAT WE GO THROUGH with our service. If I would be wrong, then WHY IN THE HELL WOULD HAVE I HAD SOOOOO MANY DAMN OVERCHARGES OVER THE YEARS, WRONG FOOD, MISSING CONDIMENTS, ETC.? Don&apos;t give me that BS about people make mistakes, because A LOT of these servers DID NOT&quot;TRY&quot;TO GET THE ORDERS CORRECT OF EVEN&quot;TRY&quot;NOT TO OVERCHARGE US. Doing things MY WAY would make almost NO MISTAKES PERIOD, instead of the MANY, MANY, MANY ZILLIONS of mistakes that occur at each table, everyday in non-fast food restaurants. If I was wrong, then WHY would a customer get a wrong entre or a wrong side dish or any missing condiments from the THEIR SERVER(NOT ANOTHER SERVER)? The reason is LAZINESS AND BEING UNCARING. Think about it. When your server takes your order, they HOPEFULLY WROTE IT DOWN, so this written order is SOME WAY to VERIFY that the food is correct or not. I feel if YOU took the order, you should take RESPONSIBILITY for***BRINGING OUT THE FOOD CORRECTLY***as far as those OBVIOUS things go I listed since your TIP is on the line. I also wouldnt have my check with extra items if I was wrong. I also wouldnt have a wrong price on my check if I was wrong. THESE TYPE OF MISTAKES(which I feel ARENT MISTAKES, just a lack of EFFORT)COULD BE PREVENTED BY THE SERVER IF THEY TRIED. WHY do you feel you should have to point out to your server a price is wrong on your check? Do you HONESTLY FEEL you should have to take a menu and make sure EACH ITEM YOU ORDERED is EXACTLY CORRECT? If you tell me YES you are LYING, because I bet you DO NOT DO THIS YOURSELF? If you tell me you do, that&apos;s BS and you KNOW IT!

&quot;Even non-servers.&quot;

That&apos;s because maybe they DO NOT GO OUT TO EAT A LOT OR they NEVER order complicated things or ever check their check for overcharges to KNOW they had been overcharged.

I KNOW&quot;WHAT TYPE OF SERVICE I RECEIVE&quot;when I get take-out, which A LOT of people AGREE WITH ME NOT TO TIP FOR TO-GO ORDERS. So you are WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, ON THAT ONE.

Also, some people even on this board agree not to tip for to-go orders. So its NOT JUST ME. To-go orders when you pick them up inside is counter service, which is what you get when you go to Mcdonalds, Wendys, Burger King, and KFC. Theres NO INCREASE in the amount of work you do for either type of restaurant.

&quot;You can tip based on your own whacky rules&quot;

WHAT rules are&quot;whacky?&quot;

 http://howtobeagoodserver.blogspot.com/ 
My blog, so which ones are wacky according to you? Just name some numbers. I would like to know.

Even getting refills without being asked or asking CAN be a true TIME WASTER as well as a WASTE of RESTAURANT&apos;S PRODUCTS. HOW IS THAT&quot;WHACKY&quot;to want to be able to order for yourself? When someone orders a soft drink, they are ordering that glass, NOT refills of that glass. The refills are up to the CUSTOMER to decide if they&apos;d like another of the same drink or not.

Checking over the cook&apos;s work is NOT WHACKY. If anything, at times, when the food is wrong(which is literally 70% of the time at least a missing condiment is not there)it saves the server TIME not to have to walk back and forth to get the missing item or items or the correct item.

Overcharges are important for the server to make sure they are charging the customer correctly, because their TIP is on the line. Also, I truly cant COUNT the number of times I have been not charged for a soft drink. Youd be SURPRISED at how many servers dont charge us for soft drinks. It happens to us A LOT.

I honestly DO NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG with my steps to be a GOOD server. Follow this list and mistakes will happen very RARELY. There will always be errors at times, just because we are all human, but in general, the errors would definitely be much less than what they are now-a-days.

Does it make sense to you for the&quot;SAME&quot;SERVER to write down that you wanted to add a side of ranch, then YOUR SERVER comes with the plate of food without the ranch on the plate? That&apos;s just NOT TRYING. What kind of EFFORT is that? It makes the server look STUPID and VERY LAZY not to reread what they wrote down. ONLY one side of ranch, which some servers are TOO DAMN LAZY to make sure it&apos;s on the plate when they bring it to you. That&apos;s sad, it really is.

&quot;Most consider the extra work in dealing with the kitchen and other issues worthy of extra gratuity. You may not agree, and thats why I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t wait on people like you.&quot;

NO, all of those sites I have quoted before PROVED to you LOTS of people DO NOT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT. MOST people in general DO NOT tip for take-out. YOU ARE WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! They don&apos;t consider ANY of that as&quot;SERVICE.&quot;

This is quoted from above to PROVE to you MOST PEOPLE DO NOT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT, EVER!

 http://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=470548 

Look at this website. Look at ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT DONT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT.
BottomFeeder said There&apos;s no point in doing so since all this person did was wrap up my food that someone else made for me, and that&apos;s it.

Kaiser said Tipping on take-out? Why, because you carried the styrofoam containers from the kitchen and bagged them for me?

SDscooby said Agreed, I don&apos;t tip on take-out. Thats just ridiculous.

Incorporeal said I dont tip for takeout, I tip about 20%+when I eat in though.

Hunter S. Thompson said And no I don&apos;t tip if I get take out. If someone delivers it then I will.

Eric Anderson said Yeah&apos;GEE THANKS FOR OPENING MY BEER!!! here is a buck!&quot;

honestly... when did we start taking moron pills. - THIS one was to PROVE my point that opening a beer is LESS SERVICE than a McDonalds employee does to give me a coke with ice.

Stitkacik said&quot;Takeout = no tip.&quot;

nhluhr said&quot;This means no tips for Takeout.&quot;

Eric Anderson said&quot;And I NEVER do for takeout.&quot;

 http://www.fohguild.org/forums/general/29367-take-out-tipping.html?highlight=tip ping+take-out 

Cadrid said the only people really working with to-go food are the chefs whom wouldnt see a dime of the money if I tipped.

Zuuljin said I actually had one of the servers tell me that I forgot to tip him when I made a pickup. I told him that I didnt forget, I just dont tip for take out and he said that I should tip regardless. I then asked him if he gives a 10%-15% tip whenever he picks up his food at a drive through at a fast food place. He said no, and I told him, Exactly and just walked out. If your going to apply a tip, might as well apply it universally right? If you tip at a restaurant for takeout, then tip the guy behind the counter at McDonalds or burger king. They both did just as much work getting your food to you.

My point is EXACTLY just as I pointed out in my post above this post. It should be treated just like getting food to-go at McDonalds or Burger.

Goldenrod said: since you only typically get at most 10 orders at a given shift, you are left with a lot of free time.

So you mean to tell me they are not even working hard at times? Like they should get tipped for that? GET REAL!

Also look at another thing this person said: they also boosted your hourly pay from 3.50 up to 6.50 an hour

So I just proved 2 different people saying their pay was INCREASED when they did to-go orders.

Goldenrod also said The fact that people generally dont tip the servers who take your order over the phone, enter it into the computer, take it when it is finished cooking and wrap it and bag it,

That second site is THIS YEAR. People that are NORMAL and have a brain KNOW it&apos;s the same or less amount of work that fast food workers do. All you want care about is the money. WHY would you not want to be fair to everyone by not tipping for take-out orders? We can&apos;t tip McDonalds or Wendy&apos;s or Burger King. They do sometimes MORE WORK than some to-go orders such as a pasta dish vs. a burger order at a fast food place.

This is another site I found as well:
 http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=330567 

jfe said: So, I placed the order, and the food was ready, and as cute as she was, I decided not to leave a tip.

Slippahs said: I usually don&apos;t... guess I should start leaving just a little tip, but the way I look at it, there&apos;s really no service involved except bringing the food from the kitchen to the cashier, so why bother?&quot;

FromYYZ_flyer said: I dont tip for takeout. When in a restaurant you tip the waiter for his service, not the cooks. Why should I pay a counter girl/guy to walk 5 steps and hand me a box?

Cordelli said: I never tip for takeout if it&apos;s just calling and going to pick it up.

Couscous said the next person after Cordelli: Same here...

Gnedge said: I never tip for takeout. It has never occured to me to even think about it.

Oldpenny16 said: I don&apos;t and won&apos;t....

GoingAway said: If I walk in, get my order and walk out -- no tip.

This is just as I said COUNTER SERVICE.

Boilermaker said: I think we were the only ones who tipped, as once they go to know us we would find larger portions, extra desserts, etc. in the bags.

Notice how Boilermaker said I think we were the ONLY ones who TIPPED. They got extras, because they were in a sense PAYING for these extras through the TIPS. This person obviously KNOWS MOST PEOPLE DONT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT ORDERS AT THE COUNTER. I am NOT talking about food getting delivered to your car.

Analise said: Take out: No

Bruiser said: I don&apos;t tip for take-out

Liverbug says it ALL: THE RESTUARANTS USUALLY PAY THE TO-GO PEOPLE MORE PER HOUR BECAUSE THEY KNOW MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT TIP FOR TAKE OUT.

See, MOST PEOPLE DO NOT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT. THAT IS WHY THEY RAISE SOME TO-GO SERVERS HOURLY WAGES. Theres a REASON FOR THAT.

Liverbug also said: To-go earns their money per hour, not for throwing some forks into a bag for you.

Princessmom said: Wow, I too have never thought of tipping for pick up food. Never have and I don&apos;t think I ever will.

Pucci Galore said: The people behind the counter - no.

SemiElite said: I&apos;m glad to tip a waiter who spends significant time waiting on me, but I think tipping for bagging my purchase and ringing up my charge is a bit much!

thirdcoAAst said: but don&apos;t tip counter folks. How else am I to get the food besides them handing it to me?

&quot;Communicating with the kitchen is how you, the customer, get anything. If no one worked with one another, you wouldn&apos;t get service. Period, the end. You just wouldn&apos;t.&quot;

The McDonald&apos;s cashier communicated with the cook in the back to fill a cup with tartar sauce at times for me. That&apos;s&quot;COMMUNICATION&quot;for NO TIP. So tell me WHAT is the DIFFERENCE in the communication you have a non-fast food restaurant? Even if there is, that communication is partly why you are getting paid anything at all from the restaurant. You still have to do SOME WORK to get paid from the restaurant. You arent getting paid hourly to just restock things or prebuss.

&quot;You spend all this time online making 41 point lists about how someone should do a job you know nothing about.&quot;

If I knew NOTHING about it, I wouldn&apos;t be getting SOOOOOO MANY MISTAKES, now would I? I would be checking everyone&apos;s check against the menu as well as my pad of paper that I wrote EVERYTHING that was ordered on. Also, I truly can&apos;t count the times I was not charged for a soft drink or 2. Sometimes it could be people like vitalryan that try to get a better tip, but sometimes it&apos;s just forgetfulness and lack of going back over the check carefully.

&quot;And of course I&apos;ve made mistakes on checks in my meager 5 years of serving and bartending.&quot;

Don&apos;t you feel they were VERY PREVENTABLE? I mean, especially if you make time to write&quot;thank you&quot;on customer&apos;s checks. Also, were these mistakes overcharges or undercharges or both? Think about how you could have PREVENTED those situations and that you made your********CUSTOMERS************VERIFY THEIR CHECKS, WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THEIR*******SERVER**********TO HAVE DONE THAT INSTEAD. Think about that you made your CUSTOMERS WORK FOR YOU, when its supposed to be the OPPOSITE SITUATION AND YOU KNOW THAT IS THE TRUTH. Do you HONESTLY feel when YOU are a CUSTOMER that you should have to TAKE a MENU and VERIFY EACH ITEM TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE CHARGED CORRECTLY, which is basically baby-sitting your servers work that THEY could have done? If you say YES you are LYING, because usually hardly ANYONE CHECKS OVER THE BILL.

Also, what did the people do when they tipped you in that situation? Did you get a lowered tip or a stiff? Did you have customers seem kind of pissed at you? Also, HOW MUCH did you overcharge customers or undercharge them?

Don&apos;t you have friends? A social life? Do you even speak to your husband?

YES I DO.

You spend all this time online making 41 point lists about how someone should do a job you know nothing about.

If I didnt know NOTHING about it, I wouldnt know how to***PREVENT***the MISTAKES OR CARELESSNESS I SEE that servers make. I would know how to prevent situations such as your mistakes you have made on checks that you admitted you have done.

But I do good work, I know that much. If I didn&apos;t, I wouldn&apos;t make any money and wouldn&apos;t be able to hold down a job.

NO, bad servers still keep their jobs, because a lot restaurants have a hard time finding dependable workers that keep a steady job. Just because you come to work DOESNT make you a good server or a good worker at any job.

What you don&apos;t seem to get is when a mistake is made that it&apos;s rarely malicious. You expect your server to go behind management&apos;s back and do something that could compromise their employment to make you happy, and then you tip them 13%? You&apos;re a psycho.&quot;

You act like it&apos;s mostly not intentional, but I say it partly IS. 2 of the servers THIS YEAR, decided it was MORE IMPORTANT to care about their&quot;TIP POINTS&quot;by taking TIME to write&quot;Thank you&quot;and signed their name INSTEAD of PAYING ATTENTION to WHAT THEY WERE CHARGING ME. One of the bitches was at Outback that even bothered to write it on the REVISED copy of our check AS WELL as the original overcharged check with an extra $3 Grand Marnier Shot that was ordered at the table in front of us, WASTING MORE OF OUR TIME. That really shows how much SHE ONLY cared about HERSELF.

I don&apos;t want them to go against their manager by giving free stuff away. I want them to TAKE THE OVERCHARGE OUT OF***THEIR***OWN POCKETS TO MAKE ME NOT WAIT AROUND TO GET THE CHECK FIXED. Don&apos;t you get that? Servers should be giving you the money back they took away, NOT getting the check fixed by the manager by PUNISHING the CUSTOMER TO HAVE TO WAIT LONGER TO LEAVE. They should be trying to MAKE-UP FOR THEIR MISTAKE BY NOT EVEN TELLING THE MANAGER UNTIL AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAS LEFT. Especially when an overcharge is a little as just 30 cents. To think THEIR 30 cents is important to the SERVER, so WHY can&apos;t it be IMPORTANT to the CUSTOMER? I don&apos;t see these servers take 45-50 cents out of their pocket to make up for the extra taxes and gratuity for a 30 cents overcharge, heck, they don&apos;t want to take out 1 cent, SO F&apos;THEM! They don&apos;t care to take the TIME and EFFORT to care and only worry about their TIP POINTS, then I will worry about my money ONLY, NOT THEIRS. What goes around, comes around.

I NEVER would condone a server stealing from the restaurant. That is THEIR DECISION to make, NOT MINE. If they want to get arrested or get fired, that&apos;s them. They CAN, however, take THEIR OWN MONEY OUT OF THEIR POCKET to pay the customer for their overcharge as they should. If they want a tip if they have overcharged someone, they should be paying THE CUSTOMER TO DO THEIR JOB THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE! I will say this again: Do you honestly think you should be having to double check things people hand you, even at McDonalds? You SHOULDNT, but the difference is at McDonalds, there are NO TIPS to be earned by the people that hand you things, so theres NO INCENTIVE to get the order correct. THEY WILL GET PAID NO MATTER WHAT THEY MESS UP.

When I get undercharged, I pay more in the tip. It&apos;s up to the SERVER to decide to be honest to the restaurant to ring it up. WHY should the customer get punished for an undercharge? If I choose to tell the server everytime I didn&apos;t get charged for something I ordered, instead of a decent tip, they&apos;d get 8% or less, because it&apos;s the SAME WAIT to get the check fixed no matter which way it goes. For instance, a server a few months ago didnt charge us for 2 soft drinks that were $2.49 a piece. Our bill was $79 and something cents. We left her $21, which was 25% of what the original bill would have been. See, if we would have told her and she would have gone to ring up both of them, she would have received around $6-$7. Now which would YOU RATHER? Even if she paid for both soft drinks AFTER we would have left, she would have still been tipped 19% from the tip money she paid the drinks for from. See, this way, not only did the customers(us)get to leave earlier, but also, she got to get seated other customers FASTER at our table, increasing her chances to make more tips. So its a WIN, WIN, situation. If the server doesnt notice, thats NOT my problem if they dont charge me. They have extra money in the tip to pay for the item or items. Dont act like you are supposed to punish ME for your carelessness, because I will NOT pay you well to punish me. My time is worth something and I shouldnt have to be ANYONES BABY-SITTER, because I am there to have a nice time, NOT to deal with that crap. I am there to enjoy eating my food and drinking my drinks. I am NOT there to have to tell the server things they should have noticed, especially extra items on the bill is easy for a party of 2. We get free soft drinks LOTS of times from Applebees and Chilis for instance. I feel sometimes its intentional to get a better tip, sometimes its not.

Also, HOW IS IT&quot;PSYCHO&quot;to treat people EXACTLY THE WAY THEY TREATED THE CUSTOMER, HUH? That&apos;s just doing unto others as they had done to you. You stab my back(of course not literally, but you know what I mean), I stab yours. You treat me like my money isn&apos;t important, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH TREATING YOU THE SAME EXACT WAY? You get what you give into ANYTHING in life. You study 20 mins. for a final exam that is hard, you may not make an&quot;A.&quot;You study for hours for that test, you just might make that&quot;A.&quot;Same difference with the amount of EFFORT you put into your customer&apos;s dining experience. You don&apos;t take the effort to make sure they are charged correctly, WHY should they fork out the money much at tip time? You don&apos;t care about their money, so WHY should they care about yours? You don&apos;t care about their time if you have overcharged them not to double check the check, so what kind of tip do you expect?

&quot;And if everyone checked every item against the menu, no one would get anything done. No one&quot;

YES the work WOULD get done. For one thing, for instance, where you worked before at Applebees, there are to-go menus, so it was simple to bring that around in a pocket. You wouldnt have even needed to get a regular menu. Let&apos;s say I have a check with 6 items, which 2 of them are soft drinks that aren&apos;t listed on the menu. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT REALLY TAKES TO VERIFY ONLY 4 items? Maybe 30 seconds, to a minute, probably not even that long. Also, there is NEVER an excuse to charge someone for an item they NEVER ordered or a wrong item such as the stupid waitress that charged me for a salad as if I never ordered an entree when my husband and I BOTH ordered entrees, which he didn&apos;t even order a soup or salad. WHY should I have had to point out that it had a special price for the salads with an entree, when I had NEVER been there before and secondly, I did NOT WORK THERE. A customer should NEVER have to PROVE something is printed on a menu, EVER! Thats for the STUPID, LAZY, and UNCARING SERVERS.

Think about this check we had at Chilis this July, which we did have quiet a bit on there, but their(most restaurants also)dont list soft drink prices nor do they list alcoholic drink prices.

PresidenteRita $6.79
Blue Pacific Rita $6.99
Super Premium X(white russian)$7.25
2 Beverages 16oz $4.18
Classic Nachos $6.59
Add Beef $2.00
Chipotle Burger $7.29
Chipotle Crisper $8.99
3 Sweet Shots $5.29

-----------------------------

PresidenteRita $6.79
Blue Pacific Rita $6.99
Super Premium X(white russian)$7.25
2 Beverages 16oz $4.18

These items are NOT even on the menu to check the exact prices against the menu. The only things you can do for these items are make sure no extra charges are on the check, make sure that no incorrect items are on the check, and make sure that nothing purchased is omitted from the check. Its just a simple as verifying the pad of paper with the check.

Only 5 items to check against the menu. This would take a minute at MOST to check everything, probably 30 seconds honestly to check 5 prices against the menu. HOW HARD IS THAT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARENT STEALING FROM THE RESTAURANT(an undercharge)OR YOUR CUSTOMER(an overcharge?

&quot;I have never seen one person do that in all my years of working in restaurants, no one ever will, and I certainly never will.&quot;

That&apos;s because the world of servers is SELFISH in that they ONLY care about their OWN MONEY. Just look at the bitch waitress at Outback that took the time twice to write&quot;thank you&quot;and signed her name on the overcharged check and the revised one. See how&quot;HER MONEY&quot;was more IMPORTANT than the CUSTOMER&apos;S MONEY OR TIME. If you honestly think she gave a rats ass about MY MONEY, you are stupid. She wasnt writing thank you to be nice. She was writing it to INCREASE HER TIP.

If I was a server, I would for EVERY CHECK, because I actually would CARE about OTHER PEOPLE&apos;S MONEY and my tip would be affected as well as it should be. See you DON&apos;T care about your customer&apos;s money and you are too LAZY to make sure you are charging the customer correctly. WHY do you feel it&apos;s somehow the&quot;CUSTOMER&apos;S JOB&quot;to make sure they are being charged correctly? WHY should they have to do ANY WORK or LIFT A FINGER for their server? Isn&apos;t the server supposed to******************EARN*****************their tip?

&quot;And I guess that makes me lazy, uncaring, selfish and money hungry, right?&quot;

YES it does. Think about it, you COULD take an extra minute or even less, to make sure you aren&apos;t overcharging the customer if you CARED about your customer&apos;s money, which obviously YOU DON&apos;T. Talk about SELF-CENTERED. You are admitting you do NOT care about your customer&apos;s money by not taking the EFFORT to PREVENT those errors. There&apos;s NEVER an excuse to overcharge someone, because it&apos;s SO PREVENTABLE. Like the waitress at Outback that this year overcharged us $3 for a Grand Marnier shot we never ordered due to her charging our table instead of the table in front of us that had ordered that decided to write on both the revised copy and the overcharge copy of the check&quot;Thank you&quot;signed her name and even circled the total, but yet didn&apos;t use that VALUABLE TIME to catch something I caught within 5 seconds AFTER drinking 3 drinks. You mean to tell me you don&apos;t have time to catch extra items or wrong items? Also, do you bother to waste VALUABLE TIME(even though you say you feel you don&apos;t have the time to catch an overcharge)to write the&quot;Thank you&quot;on checks? If you have time to write that crap(which is thinking of YOUR TIP ONLY), then you have the TIME to make sure you haven&apos;t overcharged someone, especially extra items or wrong items.

9)They give you candy or write&quot;thank you&quot;on your check think,&quot;obligation kicks in.&quot;

See, writing this crap is for the**********SERVER*********ONLY, NOT for the customer. It wastes TIME that could be MUCH BETTER SPENT ON FINDING OVERCHARGES AND UNDERCHARGES. Also, the part of about giving candy is stupid, because usually the RESTAURANT provides that, NOT the server. Its not like the SERVER is buying candy for the customer, GET REAL, when they cant even shell out 4 cents out their own pocket for overcharges.

1. Lords of acid, you are a worthless cheap piece of @&amp;$% that needs to just shut up, stop posting on here, and go dig a hole somewhere.
Thats because people like you are TOO LAZY ASS AND UNCARING to GIVE A SH## about your customers. You dont want to do MORE WORK to EARN your pay.

3. Yea, I checked you are still an mindless idiot. I hope you are a&apos;regular&apos;somewhere so much so that the people do remember you(WE DO REMEMBER THE&apos;BAD&apos;CUSTOMERS TOO!)

First off, if I was MINDLESS I wouldnt have caught EVERY FREAKING OVERCHARGE THAT THESE STUPID AND LAZY SERVERS HAVE DONE TO US. Secondly, I remember EVERY SINGLE BAD EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE THE NAMES OF THE SERVERS I DESPISE. I remember by name, the name of some of the servers that have given me bad service. I also have receipts to try to remember servers names. Also, if I was SO MINDLESS, I wouldnt SEE the mistake BEFORE it even hits the table that my side dish is wrong or condiments are missing, but yet the SAME SERVER that took my order didnt bother to CARE to NOTICE. THATS MINDLESS OF THEM!

&quot;And while I wouldn&apos;t punch you in the face LOA, I would defiintely make sure a customer like you would get your drink LAST, your order taken LAST, your food served LAST, tell our busperson to not worry about you...maybe a little culinary alterations too.

Why do you feel that I am a MEAN person? I just treat people the way they treat me. If they are too lazy to care about my dining experience to go well, why should I give them a great tip? Please tell me, I would like to know your answer?

LOA, go watch&quot;Waiting...&quot;(or watch it again, since it apparently didnt sink in)

I&apos;ve seen&quot;Waiting&quot;already, SO WHAT, it&apos;s a movie. Sure people spit in people&apos;s food, but you know what, if they aren&apos;t sick, it truly doesn&apos;t do anything to the customer, NOT A DAMN THING. Think about it logically. Let&apos;s say if Jane Doe server spits in my food, unless she&apos;s sick, it will NOT affect me at all.

stop wasting your breath babbling on here to people would could care less what you think&quot;

If they cared less, they wouldn&apos;t be responding, now would they?

 Ah, two weeks on Cape Cod and I come back to this:

&quot;and even got a thong to put my biscuits in a separate box&quot;

Please note the quotation marks. AT least I came home to a good laugh, that&apos;s priceless.

We dined all over the Cape and never did get an overcharge. Over 10 meals, $2,000 in meals-yet no overcharge. We did have a few mistakes in our orders but it was fine, they were fixed. Nobody died and the meals weren&apos;t ruined. We loved chatting with the servers when they had time to talk.

Lords, do you ever go out to eat and just enjoy yourself? We dined on the water in Provincetown at sunset and had a fabulous evening, in clam shacks and all sorts of non-chain restaurants and never had a problem. Of course, I don&apos;t consider small things a problem and when I&apos;m out being served a meal I&apos;ll enjoy with company Ienjoy, well, life is good. It just doesn&apos;t get much better than that.

You seem to think that going out to eat once or twice a week since 2001 makes you some sort of expert in service. I&apos;m sorry but it doesn&apos;t. You eat in low-end chain restaurants and I&apos;m pretty sure you walk around with an expression on your face that would suggest that you have a stick up your ass. Rather than enjoy your meal and the company you&apos;re with, you&apos;re watching your service. Do you ever just enjoy yourself?

I now eat out more than seven times per week and rarely get an overcharge or bad service. I think it&apos;s the places you frequent and your very obvious attitude that makes the servers hate you.

 &quot;If I would be wrong, then WHY IN THE HELL WOULD HAVE I HAD SOOOOO MANY DAMN OVERCHARGES OVER THE YEARS&quot; 

You thinking you know anything about what goes on in a restaurant, which you don&apos;t, doesn&apos;t prevent mistakes from happening to you. The Restaurant Gods don&apos;t work like that.

I&apos;m starting to believe, once again, that servers simply don&apos;t care about you because of how you act and treat them. If they have free time, they&apos;ll add some items to your check 1)just to f around with you and 2)so they can get some&quot;dead&quot;food in the kitchen to snack on.&quot;Gosh, I have this wicked bitch at one of my tables, lets see if she and that poor sap she&apos;s with notice an extra salad or two.&quot;


 &quot;A LOT of people AGREE WITH ME NOT TO TIP FOR TO-GO ORDERS. So you are WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, ON THAT ONE.&quot; 

Our argument isn&apos;t that people don&apos;t tip on take-out, or even that a lot of them think they shouldn&apos;t. We&apos;re explaining why you should. Just because a lot of people don&apos;t want to tip on take-out doesn&apos;t change the reality that in many cases in full-service restaurants, you should. Sorry. And by the way, in my experience and my friends&apos;experiences, most people do tip on take-out. They just tip less than table service, which is one reason to-go people are often paid higher wages.


 &quot;WHAT rules are&apos;whacky?&apos;&quot; 

Uh, all of them? Even non-servers on howto.com(or whatever the hell that site was)told you they were wacky and completely stupid.


 &quot;If I knew NOTHING about it, I wouldn&apos;t be getting SOOOOOO MANY MISTAKES, now would I?&quot; 

see above


 &quot;So tell me WHAT is the&apos;DIFFERENCE&apos;in the communication you have a non-fast food restaurant?&quot; 

Already did that. You love scouring over old posts, so go re-read them while your husband is out having affairs since you&apos;re such a pain to be around.


 &quot;Don&apos;t you feel [your mistakes] were VERY PREVENTABLE?&quot; 

Maybe some of them. But I rectify them quickly. Mistakes can happen because of a slip of the finger on the computer screen, management forgetting to update a price, miscommunication between you and a co-worker who took a request from your table, etc.

I try not to make ringing mistakes because, believe me, it&apos;s more of pain for us than it is for you(both timewise and it almost always adds paperwork for us to do at the end of the shift). Many times I catch mistakes before anything hits the table, regarding incorrect food or an incorrect check. It&apos;s not so much that I prevented the problem, it&apos;s that I took care of it without the guest even knowing what happened.


 &quot;Also, what did the people do when they tipped you in that situation? Did you get a lowered tip or a stiff? Did you have customers seem kind of pissed at you? Also, HOW MUCH did you overcharge customers or undercharge them?&quot; 

To my recollection, I&apos;ve never been punished for a mistake like that. And I cannot answer your questions individually because I don&apos;t keep a god damn journal of my experiences from over the years, penny for penny.


 &quot;Also, HOW IS IT&quot;PSYCHO&quot;to treat people EXACTLY THE WAY THEY TREATED THE CUSTOMER, HUH?&quot; 

It&apos;s psycho because you&apos;re not so much applying that godforsaken golden rule as much as you&apos;re simply being angry and vindictive. You think you&apos;ve been violated, and you punish people for it. That&apos;s not being fair, it&apos;s being retaliatory.


 &quot;I don&apos;t want them to go against their manager by giving free stuff away. I want them to TAKE THE OVERCHARGE OUT OF***THEIR***OWN POCKETS TO MAKE ME NOT WAIT AROUND TO GET THE CHECK FIXED. Don&apos;t you get that?&quot; 

Yeah, I do get that.

And yeah, you do want them to do that. You raved about the girl who did it for you that one time, and you&quot;rewarded&quot;with her with 13%.

You should also know that servers, most of the time, don&apos;t have much cash or don&apos;t have adequate change with them. And, if there&apos;s an overcharge on your card and they give you cash to compensate.... look, it just doesn&apos;t work that way. You constantly want special treatment and customized rules for just you, but you need to be treated just like everyone else who has an overcharge or a mistake. Your server can&apos;t and shouldn&apos;t just whip out cash to make it all okay.

Now that I&apos;ve killed some time with all this, I&apos;m going out to dinner with my roommate, and I&apos;ll be sure to watch for those pesky overcharges and annoying auto-refills and will report back to you, you psycho.

 Lords, your post is way too long, I&apos;m not going to waste my time reading it.

If you would like to discuss something, post a couple points in a more appropriate fashion and I&apos;ll answer them for you.

Actually, I noticed a couple points real quick... For one, your 41 rules don&apos;t work, because you don&apos;t know how restaurants work. They all work differently and are just not compatible with what YOU seem to think is right. For example, I&apos;d be fired if I took 3-5 minutes or whatever to greet, and I&apos;d also be fired if I didn&apos;t automatically bring refill drinks as soon as your beverage hit half full. The list would go on and on and I&apos;m just not going to get into it.

And lastly, most people DO tip for takeout, when I did ToGo&apos;s, I&apos;d say 1 in 10 didn&apos;t tip, thats a high percentage compared to table service, but 10% is a far cry from&quot;most&quot;. So again, this only reinforces that you actually do NOT have any idea what you are talking about.

You thinking you know anything about what goes on in a restaurant, which you don&apos;t, doesn&apos;t prevent mistakes from happening to you. The Restaurant Gods don&apos;t work like that.

For one thing, a LOT and I mean, A LOT of these times its**NOT**as what you called it a MISTAKE. I recently, just this July, got an overcharge at a local chain restaurant. The item was $21.99, came with a COMPLIMENTARY SIDE(according to the menu)and if you wanted to add crabmeat, it was an extra $4.99. Well, the waitress, being the SELFISH PERSON she was, wrote Thank you and signed her name on the check along with $28.48 for this item. Now, a NORMAL person can do this SIMPLE ADDITION BY ROUNDING THE BOTH AMOUNTS TO THE NEXT PENNY in their HEAD. $21.99 to $22 and $4.99 to $5, which 22+5=27. What a STUPID AND UNCARING WAITRESS she was. She admitted to me, she didnt add that. So is that supposed to mean the CUSTOMER is supposed to? WTF is that all about? Which reminds me, you STILL NEVER ANSWERED my question: DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO VERIFY EVERY ITEM ON EACH CHECK YOU RECEIVE WHEN YOU EAT OUT? I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR ANSWER? Anyway, getting back to my overcharge story, it was an overcharge of $1.50 plus tax, which she let us kept the overcharge bill and the revised bill, which THANKFULLY DIDNT WRITE THANK YOU on that one. The total with tax was $1.63 overcharge, plus 25 cents appox. extra gratuity cause I WAS going to give 25% tip BEFORE this happened, which would be a little over $1.75 overcharge total, which she would have profited about a quarter. Anyway, her tip was 5%. The fact is she DIDNT EVEN*********TRY**********TO PREVENT THE SITUATION. See, I call that NOT a MISTAKE, because a mistake is when a person actually PUTS EFFORT into something and fails. Like for instance, I tried to climb that mountain, but couldnt get up that high. See, an ATTEMPT was made at least to TRY, but this UNCARING WAITRESS decided it was OK NOT to BOTHER checking a MACHINE over HUMAN MINDS. She made US DO IT. WE ARENT SUPPOSED TO HAVE TO DO THAT SH#@! So when you say Prevent mistakes, it has to be a TRUE EFFORT to be a MISTAKE, which in YOUR CASE, YOU DONT BOTHER TO TAKE ANY EFFORT. At least if the waitress would have said Oh I overlooked that, but I DID try to add it up then I would have given her***SOME***CREDIT for that, NOT MUCH, but a least she would have acted like she***********CARED*****************about her customers money instead of just her SELFISH SELF! A mistake is when you have tried and failed at something, NOT when you have NEVER even ATTEMPTED to get things done correctly. For instance, I am human, just as anyone. I had WRITTEN ON MY GROCERY STORE LIST, CHEESE, but didnt go through my list thoroughly enough and bypassed it one day at the store. At least I TRIED to go over the list BEFORE I left and missed it. If I would have not even have attempted to go over the list at all BEFORE I left, then how is that a mistake? That is more like just pure laziness. Theres a HUGE, HUGE, DIFFERENCE between a server that at least TRYS and a server that admits they didnt bother to. She admitted I dont add the items TO MY FACE! HOW COULD SHE, YOU KNOW? SHE WANTS THE TIP, BUT DOESNT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT MY MONEY. LIKE HELL I AM GOING TO GIVE HER THE 25% I WAS GOING TO GIVE HER. F PEOPLE WHO DONT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS MONEY OR TIME OR IF THEIR FOOD IS CORRECT! If you dont care, WHY THE HELL SHOULD I BOTHER TO? I would have given her 7% if she would have admitted to at least TRYING by admitting she tried to add it up. She also NEVER profusely apologized as I would have. I would have told the customer I was SO SORRY ABOUT THAT. I would have apologized BEFORE AND AFTER the check would have been fixed as well as asked the manager to take off a coke off the bill. I would NOT have made an excuse or tried to defend myself by saying as she told me I didnt do this on purpose. I feel when you dont bother to take an EFFORT to double check things, THAT, IN OF ITSELF, IS DONE ON PURPOSE BY BEING UNCARING AND LAZY NOT TO ATTEMPT TO*******TRY*********at the VERY LEAST. She got less for not even trying. She was STUPID to admit that she didnt bother to TRY at least. HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE IF YOU WANT A TIP AT ALL EVEN after overcharging someone over $1 without giving the customer money to make-up for the mistake?

I&apos;m starting to believe, once again, that servers simply don&apos;t care about you because of how you act and treat them. If they have free time, they&apos;ll add some items to your check 1)just to f around with you

Well you know what, pretty much EVERYTIME a MANAGER was TOLD ABOUT THE OVERCHARGE AND EVEN CORPORATE OFFICES WERE NOTIFIED, SO YES, by for instance, Outback given me an almost free $50 meal, YES, I do think it was NOT just ME that was affected by this, that it was the SERVER that overcharged me as well that got an earful from their manager. When the company has to shell out money for these servers mistakes, thats NOT a GOOD THING for the restaurant. The SERVER gets the brunt of the situation as well FROM THEIR MANAGER. So maybe they f around with me, but I FING got them back. Just as some servers say Dont f with people that handle your food, well dont f with customers that double check their checks. You overcharged me, you WILL get your manager to come down on you, because I WILL COMPLAIN, maybe to BOTH CORPORATE AND THE GENERAL MANAGER.

2)so they can get some&quot;dead&quot;food in the kitchen to snack on.&quot;Gosh, I have this wicked bitch at one of my tables, lets see if she and that poor sap she&apos;s with notice an extra salad or two.&quot;

Dont you realize by doing that, they are just HURTING THEIR OWN INCOME? Instead of the 25% I was GOING to leave the waitress in the situation in the first paragraph, we gave 5%. So if they do it on purpose, they may have had to PAY to serve me, so they GOT WHAT THE F ING deserved. What goes around, comes around. NO ONE TAKES MY MONEY AWAY AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!

Just because a lot of people don&apos;t want to tip on take-out doesn&apos;t change the reality that in many cases in full-service restaurants, you should.

WHY, NOT ALL full-service restaurants pay their servers only $2.13/hr. As I stated in my other posts, some servers at some Chilis get paid higher than minimum wage to do the to-go orders. Like customers are going to ask So do you get paid at least minimum wage? Then the to-go server could easily LIE to get a tip.

You love scouring over old posts, so go re-read them while your husband is out having affairs since you&apos;re such a pain to be around.

NO, hes not. Sometimes he will be watching a movie on direct tv that he likes(such as a science fiction movie, which I hate)or he will sleep later than me, so that leaves me with free time to type on the computer.

You raved about the girl who did it for you that one time, and you&quot;rewarded&quot;with her with 13%.

No, YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO READ! What she did was as what I DO NOT CONDONE, which was gave away stuff WITHOUT HER MANAGERS PERMISSION. NOT ONE SERVER, OUT OF ALL OF THOSE TIMES, ACTUALLY TOOK THEIR*****OWN*******MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS TO PAY FOR OVERCHARGES. There is a HUGE, HUGE, HUGE, DIFFERENCE between giving away free items from the restaurant WITHOUT THE MANGERS APPROVAL(which is STEALING FROM THE RESTAURANT)and actually taking money out of their OWN pockets to pay for the overcharge. I ALSO NEVER SAID I ACTUALLY GAVE HER 13%. I do NOT remember HOW MUCH I gave her. I had said I would give 13% to someone that took THEIR OWN MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS TO PAY FOR THE OVECHARGE. Probably was a little under 15%, may I may have given her 14%. She did NOT take it out of her own pocket, at least as far as MY KNOWLEDGE, meaning, maybe(HIGHLY DOUBTFUL)she could have paid for the items after we left. I doubt very seriously she did that. I truly think she just didnt charge me or herself for those items and made the restaurant pay for the stuff we ordered that she took off our check.
So far, I STILL HAVE NOT had a DECENT SERVER that had overcharged me to take it out of their own pocket as far as my knowledge. I think the servers that overcharged me 30 cents or 4 cents COULD HAVE. I mean, you may say oooooooh a quarter the waitress would have made from my overcharge if I would have tipped her 25% from the $1,50 subtotal overcharge, but see how many servers NEVER even took even a little as 4 cents out their OWN POCKET. So OBVIOUSLY, a quarter is a LOT to a server that they couldnt have done that, so YES, that quarter should be able to be just as important to the customer as it is to the server.

You should also know that servers, most of the time, don&apos;t have much cash or don&apos;t have adequate change with them.

They have pockets usually and usually they have aprons, so they CAN BRING THEIR OWN MONEY ON THEM IF THEY WANTED TO. THIS IS STUPID to say they cant bring their own money from their home with them to work. THATS BS!

And, if there&apos;s an overcharge on your card and they give you cash to compensate.... look, it just doesn&apos;t work that way.

Actually it DOES. Think about it this way: The overcharge I had for the almost $11 on my credit card the waiter overcharged me in 2003 at Applebees. Lets say he would have given me $13, to compensate for the extra taxes and MUCH HIGHER tip. It may not have been fixed on my credit card, but if he gave me cash back instead, the card amount doesnt matter anymore. I would have received my money back, so the end of story. By him charging us on the wrong table would mean he may have had to his manager AFTER we had left to make sure the correct table was rung up that was charged the table that we were charged on and the manager would have had to take some of that money to pay for our check amount. This would have happened AFTER WE WOULD HAVE**LEFT**ALREADY! My point is, the CUSTOMERS SHOULDNT HAVE TO BE BOTHERED WITH THIS TYPE OF CRAP! I honestly think that situation was done purposefully to get a friends table check to pay for our lower check amount, while he would have also made the extra money on the bigger check.

You constantly want special treatment and customized rules for just you, but you need to be treated just like everyone else who has an overcharge or a mistake.

NO, I want the SAME TREATMENT ONE HUMAN BEING SHOULD CARE ABOUT ANOTHER AS IF IT WERE***THEM****IN THAT SITUATION. The problem is a lot of these servers dont treat their customers as if it were happening to them.

Your server can&apos;t and shouldn&apos;t just whip out cash to make it all okay.

Your customer cant and SHOULDNT just whip out a decent tip to act like everything was OKAY. Caring is a 2-way street. You server CAN just whip out their OWN cash and NOT INVOLVE THE MANAGER UNTIL AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAS LEFT. You seem to think that it takes a whole lot of effort to whip out 30 cents or even $1.75, which it DOESNT. The server should tell their manager, but NOT at the expense of their CUSTOMERS TIME unless the customer wanted the manager to know. I feel if the servers would have given me $0,50 for overcharges for the 2 times I got overcharged 30 cents subtotal amounts, they would have saved us TIME. I had to wait 10 mins. literally or more to get the(2)30 cents overcharges fixed all because they decided not to give it to me out of their own pockets. They went to get the managers to fix these situations.

I can understand a server not pulling $11 out of their own pocket, because that is a LOT, but 50 cents, I think thats pretty darn mean and selfish they cant take 50 cents or if they didnt have coins, they could have given me a dollar bill. Its not like they wouldnt have made that back in the tip I would have given them if they would have treated me like MY TIME and MY FEELINGS would have been worth something to them. My point is, that with a situation like 50 cents, a buck or 2, I WOULD have taken that out of MY OWN POCKET as a server if I would have overcharged someone if I was a server. I would CARE about peoples money and time, NOT about just MYSELF. So you are SOOOOOO WRONG, that they CAN(for the MOST PART)as you said WHIP OUT CASH TO MAKE IT ALL OKAY, because for the most part, its mostly forgiven, but it cant TOTALLY be forgiven UNLESS they gave me MUCH MORE than the overcharge amount, just because the customer shouldnt have to point this stuff out. The ONLY way I would completely forgive someone for that type of thing would be if they would give me way more than they overcharged me such as if the overcharge was 30 cents, but they gave me 2 bucks to cover it. Then they would have COMPLETELY MADE-UP for their mess up. I wouldnt bother to even look at that as an error, because they would be giving me a $1.50 at least in profit. So you see, by SHOWING THAT YOU WOULD CARE by giving more than the overcharge, you would(at least from a decent human being such as myself)receive a GREAT tip for an overcharge, because you would have seemed to CARE. The waitress for instance at Fox and Hound NEVER apologized for not noticing the 30 cents overcharge, much less took ANY money out of HER OWN pocket. All she said was shed have to get the manager when I asked her why the sandwich was charged $7.29 that my husband got, but on the menu stated it was $6.99. My husband didnt alter the sandwich in any way when he ordered it, so it wasnt like he added anything to make it cost more. The manager gave us half off the sandwich and thanked me for telling her about it. My point is though, it took a good 10 minutes(I know, because I looked at my watch)to get this situation fixed, which HONESTLY, I know you may not believe me, but I would have MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, RATHERED***NOT****have had half of the sandwich and left 10 minutes faster by my server just giving me 50 cents instead. Honestly, the HASSLE IS IRRITATING AND IT PISSED ME OFF to have to wait for the damn manager to fix the situation. WHO do you know goes out to eat to get overcharged? I dont know anyone, how about you? You may say WHY did you bother getting the 30 cents back if its such a hassle? Well for one thing, I am NOT going to pay MORE for something thats not the real price(meaning I wont let someone rip me off). Secondly, I want to also know what to tip. Since she NEVER once apologized, she got ZERO tip, NOT 8% like the Outback waitress that overcharged us on the ribs 30 cents that DID apologize. The fact is, the Fox and Hound waitress got stiffed, because she wasnt NICE and didnt CARE. I will NOT pay someone that isnt WILLING to apologize for something that THEY COULD HAVE CAUGHT BEFORE I DID.

My point being, EVERY SINGLE SERVER that overcharged us CARED MORE ABOUT******THEIR OWN MONEY*********, than US, EXCEPT for the one server from Lagers, which honestly, I dont think she actually took HER OWN money to pay for that stuff afterwards. I would bet a million bucks she never paid for the stuff that she took off our check. I think it was like a beer and a coke if I can remember correctly that she took off the bill. This was in 2004 maybe or so, so its hard to remember every single situation. Especially considering that one didnt hurt my feelings, it made me happy, because she was NICE about it. She profusely apologized, which is RARE for a server to do for ANY mess up. I usually tend to remember the things that hurt me.

As far as them not having money, thats BS, because they CAN put some money in their pocket BEFORE they have left for work that day.

So my main point is, YES, THEY CAN JUST WHIP OUT THE CASH TO MAKE IT MOSTLY BETTER IF THEY WOULD CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. IT DOES AND CAN WORK LIKE THAT. TO TELL ME YOU CANT GIVE ME THE MONEY FOR THE OVERCHARGE IS TELLING ME YOU ARENT WILLING TO. Servers*CAN*if they**WANT**to give their own money to their customers. Thats a personal decision. They can carry their own cash or coin change with them to work. Since when can&apos;t you bring your own money to work, huh? I have NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE.
You think you&apos;ve been violated, and you punish people for it. That&apos;s not being fair, it&apos;s being retaliatory.

Its BEING FAIR in that you treat me you my money doesnt mean anything, so HOW is it NOT FAIR to treat you the SAME EXACT WAY? IT IS VERY FAIR! Its NOT FAIR that they dont care about my money, but care more about their own money.

It&apos;s not so much that I prevented the problem, it&apos;s that I took care of it without the guest even knowing what happened.

Actually, you DID PREVENT the problem from getting to the CUSTOMER, which is truly preventing the actually PROBLEM. Sure you would have to deal with your manager with it, but it would have been caught beforehand.

I&apos;m starting to believe, once again, that servers simply don&apos;t care about you because of how you act and treat them.

NO, because I treat them with RESPECT by telling them Thank you when they bring me things. I am NOT a mean person.

&quot;Gosh, I have this wicked bitch at one of my tables, lets see if she and that poor sap she&apos;s with notice an extra salad or two.&quot;

I honestly do NOT feel that MOST of the times that the server put extra items purposely on the check with intent to get a higher tip. I do feel, however, one of the waiters in 2006 put an extra drink $5.25 at Chilis on my bill due to us only getting drinks, because I guess he may have felt like his tip wouldnt have been much due to a low check amount. Honestly, our check would have been HIGHER than a couple that would only have ordered 2 soft drinks and 2 burgers by much more. Anyway, the reason why I am saying it was done intentionally to get a bigger tip was that a bunch of things happened. One, he made me wait for my soft drink for 15 mins, while the couple that he greeted after us, he brought their soft drinks BEFORE mine. He also told me after I went get the manager about the overcharge I didnt know what you ordered. Thats RIDICULOUS. Like I am going to believe that crap when HE was our waiter and there wasnt ANYONE ELSE that was serving us. Also the fact that one time in 2005, a waiter asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar when I told him we were just getting drinks, meaning, he was worried about a low tip. No, that waiter didnt overcharge us, but he did make my husband wait for his water AFTER my margarita came out. My point is, some servers will be out for their own pockets in that the waiter that had overcharged us was trying to get a higher tip through a higher percentage check and possibly get the $5.25 voided after we would have paid, which would have been pure profit for him as well. My point is, some servers arent doing it because they think I wouldnt be nice, they are doing so they can have a decent tip due to the fact that we werent ordering any food, so the waiter thought even if we tipped him 20%, he wouldnt have made much with tipping his coworkers out like another table that would run a $40-$60 check amount. My point of talking about the waiter in 2005 was to explain that the waiter didnt care want us in his section cause he wasnt going to make much money off of a check with just drinks, which maybe thats what he thought or maybe he thought we were just going to get cokes. That waiter in the 2005 incident that asked us if we wanted to go sit at the bar was rude to ask such a thing. At that time, Louisiana didnt have any smoking law for restaurants, just smoking and non-smoking sections. This year in Louisiana, they past a law that no smoking in would be allowed in restaurants. Anyway, I told the waiter because we didnt want to breathe smoke. I feel, what an ahole waiter to tell us where to sit. See how he decided to give us crappy service though, because he felt he wasnt going to make much off our table. To bring a glass of water AFTER a margarita is BAD SERVICE. He got stiffed on a $7 and something cent check. See how he didnt CARE about his customers LUNGS. I have NEVER had a server ask us if we wanted to sit at the bar when we just ordered drinks when we have told them we were only getting drinks. I do NOT feel a server should EVER tell a customer Do you want to sit somewhere else? OBVIOUSLY if we would have wanted to sit at the bar, we WOULD HAVE. That waiter had some nerve to tell us that. What a mean and self-centered waiter.

My main point is, most servers only care about THEMSELVES AND THEIR TIP MONEY, NOT ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS MONEY OR THEIR CUSTOMERS.

Lords, do you ever go out to eat and just enjoy yourself?

For the 3rd time in my lifetime, we tipped 30% to a waitress last week. It was because everything went perfectly and she was EXTREMLEY CARING. For instance, I asked her to bring the condiments before the appetizer comes out as well as the condiments I ordered with my entre if she could bring them out before my entre came out. Her response was Im not busy. Now, the average server, even if we were the only customers, wouldnt have said such a NICE thing. I told her I know I am being a pain, but she still said she wasnt that busy. So she did just as I asked. When my condiments came before the entres came out, there was some bbq sauce that I had asked for. She****OFFERED*****to warm it up for me and even***OFFERED***to TELL ME it was cold. She said Would you like me to warm up the bbq sauce, because its cold? Of course I told her yes. HOW MANY SERVERS WOULD****OFFER***TO DO MORE WORK FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS? I would say shes a needle in a hay stack. Its a RARITY to see such a CARING SERVER these days. I had servers before they were too lazy to write my condiments down, much less OFFER to do something extra for me. MOST servers, even if they werent busy, would NOT have voluntarily TOLD me that the bbq sauce was cold even. They would have waited for me to bring it up, if I even would have. It was the MOST WONDERFUL SERVICE I have EVER HAD IN MY LIFETIME. Most servers would try to do the LEAST for their customers and still expect to get at least 20%. My point is, she was VERY attentive, VERY CARING, and she even brought the check BEFORE the dessert came out due to the fact I had asked for 3 things all at once which was the dessert, the white russian, and the check. Usually, servers tend to make you wait to get the check until the dessert arrives or after the dessert. She got it BEFORE the dessert. I was so pleased, because I am a person that doesnt like to have to wait to leave when I am ready to go. It was neat, when we were eating our dessert; the check was already paid and done with. She even thanked us. I WISH EVERY SERVER WAS SO NICE AND CARING LIKE THAT, but MOST are LAZY AND DONT CARE. I wish EVERY SERVER would VOLUNTEER to do things to make their customers experience better. The bbq sauce thing was VERY caring of her to offer that. HOW many servers do you know that would OFFER to make extra trips to your table? There arent many out there. Its sad that there arent.

This was a restaurant out of town, so we wont go there all the time, but it was a nice day last Saturday. I was soooo pleased with her service. When we go there again, I will see if shes working to ask if we could have her again.

See, I DO go out to enjoy myself, but sometimes, things go wrong or when something does go wrong, it makes me even more pissed that the server doesnt give a care. Like for instance just simply apologizing shows SOME WAY that they MIGHT just give a little care. Like if something goes wrong, but the person is really nice about it, its not so bad. Like the time I wrote about on here when we went to a restaurant that the waitress told me Im so sorry about that for a missing side of ranch and she got it immediately. Usually, when my condiments arent there, I am literally sitting for 2 minutes sometimes with NO SORRY, much less of a profuse apology over a small mistake. I dont feel it was necessary to say so sorry over that, but a sorry is nice to hear. My point is, if servers would be nice and seem to care, then the mistake or mistakes wouldnt seem NEARLY as irritating to me. I had still tipped that waitress 20% that time and she even didnt see when she brought out my open-faced burger, which my onions werent on my burger. We solved that problem, because my husband didnt care if he had onions or not. See, hes not too picky, which I am TOTALLY opposite. So for her 2 mistakes, since she was EXTREMELY CARING about the situation and VERY NICE, those mistakes were like they didnt occur or matter. I just wish servers would be nice and act like when they go out to eat how they feel when they have mistakes with their dining experience. It seems like a lot of servers just think about their money and not about peoples feelings at all.

You seem to think that going out to eat once or twice a week since 2001 makes you some sort of expert in service. I&apos;m sorry but it doesn&apos;t.

I am MORE of an EXPERT, than the average server that eats out maybe once or twice a month. I also am educated in all these mistakes I get and I KNOW HOW TO PREVENT THEM.

Do you ever just enjoy yourself?

I do sometimes and sometimes I enjoy the food or drinks MORE than the service.

I now eat out more than seven times per week and rarely get an overcharge or bad service.

Do you check EVERY ITEM to make sure every cent is correct? I am willing to bet you just look to make sure no extra items or the correct items were charged, dont you? I actually bring a to-go menu in my pocket or sometimes I bring a piece of paper and a pen in my pocket to write down the prices. Sometimes I may get the menu, it all depends. If you dont check every cent, then you cant say you RARELY, when you wouldnt KNOW FOR SURE if you didnt TRY.

So by you saying RARLEY, I am assuming you have received an overcharge?

I think it&apos;s the places you frequent and your very obvious attitude that makes the servers hate you.

The PLACE is NOT what makes a server CARE about their customers money. It depends on the individual person. Mistakes can happen ANYWHERE you go, but yes, I will admit, more than likely at an Applebees or Chilis, than for it to happen at 5 star restaurant.

If the server hates me enough to overcharge me purposely, then you know what? They also hurt their own income as well. You probably will say its all worth it. Well, thats their problem. If they want to lose money to overcharge me, well they will suffer the consequences too, not just me. Their manager wont be too happy with them either and especially if there was something free given for that overcharge.

vitalryan
For example, I&apos;d be fired if I took 3-5 minutes or whatever to greet,

Maybe where you work, but the waiter I mentioned above that overcharge me $5.25 for a drink we never ordered also made us wait 6 whole minutes to greet us. HE STILL WORKS THERE TO THIS DAY! HE NEVER GOT FIRED FOR THE OVERCHARGE OR MAKING US WAIT TO BE GREETED 6 MINUTES.

I&apos;d also be fired if I didn&apos;t automatically bring refill drinks as soon as your beverage hit half full.

Maybe where you work, but at Chilis and Applebees, I have MOST servers that DO NOT just bring a refill. They ASK or LET US ASK THEM for one. They STILL WORK THERE. NO ONE GOT FIRED FOR NOT BRINGING ME A REFILL WITHOUT ME ORDERING ONE.

And lastly, most people DO tip for takeout, when I did ToGo&apos;s, I&apos;d say 1 in 10 didn&apos;t tip, thats a high percentage compared to table service, but 10% is a far cry from&quot;most&quot;. So again, this only reinforces that you actually do NOT have any idea what you are talking about.

I DO KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. Maybe at THAT PARTICULAR RESTAURANT they did, but MOST PEOPLE DONT. They may tip for a to-go order for car-side-to-go which is maybe WHAT tips you are talking about were made, but NOT to go pick the food up inside as much. You cant say people will tip as much for counter service. I still say WHY in the world would at some Chilis they pay their employees more than minimum wage to do to-go orders? They could have easily paid them $5.15/hr. Obviously they KNOW MOST PEOPLE DO NOT TIP FOR TAKE-OUT, that is WHY they pay them MORE than minimum wage. If these Chilis restaurants felt that their workers would make 10% from each customer, theyd pay them only $5/hr or something low like that instead of $7/hr. Obviously, they KNOW MOST PEOPLE DON&apos;T TIP A PENNY FOR TAKE-OUT ORDERS. THAT IS WHY, plain and simple!

 &quot;You server CAN just whip out their OWN cash and NOT INVOLVE THE MANAGER UNTIL AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAS LEFT. You seem to think that it takes a whole lot of effort to whip out 30 cents or even $1.75&quot; 

No. Computer systems and financial paperwork don&apos;t work that way. It just doesn&apos;t, whether it&apos;s 13 cents or 20 dollars. A server cannot compensate you for an overcharge on a card with cash, and still have a balanced cash-out. You know why you don&apos;t understand this?? Because you&apos;ve never experienced it from our side. That is why everything you say doesn&apos;t have any basis in reality.

I can&apos;t even respond to the rest of your garbage because it&apos;s just so ludicrous.

WTF IS THAT THE***CUSTOMER&apos;S PROBLEM******? It&apos;s NOT THE CUSTOMER&apos;S PROBLEM. WHO CARES IF THE SERVER CANNOT BALANCE THEIR CASH OUT? WTF DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GIVE A SH#@ ABOUT THAT? WHY MAKE IT OUR PROBLEM IF YOU COULDN&apos;T BALANCE YOUR REGISTER BY MAKING US WAIT LONGER TO LEAVE?

If the server wants to give me 30 cents and not even mention it to their manager, that&apos;s THEIR DECISON NOT TO, which would be leaving the item to still ring up 30 cents more than the price on the menu. The server CAN HOWEVER tell their manager about the discrepancy.

Think about it. You give me 50 cents for my $17.29 ribs that you charged me that was supposed to be $16.99 due to extra taxes and gratuity out of YOUR OWN POCKET. HOW THE F@#$ does that have to do with the cash being balanced in your register if I pay with my credit card for the full amount on my bill? ALL you would have done is dealt with YOUR OWN PERSONAL MONEY, NOT THE REGISTER&apos;S MONEY. I am NOT saying take 50 cents off the bill amount or take 50 cents out of the restaurant&apos;s money either. I am saying, GIVE ME 2 quarters OF YOUR OWN for the overcharge and deal with telling the manager AFTER I have LEFT. I will pay you the amount you have charged me on my check. Let&apos;s say the bill with the overcharge was $31.88. I pay $31.88 plus tip. If you used YOUR OWN 2 quarters, THEN HOW COULD THE REGISTER NOT BE BALANCED? The money from the register was NEVER TOUCHED, NOR WAS MY BILL LOWERED IN ANY WAY. NO MATTER WHAT METHOD OF PAYMENT I USED, IF YOU GAVE ME CASH OR COIN CHANGE FOR MY OVERCHARGE OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET, HOW THE HELL CAN YOU SAY THE REGISTER IS AFFECTED IF PAY THE FULL AMOUNT WITH MY CREDIT CARD OR CASH? Like when I was overcharged the almost $11 on my credit card at Applebee&apos;s. If the waiter would have given me $13 out of HIS OWN MONEY, my credit card amount would not have been changed. My check amount was $47 and something cents, which it was supposed to be about $36 and something cents. The credit card amount would have still been $47 and something cents. HOW DOES THAT SHORT YOUR REGISTER OR MESS ANYTHING UP ANY IF THE SERVER GIVES THEIR OWN MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO PAY FOR THE OVERCHARGE?

If it was the wrong table the server rung up, LIKE HELL IS THAT THE CUSTOMER&apos;S PROBLEM IF YOU CAN&apos;T BALANCE YOUR REGISTER? WHY DO YOU ACT LIKE IT IS? That situation is between you, the manager, and the other table you rung up my credit card on. Is that supposed to be OUR PROBLEM? It&apos;s NOT!

&quot;Based on what I know, you&apos;re completely off the map here. I don&apos;t know one server or to-go specialist in any restaurant, especially chains!, who gets paid more than min. wage. Where the hell did you hear that?&quot;

I currently work for Chilis, and this is how it goes:

Hostess: starts at 7.50 an hour
Busser: 2.80 an hour+2.5% of the restraunts total sales during their shift, split between any bussers clocked in.(the later comes directly out of the servers tips)
Server: 2.15 an hour+tips.
Cook: Starts at 8.50 an hour.
Bartender: Hourly wage and gets a portion of their sales.
Expo: Hourly wage and gets tipped out by servers.

TOGO: 7.00 per hour+their own tips(not tipped out by servers)

$7/hr is MORE than MINIMUM wage in this state. According to the internet, $6.15/hr is the current minimum wage here. I seriously doubt minimum wage is that high in any state. If it is, I am surprised.

No where in that post or anywhere on that page does the poster identify what state they are in, they also don&apos;t identify what min. wage is in their state. So, once again you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. I don&apos;t have time to look over 10 pages of posts, so since you do perhaps you can find evidence of what state this person is in.

They only reference the server&apos;s wages, which is $2.15. As of July 24, 2007, there is no state that pays $2.15 an hour as a tipped employee wage. Maryland and North Carolina are the only two states where $6.15 is the min wage(which is a random number you just pulled out of your ass, I&apos;m sure, since you have no mention of a state in the poster&apos;s message)and neither of them pay as little as $2.15/hour as tipped employee wages.


 &quot;I seriously doubt minimum wage is that high in any state. If it is, I am surprised.&quot; 

California&apos;s min. wage is $7.50 an hour. Min. wage is $7 or above in Alaska, Connecticut, DC, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. Surprised?

At different points in the next two years, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will all have min. wages $7 or above.

Do your research, bitch.

And stop speculating and jumping to conclusions.

&quot;You know why you don&apos;t understand this?? Because you&apos;ve never experienced it from our side. That is why everything you say doesn&apos;t have any basis in reality.&quot;

I HAVE, it was called z-ing out the register at the end of my shift at the donut shop when I worked there for over 2yrs. I had started with a $100 draw at the beginning of my shift. I had to put down the credit card sales, the cash sales, checks, and when we had it, video poker tickets. If my register was short I believe it was over $2, they took out the shortage from my check. I also had voids to substract such as mistakes or cancelled orders. So YOU DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT! If I would have overcharged someone by let&apos;s say 20 cents, if I were to have given them 40 cents out of my pocket, my register wouldn&apos;t have been affected by this.

Just as I said above, if you give me YOUR OWN MONEY OUT OF&quot;YOUR&quot;POCKET, THAT DOESN&apos;T AFFECT THE REGISTER IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM YOU DUMBASS! You can&apos;t understand that, can you?

If I am overcharged with tax and tip in the amount of 50 cents and you give me 2 quarters out of YOUR pocket, I still will pay the overcharged bill with the 50 cents more on it. So WHERE DOES THE PROBLEM LIE?

Even if I get my credit card rung up on a wrong table or a wrong amount, if my server chooses to give their own money to compensate for it, then I have nothing to do with the messed up situation any further. If it&apos;s just the wrong amount, it doesn&apos;t have to be fixed by the manager. If it&apos;s table 6 that got rung up on table 7, then the server and the manager deals with fixing that together, NOT that other customer that got overcharged. That other customer got their money back from their server&apos;s money.

&quot;Maryland and North Carolina are the only two states where $6.15 is the min wage(which is a random number you just pulled out of your ass,&quot;

NO, here it is:
 http://www.homelandstupidity.us/2006/06/02/louisiana-senate-flunks-economics/ 

&quot;In a further example of Louisiana legislators incompetence, the state senate passed a bill(PDF)raising the Louisiana minimum wage to $6.15&quot;

&quot;California&apos;s min. wage is $7.50 an hour. Min. wage is $7 or above in Alaska, Connecticut, DC, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. Surprised?&quot;

Actually, YES, I AM.

 This whole&quot;out of their own pocket&quot;thing is something you&apos;re never going to understand. And even if you could understand it, no normal person would take money out of their own pocket so that the restaurant can essentially benefit from things that might have never been made or sold, and so you can leave earlier. Since you&apos;re such a pain in the ass, no one wants to do you any favors.

And you do realize that your Louisiana pay info is from a random editorial site, right? According to the DOL, your state has no minimum wage. http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.htm . Based on what I know, that means they automatically adopt the national minimum wage, which is $5.15 I think. The article you&apos;re quoting from is also from June of&apos;06. The DOL website is dated July of this year.

Stop getting nonsense information from sites with no credibility. Oh, and drop dead.

Actually, Nevada and Oregon have no tipped employee exemptions. I know this for a fact as I have been a server in both states, and I&apos;m currently serving in Nevada...where I make $6.50/hr.

Other states that do not allow tipped employee exemptions:

Alaska
California
Minnesota
Montana
Washington

&quot;no normal person would take money out of their own pocket so that the restaurant can essentially benefit from things that might have never been made or sold, and so you can leave earlier&quot;

NO, a&quot;NORMAL&quot;person would NOT give a DECENT tip for their server being too lazy to not make sure they didn&apos;t overcharge them. WHY would a&quot;NORMAL&quot;customer CARE about their server&apos;s tip if their server DOESN&apos;T care about their money?

Do you know why you say&quot;Normal&quot;servers don&apos;t give their own money out? It&apos;s all has to do with SELFISHNESS. They are out for THEMSELVES. So customers should get to be the same way when it comes to tipping when an overcharge happens. Just as the waitress didn&apos;t give me $1.75, nor gave a profuse apology, and she had time to write&quot;thank you&quot;with her name on the check SHOWS AND PROVES HOW SELFISH SHE WAS. SHE ONLY, ONLY, ONLY, CARED ABOUT***HER***MONEY, NOT ABOUT OURS. When you have time to write&quot;Thank you&quot;and sign your name on the check, you DO HAVE TIME to make sure the customer is charged correctly.

As far as the leaving early part, that&apos;s the SERVER causing the customer to be able to leave sooner(by giving their own money)or later(by getting the manager), NOT the manager of the restaurant. You would be giving your OWN money to the customer to benefit the CUSTOMER, NOT THE MANAGER of the restaurant.

The restaurant WON&apos;T benefit from the overcharge if the server TELLS their manager RIGHT AFTER the customer has left. The manager would fix the situation and the customer would be a winner in this situation due to the fact the customer would have gotten their money back faster and also the server would be the winner in that more customers can be seated just that much faster at that table. So honestly, it&apos;s a WIN, WIN, situation if the server gives their own money for overcharges. By the server not doing that, shows just how SELFISH AND SELF-CENTERED they are. You may think by giving your own money that you would be taking a chance to not get a tip, but you know what? If you CARED, they more than likely WILL give you a BETTER TIP, therefore, you&apos;d get your money BACK. If you chance it and they don&apos;t tip you, well, then you would KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS TO BE RIPPED OFF by probably NEVER being too lazy to double check a check again.

I will ask this AGAIN, for the THIRD TIME:

DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO VERIFY EVERY ITEM ON EACH CHECK YOU RECEIVE WHEN YOU EAT OUT TO MAKE SURE YOU AREN&apos;T GETTING OVERCHARGED?

By you NOT answering this question shows me that YOU DO NOT CHECK YOUR CHECK FOR EVERY ITEM AGAINST THE MENU NOR FOR EXTRA ITEMS OR WRONG ITEMS, so****HOW IN THE HELL CAN YOU EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO IF YOU DON&apos;T?********

Customers aren&apos;t supposed to be having to grab a menu and make sure each price is correct, each item is correct, or that there are no extra items on the check. Customers aren&apos;t supposed to have to make sure their credit card amounts are charged correctly either.

I honestly do NOT think you truly make sure you aren&apos;t overcharge when you go out to eat. If you would go through each item when you go out to eat that&apos;s on your check, do you think that would be&quot;Fun&quot;OR would you call it a&quot;Hassle&quot;or an&quot;Irritation&quot;or an&quot;Inconvience?&quot;I doubt your answer would be&quot;Fun.&quot;If it is, you are full of it. NO CUSTOMER SHOULD EVER HAVE TO POINT OUT AN OVERCHARGE! The SERVER is the person making the tip. Since the SERVER is the person CHARGING the customer, making the HIGHER tip from the overcharge, and making the customer DELAYED from leaving(such as going to a movie after), the SERVER should be thinking about their TIP by thinking about the CUSTOMER&apos;S MONEY AND TIME. If you mess up someone&apos;s money and time, you SHOULD get penalized. WHY would ANYONE in their right mind pay someone well to overcharge them? Especially when the server can do just as the customer can which is grab a menu and make sure each price is correct, but yet, they FIND THE TIME TO WRITE THOSE STUPID THANK YOU NOTES OR SMILEY FACES CRAP. Imagine how much TIME wasting goes on writing those stupid notes. It&apos;s NOT the CUSTOMER&apos;S JOB TO DO MAKE SURE THEY ARE BEING CHARGED CORRECTLY! Customer should be able to TRUST their server to charge them correctly.

 lords,
answer me this question.
If I verified all the prices on the check, then dropped it off with you, would you still verify everything yourself?

 Actually, we all KNOW you would check the math anyways, so I&apos;m going to just go ahead with this little observation to prove you are an idiot.

Lets say your server takes 1 extra minute to verify prices with the menu every time you eat. And 1 in 60 has an item that is incorrect.

You have now wasted 60 minutes of your life to save what appears to be an average of $3... and this is from YOUR perspective. Lets also add in the 1 minute it would take you(even though this isn&apos;t really necessary)to re-verify it because we know you would. So now, 120 minutes, or 2 hours wasted to save $3, which I&apos;m being generous here, most of your overcharges are like 25 cents and the non-charges for soda&apos;s already negate those.

If you factor that into a job that you could actually attain, lets say, $7/hour... you could have benefitted about $11 - so now not only are you not really saving money, you are losing MORE money.

What does this tell us, besides you are an idiot. That maybe you should stop worrying about your checks since from your own admission the mistakes are minimal monetarily, and instead of wasting a couple minutes every meal, just stay a couple minutes extra at work.

And hey, this is the real world, so lets leave work out of it. Now, you have already saved more money than you have lost because of servers not ringing in soda&apos;s, etc... so you really haven&apos;t lost anything by overcharges. But, again, we&apos;ll play your game. You are virtually claiming that those lost minutes, which equals hours(remember, you like to point out how it all adds up)- shows that you only value your time at about $1.50 an hour. Truly pathetic.

So what have we learned, again. That you are an idiot. And that you really need to focus more on spending your time more wisely.

You see, Loads of Stupidity..... most people(and I&apos;m talking about everyone except you)would rather NOT wait that extra minute or two and NOT worry about the pennies, because ultimately, it&apos;s just trivial.

 Sorry Servers. I have no doubt that you can convince yourselves all day that tipping is necessary on take-out. BUT - Check out the many tipping etiquette webs sites out there, or even wikipedia, and you&apos;ll see tipping is simply not the norm for picking up take-out. Tipping at restaurants is for traditional table service. A few sites suggest a small tip may be nice if something was done above and beyond packaging the order, but that&apos;s pretty rare(By the way, making sure the order is correct is NOT above and beyond ! Gimme a break !)

If a customer does gives you a tip on take out - be thankful, because they&apos;re most likely confused about when it&apos;s appropriate to tip. You&apos;re simply in the wrong if you resent and/or give a non-tipping customer a dirty look on take-out.

Of course servers are advocating tipping for take out, and probably anything else they can think of. It&apos;s in their best interest ! Duh ! What&apos;s next - a mandatory extra 10% tip if you smile at us ?. Unfortunately it comes off looking self-serving(pun intended)&amp;disingenuous. You lack all credibility by insisting it&apos;s required or expected.

By the way - keep up the name calling&amp;insults. It really supports your case.

Now have a safe day !

Well, all I can say is that in the real world, tipping something for takeout*is*the norm and this is based on working in 4 restaurants in the past 12 years. In 3 of those restaurants, takeout was only incidental(and done by the bartender), but in those cases, it was almost 100% that takeout people gave something. In the 4th case, it was a very busy mass market restaurant with a substantial to-go business(usually over $1500 on an average night shift). I would say that the percentage of people who didn&apos;t leave*anything*was about 3 out of 20, and ironically it was usually sororities who ordered hundreds of dollars worth of food requiring 7 tote bags and about 20 minutes just to assemble and QC the order. Tips for a $1500 shift would usually bring around $100 - 150.

So the numbers just don&apos;t support your position and I&apos;m guessing that this is simply the case of tipping sites not catching up with the commercial realities. For instance, this very site gives out antiquated information about tipping on wine. If you look, it talks about not tipping on bottles of wine over $10. When was the last time you saw a bottle of $10 in a restaurant? Plus, it says that you should give 15% to the wine steward. Notwithstanding the fact that a wine steward is already usually making $50k plus a year, in 99% of restaurants, the server now also serves as the wine steward. So why not tip 15% on the same bottle of $300 Sassacia that I serve as you would give a wine steward for the exact same bottle? BTW, I&apos;m not saying don&apos;t tip your wine steward. On the contrary, when one is present, it&apos;s totally appropriate. In fact, this site doesn&apos;t even address the issue of to go. Keep in mind that the proliferation of dedicated to go business is a pretty new trend. It&apos;s really only become institutionalized in the past 4 or 5 years. Most people are smart enough to realize that tipping something, even at a lower level for the right to have dedicated to-go people processing their order for convenience is just the right thing to do. I can guarantee you that if it didn&apos;t happen, restaurants would either have to charge a to-go surcharge in order to pay those servers a proper wage, or phase it out entirely. They don&apos;t want to, of course, because it increases volume, but I think that in many cases, it cannibalizes floor sales in many restaurants. In the case of the mass market restaurant that i worked in though, it probably didn&apos;t so much because we were always busy from about 6pm until 9:30 so it really did mean more sales because once the restaurant is on a wait, you can&apos;t serve any more people than the butts you already have in seats. But I can tell you that unless they paid those to-go servers more than the 2.13 an hour that they did, something would have to give, and that would probably be increased prices for everyone(if not for to-go food).

So you have to take some things that you see on the internet with a grain of salt. You can even take my figures regarding to-go tipping with a grain of salt as well of course, but I&apos;m giving you the facts as I know them from being in the trenches for over a decade.

Basically this is an evolving situation...

 teleburst:

Thanks for a thoughtful post. So -do you think the 7 - 10% tip on take you&apos;ve indicated is the appropriate norm ? And would you apply the same percentages to both lower and mid-range restaurants(I&apos;ve never thought about take out at a high end restaurant, because I&apos;d want to dine in).

We must travel in vastly different circles. I&apos;ve lived in Los Angeles, Denver, and now live in a ski resort town where things are somewhat pricey. I&apos;ve done alot of take out, because I used to live 20 miles out of town in a rural community. I&apos;ve talked about the subject with my friends and co-workers, and the consensus was you don&apos;t have to tip unless something unusual was done(or we personally knew the server). Out of curiosity I&apos;ve been to several tipping etiquette sites, and these appear current, and I get the same consensus(unless it&apos;s written by a server).

I saw the post about wine here and had to chuckle. Thought it was old too. I&apos;ve seen some heated blogs on wine tipping. Assuming I don&apos;t use the services of a sommelier/wine steward, do you think I should tip the same on a $30 bottle as a $300 bottle ? And what would you tip ? The bottles are already marked up 100 to 300 %. And assuming all the waiter did was bring it to me and open the bottle, is a linear tip fair for a similar level of effort by the server(even assuming some additional care in serving the $300 bottle)? I&apos;m talking about the ethics, because if I can order a $300 bottle I can obviously afford the tip.

Thanks - Is it Friday Yet ?

 Regarding the to-go food:

Along the same line of what Teleburst is saying, my experience in 6 years of restaurant work is that most people tip on take-out. That is why the take-out people at my former restaurants continued to work there. My friend who did to-go at my old Applebee&apos;s made more money than we did sometimes simply because of volume. he would sell $1100 worth of food, and take home around $150 in tips. The percentages are not the same, but the tipping is there. You can discuss it with your friends all you want, and look it up online. But I agree that many people&apos;s opinions are not accurate because the boom in take-out food from full service restaurants is very new, plus many people write about these things who don&apos;t know first hand what is actually going on in the industry. The fact is, most people do tip and it is the norm.

As has been said over and over in this thread, many servers and to-go people don&apos;t expect 20% for to-go food. 10% will suffice. And you need to consider the circumstances. If you happen to order a bunch of to-go food from your server while you&apos;re sitting down and eating, that server is tipping out on that amount of money. Be considerate of that.


Regarding the wine:

I&apos;ve never worked in a place with a sommelier or a wine steward, so I can&apos;t weigh in on that.

However, here&apos;s a story: I had a table recently order a $150 bottle of wine from me. Their food was around $70. They chose to tip me $15 on a $220 check, because they didn&apos;t tip on the wine. Because everything I sell is factored into my tip-out, I paid $6.60 on that check, therefore made less than $10 in actual take-home wages. Is that fair? Mmmm, not really.

How helpful was your server in selecting your wine? Was their wine service up to par and did they take care with the wine while they served it to you? Did they advise you with food choices that would pair well?

Spielburg doesn&apos;t tip on wine. It&apos;s just what he does. But that doesn&apos;t make it right. No, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s right for a server to expect 15% on a $50 bottle of wine the same they would expect 15% on a $400 bottle. However, please adjust the tip based on the price depending on how much care the server must take with a nice bottle, and I also think it is completely within your right to question who that tip is going to. Ask why your server is paying out on that wine, and tip accordingly.

 Well, you don&apos;t know the difference between a $4 glass and an $18 glass. This conversation really only applies to people who order wine.

 You ordering a glass of your $4 wine is really no different than ordering a soda. So you&apos;re not eligible to weigh in on this topic.

 I think that 10% is a good general tip for to-go.

I don&apos;t know about your own community and special circumstances...all I&apos;m willing to do is relate my experience in a brewpub, white tablecloth American bistro $45 a head restaurant, mass market $6 mil a year restaurant with $20 a head dinner costs and my current restaurant, a $75 a head top end steakhouse. That mass market restaurant is one that you&apos;ll find a few of in those big cities that you mentioned. That&apos;s the one restaurant that has enough consistent volume of to-go food to make some informed judgments on what people are actually doing(in my current restaurant, we might do a handful of to-go orders a week, less than we&apos;d do in a hour in the mass market restaurant in 30 minutes). I think that there are enough data points(from both a volume and demographic standpoint)to be able to use that mass-market to-go business as a key indicator. After all, if I strictly used my experience in my American bistro restaurant, I&apos;d have to conclude that it was more like 15 - 20% since most people tipped the bartender fairly normally for taking time out of their bar business to accomodate them. But since there might only be 3 or 4 of these orders a week from a very limited circle of guests, it would be hard to extrapolate from that. But when you&apos;re craking out to go food for 30 - 60 people a night, night after night, you&apos;re going to get a good cross-section of the community and a more statistically reliable sample.

I think that it&apos;s just a matter of time before the internet advice on tipping for to-go catches up with the actual practice. Remember that full service tipping has had many years to get codified. This is a really new trend where people aren&apos;t just occasionally ordering takeout because something&apos;s come up, but are doing replacement meals for at home dining of normal full service fare. it&apos;s now becoming institutionalized and if tipping stops happening, something&apos;s going to give one way or another.

As to wine, yes, I think that you should tip the same(or at least close to)the same on a $300 vs a $30. Yes, the bottles are marked up(ironically, the $300 bottle is likely only marked up 1.5 - 2.5X whereas the $30 bottle might be marked up 3 - 4X), but so is liquor and beer(and usually at much higher rates - as you get roughly 18 - 20 shots per bottle of liquor, you can see that the markup is even higher than wine). Most of the time, you have the choice of ordering the $30 bottle as opposed to the $300. Now, many people say that it takes no more trouble to pour a $300 as it does a $30, but, in the same light, it takes NO LESS either. In actuality, in many restaurants you do have more service involved in the expensive bottle, with decanting, better glasses that have to be hand washed, etc. But the main thing is that you should tip on what you buy, just as you wouldn&apos;t reduce the tip on a $45 New York strip as opposed to an $8 hamburger. I understand the pressure of higher prices, but that&apos;s a choice that you get to make and frankly, if you can afford a $300 bottle of wine to enhance your meal or your prestige with your guests, you can afford to tip appropriately(as you point out). Don&apos;t forget that many servers have to tip out based on their sales, so if you stiff on the expensive bottle, you&apos;re potentially costing the server money(fortunately, in the restaurant that I work in now, I tip on the tips I actually receive, but that&apos;s a rarity in restaurants, at least from my experience).

 Ok, so now we are on wine tipping ... great.

Why do people seem to act as though tipping on a $300 bottle of wine is any different than tipping on a $30 bottle of wine, is it that cheapness, envy, I don&apos;t know.

Do you go to a Mercedes dealer and get upset that the salesman makes more selling a car the same way the Hyundai guy does, but makes 3 times the commission because the car costs 3 times as much?

15% is the standard tip, you bought it, thats the servers&quot;commission&quot;for the purchase, thats how it works. It just shows the mentality of certain people when they just try and find ways to reduce the tip, and not ways to increase it.

 Vitalryan writes:&quot;Do you go to a Mercedes dealer and get upset that the salesman makes more selling a car the same way the Hyundai guy does, but makes 3 times the commission because the car costs 3 times as much?&quot;

I would if I had to tip him on the value of the Mercedes. So now a tip is not a gratuity given at the discretion of the customer, it&apos;s a&quot;commission&quot;. Sorry, you can try to modify the tipping tradition to better suit yourself, but I still reserve the right to&quot;reduce the tip&quot;for mediocre or bad service. That being said, know that I rarely get poor service at the places I frequent, and typically tip 20% on the entire bill, including tax(&amp;wine). I&apos;m not looking for an excuse to ruin my(and the servers)evening trying save a few bucks on the tip.

As for wine: I realize it stinks when a lot of your compensation is based in somebody&apos;s
whims about how much they want to pay(especially if you&apos;ve done your job right), but publicly calling customers a&quot;cheapass&quot;if they don&apos;t pay 15 or 20 % on wine in a forum like this comes with a risk of backlash.

I think it is appropriate to reflect on what is reasonable rather than spouting the all too common insults(e.g. telling us we can&apos;t afford the tip so stay home, order white zin instead, namecalling, etc. etc.)I want to have a sense of fairness and ask for the same in return. The restaurant industry insisting on uncapped linear tips on expensive wine is a self-serving [pun intended] perspective, not a fair one. I do pay a full tip, but still wonder about the ethics.

That&apos;s the way it&apos;s supposed to work. But that&apos;s the only difference between a tip and a commission other than the fact that it&apos;s voluntary. In every other definition of the word, it&apos;s a commission because it&apos;s a percentage payment based on the cost of the goods purchased. Our employers consider us salespeople(whether you or I like it or not). And we don&apos;t tip on individual items and give them sliding scales(tipping 15% on a hamburger, but 10% on an expensive steak). We tip on the full retail value of what we have bought(which means that we should add back in coupons and free food to really be fair).

And I have to wonder about the ethics of NOT tipping on an expensive bottle of wine? Why should wine be excluded, especially considering the fact that it&apos;s such an integral part of the dining experience and the fact that there is a choice not to purchase such an expensive bottle of wine?

I know how it&apos;s supposed to work. I was addressing vitaryan&apos;s tone of saying&quot;15% is the standard tip, you bought it, thats the servers&quot;commission&quot;for the purchase, thats how it works&quot;. I hate it when servers state a flat tip % and never mention anything about the level of service.

And where did I ever say NO tip on wine, or that it be excluded ? Did you misread my post ? I do wonder if it&apos;s fair for a waiter(not talking a sommelier)to get a windfall tip on an expensive wine for a relatively small effort. Sorry if my bringing that up is stepping on your toes. I know it&apos;s my choice to make what I see as perceive as quality/value decision when I order, taking the tip into consideration.

Now have a great day !

Maybe it&apos;s unfair to expect you to know this, but sometimes, we take it as a given that tips are based on service. We pound that theme so many times that we don&apos;t always think to have to mention it(and he has mentioned it on many occasions himself).

&quot;And where did I ever say NO tip on wine, or that it be excluded? Did you misread my post&quot;?

No I didn&apos;t. I was responding with the reverse of your last sentence where you wondered about the ethics of having to tip fully on a bottle of wine. You specifically said that you did, but I wasn&apos;t responding to that part of it, just about your query about the ethics.

&quot;I do wonder if it&apos;s fair for a waiter(not talking a sommelier)to get a windfall tip on an expensive wine for a relatively small effort&quot;.

But it&apos;s NOT a windfall tip. It might be a windfall that we get lucky to have a high roller at one of our tables, but when you work in a restaurant that sells $300 bottles of wine; that&apos;s part of the perks of having the time in service to be able to serve that rarified market, just as it&apos;s a perk of being wealthy enough to dine in a restaurant that has that sort of wine list and be able to actually afford not to blink an eye and order a $300 bottle of wine. You are paying for the privilege of me waiting on you instead of someone who has been in the business for 6 months and doesn&apos;t even know that pinot noir is the grape of Burgundy. While you might not need wine guidance, it&apos;s there for you in case you*do*need it. Waiters in high end restaurants perform the duties of the missing sommelier, which are in fewer and fewer restaurants each year. We don&apos;t have the specific total knowledge that they have, but we don&apos;t get to taste every wine as they do either, so we rely on as much broad knowledge as we can stand and we have to be prepared to display it.

&quot;Sorry if my bringing that up is stepping on your toes. I know it&apos;s my choice to make what I see as perceive as quality/value decision when I order, taking the tip into consideration&quot;.

Sure it is. And you have claimed that you tip fully on wine and I support that. I wish that I could afford a $300 bottle of wine with dinner in the first place...hell, I can&apos;t afford a $300 dinner.

Just a side note, I had a table of 4 tonight that spent $525 on dinner, including a bottle of $170 Rubicon, 3 glasses of $18 chardonnay and 2 glasses of Coppola Merlot at $14. The guy simply wrote in 20% on the tip line. Didn&apos;t even bother to figure it up. made me work for it&lt;chuckle&gt;. PS, he made an effort to tell me that everything was perfect. And guess what? His was an easy table even though they wanted halfs of some of the sides.&quot;No problem, ma&apos;am&quot;. They were relaxed, in no real hurry, but matter-of-fact about what they wanted. Didn&apos;t need a big song and dance, were ready to roll. But before you think I hit the jackpot or something, they were one of only three tables tonight. I walked with about $160 for a double, which included about $20 for lunch. So, for coming in at 10am and staying until about 1:45, leaving for home until about 4:15 and staying until 9pm, it wasn&apos;t bad but it certainly wasn&apos;t great. And if that guy hadn&apos;t tipped on his wine, I would have really been screwed for the day. That&apos;s the way it goes in an expensive restaurant. And that&apos;s why it&apos;s more important for you to do the&quot;right thing&quot;by your server, especially when you order a big wine. Is this self-serving? Yeah, probably. But you want me to stay in the business. You really do.

 So you admitted you wouldn&apos;t pay commission on the mercedes accordingly.

Tips are voluntary, but as teleburst points out, thats really the only difference between that and a standard commission. We assume the service was deserving obviously in these cases.

So really, my analagy stands, people complain about a server getting a nice tip on an expensive bottle of wine, yet don&apos;t blink an eye when a realtor gets a homerun on a million dollar house instead of the $60,000 condo... same paperwork, probably similar amounts of work, WAY more money. Thats how sales is, why would these be any different?

It&apos;s somewhat self serving, but thats not the real argument. What are the ethics? The tipping standard is 15-20% of the bill for good service. So isn&apos;t it unethical to now try and weasel out of certain things&quot;oh, bringing a $300.00 bottle of wine was no different than the $20.00 bottle, I&apos;m tipping on a $20.00 bottle then&quot;- is this no different than saying the waiter at Smith and Wollensky&apos;s is undeserving becuase the $50 steak is just as easy to deliver as the $6.99 IHOP special?

Do you not see the flawed logic in this? You tip on the expensive wine because THATS how the system works, just like you tip on expensive food, etc... Trying to undermine that with excuses IS, almost by it&apos;s very definition, being a cheapass... so why are you so offended?

 Scarletfever,

Did you really ask at McDOnald&apos;s the ingredients in an item? Okay, here are the ingredients in all McD&apos;s slop: Trans fat, beef fat, chicken feet and asses, salt sugar and artifical flavor. Read Fast Food Nation and steer clear from fast food.....



I asked what is in the Asian chicken salad. There was no picture or description anywhere. I didn&apos;t ask for a detailed ingredient listing. I just wanted to know basically what is in that salad. And, really, I despise nuts so I wanted to know if there were nuts.. when I asked that, the cashier did not know that either nor did she bother to ask anyone else, she just shrugged her shoulders and said she didn&apos;t know and stood there.

 Yes servers expect tips on to go orders. Not only as another poster mentioned do servers have to bag, and make sure the order is right, but to go orders take time away from being able to wait on seated customers. Why don&apos;t people want to pay for the work others do for them?!?

Very good question. Something you might want to ask your manager. But if you live in Cali you would not have this problem. Tip is on the service and not simple mundane tasks. Why not get tipped on refilling the salt&amp;pepper? Cause it is part of the job. I laugh at the tip section of the togo order slips while marking down a nice fat 0.

Think of your work bagging up the food as an investment in a future tip. When the food comes out perfect the customer will notice and remember you the next time they dine in. Who knows they might even ask to sit in your section to thank you with a nice tip.

Next question.

 ghowen99 the good news is that most people aren&apos;t like you, and where I work 99% of the customers do tip for to go orders. Some more than the sit down customers. Those that tip for sure get more extra goodies in their bag than those that don&apos;t.

Yes it is part of the job. When me, you or anyone else is tipping, what you are tipping for is for all areas of work that has been performed by the server: From taking the order down to filling the salt shakers.

I have only had a job that gets tips for 2 years. I am 50 years old and my entire life, I make it very simple. I tip at least $5 for each person in my party that is eating. If we are just having a sandwhich and a drink, then $3 per person. If we are just having coffe, then $2 per person. If I have children with me, and they make a huge mess, I will add another $10.

One way to look at going to restaurant would be to look at it the same way as having a car repaired. When you have a car repaired you pay for parts and labor. When you go to a restaurant you pay the business for the food(parts)and the server for the labor.

You may not be adding a tip, but 10% probably has been added to your bill.

Seems to make you feel proud that you are stealing from the people that serve you.

So you know most people in the world? Interesting. I am sure 99% of the customers you see tipping are the ones who do tip togo. What about the ones who you don&apos;t see tipping togo?

&quot;I have only had a job that gets tips for 2 years. I am 50 years old and my entire life, I make it very simple. I tip at least $5 for each person in my party that is eating.

If I have children with me, and they make a huge mess, I will add another $10.&quot;

These are not&quot;average&quot;tips by any means. Either you do very well at your job, or you hate having money in your wallet. But if thats what you want to do have fun.

&quot;One way to look at going to restaurant would be to look at it the same way as having a car repaired. When you have a car repaired you pay for parts and labor. When you go to a restaurant you pay the business for the food(parts)and the server for the labor.&quot;

Never thought about it like that. Sounds oily.

&quot;You may not be adding a tip, but 10% probably has been added to your bill.&quot;

I have never seen this added 10% on my togo check. If I saw 10% added I would be requesting a new slip from a manager. Then reconsider ever going back.

&quot;Seems to make you feel proud that you are stealing from the people that serve you.&quot;

The customer is not stealing from you, in fact the customer thinks your worth well more than $2.15 an hour(of more if you live in Cali)your getting paid from your manager. Stealing would imply you had something and then someone where to take it away. How would I steal something from you you never had?

 Ha Ha. I think you understand I mean 99% of the customers I serve leave a tip on to go orders.

Good you do understand the meaning of the word steal. When you do not tip a tipped employee that is making somewhere between $2.15 and $6.15 an hour depending on where they live, what you are stealing is a service. It would be no different than having a kid mow your grass. Pay them a couple of dollars for their gas and not giving them anything for the work of cutting the grass.

If you can&apos;t afford to tip, then trying going through the window of a fast food place. Here in North Carolina, they average about $8 an hour, as opposed to the $2.52 an hour tipped workers get.

If the amount paid is not enough to cover service either charge more or rethink your business plan.

So you admit that service charges would need to be added to your check to be able to make a fat hourly wage possible.&quot;Charge more.&quot;And you&apos;re okay with the industry forcing you to pay the average tip rather than it being at your discretion?

You really are completely illogical.

And that&apos;s exactly what will happen if more people do as you do. You&apos;ll end up paying far more than an extra 10% to pay these minimum wage and below employees. In the words of the guy from Men&apos;s Warehouse,&quot;I guarantee it&quot;. Well, there&apos;s another alternative that&apos;s less likely and that&apos;s that restaurants will simply stop offering the service, although I don&apos;t see this happening. What I&apos;d like to see is for restaurants to simply tell their guests that tipping is not allowed but add a to-go surcharge to pay their to-go emplyees. That might actually make a point about how much tips subsidize a server who only makes 2.13 an hour(or even $7.50 an hour in expensive places like California). I think you&apos;ll be shocked how much the restaurant would have to add to keep from losing money on to-go food.

Then have your manager either a)Add the tip on. b)stop taking togo orders all together.

Sure some people will complain and demand the tip removed. But what other options do you have?

&quot;I think you&apos;ll be shocked how much the restaurant would have to add to keep from losing money on to-go food.&quot;

It would force the restaurants who are not doing so well because of either bad food, service, or area to close their doors. Thus thinning out the heard so only the best restaurants make it. The top restaurants left behind would make so much money they could pay a decent wage. An aging business model from the 50s needs a major overhaul to compete in todays world.

 You really don&apos;t get it.

A restaurant doesn&apos;t&quot;need&quot;to-go food to stay open. They could stop doing it tomorrow and get along just fine. Sure, their total sales will go down. But their expenses would go down as well. They did just fine before the advent of to-go food. Or, to put it another way, to-go hasn&apos;t saved restaurants from going under. It certainly helps the bottom line, but if they actually had to pay a server $15 an hour to package to-go food, something would have to give because that would skew the cost basis of the food. One way they could do it is to raise the price of every meal, including the one that you eat while dining in, or they could add a to-go surcharge, which would probably piss off people like you who would complain that they&apos;re being treated unfairly, or they could simply stop offering it and not have to pay that $15 an hour server. BTW, in my previous restaurant, night time to-go was about the volume of two sections.

&quot;It works other places so why not here?

So I guess your saying the rest of the world is illogical then&quot;.

Faulty logic. Sure it works in other places but not&quot;the rest of the world&quot;. There is a substantial part of the American economy that operates in much the same way. Just look at the sales profession. Very few of them get a&quot;salary&quot;. They get a percentage of sales.

Should I say that the fact that you yourself don&apos;t get a salary makes the rest of the world crazy?

Get a grip, man.

Sales professions depending on getting a percentage of the sale are going the way of the doe doe. In recent years companies are switching from commission pay to salary pay and are seeing the benefits. These are interesting times we live in.

 Most sales positions are still commission-based. There are some, like CarMax, which has blended salary and commission. I&apos;ll bet your buddy Brad gets most of his money from commission. And let&apos;s not confuse draws with salary. Draws are always against sales.

The restaurant business has also adapted as well. You now have restaurants that offer acceptable food vis a vis the major chains, but have far fewer frills(Pei Wei vs. PF Chang&apos;s). That is a reason for folks like you to celebrate. You now have a choice(Boston Market was the big pioneer in this sort of concept). But it doesn&apos;t invalidate the original full service/tip concept. One thing that will have to give is when the two concepts meet in the&quot;managed to-go&quot;area(where to-go isn&apos;t just an incidental outcome from serving food). To-go customers will get a free ride only so long before economics will trump it. For right now, enough people subsidize the service by continuing to tip. But if the ratio changes and more people think it&apos;s ok not to tip on to-go food, it WILL chage. Either prices across the board will go up, penalizing in-house guests, surcharges will have to be imposed to increase wages for those servers who perform the to-go function, or menu prices for to-food will simply be more expensive to pay for those servers. You might be able to ride on the coattails of more enlightened diners who realize that someone has to play the wages of those who provide their to-go food, but if more of you choose that route, then things will change. Guaranteed.

 I hate to take to go orders as it takes me away from customers that stay and tip. I make the same $3.13 an hour to wait on to go orders. It seems that a lot of people just don&apos;t have a lot of respect for servers. People pay huge amounts of money for labor for other services, but want to count change, and go by percent when it comes to services. Every other industry charges more for the labor than the actual part. Tipping should be based more on the amount of work the server has done for you, not the percent of the check.

Also with the to go orders, if the cook working that night is bad enough, I will also cook their food, so I know it is right, still making the same $3.13 an hour.

I am 50 and have worked since I was 14. I have only had a job that gets tips for 2 years.

I have always tipped a fair amount. I appreciate what people do for me, when I go out to eat. To me it is just wonderful, to just sit there, look at a menu, have food brought to me, and then when I am done, the dirty dishes all just go away, and I haven&apos;t had to do a thing!!! I guess the majority of people are just used to being waited on hand and food, and it is no big deal to them.

When I have a table of 4 or more leave me a $5 tip or less, I say thank you have a good day, but in my mind, I am thinking thank you for helping keeping me in a constant state of poverty!!!

Do any of you that have never worked for tips have a clue how it feels when you have given your customer excellant service, sometimes even throwing in a few small freebies, to have them throw down $2 because that is some certain percent of the bill? Maybe since there are a lot of regulars I should give service based on a percent of the tip? Bad tippers getting 20% service of what a decent tipper would get?!?

&quot;Not only as another poster mentioned do servers have to bag, and make sure the order is right,&quot;

These actions are*************************NO****************************DIFFERENT WHAT-SO-EVER than what a fast food***CASHIER***DOES. Unless you are actually**BRINGING**the food to me at my car, its NOT TIP WORTHY, because you are doing the same or less amount of work than the fast food cashiers(excluding Sonic)do. Fast food cashiers(excluding Sonic)have to make sure the food is right also, so WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING DIFFERENTLY HERE? NOTHING! You really think you deserve to get paid by a customer, but somehow a Wendys, McDonalds, or Burger King cashier DOESNT? If they would be able to get tipped, then it would be fair if you would for a to-go order, but since they dont, you shouldnt get a tip for doing the same or less amount of work they do! You cannot see that?

&quot;but to go orders take time away from being able to wait on seated customers.&quot;

The concept of this has absolutely******************NOTHING******************to do with the actual&quot;SERVICE&quot;someone receives for a to-go order. People tip for&quot;SERVICE&quot;, NOT for taking away time from dine-in guests. Do you HONESTLY in your heart of hearts, think people that get to-go orders give a RATS ASS about people that are eating inside? Its NOT like those dine-in guests care about the to-go customers orders, so WHY should to-go customers care about dine-in guests then? Caring is a 2-WAY STREET, NOT A 1-WAY! TIPS stands for&quot;TO INSURE PROMPT SERVICE&quot;. NOTICE the word&quot;SERVICE&quot;in that. Waiting on tables is for OTHER PEOPLES SERVICES, NOT for the TO-GO CUSTOMER SERVICE. NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE OTHER IN EACH SITUATION. A dine-in guests could care LESS about the to-go customer and the to-go customer could care less about the dine-in guests. WHY in the WORLD should ANYONE be concerned with other peoples services that ARENT AFFECTING THEM? I sure arent worried about the to-go customers orders when I eat out, are you? I sure have NEVER thought about other people dining in during the not many times I have gotten take-out.

Tips are NOT FOR losing time on dine-in guest. WHY do you think someone deserves a tip based on that reason? It&apos;s NOT part of the to-go customer&apos;s service. The to-go customer shouldn&apos;t have to be concerned with what happens to other guests that are dining in. WHY SHOULD THEY? Do you think the dine-in guests are thinking about the to-go customer&apos;s time? HELL NO, they aren&apos;t. SO WHY should the to-go customer
care if their server is taking away time to serve them the way a FAST FOOD EMPLOYEE DOES? You want people to treat you FAIRLY, so WHY wouldnt you treat them that way? To-go customers arent thinking about dine-in guests. Their ONLY CONCERN IS GETTING THEIR FOOD IN A TIMELY MANNER, NOT GET OVERCHARGED, AND GETTING THEIR FOOD CORRECT. If you honestly think they would consider dine-in guests, you are seriously kidding yourself.

&quot;Why don&apos;t people want to pay for the work others do for them?!?&quot;

NO ONE IS ALLOWED to tip McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, or Burger King cashiers, so if we can&apos;t tip for the work they do for us, WHY for the work it takes to prepare a to-go order at a restaurant when the SAME or even LESS SERVICE is being given by the to-go server than a cashier at Wendy&apos;s.

&quot;ghowen99 the good news is that most people aren&apos;t like you, where I work 99% of the customers do tip for to go orders.&quot;

Maybe in the restaurant you work at, but truthfully MOST people ARE LIKE ghowen99 and me. You say that, but then you say later on: I hate to take to go orders as it takes me away from customers that stay and tip. So WHICH IS IT, YOU KNOW?

Obviously, by you stating to go orders as it takes me away from customers that stay and tip, must mean MOST DO NOT TIP FOR TO-GO ORDERS AND THAT YOU ARE ALL BULL SH**TING US THAT THEY DO! I would say, about 30%-40% maybe do, just from working at the donut shop/diner for over 2yrs seeing people that DO, but it was less than 10 people that tipped through drive through even though sometimes it was MORE WORK to get their order to them than some people that tipped me for just a cup of coffee. Did that make ANY SENSE? OF COURSE NOT, but MOST people think Its DRIVE-THRU so its OK NOT TO TIP. I feel NO ONE SHOULD tip for TO-GO ORDERS unless its a HUGE ORDER LIKE around 10 or more items.

I feel by you stating that to go orders as it takes me away from customers that stay and tip, shows to me, anyways, that you are LYING that 99% of people tipping for to-go orders if you are here COMPLAINING ABOUT IT. If you were getting tipped for to-go orders almost all the time, you wouldnt be COMPLAING, because even 10% is GENEROUS on a to-go order. I feel if you cannot possible tip the cashier for getting me my syrups , butters, utensils(fork&amp;knife)at McDonalds to also ring me up, and give me my change or credit card back, then WHY THE HELL TIP YOU FOR THE SAME OR LESS AMOUNT OF WORK? HOW THE HELL IS THAT FAIR TO THE CUSTOMERS MONEY? If you do not like it, WORK AT A PLACE THAT PAYS AT LEAST****MINIMUM WAGE*****INSTEAD and QUIT YOUR BITCHING!

I HONESTLY FEEL you have CONTRADICTED YOURSELF, by saying 99% of people tip for to-go orders, NOW you COMPLAIN that to-go orders takes you away from customers that tip. WELL GEE; YOU WERE CAUGHT IN A LIE, HUH? HOW DOES THAT FEEL? OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE LIE TO GET MORE TIPS. If customers tipped you even a buck, you should be HAPPY with that for a TO-GO order, because you ARENT SERVING them at a TABLE, you are COUNTER HELP just as I WAS, NOTHING MORE WHEN YOU SERVED CUSTOMER TO-GO ORDERS.

&quot;Some more than the sit down customers.&quot;

I will agree it&apos;s ass backwards when I worked at the donut shop. I served people non-donut food such as burgers, fries, sandwiches, refills, condiments to their table, took their order, etc. with things that were all correct and in a timely fashion, they would never tip. There would be people who would get a dozen glaze and leave a whole buck. There would be regular coffee drinkers which just a couple of them actually tipped a whole buck. A buck for a cup of coffee with some refills is A LOT for almost no service.

On Christmas day on year, a man at DRIVE-THRU tipped his change from a $20 from his order, which was $11 and something cents. I think tipping is ass backwards. I should have been getting tipped from people dining in, NOT to-go orders, especially not through drive-thru.

&quot;Those that tip for sure get more extra goodies in their bag than those that don&apos;t.&quot;

Do you PAY for those extra goodies? Do you get your manager&apos;s permission to give things without ringing them up? If the answer is&quot;NO&quot;to both of these questions, then LOOK IN THE MIRROR WHO IS THE&quot;REAL THIEF&quot;that is being UNFAIR to their employer, yet you want people to feel sorry for you if you are stealing from your employer, because that is a CRIME. If you answered no, then you are stealing from the restaurant and you had no permission to just give away stuff. So, if that is TRULY SO, WHY ACT LIKE***YOU***ARE SOMEHOW THE INNOCENT VICTIM, if you STEAL to get BETTER TIPS? I am NOT saying you are, because JUST MAYBE YOU DID TRULY GET YOUR MANAGERS PERMISSION NOT TO RING THE ITEMS UP, WHO KNOWS, EXCEPT YOU? I would like to know if you did get permission to not ring up items?

&quot;what you are tipping for is for all areas of work that has been performed by the server: From taking the order down to filling the salt shakers.&quot;

I hate to break it to you, but&quot;SIDE WORK&quot;is*******************NOT**********************PART of the&quot;CUSTOMER&apos;S SERVICE&quot;, because it was done**BEFORE**OR**AFTER**the customer hasn&apos;t even arrived or has left the restaurant. It is NOT POSSIBLE TO RECEIVE SOMETHING YOU AREN&apos;T PHYSICALLY THERE TO RECEIVE. Even if you refilled it while I was there, the $2.13/hr is paid by the owner of the restaurant for that type of stuff in Louisiana for servers.
TIPS are for&quot;SERVICE&quot;, NOT RESTOCKING! Even when I worked at the donut shop, do you HONESTLY think I felt I should get tipped through drive-thru just because I RESTOCKED the drive-thru area with things such as ketchups, sugars, creamers, napkins, plastic utensils, as well as go fresh ice in the back when the ice became low, screwed in the syrups for the soft drinks, restocked the milks, etc.? HELL F NO, I didn&apos;t! I restocked ICE, SUGAR SHAKERS, SWEET-N-LOW PACKETS, EQUAL PACKETS, KETCHUP, MAYO&amp;MUSTARD(PACKETS&amp;BOTTLES), MILKS, ORANGE JUICES, JELLIES&amp;BUTTERS, NAPKINS, CUPS, DONUT BOXES(GOT THEM OUT OF BOXES AND HAD TO FOLD SOME), STRAWS, LIDS, MADE NEXT POT OF COFFEE, COFFEE GROUNDS ONCE IN A WHILE TO FILL THE GRINDER UP(NOT EVERY SHIFT), REFILL SHOWCASE WITH POWDERING AND FILLING DONUTS IN THE KITCHEN, ETC. My point is, DID I EXPECT A TIP FOR ALL THOSE TASKS? HELL F NO! Even if I would have gotten paid less than minimum wage, those tasks are CERTAINTLY******NOT*******IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, tasks to TIP for, because they are EITHER THE SAME OR LESS AMOUNT OF WORK THAN MOST FAST FOOD RESTAURANT CASHIERS DO. All those tasks a CASHIER can do and most probably does at McDonalds, Wendys, and Burger King for NO TIP AT ALL.

Also, by mentioning&quot;SALT SHAKERS&quot;, that shows that you are a COMPLETE IDIOT TO MENTION THIS, because filling salt shakers has absolutely*************NOTHING and I mean NOTHING*************AT ALL to do with a&quot;TO-GO&quot;ORDER, because a customer that would order something to-go wouldn&apos;t use stuff that is inside 9 times out of 10, which this should be a DUH situation here. They would use****SALT PACKETS****, NOT SALT SHAKERS, DUH! So as far as salt goes, refilling salt packets area would be what you would be doing for a to-go customer. Refilling salt&quot;SHAKERS&quot;is for people that DINE IN. HOW THE HELL CAN SOMEONE BENEFIT IF THEY GET SOMETHING TO-GO FOR YOU FILLING SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH PEOPLE DINING INSIDE? THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BENEFIT FROM IT, SO IT&apos;S*******NOT************PART OF THEIR SERVICE. IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE! SO WHY THE HELL TIP FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS*********************NOTHING****************************AT ALL TO DO WITH***THEIR***SERVICE? WHY WOULD ANYONE BE THAT STUPID TO CONSIDER SUCH A THING? This is COMMON SENSE that you filling a salt shaker DOESNT BENEFIT**ME**if I NEVER DINE INSIDE! HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BENEFIT ME UNLESS I ACTUALLY OPENED MY FOOD UP AND SALTED MY STUFF INSIDE, WHICH 99.9% of people that would order something to-go would NEVER do that? I would just ask for SALT-PACKETS if I wanted some salt. This is just a DUH situation. Even if I would use salt inside lets say, the act of REFILLING was done*************BEFOREHAND***************, SO THEREFORE IS***************NOT*********************ANYWHERE NEAR PART OF ANYONES SERVICE TO TIP FOR! Even people dining inside ARENT actually RECEIVING SERVICE FROM YOU IF THEY ARE ONLY RESTOCKING, because you are filling up that salt shaker for ALL your customers, NOT JUST that person. McDonalds have to replace salt-n-pepper shakers too. For us at the donut shop, we just replaced the salt&amp;pepper shakers and didnt have to refill them. I had to fill up sugar shakers, but honestly, WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT I DID FOR THAT CUSTOMER THAT DRANK A CUP OF COFFEE? The things I did for a person that drank a cup of coffee with sugar and creamers are: 1. Got their order 2. Rang them up. 3. Got them change 4. Got them creamers. The sugar containers were there ALREADY FILLED***BEFORE***a person placed their order. Even if the server would be refilling it at the time I ordered, that action of RESTOCKING is for the****RESTAURANT***for ALL CUSTOMERS, NOT JUST FOR THAT ONE AND ONLY PARTICULAR CUSTOMER, THEREFORE HOW THE HELL CAN IT BE PART OF***JUST**THEIR SERVICE ONLY? WHO the hell would base their tip on others service? I sure dont. Pouring a cup of coffee IS service, but filling up the sugar containers arent. Pressing the button to ground the grounds, filling the coffee grinder with coffee beans, putting a fresh coffee filter in and pressing the button to start making a fresh pot of coffee is**NOT**just for ONE customer and is truly for ALL GUESTS. Do you get that? The tip is for what you do for the INDIVIDUAL PARTY OR CUSTOMER, NOT FOR ALL CUSTOMERS AT ONCE THAT ARE IN THE RESTAURANT. Like you are really going to tip me lets say at the donut shop, because I filled up the napkin area in drive-thru, even though you ate INSIDE? DOESNT THAT SOUND A BIT RIDICULOUS? Well, if you say NO, well THATS WHAT YOU ARE COMPARING! APPLES TO ORANGES IS WHAT YOU ARE COMPARING! If you are receiving drive-thru service, you should***ONLY***and I mean***ONLY***BE CONCERNED WITH DRIVE-THRU SITUATIONS, which honestly restocking is NOT PART of a customers service, its a part of ALL restaurant patrons service, therefore, WHY would you help with the tip for everyone else? Especially something you would NEVER*(*BENEFIT*)*FROM such as salt shakers inside even through you are getting a to-order with packets already. That would be NUTS if you would consider that, when NO ONE CAN CONSIDER that service to tip for McDonalds, Wendys, or Burger King Cashiers, so WHY treat a TO-GO order ANY DIFFERENTLY just cause they are PAID LESS? I PERSONALLY DO NOT CARE HOW MUCH SOMEONE IS PAID.

I tip at least $5 for each person in my party that is eating. If we are just having a sandwhich and a drink, then $3 per person. If we are just having coffe, then $2 per person. If I have children with me, and they make a huge mess, I will add another $10.

One thing, a HUGE MESS is something the workers will clean up********AFTER*********YOU ARE GONE, therefore, you COULDNT POSSIBLY RECEIVE THAT SERVICE, SO WHY THE HELL TIP FOR SOMETHING YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY PHYSICALLY RECEIVE? THATS STUPID and INSANE!

Sorry, but if the coffee is lets say a buck or a little over that, thats RIDCULOUS to tip $2. A dollar is PLENTY for just a cup of coffee with a few refills. Even a bars, a dollar a mixed drink is the norm, which a cup of coffee that a CUSTOMER actually puts the creamers and sugars in THEMSELVES wouldnt make ANY SENSE to even pay a whole buck for that, unless you would get around 5 or so refills, which a buck is PLENTY I feel for just POURING into a cup every-so-often.

&quot;One way to look at going to restaurant would be to look at it the same way as having a car repaired. When you have a car repaired you pay for parts and labor. When you go to a restaurant you pay the business for the food(parts)and the server for the labor.&quot;

Hate to break it to you, but NO, it&apos;s NOT THE&quot;SAME&quot;at ALL. Getting your car repaired you have to pay by************LAW************, which unless you are using a coupon that makes you pay automatic gratuity at a restaurant, there are NO LAWS STATING YOU HAVE TO TIP FOR A TO-GO ORDER. When someone pays for parts, service, and labor, that has to be paid for by LAW. When someone picks up a to-go order, the SAME PERSON that took the order fixes the order just as I have had at some fast food places. I didn&apos;t say ALL the time, but I have had the CASHIER that took my order, usually always normally fill the cup with ice and drink at Wendy&apos;s. The SAME cashier one time also made my sandwich as well as got mayo&amp;mustard in a couple of cups as I asked for(NOT PACKETS). If&quot;SHE&quot;actually did all the work, then WHY she can&apos;t get a tip, but a to-go server somehow deserves to be treated ANY differently? Just because they make a different amount per hour from their employer than a to-go server does has absolutely**************************NOTHING*************************to do with the actually&quot;SERVICE&quot;the customer is receiving. WHO CARES&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;you make from your employer? That is between YOU and YOUR EMPLOYER. MOST of the times I got to-go orders, the condiments were NOT in the bag as I ordered OVER THE PHONE, which makes me even more feel like I shouldnt tip. HOW HARD IS IT TO CHECK THE BAG, like LITERALLY 20 seconds if that?

&quot;You may not be adding a tip, but 10% probably has been added to your bill.&quot;

NOPE, NEVER had that happen before unless I have eaten inside with a huge party. I have caught 3 times 4 cent overcharged, so I would DEFINITELY NOTICE something like that.

&quot;Seems to make you feel proud that you are stealing from the people that serve you.&quot;

You seem to be stealing from the restaurant you work at I am ASSUMING. Maybe you should look yourself in the MIRROR FIRST BEFORE YOU JUDGE OTHERS if this IS the case. Now maybe I could be wrong in that you either have your managers permission not to charge for some things or you pay for it out of your OWN pocket, which I seriously doubt either one you do, so if I am right about that, you are a THIEF? I SERIOUSLY get SOOOOOOOOOOO MANY TIMES SOFT DRINKS THAT ARENT ON THE BILL, which I TRULY DO NOT KNOW IF THE MANGER STATES THEY CAN NOT CHARGE FOR THAT OR IF THE SERVERS TRY TO DO IT PURPOSELY FOR A BETTER TIP? Just Friday night, the waitress we had saved us 4 bucks from not charging us for 2 soft drinks, then for lunch(we had the day off), the waitress didnt charge me for my soft drink and INTENTIONALLY PUT WATER on the check instead of Dr. Pepper, so that meant she DIDNT FORGET, but was NOT CHARGING ME ON PURPOSE TO GET A BETTER TIP.

&quot;Good you do understand the meaning of the word steal. When you do not tip a tipped employee that is making somewhere between $2.15 and $6.15 an hour depending on where they live, what you are stealing is a service.&quot;

I feel if you dont ring up things without your managers permission to give freebies to people or without paying for them YOURSELF, you have NO ROOM TO TALK ABOUT STEALING, if you do it yourself. You would be a hypocrite if you are underringing items people order without your managers permission or without paying for them yourself.

NO, it wouldnt be stealing, because it truly DOESN&apos;T MATTER&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;a person makes to get tipped or not. Do you see tip jars even at Starbucks, Baskin Robbins, Subway or Quiznos? Even Dominos and Pizza Hut I have seen tip jars at. Do these people that put money in these jars actually CONSIDER how much someone makes? OBVIOUSLY they don&apos;t and tip anyways; otherwise, these people would NEVER make tips much at all. If people considered the $6/hr I made as Counter Help, I would have NEVER, EVER, made tips on to-go orders, which honestly, MOST of my tips came from to-go orders HONESTLY, just because more people got stuff to-go than ate and tipped for dine-in service, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I actually made per hour. Do I feel I deserved a tip for to-go? OF COURSE NOT, WHY SHOULD I? I dont tip Wendys cashiers, so WHY should they have tipped me for doing the SAME TASKS?

So if we can&apos;t tip for a McDonald&apos;s&quot;CASHIER&quot;to ring me up, give me change, get the package of hotcakes and sausage, get utensils, a coffee cup with coffee, butters, syrups, and jelly, then WHY would I tip for a to-go order that has sometimes LESS SERVICE such as lets say get I order one pasta entree from Applebee&apos;s? Applebee&apos;s has an all-in-one package of a napkin, salt-n-pepper packets, and utensils. So that&apos;s even LESS WORK than the example I just mentioned at McDonald&apos;s. Didnt you say this: Tipping should be based more on the amount of work the server has done for you, not the percent of the check? If that is so, then WHY ARE YOU ACTING AS IF PEOPLE SHOULD BE****UNFAIR****TO EVERYONE THAT SERVES CUSTOMERS? What amount you get paid is between YOU and YOUR EMPLOYER, NOBODY ELSE. The customer is getting either the SAME OR LESS SERVICE THAN COUNTER SERVICE AT WENDYS OR MCDONALDS. You want people to tip you for the AMOUNT OF WORK you have done, then DONT EVER EXPECT A TIP FOR WORK THAT ISNT NORMALLY TIPPED FOR because those employees cannot expect tips.

&quot;It would be no different than having a kid mow your grass. Pay them a couple of dollars for their gas and not giving them anything for the work of cutting the grass.&quot;

NO, by LAW I would have to pay them. If I wouldn&apos;t, I would think the person could report me. If you feel that&quot;cutting grass&quot;is the same thing, then think about the service you get at Wendy&apos;s or Burger King or McDonald&apos;s. We DO NOT get to&quot;PAY FOR THEIR SERVICE&quot;do we? We aren&apos;t allowed to. So if those fast food employees cannot earn tips, WHY THE HELL SHOULD TO-GO SERVERS? Your pay has NOTHING to do with THE AMOUNT OF WORK YOU ACTUALLY PROVIDED THE CUSTOMER. You want people to treat you FAIRLY, but you EXPECT people to treat you UNFAIRLY by tipping for a to-go order. That just takes the cake, it really does! By LAW we do not have to tip a person at all for a to-go order. So this comparison is STUPID.

Every other industry charges more for the labor than the actual part.

In those other industries, you HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY FOR THE LABOR. If you dont, you can go to JAIL. Tipping on a to-go order on the other hand is NOT MANDATORY by law.

&quot;If you can&apos;t afford to tip, then trying going through the window of a fast food place.&quot;

I CAN afford to tip. The fact is, I treat WORKERS EQUALLY, that if I dont tip Wendy&apos;s**CASHIER**(which I have had a CASHIER MAKE MY BURGER BEFORE)for making my burger, putting mayo&amp;mustard in a cup for me cause I don&apos;t like packets, putting drink in my cup with ICE, and putting fries on the tray, then I will NOT tip the person that does the same thing or LESS WORK EVEN no matter&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;they make. WHO CARES&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;they make per hour? THAT concept has NOTHING to do with the**AMOUNT**of service I ACTUALLY RECEIVE. People don&apos;t base tips on&quot;HOW MUCH&quot;people make, because otherwise, places like Starbucks would NEVER have tippers, now WOULD THEY? My sister-n-law worked a few years ago at Starbucks. She made $6.50/hr plus tips that were shared with the rest of the co-workers working the counter. People DID tip some, even though her and her co-workers made at least minimum wage. Also, I feel that a Frappacino is the SAME AMOUNT of work as a bartender would have to make a pina colada or a white russian or margarita. So just because its not ALCOHOL DOESNT mean they shouldnt be tipped like a BARTENDER, REGARDLESS of what wage per hour they make. You say tipping should be based on the AMOUNT OF WORK, well that means I should NEVER consider HOW MUCH a person makes serving me HONESTLY. WHY THE HELL SHOULD I CARE IF YOU MAKE A PENNY FROM YOUR EMPLOYER IF YOU PROVIDE NO EXTRA SERVICE THAN WHAT A WENDYS CASHIER WOULD PROVIDE ME WITH? The amount of work should be compared with EVERYONE I tip IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. An example: I dont tip a cashier at Wal-Mart nor Wendys, nor McDonalds, nor Burger King, so WHY would I any place else just because lets say another cashier makes hypothetically $3.00/hr? The cashier is doing the**********SAME**********AMOUNT OF WORK, so WHY should I****CARE****or that be MY BUSINESS as to HOW MUCH this cashier makes compared to another one? I go by AMOUNT OF WORK someone does for me and compare that to what we dont get to tip for and what we do get to tip for. You seem to feel its unfair that people tip basing on percentages, but here YOU are being UNFAIR by EXPECTING customers to CONSIDER a job that is NOT tipped ANYWHERE ELSE, which is being a CASHIER.

The coffee only drinkers are usually the best customers, and they tip from $1 to $2. As to the other she should have kept that in the back room!!!

Maybe at the restaurant you work at, but MOST of the time, I made about a quarter at the donut shop back then between 1998-2002. This shouldnt have changed THAT much since then, I only received the change from the coffee. When a coffee was 75 cents in 1998, I got a quarter. When the coffee price went up to 87cents, I would get 15 cents sometimes people would try to add it up to a quarter for the tip by adding the extra cents.

ONLY a FEW people tipped a whole buck for just coffee when they dined inside and I mean a SELECT FEW NO MATTER WHAT EFFICIENT SERVICE YOU PROVIDED, because most were CHEAPSKATES.

Considering we have to do a lot more for the customer than most servers, yes I feel we should be tipped more. Most servers just wait on customers, pre-bus the tables, and fill things up. We do that plus bus the table, wash all of the dishes, pots and pans, run the cash register, do prep work, and sometimes cook if we have a cook that doesn&apos;t know what they are doing.

Bussing the table is usually done BEFORE or AFTER someone has gone or left, therefore its not even POSSIBLE to be actually PART of someones service. At most restaurants, the server tips out a percentage of the sales to their bussers, but**CUSTOMERS DONT TIP BUSSERS**DO THEY? We have NO REASON TO, because its******NOT******PART OF OUR SERVICE. What you do BEFORE or AFTER our service has NOTHING to do with OUR SERVICE. You may use logic such as You wouldnt have that clean table if we didnt clean it BEFORE you got seated would say the busser, but I feel since I am NOT tipping the busser, that has NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH WHO THE HELL I AM TIPPING WHICH IS MY SERVER!

Washing dishes is WHY you are getting a payment from your employer to begin with. Servers in Louisiana make $2.13/hr, so you are getting a dollar HIGHER per hour than servers here.

I dont feel you should have to cook though. The hourly rate you are getting still pays for that cooking that you would RARELY being doing.

&quot;If they have to wait to long, I don&apos;t charge for the drinks. Sometimes even throwing in a few small freebies, to have them throw down $2 because that is some certain percent of the bill?.&quot;

Again, did you get your MANAGER&apos;S PERMISSION to do this? IF NOT, LOOK IN THE MIRROR WHO IS THE THIEF! If you are truly INTENTIONALLY not ringing up stuff WITHOUT your managers permission OR if you arent paying for it OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET YOURSELF, THEN I TRULY DO NOT FEEL SORRY FOR YOU AT ALL, NOT AT ALL! ANYONE THAT STEALS DESERVES CRAP IN THEIR LIFE FOR BEING A BAD PERSON! Do you think theres a real difference in a person that steals from a store and a person that underings items for their own personal gain? OF COURSE NOT, THERES NOT A DIFFERENCE. In BOTH situations, the person is STEALING.

&quot;If however the only reason they are giving you bad service is the fact they have a bad attitude and or they are just plain lazy, then the best way you can let them know they gave bad service, is to clear a spot in the center of the table, and leave one very shiny penny were they will have to see.&quot;

I DISAGREE, I feel if the server was bad, LEAVE NOTHING. WHY should they even deserve a penny if they were THAT BAD? I feel thats MY HARD EARNED PENNY and if the server was REALLY HORRIBLE, they DESERVE ZERO. My husband and I usually dont have coin change on us, because we pay with a credit card. We bring cash thats not coins, but I wouldnt have a penny on me unless I found one on the ground or something. Even then, EVERYTIME I have had horrible service that we stiffed a server(which is VERY RARE), me or my husband would put either $0.00 or $, such as that. I WOULD NEVER LEAVE A PENNY TO SOMEONE THAT SUCKED, because the DONT DESERVE A PENNY EVEN IF THEY SUCKED THAT POORLY. In my opinion, if the server sucked that badly to leave nothing like that, they had to KNOW what they did wrong, otherwise, they must have been born under a rock not to know how many mistakes or how long they made us wait unnecessarily for things. I feel $0.00, shows the way you feel MORE than if you just leave a penny, because that server still made a PROFIT from YOU.

&quot;Then complain to management, and never go back again.&quot;

I disagree about never going back to MOST restaurants unless the manager is mean, because if I NEVER went back to every restaurant I had bad service from, I would NEVER go to ANY RESTAURANT. Almost ALL restaurants have bad servers. I just simply ask not to get that particular server again if the service was bad. I have a list of servers I don&apos;t want at Chili&apos;s, Outback, and Applebee&apos;s. I also have servers I request at those restaurants.

Yes servers expect tips on to go orders.

Even Subway and Quiznos workers expect tips today. I think the TIP JAR phenomenon is getting RIDICULOUS. I use to work at a donut shop, which I made $6/hr plus tips, which I stated out at $5.15/hr in Jan. 1998. I feel the people that tipped me for TO-GO orders were INSANE. I personally wouldnt EVER do it unless I would order a huge amount, which I never have ordered more than like 2 entres worth before as a to-go order.

I DO NOT FEEL SERVERS SHOULD EXPECT A TIP FOR TO-GO ORDERS. A LOT of the time, they arent even correct. I just recently got an entre to-go from Applebees and it wasnt correct. I asked for no salt on the fries, which you could actually***SEE***there was tons of salt on it. I also asked for a side of remoulade sauce, which only when I got there, did the bartender say I will have to go get the remoulade sauce. My order was sitting there BEFORE I arrived, so she COULD HAVE PREPARED to get it BEFORE I arrived. My order should have been CORRECT BEFORE I was handing it WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT TO GET IT CORRECTED. I had also ordered a BIG side of mexi-ranch, which it was filled only about halfway. I feel WHATS THE POINT OF ME ASKING FOR A BIG SIDE IF I AM NOT GOING TO RECEIVE THAT considering the BARTENDER COULD HAVE***SEEN**THAT IT WASNT A FULL SIDE? If I wanted a HALF BIG SIDE I would have ordered just a SIDE instead of a BIG side. My point is, there were SEVERAL MISTAKES with the order and MOST of the times I have gotten take-out, there was at least ONE mistake that was obvious. I dont get take-out very often though. Anyway, my point is, even if the order would have been 100% correct, all she did was ring up my order, stick the entre in the bag and the containers of condiments in the bag, put the all-in-one napkin-salt-n-pepper packets-utensils, and rung me up. I think my order was taken over the phone by someone else even possibly, I do not know or care. What is truly******DIFFERENT*********about getting hotcakes and sausage about McDonalds CASHIER than a to- order from a restaurant? THERE ISNT A DIFFERENCE HERE, except that the McDonalds cashier may have had MORE WORK. To treat people FAIR AND EQUALLY, customers should get to tip that way. If I dont tip McDonalds cashiers, I sure am NOT going to tip for ONE entre order at Applebees UNLESS they BRING IT TO MY CAR, which I will NEVER get that type of service unless its raining hard.

When I have a table of 4 or more leave me a $5 tip or less, I say thank you have a good day, but in my mind, I am thinking thank you for helping keeping me in a constant state of poverty!!!

WHAT IF you did a BAD JOB? So a tip of $4 is not BETTER than ZERO? Thank your lucky stars its not ZERO TIP. I feel if lets say I ask for a refill, unless my server has a GOOD explanation of WHY I waited 10 minutes for a refill, they WILL get less than 10%! Like if they say the syrup ran out and it took time to get the new one on, thats UNDERSTANDABLE, but if I see them have time to buss a table, meanwhile I am STILL WAITING for my damn refill, well WHAT KIND OF TIP DO THEY EXPECT, I mean really? If I see that, under 15% right off the bat. Its common sense. If I asked for something, well those dishes can wait an extra few minutes. They dont have legs to move by themselves or something. Cleaning up is just LITERALLY something you can ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS DO******AFTER******I have gotten my refill. Its just simply being NICE to someone by THINKING OF THEIR TIME, NOT OF YOUR SIDEWORK! You want people to tip you, so you have to THINK of THEIR TIME MORE THAN CLEAN UP WORK. Lets say you are waiting to order at Wendys. Would you like it if the cashier KNEW you were waiting to place your order, but she decided to buss a couple of tables instead and all you wanted was to get TO-GO food? Maybe YOU personally wouldnt care to wait, but 99.9% of people out there DO CARE to WAIT LONGER THAN NECESSARY FOR ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING!

Also if you go by percent, then a person working at a WH should get at least 80% for excellant service as we are doing 4 jobs for you 1. server 2. busboy 3. dishwasher 4. cashier

Since WHEN do CASHIERS*((((((((((((((((((((EVER)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))*GET TIPPED? DO YOU TIP YOUR WAL-MART CASHIER, YOUR GAS STATION CASHIER, YOUR DRUG STORE CASHIER, MCDONALDS, WENDYS, OR BURGER KING CASHIERS, YOUR CASHIER ANYWHERE FOR THAT MATTER? Quiznos, Subway, and Starbucks get tips because of the person making the sandwich or fixing coffee, which I feel is stupid to tip for that, but my point is, they dont get tipped for just RINGING UP THE ORDER, NOW DO THEY? HELL NO, SO WHY THE HELL SHOULD BEING A CASHIER COUNT FOR ANYTHING IN THE TIP? Also, if you ring up people, thats what SERVERS NORMALLY DO AT MOST RESTAURANTS. Its a rarity to have restaurants such as Waffle House or Dennys where you have to GET UP to pay your bill. Chilis, Red Lobster, Outback, Applebees, etc., have servers that ring up orders and bring back change to the actually tables, NOT JUST COUNTER SERVICE to give change back by. Being a CASHIER may be more work in that maybe you are ringing up other tables you dont serve, which then you should blame that responsibility on the OWNER of that restaurant that you are being a cashier getting paid below minimum wage. Cashiers NORMALLY DO******************NOT******************EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, RECEIVE TIPS, SO WHY DO YOU THINK ITS********FAIR************TO EVERY OTHER CASHIER IN THE UNITED STATES IF YOU DO? ITS NOT, SO WHY THE HELL SHOULD YOU RECEIVE A TIP FOR DOING LESS WORK THAN A WAL-MART CASHIER DOES? Just because your EMPLOYER PAYS YOU LESS HAS***********ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL****************TO DO WITH THE SERVICE YOU ARE PROVIDING YOUR CUSTOMERS COMPARED TO OTHER CASHIERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

Sorry, but NOBODY IN THE UNIVERSE TIPS A CASHIER. Even at Subway, Starbucks, or Quiznos, the people that tip, base that tip on fixing the product they are selling such as making the sandwiches or fixing the coffee. I am willing to bet these customers that tip at these type of places that have tip jars arent truly basing their tips on you ringing them up at the counter area. You seem to want people to treat YOU fairly, but YOU are acting as if they should treat you like you are doing something different from EVERYWHERE ELSE by ringing people up at a counter, but you are doing the SAME THING THEY ARE FOR NO TIP, SO WHY THE HELL SHOULD PEOPLE TREAT ONE CASHIER DIFFERENTLY FROM ANOTHER JUST BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYER DOESNT PAY THEM ENOUGH? Wouldnt you want to make tips too if you worked at McDonalds as well? I dont care if the person makes $3 an hour or $30 an hour, the fact is if what as you said AMOUNT OF WORK is the SAME, I will treat YOU the SAME THAT I TREAT THEM, REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH YOU MAKE PER HOUR. That person that makes $6.50/hr DESERVES to get tipped just as YOU DESERVE for doing the SAME JOB. Since we arent allowed to tip at McDonalds or at our stores, WHY should I be pay you, but not pay them? Its NOT FAIR if***THE CUSTOMER***TREATS the people that do the same things for them differently, just because they make more or less money per hour. I treat people EQUALLY, that if I dont tip a cashier for ANYTHING, I am sure not going to tip YOU for the sole position of being a cashier. I will NOT EVER CONSIDER BEING A CASHIER as***TIP WORTHY***, because its***NOT***ANYWHERE ELSE, SO WHY WAFFLE HOUSE SHOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT? Do you think you are more ENTITLED to a tip for doing the SAME EXACT JOB AS SOMEONE ELSE, just because your employer is a CHEAPSKATE? YOU ARENT ENTITLED TO MORE MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS JUST BECAUSE YOU MAKE LESS PER HOUR. Just as you said Tipping should be based more on the amount of work the server has done for you, not the percent of the check, well then YOU ARE ADMITTING that tipping should be based on the***AMOUNT OF WORK***, so if you HAVENT DONE ANYMORE WORK THAN ANY OTHER CASHIER WOULD NORMALLY HAVE, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ENTITLED TO LIST CASHIER AS SOMETHING THAT IS SOMEHOW TIP WORTHY? I would like to know your answer?

The idea when making food is to not send out food, that you would not be willing to eat yourself.

This is one of the ONLY things I AGREE 100% with you on. A GOOD SERVER serves food that actually LOOKS good to eat, not that looks as if theres something wrong with it.

I also clear their tables, wash their dishes

Honestly, these things are NOT part of someones service. I personally do NOT care if my dishes are taken off my table unless its a small table, because its not something I really care about or let bother me. If it is a small table, I could care less if you put the dishes on the next table next to me instead going to the kitchen to put them in the sink. The dish on a big table HONESTLY DOESNT BOTHER ME IF ITS NEVER REMOVED THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE SERVICE. Its NOT SOMETHING I REALLY CARE ABOUT. I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE THINGS I WANT and ASK FOR. As far as washing the dishes goes, thats something between*******ONLY YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYER****and has ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH SOMEONES SERVICE YOU ARE PROVIDING THEM. Do you not understand that? If you washed my dish I am eating off of***BEFORE***I got seated, I NEVER actually RECEIVED that service DID I? OF COURSE NOT, because I WASNT PHYSICALLY THERE TO RECEIVE IT, WAS I? Its TOTALLY****IMPOSSIBLE****TO RECEIVE SERVICE THAT HAPPENS BEFORE OR AFTER YOU ARRIVE!

If you cleared off the table*******BEFORE********I WAS SEATED, you would be clearing it off at the end of the night anyways, due to HEALTH regulations by LAW REGARDLESS of ME sitting there and you clearing if off, that action was((((BEFORE))))I EVEN ARRIVED AT THE TABLE, so it DOESNT COUNT FOR SQUAT IN MY SERVICE! Sorry, but people tip for their***SERVICE***; NOT THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THEIR SERVICE!

I make $3.13 an hour, and with tips based on percent, I am not making enough money to do anything with. I can&apos;t have a car of my own or a place to live of my own.

Honestly, GO WORK AT A RESTAURANT THAT SELLS LIQUOR and some entres that are more expensive. Even at Chilis, my husband and Is average check amount is around $60-$67 or so, so think of what percentage tip I leave. I leave sometimes 25%, so even with all the tip outs, I am willing to bet the server gets to keep around $10 of the around $16.50 or so we leave. YOU NEED TO GO WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE YOU DONT HAVE TO COOK OR BE A FULL TIME BUSSER.

I feel like I give them very good service, make sure their orders are right before I bring them out.

I am glad to know SOME servers actually DO THIS, because A LOT DONT CARE WHAT THE HELL THEY HAND YOU. It could be filled with roaches and theyd still hand it to you it seems.

I feel like I give them very good service, make sure their orders are right before I bring them out.

You HONESTLY DO NOT GET IT! People ARENT CHEAP, because people arent going to go by YOUR*ONLY*STANDARDS of tipping. People go by PERCENTAGES, NOT BY $5/person type of tipping methods. MOST people DO NOT TIP 40% or higher, but you seem to expect them to. I agree, for the amount of work you do for a customer you SHOULD DESERVE more, but you CANNOT expect $5 on a$10.80 meal very often. It just doesnt happen often. You go to work a restaurant where they have CHEAP food, you will get CHEAP tippers. Its the TRUTH. I am pretty sure Dennys is the SAME WAY NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF SERVICE YOU PROVIDE. I remember when they had or maybe even still have the $2.99 grand slam breakfast at Dennys. I find that meal to be a LOT of work to serve a customer with getting their order correct or if they had substitutions or additions. The fact is people tip on PERCENTAGES of the check amounts, which is the norm. Thats just how SOCIETY is with tipping for the most part as far as restaurants go. HOW can you say they are CHEAP if they have tipped you what they THOUGHT was a decent tip from what the NORM is? You CANNOT expect people to throw $5 on a $10.80 meal 99% of the time, because MOST WILL NOT EVER DO THAT!

We are your servers not your servants!!!

Actually, you are in a WAY our SERVANTS for that amount of time, because if we ask for something, you HAVE to get it, because its YOUR JOB to. If there is a problem, YOU are the person we ask to please fix the problem, even if there are 5 problems, you are there to help with them. YOU ARE, in a sense, serving people on hand&amp;foot to an extent, just like a SERVANT. You are in a WAY are going to go FETCH what I asked for, because thats what you are TRULY DOING, but you just DONT WANT TO ADMIT THAT!

My personal method of tipping is at least $5 per person in my party, more if a big mess is made.

WHY would you CARE if the person had to clean up your mess***********AFTER**************YOU HAD LEFT THE RESTAURANT? Its NOT LIKE YOU ARE BENEFITTING FROM THEM CLEANING UP YOUR MESS. I certainly dont care WHAT THE HECK HAPPENS AFTER I HAVE LEFT. WHY THE HELL TIP MORE FOR SOMETHING I CANNOT POSSIBLY RECEIVE? THATS INSANE!

2. busboy

Do busboys actually DO things for us that BENEFIT US? If they arent benefiting my service in ANY WAY, I dont feel I should consider them in my tip. In restaurants, customers do NOT tip the busboys, they just dont. SERVERS are the ones in most restaurants that TIP-OUT their bussers from the SALES, NOT CUSTOMERS. Cleaning up has NOTHING to do with actual SERVICE you are providing me. Service is getting things I asked for. Its NOT for doing things to PREPARE for me to come into the restaurant or to put away and clean things AFTER I leave. I count SERVICE is what is happening to me at that particular TIME I am there. Whats done before or after I am there is*************NOT*****************SERVICE. It CANNOT POSSIBLY BE.

I will also cook their food as well because a couple of them don&apos;t know how to cook

One thing, you should be telling your manager you are a cook and a server, so that manager can hire a cook that is BETTER than that. Secondly, if you cook the food, thats still under your EMPLOYERS $3.13/hr wage, so its NOT like you dont get paid anything. I DO NOT count that in my tip, nor does ANY SANE PERSON DO as I am pretty much know if you are complaining about how people tip, then you honestly see that most DO NOT care WHO THE HELL COOKS THE FOOD. Normally, people do NOT base their tip on that, EVER, EVER, EVER.

You can bet when he comes in, he doesn&apos;t have to ask to have his coffee cup filled.

You SHOULDNT just REFILL IT WITHOU HIS PERMISSION. Some people at the donut shop I worked at would not want a refill if they still have some coffee, because they just sweetened it just right, with the right amount of creamers, so I would be filling up someone elses coffee with having the coffee pot in my hand, but some people would put their hand over their up, because they didnt want a refill. My point is, you should NEVER just ORDER for your customers. Good service is finding out WHAT the customer would like. Some people didnt mind if they got their coffee refilled with it half-full, others did. Some regulars I had would order coffee at times they came in and sometimes they would order a soft drink like if they wanted to eat there instead of just drink coffee. Ive seen some of my presumptuous co-workers pour a cup of coffee before even they were seated and had to throw the coffee out, which to me was GOOD FOR THEM, because they wanted to order for their customers, which is to me, OVERSTEPPING. I wouldnt order for my customers. Id ALWAYS ASK Coffee, BEFORE I would pour a drop in the cup. If it was a refill, Id ask Would you like some more coffee, which of course not everyone said they did.

I had a man with a $8.80 order, he gave me a $38 tip.

Do you know if it was intentionally done, because some people have tipped me over mistakenly? I am just curious if this person really did this out of just to do it or if you had any doubt it might have been a mistake?

The fact is you are JUST LIKE&quot;realdeal&quot;that&apos;s why. The fact that you purposely underrang soft drinks for your personal gain.

You are just as guilty as SHE is for stealing from restaurants by PURPOSELY UNDERRINGING ITEMS, because I DOUBT either one of y&apos;all actually paid for those items yourself or got your manager&apos;s permission to not ring them up.

 http://www.tipping.org/discus4/messages/9/3484.html 

&quot;I purposely don&apos;t ring in soft drinks from time to time for certain people. And forgetting to ring it in? Soft drinks are the ONLY item in which you could&quot;forget&quot;to ring in, and who cares?&quot;

You MANAGER probably does. Think about all those soft drinks sales the restaurant***COULD***have made, but instead ended up in YOUR HIGHER TIP INSTEAD. If your manager let you or you actually paid for it out of YOUR OWN POCKET, then that&apos;s a DIFFERENT STORY, but to PURPOSELY UNDERRING items without either paying for them yourself or getting permission to do so is a CRIME. It&apos;s NO DIFFERENT than you walking into Wal-Mart grabbing a 20 ounce coke and walking out without paying if you didn&apos;t pay for it or have permission to underring items. WHY do you think&quot;WHO CARES&quot;, because if your manager found out if you did it A LOT, I am willing to bet a million bucks if I had it, he WOULD CARE.

You won&apos;t waste your time reading my stuff, because you know it&apos;s ALL TRUE and you DON&apos;T WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH, because sometimes the truth hurts. You know you are a THIEF!

 See, LOA, if you kept your posts more reasonable like this, you would be much better off.

I CAN not-ring in drinks and certain items, my management would have absolutely no problem with this. If I don&apos;t charge a table of cops for soft drinks, management would praise me. They trust my discretion.

You see, LOA, in your infinite stupidity, what you don&apos;t realize is, giving away freebies, like products that cost 4 cents(soft drinks)- is not a big deal, and it creates a general good-will with guests and makes them want to return. The same way many places give bartenders a certain amount of free drinks they can&quot;buy&quot;for their guests on a given night. It&apos;s customer service.... dummy.

Heck, I&apos;ve even gone up to management and had them give 25% discounts on food to certain tables... for all sorts of reasons, including just being regulars and I thought it would be nice to show our appreciation for it... Again, don&apos;t talk about things you don&apos;t understand, you look like a fool.

I don&apos;t want to read your stuff because I have WAY better things to do than read your psycho babble that, as EVERY SINGLE PERSON has pointed out, you are WRONG.

 lords_of_acid, wtf was that? How long did it take to type all of that?

Yes serving food is the same as working on a car, in the sense you are both providing a service. Yes we all know there are no laws protecting service workers from people like yourself that will not pay for that service.

Yes of course I care about the mess I make getting cleaned up by the person serving me, as I have not had to do it. If I go out to eat, I can just order, have food brought to me, and walk away leaving the mess for someone else. If I stay home and eat, I have to cook it, serve it, and clean it up. So yes I see it as a service for me.

As to the rest of your posts, I don&apos;t have the time or interest to read anymore of your childish posts. Really do you ever get out of the house, or home?

 After thinking about Lord_of_Acids(could name as she is pure acid)it is clear to me that the only job she has ever had is the one in the doughnut shop.

That she expects people that when she eats in or takes out that the workers are meant to care so much about her, but she is allowed to disregard their feelings 100%.

Lord of nothing the people that work as servers aren&apos;t your family, they aren&apos;t your friends, or even your co-workers. It is business. You are there to eat, and they are there to make money.

As to your rants about fast food workers not allowed to keep tips. So you say. When I was younger I worked fast food, and when a customer offered me a couple of dollars because they thought I did an excellant job for them, yes of course I kept it, and never had any manager say a word about it.

As to people that aren&apos;t meant to get tips, I will tip anyone I see fit to tip. I will even give you a tip. Stop being such a self centered know it all, and I think you will be a lot happier in your life in general.

To the OP, stop looking for ways to cheap out. I make $3.13 an hour when I work take out too. Most people tip between $1 and $15 on to go orders. The larger tips coming from the staff of the local bars, who are getting food on their way home from work.

 Well, notipping, you don&apos;t have to work fast food, do you(or do you because you don&apos;t have the skills to orchestrate a guest&apos;s multi-course meal)? You don&apos;t make 3.13 an hour, do you? You don&apos;t spend 20 min. to 2 hours with your customers, do you?

Didn&apos;t think so.

 Holy crap coming out of lords! What kind of post was that and was anyone insane as it to read it?
In my world... yeah I stole pennies for weeks because I am lazy and uncaring... okay but give me a break. It is food!!!!!!!!! You didn&apos;t have to make it, you don&apos;t have to do the dishes, you don&apos;t have to clean up after yourself. You go out to eat, you order take out,(and I realize lords has no idea what the difference is between kfc and Outback is)YOU TIP YOUR TO GO SERVER!!!!!!!!!!!! That is what they are! A server that provides you with everything you need to enjoy your dinner at home.

 Tele - noone on takeout orchestrates a multi-course meal. I call them, someone from the kitchen brings it out, someone rings it up. I&apos;m not giving anyone a tip for standing behind the counter while someone else brings the food out.

Do you Counter Barons tip the guy from the kitchen? I&apos;ve heard about tipping out, but in this case the kitchen guy and the cook did all the work, you just happened to be at the counter.

Coors - Are you foolish? at KFC they put forks and napkins, honey and butter in my bag. Please tell me what they do at Outback to justify giving them and extra 3 or 4 bucks for my meal.

 Holy crap, I word counted that post by lords... 8,191 words... lol.. what a freakin psycho.

The best part is, ALL that time, and people see the post and just go,&quot;eh F@#! that, I&apos;m not reading that damn thing&quot;-- so hardly anyone actually reads it...

and notipping... just yesterday, I spent almost 15 minutes straight putting together a togo order, do me a favor, look at the clock on your computer for 15 minutes... yes, it&apos;s a long time. All togo orders take time to put together, WAY more than any fast food restaurant.

 Holy christ, Ryan. 8,191 words???

That&apos;s longer than my friggin thesis!! I double checked you, just to make sure. It&apos;s over 20 pages, single spaced, when put into MS Word.

BTW, notipping is beginning to sound a lot like Lords, when they said,&quot; at KFC they put forks and napkins, honey and butter in my bag.&quot; I don&apos;t know many other people that take an inventory of fast food condiments.

 &quot;Tele - noone on takeout orchestrates a multi-course meal&quot;.

They certainly did at my previous restaurant, PF Chang&apos;s. Most people would order dumplings, salads, soup, dessert, etc in addition to their entree. These would have to come off of different lines at different times and be coordinated with the other 8 current to-go orders that were pending. And since most of these were for 2 to 4 people, and had be taken telephonically with a certain pickup time given, all during the time that the kitchen was dealing with the lunch or dinner rush, it was far more complicated than running a counter at In and Out or doing the takeout window at such a restaurant(I&quot;m sure that it iasn&apos;t easy there either, but you&apos;re not making 2.13 or 3.13 an hour either).

Let&apos;s put it this wa, a typical dinner to-go shift would be ringing up $1500 - 2000 from around 60 different phone-in guests(in the span of about 3 hours). That&apos;s about 20 to-go meals an hour on average, meals that can cost anywhere from $20 to $100.

About once a week, we&apos;d have a $200-plus order. An order like that would take 30 minutes just to pack up and would fill 5 to 7 full-sized brown paper grocery bags.

You can&apos;t compare fast food takeout with restaurant take out. There&apos;s just no comparison.

I&apos;ll say this, if fast food is all you know, then tipping might seem weird. But when you grow up and start dining out(or working)in real restaurants, you&apos;ll soon get why tipping is part of the system here in America.

 notipping, and at a restaurant you freaquent like wendys, it&apos;IS that easy... However, at a normal sit-down style restaurant, it doesn&apos;t work that way.

I had to get salads together, package salad dressings, get the food expo&apos;d from the cooks, box it and bag it, they even had freakin desserts, so I had to get boxes and line them, get containers for the ice cream, the fudge, the caramel, pour each one, box and bag the whole damn thing, all sorts of crap... at mcdonalds, it the food comes in a box, stick it in bag, hand it out... much different than a normal restaurant.

teleburst, most fast food restaurants do $3000 - $4000 all day, let alone in 3 hours...

These people will never get it though, they don&apos;t want to. You just can&apos;t convince someone of something they refuse to be convinced of, you just have to accept that they are willfully ignorant... or literally stupid.

 notipping,
What teleburst said...

I&apos;ll give you a couple reasons, service is not covered in the price of the food at Outback, it IS covered at Wendys. You are paying less for the item due to the fact that tipping is customary. So for that reason alone you should tip.

The server would also have to make the trip to the kitchen, expo the food, box it, get the fries, any sides/condiments you may need(probably not in packets), bring it up to the front, usually they bag it nicely and staple the receipt on it, take payment, usually run it out to your car too... Any other questions?

notipping, I HAVE worked take-out in my day, and I&apos;ve also worked for a couple years at a McDonalds, I can tell you, it&apos;s WAY more work at a restaurant doing togo&apos;s than it is in fast food...

In fast food, cook puts boxed/wrapped sandwhich up, throw it in bag, throw fries in too, hand to customer. And sometimes take payment as well. Usually the fast food restaurants are designed where you have one single person taking payment, one doing fries, one to grab the food and bag it, and one to make the drink and hand it out... it&apos;s NOT the same thing as a single person going through all the b.s. thats involved doing togo&apos;s at a restaurant, it&apos;s just not even close, I&apos;ve done it, I&apos;m telling you.

If you refuse to accept it, you are just being willfully ignorant of the facts, and I&apos;d like to think you are smarter than that.

 You meant to say walk to the kitchen, put food in a box and bring it to the front?

Also added on your list of tasks,&quot;Making a trip to the kitchen&quot;, and did you add staple the reciept and&quot;bad it nicely&quot;as something a server does?

Doesn&apos;t the server also tie her shoes? Doesn&apos;t she give me a smile and a wink? Why didn&apos;t you list that among the things I should pay for?

Next time you walk into a holiday store and ask for an item that isn&apos;t out front, I want you to tip your clerk. She will&quot;make a trip&quot;to the back, bring out your item, fold it, wrap it in a gift box, provide you with TWO receipts and say thanks for shopping with us.

 I can understand why people that do that actual carryout would like to be tipped. After all, who wouldn&apos;t like to be paid more money? I am not about to comment about how easy or hard it is to do carryout compared with McDonalds or actually waiting on tables. I assume that the people that actual do that work know more about how difficult it is than I do. I have read that some people that do carryout are forced to tip out to others because it is assumed that they are tipped. I have read that servers are still paid the same low payrate to do carryout as they are when they wait on tables(or at least that this sometimes happens). I understand all of that, but I still will not tip on takeout.

The bottom line to me is that I tip because of the service I receive that has hopefully made my dining experience more enjoyable. When I order takeout, that service is someone handing me a bag. Or, I should say, the service that I directly experience is someone handing me a bag. That does not mean that a lot of work may not have went into getting that bag ready for me - I know it didn&apos;t happen magically. But no one can say that I would have received the same kind of personal service I would have if I were dining in the restaurant. That service is what I tip for.

Nobody is saying that you receive&quot;the same kind of personal service&quot;that you would receive if you were dining in. However, you&apos;re paying someone to provide you with the same food that you would receive tableside and do it in a timely and efficient manner. You aren&apos;t buying a $2.00 burger, an order of fries and a coke. You aren&apos;t calling McDonald&apos;s and giving them your unique and special order to be assembled and handed to you at a specific time and done accurately with all special requests taken care of. The only difference is that you aren&apos;t personally taking up two hours of the server&apos;s time, which is why we say that you shouldn&apos;t have to tip at the same level. However, that server/servers is/are taking care of twice to four times as many people as they would be taking care of if they have a section and they have to juggle your order with many other orders.

Think of it this way - the restaurant is giving you a different sort of service of their fine product but it still is personal service. This isn&apos;t walking up to a counter, giving an order and having it delivered to you in 2 minutes. This allows you to benefit from flex time in that you don&apos;t have to wait the 20 - 40 minutes that it would take to cook, assemble and charge you for it and you can spend that 20 - 40 minutes doing laundry or running errands or simply driving to the restaurant to have your to-go order handed to you complete with all courses.

Did the fact that you could enjoy the same dinner at home in front of the TV that you would have had to spend in a restaurant waiting 45 minutes for your table and then taking 2 hours of table dining out of your life making your&quot;dining experience more enjoyable&quot;? I&apos;d suggest that if that&apos;s the choice you made on that occasion, the to-go facilitators DID make it more enjoyable.

Adjust your tip according? Sure. But don&apos;t tip? That&apos;s just miserly. The more people that do that, the more of a chance that you will end up paying a to-go surcharge or higher prices, or removal of the service because that labor has to paid for somehow. The in-restaurant diners shouldn&apos;t subsidize your dining experience.

I hope this makes sense.

&quot;You aren&apos;t calling McDonald&apos;s and giving them your unique and special order to be assembled and handed to you at a specific time and done accurately with all special requests taken care of.&quot;

Calling in an order and placing it&quot;IN PERSON&quot;is NO DIFFERENT. You can*CHOOSE*to write it down or if the phone is right by the register, put the order in as you are on the phone.

Also, you CAN call ahead for 100 pieces of chicken for instance at Popeyes.

As far as special orders go, I ALWAYS customize my orders. I ALWAYS ask for either mayo and mustard in a cup, or tartar sauce in a cup. I also get my burger with lettuce, mayo, and onions only. That, to me, is a&quot;SPECIAL ORDER.&quot;It&apos;s NOT&quot;AS IS.&quot;Also, what do you call Burger King&apos;s moto&quot;Have it your way?&quot;That&apos;s&quot;SPECIAL ORDERS&quot;as well.

&quot;The only difference is that you aren&apos;t personally taking up two hours of the server&apos;s time,&quot;

Normally, we don&apos;t even dine that long. Sometimes an hour around, NOT no 2 hours unless I am with a large party.

&quot;However, that server/servers is/are taking care of twice to four times as many people as they would be taking care of if they have a section and they have to juggle your order with many other orders.&quot;

This concept has absolutely******NOTHING*******at ALL to do with the&quot;AMOUNT OF SERVICE&quot;the to-go server is providing the customer. WHO GIVES A CARE WHAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE YOU ARE SERVING AT ONCE? NOBODY CARES ABOUT THAT IF MCDONALD&apos;S IS EXTREMELY BUSY. This is STUPID to say this has ANYTHING to do with&quot;SERVICE.&quot;

&quot;This isn&apos;t walking up to a counter, giving an order and having it delivered to you in 2 minutes.&quot;

Not in 2 minutes maybe, but people CAN walk to the counter to place their order instead of calling. If someone delivers it to the counter, that&apos;s COUNTER SERVICE just like McDonald&apos;s. If they deliver it to my car, then that&apos;s a&quot;SERVICE&quot;that goes BEYOND McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, and Burger King do, therefore a tip should be given, which should be 10% at the most since it isn&apos;t full table service.

&quot;This allows you to benefit from flex time in that you don&apos;t have to wait the 20 - 40 minutes that it would take to cook, assemble and charge you for it and you can spend that 20 - 40 minutes doing laundry or running errands or simply driving to the restaurant to have your to-go order handed to you complete with all courses.&quot;

All of this is**************IRRELEVANT*************to the***AMOUNT OF WORK***a to-go server provides. WHO CARES if it benefits me for time. That&apos;s the*********COOKS**********THAT ARE DOING THAT DUMMY! I don&apos;t see the to-go server&quot;COOKING&quot;my burger and fries, NOW DO I?

&quot;Did the fact that you could enjoy the same dinner at home in front of the TV that you would have had to spend in a restaurant waiting 45 minutes for your table and then taking 2 hours of table dining out of your life making your&quot;dining experience more enjoyable&quot;?&quot;

That&apos;s still the***********COOK&apos;S*************THAT ARE BENEFITTING ME, which DO NOT RECEIVE THE TIP! THIS IS SOOOOOO***IRRELEVANT***TO THE ACTUAL&quot;SERVICE&quot;THAT IS PROVIDED BY A TO-GO SERVER THAT A CUSTOMER PICKS UP THEIR FOOD AT THE COUNTER.

&quot;The more people that do that, the more of a chance that you will end up paying a to-go surcharge or higher prices, or removal of the service because that labor has to paid for somehow.&quot;

I&apos;d rather pay a surcharge than pay someone to do fast food cashier work(excluding Sonic due to them actually BRINGING food to vehicles).

Also, it makes NO SENSE worrying about something that might or might not happen. If removal of the service happens, so be it. Those people can easily get seated, get drinks to-go and after they receive their entrees, bring it home, so they can STILL get take-out in a sense anyways. Restaurants will still have to-go boxes for people dining in.

The COOK is really the person making the to-go customer BENEFIT from not cooking. I refuse to treat employees unfairly. If I cannot tip that McDonald&apos;s CASHIER to bag my food, give me utensils, give me syrups and butters for my hotcakes, give me jelly for my sausage, ring me up, and give me change, I will NOT tip a to-go server to do the SAME or LESS****************AMOUNT OF WORK******************!

The benefits of a to-go order have absolutely NOTHING at all to do with the service being provided. The COOKS are the ones that are making a to-go customer benefit.

I agree. I am paying some one to provide me with the same food(well, more or less). I am paying the restaurant.

Teleburst says:

I don&apos;t see how that matters. Of course I&apos;m not buying a cheap hamburger. That is why the food costs more. I am already paying that premium to get a better quality of food. Besides that, I assure you because I have done it that you will get what you ask for if you go to McDonalds and ask for a Quarter Pounder with Cheese - hold the pickles.

Teleburst says:
&quot;The only difference is that you aren&apos;t personally taking up two hours of the server&apos;s time, which is why we say that you shouldn&apos;t have to tip at the same level.&quot;

That is why I feel I shouldn&apos;t have to tip at all. That difference is in one case I am receiving a service that I feel deserves a tip, in the other case I don&apos;t.

Teleburst says:
&quot;However, that server/servers is/are taking care of twice to four times as many people as they would be taking care of if they have a section and they have to juggle your order with many other orders.&quot;

I am not saying that doing carry out is not difficult work. But a lot of people do difficult work that don&apos;t get tipped. You tip a server because of the personal service you have received - not because of how easy or difficult it was for that person to do their job.

Teleburst says:
&quot;Think of it this way - the restaurant is giving you a different sort of service of their fine product but it still is personal service. This isn&apos;t walking up to a counter, giving an order and having it delivered to you in 2 minutes.&quot;

From the customer point of view, the only differences are that I call my order in instead of going through the drive-thru and that my order will cost more and hopefully taste better. Someone handing me a bag and taking my money(notice the similarity to McDonalds?)- is not personal service.

Teleburst says:
&quot;This allows you to benefit from flex time in that you don&apos;t have to wait the 20 - 40 minutes that it would take to cook, assemble and charge you for it and you can spend that 20 - 40 minutes doing laundry or running errands or simply driving to the restaurant to have your to-go order handed to you complete with all courses.&quot;

I agree that saving time is a reason why you would want to do this. I don&apos;t see how this makes a difference in whether or not the service warrants a tip. Whether I am doing errands or standing quietly in a corner waiting for my order to completed doesn&apos;t change what work has to occur.

Teleburst says:
&quot;Did the fact that you could enjoy the same dinner at home in front of the TV that you would have had to spend in a restaurant waiting 45 minutes for your table and then taking 2 hours of table dining out of your life making your&quot;dining experience more enjoyable&quot;? I&apos;d suggest that if that&apos;s the choice you made on that occasion, the to-go facilitators DID make it more enjoyable.&quot;

Using that logic I should tip my cable company because I enjoyed a show on TV.&quot;Great episode of Heroes - have a dollar&quot;. After all, I didn&apos;t have to stand in line for a movie ticket or sit through the commercials and previews.

Yes the restaurant provided me with a product that I hopefully am going to enjoy. In return, I paid for that product. I did not receive the personal service that I would have at a restaurant, and therefore I didn&apos;t pay(aka tip)for that service.

Teleburst says:
&quot;Adjust your tip according? Sure. But don&apos;t tip? That&apos;s just miserly. The more people that do that, the more of a chance that you will end up paying a to-go surcharge or higher prices, or removal of the service because that labor has to paid for somehow. The in-restaurant diners shouldn&apos;t subsidize your dining experience.&quot;


I don&apos;t see refusing to pay for something I didn&apos;t receive as&quot;miserly&quot;. If the restaurant wants to add a charge or stop offering the service - that is their option.

I don&apos;t blame people that do carry-out from wanting to be paid fairly for what they do. I get paid a fair wage - why shouldn&apos;t they? But I am not going to pretend that I receive a service that I should be tipping for when I am not.

&quot;Using that logic I should tip my cable company because I enjoyed a show on TV.&quot;Great episode of Heroes - have a dollar&quot;. After all, I didn&apos;t have to stand in line for a movie ticket or sit through the commercials and previews.&quot;

THANK YOU KELLY! That is SOOOO TRUE!

&quot;I agree that saving time is a reason why you would want to do this. I don&apos;t see how this makes a difference in whether or not the service warrants a tip. Whether I am doing errands or standing quietly in a corner waiting for my order to completed doesn&apos;t change what work has to occur.&quot;

This is SOOOO TRUE! Just as I stated, the&quot;AMOUNT OF SERVICE&quot;has NOTHING to do with saving time as well as it&apos;s truly the&quot;COOKS&quot;that are doing the MAJORITY of the work to save a lot of time. If anything, if I tipped someone in that situation, it should be the COOKS. I don&apos;t care how much they make an hour. Since we all can&apos;t tip cooks in any situation, all we can do as customers is treat ALL employees that do this type of work(counter service)&quot;FAIRLY&quot;by not tipping. If I can&apos;t tip someone at McDonald&apos;s for doing the same or less amount of work, I am for sure not going to tip a Chili&apos;s to-go server that I go inside to pick it up at the&quot;COUNTER&quot;, which is exactly like what you&apos;d do at McDonald&apos;s.

&quot;I get paid a fair wage - why shouldn&apos;t they?&quot;

This situation to me should be blamed on their&quot;EMPLOYER&quot;and it not be the CUSTOMER&apos;S job to have to pay the rest of the wages. Also, SOME places DO have to-go servers making at least minimum wage. I have read that online, so it&apos;s not every employer that decides to pay only $2.13/hr for to-go servers.

I feel if you actually&quot;BRING&quot;me my food to my car, whether it would be in the hot sun, rain, etc., to me that&apos;s&quot;SERVICE&quot;to tip SOMETHING for unless things go wrong. So car-side-to-go in my opinion should be tipped at least 10% ONLY if the food is correct and they charge me correctly. To me, if ONE thing is OBVIOUSLY missing or wrong or they charge you incorrectly, ZERO is what they will get. HOW HARD is it to&quot;CHECK THE BAG&quot;BEFORE LEAVING THE RESTAURANT? I have NEVER gotten car-side-to-go before, but if I would, the food would have to be correct and I would have to get charged correctly to tip just as I have tipped at Sonic Drive-in.

Kelly, do you feel when the to-go server&quot;DELIVERS&quot;your food to your car, that you should tip if every thing goes well at least SOMETHING, even if it&apos;s just a dollar? I am just curious how you feel about the extra work of going outside to bring someone&apos;s food to their car, going back in to ring up their credit card or cash, then going back to give them their credit card&amp;receipt or their change. I feel that&apos;s more work than McDonald&apos;s counter service, therefore, I feel SOME type of tip should be given if every thing goes well, especially if they had to walk in the pouring rain or the extreme heat or cold weather.

 You keep denying that you are receiving a personal service. Comparing this with cable TV is just silly.

I&apos;m just wondering how you would feel if you were bumped to the end of the line and you would only be served after people who tipped were served or told, if you don&apos;t tip, we can&apos;t tell you when your food will be ready - just show up and we&apos;ll serve you after the people who are paying for the service are served. Would this be&quot;fair&quot;to you? After all, you are&quot;only paying for the food&quot;, right?

I really hope that more people will become like you. That way, perhaps restaurants will drop this to-go insanity and go back to preserving the integrity of their concept.

Finally, I&apos;m glad that you have happy letting others subsidize your service(yes, this is a&quot;service&quot;by any definition of the word).

THANK YOU KELLY! That is SOOOO TRUE&quot;!

What&apos;s true? That she should tip? Sorry, but she already is. She&apos;s paying anywhere from $400 to $1000 a year for this privilege. She also directly or indirectly paid someone either $15 - 25 an hour to install it.

&quot;I&apos;m just wondering how you would feel if you were bumped to the end of the line and you would only be served after people who tipped were served or told, if you don&apos;t tip, we can&apos;t tell you when your food will be ready - just show up and we&apos;ll serve you after the people who are paying for the service are served. Would this be&quot;fair&quot;to you? After all, you are&quot;only paying for the food&quot;, right?&quot;

It&apos;s&quot;NOT&quot;fair because in*ANY*type of&quot;LINE&quot;situation EVERYWHERE ELSE such as a grocery store or ticket booth, you don&apos;t tip, except for hospitals where it goes by emergency and not first come, first served, because lives are at stake.

The fact is, you cannot be&quot;PREJUDICED&quot;when you serve***ANYWHERE***except for hospitals or any place that lives are at stake. I don&apos;t see Quizno&apos;s or Subway workers decide(you don&apos;t tip, so your order will be in the back of the line), so WHY would a to-go server treat a customer ANY DIFFERENTLY than EVERYWHERE else except hospitals? If I am in a line at the Wal-Mart, that don&apos;t serve people that tip at all. WHY would I tip for a service that is the&quot;EXACT SAME&quot;or even&quot;LESS SERVICE&quot;than a McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, or Burger King****CASHIER*****DOES? The COOKS are the people that are benefitting me the most, NOT the to-go servers.

&quot;That way, perhaps restaurants will drop this to-go insanity and go back to preserving the integrity of their concept.&quot;

It couldn&apos;t stop a to-go order. People can just order waters or not any drinks and just place orders for entrees. Then ask for a box to put the food in. NO ONE would be making the customers actually&quot;EAT&quot;at the restaurant. The people would just be waiting at the table instead of the lobby in the to-go area or partly at home. There&apos;s usually ALWAYS WAYS AROUND things. I usually find A LOT of loop holes in situations.

&quot;What&apos;s true? That she should tip? Sorry, but she already is. She&apos;s paying anywhere from $400 to $1000 a year for this privilege. She also directly or indirectly paid someone either $15 - 25 an hour to install it.&quot;

NO, she&apos;s NOT&quot;TIPPING&quot;, because that would be************OPTIONAL***********BY LAW AS LONG AS THE AUTOMATIC GRATUITY WAS NOT ADDED just like when you are in a large party or using a coupon that requires if you use the coupon, that automatic gratuity will be added. So in other words,********BY LAW**********she is REQUIRED to pay that amount, which tipping is******************NOT REQUIRED BY LAW***********, DUH! SHE IS****NOT*****TIPPING! Actually&quot;TIPPING&quot;the cable employee would be to give him or her extra money***BEYOND***what is REQUIRED BY LAW!

&quot;Finally, I&apos;m glad that you have happy letting others subsidize your service(yes, this is a&quot;service&quot;by any definition of the word).&quot;

Other people aren&apos;t&quot;subsidizing&quot;anything for me. The customers that are tipping the to-go server for counter service are making a***CHOICE***to do so. Customers that aren&apos;t tipping to-go servers can&apos;t control those people, therefore, we aren&apos;t&quot;LETTING THEM&quot;pay to get to-go service, because they will tip anyways regardless of the people that don&apos;t tip for counter service to-go orders. They aren&apos;t&quot;subsidizing&quot;my service, because we don&apos;t get to tip other people at McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s, or Burger King to do the same or less amount of work. If the employer wants to get rid of take-out orders, so be it. As I said, there are ways around a lot of things in life. Just as at the store they have limits, but normally the managers don&apos;t stop someone from buying more beyond the limit. I&apos;ve already went to a store and made 2 separate orders and they let me even though there was a limit quite a NUMBER of times over the years. Same thing here, that you can get a to-go order at the table by placing an order inside and when the food is delivered immediately get a to-go box. The difference here is, since the server would be delivering it to my table, taking my order at the table, walk further to take my credit card to ring it up and bring me my change, I&apos;d have to tip 10% at least, because it&apos;s SOME table service to an extent UNLESS the order was obviously incorrect OF COURSE or the server messed up being forgetting to put an order into the computer or overcharging me.

&quot;Can you not find even ONE difference?&quot;

If you compare burger orders for instance, you&apos;d have to press the how to cook the burger&quot;medium well&quot;, etc. The thing is though, that&apos;s ONE button more, but normally people that get to-go orders from non-fast food restaurants, especially at night, DO NOT order drinks, which MOST fast food places, people normally order the&quot;COMBO&quot;of their choice that COMES with a drink in MOST cases. I didn&apos;t say all, but in MOST cases. I can&apos;t say for to-go orders at lunch time for people ordering at work that they wouldn&apos;t order a drink, but sometimes they may just get a coke out of the machine or drink water or bring their own can of coke. My point is, if these cashiers have to get a drink with ice in a cup, that&apos;s more work than pressing that extra button. My point is, you are replacing one extra action for another action that is done.

I also don&apos;t feel pressing an extra button requires much of ANY real effort or hard work to base a tip on. That extra button pressing is just like if I chose to get my burger the way it comes vs. another customer getting theirs without ketchup and pickles. The other customer made the order taker do more button pressing than I did in that situation.

Writing it down may be a difference IF one**CHOOSES**to if the phone is not near the register. If the phone is near a register, there&apos;s no TRUE REASON to write it down, because you can simply put it in as it&apos;s being told just like counter service is normally done in person. Some people have good enough memories to remember things without writing them down. It&apos;s rare, but there are people that have good memories.

In all these situations, I am ONLY talking about&quot;counter service&quot;, NOT car-side-to-go type of service.

One difference let&apos;s say in comparing an Applebee&apos;s one pasta dish order vs. that hotcakes and sausage order I described in other posts, is that the hotcakes&amp;sausage order is***MORE***work for that McDonald&apos;s cashier than for that Applebee&apos;s employee to only simply put the pasta in the box, put the box into the bag, put the all-in-one fork/knife/napkin/salt-n-pepper plasitic packet, put the order into the computer, ring it up with the money or credit card, and give the change or credit card receipt back. The cashier at McDonald&apos;s had to put my hotcakes and sausage in the bag, get 2 butters out of a box, get two or one syrup out a box, get a fork&amp;knife out different boxes, put my order into the computer, ring me up with the method of payment and give me change or my credit card back. In this situation, the McDonald&apos;s cashier did MORE WORK than the Applebee&apos;s employee did. Especially due to the all-in-one bag not to have to hunt down utensils in separate boxes or even having to deal with any condiments of any type. So honestly, WHY do you feel a tip is deserved for that Applebee&apos;s to-go server for doing********LESS*********WORK comparing those 2 situations? If they gave me&quot;LESS&quot;service, then WHY tip someone to do&quot;LESS WORK&quot;than the McDonald&apos;s cashier did considering we don&apos;t get to tip the McDonald&apos;s cashier even for MORE service?

Why is it silly? In both cases I have paid a company to provide me a product. In the case of the cable TV company, that product is a TV show or movie. In the case of the restaurant, it is a meal. In both cases, I am enjoying something at home that I could also be purchasing somewhere else - a movie theatre or actually in the restaurant. In neither case have I received personal, one-on-one attention from someone that I would say deserves a tip.

No, I wouldn&apos;t consider this right or fair. To me this would be like being told I was bumped to end of the theatre line becomes I refused to bribe the ticket-taker. In both cases I am willing to bet the management of the company would side with me. But you are the server, so you tell me - how would the restaurant you work in react if you told a customer the above?

Teleburst says:

I would have no problem with restaurants saying on principal that they refuse to do food to go because it simply doesn&apos;t taste the way it would in the restaurant. I rarely get meals to go from non-fast food places. I prefer to dine in and enjoy my meal the way it was supposed to be eaten. However there are times when a busy schedule forces me to compromise quality for the sake of time.

Teleburst says:

I am very happy doing this. I would have to say that your claim that someone packaging and bagging my to-go meal is a&quot;service&quot;by any definition of the word is not correct. To start with the one definition of the word service:&quot;the act of a male animal copulating with a female animal&quot;- well, I certainly hope it has nothing to do with bagging my meal.

Okay, so that really doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the real topic - I couldn&apos;t resist the joke.

I don&apos;t argue that the person who bags the to-go meal is performing a useful function, or that if that person didn&apos;t exist that I would still be able to get carry-out. I do argue that the service I personally receive is not something I should have to tip for.

Oh my god, I know people like you. You&apos;re that jerk who stands at a sold-out hotel who says&quot;I KNOW there is someone who hasn&apos;t checked in yet! That room is empty, I&apos;m here, and they&apos;re not. Give me their room!&quot;

Or,&quot;I want that big table. It&apos;s empty. Why can&apos;t I have it?&quot;

Summary: you&apos;re a cheapskate jerk. But we already knew that...

NO, tipping 25% and higher is**NOT**a&quot;cheapskate&quot;, which that is what we tip for EXCELLENT SERVICE. Secondly, what&apos;s wrong with finding the&quot;BEST DEAL&quot;you can find? WHY NOT BE**SMART**to SAVE MONEY WHEN YOU CAN? A dollar here, another 50 cents there, it amounts.

Hey, you accidentally discovered a difference between McDonald&apos;s and take-out in a full service restaurant. You should feel proud.

But that wasn&apos;t my point. Kelly thinks she&apos;s&quot;only paying for the food&quot;. Therefore, she shouldn&apos;t think it was unfair if tippers went to the front of the line(if there were a line, of course). She&apos;s not paying for anything other than a bag of food, but if someone wants to pay more for the privilege of going to the head of the line, then fair is fair, right? BTW, can you think of a real world example where this has started happening all of the time(but not in a restaurant)?

You totally missed my point.

You claimed that you were&quot;only paying for the food&quot;. Therefore, you have abrogated your right to care about HOW you get your food. I&apos;m just using*your*standard. Part of the service is assuring the each to-go guest gets their food in a&quot;fair&quot;fashion after all.

&quot;Teleburst says:

You can&apos;t compare the&quot;products&quot;, that&apos;s why.

In both cases, I am enjoying something at home that I could also be purchasing somewhere else - a movie theatre or actually in the restaurant.

Did you have to call them up to get that movie or that show? Did they have to assemble your programming basically&quot;from scratch&quot;? I didn&apos;t think so.

Ahhh, so you ARE receiving personal service when you call up and have someone who could be serving you in the restaurant take time away from their tipping guests and answer your phone call, take your special requests, negotiate with the kitchen to get your food served up packaged in to-go containers, assemble the potentially multi-course meal accurately and with all necessary side items, bag the items up(while handling 8 other similarly&quot;time-challenged&quot;guests), taking your payment and sending you on your way, all for between 2.13 and $7 an hour. Tell me something - if you were a server in that restaurant, would you want to lose 8 hours of your life for that amount of money if people weren&apos;t tipping you SOMETHING? Wouldn&apos;t you just quit? And who&apos;s paying for your free ride?

&quot;Teleburst says:
&quot;However, that server/servers is/are taking care of twice to four times as many people as they would be taking care of if they have a section and they have to juggle your order with many other orders.&quot;

I am not saying that doing carry out is not difficult work. But a lot of people do difficult work that don&apos;t get tipped&quot;.

BUT THEY DON&apos;T GET PAID 2.13 AN HOUR FOR IT. You can&apos;t use the&quot;other people do it&quot;argument. Well you can, but it comes off pretty lame.

&quot;Teleburst says:
&quot;Finally, I&apos;m glad that you have happy letting others subsidize your service(yes, this is a&quot;service&quot;by any definition of the word).&quot;

I am very happy doing this. I would have to say that your claim that someone packaging and bagging my to-go meal is a&quot;service&quot;by any definition of the word is not correct&quot;.

And I say that you are incorrect. You&apos;ve left out the fact that they took your order over the phone and checked you out, for starters. You gloss over the fact that they ARE providing a service for you and that others are subsidizing your ability to get away with not compensating the restaurant staff for their kindness in providing you an alternative to spending two hours in their restaurant. The amazing thing is that we&apos;re talking about $1 - $5 dollars and that you&apos;re too cheap to consider paying that amount to the very people who are providing you with the service that you have become accustomed to. Talk about your&quot;entitlement issues&quot;.

I just wish you and lord of acid got to spend one night with a PF Chang&apos;s to-go person or persons. You&apos;d change your tune in a heartbeat, especially if you were forced to do their job. I guarantee it. I KNOW that lords has never done a tenth of what those people have to do in a 4 hour period, even in a week of doing donut shop counter work.

Actually, she hasn&apos;t discovered a difference between how things*actually*work at a full service restaurant and McDonalds. The difference only exists in the&quot;tippers go to the front of the line&quot;restaurant that I don&apos;t believe actually exists.

Teleburst:

I am only paying for the food, though obviously that food needs to be packaged in way that allows me to get it home. Just like groceries are put in bags or popcorn is served in tubs. The packaging is part of what you are paying for when you buy the product. I don&apos;t see how you get to the idea that I should be okay of someone jumping ahead in line because they are bribing someone. I did notice that you never answered my question on what the manager of the restaurant you work at would say if you told a customer&quot;tip or go to the back of the line&quot;. It&apos;s been my experience if you aren&apos;t willing to do something openly before your boss and customers, then you probably shouldn&apos;t be doing it at all.

But to answer your question - yes there are times when people that pay different amounts are treated differently. First-class flyers board before other people, is one example. The difference being is that they are being offered different services by the airline, not by individual employees of the company. I can get you examples of when different services/access are offered to people once they have given money to an individual, but that is called bribery and is usually considered a felony.

Oh really? You don&apos;t stand in line at McDonald&apos;s to order and receive your food? McDonald&apos;s isn&apos;t line counter service where your food is pretty much handed to you between a minute and three minutes from the time you order it?

You missed my whole point about the jumping to the head of the line thing. I&apos;m not saying that jumping to the head of the line*actually*exists. I&apos;m saying that if it did, you couldn&apos;t get upset about it because you aren&apos;t paying for a&quot;service&quot;, you are simply transacting for some food in a bag.

BTW, you can now jump to the front to the line at amusement parks by paying extra. Maybe we could call that a tip and then use that as a way to ensure that people who tip in restaurant to-go situations get the preferential treatment that they deserve for doing the right thing in the first place. We could call them&quot;zoom passes&quot;or something and people would pay 10% of the price of the food and get served before people who don&apos;t think that they&apos;re getting service worth paying for anyway. Sounds like a great idea to me. Heck, there&apos;s no way you can complain about this because you haven&apos;t purchased a promise to be&quot;served&quot;; at least YOU don&apos;t think so.

 &quot;Telenburst says:
&quot;I&apos;m just wondering how you would feel if you were bumped to the end of the line and you would only be served after people who tipped were served or told, if you don&apos;t tip, we can&apos;t tell you when your food will be ready - just show up and we&apos;ll serve you after the people who are paying for the service are served. Would this be&quot;fair&quot;to you? After all, you are&quot;only paying for the food&quot;, right?&quot;

Kelly:
&quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t consider this right or fair. To me this would be like being told I was bumped to end of the theatre line becomes I refused to bribe the ticket-taker. In both cases I am willing to bet the management of the company would side with me. But you are the server, so you tell me - how would the restaurant you work in react if you told a customer the above&quot;?&quot;

Teleburst:
&quot;You totally missed my point.

You claimed that you were&quot;only paying for the food&quot;. Therefore, you have abrogated your right to care about HOW you get your food. I&apos;m just using*your*standard. Part of the service is assuring the each to-go guest gets their food in a&quot;fair&quot;fashion after all.&quot;

Kelly:

No, I have not given up the right to care about how I get my food. When I buy a dozen eggs at the grocery store, I get a carton. Even though I say I am buying eggs, everyone knows that the packaging is part of the product. To keep with the grocery store example, even though I am paying for the food(and their packages, I guess I have to add), I would not tolerate being told by a cashier&quot;unless you pay me 10% of your bill, you can&apos;t go through my register.&quot;Would you?

&quot;Teleburst says:

&quot;You keep denying that you are receiving a personal service. Comparing this with cable TV is just silly.&quot;

Kelly:
&quot;Why is it silly? In both cases I have paid a company to provide me a product&quot;.

Teleburst:
&quot;You can&apos;t compare the&quot;products&quot;, that&apos;s why.&quot;

Kelly:
Why can&apos;t I? Obviously there are lot of differences between a dinner and a movie, but both are products that a company is offering.

Kelly:
&quot;In the case of the cable TV company, that product is a TV show or movie. In the case of the restaurant, it is a meal. In both cases, I am enjoying something at home that I could also be purchasing somewhere else - a movie theatre or actually in the restaurant. In neither case have I received personal, one-on-one attention from someone that I would say deserves a tip&quot;.

Teleburst:
&quot;Did you have to call them up to get that movie or that show? Did they have to assemble your programming basically&quot;from scratch&quot;? I didn&apos;t think so.&quot;

Kelly:
Well, there are movies-on-demand. But no, they didn&apos;t prepare my movie from scratch. I think that would be a cool idea though. However, I don&apos;t see how that really matters. I am already paying for the cooks to prepare the food - aka, assemble it from scratch. I am not arguing that I shouldn&apos;t have to pay for the food. I am saying that I shouldn&apos;t have to pay for personal service that I am not receiving.

&quot;Teleburst says:
&quot;I really hope that more people will become like you. That way, perhaps restaurants will drop this to-go insanity and go back to preserving the integrity of their concept.&quot;

Kelly:
&quot;I would have no problem with restaurants saying on principal that they refuse to do food to go because it simply doesn&apos;t taste the way it would in the restaurant. I rarely get meals to go from non-fast food places. I prefer to dine in and enjoy my meal the way it was supposed to be eaten. However there are times when a busy schedule forces me to compromise quality for the sake of time&quot;.

Ahhh, so you ARE receiving personal service when you call up and have someone who could be serving you in the restaurant take time away from their tipping guests and answer your phone call, take your special requests, negotiate with the kitchen to get your food served up packaged in to-go containers, assemble the potentially multi-course meal accurately and with all necessary side items, bag the items up(while handling 8 other similarly&quot;time-challenged&quot;guests), taking your payment and sending you on your way, all for between 2.13 and $7 an hour.&quot;

Wow. That is one extremely long sentence, but I don&apos;t see how you got any of it from what I posted right above it. Yes, I will grant you that getting carry-out can save me time, which is why I might want to do it occasionally. And of course someone actually has to bag up the meal and take my money. I am not going to comment on how easy or hard a job that might be, or all the details that might be involved in it. As I have said before, I don&apos;t do the job so I don&apos;t know the ins and outs of it. What I do know is what I experience as a customer, and that does not include any personal one-on-one attention that I would typically be tipping someone for. I wouldn&apos;t pay for HBO from a cable company if I didn&apos;t actually get HBO, and I will not pay/tip for personal service if I don&apos;t receive it.

Teleburst:
&quot;Tell me something - if you were a server in that restaurant, would you want to lose 8 hours of your life for that amount of money if people weren&apos;t tipping you SOMETHING? Wouldn&apos;t you just quit? And who&apos;s paying for your free ride?&quot;

Kelly:
No, I wouldn&apos;t want to have a low paying job. I understand that a server would be making more money if they were actually waiting on tables and delivering that personal service that people tip for. But it doesn&apos;t change the fact that they are not. I understand that people feel it is unfair that they are being paid a low wage as a server because the expectation is that they will be earning tips, but then they are assigned a job where they aren&apos;t earning tips. To be honest, it really isn&apos;t fair. But it also isn&apos;t fair to expect people to pay for something they didn&apos;t receive. To put it bluntly: yes, your boss is being unfair to you, but that doesn&apos;t give you the right to be unfair to me.

&quot;Teleburst says:
&quot;However, that server/servers is/are taking care of twice to four times as many people as they would be taking care of if they have a section and they have to juggle your order with many other orders.&quot;

Kelly:
I am not saying that doing carry out is not difficult work. But a lot of people do difficult work that don&apos;t get tipped&quot;.

Teleburst:
BUT THEY DON&apos;T GET PAID 2.13 AN HOUR FOR IT. You can&apos;t use the&quot;other people do it&quot;argument. Well you can, but it comes off pretty lame.

Kelly:

Again, because someone is treating you unfairly doesn&apos;t mean you get to be unfair to me. You wouldn&apos;t expect me to pay for any other product or service that I don&apos;t actually receive. I tip for the personal service I receive from my waiter/waitress. I don&apos;t receive the service when I pick up carry out.

&quot;Teleburst says:
&quot;Finally, I&apos;m glad that you have happy letting others subsidize your service(yes, this is a&quot;service&quot;by any definition of the word).&quot;

Kelly:
I am very happy doing this. I would have to say that your claim that someone packaging and bagging my to-go meal is a&quot;service&quot;by any definition of the word is not correct&quot;.

Teleburst:
And I say that you are incorrect. You&apos;ve left out the fact that they took your order over the phone and checked you out, for starters. You gloss over the fact that they ARE providing a service for you and that others are subsidizing your ability to get away with not compensating the restaurant staff for their kindness in providing you an alternative to spending two hours in their restaurant. The amazing thing is that we&apos;re talking about $1 - $5 dollars and that you&apos;re too cheap to consider paying that amount to the very people who are providing you with the service that you have become accustomed to. Talk about your&quot;entitlement issues&quot;.

Kelly:
I have never said that someone hasn&apos;t done work to turn my order into an actual meal that I take home. The restaurant is selling me a product - aka my meals. I will argue that the restaurant staff is not doing anything out of&quot;kindness&quot;. They are doing it because it is their job. It is a business transaction - I give the restaurant money, they give me food. There is no kindness involved. I don&apos;t know about you, but I don&apos;t have to pay people to be&quot;kind&quot;to me.

The amount of money is really not important. Yes, it is just a few dollars, and yes I can easily afford it. I can also afford to throw the same amount of money out my car window as I drive along the street. I don&apos;t do that either.

The idea of&quot;entitlement issues&quot;is a little interesting. I have said that I believe I am entitled to the product I am paying for and that I shouldn&apos;t have to pay for a service I am not receiving. You on the other hand have stated that a person doing carried out is entitled to be paid/tipped for service that they are actually not providing. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m the one with entitlement issues here.

Teleburst:
&quot;I just wish you and lord of acid got to spend one night with a PF Chang&apos;s to-go person or persons. You&apos;d change your tune in a heartbeat, especially if you were forced to do their job. I guarantee it. I KNOW that lords has never done a tenth of what those people have to do in a 4 hour period, even in a week of doing donut shop counter work.&quot;

Kelly:
I am guessing that you believe I would learn how hard a job doing carry-out is. Maybe I haven&apos;t been clear, but I don&apos;t think how difficult a job it is has anything to do with whether or not I should tip. I tip because of the personal, one-on-one service I receive. I don&apos;t get that kind of service when I pick up carry out.

 &quot;But to answer your question - yes there are times when people that pay different amounts are treated differently. First-class flyers board before other people, is one example. The difference being is that they are being offered different services by the airline, not by individual employees of the company. I can get you examples of when different services/access are offered to people once they have given money to an individual, but that is called bribery and is usually considered a felony.&quot;

So in your example... it&apos;s not bribery if the money is given to the company for the special service... if it&apos;s given to an individual, it&apos;s bribery and wrong.

How do you feel about auto-grats at restaurant, where the company adds the tip automatically... thats ok though right?

Silly, silly arguments kelly.

Nice trying to change the conditions. I never said that you woulnd&apos;t be able to&quot;go through the register&quot;. And since we don&apos;t tip the cashier, the comparison is just as false as the cable TV one.

You keep avoiding the fact that you claim you aren&apos;t paying for a service. Since you aren&apos;t, you have no right to complain about how the service that you claim you aren&apos;t getting is managed&lt;chuckle&gt;.

I kinda hope that restaurants eventually simply just impose the same autograt for to-go food(although they should make it 10% instead of 15 - 20%). In fact, if enough people stop tipping, that&apos;s exactly what thy&apos;re going to do, just like when people abused the large party thing. They aren&apos;t going to pay servers $15 an hour just to do takeout food. And really, I hope that it makes people so outraged that they refuse to do takeout food and we could get back to the integrity of restaurants and the dichotomy of table service vs. fast food.

And yet you say that you would get upset if you were put behind people who tip.

&quot;Kelly:
I have never said that someone hasn&apos;t done work to turn my order into an actual meal that I take home. The restaurant is selling me a product - aka my meals.

The&quot;kindness&quot;is not the staff, it&apos;s the restaurant itself for allowing you the privilege of ordering their non-fast food in a quasi fast food manner for your convenience. In the case of most restaurants, if someone is doing takeout, most are still being paid at the same rate as any other server(2.13 - 3.13 an hour in the case of states that don&apos;t require minimum wage). If tips weren&apos;t&quot;expected&quot;, they would have to require any servers doing the work full time to receive at least minimum wage and they aren&apos;t required to do so because many people tip. However, if that changes, you betcha that you&apos;ll end up paying some sort of surcharge, although it might be a&quot;hidden&quot;one such as prices for everyone going up

Since you know that these servers are being underpaid because your tip is expected, you are not the nice person that you probably think you are because you compare paying a server to serve you to-go food the same as throwing money out of your GEO Metro. That&apos;s just wrong.

Yes, I think that someone expecting a bribe is wrong. I am willing to go out on a limb and make that statement.

As for how I feel about auto-grats in a restaurant - well, I don&apos;t know what that has to do with this topic, but I will answer your question anyway. I don&apos;t like them.

Why not? Would you rather pay 30% more for your food and not have to tip at all? Is it the idea of tipping itself that bothers you? Or do you think that servers are just paid too much and don&apos;t deserve to make over, say, $8 an hour because it&apos;s&quot;unskilled&quot;?

BTW, you didn&apos;t respond to/answer vitalryan&apos;s actual statement/question, did you?

You are correct. You never said that someone couldn&apos;t use a register, just that anyone that was willing to slip the cashier some cash should go ahead in line. However the part of&quot;since we don&apos;t tip the cashier&quot;is the point. We don&apos;t tip the cashier, and I don&apos;t think we should tip the person doing carry-out.

Teleburst:
&quot;You keep avoiding the fact that you claim you aren&apos;t paying for a service. Since you aren&apos;t, you have no right to complain about how the service that you claim you aren&apos;t getting is managed&lt;chuckle&gt;.&quot;

Kelly:
I don&apos;t tip the cashier at the grocery store but I still can complain if they don&apos;t do their job properly. People can and do expect a certainly level of performance from people when they purchase a product that has nothing to do with whether or not you are tipping. The big difference is that if I am unhappy with the performance of someone waiting on my table, I have the option of showing that displeasure through my tip. I am sure you don&apos;t really think that you can only expect a decent level of performance if a tip is involved.


Teleburst:
&quot;I kinda hope that restaurants eventually simply just impose the same autograt for to-go food(although they should make it 10% instead of 15 - 20%).

Restaurants certainly have the option of doing so. As long as the charges are made clear up front, then it is the customer&apos;s decision on whether or not to pay it.


&quot;Kelly:
I am guessing that you believe I would learn how hard a job doing carry-out is.

Kelly:

You have got to be kidding. The only privilege they are allowing me is the ability to give them money. If the business wasn&apos;t making money on the transaction, the restaurant wouldn&apos;t offer to-go service - no matter how convenient it might be for me.

Teleburst:
&quot;In the case of most restaurants, if someone is doing takeout, most are still being paid at the same rate as any other server(2.13 - 3.13 an hour in the case of states that don&apos;t require minimum wage).

However, if that changes, you betcha that you&apos;ll end up paying some sort of surcharge, although it might be a&quot;hidden&quot;one such as prices for everyone going up&quot;

Kelly:
Again, servers are paid so poorly because the expectation is that they will be delivering the personal one-on-one service that people know they have to tip for. When that service is not given, neither will the tip.

I do agree that some restaurants might want to add surcharge of some kind to offset their labor costs(assuming they pay a better wage), just like tips offset that cost when people dine in the restaurant. Or, it might be that the cost of the meal minus the extra work that occurs when someone dines in(no dishes to wash, no napkins/tableclothes to launder, no toilet paper in the bathroom, etc)might offset the lack of a tip. I don&apos;t know enough about the costs of running a restaurant to know if that is feasible, but common sense would tell you that it is cheaper for the restaurant for someone to take the meal and go, than to sit and loiter in the dining room.

Teleburst:
&quot;Since you know that these servers are being underpaid because your tip is expected, you are not the nice person that you probably think you are because you compare paying a server to serve you to-go food the same as throwing money out of your GEO Metro. That&apos;s just wrong.&quot;

Kelly:
But expecting me to pay for something I am not receiving makes someone a saint? I do equate paying for something I am not receiving to throwing money away. Like most people I work hard for my money and I don&apos;t want to waste it. I am sure most servers feel the same about their money.

And for the record, I don&apos;t know that a server is being underpaid. I have read on this forum that*some*people that do carry-out are being paid the same wage they would be making if they were waiting on tables, but that some are paid I higher wage for doing this work.

Kelly:

I said implied because you refuse to see the service that is being offered to you.

Just so you know, it&apos;s MORE expensive to offer to-go food because of the cost of packaging.

And finally, yes, I&apos;ve heard that there are some servers who make a whopping $6 an hour. Of course, the reason that restaurants can get people to do the work when they could be making $15 an hour is because PEOPLE STILL TIP. Well, many do. Not YOU, of course, because you don&apos;t see that you&apos;re being offered a service for your convenience. Hope they take the service away from you, since you don&apos;t seem to appreciate it. All I know that since it&apos;s become something more than incidental as it used to be and more and more&quot;institutionalized&quot;(this is a pretty new phenomenon and actually, in restaurants like my current one, it&apos;s still only a 4 or 5 times a week thing), you are in charge of the direction that it takes. If more and more people stop tipping, it will be harder and harder to get people to work FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE. As this happens, something will have to give. My guess? More price increases. And it will probably happen to all prices across the board just to subsidize people like you who are so spoiled that they would complain,&quot;Why am I being charged an extra 10% for my food if I&apos;m only picking up a bag of food&quot;? They think that it&apos;s OK to let people get paid 2.13 an hour so that they can save some time and cheapen their dining experience.

Enjoy your free ride while you can, because something will eventually give.

 If the services doesn&apos;t exist, then do me a favor, when you call for togo, when someone answers the phone, hang up... because they don&apos;t exist.

Kelly, again, I&apos;m not so sure about what you are&quot;not receiving&quot;--- what are you not receiving? It seems so elementary to put this together.... if you are not receiving anything, then who answers the phone when you call to place your togo order? who takes payment? Who packages your food for you? I don&apos;t get it, what are you not receiving here? What am I missing?

And as teleburst said, you still never answered my question about bribery and auto-grats... I didn&apos;t ask if you&quot;liked it&quot;-- I was implying your stance on how that equates to bribery, since your logic seems flawed, as I pointed out as well.

Kelly:
I have never said that someone is not doing some work to turn my order into a meal I take home with me. Obviously someone or someones are doing work for this to happen. There is a difference between someone doing work, and someone providing the personal one-on-one service in a restaurant that people typically agree demands a tip.

Vitalryan:
&quot;Kelly, again, I&apos;m not so sure about what you are&quot;not receiving&quot;--- what are you not receiving? It seems so elementary to put this together.... if you are not receiving anything, then who answers the phone when you call to place your togo order? who takes payment? Who packages your food for you? I don&apos;t get it, what are you not receiving here? What am I missing?&quot;

See answer above.


VitalRyan:
&quot;And as teleburst said, you still never answered my question about bribery and auto-grats... I didn&apos;t ask if you&quot;liked it&quot;-- I was implying your stance on how that equates to bribery, since your logic seems flawed, as I pointed out as well.&quot;

Your exact question was:&quot;How do you feel about auto-grats at restaurant, where the company adds the tip automatically... thats ok though right?&quot;I told you how I feel about them, even though it has nothing to do with the actual topic. You are comparing tipping a server when dining in through an auto-grat, to giving a tip when picking up carryout. I am not arguing that a server shouldn&apos;t be tipped when providing personal one-on-one service. An auto-grat is just a different method of seeing that the server gets the additional payment that everyone agrees they should get anyway. It is not the same as carryout - because I am not receiving the service from the person doing carryout that I get from a server when I dine in.

 Kelly:
&quot;As for how I feel about auto-grats in a restaurant - well, I don&apos;t know what that has to do with this topic, but I will answer your question anyway. I don&apos;t like them&quot;.

Teleburst:
&quot;Why not? Would you rather pay 30% more for your food and not have to tip at all?&quot;

Kelly:

I would actually prefer to have servers paid a wage like everyone else and do away with tipping. And yes, I recognize that prices would go up to accommodate that. Though why you think prices would go up 30% when people typically tip between 10% and 20% is beyond me. The end result is that I wouldn&apos;t pay anymore than I do now, since I always(assuming a basic level of service)tip now.

Teleburst:
&quot;Is it the idea of tipping itself that bothers you? Or do you think that servers are just paid too much and don&apos;t deserve to make over, say, $8 an hour because it&apos;s&quot;unskilled&quot;?&quot;

Kelly:
I think that there is a limit to what someone deserves to be paid for serving, just like there is a limit for any other profession. The exact amount of pay would depend on market forces, just like the pay scale for anyone else. I would be very surprised if it turned out to be as low as 8.00 an hour though.

Teleburst:
&quot;BTW, you didn&apos;t respond to/answer vitalryan&apos;s actual statement/question, did you?&quot;

See the post above this one.

 Kelly,
You wrote ---&quot;I can get you examples of when different services/access are offered to people once they have given money to an individual, but that is called bribery and is usually considered a felony.&quot;

You wrote this right after saying that if the money is given to the company, than it&apos;s all gravy. I asked how an auto-grat fits in to this equation.

This demands an answer then, if the company puts a service charge of 10% on all togo food that is given to the waiter, is this ok?

But whatever, skip the question.


You wrote:&quot;There is a difference between someone doing work, and someone providing the personal one-on-one service in a restaurant that people typically agree demands a tip.&quot;

People DO typically agree that togo&apos;s deserve a tip, in fact, I have done togo&apos;s and would say at least 9 out of 10 people DO tip... thats 90%. You are not paying for the cost of the service in the price of the food, if you refuse to tip for the service, thats theft, although not in a legal sense, surely in an ethical one. You clearly agreed that someone IS doing the service, so pay up. You simply cannot argue this and win it.

It would go up 30% because there are many other costs associated with higher non-tipped wages... such as the employer paying more in taxes, probably benefits, and many other things not taken into account for tipped wages. We can do the math and make comparisons and it&apos;s clear the prices would go up drastically.

Luckily not everyone agrees with you. Most anyone who has been to Europe would agree that the service in standard restaurants is much, much better in the states, you can thank the tipping system for that, these are restaurants that would have a server pay rate of $12-$14 an hour if paying the wages themselves, and I can assure you, service would suffer DRASTICALLY.

It is not my intention to try to ignore your question. If you read the posts above you will see that I have already answered it. To summarize, the auto-grat is just a different way of giving the server the tip everyone agrees should be paid anyway. It is always(or should be, anyway)listed on the menu or otherwise communicated up front to the customer. I would not consider it bribery, if that is what you are asking.

If a company put a surcharge on to-go food, then it is up to me on whether or not I want the product enough to pay the additional cost. But it wouldn&apos;t be bribery in that case either.

Kelly:
Actually, no. Most people do not agree that to-go purchases warrant a tip. Perhaps it is a regional difference, but the only people I have found that think carryout should be tipped are on this forum. I have asked various people and no one has said that they believe carryout should be tipped. I know that asking friends and co-workers is hardly a scientific poll - but it certainly knocks down the idea that&quot;everyone&quot;thinks tipping is warranted.

I also have a little more evidence that everyone doesn&apos;t tip on to-go orders. I was eating lunch with a friend and we were seated in the bar. That is also where people pick up orders they had phoned in. Because of where I was sitting I had a pretty good view of what was going on. I didn&apos;t see anyone obviously leaving tips. Now, several people paid by credit card and I have no idea if they wrote in a tip, but the ones that paid by cash got back change(bills and actual change), and didn&apos;t leave or give any back. I really wanted to ask the bartender if he expected tips on to-go orders, but I didn&apos;t. It seemed a little rude to ask that question of a total stranger.

You are correct that higher wages would mean increased social security, medicare and possibly unemployment taxes on the employer side. I wasn&apos;t thinking of that when I replied.

Kelly:

I have been to Europe and I did find the service there to be horrible by American standards. That was true in restaurants, stores and just about everywhere else. It is not just restaurants where people are not tipped like they are here in the states, it is all over. Clerks in department stores here in the states are not tipped, and they would never behave like the clerks I encountered in Germany. I don&apos;t think the bad service can be blamed solely on the lack of tipping.

I would like to think that servers are professional enough to want to a good job whether they are being tipped or not. I don&apos;t get tipped and I still want to do a good job.

It&apos;s hard to say... since servers work for virtually zero dollar paychecks, I don&apos;t think they would ever want to do a good job if no tip was involved... we aren&apos;t volunteering.


&quot;I know that asking friends and co-workers is hardly a scientific poll - but it certainly knocks down the idea that&quot;everyone&quot;thinks tipping is warranted.&quot;

Again, anyone who works togo&apos;s does hundreds and hundreds of orders on a weekly basis, many thousands in a single year. It&apos;s across the board, that a vast majority of people do tip for togo&apos;s, you definatley don&apos;t average 15%, closer to 8 - 10%... but tips are definately there. When you say&quot;most people don&apos;t agree it warrants a tip&quot;, you are just flat out wrong, if a overwhelming majority of people tipped me when I did togo&apos;s, and I helped a heck of a lot more people than you have asked about it, than I can flat out tell you, that&quot;most&quot;people do agree with tipping on togo&apos;s.

This is still meaningless though, we are flat out telling you that togo workers generally are paid server wages, $2 - $3 an hour and that the cost of their services(taking your phone order, expo&apos;ing your food, packaging food and condiments, sides and utensils, ringing you up, and all the other mumbo jumbo involved)is not included in the cost of the food... period.

If you refuse to tip, again, with the knowledge we are giving you on this alone, you are stealing the service from a hard working person who is simply trying to earn a living, and you should be ashamed if you continue stealing from them.

No one is saying to tip 20% for togo&apos;s, 10% is relatively standard and fair.

I think I need to clarify my statement since it seems I have been misunderstood. I was referring to the idea that servers would want to do a good job if they were paid a straight, fair salary(not $2.00 an hour)instead of being paid with tips. No would expect a server to work for less than minimum wage and not receive tips at the same time.

Kelly:
There seems to be a huge disconnect between what you are seeing, and what I have seen and heard from everyone not on this forum. I have to admit that I don&apos;t quite understand how there can be such a huge difference.

I checked Wikipedia and found the following&quot;Tipping for traditional table service restaurants offering take-out is not necessary, although a small tip(e.g., 5%-10%)is sometimes suggested for curbside service.&quot;

Yahoo Answers( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060608233747AArWci7 )also came back with that is appropriate to not tip on carry-out.

Same with MetaFilter( http://ask.metafilter.com/4945/ )

According to www.tipguide.com &quot;Takeout - If you get good service, in other words, the waiter gets and packages the food, then at your choice you can tip $1-2 or up to 10%. Nothing is really necessary.&quot;

The bottom line is that I am hardly alone in thinking that it is fine not to tip on carry-out. In fact the only links I found that seemed to think tipping was required for carry-out was run by servers, like this forum. I am sure you understand why I would not consider a server to be the most unbiased person to ask on whether or not a server should be handed more money.

I am refusing to tip on carry-out orders because I flat out do not believe I have received any service that warrants a tip. I am not stealing from anyone, and I resent the accusation. Refusing to turn money over to someone who I feel has done nothing to earn it is not stealing. I don&apos;t care if it is 10% or 10 cents.

Kelly, this is what you&apos;re not understanding: we, who work in the industry and work all across the country in multiple types of restaurants and take-out scenarios, are telling you that people who work to-go are generally tipped approximately 10% of their sales. This could mean that several people didn&apos;t tip, and several people tipped 20%(yes, it does happen).

You are absolutely right saying you&apos;re not alone in your thinking, but people with your thinking often just want to bitch and complain about a topic, they don&apos;t actually order take-out and sneer at the to-go specialist instead of leaving a tip. The average person who orders take-out is tipping. Companies like Applebee&apos;s and Chili&apos;s wouldn&apos;t conduct their to-go services the way they currently do if this weren&apos;t true.

So, we accept the fact that you&apos;re not alone in your opinions. But you need to accept that you are the minority. The proof is not in what Google told you, the proof is in the amounts of money to-go people take home at the end of each day.

The bottomline for me is that I don&apos;t feel that I have received the personal attention I would tip for. When I check with my friends and co-workers to see what they do, they say they do not tip. What I watched in local restaurant, I didn&apos;t see anyone obviously tipping. When I check etiquette sites on-line, they say tipping is not necessary.

I think it is obvious that we are not going to agree on this topic. I think we could trade posts for a long time and not change each other&apos;s mind. Perhaps this is a topic where we just need to agree to disagree.

AND THE OWNERS PAY YOU THIS $2-$3 AND HOUR OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEARTS. Maybe they expect a little effort(work)for this money, or do you think it&apos;s for you to just pay your taxes and no work is expected? If the customer enters to pick up togo order, no tip, if it&apos;s brought out to car, $1-$2 dollars.

 Kelly,
I don&apos;t know how to make this more clear. You have acknowledged that you are receiving a service from togo... you just say it doesn&apos;t warrant a tip.

I explained that the cost of the service, that you acknowledged does exist, is NOT included in the cost of the food you are purchasing. Again, if you continue not to tip, even just a couple bucks, you are stealing(ethically)from the person offering you that service.

You&quot;resent the accusation&quot;-- but you have a server telling you how we feel when we spend the time to put a togo order together and get a zero tip... my paychecks are ZERO, 100% of my income is tips. If I spend my time putting your order together, and get nothing for it, you are stealing from me, there is no other way to view it unless you are just completely ignorant, and I think you are smarter than that, you just don&apos;t want to be.


As nuvola pointed out, plenty of people do not tip in a single night for togo&apos;s. If I do 20 togo&apos;s, I would expect 2 or 3 not to tip... in table service, I&apos;ve never been stiffed.

At the end of the day, you are receiving less service than table side... which is why you tip, gasp, LESS than what is expected at tableside. However, you are still receiving a service that warrants a tip.

 And to add to what nuvola said, this is a pretty new phenomenon. Therefore, you really aren&apos;t going to see a lot of things in tipping guides about it yet. This trend(which is actually a new service, whether you acknowledge it or not)only started about 5 years ago as anything other than an occasional to-go request from regular guests. Now it&apos;s gotten to be such a trend that you have restaurants building dedicated to-go areas onto their restaurants.

The only reason you haven&apos;t seen any surcharges or autograts is because servers working dedicated to-go are able to average about 10%, and since their volume is greater than that on the floor, they can make about the same as their on-floor counterparts(but they actually take quite a few more orders). Yes, we&apos;re talking about dozens of to-go orders to juggle per night shift, or tens of lunch shifts for bartenders to have to take away from their&quot;counter service&quot;, so to speak, to handle.

I did a couple of surveys on different nights at PF Chang&apos;s, where the volume was between $1500- 2500 and I found that about 75% of people tipped something. That&apos;s of course less than tableside, and an indication that it&apos;s not universal that people understand that they should tip on to-go, but it was definitely a large majority of people. If the sales were $1500, the server/servers would make around $150, plus or minus $20(we&apos;re talking a relatively slow togo night where one server might be able to handle it). If sales were $2500, you definitely needed two servers, but the take would be somewhere between $230 and $270. The thing is, you usually had to have 2 servers there on all but maybe Sunday or Monday night because you never knew whether you were going to sell $1500 or $2500(togo isn&apos;t as predicatable as table seating).

The surprising thing to me was the number of people who tipped 15% or more. This would be around half of those 70%. Those people were the ones subsidizing your use of this new service.

The sad thing is that things probably won&apos;t change because most people understand that they have to pay the 2.13 an hour server who is juggling their togo orders(sometimes you would literally have 8 people waiting for their togo food at the same time - so think about having to take those 8 telephone orders within a 5 minute period and getting it right). I say sad not because servers can&apos;t make a living doing it but that you are willing to let others pay your way. Because, as I&apos;ve emphasized time after time, if your behavior were the norm, then indeed you would be&quot;tipping&quot;whether you like it or not. If you are someone who is happy being forced to do the right thing, that&apos;s fine. But unfortunately(not for you of course), others will pick up your slack. I just hope that those who tip get some extra attention and consideration from the togo people.

PS, if you*really*want to know the truth, why don&apos;t to go to your local Outback or PF Chang&apos;s or Chili&apos;s and tell them that you are doing some research for&lt;whatever&gt;regarding togo tipping and would they mind letting you come in for a week at the end of the night and go through the CC receipts and do your own statistical research. I&apos;m sure that they wouldn&apos;t mind. I think that you&apos;ll be surprised what your neighbors are doing. In fact, you might go in during the peak and observe what they are doing for sub-minimum wages. Think about how you&apos;d feel if your daughter came home and said,&quot;Mom, I just worked for 2.13 an hour for 6 hours and rang up and serviced $1500 worth of togo food and I didn&apos;t get tipped at all and boy am I wiped out. Don&apos;t people care about the work I do for them?

 tele,
When I worked at Cheesecake Factory, I picked up a shift doing the bakery. When customers who stood in line and ordered would leave a tip, you better believe they were taken care of IMMEDIATELY instead of making them wait behind all the orders from the servers on the floor(it would go in chrono order)...

And at other restaurants, when known non-tippers would order, lol.... well, lets not go there.

So I guess, Kelly, continue to not tip... you will get whats coming, if you haven&apos;t already.

what if my daughter said,&quot;Dad, I just got home from working 6 hours in the togo line and I made 162 bucks, that&apos;s 27 bucks an hour.&quot;. I&apos;d say people were overvaluing the work she did for them.

Let&apos;s be honest, if you paid togo waiters 10 bucks an hour and eliminated tips, people would still take the job and the service would be just as good. Most people provide solid service because it is their job.

Apparently, even though it is not my policy to tip for takeout, take out people still get paid. Vital Ryan you get all your money, so no one is stealing from you, you just want more. Not just you but other waiters. And because of that, some seated patron waits longer because you lined your pockets, and the guy that didn&apos;t tip you, lol...

If you get paid its all good. I don&apos;t think we need to set a rule that 10% is the standard, it is just the average. People can choose to pay 20% or 0%.

If you aren&apos;t getting paid a fair wage, take it up with management.

 &quot;Think about how you&apos;d feel if your daughter came home and said,&quot;Mom, I just worked for 2.13 an hour for 6 hours and rang up and serviced $1500 worth of togo food and I didn&apos;t get tipped at all and boy am I wiped out.&quot;

what if my daughter said,&quot;Dad, I just got home from working 6 hours in the togo line and I made 162 bucks, that&apos;s 27 bucks an hour.&quot;. I&apos;d say people were overvaluing the work she did for them&quot;.

First of all, you&apos;ve forgotten the tipout that your theoretical daughter has given out. On that lucky night where she worked it by herself and&quot;made&quot;$167, she gave at least $30 back to her food runners who helped her package all of that togo food. So now, she&apos;s down to $137(or less if she wanted to reward her helpers even more). Now she&apos;s down to about $22 an hour. That&apos;s still great but think of the 100 people who got to enjoy a great service that they wouldn&apos;t have ordinarily been able to enjoy if your theoretical daughter weren&apos;t there to provide them with the ability to sit at home and call for their food. Think of the pressure of having to unpack each bag in front of the&quot;customer&quot;to show that the order was filled completely and correctly. Think of having to work th phone while she juggled 8 other pending orders, some of whom were probably arriving to get their food. And think of the fact that she probably rang $500 - 800 more food than her counterpart on the floor.

&quot;Let&apos;s be honest, if you paid togo waiters 10 bucks an hour and eliminated tips, people would still take the job and the service would be just as good&quot;.

Let&apos;s be REALLY honest. Who would want to work for $5 to 10 dollars less an hour to do a service that is extremely difficult to pull off well when they can work in a section where they can communicate with their guests face to face and eye to eye and make even more money per hour? Who wants to work in a job where you have to talk about someone&apos;s potentially complex food order over the phone without the fallback of being able to do a real two way communication using gestures, facial expressions, body language, etc? Where you have about a minute to get someone&apos;s order 100% correct because you know that if there&apos;s a screwup, either from the kitchen or your own efforts, you really don&apos;t have the chance to make it right because the guest doesn&apos;t discover that things went wrong until they get home?

&quot;Most people provide solid service because it is their job&quot;.

Sure it is. A job that they expect proper compensation for. How many people do you know who don&apos;t expect to get paid competitive wages for the service that they provide?

&quot;Apparently, even though it is not my policy to tip for takeout, take out people still get paid&quot;.

Only because others pick up your slack. Should you become the norm, that wouldn&apos;t be true. And should it become the norm, you can guarantee that restaurants would find a way to compensate for their now sudden increase in payroll and food costs.

&quot;Vital Ryan you get all your money, so no one is stealing from you, you just want more&quot;.

No, he only wants to get compensated fairly and competitively. He doesn&apos;t want to take a $10 an hour hit to be forced to feed impatient, greedy and ungrateful people like yourself.

&quot;Not just you but other waiters. And because of that, some seated patron waits longer because you lined your pockets, and the guy that didn&apos;t tip you, lol...&quot;

Don&apos;t you believe in the American adage that&quot;you get what you pay for&quot;? Why should someone who has paid extra wait behind someone too cheap to pay at all? Are you a Commie or somethin&apos;?&lt;chuckle&gt;

&quot;If you get paid its all good. I don&apos;t think we need to set a rule that 10% is the standard, it is just the average. People can choose to pay 20% or 0%&quot;.

But they are getting paid because other people, not you, are paying them. You&apos;re getting a free ride. And yes, i think we*do*need to set a rule that 10% is the standard, just as we have that 15% is the standard for sitdown service. After all, as you point out, people can still choose to do the right OR the wrong thing.

&quot;If you aren&apos;t getting paid a fair wage, take it up with management&quot;.

Well, if that becomes the case with togo food, management will end up taking it up with YOU and force you to pay for what you&apos;re currently getting for free(unlike the other 75% who are subsidizing your service, turning you basically into a welfare babe). Your free ride will be over.

 I can&apos;t believe you went through my post line by line and avoided making any good arguments. Just admit you are over paid and whiny. 10% would mean that you do 2/3 of the work a normal server does on the food to get 15%. Please explain how that is.

Especially when you acknowledge that food runners actually get the food but they only get 30 dollars out of 150 soooooo really the job is worht 30. You just want the 150 because you had to stand up in the front and answer phones.

You just weren&apos;t paying attention.

&quot;Just admit you are over paid and whiny. 10% would mean that you do 2/3 of the work a normal server does on the food to get 15%. Please explain how that is&quot;.

Explain how it isn&apos;t. The floor servers are only ringing 2/3rd the amount of food for starters(sometimes even less). I&apos;d repeat some of the other differences, but apparently you didn&apos;t get it the first time.

&quot;Especially when you acknowledge that food runners actually get the food&quot;

Did you miss the word&quot;helped&quot;? Was this willful on your part of just an oversight?

&quot;but they only get 30 dollars out of 150 soooooo really the job is worht 30&quot;.

Since this is based on a false premise, I think we can discard this.

&quot;You just want the 150 because you had to stand up in the front and answer phones&quot;.

I never wanted to do that work. It was far harder than working a section. Sure they usually got out earlier, but during the rush, they were very harried.

You really don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about when it comes to the mechanics of the job. Of course, you aren&apos;t going to bother listening because you have a head like a stone wall, so I won&apos;t bother going over it again.

Since you can stand there and throw stones with impunity(your job isn&apos;t picked apart because, guess what, we don&apos;t even know what you do), there&apos;s not much left to say to you.

 Actually, sure, we make $30 an hour sometimes. But you don&apos;t factor in that the next night we make $9 an hour. It all evens out in the end and it&apos;s typically NOT $30 an hour at a restaurant that does togo&apos;s.

As Tele pointed out, NoTipping, others are subsidizing you lack of a tip, you are getting a free ride here. As a waiter, we work on a per customer basis, we provide a service, they provide a tip. Whether it be 5% or 25%. 0% means they are flat out stealing the service from me.

Just because I make a reasonable wage even while getting stiffed doesn&apos;t make it any more right, it only means I should have made more. Does a real estate agent say&quot;well, I made $60,000 this year, thats reasonable, so I understand that you won&apos;t be paying me a commission on this house&quot;.... yeah, please....

So now it&apos;s your job to explain why this logic fairly applies to MY line of work...

It applies to the latest Radiohead Album. www.inrainbows.com . Radiohead offered an album to say pay what you want for my album. Some paid 0, some paid 2 dollars per song. Ultimately
Radiohead averaged 1 dollar per song. What you are saying is that despite the fact that Radiohead offered there album this way, anyone who paid less than the average was stealing. That is not the way the law works.

When I help an old lady cross the street is she stealing service from me?

Teleburst

I don&apos;t even know where to begin.

A)I&apos;m not saying you process less food than the servers, I&apos;m saying that per hamburger you get 2/3 as much as a server. When I pay 15% to order, get my food brought to the table, get my glasses refilled, order drinks, send food back, get a set place, napkins, and all the aspects of service.

You say that you do 2/3rds as much as that, if you do I don&apos;t feel it.

And then there are the complaints, either you are being helped or you are not. You can&apos;t describe all that you do as this harrowing experience, if someone else is doing 20% of the work. The work which is plating the food and ketchup and putting spoons and napkins.

When I go to a restaurant I&apos;m looking for food I can order and pick up that is tastier than McDonald&apos;s. That is all factored into the price of the food. That is what I pay. I&apos;m not looking for food that is more servicey than Mcdonalds, so I won&apos;t pay for that. If I don&apos;t tip you, and you just provide me with the level of service I get from KFC and McDonald&apos;s, I will take that.

 &quot;When I go to a restaurant I&apos;m looking for food I can order and pick up that is tastier than McDonald&apos;s. That is all factored into the price of the food&quot;.

Only when you dine in because it&apos;s accepted that servers are to receive tips(whether or not it&apos;s mandatory), 99.9% of people understand and tip accordingly. Your food prices are based on this principle. On the other hand, you are still paying a server 2.13 an hour for the same food at the same price and not tipping. The only reason that you aren&apos;t being charged a togo&apos;surcharge&quot;is the the majority of people understand and are tipping, and therefore are doing the right thing(you can also choose not to tip at all tableside and while you CAN do it, I think that even you would agree that it&apos;s not the right thing to do in the face of good service). If it becomes true that the majority of people end up not tipping, then your prices will go up. It&apos;s possible that you will make prices go up for EVERYONE, or it&apos;s possible that restaurants will recognize that togo guests are getting the benefit of cheap labor and will impose a 10% togo surcharge to cover the cost of paying a server the prevailing(and legal)wage. Right now, a restuarant gets an exemption to pay at least minimum wage for TIPPED EMPLOYEES. That&apos;s who&apos;s serving you. If this is to change, as you seem to want it to, the increased payroll WILL be reflected in the menu prices, either across the board or for togo food only.

&quot;You say that you do 2/3rds as much as that, if you do I don&apos;t feel it&quot;.
Well, feel it if you can&apos;t get&quot;food I can order and pick up that is tastier than McDonald&apos;s&quot;.

&quot;If I don&apos;t tip you, and you just provide me with the level of service I get from KFC and McDonald&apos;s, I will take that&quot;.

If none of you&quot;tip me&quot;(in parentheses because I don&apos;t do togo food), then you either won&apos;t be able to get the food at all(and you&apos;ll be stuck with McDonald&apos;s)or you will pay the amount that you should be paying NOW, and probably even more. That&apos;s because restaurants won&apos;t be able to legally pay their servers 2.13 an hour anymore, PLUS, they won&apos;t get servers to work for $5 an hour less than their floor counterparts for doing a lot harder job.

Your choice.

&quot;And then there are the complaints, either you are being helped or you are not. You can&apos;t describe all that you do as this harrowing experience, if someone else is doing 20% of the work. The work which is plating the food and ketchup and putting spoons and napkins&quot;.

Someone is always doing&quot;20% of the work&quot;, even when you&apos;re dining tableside. You keep compartmentalizing the work. First you claim that it&apos;s only answering the phone. Then you say it&apos;s only&quot;plating the food and ketchup and putting spoons and napkins&quot;. Next you&apos;ll mention that it&apos;s only inputting the orders correctly into the computer. Next you&apos;ll say that it&apos;s only greeting the togo guest and unpacking the order so that they can check it(that&apos;s the way they do it at Chang&apos;s). Next you&apos;ll say, all you have to do is take payment for the food. Next you&apos;ll say that all you have to do is restock all of those togo containers, condiments, etc. Then, you&apos;ll say that all you have to do is deal with 8 different togo orders all trying to pick up their food at the same time, making sure that all special orders are communicated to the kitchen properly because you don&apos;t have the chance to make it right after the fact as you do when you&apos;re tableside. Then, you&apos;ll say that all you have to do is fight for your togo orders&apos;place in the rush and get your food as close to the quote time as possible. No, you don&apos;t&quot;feel&quot;any of this, just like you don&apos;t feel about 50% of what goes on behind the scenes with your table server.

You really don&apos;t&quot;feel&quot;much of anything, except your free ride.

&quot;It applies to the latest Radiohead Album. www.inrainbows.com . Radiohead offered an album to say pay what you want for my album. Some paid 0, some paid 2 dollars per song. Ultimately
Radiohead averaged 1 dollar per song&quot;.

You don&apos;t know WHAT they got(I suspect that they WISH that they got $1 per song, since that would be a full-priced album). They haven&apos;t released any figures. Better not to just make stuff up if you want to be taken seriously.

If the cost was absorbed by the restaurant, I would pay a service charge. I don&apos;t have a problem with you getting paid if you are working. I just don&apos;t think everyone should have to pay 10%. I don&apos;t get how your work applies to a percentage of my food. If I buy two salads or one steak, you get the same tip but do different work. I think people should stop tipping and you guys should get a service charge. period.

 notipping,
Your Radiohead analagy fails, simply because 15% is the service standard and is customary. It&apos;s well accepted that when you eat out, you tip 15% give or take. In fact, it&apos;s so well established that I have NEVER once been stiffed on table service, not once.

However, if it was customary to&quot;tip&quot;$1 per song, for instance, than that analagy would work, instead, sites sell songs for $1 typically, but that doesn&apos;t carry over to the Radiohead situation simply because there is no customary price for this TYPE of distribution.

I also said that even a 5% tip isn&apos;t stealing, it&apos;s a crappy tip, but not stealing. Theft of service is a stiff, or real close to it. And again, we are talking ethics here.

The old lady isn&apos;t stealing service because there is no general custom to tip for such a service.

PaidUp,
I&apos;ve pointed out, many times already, that it&apos;s not stealing in a legal sense, it&apos;s stealing ethically.

 I just have to ask, LOA and the fast foodies here, what in hell is your cholesterol? My god, salad, sushi, oysters, tapas, anything besides lard, grease and trans fat ever get into your system? I&apos;d check out that soon, or you won&apos;t be on here arguing, you&apos;ll be having a triple bypass.

 &quot;they did release figures it was in the bbc a few weeks back, if you haven&apos;t been paying attention I can&apos;t help you&quot;.

As you recently demanded - citations please.

I found a third party estimate(not from Radiohead themselves)here:

 http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=1883 

This shows that US consumers paid an average of about $8 a download whereas international downloaders paid an average of about $4.50. This is far less than $1 a track since there are 10 tracks on the album. Also, if you continue the analogy, your togo food would be inferior to the real restaurant food if you didn&apos;t pay the same as those who tip, since the Radiohead downloads are only MP3s at the basic bitrate of 160 bps, which is not even close to CD quality or the quality of the product which is going to physically go on sale in January.

&quot;If the cost was absorbed by the restaurant, I would pay a service charge. I don&apos;t have a problem with you getting paid if you are working. I just don&apos;t think everyone should have to pay 10%. I don&apos;t get how your work applies to a percentage of my food. If I buy two salads or one steak, you get the same tip but do different work&quot;.

I&apos;m sorry that you can&apos;t figure out that tipping isn&apos;t done by the action. It&apos;s a gestalt sort of thing. It&apos;s intended to apply to the entire experience. It isn&apos;t .50 for bringing you your coffee, $12 for bringing you a $120 lobster, .10 for saying hello, etc. It&apos;s a basic percentage that is standard across the board and it&apos;s based on the fact that Americans actually like to tip and because they like to tip, it&apos;s generally accepted that servers are pretty well compensated through tips and this gives restaurants the ability to pay a minimum hourly wage and therefore keep the menu prices lower than if they had to pay a full payroll. It&apos;s a situation that feeds upon itself. The advantage to you is that you aren&apos;t forced to pay a set amount even if the service is substandard, as you would if tipping were eliminated.

&quot;I think people should stop tipping and you guys should get a service charge. period.

If you want to cut off your nose to spite your face, that&apos;s fine. Why you would want to give up that flexibility, I don&apos;t know, but apparently it&apos;s a burr under your saddle. However, for a century, the main of America prefers the tipping system and it&apos;s only a miniscule number of people who don&apos;t like it enough to speak out against it. The funny thing is, there are very few people who even take advantage of the fact that tipping isn&apos;t mandatory, EXCEPT when it comes to togo food. And guess what? Should a majority of people stop tipping for togo food, you WILL be paying some sort of mandatory service charge, whether it&apos;s upfront and stated as a percentage, or hidden in price increases apart from the normal inflation adjustments.

Need an example? How many restaurant did you see 10 years ago that autogratuities for parties of 6/8 or more? They were few and far between. However, as people abused the large party, more and more restaurants started applying such service charges. Now, almost every restaurant has such a policy(although mine doesn&apos;t and it&apos;s an exception to the rule, mainly because we really don&apos;t have a problem with larger parties in general because of our customer base). Funny thing though, now people are complaining about autograts on parties.. Well, maybe so many people shouldn&apos;t have screwed their servers. Prices*will*float to the proper levels, you can be assured of that. And those abusers, the kind who hid their low tipping in the flurry of seperate checks because they were selfish and let others pay for the service that they received, ruined it for EVERYONE.

Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it.

The website you cited to admitted it didn&apos;t know, why would you post that. A radiohead spokesperson said that most people were paying regular price.

VitalRyan its 2007 download itunes

Both of you guys are just making stupid statements now. In your hearts, you both agree that the tipping is meant for service. Teleburst almost thought it out but he didn&apos;t quite make it. Tipping is for the experience and began with waiters, what you guys are talking about is expanding tipping to cover a service which, but for it being located in the same building is nothing like waiting.

I tip the shoeshine guy, the guy that cuts my hair, and my waitresses. I tip well. Why should we tip a togo guy? And if we do, should we tip the pizza restaurant guy when I get take out? What about the wings girl when I go there but call ahead? Should I tip the starbucks guy if I ask for room in my coffee for cream? what about the guy at the gap that wraps all the gifts in boxes during the holidays?


I do wish for the market to correct togo tipping. Let the tipping stop and let us see how much the customer would pay for the food and how little the togo guy would work for.

I think we&apos;ll all learn something. I for one will never tip takeout and the moment an adverse incident happens, I&apos;m informing the manager and getting the waiter fired.

 There&apos;s nothing in that statement that has anything but vague statements. No specifics, no facts and figures. In fact, look below for further strangeness regarding this comment.

In fairness, here&apos;s Radiohead&apos;s comment(secondhand, of course)on the report that I cited(and I specifically noted that it was third party):

&quot;Finally, XL also passed along a message from Radiohead&apos;s camp regarding that previously mentioned third-party In Rainbows download analysis, which concluded folks paid an average of $2.26 for the release. Spake the reps:&quot;As the album could only be downloaded from the band&apos;s website, it is impossible for outside organisations to have accurate figures on sales.&quot;

However, they refuse to release the figures themselves. You can only get a vague figure from a&quot;spokesman&quot;that was quoted, and get this, 8 days before the official download release date of the album(the quote is from 2 Oct but the album wasn&apos;t officially released by the band until Oct. 10th. Go figure).

&quot;I think we&apos;ll all learn something. I for one will never tip takeout and the moment an adverse incident happens, I&apos;m informing the manager and getting the waiter fired&quot;.

Yep, just shows that you are just an annoying twat.&quot;I&apos;m telling mommy! I&apos;m telling mommy&quot;!

BTW, I&apos;m all in favor of Radiohead&apos;s experiment. However, if people were paying close to&quot;full retail&quot;, they would be AVERAGING $10 a downloadable&quot;non-physical&quot;album(which is .99 per track for a 10 track album - sort of the going rate on itunes, Napster, etc.)If you believe that people are paying that, or even close to it on average, I&apos;d suggest you crushing your crack pipe.

Not sure what was stupid about my comment. I pointed out how your analagy failed. In fact, I used the $1 per song for a reason. I also pointed out that Radiohead is NOT distributing their song in such a fashion.

Why is it different? Because there is obviously no overhead, maybe Radiohead was only seeing .08 per song from services like Rhapsody and iTunes... and maybe the tips average out to .10 per song and they consider that&quot;customary&quot;. We really don&apos;t know. So the analagy doesn&apos;t work.

However, 10% is average all over for togo, it&apos;s customary... thus, reasonable to say that it&apos;s a TIPPED JOB. Comparing it to the pizza clerk at the counter of Papa John&apos;s is ludicrous and stupid, simply because it&apos;s NOT customary to tip that person.. it&apos;s NOT a tipped position.

You are really sinking here, provide a valid argument or just agree that you are wrong.

&quot;I do wish for the market to correct togo tipping. Let the tipping stop and let us see how much the customer would pay for the food and how little the togo guy would work for.&quot;

Not gonna happen. You will simply just see service charges. ToGo servers ring up food exactly like regular servers, why would the restaurant pay them any different? They pay them a higher wage, they would have to make up that somewhere... and YOU will be paying for it... period.

 It seems this thread is pretty much done but what the hell. I&apos;m a decent to good tipper but reading these posts I feel like I&apos;m justified in my less that average tipping(at times).... I don&apos;t think I should go into a restaurant feeling like there are only certain things I&apos;m allowed to base my tipping on. I don&apos;t nitpick and I sit down with an automatic 15% tip in mind but if my experience isn&apos;t pleasant or I feel that at the end of my meal I&apos;m not satisfied then I should have the right not to tip the average. It seems like there needs to be some sort of terrible, horrible experience before I&apos;m ALLOWED to lessen my tip from money I&apos;ve ALREADY earned. Again I don&apos;t mind tipping and I don&apos;t take away from tips for little details like forgetting a soda or wrong dish that&apos;s been corrected but when I still get made to feel guilty about the work conditions of the server.... Sorry, that&apos;s Oprah&apos;s job.

Tipping for take out??? Don&apos;t think so, sorry. There are too many different possibilities that have been stated on this board for me to feel obligated to tip. Some places pay the server a higher wage when working take out. Some places are better equipped to deal with take out orders which makes the act of putting together the order less difficult... I&apos;m not going to tip for no personal service because I&apos;m suppossed to assume the worse possible work conditions for the server? So even though I do honestly sympathize and agree it&apos;s a crappy job I can&apos;t possibly afford to lift people&apos;s spirits by just giving money away on services I didn&apos;t receive. You did put in work for my order TOTALLY true but the whole basis of Tipping is it&apos;s a luxury people decide to treat themselves to for about an hour or so of personal attention. The tipping is for the LUXURY part not the parts that are required for you to just get to the end result i.e me getting my food and leaving.

Again I understand and always make it a point to tip especially if the server I have is pleasant. I even tip servers who are pretty mediocre but now I have to tip because you&apos;ve got it rough???? That&apos;s it? Keep in mind what I receive. Food I&apos;ve paid for in containers, utensils, condiments and a bag. Not to sound cold but it is what it is. No one is taking away the work that is involved but although it&apos;s a low wage the restaurant does pay you something and I would think that take out which really doesn&apos;t have much customer/server interaction would fall into what the restaurant is paying you for. The customer is responsible for making up the low wage by paying for a luxury they receive. i.e having you wait on them. You&apos;re not providing me with anything luxurious when I walk in grab a bag with items I&apos;ve paid the restaurant for and leave. The labor that goes into that part of your job is what the restaurant wage is for.. Again I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve been compensation or not. There&apos;s all this politics involved and different standards everywhere so how am I suppossed to determine what&apos;s fair or not? By just tipping everytime, every place I guess.

I&apos;m not Rockefeller but I do deserve to treat myself once and a while and I don&apos;t feel that I should only be able to do that if and only if everyone involved can benefit too. I work on a salary and believe you me, I stay late to make sure the work is done, I work through lunch and a lot of other people benefit from the good job I do. My pay doesn&apos;t vary but you better believe the job better get done whether I stay til 5 or til 7 my pay stays the same the workload doesn&apos;t. Actually I have 2 jobs and work my butt off and still don&apos;t pull numbers like the one&apos;s that I&apos;m seeing on these boards. Even servers at waffle houses seem to be pulling some seriously nice numbers. Sorry if I don&apos;t feel sorry enough for you to throw around money but I&apos;ve got bills to pay and I have to validate the money I spend on luxuries which are few and far between... Call me cheap(although I usually tip 18%-20% and 15% even when a server spilled soda on a friend of mine the other day)but I think that I shouldn&apos;t have to be face with such outright entitlement on the part of people who after all is said and done make some really decent money and still want more from a customer who isn&apos;t getting the luxury of the kind of service tipping is normally associated with.

Do you care about the customer who can barely afford to treat himself or herself to a nice dinner with friends after a long week of 10-16 hour days of hard labor but can only manage a 15% tip? Cause 15% is pretty cheap isn&apos;t it? He shouldn&apos;t even bother cause if he can&apos;t make your night that much more richer then he should stay home or better yet, he wants a easy, good meal from his favorite restaurant after a grueling day but is scrimping every cent he can so take out seems like a compromise of luxury vs. expense since he can save on the tip. Would that make him cheap and you totally wronged.. You all wouldn&apos;t give a rat&apos;s a$$ about that or the mortgage payments(that teleburst loves to refer to)they need to make so why should we sit around and factor these enormous and I do mean enormous amount of variables that are littered all over the forum? No one worries that much about my pay or how I&apos;m going to make my next mortgage payment which is why I need to have the right to tip according to what has been earned. I&apos;ve earned every cent of my money and I shouldn&apos;t be expected to be so ridiculously generous as this forums suggests I be. I shouldn&apos;t have to worry so much about how you make ends meet outside the common practice of me sitting down have a meal receive service, RATE service leave 15-20% tip or less if need be. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve earned the right to do with MY money. The End!

 &quot;You&apos;re not providing me with anything luxurious when I walk in grab a bag with items I&apos;ve paid the restaurant for and leave&quot;.

The&quot;luxury&quot;as you so quaintly put it, is the right to get something&quot;in a bag&quot;better than a burger at McDonald&apos;s.

I bet you&apos;d be the first to howl if restaurants started adding an additional 10%&quot;to-go&quot;surcharge which would take care of all of those nasty labor issues that you talk about. Enjoy your free ride while you can(you&apos;re being subsidized by all of those people who ARE tipping), because if people stop tipping, that&apos;s exactly what&apos;s going to happen.

Guess what? We aren&apos;t the only ones who seem to have entitlement issues. You seem to feel that you are entitled to your dining out as well, as well as being able to walk into any full-service restaurant and get the food there to take home with you and eat it on your sofa. And the servers there can slave for you at 2.13 an hour and you really don&apos;t care. Well, that&apos;s fine, but eventually something&apos;s gonna give&apos;cause, sister(or brother), let me tell you that no server&apos;s going to work for less than minimum wage in order to accommodate your busy lifestyle.

As far as a 15% tip goes - that&apos;s an acceptable tip because that&apos;s the baseline standard. If you don&apos;t want to spend any more money to reward top-notch service, that&apos;s your right, I suppose. And I&apos;m sure that you sometimes wish for more money, don&apos;t you? So why get mad when we ask that people follow the general guidelines? And guess what? Dining out isn&apos;t a right, you know. If you can&apos;t afford to pay your mortgage because you&quot;stretch&quot;your budget to dine out, then maybe you shouldn&apos;t be dining out. Using your mentality, I&apos;m no Rockefeller, but I deserve to drive a Jaguar. I&apos;ve earned it, haven&apos;t I?

If you aren&apos;t pulling money like you see on these boards, then maybe you should come over to the dark side and join us, the greedy, unfeeling service staff. If you are slaving away at a job that doesn&apos;t allow you to even eat lunch or requires you to stay for hours after you should be clocking out, then I guess you&apos;re either not very efficient or you&apos;re getting exploited. believe me, I&apos;ve been there. That&apos;s why I don&apos;t manage a restaurant anymore. I don&apos;t work the 70 hour weeks anymore. Maybe you should think about being a server. Or is it a job that you consider&quot;beneath you&quot;?

I do care that&apos;s why I tip them. Didn&apos;t you read that part of my post? I&apos;m just trying put in a few realistic points that entitled servers don&apos;t seem to want to realize. Let&apos;s not twist the facts about who I am. I&apos;m a good customer and very soft spoken. I ask politely, say please and thank you and leave up to 20% tips. What I don&apos;t approve of is still being treated like a cheap skate because I have a backbone when necessary and WILL leave a penny on the table to signify that I won&apos;t be bullied into a tip from a server who ignored me the whole time and acted as if I was a burden because I asked for more napkins since the single napkin that held my utensils couldn&apos;t be stretch through to the end of my meal. I don&apos;t represent anyone who expects to dine and not pay for service of course not. My points are to highlight that I, of course, take into account your low wage and I think I do a decent job making up the difference but what I DON&apos;T like is having to make up the difference even though you&apos;ve treated me as if I shouldn&apos;t expect more than you taking my order then bringing me my check. That&apos;s the mentality I argue when necessary.

Tipping for takeout falls into that category. I understand it&apos;s hard work the point I&apos;m trying to make is that not everything involved in your chosen profession has to do with me and my obligation to make up the wage difference. No one wants to admit that it shouldn&apos;t fall on us to compensate you for ALL of the duties you have in a restaurant. You have to be somewhat realistic. The customers part of the equation shouldn&apos;t be stretched to all parts of the restaurant business as most of these posts propose to do. I mean it&apos;s gotten to the point where little detail has been described when preparing the order like we don&apos;t already understand that you&apos;re working. Breaking it down into smaller details like putting utensils in the bag and condiments and looking the order over doesn&apos;t make it something more amazing than it is. I work in retail and Close Out sections I&apos;m assigned each night. That&apos;s what they call&quot;Close It Out&quot;. I could easily say I fold 30 shirts then fold 20 pairs of jeans and hang 15 coats etc. That&apos;s sounds like a lot but it all falls into the category of closing out my section which is what I&apos;m there to do. It is a lot of work but it&apos;s not any additional amount of work than what is necessary to produce the expected end result.

So now dining out is the equivalent to owning a Jaguar? No I said that I earned the right to treat myself and in order for my mortgage not to suffer I reserve the right to tip appropriately according what I feel has been earned without apology. I&apos;ve done nothing wrong and I&apos;ve followed the guidelines so where have I overstepped some line? I&apos;ve done nothing outside of the norm so why am I being received as someone who wants something for nothing?? Of course the whole low wage thing can be argued for days on end but changing the concept of what a tip is for in order to have more of a handle on what you get to take home is just a bit over the top and unfair to the customer. I&apos;ve earned my money why can&apos;t I be a little particular on how I had it over to you?

No the higher price of the food is why I get the luxury of not having McDonald&apos;s in my bag which is covered when I pay. The luxury of having someone wait on me is why I tip and also why most people tip so it&apos;s funny how that simple concept isn&apos;t really being realized here. Your hectic job conditions in the back while bagging my food doesn&apos;t qualify as you waiting on ME for about an hour or so.

Look I&apos;m not looking to short change anyone but there is too much cruel and rude entitlement attitudes out there and I&apos;m sorry I won&apos;t feed into it because I&apos;m supposed to feel sorry for someone choosing to work a&quot;$3.16 an hour&quot;job. Especially when I know for a fact, when all is said and done, that the earnings at the end of the day are more than sufficient wages. Sooo go ahead and Cry me a River about that 10% you didn&apos;t get from me for the 10 minutes you spent preparing my single to go order and don&apos;t forget to point out that you took 20 steps to the kitchen and 20 steps back then opened the bag and bend down to get the utensils then turned around to pick up the 2.5 pound container of food....

 Hell, cry ME a river when I choose to put you behind the 4 other people that I know are good tippers when you come to pick up your to-go food. Cry me a river when I don&apos;t bother to give you extra napkins(so that you can stretch your househood budget by using the restaurant&apos;s paper napkins instead of yours). Cry me a river when you find that your friends that tip get extra condiments and you only get the bare minimum.

You just don&apos;t get it. The ONLY reason that you aren&apos;t paying more for your to-go food is that enough people are tipping to allow the restaurant not to have to pay extra to the server who&apos;s getting your order together. Without those neighbors of yours who are actually doing the right thing by tipping(usually around 10% because there are very few of us who would say that you should tip at the same rate as if you were dining in - even though you seem to imply that)you&apos;d be getting charged a surcharge because the restaurant isn&apos;t in the charity business. They aren&apos;t going to pay the to-go servers a&quot;normal wage&quot;unless it makes financial sense. and the only way it&apos;s going to make financial sense is if their servers can make close to what they make on the floor, especially when they sell 150% more food than those floor servers.

Something&apos;s going to give, but as long as most people tip something and allow the server to actually make money, you&apos;re getting a free ride and you&apos;re a welfare baby, because others are subsidizing your choice not to tip.

Simple as that.

Oh yeah, no, the luxury isn&apos;t the higher price of food than McDonald&apos;s. You are paying the same thing as those who dine in(so they are actually subsidizing you as well). Until the server gets paid commensurate with the amount of food that&apos;s going out the door, you aren&apos;t getting anything other than a free ride once again. The key to this is the howl that I&apos;m sure you&apos;d issue if you started to have to pay an extra 10% for your food in order to pay those servers. You&apos;d claim it was&quot;unfair&quot;even though the server has to be paid somehow. Right now, that&quot;somehow&quot;is the tips that people pay for to-go food. fortunately, a majority of people pay that tip because they understand that it&apos;s the&quot;right thing to do&quot;. Sorry you don&apos;t want to the do the&apos;right thing&quot;because you want to stretch your budget so that you can pay your mortgage and still treat yourself to upscale to-go food whenever you want it.

 I realize that Waffle House is a far cry from a 5 star restaurant(Maybe closer to a -5 star)but I like taking to go orders as there is 10% added to the check up front(Yes they can see it on their check)and almost everyone tips more on top of that. On the shift I work a lot of the to go orders are by bar staff. They are closing around 2 a.m. now, and then they have another 2 hours or so of cleaning. When they get off they want to eat, but don&apos;t want to go home and cook. They have been dealing with the same drunks we have and they are wiped out tired. They pay another $2-$10 for to-go. A lot of them tip the cook as well.

The general public will usually leave at least $2. Treat them right as making sure they have plenty of what they need, and it goes up.

Of course you shouldn&apos;t have to tip as much on to go orders as those who are dining in, as you aren&apos;t getting as much service, but you are getting service and should tip something. Get tired of posting here, shop instead!!!

 To neecey93:

Right On !!! Great last post! Sounds to me like you&apos;re being fair&amp;reasonable, but the entitlement crowd here are promoting their own self-serving(pun intended)interests&amp;are just going to out type you. Restaurants will do take out as long as it makes a profit, or unless the servers unionize(yeah right)for a piece of the action. Until then, the threat of restaurants adding a charge to make up for non-tippers is nonsense. They&apos;d only loose that added business. You&apos;ve made your point. I&apos;d just move on.

We get 10% of every order that we take. The customers know this up front, and most will still tip more on top of this.

The bottom line is, it really doesn&apos;t matter about the small percent that don&apos;t tip on take out as it is more than made up by those that tip. Get tired of posting here, shop instead!!!
