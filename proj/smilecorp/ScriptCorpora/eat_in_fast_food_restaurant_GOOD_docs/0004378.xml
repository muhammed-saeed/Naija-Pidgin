 00:00:01 People on drugs. 00:00:02 People who are alcoholics. 00:00:05 People who are. 00:00:07 I thought about the lowplaces. 00:00:10 How that&quot;god asked ezekiel, &apos;can&quot;and how that we began tofeed the hungry in haiti, and we&apos;re continuing to doto this day. 00:00:20 And doing more, and more,and more. 00:00:23 And then, just recently,enthe lord spoke to my heartabout sex trafficking,human traffiing. 00:00:33 And he said,&quot;can thesebones live&quot;? 00:00:35 And what, what he wassaying, what that reallymeans is,&quot;can we dosomething about this&quot;? 00:00:39 You see all these&quot;drybones&quot;, this valley ofdeath&quot;, can we dosomething about this? 00:00:43 Can we change the destinyof a village in peru byhaving a medical missionship that we have, and wesend fourteen thousanddollars a month for themoney that you just sentin. 00:00:55 And we send that ship downthe amazon, and a wholevillage, the holy spiritfeeds a whole village ofchildren that don&apos;t haveany food, and don&apos;t haveany medicine, and livingaround in little huts, andrunning around half naked. 00:01:07 And the holy spirit says&quot;can we do something aboutthis? 00:01:10 Can these bones live? 00:01:10 Can we do something about&quot;and you&apos;ve given over amillion dollars throughthe years, well over amillion dollars to thatmedical mission ship. 00:01:19 And they perform surgery&apos;sthere. 00:01:21 &quot;Can, can these boneslive&quot;? 00:01:23 The people in the lowplaces. 00:01:25 The people in the lowplaces. 00:01:28 What do you do when yourgreatest enemy is? 00:01:30 If it was a person, i, icould take you on, but. 00:01:32 But what do you do when,when your greatest enemyis geography? 00:01:36 Where you were born? 00:01:38 What do you do if youweren&apos;t born in america, ahigh place, but you wereborn in haiti, a lowplace? 00:01:44 What do you do when youweren&apos;t born? 00:01:46 Let&apos;s bring it home. 00:01:47 You weren&apos;t born in a, ina middle class, but youwere born in the projects(that&apos;s right/come on)born in a low place. 00:02:03 Never, ever had a chance. 00:02:06 They were born in a lowplace (clapping). 00:02:08 &quot;What?

00:03:08 Could we change thedestiny of some of thesechildren? 00:03:13 Nine point two millionchildren that were born in2007 will die before theage of 5. 00:03:18 Nine point two million. 00:03:23 There&apos;s a mother inafrica. 00:03:24 There is a mother in southamerica that is holding a3 year old baby in theirarms, even as I speak, andthat baby willeverits fifth birthday becausethe child&apos;s stomach isswollen, and it hasnothing to eat, and noclean water to drink. 00:03:43 &quot;one out of seven childrenhave no access to anyhealth care at all. 00:03:52 No pills, no doctors, novaccines, nothing, ever. 00:03:57 Ever! 00:03:58 Ever! 00:03:59 &quot;one hundred millionchildren hno access tosafe water. 00:04:11 One in three children donot have adequate shelter. 00:04:16 One hundred and twentynine million children willnever go to one day ofschool. 00:04:24 One hundred and twentynine million children willnever learn to read, neverlearn to write, never sitin a school class. 00:04:36 D he said, &apos;the hand ofthe lord came upon me, andtook me to the low placeto see the people in thelow place. 00:04:47 And he asked me, &apos;can we&quot;&quot;can we make a differencein these lives? 00:04:57 Sometimes the onlydifference is a place. 00:05:01 He said,&quot;the place wasvery dry&quot;and I can&apos;t shake it. 00:05:08 I feel like&quot;the hand ofthe lord has come upon me&quot;for this church, and you. 00:05:12 And he&apos;s taking us, andmaking us notice the lowplaces. 00:05:18 And he&apos;s saying&quot;we can dosomething about starvingchildren in haiti. 00:05:23 We can do something aboutkid&apos;s in uganda, africa,the watoto choir that sungon this platform two weeksago of aids orphans. 00:05:36 Every one of thosechildren, their parentsdiand you gave them almofifty thousand dollars. 00:05:41 And we&apos;re believing foranother fifty thousand tocome in. 00:05:44 And we&apos;re going to be ableto feed those preciouschildren in uganda,africa. 00:05:50 Come on and shout with mejust. 00:05:51 &quot;Can these bones live&quot;?

00:24:10 Don&apos;t get frustrated whenyour plans don&apos;t work out. 00:24:13 Don&apos;t get upset when you getinterrupted. 00:24:16 God is in complete control. 00:24:17 He is directing every oneof your steps. 00:24:21 You may never know how god usedjust a smile you gavesomeonethat all of the suddenbrightened their day. 00:24:28 Or maybe you just held the dooropen for a strangerand all of the sudden they feltgod&apos;s love. 00:24:34 I remember when our son jonathanwas about five years old. 00:24:37 This would have been maybe tenyears ago. 00:24:40 We loved to go to this certainmexiit was close to the house. 00:24:44 We would run up there from timeto time. 00:24:46 One day we were really hungryandreally looki fwardo ingbut when we got therea company was having a big partyand the place was packed. 00:24:55 The wait was 45 minutes. 00:24:56 I couldn&apos;t believe it. 00:24:59 I had never seen a wait at thatlittle restaurant. 00:25:01 We left there so disappointed. 00:25:02 We didn&apos;t have time to wait. 00:25:03 We decided to go to a littlehamburger place down the road. 00:25:06 I had only been to this otherplace once or twice before. 00:25:10 When we went in there were maybeten small tables. 00:25:13 I noticed a gentleman sittingat the very front tableelas I passed by I just naturally&quot;didn&apos;t think any more about it. 00:25:25 Just went on about my business. 00:25:27 A few days later I receiveda letter in the mail from him. 00:25:32 He told how he was at the lowestpoint of his life. 00:25:35 Everything had gone wrong. 00:25:36 The bottom had fallen out. 00:25:37 He was not a religious person. 00:25:39 He never went to church. 00:25:41 He never prayed. 00:25:43 But that morning he said,&quot;god,if you are realand you still have a planfor my life,I&apos;m asking you to give me some&quot;he said,&quot;joel, when your eyesmet mineit was like oil was being pouredall over me. 00:25:57 I felt a love that I had never&quot;(applause)he left that day with a newsense of purpose,knowing that god still hadsomething great in his future. 00:26:07 You never know how god can usea smile,a kind word, a simple,&quot;god&quot;I realize now that restaurantbeing crowded wasn&apos;t a mistake. 00:26:17 Victoria not finding the creditcard wasn&apos;t an accident. 00:26:21 Those were divineinterruptions. 00:26:23 That was the hand of goddirecting our steps,utting ung us in position to help usomeone else in need. 00:26:31 When you get inconvenienced,delayed, interrupted,it&apos;s easy to get frustratedand think,&quot;i can&apos;t believe this ishappening. 00:26:40 I&apos;m going to be late. 00:26:41 I can&apos;t find the car keys. 00:26:42 &quot;no, here&apos;s what I&apos;ve learned;it&apos;s not all about me. 00:26:46 It&apos;s not all about what I want,my plans. 00:26:50 It&apos;s about advancingthe kingdom. 00:26:52 It&apos;s about impacting others. 00:26:53 Sometimes god is goingto interrupt our plansso we can be a blessingto somebody else,so we can meet a need, so we canlift somebody&apos;s spirits. 00:27:02 God uses people. 00:27:03 It&apos;s up to you and me to not getso stressedand so frustrated that we missthe opportunities god bringsacross our path. 00:27:09 God is counting on us to letour light shineand make a difference whereverwe go. 00:27:20 It&apos;s interesting, manyof the miracles jesus performedhappened when he wasinterrupted. 00:27:26 Walking down the street, a blindman hollered out,&quot;jesus! have mercy! 00:27:30 &quot;jesus didn&apos;t say,&quot;don&apos;t you know I&apos;m the sonof god? 00:27:35 I&apos;ve got a lot&quot;no, jesus stopped what he wasdoing,went out of his way and healedthe man. 00:27:43 Jesus was willing to beinconvenienced to help otherpeople in need. 00:27:48 On his way to galilee, a mancame up and said,&quot;sir, my daughter is very closeto death. 00:27:52 &quot;
