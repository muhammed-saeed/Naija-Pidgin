Dhaka [M] is a thriving, colorful and congested metropolis of some 18 million people, and growing steadily. Given the number and density of people that live there, Dhaka is one of the most frenetic places on Earth. The streets and rivers are filled with colorful chaos. It also plays host to the highest number of rickshaws in any city, totaling around 400,000; you certainly won&apos;t miss them. Experiencing the city for the first time can often seem overwhelming.

According to recorded history it was founded in 1608 A.D. as the seat of the imperial Mughal viceroy of Bengal. Dhaka [M] has been developing fast as a modern city and is the country&apos;s center of industrial, commercial, cultural, educational and political activity. The gap between rich and poor is widening throughout the country but it&apos;s at its most glaringly obvious here. Depending on where you start from, a thirty minute rickshaw ride can take you from impossibly crowded shantytowns near Old Dhaka to the glitzy high-class neighborhoods of Gulshan and Banani where a meal costs more than most people make in a week.

Motijheel is the main commercial area of the city. Dhaka&apos;s main waterfront, Sadarghat [S] , is on the banks of the river Buriganga in Old Dhaka [M] and is crowded with various ferries, yachts, paddle steamers, fisherman&apos;s boats and floating dhabas all bustling with activity.

The weather [S] is tropical - hot and very humid during the monsoon season (April-August) and drier and cooler in the winter (October-March). Visitors from colder countries might want to visit in the winter when temperatures are around 20C and humidity is low (around 60-70%).

 Visa extensions are available at the Immigration and Passport Office on Agargaon Rd in Central Dhaka [M] . Most drivers know where it is. An auto-rickshaw from Old Dhaka will cost about Taka (BDT)150. Su-Th 10AM-1PM receiving applications, 3-5PM delivery.

 Italic text ===By air===

 Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport [S] ( Formally known as Zia International Airport) ( ICAO : DAC ) is well served by international flights from most continents. Biman Bangladesh Airlines is the national carrier of Bangladesh; which is well connected in 18 international destination. Mainly in Middle East also Malaysia , Singapore , Thailand and also Indian Subcontinent.

 Indian Airlines [S] , Jet Air has direct flights from Kolkata / Delhi / Mumbai . Pakistan International Airlines has direct flights from Pakistan. Thai Airways [S] also has direct flights from Bangkok
There are also gateways from Nepal on GMG Airlines [S] and Bangladesh Biman , Hong Kong on Dragon Air [S] , Malaysia , Singapore , Delhi, Kunming and Kolkata. You can also travel to Dhaka [M] from Middle East by Gulf Air, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, Kuwait Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Yemenia, and Both Dhaka&amp; Chittagong [M] by Bahrain Air, Turkish Airlines, Oman Air and Air Arabia.

Shahjalal airport is modern and reasonably efficient. However, half the world&apos;s mosquitoes seem to live in the baggage reclaim area, so be sure to wear long sleeves and covered legs/feet.
Also note that immigration takes a lot of time during peak hours (minimum 30-45 mins) as the system is manual and there are only 2 lines for foreign passport holders.
 
By bus
 
Being the capital and geographical center of the country, Dhaka [M] is the natural hub for the country&apos;s bus companies. There are several bus stations around Dhaka, and which one you need to be at depends where you want to go, so ask around before heading out to one of them. Most are as crowded as you would expect them to be(because of population).

 Sayedabad bus station [S] is useful for buses to the eastern half of the country including Sylhet [M] Division and Chittagong [M] Division.

 Gabtali bus station [S] serves most of the western half of the country including Jessore [M] , Rajshahi [M] Division and Khulna [M] Division.

 Mohakhali bus station [S] serves mainly to Tangail [M] , Mymonsing and other northern districts of Dhaka [M] . Sometimes also Bagura and other western-northern part of Bangladesh .

 Luxury buses [S] like Green Line [S] , Shyamoli [S] , Silk Line and Shohagh serve the major cities and tourist attractions. They all have a few offices around town, the most central being those near the Eastern Hotel on Inner Circular Rd in Central Dhaka [M] , just north of the Motijheel area. Green Line serves Chittagong [M] (400 taka, 5-6 hours), Cox&apos;s Bazar [M] (630 taka, 8-9 hours), Rajshahi [M] ( Tk 350, 4 hours), Sylhet [M] (Tk 400, 5 hours), Khulna [M] (Tk 450, 7 hours) and Jessore [M] ( Tk 400, 5-6 hours) in its comfortable Volvo buses. It also has a couple of super luxury Scania buses to Chittagong (Tk 550) and Cox&apos;s Bazar (Tk 850) if you feel comfortable floating through a developing country in high style and have enough taka to spend(however the money spent could go towards helping develop Bangladesh more). Seats are huge and fully recline. The quality of these buses are comparable to Business class of an airline!! (there are also Hino A/C luxury buses as well as Volvo and Scania). Recently, the S.Alam and the Saudia, two of the leading (non-ac) bus service providers have jointly launched a Mercedes-Benz luxury bus service to Chittagong, Cox&apos;s Bazar and some other major cities. One of the ticket counters has been opened at the Panthapath, an area where you can locate all major luxury bus ticket counters.

From India there are a number of land entry points for Buses [S] . The most common way is the regular comfortable a/c buses from Kolkata to Dhaka [M] via the Haridaspur [S] / Benapole [S] border post. Private bus companies Shohagh , Green Line [S] , Shyamoli [S] and others operate daily bus services. Government buses run under the label of the state owned West Bengal Surface Transport Service Corporation (WBSTSC) and the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC). WBSTSC and BRTC both operate buses from Kolkata every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 5:30AM and 8:30AM, and 12:30PM while from Dhaka they leave on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7:00AM and 7:30AM. The normal journey time is around 12 hours with a one-way fare of Indian Rs.550 or Tk.600-800, (roughly $8-12). If you&apos;re only headed to Haridaspur the fare is Rs.86, or Tk 116. The journey should take around 2.30 hours.
 
By boat
 
Most ferries arrive at and leave from Sadarghat [S] in Old Dhaka [M] . This area and the streets surrounding it are unbelievably hectic so allow plenty of time and watch your bags and pockets carefully. If arriving here, fight your way to the left on the frontage road and then make your first right - this turns into Nawabpur Road and leads north to the hotels. Even if you aren&apos;t staying in this area, it&apos;s easier to walk several hundred meters north to catch an onward rickshaw, the ones near the ghat are at a standstill.

The Rocket Steamers [S] (P.S. &apos;Tern&apos;, &apos;Masud&apos; and &apos;Ostrich&apos;) run to Barisal [S] [M] and Khulna [M] several times per week, departing from Sadarghat [S] around 6pm. To Barisal is Tk 480/300 in first/second class, while all the way to Khulna will run Tk 1010/610 and take 26-30 hours. Tickets should be booked at the BIWTC office in Motijheel just east of Dilkusha Circle I. It&apos;s open until 5PM Su-W and until 2PM on Thursdays, closed on Fridays. A quick heads-up in that the link to the BIWTC tariff mentioned above is in &apos;Takas&apos; and one should double check the fares.

 Chandpur [S] is the second major river station 3 to 4 hours journey from Dhaka [M] and 5 to 6 hours Journey from Barisal [S] [M] .

Multiple other boats are available for short and long distances - head to Sadarghat [S] or Badam Tole ghat (about 1 km further west) and ask around. Tickets aren&apos;t pre-sold, and bargaining is likely necessary.
 
Get around
 [ top ] 
Given the plethora of all forms of transport, if you&apos;re having trouble getting a decent fare with a driver walk a few feet to the next one. Not all are out to gouge you, so better to find the honest ones and give them your business. Occasionally a driver will demand more money on arrival - the best way to deal with this is to hand over the agreed fare/metered fare and walk away. Make certain from the start that the driver knows where you&apos;re headed (unless you can direct him yourself) - they often have limited local knowledge, but will always SAY that they know where somewhere is and take you round the whole city searching whilst the meter ticks. Make sure that you take a card with your hotel or hostel on it so that you can actually get home - many of the drivers do not even know where the more touristy sites are let alone the hotels so they will have to ask people at the side of the road. Having a card for the hotel with the actual address makes this a whole lot easier.

 Cycle-rickshaws [S] are the most popular form of transport, and good for short distances -- mainly on side streets. They make up the bulk of the cities horrendous traffic, and charge around BDT.5 per kilometer. Negotiating a fare beforehand is essential as a foreigner. Cycle-rickshaws in wealthy areas such as Banani and Gulshan often must pay local mafia men for the privilege of servicing the high-price areas. Additionally, foreigners should also be warned that cycle-rickshaws will sometimes begin the ride with a pitch to sell drugs or prostitutes. One or two simple, but firm, declines will generally solve the situation. If you&apos;re a woman -- it&apos;s particularly inadvisable to ride around alone in cycle-rickshaws after dark -- you&apos;re a slow-moving target asking for trouble from thugs and muggers. 

 Auto-rickshaws [S] (also known as &apos;CNG&apos;) are also abundant and have meters, which drivers can sometimes be persuaded to use. They&apos;re the cheapest way to cover longer distances - an 8km ride from Old Dhaka [M] to Gulshan should cost around Tk 70. The meters start at Tk 13.50, but for shorter distances you&apos;ll likely have to negotiate a fare instead. The city does become very congested at times so allow plenty of time for getting around. 

 Taxis [S] also ply the roads, some yellow and some black, all with meters. Black taxis start the meter at Tk 15 while yellow taxis are a little nicer and start at Tk 20. Black taxis are typically in notoriously poor condition and lack air conditioning. Yellow taxis are required to have air conditioning, (they consist of Toyota Corollas mostly, Mitsubishis or Hondas even). They are also considered far safer by the local Dhaka [M] elite. (when compared to black taxis and auto-rickshaws). 

 Buses [S] run routes on the main roads, but are horribly crowded and noisy, signed only in Bengali and aren&apos;t likely to be of much use to travelers. Save yourself a headache and take a rickshaw or if you go to far distance, take a comfortable, luxurious A/C bus or a train!!

 Sonargaon [S] 

If you feel the need to escape and take a break from the chaos of Dhaka [M] , Songargon, about 29 km. from Dhaka offers you the chance to do just that. The town has a few worthwhile sights that are separated from one another and whilst going from sight to sight, you have the opportunity experience rural life and take in the less chaotic surroundings.

 Sonargaon [S] is one of the oldest capitals of Bengal. It was the seat of Deva Dynasty until the 13th century. From then onward till the advent of the Mughals, Sonargaon was a subsidiary capital of the Sultanate of Bengal. The main places of interest in Sonargaon are the ruins of Panam Nagar, the local crafts museum or the Lok Shilpa Jadughar (charges an entrance fee), the tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin, the Goaldi Mosque, and the shrines of Panjpir and Shah Abdul Alia. The first two lie on one side of the Dhaka-Chittgong Highway and the rest lie on the other side. Once at Mograpara, a rickshaw may be hired for sightseeing. It is best to hire the same rickshaw for a fixed amount (BDT 200-250) to visit all the places in Sonargaon. Most rickshaw pullers know the more popular destinations like Panam Nagar, the Lok Shilpa Jadughar, etc. Some may not know of the tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin or the Goaldi Mosque and the shrines. Usually rickshaw drivers who are locals from the village know all of these places.

Frequent bus services to Sonargaon [S] operate from Gulistan, Saidabad and other bus stands in Dhaka [M] . Tickets may be bought on roadside counters. Mention your destination as Mograpara as you might end up at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel instead. The price of the ticket from Gulistan bus stand is Tk 35.

Hajiganj is another place of historical interest, situated about 10 kms from Mograpara bus stand. However, the above mentioned places usually take up most of the day and it is best to return to Dhaka [M] before evening. Sonargaon [S] and Hajiganj may be combined into a single day if one sets off very early from Dhaka.

 Ahsan Manzil Museum [S] : On the bank of the river Buriganga in Dhaka [M] the pink majestic Ahsan Manzil has been renovated and turned into a museum recently. It is an example of the nation&apos;s rich cultural heritage. It was the home of the Nawab of Dhaka and a silent spectator to many events. The renovated Ahsan Manzil is a monument of immense historical beauty. It has 31 rooms with a huge dome atop which can be seen from miles around. It now has 23 galleries displaying portraits, furniture and household articles and utensils used by the Nawab.

Last but not least, a rewarding experience is simply traveling by a horse driven cart or rickshaw along the busy Dhaka [M] streets and observing the local everyday scenes.
 
Buy
 [ top ] 
If you go shopping ready to bargain then there are certainly bargains to be had among the bazars and markets of Dhaka [M] . To get a feel for what things should cost in the local markets check prices in the western-style fixed price shops and then deduct 10%. If you prefer hassle free shopping then head to Bashundhara City [S] , a huge shopping center with more modern shops and other ameniteis you would expect to find in a mall.

 Banga (or Bango) Bazar [S] , is a block west of the Gulistan bus station on Kamruzzaman Sharani Street at the edge of Old Dhaka [M] . For shopaholics this is probably a paradise but for others it can be a nightmare. There are thousands of small stalls intersected by narrow walkways which are often jammed with people. The quality varies widely but the prices can be cheap, cheap, cheap, after you bargain vigorously. Try US$1 for a T-shirt, US$3 for blue jeans and US$5 for jackets. However, this is not a market for the brand conscious. 

 New Market [S] on Mirpur Road in Dhanmondi, just west of Dhaka [M] University. This is the largest market in the city and it has more class, more room and just as much choice. Prices may be a little higher because the stall rent is likely to be more expensive. As well as clothing, there is leather, linen, jewelry, household goods, CDs and DVDs and so on. It is normally closed on Tuesdays. 

 Bashundhara City [S] on Pantha Path just west of the Pan Pacific Hotel. This multi-story complex is the closest replica of the malls found in Asia. It is the newest and most modern place to shop in the city with small shops spanning over a whopping 10 floors. 

 Garment seconds , Banga Bazar and Pallwell Market ( BB: Gulistan area, just West of Motijheel); PM: Purana Paltan area (just beside Jonaki Cinema Hall ). Many items only have minor defects, but do not meet export requirements.   

 Pink Pearls . Available in many handicraft stores, with some dedicated outlets in Gulshan   

 Aarong , [2] . A well known chain with several outlets around Dhaka [M] and one in London . It is owned by BRAC (the largest Development Organization in the world) and sells handicrafts and clothing at moderately high prices.   

 Aranya , 60 Kemal Ataturk, Banani . Another good store with beautiful crafts. Supports fair trade practices.   . 
 
Eat
 [ top ] 
Dhaka [M] has an enormous variety of food catering to all budgets. Old Dhaka is overflowing with cheap Bangladeshi food where a meal can be had from Tk 50 ($0.70), while in the upscale neighborhoods like Gulshan and Banani you can find just about any type of cuisine you can imagine - Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, Greek, Mexican, and franchises such as Pizza Hut [S] , KFC are abundant - at prices that the majority can&apos;t afford. Reservations are usually not required in most restaurants. A lot of the Buffet-style restaurants in this neighborhood have Taka: 250 to 400, fixed price menu.

Local sweets (misti/mishti) like rasgullah and gulab jamun are excellent. To the uninitiated these are bite-sized soft milk curd balls dipped (drenched) in syrup, coming in white and red varieties. Shops throughout the town (and especially near Gulshan) sell imported condiments from the U.S., Dubai and Malaysia at a premium. Imported chocolate is especially expensive - and usually not in the best condition as it gets melted and re-solidified daily in the tropical heat. Fresh is better.

Be careful when buying food from street vendors as health and hygiene standards are not always topnotch. Unlike Bangkok -- street food in Dhaka [M] is only for locals. Foreigners should stick to larger, organized (and unfortunately a little expensive) food outlets.
 
Old and Central Dhaka
 
Restaurants are crammed throughout the narrow alleys and along the main streets - duck into one of them and you&apos;ll likely not to be too disappointed. A full meal will usually run less than a dollar, though fish will push it closer to two.

 Hotel Al-Razzaque , 29/1 North South Rd (Nazira Bazaar) , ☎ +880 2 956 1990 . On the ground floor of the hotel is a large and popular restaurant, busy anytime of the day with Bangladeshi families and businessmen. Food is pretty darn good, if unpredictable in its timing. Sometimes you&apos;ll have a choice of chicken and mutton curries, fish and vegetables, other times it&apos;s chicken biryani or the highway. Fish will double the price of your meal, at least. It&apos;s sandwiched between a clean and well-stocked juice bar and a clean and well-stocked sweet shop. Each plate cost 80 Taka. Tk50-150 .  Hajjee Beryani [S] in Nazira Bazar, close to Bango Bazar, old Dhaka [M] . Old Dhaka was famed for its lines of beryani restaurants. Some of the more famous outfits are still going and Hajjee Beryani is one of them. It revels in its eccentric reputation for opening only at certain times and only cooking a certain amount (well below demand) Hotel Star [S] Thathari bazar, Near Nawabpur Bazar. Does fantastic Beryani&amp;Goat Leg Roast (ask for it). Bismillah Kabab [S] Address-Nazira Bazar Jharna Grill , In Pan Pacific Sonargaon [S] Hotel , ☎ +880 2 811 1005 . The top restaurant in the hotel serves very good seafood. Expect to pay Tk 3,000 for a 3 course meal with drinks. The hotel has other good restaurants too.   Cafe Jheel , opposite the National press club . Serves good local dishes for the budget traveler. Expect to pay Tk 150-200 for a 3 course meal. Although you can possibly get lunch/dinner for as low as Tk 60.   
 
Gulshan/Banani
 
These areas are packed with crowded trendy and upscale restaurants, a magnet for the Dhaka [M] elite who like good food or just want to be seen in their shiny new sedans.

 Bamboo Shoot , Gulshan avenue ( upstairs from Agora department store ). A Chinese/Thai restaurant that prides itself in offering &apos;authentic&apos; cuisine, and this is backed up by the number of Chinese expats seen eating there on any given night.   

 Half Past Eleven , House 67/C, Road 11, Block E, Banani ( take Banani Road 11 eastward towards Gulshan bridge, the restaurant will be on your left before the junction of Road 11 and Road 12 ), ☎ 029884215, 01678131590 , [3] . 11AM-11PM daily .

Drink
 [ top ] 
There is a party network between the different expat clubs (Dutch Club, Canadian Club, Nordic Club, International Club, American Club, etc.) and some Bangladeshi clubs (Heritage, Privilege, etc.). These clubs usually require membership to enter, or befriend a member and have them sign you in. From there, you can purchase a book of tickets or a cash card and then use it to order your drinks.

Although alcohol is most easily available at the international clubs and top hotels, there are quite a few local places to find a drink for the enterprising traveler. Local bars are to be found in most neighborhoods but can be difficult to locate due to lack of advertising. Popular brands of beer (Heineken, Carlsberg, Tuborg, Foster&apos;s etc) and major types of liquor are available at these places, and at much lower prices than at hotel bars.

You can try:

 La Diplomat [S] at Road 20, House number 7, near Gulshan 1. Don&apos;t expect to be rubbing shoulders with any French ambassadors, however. The Dip [S] , like most other Bengali bars, is a smoke-filled darkened room where many of its patrons would rather not be recognized too easily. Definitely an experience, nonetheless. Beers cost upwards of Tk 150 and &quot;tots,&quot; which are single ounce servings of gin, vodka or whiskey, are available from Tk 70(local brands)-Tk 200. Female patrons may feel slightly uncomfortable. 

There is a duty paid shop in Mohakhali which is only permitted to sell alcohol to passport-bearing foreigners or their drivers who bring their passports in when they purchase. The address is 12 Abbas Garden, New Airport Road, phone +88 2 988 1936-9. Their stated opening hours are from 9:30pm - 4:30pm, and closed on Fridays. To get there you need to go towards the flyover as if you were going to Banani, but instead of going on to the flyover, you take the second left after it begins. You will see a small sign labelled &quot;Abbas Garden.&quot; Turn left and tell your transport to wait while you purchase.

Stay safe
 [ top ] 
Dhaka [M] isn&apos;t terribly unsafe, but as in any huge city you should keep aware of your surroundings and try not to walk around at night, especially females travelling alone. There&apos;s a very large number of people living on next to nothing in the city, and while the vast majority are friendly there&apos;s undoubtedly a few that would love to help you part with some of your seemingly abundant wealth.

There has been a recent rash of incidents (as of July 2007) in which some foreigners have been targeted for bag snatchings while riding rickshaws. Often these have occurred at night, after 11pm. If you must be out after this time please do your best to leave your valuables at your friends&apos; places or hotel and you can pick them up in the morning. The simplest way to reduce your potential loss is to not leave with valuables in the first place if you anticipate the need to travel after 11pm. The safest mode for travel for a tourist is to hire a yellow cab. These can rented for a trip as well as by the day. Be sure to write down the license plate number.

The greatest danger probably comes from speeding buses and rickshaws - keep well alert when walking along main roads.

Being the capital, it&apos;s the area most affected during hartals , and you should do your best to keep a low profile during times of political unrest. Avoid any sort of large gatherings, even positive ones, as there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll become the center of attention and you probably don&apos;t want that from a group of raucous chanters.

 Pollution [S] (like most other cities in the subcontinent)is high. It&apos;s not uncommon to see people with face masks on, and at the very least you should carry a handkerchief with you to cover your mouth and nose during rickshaw rides.
