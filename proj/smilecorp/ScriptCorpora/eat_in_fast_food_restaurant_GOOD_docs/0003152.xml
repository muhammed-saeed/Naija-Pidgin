What Is Wrong With People?
 By slappyintheface | Jun 13, 2011 | 51 Tweet 
Last night as my husband and I were sitting at a fast food restaurant waiting on our order to be ready, a young man and young woman came in and placed their order. When they went to the drink station to fill their cups, the young man knocked over a stack of plastic lids. I watched him do it, I knew that it was him. I kept waiting for him to bend over and pick them up. I so wanted to hope that he would do the right thing and not just leave them in the floor. He didn&apos;t. He finished filling his cup. He stood there and talked to the young woman that was with him. His order came up, his number was called, and they walked out ... the lids still lying on the floor.

I thought about this small incident for quite a while after we left the restaurant and wondered why it was bothering me so much. I wondered if that had been one of my sons, would they have picked up the mess that they had made. Would they have bothered to take 5 seconds out of their day to right a wrong that they had created? Would the girl that was with them have pointed it out?

I realize that it isn&apos;t a really big thing in the grand scheme of life, but maybe the world would be a better place if we all started to take more responsibility for our actions. On Saturday as we were driving down the Interstate on our way to a family trip, somebody veered over into our lane going way too fast. We swerved and came really close to hitting the concrete divider in the middle of the road. The driver that almost hit us didn&apos;t even slow down. She looked right at us and sped off. I have to wonder if she would have even bothered to stop had we rammed into the concrete divider, or was her hurried trip to Wal-Mart more important than the safety of other people on the road?

I hope that we are raising our children to be responsibly caring people, but what if my children don&apos;t bother to pick up after themselves or think that anything they are speeding off to do is more important than the other people on the road? As a society are we becoming so selfish that we just don&apos;t care about each other? What happened to&quot;please&quot;and&quot;thank you&quot;? Where has kindness gone?

 June 13, 2011, 8:42 am Shana in Texas says: I see the same type of behavior and makes me wonder if courtesy has completely flown out the window? I would have picked-up those lids! I probably would have picked them up if I came along later, too, just to be helpful to the business. Yesterday I was also almost hit while driving because some idiot young woman was too busy on her cell phone to check the lane before moving into it. She didn&apos;t even flinch when I honked!

 June 13, 2011, 8:44 am Anne Katherine says: I think about this all the time when I notice how much garbage is on the side of the roads...I mean it&apos;s not just a few people doing it (obviously, if you&apos;ve ever looked) - there are a ton of people out there who behave that way... and I too, can only cross my fingers about my children -- after all, they have to make their own decisions...and the fact is that if so many are doing it...that makes others thinks it&apos;s okay, or not so bad...and so it goes. But I hold out hope that it will never be the majority behaving this way! Log in to reply

 June 13, 2011, 9:01 am Alexandra White says: I think there is a level of disconnection in our culture sometimes that makes people think their small gestures don&apos;t matter. But as you point out, they do--they show us that we are part of a community, that we care enough to clean up our own messes. It is sad to hear examples like this, but I think the most hope we have to raise our children to be responsible people, as you suggest. Let&apos;s hope, as Anne suggests, they become the majority.

 June 15, 2011, 8:30 am gabs417 says: Instead of handing the lids to him, I would have yelled out from my seat&quot;Excuse me, you over by the soda machine, I think you dropped somthing!&quot;Maybe by doing that, he might think the next time and pick up the stuff without incident. . . .nothing more embarassing then pointing it out in public (but in a nice way, of course).

 September 2, 2011, 1:43 am foolishdreamer says: That is exactly how I get into trouble! My husband often tells me I have no filter left. My thoughts just pop right out of my mouth when they&apos;re only halfway through my processor/brain. I think that people who behave carelessly and without consideration need someone with no filter. I&apos;ll probably get smacked or shot or something one of these days. I&apos;ll still help an ignorant person pick up their lids anyway, kinda double down and hope for guilt and embarassment to compel personal responsibility. Whatever it takes, right?

 June 13, 2011, 9:58 am Dfallis says: We spent most of Saturday morning, replanting into a small garden, only to awaken Sunday morning to dog prints and a smashed plant. In the country, what we see a lot of is people that think nothing of dumping their out-of-control pet on residents that did nothing to deserve it. We spent all day Sunday building a make-shift fence--that we hadn&apos;t planned to put around the garden--because other people dump their responsibilities. It&apos;s not just the human children we raise that are causing destruction or practicing bad habits and wasteful techniques, the pets that children want that parents don&apos;t realize become their responsibility, as well. Kindness, courtesy, and respect for others, begins at home or it becomes everyone else nightmare. Log in to reply

 June 13, 2011, 10:20 am amitynichole says: My daughter would have told him to clean up his mess. She has absolutely no tolerance what-so-ever for people who litter or otherwise don&apos;t pick up after themselves (her bedroom, however, is a different beast). 

Grace and Courtesy is no longer expected or taught to the general public. We are very lucky that in our school (a Montessori school) Grace and Courtesy is taught in everything the kids do. From the time they are tiny until they leave in 6th grade. If everyone took this approach, what you experienced on Saturday would be a rare occurance instead of the norm. Log in to reply

 June 14, 2011, 8:29 am amitynichole says: We are very fortunate that some amazing people came together to write a charter for a school. We attended private Montessori for 3 years but the tuition kept increasing. Last school year was the first year for the charter Montessori school. It was far and away a better experience than our private school and it is FREE. We are so thankful that we have 3 more glorious years to spend in this school before jr. high. Log in to reply 
 June 14, 2011, 12:46 pm Dfallis says: That&apos;s great...I really wish more people would look into them, as they would find it a far-preferable alternative to public schools. Log in to reply 

 
 
 
 June 13, 2011, 10:44 am Peanut22 says: Now here&apos;s a question, who wound up cleaning the lids up? 

I hate when people make a mess in a public place and don&apos;t clean it up and expect someone to do it for them. Really grinds my gears. Manners and cleanliness all out the window. I&apos;d hate to see where some of these people live. Log in to reply

 June 13, 2011, 11:01 am 79mommy23 says: A whole lot of&quot;little things&quot;are what add up to a big deal IMO. I would have been both surprised and not at behavior like this, mostly just disappointed. Sometimes people suck is all. If I saw this happen, I would have picked them up (I think) :) Now I would for sure. Log in to reply 

 June 13, 2011, 12:26 pm Denise Spooner says: Loved your post Slappy, I feel the same way. It shocks me sometimes when I see grown adults doing the most irresponsible things and acting like tens again. I don&apos;t understand it. What seems so natural for some I suppose don&apos;t even come to mind for others. We can raise our children to know the truth, be honest, respectful, caring, responsible and loving individuals, but surely they will make up their own minds whether they want to do the right thing or not in the end. We just gotta pray our own convictions have settled in their hearts enough to take root as adults. You got my vote! Log in to reply 

 June 13, 2011, 12:40 pm JenH says: Slappy, I couldn&apos;t agree more. It&apos;s very sad to see what we have all become when it comes to choosing to be polite or choosing to be rude. Great post! Log in to reply 

 June 13, 2011, 2:10 pm Tammy Mommy says: Slappy, those kinds of things bother me, too! My oldest is only 2, but he&apos;s learning to say&quot;please&quot;and&quot;thank you,&quot;&amp;to put his sippy cups on coasters. He also throws things (sometimes the wrong things!) in the garbage at home,&amp;it&apos;s a little confusing when he notices litter in a parking lot or&quot;fuzzies&quot;at the mall,&amp;we don&apos;t want him to pick them up. (He sucks his fingers, so his picking up others&apos;trash seems like a bad idea, for now.) I want him to be helpful, though. Any tips?

I once had a discussion with a mom of teenaged boys whose sons might have thrown the lids you spoke of onto the floor, even in front of a blind person. When her sons&apos;bad manners&amp;messiness came up, she responded with&quot;We choose our battles.&quot;If a person is okay with their kids&apos;being lazy and selfish, I don&apos;t think they&apos;ve chosen well. Log in to reply 
 June 13, 2011, 2:45 pm slappyintheface says: &quot;We choose our battles&quot;..... oh yeah .. I choose to not pick up after my teenage children, because 1. I am not their personal maid and 2. I refuse to raise complete slobs.If my children leave their trash on the counter, I make them come pick it up ... I don&apos;t care if they are watching TV, in the shower, or asleep when I find it ... I yell (yes - I sometimes yell at my children) at them and tell them that they don&apos;t want me to have to clean it up. I do the same thing with their bedrooms ... I have only had to clean their rooms once, because when I clean them anything that goes in the big trash bag NEVER comes back out. Log in to reply

 June 13, 2011, 11:13 pm ImGeege says: People don&apos;t care anymore. Gone are the days of&quot;doing the right thing&quot;just cause it&apos;s right. Sometimes it seems the only time people do the right thing is if they realize someone is watching and they might get called on their bad behaviour. I&apos;m glad to hear that people are still raising kids who know it&apos;s proper to pick up after themselves and take care of things! Log in to reply

 June 14, 2011, 12:13 pm Shawna says: You just reinforced my often wavering conviction that homeschooling is the right choice for us. My best shot at building my children&apos;s character is to spend as much time as possible with them before they are adults, out in the world on their own, Mommy and Daddy somewhat forgotten. Hopefully what we instill today will last forever, even if their undying love and longing for their parents wanes as they age and&quot;outgrow&quot;us. ... Thank you for this moving post. Parenting is the most important job there is. But I&apos;m slightly biased. : ) Log in to reply

 June 14, 2011, 12:38 pm Teresa Thomas says: Slapintheface, I like this comment. I quite agree with you 100% on this matter. I don&apos;t know where our society is going these days. Gee people, what&apos;s just a few seconds out of your way to pick up something that you had knocked over? Its not like your food is going to be going anywhere. Yes, it just might get a little cold, but, are you too worried about your food getting too cold to pick something up? Give us decent folks a break...... Where is common courtesy these days? I believe, that we live in a society, that does not know the word courtesy anymore. It saddens me to see where our world is going to. Log in to reply 

 June 14, 2011, 12:41 pm Teresa Thomas says: slappyintheface, I work at a fast food place called Jack In The Box. At the moment, I&apos;m taking time off away from there due to personal issues. I know just what you mean. We&apos;ve seen it all the time. I wished, that people would be more careful in where they are looking at and where they are walking to. It don&apos;t take but a second to just bend down and pick them up. Log in to reply 
 June 14, 2011, 2:20 pm slappyintheface says: Maybe those of us who pick up after ourselves (and make our kids do it too) shouldn&apos;t be so nice about it when we see others not being responsible. Maybe I should have said something to the&quot;lid guy&quot;. I am kind of wishing now that I had. Log in to reply

If I was there, I would have intimidated the guy with my loudest gangsta voice and said,&quot;Yo, you gonna pick that up? I&apos;ll make you an offer you can&apos;t refuse.. Now go pick that up...&quot;Well, no, not really. It would be fun though. :D

 June 14, 2011, 9:23 pm Teresa Thomas says: Daniel, I think that, that would not have been a bad idea. I&apos;d probably have done the same thing. I work at a fast food place and it is very disturbing to see people just knock off lids like that. I get frustrated when people do things like that. Some times, I have found myself asking the person,&quot;hey, are you going to pick that up?&quot;I get this strange look from them as if to say, you work here. That&apos;s what you get paid for. Then, they walk away. Very frustrating I can tell you. Log in to reply 

 June 14, 2011, 11:48 pm Jarwain says: Its laziness, In my opinion. Nobody wants to work, nobody wants to take responsibility for their actions, nobody wants to expend the small amount of energy that is needed to make this world a better place. Its just too much work. 
And this is coming from someone who is generally lazy. :d
Of course, I personally would pick it up, because I&apos;d feel responsible for knocking it down in the first place. It&apos;s just not right. 
Then again, all I can do is talk, talk, and talk some more. Its your actions that count. But when you act, who&apos;s there to see it? Log in to reply

 June 15, 2011, 10:34 am Dayle Fraschilla says: Those&quot;little things&quot;bother me too! I am doing my best to raise my daughter to do the right thing, no matter how insignificant it might seem. I often talk about living in a trash can --- my street is disgusting; there&apos;s litter everywhere. I clean up in front of my house only to walk out an hour later and see that the wind has blown the trash right back. It takes little to no effort to throw your own trash away - it takes an enormous effor to clean up after the 100&apos;s of people who make a mess. Take the lids for instance . . . it would have taken that man a few moments to pick them up. Now if someone comes behind him and steps on those lids, kicks those lids, etc - they&apos;re now all over the place, making it more work to clean them up. It&apos;s about common courtesy, and I am strong believer in&quot;the little things matter&quot;! (I have a pet project in the works about common courtesy - about saying thank you for the little things - if you&apos;re interested, I&apos;ll let you know when it is up and ready to go!)

The lady did not even say,&quot;thank you.&quot;That flew all over my husband. I told him that our society has gotten so used to others being rude and uncaring that we don&apos;t know how to behave when someone does something nice. Sad, isn&apos;t it? Log in to reply

 June 17, 2011, 8:46 am Guru says: I agree 100%. I dont think it just young people. Well I am young. 
Just yesterday at a mall, I saw a man kick a sign that read&quot;watch for wet floor&quot;.
He kicked the sign all the way down the escalator. And left without picking it up.
May be he is confident that he is not going to fall down.
But what about old folks that could have stepped on the wet spot on the escalator.
I picked up the sign and went all the way back in the escalator and left the sign at the top.
Its really shocking how someone can behave. Just because you can, you shouldnt. Log in to reply

 July 4, 2011, 2:37 pm Joe Mae says: I can&apos;t remember the last time I went to a shopping center or similar place and didn&apos;t see carts just lying in parking spaces. It boggles my mind how someone can simply cast his/;her cart into a spot and drive off without caring; the only people with a legitimate excuse for such a gesture are the handicapped, the elderly or those with a true emergency to attend to. I&apos;m not perfect, and neither is anyone else, but I wouldn&apos;t think of doing such a lazy and inconsiderate thing as leaving a cart in a parking space, and I don&apos;t understand why anyone else would be okay with doing so either.
