 Bankruptcy vs simply not paying?

Brief background: Moved from 1 state to another for a job , which was lost. Income has dropped to about 50% of what it was. We’ve gone through our savings to try and pay things. take home pay now covers merely new house payment, utilities, groceries, life insurance, and government student loan. Have previously surrendered 2nd vehicle, (1st vehicle is paid in full). Old house in old state foreclosed on and being sold tomorrow. Credit cards remaining unpaid and sent for collections, etc.

My question is this: should bankruptcy proceedings begin or should we continue as is? What, if anything, can our creditors do to us (other than trash our credit –which has already happened). We live in Texas. I would appreciate some comments. However please refrain from replies such as&quot;get a job &quot;, because we are both working full time jobs and have cut some unnecessary spending. We dread the thought of bankruptcy, but see no other alternative.
We’ve done the credit counseling , etc., and the funds are simply not there.

Can they garnish wages for debt in Texas?

Thanks for the replies so far–I appreciate it.
The 1 vehicle we have is paid in full and is a 1999 Ford Ranger–not new. Excellent comments everyone–thanks!
