 &quot;Filling, Tasty, Vegan&quot;   My Rating

 Posted on: Sunday, August 07, 2011 Review: In the Akasaka / Tameike-Sanno area there are limited choices when it comes to having a vegan lunch. The pita sandwiches made at Pita the Great are tasty, filling and satisfying. The shop&apos;s interior is all white, breezy, minimalist and cool. The owner is a freindly guy who seems to take his business seriously, making sure that his customers are happy and fulfilled. What&apos;s not to like? My co-worker (who is a Japanese female) says that she finds the sandwhich big enough to keep a portion for later as a snack; for me (I am a North American vegan guy), the portion is just fine and really hits the spot as a tasty vegan lunch.

 Pros: Tasty * Satisfying portions * classic rock playing in store
 Cons: Parts of sandwich are deep-fried * *

 Posted on: Monday, February 28, 2011 Review: Really neat place. It&apos;s pretty easy to find from the directions, just take exit 12 at the Tameike Sanno station and go up and out of the ATT building.
The pitas are really tasty and really big. I really liked the eggplant pita and the big (falafel) pita. And if you order the side of falafels they&apos;re really tasty too.
The guy who runs it is really friendly and speaks English well (but Japanese as well). And it&apos;s really nice when it&apos;s rainy, it&apos;s all warm and cosy.
One interesting point though. All three times I went there in the 2 weeks I was in Japan, he&apos;d have on disc two of Led Zeppelin remasters. Either he REALLY REALLY likes Led Zeppelin or his CD player is broken and he can&apos;t get the CD out. Anyone else notice this? Either way, it didn&apos;t bother me. Achilles Last Stand is a good song to eat falafels to. 
  
 Pros: Really tasty * Good Value *
 Cons: The Led Zeppelin thing could be a con * *

 Posted on: Wednesday, April 07, 2010 Review: I decided to go for a walk and find this place one day, because I was staying in Akasaka and read here that it was good. Wellll, after finding it eventually, I look inside the doors, and was really unsure whether I was in the right place or not.. This shop looked like it was under renovation or something crazy, dust and crap everywhere. It was about 4:30 in the afternoon, so I figured they&apos;d still be open even though I saw noone around. I opened the door, called out for someone.. Noone. Waited for about five minutes and finally some old guy comes out saying they&apos;re closed. Well, good job buddy, leaving the door open, and money on the bench. Gave up, went home disappointed. Shame &apos;cause the stuff on the menu sounded pretty good !

 • Hey, give the &quot;old guy&quot; a break, he runs the place himself and he trusts people enough to leave the door open. The food is good, and he is open for lunch (4:30 is lunch for you?) Before giving a low rating, perhaps you should try the food?. response by TokyoGuy

 Posted on: Wednesday, August 26, 2009 Review: This is a good place to grab a sandwich if you&apos;re in the area. They seem to have pretty early hours though and cater to the local businessfolk. 
  
 Pros: tasty * generous portions * fresh-baked
 Cons: * *

 Posted on: Sunday, June 14, 2009 Review: All vegan. A great range of pita options. Broccoli pita!! The pitas were good and the owner was really nice. It was a great filling lunch. I have a photo of my (omni) friend eating one of these in apparent ecstasy. :-) 
  
 Pros: 100% Vegan * Nice owner * Filling
 Cons: Outdoor seating only * *

 &quot;What a great!&quot;   My Rating

 Posted on: Wednesday, July 11, 2007 Review: The shop is vegan fast food restaurant. It&apos;s safety and shop staff is very friendly. After the order, he makes pita. Then, he used to use the fish in menu eight years ago. now, he don&apos;t use the fish and dairy products. He can speak both English and Japanese.
shop staff recommends that big pita and classic pita in menu. I ordered a classic pita and vage croquette. But he told me, vage croquette is included in classic pita. Oh my! I changed the order, so I tried classic pita(760yen) and traditional pita(630yen)
(to go). traditional pita is only five loaf bread. Let&apos;s try pita even in your house. I&apos;m surprised! A pita was my palmar size. too big! Maybe, you&apos;ll be full up for only once! The shop in ATT Building right above the subway 12th exit. turn right at the 12th exit. go straight and half round ATT building. (The shop is in the back in the ATT building)
So, the 12th exit is beside the entrance in ATT building.
Have fun!
