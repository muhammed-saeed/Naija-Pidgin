 Fast-casual eateries winning restaurant wars

Diners like fast-casual versions of sit-down restaurants such as Lucille&apos;s Rib Shack.
 
A new restaurant industry report tells us something penny-pinching foodies already know: we love fast-casual dining.

The fast-casual restaurant industry generated sales of $23 billion in 2010, up nearly 30 percent since 2006, according to a recent Mintel food service report.  The firm, which tracks restaurant industry trends, said the growth in this sector is admirable given the state of the economy.

So why do diners love fast casual dining? These counter-service restaurants (Panera Bread, Corner Bakery, Beach Pit BBQ) offer diners the quality of casual dining without the wait.  Food is ordered at a counter and served at a fast-food pace. And there’s no tip involved.  (Unless you count the cash register tip jar.) 

Prices range from $6 to $12 per person, making it slightly cheaper and more convenient than dining at a sit-down restaurant, Mintel said.
 
Homemade tortillas are a key quality difference at Cafe Rio.
 
These restaurants are coming on strong at lunch time with foot traffic“levels almost equaling that of casual dining”visitors, according to Mintel’s survey.

“The relatively new fast casual category has fared well through the recession as people can see the added value in the food and atmosphere, despite the slightly higher price point,” said Eric Giandelone, director of food service research at Mintel. “The majority of restaurant-goers say quality is the most important determinant in their choice of a restaurant, which will continue to help this category grow.”

In Orange County, fast-casual restaurant growth is taking off, especially in the barbecue, Mexican and sandwich categories.

Brands adding counter-service concepts over the past two years in O.C. include Lucille’s Rib Shack , Beach Pit BBQ , Cafe Rio , The Counter, Which Wich and Corner Fish Grill .

Many of the concepts are quick-serve versions of casual dining chains that have been hit hardest by the recession as diners trade down to cheaper fast-casual eats.

Irvine-based Mimi’s Cafe, for example, is testing a counter-service concept in Arizona. Last year, Lucille’s Smokehouse BBQ opened Lucille’s Rib Shack in Orange. The Costa Mesa parent company of King’s Fish House opened a fast-casual eatery in Huntington Beach called Fish Camp in the summer.

Still, going fast-casual didn’t work for Cafe Maiz, a sister concept to a string of  El Cholo restaurants in Orange and Los Angeles counties.

The counter-service Mexican restaurant opened three years ago in Mission Viejo.  But, soon after it opened, owner Ron Salisbury said he had to switch gears to increase sales.

He added more familiar El Cholo dishes and combo plates, and began  offering table service for diners who missed that experience.

“We thought we were saving people money, but we found people were still leaving tips on the table,”said Salisbury.

 Tell us: Do you find yourself eating more at fast-casual restaurants? If so, write in and let us know why these concepts appeal to you.
