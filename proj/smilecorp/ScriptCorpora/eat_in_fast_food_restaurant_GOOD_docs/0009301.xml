 Our site is based on the personal experience of one man&apos;s lifetime of being the owner of different restaurants, in different states, and different situations. Get recent information on food products, equipment, and tips from one
entrepreneur to another. Opportunities for discounts on services and products through major food distribution companies and related items. 



 Welcome! We&apos;ve developed this site for you, the Restaurant Entrepreneur, and filled it with information on food services, equipment and other products that can make running your business a little easier and successful.  

 Our founder, Ed Stefan, has decades of experience being his own boss and running successful restaurants starting from the ground up. Our mission is to share his product knowledge with you as well as give you the opportunity to browse through food distribution companies and other offers relating to running your restaurant. 

 The world of running your own restaurant is vast and complex and we have set out with the intention of bringing you unbiased product opinions. We find this crucial when first starting out or looking for new products, as some companies out there are just trying to sell their product, regardless of the quality, and are merely interested in the profit margin. 

 Keep in mind, our information is coming from a fellow entrepreneur, however, not all of our information may be right for you and your business. We try to stay true to you, the consumer and entrepreneur, our information, offers, and discounts have been reviewed and approved by Ed Stefan, and placed on this site to give you the opportunity to take advantage of this valuable information.
