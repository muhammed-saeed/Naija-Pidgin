 Is Subway Really Healthy Fast Food - Learn The 
 Truth About Subway Bread 

 
 

 You 
 know how I feel about Taco Bell&apos;s&quot;diet&quot;menu which is 
 called&quot;The Drive-Thru Diet.&quot;Let&apos;s face it, fast food 
 is never going to be health food, no matter how the corporations 
 try to package it. If you don&apos;t believe me, watch the documentary 
 Food, Inc. and find out where fast-food hamburgers and chicken are 
 really coming from. Fast food is a billion-dollar industry with 
 one goal-making money. These restaurants don&apos;t care about you or 
 your health. They just want you to keep coming back and spending 
 more and more money with them.

Which brings me to Subway. Is Subway fast food? I don&apos;t know. This 
 restaurant is known for touting the health benefits of its food. 
 It features the Fit Club Menu, a selection of six-inch subs that 
 come in at under six grams of fat. And then there&apos;s the Subway spokesperson, 
 Jared. Jared was a morbidly obese person who lost over 200 pounds 
 eating at Subway. That&apos;s great!

What Subway doesn&apos;t proclaim in its advertising, however, is the 
 ingredients it uses in its food. Sure, the company provides calories 
 and nutritional information (fat grams, sodium, cholesterol, etc.), 
 but every fast-food restaurant does that. It&apos;s the law. Subway&apos;s 
 veggies are definitely healthy for you, but you might not know that 
 there is a big problem with their bread.

When you order wheat bread at Subway, you aren&apos;t really getting 
 whole-wheat bread. It&apos;s enriched. This means that the wheat stalk 
 has been removed and processed, making it much cheaper to mass produce. 
 This type of wheat bread has essentially the same properties as 
 white bread.

The benefit of eating whole wheat and other whole grains is that 
 you receive a steady stream of energy, released over time and sustaining 
 you until the next time you eat. White, enriched, or processed bread 
 causes your blood sugar level to spike, giving you a quick burst 
 of energy followed by a crash. It also increases your obesity risk 
 and makes you feel terrible!

Fortunately, most people who eat at Subway don&apos;t eat the bread 
 alone. Instead, they top it with meat, veggies, and oils, which 
 help to even out the spike in blood sugar (especially the proteins). 
 Even so, this doesn&apos;t excuse the fact that Subway doesn&apos;t offer 
 healthy bread to its customers.

Follow this link to find a list 
 of the ingredients in Subway&apos;s breads .

Look at the 9-Grain Wheat Bread in particular. You would think 
 this would be the healthiest bread on the menu. For bread to be 
 considered whole wheat,&quot;whole wheat&quot;should be listed 
 as the first ingredient, not enriched wheat. And look at the fourth 
 ingredient-high fructose corn syrup! High fructose corn syrup is 
 so bad for you, it deserves its own article.

I heard about Subway&apos;s bread about five months ago, but just didn&apos;t 
 have time to do the research, or maybe I just didn&apos;t want to believe 
 it. Subway was a weekly thing for me. My usual order was the foot-long 
 chicken breast sub with spinach, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, 
 jalapenos, pickles, and olive oil. But since doing the research 
 about six weeks ago, I haven&apos;t been back!

No matter where you eat, take the time and respect your body enough 
 to find out exactly what you&apos;re getting!
