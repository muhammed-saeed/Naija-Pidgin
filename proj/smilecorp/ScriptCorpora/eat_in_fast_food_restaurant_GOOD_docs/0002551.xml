 Home About Company History 
 Company history. A tradition of customer care.

 

Our company was founded by Herman Shooster, who learned about customer care long before he started Global Response.

Herman Shooster began learning about customer care at the age of 12, pumping gas at his father’s gas station in Chester, Pennsylvania.

 

He served honorably as a Medic in the Pacific during World War II. When the war ended, Herman earned a B.A. in Marketing from Temple University. He’s been working as an entrepreneur ever since.

Long before anyone ever heard of McDonalds, Herman’s dad and his brothers built a full-service restaurant. (If only they had thought franchising!)

 

Then they expanded it into a drive-in restaurant, complete with a nightly radio talk show and live music. Think “Grease”, remember“Rock Around the Clock”by Bill Haley and the Comets? That was a regular gig. Shooster’s Drive-In was one of the places where rock music was born. The State eventually bought them out and used the land to build a bridge across the Delaware River.

Herman then entered the new frozen food industry, eventually becoming V.P. of National Food Marketing for a national frozen food company. But, Herman was a born entrepreneur. After a few years, he moved to Florida with his wife and kids, where he acquired a telephone answering service business named‘Ding-a-Ling’.

 

It’s a great name for a“mom-and-pop”answering service, but not much of a confidence builder when you are selling information technology enhanced services required for successful call center operation. That’s why the name morphed into Global Response, but don’t think the change is merely cosmetic. We still maintain the warm, friendly mom and pop disposition, but our innovative contact center systems meet the needs of the most demanding and sophisticated clients.

Today, Global Response is one of the world’s top outsourced contact centers, serving the most prestigious brands in retail, healthcare, finance and tourism.

 A personal welcome from our Founder and Chairman
