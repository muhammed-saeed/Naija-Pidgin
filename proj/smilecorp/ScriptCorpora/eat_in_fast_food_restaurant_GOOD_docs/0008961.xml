The most tasty fast foods are French fries - hands down - by far over any other food items. French fries are so tasty their popularity has restaurants of all types and on all levels offering fries with their meals. This is why restaurants serving chicken, burritos, sandwiches, and even steaks jumped on the hamburger with fries bandwagon, and started offering French fries with their entrees. Of course, most people do not want to eat French fries every time they visit their favorite restaurants and thus restaurants have found other tasty food items to offer their patrons to keep them coming back.
 
* Hamburgers and cheeseburgers stand high on the list of tasty fast food items. Hamburgers and cheeseburgers were served at restaurants long before fast foods became the eat-on-the-go conveniences we know them as today. Right along with French fires, patrons could pull their cars into“drive-in”diners, such as A&amp;W, and order their favorite burgers from the menu.

* Chicken is another tasty treat that belongs at the top of the tastiest fast food item list. Although chicken became most popular back in 1940 when Kentucky Fried Chicken ’s Colonel Sanders introduced his“finger lickin’good”chicken, many restaurants have realized the popularity of chicken when served at fast food restaurants. In addition to regular fried chicken , today’s patrons can order fried chicken with differing spice levels (hot or mild) as well as different crunchiness levels. Customers can also go for open flamed grilled chicken, barbecued chicken, as well as an array of chicken sandwiches.

* Foot long and six-inch sandwiches may be some of the best tasty fast food items simply because ordering the right sandwich gives patrons healthier meals. Foot longs and six-inch sandwiches otherwise known as grinders, hoagies, subways, and heroes, can be prepared with hot foods such as steak, meatballs, and sausage - each of which comes with a special sauce. Sandwiches can also be prepared with cold cuts such as bologna, salami, ham, turkey, and even tuna salad.

One of the best things about ordering a hero type sandwich is that you get to choose from a wide assortment of condiments to add to your sandwich so the finished product will taste just the way you like it. You can add items such as lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, spinach, jalapeno peppers, pickles, onions, and a slew of different sauces.

* Burritos have come a long way in a short time at making themselves favorite tasty fast food items. Burritos are different from other kinds of fast foods because you can wrap just about anything in the right sized tortilla. This means you can get burritos with beans and cheese, steak and cheese, ground or shredded beef with cheese and so on. In addition to the main item prepared in the tortilla, you can add lettuce, tomatoes, onions, salsa, and other fancy spices to form your own personalized signature sandwich.

* Hotdogs cannot be left out of this tasty fast food item list because hotdogs may well be the most popular of all fast foods. Hotdogs enjoy so much popularity, and are so easy to prepare, that hotdog stand patrons can enjoy their wieners simply by stepping outside their place of employment or walking a few block down the street. You can also get hotdogs at the popular warehouse locations as well as hotdog restaurants.

These tasty fast food items fill the stomachs of hungry bodies by the tons every single day across the world. People just cannot get enough of them even when they know some of the tastiest fast food items are not particularly good to consume on a daily basis!
