What do you think of places that close an hour (or even ten minutes) earlier than their...?
 ...posted time?
I called a fast food restaurant in advance to find out when they closed, and was told they closed at 10:00.

That is also posted on their sign out front.

I drove about 5 miles. When we got there, it was 8:51, and the manager, in mock apology, told me they were closed. Keep in mind, the sign out front says they closed at 10:00. He said that the drive thru was opened. I said no thank you (the drive through also closed at 10:00, but some are open as late as 2:00 a.m.)

We ended up going to another restaurant that closed at 10, and arrived there at 9:03. We were seated and ate, and were out of there before 10.

We passed the first restaurant and the duffus was sitting there in the empty restaurant presumably waiting for his time to run out.

While it is realistic that a restaurant may need an hour or so to close down, I don&apos;t think that should be during posted business hours. If the workers need to be off the clock at ten, then they should close at 9:00.

Any thoughts?

 This has happened to me on mpore than one occasion. I have managed 2 fast food type operations in the past. Often, I find, it is because the place is being run by lazy or incompetent people. Often it will be a group of undersupervised teenagers/young adults who think they are pulling one over on the boss. They would actually rather sit in the empty restaraunt and waste time than do the actual work they get payed for. A lot of times they want to close early because business has been slow and they have the whole place cleaned up and they don&apos;t want to have to mess it all up for 1 or 2 customers. I have seen that happen a lot in the foon management business. I have fired people over it! I have even walked into a fast-food chain and had the employees ask if I could please eat elswhere because they hadn&apos;t been doing their jobs all night, nothing was prepped or stocked and so, consequently, it was going to take a really long time to make my order. I made them do it. (It was even a restaurant I used to manage!!) Also, I think some people feel that they are not getting paid enough to care, although I cannot undertand that right now, due to the employment ratings in this country!

At any rate, Rule #1 for doing good business is having a consistant opening and closing time. Your customers need to know when you are going to be open. It can&apos;t just be this unpredictable thing! Every time this has happened to me in the past, I have made note not to return to said restaraunt - ever! I even called the next day and ratted the empolyees out to the boss, once. (They were closing 1-1/2 hours early and were extremely rude to me about it). Usually, the boss wants to know about things like this.
(I usually end up telling atleast a couple other people about it, too, and if this happens enough times, that particular business is going to get a bad reputation!) In this business climate, places cannot afford to be run this poorly.

What&apos;s more is that most chain fast food restaraunts and franchises are governed by a parent company that dictates what hours of opperation they should keep. Closing early could get them in big trouble. Most fast-food chains advertise their hours on national television, so it&apos;s not like they can get away with just deciding to close early.

Now, there are always exeptions to the rule. If there is a bad accident in the restaraunt and they need to close to the public to prevent injury, illness, etc. Or if there is a personal tragedy and thre is no one else to run the place, I can see closing. I have seen restaraunts stay open whwn they should have closed, too. There was a case in my town where someone passed away right there in the dining room and the manager asked if the rest of their family could just take her out onto the font lawn and wait for the ambulance. That was just poor! And incredibly insensitive.

At any rate, closing early is just poor, poor business. Especially for a restaraunt where you should be at the ready to feed whoever walks in the door!

 Well, I think it&apos;s poor business practice to do such a thing. I&apos;ve seen places that also close early.

In general, I&apos;d say:
-- Stores/restaurants have the right to close whenever they want, even if it&apos;s earlier than their posted time.
-- And I have the right to stop going to your store/restaurant if you don&apos;t honor your posted time.

I&apos;m a big wimp though, so as long as the store/restaurant in question offers the best deal, I put up with their early closing.

 emergency of some sort.

Having worked in fast food, I know that the&quot;closing&quot;of the store happens *after* the vcustomers have left, and the doors are locked at the posted time.

I would call the restaurant and request to speak to the owner, headquarters office or head manager. Talk to them, and if you don&apos;t get satisfaction, go up the food chain.

 of course you&apos;re right.

but having worked in the restaurant business, i know how it happens. business is slow, so you restock everything, then get all cleaned up, including floors mopped and kitchen done. then someone comes in 10 minutes before closing, and it&apos;s going to create another hour&apos;s worth of work. it /is/ tempting to say that you&apos;re closed.

what a bummer. hope you eventually got to eat.

 YES I just think the employees or whoever is shutting down are laaaazzy. It happen to me at Gamestop. They were locking the doors right as I was walking up to them (they watched me) and it was an hour before they were suppose to close.

 It seems as if Customer Service has gone out the window in most businesses. I would find out who to contact to complain. Someone above the manager. Thanks

 I had this happen once. I had happened to meet the regional manager of the restaurant chain a few weeks before hand. I.E. The manager&apos;s boss. So, I called him and told him about it. He sounded pretty angry about it. If it bothers you, you might consider dialing the little number that some restaurants have for complaints. It always at least goes to the person above the restaurant manager. Of course, sometimes its the owner, and I guess to me that doesn&apos;t bug me as much. After all, he&apos;s not putting me out AND basically stealing from his company at the same time.

 My daughter had during the day (she was with her father) stuffed a considerable size piece of diaper wipe up her nose. In fact, so far up her nose that it could no longer be seen with a flashlight. Her father was convinced that we could get it out so he let it sit in her nose the entire day until I got home from work. Well, I immediately put her in the car and took her to urgent care. I arrived 15 minutes before closing time. They refused to allow me to bring my daughter in there and informed that I would have to go the emergency room. So, it went from a 50 dollar co-pay to chipping my 500 dollar deductible. Luckily, the ER had these great tweezers and took care of the situation, but I was furious that I was turned away before closing time.

 This sounds like a public relations disaster. I would be curious to know the time that you called the restaurant at. I would also love to know if the manager gave an explanation as to why they were closed. Did you question him as to why they were closing earlier than advertised?

I am guessing that this restaurant may be part of a chain of fast food restaurants. If so, an email to the head office would be my next move. Point out that having to pay staff to work until at least 10pm (if they advertise that they are open until 10, staff would have to be paid to work later 10) with new business being refused before 9pm is not good for the company’s profits.

I would also point out that if they don’t want any customers coming in around 9pm, then they need to change their signage accordingly. The fact that you drove 5 miles after confirming their trading hours and were refused service before 9pm demands an explanation and an apology. They would have to consider themselves lucky if you decided to give them any of your business in the future.

The other thing that keeps nagging me about this is the fact that it is a fast food restaurant. How long is the average turnaround time from placing an order to walking out the door? I’m sure it isn’t 1hr and 10 min.

When you talked about passing the empty restaurant on the way home with the manager waiting for his time to run out, I thought to myself that his time will run out sooner than he thinks. Businesses are going belly-up and people are losing their jobs like never before. His time will be up, before he knows it and not in the way that he was thinking.

If this is a privately owned restaurant, I’d find out who the owner is and suggest to the owner that his manager is in the wrong line of work. Hopefully, the manager is not his son!

I’d would definitely pursue this as you will be doing both (the company/owner and other people who might visit at the same time as you did) a big favour.
