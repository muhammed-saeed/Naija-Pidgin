Care to downsize that order? Many want smaller portions
 
Care to downsize that cheeseburger order?
 By Linda Carroll 
What if the server at your favorite fast food joint asked if you wanted to downsize your order, instead of asking you to supersize it?

That’s a strategy that might make some patrons happier–and a lot thinner, a new study suggests.

When people were asked if they wanted to downsize portions of their side dishes at a fast food restaurant, as many as a third opted for the smaller–and thus lower calorie - option, according to the report published in the journal Health Affairs.

The whole notion seems counter to our natural bargain-hunting instincts: less food for the same price. But consumers apparently are ready to tighten their belts, literally.

“The restaurant thought people wouldn’t be willing to do it,&quot; said the study’s lead author, Janet Schwartz, a psychologist and an assistant professor of marketing at the Freeman School of Business at Tulane University.“Some people don’t want big supersized portions and they’re willing to pay a premium for it by paying the same amount for less food.”

Other strategies, like displaying the calorie count of every item on the fast food restaurant menu, just haven’t led to weight loss, Schwartz said.

The idea behind downsizing is that people really do understand that no matter what’s put on their plates, they’ll most likely devour every single morsel, Schwartz said. But, if they’re given a chance to get a smaller portion before they stick the first forkful into their mouths, many will go for it.

For the new study, Schwartz and her colleagues asked a fast food Chinese restaurant to offer customers smaller portions of high carb side dishes. In one experiment, people were given a small price incentive - a 25-cent savings–and in two others, they were simply offered a smaller portion at the same price.

When there was a cash discount, 33 percent of people chose the smaller portions, as compared to 21 percent and 18 percent without the monetary incentive. 

The savings in calories were significant–200 for those choosing the downsized option.

Leslie Bonci, a nutritionist at the University of Pittsburgh thinks this kind of strategy could help the nation shed some serious pounds.

Certainly the addition of calorie counts didn’t.

“There’s a certain number numbness out there,”said Bonci, director of sports nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

A big part of the problem is the growth of the portion size, Bonci said. It’s changed our expectations.

“There was a time when the piece of meat on our plate would be 6 ounces,”Bonci explained.“Now, depending on where you go, it can be anywhere from 9 to 12 ounces–and more if you get a steak. A serving of pasta used to be a cup, now it’s 3 at a minimum and often up to 6.

“Meanwhile, vegetables have taken a nose-dive. You used to get five chunks of broccoli on your plate, now it’s just one sad little spear. There’s been a total reversal of what’s being put on our plates and our eyes have gotten used to it.”

Still, Bonci said, calling it“downsizing,”might not be the best strategy if you want it to appeal to hungry diners.“Downsizing has such a negative connotation,”she explained.“People are going to think,‘I don’t want to lose my food!”

“Instead of asking,‘would you like to add some fries,’servers could ask,‘would you like to right-size it,’”Bonci suggested.

If you’re trying to figure out how to implement the“right-size”strategy at your favorite fast food joint, Bonci suggests simply ordering the smallest size of everything–and not ordering anything bigger than the size of your fist.

“So, if you do a single burger or a junior burger and a small fries then you’re really getting out of there unscathed in terms of your calorie cap,”Bonci said.“And make sure you choose a small drink, too. Or better yet, ask for a cup with ice and fill it with water.”

Bonci underscores the importance of carefully monitoring your liguid calories.“If you order a small burger and a small fries and add to that a tank sized soda you can triple the calories of your meal,”she said.

If you’re going to allow yourself a desert, like ice cream, ask for the kiddie cone, Bonci suggests.

In regular restaurants consider ordering appetizers instead of the full entre, or asking if they offer a half size portion, Bonci suggests.

I often split the meal with my husband or take half or more home and make 1-3 more meals out of it but this can be very inconvenient if we have a whole evening planed or want to take a walk before heading home. It often makes me wonder what people do on the first few dates. Taking home portions sounds awkward, splitting presumptuous, and the sides much less appetizing. Honestly, if I were ever to go on a first date again I would try and get to be of the non-dinner variety to avoid the whole thing.

How about just leaving the food behind and chalking it up to the cost of the date/entertainment?!

 

 #27.1 - Thu Feb 9, 2012 10:02 AM EST EmilyinIowa 
Yes but that&apos;s wasteful and if your date pays for it do you think they might be a little annoyed? Luckily the higher end places seem to have less of this problem but it would still be nice to have a slightly less expensive plate with half the food but of the same type and quality.
 

 #27.2 - Thu Feb 9, 2012 1:59 PM EST ttmadison 
Put a small soft-sided cooler with a couple ice cooling packs in your car before you go out to eat. Then you can drop off your leftovers at your car and then go on a walk or run errands. This also works if you only need to pick up a few things at the grocery store that need refrigeration; you don&apos;t have to go home to put in in your refrigerator right away. Keep cooler out of sunlight and in the cooler part of your car. Those of you living in colder climates can just put the food in your trunk during winter.
 

 #27.3 - Thu Feb 9, 2012 8:40 PM EST EmilyinIowa 
Wow - that&apos;s a lot of thought and planning into eating out - no wonder I usually prefer to eat at home. Now I really don&apos;t see the point of dinner dates. Also, I often use the bus and so I&apos;m stuck carrying anything I bring or buy all night (luckily my work is downtown so I can stick things in the work fridge but many people don&apos;t have that advantage).
 

 #27.4 - Fri Feb 10, 2012 10:12 AM EST PH-3046605 
Honestly, if my date is upset that I didn&apos;t eat my whole dinner (or take the rest home) we&apos;d have bigger problems than some leftovers. Buying dinner is the cost of going out on a date. Get over it.

BTW - I always offer to pay my way. If he was that upset, I&apos;d demand that I pay my share and move on to someone less preoccupied with what I&apos;m eating. If I&apos;m dating someone who doesn&apos;t have the money to spend on a dinner out (without worrying about leftovers) then we&apos;d find something else to do. But seriously, if he asked me out to dinner, and we couldn&apos;t get through dinner without a leftover argument, then he probably shouldn&apos;t be dating at all.
 

 #27.5 - Sat Feb 11, 2012 3:32 PM EST EmilyinIowa 
No, I agree that given the imperfect option of way too much food that is the best solution but it really does emotionally pain me to just waste over half of a plate of food. I do think it&apos;s worth noting for restaurants that at least some people avoid them entirely because of their ridiculous portion sizes.
 

 #27.6 - Mon Feb 13, 2012 10:23 AM EST PH-3046605 
Agreed Emily. I don&apos;t go to chain restaurants for this reason. I go to local, independently owned restaurants where the food is made fresh and the people know your name. With the exception of people who live in areas where chain food is all that&apos;s available, I will never understand those who choose Applebees over their local eateries. Most of the time the food at local restaurants is the same price, if not less expensive, and the quality is far superior. Further, the portions are more reasonable because they aren&apos;t catering to the lowest common denominator.

For sure - I&apos;m lucky enough to live in a area where I have plenty of non-chain options. If that was all we had I think we would just forgo eating out at all - that being said, all but the fanciest places ($30-50 plates) here have huge portions. Not a big deal but I can see it being awkward on dates and really a higher operational cost for them when most people would be happier with smaller portions.

Also, Applebees has to be the worst restaurant of all time - does anyone go their other then to join their grandparents?
 

 #27.8 - Mon Feb 13, 2012 3:11 PM EST David-2956495 
I wouldn&apos;t mind having smaller portions in some cases - but the assumption I&apos;d be willing to pay the same prices for it is ridiculous. If you can charge me more for a larger portion, you can charge me less for a smaller one.

For years I and my wife of 35 years have always order one entree and ask for a separate plate as we always split the meal. They give you so much.... It has nothing to do with the cost, it&apos;s the quantity they serve you. Ugh...
 

 #29 - Wed Feb 8, 2012 8:40 PM EST Kassie S. 
But then we&apos;d have to buy my husband the extra half (mine) he&apos;s used to!
 

 #30 - Wed Feb 8, 2012 8:46 PM EST Carole-2379889 
My husband and I eat out once a week at Long John Silvers. We order the choice with 2 filets of fish (get an extra plate) and split the fries and Hush puppies. We also get one diet drink and a glass of water. After that we are off to the grocery store to by food, but being full from eating we stick to our list!!!
 

 #31 - Wed Feb 8, 2012 9:19 PM EST gwnyvere 
People do need to learn to eat smarter, not only in what they put into their bodies but how much . Having said that, I personally would appreciate it if restaurants offered half dishes for a few bucks less (or even half price). Yes, I could take home left overs but a lot of the time I forget about them and they just sit there gathering mold.

As for fast food.. I remember when today&apos;s &apos;small&apos; drink used to be yesteryear&apos;s large. The super-sizing has to stop. Super-sizing got me to just over 300 pounds, thank God I finally woke up, 60 down, 90 to go.

@gwynyvere - Way to go and stick with it! I woke up one day&amp;realized I looked like I was smuggling a volleyball...and nothing in my closet (except the elastic waistbands, of course) fit. It doesn&apos;t help that today&apos;s size 8 is 1985&apos;s size 12, either... If you haven&apos;t heard of the Naturally Slim program - check it out, because you&apos;re 100% right - how much and when and why we eat is as (and in some cases, MORE) important that what we eat.

Here in California I just want to be able to buy a normal size burrito! Man, they are all &quot;Super Burritos&quot;! I was taught to NEVER eat anything bigger than yer head!

How about a &quot;Small Mac&quot;?

I am a diabetic so I nearly always ask the waiter just to box half of the meal and hold it for me instead of bringing it to the table. At the end of the meal he brings me a nicely packaged to go meal (the second half of my dinner). It works quite well: I have a nice meal and lunch the next day.
 

 #35 - Wed Feb 8, 2012 9:50 PM EST tac210 
I love that a lot of restaurants now offer the smaller desserts, so if you want something sweet, and no one with you wants to share dessert, you have the option of getting smaller dessert ( which is likely the equivilent size of what you would have for dessert at home) and a smaller price..

Finally, common sense prevails, no need for any extensive fact-finding studies on what&apos;s good or bad ie butter vs margerine or soy base vs palm oil etc. Curb the greed is all that is needed but of course, easier said than done.

All this BS about fast food making people fat, the poor buy it because it&apos;s cheaper and hurts their health, is just that,BS. All people have to do is just use a little judgment and not super size everything or buy from the $1 menu, but no, we have to make it someone else&apos;s fault because people use poor judgment.

When I go to McD&apos;s (rarely), I get a cheeseburger, small fries and a soda. It is enough for lunch and it&apos;s only about $3. It&apos;s not In &apos;n Out, but it&apos;ll do.

Or... You could theoretically just not eat all of it... Maybe take it home for another meal... Why would you order less food, and pay the same amount?

The problem is 90% of us work in sedentary intellectual jobs where we mainly use our brains and eyes.

We all eat like we work in construction where the physical demands of the job require a large amount of salts, fats and sugars.

For the jobs most of us do we need to eat a lot of carrots, tomatoes, salmon and other foods that feed our brains and eyes, instead of feeding our adipose cells.

Feed your body the fuel it needs for the life your living and you&apos;ll be healthier and happier.

It&apos;d be a good idea for a family of four, for example, to go through the drive up line, buy a king size burger, king size fries and super gulp drink. Bring your own paper plates and cups, cutting knife, etc., and then divide everything by four. It would save money and cut calories at the same time.

When I (and I&apos;m 72) go out to eat with my sister, we usually split a dinner, because it&apos;s too much for one of us. However, this usually means that we have to compromise and one of us doesn&apos;t get what we want. I&apos;d simply like to see small plates rather than children&apos;s plates. Taking half home is not a good option because it&apos;s never the same reheated.

It would also be nice if they cut the amount of salt in half--not to zero, just in half, and let people salt to their own taste.

Many times my husband and I go out and only order an appetizer and one entree. We split both and it works out great. This is especially good in Vegas where the portions seem to be even bigger than in the &apos;real world&apos;.

If we don&apos;t want the same thing, it&apos;s always a big box of left-overs for the next day. I do wish more restaurants would offer 1/2 orders.
 

 #48 - Thu Feb 9, 2012 9:27 AM EST missamy-1330543 
personally, I object to the phrase &quot;right-size&quot;. It has been used to justify too many lay-offs of good hard working folk (me included), who now want good value and portions for their money. Not all leftovers should be microwaved. Many are just as appetizing as originally if you put it in the oven (anything crispy).

Tons of restaurants (chain types, Applebees, 99, etc) now offer full meals (app, entree, dessert) at a reasonable price and reasonable portions.

For those of you who split an entree, doesn&apos;t the restaurant charge you extra? or do you do takeout? Most restaurants don&apos;t allow splitting.

I just wish that they would actually make small size portions. I remember back in the day when a small drink or a small order of fries were small!
 

 #50 - Thu Feb 9, 2012 10:52 AM EST sgbear 
I think the idea of saying &quot;right-size&quot; is demeaning and if you say no, that means you opt for the &quot;wrong-size&quot;(Regardless if it is or not, it shouldn&apos;t be phrased that way). I think the smaller portions are a great idea and should be listed as &quot;classic-size&quot; referring to the portion sizes we used to eat. However I think just as we pay a bit extra for a &quot;value-size&quot; there should be an equivalent discount for the &quot;classic-size&quot;. This is a simple thing to easily incorporate into the food industry (and if the big restaurant people were smart they would adopt this as their way of &quot;doing good&quot; and winning the peoples choice, thereby actually increasing their customer base).
