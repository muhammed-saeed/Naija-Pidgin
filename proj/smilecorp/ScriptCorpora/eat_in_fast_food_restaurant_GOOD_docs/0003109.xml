Dangerous dogs: Ordinance-required signs have arrived at City Hall in Saginaw

Published: Friday, July 22, 2011, 12:40 PM

 Follow 10 Share close Digg Stumble Upon Fark Reddit Share Email Print View full size Saginaw City Clerk Diane Herman holds &quot;dog on premises&quot; sign SAGINAW—At long last, dangerous dogs ordinance signs have arrived. 
 
Saginaw City Clerk Diane Herman today received the boxes containing 500 of the 12-inch-by-18-inch yellow signs with an eyelet in each corner.

The city ordered 500 of the signs, but because of delays they did not arrive until Friday.

The city had been issuing registrants temporary paper signs.

Herman said 414 residents had registered as of Friday and the city is planning to place another sign order soon.

Residents may pick up their sign at City Hall, 1315 S. Washington, but must have their receipt; and code enforcers plan to personally deliver all uncollected signs to homes beginning late next week, said John Stemple, the city’s chief inspector.

The city requires owners of dangerous breeds —including pit bulls, Presa canarios, bull mastiffs, German shepherds and Rottweilers—register their animals for $20 and post a sign that states,“dog on premises,”on their property so that they are visible from the road.

The rule also forbids residents from tethering a“dangerous”breed dog outside their home without being confined inside 4-feet-high or taller pen.

Fines for violating the ordinance range from $100 to $400.

The contested ordinance passed 5-3 by City Council on June 20, took effect on June 30 and Saginaw Assistant Manager of Public Safety Phillip A. Ludos said it won’t be enforced until July 31.

A second dog-related ordinance that passed at the same meeting prohibits ownership of greater than three dogs or tethering outside of an enclosed pen as a primary means of confinement.

Language on the application states:

BY EXECUTION HEREOF, APPLICANT CONFIRMS HE/SHE HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THE
DANGEROUS DOG ORDINANCE AND AGREES TO COMPLY WITH ALL TERMS AND PROVISIONS
THEREOF, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROPER CONFINEMENT, NECESSARY LEASH
AND REQUIRED SIGNAGE.

Applicant further agrees that he/she will notify the City of Saginaw within
twenty-four (24) hours of the occurrence of any one of the following
events:

 1) The animal has escaped.
 2) The animal has attacked a human being or other animal.
 3) The animal has been sold, given or transferred permanently to another person or address within the City.
 4) The animal has died.
 5) There has been a birth of an offspring of the animal.
 6) The animal is permanently leaving the City of Saginaw.
