 On 5/20/07 Pete Ceci mentioned there may be a Farm restaurant still in operation in Bradford, PA. 
 I passed this info on to the sites MVP&apos;s, Rick and Georgie, and 3 days later we have pictures! 
 Both Rick and Georgie give the food two thumbs up...it&apos;s Red Barn Food! 
 Owner, Ginny Butler was more then happy to give Rick and Georgie full access to take pictures for Barnbuster.net, Thanks Ginny! We can&apos;t thank Rick and Georgie enough for taking the time and effort to make the 7 hour round trip, but they did get to eat Red Barn chicken and Big Barney&apos;s!!!

 The Farm Family restaurant is located at 545 E. Main Street, Bradford Pa. on the east side of town. It is a family oriented fast food operation open 7 days per week. It offers a breakfast, lunch&amp;dinner menu, similar to other fast food operations but with a larger variety&amp;more nutritious menu. 
 
 The original structure was built in 1968 and first opened as a unit of the Red Barn chain. The Red Barn was purchased in 1976 by Pete Ceci who also owned restaurants in Meadville, Johnsonburg, Sharon Pa, Olean NY.&amp;Cleveland, Oh. Mr. Ceci changed the name to the Farm Family Restaurant in 1982 due to the declining reputation of the Red Barn chain. Stiff competition along with financial difficulties closed all but the Sharon&amp;Bradford locations by 1987. Mr. Ceci filed for bankruptcy in 1989&amp;on May 14, 1990 the business in Bradford was sold to Doug&amp;Ginny Butler along with partners Dave&amp;Sandy Norgrove. The Butlers&amp;Norgroves also purchased the building&amp;real estate. In 1992 the Butlers purchased the Norgroves share of the business&amp;have been the sole proprietors since that time.

Many side orders are also available including popcorn chicken, chicken nuggets, French fries, cole slaw, potato wedges, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, taco salad&amp;more.
