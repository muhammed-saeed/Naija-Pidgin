2 New Orleans officers shot; 1 suspect dead, other in custody
 By Associated Press 
One suspect is dead and two New Orleans police officers and another suspect were wounded after an early morning traffic stop developed into a gunfight.

Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas says both wounded officers required surgery after the shooting early Thursday.

A police spokesman said both were in stable condition as of 9:30 a.m. Central time.

The condition of the injured suspect was unknown.

The gunfire happened not far from New Orleans&apos; City Park and near Delgado Community College.

Terry Smith, an employee of a nearby fast food restaurant, identified the dead man as a co-worker and said he was being driven to work by his brother. Smith was angry at police, expressing doubt that the young man was involved in a crime.

new orleans has become a battleground; the inner-city gangs are all fighting for their turf, and it has spilled over into the rest of the city,. number 1 murder capital per cap, in the United States.

Did you have them same thoughts when they left their jobs and many perished during the hurricane? What comes around goes around. And I would hope that you notice how the American people now see the cops for what they really are, a lying, thieving, murderous, corrupt organization

So making a traffic stop means they are all those things???

Get a life.

beca...

Many but not all of the N.O. Police left when Katrina hit. To paint ALL with such a broad brush as you have is ludicrous.

And while there ARE some police that have gone overboard, and ARE corrupt, to say ALL are is absurd. The good cops don&apos;t like the bad any more than you or I. It makes their job much harder.

One last point... I would submit that YOU are the real causation of your problems and issues with the police. What is my reasoning for that you ask? Simple... WilliamOfRites and myself seldom if ever agree on anything, yet we BOTH have the same thought concerning YOUR post.

D Dirty Dog...

OK.. I&apos;ll grant she didn&apos;t say ALL... but she implied it with:
 
now see the cops for what they really are, a lying, thieving, murderous, corrupt organization
 
Most people with any reading comprehension would come to the same conclusion.

And I will grant you that she did not ask... I made the presumptive determination she would and doing so provided the answer to the question immediately.

Strange story. Very little details. Guess we need to wait till cops come out of surgery and see what they make up.

Oh Yeah, Automaticly the Men who put their lives on the line everytime they put on the uniform are to blame regardless that we don&apos;t yet know what the FACTS are! Come on down to the Big Easy and see how these thugs that roam the streets act and see just what they will do to protect NOTHING but what they call their turf, the big wad of money and the crack in thier pocket, and to kill a police officer is about the only thing they MIGHT pray for to be able to put another notch on their belt as it is the greatest honor in the gang life to do so! It was a shootout and it looks like the bad guys were the better shooters which tells me that the Men in Blue were most likely just average men making a routine traffic stop and hoping to make it through their shift ALIVE so as to go home and have dinner or breakfast with their families. There are a hell of a lot more bad guys in New Orleans than there are Bad Cops, this city has changed for the better in that regard, Good Men who have come from all over America to try and protect this city after the storms ran out the riff raff that plagued the city!!!!! IMO if you hate the Police then your probably a law breaker yourself or like another poster said that you might be a person who gives the police a hard time when stopped for even as little as a traffic ticket! What kind of good guy riding in a car has a shootout with the police, maybe it was because the car they were riding in was stolen or maybe it was for what i said about turf, drugs and money? If you are innocent of any wrong doing other than maybe a traffic violation this kind of crap just doesn&apos;t happen &quot;so stop siding with the real bad guys&quot;...........

First and most importantly my thoughts and prayers go out to the officers and their families. The thin blue line in a hard path to walk in any city but in that place... I couldn&apos;t imagine.

To you morons saying one bad word about these men based on the information in this story, STFU. That is all.

Law enforcement is in my blood, I have been around it in one capacity or another since I was born in Houston Texas to my sheriff father. Cops for the most part are great guys putting their life on the line to protect and serve but i have in my time come across men who should be wearing county orange not blue. I understand where the hatred for the police comes from, I have been pulled over and searched just because &quot;white people only come down here to buy drugs&quot; and oddly enough have never had one charge. Ive had cops see my concealed weapons PERMIT in my wallet and draw down on me (that means both cops on either side of my truck took out their glock 17s and pointed them at my head) screaming to see my hands and get out of the car then push my face into my dirty ass hood (boy did they @!$%# themselves when they saw my last name lol). Ive had cops come up to me at the shooting range and say they are taking my rifle and arresting me because its illegal when the only crime being committed was their lack of knowledge about firearms. I know cops can be total diks but when you deal w scum all day everyday you develop a demeanor to deal with such people, that same demeanor will not fly w law abiding respectful people. Its a hard switch to flip especially when you don&apos;t know what kind of people your around.

Bottom line is when i get pulled over I&apos;m respectful, I have the three pieces of information they are looking for and my gun (or guns) stays out of sight. They deserve a little respect no matter what you think, their not all perfect or even good cops but they are still police officers and should be treated as such.

Great minds discuss issues, small minds discuss or degrade people, So many liberal comments here as to draw the conclusion about the liberal min.
