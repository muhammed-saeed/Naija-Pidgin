 Low-Fat Fast Foods

Many fast food restaurants offer a surprising array of low-fat options---although you can&apos;t always tell just by looking at the menu. The best way to find low-fat dishes is to consult the fine print. &quot;Many fast food restaurants provide nutrition information on their web sites or on on-site brochures, tray liners and posters,&quot; says Annika Stensson, a spokesperson for the National Restaurant Association. Check calories, too: Some entrees are low in fat, but still high in overall calories.
 
Burger Joints

Hamburgers are generally not your best choice at a burger joint---although a simple, single-patty burger can have less fat (11 g) than a fancy chicken sandwich (which can have up to 46 g). For the most part, though, look to the other options. At McDonald&apos;s, for instance, the Grilled Chicken Classic Sandwich with barbecue sauce (instead of the mayonnaise-based dressing) weighs in with just 5 grams of fat. The Filet-O-Fish sandwich without tartar sauce (9 g) and the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad with Newman&apos;s Own Low Fat Family Recipe Italian Dressing (9 g) are other good choices. At Jack-in-the-Box, go for the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl (6 g), or better yet, the Chicken Fajita Pita. It has slightly more fat (10 g), but is almost half the calories.
 
Chicken Spots

Nobody has to tell you to stay away from the fried chicken if you&apos;re trying to cut back on fat, however, that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean you have to stay away from fried chicken restaurants. You can actually get grilled chicken at Kentucky Fried Chicken (anywhere from 3.5 g fat for a drumstick to 9 g for a thigh) and the Honey BBQ sandwich has only 4 grams. At Popeyes, go for the Crawfish Etouffee (5 g) or feast on the side dishes like Cajun rice, corn on the cob and green beans (all 6 g and under). Chick-fil-A offers the very reasonable 3.5 gram Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich.
 
Sandwich Shops

Subway has partially made its name on its healthy options, and with good reason. The chain offers a large menu of sandwiches and salads with 6 or fewer grams of fat. The Veggie Delite Sandwich, for instance, has only 2.5 grams, as does the Oven-Roasted Chicken Salad. At Panera Bread, your best bet is the Smoked Turkey Sandwich (6 g if you hold the mayo) or the Low-Fat Vegetarian Black Bean Soup (4 g).
 
Mexican Eateries

Fried tortillas and cheese drive up the fat content of many Mexican dishes, but several fast food places are now offering dishes without either. Taco Bell has a full menu of items under 9 grams of fat, including the Fresco Grilled Steak Soft Taco (4.5 g). On the Baja Fresh menu: Shrimp Baja-Style Taco (5 g) and the Grilled Chicken Bare Burrito (7 g).
 
Chinese Food

When in doubt at a Chinese fast food restaurant, get the soup. Panda Express&apos; Egg Flower Soup has only 2 grams fat; its Hot&amp;Sour Soup has 3.5. Anything with a sauce is going to register higher on the fat-o-meter, however, Panda Express&apos; Broccoli Beef (6 g) and Tangy Shrimp (7 g) are reasonable.
