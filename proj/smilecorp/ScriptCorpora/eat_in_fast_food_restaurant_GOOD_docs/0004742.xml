 AFFIRMED

 Attorney General Henry

 Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold 
 M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for 
 Respondent. 
 
 ANDERSON, J.: Bernard Crawford (Appellant) was convicted of criminal 
 conspiracy and sentenced to five years in prison. He appeals, arguing the trial 
 judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict. We affirm. 

 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

 On the night of August 20, 2002, John Crawford (John) awoke 
 his son, Jonathan Crawford (Jonathan), and demanded Jonathan take him to get 
 something to eat. John is Appellants brother, and Jonathan is Johns son, 
 Appellants nephew. Jonathan testified at Appellants trial that his father 
 was drunk and irate. Jonathan acquiesced, and on their way to a fast-food restaurant, 
 John and Jonathan picked up Appellant, who had been walking along the side of 
 the road. According to Jonathans testimony, the three of them proceeded to 
 a fast-food restaurant. John then directed Jonathan to drive to an apartment 
 complex, but suddenly demanded that Jonathan stop the vehicle so he could urinate 
 behind a building. Jonathan stopped the car at Sunbelt Rentals. Shortly after 
 John exited the vehicle, Jonathan heard glass break from the direction of Sunbelt 
 Rentals. 

 In his statement to police, Jonathan averred Appellant exited the vehicle upon 
 hearing the glass break. He saw John and Appellant carrying stolen saws from 
 the store to the car. According to his sworn statement, John and Appellant 
 loaded the saws into the car and demanded Jonathan drive away. 

 Officer Jenkins witnessed the vehicle, with its headlights off, pulling out 
 of the parking lot of Sunbelt Rentals. The officer, who had been traveling 
 in the opposite direction of the Crawfords, turned around to follow Jonathans 
 vehicle. Jonathan sped up, and the officer activated his blue lights. Officer 
 Jenkins testified that it appeared as though objects were being thrown out of 
 the sunroof. In his statement, Jonathan claimed that upon seeing the police 
 car, Appellant handed John the saws from the backseat, and John threw the saws 
 out of the vehicles passenger side window. Appellant ran from police once 
 the vehicle was stopped. Bolt cutters, gloves, and newly purchased flashlights 
 were found in the vehicle. 

 The police charged Jonathan, John, and Appellant with conspiracy, 
 burglary, and grand larceny. All charges against Jonathan subsequently were 
 dropped. John pled guilty to all the charges and was sentenced to a total of 
 fifteen years in prison. At Appellants trial, John claimed full responsibility 
 for the crimes: [n]either one of them . . . had really anything to do with 
 it. . . . [I]f he would have helped me or somebody would have helped me, I wouldnt 
 have gotten caught. According to John, neither Jonathan nor Appellant knew 
 his intention to break into Sunbelt Rentals. 

 Jonathans trial testimony differs substantially from the statement 
 he gave to police. In court, Jonathan proclaimed: . . . I dont know if 
 Bernard Crawford got out of the car between the time that he ran in the building 
 and came back. He stated further: I had tunnel vision. I didnt look around 
 and look back. I didnt see anything til my father put the saws in the back 
 seat and jumped in the front seat and said, Lets go. Jonathan testified 
 that John slapped him and may have slapped at Appellant as well. John yelled 
 at them both demanding they obey his orders. Jonathan remembered Appellant 
 telling John: you basically just got us in trouble, you know, for your stupidity. 

 When the State rested its case, Appellant moved for a directed verdict as to 
 all charges. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that substantial 
 evidence was extant in the record from which the jury could infer that the State 
 had proven the elements of each of the offenses, focusing particularly on Jonathans 
 previous statement to police about Appellants involvement. The jury found 
 Appellant guilty of criminal conspiracy and acquitted him of the remaining charges. 
 The trial court sentenced Appellant to five years in prison. 

 STANDARD OF REVIEW 

 On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate 
 court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. State 
 v. Curtis , 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004); State v. Al-Amin , 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Morgan , 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002). When ruling on a motion for a 
 directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence 
 of evidence, not its weight. State v. Cherry , Op. No. 25902 (S.C. Sup. 
 Ct. filed Nov. 29, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 46 at 28); State v. Wilds , 355 S.C. 269, 584 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. McLauren , 349 S.C. 488, 563 S.E.2d 346 (Ct. App. 2002). If there is any direct evidence 
 or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt 
 of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly submitted to the 
 jury. State v. Rosemond , 356 S.C. 426, 589 S.E.2d 757 (2003); State v. Lindsey , 355 S.C. 15, 583 S.E.2d 740 (2003); see also State v. Ballington , 346 S.C. 262, 551 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 
 2001) (stating judge should deny motion for directed verdict if there is any 
 direct or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove 
 accuseds guilt, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced). 
 On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State 
 fails to produce evidence of the offense charged. State v. McKnight , 352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003); State v. McCluney , 357 S.C. 
 560, 593 S.E.2d 509 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Padgett , 354 S.C. 
 268, 580 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 2003). The appellate court may reverse the trial 
 judges denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence 
 to support the judges ruling. State v. Gaster , 349 S.C. 545, 
 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002). 

 LAW/ANALYSIS 

 Appellant claims the trial court erred in denying 
 his motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to introduce substantial 
 evidence he was guilty of conspiracy. We disagree. 

 I. Prior Inconsistent Statement as Substantive Evidence 

 State v. Copeland , 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982), established that 
 testimony of prior inconsistent statements may be used as substantive evidence 
 when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross examination. Id. at 581, 300 S.E.2d at 69; accord State v. Smith , 309 
 S.C. 442, 424 S.E.2d 496 (1992); State v. Ferguson , 300 S.C. 408, 388 
 S.E.2d 642 (1990); State v. Caulder , 287 S.C. 507, 339 S.E.2d 876 (Ct. 
 App. 1986). In this case, Jonathan gave a statement to police following his 
 arrest asserting that Appellant participated in the grand larceny and burglary. 
 However, at trial Jonathan testified that he was unsure whether Appellant exited 
 the vehicle, and that Appellant objected to Johns actions once John was back 
 in the car. The contradiction between Jonathans sworn statement to police 
 and his later testimony in court is a matter of weight for the jury to decide. Copeland at 582, 300 S.E.2d at 69. The later testimony does not obviate 
 the efficacy of the first statement made closer in time to the event in question. Id. 

 II. Flight Evidence 

 Once Jonathan stopped the car, Officer Jenkins instructed John, Jonathan, and 
 Appellant to remain in the vehicle until backup arrived. With another officer 
 present, Officer Jenkins had each individual step out of the car, one at a time. 
 He provided the following description of the arrests: 
 
 A.   The last person I pulled out was Bernard, which was the subject seated 
 in the passenger side rear. I had him exit and also patted him down for weapons. Q. All right. And at that point what happened? A.  As soon as I began patting Bernard down for weapons, he jerked away 
 from me and took off running down Ebenezer. 
 
 After a short chase, 
 Officer Jenkins returned to John and Jonathan to place them under arrest. Additional 
 law enforcement personnel soon arrived and Officer Jenkins resumed the search 
 for Appellant. He explained: 
 
 A. . . . [W]e got a call of a subject around some apartments on Ebenezer 
 Avenue . . . . . . . At that time, I did proceed to that area and I did locate Bernard Crawford hiding 
 in the bushes in the front. It was myself and an officer from Winthrop. Q.  All right. And at that time were you able to apprehend him? A.   No, I was not. I ordered him out from the bushes. At that time I was 
 at the rear of the bushes. He exited out through the front of the bushes, ran 
 and jumped over another fence and continued on. 
 
 Eventually, Appellant was apprehended. 

 Flight from prosecution is admissible as evidence of guilt. State v. 
 Al-Amin , 353 S.C. 405, 413, 578 S.E.2d 32, 36-37 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Ballenger , 322 S.C. 196, 200, 
 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (stating flight is at least some evidence of defendant&apos;s 
 guilt); State v. Freely , 105 S.C. 243, 89 S.E. 643 (1916) (declaring 
 the flight of one charged with crime has always been held to be some evidence 
 tending to prove guilt). Evidence of flight has been held to constitute evidence 
 of defendant&apos;s guilty knowledge and intent. See State v. Beckham , 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); Town of Hartsville v. Munger , 93 S.C. 527, 77 S.E. 219 (1913); State v. Brownlee , 318 S.C. 34, 
 455 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 1995); see also State v. Thompson , 278 S.C. 1, 292 S.E.2d 581 (1982), overruled on other grounds by State 
 v. Torrence , 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (finding evidence 
 of flight admissible to show guilty knowledge, intent, and that defendant sought 
 to avoid apprehension); State v. Grant , 275 S.C. 404, 407, 272 
 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) ([A]ttempts to run away have always been regarded as 
 some evidence of guilty knowledge and intent.) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Davis , 354 S.C. 348, 580 S.E.2d 778 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting 
 that circumstances of defendants flight from police after they attempted traffic 
 stop allowed reasonable inference of guilty conduct). Flight, when unexplained, 
 is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is not to be supposed 
 that one who is innocent and conscious of that fact would flee. See State v. Williams , 350 S.C. 172, 564 S.E.2d 688 (Ct. App. 
 2002) (citing 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence 532 (1994)). 

 The critical factor to the admissibility of evidence of flight is 
 whether the totality of the evidence creates an inference that the defendant 
 had knowledge that he was being sought by the authorities. Beckham , 334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d at 612. It is sufficient that circumstances justify 
 an inference that the accuseds actions were motivated as a result of his belief 
 that police officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking him for that 
 purpose. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Jones , 457 Pa. 563, 
 319 A.2d 142 (1974)). Flight or evasion of arrest is a circumstance to go to 
 the jury. See Beckham , 334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d 
 at 612; State v. Turnage , 107 S.C. 478, 93 S.E. 182 (1917); see 
 also State v. Byers , 277 S.C. 176, 284 S.E.2d 360 (1981) 
 (recognizing that evidence of flight is proper and that it is oftentimes appropriate 
 for counsel to argue to the jury the inferences growing out of flight); Grant , 275 S.C. at 408, 272 S.E.2d at 171 (stating that while a jury charge on flight 
 as evidence of guilt is improper, admission of evidence and argument by counsel 
 concerning it are allowed). 

 Testimony established that Appellant fled the scene when police attempted 
 to arrest him. In South Carolina, Appellants flight constitutes evidence of 
 his guilt. 

 III. Criminal Conspiracy 

 Criminal conspiracy is statutorily defined as a combination between two or 
 more persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or a lawful 
 object by unlawful means. S.C. Code Ann. 16-17-410 (2003); accord State v. Gordon , 356 S.C. 143, 588 S.E.2d 105 (2003); State v. Follin , 
 352 S.C. 235, 573 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 2002) cert. denied , State v. 
 Horne , 324 S.C. 372, 478 S.E.2d 289 (Ct. App. 1996); cf. LaMotte 
 v. Punch Line of Columbia , 296 S.C. 66, 370 S.E.2d 711 (1988) (comparing 
 civil conspiracy, which is a combination of two or more persons joining for 
 the purpose of injuring plaintiff and causing special damage to plaintiff, with 
 criminal conspiracy). 

 This statutory pronouncement is declaratory of the common law definition of 
 conspiracy. See State v. Fleming , 243 S.C. 265, 133 S.E.2d 800 
 (1963) (observing the predecessor to 16-17-410 was declaratory of the common 
 law definition). The crime of conspiracy has long been recognized in this state. See, e.g., State v. De Witt , 20 S.C.L. (2 Hill) 282 (1834) (affirming 
 conspiracy as a viable common law offense and discussing the breadth of its 
 applicability). 

 Historically, conspiracy was a misdemeanor. See State v. Ferguson , 
 221 S.C. 300, 306, 70 S.E.2d 355, 358 (1952) (Conspiracy is a common-law offense 
 and is a misdemeanor.). Currently, conspiracy is a felony and carries a maximum 
 sentence of $5,000 or five years imprisonment. S.C. Code Ann. 16-17-410 (2003). 
 A person who is convicted of the crime of conspiracy must not be given a greater 
 fine or sentence than he would receive if he carried out the unlawful act contemplated 
 by the conspiracy and had been convicted of the unlawful act contemplated by 
 the conspiracy . . . . Id.   

 The gravamen of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement, or combination. State v. Dasher , 278 S.C. 454, 298 S.E.2d 215 (1982); see also State v. Buckmon , 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001) (The 
 essence of a conspiracy is the agreement.). In criminal conspiracy it is 
 not necessary to prove an overt act. The gist of the crime is the unlawful 
 combination. The crime is then complete, even though nothing further is done. Ferguson at 303, 70 S.E.2d at 356 (citing State v. Ameker , 73 
 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906)). 

 A formal or express agreement need not be established. Horne at 381, 
 478 S.E.2d at 293. A tacit, mutual understanding, resulting in the willful 
 and intentional adoption of a common design by two or more persons is sufficient, 
 provided the common purpose is to do an unlawful act either as a means or an 
 end. Id. (citation omitted). Professor McAninch explains: The mere 
 fact that two persons happened to be doing the same thing at the same time does 
 not compel the conclusion that there was a conspiracy. William Shepard McAninch&amp;W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina , 476 (4th 
 ed. 2002). In State v. Ameker , 73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906), our 
 supreme court placed its approbation on the following explanation of conspiracy 
 given by the trial judge: 
 
 [S]uppose, Mr. Foreman, 
 that you and the gentleman on your left would go out in the streets of Orangeburg 
 and commit an assault and battery on some other person, that would be an unlawful 
 act, but it would not be a conspiracy, unless there was an agreement between 
 you to do the act before doing it. It is an agreement to do an unlawful 
 act that is the gist of the whole matter. 
 
 Id. at 339, 53 S.E. at 487. 

 In State v. Mouzon , 321 S.C. 27, 467 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 1995), the 
 defendant appealed his conviction for conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. 
 One witness testified that on the night in question, several individuals, including 
 the defendant, were present where drug transactions were taking place. Id. at 32, 467 S.E.2d at 125. We reversed the conviction, holding: 
 
 [T]o prove conspiracy, it is not enough that a group of people separately intend 
 to distribute drugs in a single area, nor enough that their activities occasionally 
 or sporadically place them in contact with each other. What is needed is proof 
 they intended to act together for their shared mutual benefit within the scope of the conspiracy charged. 
 
 Id. at 32-33, 467 S.E.2d at 125 (internal quotation marks and citation 
 omitted); see also State v. Gunn , 313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 75 
 (1993) (holding it is not enough for the offense of conspiracy that a group 
 of people separately intend to distribute drugs in a single area, nor that their 
 activities occasionally or sporadically place them in contact with each other). 

 Because it takes at least two persons to enter into an agreement, 
 there must be at least two members of a conspiracy. See State v. 
 Jackson , 7 S.C. (7 Rich.) 283 (1876). Yet they need not all be indicted 
 or named. Indeed, an indictment charging that the named defendant and other 
 persons unknown . . . did . . . conspire was approved in State v. Hightower , 
 221 S.C. 91, 94, 69, S.E.2d 363, 366 (1952)[.] McAninch&amp;Fairey 481. 
 In Hightower , there was ample evidence that the conspirators, though 
 unknown, did exist. McAninch&amp;Fairey 481. 

 A conspiracy to commit a crime does not merge with the completed 
 offense. State v. Rutledge , 232 S.C. 223, 101 S.E.2d 289 (1957); see 
 also Ferguson at 303-04, 70 S.E.2d at 356-57 (observing that a conspiracy 
 does not merge with a completed crime, but is a distinct offense in itself 
 and punishable as such, notwithstanding that the object of the conspiracy has 
 been accomplished). 

 State v. Wells , 249 S.C. 249, 153 S.E.2d 904 (1967) recognized 
 the existence of Whartons Rule in South Carolina, but denied its application 
 under the facts of Wells . Whartons Rule states that where 
 
 co-operation or 
 concert between two or more persons is essential to the commission of a substantive 
 crime and there is no ingredient of an alleged conspiracy that is not present 
 in the substantive crime, it is held that the persons necessarily involved cannot 
 be charged with conspiracy to commit the substantive offense and also with the 
 substantive crime itself. 
 
 Id. at 256, 153 S.E.2d at 907-08; see also Ferguson at 
 303, 70 S.E.2d at 356 (It is true that in some cases where concerted action 
 is necessary, as for example in certain sexual offenses, it is not permitted 
 to charge one in the same indictment with a conspiracy and also with the substantive 
 crime.). Thus, 
 
 if the substantive offense requires by definition the concerted 
 action of two persons, as for example the crime of adultery, then those persons 
 cannot be convicted of conspiracy to commit the offense because this would merely 
 be a subterfuge to increase the legislatively authorized punishment for the 
 substantive offense. 
 
 McAninch&amp;Fairey 482. 

 Once an agreement has been reached, the crime of 
 conspiracy has been committed; no further act need take place. Conspiracy 
 is an inchoate offense, and is a crime in and of itself. 15A C.J.S. Conspiracy 98 (2002) (footnotes omitted); see Blacks Law Dictionary 1108 
 (7th ed. 1999) (defining inchoate offense as [a] step toward the commission 
 of another crime, the step in itself being serious enough to merit punishment.). 
 Prohibition of conspiracy serves two distinct purposes: the punishment of group 
 behavior and the control of inchoate activities. 15A C.J.S. Conspiracy 98. 
 
 The basis of conspiratorial liability is not to punish the 
 agreement per se, but, rather, like other inchoate crimes, to punish the firm 
 purpose to commit a substantive crime, while hopefully preventing the actual 
 commission thereof. 
 
 Id. ; see also McAninch&amp;Fairey 474 (The 
 basic rationale of conspiracy seems to be that the combination of two or more 
 persons makes it more likely that the criminal objective will be achieved, because 
 the co-conspirators may offer each other encouragement and support, thereby 
 rendering it less likely that the project will be abandoned.). 

 It need not be shown that either the object or the means agreed upon is an 
 indictable offense in order to establish a criminal conspiracy. It is sufficient 
 if the one or the other is unlawful. Fleming at 274, 133 S.E.2d at 
 805. Ameker demonstrates the breadth of activity that can give rise 
 to an indictment for conspiracy. 73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906). In Ameker , the defendant was convicted of unlawfully, feloniously, and 
 willfully conspir[ing] . . . for the purpose of hindering, preventing, and obstructing 
 certain citizens . . . [who were] engaging in social intercourse and peaceable 
 pastimes, such as are commonly enjoyed at picnics. . . Id. at 332-33, 
 53 S.C. at 484-85. The action arose when a group of picnickers was disturbed 
 by the defendant and several co-conspirators. Abe Ameker began playing his 
 banjo, while Cleveland Hooker danced and cursed. . . . One of the defendants 
 had a paddle in his hand, and the inevitable pistol was also in hand. Id. at 337, 53 S.E. at 486. One man was struck with the boat paddle, and knives 
 and guns were drawn before the engagement subsided. Id. The court upheld 
 Amekers conviction. 

 Our supreme court, in State v. Amerson , noted that a single conspiracy 
 may be established by completely different aggregations of proof so that there 
 appears to be several conspiracies. 311 S.C. at 319, 428 S.E.2d at 873 (1993) 
 (citation omitted). Consequently, a multi-pronged flexible totality of the 
 circumstances test is applied to determine whether there were two conspiracies 
 or merely one. Id. The test considers: 
 
 (1) the time periods covered by the alleged conspiracies; (2) the places where 
 the conspiracies are alleged to have occurred; (3) the persons charged as conspirators; 
 (4) the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the conspiracies, 
 or any other descriptions of offenses charged which indicate the nature and 
 scope of the activities being prosecuted; and (5) the substantive statutes alleged 
 to have been violated. 
 
 Id. 

 Once a conspiracy has been established, evidence establishing beyond a reasonable 
 doubt the connection of a defendant to the conspiracy, even though the connection 
 is slight, is sufficient to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy. Horne , 324 S.C. at 382, 478 S.E.2d at 294 (citing State v. Sullivan , 
 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981)). 

 Generally, the conspiracy is proven by overt acts committed in furtherance 
 of the conspiracy. Amerson , 311 S.C. at 319-20, 428 S.E.2d at 873. 
 However, overt acts are not necessary for a conspiracy conviction. It is axiomatic 
 that a conspiracy may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence or by circumstantial 
 evidence alone. Horne , 324 S.C. at 381, 478 S.E.2d at 294 (citing State 
 v. Childs , 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d 839 (1989)). Indeed, State v. Miller , 
 223 S.C. 128, 74 S.E.2d 582 (1953), notes: Often proof of conspiracy is necessarily 
 by circumstantial evidence alone. Id. at 133, 74 S.E.2d at 585 (citation 
 omitted). Because the actus reus of conspiracy is the agreement, the evidence 
 must prove the agreement, not the object thereof. McAninch observes, The agreement 
 might be difficult to establish by direct evidence if none of the co-conspirators 
 will talk. Consequently, the cases in this jurisdiction, as well as others, 
 which hold that the agreement can be established by circumstantial evidence 
 are legion. McAninch&amp;Fairey 476 (citations omitted). The State is 
 permitted great latitude in the introduction of circumstantial evidence to establish 
 the existence of a conspiratorial agreement. State v. Wilson , 315 S.C. 
 289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1993). 

 State v. Oliver , 275 S.C. 79, 267 S.E.2d 529 (1980), exemplifies the 
 sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to convict on conspiracy. Oliver was 
 indicted along with two other individuals for conspiracy to commit housebreaking 
 and grand larceny. Id. at 79, 267 S.E.2d at 530. The defendants were 
 accused and convicted of breaking into two houses. Upon conviction, Oliver 
 appealed, asserting the evidence was insufficient and his motion for a directed 
 verdict should have been granted. Id. at 79-80, 267 S.E.2d at 530. 
 Evidence showed Olivers codefendant, Willie Williams, rented a U-Haul truck 
 a few weeks before the crimes. On the day of the break-ins, Williams purchased 
 gasoline in the U-Haul truck approximately forty or fifty miles from the crime 
 scene, and a receipt for the gas purchase was found near one of the houses. 
 A neighbor of one of the homes observed the U-Haul parked in the neighborhood. 
 A filling station attendant and the neighbor both testified to seeing three 
 men wearing dark clothes in the truck. Similar shoe tracks were found at both 
 houses, indicating that the same individuals entered both places. Id. at 81, 267 S.E.2d at 531. Finally, a law enforcement officer arrested the defendants 
 approximately three miles from the scene of one of the homes. The defendants 
 were in the U-Haul truck and matched the descriptions given by the station attendant 
 and neighbor. The court found this evidence reasonably tended to establish 
 the guilt of appellants, and the trial judge properly denied their motions for 
 a directed verdict. Id. at 82, 267 S.E.2d at 531. The court stated: 
 
 Although there is no direct evidence that appellants and their 
 codefendant had a mutual understanding to commit housebreaking and larceny, 
 the facts and circumstances are susceptible to the reasonable inference that 
 they did in fact conspire to commit the unlawful acts. 
 
 Id. at 80, 267 S.E.2d at 530. 

 State v. Kelsey , 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998), involved the sufficiency 
 of evidence for a criminal conspiracy conviction. The appellant, Kelsey, and 
 several other individuals spent the day of July 11, 1994, building pipe bombs. 
 That night, they picked up the victim and took her to a party. Several hours 
 later the defendants offered to take the victim home. The court described the 
 events leading to the victims death: 
 
 Defendants and [victim] then got into Lees car, ostensibly to take [victim] 
 home. Lee was driving, Kelsey was in the passenger seat, and Payne and [the 
 victim] were in the backseat. Although [the victim] had given them directions 
 to her house, Lee detoured in the opposite direction. . . . Lee turned around 
 and saw that Payne had [victim] in a strangle hold type position. Lee continued 
 to drive. A few minutes later, Lee heard two quick, empty thud type sounds. 
 . . . Kelsey testified that he had also turned around and saw that [victims] 
 body was limp, her face was pale, and her lips were blue. 

 Lee once again drove away from the bridge. He got approximately 100 feet down 
 the road when Payne told him to stop the car. Defendants pulled [victim] out 
 of the car and carried her into the woods and up an embankment where they placed 
 her on the ground. Lee returned to the car. Payne and Kelsey remained by [victim]s 
 body. 
 
 Kelsey testified that while he was standing over [victim]s body, 
 Payne instructed him to place a pipe bomb into [victim]s mouth. Kelsey complied. 
 Payne then lit the fuse, and the two ran. A few seconds later, the bomb exploded. 
 Defendants returned to Kirchner&apos;s house where they fell asleep. 

 Id. at 59-61, 502 S.E.2d 67-68. 

 The court 
 upheld the conspiracy conviction under the following analysis: 
 
 In State v. Childs , 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d 839 (1989), the defendant 
 argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict 
 on a conspiracy charge. We disagreed, finding that the following facts tended 
 to prove the defendants guilt: evidence that defendant knew codefendant; defendant 
 was seen running from the area where the victims body was found; bloodhounds 
 had tracked the victims scent to the codefendants house; and defendant had 
 given a written statement stating that he agreed to be a lookout for codefendant. 

 In this case, evidence indicated that Kelsey was instrumental in constructing 
 the pipe bombs at Kirchners house; that Kelsey was with Lee and Payne on the 
 night of the murder; that Kelsey helped Payne carry [victim] into the woods; 
 that Kelsey and Payne were alone together in the woods with [victim]s body; 
 and that Kelsey placed the pipe bomb into [victim]s mouth. We therefore find 
 the evidence was sufficient to submit the conspiracy charge to the jury. 
 
 Id. at 63-64, 502 S.E.2d at 70. 

 In State v. Follin , 352 S.C. 235, 573 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. 
 denied , Follin was convicted of aiding and abetting embezzlement, obtaining 
 goods and services by false pretenses, and conspiracy. One of her issues on 
 appeal was that her motion for a directed verdict should have been granted on 
 the conspiracy charge. The facts underlying Follin involved the diversion 
 of nearly $2.5 million from Sumter County School District 17 (District 17) by 
 Adolph Joseph Klein, the Assistant Superintendent in charge of Financial Affairs 
 for District 17. Id. at 240, 573 S.E.2d at 814. Follin was a travel 
 agent and owner of Follin Travel who handled the travel arrangements for District 
 17. From 1987 to 1997, Klein diverted nearly $1.5 million in personal travel 
 expenses for himself and his friends and family by booking luxury vacations 
 through Follin, which were paid for by District 17. The Follin court 
 explained, 
 
 In 1995, Klein learned that if travel plans made one week were cancelled before 
 the Friday of that same week, no payment would be required on the trip, the 
 invoice would be voided, and the invoice number would no longer appear in Follin&apos;s 
 computerized accounting system. He began using invoices to get District 17 
 to pay for his junket travel. Klein would request an invoice from Follin for 
 what appeared to be legitimate travel for a school group or a District 17 employee. 
 Klein would then request that Follin void the invoice prior to the Friday of 
 that week. Follin would cancel the trip in her computer and stamp void on 
 her copy of the invoice. However, Klein submitted his clean copy of the invoice 
 to District 17 for payment. Klein called these invoices special invoices 
 for the junket travel. After the check was issued to Follin on the special 
 invoice, Klein would attach a note to the check identifying for Follin the invoice 
 number to which she should apply the check. The invoice number did not match 
 the number on the special invoice submitted to District 17 for payment but matched 
 the invoice number of another of Klein&apos;s junket trips. 
 
 Id. at 240-41, 573 S.E.2d at 814-15. When District officials began 
 investigating Kleins travel expenses, Follin attempted to cover up the scheme 
 by asserting the District had a refund credit. 

 We found sufficient evidence to support the denial of a directed 
 verdict on criminal conspiracy: 
 
 Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, Klein would not 
 have been able to proceed with his travel scheme without Follins assistance. 
 Despite the fact that there was not a spoken agreement between the two to defraud 
 District 17, the uncontradicted evidence showed that Follin knowingly assisted 
 Klein by creating false records indicating District 17 had a credit. Klein 
 testified that he and Follin conspired through their actions. Although the 
 agreement was not written or verbalized, evidence was presented that an arrangement 
 was reached between Klein and Follin to defraud District 17. Because there 
 was evidence that reasonably tended to prove Follin conspired with Klein, the 
 trial judge properly denied Follins motion for a directed verdict as to this 
 charge. 
 
 Id. at 267, 573 S.E.2d at 829-30. See also State v. Clark , 
 286 S.C. 432, 334 S.E.2d 121 (1985) (finding ample evidence . . . to support 
 appellants conviction of conspiracy to housebreak where appellant was found 
 near the crime scene; was apprehended as he drove away with his headlights off; 
 originally denied knowing his codefendant, who was later determined to be his 
 cousin; and admitted his codefendant told him of the larceny plans, but denied 
 any participation in them). 

 In the instant case, sufficient evidence exists to support the trial 
 judges denial of Appellants motion for a directed verdict. Appellant was 
 in the vehicle immediately after the burglary was perpetrated, and he fled when 
 Jonathan stopped the car. Jonathans statement contradicts his trial testimony, 
 and it was the responsibility of the jury to weigh both his statement and his 
 testimony. According to his statement, Jonathan witnessed Appellant (1) carrying 
 stolen saws from the store to the car; (2) loading saws into the car; and (3) 
 handing John the saws from the backseat. Furthermore, the police found bolt 
 cutters, gloves, and flashlights in the vehicleitems that could give rise to 
 an inference that John, Jonathan, and Appellant planned the burglary. Additionally, 
 though Jonathan testified that they proceeded through the drive-through at the 
 restaurant rather than eating inside, the police did not find any trash from 
 the fast-food restaurant in the vehicle. As in Oliver , although this 
 evidence does not constitute direct evidence of an agreement, the facts and 
 circumstances are susceptible to the reasonable inference that Appellant conspired 
 to commit the unlawful acts. Ample evidence exists from which a jury could 
 infer either an express plan, or a tacit, mutual understanding to commit the 
 burglary. Accordingly, the trial judges ruling is affirmed. 

 IV. Coercion/Duress 

 In State v. Robinson , 294 S.C. 120, 363 S.E.2d 104 (1987), 
 the South Carolina Supreme Court explained the defense of coercion: 
 
 To excuse a criminal act, the degree of coercion must be present, imminent, 
 and of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious 
 bodily harm if the act is not done. Coercion is no defense if there is any 
 reasonable way, other than committing the crime, to escape the threat of harm. 
 The fear of injury must be reasonable. 
 
 Id. at 121-22, 363 S.E.2d at 104 (citations omitted). Similarly, in State v. Benjamin , 345 S.C. 470, 549 S.E.2d 258 (2001), our supreme court 
 provided the following definition of duress: 
 
 To establish duress which will excuse a criminal act, the degree 
 of coercion must be present, imminent, and of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded 
 apprehension of death or serious bodily harm if the act is not done. Coercion 
 is no defense if there is any reasonable way, other than committing the crime, 
 to escape the threat of harm. The fear of injury must be reasonable. 
 
 Id. at 474 n.3, 549 S.E.2d at 260 n.3. Coercion and duress envision 
 a third person compelling another by threat of immediate physical violence to 
 commit a crime against someone else or someone elses property. State v. 
 Holliday , 333 S.C. 585, 588, 510 S.E.2d 436, 438 (Ct. App. 1998) (citations 
 omitted). 

 Our review of this record convinces us that the evidence in regard 
 to coercion and duress is de minimis. Additionally, the issues of coercion 
 and duress were factual issues to be decided by the trial jury. 

 CONCLUSION 

 For the reasons stated herein, the trial courts decision is 

 AFFIRMED. 

 STILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.
