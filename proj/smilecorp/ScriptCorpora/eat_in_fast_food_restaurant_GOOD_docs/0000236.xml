Description
 Recent restaurant reviews have cited this as &quot;the best burgers in San Francisco.&quot; Joel, the proprietor for over 30 years, vehemently agrees. The decor at Joe&apos;s Cable Car Restaurant is simple. The inside resembles a fast food restaurant, plastic booths and shiny counter tops. The burgers are large and cooked to order. The menu offers a new and unique spin on traditional hamburgers including the chili burger and the avocado burger.   No Photos Available Image Search» See all San Francisco Restaurants»   Map   Add to Trip     Loading...

Been there, done it, will not do it again! Sorry Joe, $40 for two burgers, fries and drinks! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By Michelle Payne , 2/25/12 I went here when I first moved to the neighborhood and thought this was going to be the best burger of my life. I ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and shake to go. I almost fell over when she said $28. I just paid it cuz they had already started making it and I felt dumb for not realizing what they charge with all the&apos;extras&apos;, like cheese. I have never and will never go back Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By george , 10/28/11 very over priced i payed 27 bucks for my meal and i was willing to pay because i expected to have the best burger in my life but it wasnt. you&apos;re better off going to in n out Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 4/21/10 I&apos;ve lived in SF all my life and went to Joes for yeaes because it&quot;was&quot;good. But, he just can&apos;t justify the outrageous prices. I talked to a waitress who told me&quot;he&quot;just doesn&apos;t get it and business is down. I think he&apos;s living in the past..the glory days when people had money. The reality is who can afford a mediocre $13 (with cheese) burger when the quality isn&apos;t as good as a $6.00 burger somewhere else? Get a clue Joe..you&apos;re driving customers away. I for one, was loyal, but you obviously don&apos;t want my business.Get rid of all the shiney stuf, and just make good quality food with fair prices and maybe we&apos;ll be back. If I could, I&apos;d post zero stars. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 4/17/10 The service was OK!! Food just OK ffor us,...really nothing special.We were a bit disappointed because of its recommdation from Guy!Although it was just OK...not worth the trip really...we have eaten in WAY BETTER places Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 3/28/10 Great custom burgers in an ambience like a toy box. Seriously; the Santa goes up in March and the Christmas lights NEVER come down! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 3/28/10 Deliberately a bit shabby but pleasantly laid out, this burger joint is better than average due to the custom meat grinds as Joe himself may well describe to you. Worth the extra few dollars for the history, the quality and even Joe himself. Not the greatest area. but the place itself feels safe enough. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 3/28/10 Expensive for a burger, but possibly the best in town. &quot;Joe grinds his own fresh Chuck daily.&quot; Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 3/23/10 Easily the best burger in the Bay area! You can have it your way and I&apos;m loving it! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 3/23/10 Best burgers in town. This &quot;neon&quot; palace is fun. The 3 sizes of burgers make it great for any appetite. Limited menu is fine as long as you want burger, fries, onion rings, beer and/or milk shakes. Was this review helpful?
