10 Weird Things I’ve Experienced At Low Wage Jobs
 September 7, 2011 
by Schmutzie • 44 Comments 
Once upon a time, I worked a string of jobs that were less than desirable, but they paid the rent and kept me in food, so I stayed at them despite some of their drawbacks. Most of us have been in that position at some point. Remember that time you worked for chump change serving burgers to yahoos? Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.

 

Over the years, I’ve served burgers, sold records and tapes, worked a $10-watch cart, sold circus tickets, done telephone surveys, run several sections in a large bookstore, been a barrista, temped as a secretary, worked in a hotel gift shop, et cetera. When I look back, I’m kind of amazed at all of the weirdo experiences I’ve endured in the name of a paycheck.

Here is but a sampling my low-wage delights.

 

10 Weird Things I’ve Experienced At (or because of) Low Wage Jobs

 1. I worked at a fast food joint for a few months when I was 18. My supervisor was very proud of the fact that his armpits produced no sweat. One day, while we were closing up, he said“I don’t ever have to wear deodorant, and I still smell great. Here. Take a sniff.”He leaned in to me with his arm over his head, offering me his armpit.

 2. The cook in that same restaurant called me in to the kitchen to take a look at something in the freezer. When I walked into the back, I found him standing completely pantsless, one finger pointed at his penis as though he were displaying it on The Price Is Right .

 3. My boss at a cheap watch cart invited all the employees out for drinks after work one night. He told us to meet him at this dive bar where he showed up an hour late high on cocaine with a prostitute on his arm. The next day we were told that the company was too broke to send us our paychecks for the next two weeks. Hookers and blow really do cut into a business budget, apparently.

 4. A customer, after eating an entire meal — with gusto, I might add — threatened to throw up right there on the counter if I didn’t refund him his money, because he didn’t“love”his burger. He proceeded to enact dry heaving over the register. When I grabbed a spray bottle and cloth and tapped my foot, as though waiting for him to finish, he gave up and left.

 5. I couldn’t make up proper whipped cream for about a week at work, because the little pressurized gas containers I made the whipped cream with kept disappearing. It turned out that the punk kids who came in after school were stealing them to get high, so I started playing classical music from three to six o’clock every afternoon. They stopped coming in. Classical music is high school punk kids’kryptonite.

 6. There was a woman named Lydia that I met over the phone while working at a phone sales job. She was uninterested in what I was selling, but we bonded quickly, and I took to giving her a call every day on my break. She kept trying to set me up with her son.“He’s going to be a doctor, you know,”she’d tell me in way of convincing me.“But I’m already married,”I’d tell her.“Oh, that’s alright,”she’d say.“You’re both still young, and not all marriages last forever.”We had this conversation at least three times a week.

 7. I always got stuck with cleaning out the washrooms in this one restaurant. Our clientele was not always higher end, to put it mildly, and it was often an adventure that required a strong stomach. I wasn’t overly surprised, then, when I went in to clean the men’s urinals one afternoon and found that a sizable bite had been taken out of the deodorizing puck next to a urinal drain. The next task I was given to do was to create a sign that read“Please don’t eat the puck. It is not a mint.”

 8. I was working the evening shift at a hotel gift shop when a man came in and started chatting me up. Guests often did this when they were bored and wandering around the hotel.“Your feet must get tired with all the standing. Let me show you how to help that,”he said. He asked me to take off my shoe so he could show me some exercises. It wasn’t until he started breathing heavily and broke out into a sweat that I realized he was a foot fetishist getting off on watching my toes stretch. He had apparently hit up several other hotel employees for his live foot porn. We couldn’t decide if that was sexual abuse or not.

 9. I was temping as a receptionist. During my first shift, I had a case of the hiccups. My supervisor told me that that was unacceptable and said“I’m watching you”like I was being warned. Later, when I asked if I could be relieved from the reception desk so I could use the washroom, she said“That’s it. You obviously don’t want to be here”, and she fired me. Naturally occurring bodily functions were not a part of my receptioning duties, I guess.

 10. I was asked to edit a letter for my boss at a small Canadian newspaper. He called me into his office to face him and two other supervisors and demanded to know why I had corrected his spelling of the word conceived .“You asked me to edit your letter, sir, and so I also corrected it for spelling.”“I spelled conceive correctly, though,”he said.“But you spelled it with an i-e, and it’s e-i. The rule is that it’s I before E, except after C.”He insisted that I was wrong and told me to pack up my things and leave the building immediately. And that, my friends, is how I came to be fired for knowing how to spell well.

 And you? I know you must have low-wage job weirdness in your history. Please share news from your adventures in employment craziness. It’s the sharing that keeps us sane.

Let’s see…
1) I realized that drunk rednecks, coming out of a concert at the Wisconsin state fair, will not hesitate to hit on a 14yo girl and tip her $10 for a crappy ass snow-cone.
2) I was once hit by a car while pushing carts back into the grocery store where I bagged groceries…through the snow the day before Xmas Eve.
3) Learned that when you inventory p0rn, there are LOTS of titles that begin with“A”.
4) That senior citizens will still ask for a discount on the $1.99 Grand Slam breakfast at Denny’s.
5)…and off the $.33/lb bananas at the grocery store.
6) Learned that slimy pathetic restaurant managers who are in their mid-40s and balding think its flirting (and not creepy at ALL) when they try and impress you with stories of how they’re decendants of Rob Roy.
7) And that there is no good way to sneak away from your desk when the woman in the cubicle next to you is having phone sex with her husband.

I love the spelling termination. I showed up a newspaper editor in an impossible little town during an interview. He had me proofread a test page and hot off my advanced English exams–porn for type-A perfectionists–I found all kinds of problems that he hadn’t intentionally put in. I didn’t get the job.

I get why it irritated our respective superiors, but shouldn’t our knowledge have GAINED us employment? And made them think how awesome it was that they were getting someone who knew what they were doing? At least, that’s what I would want if I had newspaper.

Ego is a strange, self-defeating beast. All I can figure is that he didn’t want to be told how to write more good by A) somebody young, B) a female, or C) anybody but his mommy. If it were me doing the hiring I’d be all over somebody I could just trust to make my organization look more professional.

Ah! I have had this too–I didn’t get hired because I had a slightly strained discussion during an interview over the correct use of apostrophes. The agency who sent me told me I should be less evangelistic about it. I thought that if you’re going to write, you should do it properly. I still feel a bit grumpy about this to this day!

Lifeguard at a Seattle-area pool. About once a month or so, a man would come in to swim (well, paddle) laps and he was always wearing a 1950s-type white bathing cap with a chin strap…I think it even had little white flowers on it too. Usually there was hardly anyone there but one day someone came in and started swimming in the same lane as this guy because the lanes were crowded. He totally lost it and started screaming at this poor woman, in a heavy Russian accent, about how this was HIS lane and NO ONE else could be in it, etc. etc. With the bathing cap on. I had to ask him to leave, and I managed not to bust into hysterical laughter until after he had disappeared (still muttering) into the locker room

At Dutch Growers, the owner Tim once told me that if his wife told me to do anything that contradicted what he told me to do, that I was not to say“but Tim wanted me to do this”. After two weeks of working there, I felt quite sorry for the only person in the store who had to put up with her outside of working hours.

One Saturday morning my co-worker came stumbling into the staff room and slurred,“I TOTALLY GOT SPRAYED WITH BEAR SPRAY AT A PARTY LAST NIGHT.”She routinely was hungover on Saturday mornings, or still mostly drunk, but she was so much more fun to work with that way so she was never reprimanded.

Maybe low-wage jobs foster an“I don’t care”attitude that is infectious.

Now I feel like I’ve led a sheltered life. My only low wage job experience was working at Sbarro’s during college. I had a few interesting interactions, but nothing like the items above.

In fact, the worst was when I temped at a Sbarro in the mall near my parents’house (over summer vacation). I began working and couldn’t find any latex gloves. Asking around, they finally found a box for me, but looked at me funny for wanting to put gloves on my hands when handling food.

This was also the eatery where I alerted my manager to mold growing in the pepperoni. He looked at it, pulled out a handful of moldy slices, threw them away and declared the rest of the bag fit for our customers.

We also never threw pizza away. The slice could be made at 11am and we’d still serve it at 5pm. My college location would toss whole pies if they weren’t eaten within an hour.

To this day, I have trouble eating at Sbarro (especially mall locations).

1) Saw a 15 yr old kid wearing a white t-shirt and paper hot-dog hat sing“Inna-Godda-Davida”while balancing a broom in the palm of his hand on a very greasy floor of a fast-food restaurant.
2) smoked dope in the walk-in freezer of same fast-food restaurant
3) mixed vodka in the lemonade cooler (same again)–worked there from 14 to 17
4) In college bartended at a bar across from an American Legion (avg age about 75). Every night when the Legion closed one old man would bring me a 3 Musketeers Bar
5) At the same bar I sold a lot of Pabst Blue Ribbon in a can for 90 cents. SOBs wouldn’t even leave the damned dime.
6) Kept a can of mace in my bag for leaving the bar at 4am. Entertained myself by daydreaming of going down the bar and macing EVERYONE!
7) Worked at a steak-house and had to wear a red shirt with white polka dots and an embroidered cow saying“moo”on the breast.

In high school I worked at a meat store and deli that belonged to my best friend’s father. Once I slipped on a cow’s head on the floor of the walk-in freezer. Years later I became a vegetarian for a year. I’m not sure these things are related, but they could be.

At a gas station I worked at I had an older lady come out of the bathroom and tell me“It’s a good thing that picture is stuck tight to the wall!”
and used to wait on a guy who came in wearing only white Fruit-of-the-Loom Boxer Briefs. Thin ones.
And was constantly asked“That sign says“Out of Order.”Does that mean it isn’t working?

I was a caddy at a bridge tournament when I was 17. Those people are some of the most intense beings on the face of the earth. Two days, for 12 hours each day my job was to stand in a corner waiting for someone at a table to put their hand up so I could run over and grab their cards&amp;switch them with another table. Apparently I was not doing it to one man’s satisfaction who stopped me to tell me exactly how I was supposed to be picking up the cards, and which way I should be putting them down, where I should stand at the table, etc. He stopped with“don’t you know anything?”I said“No sir, I do not, nor do I care”and walked away. Then I let my friend who had talked me into that insanity deal with him the rest of the weekend. I don’t even remember how much I got paid, I just know it was no where near enough.

Great stories. Racking my brain and I can’t think of anything too weird. Working as a secretary with all Orthodox Jews. They’d put all the Chinese food on my desk so they wouldn’t get caught eating treyfe. Shrimp and pork. They told me they wanted to belong to a strict religion so they could decide which rules to break–not be reform where someone else decided which rules didn’t matter.

The worst job I ever had was being the milkshake girl.

We had a blender, so so old, like 1960′s..I remember it being stainless steel, and it looked like a mini B17 bomber.

Anyway, I hated hated hated hearing,“I’ll take a shake”because the the blender was so old, it had a short in it, and every time I’d touch it to turn it on, I’d get a shock.

Not a little one, either.

Hated that job.

Oh, man. So many shitty jobs. So many stories. I worked at a Kinko’s Copies in college where I was sexually harassed by half the staff (male and female), including my manager, and regularly lambasted by grad students who expected perfectly printed and bound dissertations immediately from overworked minimum wage drones like me. I preferred working the graveyard shift there, where my friends and I would drink malt liqour in the break room and use the equipment to make giant novelty drivers’licenses, etc.

I worked at a spa/sauna-complex. The owners were very cheap, didn’t pay us much, but the hours were good.
I didn’t really notice how cheap they were, until I served a guest some lemonade. The bottle of syrup was almost empty, and as I do at home, I added a little water, to make the syrup come out more easily. They thought it was the best thing ever, saving money on syrup! And I was strangely ashamed for being praised.

I commented yesterday, but it never materialized.

I worked at Chico’s clothing store for awhile, which I enjoyed. I did have an awkward encounter with a customer, though, who insisted that I help him pick out a bunch of clothes for his stepson who had just come out of the closet. He didn’t seem to quite understand that not all gay men or boys like to dress in women’s clothing. He justified the shopping spree by saying“But he’s gay now, so he needs to dress like it.”

my worst experience with low wage jobs was at 17 when i worked in retail selling furniture. this older guy came in asking for the most firm mattress we had. when i told him we had one in the basement not out on the floor, he wanted to see it. I brought him down there to see the bed and he told me he needed to test it out. I figured he meant like the rest of our customers who lay on their back. Instead he proceeded to get on all fours, and test out his missionary position on the bed to see if it was to his liking. Pretty awful for my virgin eyes to witness.

Your early resume sounds like mine–waitress, office temp, hot air balloon ground crew, to name a few. I worked one winter break in college at one of those places in the mall where they make the cinnamon rolls up front by the window where people can watch. The owners let their teen-aged niece manage the place, especially on the closing shift–and she was such a b*tch, major control issues. When she would leave the shop and we were cleaning up, she would *lock us in* so we could not leave until she returned. There was no back door -we were in a mall. When I quit this job, I asked the manager on a Sunday if the schedule had been drafted for the upcoming week (starting Monday) and of course the answer was yes, at which point I awkwardly said,“well, I meant to tell you not to put me on it.”And that was that.
