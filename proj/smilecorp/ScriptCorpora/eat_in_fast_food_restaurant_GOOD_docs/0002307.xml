Pair accused of trying to sell dead father&apos;s food stamps
 

 October 27, 2011 6:54 AM | Print Story | E-Mail Story Kevin Ellis 
Police say two people, one of them the deceased man&apos;s daughter, tried to sell a food stamp card that had belonged to a man who died in September.

Dawn Elizabeth Green, 26, of 2433 Myers St., Gastonia, and Robert Allen Price, 43, of Kings Mountain both face charges of food stamp fraud.

Gastonia police investigators say the two tried to sell the card Wednesday at a fast food restaurant on North New Hope Road.

The food stamp card belonged to Green&apos;s father, Robert Green, who died Sept. 10, according to an arrest warrant.

Green was booked into Gaston County Jail under a $5,000 bond. Price has a $20,000 bond, but he faces additional charges of larceny and possession of a stolen vehicle.
