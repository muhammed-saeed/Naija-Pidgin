 Roberta Adamo 

When the chef at her former husbands restaurant left unexpectedly, it was Roberta Adamo who jumped in to begin making pasta with a recipe she found in a cookbook and childhood memories of making pasta at her grandmothers side. It was here that Robertas Pasta Chef career began. Adamos next stop was a position close to home at Catellis Restaurant in Voorhees.

The opportunity to work with Francesco Martorella brought Adamo to downtown Philadelphias Brasserie Perrier, where she was hired to create pasta for the Italian section of the restaurants esteemed fusion menu. Martorellas purist approach to pasta (egg or spinach dough, potato Gnocchi) gave Adamo a chance to perfect the basic foundations of pasta making.

She joined The Ritz Carlton after 3 years at the Brasserie Perrier. The Ritz connected Adamo to Chefs Kai Lerman and Alberto Vonoli. From the Ritz, Adamo was lured to Penne. She contacted her good friend Chef Ed Vadden, who, along with Pennes current Chef de Cuisine Eileen Watkin, created the culinary magic that supported Adamos specialized art of pasta. After opening Penne as the Pasta Chef, Adamo recently accepted the position of Restaurant Chef, allowing her to continue spreading the philosophy that food should sing and not scream any one note louder than the other. Balance is key, whether its taste, texture, color or temperature. It is an art I adore and I am thrilled every day I have a chance to experience it.

Roberta Adamo, Eileen Watkin and Ed Vaddum of Penne restaurant- 2006 Winner of Philly Cooks competition…their entre took the gold“Best Dish of the Year.”Previously in 2005, they won“Best Pasta”in Philadelphia Magazine. In 2004, their entry in the Philly Cookscompetition won Best Entre. Roberta has since moved on from Penne restaurant, but plans to open up her own restaurant in the near future.

 Anthony M. Bonett 

A second generation lifelong Philadelphian, Chef Anthony Bonett took an exciting road to his present position as Executive Chef and Operating Partner of the Oceanaire Seafood Room, Philadelphia.. Throughout his varied career Chef Bonett has developed a signature style that emphasizes fresh, seasonal ingredients to create fantastic dishes from the traditional to the more exotic.

Like many who make their livelihood behind the stove young Anthony watched and learned from his parents, both accomplished amateur cooks, in the family kitchen. But the culinary bug had not yet truly bitten. After attending Temple University, Anthony enlisted in the U.S. Navy working as a Weather Observer on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal. During his tour aboard ship Anthony also worked in the ships kitchens, preparing meals for over 5,000 sailors, the Admiral and his executive staff. His voyages took him to Provence, the French Riviera, Italy, Greece and Turkey, affording him the opportunity to study the culinary wonders of the exotic ports which became the classrooms where Chef Bonett honed his appreciation of world cuisine. This experience cemented his decision to trade his Navy tools for chefs utensils, and after his discharge, Bonett enrolled at his hometowns acclaimed Restaurant School in September of 1992. As a student he returned abroad to study in Burgundy. Achieving his Associates Degree in Culinary Arts in 1993, Anthony converted his apprenticeship at Philadelphias Four Seasons Hotel, under Chef Jean-Marie Lacroix, into his first paid position in chefs whites. With this experience Bonett soon secured the position of Executive Chef at the popular local bistro, 16th Street Bar&amp;Grill.

Two years later, opportunity knocked again as Anthony joined celebrated local chef Tony Clark at his eponymous, critically-acclaimed restaurant on Broad Street. After two promotions he found himself in charge of a staff of 15 cooks, helping Tony Clark attain the title of Best New Restaurant, Food&amp;Wine Magazine-1996. Ready for a bigger challenge the chef took the post as Executive Chef at Bon Apptit Management Company, the exclusive food service provider and caterer for the University of Pennsylvania. Working out of the grandly historic 40-acre Wharton Sinkler Conference Center near the citys upscale Chestnut Hill section, Chef Bonett orchestrated all catering events held at the Center plus the inside and outside catering facilities on the University=s main campus.

Seeking a return to a la carte dining, Anthony moved to Old Citys Philadelphia Fish&amp;Company in the summer of 1999, again as Executive Chef. During his tenure at this popular seafood restaurant Chef Anthony began to receive the attention of the local press, not only for his culinary successes, but also for his contributions and appearances at many high profile civic and charitable events throughout the region. In mid-2001 the owners of upscale Opus 21 invited Bonett to head their kitchen. During his time there, the restaurant received several local and national awards under Anthonys leadership. He became the star of an All Lobster Dinner in January of 2003, which he prepared to a sold-out group at the James Beard House in New York City.

In Fall 2003, Anthony became chef at Wild Tuna Restaurant located in Wayne, PA. It was here that Chef Anthony developed his own menu style that featured creative presentations that adapted to seasonal changes. Richard Robinson, owner of Wild Tuna and former co-owner of Rock Lobster, was thrilled to have his restaurants kitchen lead by one of Philadelphias most talented and respected chefs.

In the summer of 2005 Anthony was recruited by The Oceanaire Seafood Room, to open and operate what will be one of Philadelphias most ambitious restaurant projects. Chef Bonett states,“I am happy to be adding my 15 year cooking career to the well regarded Oceanaire Seafood Room product in bringing Philadelphia this ultra fresh dining experience.”The restaurant opened on October 28. 2006 and is located at 700 Walnut St in the citys historic Washington Square section.

 Jim Burke 

The first time that food really became important to Jim was when he began working with Master Chef Vince Alberici at The Marker in the Adams Mark Hotel. He adopted cooking as a craft, willingly giving himself to long hours as well as the physical and mental demands of the job. Chef Alberici taught Jim what it really meant to be a chef and to this day epitomizes many of the qualities necessary for success. It was during this time that Jim really learned the fundamentals of cooking and how to build on them

Reading the book Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking by Marcella Hazan influenced Jim greatly. The text, not just the recipes, introduced Jim to the culture of Italian cooking and he became immersed in learning about Italian food and its history. This interest intensified when Jim began working at Vetri. Jim grew tremendously during the two years he worked there and was afforded much freedom in his cooking. From there, Jim left to pursue his dream of cooking in Italy.

Jim had the honor of working in Ristorante Frosio, a Michelin starred restaurant with Chef Paolo Frosio located in Alme, a small town outside of Bergamo. There he learned the difficult task of exalting a few pristine ingredients rather than losing the integrity of those ingredients in a random jumble. To really cook Italian was to cook simply and attentively. Beyond cooking, being immersed in a foreign culture gave Jim a magical glimpse into the world he had dreamed about. He continued to work in restaurants as well as vineyards for the next fifteen months. Jim saw vineyards whose owners and vintners were using fifteen hundred year old viniculture methods. It was an invigorating life experience and one that he has promised to never let fade away.

Upon returning to the United States, Jim became the chef of Vivo Enoteca in Wayne and received three stars in his first review. Jim then seized the opportunity to become the executive chef of Angelina in center city Philadelphia, where he put into practice the lessons learned from Michelin starred chefs, grandmothers, and everyone in between.

Of Chef Jim Burke’s appointment as Executive Chef of Angelina, Stephen Starr, has indicated“I can’t think of a better qualified chef to oversee the kitchen at Angelina.”“Jim understands the menu and cuisine like no one else. He lives, eats and breaths Italian food.”

In July 2005, the Starr Restaurant Organization closed Angelina. Since then, Jim has been splitting his time as a party chef for two high-end catering companies: Peachtree&amp;Ward Catering and Charles Roman Catering. In the last few months, however, he has focused more on the process of opening, with his wife, Kristina, their center city restaurant JAMES.

Mawr and passed Savona. He was curious and entered the restaurant with his
resume. The discipline in the kitchen and the appointments in the dining room
impressed him. After meeting former chef Dominique Filoni, he was convinced that
Savona was where he wanted to begin his career. Since then, Mr. Masciangelo has
been promoted to Sous chef, Chef de Cuisine, and now is Executive Chef.

with strong classic Italian roots. He enjoys preparing seafood and specifically, his

wine.

 Kristin McGuigan 

Back Burner Executive Chef, Kristin McGuigan began her career at the early age of 15. She has had a passion for food for as far back as she can remember. Growing up in a“food oriented”home, she remembers being mesmerized while helping her mother, aunts, and Babci (grandmother) on holidays in the kitchen.

Kristin attended Delcastle Technical High School where she studied culinary arts and began learning the fundamentals of her craft. As a sophomore she began working for Executive Chef Tom Hannum at the prestigious Hotel DuPont. It was then that she discovered her passion for food.“He taught me to respect the food and the craft,”McGuigan said. After graduating at the top of her culinary class McGuigan attended Johnson and Wales in Rhode Island. While attending college she was able to refine her food skills and also learn the inner workings of the restaurant business.

After attending Johnson and Wales, Kristin, still employed by the Hotel DuPont, decided to take a leap of faith and test her luck in the front of the house. Kristin felt in order to be a well rounded chef you needed to become knowledgeable in all aspects of the business, not just the food. McGuigan took the next four years and learned all front of the house operations; from event planning, to server and bartender and finally to management. Though she loved all departments McGuigan felt her true passion was in the kitchen. Her love for food, the combining of flavors and the flare for delivery made her heart race. She has since worked for Nonna in Newark, 1717 in Wilmington and Dome in Hockessin.

Now, as Executive Chef and General Manager at The Back Burner, McGuigan is redefining the food as well as the dining experience. Her knowledge and experience have developed winning combinations of flavors. For example, the sushi grade Ahi tuna paired with Peruvian white sweet potato puree and rainbow chard finished with a huckleberry gastrique, leaves a lasting impression on your palate.

Across the menu Chef McGuigan demonstrates a deeply rooted commitment to quality, freshness, and strong culinary practices. Each dish is handcrafted with the freshest local (when available) ingredients; from local seasonal produce to free range meats and ocean friendly seafood.

Chef McGuigan and her longtime boyfriend, Brandon Fox, live in Wilmington with their two cats, Chloe and Eddie. In her free time she enjoys spending time with her family and friends.

 Robert Parker 

A graduate of the Restaurant School of Philadelphia, Chef Robert Parker was
inspired by his father at an early age when his father told his three sons that your
mother is neither your maid nor your chef, and she will not be here to clean and
cook for you the rest of your life. So you will learn how to cook, wash dishes, and
do laundry for yourselves.”This was at the tender age of 9 years old.

Culinary study at the Restaurant School and a tour of France as part of the curriculum
allowed Chef Parker to gain incredible experience. The rigors of the program gave
him a foundation for high expectations. He then had an opportunity to do a small
apprenticeship at Striped Bass and Le Bec Fin (both superior Philadelphia
restaurants) where the classical techniques he learned were put to use. From there,
Chef Parker worked in a variety of culinary-related capacities including catering,
restaurants, and hotels before landing a premier opportunity at the Hotel du Pont and
the Du Pont Country Club where he worked for 14 years. Before leaving Du Pont
Hospitality, he climbed the ranks as Sous Chef where he was in charge of Banquets,
Member Dining and the Brantwyn Mansion. Chef Parker left Du Pont Hospitality in

thoroughly enjoys teaching 11th and 12th graders the fine art of culinary creation
which he has mastered.

 Angela Salvucci 

Angela Salvucci shares her passion for delicious, fresh and healthy food as a raw and living food private chef and instructor. Formerly a financial journalist, she has been creating amazingly good-for-you – and surprisingly delicious – food, and blogging about her adventures at www.rawappetit.com, for about two years. As a recreational marathon runner and total foodie, Angela became interested in nutrition as part of her training, and turned to a raw, plant-based way of eating after some research, and lots of experimentation. In raw cuisine, fresh veggies, fruit, nuts and seeds are prepared below 112 degrees to keep the enzymes and nutrients in the food intact, which delivers maximum digestibility and nutrition to your body while preserving all the flavors nature intended. This unique way of eating can be shockingly indulgent and incredibly good for you at the same time, is naturally gluten-free, as well as free of other allergens like dairy, eggs and shellfish. It’s pretty close to guilt-free, as well!

Angela completed a raw and living food teacher training program with author and restaurateur Alissa Cohen in 2009. Angela lives in Wilmington does raw food “un-cooking” demos and meals in clients’ homes in addition to hosting dinners and demos at Fresh Thymes Café in Wilmington, and now at Celebrity Kitchens.

the sense of urgency. Pastry demands her time and the learning of techniques.
To quote her,“it is precise and there is a creativity in this that I did not find behind
the line.”This truly shows in her work at georges. Her dream as she puts it is“to
own an orchard one day with 12 chickens and 12 cows, make ice cream and eat it”.
She embraces the seasonality of fruit, the texture and the taste explosion that a
fresh ripe strawberry can bring. She incorporates her passion into her work as

and spent six years under the watchful eyes of Lacroix and Chef Martin Hamann,
honing his skills and learning from these highly revered chefs. In that time, Wentz
moved up along the four-star restaurants line, eventually spending two years as a
Saucier.

When Lacroix sought to open his signature restaurant, Lacroix at the Rittenhouse,
Chef Wentz was brought on board in position of Executive Sous Chef. With Wentz
manning a critical role, Lacroix at the Rittenhouse was named Esquire Magazines
Best New Restaurant of 2003. During his tenure at the Rittenhouse Hotel, Wentz
swiftly developed skill in running a five-diamond hotel kitchen, business
management, and creating superior cuisine.

In April 2005, the opportunity to join Twenty21 as Executive Chef proved a natural
progression in Wentzs career and an opportunity for Twenty21 to further distinguish
itself with new energy and bold culinary direction. Today, at Twenty21, Chef Wentz
offers diners an experience thats rooted in French culinary tradition, with the added
benefit of American ingenuity and creativity. From his early days tending to herbs
and tomato plants in a New Jersey vegetable garden, to a world-class Executive
Chef, Wentz offers an opportunity to experience his tireless pursuit of excellence at
todays Twenty21.
