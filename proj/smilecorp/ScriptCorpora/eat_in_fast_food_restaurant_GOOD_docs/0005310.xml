Salesman pleads guilty to 2005 slaying of elderly Lafayette woman
Door-to-Door Sales Company: Overachievers

 Salesman pleads guilty to 2005 slaying of elderly Lafayette woman

Updated: 12/31/2008 06:33:50 AM PST
 MARTINEZ A Missouri man pleaded guilty Tuesday to sexual assault and murder in the 
 death of a 90-year-old Lafayette woman he met while selling magazines door-to-door.
 Ann Elizabeth Vuori&apos;s body was found bound to a bed inside her Moraga Boulevard home Dec. 10, 2005. 
 A month later, a national database linked DNA recovered from the home to Richard Craig McNew, 
 who was in a St. Louis jail on an unrelated robbery warrant.
 McNew was facing the death penalty at a trial scheduled to start next month. He now faces 
 life without the possibility of parole at a sentence hearing set for Feb. 13.
 Prosecutors said that McNew was a traveling magazine salesman for the Overachievers 
 company when he came across the retired accountant. Vuori was smothered and sexually assaulted. 
 Savings bonds and other property were stolen from her ransacked home.
 At McNew&apos;s preliminary hearing in 2007, a detective testified that McNew argued that Vuori 
 invited into her home to fix a water heater. He told police that he stole Vuori&apos;s credit card 
 but that he did not assault her.
 In a Martinez courtroom Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to murder, robbery, burglary, 
 forced sexual penetration and special allegations that had made him a candidate for 
 capital punishment. A rape charge and related special allegation were dismissed as 
 part of the plea agreement with the District Attorney&apos;s Office, said Deputy Public 
 Defender Terri Mockler.?
 &quot;The best we could have hoped for by going to trial was life without the possibility 
 of parole and there was a chance he could have gotten death,&quot; Mockler said. 
 The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Paul Graves,? could not be reached for comment.
 The Vuori murder prompted the Lafayette City Council to consider refusing to issue 
 solicitor licenses to individuals with criminal records. The proposed ordinance is 
 scheduled for council consideration in January.

 Warning issued for another door-to-door scam
KRNV News 4
Posted: Dec 30, 2008 03:48 PM CST
Updated: Dec 30, 2008 04:03 PM CST
 Attorney General&apos;s office has issued a warning regarding a door-to-door scam involving the 
 selling of magazines that has some victims wondering, when do I get my order?
 A senior deputy reports, they&apos;ve received complaints about college-aged people, going 
 door-to-door, selling magazines, claiming to be taking part in a fundraiser.
 The magazines are reportedly sold for double or even triple the price and the magazines 
 are never sent to the home.
 The office says they were able to make some arrests from cases in Reno adding that the scam 
 involved a group of people from Florida.
 &quot;They don&apos;t have any money and if the driver of the van doesn&apos;t like what they&apos;re doing, 
 they can just leave them on the street, so it&apos;s a problem all the way around,&quot; 
 Senior Deputy Attorney General John McGlamery says. &quot;We simply don&apos;t want to 
 encourage this conduct by buying magazines from them.&quot;
The Attorney General Bureau of Consumer Protection:
First, if suspicious, ask to see a license or school ID and make sure it matches the paperwork.
 Secondly, if things don&apos;t add up, ask for their information, and relay that to authorities.
 And lastly, if things simply don&apos;t seem right, just say no.

4 Amway Youths Killed in Indiana Crash

 Janesville, Wisconsin Traveling Sales Crew Tragedy
Recalled as Amway Youths are Killed in Indiana Crash
Posted by quixtarisacult at 3:48 PM
Monday, December 29, 2008
 Readers of this blog may recall that I have associated the Dark Side of Traveling Sales Crews with the 
 Quixtar/Amway nightmare in several past posts. I have honored the victims of the Janesville, 
 Wisconsin crash prominently on this blog for some time now. Victims of the Janesville crash 
 were members of a traveling sales crew. Little enough has been said about the many hours of 
 potentially life threatening travel that &apos;core&apos; Amway cult believers must realistically log 
 in pursuit of Amway fool&apos;s gold. These folks are every bit as victimized by the pernicious 
 Amway cult as the victims of the traveling sales crews tragedy. Two somewhat different groups 
 basically who were in pursuit of a scheme which only served to enrich others; both groups 
 victimized by those with whom they believe they are in business with. Tragically, four youthful 
 Amway cult initiates were killed in an unfortunate auto/truck accident on the Indiana turnpike 
 which really didn&apos;t have to happen. Click here to read the story.

Sadly, we must add the names of new victims in like manner to the victims of the Janesville crash. 
 Amway youths, another roadside memorial to a tragedy that did not have to happen on a dangerous 
 road that would have better been left untraveled.

Kyle Sporleder, 20, of Sylvania, Ohio
 Aaron F. Esposito, 23, of Novi, Mich
 Lauren Diefenthaler, 19, of Ypsilanti, Mich
 Rodney M. Echelbarger, age unknown, of Holland, Ohio

Amway Global promotes a pernicious World cult. They misrepresent their cult business as a success, an 
 incredible reality inverting myth, which makes those who promote it guilty of intent to defraud. 
 The use of outright lies and deceptions and mind numbing cult propaganda intent to deceive youthful 
 adherents into the scheme. The costs can be very high in their pay to play &apos;closed market swindle&apos; 
 and in the case of these Indiana victims, the price they paid was their lives. If there was no 
 closed market swindle, these deaths most likely would have been avoided. Accidents do indeed occur, 
 but this was one that could have been completely avoided!

 Business partners die in crash
Father: Four killed had been to conference.
By ERIN BLASKO Tribune Staff Writer

Article published Dec 23, 2008
 As Andy Sporleder waited Monday for the arrival of his son&apos;s body, he described the atmosphere as calm.
 &quot;You know, we&apos;re doing pretty good, really,&quot; he said from his home in Sylvania, Ohio, 
 where friends and family members had gathered. &quot;We are aware of the fact that he isn&apos;t 
 coming back.&quot;
 Kyle Sporleder, 20, of Sylvania, was one of four people killed Sunday in a crash on the 
 Indiana Toll Road near New Carlisle, Indiana State Police revealed Monday. The other 
 three victims have been identified as Aaron F. Esposito, 23, of Novi, Mich.; Lauren Diefenthaler, 
 19, of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and Rodney M. Echelbarger, age unknown, of Holland, Ohio.
 According to police, about 8:05 p.m., the four were eastbound about 10 miles west of South 
 Bend when their car slid across the median and into the path of a westbound semi-truck.
 The road was reportedly covered with snow and ice.
 Three of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, police said, and the fourth 
 died later at an area hospital. The driver of the truck, Duane Rigdon, of Carlsbad, Okla., 
 was not injured.
 According to Andy Sporleder, Kyle and the other three victims worked for Amway Global. He said 
 they had attended a conference in West Lafayette, Ind., on Saturday and were returning Sunday 
 when the accident occurred.
 &quot;They were all business partners,&quot; he said. &quot;They were in this business together.&quot;
 Kyle Sporleder and Echelbarger were also both lance corporals in the Marine Corps Reserves, 
 according to Capt. Nathan J. Braden, with Marine Forces Reserve Public Affairs. Both were inactive.
 Andy Sporleder said his son knew Diefenthaler and Esposito as colleagues, and met Echelbarger 
 in the Marines.
 He said his son joined the Marines out of high school.
 &quot;It was just something he wanted to do,&quot; Andy Sporleder said. &quot;He wanted to make a difference.&quot;
 Sporleder said his son left for West Lafayette sometime Friday or early Saturday. 
 He said he hadn&apos;t spoken to him at all over the weekend.
 &quot;He was a go-getter,&quot; he said. &quot;He had a plan with this business of his. He knew where he 
 was going and what he wanted to do. He had a fire in him that you just couldn&apos;t put out.&quot;
 Of the accident, he said, &quot;He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, I guess.&quot;

Life goes on for grandma after abduction and beating

 Life goes on for grandma after abduction and beating
I have to stay positive says 75-year-old left bound in car trunk for 26 hours
By Mike Celizic
TODAYShow.com contributor
MSNBC
updated 8:26 a.m. CT, Tues., Dec. 16, 2008
 The 75-year-old grandmother was strangled, punched, kicked, bound in duct tape and thrown in 
 the trunk of her own car by three young adults. After 26 hours without food or water, Sandy 
 Vinge made a silent plea to God: Either save me, or let me die.

I told God that, Vinge, her face still swollen and marked by ugly purple bruises, recalled to 
 TODAYs Matt Lauer. Then I asked my late husband, who had just died I said, Don, tell God [to] 
 help me. And he did. That night he helped me. The sheriffs came and they rescued me, because I 
 wouldnt have lasted long.

Vinge had spent several days in a San Diego hospital, so badly beaten that she couldnt even 
 speak at first. But by Monday, the spirited woman who loves to dance was feeling well enough 
 to get her hair done, put on a nice dress, and talk to Lauer from her La Mesa, Calif., home with 
 her son, Daniel Allen, at her side.

 Trust betrayed 
I have bruises on my body because they kicked me and hit me and everything, she told Lauer in 
 an interview that was recorded on Monday and aired Tuesday.

Vinges ordeal had begun a week earlier on Monday, Dec. 8, when she bought a vacuum 
 cleaner from a door-to-door salesman identified as Jeffrey Edward Nelson, 19. 
 That night, she said, he returned to her home and asked to use the phone.

He said his girlfriend had kicked him [out] and could he use my phone to call his mother, 
 Vinge told Lauer. An open woman who likes to help anyone she can, she let him in.

I said, Yes, you can, so I showed him where the phone was, Vinge said. As I turned to walk 
 away, thats when he choked me from behind.

Vinge lost consciousness, and when she woke up, she was in the trunk area of her Dodge 
 Magnum station wagon, bound with duct tape so she couldnt move. They stole me in my own car, 
 she said. That was awful.

Two others were in the car with Nelson, she said: another young man identified by police 
 as Luis Lomeli Osborne, 18, and a young woman identified as Antoinette Marie Baker, 18.

 26-hour ordeal 
For the next 26 hours, police say, the three abductors drove around in Vinges car, using her 
 credit cards to buy gas and other items. They never offered anything to Vinge, and when 
 she asked for something to drink because she was desperately thirsty, one of the men 
 smashed her in the face with his fist.

I was so taped and bound I couldnt even move to protect myself, Vinge told Lauer. 
 He was driving crazy and I was bouncing all over the place.

Finally, on Tuesday night, a police officer saw the car committing a traffic violation, 
 gave chase, and stopped the car. The officer found Vinge in the back. When the duct 
 tape was removed, it took her skin with it in some places.

Nelson, Osborne and Baker were arrested and charged with a number of crimes, including 
 kidnapping and assault. They were arraigned on Friday and are being held on $2 million 
 bail each. The three pleaded not guilty.

An in-court television camera zoomed in on Nelson, a muscular young man with buzz-cut hair, 
 and showed him rolling his eyes as the charges against him were read.

This is the most egregious, baffling set of circumstances that Ive ever come across, 
 Deputy District Attorney Paul Greenwood told reporters.

Its hard to believe someone would do that, Daniel Allen told Lauer. For what, 
 some credit card charges, a few bucks and a bottle of booze? It just doesnt make any sense.

 Life goes on 
Vinge has three children, including Allen, and two grandchildren. 
 Allen is staying with her as she recovers. He told Lauer its not 
 easy to control his anger at what happened to a woman as sweet and beloved as his mother.

Im holding it together because my job right now is to take care of my mom, Allen said. 
 I didnt go to the court, because I didnt want to be the guy climbing over the fence trying to 
 get to the guy, especially with their attitude being it was no big deal.

Its hard for him to look at his mothers bruised and battered face. But when she talks, 
 its my mom behind it all, he told Lauer. Its very comforting that shes the same sweet, 
 loving person that loves everybody and her home is open to everybody. Thats probably how 
 this all came about, that she became an easy target because shes an open door.

Although she cant understand why she was attacked, Vinge is determined to get back to 
 her active and busy life. Theres nothing I can do about what happened, she said. 
 I have to be positive, because life goes on.

Lauer asked Vinge if she would be letting any more strangers into her home.

No, I dont think so, she said with a big smile. Theres not that many people out 
 there like this. Ill probably be afraid even now, when the doorbell rings, I get a 
 little scared even [though] I have my big old boy with me. I dont think Ill do that again, Matt.

Lauer wished Vinge a happy holiday and told her to take care of herself.

She smiled and offered Lauer some grandmotherly advice of her own: You take care of you, 
 too, Matt. Dont you let strangers in.

 Authorities said a man accused of burglarizing a Camarillo home this week had a novel 
 explanation for his actions: He was selling magazines.
 Kenwaun Drummer, 20, of Chicago was arrested Wednesday afternoon on suspicion of burglary 
 after he entered a home in the 200 block of Camino Leon through an open bedroom window, 
 sheriff&apos;s Detective Eric Buschow said today.
 After he entered the home, Drummer was confronted by a 16-year-old girl who lives there, 
 Buschow said. She told police that when she demanded to know what he was doing there, 
 he asked if she wanted to buy a magazine, then fled the residence, Buschow said.
 Sheriff&apos;s deputies arrested Drummer nearby after the girl called 911, the detective said. 
 Drummer later told authorities he worked for a Chicago-based magazine company.
 He was being held Friday in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. From staff reports

Police rescue kidnap victim, 75, after two-day ordeal

 Police rescue kidnap victim, 75, after two-day ordeal

 EL CAJON A 75-year-old woman was freed from a harrowing ordeal Wednesday morning after being 
 kidnapped from her La Mesa home and found gagged with tape and tied up in the back of her station wagon, 
 according to sheriff&apos;s detectives. 
 The woman was severely beaten and had her wrists, hands and mouth bound with duct tape, said sheriff&apos;s Sgt. 
 Mark Varnau. The kidnappers had kept her in a Dodge Magnum with no food or water since Monday night, 
 Varnau said. She was in fear for her life the entire two days, said the sergeant, who supervises the department&apos;s elder-abuse unit. 
 Luis Osborne and Antoinette Baker, both 18 and from El Cajon, were arrested with Jeffrey Nelson, 19, of 
 Lakeside, said Lt. Dennis Brugos. 
 Sheriff&apos;s deputies tried to pull over the speeding car in Lakeside about 12:20 a.m. Wednesday, 
 Varnau said. The driver sped off and ran a red light, and a short pursuit ended when the car pulled 
 over near Tangerine Street and Bluebell Way, Varnau said. 
 A man and a woman who were passengers ran away; the driver got out and followed commands to 
 get on the ground, but he ended up getting away. 
 El Cajon police officers arrived, opened the back hatch of the car and found the woman inside. 
 Her face was severely swollen from being beaten, Varnau said. She had two black eyes. 
 She told deputies that two weeks ago she had the carpets cleaned at her Resmar Place home and 
 was given a discount for a vacuum cleaner. 
 Next, the manager and a salesman who said they were from the vacuum cleaner company sold her a 
 vacuum for more than $2,000, the sergeant said. 
 The salesman later turned out to be one of the men involved in the kidnapping, Varnau said. 
 At 9:30 a.m. Monday, the salesman returned to the woman&apos;s home, where she was having coffee 
 with a friend, and said he wanted to thank her for the purchase, Varnau said. 
 That man returned to the house about 10 p.m. Monday. He said he had just broken up with his 
 girlfriend and asked to use her phone. She let him in and he put his arm around her neck 
 and choked her until she was unconscious, the sergeant said. 
 The man then tied the woman up with duct tape and went through the house looking for things to steal, 
 Varnau said. He then dragged her to the car and put her in the back, covered the car and left her there, 
 the sergeant said. 
 The woman told deputies the car was driven to a gas station where she was able to scream for 
 help because she had chewed through the duct tape. 
 No one heard her. 
 One of the men and the woman proceeded to beat and punch her in the face several times, Varnau said. 
 The woman was taken to the hospital Wednesday, where she was able to give deputies a 
 detailed account of her ordeal. 
 Detective Steve Litwin visited the woman in the hospital and said she was in good spirits. 
 I couldn&apos;t believe how happy she was, how composed, he said. 
 He could not detail her injuries but said she is expected to make a full recovery. 
 She&apos;s a very strong 75-year-old, Varnau said. She&apos;s a survivor. 
 The sergeant said the woman&apos;s credit cards were stolen and they are checking financial records 
 to see if they were used and will search the men&apos;s homes for stolen property. 
 Deputies are trying to determine a motive for the crime. They note that a shovel was found in the car. 
 She may have been on the way to her death, Brugos said.

Cardiff cold shoulders commission-based companies
Door-to-Door Sales Company:
Southwestern Company
 December 6, 2008 
 Cardiff cold shoulders commission-based companies
by Cristofer Lloyd
Gair Rhydd
Issue 885
December 6, 2008
 Businesses advertising commission-only jobs on campus at Cardiff University will no 
 longer be supported by the Careers Service, a University spokesperson said.
 Enterprises like The Southwestern Company that recruit Cardiff students may be restricted 
 by new rules aimed at preventing external bodies from advertising any work opportunities 
 paid solely by commission.
 Concerns have been raised at universities including Cardiff University over the recruitment 
 tactics of companies who sign up students for direct sales work in Britain and America.
 Megan Robson, who signed up to work with Southwestern last year, complained to Cardiff 
 University after claiming that she felt pressured into paying $750 in fees.
 Southwestern said that this pays for the time-consuming visa application process, necessary to 
 work legally in America.
 However, Megan said that the companys advertising was misleading and that the Sales School 
 training is cult-like, with intense, long hours.
 Megan complained that her pay was not sufficient at $6/hr and that she had to travel home 
 late and live in substandard accommodation.
 After experiencing these problems Southwestern offered her another job, which she rejected, 
 describing the whole experience as really frustrating.
 Southwestern Vice President, Dave Causer, said: I am not sure a person who did not complete 
 the training week would be the best judge of how it works.
 He added: [Megan] has been trying to blame Southwestern for problems she had with that employer, 
 even though they are a completely different company and have nothing to do with Southwestern.
 I can only assure you that we do everything possible to prepare them properly. It is our goal 
 to help all of the students have a successful summer.
 Amy Davies, who also worked with the company, said: Its really brainwashing. They try to 
 make you feel included, but its quite false.
 However, other students have described positive experiences with Southwestern.
 Alistair McAloon, a student at Cardiff University, said:: The Sales School was great, motivating 
 and empowering. It really prepares you for the summer.
 A University spokesperson said that the University takes complaints very seriously and that 
 grievances against Southwestern are under active consideration. by Cristofer Lloyd

Magazine Salesman Arrested

 Police collar area burglary suspect
By J.B. Wogan
Sammamish Review
December 3, 2008
 Edmonds police have arrested a Pittsburgh, Penn. man, 19, who they say burglarized a home in 
 Sammamish and elsewhere in the state. Several residents have reported encounters with the man, 
 who identified himself as a door-to-door magazine salesman. In the Edmonds case, he was 
 charged with burglary and robbery. 
 Detective Bill Albright, of the Sammamish Police Department, filed his case with the King 
 County Prosecuting Attorneys Office in early November. 
 Police say the suspect committed three recent burglaries, including the October 
 incident in Sammamish. The other two were in Tumwater in September and Edmonds in October. 
 In the Sammamish case, the homeowner came home to find that the second floor 
 window screen had been pried off and the window which was previously left slightly ajar 
 was now wide open. 
 The suspect then allegedly stole $1,708 worth of items, including a $300 prototype of a 
 new Microsoft Zune, a $700 diamond ring and a $500 pearl necklace.
 The Xbox, the notebook computers, theyre all there, Albright said. Only small items 
 that can fit in a suspects pockets are stolen in these cases, he explained.
 There is still a chance that other potential burglars, under the pretense of being door-to-
 door salesmen, are roaming Sammamish, Albright warned. 
 Stan Bump, a resident due east of City Hall, said a stranger came to his door one morning in 
 October, claiming to be a recovered felon who was using the sales job to change his ways. 
 Deep down inside, you really want these guys to reform, said Colleen Patterson, one of 
 Bumps neighbors. She and her husband Mike live on Southeast 8th Street and they, too, 
 encountered the magazine salesman with a criminal past. 
 Patterson said she believes her neighborhood and ones like it are targeted because the 
 houses are far apart and residents are less likely to notice suspicious activity on 
 their neighbors property. 
 There is no evidence that connects the arrested suspect with the encounters experienced 
 by Bump and his neighbors, according to police. The events are related only in that 
 they speak to the phenomenon of door-to-door salesmen dropping into Sammamish in the fall. 
 In the case of the arrested suspect, a job training company hired him to sell 
 magazines, Albright said. 
 The type of people that they procure for employment might have less than desirable backgrounds, 
 he said. Not all of them are bad. Many of them are legitimate door-to-door magazine businesses.
 The modus operandi of these businesses is that they hire employees who are in trouble financially, 
 bus the employees to a specific location, offer them free room and board at a motel, 
 and train them in aggressive advertising tactics, according to Albright.
 Sometimes the crime isnt outright burglary, but some sort of forgery, he said.
 Albright said he knows of two cases in King County where a salesman altered the 
 amount on a check from $41 to $4,041. Another classic tactic is to pull a check 
 from the middle of a victims checkbook, which will not be obvious to the victim until 
 far later, he said.
 Door-to-door salesmen are required to register as a peddler beforehand with the city, 
 according to City Clerk Melonie Anderson. If they do so, they will have proof of 
 their registration on-hand to demonstrate they are legally selling subscriptions. 
 The suspect in the Sammamish case did not register with the city, according to Albright. 
 Patterson said people have shown up at her home for the last three years with stories of a 
 criminal past and an eye toward reform through door-to-door sales. Each time, 
 the door knocking takes place in late fall, she said. 
 Patterson and her husband have started using their home alarm system more, she said. 
 A handful of residents have set up a telephone network and agreed to call each other 
 if they notice a suspicious person door knocking in the area, according to Bump. 
 Residents should also call the police about suspicious circumstances involving door-to-door 
 salesman, Albright said.

 We need to know whats going on. If you dont tell us, we dont know, Albright said.

Deep down inside, you really want these guys to reform.

Sammamish resident

 The Horror That Is Travelling Magazine Sales
I Speak of Dreams
Posted by: ms_teacher | Sunday, November 30, 2008 at 12:21 PM
 Last night I was sitting on my porch, enjoying the balmy November evening, when a weary young man 
 trudged up my driveway. I&apos;d had encounters with these young people before -- the spiel is they are 
 &quot;turning their lives around&quot; and &quot;learning skills&quot; by selling magazines. 
 I know a little about the business, and I refuse to buy from them. 
 Something about the young man&apos;s weariness moved me, though.

I invited the young man to sit a spell on the porch, and went inside to get a few dollars 
 and a glass of water. We talked for a while. The young man was from Illinois and had 
 seen a poster advertising the magazine crew opportunity, promising income of up to 
 $300.00/week and an opportunity to travel the country. It sounded pretty good to a 
 poor kid. But he said the life was hard and if he didn&apos;t make his sales quota, 
 &quot;bad things&quot; happened. I was working up to asking him if he wanted out of 
 the business when the police stopped by. By the end of the discussion, 
 there were six officers and three patrol cars. I have to say, the lead officer 
 had a highly aggressive interview technique with both the young man and me.

The police deal with the problem by addressing the individuals going door-to-door, because usually 
 they do not have the proper licenses. The young man mentioned they were based in a hotel 
 the next county over, so there was a limit on what the officers could do. But I wish there 
 was some way to put the magazine crews out of business for good. The magazine industry can 
 and should do more, as Craig Malisow points out in the Houston Press investigative report.

On any given day, an estimated 50,000 young people are traversing the country, many of them 
 working under substandard and dangerous conditions. Their lack of life experience
 makes it difficult for many of them to look after their own best interests.

In 2001, Sen. Herb Kohl (Wisc) introduced federal legislation to regulate the traveling sales 
 crew industry. National Field Selling Association (NFSA), the industry association, 
 successfully lobbied to have the bill quashed.

Comments

One of the only times I have ever felt scared in my own home was at the hands of a traveling 
 magazine salesman. At the time, I was a SAHM and my kids were very young. When the doorbell 
 rang, I opened up the door and was greeted quite affably by this salesman, 
 a big burly guy with what seemed to be a very ready smile.

After he went through his spiel, I told him that I couldn&apos;t afford to buy anything. That&apos;s 
 when it turned ugly. He started berating me for letting me go through his sales pitch 
 and not stopping him. Then a series of f*****g b***h and actual threats to me started 
 spewing. As I closed the door, I told him that I was calling the police.

Then, he started kicking my door and continued to yell more obscenities. When I called 
 911 and confirmed my address, I was told that the police were already on their way 
 because apparently this guy had done the same thing at a couple of other houses!

His transportation must have been nearby because when the police came by, they were 
 not able to apprehend him. For a long time afterwards, I was pretty shook up.

 Door-to-door magazine salesman
attacks Clay County customer who
refused to purchase a subscription

JACKSONVILLE.COM
 A door-to-door magazine salesman was arrested Thursday after authorities said he forced 
 his way into an 18-year-old Clay County womans home, stole her purse and punched her in the face.
 Brandon C. Sheriff, 21, of Owensboro, Ky., was charged with home-invasion robbery. 
 The victim was approached by a man about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday who asked to use her phone 
 to call his boss. When the victim declined to buy any subscriptions, he shoved her to the 
 ground and took her purse from inside her Orange Park home, according to a Sheriffs Office report.
 She tried to pull the purse out of his grasp, but the salesman punched her in the face and ran off.
 Lone Star Subscriptions, the suspects employer, has an unsatisfactory rating from the Texas 
 Better Business with about 300 complaints. Mary Justino of the Clay County Sheriffs 
 Office said there is no state permit for door-to-door soliciting in Clay or Duval counties 
 on file for Lone Star Subscriptions, so the company is likely a scam operation.
 The Sheriffs Office couldnt say what magazine subscriptions the suspect was selling.

 DSA - Not what it appears to be
ARE ALL INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS GOOD FOR DISTRIBUTORS?
by Dr. Keith B. Laggos
Sunday, November 9, 2008

 DSA - Not what it appears to be
ARE ALL INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS GOOD FOR DISTRIBUTORS?
You would think they should be. After all, isnt the direct sales and network marketing industry 
 built on the backs of distributors? If you continue to read this Publishers Perspective 
 you may have a rude awakening. Why? All industry associations are not built the same. They 
 were created by different segments of the industry with different interests.
 There are four main associations that serve the direct sales and network marketing industry. They are: 
 Distributor Rights Association (DRA); Direct Selling Association (DSA); Direct Selling Womens Alliance 
 (DSWA); and the Multi-Level Marketing International Association (MLMIA). I will discuss them in the 
 order that theyre listed in above alphabetical.
 DSA is oldest but is it best?
 The DSA is the oldest and best-financed association. Although with less than 10 percent of the 
 industry companies as the only voting members, it has the fewest voting members. It was founded in 1910. 
 About 15 years ago, it almost went bankrupt. Amway, and a few other large companies, helped save the DSA. 
 Dues Start at $1,500 for new companies and quickly rise based on net sales for the previous year to as 
 much as $250,000. Supplier companies pay a rate of $2,500. By the time the large companies pay fees 
 for various committees, the DSEF, sponsorships and donations, they can easily spend more than a 
 million dollars a year with the DSA.
 The DSA is a private, non-profit corporation. What does that mean? When I asked Joe Mariano, the 
 DSAs executive vice president, who owns the DSA, he said, Member companies own the DSA. I asked, 
 Do all member companies own the DSA equally or are they prorated in amount of dues? He replied, 
 as you can expect a lawyer would, All the companies that own the DSA are member companies. So 
 who own the DSA? Do your own research. Dont be surprised to find the same large companies 
 heading the important committees year after year are the same ones that contribute the majority 
 of the total funds and receive most of the awards.
 Only direct sales companies can be voting members of the DSA. Its members include about a dozen 
 large direct sales and network marketing companies that virtually control it and a couple of 
 dozen mid-sized companies. The balance of the DSA voting membership consists of mainly small 
 party plan companies. The DSA also accepts dues from vendors, who have no votes or virtually 
 no say, but distributors cannot be members at all. Whos interest do you think the DSA has 
 in mind? Vendors? Distributors? Anyone but the few large controlling companies? Do you 
 think the DSA even represents the interest of the small corporate members or are these 
 small corporate members just being used to give the DSA and large corporate members the 
 appearance of legitimately representing the industry?
 Do you think the DSA cares at all about distributors other than as assets of companies? 
 Consider the following. I have never heard the DSA consider one distributor issue out of 
 concern for distributors. Any policy that seems to protect the distributors has been a 
 result of trying to protect the companies, usually from over regulation. When the NSA 
 company came under fire for front-end loading, the DSA implemented a 90-day buy-back rule. 
 It may help protect distributors now, but if it was not for the threat of corporate regulation, 
 do you think that the DSA would have implemented the 90-day buy-back rule?
 Consider what the DSA has done over the years. It has held training sessions teaching 
 companies how to write policies so that distributors do not have any rights. These 
 include clauses that give companies the right to terminate distributors without cause 
 and to define the distributors entire business to be the sole property of the company. 
 It has advised companies to control the ability of distributors to sell their businesses 
 or forbid passing their businesses to their heirs. At an annual conference, in a speech by 
 Neil Offen, the DSAs president, he talked of the need to stop distributor associations. 
 He said it may become necessary for the DSA to start its own distributor association so 
 that it can continue to control the distributors. NMBJ and MMM have reported on these 
 events in past issues.
 Recently a top DSA executive was named as an expert witness to defend a company who, 
 without a written policy on the issue, had taken a distributors business away. This 
 distributor had been numerously recognized for her high performance and support of her 
 downline. The company also allowed cross-sponsoring and downline raids of cross downlines. 
 Is the DSA defending these actions because, under the DSAs apparent policies, a company can do 
 whatever it wants with a distributors business, since the DSA believes the company owns it?
 Why would any distributor want to be a member of a company that belongs to the DSA? 
 If your company does, what should you do? I cannot tell you to ask your company to resign or 
 petition them to resign. I cannot suggest that if the company remains a member, that you 
 should move your business to a non-member company. But ask yourself, why would your 
 company belong to an association that does not represent or seems to not even respect 
 distributors rights and not be members of the other three associations that protect 
 distributor rights? Why would you want to join a company that does not 
 support distributor rights?

Thank goodness, Jewels by Park Lane is NOT a member of the DSA! Julia

Van Phillips testifies in court Thursday. He says he was with the suspects the day of the 
 murders

Two magazine salesmen accused of double murder asked a judge to dismiss charges Thursday 
 after presenting an alibi and arguing that another man has already confessed to the murders. 
 Travis Rowley and Michael Lee have been locked up since December charged with murdering an 
 elderly Korean couple. 
 Then came a bombshellan ex-con named Clifton Bloomfield admitted to the couple&apos;s murder along 
 with several others. 
 Still, the prosecution is not ready to drop the murder charges against the two. 
 Rowley and Lee claim they were nowhere near the murder scene Monday, Dec. 3, 2007. 
 In court Thursday, a man who drove the magazine salesmen around their route testified the 
 suspects were never out of his sight for more than two hours. 
 The defense said in the time Rowley and Lee were out of their driver&apos;s sight, they have receipts to 
 show they were selling magazines eight miles away from the murder scene.
 The man who confessed to the couple&apos;s murder was sentenced in October. Bloomfield is serving 
 195 years in prison for five total murders he committed between 2005 and 2008.
 Prosecutors say at least two of the murders may have gone unsolved had Bloomfield not confessed. By: Eyewitness News 4

Dexter upends Moulton

 Dexter upends Moulton

Updated: 11/5/2008 12:37:01 AM
 Democratic challenger Kristen Dexter knocked off two-term Republican incumbent Terry 

 Moulton in a tightly fought, see-saw battle for the 68th Assembly District seat that saw 

 several lead changes Tuesday night.

Dexter tallied 15,434 votes to Moulton&apos;s 15,159, narrowly winning an oftentimes bitter 

 campaign marked by unprecedented advertising by outside organizations for an 

 Assembly district race in this part of the state.

&quot;We&apos;ve been sweating it out for hours,&quot; Dexter said minutes after learning she&apos;d won. 

 &quot;This is very sweet.&quot;

The contest&apos;s outcome remained in doubt throughout the night as Moulton carried 

 Chippewa County by a 56 to 44 percent margin, tallying 4,955 votes to Dexter&apos;s 3,870.

There were several lead changes throughout the evening. Moulton led early in the night as 

 Chippewa County vote totals were reported more quickly than those in Eau Claire County.

Moulton grabbed an early lead in Eau Claire County as well, but Dexter&apos;s vote total surged 

 as more numbers were reported. Moulton then grabbed a late lead before Dexter won the 

 last two precincts.

Moulton was predicted to carry Chippewa County, where he makes his home and 

 operates Mouldy&apos;s Archery and Tackle, his fishing and hunting store. Likewise, Dexter, an 

 Altoona school board member from 2000-06, was expected to carry the vote in her home 

 town.

The contest between Dexter and Moulton was among the most-watched - and most 

 bitterly contested - among Wisconsin&apos;s Assembly races. Democrats viewed Moulton as 

 vulnerable to defeat and targeted him in an effort to win at least two Assembly seats to 

 even the Democrat-Republican Assembly membership at 49 apiece.

The contest attracted unprecedented spending by outside organizations for an Assembly 

 race in this region, resulting in a blitz of negative advertising portraying Dexter as a liberal 

 spender and Moulton as ineffective.

Dexter attributed her win to &quot;pure, hard work.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m elated. I&apos;m very grateful.

Her top priority: &quot;Working together to make the changes the people have said they&apos;re 

 waiting for.&quot;

 Hendersonville, Tenneessee
Magazine Sales Scam Alert !!!

 Scam Homeowners Should Avoid
NewsChannel5.com
Posted: Oct 30, 2008 09:41 PM CDT
 HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. - A new scam hitting neighborhoods in Middle Tennessee could fool 

 even the most suspicious homeowners.

 The scam is so believable because of who is knocking on doors.

 The Alexandra Place subdivision in Hendersonville has a tight-knit group of neighbors so 

 word spread fast Wednesday that possible scammers were walking the streets.

 &quot;They say they are from a local softball team local area and that they&apos;re raising 

 money to go to Hawaii, &quot;said Holly Socha, scam victim. &quot;I&apos;m not sure, 

 but they might be selling magazines or trying to.&quot;

 Neighbors said the girls walked up to the door and gave a legitimate nearby address. 

 But after they checked the girls&apos; story, the neighbors discovered that the children 

 didn&apos;t live where they said they did.

 &quot;This girl was so believable,&quot; said Franky Mize of Hendersonville. &quot;She was 14, 15 

 years old looking, she probably had to be over the age of 18. But I would have never 

 guessed that she wasn&apos;t part of the neighborhood.&quot;

 Neighbors also checked the magazine sales company United Family Circulation and found 

 it belonged to a Georgia firm with a long list of scam alerts associated with it.

 &quot;I saw the girl get in a van and got the tag number and called police,&quot; Socha said.

 It&apos;s common to see children roam the neighborhood selling items so residents are used to 

 having young solicitors. 

 Still Megan Stamper didn&apos;t think the story made sense.

 &quot;We know that the parents don&apos;t let the kids out that late,&quot; Stamper said. &quot;Also, I 

 was like softball season is over so it really didn&apos;t add up.&quot;

 It&apos;s hard to know how many people were approached and how many wrote checks.

 &quot;When the girl looks so young it&apos;s kind of believable,&quot; Socha said.

 People can stop payments on their checks, but children with legitimate fundraisers may have a 

 tougher time making sales in the neighborhood.

 Hendersonville police checked into it and warned people to be alert to professional 

 fraud artists. Anyone who sells door to door must have a solicitor&apos;s permit 

 issued from the city. newschannel5.com

 Exactly Who is Terry Moulton Working for?
Post from Cory Liebmann&apos;s Blog:

 http://www.onewisconsinnow.org 
 After repeated problems involving door-to-door sales crews in Wisconsin, legislation was 

 proposed in the state legislature that would regulate the practice. That legislation was 

 almost singlehandedly blocked by the Eau Claire state Rep. Terry Moulton who chaired 

 the committee responsible for taking up the measure. 

 Blocking such common sense legislation is bad enough, but doing so with questionable 

 motives makes the act much worse. The Associated Press confirmed this week that Rep. 

 Moulton received $1,000 in June from three executives of Southwestern Company, a 

 company that hires such door-to-door sales crews. The Tennessee based company was 

 the only one registered against the legislation. Moulton received the campaign cash after 

 he succeeded in blocking the measure in his committee. 

 Moulton claims that he worked my butt off on a compromise on the proposed legislation. 

 Unfortunately the bills original author added that Moulton certainly did work hard but it was 

 mostly for the executives at Southwestern not for the best interests of his constituents. Post from Cory Liebmann&apos;s Blog:

 Wis. father rips lawmaker on sales bill

October 28, 2008
 MADISON, Wis. (AP) A dead teenager&apos;s father and a liberal advocacy group have accused a 

 Wisconsin lawmaker of blocking a bill regulating door-to-door sales crews in exchange 

 for campaign contributions.

The accusations come a week before the Republican lawmaker, state Rep. Terry Moulton 

 of Eau Claire, faces re-election against Democratic challenger Kristen Dexter in 

 a race Democrats targeted. Moulton roundly denied the charges, questioning their timing.

Campaign finance reports show Moulton, chairman of the Assembly Small Business Committee, 

 recorded $1,000 in June from three executives of Southwestern Company, the only company 

 registered against the measure. The money came after Moulton&apos;s committee failed to vote 

 on the bill earlier this year. The measure passed the state Senate 28-5 in April 2007.

Moulton said the bill would have hurt small businesses.

A spokesman for Southwestern Company, a Nashville, Tenn.-based company that employs college 

 students as salesmen, had no immediate comment.

Asked why the company gave him the money, Moulton replied: &apos;&apos;Why does anyone 

 give a candidate money? They give money to people who have the judgment to 

 uphold the same kind of ideals and philosophy they do.&apos;&apos;

Phil Ellenbecker of Verona has pushed for tighter regulation of traveling sales 

 crews since his 18-year-old daughter, Malinda Turvey, and six other members of a traveling 

 sales crew died in a van crash near Janesville in 1999.

Ellenbecker and One Wisconsin Now, a liberal political group, have been researching 

 Moulton&apos;s campaign contributions for several weeks.

&apos;&apos;I&apos;m up in arms against Terry Moulton. I&apos;ll do anything in the world to make sure he doesn&apos;t 

 get re-elected,&apos;&apos; Ellenbecker said. &apos;&apos;He has ignored his responsibility as a representative.&apos;&apos;

Moulton said he &apos;&apos;worked my butt off&apos;&apos; on a compromise, but the bill&apos;s original author, 

 state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton, wouldn&apos;t have it.

Erpenbach said Moulton worked hard for Southwestern.

 Wisconsin 68th District Voters Beware 
Dedicated Memorial Parents Group
Posted: October 27, 2008
 It is a documented fact that Terry Moulton (Republican 68th Assembly District) has accepted 

 campaign contributions from the Southwestern Company. In return for their generosity 

 Terry Moulton fought against Malindas Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act or SB-80 

 authored by Wisconsin State Senator Jon Erpenbach.

In so doing Terry Moulton has sided with an out-of-state special interest group and has 

 blatantly ignored his primary responsibility as a Wisconsin State Representative.

Terry Moulton has chosen to protect the business interests of the Southwestern Company over the 

 safety and well being of Wisconsin kids and homeowners.

Terry Moulton should be stripped of the privilege and the right to represent Wisconsin citizens.

Because Terry Moulton likes the Southwestern Company so much maybe he should get a job with them 

 selling bibles door-to-door and stop pretending that he represents the 

 best interests of the 68th district.

2008 Southwestern Company Contributions to Representative Terry Moulton:

Henry Bedford, June 28, 2008, Franklin TN 37064: $250.00
Spencer Hays, June 28, 2008, Nashville TN 37230: $500.00

Overland Park Woman Reports Being Touched Inappropriately

POSTED: 5:40 pm CDT October 27, 2008
UPDATED: 7:03 pm CDT October 27, 2008
 OVERLAND PARK, Kan. -- When a deaf woman answered her door, she thought it was a Jehovah&apos;s 

 Witness, but instead, it was a man selling magazines, and she said he groped her.

 The woman lived near West 151st Street and Glenwood Avenue.

 &quot;He brushed her breasts, and she thought this was an accident, and then as they were 

 exchanging the book back and forth, he touched her again several times, 

 which could not have been an accident,&quot; said Officer Jim Weaver, of the 

 Overland Park Police Department.

 A neighbor also answered a knock on her door late Tuesday evening to a man selling magazines. 

 She was not touched inappropriately, she said, but she thought it was unusual that a 

 solicitor was knocking on doors after dark.

 &quot;It&apos;s so dark and rainy, and it was very strange, and what happened to the neighbor, 

 it&apos;s totally shocking,&quot; the neighbor said. &quot;I am very shocked, because I know she&apos;s 

 deaf, and when somebody just comes to somebody&apos;s door and tried to abuse somebody, it&apos;s horrible.&quot;

 Police stopped a van in the area filled with people from South Carolina who were 

 out soliciting that night, but the woman who reported being groped to police 

 wasn&apos;t able to identify any of them as a suspect.

 Overland Park residents can pick up free No Solicitors signs at the Overland Park

Cons of soliciting

 Cons of soliciting

The Dakota Student
Board of Student Publications and the University of North Dakota
Issue date: 10/28/08 Section: Opinion
 I have learned the hard way of the dangers of being friendly with solicitors. These people 

 are out to get something from you and honestly don&apos;t care about the tight college 

 budget you&apos;re scrapping by on. It really gets under my skin how they have the 

 nerve to take it upon themselves to push their crummy product down the throat 

 of an unsuspecting, na&apos;ve person.

Everyone in my apartment complex has to deal with magazine peddlers every few months.

In fact we have a phone tree set up to let others know when they&apos;re coming so everyone can 

 prepare themselves or refuse to open the door.

Now they&apos;re not as cunning as some of the creepy phone marketers but some day with the right 

 training, they just may be the one to scam you out of your life savings. Their techniques are 

 already shady for being so young. Some have claimed to be in high school while others never 

 mentioned their affiliations.

It&apos;s like a scene from A Clockwork Orange. The one when the protagonist Alex breaks into 

 an woman&apos;s place and answers her question of why he is there by stating &quot;To be perfectly 

 honest, madam, I&apos;m taking part in an international students&apos; contest to see who can 

 get the most points selling magazines,&quot; Illustrating the pushiness of magazine peddlers.

They are a few steps away from taking their next customer hostage in their own home. 

 To prove my point, one year I had a young man mumble at me about looking for someone. At that 

 point I had a roommate who liked to party.

So I look over and call for her all the while he managed to slide in the door and goes on a 

 spiel about his magazines. But oh no, it gets worst.

A year later one guy somehow managed to not only get past my threshold but makes 

 himself at home and begins looking through my mail on the coffee table to get 

 information for his for magazine form!

I don&apos;t care where you&apos;re from but it&apos;s NOT acceptable behavior.

Come on, there is a large red sign on my entrance door that states &quot;NO SOLICITING!&quot; In layman&apos;s terms, 

 don&apos;t come around here with selling magazines on your mind. The words &quot;no&quot; may have to be 

 repeated several times before they give up and prey on their next consumer victim.

These people have toed the line when it comes to selling their &quot;product&quot; but the whole 

 barging into someone&apos;s home is more than crossing the line.

If the item is good it will sell itself not the other way around. I&apos;ve known people 

 who have had these seedy salesmen go so far as to jump into their car. The said person 

 agreed to subscribe to their $90 magazine subscription in order to get them out.

A day later she canceled the check at her bank. I should have done the same thing but 

 ended up out a hundred bucks with no magazines.

This made me start to contemplate why this blatant sign of saying &quot;kiss off&quot; in front of buildings 

 do not make these people falter before they pound at your door. I have come up with the reason 

 behind my concern about pushy sellers is either one of two things.

One, it might just be a change from country life when saying no thank you does not come with a rebuttal.

Or two, the people are becoming too desperate or confident in their selling techniques. 

 Either way, I&apos;m not buying. I live by the phrase, when it comes to shopping; don&apos;t call on me, 

 I&apos;ll call on you. Deena Davis

 EDMONDS -- A door-to-door magazine salesman in a job training program was arrested Thursday

Door-to-Door Candy Sales
Attempted Assault
 October 21, 2008 
 Candy salesman exposed himself to grandmother
Attempted Assault
A woman just trying to be kind to a teen selling door-to-door became a victim

Tuesday, October 21, 2008 | 6:09 PM
 HOUSTON (KTRK) -- An elderly woman says doing a small act of kindness left her a victim. 

 She says a teenager selling candy door-to-door took advantage of her when she let him 

 inside for just a moment. 

 Only able to walk with a cane, this Houston grandmother needs help everywhere she goes. 

 But she was alone at home last Saturday when she survived an unforgettable ordeal. 

 &quot;This was the worst scare that I have ever had,&quot; the victim said. 

 The woman who wants to be known only as Maria says the trouble started a young man selling 

 candy knocked on her front door. 

 &quot;I said, &apos;No, I don&apos;t have no money and I don&apos;t want to buy any candy,&apos;&quot; she recalled. &quot;Then he said, 

 &apos;Can I use your restroom?&apos;&quot; 

 Thinking the teen reminded her of her own grandson, the 78-year-old woman let him inside. 

 But when he came out of the bathroom, Maria says the teen was exposing himself. 

 &quot;He said, &apos;Look, touch, touch me.&apos; And I said, &apos;I ain&apos;t gonna touch you,&apos;&quot; Maria explained. 

 From there, Maria says the teen followed her into her bedroom, touched and kissed her. 

 She said, &quot;I was kind of scared and nervous.&quot; 

 All in all, Maria thinks the teen spent about half an hour inside her home. She told the 

 boy her husband was on his way home, and after making a phone call, he left. 

 Maria&apos;s granddaughter redialed the number the teen called. She says she found out the teen 

 worked for a group that sells candy to give job to teens with trouble pasts. 

 Dan Parsons from the Better Business Bureau says most door-to-door candy sales groups are not reputable. 

 &quot;Don&apos;t give to those people, no matter how enticing the pitch is, and no matter what they&apos;re claiming,&quot; 

 he advised. &quot;Don&apos;t let them in your home.&quot; 

 The Better Business Bureau suggests checking with the office if you have questions about a 

 business with salesmen going door to door. 

 The woman reported the incident to police on Saturday. Houston police have now assigned an 

 investigator to the case. KTRK-TV Eyewitness TV

Dear readers,
Read this newsletter at your own risk. It may cause major depression.

News from the magazine industry is so gloomy that Hearst not only closed COSMOGIRL* 

 but the company-wide holiday party is cancelled.

We&apos;ve reported the heart-fibrillating statistics here throughout this year, so we won&apos;t repeat them. 

 But here&apos;s a different take:

MediaPost&apos;s Mag Bag on Oct 16 posted &quot;Insiders See More Closures In 2008-09&quot; which begins: 

 &quot;The coming year will see a wave of magazine closures, according to executives 

 from several big magazine groups, who spoke off the record about the prospects of the 

 magazine business.&quot;

The executives go on to name several magazines they see ready to fold:

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY*

 &quot;On top of all its other current woes, the US magazine business needs to be worried about 

 a consumer backlash against paper-based publishing products. That was the message 

 delivered to last week&apos;s American Magazine Conference by Canadian Forest Products 

 Association President Avrim Lazar. He predicted that environmentally-minded Americans 

 will increasingly focus on the connection between the paper-making industry and the problem 

 of global climate change.&quot;

 A door-to-door salesman stole a check from a mailbox Tuesday, according to a police report. 

 A man called 911 from the 2300 block of Palmer Street about 6:55 p.m. He said someone 

 rang his doorbell and he could see a man on his doorstep. He believed the man was a 

 salesman so he did not open the door, and the man finally left. 

 The man remembered he had placed an envelope containing a check in his mailbox earlier and 

 he went to see if the envelope was still there. It wasnt. 

 An arriving officer spotted the salesman walking down the street. He asked what he was doing 

 in the neighborhood. 

 The man said he was a magazine salesman. He did not have a permit to operate door-to-door 

 in Denton, according to the report. 

 The officer found the victims envelope in the salesmans pocket. 

 It had been opened and the check was crumpled up inside, 

 according to the police report. 

 Now how did that get there? the salesman asked.

 Janesville, Wisconsin
Beware: Door to Door Magazine Sales Scam !!!

 Janesville Police Warn Of Magazine Sales Scheme
Police: Sellers Claim To Be Fundraising
Channel 3000 News
WISC-TV CBS
UPDATED: 7:19 pm CDT October 15, 2008
 JANESVILLE, Wis. -- Door-to-door magazine salesmen in Janesville have caught the 

 attention of local police, who are trying to determine whether the business is legitimate or a scam.

It was brought to the attention of the Janesville police by a neighborhood watch group over 

 the past few days.

The watch group felt something wasn&apos;t right.

Police said the salesmen are young, possibly right out of high school or entering college, 

 and have been telling residents they&apos;re from the neighborhood, WISC-TV reported.

The salesmen say they&apos;re raising money for a trip to Europe or for school by selling magazines, 

 and even offering to wash cars.

However, after making contact with a few of these salesmen Wednesday afternoon, police found they&apos;re 

 from out of state.

Police also feel the story used to rope in customers may be untrue.

Technically, they&apos;re not doing anything illegal in Janesville because solicitors don&apos;t need 

 licenses to sell magazines in the city.

Still, police are urging residents to be wary.

&quot;It might show up that these people might get their magazines. But what we&apos;re seeing is, 

 the articles and papers we&apos;ve been investigating and looking up on the Internet, 

 people are not getting their products, which makes it a crime at that point,&quot; said 

 officer Chad Sullivan of the Janesville Police Department.

City officials are asking that all of these salesmen register themselves and their 

 vehicles through the city.

Police said if someone knocks on your door to sell you a product, ask for identification 

 and ask for more information on the product and company.

Officers will continue to monitor the current group of salesmen while they&apos;re in town.

 Children&apos;s book scam hits DeKalb and Sycamore
By ALAN EDRINN
The Northern Star
Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Ill.
October 10,2008
 Police are searching for a reported scam artist in the DeKalb and Sycamore area 

 claiming to sell childrens books.

 The DeKalb County Sheriffs office received a report of a salesperson under the name of 

 Craig Trautman selling childrens books and claiming to work for Dynasty Sales, according to a 

 DeKalb County Sheriffs Office news release. 

 The salesperson made a vague reference to being associated with NIU and was reported working in the 

 DeKalb area Wednesday, said DeKalb County Sheriff Roger Scott. There were also sporadic reports 

 of the salesman working in the area Oct. 3, and there may be more people working with the 

 salesman in the scam, Scott said.

 The salesman was reported going door-to-door selling the books, and after making a sales pitch, 

 will ask for a drink of water or to use the bathroom to gain access to the residence, Scott said. 

 Nothing has been reported stolen yet, but the salesman may be entering residences to spot 

 items to steal later, Scott said. The salesman is not giving the victims any goods while 

 going door-to-door but is only taking money and giving the victim a receipt, Scott said.

 The first report of the salesman came after a victim looked up the company and salesman online 

 and found it was reported to be part of a scam. The victim then stopped payment on the 

 check and contacted the sheriffs office, Scott said. Three other people have reported 

 coming in contact with the salesman but did not make any deals with him.

 The company the salesman said he worked for, Dynasty Sales, could not be verified by the 

 sheriffs office but did verify he is not associated with NIU, according to the release. 

 The suspect is not registered with Sycamore, DeKalb or DeKalb County, according to the release. 

 The salesman is described as a white male, between 15 and 19 years of age and about 5 feet 

 8 inches tall. He was seen driving a burgundy Ford Explorer or Expedition, Scott said.

 Any citizen that comes in contact with the suspect or company is encouraged to contact 

 local law enforcement.

 The same day the salesman was reported, DeKalb Police received reports of a salesperson 

 claiming to sell magazines in the parking lot of Famous Footwear, 2453 Sycamore Road, 

 at about 6:25 p.m.

 The victim said she was sitting in her car when the suspect approached and started 

 hitting on her, said DeKalb Police Lt. Gary Spangler. The victim told him to stop, 

 at which point he told her he was trying to sell magazines to win a contest. 

 The victim declined to buy any magazines and the suspect started yelling 

 at her before leaving, Spangler said.

 Spangler said they have gotten reports in the past of people coming into town in groups 

 selling magazines and was unsure if the two scams are connected. By ALAN EDRINN

 Houston Company Gets Sued Over Alleged Magazine-Subscription Scam
Chris Vogel
Houston Press
Wed Oct 08, 2008 at 11:51:43 AM
 Buying magazines on the cheap sounds like a good idea. So you can hardly blame folks such as 

 Andrea Cappuzzo of Independence, Missouri when she dialed up mags4cheap.com on the Web, a 

 site operated by a Houston-based company called Creative One.

The website offers sensational discounts on almost every major magazine title. Some, however, 

 say the deal is far too good to be true.

According to a complaint filed with the Houston chapter of the Better Business Bureau, 

 Cappuzzo ordered the National Enquirer in May 2007. She says her credit card was billed 

 immediately, and though she repeatedly called the company asking where her magazine was, 

 she never received an issue.

First I was told that the subscription didnt go through, she says. Then I was 

 told that the magazine company did not receive the money, then they lost the order. 

 Ive pretty much written off the money or the magazine. This company needs to be stopped.

Cappuzzo is hardly alone. The BBB says its received 721 complaints in the past 36 months. 

 And now a company that publishes several of the magazines that are not being delivered to 

 customers are taking a swing at the local subscription company.

American Media Inc., which publishes top-selling magazines such as the National Enquirer, 

 Mens Fitness, Shape, Globe and Mira, has filed a lawsuit in Houston federal court against 

 Creative One and at least two of its officers, David Shaw and Brandon Fallon, both of Houston.

American Media claims that Creative One does not have the authority to sell or collect 

 fees for subscriptions to its magazines. The publishing company claims it told Creative 

 One this summer to stop soliciting subscriptions to AMI titles, but that Creative One has 

 ignored its request. Indeed as of today, consumers can still order AMI publications 

 at mags4cheap.com.

When Hair Balls called Creative One this morning asking for comment on the pending 

 lawsuit, the man who answered the phone immediately hung up.

AMI claims in the lawsuit that it learned Creative One was taking payments for subscriptions 

 and then simply doing nothing, thus leaving the subscription unfilled. When angry consumers 

 called Creative One to complain, they were falsely told the issue was with the publisher.

Robert Dickenson of Kennewick, WA is in the same boat as Cappuzzo. He says he ordered 

 several magazines off of the website and never got a single one.

For a year now I have contacted then a dozen times and they promised a refund by check, 

 he tells the BBB. Every time I contact them they give me the run around. 

 They arent going to give my money back and it seems like there is nothing 

 I can do about it. I was robbed and know who the robber is but can do nothing.

Perhaps when the dust settles, this lawsuit can pave the way for consumers like Dickenson 

 and Cappuzzo to seek justice themselves.

Man pleads not guilty to sexual assault

 Updated 10/6: Man pleads not guilty to sexual assault
Sun-Times News Group
October 6, 2008
 An Alabama man accused of breaking into a La Grange home and sexually assaulting a 86-year-old woman 

 while he was selling magazines door-to-door this summer pleaded not guilty to the charges at a 

 hearing Monday.

 At a hearing Monday before Judge Colleen McSweeney Moore, George H. Lucas, 23, of Clanton, Ala., 

 pleaded not guilty to home invasion and aggravated sexual assault charges, Cook County States 

 Attorneys office spokesman Andy Conklin said.

 Authorities said at the time of the assault Lucas was in the Chicago area working as a 

 magazine salesman for Midwest Claring of Hazel Crest, a distributor for Connecticut-based 

 Paragon Sales, according to a release from Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart&apos;s office. 

 On Aug. 29, Lucas visited 25 houses and when his co-workers failed to pick him up, he drank 

 shots of vodka with a neighborhood resident, the release said.

 Lucas then began wandering the neighborhood and allegedly entered the victims home. Lucas 

 allegedly ate and watched TV, all while the 86-year-old woman slept, before seeing her in her 

 bedroom. He entered her room, covered her mouth, allegedly sexually assaulted her before he 

 fled the house. As he fled, Lucas threw the womans phone out of the window but left a bag 

 of magazine sales information in the victim&apos;s backyard, including information identifying him.

 As the victim was being treated at Adventist La Grange Memorial Hospital in La Grange 

 and talking to investigators, Lucas arrived at the same emergency room, complaining he 

 was sick and spitting up blood. Sheriff&apos;s police recognized his name from the identifying 

 information left at the scene, and arrested him.

 He is scheduled for a status hearing Nov. 13, Conklin said.

Door-To-Door Magazine Sales Scam Alert !!!

 Scam Alert: Con Artists Posing as Students

Last Update: 10/04 10:25 pm
 (10/04/08 - Memphis, TN)
Door to door salesman are posing as college students...hoping to rip you off. 

 The crooks have already approached several people in Midtown Memphis. 

 Some say the sales pitch sounds legit.

 A group of young people are going door to door posing as students at the 

 University of Memphis, selling magazines for a trip to Europe. But we checked with the 

 University, and there is no trip, and the salesmen aren&apos;t even students.

 Miriam Handorf was approached by these so called salesmen. Their pitch - &quot;I&apos;m a student at 

 Memphis and we have a debate team that&apos;s trying to go to London.&quot; It&apos;s just not a 

 fair presentation.&quot; Nor is it an accurate one according to the University of Memphis. 

 Handorf says &quot;another couple in the neighborhood actually opened their door and were 

 questioning the person and it happened to be a U of M professor, and knowing the school&apos;s 

 policy is not to solicit, he was pretty hot under the collar about how his school was 

 being presented.&quot;

 Nancy Crawford with the Better Business Bureau isn&apos;t surprised. 

 &quot;Door to door magazine sales are notorious for these things. 

 We just encourage people to always check out a business with the BBB, 

 especially if they&apos;re going door to door.&quot; 

 Handorf checked with the BBB and in this case, she also checked with her neighbors. 

 The Central Gardens Neighborhood Watch Association has more than 100 members. 

 When something is going on they get an email. &quot;Communication is key. 

 We have to know where the vulnerabilities are in order to stay protected.&quot; 

 Handorf was not ripped off, but says the crooks could target another neighborhood in the future. 

 &quot;The adage, buyer beware needs to be flipped around. 

 Seller beware, because we are prepared for you. 

 We know you&apos;re out there and we hope you&apos;ll find a better resource in making your money.&quot;

Ways to Protect Yourself from Door to Door Con Artists:

 Always check for identification. The salesman should have a Vendor I.D.
Don&apos;t hesitate to ask for supervisor or coordinators contact information.
You can always ask the salesman to put info in your mailbox, and the Better Business Bureau 

 says if you don&apos;t feel comfortable or don&apos;t want to be bothered, don&apos;t even answer the door.

 Detectives say a man held in the murder of an Albuquerque newlywed may be responsible for 

 five other murders.

 Clifton Bloomfield, 39, is in jail charged with the murder this summer of a newlywed man at 

 the man&apos;s Northeast Heights home has been named as a third suspect in the murders of a Korean 

 couple in 2007. 

 Albuquerque police and the district attorney&apos;s office said Bloomfield will be charged with the 

 deaths of Pung and Tak Yi now that new DNA evidence linking Bloomfield to the crime scene has turned up. 

 Bloomfield is in jail charged with three murders, including shooting and killing Scott Pierce 

 this past June. Police say Bloomfield and Jason Skaggs went to the home near Indian School 

 and Juan Tabo looking for another man who had moved out and killed the newlywed Pierce instead. 

 At the time of the Pierce killing, Bloomfield was out of jail on probation and on an ankle 

 bracelet electronic monitoring device after being convicted of robbery. 

 The Yis were beaten to death and Pung Yi was raped. Two door-to-door magazine salesmen 

 have already been charged with the murder. Police won&apos;t say how Bloomfield is related to the salesmen. 

 Police say that there&apos;s a possibility that Bloomfield could be implicated in three more murders. 

 They include the deaths of 81-year-old retired school teacher Josephine Selvage, interior designer 

 Carlos Esquibel, both in 2005 and the 2004 shooting death of Emery Julian. 

 Selvage was raped and strangled with a pair of pants in her home three days after Esquibel was 

 strangled inside his home. 

 Thursday night, Bloomfield was moved out of the Bernalillo County Jain and to the Sandoval 

 County Jail. Police say it is the best place to house Bloomfield as their investigation continues. By: Kayla Anderson, Eyewitness News 4, and Reed Upton, KOB.com

 New Suspect in Yi Killings
By T.J. Wilham

Friday, October 03, 2008
 A suspect awaiting trial in the shooting death of a newlywed earlier this year may have been involved in 

 five other killings, including the brutal 2007 slayings of a prominent Korean-American couple in the 

 Northeast Heights.

All the victims were killed in their homes. In addition to the newlywed and the elderly Korean couple, 

 they include a retired elementary school teacher and an interior designer.

It appears that detectives are prepared to charge Clifton Bloomfield, 39, in the 2007 deaths of Tak and 

 Pung Yi. There were signs that the couple had been savagely beaten and that Mrs. Yi had been sexually 

 assaulted.

Two traveling magazine salesmen Travis Rowley and Michael Lee have already been charged in the Yi deaths.

Bloomfield became a suspect in the Yi killings earlier this summer when forensic scientists 

 were going through evidence in the double homicide. 

 Detectives entered DNA collected from one of the Yis into a national database and got a match to 

 Bloomfield, whose DNA was on file in a federal database from a previous conviction.

Police officials confirmed the DNA link.

The Journal has also learned that police are looking into Bloomfield&apos;s possible involvement in at 

 least three more homicides: the 2005 killings of Josephine Selvage and Carlos Esquibel and the 

 2004 death of Emery Julian.

Charging Bloomfield in the Yi and other cases could be a political lightning rod.

Bloomfield was on probation after an armed robbery plea at the time of the Yi killings and 

 the death of newlywed Scott Pierce.

Mayor Martin Chvez had cited Bloomfield as an example when he held a news conference in 

 July criticizing judges for sentencing repeat offenders to probation and letting them 

 out on what he called low bonds.

Police officials said they have no plans to drop charges against Rowley and Lee. 

 But Rowley&apos;s attorney has filed a lawsuit against APD and the District Attorney&apos;s Office 

 claiming they withheld evidence, including DNA evidence against a suspect who isn&apos;t named in the suit.

That suspect is Bloomfield, who was arrested in June in connection with the death of Pierce, 

 a nurse who had just moved into a home on Hannett NE with his wife a month earlier.

That deadly attack appears to have been a mistaken identity revenge killing. 

 According to court records, Bloomfield, 39, and Jason Skaggs, 35, intended to kill another 

 man who had lived in the home before Pierce and his wife moved in.

In the other unsolved cases:

Emery Julian, 39, was found dead with a bullet wound to his head in his Chelwood Park NE apartment 

 in October 2004.

Esquibel and Selvage were strangled inside their homes three days apart in October 2005. Esquibel was 

 a 37-year-old interior designer and Selvage was an 81-year-old retired elementary school 

 teacher. Police are still testing DNA taken from Selvage&apos;s home.

At the time of the killings, police said they didn&apos;t believe the Esquibel and Selvage slayings were related.

Election politics

District Attorney Kari Brandenburg said Thursday that she believed Bloomfield 

 was involved in the Yi killings along with Rowley and Lee, but declined further comment.

&quot;It would jeopardize the ongoing investigation if I comment at this time,&quot; Brandenburg said. 

 &quot;There has been no (plea) agreement reached at this time, and it would be inappropriate for 

 me to do so with the investigation.&quot;

Meanwhile, Rowley&apos;s attorney, Stephen Aarons, learned of the DNA match in the Yi case and filed a 

 motion last month to have the charges against his client dismissed.

That motion has since been sealed by District Court Judge Reed Sheppard, who is presiding 

 over the cases against Rowley and Lee.

Brandenburg&apos;s challenger in the Nov. 4 election, Lisa Torraco, has criticized Brandenburg about how she has handled repeat offenders. One of the examples she has cited was Bloomfield, who was on probation for armed robbery at the time he was arrested in connection with the killing of Scott Pierce. 

 Bloomfield was also on probation at the time the Yis were killed. 

 &quot;I am doing my job, and I am sorry I am running for re-election,&quot; Brandenburg said in response 

 to Torraco&apos;s criticism. &quot;It is critical we handle the case and do the right things for 

 the right reasons, and the election has nothing to do with that.&quot;

No stranger

Bloomfield, who was earlier described by police as someone with links to white supremacist groups, is no stranger to law enforcement.

In July 2007, he pleaded no contest to robbery with a deadly weapon in connection to the 

 Nov. 29, 2005, home invasion robbery of Edwin and Rupe Garcia.

The plea deal set a maximum of three years of prison. District Court Judge Albert S. 

 &quot;Pat&quot; Murdoch sentenced Bloomfield to four years&apos; probation and 201 days of community custody, 

 which is similar to house arrest.

Bloomfield was given &quot;good time&quot; credit and was released from community custody 100 days early. 

 Had he not been given credit, he would have been in the community custody program when the Yis were killed.

Brandenburg said her office agreed to the plea deal because prosecutors didn&apos;t have enough evidence 

 and would likely have lost at trial.

At the time of the arrest, police said they had several tips and good victim identification. 

 However, Brandenburg said testimony by the elderly victims would not have held up in court.

&quot;We had no witnesses, no fingerprints and no DNA,&quot; Brandenburg said. &quot;It was that (the plea) or nothing.&quot;

According to court documents, Bloomfield apparently gained entrance to the Garcias&apos; home, 

 which was listed for sale, by posing as a potential buyer.

He took a tour of the home, took out a handgun and held it to the husband&apos;s neck, 

 then ordered the couple into a storage room and took their wedding ring and other jewelry 

 and valuables along with $140 in cash, according to court records.

Police have said that Bloomfield has an extensive criminal history in Arizona, where he 

 did prison time. He has multiple arrests in Arizona for burglary, armed robbery, kidnapping, 

 aggravated assault on a correction officer and theft by control. By T.J. Wilham

 Dont bother knocking: Council discusses No Knock ordinance
By Rob Barry/rbarry@cnc.com

Medford Transcript

 Medford -
Keeping telemarketers off the phone has been easier than keeping them off the doorstep. 

 But city officials have a plan to stop bothersome solicitors.

The City Council is expected to review an ordinance this week that would set up a No Knock 

 registry similar to the national Do Not Call Registry. The legislation, sponsored by 

 Councilor Michael Marks, would place restrictions on door-to-door soliciting.

I was reading online regarding a murder that took place in New Jersey, said Marks. 

 That prompted a lot of cities in other states to enact a no knock registry to try 

 to prevent people from praying on the elderly through these door-to-door sales.

In response to a resolution approved by the council over the summer, City Solicitor Mark 

 Rumley crafted an ordinance that would create a local registry.

According to the proposed two-page ordinance, any person wishing to peddle their wares at the 

 doorstep would have to obtain a license and pick up a copy of the registry. There is a background 

 check involved in obtaining a peddlers license.

Anyone who attempts to solicit an address on the registry will face a fine of up to $300, 

 a one-year license revocation and a one-year suspension of all door-to-door soliciting.

I was looking for two things, simplicity and effectiveness, Rumley said. I think this draft 

 does both those things. I also wanted to protect the First Amendment concerns.

The ordinance, Rumley said, would not prevent charitable or religious groups from soliciting.

A similar resolution passed recently in Claremont, Calif. Capt. Gary Jenkins, of 

 the Claremont Police Department, said it was necessary to protect the townspeople.

In December of 2006, we had a rape that was committed by a magazine solicitor, said Jenkins. 

 Then a year later, in December of 2007, we had similar incident with a traveling magazine salesman.

At the time, Jenkins said the towns solicitation ordinance was in need of review for 

 being unconstitutionally broad. So the police drafted an ordinance that would create 

 a registry and add a background check for peddlers and penalties for ignoring the registry.

In Claremont it now costs $300 just to apply for a commercial solicitation permit 

 that will expire in 90 days. Religious and political groups are not subject to the 

 permit or the registry.

So far, we havent had a commercial solicitor apply for a permit, said Jenkins. 

 Basically this has acted as a preventative measure.

As of Tuesday, the City Council was scheduled to discuss the ordinance in a Committee of 

 the Whole meeting, with Chief Leo A. Sacco Jr., Chamber of Commerce Executive Director 

 Cheryl White and Rumley also in attendance.

We seem to live in an age where our households are peppered with unsolicited calls 

 and contacts, said Rumley. This ordinance will be something to give our residents 

 one more quantum of peace in their homes.

Beware of Magazine Sales and Subscription Scams

 Beware of Magazine Sales and Subscription Scams
Article by Bill Fulks (12,892 pts)
Bright Hub
Published on Sep 26, 2008
 If that young person at your door gives you some long emotional story before they even tell 
 you what they are selling, then chances are they are involved in a scam. The sad 
 thing is that they might not even know it.

 A knock on the door... 

This past weekend, I had some friends over when someone rang my doorbell. I 
 looked through my peephole and thought the guy on my porch as another friend of mine 
 who was supposed to be out of town. When I opened the door, I realized that my 
 friend was still out of town, and the guy on my porch was there to sell me something. 
 For the record, I have never and will never buy anything from anyone who knocks on my door.

The first thing the guy said to me was, Your neighbors said you were friendly. Are you friendly? 
 I am pretty friendly, but I hope my neighbors didnt get this guys hopes up by telling him that. 
 He then hands me this beat up old card that has a bunch of handwritten notes like I Win! 
 and other junk on it. This guy, who was probably about 20 years old, then mentions the 
 name of some program he is in that is supposed to help him better his public relation 
 skills and something else. I wasnt really paying that much attention.

He went through this long spiel about how he needed 20,000 points to earn a trip to 
 somewhere and how he was in first place with 19,000 and needed just a few more to 
 get the trip. What it eventually got around to was the guy was trying to sell me some 
 overpriced magazines. I politely declined and the fake smile on his face quickly went away. 
 He made some comment that I think was hopefully polite, but I was already 
 closing the door when he said it.

Back in August 2005, the Washington Post did a story on Magazine Sales Scams where people 
 claimed to be from a school or some group, but were not. Even the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) 
 website warns about magazine subscription scams. A Google search for magazine sales scams 
 returns hundreds of articles from newspaper and television websites all over the United 
 States that report related scams in their area.

 Scam details... 

While not all door-to-door magazine sales are a scam, many of them are. 
 Often times, it is the people doing the selling who are as much a victim of the 
 scam as those people who actually buy the magazines. The sad part of it is that 
 the guy at my door might be an unsuspecting participant in the scam. He 
 might really think hes going to get a prize trip somewhere. I am pretty 
 sure he was lying about the 19,000 points and how he was in first place, 
 because it made for a juicy sales pitch. It was like he was trying to make 
 me feel sorry enough for him to want to buy a magazine. Homey dont play that.

I did some research on the subject, and uncovered another problem related to the magazine sales. 
 The unscrupulous companies who put these kids out on the street to go door-to-door often 
 work the sellers like indentured servants. Many of them are loaded up on a bus and 
 taken to distant areas where they are pretty much forced to work all day and most 
 wind up making very little money. It is promises of prizes like trips that entice 
 these young people into signing up for the work, but the majority of them end up 
 with very little to show for their effort.

In February 2001, the New York Times ran a horrifying four-page story about young people 
 caught up in magazine sales crews and the kind of things they went through. 
 Check it out and you may think twice about even opening the door to these people. 
 In fact, I wish now that I had warned that young man at my door of what he was 
 involved in, and to get out as soon as he could. If these people show up at your 
 home or business, dont fall for any of their sob stories. A legitimate salesperson 
 wouldnt need to get into such a long story before they even told you what they were selling.

 Orchard Lake, Michigan
Door-To-Door Magazine Sales Warning !!!
 September 24, 2008 
 Local police investigate solicitor reports
Similar cases seen in Orchard Lake, West Bloomfield
By David Wallace
C and G Staff Writer
candgnews.com
09/24/08
 ORCHARD LAKE Local police hope to find one or several suspicious solicitors apparently making the 

 rounds in the city and West Bloomfield Township.

 Orchard Lake police had reports Sept. 16-17 from multiple residents who said solicitors 

 came around for some supposed cause. According to Orchard Lake Police Sgt. David Sims, 

 at one point the solicitor claimed to raise money for Michigan State University baseball, 

 while at another time the cause reportedly was the West Bloomfield Bandits. 

 Apparently a common solicitation in these cases includes a young man claiming to be the son of a 

 doctor who lives in the area.

 Theyre using the name Dr. Andrews, said Sims. They also gave the name of a street, 

 Elmgate, but Sims said a check of a directory did not show such a doctor on Elmgate.

 Were very suspicious of this, said Sims.

 Weve had two reports so far, said West Bloomfield Police Lt. Tim Diamond, and we think 

 its the same guy, our two.

 The man in West Bloomfield apparently used slightly different names than Dr. Andrews.

 He changes his story just a little bit each time, said Diamond. The solicitor seems to 

 find out the name of a neighbor and use that as part of the come-on, Diamond explained. 

 Last year, Orchard Lake police caught a suspect after a man selling magazines gained 

 access to a womans home and stole money from her purse. In that incident, the man used 

 a ruse of needing to use the bathroom to gain access.

 Regarding the latest solicitor trouble, Sims said, We have not had any reported thefts in our city.

 However, a West Bloomfield resident on Pine Lake Road apparently was not so lucky. 

 A young man came to the door at the house about 8:15 Sept. 10 and was allowed into a 

 foyer. Afterward, a woman at the home discovered that a yellow-gold ring with diamonds 

 had disappeared from a desk in the foyer. The ring was valued at $8,000.

 Diamond said the other West Bloomfield report came from Cedarbank, which runs off of 

 Commerce Road, east of Keith Road. The solicitor managed to get $55.

 The solicitors Orchard Lake police did not have a solid number for sure, 

 but they suspect multiple young people in at least six encounters in the city, 

 including a female in one instance have not registered with the city or township, 

 as required. Sims described them as preppy and clean-cut.

 In one of the Orchard Lake incidents, on Sept. 17, a young man went to a home on 

 Elmgate and received a small donation, Sims said. However, the woman who gave the 

 donation began feeling suspicious about it, got in her car and caught up with the young man.

 When she started questioning the young man, he got angry and said he didnt need 

 the money. He reportedly threw it into her car and left. 

 My personal opinion is, obviously, he was starting to get worried about being challenged, 

 said Sims.

 Sims said another report in the city came from Twin Fawn, and the solicitors 

 seemed to target the area off of Old Orchard Trail.

 Anyone with information, including descriptions of the solicitors, should call police.

 We dont want residents with a good heart to get sucked into this, said Sims.

 Police caution residents not to let people into their homes and that anyone who feels 

 uncomfortable about a solicitor should call police so that investigators can identify the person.

 Lewiston, Idaho
Human Trafficking
 September 23, 2008 
 What appears to be scam, also seems to be case of human trafficking
&quot;John&quot; talks about how he answered an ad in Florida and ended up on the streets of the 

 Valley selling magazines.

 LEWISTON - It appears to be a form of human trafficking and it also is apparently happening in the Valley.

 At least one local woman thinks so. She says she stared it right in the face.

 &quot;John&quot; is back in his home of Pensacola, Florida now, a change from two weeks ago.

 &quot;I was sitting on my porch and I was talking on my cell phone, and this young kid was walking up 

 my driveway,&quot; said Carrie Jacobs.

 John was selling magazines door to door in the Valley, or so he said. He told Jacobs he was in a contest, 

 on a point system, working for a trip to the nation&apos;s capital.

 I said, no, I&apos;m not interested,&quot; said Jacobs.

 He told April Wade something similar, but with a different back-story.

 &quot;He was a couple credits away from getting his bachelor&apos;s degree, and that he transferred to LCSC,&quot; 

 said Wade. &quot;He just got married, he has a baby girl that&apos;s 

 two months old, he&apos;s staying at the Econolodge.&quot;

 But was John the scam artist or the victim of a bigger one?

 &quot;&apos;You&apos;re working so hard at it,&quot; Jacobs said she told John. &quot;What&apos;s in it for you? I want to know.&apos; 

 And he got real nervous and kind of fidgeted around and he said, &apos;I&apos;ll get to eat today.&apos;&quot;

 Jacobs figures out this type of thing for a living, as a client services director at Life 

 Choices Clinic in Clarkston. She said she asked if John wanted out and that he said yes. 

 He also agreed to be interviewed by Jacobs.

 In that interview he said he first answered an ad in his hometown classifieds, with a promise 

 to travel the U.S. He was given a bus ticket, direct to Lewiston. When he got here, 

 he was told he would be selling magazines door to door.

 &quot;If they ask you questions like, are you from here? Do you go to school here?, 

 you automatically say yes, because if you&apos;re from somewhere else, a lot of people 

 are going to frown upon it, John said. A lot of people want to help a kid in a contest, 

 and that&apos;s what they think they&apos;re doing.&quot;

 He said they follow a script. Trying to win a trip, using certain types of coercion, and 

 only accepting cash. This for a stay at the local Econolodge, and $20 a day for food. 

 Jacobs said John told her he felt like he was under the control of a pimp, his belongings 

 locked in a room at the motel, and only accessed with one of his employers present.

 Lewiston Police Chief Steve Orr said police hadn&apos;t had reports of human trafficking in the 

 Valley, but Jacobs said she thinks it certainly fits the definition.

 &quot;We hear about it,&quot; said Jacobs. &quot;That it&apos;s far away, and in another country and another place. 

 It is happening on our streets, and it is happening to our children.&quot;

 Jacobs took John to the YWCA, who helped him get a bus ticket back to Pensacola, but 

 before he boarded, John had advice for Valley residents.

 &quot;If somebody comes by and is selling magazines and has a PO Box,&quot; said Jacobs. &quot;What would you 

 suggest saying to them?&quot;

 &quot;Don&apos;t buy a magazine,&quot; said John. &quot;There are a lot of kids out there today, there&apos;s 

 tens of thousands out there doing this and there&apos;s a lot of them that probably want to 

 go home, but they&apos;re too scared to do anything about it.&quot;

 John said the group he was with was headed to Boise next.

 Police advise residents to be cautious of high-pressure sales at all times - scams or not.

 Cypress, California
Door-to-door Salesman Coaxes Way Into Home

 Cypress - Door-to-door Salesman Coaxes Way Into Home
And $25,000 In Jewelry Goes Missing
By Inland Empire Sep 15th, 2008 Category: Other California News
mymurrieta.com
 On September 10, 2008, Cypress Police were called to a residence in the 6600 block of Fichot Way, 

 in the City of Cypress reference a theft investigation. The female elderly widow victim 

 reported that on September 9, 2008, during the daytime hours, the described male suspect, 

 who was going door-to-door posing as a Kirby vacuum salesman, befriended her and was able to 

 gain entry into her residence through a convincing sales pitch.

 While inside the residence, the suspect asked to use the bathroom. The victim let him go to 

 the bathroom and he returned several minutes later without her thinking anything was wrong. 

 The next morning the victim discovered $25,000 in jewelry missing from her dresser. 

 She started to recall from the day before never hearing the toilet flush or any doors open 

 and close and put two and two together and called the police. After stealing from this 

 elderly victim the suspect had the audacity to ask to stay for dinner.

 The suspect was not located. A second male came to the door during the sales pitch but 

 left after the suspect spoke to him. He was described as the same as the primary suspect.

 Although a legitimate, alternative business practice, residents are reminded they should 

 be suspicious of anyone selling items door-to-door, and should never allow anyone access 

 into their homes under any circumstances.

 Legitimate sales representatives can easily show their products from a porch and wont 

 care to enter into ones home they are focused on the sale and not in getting into the house. 

 Additionally one should ask to see their solicitors permit which is required by Cypress 

 Municipal Code (15-56) for anyone selling door-to-door.

 This suspect was successful and will most likely return to our City so residents are 

 encouraged to call the Cypress Police Department at (714) 229-6600 (911 if an emergency) 

 if anyone matches this description and/or uses the same sales pitch.

 Lawd have mercy! The holler is in an uproar this morning.. we&apos;ve got the law on the phone and 

 our panties are in a collective wad.

It all began last night, while I was in the bathroom, tending to bathroom related duties.. 

 if you get my drift. I heard some car doors slamming outside and minute or two later, 

 I heard someone knocking on the front door, turning my normally mild mannered pooches in to 

 a pack of wild beasts.

I heard the Amazon corral the Boston Baked Beagle in to his crate and open the door.. 

 then it was silent. I figured it was either Aunt Moses or my trashy, big-boobed 

 cousin with the lazy eye&apos;s youngin, so I didn&apos;t get in any hurry. I mean.. you can&apos;t 

 rush nature anyway.

When I did emerge from the potty palace, I saw that the Amazon still had the front 

 door open, because it was blocking my passage down the hall. I assumed she was 

 talking to someone she knew from work or school or something. As I walked by, the 

 girl&apos;s eyes grew and she said, &quot;Oh, is this your mother?&quot;

She was scrawny, she looked like she could use a sandwich or six, but nicely dressed. 

 She introduced herself and proceeded to tell me that Quiznos had gone out of business 

 over in Scary Hillbilly Town and they&apos;d taken over their office. She said they were 

 going around, getting to know people in the area.

&quot;What kind of office?&quot; seemed like a reasonable question to ask, but she proceeded 

 to hand me a &quot;free gift&quot; of a can of Glade air freshener, then handed me two cards, 

 explaining that they were entry forms for a trip give away.

My internal bullshit alarms went off immediately.. and that can of Glade wasn&apos;t going to 

 cover the smell.

It was then that Miss Thang pushed her way past the door and invited her little ass in to my house.

Oh hell to the no.

She asked where my husband was, then when I said, &quot;I&apos;m not married,&quot; she went on to ask 

 if I was divorced or widowed or what.

&quot;I just never got married.&quot;

&quot;Well! Shake my hand!&quot; she said, wide eyed and simple minded. I just 

 gave her the STFU stink eye while she stood there with her hand extended.

&quot;Why?&quot; I asked.

She mumbled something about being single or something.. I&apos;m not sure what she was getting at.

She looked around, asked if we had any more animals, made some stupid comment about zebras 

 and giraffes then informed me that she&apos;d go get some stuff from the car for a demonstration 

 while I filled the cards out.

But as she was yammering, I&apos;d flipped the cards over and seen the only thing I needed to know.

Kirby.

Sweet Lord in heaven, the child thought she was going to come up in my house and 

 sell me a vacuum cleaner.

&quot;I&apos;m in the middle of cooking dinner and we don&apos;t really have time for anything like 

 this this evening,&quot; I began, but she interrupted before I could finish.

&quot;Oh that&apos;s fine, we don&apos;t mind. We can stay for dinner, we like good, southern cooking!&quot; 

 I have to give her credit, she had balls.

&quot;Um no, I&apos;m going to have to ask you to leave please.&quot;

She looked shattered, she muttered and tried to argue with me, making no effort whatsoever 

 to get out of my house. I&apos;d had all I was going to take of this bullshit and she was 

 going to leave, one way or another. I had to physically back Miss Thang out the door.

Girlfriend doesn&apos;t realize how close she came to an ass beating, pushing her way all up in my house.

That crap pisses me off.

This morning, I was sharing my little adventure with Lulu, who said they&apos;d been 

 to her parents house over the weekend and stayed for over an hour, refusing to leave when asked. 

 The story they told Lulu&apos;s parents didn&apos;t add up with what they told us so we got suspicious.

 We asked Thelma if she&apos;d heard anything about these people going door to door (she&apos;s married 

 to the town cop) and she said they&apos;d been run out of town Saturday. When I told her 

 they&apos;d shown up at my house last night, she got on the phone with her hubby, who said 

 that the next time someone pushed their way up in my house like that, I was to &quot;box their jaws.&quot;

Heh. Gotta love small town law enforcement.

Anywho.. after some investigating on our own, we&apos;ve determined that they probably 

 were just door to door Kirby salespeople, but that&apos;s no excuse for pushing your 

 way in to people&apos;s homes and not leaving when instructed to do so.

So Kirby? Ya&apos;ll suck. Come near my house again and you&apos;ll be Ozzy food. 

 He likes sales people. But next time, send one with a little more meat on their bones. 

 He&apos;s a big ol&apos; boy and has a healthy appetite. hiddenmahala.blogspot.com

 Traveling salespeople spook local residents

 Several door-to-door salespeople apparently asked some customers too many questions about 

 their children while peddling books this summer.

 They stirred up neighborhoods across the county, even inspiring a chain e-mail that warns others to beware.

 Those who met the salespeople describe a similar situation: the sellers - described as 

 young, blond, blue-eyed and speaking with thick accents - said they were from Estonia, 

 offered educational books, and asked questions about where children lived in the neighborhood 

 and even what neighbors were home on the street.

 Some said a solicitor told them he was gathering information about school-age children. 

 Others said a salesman told them he wanted to discuss the local school programs with households 

 of children.

 The warning e-mail included reports of encounters in Bourbonnais, Lockport, Manhattan, Mokena, 

 New Lenox, Joliet, Plainfield and Montgomery.

 &quot;(At the time) it didn&apos;t dawn on me that it was anything out of the ordinary,&quot; said one resident 

 of Champion Creek subdivision in Plainfield who did not want his name published. 

 The saleswoman who came to his door said she approached him because a neighbor 

 said he had a child.

 &quot;If people start asking about where children live, in hindsight, that should be a 

 pretty big red flag,&quot; he said. &quot;You don&apos;t want to be giving out that information to people.&quot;

 The next day, that resident got the warning e-mail. Some residents said the solicitors 

 had drawn maps of their neighborhoods and had marked the houses where children lived.

 The solicitors were legitimate, at least in Plainfield and Lockport, despite their sometimes 

 unsettling sales pitch.

 In both communities, the salespeople applied for permits to sell products from 

 Southwestern Company. The firm recruits college students to work as independent 

 contractors selling educational books and software that the students purchase 

 wholesale through the company.

 According to the company&apos;s Web site, www.southwestern.com, students from 350 colleges 

 and universities in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa and South America have 

 participated in the program.

 It is the oldest direct-selling company in the nation, said Trey Campbell, 

 the company&apos;s communications manager, adding that the company counts Ken Starr, 

 author Max Lucado and Texas Gov. Rick Perry among its alumni.

 Southwestern Company has been accredited with the Better Business Bureau since 

 1961 and has a satisfactory record with the bureau. It is a member of the Direct 

 Selling Association, along with companies such as Mary Kay and Avon.

 Campbell said students are endorsed by their parents to participate in the program and 

 are trained before moving in with host families around the country for the summer.

 The students are taught to ask customers for referrals to friends, family or 

 neighbors who might be interested in the products, Campbell said.

 &quot;We don&apos;t get this complaint very often but it does happen sometimes, especially 

 with international students,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;They have innocent intentions, but 

 sometimes if it&apos;s not done in the right way it can certainly be taken the wrong way 

 and send up red flags for somebody.&quot;

 International students make up about a third of the total number participating each summer, 

 he said. This year about 2,700 students are selling books around the country.

 These days, people are fairly savvy about solicitors. Most communities require door-to-

 door salespeople to get a municipal permit, which residents can and should ask to see.

 Southwestern&apos;s Web site includes a press release offering tips on how to recognize 

 legitimate door-to-door salespeople.

 Salespeople should carry identification and have a municipal permit where required, 

 the release said. It urged residents to be cautious and check companies with the Better 

 Business Bureau if they suspect a scam.

Defense: Shooting Suspects Didn&apos;t Kill Vandy Professor

 Defense: Shooting Suspects Didn&apos;t Kill Vandy Professor
newschannel5.com
Posted: Sep 9, 2008 05:51 PM CDT
 NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A defense attorney for two men charged with killing a Vanderbilt University 
 professor and his sister said she has proof her clients are innocent. 
 In August, Pierre Colas was fatally shot and his sister injured during an apparent 
 robbery attempt at his home. Marie Colas later died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
 Four people were charged with homicide.
 Last week, public defender Laura Dykes argued Michael Holloway and Thomas Reed did not try 
 to Pierre Colas and did not have anything to do with his murder.
 Dykes filed a motion to dismiss the homicide charge, contending Reed and Holloway were not 
 present at the anthropologist&apos;s home when he was shot. Metro police said the murder 
 happened around 9:15 p.m. on Aug. 26.
 According to a statement from Reed and Holloway&apos;s employer, the pair had worked in Clarksville 
 that day and returned to a South Nashville hotel between 8:55 and 9:05 p.m. before attending 
 a 10:30 p.m. meeting.
 In Tennessee, someone can still be charged with murder even if they were not present at the crime.
 Former prosecutor Jim Todd said prosecutors will have to prove Reed and Holloway benefited 
 from the murder and assisted in it. 
 Metro police said the suspects are on surveillance video using the slain professor&apos;s 
 stolen credit card three hours after he was killed.
 Todd said the key for the prosecution will be to prove the suspects helped in the murder in some way.
 The district attorney did not comment on the case but the theory of criminal responsibility 
 has been used several times successfully in Tennessee. The theory was applied 
 during the trail for five people charged in the shooting death of a delivery man on 
 the Tennessee State University campus in 2005. He was shot by one gunman, but five 
 people were charged because they had talked about the crime before it happened.
 In the Bellacino&apos;s double murder, the person who picked up the alleged shooter also was charged 
 with homicide. 
 Attorneys for George Cody and Gennyfer Hutcherson, who were also charged with homicide, 
 have not filed a motion to dismiss.
 Police said they are still looking for additional suspects. 
 The case of the four suspects charged with homicide has been bound over to the Davidson 
 County grand jury. newschannel5.com

Don&apos;t Close Door On No-Knock; Rewrite It

 Don&apos;t Close Door On No-Knock; Rewrite It
Author: Anonymous.
Section: Editorial
Albuquerque Journal. Albuquerque, N.M.: Sep 9, 2008. pg. A.5
 Just because Albuquerque city councilors have decided not to answer Mayor Martin Chvez&apos;s call 

 for a no-knock ordinance doesn&apos;t mean they should close the door on the issue. 

 Because it&apos;s not just about the worst-case scenario, where thugs operating as magazine salesmen 

 barge in and brutally murder residents instead of trying to get them to buy two years of Field&amp;Stream. 

 It&apos;s about the everyday need to protect people&apos;s privacy from an outdated and intrusive business model. 

 The national do-not-call list is a success for that very reason. 

 The council vote last week was unanimous against cracking down on door-to-door solicitors by 

 creating a no-knock list residents can join and requiring businesses to apply for a permit 30 days 

 before showing up on people&apos;s doorsteps, do background checks on their peddlers and post a $500 

 bond. An amendment would have banned solicitors under age 18. 

 All are solid ideas that protect residents and sellers alike from unscrupulous businesses 

 that have a proclivity for dropping into town, then out of sight. 

 Councilor Ken Sanchez, who sponsored the measure for Chvez, says he wasn&apos;t convinced there was a 

 plan to enforce it. He ultimately asked councilors to kill it because the city already has a law 

 prohibiting knocking when there&apos;s a &quot;No Solicitation&quot; sign. 

 He should ask the average Albuquerque resident how many times he or she has had to go to the 

 door because someone ignored that sign. And he should demand an enforcement plan. 

 Let&apos;s hear the specifics of how a no-knock protection would operate in practice. 

 (Here&apos;s a tip: The millions in federal fines seem to have encouraged compliance with the do-not-call 

 registry.) And then let&apos;s write it all into a revamped solicitation ordinance. 

 Councilor Michael Cadigan says the current law should be rewritten, in part because much of what 

 it addresses is outdated -- there aren&apos;t many doorto-door buggy salesman anymore. 

 But there are plenty of annoying and potentially predatory sales pitches. 

 The city and council should devise a detailed pitch of their own to combat them. Author: Anonymous.

Magazine Salesman Arrested On Theft Charges

 Arrest made in magazine sales theft scheme

 FARMINGTON - Thanks to the publics help, a woman selling magazine subscriptions 

 door to door who allegedly stole cash from a homeowner on Saturday in 

 Farmington has been arrested on a charge of misdemeanor theft.

 Shaleen Hensley, 19, of Texas, was arrested following a tip from an Oakland resident 

 who called police after reading about the story published in news outlets over the weekend.

 Farmington Police Officer Ed Hastings had asked the public for help in identifying a woman 

 who said she was selling magazines for Atlantic Circulation, Inc. This came after a Farmington 

 homeowner said a woman whom she had asked into her home had, at some point while she was 

 trying to sell her a magazine subscription, took a stack of cash off the table. 

 The homeowner noticed the cash, totaling less than $500, was missing after the sales woman 

 left and called police.

 A magazine sales woman fitting the description showed up at the door of an Oakland 

 resident, who then called the Oakland Police Department. Police officers responding were 

 able to locate the woman going to door to door in Oakland and called Officer Hastings. 

 Although she looked similar to the suspect, Hastings said, it turned out she wasnt the 

 same woman reported in Farmington. They did, however, find out another woman fitting the 

 description who was sharing a motel room in Lewiston with her. Both women were selling 

 subscriptions for Atlantic Circulation, Inc.

 Hastings interviewed the suspect at the Lewiston motel and arrested her. It turns out 

 that there are 30 people working in the central Maine area selling magazine subscriptions, 

 Hastings said.

 People should use caution when anyone comes to the door. Theyre not always who they say they are, 

 he said. By Bobbie Hanstein

 Aurora police warn of suspicious salespeople popping up in area
By JANET LUNDQUIST jlundquist@scn1.com
The Beacon News
September 8, 2008
 Although they have taken no reports of incidents within the city limits, Aurora police are 

 warning residents to be aware of door-to-door salespeople who have been asking suspicious 

 questions in neighboring towns. 

 The salespeople apparently asked some customers questions about their children while selling books. 

 They stirred up neighborhoods across Will County, even inspiring a chain e-mail that warns others to beware. 

 Those who met the salespeople describe a similar situation: the seller -- described as young, 

 blond, blue-eyed and speaking with a European accent -- said they were from Estonia, explained 

 that they were peddling educational books, and asked questions about where children lived in the 

 neighborhood and even what neighbors were home on the street. 

 The warning e-mail included reports of encounters in Bourbonnais, Lockport, Manhattan, Mokena, 

 New Lenox, Joliet, Plainfield and Montgomery. 

 Plainfield police took so many complaints on the solicitor -- about 15 -- that Police Chief 

 Don Bennett decided to revoke the soliciting permit. 

 A Lockport officer talked to a Southwestern Company manager about the complaints. 

 The manager said one of their business practices is to ask customers to refer them to other children 

 living in the area who would be interested in their product. 

 It appears, at least in Plainfield and Lockport, the solicitors were peddling a legitimate product. 

 In both communities, the salespeople applied for permits to sell products from Southwestern. 

 The firm recruits college students to serve as independent contractors selling educational 

 books and software that they purchase wholesale through the company. 

 Aurora police are encouraging anyone who comes in contact with similar circumstances to call 

 (630) 859-1700. They reminded residents that they should never let solicitors into homes, and 

 never share information about when they, or their children, are home. 

 Aurora city ordinances require solicitors to register with the city clerk and wear 

 their registration and business ID. Solicitors are prohibited from visiting 

 any homes in Aurora that are posted &quot;no peddlers or solicitors,&quot; &quot;no advertisement&quot; or

 &quot;no trespassing.&quot; By JANET LUNDQUIST jlundquist@scn1.com

 Man held on bond in sexual assault case

 La Grange, IL -
A 23-year-old magazine salesman from Alabama was charged Tuesday with breaking into an 

 86-year-old La Grange Highlands womans home and sexually assaulting her during the 

 Labor Day weekend, according to the Cook County Sheriffs Office.

 George Lucas, of Clanton, Ala., is charged with home invasion and aggravated criminal sexual 

 assault, both Class X felonies. He is being held on $750,000 bond. His next court date is Sept. 16.

 County police spokesman Steve Patterson said Lucas had no serious prior run-ins with 

 the law, with the exception of a probation violation related to a DUI offense in Georgia. 

 You just dont know what goes through someones mind to do what that guy did, Patterson said. 

 Investigators said Lucas was in the area selling magazines door-to-door for Hazel Crest-based 

 Midwest Clearing, a distributor for Connecticut-based Paragon Sales. 

 He had been with a sales team from Wisconsin that began canvassing the 

 La Grange Highlands area around 2:30 p.m. Friday. 

 Lucas was to make sales calls on 25 homes before being picked up around 8:30 p.m. 

 According to investigators, Lucas said he began drinking shots of vodka 

 with a neighborhood resident after his co-workers failed to pick him up.

 He walked to a nearby gas station around 10 p.m. to purchase cigarettes, then began 

 wandering the neighborhood. He was in the victims backyard for a short time before 

 going into her home in the 1300 block of 52nd Place. Lucas told police he entered 

 through an unlocked door. However, police found a screen had been cut open.

 Lucas told investigators he ate and watched TV in the victims home before seeing her 

 sleeping in her bedroom. He then entered her room, covered her mouth and sexually assaulted her.

 Lucas left a bag of magazine information in the victims backyard, including information 

 identifying him, after he threw her home phone out of the house and fled.

 The woman made it to the home of a neighbor, who then dialed 911.

 Lucas arrived early Saturday morning at the Adventist La Grange Memorial Hospital emergency 

 room, where the victim was being treated and talking to investigators. 

 Lucas was complaining he was sick and spitting up blood. Sheriffs police 

 investigators recognized his name from the identifying information left at the 

 scene and arrested Lucas. By Joe Sinopoli, jsinopoli@mysuburbanlife.com

 Pratt, Kansas
Magazine Sales Fraud Alert

 Pratt, Kan. -
The public is warned to be alert for door-to-door magazine sales from Atlantic Circulation.

 Five members of Atlantic Circulation were arrested in Pratt Thursday night for refusing 

 to obtain a license to sell door-to-door. 

 All five posted bond and have left Pratt, said Pratt Police Detective Jeff Ward. 

 In August an alert was issued against Atlantic Circulation Inc. of York, Pa. 

 The Pratt Police Department received many complaints against the company that was 

 going door-to-door trying to sell magazines. 

 Those complaints included failure to register to solicit sales within Pratt, 

 suspicious and deceptive activity and potential fraud related to individuals taking 

 money from customers with no intent of providing the product. 

 The public needs to continue to be vigilant for Atlantic Circulation or other organizations 

 selling door-to-door.

 Only Pratt County Schools have legitimate magazine sales in Pratt. If anyone has a question 

 about door-to-door magazine sales or any other door-to-door sales they should contact the 

 Pratt Police Department immediately at 672-5551, Ward said. 

 During the August investigation 11 members of Atlantic Circulation were questioned and a 

 large number of sales receipts, personal checks and cash were taken as evidence. Several 

 members had active warrants including one warrant for the same solicitation activity, one 

 was a convicted felon and several had suspended drivers licenses. GateHouse News Service

 Boonton Township, New Jersey
Illegal Door-To-Door Magazine Sales

 Cops: Despite warning, illegal door-to-door sales continued

 BOONTON TWP. -- A woman who attempted to sell magazine subscriptions to Kinnelon residents 

 on Tuesday night was shooed away by police there after they discovered she was wanted for 

 theft in Kansas.

 But that apparently didn&apos;t deter Sarah Keller, 21, of Pensacola, Fla.

 Boonton Township police said Keller was arrested on soliciting charges on Wednesday night 

 after officers received a report of a suspicious person in the area of Magnolia 

 Lane and Bradford Terrace.

 Police stopped Keller, who fit the description of a woman selling magazines door-to-door 

 in the Brae Loch condo complex.

 Two warrants for her arrest were discovered from the Reno County Sheriff&apos;s Office in 

 Hutchinson, Kan., for felony theft and aggravated failure to appear in court, police said.

 Kansas authorities later advised police that Keller would not be extradited. 

 A representative of Face to Face Technologies picked up Keller at headquarters, police said.

 Keller, who did not have a soliciting permit, told police she was one of six people 

 working for Face to Face Technologies, which lists a company address in Golden, 

 Colo. Police said she was unaware a soliciting permit was required to sell magazines in 

 Boonton Township.

 Two personal checks from sales made in the area were found in her possession. 

 Police contacted the owners of the checks, who responded to headquarters to retrieve them.

 Kinnelon police discovered outstanding warrants for Keller and another member of the Face 

 to Face group from Tennessee, but did not charge them with soliciting.

 Thursday&apos;s arrest of Keller marked the second time this summer that Boonton 

 Township police have nabbed groups for soliciting. In July, three people were 

 arrested after residents complained of suspicious characters selling funding 

 for various programs.

 Kinnelon police warn residents of solicitors
Say 3 going door to door didn&apos;t have permits; two found to have warrants
By Tehani Schneider Daily Record September 4, 2008
 KINNELON -- Borough police are urging residents to keep an eye out for door to door solicitors 

 after two people apprehended this week were found to have outstanding warrants from Kansas and Georgia.

 Police were called to a neighborhood at the border with Butler after receiving 

 complaints from area residents of three people selling magazine subscriptions around 8 p.m. on Tuesday.

 Sarah M. Keller, 21, of Pensacola, Fla., Eric M. Leach, 21, of Lenoir, Tenn., and Joel Smith, 21, 

 of Minnesota, told police they were employed by Face to Face Technologies, 

 a company with an address in Golden, Colo., said Lt. John Schwartz, a department spokesman.

 A further check by police revealed that Keller had two aliases and a current 

 theft warrant out of Kansas, Schwartz said. Leach was found to have warrants from Georgia for 

 driving while intoxicated and drug violations, he said. The charges did not provide for 

 their extradition back to the states in question in the event of their arrest.

 None of the three had a soliciting permit but they were not charged 

 by borough police, Schwartz said.

 &quot;We told them to leave town, which they did,&quot; Schwartz said.

 Police learned that the individuals were staying in a hotel in East Hanover, which was 

 confirmed by police there on Wednesday.

 Police around Morris County frequently encounter groups of solicitors, generally in the summer.

 One such individual who was apprehended in the past was newly released from serving a prison 

 term in Florida for a home invasion, Schwartz said.

 And this past July, police in Boonton Township nabbed three people for seeking funding 

 for various programs without a permit.

 Schwartz cautioned area residents to be careful of individuals they allow into their 

 homes to sell magazines.

 &quot;We understand (these companies) are selling magazine subscriptions but we want to 

 make it very clear that these people that they employ are not choir boys,&quot; he said.

 American Fork, Utah
Magazine Salesman Charged With
Attempted Murder And Aggravated Sexual Assault
 September 4, 2008 
 American Fork police share tips for dealing with solicitors
Barbara Christiansen - North County Staff
Daily Herald
Thursday, 04 September 2008
 It&apos;s just a little over a week since a solicitor allegedly sexually assaulted an American 

 Fork woman in her home, and American Fork police are urging residents to exercise caution. 

 Brian James Mask has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault in 

 Provo&apos;s 4th District Court on Tuesday. Both charges are first-degree felonies punishable 

 by up to life in prison. Mask is being held in the Utah County Jail on $200,000 bail, 

 awaiting a preliminary hearing on Sept. 9. 

 The victim, a 58-year-old woman, reportedly underwent surgery Tuesday to begin repair 

 work on her nose, which was broken in five places. In the time since the Aug. 25 assault, 

 two other people have been arrested for selling door to door without a license. 

 American Fork Police Chief Lance Call has issued a warning to the public, telling them how 

 to protect themselves and how they can help the police in the case of violations. 

 The city has had an ordinance regarding solicitors for about 18 months, Call said. He urged 

 residents to take precautions. 

 &quot;I would like to raise the public awareness. I would like to let the residents know the things 

 we have in place to protect them from what happened a week ago,&quot; he said in a Monday interview. 

 Under the provisions of the city&apos;s ordinance, a company is required to have a 

 business license when it brings solicitors to work in the community. The company pays 

 for a temporary business license, and each solicitor has an ID card to wear. 

 Heidi Mitchell, who handles business licenses for American Fork, explained the process. 

 &quot;We give them a temporary license that same day,&quot; she said. It is good for 25 days. 

 At that point, they are eligible to obtain an annual permit, but most do not stay that 

 long, she said. The company pays $15 per solicitor and each must submit a background 

 check which is no older than 180 days. Those are provided by the Utah Department of 

 Public Safety, Bureau of Criminal Identification. 

 Mitchell said there had been more requests this year than in the past. 

 &quot;We have had more this year than we usually do,&quot; she said. &quot;Generally we get 10 to 15 a year. 

 This year we have had closer to 20.&quot; 

 Call said when a solicitor comes to a door, he or she should display the identification 

 card. If that card is not there, Call recommended the resident decline to do business and 

 call the police department. 

 &quot;One of the fundamental rules is to never allow anybody in your home that you don&apos;t 

 know,&quot; he said. &quot;If you want to transact some business with them, do it on your porch 

 or make sure there are other people around.&quot; If the person cannot produce the identification, 

 he asked the resident to call 911. 

 &quot;We can dispatch a car right away,&quot; he said. The department would like as much information 

 as possible. It could include a description of the solicitor and vehicle, which direction he 

 or she was headed, and what type of merchandise was offered for sale. 

 Call said that often when a solicitor is asked for the identification, he or she will 

 move to a different locale. 

 &quot;Their comment to us is, they would go somewhere else, to a city that doesn&apos;t have 

 an ordinance,&quot; he said. Those communities are getting fewer, with most 

 cities now having a solicitors ordinance on the books. 

 &quot;This isn&apos;t 100-percent foolproof,&quot; he said. &quot;But criminals aren&apos;t as likely to 

 commit a crime when we have their information on file.&quot; Barbara Christiansen - North County Staff

 Provo, Utah
Magazine Salesman Brian James Mask
Faces Charges of:
Attempted Murder With Serious Bodily Injury
And Aggravated Sexual Assault

 Salesman faces attempted murder charge in Utah County case
By Sara Israelsen-Hartley
Deseret News
Published: September 3, 2008
 PROVO A door-to-door salesman who police say attacked a 58-year-old woman in her home 

 seemed confused Tuesday by his charge of attempted murder.

 Brian James Mask, 25, stood before 4th District Judge James Taylor Tuesday morning on felonies 

 of attempted murder with serious bodily injury and aggravated sexual assault.

 &quot;I thought it was aggravated battery,&quot; Mask said.

 Taylor clarified that in Utah there is no such charge. So Mask, from Chicago, tried again.

 &quot;It was aggravated assault, my first charge.&quot;

 &quot;Sir, you&apos;re charged with what&apos;s on the (document),&quot; Taylor said.

 &quot;You get attempted murder for punching someone?&quot; Mask replied.

 Mask was arrested Aug. 25 by Lehi police after a woman called 911 to say she had been 

 sexually assaulted and attacked by a large man who had been selling magazines door to door.

 Police said the man came to the woman&apos;s home in American Fork and made his magazine pitch. 

 Then, he told her he needed her signature and was allowed in the home.

 Once inside, police say Mask, at 6 feet, 2 inches tall and 275 pounds, grabbed the 

 smaller woman and dragged her into the back bedroom.

 Police said he took off some of her clothes and sexually abused her, all while holding 

 his hands around her neck, choking her, then later punching her.

 Those factors are enough for the attempted murder charge, said prosecutor Donna Kelly.

 &quot;Choking someone till they pass out, our office believes, is attempted murder,&quot; 

 Kelly said. &quot;Causing her to pass out and leaving her there for (dead).&quot;

 The woman was in the hospital Tuesday for facial reconstruction surgery, Kelly said. 

 During the attack, Kelly said Mask broke five bones in her face and severely 

 dislocated and broke her nose.

 After the attack, she crawled to the bathroom and waited until she was sure it 

 was safe, then called police.

 American Fork police put out an alert for the man and Lehi police found him soon after at a bus stop.

 At a previous bail hearing, Mask invoked his right to a speedy trial. 

 So at Tuesday&apos;s court appearance, Kelly asked for a quickly scheduled preliminary 

 hearing to preserve Mask&apos;s rights. However, she&apos;s a bit concerned the victim may 

 not have recovered sufficiently by the hearing on Sept. 9.

 Mask was appointed a public defender, despite making $250,000 last year selling magazines.

 &quot;Where is that money now?&quot; Taylor asked.

 &quot;I travel state to state,&quot; Mask said. &quot;I blew it.&quot;

 Mask, who has claimed to be part of a gang from Chicago, will have an attorney assigned 

 to him and present with him at his next hearing. He is in the Utah County Jail on $200,000 bail.

 Tuesday, September 02, 2008 A 23-year-old Alabama man is charged with breaking into a 

 LaGrange womans home and sexually assaulting her during the Labor Day weekend, 

 the Office of Sheriff Thomas J. Dart announced Tuesday.

George H. Lucas was in the Chicago area selling magazines door-to-door, investigators said. 

 Lucas was working for Midwest Clearing, of Hazel Crest, which is a distributor for 

 Connecticut-based Paragon Sales. He had been with a crew from Wisconsin when the group 

 targeted the LaGrange Highlands area around 2:30 p.m. Friday. After he had visited 25 houses, 

 Lucas was supposed to be picked up around 8:30 p.m. When his co-workers failed to pick him up, 

 he drank shots of vodka with a neighborhood resident, investigators said.

Lucas then walked to a nearby gas station around 10 p.m. to purchase cigarettes, 

 after which he began wandering the neighborhood. He stayed in the victims backyard 

 for a while before going into the victims home. Though investigators found a cut screen, 

 Lucas told police he entered through an unlocked door.

Lucas ate and watched TV in the victims home, while she slept, before seeing her in her bedroom. 

 He entered her room, covered her mouth and sexually assaulted her before fleeing, throwing her 

 home phone out of the house. As he fled, Lucas left a bag of magazine sales information in the 

 victims back yard, including information identifying him.

As the victim was being treated at LaGrange Hospital and talking to investigators 

 early Saturday morning, Lucas arrived at the same emergency room, complaining he was 

 sick and spitting up blood. Sheriffs police investigators recognized his name from the 

 identifying information left at the scene and arrested Lucas.

Lucas, of Clanton, Ala. is charged with home invasion and aggravated criminal sexual assault, 

 both class X felonies. He is being held on $750,000 bond. His next court date is Sept. 16. Press Release

Magazine Salesmen Warning !!!
Door-to-Door Sales Company:
Prestige Sales
 September 2, 2008 
 Barnstable police warn of magazine salesmen
By Karen Jeffrey
STAFF WRITER
Cape Cod Times
September 02, 2008 12:44 PM
 HYANNIS - Barnstable police have received complaints that people have been going door-to-door 

 selling magazines in a number of Barnstable neighborhoods.

 According to Sgt. Sean Sweeney, the sales people are apparently working for a company 

 called Prestige Sales, but are falsely identifying themselves as local residents and in some 

 cases as selling the magazines for local nonprofit groups.

 Sweeney said that the sales people have asked for cash.

 There is a Web site for Prestige Sales but there is no telephone number, street or post 

 office box listed on the Web site. The site offers a form that can be emailed to the company. 

 Barnstable police have spoken with a representative of the company, which sells magazines, Sweeney said.

 A complaint was made to police Monday by a woman who said a man appeared at her door and 

 identified himself as a Prestige salesman and was collecting donation for Boston Childrens Hospital. 

 The woman told police the young man said he got her name and address from neighbors who 

 had donated to the fund. He also said that he would return later to wash her windows 

 as a demonstration of his good nature.

 The woman told police that she was suspicious, but she and her husband each gave the man $55.

 Police interviewed neighbors who also told them that they had donated cash and checks to 

 the man. One of the residents of the neighborhood turned over video from a surveillence 

 system at his home and police are having the Barnstable County Bureau of Criminal 

 Investigation develop still photos from the video in an attempt to identify the salesman.

 Later in the day a man who identified himself as a salesman for the company appeared 

 at the police station and said all the money he collected had been turned over to Prestige Sales.

 According to town bylaws, any company doing door-to-door sales are required to register 

 at the police station and notify police daily on what neighborhoods they will be doing business in,

 said Sweeney.

 No one from Prestige has registered with the town, he said.

 Sweeney said that the company typically drops off a group of young people in a town to do the 

 door-to-door sales solicitations and picks them up at the end of the day. By Karen Jeffrey

 Nashville, Tennessee
Vanderbilt Professor Murdered
 August 30, 2008 
 Vanderbilt professor&apos;s ID used after his murder
Four arrested in professor&apos;s death
By RACHEL STULTS
Staff Writer
The Tennessean
August 30, 2008
 Just three hours after a respected Vanderbilt University professor was shot to death, 

 his suspected killers were using his identification to buy high-ticket items from several 

 Nashville businesses, police say.

And they were smiling and laughing while they did it.

Four people have been arrested in the slaying of Pierre Colas in his East Nashville home Tuesday night.

One more suspect could still be charged, and police will be pursuing him in the coming days, 

 said Metro Police Lt. Danny Driskell.

Police believe that robbery was the primary motive, and that the suspects did not know Colas.

The suspects in custody are: Thomas Andrew Reed, 20; Michael Shane Holloway, 22; George Eugene 

 Cody, 29; and Gennyfer Dawn Hutcherson, 35. They are being charged with criminal homicide in the 

 death of Colas and attempted criminal homicide in the shooting of his sister, Marie Colas.

Colas, 32, a professor in VU&apos;s anthropology department, was found dead in his home after his 

 roommate, an associate professor at Vanderbilt, heard footsteps and gunshots downstairs and 

 called 911. Marie Colas, 27, a postgraduate student in Swit zerland who was visiting her brother, 

 was shot in the head. She was still in very critical condition Friday night at Vanderbilt 

 University Medical Center.

 Videos lead to suspects 

On Thursday afternoon, police discovered that &quot;items of value&quot; some upwards of hundreds 

 of dollars were being purchased from various businesses using Colas&apos; identification just 

 three hours after his murder, Driskell said in a news conference Friday.

Surveillance tapes recovered from the businesses showed the individuals laughing and 

 smiling while making those purchases. The videos also showed their vehicle.

At 4 a.m. Friday, officer Kenneth Bray was patrolling the area where the murder occurred 

 when he spotted a car outside a house on West Sharpe Avenue that matched the description of 

 the one used in the purchases, Driskell said. The home is about two blocks away from Colas&apos; 

 residence on McFerrin Avenue.

Bray stepped out of his cruiser to get a closer look at the license tag, and a man stepped 

 out of the house to meet him on the front porch, Driskell said. Police found two other men 

 on the porch and a woman inside.

Cody and Hutcherson share the home at West Sharpe Avenue, and Reed and Holloway were 

 staying at a LaQuinta Inn on Sidco Drive in South Nashville, Driskell said. Police 

 obtained a search warrant for the residence, the three hotel rooms at LaQuinta Inn 

 and the car. They found the purchased merchandise, two weapons and items that had been 

 taken from Colas, placing the suspects at his home, Driskell said.

&quot;They were very specific, identifying items that without a doubt if you saw these items you 

 would say these belonged to professor Colas,&quot; Driskell said. &quot;They were items he either 

 had immediately around him or may have actually had on him. We don&apos;t know about that. 

 We never will know.&quot;

The four suspects know one another through a relative, and Reed and Holloway 

 were here working with a group that was selling magazines, Driskell said.

Police do not believe the suspects knew Colas but will be interviewing friends, 

 faculty and students of Colas&apos; to find any possible connection.

&quot;In my 30 years in law enforcement, I have not seen a more brutal coldblooded killing than 

 occurred at this residence at this time,&quot; said East Precinct Commander Bob Nash. &quot;And the 

 fact that they would go out and start purchasing things afterward is just abominable and 

 we&apos;re ashamed and disgusted by it. And this community should be too.&quot;

Police are also looking at the suspects in connection to other robberies in East Nashville 

 and across the city, Driskell said.

Police said more purchases may have been made, and ask that businesses look out for any 

 charges that may come through using Colas&apos; identification. If that has occurred, business 

 owners should contact police at 615-862-7525.

August 29, 2008
 Four persons believed responsible for Tuesday nights murder of Vanderbilt University Professor

 The three men appeared on surveillance video just three hours after the 9:20 p.m. murder 

 using Colas bank card to make purchases at several area businesses. 

 They drove away in a 1998 Buick Regal. These photos were distributed to officers Thursday night. 

 East Precinct Patrol Officer Ken Bray spotted the suspect car parked outside of Cody and 

 Hutchersons Sharpe Avenue home Friday at 3:45 a.m.

 Long story I am going to make short! NOT!

We had a young lady from a foreign Eastern Block country knock on our door trying to 
 sell us educational books and also looking for a place to live. Now I have 
 been in the business of coordinating high school exchange students for over a 
 decade, so when this gal came to my door with her very broken English 
 my heart went out to her.

When she began her sales pitch--broken English attempting to sell me American text books--
 I had to make her stop...it was painful to listen to. I knew immediately that she 
 had really no idea what she had gotten herself into. So I began to explain that in 
 America, our public school students received their books free from the schools---
 she had no idea about this...I asked her if people in HER country liked door-to-door 
 sales people, and she said--&quot;NO NO, BUT THE RECRUITERS TOLD ME THAT AMERICANS WERE 
 DIFFERENT AND DIDN&apos;T MIND THIS TYPE OF SALES.&quot; I asked her if she thought that was true...
 I must have hit a nerve because she let it all out! She told me about the lies she had been 
 fed by the recruiter as well as the 6 day cult like MLM training she had received with 
 hundreds of other foreign students in Nashville.

She told me about the schedule that these kids were told they MUST adhere to. Wake 
 up at exactly 5:59, take a ONE MINUTE COLD SHOWER, out the door and sell until 9:00 pm. 
 EVERY day except Sundays. On Sundays they were all told by their student managers that 
 they must go to a meeting, which was held at a different location every week. 
 At these meetings they performed what was called execs. These are cult like chants---
 running in circles, rhythmic hand clapping...below is an excerpt taken from this 
 site (http://www.gatorpressure.com/David/archives/000308.html) which details this 
 bizarre activity: &quot;Executive Exercises.

In the morning, we will do execs at our breakfast spots out in the parking lot or in a 
 nearby open area. We will do them in front of roads or highways, we will do them in 
 front of the restaurant&apos;s patrons, and on Sundays when we are at a hotel we will do 
 them in the hotel parking lot.

What are these &apos;execs?&apos;

Well, they start with someone mentioning execs. That person will usually then raise his 
 hand up in the air shout &quot;ohhhhhhh...hhhhh... Ohhhhhh...!&quot; indefinately while running 
 around in a large circle. Everyone else follows this person doing the same exact 
 thing until everyone is present in the circle.

At that point we will start skipping and singing a song. The song goes --
It&apos;s a great day to be a bookman.
It&apos;s a great day I know.
It&apos;s a great day to be a bookman everywhere I go.
Goodbye no-nevers, goodbye doubts and fears
It&apos;s a great day to be a bookman -- be of good cheer.
I feel happy. I feel terrific. I feel GREAT!

Then someone will yell out loud &quot;UH-OH!&quot; and we all will chime in &quot;Book Time!&quot; We all 
 sing/chant this in unison four times while doing a very specific rythmic clap that 
 took me a few tries to get down. (I still mess it up on the really sleepy mornings.) 
 After chanting that four to five times someone makes the conductor&apos;s sign for stop 
 and everyone goes silent.

After about three beats another iniative-taking (sic) individual will jump or dance into the 
 center of the circle and yell/scream out, &quot;Now let me see that funky chicken!&quot; at the top of 
 his voice, and everyone else will yell something like, &quot;What&apos;s that you said!?!
 This happens three times with slight variations each time based on the whims of the person in 
 the center of the circle. At the end He will say &quot;I said unh...&quot; and everyone in unison will 
 sing &quot;Oooo, ah ah ah oooo; ah ah ah oooo; ah ah ah oooo; one more time now!! Oooo, ah 
 ah ah oooo; ah ah ah oooo; ah ah ah oooo.&quot; Or whatever other chant, saying, or sounds 
 that go along with the particular thing that the initiator wanted to &quot;see.&quot;

The variations on this are numerous and growing. We come up with new stuff from time to time. 
 I come up with new stuff all the time, because I enjoy execs and I come up with stuff 
 that I think will be fun all the time. Most of the time the stuff I come up with 
 doesn&apos;t really pan out, but that is fine because every once and again I&apos;ll come up 
 with something really fun and even &quot;classic.&quot;

After doing that there are several other execs that we do. Some we only do in a large 
 group on Sundays, but most of the other ones are just thrown in as people remember them. 
 If no one remembers a particular exec it&apos;s fine -- it doesn&apos;t get done.

At the end of execs we do this thing where we all gather in a circle and get fired up and 
 then we all run off acting like birds, ostriches, video game charaters or bookmen...&quot;

THIS IS A CULT PEOPLE!

So, after hearing this and taking the time to go over the money this gal has made --
 $400.00 GROSS, she gets 40% of this...she worked 80 hours a week for 4 weeks...
 YOU DO THE MATH! However, the worst part of this, for the unfortunate foreign 
 students is they get here about $3000+ in debt! They pay for their own way here 
 (round trip), they pay about $600+ for visas and then they pay for the 6 day hotel 
 stay in Nashville to undergo an intensive brainwashing seminar...then they are 
 made to pay for a plane ticket to go to what ever city the company decided to send 
 them to. In this girls case it was half way across the country. She had $26.00 in her 
 pocket when she came to live with us!

I had a mission to look this company up on the internet. So many horrible experiences... 
 But it was just amazing to see how many people write about their wonderful experience 
 selling with this company! This type of Brainwashing, results in an unbelievable, long 
 term psychoses. These people actually believe that coercing individuals to by books, 
 using very persuasive, scripted sales tactics builds character and has helped them for 
 their future. In my book, this is really learning the art of lying, deceiving and and 
 making a buck on nice people who buy items they really don&apos;t need out of pity for the 
 sales person or getting totally bamboozled by a slick salesman! Every one of the items 
 the girl who came to my door had in her book bag were available online at a fraction of 
 what she was selling them for! &apos;MAKE THE SALE IN 20 MINUTES OR LEAVE! As I read through 
 their scripted sales &quot;BIBLE&quot; manual I was just disgusted at the different scripted sales 
 PITCHES these young people were told to memorize! When this gal came to my door, her 
 words were verbatim from page 45 of the sales manual...well at least those that I could 
 understand in her broken English!

To make matters worse, the Southwestern company tells these foreign kids that it doesn&apos;t 
 matter if you can speak English well, &quot;ALL THAT MATTERS IS YOUR ATTITUDE!&quot; GIVE ME A BREAK! 
 And through their 6 day, intensive brainwashing seminar, they actually cause these kids to 
 believe this lie!

Then there is the matter of housing. Some of these foreign kids have families who have 
 worked for the SW company host them. But this is very, VERY FEW! The girl who came to 
 my house was asked to leave by the older man who agreed to house her and another girl. 
 When I went to pick up her things from this man, it was a very CREEPY situation. 
 I can&apos;t put my finger on it, but when I left his house I had terrible uneasy 
 feeling in the pit of my stomach!

Shortly after this girl came to live with us, we found her another job...even though student 
 managers and people from SW made it very difficult for her...people who she thought were her 
 friends were now her enemies. Within 2 days, 4 other students found their way to my house 
 and asked for help to get out of this company and help to to secure housing and jobs.

It was hard to believe the type of life these foreign kids were living...but when I heard the 
 EXACT SAME STORY FROM ALL FIVE, it became appalling! Oh and did I mention the white 
 bracelets they HAD to wear, showing their commitment to this company!

All of them had these white bracelets...when you took this bracelet off you were no longer a 
 part of this company!

The kicker to all of this is that the Southwestern company makes them sign a contract--which 
 most do not understand---that states several places that they are NOT employees or agents of 
 this company....NOT EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS! And that they can run their company as independent 
 owners as they see fit. But still, they have been brainwashed into a way of thinking that to 
 be successful in this company they must adhere to the schedule! Yes the unwritten schedule! 
 These kids are told how to micro manage their lives on a minute by minute schedule. This is 
 pounded into their brains by the managers. All 5 of these kids have talked about &quot;KEEPING TO 
 THE SCHEDULE....KEEP TO THE SCHEDULE!&quot; This schedule starts at 5:59 and doesn&apos;t stop until 
 they get home and are schedule to contact their managers to report on the number of doors 
 they went to, number of demos they showed (should be 30 a day) how many sales they made--$-- 
 and what their plans are for the next day. This schedule, as precise as it is, is NOT written 
 down by ANY manager and given to these kids. WHY? Because that would be a paper trail showing 
 that this company controls these student&apos;s every move even though the contract they signed 
 explicitly states that they are NOT EMPLOYEES and are free to sell these materials anyway they choose!

CULT CULT CULT!

I am getting sick and tired of reading all the canned spam.... about how this job is not for 
 everyone....builds character, long hard hours.... Best experience of my life....And I made 
 lots of money taking advantage of people by selling them materials that were obviously over 
 priced and they didn&apos;t really need! Here (http://www.youbyte.com/images/SWC_price.jpg) is 
 a price breakdown for books taken directly from the j1 visa agreement on the Southwestern 
 Q&amp;A;page (http://www.southwestern.com/site/international/FAQ.aspx).

ANYONE with access to the internet can see that they are getting ripped off, buying over priced books! 
 Then there is the letter of Endorsement that this company makes these students parents or 
 friend or relative sign. This guarantees that if these kids don&apos;t send in the money they 
 receive for books, the signers of this letter of credit will pay this money for them! 
 My group of 5 student has had to spend this money to live as they were averaging less 
 than $1.50 a hour working 80 hours a week---EVEN FOLLOWING THE SCHEDULE! Attitude 
 is everything, who cares if you can barely speak English! I FEEL GREAT, I FEEL 
 AWESOME, I FEEL TERRIFIC!

Right? And the people who signed these contracts can not even speak or READ English, 
 but are convinced by their students that this is such a great opportunity for them 
 to come to America and make HUGE amounts of money...remember Americans are different, 
 we just love to buy things from door-to-door sales people!!!!

Ok folks, I really have to wonder with the motivation is behind this company. Really? 
 Why does this company recruit these kids from Eastern block countries...students that 
 barely speak the English language? What is the point? What is the agenda? I understand 
 that the students that came here previously make money on the ones that they recruit to 
 come again, but what is the big picture?

I am beginning to believe that it is a conspiracy to see just how far you can warp someone&apos;s 
 mind to make them believe an idea and to cause them (normal people) to do things they would 
 never consider doing....like EXECS! This psychoses carries on in some for years after they 
 have worked for this company. Look on line...it is like a mission...recruit, recruit, recruit.... 
 When I asked these kids why they actually took one minute COLD SHOWERS, they all replied, 
 &quot;Because they told us to!&quot;

I sincerely hope that if one of these young foreign students comes to YOUR door, 
 you will do everything in your power to help them escape!

Oh, and I forgot to mention one thing...the company that sponsors the j1 visa for these kids 
 is totally OWNED by the Southwestern company! It is NOT an independent j1 visa sponsor who 
 helps foreign students come to America to work for the summer at any j1 visa 
 appropriate job....it is a company owned by The Southwestern created specifically 
 to bring these foreign students to America to sell door-to-door. Can you say 
 conflict of interest!

&quot;IT WILL BE THE BEST EXPERIENCE OF YOUR LIFE!&quot;....as long as you don&apos;t get raped, mugged, 
 murdered, or commit suicide because you&apos;re scared, lonely...so far from home, 
 in a foreign country, can&apos;t speak the language...deeply in debt, with no money!

Important financial information for ANY FOREIGN STUDENT TO KNOW BEFORE WORKING FOR SOUTHWESTERN!

According to the company, in 2006 the average first-time sales program
 participant made a gross (before expenses) profit of $7944 over a
 four month summer. Site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Company)
80 hours a week, plus Sundays=88 hrs. wk
15 weeks of summer
1,320 work hours
Gross profit of $7,944.00
Net Profit $40%=$3,177.60
Hourly wage=$2.40
Minus $100 week living expensive=$1,677.60
Your take home is $1,677.60

Do not come to America and spend $3000+ dollars getting here only to be an indentured servant(SLAVE) 
 to the SouthWestern Company!

The numbers above are for average English speaking students. 
 Imagine how little you will make when you can&apos;t speak the language!

Post Script: As of the posting of the original text above on my personal website, 
 several more foreign students have contacted me regarding the horrible experience 
 they suffered with the Southwestern company.

 American Fork, Utah
Magazine Salesman Accused Of Raping Woman In Home
 August 27, 2008 
 Salesman accused of raping woman in home
By Steve Gehrke
The Salt Lake Tribune
Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated:08/27/2008 12:12:59 AM MDT
 A door-to-door salesman was in the Utah County jail on Tuesday after allegedly raping an 

 American Fork woman in her home. 

 Police believe Brian &quot;Chubbs&quot; Mask, 25, of East St. Louis, Ill., is a bona fide magazine salesman. 

 But while Mask was knocking on doors Monday evening, police say he attacked a 58-year-old woman 

 living alone in the northeast part of the city. 

 &quot;Part of his pitch was that he needed this woman&apos;s name on paper to indicate that he had talked 

 to her,&quot; said Sgt. Gregg Ludlow. &quot;Once he was inside, there was a struggle. He subdued her, 

 drugged her and took her into a back bedroom where he sexually assaulted her.&quot; 

 During the sexual assault, Mask allegedly held the woman by the throat, according 

 to a probable-cause statement filed in 4th District Court. When the woman struggled 

 to get away, Mask began punching her in the face, splitting open her face and knocking 

 her unconscious. 

 &quot;It is believed the suspect left the unconscious victim for dead,&quot; the probable-cause statement says. 

 The woman was transported to American Fork Hospital, where doctors treated her for an injured 

 mouth and teeth, and stitched up her face. 

 Police later found other neighborhood residents who had seen a salesman and had conversations with him. 

 One of those neighbors was Jamie Reece, who told The Salt Lake Tribune that Mask came to her 

 door and acted strangely. She said Mask told her that he had been selected for an internship 

 with the British Broadcasting Corporation and needed to practice public speaking. 

 Mask also told Reece that he needed to do certain activities with people to earn &quot;points.&quot; 

 He pulled out a chart that specified finding a ladybug, which would net him 40 points, 

 and &quot;hot rodding&quot; in the street. 

 The man at one point asked Reece if she liked chicken. 

 When she replied that she did, he tried to link arms with her and began doing what 

 she described as a &quot;chicken dance.&quot; 

 Reece eventually asked Mask what he wanted, and he said he was selling magazines and books. 

 She asked him to leave and said he sounded offended and asked what he did wrong. 

 He then told her he wanted to get into her garage so he could find some things to sell. 

 When Reece again told Mask to leave, he did. She said that early on in their encounter, 

 the 6-foot-2, 275-pound man made her nervous. 

 &quot;I had a really bad feeling about him,&quot; she said. &quot;After I talked to him about one minute, 

 I started having the thought that if he were to attack me, I couldn&apos;t fight him off.&quot; 

 The woman who was attacked lived just a couple of houses from Reece. 

 After police issued a countywide call, Lehi police arrested Mask at a bus station. 

 During questioning by American Fork police, Mask allegedly admitted hitting and 

 choking the woman, but denied any sexual assault, according to the probable-cause statement. 

 Mask was booked into the Utah County jail.

Magazine salesman arrested for allegedly raping woman

 Magazine salesman arrested for allegedly raping woman
August 26th, 2008 @ 5:03pm
By Randall Jeppesen and Courtney Orton
5 KLS TV
 An American Fork woman has been released from the hospital after police say 

 she was brutally beaten by a door-to-door magazine salesman. The woman was one of a 

 dozen residents who had contact with this salesman yesterday. Many of them say the 

 salesman acted weird and made them uncomfortable.

Yesterday 25-year-old Brian James Mask was going door-to-door in an American Fork neighborhood. 

 Jean Whaley, who lives in the neighborhood, said, &quot;He was trying to sell magazines or 

 something for points.&quot; He knocked on Whaley&apos;s door just after 6 p.m. &quot;I just said, &apos;I&apos;m not interested,&apos; 

 went back in and shut the door,&quot; she said.

Shortly after, he knocked on her neighbor&apos;s door. American Fork police Sgt. Gregg 

 Ludlow says the man invited himself into the home of the 58-year-old woman 

 when she went to sign a paper. Ludlow says the suspect then physically and sexually assaulted her. 

 &quot;We believe she was pretty much left for dead,&quot; Ludlow says.

Her attacker got away while she struggled to call for help. &quot;She&apos;s suffered some pretty severe trauma. 

 This is a fine lady that just did not deserve to have this happen to her,&quot; Chief Lance Call, 

 with the American Fork Police Department, said.

Police interviewed people in the neighborhood to see if anyone had seen Mask before. 

 Jamie Reece says she remembers the salesman. She says he was pushy and kept trying to touch her. 

 Reece said, &quot;He said, I&apos;m going to need to go into the garage.&apos; And I said no. And he said, 

 I mean to find something to sell.&apos;&quot; She was not harmed.

Less than an hour after the attack, police caught Mask. &quot;We got some help from Lehi police, 

 who observed him getting on a bus trying to get back to Salt Lake. They stopped the bus and 

 took him into custody,&quot; Call said.

That&apos;s good news for the dozens of residents who opened their doors to the 

 salesman yesterday, but many of them won&apos;t be opening their doors to strangers in the future.

&quot;Never ever let someone into your home you don&apos;t know. The risk is just too high,&quot; Call said.

Whaley said, &quot;I&apos;m going to put a no-solicitors sign on my door.&quot;

Mask is from St. Louis. He works for an out-of-state company that sells magazine subscriptions. 

 The company didn&apos;t have a solicitors license that American Fork requires for such work, 

 so Mask was going door-to-door illegally. He&apos;s now in the Utah County jail.

 Police warn residents in Easthampton, Southampton and Northampton

Tuesday, August 26, 2008
 Police are warning residents to watch out for a group of young people going door-to-door 

 fraudulently asking for money. 

 Easthampton, Southampton and Northampton police said they received a number of reports late 

 last week and over the weekend of people soliciting money for causes that do not exist. 

 &quot;We tell people if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is and don&apos;t get involved,&quot; 

 Easthampton Police Chief Bruce W. McMahon said. 

 Southampton police issued a press release saying that numerous reports were received about a group 

 soliciting in a neighborhood off Pomeroy Meadow Road on Friday. They fled when police arrived on the scene. 

 In Southampton, a group of young people, saying they were affiliated with Mag-Crew 

 Dynasty Sales LLC, claimed they were University of Massachusetts students selling magazines 

 to raise money for trips, police said. Others said they were raising money to provide 

 books for sick children in a Philadelphia area hospital. 

 &quot;The group was using a ploy that they were connected to the area and said that relatives 

 lived in the area and identified streets the relatives were supposed to live on,&quot; police 

 said in the press release. 

 In Southampton, any non-profit organization soliciting in town must be registered with police. 

 In Easthampton, McMahon said that solicitors did not appear to have much success, although police 

 got a few calls from residents.

Monday, August 25, 2008
 WALES Police arrested five people who they say were selling magazines in town illegally 

 yesterday and are warning residents to be wary of door-to-door salesmen. 

 Chief Dawn M. Charette said Officer Lee B. Collins was on patrol yesterday afternoon 

 when he saw a vehicle with temporary license plates from the state of Kentucky. 

 He stopped the car and found the people inside had been peddling magazines door-to-door 

 without a permit from the chief of police. 

 The driver, Ezel R. Jones, 34, of Virginia, does not have a valid license and was wanted on a 

 warrant for burglary in Washington state, the chief said. 

 Chief Charette said she is concerned that some residents gave the group cash or 

 checks and asked anyone who has questions to call Wales police at (413) 245-7844. 

 Those arrested on a charge of selling goods or periodicals without a permit from the chief of 

 police are: Victor G.L. Allbrighton, 18, of Florida, Christin N. Hill, 18, of West Virginia, 

 Tristan J. Leonard, 23, of New Jersey and Joseph G. Wilson, 21, of North Carolina. Mr. Jones 

 was charged with driving after his license was suspended and selling without a permit. 

 All five were released on personal recognizance after paying a $40 clerks fee. 

 They will be arraigned in Palmer District Court today. TELEGRAM&amp;GAZETTE STAFF

 of younger people, often with troubled lives, recruited to sell 

 magazines across the country.

Olivia Helmig was in a magazine crew for 10 months. During that 

 time, she had no medical care, witnessed abuse and heard stories

 Consumer Affairs Warns About Door-to-Door Scams
By Heather Sullivan

Published: August 19, 2008
 Be careful who you open your door and your wallet for. The 

 Spartanburg Boys and Girls Club says theyre being used, again, by 

 magazine subscription sellers. And the State Department of 

 Consumer Affairs is warning you about a door-to-door book selling 

 scam. 

 Boys and Girls Club President Greg Tolbert says hes received a 

 complaint that someone is selling magazines door to door, using the 

 boys and girls club name. Said Tolbert, They have a hard luck story 

 about their own life, and how theyre trying to give back to the 

 community, and raise money for these worthy causes, and using 

 names of various charities, including ours. 

 But Tolbert says theres no such fundraiser. Spartanburg Public 

 Safety says they have questioned the magazine sellers but have not 

 been able to verify if they are using the Boys and Girls Club name. 

 Officers say the sellers have been operating without a city permit. 

 Tolbert says the same problem happened a couple of months ago 

 and a few years ago. In 2004, News Channel 7 reported that a 

 company working out of a hotel room admitted using the Boys and 

 Girls Club name while selling magazines. The Better Business 

 Bureau says that company has since shut down. 

 Meantime, the Department of Consumer Affairs issued a warning 

 about a door-to-door book selling scam hitting South Carolina. 

 Officials say as the scam artist go from door to door, theyre learning 

 all of your neighbors names. By the time they get to your door, 

 theyre mentioning those names to make it sound like they are 

 legitimate. 

 A victim reported paying $50 for books that never arrived. And its a 

 growing problem. Said Maria Audus, with the Department of 

 Consumer Affairs, Weve been hearing more in the last 6 to 8 

 months about magazine and book scams. 

 How can you protect yourself for door to door scams? Dont do 

 business on the spot, ask for printed materials and check out the 

 company first, never pay in cash, and never make a payment in the 

 salespersons name. By Heather Sullivan

 Beware of teens selling magazines!

Tuesday, August 19, 2008
 In case anyone out there doesn&apos;t know this yet, do not buy 

 magazines from the kids who come door-to-door selling 

 subscriptions. They&apos;ll get into this whole very charming spiel about 

 how they&apos;re earning &quot;points&quot; to buy books for college, and they&apos;re 

 there to learn better communication skills and be inspired by people 

 in the community.

 But they&apos;re there to sell magazine subscriptions (that may or may not 

 ever arrive) at inflated prices, NOT for any charity or college fund, but 

 as a for-profit venture in an extremely seedy industry.You are not 

 helping these &quot;sweet&quot; kids by buying into their lies.

 You&apos;re perpetuating the problem. So don&apos;t feel at all guilty about 

 saying no, closing the door, and calling the police to ask if the crew 

 has a permit to solicit in the area.

 The kids who just came to my door (all adorable wide-eyed smiles 

 when trying to hook me, and abusive and cursing when I politely 

 turned them down) were from American Community Services, Inc., 

 but there are many such organizations that function like gangs and 

 ensnare kids into a truly horrible lifestyle.Some links:

Door to door: big bucks or bust?

 Door to door: big bucks or bust?
Book company recruits college students for long days away from home
Melissa Caron, The Charlotte Observer
 Knocking on doors thousands of miles from home for 80 hours a week might not be a typical summer 

 for a college student. But 22-year-old Kyle Stantus says the long hours and the three days drive 

 from his home in Arizona are worth it.

Six days a week, he spends his days going door to door in the Monroe area selling books for 

 Nashville-based Southwestern Co.

The possibility of making more than $8,500 in a summer -- as Southwestern boasts in promotional material -- 

 has attracted more than 2,700 college students into its ranks this summer. Nearly 40 students from 

 Arizona and New Mexico are selling for Southwestern in the Charlotte area, with another 15 in Raleigh. 

 About 55 students from UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State University are peddling west of the Mississippi 

 River this summer.

Praise and criticism for the 150-year-old, privately-held company can run the gamut. Sellers 

 such as Stantus laud the discipline the Southwestern program gives them or how it helps them 

 pay college costs.

&quot;It&apos;s great money,&quot; said Stantus in his second summer of selling. &quot;Nothing in life ever comes easy.&quot;

But some former sellers criticize the long hours and disavow the company&apos;s claim 

 that students make an average of $8,500 a summer selling academic study guides.

Some states have tried to pass laws aimed at the direct selling industry in general that 

 would prevent Southwestern from operating under its business model of hiring people as 

 independent contractors.

Students buy the study guides from Southwestern, which is the main publisher of the materials. 

 Students then sell the books at retail, keeping the profit -- which can be as much as a 40 percent, 

 said Southwestern spokesman Trey Campbell.

As independent contractors, sellers do not receive an hourly wage, which can leave some with 

 nothing if they are unable to make a sale. With three out of 10 first-year sellers quitting, the 

 program isn&apos;t for everyone, Campbell said.

Quily Ho, 19, left the program this summer after selling books for two weeks in Georgetown, Ky., 

 and working 14 hours day.

&quot;I didn&apos;t last very long,&quot; said Ho, a student at the University of Texas at Austin. &quot;I think 

 I kind of overestimated myself.&quot;

Without a car, Ho was dropped off in the morning by another seller and was picked up at 

 night after walking for more than 12 hours. Sunburnt and having made one sale for the summer, 

 he said everything finally brought him down. He turned over his one sale to another 

 seller and flew home on a plane ticket he hadn&apos;t used for his brother&apos;s graduation in May.

He estimates he&apos;s out more than $380 from travel and living expenses for the summer.

In the end, he said it came down to not having the right mindset. &quot;Since everyone in the 

 organization is doing the same thing, everyone is motivated,&quot; Ho said. &quot;If everyone else 

 is doing it and you are not, it&apos;s awkward.&quot;

 Restriction rejected 

While North Carolina hasn&apos;t restricted companies such as Southwestern, Wisconsin 

 legislators recently tried to require direct sellers to designate peddlers as employees. 

 This would have held companies responsible for the actions of sellers and put them under 

 laws governing 40-hour workweeks.

Campbell said Southwestern opposed the bill because it would have disrupted its business model 

 and prevented students from operating as their own businesses -- a benefit that many students like. 

 The measure failed.

&quot;We are set up to provide training and products,&quot; he said. &quot;Not to have 3,000 employees.&quot;

The door-to-door industry received some attention in the Charlotte area five years ago when a 

 man sexually assaulted and killed 18-year-old Jin-Joo Byrne of Seattle, 

 who stopped by his apartment soliciting money for the Unification Church.

Safety is always on the minds of Southwestern sellers, said Monique Flores, a 24-year-old seller 

 from Arizona. She said she uses census and poverty data to determine an area&apos;s safety.

&quot;Nobody ever works (in areas that are) past the poverty line,&quot; said Flores, who is selling in 

 Concord this summer. &quot;Nobody would work in a place that has $40,000 or less annual income per household.&quot;

Campbell said the students sell in areas where crime levels are lower than on their campuses, 

 although there is no direct formula for determining this. He adds that students 

 typically have their cell phones with them and they are just a 911 call away.

Students generally sell outside their home state to cut distractions. 

 There are nearly 80 sellers in the Carolinas this summer, Campbell said. 

 There more than 70 students from colleges in the Carolinas working west of the Mississippi River.

The company depends on the enthusiasm of sellers like Stantus. 

 A student at Arizona State University, he was one of the top first-year sellers last year. 

 He says he made more than the $8,500 average but wouldn&apos;t give an exact figure.

He admits the summer is tough, with workdays averaging 12-14 hours and rejection happening more 

 often than sales.

 Starting with lively breakfast 

Every morning he wakes up before 7 at the home of a host family arranged by the company and 

 meets with two other sellers at the Village Grille in Monroe. Over breakfast, they plot out the 

 day -- analyzing worn maps, drawing out targeted streets on legal pads and getting order forms ready.

Stantus, in a morning ritual, reads aloud a passage from &quot;The Greatest Salesman in the World&quot; 

 by the late sales guru Og Mandino.

&quot; &apos;I will sell more goods than ever before,&apos; &quot; Stantus said. &quot;&apos; I will earn more gold 

 than ever before. I will live this day as if it is my last, and, if not, I shall fall to 

 my knees and give thanks.&apos; That&apos;s pretty good.&quot;

Stantus says goodbye to his fellow peddlers and heads out for a day of driving and 

 knocking on strangers&apos; doors. Homeowners are sometimes angry, and there are occasional 

 encounters with pets. He was once chased by a peacock.

He tries to stay positive. He often turns to the daily passage by Mandino and says he 

 focuses on the present to keep his spirits up.

&quot;If you are able to see the most prospects with the best attitude, you will 

 probably be the most successful,&quot; Stantus said. &quot;But that&apos;s obviously a lot harder said than done.&quot; Melissa Caron, The Charlotte Observer

 Strange Questions Update

Story Updated: Aug 15, 2008 at 7:44 PM MDT
 BILLINGS There is new information on a story on local parents concerned about a 

 stranger going door to door asking questions about children.

 KULR-8 has tracked down the company likely responsible, that claims to have done business for 

 nearly 150 years. Southwestern Company hires college students to sell children&apos;s books and 

 educational software.

 Students are trained in Tennessee and many come from other countries. 

 A company spokesman says it&apos;s not the first time the students have caused 

 concerns, especially since they ask neighbors for referrals.

 Trey Campbell with the company says, &quot;We really love being able to send students 

 to communities that does have concerns like this when there is a stranger in the 

 community and they bring it to the attention of the proper authorities because 

 that is a real indicator of a safe community.&quot;

 Campbell says many of the students carry hand written maps because they are not 

 familiar with the neighborhood. He says it also helps them keep track of their sales.

Magazine Salesman Arrested On Outstanding Warrants 
 August 14, 2008 
 Magazine Solicitation Leads To Arrest
The Sag Harbor Express
Posted on 14 August 2008
 Two men soliciting Sag Harbor residents for money for college on Tuesday, August 5 prompted one 

 Madison Street woman to call Sag Harbor Police. Ultimately the call led to the arrest of one of the 

 two men on outstanding warrants for felony assault, three counts of burglary, vandalism and theft. 

 According to police, the men were a part of a magazine sales crew.

 During August of last year a number of Sag Harbor residents called police after receiving 

 visits at their homes from salespersons from Jaguar Sales LLC, although it is not known if 

 these two men are from the same outfit. Jaguar Sales is a magazine and book selling company 

 out of Washington State that New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo filed suit against last 

 summer for illegally recruiting and deceiving young workers into selling magazine subscriptions 

 door-to-door without compensation.

 After police responded to the Madison Street neighborhood, they found two men in the area 

 fitting the residents description. After interviewing the subjects, police said they discovered 

 that Michael J. Garrett, 22, of Corning, Ohio had a number of outstanding charges 

 pending against him out of the Morgan County Sheriffs Office in McConnelsville, Ohio. 

 Sag Harbor Village Police held Garrett until Suffolk County police fugitive squad 

 was able to pick him up for extradition. The second man, a Goodyear, Arizona resident was released. The Sag Harbor Express

Story Updated: Aug 13, 2008 at 6:23 PM MDT
 BILLINGS - Imagine this, you&apos;re home on a Friday afternoon and someone knocks on your door. 

 When you open, it a stranger is standing there and asks to see your kids.

 Mike Craighill of Billings said this happened to him. He said the stranger went on to explain 

 that he was a foreign exchange student studying kids. &quot;There was no chance he was getting in 

 the house,&quot; Craighill said. Craighill started to close the door, but the man had one more question. 

 &quot;He asked if I could help him with his map,&quot; Craighill said.

 Being a good guy, mike decided to help because he thought the stranger might be having 

 trouble with the local language, but that wasn&apos;t the case. &quot;He had a handwritten map that 

 had a bunch of houses on it,&quot; Craighill said. &quot;He asked me what houses had children and I said, 

 &apos;not a chance.&apos;&quot; Mike was talking to his sister later that week and found that one of her 

 friends had a similar story.

 Elizabeth Krivitz was on her way to work one day when she received a strange phone call. 

 The man on the other end wanted to talk to her about her kids. We called the number back 

 and reached an insurance agent who said the company is offering free DNA sample kits to 

 parents in the area. Krivitz said the way he went about it was a bit disturbing.

 &quot;Nothing felt good about the whole situation,&quot; she said. &quot;My stomach started turning.&quot; 

 Sergeant Kevin Iffland with the Billings Police Department said that feeling should 

 prompt you to call the police.

 &quot;If you get that gut feeling that, hey, this just doesn&apos;t sound right that&apos;s why we&apos;re here,&quot; 

 he said. Sergeant Iffland confirm that there was an insurance company in town going door 

 to door and that these cases could be related to that.

 Whether the threat was real or not, Krivitz said the experience completely changed they way 

 she thinks about parenting. &quot;My son, who before it was cute if he answered the phone, now 

 he&apos;s not allowed to answer the phone at all. At all. No matter what,&quot; She said.

 Though the phone call has been explained, we&apos;re still not certain that the man who knocked 

 on Craighill&apos;s door was with that agency. Sergeant Iffland said if something feels 

 even the slightest but wrong to you, try to get as many details as you can about 

 the people and vehicles involved, then don&apos;t hesitate to call the police. By Sarah Gravlee

Pratt area residents are warned to be on the alert for people selling magazine subscriptions 

 door-to-door for Atlantic Circulation Inc. of York, Penn. 

 The Pratt Police Department has received numerous complaints about this company, 

 said Pratt Police Chief Steve Holmes. 

 The complaints include failure to register with the city for permission to solicit sales within Pratt, 

 suspicious and deceptive activity and potential fraud related to individuals taking money from 

 customers with no intent of providing the product the customers paid for, Holmes said. 

 Anyone who has purchased magazines from Atlantic Circulation should contact the Pratt Police 

 Department at 672-5551. 

 Individuals in the group were contacted and many were deceptive about their activities. 

 They were detained for soliciting sales without a permit. Information was taken from 11 

 suspects and a large number of sales receipts, personal checks and cash were taken as evidence, 

 Holmes said.

 Several suspects had active warrants in other states that refused to extradite because of 

 distance. One warrant was for the same type of solicitation in another state, 

 one person was a convicted felon and several had suspended drivers licenses. 

 The police department has requested contact from a company representative but no one has called. 

 The Pratt Police Department warns all residents to be alert for this type of activity. 

 We would like all citizens to be wary of unsolicited door-to-door sales people, Holmes said.

 Bedford, New York
Door-to-Door Magazine Sales Warning !!!
Magazine Sales Company:
Prestige Sales USA
 August 11, 2008 
 Bedford warns about door-to-door solicitors
Chris Serico
The Journal News
August 11, 2008
 BEDFORD - Responding to four reports of solicitation, town officials are warning residents to be 

 diligent with salespeople who solicit door-to-door and by telephone.

 A 21-year-old Illinois man was charged last week with soliciting without a permit, 

 which in Bedford is a misdemeanor. Police responded at 8:38 p.m. Monday to a report from a Barker 

 Street resident, who reported suspicious activity. Following the report, police arrested 

 Christopher Gibson of Calumet City, Ill. He is scheduled to appear Aug. 21 in Town Court.

 About an hour after the first solicitation report, police responded to a Bishop Road resident&apos;s 

 complaint about a door-to-door magazine salesman identifying himself as an employee of Prestige 

 Sales USA. Police had difficulty investigating that incident, said Lt. Robert Mazurak, 

 because that resident, who reportedly paid for some magazines, waited to report the matter.

 &quot;By the time we heard about this, the (suspect) was gone,&quot; he said.

 It was unclear if the two solicitation reports were related, he said.

 A Missouri woman working for Prestige Sales USA was charged last month with second-degree 

 menacing in Rockland County.

 Jolesa Pitts, 20, of Springfield, Mo., was arrested at the Holiday Inn in Montebello the 

 morning of July 17 and charged with the misdemeanor after a co-worker claimed she threatened 

 her with a knife.

 On Wednesday night, Bedford police encountered another solicitor on Lakeside Drive, 

 who Mazurak said had a permit, and relayed a fourth solicitation complaint in Lewisboro to state police.

 &quot;The word that we&apos;re trying to get out is just be careful of who you&apos;re doing business with, 

 especially door-to-door people,&quot; Mazurak said.

 Via Bedford&apos;s e-mail alert system, the town last week warned residents about illegal solicitors.

 &quot;There are certainly legitimate businesses and charities that go door-to-door, but also plenty 

 of scams,&quot; reads part of the message.

 Mazurak said solicitation complaints peak in summer months.

 &quot;What we&apos;re trying to do is just protect people and make sure that they don&apos;t become victims of 

 crime by having these people come in and maybe pick something up that doesn&apos;t belong to them,&quot; he said, 

 &quot;or maybe get scammed out of their money.&quot;

 The town e-mail instructed residents to demand identification from door-to-door salespeople 

 and warned them not to invite peddlers into their homes.

 According to Chapter 88 of the town code, it is illegal to &quot;engage in itinerant trading, 

 hawking and peddling or making a sale by sample and taking orders ... in or upon the public 

 highways or public places of the Town or upon private property, by calls from house to house, 

 without obtaining a license as herein provided.&quot;

 Licenses are required for peddling salespeople, &quot;regardless of whether or not he or she is 

 affiliated with a company,&quot; the code reads.

 Police encouraged residents who are concerned about a door-to-door solicitor to call the 

 department at 914-241-3111. Chris Serico

 Magazine 1st-half newsstand sales drop 6.3 percent
Associated Press
New York
08/11/08
 NEW YORK (AP) Newsstand sales of U.S. magazines fell 6.3 percent in the first half of 2008, 

 an industry group said Monday, as rising gas and food costs led consumers to cut back on 

 nonessential spending.

 Most top titles, including best-selling Cosmopolitan and O, The Oprah Magazine, 

 had sharp declines. Of the top 10 sellers, only People, the entertainment news magazine, 

 and In Style posted gains.

 Overall magazine circulation, which includes subscription and newsstand sales, 

 was flat at 349.9 million copies in the period, as paid subscriptions edged higher to 

 290.2 million copies, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported.

 Single-copy magazine sales in the six months ended June 30 fell to 44.1 million copies 

 from 47.1 million a year ago. The survey included 467 titles that reported results in both periods.

 Publishers redouble efforts to sign up subscribers during economic slowdowns because 

 they know newsstand sales will ebb, which they need to offset because advertising 

 rates are based on minimum circulation targets.

 Newsstand sales are far more lucrative than subscriptions, though, meaning circulation 

 revenue is dropping at most titles.

 Like newspapers, magazines have been struggling with declining advertising revenue as 

 readers increasingly go online for news and entertainment. In the second quarter, 

 magazines had 8.2 percent fewer ad pages, the Publishers Information Bureau reported.

 Hearst Corp.&apos;s Cosmopolitan magazine, the top-seller on the country&apos;s newsstands, 

 had a 6 percent decline to 1.75 million copies nearly 114,000 fewer magazines. 

 Top 10 sellers In Touch Weekly, US Weekly, Woman&apos;s World and O, The Oprah Magazine 

 each posted a double-digit decline in newsstand sales.

 People, published by Time Inc., boosted newsstand sales by 5.2 percent and 

 remained the No. 2 best-selling magazine at kiosks around the country. In 

 Style was also able to increase newsstand sales. Associated Press

 2 more magazine solicitors arrested, fined
By Steve Lieberman
The Journal News August 9, 2008
 STONY POINT - Two out-of-state magazine solicitors have been fined $50 each for 

 violating a town law banning door-to-door sales without a permit, authorities 

 said yesterday.

 The two arrests brought to at least six the number of solicitors arrested 

 across Rockland since late May. Two of those arrested were charged with 

 violent crimes.

 Stony Point police arrested Robert A. Buxton, 19, of Linden, Texas, and 

 Shane H. Doverspike, 27, of Polk, Pa., on Wednesday along De Halve 

 Maen Drive, Lt. Brian Moore said yesterday.

 A resident called police about two men going door to door.

 Each man was charged with soliciting without a permit and released on $50 bail, 

 Moore said. They were contractors for The Experience Company of Arizona, he said.

 Buxton and Doverspike pleaded guilty Thursday to the violation and Justice 

 William Franks fined them $50 each, according to Stony Point Town Court.

 Door-to-door solicitors hit Rockland usually during late spring. 

 They are mostly young people, ranging from age 18 to early 20s, traveling 

 the country for magazine sales companies.

 The sellers live in motels under the control of company handlers who drop 

 them off by van in neighborhoods to sell door to door.

 Critics say the world of selling magazines door to door can be exploitative, 

 illegal and, at times, dangerous. Sellers often are paid a pittance based on 

 sales, and handlers hold their earnings.

 Sellers can&apos;t pick up and leave because they are working hundreds, 

 if not thousands, of miles from home and cannot afford a bus or train ticket home.

 Company officials deny most of the negative charges and say they are 

 offering young people with problems an opportunity to learn a business and 

 become responsible.

 While some sellers have been involved in violence across the country, 

 most arrests in Rockland through the years have involved lacking a peddler&apos;s license.

 Since May, two solicitors have been arrested on charges involving violence. 

 Four others, including Buxton and Doverspike, were charged with soliciting 

 without a permit.

 Ramapo police arrested Donnell Preston, 28, of Dayton, Ohio, May 27 on 

 felony charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree burglary.

 Preston is accused of attacking a 25-year-old woman at the Holiday Inn 

 in Montebello, where the magazine solicitors were staying.

 Preston and the woman have two children together, police said. They both 

 worked for the Tennessee-based Paragon Sales, police said.

 Preston remains in the county jail without bail pending trial.

 On July 17, Jolesa Pitts, 20, of Springfield, Mo., was arrested on a 

 misdemeanor count of second-degree menacing. She is accused of threatening 

 another solicitor staying at the Holiday Inn, police said.

 Both women are employed by Prestige Sales USA of Phoenix, police said. 

 The case is pending.

Burglary, Conspiracy To Commit Forgery, Theft

 Woman arrested after escaping Bremer jail
By JOSH NELSON, Courier Staff Writer
WCFCourier.com
Thursday, August 7, 2008 12:09 PM CDT
 WAVERLY --- Authorities arrested a Hardin County woman in Iowa Falls on 

 Tuesday after she allegedly escaped from the Bremer County Jail.

 Officers found Ashley Benson, 19, of Iowa Falls, at about 3 p.m. in a house at 

 201 W. First St., Iowa Falls Police Chief Ron Kuhfus said.

 Kuhfus said the Bremer County Sheriff&apos;s Department alerted his department to 

 Benson&apos;s location after the sheriff&apos;s office received a separate call tipping them 

 off.

 Benson escaped from the jail less than 24 hours earlier, Bremer County Sheriff 

 Dewey Hildebrandt said today.

 Benson was being held in a work-release area of the jail in Waverly since she 

 was the only female inmate. The area normally used to house women was being 

 used for inmates accused of sex-related crimes, Hildebrandt said.

 She escaped after accidentally being locked in an area where inmates are 

 searched after coming back from work-release. At the time, she was eating, 

 Hildebrandt said.

 According to the sheriff, staff members didn&apos;t make sure Benson went back to 

 her holding area after the meal. Benson slipped out of the jail when a detention 

 officer went outside to have a cigarette, Hildebrandt said.

 &quot;It was totally my staff&apos;s fault,&quot; he said.

 Hildebrandt said the staff members were reprimanded and actions were taken 

 to rectify the situation.

 Benson was charged July 24 with second-degree burglary, conspiracy to 

 commit forgery and fifth-degree theft.

 She and a man allegedly stole debit and credit cards while selling magazines 

 door to door.

 Penn Hills, Pennsylvania
Magazine Sales Scam !!!
 August 7, 2008 
 Magazine Subscription Service May Not Deliver
Reporting Yvonne Zanos
KDKA CBS 2
Aug 7, 2008 8:55 pm US/Eastern
 PENN HILLS (KDKA) They come around every summer - vans 

 full of young people selling magazines - but do they deliver? 

 There&apos;s a group working Penn Hills right now, but at any given time, there are 

 hundreds of sales crews traveling the country, often in beat up vans full of young 

 people. 

 Danyel Campalong of Penn Hills has a no solicitations sign on her front door but 

 that didn&apos;t keep the sales kids away from her home. 

 Although Danyel says she usually doesn&apos;t talk to salespeople at her door, &quot;She 

 was a young girl, very cute, clean cut, very chatty and very friendly - it is hard to 

 say no to someone like that.&quot; 

 Danyel says the girl told her she was from Texas, working for a Colorado-based 

 company called, &quot;Face to Face Technologies.&quot; She claimed to be earning 

 money, in part, for the American Diabetes Association and in part for a special 

 trip. 

 Because Danyel has a three-year-old daughter, she ordered a subscription to 

 Highlights.

 Danyel wrote a check for $57 - $42 for a two-year subscription to the magazine 

 and $15 for a processing fee - but after the deal was done she had some doubt. 

 &quot;I didn&apos;t feel right about it,&quot; said Danyel. &quot;She didn&apos;t show me any identification. 

 Normally people have a tag around their neck with a photo ID.&quot; 

 Danyel sat down at her computer and looked up a consumer complaint website 

 called the Ripoff Report. She found scores of angry consumers all over the 

 country claiming they never got their magazines and accusing the company of 

 misrepresentation. Danyel immediately canceled her subscription and her 

 check. 

 &quot;I called to make sure they received my cancelation,&quot; said Danyel. &quot;The woman 

 who answered said it was a good thing I canceled because it wasn&apos;t even a 

 magazine they sold anymore.&quot; 

 On a scale of A to F, the Better Business Bureau gives the company a D-minus 

 because of multiple complaints of billing, collection and delivery problems. 

 There&apos;s another problem. These young people have no business coming to your 

 door, at least not in Penn Hills, where door-to-door sales are prohibited unless 

 you have a door-to-door solicitation permit which &quot;Face to Face Technologies&quot; 

 failed to get. 

 Danyel spent $32 canceling her check. She is going to cancel her checking 

 account and open a new one because she doesn&apos;t want this company having 

 access to the money in her account. 

 &quot;I really did think I was helping someone and they were just scamming me,&quot; said 

 Danyel. 

 Some people get their magazines, some people don&apos;t. We did confirm that none 

 of Danyel&apos;s money would have gone to the American Diabetes Association. 

 Bottomline: Be skeptical. These sales crews are not all what they seem. Reporting Yvonne Zanos

 Door To Door Scam In Clearfield County
Reported by: Erin Calandra
WTAJ-TV
Thursday, Aug 7, 2008 @05:39pm EST
 The DuBois police say they&apos;ve been getting calls from people all over the area 

 this week reporting people who are knocking on their doors trying to sell 

 magazines.

 Victims say they look and sound legitimate, but they&apos;re not.

 The police say there may be a group of men going door to door in the Clearfield 

 County claiming to sell magazines.

 They&apos;re young, clean cut, and looking for you money.

 One witness says the young man at his door didn&apos;t seem suspicious. He said he 

 was selling the magazines to pay for college. 

 That&apos;s when the DuBois City Police pulled up to the house.

 The police say the solicitor didnt have proper identification or a permit for 

 solicitation.

 They took him into custody, finger printed him, and found out he is a convicted 

 felon from Florida.

 The police have been getting calls from Brookville to Sandy Township, and 

 everywhere in between from people reporting the suspected con artists.

 Police say there is at least on victim in Sandy Township who paid a man with 

 cash.

 Now they&apos;re warning everyone to be aware of their scam.

 If anyone knocks on your door trying to sell you something and they don&apos;t have a 

 permit call the police right away. Reported by: Erin Calandra

 Residents fear scams operating in area
Chancellor West residents concerned about suspected scam
BY ELLEN BILTZ
The Free Lance-Star
Date published: 8/7/2008
 Margie Grant thought something was fishy when a young man came to her door last week asking 

 for donations for his baseball team to go to Tokyo.

 And she wasn&apos;t the only resident of the Chancellor West neighborhood in Spotsylvania County 

 who thought something was strange about the fundraising effort.

 &quot;Jason,&quot; who appeared to be in his teens or early 20s, has been traveling through the 

 neighborhood collecting money, sometimes saying he is selling books, other times just asking 

 for donations, according to residents.

&apos;HE WAS VERY SMOOTH&apos;

&quot;He&apos;s attractive and preppy with his khaki shorts and hat,&quot; Grant said. &quot;He was a nice-looking guy.&quot;

 Grant said she didn&apos;t give the man any money, though, because he couldn&apos;t produce 

 information to give her about his company.

 &quot;He just had these cards with children&apos;s books on them,&quot; she said.

 The &quot;company&quot; the teen claimed to work for is Tuscan Reader Services, a documented scam 

 company on Web sites like ripoffreport .com.

 It is the same company 20-year-old Tasha Mitchell used as a front last year when she 

 pulled a scam going door to door in the Fawn Lake area, posing as a high school cheerleader.

 Mitchell pleaded guilty in January to four counts of obtaining money by false pretenses and 

 is serving a year in jail for her crimes.

 She had a previous record of pulling a similar scam in other states.

 And not everyone was as lucky as Grant in realizing the deception while the man was at the door.

 &quot;He was very smooth,&quot; said one resident who asked not to be named.

 The resident said he actually wrote a check, but after realizing the company was not 

 legitimate, tried to cancel it with his bank.

 &quot;But now, even if it gets canceled, we&apos;re out the check canceling fee at least,&quot; he said.

NEIGHBORHOOD ON ALERT

Residents in Chancellor West became concerned last week when they began talking with one 

 another and no one knew the man visiting their homes trying to collect money.

 He claimed to be a resident of the neighborhood and told those he visited that he lived on 

 Pathfinder&apos;s Court, one of the roads nearby.

 Some residents reported that the young man claimed to be new to the area and spouted off names 

 of other residents, saying he knew them, in hopes to gain their trust.

 Judy Carlson, the secretary for the board of directors at Chancellor West, said the homeowners 

 association sent out a warning to residents about the potential door-to-door scammer.

 &quot;We&apos;re trying to get the word out so people know what&apos;s happening in the neighborhood,&quot; she said.

 1st Sgt. Liz Scott of the Spotsylvania Sheriff&apos;s Office said she knows of at least 

 one call reporting the fraudulent behavior.

 That call came from a home on Lee Jackson Circle, the main area of the neighborhood that 

 consists of about 100 lots.

 They have not named any suspects or made any arrests for the fraud, Scott said.

 Buyer beware: KSU theater students NOT selling magazines
Story by K-State Media Relations
KTKA 49 ABC
5:34 p.m. Tuesday, August 5, 2008
 The Kansas State University theater program is asking people to call the Riley County Police 

 Department if they are contacted about buying magazines from individuals posing as K-State 

 theater students.

 &quot;We have received several calls from people who said they were approached at their homes 

 by individuals posing as theater students. K-State Theater does not solicit funds door-to-door, 

 nor do we ask for cash or for checks made out to individuals,&quot; said Marci Maullar, managing 

 director of K-State Theater.

 Maullar said the theater program has had calls about the magazine sales from people in Manhattan, 

 Emporia, McPherson and Lawrence, who said they were told the funds raised would support a 

 trip to London or would be used to support the troops.

 Mauller said anyone asked to buy magazines from individuals claiming to be K-State 

 theater students should contact the Riley County Police Department at 785-537-2112. Story by K-State Media Relations

 Resident finds man in his garage in Boonton Township
Investigation leads to charges for three

Published: Thursday, July 31, 2008 7:48 AM EDT
 BOONTON TWP. A Birchwood Lane who was startled when he found a young man standing in his garage at 7:10 p.m. on 

 Tuesday, July 22, was the first of several residents to call police about what turned out to be a group of young 

 adults soliciting without a permit in the township.

 The Birchwood Lane resident told police when he confronted the man, the man said he was soliciting for 

 his basketball team and gave what turned out to be a fake township address.

 When officers got other calls, from residents in other parts of town town including Sheridan Lane, Hillcrest 

 Road and Meadowbrook Road, about unwanted solicitors they checked the area and eventually arrested 

 Thomas Cowguill, 24, of Lebanon, Ohio, was arrested in the Brae Loch condominium complex. 

 Officers arresting two women, Ashley Kelley, 20, of Cape Coral, Fla., and Priscilla Stalder, 22, of 

 Gardnerville, Nev.

 All three had given false addresses to residents, according to police, claiming they were from the 

 township, and all three told police they were employed by Team Extreme Sales, LLC, of Phoenix Ariz. 

 They were charged with soliciting without a permit, police said.

 The Birchwood Lane man told police when he came upon the man in his garage, the man said he was 

 soliciting money for his basketball team to travel to Holland. While police were checking 

 the neighborhood for the suspect, other residents told them a man had solicited money from them. 

 Several different stories had been given to the residents. Some said the young man said he 

 was trying to get money to pay college expenses, others said they were told by the man he was 

 participating in a national cash awards program, while still others were told he was selling 

 magazine subscriptions.

 Residents who are approached by solicitors should call police, 

 who will be able to check and see if the individuals have obtained the 

 permit required under town ordinance, according to police. The Citizen of Morris County

 Bookseller not affiliated with local school districts

 BELLA VISTA - A college student who has been knocking on doors and selling school reference 

 books to parents in Bella Vista said she hasn&apos;t had problems until recently. 

 Cami Alvarado, 21, said she has been selling a five-book series called the &quot;Student Handbook. 

 &quot;Each book covers different subjects a pupil might need for homework, she said. 

 In the last couple of weeks, a few residents who heard her sales presentation called the Bella 

 Vista Police Department out of concern that Alvarado seemed to indicate she was an employee 

 of the Bentonville School District. 

 Brad Reed, director of student services for the school district, confirmed Monday that no 

 district employees are selling items door to door. 

 Alvarado said she is an independent contractor for The Southwestern Co., based in Nashville, Tenn. 

 She earns a commission on her sales, which will go toward her college tuition, Alvarado said. 

 &quot;People in Bella Vista are very nice,&quot; she said. 

 Some people have written Alvarado checks for up to $ 400 without asking to see her identification, 

 she said. 

 When residents open their doors, Alvarado tells them,&quot; I&apos;m a college student from North Carolina. 

 I&apos;m not from the area. 

 &quot;I always say I&apos;m not with a school,&quot; she added. 

 Alvarado never shows anyone identification, and no one has asked for it, she said. However, 

 a photo ID is displayed in a clear plastic slot on her backpack, which she places on the 

 ground by the door when she is giving her sales pitch, she said. 

 Once Alvarado introduces herself, she asks if there are children in the neighborhood and, if so, 

 whether the children attend Cooper or Baker elementary schools. The questions may confuse people 

 and lead them to believe Alvarado is a school employee, she said. 

 She asks about children in the neighborhood because the books are suited for elementary- 

 to high-school-age children, she explained. Alvarado does not question young children if 

 they answer the door, she noted. 

 When Alvarado arrived in the area, she visited the Rogers and Bentonville police departments to 

 ask about regulations on selling door to door, she said. She didn&apos;t check with Bella Vista police, 

 however, because she didn&apos;t know the city has its own law enforcement, she said. 

 Alvarado said her summer job is almost finished. She will begin delivering orders Aug. 

 4 and will go back to North Carolina on Aug. 13. By Andra Atteberry Staff Writer // andraa@nwanews.com

 BELLA VISTA - Young people going door to door selling educational material are doing so as 

 private contractors for a company in Tennessee and are not involved in any kind of scam, 

 a company official said Tuesday. 

 Earlier this week, a dispatcher with the Bella Vista Police Department said she had been 

 visited by a woman who said she was a North Carolina college student selling educational books 

 to help raise money for school. 

 The dispatcher said the woman offered information that seemed to imply that she was 

 working for the Bentonville School District, when, in fact, according to one district 

 official, she was not. 

 The woman is an independent contractor for The Southwestern Co. in Nashville, Tenn., Trey Campbell, 

 director of communications, said in a phone interview from company headquarters Tuesday. 

 Campbell said the company sets students up with inventory and a territory they can work 

 during their summer break. 

 Each student is provided training and a script to be used when contacting potential buyers. 

 They also have identification provided by the company. 

 Campbell said he had not had a chance to talk to the woman in Bella Vista since the story 

 appeared, so he wasn&apos;t sure if she had presented her ID and followed procedures in making her pitch. 

 &quot;The students usually wear (the ID ), and I haven&apos;t had a chance to confirm that with her,&quot; he said. 

 He said it is possible that the conversation was such that it might have sounded as though 

 the woman, a student from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, was indeed working 

 for the local school district. 

 Campbell said the students are supposed to go to city hall or the local police department 

 when they arrive to make sure officials are aware of their presence and to check on 

 any changes to existing solicitation ordinances. Bella Vista has no such law on the 

 books, and he said the woman didn&apos;t check in, to his knowledge. 

 Campbell said he understands how people can become suspicious of doorto-door solicitors. 

 &quot;Find out as much information as you can,&quot; he said,&quot; including who they are, who they are 

 working for and what they are doing.&quot;

 He then said to check and double check what the salesperson is saying before handing over any money.

 Valley People Concerned About Salesmen

 Door-to-door salesmen have been spotted in Dayton, Weyers Cave, and throughout Augusta County. 

 People are contacting law enforcement about some aggressive ones.

 You don&apos;t see them as often as you used to, but one company has been sending the salesmen 

 to the area for more than 100 years.

 A Broadway woman was recently visited by a door-to-door salesman from Southwestern Company. 

 She asked to be identified by her first name only due to an unnerving experience she had 

 with the salesman.

 &quot;He just walked in the house. He plowed me over,&quot; says Jo. &quot;It was something I was not expecting.&quot;

 She says she had seen him in the neighborhood before. When she answered the door, 

 he immediately knew her name, as well as her kids&apos; names.

 The salesman is one of five college students spending the summer in the area to sell books 

 door-to-door for the Southwestern Company. It&apos;s supposed to be an opportunity for students 

 to get hands-on sales training.

 However, several people have contacted law enforcement saying the salesmen take it too far. 

 Officials at the Rockingham County Sheriff&apos;s Office say some satisfied customers have 

 even contacted them to compliment the salesmen. 

 According to the company spokesman, they work with the salesmen to teach them how to 

 handle this difficult type of business approach.

 &quot;There&apos;s a fine line between being persistent and being pushy,&quot; says Trey Campbell. 

 &quot;And we talk about that in the sales training. I&apos;ve been in my position for nine years, 

 and I&apos;ve never had anybody just push open the door and walk in the house uninvited.&quot;

 With the rise of the Internet, fewer door-to-door salesmen are seen, which maked some people 

 increasingly leery of them when they come to the door. The company holds a training session at 

 the start of the summer at their headquarters in Nashville.

 &quot;It&apos;s about 80 hours of training that covers everything from product knowledge and 

 sales presentation to safety, ethics, and business management,&quot; says Campbell. 

 &quot;These people, you know, they don&apos;t belong in our community, I feel, because it was a 

 scary moment,&quot; says Jo.

 Southwestern says they encourage their salesmen to explicitly state who they are and show 

 potential customers an identification badge. Reporter: Michael Hyland

 BELLA VISTA - Bentonville School District officials warn residents here to be on the lookout 

 for a woman knocking on doors giving the false impression that she is selling student 

 handbooks for the school district this summer. 

 &quot;We don&apos;t have any of our employees selling door to door,&quot; said Brad Reed, director of student 

 services for the district. 

 Sometimes student groups may hold fundraisers, but such events would be well publicized, he said. 

 They would be listed on the school&apos;s Web site - www. bentonville. k 12. ar. us - or in school flyers. 

 The fundraisers would also be announced in newspapers and on the radio, he said. 

 The woman in question stopped at a house on Grandshire Lane in mid-July and tried to sell 

 &quot;The Student Handbook&quot;to Bella Vista Police Department dispatcher Shelly Frederick. 

 The woman never actually said she worked for the district, but her sales pitch made it 

 seem that way, Frederick said. 

 &quot;If you&apos;re not clearly listening to what she&apos;s saying, one could mistakenly believe she&apos;s 

 with the school system,&quot; Frederick said. 

 The &quot;handbook&quot;the woman is selling is actually a reference guide that includes such 

 things as information about presidents and other school subjects, she said. 

 To the best of Frederick&apos;s memory, the woman was selling the books for $ 300 or $ 400 each. 

 Frederick said the woman called herself Cami, short for Camila, and was very friendly. 

 She told Frederick she was a communications major from a North Carolina college and was 

 working in Arkansas earning school credit and sales commissions. 

 Frederick isn&apos;t the only person who has come in contact with the woman. 

 Linda Largent, who lives on Tillingham Lane, reported the woman stopped at her house 

 Friday and visited with Largent&apos;s 16-year-old daughter. 

 Largent said the woman asked her daughter questions about neighborhood children. 

 Those actions made Largent suspicious, so she said she called the school district 

 and spoke to Reed, who told Largent to file a police report. By Andra Atteberry Staff Writer // andraa@nwanews.com

 I have received several emails (some forwarded) from a reader in Rockingham County that informs me 

 there is a strange man traveling door to door in county neighborhoods, reportedly selling various 

 items at times stating that he is conducting a survey for the school system and is looking 

 for households with children. 

 But that may sound worse than it actually is

 The accounts I have read, and that the Rockingham Sheriffs Office has received, indicate that 

 the man is acting creepy and pushy enough to prompt neighbors to warn each other and forward emails 

 warning parents about the guy. One email states: There have been reports from all around Rockingham 

 County about a young man who is pretending to sell educational materials; he also sells dishwashing 

 detergent. He has claimed to represent Rockingham County Public Schools on occasion, as well. 

 He is posing as a college student trying to make money, is shabbily dressed, his behavior is erratic, 

 and he is extremely persistent in his attempts to come inside.He has knocked on peoples back doors 

 as late as 9:30 pm and sometimes returns three or four times in one day to the same house. His main 

 goal seems to be to get inside the home. When asked to leave, he has lingered on front porches or 

 out in the street for some length of time, as well.

 Not wanting to create a panic, I have confirmed with the Sheriffs Office that the man has men 

 have been reported by several people. According to the dispatcher there, he one of the men is 

 apparently an educational book salesman. Im told that he one salesman has been warned not to 

 misrepresent who he works for. At this point, its not clear to me who that company is. 

 Ill update this post with new information if/as it becomes available.

 UPDATE: It appears this man may in fact be several salesmen peddling various different items, 

 including books, vacuums, and dish detergent.

 PASCO, Wash. - Pasco Police are searching for a missing woman. Her family in Detroit hasn&apos;t 

 heard from her since July 2nd and they said it&apos;s very unlike her not to call. 

 20-year-old Sharlene McCaa was staying with people in Pasco. Her family members told KNDU 

 that she was suppose to be in the Tri-Cities selling magazines and soap. 

 The man who she came out here with told Pasco Police he does not know where she is. 

 KNDU spoke with her guardian over the phone Thursday night. JoAnne McCaa is a soldier and is 

 delaying her trip back to Afghanistan because of concerns over her niece. 

 JoAnne McCaa said, &quot;I&apos;m shocked, I&apos;m confused, and I&apos;m very worried. This is not like her. 

 She will always call home. I was suppose to return to Afghanistan tomorrow and I refuse because 

 she&apos;s like my daughter.&quot;

 Sharlene&apos;s mother died when she was eight. 

 Pasco Police said this investigation is in the preliminary stages and they&apos;re trying to figure 

 out if Sharlene got onto a bus.

 3 arrested in Boonton Twp. for door-to-door soliciting
By Tehani Schneider Daily Record July 23, 2008
 BOONTON TWP. Three people who claimed to work for an Arizona business were arrested on 

 soliciting charges on Tuesday night after police received reports from several homeowners 

 of individuals going door to door across the township, seeking funding for various programs.

 Police learned of the schemes after a Birchwood Lane resident reported he was startled by a 

 young man later identified as Thomas Cowgull, 24, of Lebanon, Ohio in his garage shortly after 7 p.m. 

 The resident told police Cowgull attempted to obtain money for travel expenses to Holland 

 with his basketball team, authorities said. 

 While officers canvassed the area looking a man matching the residents description, several 

 other area residents reported the same man had approached them, attempting to sell magazine 

 subscriptions through a national cash awards program. 

 Residents told police the man said he lived in the area and was attempting to pay for his college expenses.

 Officers found Cowgull in the Brae Loch condominium complex shortly after and charged him in 

 violation of a local ordinance-- soliciting without a permit.

 During this time, police also received calls from several other areas in town, including 

 Sheridan Lane, Hillcrest Road and Meadowbrook Road, with residents complaining of solicitors.

 Ashley Kelly, 20, of Cape Coral, Fla., and Priscilla Stalder, 22, of Gardnerville, Nev., 

 were also arrested and charged with soliciting without a permit. Police said the 

 two women allegedly told residents they were from town and made up false addresses. 

 All three claimed to work for Team Extreme Sales LLC in Phoenix, Ariz., police said.

 Stenehjem: Use caution with magazine salespeople
Herald Staff Report
Grand Forks Herald
Published Wednesday, July 23, 2008
 North Dakotans should be wary of door-to-door magazine salespeople using misleading and 

 aggressive tactics, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said in a news release issued Tuesday.

 The Consumer Protection Division is investigating several groups selling magazine subscriptions 

 throughout North Dakota that may be in violation of state law, according to the release.

 Stenehjem warned that these salespeople are often youth claiming they are selling the 

 magazines to earn college scholarships or tuition, or raising money for a class trip.

 Parrell Grossman, director of the state CPD, said in the release that sellers must advise 

 consumers they have three days to cancel a subscription. Consumers older than 65 have 15 days.

 Grand Forks Police Lt. Rahn Farder said the department recently has not received any complaints 

 about magazine sellers.

 Residents with questions or wanting to make reports should contact the CPD at (800) 472-2600. Herald Staff Report

 Underage Sales Cases Tough To Prosecute
Man Behind Teens For Tomorrow Sales Charged In Three Counties
KETV.com
POSTED: 10:27 pm CDT July 23, 2008
UPDATED: 10:41 pm CDT July 23, 2008
 OMAHA, Neb. -- The man who ran the charity group Teens of Tomorrow faces trials in three 

 Nebraska counties on charges of exploiting teenagers to sell products door to door.

 The three trials do not include the criminal charge that dropped against Quenton Pfitzer 

 Wednesday when a 15-year-old witness failed to appear in court.

 Children associated with Teens of Tomorrow have peddled candy in Omaha and Lincoln for years, 

 saying theyre trying to raise money for worthy causes.

 Omaha City Prosecutor Marty Conboy said the peddlers are often underage children being 

 exploited. The law now specifically prohibits children under the age of 16 from selling 

 door to door under any circumstances, he said.

 But Conboy said trying to prosecute these cases is proving to be difficult.

 Pfitzer was supposed to go on trial Wednesday in Douglas County court on two charges of 

 violating child labor laws. One charge was dropped because the six-month limit for 

 a speedy trial had expired and because a key witness didnt show up.

 Conboy hopes for better luck with the charge thats still pending.

 Because they&apos;re children, they need the cooperation of their parents, he said. We&apos;ve talked 

 to the parents, tried to convince them to let their child cooperate. Some are afraid of 

 having their kids come to court, unclear whether the child might be in trouble or done something wrong.

 Conboy said its not the child who has done something wrong its the man who hired the child.

 Neither Pfitzer nor his attorney had any comment Wednesday, citing pending cases in Sarpy 

 and Douglas counties.

 KETV NewsWatch 7 has learned he also faces a criminal charge in Lancaster County. 

 All three of those cases are scheduled to go to trial the same week. ketv.com

 West Chester, Pennsylvania
Magazine Salesman Banned
Magazine Company: Alliance Service Company
 July 19, 2008 
 Judge banishes man from Chesco
By: Michael Rellahan, Special to The Mercury
The Murcury
07/19/2008
 WEST CHESTER - Common Pleas Court Judge James P. MacElree II has never claimed to be God.

 But on Wednesday, he did banish a man from paradise.

 That is, he ordered Zachary Zuckerman to leave Chester County immediately after his release 

 from prison and never to return to live or work there as part of a plea bargain on charges 

 of indecent assault.

 Assistant District Attorney Charles Gaza, who said he insisted on the prohibition for Zuckerman, 

 an itinerant magazine salesman, inserted the order into the plea bargain.

 &quot;I didn&apos;t want him out selling magazines in the county again,&quot; Gaza said after the sentencing. 

 &quot;There are other places he can sell his magazines, if that is what he chooses to do.&quot;

 According to court records, Zuckerman, 19, of Rolling Meadows, Ill., was arrested on May 5 at 

 the Waterview Apartments complex in Westtown after an encounter with a woman who had 

 agreed to buy magazine subscriptions from him.

 The woman, whose name is being withheld because of the nature of the charges, was walking her 

 dog about 12:30 p.m. in the complex when Zuckerman approached her. He said he worked for a 

 company named Alliance Service, selling magazine subscriptions.

 The woman told Sgt. Guy Rosato of the Westtown-East Goshen police that she agreed to buy some 

 subscriptions from Zukerman but had to go to an ATM to get cash to pay for them. 

 She allowed Zuckerman to ride with her while she drove to the ATM a block or so away.

 During the ride, however, Zuckerman began touching the woman&apos;s leg and thigh, and saying 

 that he wanted to &quot;tie (her) up and do bad things.&quot; The woman tried to ignore him, and 

 eventually drove back to the complex.

 There, Zuckerman said he wouldn&apos;t leave until the woman &quot;made out with him,&quot; and then 

 tried to kiss her. When the woman tried to get her cell phone to call police, 

 he grabbed her breast. Eventually, he left the car when the woman agreed to give him a hug.

 When police arrived and the woman described her assailant, they were able to track 

 Zuckerman down, still going door to door in the complex selling the subscriptions about an hour later.

 When interviewed by police, Zuckerman acknowledged being with the woman, but said nothing 

 unusual had happened while they were together. He said he had &quot;a habit of touching people 

 while he talks to them.&quot;

 The woman identified Zuckerman, and he was taken into custody and arrested.

 The plea bargain, which Gaza worked out with Zuckerman&apos;s attorney, P.J. Redmond of West 

 Chester, calls for him to serve 69 days to 23 months in county prison, and for him 

 to be immediately paroled. Gaza said he believed Redmond was going to make arrangements 

 for him to leave the county.

 &quot;My expectation is that he will be gone within 24 hours of his release,&quot; Gaza said.

 After the hearing, MacElree said it was as though he had been asked to exile someone from a kingdom.

 Judge banishes man from Chester County

 WEST CHESTER Common Pleas Court Judge James P. MacElree II has never claimed to be God.

 But on Wednesday, he did banish a man from paradise.

 That is, he ordered Zachary Zuckerman to leave Chester County immediately after his 

 release from prison Wednesday and never to return to live or work here, as part of a 

 plea bargain on charges of indecent assault.

 Assistant District Attorney Charles Gaza, who said he insisted on the prohibition for Zuckerman, 

 an itinerant magazine salesman, inserted the order into the plea bargain.

 &quot;I didn&apos;t want him out selling magazines in the county again,&quot; Gaza said after the sentencing. 

 &quot;There are other places he can sell his magazines, if that is what he chooses to do.&quot;

 According to court records, Zuckerman, 19, of Rolling Meadows, Ill., was arrested on May 

 5 at the Waterview Apartments complex in Westtown after an encounter with a woman who had 

 agreed to buy magazine subscriptions from him.

 The woman, whose name is being withheld because of the nature of the charges, was walking her 

 dog about 12:30 p.m. in the complex when Zuckerman approached her. He said he worked for a 

 company named Alliance Service, selling magazine subscriptions.

 The woman told Sgt. Guy Rosato of the Westtown-East Goshen police that she agreed to buy some 

 subscriptions from Zukerman but had to go to an ATM to get cash to pay for them. She allowed 

 Zuckerman to ride with her while she drove to the ATM a block or so away.

 During the ride, however, Zuckerman began touching the woman&apos;s leg and thigh, and saying 

 that he wanted to &quot;tie (her) up and do bad things.&quot; The woman tried to ignore him, and eventually 

 drove back to the complex.

 There, Zuckerman said he wouldn&apos;t leave until the woman &quot;made out with him,&quot; and then tried to 

 kiss her. When the woman tried to get her cell phone to call police, he grabbed her breast. 

 Eventually, he left the car when the woman agreed to give him a hug.

 When police arrived and the woman described her assailant, they were able to track Zuckerman down, 

 still going door to door in the complex selling the subscriptions about an hour later.

 When interviewed by police, Zuckerman acknowledged being with the woman, but 

 said nothing unusual had happened while they were together. He said he had &quot;a habit of 

 touching people while he talks to them.&quot;

 The woman identified Zuckerman, and he was taken into custody and arrested.

 The plea bargain, which Gaza worked out with Zuckerman&apos;s attorney, P.J. Redmond of West Chester, 

 calls for him to serve 69 days to 23 months in county prison, and for him to be immediately 

 paroled. Gaza said he believed Redmond was going to make arrangements for him to leave the county.

 &quot;My expectation is that he will be gone within 24 hours of his release,&quot; Gaza said.

 After the hearing, MacElree said it was as though he had been asked to exile someone from a kingdom.

The Magazine Industrys Dirty Little Secret
Selling subscriptions and violence door-to-door
 July 17, 2008 
 jossip.com
 Rampant drug use. Rape. Negligent homicide. Those are just a few of the lovely job perks that are 

 part of running in a magazine crew, one of those nefarious working environments that 

 operates in the underbelly of the magazine industry. Magazine crews, often made up of 

 troubled youth from broken homes, are the dark secret of publishers, who like to pretend 

 minors and convicted felons arent going door-to-door, hawking subscriptions based on 

 fictitious stories about raising money to travel abroad or go to band camp, and then 

 retreating to seedy motels to get high and have their wages withheld. This whole scenario 

 works out quite lovely for magazine publishers, who score plausible deniability about how 

 a slice of their paid subscriptions are secured.

If this whole things sounds familiar, it should.
Last February, the Times devoted 3,200 words to the matter, exposing a shadowy ring of fly-by-night operations that suck in young people hoping 

 for a cool summer gig, only to have their sanity played with as their managers used mental and 

 physical abuse to keep them meeting their quotas. Now, the Houston Press takes the story one step 

 further , and in its attempt to confront the industry about its sales practice, shows just how 

 blind an eye everyone is turning.

 While mainstream publishers and their trade group, the Magazine Publishers Association, 

 say door-to-door sales account for a minuscule percentage of annual sales, this seemingly 

 small percentage still translates into millions. Its profitable enough to publishers 

 like Cond Nast, Readers Digest and others that they still consider door-to-door sales a 

 worthwhile venture in the 21st century. And without publishers participation, the industry

 would cease to exist. Which means, quite simply, that publishers have decided the collateral 

 damage is worth the boost in circulation.

[]

Whenever theres a tragedy tied to the industry, whether it be the death of one of the agents or 

 of one of the customers, the industry mouthpieces issue impotent condemnations or reiterate the 

 notion that door-to-door sales are just a sliver of the pie.

The Magazine Publishers of America will give a variation of the following, which is a statement 

 it gave to the Press: Magazine Publishers of America condemns any door-to-door business that 

 preys on vulnerable individuals or poses a threat to the public. [MPA] has long urged its 

 members to identify any subscriptions coming from these sources and recommends that its 

 members cease doing business with any company that does not fully comply with the law. 

 Our guidelines and relations with subscription agents are clear, and we encourage all 

 our members to follow them.

Which, based on the Presss investigation, previous media stories and industry watchdogs, 

 is complete nonsense. The object is to push subscriptions, and it scarcely matters how.

[]

If the MPA is unaware of dirty canvassing, then its only other choice is to somehow believe 

 that door-to-door companies are the countrys single-biggest employer of college athletes in 

 the marching band whose parents are dying of cancer and who are competing for a scholarship 

 to study theater in London.

Unwritten policies like this, and the industrys general uncaring about how magazines are 

 sold, so long as theyre sold, might seem out of place in a country thats supposed to care 

 about our young peoples well-being. Hell, doesnt Conde Nast have magazines geared toward just that?

Compare Americas way of doing things, then, with the magazine market in India , where surprise 

 young people are also responsible for pushing magazines:

Publishers in India say the system is something they have little control over, and liken street-side 

 magazine distribution to the American paper route, a way for children to earn a little extra money. 

 But the children selling the magazines tell a different tale.

 If on a particular day my sales are poor, then I am abused by my employer, at times beaten as well, 

 said Sonu Kunar, a 12-year-old boy selling a variety of local and Western titles at the intersection 

 of two busy New Delhi roads. Sonu says he works from 9 in the morning until 8 in the evening, and 

 earns about 1,000 rupees, or $23.15, a month. He lives with 13 other children in a small room, and 

 sends all the money he earns back to his family in the eastern state of Bihar.

Honing this craft in the U.S. doesnt sound any safer.

While the American magazine market basically falls apart, things are just hopping over in India, 

 where the worlds largest democracy is pumping out local editions of Vogue, GQ, Maxim, and, 

 among the newest arrivals, People. (We hear Bollywood is big.)

Whats this you say about ad page declines? Circulation drop offs?

Not in India, where ad pages are expected to grow by 20 percent to $302 million this year. 

 So whats so different about the Indian market? Not that much, actually. Besides the ads for skin 

 lightening cream that fill womens magazines Estee Lauder does brisk business reinforcing racist 

 stereotypes there are more similarities than anything. Among them: True to its brand, 

 Maxim pushes the taste boundary; Womens magazines are service-y; Listicles are big.

Oh and if the magazine pushers working the streets to unload these books dont meet their 

 numbers, they get their asses beat.

India relies on an unorthodox street-side distribution system for more than half of all of 

 its magazine sales. In major cities, packs of young boys stand in traffic islands in the 

 middle of highways, holding up the latest copy of a glossy, and yelling Vogue, madam? 

 Indian Vogue! Golf Digest? into the windows of stopped cars.

While many of these new magazines may cost 100 rupees an issue, these boys usually earn much 

 less than that a day; they receive a commission from their boss, usually a middleman who 

 gets a commission from what he sells from a magazine distributor, who in turn buys the 

 magazines from the publisher for a fraction of the cover price.

Publishers in India say the system is something they have little control over, and liken 

 street-side magazine distribution to the American paper route, a way for children to 

 earn a little extra money. But the children selling the magazines tell a different tale.

If on a particular day my sales are poor, then I am abused by my employer, at times 

 beaten as well, said Sonu Kunar, a 12-year-old boy selling a variety of local and Western 

 titles at the intersection of two busy New Delhi roads. Sonu says he works from 9 in the 

 morning until 8 in the evening, and earns about 1,000 rupees, or $23.15, a month. He lives 

 with 13 other children in a small room, and sends all the money he earns back to his family 

 in the eastern state of Bihar.

 [NYT] 

Interesting, because thats not so dissimilar as to what American magazine sales crews face:

If sellers missed quota regularly or complained about the job, Mr. Simpson, 23, said he hit 

 them while in their room or when they were alone in the van. On more than 30 occasions, he 

 estimated, he and several other enforcers drew blood. In three instances, ambulances were 

 called, he said. Dealing with the police was not a problem.

You have one kid saying he was jumped and 20 others plus two managers saying he stole 

 something or broke into a room and assaulted a girl, Mr. Simpson said. Who do you think 

 the cops are going to believe?

Daivet McClinton, 23, an enforcer who worked with Mr. Simpson, said talking in front of 

 others about wanting to quit invited the worst beatings.

Asked if they ever went overboard, both men recalled an incident in November 2005 involving an 

 18-year-old recruit from Dayton, Ohio, named Rudy. All we were told was that Rudy had 

 shoved and disrespected the manager, Mr. Simpson said.

For 10 uninterrupted minutes in a motel stairwell in San Francisco, Mr. Simpson, Mr. McClinton 

 and four other enforcers beat Rudy unconscious, Mr. Simpson and Mr. McClinton said. One held 

 his mouth shut. Two others pinned down his arms and legs. Tearing off his shirt, 

 they pressed a flaming lighter into his back. Mr. Simpson kicked him in the face and body. 

 I stopped because I ran out of breath, Mr. Simpson said.

Rudy, they said, was taken away in an ambulance.

Documents detail wild, deadly brawl in hotel

 Documents detail wild, deadly brawl in hotel
BY DAVID OVALLE
Miami Herald
Posted on Tue, Jul. 15, 2008
 When two magazine subscription salesmen burst into his Sunny Isles Beach hotel room, Jesus 

 Cisneros told police, a nasty 20-minute brawl followed.

 They jammed fingers up his nose, threw a bicycle at him and smashed his head with a 

 frying pan, he claimed. Cisneros hurled back &apos;&apos;air fresheners&apos;&apos; and Sprite soda cans.

 By the time cops arrived, Cisneros had escaped.

 But Robert Spruiell -- a nationally known figure in the door-to-door subscription sales business -- 

 did not. He died from stab wounds, police believe, inflicted by Cisneros in self-defense.

 Newly released court records detail Cisneros&apos; version of the fight that left Spruiell dead and 

 fellow salesman Jeremy Johnson, 22, charged in his own boss&apos; death.

 Johnson, of South Dakota, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree felony murder and armed 

 burglary. In Florida, someone who commits certain felonies in which a cohort dies -- in this case, 

 armed burglary for allegedly storming the room to attack Cisneros -- can be charged with murder.

 The confrontation started because Spruiell and Johnson believed Cisneros was peddling drugs 

 to their sales people, police say.

 A hearing to determine whether Johnson can be released on bond will be held Tuesday in 

 front of Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Reemberto Diaz. Cisneros has been asked to testify.

 Johnson&apos;s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Herbert Smith points out Cisneros gave conflicting 

 accounts to an officer at the hotel and homicide detectives later.

 Smith also pointed out that Spruiell and Johnson&apos;s sales group was leaving the hotel that day.

 &apos;&apos;I could see where Cisneros could have easily attacked them,&apos;&apos; Smith said. ``It doesn&apos;t make sense -- 

 why they would attack him? What would be the purpose of it? To teach him a lesson?&apos;&apos;

 Spruiell owned a series of Arizona door-to-door magazine subscription companies. It is an industry 

 that has drawn scorn from consumer advocates for allegations of fraud, improper background checks of 

 salespeople and exploitation of the youngsters who criss-cross the nation hawking subscriptions.

 Spruiell, known in Hawaii as Kamuela Kamakana, was born of an islander mother, recently bought 

 a bar on the rural island of Molokai and hoped to retire there.

OPPOSED DRUG USE

He was also known for his adamant opposition to drug use. His group of salespeople had 

 been staying at the Golden Nugget, 18555 Collins Ave., for several weeks.

 Cisneros, 42, had no connection to the group. Cisneros, who claimed to remodel and restore 

 homes, was living in room 205 of the Golden Nugget with his girlfriend. She was out of 

 town during the stabbing.

 He has recorded 13 arrests since 2000, the most recent a cocaine possession and resisting arrest 

 with violence conviction two years ago.

 The night before the stabbing, Spruiell knocked on room 205 and demanded to know 

 if Cisneros had sold Johnson&apos;s girlfriend cocaine. Cisneros admitted he gave the woman cocaine 

 &apos;&apos;as a gift,&apos;&apos; he said.

 He told detectives that the next morning about 8:10 a.m., Johnson and Spruiell knocked on the door. 

 When Cisneros answered, Spruiell grabbed him by the neck, pushed him in and threw him to the 

 ground, he said.

 Cisneros alleged that Johnson followed, locking the door. He recalled the men began 

 beating him as he lay between two twin beds inside the cramped room.

 Spruiell &apos;&apos;put his fingers down my throat, and I couldn&apos;t talk and then he put his fingers 

 inside my nose,&apos;&apos; Cisneros said.

 ``The other guy got a lock, which I had on top, by the air-conditioning unit, and then 

 started hitting me with the lock and I was going in and out of consciousness.&apos;&apos;

`NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND&apos;

Cisneros remembered Johnson saying: ``You don&apos;t have to have to give her anything. 

 She is not your girlfriend.&apos;&apos;

 Next, Cisneros claimed, Spruiell tried flipping him over, threatening to sexually assault 

 and kill him.

 Bursting free, Cisneros jumped over the bed. Johnson picked up a bicycle belonging to Cisneros&apos; 

 girlfriend and threw it.

 Then Johnson attacked Cisneros with a brown knife with a five-inch blade, although he wasn&apos;t 

 sure where the knife came from, Cisneros said. They grappled over the weapon -- 

 Cisneros claimed he wrestled it away and ``swung a couple of times.&apos;&apos;

 Smith, Johnson&apos;s attorney, suggested Cisneros was the real aggressor with the knife.

 &apos;&apos;It would be very interesting to hear Mr. Cisneros explain how Mr. Johnson was stabbed on the 

 back of the right shoulder and the side of the left arm,&apos;&apos; Smith said.

 Next, Cisneros jumped away near the vanity. He said: ``I started throwing at him some air fresheners. 

 And then I picked up a chair, and I threw it at him.&apos;&apos;

 He unlocked the door, grabbed a hat and his cellphone and ran out to call police. 

 Spruiell followed, collapsing outside the room, and died.

 Following a blood trail, officers found Johnson inside room 220, nursing cuts to the chest and arm.

 Johnson, at Aventura Hospital, told hospital staff they went to confront a &apos;&apos;Cuban guy&apos;&apos; 

 about selling drugs.

 Meanwhile, Sunny Isles Officer Caridad Brizuela found Cisneros sitting in a chair outside 

 the room with ``obvious signs of injury to his face and head.&apos;&apos;

 He stammered to her, according to her report, that he and Spruiell were inside the room when 

 two young men -- one presumably Johnson -- &apos;&apos;barged into his room&apos;&apos; and ``began beating 

 both he and the deceased.&apos;&apos;

 The mention of a third person, and Spruiell as a beating victim, raises questions about 

 Cisneros&apos; changing stories, attorney Smith said. He pointed to Cisneros&apos; criminal past.

 &apos;&apos;I don&apos;t think giving false information to police is anything new to Mr. Cisneros,&apos;&apos; Smith said. BY DAVID OVALLE

 Attleboro, Massachusetts
Job from Hell

 Job from Hell
Attleboro trio recall horror of magazine-selling stint
BY RICK FOSTER SUN CHRONICLE STAFF
The Sun Chronicle
Last modified: Sunday, July 13, 2008 10:30 AM EDT
 When Sue Rodabaugh answered a help-wanted ad that turned out to be from an itinerant door-to-door 

 magazine sales company, she hoped for fun, travel and an opportunity to see a bit of 

 the country while making money to catch up on bills.

But Rodabaugh, who accepted an offer to travel to the Philadelphia area to join a street sales crew, 

 along with her boyfriend and their roommate, said they found neither fun nor a bootstrap opportunity.

 Instead, she said they were dropped off in unfamiliar locations, forced to walk up to 10 hours a 

 day and were housed with up to 40 other young salespeople in a threadbare New Jersey motel.

The 19-year-old, her boyfriend, George Tibbetts, 23, and their roommate, Derek Isbister, 21, 

 left before completing a three-day training period when Rodabaugh&apos;s grandmother agreed to wire them 

 bus fare.

But along the way, the Attleboro trio said they witnessed lying and misrepresentation by magazine 

 salespeople, rampant drug use and mistreatment of crew members.

 In one instance, she said, one saleswoman stole checks from a residential mailbox and coerced her to 

 sign them - presumably so they could be cashed.

&quot;It was unbelievable,&quot; Tibbetts said. &quot;We were all looking at each other, asking one another 

 what are we doing here?&quot;

Rodabaugh said she and her friends were desperate to earn money, all having lost 

 their jobs within the same week. But she now regrets urging the others to take the chance.

&quot;I can&apos;t believe I was so naive to go along with it,&quot; said Rodabaugh, who along with the men 

 have since told their story to the FBI.

Rodabaugh and Tibbetts said that after agreeing initially to take a bus to Philadelphia, 

 they were given tickets to Wilmington, Del., where they were picked up by a crew representative.

As trainees, each was given $20 a day to help them get started. Most of the time, however, they were broke.

 Crew members and trainees performed daily calisthenics and attended meetings at which their handlers 

 &quot;amped up&quot; their charges by having them repeat slogans and sales routines.

Nights were devoted to partying, punctuated with drug use and underage drinking, Tibbetts said.

During their days on the road, Tibbetts and Rodabaugh said they spent up to 10 hours a day 

 walking and canvassing neighborhoods through 100-degree heat mixed with thunderstorms.

Crews were transported from neighborhood to neighborhood in vans whose drivers were sometimes 

 so reckless that Tibbets said he literally had to hang onto his seat at speeds up to 80 mph.

 Tibbetts said he and his friends weren&apos;t the only ones shocked by the conditions and business 

 practices of the crew. Eight other prospects also dropped out over a three-day period.

Sadly, said Earlene Williams, director of Parent Watch, which tracks the activities of 

 itinerant magazine solicitors, such reports are neither rare nor isolated to major metropolitan areas.

Labor abuses against crew members, mostly young and with few skills or job prospects, are widespread, 

 she said.

In the past, sales crew members who failed to produce or stray from the rules have been beaten, 

 had their commissions withheld , been abruptly fired and dropped off at the side of the road, she said.

Sometimes, members who make their team look bad by not selling enough subscriptions are subject 

 to isolation or humiliating treatments, like being forced to run a gauntlet of jeering fellow sales people.

Often, young women end up sleeping with their titular managers or supervisors.

&quot;It&apos;s one way to protect yourself,&quot; Williams said.

That&apos;s not the worst that can happen.

Phil Ellenbecker&apos;s teenage daughter worked for an itinerant sales crew for only two days in 

 1999 before a van, driven by a serial traffic offender, overturned in Janesville, 

 Wis., killing her and half the 14 young salespeople inside.

Ellenbecker later formed the Dedicated Memorial Parents Group to expose abuses in the 

 door-to-door sales industry.

Contrary to enticements found in advertisements, Ellenbecker said, most crew members earn 

 relatively little in commissions. And with $20 or more a day deducted for hotel costs, 

 many members end up heavily in debt to the operators.

&quot;It can be compared to indentured servitude,&quot; Ellenbecker said.

It&apos;s different for those who run the crews. They reap the benefits of profits earned by the 

 salespeople who work for them.

On his MySpace site, the supervisor of the crew that employed Tibbetts and Rodenbaugh claimed 

 to earn from $45,000 to $60,000 per year.

Neither the supervisor, the company that employs him nor the National Field Sales Association, 

 which represents door-to-door sales organizations, returned calls from a reporter.

Howard Polskin, a representative of the Magazine Publisher&apos;s Association industry umbrella group, 

 said subscriptions obtained through door-to-door sales represent a tiny fraction - 

 estimated at 1 percent or less - of the magazine business.

He said the MPA has established strict guidelines for solicitors that require background checks 

 for sales personnel and ban false or deceptive selling practices.

A statement released by the MPA said the group &quot;has long urged its members to identify 

 any subscriptions&quot; coming from organizations that prey on the vulnerable or pose a danger 

 to the public, &quot;and recommends that its members cease doing business with any company that 

 does not fully comply with the law.&quot;

Nevertheless, salespeople are constantly under pressure from their bosses to make sales quotas, 

 watchdog groups say.

Rodabaugh said that during her sojourn in a vehicle with three other women, 

 salespeople frequently represented themselves as local residents to gain the trust of 

 potential customers. She said one worker took a box of blank checks from one house&apos;s mailbox - 

 a federal offense - and coerced her to endorse them.

Subscription orders are frequently paid by check.

Williams said crew members typically work as independent contractors to avoid minimum wage 

 laws and other requirements for employees.

Workers usually bunk three to four to a hotel room and are dispatched on their daily rounds 

 in vans driven by a car handler. Crews are usually dropped off and picked up four to five times a day, 

 knocking on doors in different neighborhoods.

After two or more weeks based in a particular region, crews move on to other parts of the country.

Salespeople are usually given a quota of five sales a day or 30 sales a week, Williams said, 

 which can be raised later based on production.

Those who fulfill certain sales criteria may be told they can earn points toward a $1,000 prize 

 or a trip to Disney World.

A 2007 investigation by The New York Times, however, found that many crew members made little 

 money, saved less and were subject to violence and taunting.

The report said the earnings of many members was kept on the books for later payment, rather 

 than paid to them immediately.

Many states, but not Massachusetts, have attempted to control traveling crews by 

 requiring permits for door-to-door solicitations. But even in those states, companies 

 often flout the rules, moving their operations rapidly to stay ahead of law enforcement.

While riding with a sales crew as a trainee in New Jersey, Rodabaugh said her van driver was stopped 

 several times for not having the proper permits, and then was yelled at when her crew did not 

 make enough sales.

State Rep. Cleon Turner, D-Yarmouth, has been trying to push through a bill that would require 

 door-to-door sales firms to register with local police before beginning sales campaigns. 

 And citizens would be able to have their homes placed on a &quot;no-knock&quot; list if they 

 don&apos;t want solicitors calling at their doors.

The bill, which was promoted by the Yarmouth Police, was occasioned by reports of crimes, 

 harassment and intimidation during and after walk-up solicitations, Yarmouth police Lt. Steven 

 G. Xiarhos said.

So far, however, the bill has made little progress. A few Bay State communities, such as 

 Amesbury, have adopted local ordinances requiring salespeople to register with the police.

Crimes by door-to-door solicitors are all too common.

Ellenbecker&apos;s group, which often aids police in investigating crimes related to door-to-door selling, 

 currently has 27 alleged felony cases on its books, including a woman customer who was raped 

 and murdered by a salesman.

In May, Beverly police arrested a 25-year-old Philadelphia man on a charge of assaulting 

 a 13-year-old girl near her home. Police, who said the man tried to grab the teenager, 

 classified the incident as an attempted abduction.

Both the suspect and two companions working for a magazine-selling crew were convicted felons, 

 according to the police report.

The same trio also visited several other Massachusetts communities last spring, including Seekonk.

Most sales crews are run by independent companies rather than magazine publishers. 

 Selling organizations get their magazine supply either through contracts with publishers 

 or through clearinghouses linked with individual sales organizations.

The third-party connection makes it possible for publishers to eschew any responsibility for 

 sales crews or their tactics while still reaping the benefits of subscription revenue, 

 said Parent Watch&apos;s Williams.

In most states, door-to-door salesmen are subject to little regulation, Ellenbecker said.

However, the National Field Selling Association maintains a code of ethics for sales organizations 

 to promote fair treatment of salespeople and to keep out criminals.

For example, the NFSA code requires that blind ads for sales crews contain &quot;sufficient 

 information so that an individual may know the basic nature of the offer.&quot;

However, an advertisement placed in The Sun Chronicle by the sales group that hired the local 

 trio made no mention of selling magazines or where or under what circumstances trainees 

 would live or earn money.

A series of ads placed by the same company on Internet help-wanted sites carried the enticement, 

 &quot;Live Like A Rock Star.&quot;

The NFSA code also specifies that background checks are to be conducted to ensure that 

 salespeople are of good character.

Tibbetts and Rodenbaugh said they were told about the background checks, but were not 

 aware that any checks were actually conducted on them.

The NFSA, which did not respond to a Sun Chronicle reporter&apos;s phone call, does 

 not publish a list of the members who subscribe to its code on its Web site.

Although disgusted with what they called abusive treatment, unsafe driving and deceptive 

 practices, the Attleboro trio said they&apos;re happy about at least one thing.

&quot;We&apos;re glad to be back,&quot; Tibbetts said.

Ellenbecker, whose daughter died under conditions similar to those endured by the local trio, 

 said he hopes consumers who know the facts won&apos;t patronize sales crews whose members are likely 

 to be exploited young people.

&quot;If someone comes to your door, and you don&apos;t know them or can&apos;t be certain they&apos;re with a 

 legitimate group, don&apos;t do business with them,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;re just feeding the monster.&quot; BY RICK FOSTER SUN CHRONICLE STAFF

Door-to-Door Magazine Sales Warning !!!

 Magazine Sales Scam Hooks Bellevue Couple
Be careful with door-to-door sales

 Bellevue couple warns to be leery of people selling door-to-door. A magazine scam almost 

 cost them big bucks.

 A young couple showed up at the Millers&apos; door on Friday. &quot;They were about our age, just 

 real down to earth, nice people,&quot; says Justin Miller.

 Justin and Dawn took them at their word. &quot;They were just selling magazines, 

 saying they needed points to go on a trip to Cozumel (Mexico) and it seemed 

 pretty real so we let &apos;em in and seen what they had to offer.&quot;

 Earning points for a trip or earning money for school are common ploys say consumer advocates.

 &quot;They were pretty much just doing this thing for school and they just wanted to win a trip, 

 says Justin. They said they were competing against other schools.&quot;

 The Millers took the bait. &quot;Just two subscriptions which came to about a hundred bucks. 

 It was for two years each.&quot;

 The company listed on the receipts was Gemini Subscriptions, Inc. As soon as the reps left, 

 Justin got a bad feeling and hit the computer. &quot;I just googled &apos;em and seen that it 

 was pretty much a scam from all over the United States, hundreds of reports. I just 

 cancelled it, cancelled the checks right there.&quot;

 To weed out scammers, the Better Business Bureau says always get the name and phone 

 number of the company. Postpone the sale until you run the information by the BBB and 

 never allow a solicitor inside your home.

 In hindsight, Justin has some advice of his own. &quot;Definitely just ask a lot of questions, 

 probably get some ID and definitely do some research on &apos;em.&quot;

 He just wishes he&apos;d done that part first. Cancelling two checks will cost the Millers 

 nearly $60, still better than the hundred they believe they would have lost if 

 they let the sale go through.

Lewd salesman suspect turns himself in

 Lewd salesman suspect turns himself in

 CLEARFIELD -- A salesman suspected of exposing himself to women has turned himself in, police said.

 Kenny Dwayne Goodlow, 23, contacted a Clearfield police detective at 7 p.m. Thursday after 

 hearing news reports about his conduct, said Assistant Police Chief Greg Krusi.

 He was booked in the Davis County Jail on a class A misdemeanor sexual battery, and 

 two counts of class B misdemeanor battery.

 He is scheduled to appear in Farmington&apos;s 2nd District Court at 1:30 p.m. today.

 Krusi said his office has received calls from other jurisdictions concerning Goodlow&apos;s 

 behavior, which was described as &quot;pushy and rude,&quot; but nothing criminal.

 Goodlow was working up to the time of his arrest with Austin Diversified Products 

 out of Harvey, Ill., police said.

 Salem police is also bringing a second-degree felony burglary charge against Goodlow in 

 connection with an incident on July 7.

 Salem police Sgt. Scott Dibble said Goodlow knocked on a door, which was answered by a 

 teenage girl. After giving his sales pitch, the girl told Goodlow to leave because the 

 parents were not home.

 &quot;He then asked to use the bathroom, for some water and aspirin,&quot; Dibble said.

 The girl tells him no, Dibble said, but Goodlow walks into the house anyway.

 He leaves after using the bathroom, and the girl and her siblings thought the man had left, 

 but found him on the front porch.

 They tell him again to leave and the oldest girl, who was 16, had to leave for her 

 job. When she got to her work, she called her younger sister, Dibble said. 

 The man was back in the house. She called her mother, who called home and 

 told the man to leave. She called police.

 When police got to the house, they found the man had taken a purse and gone through it, Dibble said.

 The police secretary saw a news story Thursday and called Dibble. He called 

 Clearfield police and learned Goodlow had turned himself in.

 &quot;We went up there and interviewed him,&quot; Dibble said.

 &quot;He spends more than an hour there without the parents there, instead of going out and 

 making other sales calls,&quot; Dibble said. &quot;That&apos;s not right.&quot;

 Goodlow has traveled throughout the country and has a criminal record in at least one 

 other state, &quot;but nothing sexual,&quot; Krusi said.

 Police are still seeking additional victims in Weber and Davis counties.

 To contact police call, 525-2806.

(Updated 11:50 a.m.)

 Clearfield police seek lewd salesman 

CLEARFIELD Police here want to arrest a door-to-door salesman suspected of exposing himself to women, 

 but so far no victims willing to participate in a prosecution have come forward.

 Two victims unwilling to participate in a prosecution complained about the man who was selling 

 cleaning supplies, Clearfield Assistant Police Chief Greg Krusi said.

 The man is 23 years old and black, Krusi said.

 One woman said the man exposed his genitals to her while the other woman said he groped her breast.

 The womens reports were made independent of one another on Wednesday.

 Police reportedly know the mans name, which Ogden motel he is staying at and his employer. 

 Krusi said the man works for Austin Diversified Products of Harvey, Ill., and is here with a 

 sales team that is leaving soon.

 They will be in the Davis-Weber area until Sunday, Krusi said.

 Krusi said he does not know why the two complainants who called are not willing to prosecute. 

 For whatever reason, theyre not willing to go any further than just to report it to us, Krusi said. 

 Though police have not heard back from the company headquarters, Krusi said the mans immediate 

 supervisor is aware of the issue.

 The thing that concerned us is our patrol guy called (the suspects) immediate supervisor 

 here and he was aware of the misconduct, Krusi said. So we know this guy is pretty brazen 

 about his sexual approaches.

 Police in Sunset, Syracuse, Layton and Clinton said they are unaware of any similar complaints.

 Charges are filed against a door-to-door salesman who was showing off a little more 

 than cleaning products. 

 One woman says Kenneth Goodlow exposed himself. Another says he was a little too 

 friendly and fondled her. 

 The Davis County Attorney&apos;s Office charged Goodlow with sexual battery and lewdness. 

 According to Clearfield police, Goodlow also faces a charge of burglary in Salem. 

 He was still working just prior to his arrest, even though his supervisor had been 

 notified on Wednesday of his alleged behavior.

Police warn of salesman

 Police warn of salesman
By Ben Winslow
Deseret News
Published: July 11, 2008
 Clearfield police have issued a public warning about a salesman they said is going door-to-door 

 and engaging in acts of sexual misconduct.

 But police say they are equally frustrated that the women complaining about it won&apos;t pursue 

 criminal charges against him.

 &quot;Because we don&apos;t have a cooperative victim, we can&apos;t hold him,&quot; Clearfield Assistant Police 

 Chief Greg Krusi said Thursday.

 Police fielded several complaints on Wednesday about a door-to-door cleaning-supply salesman 

 who exposed himself and in one case, fondled a woman&apos;s breast. Officers tracked down the man, 

 but they could not make an arrest because none of the alleged victims were willing to pursue 

 criminal charges. 

 &quot;They don&apos;t want to do anything other than let us know,&quot; Krusi said.

 Police said the man is part of an Illinois-based products company that is going across the 

 country, selling cleaner door-to-door. Salesmen go out in 15-passenger vans and are dropped 

 off in different parts of a city, meeting up at a central location at the end of the day.

 They were all reportedly staying in an Ogden motel and working in Weber County, 

 scheduled to leave at the end of the week. Krusi said officers have spoken to the 

 salesman&apos;s supervisor, who is aware of this and other complaints about the man. 

 Investigators fear there may be other women out there, and issued a public plea on 

 Thursday for any other victims to come forward.

 &quot;Our concern is we&apos;ve got one guy out there that&apos;s doing this,&quot; Krusi said. &quot;We are looking 

 for additional victims who are willing to step up.&quot; 

 Anyone with information is urged to contact Clearfield police at 801-525-2806.

 Silva Lanes &apos;not going anywhere&apos;
Bowling alley seeks protection from wrongful death lawsuit with Chapter 11 bankruptcy
Bob Quick | The New Mexican
SantaFe NewMexican
7/8/2008 - 7/9/08
 Silva Lanes in Santa Fe will continue with business as usual even though the bowling alley&apos;s 

 parent company, Silva Bowling Inc. in Albuquerque, recently filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy to 

 protect itself from a lawsuit arising from the death of a man on the bowling alley&apos;s property 

 about three years ago. 

 Company president Art Silva discussed the bankruptcy filing and the lawsuit in a telephone 

 interview this week. 

 A group of magazine-subscription salesmen were charged in the 2005 death of Santa Fe resident 

 Benjamin Suazo outside the bowling alley at 1352 Rufina Circle, on the city&apos;s southwest side. 

 Suazo&apos;s mother, Eleanor Ocona, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in state District Court in 2006. 

 &quot;It was after hours and had nothing to do with us,&quot; said Silva, who also owns an alley in Albuquerque. 

 &quot;Our insurance didn&apos;t cover it. Our attorneys&apos; bills are up over $200,000. It&apos;s taking 

 all our cash flow to support this lawsuit. That&apos;s why we elected to file Chapter 11.&quot; 

 By filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a debtor remains in possession of the business and in control 

 of its operation. The debtor and his creditors are able to work together through the bankruptcy. 

 Silva explained that the judge in the civil lawsuit allowed Silva&apos;s insurance company to drop 

 its coverage. &quot;That left us without insurance and footing the bill,&quot; he said. 

 By filing bankruptcy, Silva said, &quot;technically it ends the lawsuit.&quot; 

 Santa Fe bankruptcy attorney Doug Booth said that unless there is some form of wrongful 

 conduct on the part of the defendant, the claims contained in the civil lawsuit could be discharged. 

 &quot;I think (Chapter 11 bankruptcy) may protect (Silva Bowling), but I couldn&apos;t say for sure,&quot; 

 he said. &quot;There are some exceptions.&quot; 

 Another attorney, who asked not to be identified, said filing bankruptcy &quot;is a big stop sign&quot; 

 for the plaintiff. &quot;It doesn&apos;t terminate the claim, but it may have a chilling effect 

 on the plaintiff&apos;s willingness to pursue it,&quot; the attorney said. 

 Silva&apos;s attorney, Daniel J. Behles, said he couldn&apos;t comment on the matter. 

 The bankruptcy filing indicates Silva Bowling Inc. has liabilities of more than 

 $4 million and assets of about $553,000. 

 The largest creditor holding a secured claim is Brunswick Bowling and Billiards, an Illinois 

 company, which is owed $2.4 million for bowling alley pinsetters and other equipment. 

 Silva and his wife, Diane Silva, are listed as unsecured creditors with a claim of $775,000 

 consisting of multiple loans and guarantees for the corporation, including unpaid rent. 

 Suazo was run over in the bowling alley&apos;s parking lot by the vehicle of one of five men originally 

 charged in the case, after getting caught up in a dispute with the group that was in town to 

 sell subscriptions. 

 Charges against one of the men were later dropped. Of the four other men, one was sentenced to 

 prison, one received five years of probation and two others were acquitted of second-degree 

 murder charges. 

 Named in the lawsuit were Silva Bowling, the five men initially charged in connection with 

 Suazo&apos;s death and the two magazine-subscription sales companies that employed the men. 

 Ocona&apos;s lawsuit says bowling-alley employees served alcohol to members of the sales crew, 

 who were intoxicated. The lawsuit also said the bowling alley should have had more than one 

 security guard on duty at the time and that there had been 387 calls to 911 from Silva Lanes 

 in the three years preceding Suazo&apos;s death. 

 Silva said the incident was recorded by Silva Lanes&apos; video cameras and showed Suazo was 

 &quot;clearly the aggressor&quot; in the dispute. 

 Suazo&apos;s mother&apos;s lawsuit doesn&apos;t deal with Suazo&apos;s role in his own death. But during the 

 preliminary hearing, state District Judge Michael Vigil identified Suazo as a &quot;willing 

 participant in this combat&quot; with the magazine salesmen. 

 In other remarks, Silva said he had insurance to cover his liability, but then his 

 insurance company applied for &quot;relief from that liability&quot; and received a favorable ruling from a judge. 

 &quot;That left us without insurance and footing the bill,&quot; he said. Bankruptcy &quot;was the only way out. 

 It was not what I wanted to do, but I needed to do it for the protection of my employees and myself.&quot; 

 Silva said he hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 in three to five years, sooner if he can 

 put together a refinancing of the business. 

 In the meantime, Silva said, &quot;I believe Santa Fe bowlers will support us. 

 We&apos;re not going anywhere.&quot;

For over 30 years, traveling sales crews of young adults are recruited into 

 magazine sales jobs with promises of making money, but essentially are held in 

 an environment equivalent to that of an indentured servant or share cropper.

I met two young women at my house who told me this story. They are both 

 salespeople recruited from the inner city to work on these sales crews. These 

 women, 19 and 21, are both employed by a company called Chapel Sales.

These salespeople are required to work 80+ hour days, often doing door to 

 door sales in dangerous urban areas. The company holds their earnings in an 

 account for them, and if they leave, their earnings are in jeopardy. Their day 

 starts at 8:30 AM, and they work until 9:00 PM. If they dont meet quota, they 

 have to go to another meeting at 11:00 PM.

One of the workers told me that she was denied money for food, because she 

 didnt sell, and had to watch others in her group eat. That same salesperson 

 was also the victim of a robbery while selling in an inner-city apartment building.

Ive done some research, and found that these kids are often the victims of 

 crime, and many of them have been raped, robbed, murdered, or killed in 

 automobile related fatalities.

In the past, if local authorities got wind of this activity, they would simply move 

 these crews to another state. The salespeople are classified as independent 

 contractors largely for the purpose of bypassing labor laws.

I spoke at length with Phil Ellenbacker, webmaster of 

 www.travelingsalescrews.info Phils daughter was one of 7 children killed in a 

 van driven by one of these work crews. Phil told me that the driver was driving on 

 a suspended license.

How can you help?

Magazine Sales Agent Arrested For Breaking and Entering and Robbery

 Solicitor arrested for breaking and entering
By Ben Aaronson/Staff Writer
wickedlocal.com
Thu Jul 03, 2008, 11:16 AM EDT
 Lincoln -
Lincoln police Wednesday night arrested a female solicitor in connection with a Monday robbery 

 on Beaver Pond Road.

 Loretta Goode, 21, of Center Moriches, N.Y. was arraigned Thursday morning at Concord District 

 Court on charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony and larceny from a building.

 According to Police Chief Kevin Mooney, the homeowners reported their wallets missing on Tuesday evening, 

 July 1. The husband and wife reported a solicitor had been on their property the previous day and 

 provided a physical description of the person, Mooney said.

 Mooney said the woman was selling magazines with a group called Paragon Sales, having 

 been placed there by a Chicago-based agency called Equal Opportunity. Mooney said 

 Paragon Sales registered about a dozen salesmen with the Police Department last 

 week in accordance with the towns solicitation bylaw.

 Police suspended the companys operation until the investigation was complete.

 Mooney said the management company was very upset about the incident and encouraged 

 Goode to come forward.

 The cooperation from the company was outstanding, he said.

 On Wednesday, July 2, Goode turned herself into police and admitted entering the house 

 through an unlocked door and taking the wallets, Mooney said. Goode was arrested and 

 her solicitation license revoked, he said.

 Mooney said this was the first such incident in town related to Paragon Sales, 

 which sells magazines in the area every spring.

 Theyre here legitimately working hard 99 percent of the time, he said.

 Mooney said the larceny should serve as a reminder to residents to keep their property 

 secured. According to Mooney, the homeowners in this particular incident had only 

 left the house to take a short walk when the larceny occurred.

 [If] you leave your house, lock your doors. It doesnt take very long, so leaving for 

 a short time doesnt mean you can leave your house unsecured, he said. 

 That goes for motor vehicles too.

 Mooney credited Lt. Kevin Kennedy for his work in leading the investigation and making the arrest.

 Mooney said identifying the suspect would have been much more difficult without 

 the solicitation bylaw, which requires solicitors to register with the town. By Ben Aaronson/Staff Writer

 Four men in Salem charged in assault of magazine salesman

Published Wednesday, July 02, 2008 2:55 PM by Salem Editor
 Four door-to-door salesmen were placed under arrest after two of the men allegedly beat a 

 third in the parking lot of a Wendys restaurant for low sales figures late Thursday night.

 Police charged Darrell Price and Tyjaun Seals, both 19, with simple assault. Two other men, 

 Joseph Mims and Kevin Price, both 21, were charged with disorderly conduct.

 Police apprehended the men at a Hess station on the intersection of Route 28 and Lake Street 

 after they fled from the scene in a dark red van at 9:55 p.m.

 All four men work for the Pargon Sales Midwest Clearing company and have been soliciting 

 magazine subscriptions in the Salem area, according to police. 

 After failing to meet his sales quota, one of the salesmen was allegedly refused dinner 

 and then beaten by his supervisor and a co-worker.

 None of the men could produce positive identification and gave police the address of the 

 Doubletree Hotel in Lowell, Mass. Police believe the four men are from Chicago.

 The group registered with the Salem Police Department as per state law last Monday, and 

 authorities are taking steps to remove the men from the town.

 Attempts to contact the company by the authorities have been unsuccessful. 

 Police are urging local business and area residents to notify the department 

 of any further contact with the group. BY DERRICK PERKINS

Door-to-Door Magazine Salesmen Arrested

 Magazine salesman charged after retaliation for rejection
By LISA BACKUS, Journal Register News Service

Posted on Tue, Jul 1, 2008
 FARMINGTON For the second time in less than two weeks, police arrested an overzealous out-of-state 

 magazine salesman who reacted poorly when local residents declined to pay for a subscription. 

 Antwan Duff, 21, of St. Louis, Mo., was taken into custody Monday after a Coppermine Road resident 

 reported the salesman poured a soda into the residents open convertible.

 He took umbrage at the fact they didnt buy a subscription, Lt. William Tyler said. 

 They turned him down and then they saw him pour a can of soda into their open convertible that 

 was sitting in the driveway. He also received a ticket for soliciting without a permit. 

 Duff was charged with first-degree criminal trespass and third-degree criminal mischief 

 and was held overnight on $5,000 surety bond until his appearance in Hartford Superior Court Tuesday. 

 It was the second time in less than two weeks that police nabbed an out-of-state magazine 

 salesman for employing hard-sell tactics. Police arrested Terry Jennings, 26, of Illinois 

 June 19 after three women at Westfarms mall reported he was making lewd remarks and following 

 them to their cars.

 In one case Jennings flapped his arms like a chicken and then grabbed a womans hand to ask 

 about her lack of an engagement ring. In another case he asked a woman if she wanted to commit 

 a sex act with him and then flipped her an obscene gesture when she tried to leave. 

 By town ordinance, solicitors are required to seek a license with the police chief before they 

 can sell merchandise door to door. The license procedure includes a background check through 

 Farmington and state police records and a description of the vehicle and goods to be sold.

 Both men received town ordinance tickets for soliciting without a permit in addition to criminal charges. By LISA BACKUS, Journal Register News Service

Loves Park aldermen OK soliciting law

 Loves Park aldermen OK soliciting law
By Mike Wiser
RRSTAR.COM
Posted Jul 01, 2008 @ 11:12 PM
 LOVES PARK Going door-to-door to sell services in Loves Park just got more expensive. 

 Monday night aldermen unanimously approved a law that makes it illegal for a peddler, hawker 

 or huckster to solicit business in the city without first obtaining a license from city hall. 

 That means no door-to-door salespeople or vendors allowed, unless they first apply to the 

 city for a license and plunk down $100 for the opportunity to sell their wares or ask for 

 money in Loves Park. 

 The $100 is to cover the cost of the criminal background check on the individual and a 

 check on the business the applicant is representing. Those caught without a license are 

 subject to arrest and face a fine of up to $750.

 This really just streamlines the process, Loves Park Police Chief Pat Carrigan said. 

 The old ordinance was outdated and needed some updating ... There wasnt a rash of 

 soliciting complaints or anything like that.

 Before the ordinance passed, people would only have to register with city hall if they 

 planned to try and sell items or solicit door-to-door. There were no fees associated with registering.

 Even with a license, salespeople are not allowed to approach homes with no soliciting 

 signs on them. The ordinance also prohibits peddlers from trying to sell items other that 

 what they listed as the items they were going to sell on their application to city hall. 

 Additionally, the vendors have to carry their license on them at all times and can only 

 go door-to-door from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.

 Exceptions to the license requirement are made for government employees who are on official 

 business; people soliciting support for political causes or other causes not involving the 

 solicitation of funds; and individuals soliciting charitable donations for a recognized 

 nonprofit association, organization or project. 

 Ald. Clint Little, who chairs the councils public safety committee, said the law 

 will hopefully address a problem he recently had in his ward that had to do with 

 people selling magazine subscriptions.

 When the homeowner would tell them no, the person selling the subscriptions would offer 

 to sell them a no soliciting sticker and say something about how there were going to 

 be a lot of other solicitors in the area and (the homeowner) could post the sticker, 

 Little said. It seemed like extortion to me.

 Little said its possible the ordinance could get tightened up in the future if 

 it turns out to be too broad or not cover everything the council had hoped it to.

Mon Jun 30, 2008, 06:31 PM EDT
 Larry Talbert, 21, of 942 Elsworth Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio, was arrested at 4:50 p.m. June 24 at 

 208 Warren St. by Officer Joseph OBrien Jr. He was a fugitive from justice.

 Police were given a list of solicitors from Paragon Sales who would be going door-to-door 

 selling magazines in Needham. In checking the names, police discovered one of the people on 

 this list, Talbert, was wanted by the Hamilton County Sheriffs Department in Cincinnati for 

 an aggravated drug offense.

 Police later spotted Talbert lying on a park bench at the intersection of Warren Street 

 and School Street. Talbert, when approached by police, said he was selling magazines and was 

 lying on the bench because he was tired. After police, who recognized Talbert from the earlier 

 check on solicitors, positively identified him, they arrested Talbert and held him for rendition. wickedlocal.com

Published: June 28, 2008 12:06 am
 SALEM, N.H. A door-to-door magazine salesman who failed to meet his sales quota was 
 rewarded with a beating by his supervisor and co-workers, police said.
 Police arrested four men who had fled Wendy&apos;s Restaurant at 300 N. Broadway, where 
 they were seen striking their co-worker in the parking lot. Police were called to 
 the restaurant at 9:52 p.m. Thursday. They found the men at a nearby gas station 
 after they allegedly fled from the eatery. 
 Darrell Price, 19, and Tyjaun Seals, 19, were both charged with misdemeanor simple assault. 
 Joseph Mims, 21, and Kevin Price, 21, were both charged with disorderly conduct. Darrell Price and Seals are being held at the county jail. Mims and Kevin Price are free on $5,000 bail. 
 Besides the assault, police said, the unsuccessful salesman was refused dinner. 
 Police Capt. Shawn Patten said police learned the group of men work for Pargon Sales Midwest 
 Clearing out of Illinois.
 The group registered with the Police Department June 23 as required by state law so 
 they could do door-to-door soliciting in the area. Patten said police have 
 yet to get in touch with the company. None of the men had identification on 
 them and are believed to be from the Chicago area. 
 They all provided the same address, which was for the Doubletree Hotel in Lowell, Mass. 
 Patten said the department is taking steps to make sure they are banned from selling 
 again in town. He said business owners and residents should notify police if they 
 spot members of Pargon trying to sell magazines in town. By James A. Kimble

 SALEM Four door-to-door magazine salesmen were taken 
 into custody late Thursday evening in connection with a 
 large fight that broke out in a Wendy&apos;s parking lot at 
 9:52 p.m.
 Police charged Darrell Price and Tyjaun Seals, both 19, 
 with simple assault after stopping their fleeing vehicle 
 at the Hess station at the intersection of Route 28 and 
 Lake Street. Two other men, Joseph Mims and Kevin Price, 
 both 21, were charged with disorderly conduct.
 According to police, all four men work for the Pargon 
 Sales Midwest Clearing company, soliciting magazine 
 subscriptions in the Salem area. After failing to meet his 
 sales quota, one of the salesmen was allegedly refused 
 dinner and then beaten by his supervisor and a coworker.
 None of the four men could produce positive identification 
 and all only gave police the address of the Doubletree 
 Hotel in Lowell, Mass. Police believe the four men are 
 from Chicago.
 The group registered with the Salem Police Department as 
 per state law last Monday, and authorities are taking 
 steps to remove the men from the town. Attempts to contact 
 the company have been unsuccessful.
 Police are urging local business and area residents to 
 notify the department of any further contact with the

Magazine Salesman Assaults Police Officers

 Police: Man illegally selling magazines assaults Lowell officers
By Robert Mills, rmills@lowellsun.com
The Sun
Article Last Updated: 06/26/2008 06:41:21 AM EDT
 LOWELL -- A young man said he was in the neighborhood selling magazines, but he had no permit 

 to do so, and a neighbor called police after spotting the man lurking on the porch of a 

 Belvidere house where no one was home. 

 Officers soon found the man, Keylon Andrews, 22, of Indianapolis on Rae Street about 7:10 

 p.m. Using expletives, he told officers he didn&apos;t need a permit to sell magazines, police said. 

 Officers corrected him on that point, and when they informed Andrews that he was under arrest, 

 Andrews punched two officers in the head and continued to fight after he was pepper sprayed, 

 police said. 

 He was eventually handcuffed and brought back to the station, but the incident has police 

 reminding residents that anyone selling magazines or anything door to door should have 

 identification and a permit. 

 &quot;They have to be permitted, and they should display it upon demand,&quot; said Lt. Mark Buckley. 

 &quot;If they don&apos;t, call police.&quot; 

 Police did not release the address where the man was initially spotted lurking on the 

 porch because it is the home of a police officer who was not home at the time. 

 Police said Andrews also was allegedly spotted going into the yards of two other homes 

 despite the claim he was selling magazines. He is charged with two counts of assault and 

 battery on a police officer, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, violation of 

 bylaws or ordinances, peddling or hawking without a license, 

 and giving a false name to police. 

 A bail commissioner had not yet set bail for him last night. By Robert Mills, rmills@lowellsun.com

Magazine Sales Scam Alert !!!

 People beware of magazine scam
By KAREN KAMPWIRTH
Letter to the editor
Galesburg.com
Posted Jun 25, 2008 @ 11:04 AM
 People should keep on the look-out for a magazine sales scam. On a recent afternoon two 

 young men stopped by my house selling magazines, supposedly so they could win points 

 toward a trip to Europe.

 I agreed initially to renew a subscription but became more and more suspicious: they 

 tried to talk me into giving cash instead of a check (we get more points that way), 

 the check was to be made out to F.N.T. Inc. rather than to the name of the magazine, and 

 I couldnt find the name of the magazine I wanted on any of their printed lists, 

 even though they said they had it on their list. Apparently I asked too many 

 questions because they ended up voiding my form and walking away.

 So I went to my computer and did a search for F.N.T. better business bureau and 

 immediately came up with a Missouri TV news report on how lots of people paid for 

 magazines that never came and that there was no way to track these people down.

 The form says to make all inquiries to: ALWAYS HELPING PEOPLE LLC, P.O. Box 897, 

 Prosper, TX 75078.

 It also says to make all checks payable to F.N.T. Inc.

 It would be a shame if the many students who do legitimate fundraising for school 

 projects are tainted by this sort of thing. Just make sure that the check is to 

 be made out to a legitimate source, unlike this one. Karen Kampwirth, Galesburg galesburg.com

Men posing as school reps

 Men posing as school reps

Sherwood Park News
Tuesday June 24, 2008
 Strathcona County RCMP have been on the lookout for two suspicious males in the 

 region who have been approaching homeowners posing as school representatives.

 From the start of June, the two males had been going door-to-door speaking to home 

 occupants about purchasing various books and home study guides. Once inside the 

 home, the two discussed the products they were selling, then abruptly said they 

 had to leave and would return later that same day.

 Apparently they didnt produce any identification as to who they were representing, 

 said Strathcona County RCMP media liaison Const. Wally Henry.

 He said that in one instance after the males were invited inside the home, the resident 

 told them that she was soon to be on vacation, which is when the two made an excuse to leave.

 The people out in the rural areas were concerned that it was just two fellows trying to 

 scope out the place to see if there was a crime of opportunity.

 As door-to-door selling is still a common way to do business, residents should be 

 asking for identification from whomever they invite into their home.

 People have to be really careful as to who they let into their house, Const. Henry said.

 Just be aware that there are people out there who will prey on people who are too kind to them.

 There is no county permit currently needed to go door-to-door selling, but an Alberta sellers 

 license is required from the province.

 Const. Henry said that if anybody should come to the door, ask for his or her provincial 

 license to go door-to-door selling and ask for identification from the 

 organization they are representing. One of the males was caucasion, approximately 

 510 with brown hair in his late twenties. The second was Asian, approximately 58 

 with brown hair and also in his late twenties.

 The vehicle used was described as an older white sedan, possibly with a black strip and 

 British Columbia license plates.

 County RCMP are requesting the help of residents to obtain a license number should 

 anyone come across these individuals.

 If we could get a license plate of the vehicle they were in to provide to the police, 

 then that would be beneficial, Cons. Wally said.
Anyone who has information is asked to contact the RCMP at 467-7741.

 Fulton and Mexico Missouri
Door-to Door Magazine Sales Scam !!! 
 June 19, 2008 
 Door-to-door scams are obtaining business licenses
&apos;Always Helping People LLC&apos; sells magazine subscriptions, but no one ever receives their purchase
By Amelia Waters
KRCG-TV CBS
Thursday, June 19, 2008 at 4:14 p.m.
 Imagine you get a knock on your door, and there is a young man selling magazines subscriptions. 

 He claims he is trying to raise money for college and you are the only person who has been nice 

 to him. Through kindness you buy a subscription, but realize there is no contact 

 information for the company the salesman claimed to be with. You look online, 

 still nothing. Then you call city hall and find he did have a business license. 

The scenario is happening in Fulton and Mexico Missouri.

 On Wednesday KRCG reported a door-to-door scam. Young salesmen that are affiliating themselves 

 with the business &apos;Always Helping People LLC&apos; retrieved a business license to go to door-to-door.

 &quot;Basically a young man came to the door and he was selling magazines, but he didn&apos;t want 

 to get that point across as much as the company he was working for,&quot; stated Fulton resident Marcia Smith.

 The company &apos;Always Helping People LLC&apos; is based out of Prosper, Texas. But when writing out a 

 check to purchase subscriptions it is made to F.N.T Inc.

 After purchasing two subscriptions Marcia Smith decided to research the company. 

 Not finding anything online she called city hall, and found the young salesman did have a 

 business license.

 &quot;I questioned city hall a couple times, well how do you know he&apos;s legitimate? Or do you 

 do any background checks, or does it even run it through your Better Business Bureau? 

 And she answered no to all of that,&quot; said Smith.

 Smith stated the woman also said she assumes the salesmen would not go to the trouble to 

 get a business license if they were not legitimate.

 City leaders were unavailable for comment on camera today. So I checked around in other communities.

 I found getting a business license is surprisingly easy.

 &quot;The first thing we do is we ask you to fill out an application, then we&apos;d send you over 

 the highway patrol,&quot; said Steve Schlueter, director of finance for Jefferson City.

 A person needs to have two forms of id, with one photo id, if they clear a background 

 check they go back to the city clerks office, and if approved, they get a license.

 Giving a scenario to Schlueter I asked, &quot;Let&apos;s say I come and I want to go door-to-door and 

 sell magazine subscriptions, here&apos;s my drivers license, and I belong to this company with 

 no phone number, I have no record, that means I could door-to-door and scam people and then take off?&quot;

 &quot;You could, I mean if you fill all the obligations and there&apos;s no record, yes if you met 

 all that criteria you could go out and start soliciting,&quot; said Schlueter.

 Something to think about the next time someone comes knocking on your door.

 The Fulton city clerks office does ask for two forms of ID and does perform a background 

 check with the police.

 The Better Business Bureau in Dallas, Texas has 37 complaints in the last 36 months on 

 &apos;Always Helping People LLC.&apos; BBB officials said all the complaints are closed because 

 the company cannot be found.

 Law enforcement officials in Prosper, Texas said they tried sending a letter to the P.O. 

 Box the company claims to have as an address but it no longer exists. By Amelia Waters

 Town bylaw on door-to-door solicitors enforced
By Mary Ford

Cohasset Mariner
WickedLocal.com
 Cohasset -
Solicitors selling magazines had not realized they had crossed over from Hull into Cohasset last week. 

 Police talked with the individual in charge who knew about Cohassets bylaw requiring 

 solicitors to register with the police. Chief Hussey said police dealt with the same group last year.

 Police received several complaints from residents on Jerusalem Road, Black Rock Road and 

 Linden Drive, about the door-to-door solicitors.

 In responding to one of the calls, police ran a check on one of the solicitors, who was on 

 his way to West Corner to wait for a ride. The 45-year-old California man had two warrants 

 and he was arrested.

 Hussey said police encourage residents to call if they see door-to-door solicitors. Police 

 will know right then and there if the individual has registered. Police will also go out 

 to the reported location, explain the town bylaw, and tell the person to stop soliciting 

 until he or she registers.

 Under the town bylaw, door-to-door solicitors are required to register at the 

 police station where they can apply for a $25 license. They are required to wear a 

 badge issued by the police that includes their name and photograph. The badge should 

 be worn and be clearly visible.

 Solicitors have to provide police with their name, address, date of birth and height, 

 weight and eye color, Social Security number; dates and times of canvassing activities; 

 name and address of employer; and a brief description of the purposes of the solicitation.

 Exceptions to the bylaw are town, state or federal officers or employees on official business; 

 minors under 18 unless in connection with a commercial activity; candidates for public office 

 or campaign workers; those promoting political causes and those soliciting for charitable 

 organizations unless those solicitors are paid. By Mary Ford

 Updated: Door-to-door salesman in Hardin Valley surprised by school phone alert
Posted By: Katie Allison Granju
WBIR TV-10
WBIR.COM
June 14, 2008, 29 mins ago
 A door-to-door salesman working his way around West Knox County may have been misunderstood by some, 

 according to the sheriff&apos;s office, but not by Shelly Connard. 

 &quot;We loved this guy,&quot; the mother of three children explained. &quot;We even talked about him 

 after he left, how clean cut he was and mannerly, and how he&apos;s such a sweetheart.&quot; 

 Connard was leaving the house when the salesman first caught her, but she and 

 her husband arranged a time to meet later to look over the educational material he was selling. 

 &quot;He never said he was from the school system, but he did know a lot about the curriculum,&quot; 

 Connard explained &quot;We ended up getting the whole set. We talked with him afterward and 

 even invited him to dinner.&quot; 

 However, others were concerned by the sales pitch and contacted the Knox County School system. 

 It issued a warning to hundreds of people by phone Thursday, using its &quot;parent 

 notification system.&quot; The schools warned people to be on the look-out for 

 a man posing as a representative of Hardin Valley Academy. 

 When Connard read about the alert on wbir.com, she contacted 10News. 

 &quot;I immediately thought, &apos;No, people have totally misunderstood this guy,&apos;&quot; 

 Connard explains. &quot;When I saw the story, I was shocked and horrified, for him. 

 Here he is, a college student from Texas, living with a family here, and that&apos;s 

 the welcome he gets?&quot; 

 10News met up with Scott Steffen in Karns Friday while he was selling books 

 for Nashville-based company, Southwestern. 

 The description used by the schools warned of a man in his early 20s, clean shaven, 

 neatly dressed, wearing a ball cap, and carrying a folder. 

 Steffen matches that, and he also drives a blue-steel colored, older model Toyota 

 Camry that sits low to the ground because the trunk is loaded with books. 

 The Texas A&amp;M;senior says he&apos;ll graduate with a degree in Agricultural Engineering, 

 thanks to those books.

 Southwestern&apos;s director of communications says the company has been hiring college 

 students to sell its material since 1868. Right now, he says they have almost 

 3,000 student dealers spread out across the country. 

 And many, including Steffen, actually run from house to house to save time. 

 &quot;I&apos;ve done this now for five summers all around the Eastern U.S.,&quot; he explained. &quot;I&apos;ve 

 been to Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina and now Tennessee. And 

 through that, I&apos;ve been able to finance all of my college expenses.&quot; 

 Steffen says he gets college credit for showing the books to 30 families everyday. 

 Although, he says he works from 8 a.m. until 9:30 p.m. most days to meet that quota.

 He also says he tries to identify himself as a college student within the first 

 30 seconds of introducing himself to a potential customer. 

 &quot;That&apos;s one of the first thing I say, &apos;Hi, I&apos;m Scott, I&apos;m a college student from Texas,&quot; 

 Steffen explained. 

 Steffen wears a double-sided identification badge around his neck and he also 

 keeps a copy of the permit to sell door-to-door that he obtained from the 

 Knox County Clerk&apos;s Office. The Knox County Sheriff&apos;s Office runs local 

 background checks of everyone issued the permits. 

 &quot;I&apos;m supposed to be seeing all the families out here in the Karns and Hardin Valley 

 area with children ages high school down to babies to explain early learning tools,&quot; 

 Steffen delivered his sales pitch to a mother on her front porch. &quot;One thing I 

 find is all the moms are really into their kids&apos; education. How do you feel about the 

 schools out here?&quot; 

 Steffen says he can understand how some people could have thought he was with the schools. 

 &quot;I&apos;m obviously a door-to-door salesman,&quot; he explained. &quot;I&apos;m not the first person they 

 want to talk to, so they may not hear everything I say. I try to make it as clear as 

 possible I&apos;m not with the schools, but inevitably, people don&apos;t hear everything I say. 

 I tend to talk quickly.&quot; 

 Steffen says he&apos;s been misunderstood before, but in smaller communities 

 where he had an easier time making sure leaders knew who he was and what he was doing. 

 Steffen says his host family alerted him that he&apos;d made the news. He&apos;s living with a 

 local businessmen and two other college students who will also be selling books 

 in the area through mid-August. 

 &quot;I never knew anything about a calling alert,&quot; Steffen said. &quot;That&apos;s kind of neat.&quot; 

 The President and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Greater East 

 Tennessee says people should use common sense when dealing with door-to-door sales people. 

 &quot;I personally don&apos;t buy door-to-door,&quot; Jerry Tipton explained. &quot;Some people do. 

 There&apos;s nothing wrong with that, as long as it&apos;s a legitimate company.&quot; 

 Titpon says one should always ask what the person is selling and for whom. He says 

 potential customers should also ask to see the government-issued permit. 

 &quot;There is an element of danger sometimes,&quot; Tipton said. &quot;Don&apos;t let anyone in your 

 house unless you know who they are.&quot; 

 Tipton also cautions that the sales people often use high-pressure tactics. 

 If you do buy something, he says you should make sure any agreement you sign includes 

 a three-day &quot;cooling off period&quot; clause. By law, the consumer has three days to 

 change his or her mind. 

 Meanwhile, the Knox County Sheriff&apos;s Department has looked into the matter and determined 

 Steffen was legitimate. 

 &quot;He is not impersonating anybody,&quot; spokesperson Martha Dooley explained. 

 &quot;He is legitimate, and he has all the proper paperwork.&quot;

 Schools spokesperson Russ Oaks maintains the schools did the right thing by 

 issuing the alert to several hundred homes in the Hardin Valley area.

 &quot;If it had turned out some other way, you&apos;d be asking me why we didn&apos;t notify people,&quot; 

 Oaks said. &quot;It&apos;s absolutely appropriate to share information we have with the public.&quot; Posted By: Katie Allison Granju

 Triad Police Warn Neighbors of Door to Door Scam
Police say scam artists are going door to door selling phony magazine subscriptions in the Piedmont. 

 Rockingham County, NC - Police say scam artists are going door to door selling 

 phony magazine subscriptions in the Piedmont.

 Police say the schemers are as young as 16. The fake salesmen say they&apos;re raising 

 money to help fight an illness or a to pay for a class trip. They give you a sob 

 story and tell you they need a donation. Police say people open their check books 

 out of the goodness of their hearts and get conned out of hundreds of dollars. 

 &quot;We&apos;ve had some young people come into our county toward the Summerfield area asking 

 for donations so they could go on a trip and we found this not to be true,&quot; 

 said Dean Venable, the public information officer for the Rockingham County 

 Sheriff&apos;s Department. &quot;They make it so you&apos;ll want to help them, but be careful 

 about doing so,&quot; he said.

 Police say the magazine subscription scheme is an old trick that keeps resurfacing. 

 They warn neighbors to be on their guard.

 &quot;They&apos;re doing it to get money,&quot; said neighbor Kelly Buggins. But of course they 

 have a badge, you&apos;re going to believe them. But, I guess anybody can get a badge or 

 name tag,&quot; he said.

 &quot;They come up and say, come on buy it, it&apos;s good it&apos;s good and you know it&apos;s not good,&quot; 

 said Lacey Ore who lives on the same street.

 Police say the scheme spans the Triad. Investigators are looking into similar reports in 

 Alamance and Guilford Counties. 

 When it comes to opening the door for solicitors, Rockingham County deputies say to only 

 give donations to someone who you know and trust. They say never hand out your 

 credit card or checking information and ask for identification. Lastly, if you 

 are truly interested in purchasing a subscription, it&apos;s better to go directly 

 through the publisher. Posted by: Tracey McCain, Reporter

 St. Peter, Minnesota
Cleaner Product Door-to-Door Sales Alert !!! 
 June 12, 2008 
 Two men cited for selling door-to-door without a permit

stpeterherald.com
6/12/2008 11:06:00 AM ST. PETER - Two men from out of town were cited by St. Peter Police for cited on June 6 

 for trying to sell cleaning products door-to-door without permission from city officials.

 Ethan Michael Rasmussen, 18, of Sioux Falls, S.D., and Dontrail Lamonte Potter, 23, of 

 Norfolk, Va., were cited for soliciting without a permit. 

 Police received a report that day from a resident in the Pine Pointe area of two males 

 going door-to-door trying to sell cleaning products. Police eventually located the two 

 suspects near the area of Washington Avenue and Riverview Road.

 The officer found the men in possession of one container of a multi-purpose 

 cleaning product and two containers of a super-concentrated cleaner they were trying 

 to sell. A bi-fold, which contained order forms for the products, were also found.

 Selling door-to-door is not allowed without a peddler&apos;s permit, which solicitors need to 

 obtain from the St. Peter Community Development Office at city hall (227 South Front Street).

 &quot;Those applying for the permit have to pay a bond and we do a background check on them,&quot; 

 Barb Luker, of the St. Peter City Administrator&apos;s Office, said. &quot;If they do get 

 approved for the permit they have to carry it with them when they are going 

 around town and if the resident asks to see it they have to present it.

 &quot;The reason we ask for the bond and do the check is to protect our residents in case 

 something goes wrong with the product they buy.&quot;

 According to Luker, solicitors who park a vehicle in a parking lot and try to sell 

 out of that location also are required to register through the Community Development 

 Office before doing any business. That kind of license is called a transient merchant permit.

 &quot;People should be reminded to always to use caution when dealing with these kinds of 

 sales people and to be sure to ask to see their permit before buying anything,&quot; 

 Luker said. &quot;If anyone sees anything suspicious or someone can&apos;t produce the 

 permit then they should to contact the police department (931-1550) because 

 those people will be cited.&quot; St. Peter Herald Interactive and Minnesota River Valley Shopper

 Rockingham Co. Police Warn Against Door-To-Door Sales Fraud

POSTED: 7:42 pm EDT June 11, 2008
UPDATED: 9:05 pm EDT June 11, 2008
 WENTWORTH, N.C. -- The Rockingham County Sheriffs Office warned residents on Wednesday to beware 

 of door-to-door magazine sales.

 There have been reports of a young person falsely selling magazines, books or accepting 

 donations for a good cause, police said. Most recently, the person said that they were 

 trying to earn money for a school trip to Europe.

 Police said the people knocking on doors are most often young adults who say theyre 

 the child of a neighbor or live nearby. 

 Detective Dana Taylor said these people have also misrepresented themselves in Guilford County. 

 They give false information to obtain checks from people. Taylor said residents should beware.

 The best practice is to not engage in conversation and call police, Taylor said. She said, 

 in this age of identity theft and fraud, residents should not give out personal information to door-

 to-door salespeople. WXII12

City warns of sales scams

 City warns of sales scams
Door-to-door dangers noted

 She thought she was going to hear a sales pitch; instead, a Jefferson County woman was sexually 

 assaulted by a man she let into her apartment after he told her he was a magazine salesman.

The woman was a victim of a fraudulent door-to-door solicitation, a national 

 problem that&apos;s worrisome for Louisville because it&apos;s part of &quot;the circuit,&quot; 

 Officer Dave Dahl said.

City officials held a press conference yesterday to warn residents about these and less 

 severe scams by phony door-to-door salespeople as part of &quot;Keep Louisville Safe,&quot; 

 a public-awareness campaign that features a new topic every month.

Crews of illegitimate solicitors come through Louisville before big events such as Thunder Over 

 Louisville, Dahl said.

Some intend to get inside someone&apos;s house to harm them or steal items such as checkbooks or 

 electronics, he said.

Some companies recruit college-aged people, who end up scammed themselves and never see 

 any profit, Dahl said. He said the crews are given speeches every morning, and they 

 even sing songs and shout cheers.

&quot;It&apos;s really a cult-like environment,&quot; he said.

Mayor Jerry Abramson said illegitimate salespeople sell anything from cell phones to 

 lawn care to magazines.

He said there have been instances of solicitors pretending to want work to get inside 

 the house so they can look around, planning to burglarize it later.

There also have been cases where a solicitor took money in advance, but the consumer 

 didn&apos;t receive the promised product, he said.

Police Chief Robert White said citizens should not let salespeople in the house and should 

 call the police if they have any problems with someone being aggressive.

&quot;We&apos;re asking citizens to exercise their boundaries,&quot; he said.

Residents can reduce the chance of becoming a victim of fraudulent solicitors by simply 

 asking to see their permit and references, Abramson said.

&quot;Be skeptical from the get-go,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid to slam the door.&quot;

Readers can reach reporter Michelle Day at mday@courier-journal.com.

------------------------------------------

Mayor Jerry Abramson, Police Chief Robert White and Diane Looney of the city&apos;s Inspections, 

 Permits and Licenses agency said residents can take precautions against fraudulent 

 door-to-door solicitors.

Don&apos;t be a victim

 City officials offered these tips to prevent becoming a victim of an illegitimate solicitor:

You don&apos;t have to open the door.

Ask to see a permit and references.

Be skeptical.

Shut the door and call police if the solicitor becomes aggressive.

Always have a phone in hand, and make the solicitor think you&apos;re talking to someone.

Never open the door for a stranger until the person has stepped off the porch.

 Miami, Flroida
Salesman&apos;s death in Miami felt in Hawaii 
 June 8, 2008 
 HAWAII
Salesman&apos;s death in Miami felt in Hawaii
The death of salesman Robert Spruiell in Miami-Dade has
sent shock waves on a rural Hawaiian island going through
tough economic times.

BY DAVID OVALLE
dovalle@MiamiHerald.com
Miami Herald
Posted on Sun, Jun. 08, 2008
 In the coming weeks, Robert Spruiell&apos;s family will spread his ashes on a nine-acre piece of earth 

 where he hoped to retire. The land sits atop a hill, its back to the Kamalo mountains, the 

 rest a stunning view of four Hawaiian islands. This is Molokai.

Spruiell traced his heritage to this 260-square-mile 

island of only 7,500 people, mostly native Hawaiians, who 

pride themselves on living more like their ancestors than 

the over-Americanized isles.

Along the way, he bought the Paddlers Inn Restaurant and 

Bar, a vital employer and the island&apos;s sole night spot.

But a trip to South Florida marred his quest to reconnect 

with his Hawaiian roots.

Spruiell, the owner of various door-to-door magazine 

subscription sales companies in Arizona, was killed May 

18 at the Golden Nugget Hotel, 18555 Collins Ave.

He and another employee, Jeremy Johnson, 22, had gone to 

confront a guest who they believed had been selling drugs 

to their salespeople staying in the hotel.

 DEATH IN MIAMI 

In the confrontation, Jesus Cisneros, 42, stabbed 

Spruiell to death and slashed Johnson about seven times.

Because Spruiell and Johnson committed kidnapping and 

occupied burglary by breaking into Cisneros&apos; room, police 

say, Johnson is being held responsible for the death.

He is charged with second-degree felony murder. His 

arraignment in Miami-Dade Circuit Court is Tuesday. He 

had pleaded not guilty.

Spruiell&apos;s story, by all accounts, spanned the globe.

His father, a U.S. Navy seaman, met his wife while 

stationed on the islands. She hailed from the large and 

well-known Kamakana clan of Molokai. Her father, Henry 

Kamakana Sr., was a renowned pro tennis player.

Spruiell grew up in Washington state and spent summers in 

Hawaii.

&apos;&apos;As he grew up, Hawaiian family was around all the time. 

He had a lot of respect for the Hawaiian culture,&apos;&apos; said 

his father, Bob Spruiell Sr.

Spruiell also served in the U.S. Navy during the first 

Gulf War. An Arizona resident, he later owned a series of 

door-to-door sales companies, traveling the country 

overseeing young people selling magazine subscriptions.

While the industry brought bad publicity -- his company 

was sued this year by Albuquerque, N.M., after two 

associated salespeople were charged with murder -- he 

found refuge in Hawaii.

Four years ago, Spruiell returned to Hawaii to visit 

family. As he hit middle age, his interest in his island 

roots grew, said his 54-year-old uncle, Pete Gonsalves.

Gonsalves decribed island life and its people this way: 

``The ocean is the ice box, the mountain is where they 

get substance from deer and pig. Molokai is a 

self-sustaining place and that&apos;s why a lot of people are 

able to get by.&apos;&apos;

Though much of his family lived in Oahu, Spruiell visited 

Molokai to visit remaining members and fell for the 

island&apos;s traditional style.

After just one day, he bought the land where he hoped to 

build his retirement home. He also hoped to bring his 

Molokai-native mother, Haunani Kamakana, to live with him 

there.

&apos;&apos;He wanted to give back to his Hawaiian heritage, be 

part of the community,&apos;&apos; Gonsalves said.

Molokai is a unique place.

The fish-shaped island, smack center in the island chain, 

boasts spectacular sea cliffs, lush rain forests and a 

twin-tiered waterfall called Moaula Falls.

It was also home to Kalaupapa, a historic former colony 

for people suffering from leprosy, or Hansens&apos; disease.

Molokai is sparesly populated. Known as &apos;&apos;the most 

Hawaiian island,&apos;&apos; Molokai does not draw the honeymooners 

and vacationers like the islands of Oahu and Maui.

&apos;&apos;The people here don&apos;t want to be like the rest of the 

islands. We&apos;ve been fighting development for 30 years,&apos;&apos; 

said well-known Molokai activist Walter Ritte. ``All the 

islands have been developed to a high extent. This is the 

only island that hasn&apos;t been developed. It&apos;s really rural 

-- that is by design.&apos;&apos;

But these days, the island has been in tumult.

The Molokai Ranch, which owns 66,000 acres, or a third of 

the island, was thwarted in an attempt to build luxury 

homes. So it closed its cattle and resort businesses, 

including a lodge, bungalows, a golf course and a movie 

theater.

More than 100 workers lost their jobs. Last week, the 

ranch sounded alarms by announcing it would stop water 

and sewer services, affecting some 1,200 customers.

 HAWAIIAN PLANS 

With this troubled atmosphere as a backdrop, Spruiell -- 

whose Hawaiian name is Kamuela Kamakana -- had hoped to 

make a difference last October with the purchase of the 

Paddlers.

A novice in the restaurant business, he had revamped the 

kitchen, upgraded the sound system, and added live 

concerts and poker and movie nights.

&apos;&apos;We don&apos;t make a lot of money, but we&apos;re just here for 

the community. He is going to be missed here,&apos;&apos; 

restaurant administrator Alicia Montemayor said after his 

death.

Molokai Ranch closed, the Paddlers is now the only place 

to serve a social hub after hours. It also employs 43 

people, not an insignificant number on an island where 

the unemployment is now hovering about 10 percent.

&apos;&apos;Every little thing now becomes a big thing. Every job 

counts. Not only that, it&apos;s a good place for people to 

let out their frustrations, to eat and to have a good 

time. Somewhere to go in the evening,&apos;&apos; said activist 

Ritte.

For now, Paddlers will continue to operate as usual, his 

family said.

The Paddlers website, in his honor, put up a slide show 

of photos taken during Spruiell&apos;s April visit.

By month&apos;s end, family members will take a ferry to 

Molokai, to his property in the Kamalo mountains, to 

spread his ashes.

Later, Gonsalves and a friend, Kanalu Young, a professor 

at the University of Hawaii, will compose prayers and 

bless the land.

And in the coming weeks, a probate court in Arizona, 

where Spruiell lived, will look at his properties and 

businesses to figure out how they will be distributed 

among his heirs. After that, no one is quite sure what 

will happen to the Paddlers.

&apos;&apos;The family wants the restaurant to succeed,&apos;&apos; Bob 

Spruiell Sr. said.

 Scams Use Berkeley High Athletics in Oakland, Kensington
By Riya Bhattacharjee
The Berkeley Daily Planet
Thursday June 05, 2008
 Berkeley Unified School District officials said they uncovered an athletic fundraising scam on 

 Friday, when a resident of Glenview in Oakland called to report that a young man was going 

 door to door saying he was raising money for the Berkeley High School baseball team to visit Maui. 

 The man said he was a Berkeley High student and a member of the baseball team, 

 neither of which is true, according to school officials. 

 According to the resident, the man was offering neighbors the chance to receive books 

 on literacy in exchange for $100 to $500, district spokesperson Mark Coplan said. 

 Coplan said another caller reported a young man selling magazine subscriptions 

 in Kensington to help fund the Berkeley High swim teams trip to Hawaii. 

 The man, the caller said, said he was a member of the swim team and the son of a 

 neighbor who lived down the street. 

 The caller remembered later her neighbor did not have a son similar in age to the young 

 man and called Berkeley High Athletic Director Kristen Glencher to alert her. 

 Coplan said the young man told neighbors he was representing the magazine subscription 

 company Quality Services, Inc. (QSI). 

 The trip to Hawaii and any connection to Berkeley High School is not true, 

 and there is no reason to believe that these youths are actually Berkeley High students, 

 said Coplan, adding that all team fundraising efforts would seek checks made out to the 

 Berkeley Athletic Fund, the Berkeley High School Development Group or the Berkeley Public 

 Education Foundation. They would never ask for cash, he said. 

 The moment a fundraiser encourages you to give cash instead of checks, saying 

 cash is easier for nonprofits to process, it should raise a red flag, Coplan said. 

 The district has warned residents about various scams involving people 

 claiming to be raising money for schools in the past. District officials have continually 

 warned community members against offering donations to a man who goes by the name Marcus Robinson. 

 Robinson has reportedly been going around Berkeley neighborhoods for 20 years, 

 asking for donations for a program he calls the Bay Area Scholastic Improvement Center, 

 or BASIC, Coplan said. 

 I havent heard from Robinson in three to four months, he said. 

 The athletic thing is a regular occurrence during this time of the year, 

 so its important to warn the community. 

 Questions about school fundraising efforts should be directed to the Berkeley High 

 Athletic Department at 644-8723 or the Public Information Office at 644-6320. By Riya Bhattacharjee

Batavia considers transient vendor policy

 Batavia considers transient vendor policy
BY JUSTIN B. DUKE | JBDUKE@COMMUNITYPRESS.COM
communitypress.com
Last Updated: 7:38 am | Thursday, June 5, 2008
 BATAVIA TWP. - The trustees wants to crack down on transient vendors.

According to Ohio Revised Code, a transient vendor is a person who opens a temporary 

 place of business, or travels around the township to sell, offer for sale or solicit 

 the order for future delivery of goods.

 Trustee Lee Cornett was concerned about allowing unknown vendors coming into Batavia. 

 He didn&apos;t want a vendor to attack a resident while going door-to-door and the 

 responsibility to fall on the township.

 &quot;I don&apos;t think we should give these people permits because it gives them an air 

 of legitimacy,&quot; Cornett said.

 The trustees discussed two types of transient vendors in the township, a door-to-door 

 vendor and a vendor who sets up on the side of the road and sells out of a vehicle.

 It will be challenging to enforce any kind of resolution when a person is selling 

 vegetables out of a vehicle, said Trustee Archie Wilson.

 &quot;That man doesn&apos;t come to me and ask for a permit,&quot; said Zoning Administrator 

 Denise Kelley.

 Selling on the side of the road is a very different issue from vendors going door-to-door, 

 said Trustee Deborah Clepper.

 &quot;I&apos;m not sure what we can do to stop them, but I tell you one thing - I&apos;m not going 

 to vote to allow them,&quot; Cornett said.

 Wilson wasn&apos;t sure what rights the township legally had to deal with transient 

 vendors, and asked the board to wait on passing any ordinance until more research was done.

 The trustees voted to move forward with a transient vendor policy. The township attorney 

 will be consulted to see how restrictive a policy can be.

 &quot;I want to be as restrictive as possible,&quot; Clepper said. BY JUSTIN B. DUKE | JBDUKE@COMMUNITYPRESS.COM

Published: June 5, 2008
 Martinsville Police are warning families in the city and Henry County to be cautious if 

 approached by a an unlicense solicitor. 

 Officers say a group has been going door to door selling magazine subscriptions, encyclopedias, 

 and possibly other publications. Police say the group claims to be a representative of a 

 firm based in Phoenix. 

 Their sales pitch may include something about a soccer team, hospitalized children or 

 a trip to London, Acapulco, Hawaii or some other exotic destination. 

 They have not obtained the proper permits for soliciting in the City of Martinsville. 

 We advise citizens to check credentials of any door-to-door sales people. 

 Ask to see their company identification and their local (Martinsville or Henry County) 

 solicitors permit, said MPD Sergeant Marshall Farley in a news release. 

 Officers add that some of these solicitors use high pressure tactics. 

 Officers want you to call 911 if you feel uncomfortable, and have an 

 officer come out and check the person who is soliciting. WSLS News Staff

Posted on Thu, Jun. 05, 2008
 A magazine solicitor was arrested in Nipomo on Wednesday after he allegedly entered a woman&apos;s 

 house and pulled out a handgun, demanding sex. 

 The woman was home with her children on Spruce Lane in Nipomo around 1 p.m. when 

 Rafael Deshawn Joseph, 22, came to her door to sell magazines, according to the Sheriff&apos;s 

 Department. Once at the door, Joseph allegedly asked if he could use the restroom and was 

 allowed in the house. 

 While the woman showed Joseph the bathroom, he allegedly produced what appeared to be 

 a handgun and demanded sex. A struggle ensued, according to sheriff&apos;s officials, 

 and Joseph allegedly lost control of the weapon and fled the house. 

 Deputies responding to the incident found Joseph attempting to leave the area. 

 A replica handgun was found inside the house.

 Joseph worked for Urban Nation Enterprises, according to the Sheriff&apos;s Department. 

 He was booked into County Jail on suspicion of burglary and attempted rape. 

 Bail was set at $100,000. 

 Sheriff&apos;s officials remind people not to let strangers into their home. Criminals often 

 use magazine sales or other ruses - such as needing directions or needing to use the restroom - 

 to commit crimes. Larissa Doust

 NIPOMO
A man is behind bars after San Luis Obispo County Sheriff&apos;s deputies say he tried to rape 

 a woman inside her home in Nipomo. 

 Deputies say the man was selling magazines when he asked to come inside, then 

 flashed an apparent weapon and demanded sex from the woman. 

 Deputies say the attack happened this afternoon at about one 1:00 p.m. on Spruce Lane in Nipomo. 

 Many of the neighbors said they first heard about the attack on Action News. 

 They said they recognized the man, and they said he knocked on their doors, too. 

 One neighbor said, &quot;Oh my God, that&apos;s that guy I can&apos;t believe it. I opened my door to this guy.... 

 alone with my baby and my friend.&quot;

 Another neighbor, Andrea Fista, said, &quot;Now I&apos;m going to think twice about opening the door. 

 I sort of kind of did before, but I really didn&apos;t put too much in it. But if people are 

 breaking into houses and stuff, that&apos;s really scary.&quot;

 Deputies say Joseph approached a home on Spruce Lane in Nipomo where he was apparently 

 selling magazines. 

 Then, he allegedly asked a woman if he could come in her home to use the bathroom. 

 While inside, deputies say Joseph showed the woman what appeared to be a handgun and demanded sex. 

 Deputies say a struggle broke out, and he ran away. Soon after, deputies arrested him. 

 They say the handgun turned out to be a fake. 

 Still, the incident has the neighbors on edge, warning their children about the dangers of 

 opening the door to strangers. 

 &quot;They&apos;re not allowed to open the door for anybody. They&apos;re not even allowed to ask 

 who it is,&quot; said Fista.

 &quot;I&apos;m always alone at the house. Just me and my one year old daughter, so I have to 

 be really careful now,&quot; said another neighbor.

 Deputies say the woman had her children inside the home with her at the time that 

 they say Joseph was tormenting her. 

 Joseph is being held in San Luis Obispo county jail on $100,000 bail. He&apos;s 

 being charged with attempted rape and burglary. Reported by: Kory Raftery

 Yomiuri, Japan
Draft to ban door-to-door sales 
 June 3, 2008 
 Draft to ban door-to-door sales / Akita Pref.
ordinance aims to stop unscrupulous people tricking elderly
Etsuo Hayakawa and Hideharu Tabuchi / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers
June 3, 2008
 The outline of a draft ordinance to ban door-to-door sales has been drawn up by members 

 of the Akita Prefectural Assembly, but this has some people up in arms as they believe 

 such a measure would dampen business activity. 

 The envisioned ordinance is designed to prevent elderly people from being tricked 

 into buying expensive and high-risk financial instruments from unscrupulous salespeople 

 without understanding the details. 

 In February, eight prefectural assembly members drafted an outline of the ordinance to 

 ban salespeople from making uninvited visits to homes, effectively meaning they could 

 not do so without prior arrangement. 

 The proposed ordinance will ban all salespeople from visiting, faxing, telephoning 

 and e-mailing those aged 65 or older as well as minors. 

 However, anyone regardless of age can stop visits and telephone calls from salespeople 

 selling products requiring consumers to pay 5,000 yen or more in monthly installments by 

 registering with the prefectural government, according to the draft ordinance. 

 If the ordinance is adopted, door-to-door sales of stocks and other financial products, 

 that do not guarantee the refunding of principals, will be prohibited.

===

Prison terms, fines considered

Salespeople who violate the ordinance may face suspension of business, imprisonment for up to 

 two years or a fine up to 1 million yen. 

 Elderly people and those who do not want to be bothered by such visits can post a notice on 

 their front door. 

 Salespeople who want to telephone, fax or e-mail potential clients will have to confirm 

 in advance with the prefectural government to see whether households will permit such sales calls. 

 In 2004, the bar association in Akita Prefecture submitted to the prefectural governor 

 and the speaker of the prefectural assembly, a proposal to incorporate the right to 

 refuse uninvited door-to-door visits into the existing prefectural ordinance for the 

 protection of consumers. 

 In the United States, a system was established in 2003 to allow consumers to refuse 

 uninvited telephone sales calls once they had registered with the local governments. 

 Inspired by the U.S. move, some Akita Prefectural Assembly members began work on 

 introducing a similar system in 2005. 

 In 2006, a futures company in Akita collected money from more than 200 elderly people 

 who bought U.S. commodity futures and options by telephoning and visiting potential clients. 

 After it was revealed that the company failed to repay more than 2 billion yen, calls for 

 implementation of an ordinance to protect people from unscrupulous sales gained momentum. 

 Eiichi Setagawa, a 60-year-old assembly member who sponsored the proposed ordinance, 

 said visits by these door-to-door salespeople had to be stopped to prevent them from taking 

 advantage of consumers. 

 Lawyer Naoto Omi, who helped compile the outline, said it was more important to protect 

 people&apos;s safety and their right to protect their property, than the freedom of salespeople to conduct their business. &quot;That means door-to-door sales has to be curtailed,&quot; he said. 

 However, some people have raised questions about the envisioned ordinance. 

 According to the outline, products that require payments of 5,000 yen or less a month, 

 such as newspapers and dairy products, are exempted from the envisaged ordinance, 

 with the exception of the elderly. 

 But those who register to refuse uninvited visits from salespeople could mistakenly turn 

 away people selling newspapers and dairy products.

===

Controls to hurt insurance firms

Furthermore, no decision has been made on the 4,600 insurance salespeople in the prefecture. 

 Restrictions on their sales activities will significantly affect employment and tax revenues. 

 In addition, tighter controls on sales activities could undermine seven companies, 

 which have set up call centers after the prefectural government invited them to do so. 

 Other companies may also invest in other prefectures instead of doing business in Akita Prefecture. 

 On March 11 and May 20, a group of assembly members, including those who sponsored the 

 ordinance, collected public comments from 13 sectors, including banks, securities houses, 

 life and nonlife insurers, local agricultural cooperatives, automobile dealers, newspaper 

 sales agencies and door-to-door marketing firms. 

 With the exception of two organizations, including the federation of the prefectural 

 elderly people&apos;s clubs, all the groups opposed the outline. 

 An official of the Life Insurance Association of Japan said only a small number of 

 salespeople are responsible for unscrupulous sales. &quot;It&apos;s preposterous to ban all sales 

 activities, including those by conscientious salespeople,&quot; he said. 

 An official of the Japan Securities Dealers Association said the envisioned ordinance 

 would prevent securities houses from providing useful information to elderly people, who are interested in making investments for their retirement. 

 Their comments supported the view that such an ordinance would hurt consumers as well. 

 An official of the Japan Direct Selling Association said it was unclear 

 whether the ordinance would keep unscrupulous salespeople away as a notice placed on 

 the front door of a residence would only alert salespeople to the fact that senior 

 citizens lived there. &quot;Unscrupulous salespeople would target such residents,&quot; he said. 

 Such objections have prompted some assembly members to have second thoughts about 

 approving the outline as many problems need to be solved. 

 An outline of the ordinance was scheduled to be submitted to the assembly in September 

 by the assembly members and implemented in April, but this is highly unlikely now. 

 Tsuneo Matsumoto, a Hitotsubashi University law professor who is a member of the central 

 government&apos;s Consumer Administration Promotion Council, said consumer distrust was the 

 reason for the compilation of the ordinance. 

 &quot;Companies did not make sufficient efforts to clean up their businesses,&quot; he said. 

 However, he said many problems remain as the outline fails to discriminate between 

 businesses engaged in door-to-door sales. 

 Although consumer protection is a very important issue, excessive restrictions 

 would have adverse effects. Therefore, the Akita Prefectural Assembly must 

 debate the issue extremely carefully.

===

Concerns about side-effects

The ordinance outline contains measures that are tougher than the special trade law 

 governing door-to-door sales and mail sales, and the Financial Instruments and Exchange 

 Law regulating dealings involving financial products. 

 The central government&apos;s ministries supervising the relevant laws are concerned about 

 adverse effects caused by stricter regulations. 

 The revised Building Standards Law, which went into effect in June and made approval 

 of construction plans tougher, has resulted in a rapid decline in the number of new housing starts. 

 Since the Construction and Transport Ministry was criticized for creating a 

 &quot;government-triggered economic slump&quot; in the construction industry, the government is 

 concerned that a second government-initiated economic downturn could result if the 

 Akita Prefectural Assembly passed the ordinance. 

 A bill to revise the special trade law submitted by the Economy, Trade and 

 Industry Ministry to the current Diet session only states that salespeople are 

 obliged to make efforts to affirm whether consumers are willing to see them. 

 A ministry official said an across-the-board ban on uninvited sales activities 

 would undermine efforts by legitimate, conscientious salespeople and have an 

 impact on local economies. 

 A senior official of the Financial Services Agency also said restrictions imposed 

 by each prefecture could contradict the central government&apos;s policy of promoting deregulation. 

 The outline has brought to light the possible side effects that such a document 

 could have on both local economies and consumers.

 Bandera, Texas
An out-of-towner has come a&apos;knockin 
Door-To-Door Sales Company: Southwestern Company

 An out-of-towner has come a&apos;knockin
By Jessica Hawley-Jerome
Managing Editor Tuesday, June 3, 2008 8:33 AM CDT
The Bandera Bulletin
 In response to a community alert sent out last week, a visiting door-to-door salesman has 

 come out and come forward with his identity, nature of business and bonded intention. 

 His presence came to the attention of Bandera ISD and local law authorities as a potential 

 threat, though he claims to be nothing of the kind.

 Derrick Martin, Jr., who lives in North Carolina and attends North Carolina State University, 

 said that this is his fourth summer spent selling books as an independent contractor for 

 Southwestern Company, an intern-based wholesale business. He refutes the rumor that he has 

 represented himself as a member of Bandera ISD, stating that his only reference to the 

 district has been by using names of customers with school children who have purchased his 

 books. He has previously sold books in Indianapolis, Ind., Quincy, Ill., and Arlington.

 Martin, who is reportedly living with host family Quinn and George Tabbert on Elm Cove Drive 

 in Lakehills, said he was bonded by The Southwestern Company for $2,500 on May 28, and the 

 bond will remain in effect until the end of the year. Bandera County Sheriff&apos;s Investigator 

 George Wintle reported that Martin has no active warrants and no felony record. Martin said 

 he was in the area only to sell educational books door to door.

 The county does not have any licensing or permit requirements for door-to-door sales, 

 however, the city does prohibit such activities. According to Bandera City Administrator 

 Gene Forester, peddlers are only allowed to call upon commercial businesses in the commercial 

 district, per city ordinance.

 &quot;No door-to-door or house-to-house solicitation is allowed - period,&quot; Forester said. 

 &quot;We are trying to protect our citizens.&quot;

 Forester also said that if any person who lives in the residential district of the city is 

 approached by a door-to-door salesperson, they can call the police to ask them to leave. By Jessica Hawley-Jerome

Former employee faces charges in Spruiell murder

 Former employee faces charges in Spruiell murder
By Kate Gardiner
The Molokai Times
Molokai News : Crime
6/2/2008 10:07:59 PM

 Johnson charged due to circumstances of the crime 

Jeremy Johnson, 22, was charged May 20 with the murder of Molokai business owner Robert 

 Spruiell, known locally as Kamuela Kamakana. The 38-year old Spruiell was in Miami 

 with his door-to-door magazine selling business May 18. Johnson, an employee, told 

 Spruiell that he suspected Jesus Cisneros, 42, of selling drugs to his crew, a 

 group of young men and women working under Johnson. 

 Together, Spruiell and Johnson chose to confront Cisneros in the adjacent hotel room at the 

 Golden Nugget Hotel, 18555 Collins Ave., Miami. 

 According to the Miami Herald, Spruiell and Johnson broke into Cisneross hotel room, and a 

 fight broke out. Cisneros told police he grabbed a knife to defend himself against his attackers. 

 Spruiell was stabbed, and stumbled out onto the hotels balcony, where he died. 

 Johnson and Cisneros were both rushed to the hospital with non-life threatening 

 injuries. After treatment for his wound, Johnson was arrested by the Miami-Dade 

 Police Department. He was then charged with second-degree felony murder, armed burglary 

 and the armed kidnapping of Cisneros. 

 Though Johnson did not actually wield the knife that killed Spruiell, he was charged with 

 second-degree murder. The theory of the crime, which is how prosecutors and police 

 decide what to charge individuals with, puts Johnson on the scene as the instigator 

 of circumstances that lead to Spruiells death. 

 According to Florida law, if a felony is committed, for example, burglary or kidnapping, 

 and someone dies, any accomplices to the original crime can be charged with second-degree 

 felony murder. In Johnsons case, the original crimes lead to the alleged felony burglary 

 and kidnapping. According to the statute, Johnson faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. 

 He awaits trial at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami. By Kate Gardiner

 SPOKANE Washington
BBB Alert Door to Door Magazine Sales !!!
 June 2, 2008 
 Lone Star Subscriptions aka LSS INC.
SELLING MAGAZINES DOOR-TO-DOOR IN SPOKANE:
COMPANY HAS UNSATISFACTORY BBB REPORT
Spokane, Washington BBB
6/2/2008
 Lone Star Subscriptions aka LSS INC.
4800 Hwy 377 South
Aubrey, TX 76227
(940) 365-0089
FAX: (940) 365-0206

It has been brought to the BBB&apos;s attention that the above mentioned magazine door-to-door 

 sale company is soliciting Spokane area residents. Here is the scenario:
A rep for this company came to the door selling magazine subscriptions. His card said he was 

 an independent contractor for the above company. She was told the company was on 

 &quot;Donald Trump&apos;s Fortune 500 list.&quot; His name was Joe and he put a sticker on her door 

 telling her this was to make sure no one else knocked on the door. He told her he was 

 getting points towards a vacation.

 She subscribed to Family Fun magazine for herself and a friend. She paid him $1 

 cash and made out a check for $80. It was to be a 2 year subscription, but the 

 receipt says 3 issues. 

 Based on BBB Dallas files, this company has an unsatisfactory record with the BBB due 

 to failure to respond to one or more complaints and or two or more otherwise complaints. 

 However the business has resolved most complaints presented to the BBB.

TIPS

Consumers are encouraged to be cautious when approached by door-to-door solicitors, 

 even if they appear to be representatives of local schools or organizations. If 

 you are approached by a solicitor, the BBB offers the following tips:
Obtain the name and address of the school/organization that the person purports to represent. 

 If the person does not know the name of the business or the circumstances suggest a 

 youth-based or sales representative group, ask for references.

If the person is a youth claiming to be a student at a certain school, contact the school 

 while he/she is present to confirm their student status. If you find the information 

 to be false, contact the local police department. Be sure to get license plate numbers 

 and a description of the person and report it immediately.

If the person claims to represent a specific organization, be sure to check the reliability 

 of the organization with the Better Business Bureau.

If you decide to purchase items or donate money, do not give cash and be sure to 

 make checks payable only to the school/organization. Never make checks payable to 

 the individual or a third party.

Get all details and oral promises in writing and carefully review it. Make sure you 

 understand everything in the contract.

Make sure the salesperson provides you with the proper &quot;notice of cancellation&quot; 

 forms if you are solicited at your home. This is required by the Federal Trade Commission.

If anyone is going door-to-door asking for cash donations, consider this a red 

 flag and think twice before donating. Do your research first before giving. Spokane, Washington BBB

BBB Alert !!!

 Company posing as a Charity Sells Magazines Door-to-Door.
Roanoke BBB
roanoke.bbb.org
5/1/2008
 A door-to-door magazine sales operation is making its way through western Virginia. 

 Consumers have reported young people in a job training program going door to door 

 soliciting magazine sales. The representative shares a little about his or her life 

 and how the charity is providing valuable job training skills. Next thing the consumers know, 

 they have purchased several magazines from this friendly young salesperson. 

 Consumers have stated that the sales representatives claim the company is a charity whose 

 proceeds go towards an adult job training program. Charities must be registered with the 

 Office of Consumer Affairs in the Commonwealth of Virginia. This company is not registered 

 to solicit as a charity. Each individual sales representative is required to obtain a peddlers license. 

 To date, the BBB has been unable to verify if these licenses have been obtained. In addition, 

 if the company has employees that are under the age of 18, it must be registered with the 

 Virginia Department of Labor. 

 Dedicated Turn Around, L.L.C. is located in Gainesville, FL. 

 It is not registered with State of Florida as charity. The Jacksonville BBB does not 

 have any information on the company at this time. The firm is NOT a BBB Accredited Business. 

 Consumers should be aware that many door-to-door magazine sales often involve hidden costs, 

 said Julie Wheeler, president of the BBB Serving Western Virginia. Unscrupulous salespeople 

 sometimes trick consumers into purchasing multi-year magazine subscriptions costing hundreds 

 of dollars. When a salesperson offers a package of magazines for a few dollars a week, it may 

 sound like a real bargain, but it may include inflated prices and subscriptions stretching over 

 several years. 

 Consumers should use caution before agreeing to these types of offers. 

 If contacted by a telemarketer or door-to door salesperson soliciting magazine 

 subscriptions, use these guidelines:

Listen carefully to the initial sales presentation.

Ask to see the salespersons peddlers license.

Don&apos;t be afraid to interrupt and ask questions.

If you&apos;re not interested, say good-bye and hang up or shut the door.

If it sounds like a good deal, ask the salesperson for their name, and the name, and address and telephone number of the company.

Contact the BBB for a reliability report on the company.

Before buying anything, ask for the total yearly cost of each magazine and of the entire package purchased. Compare those costs to regular magazine subscription rates offered directly through the publication.

Ask to receive a written copy of the sales terms.

Make the check payable to the company, not to an individual. Do not pay in cash.

Whenever you sign a contract or make a purchase over $25 as a result of an in-home 

 solicitation, you have a three-day right to cancel. Make sure the salesperson has provided 

 you with the proper &quot;notice of cancellation&quot; form and make sure that the notice is dated correctly. 

 If you wish to cancel your subscriptions, you must do so in writing within three days of the 

 receipt of the agreement.

 Remember, any legitimate company that wants your business will be more than willing to 

 allow you the time to &quot;check them out.&quot; Don&apos;t fall prey to high-pressure tactics. 

 Consumers may contact the BBB at 342-3455 or 800-533-5501 and on the web at www.vabbb.org. Roanoke BBB

NEWS UPDATE: SALES WARNING
oregonlive.com
 Attorney General Hardy Myers is warning Oregonians about door-to-door sales crews 

 selling magazines and cleaning products and announced the filing of an 

 agreement with a Georgia company whose employees engaged in unlawful behavior. 

 Named in an assurance of voluntary compliance in Marion County Circuit Court, is T&amp;B;Sales Inc. 

 of Riverdale, Ga. The legal document admits no violation of law. 

 Under the direction of T&amp;B;Sales, youngsters recruited from several states 

 arrived in the Willamette Valley in April selling Advanage all-purpose cleaner 

 door-to-door. The state became concerned after receiving reports from police in 

 Marion, Polk and Yamhill counties about aggressive sales practices, fraud, 

 theft and illegal drug activity. 

 Within the first week of operation, officers arrested four crew members in 

 Yamhill County for allegedly forging stolen checks, using false names while 

 attempting to obtain medical care and medications at a hospital, and for 

 selling marijuana to an undercover police officer. In addition, six 

 citations were issued for soliciting sales without a permit. 

 The workers left the state after getting a notice of unlawful trade. 

 The firm has agreed to pay $2,500 to the Department of Justice&apos;s consumer 

 protection and education fund. 

 Door-to-door salespersons must, in the first 30 seconds, identify 

 themselves, their company, their product and its price, and ask the consumer 

 if more sales information is wanted. If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; they must immediately leave. The Oregonian

 Today, Rockland can bid adieu to the young men and women who have been going door-to-door to 

 sell magazines, Ramapo police said on Friday.

 Detective Lt. Brad Weidel said Paragon Sales sellers were supposed to leave the county for 

 other regions today. The sales contingent has been estimated at 40 by police and have been 

 staying at the Holiday Inn in Montebello.

 Weidel and the police expect them to back up their vans with Michigan, 

 Tennessee and Illinois plates and head off.

 In their short time here, four of the sellers have been arrested 

 three for soliciting sales without a permit Airmont. They were released on $50 bail 

 by the police pending a hearing in Airmont Justice Court in June. If they dont show 

 up in court and thats the betting odds they lose their bail money.

 Left behind in the county jail was Donnell Preston, 28, of Dayton, Ohio, on 

 felony counts of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree burglary. 

 He is accused of breaking into the hotel room of a 25-year-old fellow seller 

 and attempting to choke her to death. The woman he is accused of attacking is 

 the mother of his two children.

 His case will go before a grand jury and his victim will be asked to testify. This entry was posted on Saturday, May 31st, 2008

 Beverly grabbing suspect held on $100,000 bail
By Julie Manganis
Staff writer
The Salem News
Sat, May 31 2008
 BEVERLY A Philadelphia salesman accused of trying to grab a 13-year-old girl on her bike 

 last week will be held on $100,000 cash bail, a Salem District Court judge ordered yesterday. 

 Prosecutors had originally moved to have Jerwayne Hunter, 25, held without bail as a danger 

 to the public, a request that was scheduled to be argued during a hearing yesterday. 

 Hunter was arrested on May 23 after a girl told police that a man fitting Hunter&apos;s description 

 had jumped out from behind bushes behind the Stop&amp;Shop on Elliott Street and grabbed her arm. 

 He asked if she had a license for the bike. The girl said she pulled her arm back and pedaled away.

 Hunter, who was in the area with a group of door-to-door magazine salesmen, was found at 

 Bessie Baker Park, a baseball field on Cabot Street. 

 Hunter&apos;s new lawyer, public defender Allison Bloomquist, and prosecutors decided not to pursue 

 a full hearing on dangerousness and instead held a brief bail hearing before Judge Richard Mori. 

 The bail was expected to be high given the nature of the charges, which include assault and 

 battery, accosting, child enticement, and peddling without a license, and Hunter&apos;s 

 lack of any ties to the area. 

 Hunter has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is due back in court on June 23. By Julie Manganis

 Cops, experts knock door-to-door subscription businesses
Steve Lieberman and Jay Loomis
The Journal News
May 29, 2008
 The world of selling magazine subscriptions door to door can be exploitive, illegal and, at 

 times, dangerous, authorities said yesterday.

Thousands of solicitors - mostly ranging in age from 18 into their early 20s - 

 travel the country, living in motels under the control of handlers who pay them a 

 pittance based on daily sales and even hold their earnings, authorities said.

&quot;There is physical violence and there is psychological violence,&quot; said Earline Williams, 

 director of Parent Watch, a New York City-based group that monitors door-to-door subscription businesses.

The sellers can&apos;t pick up and leave because they are working hundreds, if not thousands, of 

 miles from home and cannot afford a bus or train ticket home, Williams said.

In many cases, she said, if they don&apos;t make their daily sales quota, their managers deny 

 them food money, she said. Peer pressure and violence have been used to keep disgruntled 

 sellers in line.

&quot;By and large these kids are in a hole and they don&apos;t have enough money to leave if they want to,&quot; 

 Williams said. &quot;Their managers hold their money. If they have family, they can get bailed out.&quot;

In the Rockland, Westchester and Putnam region, police said, there have been few reports 

 over the years of violence or crimes involving magazine solicitors. Mostly, sellers are 

 arrested for not having a peddler&apos;s license and face a fine, police said.

Violence struck Tuesday in Ramapo involving two members of an estimated 40-member magazine-

 selling crew for Paragon Sales staying at the Holiday Inn in Montebello.

Ramapo police charged Donnell Preston, 28, of Dayton, Ohio, with attempting to murder a 

 woman by choking her inside her hotel room.

Preston and the woman had two children together and were selling subscriptions for Paragon. 

 She was treated at Good Samaritan Hospital and released.

Paragon officials in Rockland said yesterday that they were not aware of the details of the incident. 

 They also said they didn&apos;t really know Preston and the victim.

&quot;We have no idea what this dude did,&quot; Paragon general manager Silk Campbell said. 

 &quot;This was a couple that got hired.&quot;

Internet sites exist outlining supposed cons and violence, including homicides and rapes, 

 involving people in the industry.

Campbell bristled at descriptions of his business by some critics. He said critics play up the 

 negatives, which he said are found in every business.

&quot;The magazine subscription business is a great place,&quot; he said. &quot;It gives people an opportunity 

 to get away from bad environments and in some cases gives people a second chance.&quot;

Many of the magazine-subscription companies target disenfranchised young people.

The young people are promised money and travel, but are appealed to based on their status 

 in life, Williams said. Some crews are segregated, while others are more diverse.

&quot;That&apos;s part of the pitch for some crews,&quot; Williams said. &quot;They appeal to people with problems in life.&quot;

Campbell said his company encourages people of color to become contracted employees.

&quot;Most people of color come from tough environments,&quot; he said. &quot;People make mistakes. 

 America talks about second chances, then doesn&apos;t give them. We&apos;re busting our butts 

 working hard and trying to teach people.&quot;

At times, those going door to door have criminal histories, police said.

Preston had two previous felony convictions involving assault and robbery in Ohio, 

 said Detective Lt. Brad Weidel of the Ramapo police.

Paragon is a subsidiary of Midwest Clearing Inc. in Illinois. The vans being used to drive 

 sellers have license plates from Tennessee, Michigan and Illinois, Ramapo police said.

Midwest&apos;s owners, Andre and Jane Walker, didn&apos;t return a telephone call for comment.

David Anthony, a Midwest customer service representative, said he wasn&apos;t aware of whether 

 Paragon did background checks on its contracted employees.

Anthony said the sellers were independent contractors recruited from newspaper ads and other advertising.

&quot;The ads are put out in disadvantaged areas to get people interested in job training,&quot; Anthony said.

Door-to-door sales of magazines are a small part of the publishing industry, with only 1 percent 

 to 2 percent of total subscriptions sold that way, said Daniel C. Smith, 

 general counsel for the National Field Selling Association, a Philadelphia-based trade group.

Across the country, about 2,500 sales agents make their living selling door to door and 

 getting commissions, Smith said.

Despite well-publicized crimes and other incidents in recent years, Smith said, those 

 cases are &quot;aberrations.&quot;

&quot;The industry in most cases operates well and does a good job,&quot; Smith said. 

 &quot;You will find good and bad in an industry. ... Sometimes, the complaints are blown out of proportion.&quot;

 Smith said the National Field Selling Association has taken steps to 

 improve the industry&apos;s image. The changes include encouraging companies to do background 

 checks on recruits and holding seminars focused on rules and regulations.

Some of the biggest magazine publishers said they don&apos;t use door-to-door sales crews.

&quot;Our agreement with any agents prohibits them from using door-to-door sales crews to sell 

 Time Inc. titles,&quot; read an e-mail statement from the New York-based publisher.

William Adler, a spokesman for Reader&apos;s Digest in Chappaqua, said traveling sales crews 

 &quot;are not part of our marketing efforts.&quot;

Selling magazines door to door is illegal without a peddler&apos;s permit or license in 

 Rockland, Westchester and Putnam counties.

&quot;They&apos;ve been read the riot acts by officers as far as don&apos;t solicit,&quot; said Weidel of the 

 Ramapo Police Department.

Sleepy Hollow Police Chief Jimmy Warren, head of the Westchester County Chiefs of Police 

 Association, said groups selling magazines were not uncommon.

&quot;They usually have a van crammed full of kids and stay in some cheap motel while 

 they&apos;re here,&quot; Warren said.

Warren said the sellers, many times, were the victims.

&quot;The kids get exploited and abused,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;re promised that they&apos;ll travel and 

 make a lot of money, but they usually go home broke because they&apos;re charged and taxed so much.&quot;

Like police in Rockland and Westchester, Lt. Brian Karst of the Carmel police 

 department said officers responded to complaints from residents.

&quot;If they have no permit, they could be charged with peddling without a license,&quot; he said.

The summonses issued for soliciting without a permit is the price of doing business for the 

 companies and the contracted worker is responsible, authorities said.

&quot;I don&apos;t think these are high priorities for the municipalities and the police - and that&apos;s 

 understandable,&quot; said Terry Grosselfinger, director of Rockland Consumer Protection.

People should know that many times the prices charged for magazine subscriptions 

 are twice the publisher&apos;s price, Grosselfinger said.

People should ask to see a permit so they at least know the company is registered and 

 can be tracked down, Grosselfinger said.

&quot;Some of these sellers are more aggressive than others,&quot; Grosselfinger said. &quot;They will 

 give the resident a sob take that they need the money because their mother is dying 

 of cancer or they are working their way through college.&quot; Steve Lieberman and Jay Loomis

May 29, 2008
 AIRMONT - Ramapo police said today they had arrested three people on charges of violating 

 local law prohibiting soliciting magazine sales door-to-door without a Ramapo permit.

 The three people from out of state are staying at the Holiday Inn in Montebello as part of a 

 sales force for Paragon Sales. They are driven to neighborhoods to sell magazine subscriptions.

 Charged with soliciting without a permit are Tracey M. White, 32, of New Orleans, La.; 

 Lorenzo Crawford, 21, of Chicago; and Steven M. Johnson, 41, of South Bend, Ind., Ramapo 

 Lt. Mark Emma said.

 They all were released last night on $50 bail, which they would forfeit if they don&apos;t 

 show up June 28 in Airmont Justice Court. They face a fine as penalty.

 Both White and Johnson are accused of soliciting on Sonia Court about 5:30 p.m., 

 Emma said. Crawford is accused of knocking on doors trying to sell magazines on Route 59.

 Police have warned the Paragon Sales managers staying in Rockland that a peddler&apos;s permit is 

 needed to sell door-to-door.

 In an unrelated incident, a Paragon contracted seller was charged this week with 

 attempting to murder his girlfriend by choking her at the hotel.

 Emma said that incident and complaints from the public had raised the 

 department&apos;s awareness about the solicitors.

Police: Solicitor tried to kill girlfriend in hotel

May 28, 2008
 MONTEBELLO - An Ohio man, accused of choking his girlfriend until she became unconscious, 

 eluded police yesterday for nearly three hours.

Donnell Preston, 28, of Dayton was charged with second-degree attempted murder 

 and second-degree burglary, both felonies.
Preston and the 25-year-old woman had a long-standing relationship and had two children 

 together, Ramapo police said.

They were staying at the Holiday Inn in Montebello as part of a group selling magazine 

 subscriptions door to door across the region, police said.

They worked for Tennessee-based Paragon magazine sales, police said.

Preston is accused of following the woman and forcing his way into her room about 

 8:40 a.m. yesterday, said Detective Lt. Brad Weidel of the Ramapo police.

&quot;He didn&apos;t break down the door,&quot; Weidel said, but the suspect is accused of forcing his 

 way through the door after the woman opened it and going inside.

&quot;They started arguing,&quot; Weidel said. Preston is accused of attempting to strangle 

 the woman with a chokehold during the argument before stopping, police said. 

 Preston and the woman then continued arguing, their screams getting louder, Weidel said.

While yelling, Preston made comments to the victim that police later used as a 

 basis for charging him with attempted murder, Weidel said.

Weidel declined to discuss the comments. He said Preston gave a statement to police 

 after his arrest.

Preston is accused of grabbing the woman by the throat a second time, Weidel said.

The couple&apos;s magazine-selling colleagues heard the screams.

&quot;They started banging on the door,&quot; Weidel said, and Preston &quot;jumped out the window.&quot; 

 The woman came to and was able to to get to the door and let the other people in, he said.

The second-story window is about 15 feet off the ground, Weidel said.

The woman spoke to police when they arrived. A description of Preston was broadcast, 

 and Ramapo officers found him behind Drug Mart in Airmont, Weidel said.

Officers chased him, but lost him in the woods. Police sealed off the area with the 

 help of officers from Suffern, Mahwah, N.J., and the state police. The Sheriff&apos;s 

 Department Bureau of Criminal Investigation looked for evidence at the scene.

Ramapo police used a computerized phone system to warn nearby residents and businesses 

 about the search, Weidel said.

Two officers with tracking dogs joined the effort -.Ramapo Officer Christopher 

 Franklin and his canine partner, Shea, and Clarkstown Officer Joseph Knarich 

 and Oz. The dogs searched vacant buildings and sheds.

As police and dogs searched the ground, the county police helicopter flew around the area.

Ramapo officers arrested Preston about three hours after the attack. He was found between 

 logs in the woods behind the old Grand Union on the northwest corner of Route 59 and 

 Airmont Avenue, Weidel said.

The woman was treated at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern.

&quot;She&apos;s going to survive,&quot; Weidel said.

Preston was being held, pending arraignment in Ramapo Town Court. Weidel said Preston 

 likely would be held without bail in the county jail, based on the felony charges, 

 previous felony convictions and the fact he had no ties to Rockland County.

Weidel said police also were looking into the company that sent the magazine sellers to Rockland.

Weidel said the magazine solicitors planned to work in Ramapo and other areas of the 

 county yesterday, even though they didn&apos;t have a permit and would be stopped if found by police.

Hours after the hotel incident, several solicitors were dropped off in West Nyack, 

 police said, but Clarkstown police warned them that they couldn&apos;t sell without a permit.

Usually, during the spring, such solicitors pop up around Rockland. They hail from 

 other states and are dropped off by van in neighborhoods, where they go door to door, 

 trying to sell magazine subscriptions.

Several have been arrested over the years for soliciting without a peddler&apos;s permit 

 or for other crimes.

Sgt. Eric Eisele of the Clarkstown police said yesterday that his squad 

 recently had arrested a magazine solicitor.

&quot;The guy was too aggressive, and he wouldn&apos;t leave the homeowner alone and take 

 no for an answer,&quot; Eisele said. &quot;The guy then started cursing the homeowner.&quot;

The solicitor also didn&apos;t have a permit to sell in Clarkstown, he said.

Eisele and Weidel said, in their experience, the magazine solicitors generally 

 were young, came from out of state and work for a type of commission.

Girl-grab suspect held without bail

 Girl-grab suspect held without bail:
Magazine seller has hearing Friday, denies any contact
By Julie Manganis
Staff writer
The Salem News
Published: May 28, 2008 12:00 am
 BEVERLY A man arrested Friday after police said he tried to grab a 13-year-old girl riding 

 her bike home from an ice-cream stand will remain held without bail at least 

 through Friday, when a hearing into whether he poses a danger to the public is held. 

 At his arraignment yesterday in Salem District Court, Jerwayne Hunter, 

 25, of Philadelphia, a traveling magazine salesman, pleaded not guilty to 

 charges of child enticement, accosting, assault and battery, and peddling without a license. 

 Judge Richard Mori granted the request of a prosecutor who asked that Hunter be held without bail. 

 Prosecutor Elizabeth Satelmajer called the allegations &quot;very, very concerning.&quot; 

 The girl told police she was riding her bike home from Dick&amp;June&apos;s and was on a path 

 behind the Stop&amp;Shop on Elliott Street when a man jumped out of the bushes, &quot;firmly&quot; 

 grabbed her arm and asked, &quot;Where&apos;s your license?&quot; 

 The girl said she pulled away from him and pedaled home. 

 During a massive search of the area, someone told police that they had seen a man 

 matching the description the girl had given going into Stop&amp;Shop. Police got a 

 copy of a surveillance tape. 

 They eventually spotted a man matching the description at Bessie Baker Park, a Little League 

 field behind Rite Aid on Cabot Street.

 Hunter has four aliases and a record that includes a conviction for home invasion and 

 robbery in Michigan, Satelmajer told the judge. 

 He is also a suspect in an incident in Wakefield in which a woman reported that a man had been 

 standing across from her home two afternoons last week. She told police she recognized 

 the man from photos of him she saw on the news this weekend. 

 Hunter has denied any contact with the girl. Questioned by police, he said that he&apos;d 

 had no interaction with any child while in the area. 

 Hunter works for a company called &quot;Unified Doers,&quot; which is based in Washington, D.C., 

 and has worked as a salesman for about a month and a half, said his lawyer, Thomas Gately. 

 Gately said that there were seven people in his group, and all of them can vouch 

 for his whereabouts. He said Hunter and his fellow salesmen ate lunch together at 

 McDonald&apos;s and then went to the Stop&amp;Shop. 

 &quot;At no time was he alone,&quot; Gately said. 

 Hunter is expected to remain at Middleton Jail without bail at least until Friday&apos;s hearing. By Julie Manganis

Door-to-Door Scam Busted

 Door-to-Door Scam Busted

Updated: May 28, 2008, 8:34 am
 Monona police officials said three people were arrested in connection to door-to-door sales, 

 which included sellers posing as high school students and representatives of collegians 

 with hopes of overseas study.

 Authorities said Tina Gibson, 23, of Rhode Island was being held in the Dane County jail on a 

 warrant from Texas in a forgery case.

 Monona Police Lieutenant Rich O&apos;Connor told 27 News Cory Hamilton, 27, and Amanda Gumns, 25, 

 were cited for selling door-to-door without proper sellers&apos; permits. O&apos;Connor said Gumns had an 

 outstanding child support warrant from Illinois, but because there was no guarantee 

 Illinois authorities would pick up Gumns, she was not detained.

 O&apos;Connor showed 27 News some of the checks which were seized when the three people were arrested.

 The checks were made out to Tuscan Readers Service, Inc. Some consumer groups have complained 

 about the company&apos;s business practices. 27 News was unable to reach a representative of the 

 Georgia-based company.

 One check was from a Monona man for the amount of $500.00.

 O&apos;Connor told 27 News other police jurisdictions have been notified of the door-to-door scam 

 activities in Monona and the Madison area.

 27 News Consumer Alert: Magazine Solicitors scam in Monona 
From Monona Police Department news release:
On 5-24-2008 The Monona Emergency Dispatch Center began receiving complaints about magazine 

 solicitors on the west side of the city. Officers were able to contact three subjects. 

 The suspects, two females and one male were using a variety of approaches to obtain money 

 from residents. At times they would say they are Monona Grove HS students and were 

 trying to raise money to send a group of students to London. During other contacts 

 the suspects told residents they were attempting to earn enough rewards for the 

 magazine company to send them to London. During some contacts residents were told 

 they were UW students attempting to raise funds for one thing or another.

 They may have told residents they were employed by Tucan or Tuscan Reader Service. 

 All three subjects were arrested on various charges. Tina Gibson-23 years old from 

 Rhode Island. Gibson is being held on an extraditable warrant out of Texas. Amanda 

 Gumns-25 years old from Las Vegas, Nevada and Cory Hamilton-27 years old from Illinois.

 Numerous checks and cash were confiscated from these subjects. The 

 Monona Police Department will be attempting to notify the donors that we have 

 their checks for safe keeping. Many of these checks were written by City of 

 Madison residents.

 The Monona Police Department recommends that you select your charities and retailers 

 and avoid giving money to people who seek you out with items for sale or donation requests. 

 Some are legitimate, but many such as this one are not. If you receive a telephone call or 

 a knock on your door involving people trying to get you to give them money we strongly 

 recommend you say NO unless you are absolutely certain of their identity and the 

 organization they represent.

 3 arrested in magazine scam in Monona
Bill Novak 5/27/2008 9:26 am

Police Reports
 Monona police arrested three people running a magazine-buying scam in the city Saturday, 

 with one of the suspects arrested also allegedly running a scam in Madison.

 Amanda Gumms, 25, Las Vegas; Tina Gibson, 23, Rhode Island; and Cory Hamilton, 27, Illinois, 

 were arrested and cited for soliciting without a permit, but they also could face felony 

 forgery charges, said Monona Police Detective Lt. Richard O&apos;Connor.

 The three were arrested Saturday evening while they were still soliciting door to door, O&apos;Connor said.

 &quot;They had been operating for about an hour and a half,&quot; O&apos;Connor said. &quot;We had a couple 

 of residents call us simultaneously because they felt funny about giving them money.&quot;

 The suspects were telling residents several stories, including that they were 

 Monona Grove High School students raising money to send a group of students to London, 

 or they were selling magazine subscriptions to earn rewards from the magazine company for 

 trips to London, or that they were University of Wisconsin students raising money for &quot;one thing 

 or another,&quot; the detective said.

 Gumms had been sought by Madison police for soliciting donations in the east side Oakridge 

 neighborhood, allegedly telling residents she was the captain of a softball team 

 raising money for a trip to a tourney in Hawaii, and she was also collecting money 

 to buy books for UW Children&apos;s Hospital.

 O&apos;Connor said Monona police have numerous personal checks being held as evidence, 

 including quite a few from Madison residents.

 &quot;We will attempt to notify the donors that we have their checks for safe keeping,&quot; O&apos;Connor said.

 The suspects allegedly told their targets they worked for Tuscan Readers Services. 

 A Google search found many instances of scams around the country by solicitors purportedly 

 using the company as their employer.

 O&apos;Connor said people should be careful in giving money to people who come knocking.

 &quot;Some are legitimate but many such as this are not,&quot; he said. &quot;If you get a phone call or a 

 knock on your door from people trying to get you to give them money, we strongly 

 recommend you say no unless you are absolutely sure of their identity and the 

 organization they represent.&quot; Bill Novak 5/27/2008 9:26 am

 He&apos;s been convicted of home invasion, robbery and several other crimes, but a Pennsylvania 

 man was traveling door-to-door in the Bay State hawking magazines and now he&apos;s 

 accused of trying to kidnap a 13-year-old girl. 

 &quot;A person reached at her from a wooded area and knocked her off her bike,&quot; said Beverly Police 

 Captain Alan Petersen. 

 Police say Jerwayne Hunter and his magazine crew were at a McDonald&apos;s in Beverly Friday 

 afternoon when hunter walked over to a nearby bike path and allegedly tried to 

 grab the little girl. 

 Police say the girl was on her bike heading home after getting an ice cream when the suspect 

 came out from behind some bushes and tried to grab her. 

 An I-Team investigation into magazine sales crews revealed a disturbing trend 

 there were crew members wanted for rape. Others had done time for assault, armed robbery and even murder. 

 Many towns and cities like Beverly require crews to register with police before they come 

 knocking at your door, but in this case, police had no idea Hunter was walking the streets. 

 &quot;If people have good backgrounds we issue a permit,&quot; said Petersen. &quot;If we were familiar 

 with his background, he would not have (gotten a permit).&quot; 

 Residents are glad the young girl is OK, but troubled by the fact that someone 

 like this could be walking up to their door. &quot;Older people in the neighborhood don&apos;t 

 realize what&apos;s going on and open their door,&quot; explained one resident. &quot;Don&apos;t know 

 what can happen after that.&quot; 

 After the I-Team investigation, the state attempted to pass a &quot;do not knock&quot; bill. 

 Right now, that legislation is being studied and is expected to be re-filed.

 SEEKONK - A magazine salesman accused of attempted child abduction in Beverly on Saturday also 

 went door-to-door with two colleagues - all three convicted felons - in Seekonk and elsewhere.

 In Beverly, one of the Unified Doors salesmen, Jerwayne Hunter, 25, of Philadelphia, 

 allegedly approached a 13-year-old girl on a park path, asked her if she &quot;had a license&quot; 

 for the bicycle she was riding, and tried to grab her, Beverly Police said.

 The girl escaped, rode home, and called police.

 Beverly Police arrested Hunter and charged him with assault and battery and enticing a child under 16.

 Police said they found Hunter, who matched the girl&apos;s description of her assailant, in a nearby park.

 Police said Unified Doors, of Washington, D.C., did not have the town&apos;s permission to 

 sell the magazines, violating state law.

 The salesmen worked in Seekonk, Needham, Dedham, Cambridge and Lexington as well. The Sun Chronicle

 Peddlers canvassing the Eastern Wayne school district are believed to be a national book-seller, 

 Wayne County Public Schools&apos; officials said Friday. 

 Earlier, Ken Derksen, public information officer for the school system, had alerted the 

 community to be aware of individuals going door to door, claiming to represent the school system. 

 There is no connection to the district, Derksen said. 

 &quot;We have contacted the company and told them to stop representing our school system,&quot; 

 Derksen said. &quot;This is a legitimate company but we can&apos;t have people representing our school system.&quot; By Phyllis Moore

POSTED: 6:27 pm EDT May 24, 2008
UPDATED: 7:07 pm EDT May 24, 2008
 BEVERLY, Mass. -- A door-to-door salesman tried to abduct a 13-year-old girl while she 

 was riding her bicycle along a park path Saturday, police said.

 NewsCenter 5&apos;s Lynn Jolicoeur reported a man approached the girl and asked if she had a license 

 for her bicycle, and then tried to grab her, according to police.

 The girl got away and rode her bike home, where she called police.

 Police found convicted felon Jerwayne Hunter, 25, of Philadelphia, Pa., in a nearby park, 

 wearing a dress shirt and tie, matching the girls description. Police said they also have 

 surveillance camera video of him making a purchase at a store close to the path where the 

 attempted abduction took place.

 He was arrested and charged with assault and battery and 

 enticing a child under 16.

 Its very scary. It makes you feel like you cant even send your child out to play anymore, 

 said nearby resident Jaime Bowden.

 Hunter was in town working for a Washington D.C. company, Unified Doers, which sells magazine 

 subscriptions door-to-door. Police said the company did not get permission from the 

 town to sell the magazines, which is a violation of state law.

 Two other salesmen with Hunter at the time of his arrest also had criminal records.

 You cant trust them. If they dont have a license, if they dont have a badge and theyre 

 not stating their name, how can you trust them? said nearby resident Ken Clarke.

 Police said theyre also looking at Hunter for a connection to a sexual assault on a woman at 

 gunpoint Sunday night in a wooded area near the Hall-Whittaker Bridge.

 Were just locking the doors, even during the day. We didnt tend to do that all the time, 

 said resident Tanya Blot.

 The salesmen were also selling magazines in Needham, Dedham, Cambridge, Lexington and Seekonk.

 Police urge vigilance with door-to-door solicitors

Marblehead, Massachusetts
 Marblehead - In light of an incident in which a man allegedly tried to grab a 12-year-old Beverly 

 girl off her bike Friday, Marblehead Police are urging all merchants and residents to call 9-1-1 

 immediately should they be approached by any door-to-door solicitors.

 Beverly Police arrested Jerwayne Hunter in relation to the incident, and Marblehead 

 Police have learned that Hunter is associated with a group soliciting door to door 

 under the company names of UDG, Unified Does Managers Group and CEObound.org.

 These situations are very common this time of year, and every police department needs the help 

 of every citizen in order to deal with these types of solicitors, Lt. Dave Millett said. 

 Once the police gain legal ground provided by a citizens call, criminal records are often 

 discovered, and arrests may be made.

 Millett added, To paraphrase: It takes a village to chase the bad guys out of town. WickedLocal.com

 School officials cautions residents about solicitors
By Phyllis Moore
Published in News on May 23, 2008 02:09 PM
 County school officials and the Sheriff&apos;s Office are investigating reports that someone is 

 going door to door claiming to represent the school system. 

 It is unclear how far-reaching the situation is, or the specifics of what one or more 

 individuals may be seeking, said Ken Derksen, public information officer for Wayne County 

 Public Schools, though they seem to be affiliated with a book publishing company. 

 But so far, it seems to be isolated to the Eastern Wayne district, he said, naming 

 Parkstown and Beston Road areas specifically. Several parents have contacted the 

 schools this week, Derksen said. 

 &quot;Right now we have only heard from parents in (Eastern Wayne) elementary school but 

 in case this is outside of the Eastern Wayne district, we want the public to be aware,&quot; 

 he said. &quot;They&apos;re making it sound like they&apos;re representing the schools and they&apos;re not.&quot; 

 Derksen said it does not appear that money was being solicited and advised residents not to 

 give out any personal information and not to allow individuals into the home. 

 He said that parents in the Eastern Wayne area have been alerted and officials determined it 

 would be wise to broadcast the concern in case it spreads to other parts of the county. 

 Derksen also noted that they had a description of a vehicle believed to be connected to the 

 incidents -- a silver Volkswagon Jetta. 

 Sheriff Carey Winders cautioned residents to be careful any time someone calls or comes 

 to the door posing as a school representative, or soliciting for organizations not 

 typically known to do that. 

 &quot;Usually they don&apos;t send anyone around to collect money,&quot; he said. &quot;This is probably not 

 the first time something like this has happened and it probably won&apos;t be the last.&quot; 

 Sometimes, he noted, the person is not after something in the short run, but is at a 

 residence to &quot;scope things out to see what&apos;s there.&quot; 

 &quot;If somebody goes to the house and tries to solicit or whatever,&quot; he advised, &quot;make sure 

 they call 911. Obtain as much information as you can about what kind of car, or a 

 description of the tag. If you can get a license number, that&apos;s also good.&quot; By Phyllis Moore

Molokai restaurant owner slain

 Molokai restaurant owner slain
Florida killing: Robert Spruiell owned Paddlers Inn
By Gary T. Kubota
gkubota@starbulletin.com
Vol. 13, Issue 143 - Thursday, May 22, 2008
Star Bulletin
 WAILUKU The owner of a Molokai restaurant was 

 stabbed to death in a Florida hotel while attempting 

 to halt illegal drug sales within his business there, 

 Miami-Dade police said.

 Robert Spruiell, 38, known on Molokai as &quot;Kamuela 

 Kamakana,&quot; died Sunday morning in a hallway of the 

 Golden Nugget Hotel in Sunny Isles Beach, between 

 Miami and Fort Lauderdale.

 Spruiell, who owned Paddlers Inn Restaurant&amp;Bar in 

 Kaunakakai, was in Florida for a couple of weeks 

 operating his door-to-door magazine sales business 

 Integrity Sales Inc.

 A preliminary police investigation found that Spruiell 

 was trying to stop the selling of drugs to his 

 salespeople when he was stabbed.

 &quot;It doesn&apos;t surprise me he was trying to help somebody 

 else,&quot; said Alicia Montemayor, manager of Paddlers 

 Inn. &quot;We already know he&apos;s like that. He was really a 

 great man. He had a great heart.&quot;

 Several black ribbons have been hung at the doorway 

 and on display cases of the restaurant where he 

 employed 42 people.

 Charged with second-degree felony murder is 

 22-year-old Jeremy Johnson, one of Spruiell&apos;s magazine 

 sales employees.

 Johnson also was charged with burglary and kidnapping, 

 said Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Nelda Fonticiella.

 Fonticiella said Johnson was being held without bail. 

 She said the investigation was continuing.

 Molokai resident Shirley Rawlins said Spruiell, a 

 grandson of tennis professional Henry Kamakana Sr., 

 had been visiting the Friendly Isle for a year or two 

 before buying the restaurant. She said Spruiell had 

 bought land and was planning to build a home.

 Montemayor said Spruiell, whose Hawaiian mother once 

 lived on Molokai, bought the restaurant in October.

 She said Spruiell, divorced with three children on the 

 mainland, planned to make Molokai his permanent home.

 &quot;He liked the community, the lifestyle,&quot; she said. &quot;He 

 was looking into buying boats. ... He had a lot of 

 plans for his business and the community.&quot; By Gary T. Kubota

 Albuquerque, New Mexico
Employer of murder suspects killed in stabbing

 Employer of murder suspects killed in stabbing

News 13, Albuquerque, New Mexico
Posted: May 21, 2008 02:18 AM CDT
 ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) - The owner of the magazine-sales company that employed two men 

 charged with killing an Albuquerque company has himself become the victim of murder.

 The death of Robert Spruiell will change the lawsuit the city of Albuquerque filed 

 against his company, according to assistant city attorney Greg Wheeler. The suit can 

 still proceed against his estate and his company, Integrity Program LLC, he said.

 &quot;Shock and surprise, I can say after 15 years in the practice of law I&apos;ve never 

 had a case where a party was murdered in the middle of a litigation,&quot; Wheeler added.

 Spruiell&apos;s company sold magazine subscriptions door-to-door and hired two salesmen 

 who later allegedly murdered an elderly couple--Tak and Pung Yi--in their northeast Albuquerque home.

 Doors are shut a little tighter on Avenida la Costa NE these days, and Delsa McCracken, 

 one of the Yis&apos; neighbors, told KRQE News 13 things haven&apos;t been the same.

 &quot;She was a good, good lady, and he was a good man,&quot; McCracken said. &quot;I just don&apos;t even 

 like to think about it.&quot;

 Travis Rowley and Mike Lee where soon charged in the brutal slayings. Both remained 

 jailed pending their trials.

 McCracken, 85, said she now double checks that her doors are locked.

 &quot;You bet I do,&quot; she said. &quot;All the time.&quot;

 The murder case shone a light on Integrity Program LLC and its operations which have 

 been under a cloud of controversy in several states.

 &quot;They didn&apos;t have permits,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;They didn&apos;t have tax numbers, which means 

 they weren&apos;t paying taxes here.

 &quot;They weren&apos;t registered with the state or registered with the city.&quot;

 Out of the killings came a bill before the Albuquerque city council would tighten 

 controls on door-to-door sales. It would let homeowners put themselves on a no-knock 

 list, and a salesman who came to their door anyway could be arrested. 

 And the city of Albuquerque is, or was, suing Spruiell who was murdered near Miami, Fla., 

 on Sunday.

 Police in Florida reported Spruiell, 38, confronted a man he believed was trying to 

 sell drugs to his sales people. He was stabbed to death in the confrontation.

 Wheeler said the city still plans to follow the money and will amend the civil suit to go 

 after Spruiell&apos;s estate.

 They&apos;re trying to set an example that shifty and shady sales people are not welcome in Albuquerque. KRQE | Reporter: Kim Holland | Web Producer: Bill Diven

Arrest made in murder of Paddlers&apos; Inn owner

 Arrest made in murder of Paddlers&apos; Inn owner

Molokai News : Crime

 Suspect charged with murder, burglary, kidnapping

Paddlers Inn owner Robert Spruiell, 38, was stabbed to death Sunday morning in Miami. 

 Charged with the crime, second-degree felony murder, is 22 year-old Jeremy Johnson, one 

 of Spruiells employees. 

 Spruiell owned and operated many businesses on the mainland from Phoenix, Ariz., 

 including a door-to-door magazine sales business. He and his magazine sales crew were staying 

 in Miami for two weeks, apparently selling magazines for Integrity Sales, Inc.

 According to the Miami Herald, Spruiell and Johnson confronted a man they believed was 

 trying to sell drugs to Spruiells sales people. The two entered room 205 of the Golden 

 Nugget Hotel, 18555 Collins Ave., and confronted Jesus Cisneros, 42. 

 Cisneros told police he grabbed a knife for self-defense and stabbed both men. 

 Spruiell was dead at the scene. 

 Johnson was arrested at Aventura Hospital after treatment for his stab wounds. 

 He was also charged with burglary and kidnapping. 

 Magazine sales businesses, including many of those belonging to Spruiell, his ex-wife 

 and his former business partner Jonathan Tork, have drawn media attention for everything 

 from the treatment of employees to the criminal behavior of those employees, most of 

 whom are independent contractors. 

 According to the Herald, two subscription sellers associated with one of Spruiells 

 companies, Integrity Program LLC, Travis Rowley, 23, and Michael Lee, 21, 

 were charged with murdering a couple in Albuquerque, N.M. 

 According to the Albuquerque Tribune, Tak Yi, 79, and wife Pung Yi, 69, were found Dec. 

 4 at home. Yi was bludgeoned to death; his wife was raped and suffocated. 

 Another Integrity contractor, Corey Finley, 21, was arrested a few weeks later in Claremont, 

 Calif. for allegedly raping a woman. 

 The Herald quotes the director of the National Field Selling Association, Ellen Buckley, 

 He worked every day of his life. He would never allow anything bad to happen to his agents.

 Those who knew Spruiell, or Kamuela Kamakana, as he was known on the island, were saddened 

 by the loss. Most remembered him as an easy-going man with a strong business sense 

 and big ideas including franchising the restaurant. 

 Immediate changes included a popular tri-weekly poker tournament and a grand prize 

 sending the winner to Las Vegas. Paddlers Inn has black ribbons over the doorway, 

 but was operating as usual on Tuesday afternoon. 

 Employees of Paddlers Inn said the business will continue to operate as usual.

Magazine Sales Co-worker Charged With Murder

 Co-worker charged in Sunny Isles hotel slaying
BY DAVID OVALLE
Posted on Wed, May. 21, 2008
Miami Herald
 A traveling magazine salesman was charged Tuesday with felony murder because his co-worker was stabbed 

 to death during a brawl that started when the two stormed the room of a Sunny Isles Beach hotel guest.

 Jeremy Johnson, 22, was charged with second-degree felony murder, armed occupied burglary 

 and kidnapping with a weapon.

 Police say he and co-worker Robert Spruiell, 37, traveling magazine salesmen from Prestige 

 Sales in Arizona, broke into room 205 of the Golden Nugget hotel to confront Jesus Cisneros 

 on Sunday morning.

 They believed Cisneros was selling drugs to other of their &apos;&apos;agents,&apos;&apos; young men and women 

 who travel the country hawking subscriptions.

 Spruiell, a father of three who runs nearly a dozen magazine subscription companies based 

 in Arizona, was stabbed to death in the fight.

 In Florida, someone who commits certain felonies -- in this case kidnapping and burglary -- 

 that result in a death can be held on a murder charge.

 Cisneros, who said he acted in self-defense, cooperated with police and has not been charged.

 Johnson, of Sioux Falls, S.D., armed himself with a knife during the fight, too, police said.

 He also was wounded and taken to Aventura Hospital.

 On Tuesday, he was booked into Miami-Dade County Jail.

 Spruiell, Johnson and a group of agents had been at the Golden Nugget hotel, 18555 Collins Ave., 

 for two weeks during a magazine sales trip.

 Spruiell had received a bout of bad press in recent months after three subscription sellers -- 

 independent contractors working with one of his companies -- were arrested on murder and rape 

 charges in New Mexico and California. BY DAVID OVALLE

Robert Spruiell Stabbed To Death

 SUNNY ISLES BEACH
Details emerge in Sunny Isles hotel slaying

door-to-door selling market.

 Robert Spruiell, an Arizona businessman whose door-to-door magazine sales companies had drawn 

 a flurry of bad publicity, was stabbed to death in Sunny Isles Beach when he confronted a 

 man he believed was trying to sell drugs to his sales people, police said.

 Spruiell, 38, a father of three, died Sunday morning at about 8 a.m. outside Room 205 of the 

 Golden Nugget hotel.

 His associate, Jeremy Johnson, 22, of Sioux Falls, S.D., was hospitalized after the fight.

 The third man in the fight, Jesus Cisneros, 42, has cooperated with Miami-Dade homicide detectives. 

 No arrests had been announced as of Monday evening.

For years, the subscription-sales industry has come under fire for questionable business practices 

 and allegations of mistreatment of &apos;&apos;agents&apos;&apos; -- usually teenagers and young adults -- 

 hired as independent contractors to travel the nation selling subscriptions.

 But his supporters say Spruiell unfairly got lumped in with shadier elements of an oft-derided industry.

 &apos;&apos;He was adamantly opposed to drug use, personally and by people associated with his companies,&apos;&apos; 

 said his Oklahoma-based attorney, Cynthia Becker. ``He took a lot of pride in doing the right thing.&apos;&apos;

 About two weeks ago, Spruiell and his sales crew checked into the Golden Nugget, 18555 Collins Ave., 

 from which they would fan out to neighborhoods to hawk subscriptions.

 On Sunday morning, he and Johnson confronted Cisneros, the man he suspected of peddling drugs, 

 inside Room 205.

 Cisneros told police he grabbed a knife to defend himself and stabbed both men. 

 Mortally wounded, Spruiell staggered to the walkway outside, collapsed and died. 

 Johnson was hospitalized.

A former U.S. Navy sailor who fought in the first Gulf War, Spruiell -- whose mother is Hawaiian -- 

 also owned the only bar on the small island of Molokai.

 His Hawaiian name was Kamuela Kamakana. Called the Paddler&apos;s Inn, the restaurant and bar employs 

 43 people on an island of 7,000.

 &apos;&apos;We don&apos;t make a lot of money, but we&apos;re just here for the community. He is going to be missed here,&apos;&apos; 

 said restaurant administrator Alicia Montemayor.

A MIXED LEGACY

In the magazine subscription industry, Spruiell leaves a mixed legacy. He ran nearly a 

 dozen companies in Arizona, which recruit young people with the promise of business experience 

 and travel.

 Brian Hooley, an employee at Prestige Sales in Phoenix, said of Spruiell, 

 ``He was one of the best people I&apos;ve ever known.&apos;&apos;

 At Prestige, $1,000 bonuses are paid for reaching certain goals. Another of his companies, 

 Integrity Sales, shows a photo of teens on a white-water rafting trip in Colorado. 

 Supporters say the experiences are fun and hone business savvy.

 Critics say young people, many of them runaways, are paid little and forced to work under 

 grueling conditions.

 Better Business Bureaus have also taken exception to industry practices -- 

 including salespeople claiming to be earning money for student trips or that 

 magazines will be sent to troops overseas.

 Spruiell&apos;s ex-wife, Karleen Hillery, and her former business associate, Jonathan Tork, 

 have earned notoriety in the industry.

 Seven young people from one of her companies, Youth Employment Services, were killed in a 

 1999 traffic wreck. She later settled a multimillion dollar suit with the state.

 Spruiell met, married and divorced her after the accident.

 The wreck, however, spurred outrage. Phil Ellenbecker, whose teenage daughter Malinda Turvey 

 was a sales agent and died that day, has run a website for nine years dedicated to 

 exposing the industry.

 &apos;&apos;They&apos;re pulling in inner-city kids from broken homes, and a lot of these kids are innocent,&apos;&apos;

 Ellenbecker said. ``They have no idea what they&apos;re getting into.&apos;&apos;

 Spruiell&apos;s supporters say he had worked to distance the companies from his ex-wife 

 and Tork, who was once fined $50,000 by the federal government for giving out fake 

 subscription receipts.

`WORKED EVERY DAY&apos;

Ellen Buckley, director of the National Field Selling Association, said, 

 ``He worked every day of his life. He would never allow anything bad to happen to his agents.&apos;&apos;

 Still, negative press followed Spruiell.

 In December, two subscription sellers associated with Integrity Program LLC -- 

 Travis Rowley, 23, and Michael Lee, 21 -- were charged with murdering an elderly couple 

 in Albuquerque, N.M. The husband was bludgeoned to death, his wife raped and suffocated.

 A few weeks later, detectives in Claremont, Calif., arrested another company contractor, 

 Corey Finley, 21, for allegedly raping a woman.

 Spruiell took pains to conduct background searches, his friends said.

 Still, spurred by the deaths, the city of Albuquerque sued Spruiell&apos;s company for 

 operating without proper permits. Spruiell was not in New Mexico when the contractors were arrested.

 &apos;&apos;Brutal murders -- a very ugly situation,&apos;&apos; said Assistant City Attorney Peter Pierotti, 

 who had just questioned Spruiell in a deposition three weeks ago.

 Traveling Sales Crews: What You Should Know - Consumer Alert
Written by NAPSI
imperialvalleynews.com
Saturday, 17 May 2008
 (NAPSI) - The next time an unexpected knock on your door turns up a young salesperson with a 

 sympathy-worthy sales pitch, you might want to think twice about supporting what may be a 

 traveling sales crew, says the National Consumers League (NCL).

Alarming accounts of scams and dangers surrounding some door-to-door sales have prompted 

 the nations oldest consumer advocacy organization to warn consumers about the risks of 

 patronizing traveling sales crews.

Traveling sales crews quickly sweep in and out of neighborhoods. Often falsely claiming 

 to support programs to help kids or raise money for charity, these companies recruit children, 

 teenagers and young adults to sell products such as magazine subscriptions, cleaning supplies and candy.

For many youths and young adults sucked into traveling sales crews, promises of high pay and 

 nationwide travel turn into long hours of work with abuse and little or no pay. 

 The salespeople are often required to turn their earnings over to the crew leaders, 

 who dole out $5 - $10 a day for food.

Some sellers are forced to survive by scamming or stealing from their customers--or worse. 

 Crew members have been convicted of serious crimes against their customers, such as rape 

 and murder. More often than violence, however, consumers often find overpriced products, 

 nondelivery of products, nonreceipt of refunds when requested and incomplete receipts 

 that make canceling the orders impossible.

How to spot a traveling sales crew? If your city requires a permit for residential sales, 

 ask the seller to show his or her permit. Most traveling sales crews wont have one to show you.

If youre still not sure, ask the salesperson to return the next week. A traveling sales crew 

 likely wont be in the area long enough, and this can buy you some time to check out the company.
