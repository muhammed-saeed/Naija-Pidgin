 McDonald&apos;s, 2907 Two Notch Road: 1980s   9 comments 
 Posted at 11:09 pm in historic , restaurants 
 

 

 

I&apos;ll change the post title if someone can reliably identify this place, but for now, all I can say is that it was an 70s or 80s looking fast food drive-through operation of some sort. The place is now 1st Choice Auto Center , and is almost on the corner of Two Notch and Beltline, in between the old Food Lion and the recently torn down McDonald&apos;s . We used to eat at the Burger King across the street fairly often, so I know I must have seen this while it was in operaiton, but I have no memory of it now.

 UPDATE 23 Aug 2009 : OK, looks like this was McDonald&apos;s before they moved to the corner of Two Notch and Beltline, so I&apos;ll change the post title from &quot;Fast Food Restaurant&quot; to &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;.

The last Mc Donalds built in Columbia with the &quot;Golden Arches&quot; was on this site in the late 1960s. It was torn down and replaced by this in the 1970s. At one point in the 80s I think McD and Chappys switched and this was a fish and chips place briefly, after McD took control of the corner lot.

I remember when Chappys was on the corner, complete with the double decker bus. I don&apos;t remember them ever moving into the building pictured above, but they certainly could have, the first post McDonalds buisiness I recall was a JD Byrider car dealership. I know the building on the corner was torn down and replaced with a new McDonalds, defintely after 1986. I rode by this morning and they are making good progress on the newest McDonalds.

Yes it was a Micky D&apos;s there was a chappy&apos;s fisk and chips next door that had a double decker bus until a tornado destroyed it and there was a BK across the street and my dad owned the Sanderson&apos;s Gulf station next to that on the other corner was a Shell station Nulls Shell and across the street from that was S&amp;S Automotive ah those were the days

Remember the man who used to sell Cromer&apos;s peanuts on the corner diagonal to your father&apos;s Gulf station? He&apos;d always be yelling, &quot;peanuts, git yer peanuts,&quot; while waving a bag around. Wonder what happened to him. He was an institution on that corner. Wasn&apos;t he in front of the S&amp;S Automotive place? The Shell station was on the lot that became the Jeep dealer&gt;drug store&gt;dentist, correct? In other words, and this is how I remember it: the McDonalds was on the northwest corner of that intersection, your father&apos;s Gulf station was on the southwest corner, the Shell station was on the southeast corner (and probably a major rival to your father&apos;s place) and the S&amp;S Automotive was on the northeast corner, which was the corner for the peanut guy. Is that correct?

That was Harvey Watkins. He died about 10 years ago. Seems like something happened to him shortly before his death, like either he was robbed, or in a car accident.

A&amp;W Drive-In was originally on the corner of 2 notch and Beltline in the 60&apos;s til around 1967 or there of..then it burned to the ground, then Chappy&apos;s was built there that had the double decker bus.. After that was torn down, McDonalds took over that spot I think.. but I dont remember Doug Broom&apos;s next to A&amp;W. The first BK Lounge is still across the street..it&apos;s a little smaller now, but it&apos;s still there.. I dont know about the one over in Cayce though.

Thanks, I knew someone would have that guy&apos;s name. Can&apos;t really remember the last time I saw him, but this blog reminded me of those days, and it occurred to me that I remember seeing him one day and then the next time I was driving by, he was gone. Don&apos;t remember anything about the peanut man in the paper, and he would have been in the paper because everybody remembers him if they are of the age and have spent any time at the intersection of Beltline and Two Notch.

I absolutely remember the A&amp;W Drive-In . If you want to go way back, for the first 4 years of my life we lived on Truman Street, and the corner of Two Notch and Beltline was a very important corner to my family. We ate at the A&amp;W at least once a week, maybe more. Boy would I love to have a picture of us in our then 13 year old black 1946 Oldsmobile with the food trays hanging from the window and the teen-aged carhop cutie putting the food down. It was a scene right out of &quot;American Graffiti.&quot; My first conscious memory of drinking root beer came from the A&amp;W soda fountain. I&apos;m sure many people old enough to remember the original A&amp;W on this corner would say that every time they drink a root beer today they are taken back to burger meals on window trays with lots of A&amp;W root beer at the corner of Two Notch Road and Beltline Boulevard.

If I had gotten out of the car and faced the intersection during one of those burger meals in 1959, diagonally across the intersection from the A&amp;W Drive-In I would have seen the sign for Maurice&apos;s Piggy Park next to the gas station on the corner. The Piggy Park was where Advance Auto Parts is today. Don&apos;t remember what was there before Maurice, I&apos;m not that old.

And I just noticed that my cardinal points for the various corners in the above post are wrong because that section of Two Notch is almost going due north and south. Should have looked at google first. Oops!
