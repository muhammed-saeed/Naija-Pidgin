Order Up! - WII - Review
 
Posted by: jkdmedia 
 Gamezone Review Rating 7.0 Good Before going entering Iron Chef or any other
 cooking competition, chefs must train for many years. They aren’t merely
 pros at slicing and dicing–they must be able to create the tastiest dish
 possible with whatever ingredients are provided. The chef that can pull that
 off is truly a master. 
 Order Up! is the beginning, middle and end of
 an Iron Chef-in-the-making. It doesn’t contain the official license, but
 you’ll recognize where the inspiration came from, which is not limited to
 television–Ratatouille’s infamous critic is cloned and dropped into the
 game for boss battle fun. The, umm, obesity of America is also taken into
 account, with amusing customers that appreciate your restaurant’s location
 (one guy loves it for being in between the gym and donut shop) and personal
 touches (another customer wants gravy on everything and tips well for it).
 These elements are used to mask what is essentially a new take on Cooking
 Mama. 

 

 Cooking Up a Storm 

 No one likes the thought of working at a QSR
 (quick-service restaurant) for the rest of their life. Thus, when Order
 Up!’s leading chef is forced to work in a hellacious burger joint, he jumps
 at the chance to escape. His way of escaping isn’t too exciting: he
 purchases a rundown fast food restaurant called Gravy Chug. Your menu is
 limited, your skills are lousy, and there aren’t enough dollars to stretch
 across multiple employees. One employee will eventually be awarded, and
 you’ll have the chance to hire others down the road to help with your
 cooking duties. But in the beginning it’s just you, a kitchen, and a whole
 lot of hungry customers. 

 When an order for a hamburger and fries comes
 your way, what do you do? Start by throwing the fries into the frying bin. A
 small meter appears, with two triangles (facing each other vertically)
 running from the left, uncooked side toward the right, burning side. When
 both triangles reach the center (green) part of the meter, you know your
 fries are ready to go. Yank them out of the fryer and drag them to the
 plate. All of these actions are performed with the Wii remote. 

 If there’s a vegetable–lettuce, tomatoes,
 etc.–you may have to slice them by chopping your Wii remote downward as a
 red circle shrinks around it (this is a timing game; the smaller the circle,
 the better the slice). Or dice them by chopping quickly and relentlessly.
 The game automatically turns the vegetable, allowing the player to keep
 swinging the remote without having to change positions. 

 

 The burger itself must be thrown onto the
 skillet, which uses the same meter as the frying bin. But since burgers
 aren’t being fried, you have to cook both sides individually. Once the top
 triangle (which designates the first side of the burger being cooked)
 reaches the green part of the meter, you need to flip the burger to cook the
 other side. It must be pulled from the skillet as soon as both sides are in
 the green area. If you go past or under, your burger may receive a lower
 rating than“perfect,”which lowers your income. 

 Money, as you’ll quickly learn, is the key to
 expansion. You can’t buy new restaurants without it. You can’t even acquire
 new spices or new recipes without a little dough (the green kind, of course–the other kind is best served with sauce, cheese and pepperoni). 

 Spices are an essential part of the Chef’s
 Special, unique dishes that, when prepared correctly, offer up a massive tip
 bonus. Tips are your only source of income, so you want to make the customer
 happy. One way to ensure that happens is by properly spicing their food. If
 you have a regular customer whose last name is Salty, you can probably
 figure out what he or she wants added to every dish. 

 Vampires are a little trickier. Toward the
 end of the game, after you’ve acquired the third or fourth (and final)
 restaurant, a guy appears that looks like The Count from Sesame Street. His
 big fangs are intriguing, but it’s his request that might throw you. His
 spice icon (purchased for a small fee to show what the customer wants) is a
 slab of meat. And that’s all he wants–a slab of raw meat. Whatever he
 orders, throw the meat on the grill or skillet (whichever is available) and
 immediately take it off. The“perfect”icon will appear, showing that his
 meat is just the way the vampire likes it. 

 There are other sneaky customers that aren’t
 overly clear in their demands. Figuring out what they want is part of the
 fun. 

 

 Inspector Gadget 

 As the owner and head chef of a restaurant,
 your duties do not end with slicing, dicing, grilling and frying. You’ll
 also have to clean seven plates to appease an angry inspector (how seven
 became the golden number I’ll never know), flick rats off the counter before
 a customer sees them, and grind a knife that’s become dull–all using the
 Wii remote. Contrary to the image on the back of the box, the Nunchuk is not
 used. 

 When you start your Order Up! career, the
 game is a little less inviting than Cooking Mama. The mechanics are decent
 and the mini-games aren’t that difficult. But you have to win to keep
 playing; if you make a lousy meal, even for just one person at a table of
 four, you won’t get any tip at all. 

 This makes the game harder in the short-term
 but easier toward the end. It won’t take more than a few hours to figure out
 the gist of Order Up!: follow the recipe and strive to achieve a perfect
 rating with each ingredient. Since most ingredients work the same (slicing
 or dicing a carrot is no different from slicing or dicing a pepper), you
 won’t have to learn a new mechanic every time you purchase a new restaurant.
 But new restaurants can’t be acquired until the current locale achieves a
 five-star rating. This is done by cleaning the place (hire a cleaning
 service to earn one star); acquiring all 12 recipes (two stars); acquiring
 four of the eight specials (three); earning a specific dollar amount (four);
 and by impressing the critic (five). 

 The critic is your most difficult customer:
 he wants perfection, he wants something special, and he wants it made
 quickly. This, coupled with the wide variety of tasks (trying to fry, boil
 and sautésimultaneously while grating cheese and chopping veggies) can be a
 tad overwhelming–even frustrating–in the first couple hours of play.
 That’s when hired help comes in handy, but they rarely do as good a job as
 you. Thus, when you get better at multi-tasking, it’s better to leave the
 employees behind and do everything yourself. 

 

 Order Up! culminates with hilarity and slight
 dilapidation. Having proven yourself as a chef, you’re now invited to a
 special cooking competition. The following sequences are funny but the
 gameplay is questionable: you’ll have to complete three dishes, and none of
 them have to be perfect. Your opponent won’t be perfect, so beating her is
 easy. Though you may appreciate the breather after having to prove yourself
 (four times!) to a critic that will scold you for even the slightest
 mistake, this seemed like a weak way to conclude a decent game. 

 Few will be blown away by anything Order Up!
 has to offer, but if you liked Cooking Mama, you will enjoy playing through
 this game as well. There aren’t any multiplayer options, and there isn’t
 much to do once the four restaurants have been completed. Consequently,
 replay is limited, making Order Up! a fair purchase for the cooking
 enthusiast but a rental for everyone else. 

 Review Scoring Details for Order Up! 
 
 Gameplay: 7
 The limited replay value prevents Order Up! from being a true Cooking
Mama-killer, but the recipe variety, amusing story and the overall fun feel of
the game will keep you entertained until the very end. 

 Graphics: 6
 Order Up!&apos;s kitchen visuals are weak, to say the least. The meat and veggie
designs are closer to that of a cartoon than the real thing. The character
models aren&apos;t impressive either, but their waddling movements and
stuff-their-face animations are pretty funny. 

 Sound: 7
 The music is so-so, but the voice-overs are hilarious. Listen to the
customers–their demands are very amusing. 

 Difficulty: Easy/Medium
 Once you figure out how to multi-task, the rest is simple. 

 Concept: 7
 Cooking Mama from an entrepreneurial perspective. 

 Overall: 7
 Fun while it lasts. Order Up! makes the idea of owning and running a
restaurant fun–even if the reality is a less riveting story.
