Dear Hometown IGA in Erwin, TN
I am interested in learning store management. I have supervised 8 employees on two shifts 7 days per week before, but in a hospital setting, where I hired, scheduled and gave evaluations. I have worked retail for Dillard’s department store for many years, closing cash registers and handling stock. I retired early from a responsible State position, but am not the type not to work until…I am responsible and dependable. I am computer literate, and am a hard worker. My family is grown and gone, so shift conflicts are not an issue. I wish to work in my town of Erwin, and have excellent references. Sincerely,
