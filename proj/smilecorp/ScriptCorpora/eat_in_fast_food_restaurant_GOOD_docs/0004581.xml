Bethany Jones&apos; Experience
 
 Office manager 

 Southern Academic Press, Precision Surgical Solutions, Nola Medical Group 
 


 May 2011 – Present (1 year 3 months) 

I have spent the past year running four subsidiary companies and filling roles that I was never trained for. I had no inkling that my position as Editorial Assistant for the publishing company, Southern Academic Press, would evolve into managing three other vastly unrelated companies.

I was originally hired last May to lay out and copy edit a journal designed for neurosurgery residents: The Journal of Neurosurgical Review. Last November my employer became partners with a local businessman who specializes in medical devices. My position then changed from Editorial Assistant to Office Manager of four companies: Southern Academic Press, Precision Surgical Solutions, Nola Medical Group, and Medicept. At this time, I started doing accounts payable and receivable, invoicing through Quickbooks, managing the company finances and checking the bank accounts, payroll, IT support, graphic designing, company taxes, researching, conducting employee interviews, and learning how to be a spine sales representative, which means I had to study the spine anatomy, attend surgeries in the operating room, and perform two procedures on a cadaver. Aside from the procedures on the cadaver, I had to learn how to do the rest of these responsibilities on my own via the Internet, product guides, Youtube, etc.

I graduated from UNO as an English major in May 2011 and by December of the same year I was essentially an Accountant, Spine Sales Rep, CPA, Advertiser, Publisher, and IT Tech all at once. I excelled in my position and became so integral to the company and my employers that I was given access to their personal bank accounts, emails, and scheduling.

I have gained more experience and practical knowledge in this past year than I have in my entire college and high school careers.
 
 Tech Fee Lab Student Lab Manager 

 University Computing and Communications 
 


 September 2007 – August 2010 (3 years) 

My responsibility as Lab Manager was to oversee the other student workers in the computer lab. I created work schedules and frequently sent out emails regarding lab policies and procedures. In the lab, I assisted customers with basic functions in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Reader, Microsoft Powerpoint, and Internet Explorer.

 July 2010 – July 2010 (1 month) 

I was instructed to look through the company&apos;s 2005 cases and identify/save specific documents. These documents included police reports, a representative picture or two, Affidavits, statement summaries, contracts, and/or letter of dismisal. We were also instructed to use our best judgement to save other potential important documents. Any other document that was not in the aforementioned categories was pulled aside and shredded. At the end of the four week period, I had excavated over 50 filing drawers, averaging five drawers per day.
 
 Editor-in-Chief 

 Driftwood: University of New Orleans Community Newspaper 
 


 July 2009 – May 2010 (11 months) 

As Editor-in-Chief I was responsible for creating a weekly newspaper in which I copy-edited articles, formatted ads and pictures with Adobe Photoshop, and created a layout with Adobe InDesign. At weekly meetings I assigned my staff members their articles. I assigned the photographers their photo assignments, as well. I was also responsible for responding professionally to received emails in three accounts: DriftwoodEditor@uno.edu, Driftwood@uno.edu, and Driftwoodads@uno.edu.
