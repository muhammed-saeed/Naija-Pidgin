 Everything... I have the most random heartburn. I have meticulously kept track of my eating for a month and went back through it later and everytime I got heartburn it seemed to be because of a totally different food group. Its actually very annoying because my heartburn is thus random and I never know when to expect it.

Me too. Mine was mostly stress related and also hormone related. I stared taking something a few days ago and it seems to be working. Things I wouldn&apos;t think would cause it did, and other things I would think would have caused it didn&apos;t.

I know! I was addicted to Taco Salads and would have one every day for lunch and I got heartburn like once. I layed off the tacos and they got worse. One day I was really craving a taco so I had one... no heartburn. Went back to my taco regime...no heartburn. Would go out to dinner and order a burger... heartburn. I mean a burger? Seriously.

 Bell Peppers, sometimes called Green Peppers. Also bananas. I can&apos;t eat either without extreme discomfort shortly thereafter, like someone blowing a basketball up in my upper chest and throat. It&apos;s very painful so I avoid those things.

 Green peppers...although I love them, I can&apos;t eat them. The yellow and red don&apos;t seem to bother me so I eat those instead and they are just as good. I heard some where once that the green peppers aren&apos;t ripe yet that&apos;s why they give you heartburn.

 Salsa, Spicy foods, Chilie, etc... I get acid reflux and I know that spicey foods can be one of the culprets. Watch them. Eliminate them to see if it works in getting rid of them, if it does go away, then it is those foods.

 I have a friend who had heartburn all the time.
Traced it to a few things - smoking, eating late
at night and then going to sleep (a heavy meal, not
a snack) and not eating meals at regular intervals,
(waiting all day and eating only one meal, which would
also cause him to gorge himself because he would be
too hungry).

 Anything with a lot of acid. I love chocolate, can eat tons of it. But if I don&apos;t chuck it, it can open the big acid faucet up on me for days. This causes extreme pain.
Smoking can also cause acid to pour into your esophagus.
Cut down on carbonated drinks.
Don&apos;t eat at bedtime.
If you go to bed soon after eating, the acid will flow into your esophagus causing, you to be up most of the night. You want to eat then do it 3-4 hours prior to.
Also if I eat big meals. So I eat a few smaller ones.
Fatty foods will also cause acid build up.
