 March 23, 2011 That&apos;s What She Fed The food was incredibly cheap, tasty and well constructed. Savarino&apos;s also offers an array of Italian pastries, so we ordered a few florentine cookies to-go. More from That&apos;s What She Fed

 July 5, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Subpar Food and Service - Avoid!! by John ( 1 review ) Meat Lasagna and Carmello Savarino Sandwich -
I&apos;ve lived in Nashville all my life, so when Diners Drive-Ins, and Dives featured Savarino&apos;s my wife and I had to try it. We were GREATLY disappointed with the food and service. I went for the Meat Lasagna which was drowned in a greasy bolognese sauce. No bread, no salad, just a square of mediocre oily lasagna. My wife went for a lemon grilled chicken sandwich. It wasn&apos;t bad, but there are better sandwiches in Nashville within walking distance of this place. Finally, the service was awful. The girl at the counter could easily be described as&quot;Princess Thundercloud.&quot;She obviously thought she was doing US a favor by taking our order. We will not return. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful May 4, 2012 Mobile review by KKL ( 1 review ) I was excited to go there when I was in town after seeing in on Triple D. What a let down. It&apos;s a dive without a doubt. However, the chicken parm was unimpressive as was the lasagna. Why you ask???? Omg!!! Too much salt. I&apos;m going to be a puffer fish later. The food was fine, Not worth the stop. June 19, 2011 Likes it Rose Palermo Sandwich by Cousin Kevin ( 71 reviews ) Rose Palermo Sandwich -
Grilled chicken, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers and marinara sauce. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful February 11, 2011 Likes it Just like Nana used to make by SharpShooter ( 57 reviews ) When you come in this small place you see a sign telling you it will not be fast as every dish is hand made and done right. This is very true and well worth the wait. The staff was like family and we just love it. Made me miss my Italian family back home. Guy F. had them on his show and that is who they are. Family owned, family run and family good food! February 5, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Gregory McCubbin ( 106 reviews ) Good food, well priced, but be prepared to wait. Took us an hour to get our food. Also, it closes at 8PM, so if you order after 7PM, you have to get take out. January 22, 2012 Eh.. by Shawn McCarter ( 2 reviews ) Visited Savarino&apos;s because it was on Diners, Drive-ins, and dives. Won&apos;t go back. Not because it wasn&apos;t good, or that the service wasn&apos;t great (wasn&apos;t great, by the way), but because it didn&apos;t live up to the hype generated by the show. The pasta (linguini) was good - not great. The sauce was good, again, not great. Now... please understand that I would have to drive a number of hours to get to Nashville from where I live. Having said that, if I have to drive that far, I would probably like to try something other than Savarino&apos;s. Not bad, but just not great. Sorry guys. Could have been so much better. January 22, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Bunny ( 1 review ) Awful service, staff was rude, we waited 50 minutes for a sandwich and it was cold! Would never return!! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful November 27, 2011 Likes it There&apos;s only one reason to go... by David ( 12 reviews ) The food. Incredible Italian Sandwiches. The eggplant and broccoli rab is sublime. The sausage may be the best I&apos;ve ever had. The cold cuts raise luncheon meat to a new level. Come prepared to wait longer than you&apos;re prepared to wait and you&apos;ll be a happy camper. February 24, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Rachel McCubbin ( 15 reviews ) Delicious and adorable! They make a mean stuffed shell! Go early in the day to avoid a long wait. January 1, 2012 Really likes it Mobile review by Max Trenkle ( 2 reviews ) I traveled 30 minutes to Nashville every Monday for two years just to eat a delicious sandwich. It was worth it. I&apos;ve moved, But every chance I get, I stop by for a sandwich, some pasta, or an AMAZING dessert. People complain about the service. There is no service. It&apos;s family owned. They aren&apos;t paid to clean your mess or entertain you. It&apos;s a family business and they make incredible food. You have to wait for the food, so don&apos;t go if you want something quick. Go when you want to relax and enjoy yourself. This is a place where you can order anything and enjoy it. It&apos;s truly fantastic. October 10, 2011 Tiny portions, outragious pprice. by klroge01 ( 1 review ) My friend and I were suckered in by the Diners, Drive-in&apos;s and Dives hype. We were in Nashville for a concert and thought we&apos;d try one of Guy&apos;s recommendations. WHAT A MISTAKE!! I really liked the look /feel of the neighborhood. We arrived at Savarino&apos;s Cucina at 11:45 on a Friday and there was absolutely NO PARKING so we figured there would be a wait. Being Friday and lunchtime we were prepared. We finally pried our small car into a non-space behind the restaurant. Parking in back was a mistake because we got a preview of how poorly maintained the building/back lot are, a taste (pun intended) of things to come? There were a few tables occupied on the front patio and only one table occupied inside. I have no idea where all the people who belonged to the cars in front and back were hiding. If the cars were employees there need to be alternate arrangements made for staff parking. The logistics of ordering are not obvious.

If the cars were employees there need to be alternate arrangements made for staff parking. The logistics of ordering are not obvious. A small&quot;Order at the front counter&quot;sign would be a major improvement. We waited at least ten minutes for a staff member to come to the counter to take our order. The arrangement of counter, kitchen and tables is not well designed or even tidy. The kitchen is way too far away from the counter and many more tables could be included in the layout. It all seems randomly arranged, without any thought being put into service. We ordered a stuffed artichoke and two orders of the Chicken val&quot;D&quot;Aosta. For drinks, the restaurant has a self-serve cooler. I was happy with a bottle of water but my friend wanted a diet soda. There were no diet sodas available, NONE . COME ON! We were given a number after ordering then seated ourselves. And we WAITED, and WAITED! One hour later, some 18-20 year old guy comes out and smacks down our plates and scurries back into the kitchen without so much as an,&quot;Anything else&quot;The stuffed artichoke was bad, barely any stuffing, which is the point of stuffing an artichoke. The chicken and pasta were tasty and the sauce was GREAT but we were served about ½ cup of pasta and a small piece of meat. Menu price for that dish $12.95 is OUTRAGIOUS!! June 5, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Michael ( 3 reviews ) Very good food. Made the wrong pizza but quickly replaced it and adjusted the bill. Friendly service, but you do have to wait. Rice ball was unique but tasty. July 17, 2011 Food&apos;s good, but don&apos;t go for the ambiance by krisfday ( 2 reviews ) Not much to say about this. The building could use a lot of repair, remodeling, and some TLC on the inside and out, but the food is okay and the price is right. With all the other restaurants available, I&apos;d probably go somewhere else, but if I had the Italian craving and was in the area, I&apos;d stop in again for the foof. We got there at about 12:15 on a Saturday and there were a few tables with customers. It smelled good and the cashier gave us a folded, paper menu to take to the table of our choosing to decide on our meal. We went back to the counter and ordered and was given our drinks and a number, which we took to our table. The food arrived in an appropriate period on time and the food was as we expected, not exceptional, but pretty good. There was not follow-up wait service and the customer is expected to clean the table, as in a fast food restaurant. The dishes were piled high around the trash can, though the kitchen staff had been close by at least times to deliver food since we were there. February 14, 2011 Really likes it Mobile review by Dortch ( 1 review ) Might be the BEST marinara sauce in Nashville...worth the long wait. Try the rice ball for an appetizer. November 25, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Hehehe ( 3 reviews ) Precious and delicious. March 25, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Jean Mitchell ( 1 review ) Nonexistent service. Waited 65 minutes for 2 sandwiches and 2 child sized bowls of plain pasta. March 11, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Jarad Clement ( 1 review ) Great food, the best chicken parmigiana I&apos;ve ever had! But, just&quot;okay&quot;service. The woman at the counter had zero personality, and they don&apos;t offer any of that incredible bread to dip in the irresistible sauce that is left over. All in all, a good restaurant and I would recommend it to any Italian food fan.
