 Title: CAD Drawings For Fast Food Chain

 Location: England
 
Job Description 

We require a CAD designer to provide CAD plans for new branches of a fast food restaurant chain.

The chain will be opening between 20 and 30 new locations this year so we require someone who will be able to produce plans for each location.

The chain already has established restaurant fit outs and so the plans will be very straightforward for anyone who knows what they are doing. It has basically a template fit out based on the original designs.

I have attached drawings from one of the restaurants as a guide for what is required.

Your bid should include the following:

- Site visit to measure up and discuss layout with client.
- Full internal CAD plans (floorplan and 2 internal elevations) showing partitions, electrical layouts, lighting, furniture, kitchen appliances, staff/customer toilets.
- Exterior CAD elevation showing signage (essential for planning permission and advertising consent).

Please provide an all inclusive cost for the above including 2 sets of changes to agree the final layout.

If you are able to provide before/after visuals for exterior signage, please also quote for that as an additional cost.

Lastly, if you could also provide a cost for a smaller unit that would be very helpful.

Budget is extremely tight for this project, but it is repeat business and will provide good, regular work.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Hi,

Is the £2000 top end budget for each location? Or the total for producing drawings for 20-30 locations? I work for a firm of specialist retail architects and we&apos;d be able to do this if the budget is per location.

Regards,

Pete Benson

Hi there Pete

For each location, of course! It would be slavery to ask someone to do this for 20-30 locations!

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Cheers P. B. on 08/02/2012 15:53 
Hi Nisa,

I suspected as much, but just thought it was worth clarifying before bidding!

Thanks. D. S. on 08/02/2012 16:42 
Hi Nisa,

what&apos;s the square footage of the site you are referring to? M. S. on 08/02/2012 23:24 
Hello Nisa,

Is this a closed bid, I would like to bid on this but as it is not classified as a design project I am unable to

thanks

Hi Nisa
In respect to the measured surveys of the existing structures, is this undertaken by others? or would the bid include such work. Would the work include planning permissions/listed building consents/building regulation drawings.
I am familiar with all the above and believe I believe I could pit a realistic budget cost to you but would like some additional info if possible.

Many thanks

Hi

Please could you tell where abouts in the country the projects are?

Thanks M. A. on 13/02/2012 13:35 
Hi Nisa

I am assuming that as a food chain store you have a firm that specializes in the design of the kitchen area and livery (external corporate look of the building).

Are measured surveys of the existing structures undertaken by others also?

I assume the work includes:
-planning permissions
-listed building consents
-building regulation drawings.

I can provide this if necessary but need to know if that has already been carried out, or needs to form part of the bid.

I am familiar with all the above and know I can put a realistic budget cost to you but would like some clarification please? B. L. on 14/02/2012 20:44 
Hi Nisa,

Just a quick question, are these site spread out all over the UK or split down into regions?
How long will you expect this to last? Im ready to start.
