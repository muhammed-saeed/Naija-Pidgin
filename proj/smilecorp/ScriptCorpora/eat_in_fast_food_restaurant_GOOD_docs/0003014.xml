Can you sue if you find hair in your food?
 In: Civil Lawsuits [ Edit categories ]

This all depends on if the food was processed or if you were in a restaurant. Either way you will spend too much money to take it to court ,it would not be worth the trouble. If you were served in a restaurant, you can show the hair and ask for another serving, or if you lost your appetite you can tell them you refuse to pay for your meal. This would be understandable.
