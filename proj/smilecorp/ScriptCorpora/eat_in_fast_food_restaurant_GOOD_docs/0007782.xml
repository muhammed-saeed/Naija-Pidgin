The 7 Worst Restaurant Foods in America
 Tweet Pin It Share on Tumblr

 We all enjoy eating away from home from time to time and try to make smart choices when we do. Sometimes we sabotage all our best efforts and give in to a moment of weakness. The more you know about Diet Friendly Dining when you are eating Food on the Run the more you will be able to resist temptation.

Recently Eat This, Not That outlined the 20 Worst Restaurant Foods in America . Here are seven you should avoid if at all possible.


 Quizno&apos;s Large Tuna Melt - While tuna is a good protein source, when it is mixed with high fat dressings the negatives far outweigh the positives. Add to that a large portion size and you manage to create a 1,700-calorie sandwich that provides 133 grams of fat including 26 grams of saturated fat along with more than 2100 mg of sodium.

 Chili&apos;s Smokehouse Bacon Triple Cheese Big Mouth Burger with Jalapeno Ranch Dressing - Obviously when it takes more than a line to write the title there are too many items in the sandwich for it to be low calorie. This sandwich includes items from a variety of food groups but for most people watching their weight, it also includes more calories than they should have for the entire day with about 1900 calories as well as 138 grams of fat and a whopping 4,201mg of sodium.

 On the Border Firecracker Stuffed Jalapenos with Chili con Queso - If you are sharing this appetizer with others and only enjoying a taste you are probably fine. However, enjoying the entire 1,950-calorie appetizer yourself will also contribute 134 grams of fat not to mention more than 6,000 mg of sodium to your daily intake.

 P.F. Chang&apos;s Combo Lo Mein - This noodle dish with chicken, shrimp, beef and pork is recommended to be two servings which helps lower the calorie and sodium damage to your daily intake. However, if you are super hungry and choose to enjoy the entire entre you will find your daily intake has been set back an additional 1,968 calories, 96 grams of fat and 5,860 mg of sodium.

 Romano&apos;s Macaroni Grill Parmesan Crusted Sole - A couple of servings a fish each week is recommended for healthy eating however how your fish is prepared does make a difference. This fried fish entre covered in cheese contributes a massive 2,190 calories, 141 grams of fat and 2,980 mg of sodium.

 Chili&apos;s Fajita Quesadillas Beef with Rice and Beans with Four Flour Tortillas and Condiments - Fix-it-yourself dishes can be a great way to control portion sizes and limit higher fat condiments that can quickly increase the calorie count. However, they can also hide total intakes when you have more than one like in this complete entre that includes four servings and a total of 2,240 calories, 92 grams of fat and 6,390 mg of sodium.

 Uno&apos;s Chicago Grill Classic Deep Dish Individual Pizza - Chicago style pizza is delicious and selecting an individual pizza can seem like a great way to limit the nutritional damage. When you are talking about deep pizza, it is important to remember that all that space provides plenty of room for extra cheese, sauce, and toppings, which contribute over 2,300 calories, 165 grams of fat and 4, 920 mg of sodium as well.
Since most of these food items provide more calories, fat and sodium than recommended for an entire days healthy diet, they are best left on the menu and not on your table.

 What are the BEST entre alternatives you have found to replace these seven when enjoying a meal away from home?

 If there is no nutritional information offered - you will not find me there. It may seem a little crazy but when my husband and I choose to go out to eat, I research the menus online and the nutrition information before we go. Drives him a little crazy sometimes. :) Honestly, when I first started doing this, i was SURPRISED at how unhealthy of the foods are. Now, I keep a list of things from certain restaurants that is okay to eat.

And be aware of those fancy restaurant salads - they deceive you!! They are not as healthy as you think! ;)

 According to Quizno&apos;s posted nutritional information, the large tuna melt is 1520 calories. Still a large amount, but let&apos;s double check our facts before posting something as true which is not! There is no need to exagerate to make your point.

 I am wondering where this article got its information because my daughter works at Romano&apos;s Macaroni Grill, they list all the menu items nutritional information on their website and the Crusted Sole is listed as 990 calories, 18 grams of fat, and 1290mg sodium and that includes the side dish of Italian couscous. While not the healthiest item you could ever eat, it is not nearly as bad as the articles listed 2190 calories and 141 grams of fat.

 Some of these items are shocking! Who knew you could turn some basic ingredients that are beneficial into such awful concoctions. it seems that sauces are partly to blame. Glad I dislike mayo, sour cream, guacomole, or cheese on a hamburger.

 I hate cooking and go out to eat once a week. I can eat healthy, or I can choose not to but it&apos;s my decision. I rarely eat my entire meal, I always bring 1/2 home to eat later that evening or to take to work the next day. I have my favorites so I pretty much know which choices are the best because I go to websites to get the facts.
However, I tried Jason&apos;s Deli Friday after work, got 1/2 a sandwich, baked chips and soup and was feeling really proud of myself because I thought I was really eating within my calorie range and had calories left for the evening. When I went to their website to add my food to the food tracker, I was shocked at the calories in some of their foods. Luckily I had fewer calories at work that day so didn&apos;t go over, but if I go back, I will have to research what I want to eat ahead of time. I guess I was thinking because everything is organic, it would also be better calorie counts - NOT!

 I worked as a hostess, server, and bartender at Chilis for a little over 4 years while in and immediately after college. Lets just say I am not the least bit surprised that they made this list twice. I made good money working there...but I also gained about 110 pounds over the course of those 4 years. We got our meals half price and sometimes free if we worked doubles. The price was right...and the food tasted good. I guess I partially have Chilis to thank for discovering Spark...ugh I want to head to the gym just thinking about it now.

 Well, I don&apos;t see McDonald&apos;s on the list. Many have pointed out that the nutrition info is there for consumer to read and pointed out that the name alone indicates a 5 alarm fire. An occasional meal like this might be ok but, it&apos;s the folks who make this a regular routine that worry me. Eating out is an expensive way to not have dishes to wash.

 Those may be scary meals in the calorie department, but let us not forget about appetizers. Take the following as an example. I like Red Robin, their burgers taste good and I love the unlimited steak fries. While I&apos;m waiting for my meal I decide I want to have an appetizer.

1374 Calories - Chili Cheese con Queso (appetizer)
0936 Calories - Burnin&apos; Love Burger (meal)
0434 Calories - Serving of Steak Fries

2744 Calories for just one meal, and lord knows that you never just have 1 serving of those Steak Fries, let alone that a single refill basket is actually 2 servings. They&apos;ve also really good milk shakes!

 I do like Chilles,&amp;Quizno&apos;s, but don&apos;t go there very often. And I am always careful to try to choose healthier options. I ask, or atleast read about how it is prepared. It&apos;s so not worth it ri me to have a days calories in one meal,&amp;it&apos;s certainly not healthy for your body. I think it&apos;s crazy anyone would want to eat all that. As it is, I think we already have too big a portions at most restaurants.

 Pretty much every restaurant has nutritional information available to any guest that requests it. Many dishes that sound harmless are actually dripping with hydrogenated oils and coated in seasoned salt--do your homework. Word of warning: I managed at one of the prevalent restaurants mentioned in the list for several years, and although you may be ordering a healthful dish that tested with reasonable calories and fat it may not necessarily make it to your plate that way. It is usually easier and faster for the cooks to prepare your food the same greasy way they prepare everything else. Once, I ordered an item from the &quot;healthy&quot; menu, and it came to me the regular way, just with vegetables instead of fries. This was a 600 calorie difference from what I ordered! Be wary...

 Hmmm, these fat gram numbers do not seem right to me. I&apos;m sure these sandwiches are very fatty and calorie laden, but 133 grams of fat? 133 grams = 4.69143694 ounces. That is more than 1 stick of butter.

 I went to Quizno&apos;s website and the numbers for their Tuna Melt is for the Large Sandwich and 1750 Cal with Fat Cal being 1210 and Sodium 1940, Carbs 82 Protein 51 and Sugar 10. The sub without dressing and cheese was 1260 cal. and the cheese is 110 and the dressing is 370. This is the total cal count of 1740. I am glad that I don&apos;t eat out at those places. Never had anything on the list.

 this is getting old but still true.....eat balanced every 3 hours, snack on a fruit/yogurt/skim milk in between and by the time you get to one of these restaurants, your tummy would reject these disaster dishes outright....cuz there simply is no space to gulp this down (stomach just tells your brains it&apos;s way too full for it) moreover, your metabolic rate climbs up...which is always a good thing!

 TYPO?

Really, 133 grams of fat in the Quizno&apos;s Large Tuna Melt? I&apos;m still not entirely sure it&apos;s not a typo. But then the others are just as scary.

And honestly, if you order something with the words &quot;bacon tripple cheese big moth&quot; in the name, you just know you&apos;re ruining your calory track for the day, just not by how much maybe. I admit I would have thought it difficult to pack 2000 calories into one dish.

Then again, throw enough bacon and cheese into something and you get something that&apos;ll make your cholesterol levels go up by looking at it.

 By the way, *because* I keep my carbs low and eat enough fat (which is way more than &quot;the experts&quot; say you should eat), my appetite is in normal range and I never have a desire to eat any of the dishes on this list. I never even heard of them and I&apos;d gross out if I was served one of them. I have to *remember* to eat and try to get at least 2000 calories a day. If they&apos;d leave all the sugar and starchy garbage out I might consider one of these foods, but of course they won&apos;t, so I&apos;ll stick with my occasional Baconator, or just fix a steak at home. Sliced thin and dipped in butter. Real butter, not franken-margarine. Mmmmmm.

 People, there&apos;s no evidence that saturated fat causes heart disease, diabetes, or anything else. None. Zero. Zip. Every time I see someone claim that there is evidence, and they&apos;re silly enough to link to the actual study (and that&apos;s darned few of them--I don&apos;t think they even understand what they&apos;re seeing, to be honest, I&apos;d hate to think they&apos;re deliberately lying), I go look and I see NOTHING about the researchers feeding two groups of people the exact same food only with different fat content. I see where they made people fill out questionnaires instead. THEN, on top of that, I see where they did not control for other variables like sugar and excess starch consumption.

THOSE are the bugaboos. The science is pretty darned solid by now. Excess refined carb can even lead to high blood pressure because it elevates insulin, which in turn damages arterial linings, which in turn destroys your body&apos;s ability to tell whether your blood pressure needs increasing or not. Because low blood volume will kill you faster than high blood volume, your body chooses to err on the side of caution.

I can eat Baconators without the bun and still lose weight. I can eat full-fat cheese and still lose weight. I can eat full-fat salad dressing and still lose weight--and you should too! You can&apos;t get any nutritional benefit out of the carotenes in salad if you don&apos;t eat it with an accompanying fat. Preferably olive oil. (Most salad dressings are loaded with soybean oil instead. Bad scene.)

I tell people over and over, go read Gary Taubes... if you can look at his sources and tell me exactly what&apos;s wrong with them then knock yourself out... I notice most people don&apos;t even bother getting through his book and I include bloggers and media personnel in that count, I mean who has time to *read* anymore? But knowing the facts is the only way we&apos;re going to get out of this chronic-disease mess for good.

Try Weston Price&apos;s Nutrition and Physical Degeneration while you&apos;re at it... an eye-opening read, and a bit shorter. With pictures, even.

 Have you all noticed the recent &quot;meme&quot; of the last few years, that of &quot;comfort food&quot;?
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme 

This phrase, &quot;comfort food&quot; has quietly stormed our culture, there&apos;s hardly a day I don&apos;t hear this apologetic misleading phrase, sometimes multiple times in a day, such a lovely sounding phrase, quite effectively glossing over concerns for high-fat-high-sodium unhealthy food... sometimes absurdly or grotesquely unhealthy as this article points out. Those concerned with healthy eating, should start their own &quot;meme&quot; or catch-phrase called something like &quot;early-death-food&quot;, or &quot;heart-attack-food&quot;, or some other clever acronym or phrase that will catch on.

 Wawa makes 4 inch subs. If you make it with turkey or ham, all of the veggies and no cheese, it can be a very satisfying lunch or dinner. Just go easy on the pickled condiments, they will make the sodium levels go through the roof.
Wendy&apos;s still serves a basic baked potato. That is always a safe bet when you are on the road and you don&apos;t want to break your healthy habits.
I also tend to eat sushi (cooked), which is also not overly processed, and a bento box with six to eight pieces is always satisfying and not excessive. I don&apos;t use the soy sauce to avoid sodium.

All the foods mentioned in this article are crazy restaurant concoctions that through excessive advertising make you believe are normal every day fare. I just don&apos;t get it. Every place serves crazy dishes like the &quot;Baconater&quot; or the &quot;Angus Bacon and Cheese.&quot; Heart attack food! The cheese and bacon are oozing out of the products and soon to be oozing out of somebody&apos;s arteries. We&apos;re talking gourmand here, not gourmet.

 Okay... all restaurants have some items that are over the top with calories, but as a manager at Chili&apos;s and as a veteran HCG Dieter... I can assure you that there are items you can eat that are healthy! While on my 500 calorie diet for HCG, I am eating my lunch at Chili&apos;s every day. I have lost 40 pounds since April. Just because the name is Chili&apos;s or Applebee&apos;s or Ruby Tuesday, doesn&apos;t mean you have to choose to eat the food items that have the calorie overload.

 My sister - a fellow sparker - and I recently ate at On The Border. First we requested no chips. Then we ordered grilled fish tacos with a side of rice and black beans. We asked for the chipolte mayo on the side. They arrived on two small corn tortillas. We dipped our fork very sparingly in the mayo and enjoyed every bite. We ate the beans and a forkful or two of the rice. We both agreed that the portion was just right to comfortably fill us but not overly.

 At On The Border, Iorder the Fajita Salad (usually with beef, though chicken would be better). I ask them to leave off the cheese and the tortilla strips, and I use salsa as the dressing instead of whatever the dressing choice is. That means the salad is mostly greens, salsa, and beef, and it tastes fantastic. \o/

Most places, I try to stick to a salad with added meat (I need the protein), and I get the dressing on the side (light dressing if possible). Watch out for added cheese-- many restaurants (like Denny&apos;s) throw that on without even mentioning it.

I read a statistic that said that restaurant food is off on its calorie calculations by as much as 10 percent. So I add 10 percent to the count on everything.

Before I go to eat, I run the name of the restaurant (Village Inn, Chili&apos;s, etc.,) through MyFoodDiary, The Daily Plate or other nutrition site. I scan the menu ahead so I know what are good options. Sometimes I do this on my iPhone while sitting at the table, even. Add 10 percent to the calories to be on the safe side.

If it&apos;s not a chain restaurant, then I will sit right there and google specific dishes on my iPhone, thereby saving myself zillions of calories on surprisingly hefty Indian dishes, etc.

We all know to get the dressing on the side, etc. I actually don&apos;t use dressing, just salt and pepper.

But mostly, I live at Subway. They are in every city, it seems, and although I&apos;m a little weary of the menu, it does reliably keep the calories down and the nutrition up. Taco Bell has a &quot;fresca menu&quot; of healthy stuff now, and I carry the nutrition sheet in my purse.

McDonald&apos;s grilled chicken sandwiches are not a complete disaster. Burger King will make a veggie whopper, basically a burger without the meat, that gets the calories and fat way down and tastes reasonably okay.

Taco Time is far and away better nutritionally than Taco Bell. Just don&apos;t eat the whole burrito or wrap. The chicken chili is a good choice, although high in sodium.

Pita Pit is good, too.

 I eat out seldom. I find what is best for me is to check out the menu and nutrition facts online. With allergies and other health concerns it really is helpful. Thank you for the information. Isn&apos;t it wild to find out the truth about what some of us have been eating outside of the home?

 I can&apos;t eat any gluten so we out infrequently. When we do go out it is usually a local Thai restaurant and I get 2 more meals out of my serving at home. When I really crave a burger and don&apos;t feel like cooking, we order out from Carls, Jr and I get the simplest burger in a lettuce wrap.

 I&apos;m like others here in that the sauces, cheesey, and fat- and sodium-laden foods don&apos;t appeal to me, or even taste good anymore. I don&apos;t eat out often, but when I do I&apos;m really picky about menu items and/or choices. I also get a take-home container and divide the food right away and only leave healthy portions on my plate. Not only do restaurants (chain or local) have very high calorie and sodium items on their menu, they all seem to serve 2 or 3 times the amount of food you need to eat. They seem to be competing to see who can get the most food on a plate! Not only should you watch WHAT you eat, but HOW MUCH you eat, as portion control is a huge part of success on this journey.

 These foods are horrible. A doggy bag is a good idea, but still you will be consuming a large amount of calories even if you were to eat half the meal. Some of them will still be in the 1,000 calorie range for one meal. Also the sodium amount is out of this world. It is best to just cook your meals at home so you know what you are getting.

 I think the best thing when eating out is portion control. I definitely agree with people who say to order your meal and immediately get the doggy bag and split everything in half before you dive in. Thanks for the eye popping post!

 We rarely eat at national chains like those listed here. When we do go out, it&apos;s more likely to be a local restaurant - but that also means you&apos;re not likely to find any calorie counts listed. We usually have leftovers to take home - e.g. watch portion sizes.

So the only thing I can suggest is to request the dressing on the side (or ask for vinegar&amp;oil) - sprinkle a few drops onto your salad. The fresh taste of the ingredients will have more room to shine and you&apos;ll cut down on calories!

 I completely disagree with the Quiznos sandwich. Getting it without mayo and splitting it 3 ways makes for an inexpensive (less than $2 per person!), satisfying dinner for only about 500 calories. The rest of this looks awful though.
