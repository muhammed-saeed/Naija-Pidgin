Love it! I eat here pretty often, it&apos;s addicting. The service is always prompt and I have never had a mistake on my order. They are always friendly and they make you feel well taken care of.

Love the sandwiches.  Love the peppermint shakes.  Love the peach shakes.

I hate the Closed on Sunday thing.  Don&apos;t think we don&apos;t notice when you have contractors working on your restaurant on Sundays (parking lot repair, for example).  It&apos;s a turn off.  It&apos;s not me, it&apos;s you.

Excellent playscape they actually clean. Friendly staff - good breakfast food.  Actually had staff come by and refill my coffee.  Egg and bisket platter is a god deal. Free wi-fi means I can get a bit of work done while kiddos are burning up some of those cinnamon rolls.  Late breakfasts are quiet - starts to get quite busy around 11:30.  Gets slow again around 2:00.

Do. Not. Go. Here!!!!!! Im not even kidding..

My reasons :
My chicken was undercooked. Twice.
They don&apos;t have everything on the menu.
This place employs a 14year old kid.
I asked for a wrap without cheese, they said, &quot;we don&apos;t have any&quot;. Twice.

Did they give me fries instead of the fruit cup, or did I fail to specify the fruit cup in my drive-through order? They&apos;re messing with my head, but I&apos;m pretty sure I ordered it.

Either way, I went in to plead my case, received fruit cup without demur. I still think I ordered it, but have learned to trust no one and to appreciate quick reparation over accuracy.

Thanks for being cool about it.

Cedar Park, TX
 12/5/2010 3 Check-ins Here 
Why am I a reviewing a chain restaurant? I&apos;ll tell you why. Chick-Fil-A is best in its class of fast food restaurants and I want to make a philosophical point about the fact that we should all be the best we can be and not the best we can be paid. So this review is more about the chain as a whole than this location that I frequent the most.

&quot;Chick-Fil-A&quot; is my standard response to the overused cliche explanation of &quot;You get what you pay for&quot;. We live in a world that is tolerating poor service more and more all the time and we are all &quot;buying it&quot; so long as it is cheap. I always get crappy service in fast foot restaurants and it pisses me off. My friends who see that this gets under my skin are always quick to defend the crappy service with &quot;What do you expect? They don&apos;t get paid squat&quot;. To which I reply &quot;Bull crap. Do the employees at Chick-Fil-A get paid double or triple what these guys get?&quot;

Here is how my experiences at Chick-Fil-A compare to my experience at every other fast food restaurant:

Chick-Fil-A: I am promptly and cheerfully greeted by an employee that is outwardly projecting that they are happy to work there. The staff I see always appear to be doing their very best and are doing it with pride.

Standard fast food restaurant: I get greeted by a disinterested person who appears miserable to be working there. This is usually accompanied by a &quot;go to hell&quot; attitude during the ordering and payment process. Of course, it&apos;s the customers fault that they are stuck in this low paying job. The staff are usually going out of there way to sink as little effort into their work as humanly possible.

Chick-Fil-A: I am provided with a straw and ample napkins every time I go through the drive-thru.

Standard fast food restaurant: Half the time at the drive-thru I don&apos;t get the straw or napkins without asking for them. Really? How am I suppose to drink this, meat-head? What am I going to wipe my mouth clean with afterward? It doesn&apos;t occur to the person providing service that every human being deserves these basic accommodations every time.

Chick-Fil-A: I am provided with ample catsup for consumption with fries.

Standard fast food restaurant: Yep. I have to ask for catsup too. When I do I get the &quot;How many packets do you need?&quot; response. &quot;Hell I don&apos;t know, you moron. I need as many packets as it takes to dip the top quarter inch of every fry. How many do you suppose that is? How about you just throw a handful of packets in there and we&apos;ll see what happens&quot;. Gimme a break. Do you really need to save money by cutting down on condiment distribution?.

Chick-Fil-A: Here in Austin I have observed at busy locations during peak times and heavy congestion employees with radios are out in the parking lot taking orders from customers in the drive-thru lane well ahead of the actual automated drive-thru menu in order to expedite the ordering process and keep the traffic moving quickly. It works!

Standard fast food restaurant: Not a chance they would do something to improve the long wait at peak times. You can wait in line in the hot sun until you starve or die of boredom for all they care. Hell they would be happy to see you take your business elsewhere. There not about to do anything out of the ordinary.

Chick-Fil-A: The interior is always clean and the bathrooms are as well. I&apos;m never disgusted to eat in there or to use their bathroom facilities.

Standard fast food restaurant: Hit or miss on the cleanliness. I mean they got to do the minimum I suppose so the health department doesn&apos;t shut them down. So I usually see some marginal employee with a rag dragging their heels and doing the absolute minimum cleaning. The bathrooms are usually an embarrassment.

The only distinction in benefits for the employees that I can obviously point to is the that the company&apos;s corporate culture places huge value on family and human dignity and gives all employees Sundays off. Chick-Fil-A is always closed on Sundays so that their employees can spend one day of the week with family and/or in practicing their faith. Perhaps this attitude with their upper management attracts like minded employees and that is why they have consistency among all of their restaurants nationwide that I have ever visited. I am just fine with them being closed one day per week if it contributes to their excellence all the other days of the week. Kudos to Chick-Fil-A and their employees for serving as a shining example of &quot;Be your best&quot; and &quot;do your very best&quot; as opposed to &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; and &quot;I don&apos;t get paid for that&quot;!

I&apos;ve always enjoyed Chick-Fil-A but this particular location is special for me. It&apos;s walking distance from my workplace, so I can count on at least enjoying lunch. The staff is also really, really nice. Other Chick-Fil-As I&apos;ve been to have just been the standard fast food joint. This one gives you a sort of waiter service. Their salads are excellent and their sandwiches are very satisfying.

Today I stopped in because I reserved one of their new spicy chicken sandwiches. My spicy chicken sandwich heart is typically held by Wendy&apos;s, but this one could definitely give it a run for its money.

The only reason I knock off a star is because I&apos;m not a huge fan of their breading and also I don&apos;t get why people talk about the chicken nuggets here. I&apos;ll admit it: I like McDonald&apos;s nuggets. You know why? Because FACT: a nugget is not a part of a chicken. I&apos;ll just eat a regular chicken breast, thank you.

When I have a choice of local Chick-Fil-A locations in the N/NW Austin area, I tend to choose this one.  Several reasons....

The tables, seating, rest rooms, windows, and play area are usually fairly clean, which tends to inspire confidence that they employ the same cleanliness practices in their kitchen.

The staff is good: accurate, polite, and do the &quot;my pleasure&quot; thing without fail.

They also have fresh brownies displayed on stands in front of the registers, so you&apos;re not paying for a stale brownie that has been hidden behind the counter and then brought to you (as some other local CFA locations have been wont to do lately).

They don&apos;t seem to come around to ask if you&apos;d like a drink refill much anymore, though.  But hey, the economy sucks and they&apos;re just trying to make an honest buck, so I can forgive them that.  I didn&apos;t really need that second Diet Dr. Pepper anyway.

All in all, a good bet if you&apos;re craving Chick-Fil-A food and are in the area.  I love Chick-Fil-A&apos;s salads, in particular.  Yum!
