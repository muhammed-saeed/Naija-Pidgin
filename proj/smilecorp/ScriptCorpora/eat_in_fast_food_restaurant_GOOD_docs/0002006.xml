Mystery Shoppers Needed
 (also known as Service Evaluators) 
     

 
From the desk of Karen Somers 
Last Update:

Welcome to Mystery Shopper Employment Agency,

Here you will find everything you ever wanted to know about mystery shopping and how to take your first baby steps to a fun, flexible and rewarding job. Are you ready to enjoy the perks of free merchandise, free meals, free services and get paid for it?

 

What Is Mystery Shopping?

Mystery shopping is a term used to describe a key tool that businesses around the world use to insure customer service standards are high within their places of business. Mystery shopping is sometimes referred to as secret shopping, virtual customers, performance auditing and spotters. It’s a 1.5 billion dollar industry and that number continues to grow.

Companies are willing to pay you hundreds of dollars for you to shop and dine at their establishments. Mystery shopping has become a staple in many industries. It is heavily used in retail, restaurant, online marketplaces, fitness centers, doctor&apos;s offices, apartment complexes and many other industries.

 

You may be asking yourself, why on Earth would a
company 
 want to pay me to go shop at their store?

Simply because businesses need to insure their customer service standards are high so that their customer base and sales continually grows. It’s a way to insure their employees and managers are performing at their optimum level, following company policies and guidelines, to insure customer service is excellent and to continually improve their level of customer care.

Business owners pay a substantial amount of money to mystery shoppers to plan anonymous visits posing as regular customers to their stores. They interact with the employees of the location, make a purchase, and evaluate their experience. The company receives a report, written by the mystery shopper that details their experience. They use this as feedback to make changes, to reward or further train employees and to help them make better, consumer focused decisions in their business.

 What they want from you is your input and opinions of the overall shopping experience you had in their store and what you thought of their products and services. Basically they want you to rate their customer service and give your honest feedback of what you liked and disliked about your shopping experience at their location. Your feedback is very important to these businesses because the better they can tailor a positive experience to fit the customer&apos;s needs and expectations, the more profitable their organizations will be.

 

What Mystery Shopping Can Do For You

Whether you are:

 looking to replace your current job and income or happy with your current job but would like a 2nd pay check to add some extra cash or, simply looking to enjoy the perks of free merchandise, free services , free trips and have your dining out paid for, 

you can accomplish all of the above as a mystery shopper in whatever capacity that best suits you. You choose whether you want to be full or part time, you choose what assignments you want to take on and which ones you don’t want. You have total flexibility, go at your own pace, get paid well for your time for doing something you love to do, shop, dine and travel.

 

What You Can Expect As A Mystery Shopper

You may be asked to browse a particular store as if you were a real customer interested in a particular product in their store. The employees or managers of the store you are evaluating should never know that you are a mystery shopper, you want to go about your business of shopping like you were a real customer. You would anonymously evaluate the way you were approached by sales personnel, the way they handled the sale, whether they asked if you wanted the extended warranty, overall store appearance etc

At the end of your visit, all you have to do is fill in a quick questionnaire and relate your shopping experience in their store. Send in your report and get paid. It’s that simple.

 The kind of questions companies ask :

 Were you greeted by sale personnel? Did you have to wait long for help? Was the store kept clean How well were you treated? Was your overall experience a positive one? Was the sales personnel informative or did they lack product knowledge? Did you encounter any problems, if so what? What else could we do to make your visit a pleasant one? 


 
 Your mystery shopping job assignments may have you experience 
 You may be asked to shop at 
 dining at a restaurant watching a movie at a theatre renting video, dvds or video games from a video rental shop relaxing message or facial at a spa or Health club renting a vehicle at a car rental test driving a vehicle at a car dealership Hair cuts or hair styled at hair salons booking a flight at a travel agency golfing at a golf&amp;country club getting an oil change 
 
 department stores grocery stores book stores shoe stores health&amp;fitness stores electronic shops wine stores travel&amp;tourism shops music store 
 

 

The Demand for Mystery Shoppers is Growing Exponentially

With more and more competition in the market place, companies are spending big bucks to stay on top of their competition. Those that don’t are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue because they are losing customer base and overall sales due to poor customer service or poor management. That’s why there is an ever-growing demand for mystery shoppers. All the name brand companies you will easily recognize all use mystery shoppers on a regular basis to evaluate how their stores are run and to keep their eyes on their employees&amp;managers.

 

Mystery Shopping - Nothing Quite Like It

 Flexibility / Flexible Work Hours :- You can work part or full time. You decide which days and the hours you want to work. You get to pick and choose only the“job assignments”you want to take. You have total control of how much time you want to put into this because you are the boss. 
 No Special Skill or Knowledge Required :- You don’t need specialized skills. Whether you graduated high school, college or have a University degree doesn’t matter. As long as you are over 18 years of age and you can read and write, answer simple questions relating to your shopping experiences, you can be a mystery shopper.
Whether you are male or female, big or small, regardless of your race or ethnic background you all have equal opportunity. Mystery shoppers are never discriminated based on sex, size, race or education.
 Work Anywhere in America :- Regardless of where you live, as long as you are over 18 years of age, you can work anywhere in America as a mystery shopper. Even if you were to move to a new state, you can still stay busy working as a mystery shopper. When you are planning a vacation trip to a new city or state, you can plan a few mystery shopping assignments on your vacation trip and enjoy the perks of free meals, free merchandise, maybe even free accommodations and get paid to do it. As so many hotels, car rental companies, boat cruises and airlines constantly use mystery shoppers, you have unlimited opportunities to take full advantage when planning your family vacation trips. Your Spouse, Friend OR Your Kids Can Tag Along :- You have the freedom to have your spouse or your kids tag along on your assignments. This means for stay at home mothers, fathers or single parents, you now can take your kids with you to work, you don’t have to look for a baby sitter or worse, pay for a baby sitter while you are on assignment. If you are dining at a restaurant, you may want to have your spouse or friend join you so that you don’t have to dine alone, you get to truly enjoy your mystery shopping experience. There are many assignments that are ideal to take your whole family with you such as mystery shopping assignments associated with fast food chains, movie theatres, restaurants, amusements parks, resorts and the like. Free Merchandise&amp;Services :- And the #1 reason most mystery shoppers love this industry is all the free stuff they get to keep. On many of the mystery shopping assignments, you will be asked to purchase a specific product or service as part of your assignment. You will be given the money ahead of time to purchase the product or service, or be asked to pay for it yourself which you will later be reimbursed when you send in your receipt with your shopper assignment report. 

What that means is not only do you get paid for mystery shopping but you also get to keep the merchandise. You can expect all kinds of unique and diverse products from free meals from restaurants to goods from clothing shops, shoe stores, toy stores, electronic stores, groceries and many more. This also applies to free services you will enjoy for free on your assignments such as watching movies, free hair cuts, free massage at a spa and so on. The assignments are so different from each other, it like an new adventure every time you go out mystery shopping, never a dull day at work. Everyday you look forward to new free services&amp;merchandise, it’s like it’s Christmas day Everyday.

 

How Much $$$ Can I Make As A Mystery Shopper?

Mystery Shoppers who have been at it a while plan 2 to 3 assignments in a day eg. Imagine starting your day at 12 noon, you mystery shop at a fast food restaurant, after your lunch you head to a department store like the GAP and purchase a pair of jeans for yourself or your kid, then head to Chili&apos;s later on in the afternoon for your final assignment where you fill your belly with another meal. And you get paid by each of the places not only for the items you purchased but also for your mystery shopping service (your assignment reports relating your shopping experiences).

On average, a good mystery shopper can realistically make a good part time income, not to mention all the free merchandise and services you get to enjoy with that pay check.

A full time professional mystery shopper can expect to make a good full time income plus all the free merchandise and services to enjoy with that pay check.

There are exceptional mystery shoppers who make substantially more than the average mystery shopper, for example here is an exceptional woman who makes nearly $7000 in one month as a mystery shopper, her story appeared in the Wall Street Journal. Here is an excerpt of the article:

 The Wall Street Journal How to Live Large, and Largely For Free 
By Robert Frank
From The Wall Street Journal Online

STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- On the breezy patio of the Silver Lake Golf Course here, Jennifer Voitle was hard at work.&quot;Cheers,&quot;she said, hoisting a frosty Corona with lime. Tanned and relaxed after playing a few holes, she finished up the beer and ate a cheeseburger. The golf and burgers were all part of the job, as were the strict instructions from her boss to&quot;consume at least one alcoholic beverage.&quot;Her morning jobs were equally trying. She went dress shopping, stopped into a bank to cash a check and visited a Saturn dealership to look at new cars. After golf, she was headed to Manhattan for dinner at a nice Italian restaurant. All these activities were paid jobs. Her total earnings for the day: about $300.&quot;Can you believe they call this work?&quot;she said.

Jennifer Voitle has mastered the Freebie Economy. A former investment-bank employee who was laid off two years ago, Ms. Voitle has found a new career in the arcane world of dining deals, gift certificates and&quot;mystery shopping,&quot;where companies pay her to test their products and services. She gets paid to shop, eat at restaurants, drink at bars, travel and even play golf. Last month, she made nearly $7,000 from her various freebie adventures. By the end of the year, she could be making more than she did in investment banking, not counting her steady supply of handouts.

She gets free gas, free groceries and free clothes. When her car breaks down, she gets paid to have it repaired. She can make $75 for test-driving a Land Rover, $20 for drinking at a bar and $25 for playing arcade games (she keeps any winnings). Golfing is her latest passion, and in addition to playing on courses around the country free of charge, she gets free food and drinks and gifts from the pro shop.

Weekend trips to Hawaii and Mexico?&quot;I don&apos;t pay for anything except occasional meals,&quot;she says. She does much of her work on a free hand-held computer.&quot;My friends tell me I should just get a job,&quot;says Ms. Voitle, who is slim and blond and gives her age as&quot;somewhere over 30.&quot;But, she says,&quot;most full-time jobs out there don&apos;t make economic sense.&quot;Number-Cruncher

Ms. Voitle never planned on becoming a freeloader. A trained engineer and financial expert, with four advanced degrees and a gift for numbers theory, Ms. Voitle worked for years as a number-cruncher for Detroit&apos;s auto factories. Her real dream was to make it big on Wall Street. In 2000, she got her break when Lazard LLC, the storied investment bank, hired her to analyze fixed-income derivatives in the firm&apos;s asset-management business.

Single, with a salary of more than $100,000, Ms. Voitle bought a house in leafy Baldwin, N.Y., complete with a pool and gym. She spent weekends golfing, traveling or playing with her cats -- Continental and Northwest. In the fall of 2001, she was laid off. With thousands of other investment-bank workers losing their jobs, Ms. Voitle couldn&apos;t find any financial work. Last summer, her unemployment checks ran out and both her electricity and phone were shut off.&quot;I woke up one morning and said,&quot;That&apos;s it. I have to start looking for money, wherever I can find it,&quot;she says.

Trolling the Internet, she discovered an ad for mystery shopping.&quot;I thought, &apos;this looks too good to be true,&apos;&quot;she says. Mystery shoppers get paid to sample a company&apos;s service or products and write a report on their experience. For companies, mystery shopping is popular way of checking on quality. For Ms. Voitle, it was a quick source of cash and freebies.

Her first assignment was a Pathmark grocery store, where she received free groceries and $10 for a quick report. She worked her way up to gas stations, clothing stores and restaurants. She quickly discovered that the best-paying mystery shopping jobs were for upscale businesses like banks and high-end car dealers. She earns $75 for test-driving a Land Rover, compared with about $30 for a Ford.

Volume is critical. On any given day, she will mystery shop gas stations, grocery stores, golf courses, clothing stores, casinos, hotels, insurance companies and restaurants. She even gets paid to shop for apartments and interview for jobs. She can make as much as $50 for applying for a job at a major company, and reporting back on the performance of the people who do the hiring. The only catch: If she&apos;s offered a job, she has to turn it down.&quot;For someone who&apos;s unemployed, I get a lot of job offers,&quot;she says.&quot;A golf course in Hawaii?&quot;she says to a recent caller.&quot;I think I can do that.&quot;Beyond mystery shopping, Ms. Voitle also collects gift certificates, travel deals, two-for-one coupons and cross-promotional deals. She does detailed cost-benefit analyses of most of her deals. She&apos;s always on the lookout for what she calls&quot;freebie synergies,&quot;or combining multiple deals to get more value. Before she sets out each morning, she plans a detailed travel route to make sure she hits the greatest possible number of stores.

On a recent morning in Long Island City, she mystery shopped a bank and earned a quick $15 for visiting the teller and trying to cash a check. She spotted a Saturn dealership across the street and got a $50 gift certificate to Target for test-driving a car -- another cross-promotion. Pulling out of the car dealership, she saw a bridal shop and made another $15 for trying on dresses for half an hour.

Ms. Voitle does have a few real jobs -- but they also include multiple freebies. She stocks grocery-store shelves for consumer companies, getting as much as $13 an hour in salary and $100 a day in travel expenses, which she can use to subsidize her mystery shopping. On Sundays, she sells printers at a computer store, where she can buy technical books for $1 and sell them on the Internet for $50. She can write off her cellphone bills because she provides preparatory phone interviews for people looking to find work on Wall Street.&quot;I couldn&apos;t believe there were all these opportunities out there,&quot;says Gordon Stewart, a friend of Ms. Voitle&apos;s who works in finance.&quot;She&apos;s discovered this whole other economy.&quot;Ms. Voitle says her ultimate goal is to return to Wall Street or get a job at a large financial institution. If that fails, she&apos;s considering writing a book or holding seminars on living for free. 

We can’t guarantee what you are going to make as a mystery shopper, it all depends on you, how much time you want to devote to it, do you want to do it part time or fulltime, passively or do you want to go out and aggressively mystery shop till you drop. The sky is the limit, you determine how big you want your pay check to be.
