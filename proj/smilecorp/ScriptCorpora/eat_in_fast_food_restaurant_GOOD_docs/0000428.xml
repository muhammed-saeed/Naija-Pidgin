 Electrical Hazards 
 Potential Hazard 
 Workers in restaurants are exposed to shocks and electrical 
hazards from: 
 Worn electric cords or improperly used or damaged extension cords Improperly wired or ungrounded outlets Faulty equipment and wiring Damaged receptacles and connectors Wet clean-up processes Unsafe work practices 
 
 Possible Solutions 
  

 
 Employer Solutions 
 Employers have the primary 
 responsibility for protecting the safety and health of their 
 workers. Employees are responsible for following the safe work 
 practices of their employers.  

 Consider implementing recommended safe work practices,
 including those discussed here. 
 
 Outlet with GFCI

 
Improper Use of Extention and Flexible Cords. Improperly wired and potentially dangerous use of extension cords - no GCFI According to the National Institute for
 Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) most electrical hazards can be eliminated 
 through safeguards and safe work practices such as: 
 Use ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) of the breaker or 
 receptacle type be installed in situations where electricity and 
 wetness coexist. GFCIs will interrupt the electrical circuit 
 before current sufficient to cause death or serious injury has 
 passed through a body. GFCIs are inexpensive ($50-$85 for 
 breaker type, $25-$45 for receptacle type) and a qualified 
 electrician can install them in existing electrical circuits 
 with relative ease.

 Employers should use ground-fault circuit interrupters (GCFIs) on all 120-volt, single-phase, and 15- and 20-ampere receptacles. 

 Wear and tear on electrical equipment or tools can result in 
 insulation breaks, short-circuits, and exposed wires. If there is 
 no ground-fault protection, these can cause a ground-fault that sends current through the worker&apos;s 
 body, resulting in electrical burns, explosions, fire, or death.
 The GFCI is a 
 fast-acting circuit breaker designed to shut off electric power 
 in the event of a ground-fault and prevent injury to the worker.
 
 Ensure that exposed receptacle boxes be made of nonconductive material 
 so that contact with the box will not constitute a&quot;ground.&quot;

 Use plugs and receptacles designed to prevent energization 
 until insertion is complete.

 Ensure that all circuit breaker or fuse boxes bear a label for each 
 circuit breaker or fuse that clearly identifies its 
 corresponding outlets and fixtures. Also, breaker switches 
 should not be used for on-off switches.

 Inform all workers, when hired, of electrical hazards 
 and of safe work practices by which to avoid these hazards. 
 Workers should be informed that, in the event of an electrical 
 injury, no contact should be made with the victim or the 
 electrical apparatus causing the injury until the current has 
 been shut off.

 Encourage workers in restaurants to train in CPR.
 
 Follow OSHA Standards including: 

 
Damaged Cord. Damaged cords should not be used 

 
 Extension Cord with 3-Prong. Use grounded plug with properly grounded outlet 1910 Subpart S - Electrical some highlights include: 
 Electrical equipment shall be free from recognized hazards 
 [ 1910.303(b)(1) ].

 Listed or labeled equipment shall be used or installed in 
 accordance with any instructions included in the listing or 
 labeling [ 1910.303(b)(2) ].

 Sufficient access and working space shall be provided and 
 maintained around all electric equipment to permit ready and 
 safe operation and maintenance of such equipment [ 1910.303(g)(1) ].

 Ensure that all electrical service near sources of water is 
 properly grounded [ 1910.304(g)(6)(vi) ].

 Tag out and remove from service all damaged receptacles and 
 portable electrical equipment [ 1910.334(a)(2)(ii) ].

 Repair all damaged receptacles and portable electrical 
 equipment before placing them back into service [ 1910.334(a)(2)(ii) ].

 Ensure that employees are trained not to plug or unplug 
 energized equipment when their hands are wet [ 1910.334(a)(5)(i) ].
