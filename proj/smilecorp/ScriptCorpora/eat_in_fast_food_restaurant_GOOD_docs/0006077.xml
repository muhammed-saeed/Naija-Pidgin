 By Jennifer Appenrodt for YouBeauty.com 

Marketers get paid a lot of money to get you to eat unhealthy food. And they’re really good at their jobs.

There’s the Lay’s commercial with joyous young people munching on crispy potato chips that played during the morning news, the billboard of the buff athlete offering you a refreshing sip of Gatorade that you drove past on your way to work and the magazine ad of a healthy, happy family sitting down to share a meal of Stouffer’s lasagna that you flipped by while waiting for your doctor’s appointment.

It’s no surprise that we’re exposed to nearly 3,000 marketing messages daily. And even though we’re all too familiar with the art of being sold something -- people try to sell us their products, we take that information for what it’s worth and then we make an informed decision -- the “sell” isn’t always so blatantly obvious. If you think you’re picking up everything those clever marketers are putting down, think again: Research shows that the images and associations these ads form within our minds eye are much more powerful than we realize.

 What’s the Deal? 
“Any advertiser will tell you that successful marketing appeals to emotions and slips below the radar of critical thinking,” says Marion Nestle, Ph.D., the author of the groundbreaking book, “ Food Politics .” “We are not supposed to notice advertising and we don’t -- unless we deliberately set out to look for it.”

Marketers want you to automatically associate their brand with feeling good. They do this by linking their brand to basic human motivations -- like accomplishment, belonging, self-fulfillment -- to boost product sales.

 More from YouBeauty.com: 
 
 More Dirty Secrets of the Psychology of Food Advertising 
 QUIZ: What’s Your Eating Style? 
 Should There Be a Diet Soda Tax? 

What’s more, marketing has the power to create a positive image of a brand -- even if that image is false. Take for example Subway, which promotes itself as a &quot;healthy alternative to greasy fast food.&quot; Studies by Brian Wansink, Ph.D., director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, show that consumers eating at a fast food restaurant perceived as &quot;healthy,” like Subway, were more likely to underestimate their calorie intake by an average of 151 calories than if the consumers were eating at a fast–food restaurant perceived as &quot;unhealthy,” like McDonald&apos;s.

Also, research has shown that people are more likely to indulge in sides, drinks and desserts if their entrée was perceived to be healthier (like a sandwich from Subway) than if their entrée was less healthy (like a Big Mac from McDonald&apos;s). And those additional drinks, sides and desserts added up to 131 percent more calories consumed. “It’s a ‘health halo,’ where we assume everything on the menu at a restaurant is good for us,” says Wansink. “If people eating at Subway think they’ve earned some kind of calorie credit, it can lead to substantial weight gain.”

Another example of the “health halo” is Vitamin Water. Many people view it as a healthy alternative to soda -- the very name suggesting the product is simply water with added nutrients. “It’s great marketing, but it&apos;s really just sugar water,” says Jennifer Harris, Director of Marketing Initiatives at Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy&amp;Obesity. “People don’t realize it and think it’s better than drinking water when, in reality, there’s no evidence that people actually even need any of the vitamin additives.” When a non-profit public interest group sued the company on the grounds of making unwarranted health claims, they defended themselves by stating &quot;no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking Vitamin Water was a healthy beverage.&quot;

The irony of this statement has not been lost on the public. Many are outraged that a company that’s invested billions of dollars in heavily and aggressively promoting their product as a healthy choice -- paying basketball stars to appear in ads that convey the beverage as a healthy way to hydrate -- could turn around and essentially call their consumers stupid for believing Vitamin Water is a healthy choice.

 How to Help Yourself 
So can you actually protect yourself against these powerful marketing messages, especially ones that reach us on a subconscious level?

Yes, but it’s no easy task. Harris points out that more research is needed to examine the psychological aspect of food marketing to identify public policy that will effectively protect from harmful influence. In the meantime, simply being aware of the influence that ads have on us and flexing our skepticism muscle, rather than mindlessly absorbing the information marketers are shelling out, can help people make better food choices.

Or try Nestle’s tactic: “Turn off the TV. Pay attention. And don’t have junk food in the house.&quot;

 Douglas McNish: How to Eat Cleaner, Healthier and Ethically 

 It is our duty as smart, informed shoppers to choose wisely and not be fooled. There are many simple things we can do to take back our health and make sure to not be duped into marketing propaganda from large corporations wanting to take our money. Remember, we vote with our dollars, so make every vote count. 
 
 Neil Seeman: Fat Tax Won&apos;t Cut Government Bloat 

 Provinces that propose to tax sugary beverages may increase their general revenues; but as a strategy to reduce the severe chronic illness and huge financial costs associated with obesity, it will fail to accomplish anything -- except expanding the power of bureaucrats. 
 
 Larry_Cohen: We&apos;re Not Buying It : Stop Junk Food Marketing to Kids 

 Parents simply can&apos;t compete with the $2 billion a year spent on kids ads promoting foods that are laden in sugar, salt and fat. We need someone to hold food and beverage companies accountable.

Can&apos;t even use box dessert mixes, they&apos;re so unbearably sweet. So baking from scratch. Since I&apos;m too lazy to do that more than a few times a year, we cut way down on the sweets. People have eaten like this for centuries and had fewer chronic health problems than we have today. edejan: After years of dealing with food myths, I&apos;ve found the http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/edejan/tricked-to-eat-junk-food_n_970123_114609812.html History  | Permalink  | Share it This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

 drramsey Your Partner In Health 392 Fans   04:58 PM on 09/26/2011 Great article. This reminds me of when my youngest son who has often asked for a specific food being advertised. My first response is “no honey, that is not good for you”. His retort is “uh huh! The commercial said so!” This brings me to another very innocent comment he made regarding advertising. We were away at a cabin and they don’t have TiVo there. He was drawing at the table, not even paying attention to the TV. He looked up and said, “Hey Mom, do you have your own commercial?” (I’m an weekly physician/educator on a local TV station in Arizona). I told him I didn’t. He said, “Well not everybody has the fast forward button”. This speaks volumes to the attention even little ones give to television.

Whoever wrote that hasn&apos;t watched TELEVISION lately.

I haven&apos;t had television in my house in a good five years and don&apos;t miss it, but every time I go to my best friend&apos;s house she has the television on, and the instant the commercial starts it is unmistakable that they don&apos;t just want your attention, they are demanding it with the volume.

LOL Even the reports on advertising are lying to us. It&apos;s pretty sad when you not only can&apos;t believe everything you read in the papers, you can&apos;t believe what you hear on television OR on the internet.

 HerrMonk Son of Apollo 220 Fans 11:34 AM on 09/20/2011 Why does the author think a sandwich from Subway is healthier than a McDonalds burger?

Sort of funny to write about consumers being &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking unhealthy stuff is healthy, then go on to regurgitate a Subway marketing point... HerrMonk: Why does the author think a sandwich from Subway is http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/HerrMonk/tricked-to-eat-junk-food_n_970123_108838470.html History  | Permalink  | Share it BamaRainbow 105 Fans 04:51 PM on 09/21/2011 Well, considering the fact that the McDonalds burger veggie options are likely limited to pickles, tomatoes and lettuce whereas Subway offers those plus spinach, peppers (bell, banana and jalapeno), cucumber slices and black olives, I&apos;d say the Sub offers a better chance at being healthy. (Also, McDonalds usually cooks their onions--which are more likely to be diced-while Subway offers raw onions.)

Now, I&apos;ll grant you that you can&apos;t force the consumers to actually pick the healthier options at Subway but baked ham and roast turkey beat out a fried burger in terms of healthy choices. (I don&apos;t recall the last time that McDonalds offered baked ham or roast turkey for their sandwich choices.) BamaRainbow: Well, considering the fact that the McDonalds burger veggie options http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/BamaRainbow/tricked-to-eat-junk-food_n_970123_109088373.html History  | Permalink  | Share it HerrMonk Son of Apollo 220 Fans 05:52 PM on 09/21/2011 Both places have salads, which is probably as good as you&apos;re going to get at either.

Subway mostly gives you a lot of bread. Most of McDonalds stuff is about 1/3 fat, 1/3 protein 1/3 carbs. Most of Subway&apos;s stuff is about 50%+ carb, 25% or less protein/fat.

Given the sources we can pretty much discount them both as good micro-nutrient sources. From a macro-nutrient perspective, I&apos;d go with McDonalds. Not to mention that I&apos;m going to be a lot more full from a Big Mac (540 calories) than than a foot long spicy Italian (1040 calories).

At the end of the day, it&apos;s all junk. But Subway really plays on people&apos;s &quot;fat is the devil&quot; and &quot;light and fluffy things don&apos;t make you fat&quot; assumptions.
