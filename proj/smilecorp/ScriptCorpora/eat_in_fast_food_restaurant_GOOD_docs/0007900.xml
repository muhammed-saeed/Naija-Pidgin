Public Storage complaint–the corrupt manager of this self storage place had my storage unit auctioned off unjustly!
 By startrekky 
I stored some stuff at this local Public storage facility here in Atlanta and got screwed over big time by the manager.
 




We had sold our house and thusly had to place some of our things in storage for a little while until we found the right new house to move into. We didn’t know that when we put up our house for sale that it was going to sell so quickly. But we were advised by friends and family to take that offer quickly because it was quite high and this is a very bad economy for selling a house in.

So we sold our house and we still haven’t found a new one that fit our needs at the right price to move into. Meanwhile we had our stuff placed in storage at the nearby Public Storage self storage place at 2080 Briarcliff Road Ne Atlanta, GA 30329. We made every payment like we were supposed to to the Public Storage place.

The manager there was an asshole and very rude–I might add. They had no personality whatsoever and were always moaning and complaining about unpaid storage units. I never thought for a moment that I would have a problem with this person and that they would ever bother trying to auction off my unit because I was a good paying customer.

But I was wrong. After about 4 months of having paid my storage rental I went to get a few items that we needed out of storage and found that the lock had been replaced on my storage unit. So I went to the manager and asked what was going on. They didn’t remember so they had to look it up on their computer. Then they told me that I have been late with my payments by three months and that my storage unit was seized and sold at auction.

This got me really mad and I explained to the person that I had made all my payments and had proof that they had cashed these checks. They said that there was nothing in their computer showing any of my payments. I left telling them that they were going to pay me full retail replacement value for everything they illegally sold on me. They told me to go to hell.

I went home and on my computer I pulled up the cash receipts and canceled check pictures from my bank that prove beyond any doubt that I made every single one of those payments in that they accepted and cashed my payments at this Public Storage. I printed up all of these receipts and then went back to the Public Storage facility.

 Headlight restoration and cleaning 101! 

 When I showed the manager my receipts they tried to tell me that they were forged and that they didn’t want anything to do with forgers and fraud. I am now in the process of finding an attorney to sue them. That building is going to have my name on it when I am done with this moron that runs that Public Storage self storage facility on Briarcliff Road here in Atlanta.

Warning to everyone in Atlanta! Do not use that self storage center unless you want to lose your stuff like I did. The manager is an inept moron and liar. Avoid this Public Storage center.
