NAPKIN FOLDING: The Basic Silverware Pouch

Beauty and utility combine, as you create these two simple napkin pouches. Each of these two designs offers a traditional and tidy look on your dining table. This folded napkin design is also ideal for a buffet. As host or hostess, you can offer an entire place setting of silverware in a neat package for your guests to pick up quickly, as they proceed through your serving line.
 
THE SQUARE POUCH

Lay a fabric napkin flat, decorative side down, on a counter or table.

Fold the napkin in half, left to right, so that the fold runs up and down on your left side and the selvages (edges) are on your right.

Fold the bottom edge upwards about 3&quot; to 4&quot; (depending on the size of your napkin).

Fold it up again 3&apos; to 4&quot; to form a pocket across the front.

Turn the left- and right-hand edges under, tucking one into the other to secure them together. It&apos;s as simple as that!

THE TRIANGLE POUCH

Lay a fabric napkin flat, decorative side down, on a counter or table.

Fold the napkin, bottom towards the top, placing the lower edge 2/3 from the top. Crease along the new bottom edge.

Fold the top 1/3 down over this section. Crease along the new top edge.

Fold lengthwise, left to right, to locate the centerline. Open out again.

Fold the left end down, along the centerline, and crease. Repeat this with the right end as well. The left and right edges will meet at the centerline, forming a little log cabin shape.

Carefully flip the entire napkin over, being careful not to unfold any of your work. Place the point facing away from you.

The top triangle will leave a small strip of surplus fabric along the bottom. Fold this up over the bottom of the triangle area. At this point, your napkin will look like a little pirate hat. (If you are having a pirate themed party, you may wish to stop at this point.)

Fold the left and right corners toward the middle. Tuck the edges of one into the other to fasten them. That&apos;s it!

DISPLAYING YOUR SILVERWARE POUCH

Place the entire folded package on your dining table or buffet. Stick a place setting of silverware, a fresh or silk flower, a candy cane, a sprig of spruce or holly, a place card or another appropriate party favor into the pocket.

Your table will look festive and formal!



NOTE: Generally, napkins made of stiffer fabrics form the neatest folds. Brand-new napkins always look sharp. Laundered ones should be ironed and starched for the best effect. (High-quality paper napkins may also be used, once you master the technique, but cloth ones really work the best.)
