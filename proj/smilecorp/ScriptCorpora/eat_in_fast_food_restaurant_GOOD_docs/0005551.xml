Taco Bueno
 Taco Bueno is a U.S. -based fast-food restaurant chain specializing in Tex-Mex -style Mexican cuisine . Currently headquartered in Farmers Branch, Texas , the first location was in Abilene, Texas in 1967 . The company has locations in Arkansas , Kansas , Missouri , Nebraska , New Mexico , North and South Carolina , Oklahoma , and Texas , and Louisiana with concentrations in North Texas and Oklahoma. The chain currently includes 169 restaurants, including recent additions in Kansas City, Missouri ; Monroe, North Carolina ; Rock Hill, South Carolina ; Conroe, Texas ; Alexandria, Louisiana ; and Harker Heights, Texas . Contracts for 2008 include more stores in Indiana and Louisville, Kentucky . However, the Monroe and Rock Hill locations have closed.
Taco Bueno was started by Bill Waugh, an Abilene Christan University art graduate.
In 1981 Taco Bueno was acquired by British food manufacturer Unigate , then was sold to Carl&apos;s Jr. &apos;s franchisor CKE Restaurants in 1996 . The private investment group Jacobson Partners purchased the chain in 2001 , and in 2005 Palladium Equity Partners procured the company.
The chain differentiates itself from competitors such as Taco Bell by promoting the fresh ingredients used in many of their menu items. This is emphasized by television and radio ad campaigns that focus on employees of an unnamed Mexican fast-food chain spying on Taco Bueno to determine why Bueno&apos;s food tastes superior.
New additions
In the South, steak products, as well as a new menu is being test-marketed before introducing it in other areas. Cilantro lime rice, peppered chicken, and the cinnamon apple muchaco will be released, but the cinnamon apple muchaco will be sold as a seasonal item. Strawberry smoothies are sold at some locations, bean tacos (consisting of beans and cheese) are sold at Taco Bueno, and taquitos are sold as seasonal/promotional items.
Signature Taco Bueno Menu Items

Big Ol&apos; Burrito
As the name implies, it is a large burrito offered by Taco Bueno and is available in beef and chicken varieties. The Beef BOB contains beef, chili sauce, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and sour cream; the Chicken BOB has chicken, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and sour cream.
MexiDips&amp;Chips
The MexiDips&amp;Chips is a bed of tortilla chips with two fried corn tortilla bowls . The two bowls are filled differently depending on if the item is for take-out or dine-in orders. In the case that it is made for dine-in, one bowl contains queso , one holds refried pinto beans , and a scoop of fresh guacamole is served atop a small patch of lettuce. If the order is for take-out, then the guacamole is put in one of the tortilla bowls and the cheese is put in a separate plastic container with a lid to prevent spillage.
Muchaco
The Muchaco is a layer of refried beans, ground beef or grilled chicken , lettuce , shredded cheddar cheese , diced tomatoes , and folded over in soft pita bread.
Potato Burrito
Taco Bueno&apos;s Potato Burrito consists of the customer&apos;s choice of ground beef or grilled chicken, hash brown potatoes, queso, shredded lettuce, and sour cream wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. As with most of the chain&apos;s menu items, refried beans may be substituted for meat at no additional charge.
Mucho Nachos
 Mucho Nachos is a bed of corn tortilla chips topped with refried beans, ground beef or grilled chicken, chili sauce , queso with peppers, diced tomatoes, and sour cream. As of December 2007, the company decided to remove the 1/2 oz. of shredded cheese due to the fact that the 4 oz. of queso made virtually no difference in taste.
Nacho Salad
 Nacho Salad is a salad concoction that comes with the customers choice of beef or chicken.It is topped off with chili sauce and queso,lettuce,tomatoes and shredded cheese.
Cheesecake Chimichanga
A Cheesecake Chimichanga is a warm cheesecake filling wrapped in a fried shell and dusted with powdered sugar .
Chimichanga
Not to be confused with the cheesecake chimichanga, the regular chimichanga features chicken, rice , black beans , pepperjack cheese, and chunky salsa. It is wrapped in a 10&quot; tortilla, fried, then topped with sour cream sauce, queso, and chipotle sauce.
Salsa Bar
All Taco Bueno locations have a self serve salsa and condiment bar featuring homemade fresh red and chunky salsas, fresh pico de gallo , diced onions, jalapeño peppers, lemon slices, and depending on the location other various items such as cilantro .
Breakfast Menu
In 2007, Taco Bueno introduced a line of breakfast items, including egg-based burritos and breakfast platters, at the majority of their locations. New egg tacos are also sold.
