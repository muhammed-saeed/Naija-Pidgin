Great views of the ocean,  and food is of good quality.  This is a regular spot for family gatherings. They are accommodating to large groups with kids and babies. They take reservations which makes this much more convenient for parties.
However, I think the food is good,  not great.  The salad bar is ok.the service is good.  I prefer the food and service of cheesecake factory.

I will still come a few times a year for the family gatherings,  but don&apos;t see myself going here outside of those events.

Even though the location is great with views of hermosa beach, there are down sides to this place:
- valet parking was unnecessary since the guy just parked the car 5 ft from me
- reservations are pointless since we had one and they still did not sit us in front of a window for our anniversary dinner
- waitress had no clue what the menu even was... did not tell us about the specials, had no idea what drink names were, and even told the table next to us that she has never tried the cold gaspacho soup... she talked so badly about it that of course they did not order it.

Food was OK, hence the 2 stars, but otherwise we&apos;ll pass.

Bottom line:
we will not come back here

Couldn&apos;t even tell you how the food was because we were never seated!!  People told me not to come here for my friends birthday, but I wanted to because of the location and I didn&apos;t want to drive to the one in Newport Beach.

Traffic was bad so we arrived exactly 15 minutes after the reservation was scheduled.  When she finally acknowledged us, it was barely 20 minutes after our reservation time.  Because she didn&apos;t get to us in time, she said she gave away our table because check in time according to her watch was when she was able to wait on us (we checked in with her side kick right at the wire, but she was spineless and wouldn&apos;t say a word to the nazi reservation girl).

Needless to say, her attitude and the way she spoke to me was a total deal killer.  I wish I had her name so I could let everyone know how poor her customer service is.  I will NEVER EVER go to this location ever again.  I should&apos;ve listened to everyone who told me not to go.

Bottom line is if she had treated us with respect, we would&apos;ve stayed and waited for the next table.  Someone needs to give this girl a lesson in customer service.  Two thumbs down to the chunky brunnette who works the front desk and a big &quot;boo&quot; for the chick who wouldn&apos;t tell her we checked in.

I have to say, the parking to this place probably saves it a couple of negatives in itself. Parking is really easy and right in its own parking structure. Which is good, cause when you&apos;re a few minutes late to a wedding, every step closer to the ceremony is a welcome thing.

So yeah, I came here for a wedding. Open bar - awesome. But the food was pretty much a one way ticket to tummy troubles. Which, if you haven&apos;t been paying attention, means that this wedding made me feel not so fresh later.

But hey, it was a wedding - by the sea - which should be on the bucket list of everyone for one of their marriages to start off that way. Waves crashing on the sand. In fact, that&apos;s probably the best thing about this establishment, the extreme closeness that it shares with the sand and ocean out in front of you.

If you&apos;re paying more money for anything, it&apos;s for the fact that you just got your shoes wet and you enjoyed what is one hell of a view from the glass windows -- But yeah, the food pretty much is a stinker.

As for the service, it was alright. Not really much to be expected. I think the view you get when you&apos;re here is top notch -- just wish the food was better, or for that matter wasn&apos;t pricey for what you&apos;re paying for -- the god damn view of the beach.

I will echo Boris S&apos;s sentiments about his Mother&apos;s Day dining experience at this Chart House location. I entered my comments on Landry&apos;s website as well.

The service last night was abominable at this Chart House.  We had a 6:00pm reservation with a party that included small children.  We were not seated until 7:45pm.  The management of this location did NOTHING for the customers waiting over an hour to be seated for their reservations, and they had a waiting area full.  The hostesses merely assured the customers that the restaurant was not taking &quot;walk ins&quot; that evening.  They also provided the convenient excuse that it was not their &quot;fault&quot; that we had almost a two hour wait.  Their reservation system never stopped taking reservations.  No one wants to hear that when they don&apos;t have bread or even a drink for their hungry, cranky children.

To add insult to injury, the hostess was rude when she finally did seat us.  When she gave the excuse again about the reservation system, my mother replied that typically management should check their reservations the week before a holiday  and see potential issues so the staff is prepared for any issues that may arise and possibly mitigate them ahead of time.  At no point did the hostess apologize.  In fact, after my mom&apos;s comment, she became confrontational back with my mom and then proceeded to glare at my mom as she passed by seating other customers!  It was unreal!  I felt like someone was going to jump out and say we were on an episode of &quot;What Would you Do!&quot;

Our server was good and empathetic in light of the circumstances, because as you would expect, the kitchen was backed up too.  Not only did we wait almost two hours for our table, but we waited 30 minutes for our main course once our order was placed.  Needless to say, there are seven people that won&apos;t be back at this location!  Happy Mother&apos;s Day!

Completely disappointed.  (Happy Mother&apos;s Day!)

To start:
We had 5:30pm reservations...   we are not seated until 5:50pm on a table that was empty at 5:20pm when we arrived.   We did not receive any bread and/or drinks until 6:20pm.   When you have a 2 year old with you, that is known as &quot;torture&quot;.

The waiter reminded me of a VERY PUSHY USED CAR SALESMAN.  He pushed this specific Red Wine on us 5 times, when we refused the recommendation...   he disappeared for 20 minutes.   He pushed a specific dish on us 4 times, and he made the table uncomfortable was not taking his recommendation.   He also tried to get us signed up on the &quot;frequent&quot; buyer club...  we needed to say &quot;no&quot; 5 times before he stopped pushing it on us.

When he did take our orders, he &quot;poked&quot; my mother on the should and stated, &quot;okay, we will start with you&quot;.  (unacceptable)

The $50.00 Alaska Crab Legs were not fresh...  about 1/2 of the meat was in them.  (I would highly recommend not ordering!)    They provide the necessary utensils about 5 minutes after receiving my meal.

The Fillet was substandard, and very expensive.

The empty plates kept on piling up on our table, so I was forced to placed 8+ of them on the floor to make room for other items.   The waiter got mad at me for doing this.  (Maybe he should have come by earlier and asked to take them after he refilled out water glasses and wine glasses?)

The Hot Lava cakes was a huge disappointment for $15.   The chocolate was suppose to flow out of the middle???  It didn&apos;t.   When I mentioned it to the waiter, he jokingly stated that everyone must have eaten before I had a chance to take a bite and completely minimized my complaint.

At $67 per person, this was the worst value for the money that I have experienced in 10+ years.

I remember when the Chart House was the Best of the Best.   What happened?

Great View, substandard food, and THE WORST service imaginable.

Save your money, eat at Denny&apos;s.   The food is better, the service is much better, and price is right.

my memory is a little rusty as my visit was about six months ago (dec 30) when i went on a first date. valet-parking only, so minus a point for not having an alternative to people who would rather park their own cars for fear of valet incompetence or embarrassment of having a sh*tty/messy car.

thankfully it was romantically lit (dim) so i didn&apos;t feel that self-conscious, but not dark enough that you would trip over yourself. the restaurant was not very crowded but we had to wait a few minutes before being seated, because our table was right by the window with an ocean view. we took this opportunity to have a glass of wine each by the bar.

it was nice to have the ocean view, unfortunately it was extremely foggy that night (marine layer?) so you could see the sand and a little bit of the ocean. it seemed like a perfect setting for a horror movie really. i like horror movies though, so i took it in stride.

the bread was just ok, not my favorite and not fantastic. we had the artichoke to start off. it was warm and garlicky - all the makings of a great first date appetizer. i&apos;m pretty sure i got the garlic (again!) panko sea bass which came with creamed spinach. the creamed spinach wasn&apos;t too heavy but wasn&apos;t particularly creamy either. i enjoyed it nonetheless. i really liked the sea bass, it was simply done, nothing fancy but delicious.

we shared a creme brulee which was pretty standard, perhaps it had a little strange flavor to it but i might be making this up (it&apos;s been a while).

our server was friendly and attentive, and made us feel right at home. no complaints there.

must have been a good first date despite the garlic-ness, since we&apos;re still dating.

I&apos;ve now had two below average experiences here.  I would definitely not recommend going to this restaurant.

The second to last time I went to Char House our soup arrived luke warm and the surf and turf with filet minion and lobster was not only lukewarm but the lobster was mushy.

The last time I went to Chart House, I thought I&apos;d give it another try for Mother&apos;s Day.  I made a reservation for 5:45 and when we arrived (at 5:45) the hostess told us that we probably would not be seated for at least 50 (fifty) minutes.  She said that they were &quot;busier than they expected&quot;.  She wasn&apos;t sympathetic, didn&apos;t apologize and honestly, seemed like she really didn&apos;t care at all.  I get that she was probably getting quite a few dissatisfied customers and that the fact that Chart House clearly overbooked wasn&apos;t her fault, but at least making it seem like you cared a little would have been nice.

At the end of the day, Chat House overbooked - by a lot.  To give you an idea, the parking lot was completely full to the point where people had to park at a separate location and there was a line of cars waiting just to get into the lot.  The waiting area inside the restaurant was completely full and the bar was packed at least two people deep.  I felt like I was at a club trying to fight for a drink.  But, according to the hostess, the restaurant didn&apos;t overbook, there were just a lot of tables taking &quot;longer than expected to eat dinner&quot;.  Come on, just tell the truth.

The bottom line is that there are so many other great places to spend your money (potentially less money) and get much better food and service.  Don&apos;t waste your time here.

Fresh fish and great dishes.  Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Would give 4 stars if the food was consistently great or always getting better.  Great to take out of town family or an impromptu night out with my love.

My family of 9 came here to celebrate my Mom and mother-in-law for Mother&apos;s Day. My husband made reservations at 12pm, but we waited 15 minutes before sitting down. I&apos;m not going to be too picky about the wait since it was Mother&apos;s Day and I knew that a lot of people were out celebrating.

When you make a turn onto their street, keep driving straight until you hit the parking garage. They offer valet parking for $3.50. I don&apos;t think they should be charging for parking since we are eating at the restaurant. Or maybe at least offer a discount if you&apos;re dining in the restaurant.

The restaurant is located at the border of Hermosa and Redondo Beach. You&apos;ve got the view of the beach wherever you sit. Where sat though, we also had a view of the sewage. Not the nicest thing to see while you&apos;re eating. Anyway, our waiter quickly asked us for our choice of drinks. My dad was really hungry and wanted something to munch on quickly, so I requested for their house bread. Our waiter must have been really busy because I had to ask twice for it.

To the food we go:
I ordered their clam chowder for my starter and their fresh Herb Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes for my main dish. I LOVE their clam chowder! It wasn&apos;t too creamy, too salty, or too fishy smelling. It came in this cute miniature hearth pot. And it went so well with their sourdough house bread! I almost couldn&apos;t eat my main dish because I devoured all of it! My brother said he had ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon before and raved about its sauce. I was so excited to try it that it was the first thing I tasted. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t have the same experience as he. The sauce was too salty for my taste. The salmon was a bit dry, so it would&apos;ve been nice to have something to moisten it :/

I would definitely come back here again for their clam chowder!

I was debating how many stars to rate this place... i mean if i put into consideration that i didnt pay the bill then maybe pushing my limits it wouldve gotten 2.5 stars, BUT ohh im reviewing this place based on the aspects of price+quality to be more realistic.

Valet parking only, 5 bucks + tip if youre feeling spendy.

It was a party of 5, reservations at 7pm, hoping for a table by the window to enjoy the sunset. Well table by the window didnt happen but close enougth.

The place was completely packed!! They took our drink orders rigth away, i had a glass of riesling (first of 4 to be precise) for round 6dll or 7dll each,  Ohhhoh wait i had a bloody mary first but it was just ok, not really spicy or well made, thats why i swiched to wine :)

First time i open the menu :O :O :O LOL im glad not spending a penny here, so basicly all main entrees are round 30 bucks each, i ordered the NY steak medium, no appetizer or anything else.

The other people at table had the salad bar and my friend ordered lobster bisque, he had to send it back cause it was cold! i actually tried it cause i thought he was just been a dick but i guarantee you it was cold!!!! the funny thing tho is that it comes in a neat looking metal bowl/serving thing covered with a lid that is suppouse to keep it hot! hehehehe, what a joke, i had to add also that flavour wasnt good, it was sweet.

Ok so they replaced the soup it was hot this time, he ate it but said it wasnt that good, all the other people said the salad bar was good, hmmm dunno i didnt go over n see the veggies to make a statement. By now place is getting louder and louder n service is getting slower and slower, took forever to get refills or the waitress attention for that matter.

Sunset was cool, i thought the keep the ligthing low so you can see the sunset better but it was like that all night long! it was too dark for my taste, but since i had a bottle of wine i guess i didnt make a huge deal out of it at that time.

My plate arrives n is this huge pretty piece of meat and a side of mashed potatoes. It was actually medium rare not medium like i ordered, hmmmm i ate the edges avoiding the red rare, i mean i was already half done with the steak i just didnt feel like sending it back and waiting again,mashed potatoes were just ok.

2 lava cakes for the table, wich was for me the best part of the meal! on the menu it says please allow 25 minutes for preparation, it indeed took around 15-20 minutes but it was worth it! it was this warm, moist right out of oven chocolate volcano with chocolate lava, top with vanilla icecream, mmmmm we almost lick the plate! hahahaah that is how good it was!

Took so long to get my last refill on wine, service sucks! imagine if i had send my steak back!!

It was around 350dll not including tip for 5 people; 5 entrees,1 soup, 3 salad bars, 2 lava cakes, 12 drinks or so, not bad if youre not paying! LOL, (the person who invited everyone likes the chart house so i guess it wasnt bad for him)

Two stars were given for: awesome views + lava cake!

*So that night i only ended up paying 10dll for two bottles of wine at raplhs after dinner, hahahahaha im so cheap :) not bad considering just my drinks at pricey house were 35 bucks.

I went here last Christmas eve with my fiancé and we both absolutely loved it I love beach side Restaurants, but this one has a definite class to it that one doesn&apos;t usually find directly on the water. I have also recommended this Restaurant to others who have also loved it. The waiter was great and despite their crazy day (being Christmas and all) I felt quite relaxed and at home. I would recommend this Restaurant to anyone who is looking for a nice romantic dinner out.

Im not sure why there are so many bad reviews. I just got done eating here with my girlfriend and it was a great experience. The food and the service was great. The ocean front view was amazing.  I will be back. O ya. To all the people complaining that you have to pay 3.50 for valet parking, if you think that paying for valet is unfair or too expensive then you should not be eating at chart house. Just saying

I went to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday, and I must say it met every one of my expectations!!!  Upon making a last minute reservation after going to another restaurant in Hermosa, I was pleasantly surprised of the level of service I received.

Minutes after being seated, we were greeted by our server &quot;Parker&quot; who began attending to our needs and explaining the menu choices by making recommendations.  From the appetizers to the main course EVERYthing was extremely tasteful and plentiful.  Even though the restaurant was a bit busy the wait time for our food was very minimal.

The only down side to my visit was, I wasn&apos;t able to sit near the window area (with a view of the ocean) because I was told there was a &quot;long&quot; waiting list for that particular area.  Oh yeah, and parking can be a bit of a hassle if you are not a valet parker like me.  I&apos;d rather park my own car...

I had a reservation there for Mother&apos;s Day. We arrived on time&amp;were told they were running 45 minutes behind. I immediately cancelled&amp;got on the phone to find an alternative. I&apos;ve been in the restaurant business for 20 years. If I were the GM there I would have had the hostess call all of the remaining reservations to give them a heads up rather than have them drive from all over the South Bay to be told to wait nearly an hour. It&apos;s really poor management when that happens, unless they were short handed in the kitchen. They also may have been greedy&amp;overbooked. At any rate the experience was frustrating. Luckily we were able to get a table at Tapas&amp;Vino, which is always good.

I decided to try this place out, as I&apos;ve never been here but always lived nearby. It was great, the view was one of a kind, seriously. I don&apos;t think any place beats this view, right on the beach, less than 25 feet from the ocean. It. Was. Amazing. On top of that my wife and I got the salad bar (which was a good choice), and I got the Chicken Romano. It was easily one of the best dinners I&apos;ve had in a while. It was expensive, but worth every penny. I&apos;ll be back for sure.

I went to Chart House with my friend who lives in the apartment building next store, another friend and her husband, and their baby.  We were starving and in the mood for seafood so we thought we&apos;d give it a try (despite living there for the past year and a half, my friend had never been).  The atmosphere is nice--dark and cozy with a great view of the ocean.

We came in on a Friday without a reservation, so we ended up sitting in the bar area.  Not ideal, and it took a long time to get our drinks and appetizers in, but our waitress was very friendly and it was our fault for not calling ahead.  We ordered the crab mango avocado stack, the hummus trio, and the &quot;best of&quot; soup trio for appetizers.  The crab mango avocado stack was fresh and nicely presented, although I didn&apos;t expect the crab to be prepared as in crab salad, with mayonnaise and everything.  The hummus trio was all right, and the clam chowder in the &quot;best of&quot; soup trio was great.  (The lobster bisque tasted too strongly of sherry, though, and the gazpacho was just like eating salsa, which wasn&apos;t what I expected.)

For dinner, we ordered a burger and fries, the &quot;best of&quot; shrimp (crab stuffed shrimp, shrimp scampi, and coconut crunchy shrimp), and the filet mignon.  The &quot;best of&quot; shrimp was pretty good, and the filet and the mashed potatoes it came with were yummy as well.  Not sure about the burger and fries--the pickiest one in our group ordered it and seemed to like it just fine.

We got dessert to go--my friends tried the hot chocolate lava cake and I had a fruit crisp.  The fruit crisp had kind of a weird savory taste to it that I didn&apos;t really like, but I think my friends liked the cake.

I would probably go back to Chart House again, but I&apos;d order some different things next time.

Very slow and strange service. ABSOLUTELY NO vegetarian options and you feel very unreasonable for asking, too. The music sounds like a soundtrack from a clothing store - not fitting.

2 stars in stead of 1 because one of the best views on the coast and beautiful atmosphere.

I went to the Chart House in Redondo last night for the second time in the past few months.  The first time was mediocre and so I thought I would write a review since my second time was even worse than mediocre.  To start with, my party of 3 ordered a bottle of Camus - $135 (and preceeded to order 2 other nice bottles afterwards).  The waiter would walk by our table with empty glasses and not refill our wine so I had to lift up the huge decanter to fill our glasses.  My water was empty almost the entire dinner without refill. We ordered the artichoke appetizer and the waiter made a big deal about how HUGE it was going to be - well, yes, it was on a big plate but it was a regular to smaller than average size artichoke.  It was tasty, but i am confused as to why he said it was so big.  If they had just put the sauces in dipping bowls and it wouldn&apos;t take up so much room on the table???  For dinner, I ordered the Surf&amp;Turf with Filet Medallians - i asked for the peppercorn sauce on the side (because i do not like pepper).  Apparently, that is how they cover up the fact that their meat is DRY.  I asked for it medium to medium rare - the waiter specifically said that medium would be pink throughout and that medium rare would be red.  My meat was pink - but very light pink and in my opinion it was medium well.  They offered to bring me AuJus to moisten it up - even though I made a big deal BEFORE ordering it that i did not want  overdone meat! I&apos;ve cooked filet on my own without any sauce that has come out more moist.  I ate it with the AuJus but it was not at all what I would expect to get at a Chart House restaurant.  I had debated going to Kincaid&apos;s down the street because of its reviews and will likely check it out next time.  I was VERY disappointed with the entire meal and the service from what should be a classy restaurant over looking the water.  The one thing that was good was the chocolate lava dessert.  But too bad I had to wait until the end of my meal to get it.

Go somewhere else.

Overpriced, poor quality, slow service.

The only redeeming quality of this place is the view of the ocean that you might get if you get a table close enough to the right window.

I&apos;ve found myself at this place two times in the past year, with different groups.  Folks keep planning small and medium sized events here because, many years ago, Chart House was a classy, high profile place.  In all three cases the consensus was &quot;never ever come back here again.&quot;

In my most recent experience, an international group planned a dinner here.  It was a medium sized group event -- about 20 folks. The reservations were made well in advance and we had our own room. The restaurant was otherwise almost empty and there was a large number of staff. I don&apos;t know what they were doing, but they certainly were not waiting on us.

I paid $57 for an exceptionally low grade filet mignon, prepared medium well in spite of my request for medium rare.  It wasn&apos;t just me.  Most of the party commented on the low quality of the food, especially for the price.  The waitress taking our order was abrupt and unaccommodating.  The food took an extraordinary amount of time to arrive.  After it was finally delivered, no one came to check on us until desert.

The most frustrating part was getting out of there.  After the meal we had to wait half an hour just to get the bill, then another 20 minutes for the server to bring it back.  Even then he messed it up and took it back to &quot;recalculate.&quot;

Other folks have had good experiences here from time to time.  But with so many great ocean view places in Redondo Beach, why gamble on this one?

The Chart House is such a cute, romantic place to go on a date. It over looks the ocean and the lighting of the restaurant compliments the view.

This restaurant mainly serves seafood. I&apos;m not a seafood eater, but this place actually accommodates those of us who can&apos;t have seafood. All their non-seafood options are delicious. I highly recommend the CH Chopped Salad. Their baked potato is delicious. Their salad bar is a great option as well. Don&apos;t forget dessert! The lava cake and creme brulee are delicious. It is quite pricy, but it&apos;s worth it.

If you&apos;re looking for a great date spot, this is the place!

This place is ok.  The service was kind of slow but our waitress was definitely a sweetheart.  We came here for family dinner on Christmas day because most other restaurants were closed and the food was good.  If I come back, I will definitely get the seared yellow tail again.

Appetizers:
Crab cake- Delicious but only comes with one cake per order
Crab Stuffed mushrooms- Ehh... I expected something with more taste, it was mediocre and not exciting.
East meets West Tuna-  Ok, I feel like the malibu location spiced this dish up a little better.

Dinner:
Seared yellowtail-  Best dish ordered on the table, comes with mashed potatoes and a wasabi drizzle sauce.
Panko crusted sea bass- i sent it back because it was over cooked, but the creamed spinach it came on was delicious.
Macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi- really sweet with the peanut sauce.  The veggies on the side lacked crunch as they were also over cooked.

Dessert:
Raspberry Creme Brulee- Delicious!
Cheesecake- ok

Meal cost (including 3 mohitos, 2 glasses of wine, a jack&amp;coke, and a heineken)= $307 before tip.

Thank you District Manager and Becky H.~ the gal who directed my letter to him.
The District Manager finally got in touch with my husband after our April experience and apologized and offered to comp our next visit. The thing about Yelp and me is I never review a place expecting to receive something for good or bad reviews and we really never intended to take him up on his offer but we ended up actually doing it this last weekend. It was our Anniversary and my husband and I had, had our first date at this very Chart House 18 years ago so we wanted to go there and since the offer was on the table, we decided to see if it was for real.

And it was!

But even better, we got a chance to see Chart House SHINE again as we knew it. The salad bar was amazing and filled full this time.... The waiter was friendly and knew how to up sell! (Even with our meals comped... we still paid close to $200 with salads, desserts and drinks... not even alcoholic!)  Not sure how that happened?? But we ended up buying one of their $25 Corporate CARDS for the future. The prime rib was delicious, the food was amazing. The staff was great. We are believers again!!!
Thank you Chart House and Becky H.&amp;M Richardson!!!
By the way people~~~~PERFECT example of how http://Yelp.com was worth the time to take a few minutes and make it work for ya! Not that I ever really think I am doing anything other than reviewing for the sake of other customers out there and in this case PR people from corporations that actually do care and want the feedback!

Went for New Year&apos;s Eve dinner. Granted NYE is a very busy night, we re-confirmed our reservation for 8PM twice in the day to be sure we were covered. We ended up having to wait 40 minutes to be seated.

Next, our waiter was so frazzled/rushed that I felt like he was doing us a favor by asking for our order. Salad was served wrong after waiting forever for it. Water was empty all night. He got frustrated with us to ask anything about the food. Salmon was OK, but lukewarm. I couldn&apos;t wait to leave.

We left feeling like we imposed on the restaurant for wanting to eat there on a busy night and were super late to our party plans.

Will be hard for me to ever go back.

Valet Parking only! $3.50. No self parking anymore.

Quality of food has gotten worse. Greens used in salad is dried up and stale. Service was super slow when the restaurant was half empty. Our drinks were never refilled, and waiter never came to check on us. He only showed his face when he brought our food and every item was missing utensils, which we had to ask for. Really? bring me prime rib and expect me to cut it with a butter knife that was already dirty from buttering my bread?

Terrible!

I came here for my 2 year wedding anniversary. I liked how they printed our &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; on the menu for us.

My wife and I went there straight from work and had &quot;dressed-down&quot; that day. It was obvious that our waiter judged us by our attire. He did not seem too happy with us in comparison to the other guests. Maybe we should have dressed up.

My wife asked the waiter if we could order from the salad bar and share it. We were gonna continue by saying that we were gonna order the 16oz. steak as well. We were gonna order both and share. But before we got to mention the steak, the waiter sort of freaked out and told us we can&apos;t do that. He was assuming (in our dressed down attire) that would wanted to order one salad and share it all night until we got full (unlimited salad). The way he told us we couldn&apos;t do that was awkward and uncomfortable. We ignored it due to the occasion. My wife ordered the shrimp platter and I ordered the 16oz. steak.

The shrimp platter was ok. The steak came out gray and dry. It looked like death. Really, I cook steak often and I order steak often at restaurants and this was sick. Not a cool type of sick, the bad kind.

We returned it and a new one came out, still bad but better than the first.

In all honesty, 1 star for the menu and the good view of the ocean.

I will most likely never come back here again... I would rather spend $100 at the stinking rose in Beverly Hills

This review is from Christmas Dinner on 12/25/2011...

So I must admit that I agree with many of the recent reviews of this place and how the quality of it has been going down.  I used to travel to this area every week about 5 years or so back in the mid 2000s and it used to be spectacular.

I&apos;m only giving it a 3 rating because the foot was pretty good, especially the scallops which we had along with the larger cut of the Prime Rib which wasn&apos;t bad, but mostly because our Server managed to get me the Prime Rib after her boss rudely interrupted our table while we were ordering to whisper there was no more Prime Rib available.  If it wasn&apos;t for the Server I likely would have given this place a 1 or possible a 2 because of the poor management of the GM and his attitude.

#1 - the GM should NEVER approach a table in that fashion and use terms like 86 that which carries such a negative connotation especially for a place which is suppose to be considered on the higher scales.

#2 - After we called the GM over to try to see if there was anything he could do as I was excited to have their Prime Rib, he never even apologized for anything and even came so close as to violate my girlfriend&apos;s personal space being within inches awkwardly as if an attempt to intimidate her from further complaint or speech.

#3 - I understand that it&apos;s Christmas but the establishment you choose to work for decided to be open for Christmas dinner, which is great for people who aren&apos;t with their families or even alone on Christmas evening but please adjust the attitude as if each customer should be grateful they are being served.  You&apos;re the employee by choice in a place which chooses to be open on Christmas day, adjust the attitude, stop complaining, or quit your job but please don&apos;t take it out on the customers.

I understand that this is LA and that I&apos;m not Kobe Bryant but the making of an excellent establishment is to make me feel like I am even if I&apos;m not getting any special treatment that a star may receive.

Food for thought for next year and to try to make changes now to save your establishment from being swept to the likes of a diner type restaurant or even Outback.

I was visiting from out of town and had dinner with 3 others on a Saturday night. Without a reservation, we were able to walk in and get a corner table with views of the waves crashing on the beach, great. We tried the calamari (very fresh and served with tasty dipping sauces), I had the salad bar (a good amount of options to play with), and I ordered the prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes for dinner. The prime rib was cooked just to my specifications. There was some fat on the cut, but not an extraordinary amount. It came with a side cup of dipping sauce of some sort, perhaps au jus, that complemented it well. To cap the dinner off, we had the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream, which after all the food I had tried, I was able to make room for this after setting eyes on it.

I would recommend trying the Chart House, ask for a window seat and enjoy your meal.

Went the other night for a family birthday. Wasn&apos;t expecting much, since I knew the great Chart Houses of old and also knew how badly this chain has gone downhill. My experience with them has been the same in Aspen, Dana Point and now Redondo. The food, with the exception of the lobster bisque was awful. I quite honestly had the worst piece of Mahi I have ever experienced in my life. And at 35 bucks for the entree, it was grand theft. Everyone in our party had the same experience, be it with fish, seafood or meat. Avoid this place if you like good food. The prices are insane for this quality. For a $35 entree, look elsewhere, somewhere that has a real chef.

I&apos;m giving this place 5 stars even though the hostesses were totally rude to me over the phone.  This is because my server was awesome and the food is amazing.

We had three kids with us which could drive any server crazy, but ours just smiled and interacted with them like a sweetheart.  He was super attentive and looked like Doug Funny, which made it fun for me to sing the theme song in my head every time he approached our table.

The hummus was okay, but the tuna appetizer was amazing!  The stuffed mushrooms are also worth a try.  I&apos;d also recommend getting the lava cake.  It&apos;s definiately worth the wait.  As for entrees, all seven of us adults were raving about our dish so I&apos;d say you can&apos;t go wrong with whatever you choose.

The view is also breathtaking!  Right on the water.

I&apos;m giving this a 3 I think out of nostalgia and the food was still good. I have been coming to the chart house since I was a toddler. I have spent numerous birthdays and other occasions here.

My boyfriend wanted to take me here for my birthday with some friends since he knew how much my family loves it.  He made the reservation online and we were seated right away when we arrived.

They have done away with self parking but what do you expect? Most places in the area make you valet.

It was a Tuesday so it was very quiet but when we walked up to our table a man (I&apos;m assuming the manager?) got very close to my friend and said &quot;brandy?&quot; in a kind of your in trouble sort of way. She looked at him a little afraid and pointed to me to which he said again &quot;brandy?&quot;. I said yes even though he kinda creeped me out and he replied &quot;you sit here&quot; and pointed to a specific chair.

I understand that they wanted to know who the birthday girl was but the way he did it made me like I was in grade school and in trouble!

We laughed it off and went on to menus. They had printed my name and happy birthday on our menus which they usually do... Makes a girl feel very special! Some 20 minutes later a waiter came out and asked for drinks. Now I am all for a long dinner but I get thirsty! Another 15 minutes goes by and all of a sudden the waiter hits me in the head with a tray of our drinks!!!!! My glass of wine tumbled over my head and somehow missed me and ended up everywhere. How I was not covered in red wine I don&apos;t know. The look on my boyfriends face I almost felt bad for the guy and he apologized so I tried to let it go.

ANOTHER 10 minutes go by and he brings out everyone else&apos;s drinks but mine! Really?? I have a lot of patience but this was starting to get ridiculous.

We ordered the steamed artichoke (my favorite!) and the calamari for appetizers. The artichoke was great as usual but the calamari was cold.

The waiter almost seemed like he had never waited tables before. He never offered to fill up our drinks and had to be asked numerous times and even then we would wait forever for them. He finally brought our food and it was all very good. I had the short rib and mashed potatoes. We ordered the green beans (think they&apos;re called jasmine maybe??) and they were amazing. We also preordered the lava cake which is always great (the mud pie is my favorite though).

Then it took an unbelievable amount of time to get our bill. (which was in no way adjusted for the tray of drinks incident).

They did nothing to recognize my birthday, now I&apos;m not saying I expected anything but why did the big creepy guy ask who I was and demand me to sit somewhere?? So he could make sure the tray of drinks was spilled on me?

All in all the service was horrible, view was great, food was decent, but I may reconsider the chart house as my go to. Don&apos;t know if the view is worth being covered in wine anymore.

After our experience with the Scottsdale Chart House, we were nervous to go to another Chart House.  So glad my g/f recommended it.  The food was fabulous.  We had their coconut shrimp which has the best coconut flavor as a appetizer.  Then we had their exceptional salad bar with so much variety that you could make a meal out of it.  We both had the Chicken Romano in the panko breading and light lemon sauce which was fabulous.  The accompanying grilled asparagus was so good and the Yukon Gold mashed potatoes were good as well.  The service was ok but not stellar.  Wonderful views of the ocean surf.  All in all, a great experience and one of the better Chart House locations.  This Chart House is reminiscent of the great meals of our childhood on Shelter Island and Coronado which, unfortunately are n more.  We will be back.

It&apos;s OKAY.

Wow $32 for a steak (16oz).  Some nice cut with some fat on it.  Good for the lifters/bodybuilders/fitness people who are in their bulking phase (like me).
I didn&apos;t want the fish last night and there wasn&apos;t much on the menu that I didn&apos;t like.  The salad bar was alright but nothing like a buffet salad bar but hey they were serving Cesear salad as well, so we didn&apos;t have to pay a seperate for that.  They have watermelon even though it&apos;s not in season here in North America.

The wait though was long.  Fat Tire beer was good.  The server(s) was attentive most of the time even though other servers would fill your water without you asking them.

Bring lots of quarters for the meter and don&apos;t waste your $$$ on valet parking where you don&apos;t want some stranger driving your expensive Chevy Vega/Ford Pinto or Lincoln Towncar.  Oh wait you want to valet park your Vega/Pinto and self park your towncar.  Some cars were left running, I was thinking in my head let&apos;s play some Grand Theft Auto Vice City!

stick with the appetizers here, otherwise the main dishes will be mediocre and pricey.

mussels-plump and yummy, broth has good flavoring

best time is happy hour

mahi mahi with crab meat is good but not yummy enough for the price

service was poor, they didn&apos;t take our appetizer plates away when they served our main entrees, we had to move our own dishes, our server didn&apos;t stop by until we were done eating, he never asked how was our meal...

the quality of food has dropped since the last time i was here. i had the seafood mixed grill and it was good but not $30+ good. came with a crab cake, 3 shrimp and citrus salmon. the crab cake was the best thing on that plate. the lobster bisque tasted like they used sour milk but the server came back and said it was good...ok but it still tasted like sour milk. they also had a grilled tilapia plate w/ mashed taters for $35. I didn&apos;t order that but really? tilapia is the cheapest fish out there. somehow that was more than the alaskan halibut?

given i can make that for about $4 i&apos;ll do that at home

Came here for a friend&apos;s wedding and had a great experience.
The first thing you&apos;ll notice is the beautiful view of the beach.
My friend had her ceremony indoor, but overlooking the ocean.
It was a great option since we can enjoy the view without the super windy weather.
After ceremony hors d&apos;oeuvres were served.
Delicious varieties of cheese, crackers, and fruits. Not to forget the yummy coconut shrimp.
The lunch was served buffet style. They have carving station, pasta station, seafood options, chicken, rice, salad, I don&apos;t even remember how many items they served. But they were all super delicious!
Not to forget the scrumptious lava cake for dessert! Oh, and the yummy strong champagne.
Overall I had a great experience coming to my friend&apos;s wedding at Chart House. Would definitely come again for some special occasion in the future :):)

Well as everybody knows I&apos;m a Chart House connoisseur I plan vacations around them, I spend every Birthday and Anniversary trying different Chart Houses.
This was for my 41 st Birthday Redondo Beach Chart House, I got sampled the oysters on a half shell and found I have lost my taste for them, but the House prepared them perfectly, I just think my taste buds are changing in my old age. Next was the salad bar, it could have used some fresh lettcue but everything else was fresh and good. Main course was borderline amazing, Filet stuffed with Blue&amp;Lobster tail with Yukon Jack Mash Potatoes, OUT OF THIS WORLD!
The view was nice it was the first storm of fall so it was VERY windy, rainy, and cold but nice and warm inside. The view was INSANE!
Cant say enough about Chart Houses,...next time Playa Del Rey or Dana Point..havent decided yet....

I am reviewing the Chart House as a potential wedding venue.

Erin who coordinates was lovely to work with.  Very straightforward, and friendly.

Pros:
-you can get married on the beach!
-they have done some upgrades to the decor lately
-flexible - they are pretty easy going about anything they can accomodate for you
-the View of the ocean right there
-prices are reasonable
-handicap accessible - they have a ramp down to the beach down to concrete next to where you would be getting married.

Cons:
-The beach wedding site is next to a parking lot (at the back end)
-it is a restaurant so some of the bells and whistles aren&apos;t there that a hotel or more traditional wedding venue would have for you.  But again, Erin seems to find a way to make things work for you.

All and all this is a good option, especially if you are set on a beach wedding during the day.

This place used to be great.  Not sure exactly when or why the service went down, but it is definitely not the same.  The service was very slow, even though they were not very busy at all (on a Saturday night at 8pm-that says a lot right there).  The blue cheese medallion dinner came withOUT the blue cheese and we had to wait way too long to get it from the server, one of our side dishes did not come out at the same time as the rest of our meals, our table was not cleared of used  appetizer/bread dishes as often as it should have been and finally, we gave our server our  dessert order at the same time we placed our meal orders, hoping that would expedite the service.  Unfortunately,  it did not.  We waited a substantial amount of time after our meals were finished before our dessert finally came.

To top it all off, when we left, there was a line about 10 people deep for the new valet service-which is a total rip off and joke.  There was only one older gentleman running back and forth through the tiny garage retrieving cars.  We finally just gave the poor guy our money and asked for our own keys.  Ridiculous.

Like someone else mentioned, the view is awesome, but that is about all this restaurant has to offer these days.  However, had the manager even tried to make things right, we would may have given it another try.   All he could come up with was, &quot;Sorry.&quot;  WOW.  Oh well, this was one of about 3 bad experiences we&apos;ve had there in the last year or so.  Third times a charm!  Bye Bye Chart House!

Don&apos;t eat here, period. Our experience was so bad, I have written to them flat out asking for my money back. Service is slow and rude. A manager never came to our table, nor did I see a manager come out to any table to interact with guests. Waaaaaaay too pricey as well - you are basically paying for their beach front mortgage. I have yet to hear back from them. It has been almost 24 hours. As a management professional in the industry, this would have been addressed immediately if it were my establishment.

History
 
 Established in 1961 

Since 1961, Chart House Restaurants has been dedicated to providing the ideal fine dining experience. With 31 historic, waterfront and showcase locations across the U.S., Chart House offers incomparable views and personal attention that you&apos;re sure to appreciate. Notice something different about Chart House? Many of our locations have recently undergone million-dollar transformations to help make your dining experience even better.

The renowned chefs of Chart House have tailored a menu to complement local cuisine while introducing a hint of the exotic. Chart House offers top-of-the-catch seafood, succulent steaks and decadent desserts. Choose from our famous entrées such as Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi, Shrimp Fresca and our succulent, slow roasted Prime Rib. We also offer a daily selection of fresh fish, an extensive collection of fine wines and whiskies, and decadent desserts, like our famous Hot Chocolate Lava Cake.
