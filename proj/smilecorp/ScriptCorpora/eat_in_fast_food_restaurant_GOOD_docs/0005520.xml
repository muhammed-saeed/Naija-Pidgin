 IS THERE A DEFINITE DATE FOR THE OPENING OF THE NEW THEATER YET? (VIEW ANSWER) 

 Dear Fred,
My mother went to an auction and bought two spa tickets for the whole weekend. She had offered them to me since she had no interest in going. Once she heard my ?this is the closest you will get to being a dog? remark she decided to join me. The humiliating part is she has signed us up for the couple?s spa! We have our differences and I do not think this will go well. She has requested adjoining rooms for us! And the worst part is the spa does not serve coffee! Because my mother, whom I have a bad relationship with, has already bought the tickets, I would seem ungrateful if I refused to go. How should I handle this?

 The Cherry Grove part of Celebrate Virginia appears to have been a flop for The Silver Companies. It seems stores are closing on a daily basis there. Ruby Tuesday, that had planned a restaurant there, is trying to sell the land they own. A Sonic and a car wash were also planned, Pizza Hut was supposed to move from its current location on Rte 17 to the new development, now that is not happening. When is the Silver Company going to admit its failure in that area and go ahead and tear down the current empty eyesores and make it a park? That would make much more sense. They have cost the Stafford taxpayers alot of money and have nothing to show for it. (VIEW ANSWER)
