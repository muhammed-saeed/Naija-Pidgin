The Invention Of The Modern Cup Holder
 Simple in appearance and function, the cup holder is something that most of us could hardly do without. It has become a modern necessity that few recognize, even though they use it daily.

We drink to live. Our bodies require water for sustenance. Not only is water necessary for our lives, but drinking certain beverages has also become routine or trendy. Many cannot go without their morning coffee and perhaps at your work office it is popular to drink lattes. Whatever the case, drinking is a part of our daily lives.

It is primarily because drinking is such an integral part of our lives that the cup holder was first developed. James Guillow invented this modern necessity in&apos;43. However, due to some oversight, this device&apos;s potential was not widely recognized until years later.

In the&apos;60&apos;s, drive-through restaurants became suddenly popular and the selling of cup holders boomed. Drivers needed a place to safely accommodate their beverages while driving. At this time, the cup holder was just in primate form; it existed as a wedge-shaped device that could clip to a car window or fit inside the center console.

Built in cup holders in automobiles later became increasingly more common. As families began to travel more and the minivan came onto the scene, they became more common. The auto industry also had to work hard to keep up with the beverage industry as they began experimenting with different size cups and bottles. They lived up to the challenge, soon inventing the expandable and retractable cup holder.

The one major event that has led to an increase in cup holders occurred when a seventy-nine year old woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico spilled ordered hot coffee from a McDonalds fast food restaurant. The scalding coffee was spilled on the poor woman&apos;s lap, leaving her seriously scalded. The woman first merely asked McDonalds to pay her doctor bill, pay her cleaning bill, and apologize. When McDonalds refused to do so, they found themselves in a lawsuit where they were forced to pay millions. So sadly for its history, the cup holder seems to actually have been born out of lawsuits more than anything!

Cup holders in automobiles actually are more about safety than anything. More than six million auto accidents occur in the United States every year. This is a high statistic, making every individuals chance of being involved in an accident quite high. Using a cup holder instead of being distracted or driving hazardously while holding a cup can do much to reduce your risk of having an accident.

Cup holders are basically appreciated for their function, but the location and placement of these devices is also of great importance. They must be placed within easy reach but also not be in the way. This can especially be important to you if you drive a stick shift.

Parents are also grateful for cup holders. There is so much hands on work to be done with small children and a cup holder can help in many various ways. They are now available on most baby strollers and car seats.

Now cup holders are such a modern convenience that they would be greatly missed were they to suddenly start disappearing. For not only have we begun to use them for their primary purpose, but they have suddenly become coin holders, phone holders, and a good place to set any small items you need easy access to without the worry of them flying across the floor! So yes, cup holders have become a necessity for most Americans&apos; daily lives.
