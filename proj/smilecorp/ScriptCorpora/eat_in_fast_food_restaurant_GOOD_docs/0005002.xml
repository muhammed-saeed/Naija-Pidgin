6 Drinks That Make You Fat

 By Seth Czarnecki Reviewed by QualityHealth&apos;s Medical Advisory Board 
The number of people who are obese is itself becoming a rotund figure, and America ranks as the ninth fattest country in the world. Foods high in calories, fat, sugar, and carbohydrates contribute to weight gain, but beverages are often forgotten in America&apos;s perpetual weight gain. They&apos;re more fattening than you might think. In fact, one study found that Americans drink 356 calories a day. Find out which ones are expanding your waistline with this guide to the fluids that are most likely to make you fat.

 Soda. Making up for 10 percent of the average American&apos;s caloric intake, soda is at the top of the beverage blunder list. Research has shown that soda consumption is directly linked to weight gain. In addition to offering large quantities of calories, soda&apos;s high concentrations of sugar and starch often contribute to overeating. Walking off one 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola Classic (which has 143 calories and 39.9 grams of sugar) will take 27 minutes.

 Beer. Although the infamous beer belly isn&apos;t caused solely by this barbecue favorite, it certainly doesn&apos;t help. The average light beer has more than 100 calories and 6 grams of carbohydrates per can. These stats alone may not be alarming, but if you enjoy one beer a night for a week, you should also enjoy walking them off-cumulatively, it will take three hours and 20 minutes.

 Coffee Drinks. One cup of black coffee can be a relatively healthy morning eye-opener at only two calories per cup. Unfortunately, many people partake in less healthy forms of caffeination. One of these less desirable coffee choices is Starbucks&apos; venti 2 percent Peppermint White Chocolate Mocha. With 660 calories, 22 grams of fat (14 grams, saturated), and 95 grams of sugar, this caffeinated catastrophe can wreak serious havoc on your diet.

 Energy Drinks. Often used as an alternative to drinking coffee or for a late night jolt, energy drinks are becoming an increasingly popular choice. Sales for these beverages have reached upwards of $3.4 billion a year. However, top-selling Red Bull shows 27 grams of sugar are contained in one 8.3-ounce can. Such high levels of sugar can have an adverse effect on your metabolism. Because much of your morning drowsiness is derived from dehydration, if you&apos;re looking to get a good morning boost, reach for a glass of ice-cold water.

 Smoothies. Confused because you thought the smoothie was a healthy choice? Well, it can be-depending on its preparation. One made with nothing more than ice and frozen fruit can be a healthy, refreshing snack. But frozen drink lovers beware, some smoothies are more like milkshakes. Jamba Juice&apos;s Peanut Butter Moo&apos;d Power Smoothie (30 ounces) packs a fattening punch with 1,170 calories and 169 grams of sugar. If you&apos;re dieting, be sure to check what goes into your beverage before undoing your hard work.

 Frozen Alcoholic Beverages. If you like Pina Coladas...you may want to look for a different daiquiri. High in sugar (16 grams) and fat (10.2 grams and 8.9 grams of saturated fat) due to its being made with pineapple juice and coconut milk, the seemingly inconspicuous Pina Colada can easily sabotage your beach body. Like your alcohol on the fruity side? Reach for a mojito to save many grams of fat and calories.
