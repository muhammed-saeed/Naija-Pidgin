 Healthy fast food to go please! 
 Healthy fast food to go please! 
Written By: Tesi Johnson, Gleaner Writer

  
 WITH THE increasing prevalence of lifestyle diseases, persons are becoming increasingly aware of the perils of of bad eating habits.Obesity, diabetes and hypertension are on the increase and as such individuals are actively seeking healthier food alternatives. In today&apos;s fast-paced society where time is scarce, convenience reigns supreme, and so fast food will remain in the favour of those seeking to eat in a hurry. Therein the problem lies - fast food is rarely healthy.
 WHOLESOME FOODS 
The intention to eat more wholesome foods is noble in theory, but in practice, its feasibility comes into question. For the idea to be workable, eating healthily should be as convenient as eating &apos;unhealthily&apos;. If a fast food restaurant wishes to retain the patronage of consumers who intend to change their diets, then its menu must include items which appeal to their new tastes.
Mother&apos;s, a Jamaican fast food chain that is known for its patties, recently added the Power Patty, a soy-based product, to its offerings. The Power Patty is a substitute for the meat-filled patties, and since its launch, has garnered much public support, according to Tanya McDonald, the public relations and local marketing manager for Mother&apos;s. &quot;As a result of the extensive positive feedback on the Power Patty, we are currently working on adding two other vegetable-content products in the coming year. We are making the extra effort to come up with healthier alternatives for our customers&quot;, she says. Juici Patties, another fast food restaurant of Jamaican origin, has tailored their menu to include healthier food choices. It boasts a line of whole-wheat products, both meat and vegetable filled, as well as the vegetable patty. Jerked chicken, which is known to be a healthier alternative to fried chicken, is on the menus of both Mother&apos;s and Juici Patties.
Likewise, Jerked chicken is the signature product of the Island Grill chain and this along with their roasted fish and natural juices, make for good eats for those wishing to please their palates in a hurry, while maintaining a healthy diet.
In the United States of America fast food restaurants have been made the scapegoats for the obesity epidemic that now plagues that country. Consequently, these restaurants have been forced to add more wholesome products to their menus in order to maintain their customer base. A number of these restaurants have set up shop in Jamaica, and generally the changes and additions that are effected abroad, are carried over to Jamaica. Wendy&apos;s, an American franchise which has a few locales in Kingston, has altered the way it sells &apos;combos&apos;. Consumers can now opt to have a side salad, or a Caesar side salad with their combos, rather than the traditional French fries, at no extra cost. Burger King now offers a chicken Caesar salad for those who do not desire a fat-filled hamburger.
Subway, which specialises in sandwiches, salads, and wraps, has based its entire advertising campaign on the wholesomeness of its products. Subway has been successfully riding on the health food wave, and so the chain has developed a reputation for offering customers a better alternative to traditional greasy and fatty fast food.
 MORE COSTLY 
Unfortunately, the healthier alternatives tend to be more expensive than the less healthful choices. At Burger King, a Whopper meal that includes a burger, a medium serving of fries and medium soda costs $280, whereas a chicken Caesar salad costs $355 for the salad only. Furthermore, Subway sandwiches are costly in comparison to other fast food restaurants, with prices ranging from $300 upwards for the sandwich only, whereas $300 could purchase a full meal with side order and a drink elsewhere. Nonetheless, the onus lies with the consumer to decide if preserving good health is worthy of ponying up the extra cash . Good thing to know is that its available.
 Tips on eating healthily at a fast food restaurant 
No matter how tempted you feel do not &apos;super size&apos;, &apos;go large&apos;, or increase your serving in any way. Don&apos;t allow the cashier to influence you to add anything to your order.
Do not have cheese with your sandwich or burger.
If they serve sandwiches or burgers, ask for whole wheat bread or buns if available.
Opt for water, or juices without added sugar rather than sodas. If you feel you must have sodas, have the diet version.
Avoid cream-based salad dressings. They are very fatty, thus defeating the purposes of eating the salad. Instead, try a vinegar-based emulsion with your salad.
Use as little condiments as you can. Ketchup, mustard and such, are rife with sugars and fat.
