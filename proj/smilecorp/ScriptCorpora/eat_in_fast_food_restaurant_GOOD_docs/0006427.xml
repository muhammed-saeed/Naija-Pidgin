 Daily Horoscope for July 12 
 
 Scorpio

A strange mood is affecting your relationships today, making it difficult to avoid crossed wires and misunderstandings. If you arrange to meet someone, there could be hitches before you&apos;re able to get together or the meeting may not exactly be an overwhelming success. It&apos;s simply one of those days when everyone is on different wavelengths and it&apos;s difficult to tune into each other.
