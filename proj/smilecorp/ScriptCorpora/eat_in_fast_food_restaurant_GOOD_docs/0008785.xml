 What are the laws regarding car booting in Tennessee? If no signs are clearly posted, how can I dispute a fee?  
 
Additional Details

 I was booted for parking in a fast food restaurant parking lot which had gone out of business. The sign at the entrance was not properly attached and could not be read (tow truck driver agreed). Do signs have to be posted, and if so, what actions can I take against the towing company?
