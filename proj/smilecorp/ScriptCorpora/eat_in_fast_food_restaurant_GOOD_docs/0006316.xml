 Wendy and Alan Oxlade are having to turn people away from The Shoulder of Mutton after being overwhelmed by a Groupon promotion

Table for 1,236 please
By Paul Cassell 
November 15, 2011

 
A village pub could be forced to turn away business after an online voucher blunder saw more than 1,000 discounts sold to customers.

Alan Oxlade, who runs The Shoulder of Mutton in Playhatch, placed a special offer with internet deals site Groupon for a starter, main meal and glass of wine at £21.50 per couple until March.

The site, which launched in 2009, invites people to sign-up and take advantage of cut-price deals on a variety of products, services and gifts within a set time period.

The couple agreed to run the deal for one day which went live last Friday but this was extended without their notice, leading to hundreds of vouchers being snapped up by eager diners.

Mr Oxlade told getreading: “Initially we were very happy that people were buying the vouchers because it showed that our image was good and people wanted to dine here.

“However, later that day we were tipped off that level of vouchers had reached unacceptable heights and warned that Groupon would carry on selling the vouchers over the weekend.

“To try and prevent the situation from getting any worse, we instructed the rep to stop the deal after the 24 hour agreed period.

“This did not happen and to date Groupon have sold 1,236 vouchers, to local people, potential new customers.

“We are a small pub with only 15 tables. The offer is on for three months, evenings only, with Fridays and Saturdays already sold out.

“Even if we filled the whole pub every night to capacity, with people redeeming vouchers there would still be hundreds of people unable to get a table.

“We are not a fast food restaurant and expect our customers to enjoy a leisurely meal here, which adds to the whole Shoulder of Mutton dining experience.”

Mr Oxlade believed that a number of the purchased vouchers may have been for Christmas presents which he said will be hard, if not impossible, to redeem.

He added that the pub had taken no money for the vouchers and only stood to receive 60 per cent of their value.

Mr Oxlade has recommended customers to contact Groupon directly for a refund.

The Shoulder of Mutton is offering all customers who book in November and might otherwise be disappointed as a result of the Groupon offer, a main meal for £10 and a free glass of house wine.

 getreading contacted Groupon but has not received any response.

    I note the pub concerned is still video advertising on this site. Gluttons for punishment? One who knows, Chaversham

    We at Need a cake were in the same situation and it nearly finished us. Groupon came so close to crippling us. Its a scam to the business. Ring us if we can offer any support to you. Keep smiling. Rachel Needacake

    @Fondue: Plus as the article says, they&apos;re only due to get 60% of the price of the deal - which is £12.90 - so providing starter, main meal and glass of wine for £6.45 is very different in my book to three courses with no wine for £11 per person. Chushingura

    Butler - it&apos;s a problem if the business model was based on a limited number of low-margin or loss-leading meals, to generate word of mouth that&apos;d sell a lot more full price ones. If all the capacity is swallowed up by the flat/lossmaking meals, they&apos;ll make no money. That&apos;d definitely be a problem. ormy

    I bought a canvas through groupon in July - I am still waiting for my order to arrive. Groupon have been hopeless in trying to resolve this and the company I purchased the canvas from refuse to give me a delivery date - 7-10 days they quoted! C H, The tree in my garden, Tilehurst

I have tried the food in Abbot Cook and it is indeed very good. As are the beers. I do recommend it. 
But it&apos;s a very different deal to the Shoulder of Mutton. Arthur Mo

    Arthur Mo : I would be absolutely amazed if they can&apos;t turn this to their advantage and make a profit on this deal. Have a look around at other venues and they all have deals. Go and try the food in Abbott Cook before you start making assumptions - it&apos;s really good. Fondue

    &apos;I think the point is that there is no way they can accomodate 1,200+ people in a pub that only has 15 tables.&apos;

15 tables, at least 2 settings a day is at the lowest 60 people a day. In a month that is over 1800 people.

How is that a problem?

 I&apos;ll get you Butler!

    &apos;And I suspect that the typical Groupon customer is thinking &apos;great deal, what&apos;s the next one?&apos; and will never come back.&apos;

Based on what? All I know is if I have been served a good meal in an establishment I usually go back - discount or no discount.

    Yes, they have my sympathy ... but Groupon have had so much bad publicity over the recent months, I can&apos;t help but think they were rather daft doing a deal with them. It&apos;s no secret that Groupon do the people making the offers via them no favours at all. Do a bit of research on the web - it&apos;s free! - and there are numerous cautionary tales.

The Abbot Cook deal is 3 course for £11 per person, no drink. Shoulder of Mutton has two courses plus wine for 2 for £21.50. It&apos;s not a like-for-like. And knowing the Mutton, they don&apos;t want to compromise on their food just to do some mass market catering. That would be false advertising.

And I suspect that the typical Groupon customer is thinking &apos;great deal, what&apos;s the next one?&apos; and will never come back.

Whichever way you look at it, the Mutton has been dealt a very bad hand through no fault of its own. Arthur Mo

I know these two very slightly and I know how hard they have worked to build their business in what has been a pretty difficult time for country pubs.

Having a big faceless company like Groupon dump on them in this way is very harsh because it will be the Shoulder of Mutton&apos;s reputation which will end up being damaged. Jai

    These two may have more money than sense.

Its an opportunity for new regular trade, not something to get po-faced about. You may take a hit in the short-term but there is a longer view. I&apos;ll get you Butler!

    Fill the order books - erect a tent - ride the wave of business - tie in with a nearby pub business maybe - this is an opportunity not a calamity. If you can&apos;t make a profit on that deal then you shouldn&apos;t be in business. Abbot Cook at the junction have 3 courses for £11 and their food is brahma. Fondue
