 Long-delayed redevelopment finally gets going 

by Mike Parks 

Quail Corners’ much-anticipated facelift began this week, more than a year after developers first announced the $6-million revitalization of the aging south Charlotte shopping center.

Crosland Southeast is moving forward nearly six months after Charlotte City Council approved the controversial project.

Once work wraps up next fall, developers say this won’t be the same Quail Corners people along Park Road have come to know. While Crosland plans much aesthetic work, especially with new storefront exteriors, shoppers also can expect to see some of the center’s current tenants move and new stores move in. Plus, Harris Teeter, the center’s anchor, will expand.

“We are delighted to commence the much needed infrastructure work to kick off the redevelopment,” Peter Pappas, partner of Crosland Southeast, said in a news release Tuesday, Oct. 25. “Ultimately this will improve pedestrian and vehicular circulation which, along with building renovations, will enhance the shopping and dining experience for loyal customers of Quail Corners.”

Plans for the center look like this: Crews will soon start reconfiguring the parking lot and remove a portion of the berm around the perimeter. That will help make room for a new building along Park Road that is expected to be a fast-food restaurant with a drive-through. Developers have yet to say which fast-food company will join the center.

Initial plans for the redevelopment included adding a walking trail on top of the berm that could one day connect to the city’s greenway system.

Once that work wraps up and the holiday shopping season comes to an end, expansion of the Harris Teeter will begin. The store will grow by 1,800 square feet, and around this time, crews also will start re-facing the storefronts in the center, with a combination of brick masonry and stucco.

They’ll also install an open-air plaza for outdoor dining and potential live entertainment near the center of the development.

Meanwhile, CNL Crosland leaders have said some current tenants may change locations in the center to find better space for their needs. A TCBY frozen-yogurt shop will fill the spot vacated by Dilworth Coffee earlier this summer.

The Crosland Southeast website for Quail Corners lists five vacant units in the unit, not counting Dilworth Coffee’s old location. It’s unclear when the website was last updated. Salsarita’s, which will move from its building on the edge of the center to an in-line unit, could fill one of those vacant spots.

That move will make way for development of the new fast-food restaurant, which proved to be a sticking point for some local residents when Crosland Southeast, then just Crosland, started looking for support from nearby communities last year.

Those neighbors formed the Park/Quail Neighborhood Coalition, a group of residents who pushed city council to block the project over fears the restaurant and added traffic would create a risk for students walking from nearby South Mecklenburg High School and Quail Hollow Middle School for a quick, cheap meal. Leaders of the neighborhood group acknowledged they liked all the other changes Crosland planned and even had some suggestions for additions for the center. Still, they would not support a fast-food restaurant.

In the end, council members said Crosland leaders had done enough to accommodate residents’ concerns and approved the project in late April.

“We’ve got a neighborhood shopping center that’s been there since 1982 … that by all accounts is in disrepair, has empty storefronts, traffic does not flow in it well,” Councilman Andy Dulin, who represents the area, said when voting to approve the project. “It’s still a used neighborhood shopping center. It’s a shopping center that neighbors are proud of, and yet paint’s falling off of it, the parking lot’s no good, it’s just not a nice place to go shop and spend money. You’ve got neighbors that would like to have a nicer shopping center, and there’s a big contention on how to get there.”

CNL Crosland is negotiating with restaurants and others to fill the empty space left in the center, according to a news release. And the developers say they plan to hold a focus group meeting, possibly in December, to get more feedback on what locals want to see done with the center.

Great news–thank you for the details. I’m hoping the fast-food restaurant will be Chick-fil-A!
