Method for southern fried chicken

1. In a large bowl, whisk in buttermilk, salt and curry powder until the salt dissolves. Coat the chicken in the mixture and cover for 1 hour (do not let the chicken soak longer than an hour or it will become salty).

8. Transfer the chicken to a paper towel lined plate to drain for 5 minutes. Place on a wire rack over a baking sheet in the oven to keep warm.

9. Add additional oil to the pot as needed. Return the oil to 375°F/190°C and complete the remaining chicken.

10. Serve with the Creole sauce.

Ingredients

• ¼ cup (125 ml) heavy cream

 Buffalo chicken potato salad 
 Posted July 3, 2012–9:17 am in: Sauces 
(NC)—Choosing local vegetables is not only a great way to eat healthy but it’s also fun for the whole family. For this recipe visit your favourite farmer’s market to find the seasonal potatoes, red onions and cucumber.

Buffalo Chicken Potato Salad

 Serves: 6

 Prep Time: 15 minutes

 Cooking Time: 10 minutes

Ingredients

1 pound red potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces

700 mL (3 cups) cooked chicken, cut into bite-size pieces (about 3 cups)

230 mL (1 cup) peeled and chopped cucumber

120 mL (1/2 cup) Hellmann’s Real Mayonnaise

120 mL (1/2 cup) chopped red onion

120 ml (1/2 cup) chopped celery

35 mL (2 1/2 tbsp) cayenne pepper sauce

30 mL (2 tbsp) crumbled blue cheese

Instructions:

Cover potatoes with water in a 3-litre saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool slightly.

Toss potatoes with remaining ingredients in serving bowl. Sprinkle with blue cheese. Serve chilled or at room temperature and, if desired, on a bed of lettuce, garnished with celery leaves.

Did you know?

Mayonnaise is a great substitute for traditional cooking oils since it locks in flavour and moisture, giving you juicy, tasty chicken breasts with the added benefit of omega-3, a polyunsaturated fat. Since Canada’s Food Guide recommends eating a small amount (30-45 mL or 2-3 tbsp) of unsaturated fat each day, mayonnaise is a great ingredient to add to your dish or meal.

And for young entrepreneurs looking for a few successful sales, a winning recipe never hurts. That’s why the test kitchen at Canadian Living has developed this convenient, fresh take on traditional lemonade.

 5 Easy Ways to Cut Back on Sodium 
 Posted March 29, 2012–10:28 am in: Nutrition 
(NC)—Eating too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. The bad news is, most of us are eating more than double the amount of sodium we need. The good news is, you can change that.

Take a look at these five tips from Registered Dietitian Sue Mah to improve your eating habits and your health:

 1. Eat more vegetables and fruit . Not only are they packed with nutrition, they are also sodium-free. Frozen and canned produce are good, economical options too as long as you buy the ones with no added salt or sauces. You can also rinse canned vegetables to wash away some of the sodium. Aim for 7-10 servings of vegetables and fruit every day. Are you getting enough? To assist with your efforts, a leading juice brand offers incentives for you to track your fruit and vegetable servings online at www.facebook.com/mottsgardencocktail.

 2. Look for “sodium reduced” products . Read food labels and look for the words “sodium reduced,” “low sodium” and “sodium free.” Many foods have been reformulated with a lower sodium content. In the juice section, for example, the new Mott’s Garden Cocktail Original contains 35% less sodium than it did before, and the “low sodium” line has reduced it by another 65%.

 3. Compare food labels . Pick up your favourite brand of crackers, bread or soup. Now pick up another brand. Compare the sodium content in the different brands. Buy the ones with the lowest amounts of sodium.

 4. Cook from scratch . This practice allows you to control the amount of sodium and salt in your meals. Be creative and experiment with different ways to add flavour without the sodium. Try herbs, spices, ginger, garlic, flavoured vinegars and citrus juices.

 5. Eat out on special occasions . It’s easy for the sodium to add up when you eat out. Ask for sauces, salad dressings and condiments to be served on the side. Ask for your meal to be made without salt or monosodium glutamate (MSG).

 You win when you up the vegetable ante 
 Posted March 26, 2012–8:42 am in: Nutrition 
(NC)—It’s not always easy to make sure our meals include the recommended number of vegetable servings on a daily basis. Here are a few simple tips from professional Chef Jérôme Ferrer that will help you add veggies to your diet when meal planning:

 Keep the water left over from cooking your vegetables to make broths or to add to your soups and sauces. The simplest way, and certainly the easiest, is to make a beautiful green salad. A drizzle of olive oil and a few drops of balsamic vinegar and voilà: it’s fully dressed. Add a few cherry tomatoes for colour and to increase your vegetable value even more. Fill half your plate with vegetables at lunch and dinner. This practice will make counting your vegetable servings so much easier. Count your servings. Sometimes you may not be aware of how you’re tracking. To assist with tallying, a leading juice brand offers incentives for you to track your fruit and vegetable servings online at www.facebook.com/mottsgardencocktail . If you’re short on time, try using frozen vegetables. Freezing immediately after harvesting preserves their vitamins and essential minerals. They’re the perfect solution for busy weeknights. When you’re on-the-go, take single-serve juice along. Read the labels when shopping for nutrition information. The single-serve Mott’s Garden Cocktail Original, for example, is 100% vegetable juice with 35% less sodium. It gives you two full servings of vegetables in every 250 mL serving. If you crave a little nibble before a meal, snack on a few raw crunchy veggies with your favourite dip. 

Canada’s Food Guide recommends adults between the ages of 19 and 50 should get seven to 10 servings of vegetables and fruit every day. Do it to up the ante for a healthier you.

 ActiFry Recipes from T-Fal 
 Posted January 2, 2012–1:06 pm in: Low Fat , Main Dish 
Lower in fat than regular fries, these Tex-Mex fries are a healthier option
 
(NC)— Now, you can eat healthy and have your fries too. Innovations today allow us to make all those favourite high calorie and high fat foods with only 1 tablespoon of oil. The product developers at T-fal have created innovative appliances for healthier living that decrease the average fat intake of pub-style meals by as much as 70%. Here are some recipes using the new ActiFry :

Tex-Mex Fries

Ingredients:

3 lb (1.5kg) of potatoes, peeled and washed

1 tbsp of vegetable oil

2 tbsp of Tex-mex or fajitas spice mix

2 tbsp of tabasco sauce to taste

Salt to taste

Directions:

1. Cut the potatoes into ½ inch (1 cm) thick fries, wash well and dry carefully.

2. Mix the Tex-Mex powder with the vegetable oil in a small bowl. Put the fries in the ActiFry pan and pour the spice mixture evenly over them. Cook for 45 minutes.

3. Open the Actifry, add salt and pour the Tabasco over the fries. Cook for another 10 minutes.

Recipe serves 6. Nutritional information per serving: 199 cal, protein: 5.3g, fat: 2.5g, carbohydrate: 41.5g, sodium: 0.04g. Compare: regular fries can have more than 380 calories and more than 20 g of fat per serving. 

BBQ Chicken wings

Ingredients:

1 lb chicken or more chicken wings, tips cut offSea salt&amp;ground pepper

Directions:

Toss the wings in barbecue sauce enough to coat them. This can be done the night before so the meat absorbs some of the sauce. Set the ActiFry for 25 minutes and turn on (*check for doneness after 20 minutes, depending on the size of the wings).

 Note: Fried pub chicken wings can have more than 1500 cal and more than 100 g of fat for only 10 wings, more than an entire day worth of calories. Cooking wings in this new appliance makes this snack a healthier treat on game day or family night. 

Chinese Style Ribs

Ingredients:

1 rack of pork spare ribs

1/3 tsp baking soda, 1tbs water, 1/2 tsp salt, 1tsp sugar, 1tbs soya sauce, 1tbs cornstarch, -1/4tsp sesame seed oil, 1tbs minced garlic, 1tsp five spice powder (optional)

Preparation:

1. Cut ribs into single rib sections and place in a bowl.

2. In a small bowl mix together the rest of the ingredients and add to ribs, mix well to coat the ribs evenly.

3. Marinate for a least 1 hour. Add ribs to the ActiFry and cook for 25-30 min. (depending on how meaty the ribs are)

Pulled Pork Sandwich in minutes
 
Succulant pulled pork in less than half an hour.
 
The newest Nutricook appliance (by T-fal) can save hours of preparation for pulled pork. You can make this tasty dish in less than a half hour:

Ingredients:

4 tsp of olive oil

1 shallot finely chopped

1 clove garlic, minced

1 (500 g) pork tenderloin, trimmed

1 bottle of your favourite barbecue sauce

6 whole wheat buns

Preparation:

1. Coat the pork tenderloin evenly with the barbecue sauce.

2. Heat the olive oil in the Nutricook pan and brown the pork on all sides.

3. Take the pork out and rinse the pan. Place the pork in the steaming basket.

4. Put the basket with the pork loin in the pan.

5. Program 18 minutes on the timer and select the meat cooking program.

6. After 18 minutes steam will appear, at which point you need to turn off the heat and turn the program selector to steam.

7. Set the steam program for 10 minutes. This is the soft steam that makes sure the meat is cooked inside on the inside as well as the outside.

8. After the end of the soft steam phase, take out the pork at which point it should peel apart easily.

9. Lightly toast your whole-wheat bun, add your pork and any other desired condiments.

 Polpette di Fungi 
 Posted October 13, 2011–6:14 am in: Vegetable 
2 eggs

1 teaspoon baking soda

50g freshly grated Parmesan

50g Panko breadcrumbs, plus extra for rolling

1/4 cup chopped plain parsley

1/2 cup finely diced fresh mushrooms (crimini, button, whatever you like)

Pinch sea salt

Freshly ground black pepper

Olive oil for frying

One jar (about 700mls) of your favourite pasta sauce

Method

1. Beat the eggs and the baking soda with a whisk.

2. Slowly add the cheese, the breadcrumbs, the parsley and mushrooms to the egg mix. Season with sea salt and pepper and fold gently until all ingredients are combined.

3. Using a teaspoon form small balls of the mixture, then roll them in the extra Panko crumbs.

4. Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the egg balls 2-3 at a time and fry over medium heat until golden brown all round. You will need to turn them to make sure they brown evenly.

5. Drain on a paper towel and continue until all balls are fried up.

6. Heat your pasta sauce over medium heat and then add the balls when the sauce is bubbling. Turn the heat down to low and partially cover the saucepan. Continue to heat for about 7 minutes - the balls will be warm through and will have absorbed some of the sauce.

7. Serve topped with fresh basil.

 Working class diner 
 Posted October 6, 2011–6:13 am in: Resources 
 

(NC)—Dining in the workplace is often reduced to a quick inhalation of a soggy sandwich at the desk. Hunched over, many conclude lunch hour within minutes. Some meals are shortened, while others are eliminated altogether.

“When you eat less often, it does not mean you are eating healthier,” says Carol Dombrow, Heart and Stroke Foundation registered dietitian. “Check the nutrition information and pay attention to serving sizes to help you make healthy choices.”

The fast paced office environment oftentimes places food in the sidebar of the day, more as an afterthought than the main act. One-quarter of Canadians report visiting a fast food restaurant on a daily basis to save precious minutes of their days.

As Carol explains, Canada’s Food Guide is a great tool for following a healthy diet—at home or at work.

To keep up with an active and healthy lifestyle at work, Carol suggests following these tips:

• Have breakfast. Coffee alone does not constitute breakfast. Remember that it is the most important meal of the day. People who eat breakfast are more likely to meet their daily nutrient needs and maintain a healthy body weight. Aim to include three food groups, e.g., whole grain cereal, milk and orange wedges or a poached egg on whole grain toast and sliced tomatoes.

• Have healthy snacks on hand for your morning or afternoon breaks.

• Change your midday coffee break to a juice or fresh fruit break. If you choose juice, make it 100% fruit juice.

• Prepare healthy lunches at home so you are not faced with an empty lunch bag, an empty stomach and the temptation to pop out for a convenient burger and fries as a quick fix lunch.

• Bring a bag of baby spinach leaves, peppers, carrots and other veggies and leave them in the fridge at work, so you can prepare fresh salads at lunch.

• Bring fruits and veggies to work to snack on during the day.

• Make your lunch hour a sit down occasion and enjoy every bite.

More tips and ideas on planning healthy snacks while on the run are available online at healthcheck.org or you can download the Health Check Recipe Helper app. The free app—available in English or French—can be downloaded at the Apple, Android, and BlackBerry app stores or at www.heartandstroke.ca/mobileapps.
