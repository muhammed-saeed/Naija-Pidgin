 Read all about the Hangman Corporation. 
   
   

We have spent years designing Houston restaurants, bars and other foodservice facilities.
 
Don’t hang yourself designing your commercial kitchen!
Call Hangman Professional Kitchen Outfitters before you risk it all.

 Hangman Professional Kitchen Outfitters knows the details of design down to the letter. Since 1980, as premier foodservice consultants we’ve dedicated ourselves to providing the best in commercial kitchen design, and being the leader in Houston restaurant equipment supply, restaurant and lounge furniture, bar equipment and design, nightclub equipment and design, smallwares and tabletop products. If you need to design a restaurant floor plan or just upgrade your existing kitchen, we can eliminate all the guesswork with our restaurant kitchen design software.



Allow our restaurant kitchen planning design guides to customize a dynamic restaurant kitchen design spanning everything from fine dining establishments to quick-serve fast food restaurants. Choose the industry’s best restaurant equipment available from our diverse line of equipment manufacturers, and allow our experienced professionals to install all of your equipment and handle your restaurant ventilation and commercial refrigeration needs.


No project is too small for Hangman. While we can build a kitchen from scratch, we are just as happy installing appliances and other equipment in addition to replacing existing furniture and smallwares.
