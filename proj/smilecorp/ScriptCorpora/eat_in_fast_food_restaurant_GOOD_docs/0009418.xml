 Madden NFL 11

by Ian Cummings 12/10/10 10:12 AM


Hello Madden fans, we are happy to announce the release of our fifth (and likely final) title update for Madden NFL 11, just in time for the holidays. The fixes listed below represent a culmination of all the feedback received from you, the fans, in our loyal community. We&apos;d like to thank you for the continued support and strong attention to detail, as well as, your willingness to contribute in always trying to make Madden NFL a better game. This title update focuses on primarily fixing online exploits and fine-tuning the balance of gameplay by making numerous improvements to defensive AI.

Will we ever get to see Randy Moss do this celebration in Tennessee?
The fixes are as follows:
•Fixed an exploit to disallow defenders from all blitzing when the quarterback tried to pump fake when facing the wrong direction. This was discovered in NCAA Football 11 and fixed in both titles.
•Fixed an exploit where unscrupulous players could get their fullback or tight end to move across the line of scrimmage and cause an encroachment penalty against an unsuspecting defensive player.
•Fixed an exploit where online gamers could use specific timing in pulling the network plug and cause a soft lock for both users, thus not having to face a loss. We&apos;ve isolated and fixed the problem, so now if someone pulls their plug, they rightfully get a loss.
•Improved reaction times for defenders in coverage to better react to receivers
•Improved logic to get defenders in better position to make plays on the ball while in the air
•Improved defensive play recognition to get defenders reacting to the play faster
•Tuned up defensive pursuit to get defenders to take smarter angles to the ball carrier
•Tuned up defensive gap aggressiveness to get defenders into the hole faster
•Fixed an issue where the play art on defense would sometimes not show up correctly when showing blitz. We have corrected this problem in thirteen formations so now all proper play art will be displayed when showing blitz to the offense.

We hope these changes find you well and give you yet another reason to keep Madden NFL 11 in your disc tray throughout this NFL season. Enjoy the playoffs!

  12-13-2010, 03:58 PM away - #10 # 58 i think the update goes live tomorrow on the 14th

and madden has become a !!ing joke ever since making it to these&quot;next generation&quot;consoles


i was a 2k fan...but i still bought madden because i still thought it was a decent game plus most of my friends played madden


but i just had visioned madden on ps3 to be mind-blowing...like not even being able to tell the difference from reality to virtual reality...it&apos;s probably been one of the biggest disappointments in gaming

knowing that developers like naughty dog can make some epic !! like uncharted with those type of visuals and gameplay...but then you think ea tiburon could reproduce the same kind of quality game...however, we just get a somewhat better looking version of ps2 graphics on the ps3 but still get the !!ty gameplay...which is the bigger slap on the face to me...ps2 gameplay and ps3 graphics does not equal to what i expected


don&apos;t mind my rant....i&apos;m bored as !! right now Last edited by # 58; 12-13-2010 at 04:01 PM .. 
 
 
 
  12-13-2010, 04:26 PM away - #11 jhj26 I told y&apos;all not to get madden 11. Even the developers kinda told you not to get it when they said they wouldn&apos;t touch franchise mode until madden &apos;12. They also said there would be no changes to online franchise...nothing but red flags since last march.

The truth is that they have been working on Madden &apos;12 for 2 years, madden &apos;11 was just a&quot;filler&quot;. 
 
 
 
  12-13-2010, 04:47 PM away - #12 Mysteryman I dunno why its so hard to make a good NFL game


NCAA !!s on madden gameplay wise

All they need to do is take NCAA gameplay and add NFL names, teams, players, etc. 
 
 
 
  12-13-2010, 05:15 PM away - #13 kwmvp12 They need to put an illegal hit button. Now that&apos;d be raw

But its THE ONLY NFL GAME AVAILABLE BECAUSE EA JUST HAD TO PAY OUT TO[..] THE LICENSE INSTEAD OF BEING IN COMPETITION WITH 2K WHICH THEY CONSTANTLY LOST. 
 

cant wait for another developer to make a NFL game, at this point.. I dont care who makes it... as long as it isnt EA....
