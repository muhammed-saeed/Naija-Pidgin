A Letter to Military Children from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Kids who grow up in military familes face their own unique challenges. It&apos;s hard to make lasting friendships when orders to new duty stations arrive with just a few weeks warning. Military parents can be gone for weeks or months . . . or years at a time. But families are important and it&apos;s nice to see children given special tribute from General Pace.

 I want to take this opportunity to recognize the extraordinary 
contributions of our Nation&apos;s military families, who have faced
many challenges-from family separations to frequent moves-with
great courage. I would especially like to acknowledge a special 
source of inspiration: children of military families.

You are patient and understanding when duty calls and your Mom or 
Dad cannot attend a soccer game, music recital, birthday party, 
or other important family or school activity. You are heroes in 
a quiet, thoughtful way, and I am grateful for the unconditional 
love you give your Mom and Dad. Many of you have experienced the 
sad and sometimes frightening experience of having your Mom or 
Dad far from home, serving around the globe in places like Iraq 
and Afghanistan. Through your personal courage and support, you 
serve this Nation too - and I am proud of you!

Frequent moves are a way of life for the military child. It is 
never easy to say goodbye to friends and familiar routines, to 
begin again in a new school, a new neighborhood - and sometimes 
a new country! But your resilience and self-confidence are 
strengths that others admire, including your parents.

Growing up in a military family offers some challenges, but it 
also provides some special rewards. You can be proud of your Mom 
and Dad for their brave defense of this great country. Your love 
and support sustains them. So thank you for being there for Mom 
and Dad. You are American patriots and role models for us all. 

PETER PACE

General, United States Marine Corps

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

3rd LAR Delta Company Update
 Photo by 1st Lt. Nathan Braden Before they moved to the Syrian border, the Dragoons participated in a cordon and search operation near the Thar Thar Dam. Here, Sgt. Joseph L. Massey (left), a 26-year-old scout squad leader from Shelbyville, Ky. and Lance Cpl. Nathan D. Wagner (right), a 22-year-old scout from Fruitland, Idaho fill out detention processing forms. 

The 3rd LAR has landed and this latest update from the Delta company commander is a fascinating glimpse of what it takes to deploy a battalion of Marines:

 Dear friends and family of Delta Company &quot;Dragoons,&quot;

I am writing our first e-mail status report later than I had hoped because of an extremely busy schedule as of late. Let me begin by saying how proud I am of our Marines and their hard work up to this point. Including work-ups, pre-deployment ranges and classes and loads of field ops and vehicle maintenance, this has been a grueling period for everyone, one I am sure they will never forget. However, I am convinced their hard work and strong efforts will help us complete the missions we&apos;ve been assigned and guard our troops against a difficult enemy.

First let me tell you at the writing of this e-mail, we have kept everyone safe, there are no injuries or illnesses. The Marines are smelly and tired after being in the field twenty days, but morale is good. My e-mails are checked, so I will not speak of any combat related issues unless allowed to in this or future e-mailings. I will let the Marines tell you about those items when we get home.

After our departure from 29 Palms MCAGCC we drove to March AFB. The USO had a great set-up for us with breakfast including coffee, juice and snacks. The volunteers were mostly veterans of previous wars who wanted to wish the troops a goodbye. Older men and women, they greeted our Marines with smiles and stories of &quot;shipping out&quot; for Americas previous wars. We were all flattered by their honest patriotism and dedication to the troops. After a few hours wait, we took off with World Air, a charter company that primarily flys for the military. They had flight attendants and played movie after movie to keep the Marines entertained. They seemed to be happy to make us comfortable, and 1stSgt Ward reminded me a round trip flight to Europe would usually cost us over $1,500, but this one was free. We landed in Bangor Maine first, and after a brief turn-around flew across the Atlantic to Shannon, Ireland. Many of the new Marines remarked that this was their first trip across any ocean, and were motivated by the trip. The Marines mostly slept on the flight. We were not allowed out of the airport in Ireland, but the Marines all seemed to enjoy the countryside through the windows. The Shannon airport is surrounded by lush green countryside, there was a sense that it had rained recently. Adjacent to the airport was also a golf course, and though it was the middle of the day, there were a few stalwart older gentlemen out on the links. We were not allowed to drink, but on our return trip I will waive that rule. The Irish folks waiting in the airport seemed confused by all the men in uniform, but some seemed happy to talk to the Marines and wish them luck. Most of the Marines took the opportunity to charge their video games in the airport outlets and get a meal paid for by the airlines in lieu of airplane food. No Irish food, but sandwiches, chips and sodas.

Our landing in Kuwait wasn&apos;t nearly as warm a welcome. It was the middle of the night, and you can imagine the stacks of cargo, lines of vehicles and crates, and tight security. Having been on two deployments to Kuwait, I can assure you we weren&apos;t missing much, the area around the airport is not very interesting. After a few hours, we met up with our seabags and were bussed to Camp Victory. A small camp used for transients awaiting transport in and out of Iraq. I met up with one of my former Marines, now a Master Gunnery Sergeant, and one of my former bosses, now a Lieutenant Colonel and they explained some of the recent goings on and current operations in Iraq. This is a busy place, to say the least.

Once our flights had been arranged we took a C-130 to Al Assad. Also a night flight, it lasted just over an hour. The Al Assad base was huge and sprawling, but had not received a mortar attack for more than six months. They had a PX and small fast food restaurants including a Pizzia Hut and Burger King. It&apos;s going to be hard to keep our Marines fit if they keep feeding us this way. Living conditions were tight, to say the least. Billeting is always a problem when moving around, especially with many other units coming and going also. We officially detached 3rd Platoon back to our Battalion for further tasking in Korean Village (KV as it&apos;s called). Lt. Niznik and SSgt Arbuthnot have them well at hand attached to Alpha Company for missions in Rutbah in the Western province. We were taught a few classes by the Regimental Gunner on current Rules of Engagement and the importance of picking our fights wisely. We do not wish to hurt innocent civilians over here.

The Company boarded CH-53 Marine helicopters for our next link. Our destination was Al Quaim, a place very familiar to those in the Company who had been here before. For the newcomers, this was their first Helo ride, and it was eventful. The flight was amazing, and we passed through terrain that looked as ancient as its history. Our helo&apos;s flew low and fast over the landscape, and we passed over rolling deserts with sand dunes and rocky outcroppings. Much of the infrastructure, at least from the air, seemed intact, with damage to powerlines and some buildings. As we passed over the Euphrates river, a mass of green seemed to cling to its banks, and shrouded in the trees and high reeds we could see ancient palaces and small towns. Minarets, Mosques and arabesque portals and doorways were clearly visible outside the gunners bubble on the CH-53. It was easy to envision the hanging gardens of Babylon and the cities that used to make up the silk trade routes between Europe and Asia. Haditha Lake was the most unusual thing to see in a veritable sea of sand. An enormous body of water, there were islands of rock and green reeds. Storks or cranes flew low over the surface in the direction of our helos giving it a Discovery Channel, nature show appeal. The pilots and aircrew were uncommunicative, having ferried countless troops North, and my usual attempt to sit in the jump seat and listen to the pilots communicate with ground stations and other aircraft was sternly rebuked by the crew chief. The wing was all about business here, and wasn&apos;t interested in entertaining us grunts.

Our landing in Al Quaim was dramatic and like something from an old war movie. I&apos;ve landed in many bases around the world, but this one was unique. The base at Al Quaim is inside an old Rail yard. With signs still hanging over the massive railcar bays proclaiming &quot;Royal Iraqi Railways.&quot; There were lines and lines of rail car and engines. Some seemed to still have cargo onboard, all appeared to be suspended, waiting for an engineer. Many had been stripped or blown up, but there are plans in place to get the railways back up and running within the next three months. An amazing feat in this war torn country. The first of many surprises in what used to be the hostile North West portion of Iraq. The base had HESCO barricades, a kind of foldable metal mesh that can be filled with sand and rock to make an eight foot tall walls to keep out terrorists. It was ringed with guard towers and cammie netting, and razor wire, helos landed and touched off regularly. We saw sweaty, dirty Marines with their gear and sea bags lining up, waiting for us to unload so they could get onboard and head back to the States. They practically pushed us out of the way, I am sure we will feel the same way in another six months. We had an opportunity to see some detainees. Wiry, black hair, tanned arms and faces, these were our enemy, at least the ones we&apos;d gotten. They didn&apos;t look very threatening, and most of our Marines towered over them in size, stature and military bearing. Nothing is more convincing to me that we can win the war with just a handful more Devil Dogs. These people are ineffective against our rugged Marines unless they hide, cowardly, behind their IEDs, mortars and snipers.

Many experienced their first dust storm. Much similar to the ones others had seen or I had experienced in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, they were enough to blast the enamel off our teeth. The temperature wasn&apos;t too hot yet, and along the Euphrates it&apos;s cold at night dropping to mid forties. The days are in the eighties, and increasing in temperature as we get closer to summer. We officially detached from 3d LAR and attached to Regimental Combat Team-7. Commanded by Lt. Col. Marano, we were welcomed and billeted in SWA huts (South West Asia). This was the last spot for Marines to use phones and send e-mail. We had ordered enough sets of E-SAPI plates and side SAPI plates for everyone. This is the newest generation IV and V armor your Marines will wear. The latest in Marine gear, it defeats some of the biggest enemy weapons when properly worn. The side SAPI plates protect our Marines from their vulnerable flanks. We also convinced the supply Sergeant to issue all Marines a pair of fire retardant gloves, called NOMEX and a hood made of the same material. This can really save the Marines trouble in the event of a fire on the vehicle. All this gear is, of course, heavy, cumbersome, and will be extremely hot, so I am ensuring our Docs keep a close eye on our Marines to ensure they are drinking enough water when the weather turns. This also marked the beginning of our operational phase, we were no longer in transit, being guided from airport to airport. From here on out we had our feet planted firmly on the earth as with generations of grunts before us. We are, however, mounted like the cavalry, and thereby just a little better than the average grunt. Smarter, faster, and better armed and armored. Our motto, &quot;Dragoon,&quot; is defined as a mounted warrior who dismounts for battle. We have definitely earned that title here, as I will describe later, driving across half of Iraq.

We boarded up in armored trucks and moved up North across the Euphrates. We passed IED holes and spent brass casings on our way to &quot;Memphis bridge.&quot; Crossing through the various companies zones, we saw a profusion of construction. New schools, mosques, houses; the people up North are rebuilding with a fury. Once on the other side of the river, we were greeted with a huge surprise, especially for the old timers. Children sprang out of houses and waved and jumped up and down with huge smiles. Moms held their little ones up to see us passing, and all greeted us with warm and happy faces. There were many farms irrigated by the Euphrates, green and producing. Cattle and donkeys helped the farmers trim their crops, and farmers stopped their days work to wave as we passed. Children in schools ran to the balconies and waved at us, laughing and smiling. We were caught off guard by the &quot;atmospherics.&quot; A new term in the working lexicon of the U.S. Marines, the term &quot;atmospherics&quot; is used all the time to explain how the locals view us. You&apos;ll hear an NCO talking to a new NCO saying &quot;The atmospherics at Tinian were great, kids were smiling and waiving.&quot; We passed Iraqi Army soldiers standing post at check points. Their uniforms were clean and clearly marked, they wore sunglasses, and stood proudly. The Iraqi flag waived atop all their positions. They waved nonchalantly as we passed. We were shocked, expecting something more like the news had shown, with sporadic small arms fire and IED&apos;s detonating daily. That is a reality in other parts of Iraq as we would find out later. Here, there was peace and rebuilding that astonished most of us.

We were assigned a battlespace, to be renamed AO Dragoon (AO is Area of Operations) for our arrival. Owned by Weapons Company (Warlord) of 1st LAR (the Highlanders) from Camp Pendleton, for the previous four months. We didn&apos;t know it, but we wouldn&apos;t be here more than eleven days before being ordered elsewhere, but for now it seemed livable. There were battlepositions in our sector named for famous Marine battles, we were honored by our new mission and took stock of our situation. My opposite from 1st LAR filled us in on the mission. The Marines in his company had been working tirelessly to get connected with the locals. We were driven to the houses of all the local sheiks and they offered chai tea and discussed their problems and issues. Most had projects ongoing in their areas, from new pumphouses for irrigation to water purifiers for drinking water. Unfortunately, there are no restrictions on Syria so they dump pollutants in the water and it rolls down river into Iraq carrying disease and industrial waste. The Euphrates in AO Dragoon had tested positive for intestinal worms, chicken pox just to mention a few. I hoped the Sheiks had boiled their water well enough before serving their tea, but custom prevented me turning down their sweet-tea mixture. After we finished with the Sheiks we drove to each of the battlepositions. I had attached to my command a platoon of thirty Marines from 1st Battalion, 7th Marines. They were eager, as were we all, to get to work improving our battle positions.

Our HQ battle position was shared with the Iraqi Army, much to everyone&apos;s surprise. The partnership included an Iraqi Army Lt. Col. named Lt. Col. Najim. He and his troops would be partnered with mine in all things, and he was technically under my command. Every patrol was 50% American and 50% Iraqi. We were amazed. Could the system be working? We found the Iraqi Army soldiers to have varying levels of proficiency (one platoon was weak), with most fully capable of holding their own. The Marine Corps was definitely the enforcing power behind them, but they were professional and dedicated. It was unusual to have a HQ with an American flag on one side and our former enemies&apos; flag on the other. I met and surveyed their troops and had a late night dinner with Lt. Colonel Najim. We discussed his plans and how we would continue the good partnership established by Highlander, 1st LAR. He asked for nothing and explained that he was very happy with the progress. He said he looked forward to a time when Americans were no longer needed, but not in a derisive manner. He said he looked more forward to when his troops were not needed to garrison the countryside, and could get to work defending their country against the Syrians and Iranians. He seemed authentically angry that they would threaten his homelands borders. He was gracious for the efforts Americans had expended to benefit his land, and looked forward to happier times with his family.

We moved into our living quarters after an exhausting day. Wooded bunks inside sandbagged bunkers were the living arrangements. The food consisted mainly of Tray-Rations, called T-rats or Tray-rats by the Marines. They come in a tin heated in a steam heater and served with canned fruit and vegetables. They always reminded me of school lunches, nutritious, flavorful, but not something Grandma would save in her recipe book. These were augmented by a huge stock pile of &quot;extras&quot; the Highlander Company Gunney had been hoarding. It consisted of Gatorades, muffins, granola bars, cokes and non-alcoholic beer, etc. There was a gym with weights and some cardio machines and a T.V. that wasn&apos;t working, but had DVD movies playing for the Marines.

It was here we finally accepted our vehicles. They were dirty and used, but we were glad to be Dragoons again. We accepted them, and the XO, company Gunney and Platoon Commanders Platoon Sergeants and I worked through the inventories to see what was broken missing or damaged. We assigned watch rotations for the Marines and began our &quot;joint&quot; patrolling and guarding post with the Iraqi Army and some of the men from Highlander. There was still enemy activity up here, but not as frequent as other places in Iraq. An occasional IED, and some &quot;small arms fire,&quot; abbreviated in my reports as SAF. But during our ten days here we experienced little of it. The next few days we patrolled the area with our Iraqi counterparts, toured new schools, new water treatment facilities, and planned the way ahead for our Company. There was a lot of rebuilding, and Marines were the center of the construction projects. I felt more like a civil affairs officer than a ground combat commander, but if this was the new face of Iraq we were happy to have the Marines safe, and to be doing something that was useful and democratizing the people.

Nothing solidified in my mind the amazing result of all our hard work in this zone than our meting with all the Sheiks of Al Quaim. There were twenty head Sheiks. Three from AO Dragoon, and seventeen from around the area. They sat with the Colonel in charge of the Army, and the new head of police (no permanent police had arrived, that&apos;s why the Army did many things consistent with policing duties). After about an hour of arguing and deep discussions I stopped my translator mid-sentence and went out to get some of my Marines. I briefed them that inside was a Sheiks meeting, and I was astounded by what I considered &quot;Democracy in action,&quot; in its truest form. Leaders meeting to discuss the sewage, or electricity in their areas. Leaders meeting to make life better for their families and that of their communities. Leaders sitting opposite the military and police officials, unafraid of them, and willing to tell the Iraqi troops and police what to do to better support the people. The Marines and I were impressed. Two of them, Cpl Casillas and LCpl Rodriguez, had been here last year and remember Al Quaim (abbreviated AQ). They remember suicide bombers, nightly mortars, and a people angry at the imposition of a foreign army who they considered invaders. No longer. The Marines stood in the background and let them argue and discuss, much akin to a town council meeting back in the States. I was struck by their honesty with their issues, they still seemed greedy to have their sewage repaired before their neighboring county, they still seemed motivated to get contracts signed for new schools in their district first, but what American politician isn&apos;t doing the same thing for their constituency. If we can do the same thing in the rest of Iraq, this place will be buying Levis and opening McDonalds before five years are up. I saw no reason why, at least this portion of Iraq, could not be turned over to the Iraqis within the next four months.

Our new peaceful side of the war was to change as we accepted new instructions. After ten days we were ordered to pack up everything we could carry and commit to the drive to Korean Village (abbreviated KV) in the Western Midlands of Iraq, on the Syrian border. This was the Headquarters of our faithful Battalion, the Wolfpack. A wide expanse of land called AO DENVER and AO WOLFPACK. We packed our gear and drove across the Euphrates for an evenings wait at the rail yard. Waiving goodbye to the kids and mothers as we passed the fertile farmlands one last time. The next morning we began the six hour long drive to KV. Our trip was uneventful. 

For parents of deployed Marines, hearing the landing and first few days described as &quot;uneventful&quot; is a very good thing. Best of luck to the 3rd LAR as they begin their tour of duty.

The bias of our media elite
Embedded journalist Franklin Raff was asked the following question by an Iraqi Army officer of high rank:


 &quot;Why do you people not tell our story? Why do you not say what is going on? Why do you come to our country and see what is happening, you see the schools and the hospitals and you see the markets and you eat with Sunni and Shia soldiers - everybody eats together, everybody works together -you see that Saddam is gone forever and we are free to speak and complain.

You see we are working and eating together and fighting together - Sunni and Shia - you see what we are building here, you see the votes we make as one people. Then you say to the world about a great war and horrible things and how we are all killing each other? We are not animals! We are Iraqis. Look around you! Look!&quot; 

 His full reply is here , but the following excerpts reveal much about the truth behind the news presented to us by mainstream media outlets:


 It was hilarious at the time. So funny, in fact, I nearly wept. I will never forget the sight of my colleague, a well-known, market-leading radio reporter feverishly clutching his satellite phone as a Chinook transport helicopter flew by, half a mile or so away. He was standing right beside me as he dialed through the time zones to go &quot;live from Iraq&quot;: We&apos;re right in the middle of the action! I&apos;m sorry ... I can&apos;t hear you! There&apos;s a Blackhawk landing right behind me! I can&apos;t quite describe what&apos;s going on! This is unbelievable! At the time, you see, we were just outside an Embassy chow hall, quietly discussing the weather. We had just eaten a magnificent lunch. In this combat reporter&apos;s trembling right hand was the target of his desperate screams, the satellite phone - his listeners&apos; link to the horror and chaos of war, the sweat and tears, the booming, blood-shod tragedy of it all. And in his left hand - I swear it - a chocolate milkshake. 

So, how do the troops react?


 What bothers them is that when we put pen to paper, we tend to stab them squarely in the back by misrepresenting and over-dramatizing our experiences. It is no wonder a &quot;PRESS&quot; tag will get you a few hairy eyeballs in the field: There&apos;s a general consensus that we are liars. 


And, just as important, how do these news reports set with Iraqis?


 Non-English speaking Iraqis are distressed and disheartened by American media bias. Many feel personally offended by what they read in translation and hear of in the foreign press. 


 Do read the entire article. Raff&apos;s observations are consistent with what I hear from our troops - things are getting better, but you wouldn&apos;t believe it from front page stories and news reports from reporters who know better. We need more voices like his.

Welcome home, Marine. You&apos;re on our list
Earlier this week, 26 Marines arrived home from eight months in Iraq. When they arrived at LAX, Northwest airlines allowed 25 of them to board their connecting flight to Minneapolis St.Paul airport.

SSgt. Daniel Brown was informed that he was on a terrorist watch list and denied boarding. Never mind that he had spent the last eight months fighting the real thing. Never mind that this was his second deployment. His name appeared on a TSA list and he was grounded.

 From the St. Paul Pioneer Press :


 Everything seemed normal when Brown, 32, of Coon Rapids, and the other Marines, all wearing their uniforms, gathered at the Northwest Airlines counter in Los Angeles Tuesday morning. The unit had served in Al-Anbar province of Iraq, known as the dangerous Sunni Triangle. But when Brown tried to check in, there was a problem.

 &quot;I was told it was going to take some time because they informed me I was on a government watch list,&quot; Brown said. &quot;People at the Northwest counter said they had to call somebody to get me cleared.&quot; 

The clearance took time, and Brown missed the flight. He was scheduled to arrive in the Twin Cities at 2:30 p.m. but didn&apos;t get here until 3:45 p.m.

All the Marines thought Brown should have received a better welcome from his country.

 &quot;It didn&apos;t sit well with any of us. I wasn&apos;t the only one upset about it. We all were,&quot; Brown said. 

There&apos;s more. When the first 25 Marines arrived in Minnesota, they knew their familes were just a few miles away - families they hadn&apos;t seen for eight months. They also knew that SSgt Brown was on his way.

They waited for him.


 &quot;We don&apos;t leave anybody behind,&quot; 1st Sgt. Drew Benson said. &quot;We start together, and we finish together.&quot; 
Just one more example of the esprit de corps that makes the USMC unique among our fighting forces

1/7 Marines arrive on the Syrian border
1/7 Marines have landed in Iraq and are settling in for seven months on the Syrian border. First reports are encouraging according to my Marine son who called this afternoon - no IEDs when they toured the town in their LAVs. It&apos;s all good.

LtCol Marano, Battalion Commander sent this letter out to families shortly before they left:


 We, the Marines and Sailors of the First Team, will soon begin our deployment to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom 05-07. I would like to share a few thoughts with you, our family and friends, as we leave home one more time. I am the most fortunate man in the world as I have the honor of serving with the bravest and most capable Marines and Sailors in our Corps - your sons and husbands. We have trained hard for eight months and I can report to you today that we are well-led and ready for what is to come. No two deployments are ever the same, and this one will be different from our last. Much has changed in our Area of Operations, and the situation on the ground has changed considerably since the First Team last patrolled Western Al Anbar Province. For the first time, I am optimistic that we are making a difference and will eventually succeed - and I base that optimism on a cold analysis of the facts on the ground. Large numbers of Iraqi soldiers and police are in place or will soon be. In fact, we have an entire brigade of Iraqi soldiers operating with us, not long ago there were none. We will soon have hundreds of Iraqi police operating with us, not long ago there were none. The platoons and companies of the First Team will conduct joint patrols with these Iraqi security forces; my goal is to start turning urban areas back to Iraqi control during our deployment. None of this will be easy. Training Iraqi security forces to do the job that US Forces currently do will be difficult, plus Iraq remains a violent and dangerous place even on a good day. Your Marines and Sailors, however, are up to the job. This battalion has a proud history, your loved ones will be writing a new chapter of it.

I want all the families to know that you are always in our thoughts and prayers and know that we remain in yours. Despite the frequent separations, you have remained strong and have kept the faith with us, and each other, especially during periods of maximum stress and high anxiety. These deployments are much harder on wives than Marines. You must keep the family going by yourself, taking care of everything from children&apos;s grades to the leaking radiator while wondering and worrying about your husband and your family&apos;s future. Your strength is comforting to us and your support of each other forms the basis of what is a very strong support organization.

I would like to recognize the fine work of the battalion&apos;s Key Volunteers. These ladies have provided us the love and support we need as we embark on this latest deployment. They have worked selflessly to make sure that every family has the information they need and is prepared for the hardships of this deployment. I want to thank each one of you from the bottom of my heart. 


Each platoon will be working directly with an Iraqi Army platoon. By the time 1/7 leaves next fall, these soldiers will have gained invaluable skills from our Marines - the best trained and most revered fighting force in the world.

However, alliances are formed on arenas other than the battlefield. An early request from 1/7 is for baseball gloves, bats, balls, and other gear so that they can introduce their Iraqi brothers to this most American game. (They know they&apos;ll get their butts handed to them on the soccer field but this will help even the score.)

One week down, seven months to go.

Meritorious family
 
Proud Navy Mom, Mary Helen Bartch, sent along this picture of her son, PR3 Adam Bartch, as he was awarded the Joint Service Achievement Medal for his service in Iraq during 2005. Here&apos;s his description of the service:
 hey mom and dad,
well today was a pretty good day. I was awarded the Joint Service Achievement Medal, along with 5 other people, for our mission up in iraq. the certificate read as follows, &quot;the president of the united states, authorized by the 
secretary of defense, has awarded the joint service achievement medal to PR3 adam bartch united states navy from 6NOV2005 - 24NOV2005, Distinguished himself by meritorious achievement in support of operation iraqi freedom. his outstanding dedication to duty during combat operations in iraq contributed to the overwhelming success of the command&apos;s mission. his actions reflect great credit upon himself, multi-national corps iraq, and the united states navy.&quot; signed John Vines, Lieutenant General, Us Army. Pretty cool huh? 

Pretty cool indeed. Congratulations PR3 Bartch - the apple doesn&apos;t fall far from the tree in this family. Adam&apos;s dad, USMC Col. Richard Bartch, received his own share of awards for his service in Iraq. Here he is with the Bronze Star - the nation&apos;s fourth highest award for combat valor - awarded in 2005.

2/7 War Dawgs are coming home
 Photo and story by LCpl Michael S. Cifuentes 

There are no words that can adequately describe the anticipation that grips a waiting crowd of family and friends who are waiting to welcome warriors home from war. LCpl Michael Cifuentes was there yesterday as the advance party from 2/7 returned home to Victory Field at 29 Palms. Here&apos;s his story:


 After seven grueling months of carrying out combat operations in Iraq, more than 40 Marines of the advance party of 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, returned to the Combat Center Wednesday to reunite with their loved ones and lives left behind.

The party arrived to Victory Field in the afternoon where they were met by their families, friends and fellow Marines who expressed their enthusiasm by holding up banners and posters that read &quot;welcome home.&quot;

It was a long and nerve-wrackingwait for some wives and family members for their loved one&apos;s return. Tragically, the battalion lost 11 of its members who were killed in action during the deployment. For those who kept in contact with the Marines and Sailors of 2/7 who were serving in OIF 3, the deployment grew more and more difficult for them.

 &quot;It was hard to hear about what was happening on the front,&quot; said Pvt. Robert R. Ribinskas, rifleman with Golf Company. Ribinskas, a Ft. Worth, Texas, native, remained behind with 2/7&apos;s Remain Behind Element. An important role the RBE played during 2/7&apos;s deployment was supporting the wives and families of the battalion by giving information of the battalion&apos;s whereabouts and helping out with any other issues the family members dealt with.

 &quot;All of us in the RBE wishes we were there with them for the deployment,&quot; continued Ribinskas. &quot;Still, I&apos;m glad that they are coming home now. It feels like yesterday they left this field. I&apos;ve actually been having dreams about them coming back.&quot; 

The wives and family members of the Marines and Sailors who were returning arrived on Victory Field early as they anticipated the party&apos;s return.

 &quot;It was a long wait, and it was a bit harder for me than his first deployment because of our newborn son,&quot; said Teneyia Wilson, wife of Cpl. Darnel Wilson, field wireman with Headquarters and Service Company. Present with Wilson was her 4-month-old son, Darius, and 3-year-old son, Darnel Jr.

 &quot;I was more worried for his wellbeing than his last deployment,&quot; added Wilson. &quot;But, the RBE kept me informed of what was going on out there, and they answered all of my questions. I know he is hurt right now because he lost some of his friends. I can&apos;t imagine what that was like. As for now I am glad he is home and is able to spend time with his children, one whom he has never seen. We plan to go back to our hometown in Denver to spend time with the rest of our families.&quot; 

The experience was new for Marissa Silva, wife of Staff Sgt. Melvin Silva, Headquarters and Service Company. Present with her at the homecoming ceremony was their 3-year-old son, Alejandro, and her in-laws.

 &quot;It was me and my husband&apos;s first deployment,&quot; said Silva. &quot;The time away from him was nerve-wracking. I was always thinking about him and what he was doing. I did keep in contact with him mainly through e-mails. He assured me that he was doing well but in the back of my mind I knew he wasn&apos;t telling me everything. I am just really glad that I will see him here today. I can&apos;t sit still. We plan to go back to the Bay Area where we can relax and spend time together.&quot; 

The homecoming event was a success, and all who came out to see their loved ones return were filled with joy when the advance-party bus rolled up to Victory Field. The rest of the battalion is scheduled to return to the Combat Center and reunite with their loved ones in the near future.

Working Hand in Hand
 
This picture, of the 3/1 Kilo CO and a Sgt.Major from the Iraqi Army working with 3/1, was passed along by Cris Yarborough from the always entertaining Juggernuts . His retired USMC father has more 3/1 pictures sent by the CO posted at http://imageevent.com/colbb/imagesfrom31iniraq Check them out - including proof that American Capitalism has truly taken hold in Baghdad.
 
Anyway, back to 3/1 Marines. Last January 14, my son celebrated his 21st birthday in Iraq by being knocked off his feet, along with the rest of his 1/7 Bravo Company fire team, by a mortar detonated as they patrolled the streets of Husaybah. That no one was seriously hurt was a miracle. This year, a number of similar events were prevented through coordinative efforts between 3/1 Marines and the Iraqi Army they are working and training with. From Barwanah :
 Iraqi Army soldiers and Marines with 2nd Platoon, L Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, were conducting routine security patrols roughly 500 meters east of southern Barwanah Jan. 14 and heading back to their base after a long day&apos;s work.

That is when Friday, one of L Company&apos;s interpreters, noticed a discoloration in the dirt.

It appears that the bad weather depressed the dirt and, because of the recent rain, left it a different color. After digging around in the dirt, they started finding ordnance.

&quot;It appears that these munitions were hastily buried within the last couple of days,&quot; said Capt. Shannon Neller, commanding officer of L Co.

The Iraqi soldiers and Marines conducted a thorough search of the area and unearthed a total of 11 buried weapons caches within a 300 meter radius that terrorists planned to use during attacks in the area.

When all 11 caches were unearthed, they contained 139 artillery rounds, 56 mortar rounds, 47 122mm rockets, 94 14.5mm armor piercing incendiary rounds and 19 100-pound bags of propellant.

&quot;There were 12 Iraqi Army soldiers directly involved in finding and digging up these caches. This gives them a sense of ownership and pride in what they&apos;re doing,&quot; said 2nd Lt. Geoff Meno, 2nd Platoon Commander with L Co.

Although these caches were found by Marines and Iraqi Army soldiers patrolling, citizens of the Haditha region have increasingly provided information to disrupt insurgent activities so their community will be safe from insurgent attacks. 


It&apos;s definitely a good thing that those munitions are destroyed. That the caches were noticed by a Iraqi interpreter and dug up by Iraqi soldiers is even better news.


 &quot;Taking these caches out of the hands of insurgents puts a tremendous dent in their logistics. Every round that the Marines and Iraqi Army take off the streets is one less (improvised explosive device) ... one more saved life,&quot; said Meno.

&quot;This is a testament to the vigilance of the Iraqi Army soldiers and Marines. They&apos;ve been doing a hell of a job out here. It is nice for them to see what they are doing occasionally comes with a tangible pay off,&quot; said Meno. 
One of the many things that are underreported by most media sources is the excellent working relationship between our Marines and the Iraqi Army. Trained by the best fighting force in the world, they are rapidly becoming capable of protecting their own country against outside forces. When that happens, our job will be done.

1/2 Marines: Waging war and peace
 Photo by LCpl Peter R. Miller Cpl Stephen Jordan, 1/2 Alpha, hands a young Iraqi girl a muffin as his fireteam provides security in the Hit area. 

LtCol &quot;Drew&quot; Smith, CO, Battalion Landing Team 1/2 sends this update:
 Greetings and best wishes to our families and friends,

The BLT 1/2 continues to conduct combat operations in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq to provide for the security of the citizens and local government of Hit area and to disrupt insurgent activities in the 22 MEU Area of Operations. Operations are going well and the Marines and Sailors continue to demonstrate the highest levels of professionalism and tenacity in their performance of duties.

As was mentioned earlier, daily operations see the BLT conducting security patrols in their respective sectors to assist the local government and citizens and to disrupt and destroy insurgents and their resources. With regard to the latter, recently coordinated efforts between the BLT companies and the BLT&apos;s Combat Engineer Platoon have netted several caches of insurgent weapons and ammunition in the area. I won&apos;t go into the methods and techniques by which the caches are uncovered, but I will tell you that our combat engineers have achieved much success in identifying the enemy&apos;s techniques and are now exploiting that knowledge to rid the area of munitions and weapons that can be used against the coalition forces and, as we have found, can be equally dangerous to the citizens of the area. The diligent and courageous actions of our Combat Engineers are some of the many ways in which the risk to our forces and those around us is reduced. CEB is doing great work.

I am also very proud of the courage, vigilance, and savvy our warriors are displaying every day in identifying improvised explosive devices (IED) the enemy emplaces in our AO. These devices are the enemy&apos;s feeble attempt to deter our efforts, shake our commitment and undermine the combined efforts of coalition forces and the local government in providing security in the post election period. In talking to the Marines and Sailors of that patrol the streets day and night, I have found their resolve to be &quot;rock steady.&quot; On the rare occasion where a device does directly impact one of our patrols, the vehicles and personal protective equipment used every day is standing the test extremely well. Although no amount of material can completely prevent damage or injury from occurring, first rate gear and vehicles coupled with very vigilant warriors has-and the data bares it out-put the odds clearly on our side. Our warriors are getting right back in the saddle after the event to reassure the local citizens and keep the pressure on the enemy.

There is more work to be done and this BLT is continuing to lean forward in planning and conducting operations that will address the security issues in our area of operations. Exactly how long we will be in Iraq remains to be seen. I would draw your attention to the recent update provided by the Commanding Officer, 22 MEU regarding the length of our deployment. As mentioned in the update, there is no indicator that we will be extended on this deployment; our return window remains in early May. Should there be a change to that picture, the most up-to-date and accurate information will be conveyed through our KV Network and 22 MEU and BLT 1/2 official web page.

Once again, I ask that you keep us in your thoughts and prayers. Very best regard. 
 Photo by Gunnery Sgt. Keith A. Milks A recent story by GySgt Keith Milks provides more details on the CEB&apos;s success with IED discovery:
 In early January, a section of CAAT vehicles accompanied a platoon from BLT 1/2&apos;s A Company on a patrol near Forward Operating Base Hit, and was able to land a one-two punch on the insurgents plaguing Iraq&apos;s highways.

&quot;Every once in a while we&apos;ll dismount and walk alongside the vehicles,&quot; said Twigg as he shouldered his M-4 carbine and began walking along the road&apos;s shoulder as his Humvee kept pace. &quot;We do this so we can get a better, more detailed look than if we were driving. By walking we get better (situational awareness).&quot;

No sooner had Twigg explained himself than the column of vehicles and Marines came to a screeching halt. Further ahead, the point element had discovered a suspicious pile of rocks and concrete covering an IED. Immediately establishing a defensive cordon around the site, the patrol leader, 2nd Lt. Davis Gooding Jr., called for Explosive Ordnance Disposal.

&quot;We&apos;ll bring EOD up to deal with it,&quot; explained the Henrico, Va., native. &quot;Until then we&apos;ll maintain a perimeter around the IED to keep ourselves and the locals safe.&quot;

While waiting for the EOD technicians to arrive, the Marines in the patrol kept a vigilant eye to the surrounding terrain, and after a few minutes, noticed a pair of men across the nearby Euphrates River acting suspiciously near another road.

&quot;We kept them under observation for a while then determined they were planting another IED,&quot; said Gooding.

Using high power scopes and binoculars, the Marines correctly determined the pair&apos;s intent and engaged them, killing both just as EOD arrived on the scene.

Working with time-honed expertise, the joint Navy-Marine EOD team destroyed the IED in place. Meanwhile, elements of the patrol jumped aboard a CH-46E Sea Knight from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 261 (Reinforced), the MEU&apos;s aviation combat element, to get a closer look at the bomb placement site across the river.

&quot;There was a shovel and stack of rockets near the men,&quot; said Gooding, who examined the scene, &quot;so we were able to stop them just in time.&quot;

After the engagement and the IED was destroyed, the patrol continued its mission, knowing that danger lurks around every corner.

&quot;We just had some successes,&quot; said Twigg, commenting on the IED discovery and destruction of the insurgent IED team, &quot;but we always have to be on alert and they (the insurgents) have to know we&apos;ll be ready for them.&quot;

Highlander Update - &quot;Good things are happening in Iraq.&quot;
LtCol Rob Kosid, 1st LAR, sent this update - not sure when it was written (or over what time period, since it references both the October 15 elections and Operation Santa) but it&apos;s a fascinating look at the success brought by the efforts of this force.
 Dear Friends and Families of the Highlanders,

Happy Holidays from your Marines and sailors of 1st LAR Battalion (Forward)! We&apos;re doing well and continuing to make a difference in at least two Areas of Operations. More on that a bit later. Of course, we hope that all of you enjoying the Holiday season back home - at least as much as you can under the circumstances. Believe me, we think about you all the time and are eagerly anticipating our homecoming in a few more months. In the meantime, thanks for all the cards, letters and packages.

Currently, the majority of the Task Force is conducting operations in our normal/assigned area of Operations near Ar Rutbah. Weapons Company, on the other hand, is currently working for 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines in the vicinity of Al Qaim. I speak with Capt Sucher on a regular basis and he reports that Warlord is doing very well and doing what they were trained to do. Am also getting many compliments on their performance from the Commanding Officer of 3/6. Their terrain is a little more urban than ours and they have the opportunity to do some great work in an area that has, up until last month, always been a thorn in the Coalition Force&apos;s side. Their Engineers have done a remarkable job turning an austere combat outpost into a functional Company firm base. I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to say that it&apos;s &quot;comfortable&quot; but it&apos;s a vast improvement over what they originally moved into! For those who participated in Operation Santa back home, we have made arrangements to have Weapons Company&apos;s packages sent up to them.

The rest of us have had a busy first half of December. On the 6th, we had the good fortune of hosting the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Hagee. He stayed with us for approximately an hour and a half and gave all of us more than enough opportunities to talk with and listen to him as well as numerous photo opportunities. SgtMaj Ward has even figured out a way for you to see all of the photos. If you hit this link: http://www.usmc.mil/cmc/photos/index.html and go to the Al Asad section of the December 3-9 CENTCOM visit, you can find our photos beginning on page 11. Our server&apos;s a little slower out here but there are lots of photos and the chances are good that your Highlander is in there somewhere! Following our visit, he took a flight out to our POE at Trebil where he visited Capt Jeff Goodell and our Marines and sailors of Alpha Battery - their pictures begin on around page 23 or so. All in all, the visit was a success and the Commandant had great things to say about what we&apos;re doing.

While CMC&apos;s visit was certainly big news, our biggest event occurred yesterday - 15 October. We set up and provided security for two polling sites in advance of Iraq&apos;s election of a full-term Parliament. Alpha Company (Apache) teamed with two Platoons from our partnered Iraqi Army unit - the 2d Company 2-1-1 and established a polling site in the vicinity of Ar Rutbah. All was set on the evening of 14 October and I visited the site at approximately 0845 on the 15th. In short, as surprised as I was at the turnout in Barwanah on the 15th of October, I wasn’t prepared for yesterday&apos;s voter turnout - it was unbelievable. As you probably already know, we&apos;re in a heavily Sunni dominated area and the turnout for the previous two elections was minimal at best. Without getting into too many details - official results are apparently a week or so away - the IECI workers (poll site employees) ran out of ballots and the line of voters stretched, at times, at least a quarter of a mile. Our polling site that H&amp;S;Company (Hammer) and their partnered platoon from 2d Company set up in Akashat had similar success - over 350 women voted out of approximately 1500 very enthusiastic voters there. When we visited that site, there were many people in the area and virtually all proudly displayed their ink-stained fingers. We attribute much of the success - at least in terms of how security affected the turnout - to the great work done by all of the Highlander elements in the few weeks preceding the election. I could not be more proud of their efforts and the expressions on the Highlander faces yesterday spoke volumes. Good things are happening in Iraq.

As I type this, we are in the process of sorting through the two tractor trailer-sized containers of mail brought to us by Combat Logistics Battalion - 2 last night as well as the four containers brought in by helicopters a few hours ago. Our company office is literally stacked to the ceiling with boxes from well-wishers. Both SgtMaj Ward and I cannot overstate how thankful we are for the wonderful generosity shown by so many of you. It inspires us! There are so many people to thank that I’m going to send a separate update and attempt to provide a proper &quot;thank you&quot; shortly after Christmas Day. Until then, thanks for your support! 
They&apos;ve promised Operation Santa pictures - can&apos;t wait to see them!

Christmas in Afghanistan
Happy New Year - we&apos;re still wrapped in Christmas spirit here, and this commentary by Air Force Staff Sgt. Jess Harvey will have you smiling too. When most people think of Christmas, they think of spending quality time with family and friends, sitting around a beautifully decorated tree, opening brightly-colored gifts and eating a feast of homemade goodies.

Others say Christmas is all about giving.

All of which I believe, but if you&apos;d have asked me a week ago, I&apos;d have said my Christmas was looking rather dreary, being deployed here in Afghanistan.

After all, I wasn&apos;t going to be watching my two children, ages 4 and 1, awaken all excited to see what had magically appeared under the tree during the night. I wasn&apos;t going to be holding my wife and laughing as the kids tore into their gifts with a fervor that goes unmatched at any other time of the year.

I wouldn&apos;t be eating all the freshly-cooked turkey, ham, dressing and pies, and smelling all the beautiful aromas that come with them.

But, even though my Christmas lacked all of the things that normally inspire the Christmas spirit, if you ask me today, I&apos;ll tell you I had one of the best Christmas experiences of my life.

Thanks to the diligent efforts of an Army staff sergeant with whom I share living quarters and the kind words of half a dozen Afghan guards who watch over us like guardian angels while we sleep, I experienced a magic on Christmas Eve like never before.

The festivities started around 6:30 p.m., but as could be expected during a deployment and with my lack of enthusiasm this year, I arrived about an hour late to an underwhelming number of people and a total lack of Christmas Sprit.

There was loads of food brought from all over, holiday cookies from home and individually packaged treats from a box, but the magic just wasn&apos;t there.

Whether it was the sports talk on TV filling the void where holiday music should have been or the lack of children&apos;s laughter throughout the house, the mood just wasn&apos;t in the air.

About the time it really started sinking in that this Christmas Eve probably would be best spent sleeping in my bunk, the staff sergeant caught my attention and said, &quot;Grab some cookies. We&apos;re going to hand them out.&quot; 

In my confusion, I picked up a tray of cream-filled cookies and followed him past all the revelers, out the door, through the yard and into the alley behind our safe-house where Afghan guards work around the clock.

We started handing cookies to each of the guards, who in turn, greeted us with salutations of &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; and their heartfelt thanks and appreciation for our being here in there country instead of at home with our loved ones.

After our exploits as cookie Santas, we returned to our house accompanied by a few Afghan guards who had shown up early and were not on duty yet.

In our back yard, their fire pit burned dimly. We all sat, warming our hearts and feet, to the crackle of the fire and laughter of good friends, some of which I&apos;d met for the first time that night.

The Afghan guards shared with us their tales of love, laughter and freedoms -- all gained, according to them, since the arrival of the coalition. We shared our own experiences, jokes and thanks with them in return.

We also shared food, lots of food. When one of the Afghans, warming himself next to the fire, would grab an apple or an orange, he would always offer half of it to someone else, sitting nearby, as I later learned is their custom. The same went for the grape and apple juice we used to toast one another.

Before long, all of my sorrows had departed and I started feeling as though I&apos;d known these guys all of my life. As the guards started getting ready for work, and I prepared to climb in my bunk, one guard, who teaches English in his off hours, leaned over to me and told me something I hope will stick with me for the rest of my life.

He said, &quot;Tonight, my brother, you have shown me what Christmas means. Now I can go and teach my students about it.&quot; 

That&apos;s when it hit me square in the heart. This night the Christmas Spirit had become more vivid and alive than ever before in my lifetime, all because of the laughs, smiles and hugs shared with my new-found brethren.

Christmas truly is about giving, whether it be a smile, a hug, a cookie or freedom.

Christmas is also about spending time with loved ones, whether you&apos;ve known them all your life, or whether you&apos;ve just met for the first time. If I were given the chance to do it all over again, I would not have changed a thing. After all, my Afghan brothers helped me to truly understand the meaning of Christmas.

Notes on General Abizaid&apos;s speech - &quot;We are winning&quot;
General Abizaid spoke recently to the Naval War College regarding the current status of the war on terror, and that speech was summarized by an unidentified student. The file was briefly available at C-Span, but is no longer available. Patrick, at Liberating Iraq , was kind enough to translate the PDF file into plain text - visit him for the full transcript , but here are talking points that need to be heard: The insurgency is in four of 18 provinces in Iraq, not all 18. You do not hear about the 14 provinces where there is no insurgency and where things are going well. The insurgency in Afghanistan is primarily in Kandahar province (home of the Taliban) and in the mountain region on the Pakistani border. The rest of the country is doing well.

Iraq now has over 200,000 soldiers/police under arms and growing. They are starting to eclipse the US/coalition forces. Their casualty rate is more than double that of the US. There are more than 70,000 soldiers under the moderate government in Afghanistan and growing.

He predicted that the insurgencies in the four Sunni provinces in northern/central Iraq and in Southwestern Afghanistan will be there for the foreseeable future, but they will be stabilized and become small enough so the moderate governments will be able to keep them under control.

2006 will be a transition year in Iraq and that will see the Iraqi forces take much more of the mission from the US forces. This is necessary to bring stability to Iraq. We need to be fewer in numbers and less in the midst of the people for the moderate Iraqi government to succeed.

Our primary enemy is not the insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is al Qaida and their ideology. We are at a period now that is similar to the 1920s where Communism and Nazism had not taken hold in Russia and Germany. The ideology of Al Qaida is out there and it has not taken hold in any country in the Middle East. We need to make sure that it does not and we are doing that, but it will be a long problem with a long commitment.

He said that we are focused on the things that we (Americans) have done wrong, like Abu Ghraib, and not talking about this enemy. We need to talk about this enemy. al Qaida is all over the world. Their goal is to get the US out of the region and come to power in the Islamic countries of the region. From there, their goal is to establish a Caliphate (under a single Islamic ruler) that goes from the Atlantic in North Africa to Indonesia in the Pacific. Fifty years after this happens, their goal is to rule the rest of the world.

Since Desert Storm in 1991, US forces have not lost any combat engagement in the region at the platoon-level or above. al Qaida has no beliefs that they can defeat us militarily. They see our center of gravity as being the will of the American People. That is influenced by the media and they are playing to that. They don&apos;t need to win any battles. Their plan is keep the casualties in front of the American people in the media for long enough that we become convinced that we cannot win and leave the region. This would be tragic for our country.

The battle against al Qaida will not be primarily military. It will be political, economic, and ideological. It will require the international community to fight too. We must not let al Qaida get hold in any country. It will result in our worst nightmare. Picture life in Afghanistan under the Taliban, that is what Al Qaida&apos;s ideology has as a goal.

If you look at the geography (of al Qaida), there is no place to put a military solution. They are networked and they are all over the world. They are a virtual organization connected by the Internet. They use it to proselytize, recruit, raise money, educate and organize. They have many pieces that we must focus on: the propaganda battle in the media, safe houses, front companies, sympathetic members of legitimate governments, human capital, fighters and leaders, technical expertise, weapons suppliers, ideologically sympathetic non-government organizations (charities), financers, smugglers, and facilitators. A lot of their money comes from drugs.

We are winning but we have got to maintain constant pressure over time with the international community and across the US government agencies. No one is afraid that we can&apos;t defeat the enemy. Our troops have the confidence, the courage, and the competence. We need the will of the American people to be sustained for the long haul. If only our politicians and media had the confidence our troops have.

&quot;From your Marines in Iraq&quot;
From One Marine&apos;s View - here is Captain B&apos;s Christmas message to us: We are away from home this holiday season to complete our mission and to eliminate terrorists and defend our nation. It is unfortunate for us to be away from loved ones on earth and in heaven however, its probably the best Christmas gift Ive ever given. No family gatherings, snow drifts or missile toe. Just always on watch ready to go. Scumbags are scared and are on the run, regardless of wherever they go they will find us with lots of guns. While you are in the states celebrating the season know that we are on the front lines for a reason. As this war continues you may not always hear it, but we are full of American and Christmas spirit.

As you celebrate Christmas, be thankful for what you have and where you are. Know its better to give than receive and be thankful you are with someone who cares enough about you to pick you up when needed. You don&apos;t need a lot of money and fame to have a great Christmas just the Christmas spirit is enough. Enjoy your health and enjoy life. In the states, on a rocky Afghani mountain or Iraqi desert, have a Very Merry Christmas and this holiday, have the time of your life.

From your Marines, Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah from Iraq.

Rest in peace, your Marines are on guard
 Here&apos;s an excerpted glimpse of Christmas in Iraq from Cap&apos;t B - he can&apos;t be with his own family, but he&apos;s with his other family. I take a walk outside to check out the weather as it starts to rain, this is the first rain Ive seen for a year here as it turns to hail. Im not at home anymore Im here still in Iraq, with a different family, the Marine family. Another milestone has been achieved and the elections are a success. A country is in motion with democracy and freedom and the last years work is paying off although we have paid a price. There are no lights here except for the few strings Marines have put up from care packages, and the occasional illume artillery round fired in the night sky. I guess there is a special glow from the chemlights that line the walkway but they definitely aren&apos;t the holiday type. There are no crowds except for the locals on the street in the city and they aren&apos;t shopping. The IEDs and other explosions echo though the area now days. Im not sure if it&apos;s the cloud cover or what but now when there is an explosion it echoes through the area for a few seconds unlike before. Counter battery rings out and dang that first one always gets ya, at least I wasn&apos;t in the head this time. Sporadic fighting continues around the area but nothing crazy. Marine&apos;s morale is high and everyone has accepted the fact that this is the only family they will be sharing the holiday with and actually that&apos;s not a bad thing. You could say it doesn&apos;t bother you to be away from home on the holidays . . . you could say you&apos;re a liar too. However, we are a disciplined force and know we have an important job to do. That job requires discipline, commitment and sacrifice. Sacrifice in the hundreds to those who won&apos;t ever go home, ever. Where ever there is injustice in the world we will go there. Wherever there is an evil dictator killing his own people, we will go there. Why? Because as US Marines that&apos;s our job and that&apos;s what Marines have been doing for over two hundred years. We will fight our nation&apos;s battles in any climb and place and anytime of the year. That young Marine standing post in the chilly desert night knows it&apos;s the holiday season as does that young Marine who is on his second dozen convoy mission through the worse area in Iraq. The Soldier on a lonely checkpoint out in the middle of nowhere with nothing but his team and gun truck, they know it&apos;s the holiday season too. The tanker, the pilot the warrior. They all know it&apos;s better to give than to receive. A simple concept that they and their buddy&apos;s have proven with blood and sweat. A simple concept that many &quot;Don&apos;t get&quot;.

We are a proud military, a volunteer military who take pride in what we do for a nation that is great. This holiday season, cherish what is yours, smell the trees, have fun with family, take walks, have some egg nog and a stoag for us and enjoy your holidays. Although we had rather be home, know that we will finish what needs to be done and you can rest in peace, your Marines are on guard this holiday season.

Merry Christmas&amp;Semper Fidelis

1/2 Holiday Update
LtCol &quot;Drew&quot; Smith, CO, Battalion Landing Team 1/2 sends this Christmas greeting to 1/2 friends and family: Happy Holidays

On behalf of the Marine and Sailors of BLT 1/2, I want to extend to all of you &quot;best wishes for a Happy and safe holiday season.&quot; As we continue in this deployment, and as our focus remains firmly on our duties, there will undoubtedly be thoughts of home and of celebrations that accompany this time of the year. Christmas Trees and decorations are going up without the assistance of loved ones that are deployed, families are gathering and kids are counting the days until school lets out and the jolly-little-red-suited-elf makes his rounds. During this time of the year, there are thousands of American service men and women forward deployed and serving their country. I need not go into any detail of their courage and sacrifice and that of their families. Please keep the BLT in your thoughts and prayers. We wish all an enjoyable and safe holiday season.

Holiday Letter from Major General Natonski
Here&apos;s a holiday message from the 1st MARDIV Commanding General: Families and Friends of the 1st Marine Division,

As we prepare for the upcoming holidays, I want to extend my best wishes to you during this joyous season. You have each made significant contributions to the success of our Marines and Sailors both here and abroad. Your dedication, understanding, and unwavering support throughout our intense training schedules and long deployments instills confidence in the men and women of the &quot;Blue Diamond&quot; division. Thank you.

During this season let us also take a moment to remember those families who have lost a loved one or friend. We honor their sacrifices and our thoughts and prayers go out to them, let us never forget our country&apos;s heroes, those that paid the ultimate price for our country and Corps.

I wish you all Season&apos;s Greetings and a Happy New Year. God bless the members of the 1st Marine Division and their families and friends!

Semper Fidelis,

R. F. Natonski

&quot;&apos;Step on daddy&apos;s shoes, let him lead you&quot;
 Photo and story details by LCpl Ray Lewis 

There is nothing that can transform a fierce warrior into a soft-hearted smiling daddy faster than one small girl. And that transformation happened several hunded times recently at the Mary Fay Pendleton Elementary School 2nd Annual Father-Daughter Dance. Marines donned their dress blues and escorted their daughters into the gymnasium for a night of dancing and relationship-building. And, for some Marines who will leave soon for deployment - and months away from their families - this was a chance to leave their daughters with memories of a very special night. &quot;Who would wear their &apos;dress blues&apos; if they didn&apos;t have to?&quot; asked Lori DeMille, a second grade teacher at the school. &quot;Be hot and stuffy for two hours; they have to love their kids to go through that. It takes a special dad.&quot; 

The dance was a chance for fathers to spend time with their daughters between deployments. It was a night of eating, dancing and bonding. And for those whose daddies were currently deployed, there were stand ins so that they would not have to miss the dance.

 &quot;It might be small to some, but things like this are big for the hearts of the girls,&quot; said Gunnery Sgt. Samuel Reed, father of Mary Fay elementary students Michaela and Krystal Reed. &quot;It brings unity and builds synergy. Synergy is the relationship.&quot; 

 &quot;I think it&apos;s awesome,&quot; DeMille said. &quot;With the increase of deployments, we saw the need to do more functions like these with our kids.&quot; 

Principal Lynn Gilstrap also thinks the dance is an amazing experience for the children and fathers.

 &quot;A lot of these dads are deploying within the next couple of months,&quot; Gilstrap said. &quot;One dad just got home yesterday and another is deploying tomorrow. (He) deploys in the morning, but he said, &apos;I couldn&apos;t miss this night with my little girl,&apos;&quot; DeMille said.

Most dads wanted to do all they could to make sure their daughter was as comfortable as possible.

 &quot;To help his daughter dance I heard one dad say, &apos;step on daddy&apos;s shoes, let him lead you,&apos;&quot; DeMille said.

Report from Fallujah: Courage under fire

Another email from the front (passed along by JHD), this one by a wounded Marine who provides excellent insight into the third iteration of this war as his men engage in &quot;fighting the enemy, protecting the innocent, aiding the weak, defending one another&quot;.

 To All:
I was growing concerned that the increasing tempo of operations leading to the December 15th elections would prevent me from writing home prior to this watershed event. Luckily and unluckily, events have provided a few days for me to reflect on my experiences and pen a few thoughts. For those who did not already know, I was wounded on December 8th. My platoon was protecting a logistics element inside Fallujah when we were caught in an ambush. A rocket struck my vehicle to no effect, the armor saving the two Marines inside from harm. Both walked away from the attack with just their &quot;bells rung&quot; and even the truck will return to duty in a few days. When the rocket hit I was outside the vehicle setting security with another Marine. We immediately came under small arms fire from a machine gun some blocks away. We were able to fight our way out of the ambush but in the process I was shot in the right thigh. I am in good physical condition, back with my platoon, just a little sore. The wound was clean, punching through my quadricep muscle without hitting femur or femoral artery. Unfortunately, I will be on crutches for at least a week before I can fully return to duty.

Recent weeks have been very successful for the Battalion. Shortly after Thanksgiving we conducted a large operation resulting in a number of enemy caches uncovered and insurgents captured. The Marines are becoming increasingly proficient in our area of operations and with the incumbent tactical success, morale is very high, even considering the Holidays. As the recent pronouncements suggest, the enemy has identified our area as a strategic focus in the coming weeks. The October 15th elections, with the exception of Sgt. Adams&apos;s death, featured almost complete calm for the city of Fallujah.

We defended a high voter turnout for both Sunni and Shia. While the vote was an overwhelming &quot;no&quot; to the Iraqi Constitutional referendum, largely due to Muj intimidation, so long as the populace chose to express their dissent through the democratic process and not with violence, than the election was a resounding success. I do not think that the Muj will allow December 15th to pass similarly undisturbed. Regardless, there are many signs of success here. One of the most notable is the Iraqi Army. I have operated with them and argue that the issues of administration and discipline they face are not fatal but merely endemic as in other Third World militaries I have trained beside. Not that our own military history has always enjoyed the same spirit of volunteerism, high morale, low desertion, rigid discipline and extraordinary combat efficacy as now. The Iraqi Army battalions here are very brave, almost to recklessness. They are always eager to tangle with insurgents and bring an enthusiasm for combat rivaling that of my Marines. The most valuable capability they bring though is their understanding of the cultural context of the people. Where we might search a home for hours or interact with a village for several days before we comprehend the inner workings of the village, an Iraqi Army patrol, as Iraqis, already know where to look for hidden weapons, they can quickly sift out the wheat from the chaff of information, the &quot;head man&quot; from the &quot;loud mouth&quot; and the &quot;poor illiterate farmer&quot; from the &quot;local man of esteem.&quot; To best illustrate how considerable this is, allow me to explain some difficulties I routinely encounter.

Day here begins before the sun rises and after it falls. We patrol in and out of the firm base to and from our assigned sector for the day, sometimes driving with no ambient light using only night vision goggles. It&apos;s exhilarating when through my left eye I can see the green of the goggles, the sides of the roads rushing by, the infra-red headlights illuminating everything clearly for several hundred meters while through my right eye I can only see black with the roller-coaster consciousness of blindly hurtling into darkness. The adrenaline rush rivals coffee to start the day. We normally patrol to sectors of the city or surrounding countryside where recent contact has occurred or where enemy presence is suspected. Experience makes it possible to template where the enemy likes to hide equipment and munitions. Experience has also made more apparent what is normal and abnormal, a difficult feat two months ago when literally everything seemed out of the ordinary. While mistakes still occur, my Marines can now look down a stretch of road and quickly point out the one or two things that are not quite right. The one challenge that experience has not yet made us equal to is working with the Iraqi population. I cannot speak Arabic beyond a few sentences but I have learned enough of the vocabulary and gestures that I can understand what I am being told. Many of our conversations are predictable. My favorite is the &quot;I know nothing.&quot; It goes something like this (Arabic purists please forgive, I have written these phonetically):

Me: &quot;Salaam&quot; (Arabic Greeting) Him: &quot;Salaam&quot; Me: &quot;Shlonak&quot; How are you). Him: &quot;Zien&quot; (Good) or &quot;Mu Zien&quot; (Bad - when they say bad they always point with their hand at our vehicles and Marines setting security around with a tone of annoyance). Me: &quot;Wane Eish?&quot; (Where do you live?) If he points at the ground or the area around I ask with an inquiring tone &quot;Biet&quot; (House), usually they point to their house.

At this point my Arabic is almost exhausted so my interpreter, by far one of the bravest man I ever met, begins a pre-planned spiel on why we are here, and exchanges pleasantries, asking about local crime and any needs of the population. We ask about crime because one &quot;black ski mask gang&quot;, native or foreign, is like another, bouncing between &quot;Mujahadeen&quot; (Holy Warriors) and &quot;Mujarem&quot; (Criminals) as the mood suits them. The wants of the population are always one of two things, either electricity or water. Water is usually the more prevalent of the needs.

I listen politely to the requests for water, power and security and promise to do what I can to get these to him. Usually the man I am talking to thanks me (Shukran), and I say &quot;You&apos;re Welcome&quot; (Afwan). Pleasantries complete I ask him whether he has seen any strangers. The answer is always &quot;No.&quot; At this point, any English speaking ability the man has immediately disappears, from &quot;Oxford to Al Anbar&quot; faster than 0 to 60. I then ask, &quot;Have you heard any loud noise, seen
anyone with guns or anyone acting strangely?&quot; The answer is always
&quot;No&quot; repeated multiple times, two hands waving in front of his face and head shook side to side. Usually he invokes Allah&apos;s name a few times to testify to his honesty.

My favorite trump card to play is then to ask them what they were doing yesterday (the time of the attack) and then walk them to the crater of yesterday&apos;s attack, or in some cases, the still smoking crater from that day&apos;s attack. Of course, their response, now much more vociferous in its physical emotion is still &quot;No, I know nothing&quot;, vocabulary I have learned well, coupled with an even more strident invocation of Allah. Eventually my interpreter uses the facts in front of us to verbally persuade them to admit what they saw. For an Iraqi Army unit, quicker to scent duplicity, these interactions are immeasurably briefer and often more successful.

I do not mean to say that no Iraqis help us ever. Quite the contrary. There are those rare brave souls whose hatred for the Muj or for the situation in general, willingly step forward and help us. These men, like my interpreter, are true heroes. Usually though, most Iraqis will not assist without a relationship developed over time, trust gained by longevity and the provision of basic necessities. They do not want to risk all without demonstrated staying power and proof positive you can impact the local situation. My life was saved by one such man about a month ago.

In some cases they request the impossible but often it is easy to make changes on their level. In one instance, I visited a water starved village. After an hour of the mayor recounting the figuratively and literally &quot;dry&quot; history of the village, he finally explained that their water source had been stolen by a neighboring town who had tapped into the piping to increase their irrigation supply. This was an easy fix, as people usually do not say &quot;no&quot; when ordered by a Marine patrol to turn off their pirated water flow. The second and third order effect of such fortunate interaction is immeasurable.

With all this said, the challenge of working in the cultural context is a pleasant intellectual hurdle to overcome, possessing an intimidating and stimulating duality. Far more difficult to overcome are the daily battles my platoon contends against complacency and fear. It is easy to become complacent here. Creature comforts increase, familiarity breeds relaxed vigilance, Marines start counting down the number of days until we go home and suddenly the mistakes I mentioned earlier occur. Similarly, fear creeps into the
subconscious. The difference between Marines new in country and combat veterans is that a veteran knows that unlike film depiction, you don&apos;t see the sniper, you hear a -crack- and a Marine falls. At the moment of detonation, you don&apos;t see the IED that explodes under or beside you. You never see the dramatic blaze orange ball of flame,
just the terrifying mid-sentence thunder of the blast, the instantaneous cloud of dark smoke and the overwhelming force of the overpressure from the charge pushing through the armor and shaking your entire body. The wounded do not cry out when they get hit. It all happens too suddenly to say a word. It&apos;s this knowledge, that everything can change in less than a heartbeat that gives combat Marines a bit of an edge, a confidence tinged with alert nerves. What carries my platoon through these struggles is the courageous leadership of my Non-Commissioned Officers, my Corporals and Sergeant, hardened perfectionists.

An example of the impact and heroism that these NCOs have is Sergeant Isaac Luna of Kansas. Sgt Luna is a vehicle commander in another platoon in the Company. In the last month we have had sniper attacks on stationary units. Several have been killed and injured by this threat. A few weeks ago while operating in the city, Sergeant Luna&apos;s crew came under fire from a sniper. Private First Class Kimungu of New Hampshire was wounded across from his vehicle, the round penetrating his helmet. Though the shot was followed with a burst of small-arms fire, without a moment hesitation and with complete disregard for his own safety, Sgt Luna rushed into the open street, administering a pressure bandage to PFC Luna. Though completely exposed, Sgt Luna did not abandon his position until relieved by the platoon corpsman, HM3 Cruze from the Bronx. Throughout, Sgt Luna remained in the street, securing the wounded Marine. This courage under fire is what NCOs bring to the fight.

Examples like Sgt Luna&apos;s are important to me because they defy the alleged norm of human conduct. A recent essay I read contrasted the artwork of Mary Cassatt, glorying in simple beauty, with the more aesthetically erratic work of Joan Miro. The author sought to disprove the theory of critic Theordo Adorno that the horrors of modern war, exemplified by the Second World War, had forever thwarted the ability of art to convey the wonder of everyday human existence. This argument, carried to its logical conclusion, would point that in the face of brutality, the triumph of the human spirit over evil is now rendered impossible; that no action or expression can ever again convey humanity&apos;s finest qualities. I bring this relatively obscure argument to light because I think it is emblematic of the mindset that no good could come of what we do here. I will not lie, there are days where the things I see, the things I do, infest my heart with doubt.

No one said war was a pleasant thing. Time and time again though, it is Marines like Sgt Luna who cleanse my soul. They have seen death at its ugliest, in the face of the wrecked body of a child. They have seen their brother in arms carried away in their final moments. They have faced fatigue, fear, boredom, complacency, a lack of personal space and home-sickness. Yet for all their adolescence of years, they continue to soldier on as &quot;warriors for the working day&quot; with the dark humor of combat infantry. I don&apos;t know whether they understand or care about the politics of this war. I have never asked them. All I do know is that I have seen them at their best and worst, as they have me. As much as they would rather be home, enjoying Holidays with their family (for most of us this is our third Holiday season away in three years), they seemdemigods when they can see the difference they make. Whether it is fighting the enemy, protecting the innocent, aiding the weak or defending one another, they are at their highest when most directly challenged. While I cannot paint, I wish I could because in those often unheralded moments, I see something approaching the sublime, despite what all the naysayers, cynics and critics might claim.

I know this was a very long e-mail, largely because I am stuck in my &quot;dry dock&quot; for a few more days. To everyone thank-you for the outpouring of thoughts, prayers, letters and packages I receive. Special thanks to the citizenry of Tinley Park, Illinois, whose generous outpouring of care packages have ensured yet again a Merry Christmas for the Marines here. I will try to use the next few days to write back to those who have sent letters and e-mails. Thanks again and God Bless.

Semper Fidelis,
Brian Donlon
 


Not all painting is done with brush and canvas. Words can provide a rich medium with which to portray the sublime against a backdrop of gritty reality. That was accomplished in this e-mail.

Last minute Operation Santa request from the sandbox

We&apos;re wrapping up Operation Santa for this year - over 12,000 stocking mailed so far - but we just got the following request:
 The problem is we have some units in Afghanistan and Iraq that will not receive their MWR dollars in time to plan a Christmas holiday for the troops.
Don&apos;t have an exact number of troops, and the Master Sgt that e-mailed
me from Afgan (whom I know personally) has not been able to re-email me since.

But if some stockings could be sent to their unit commander that would really help. Please let me know for sure though so I can tell them to expect something. Thank you again, and bless you both for all you are doing for our service members and their families. 

I&apos;ll be working this weekend to fill this request - if you&apos;d like to donate to help with the cost of filling an additional 217 stockings, hit the PayPal donation button here or on the Marine Corps Family Foundation site (be sure to note that it will be for the 1107th AVCRAD effort).

2/2 Commander&apos;s Update

Here&apos;s a December update from LtCol Minick:

 Warlord Family and Friends,
Success continues throughout our area of operations, particularly in preparation for the upcoming government elections on 15 December 2005. Our Marines continue to do great work and are achieving the priorities I established when we first arrived to Iraq. Daily they conduct counterinsurgency operations, train and work with the Iraqi Army, and conduct Civil Affairs Operations. All of these move towards the goal of preparing Iraq to determine the future of their country and our eventual departure. I am confident that we are on the right path and I continually see results and evidence of our success in all areas.

Locating enemy weapons caches has been a major part of our success lately. Platoons have located thousands of enemy munitions and weapons of varying types. Most importantly, we have stripped from the battlefield the required ingredients to build Improvised Explosive Devices (IED&apos;s). This is critical and removes a source of supply from the enemy hands. In doing so, we continue to disrupt their ability to attack coalition forces and effect the upcoming elections.

Another considerable change for us has been the weather. As innocuous as this sounds, after the 120+ degree Fahrenheit days of summer, the current daytime temperatures of 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s and nighttime temperatures in the 40&apos;s is welcome. Of course, as was expected, the Marines already have started complaining about the cold and the wish for the warmer weather. In that regard, I suspect I will never keep them happy. Nearly every day we have clouds, but so far no rain. December is supposed to be the wettest month in Iraq but in looking at the historical statistics, &quot;wet&quot; is a relative term in comparison to Camp Lejeune and other areas in the United States.

Thanksgiving brought us a great good spread of traditional food at the chow hall, for those that were able to eat there. Despite the holiday, operations continued unabated so we trucked out food to every company firm base for those available to enjoy. The chow hall provided a decent feast with turkey, stuffing, all associated side dishes and tables of different types of deserts. Though not at home, we were able to enjoy time with fellow Marines during the holiday.

Care packages have been flowing in regularly and I suspect that will increase during the Christmas holiday. For all that send them, we thank you very much. These actions mean a lot to each Marine and provide him a moment of relaxation and time to reflect on home and those he loves. We may not be with you during Christmas but will think of you and be with you in spirit.

The reality of the ever-present danger in this fight was felt again this month. We suffered two casualties. LCpl Shiavoni on November 15th and LCpl Troyer on November 19th were taken from us on the field of battle. They were great men and Marines. The Task Force misses them deeply and we all pray for their families as we all struggle with this tragic loss. The Men will fight on in respect of their memory, for that is exactly what they would wish and deserve.

To help counter our heartache, I&apos;m pleased to announce more additions to the Warlord family. The dedication of our Task Force and their families is unsurpassed. The following households are enduring a deployment without the luxury of being together during this momentous time. I&apos;m unable to describe my appreciation for your continued sacrifice.

The following Warlords had recent additions:
Capt Corry and Whitney Murphy; Nathan; H&amp;S;
LCpl Jason and Amanda Flagale; Rio; Wpns
LCpl Salome and Danielle Garcia; Reehna; Golf


During the upcoming holiday, we wish we could be with you and will turn our thoughts to you regularly. Nonetheless, we will continue to push hard to ensure the elections are safe and eventless for the Iraqi people as they exercise their right to vote and take ownership in their future.

This is my 10th of 13 newsletters. I hope they help to keep you updated on the successes of our Task Force. They amaze and impress me daily.

Thank you for your continued loyal support.

I remain Semper Fidelis,
James J. Minick

Happy Birthday Marines!

The 230th birthday of the United States Marine Corps was celebrated today wherever Marines congregated. Last year, General Hagee authorized 2 beers and a ration of rum for each Marine in Iraq. Everybody was 21 that day. This year, here&apos;s how one deployed Marine celebrated:

 OK last year I got to wake up with my beautiful wife at Parris Island and go get a sweet Eagle Globe and Anchor Tat on the MC Birthday and I thought to myself this is the best one yet. I was wrong. Tonight I ran the gauntlet through Karmah a crappy little town next to Fallujah that keeps us busy taking care of Ali baba and all the Misters on a regular basis, not a good place. But it is a place that hold 4 small AO&apos;s with small detactments of Marines, who live the basic life and get 2 hot meals a week. BUT it the dang Corps Birthday, 230 years of taking the garbage out, so those boys deserve their cake just like all Marines around the world, ssooo tonight I hooked up with a buddy of mine from 2/2 and we went on a cake run. It was awesome, only had to stop once for possible IED&apos;s which was great because its usually 2-4 times a trip. made it to all for AO&apos;s and got to get Marines their frikken Birthday cake. THIS is the best birthday I have ever had. Happy frikken birthday Marines, go get your piece of cake( and drink one for us)
From me and my Marines in Camp Fallujah Iraq.
 
We had to wrap them in trashbags, because of the nasty dust.
 


Happy Birthday to all Marines. And, a special thanks to the ladies of the Vancouver Washington Marine Corps League Women&apos;s Auxiliary who spent a day making and sending birthday cards for Marines around the world, including my son.

2/2 Warlord Update

LtCol Minick, CO for 2/2 Warlords, sends this update from the sandbox:

 1 November 2005
Warlord Family and Friends,

Following a successful constitutional referendum, 2/2 continued to aggressively pursue the enemy throughout the area of operations. Data received indicates that a significant increase in the percentage of Sunnis voted in comparison to the January 2004 interim government election. Now that the people have accepted the constitution, another election in mid-December will be to elect a new government to serve for the next five years. Whatever final form the government takes, the important point is that the Iraqis are exercising democratic rights.

A big part of counterinsurgency is separating the people from the insurgent, causing them to lose popular support. Our Civil Affairs effort is working to support that goal by identifying needs within each given area, coordinating with the Marine Company Commander and local Iraqi civil leaders and Sheikhs. The ultimate goal is to assist the Iraqis in developing their economy. Long-term employment will improve the lives of the populace and provide hope and reason to pursue peace for all.

Our Iraq counterparts in the Iraqi Army continue to do an outstanding job in their assigned area of operations. Their competency and skill continues to improve and with their ability to conduct operations with minimal or no Marine support has furthered our ability to influence a much wider area. They are a major part of the future success of this country. As well, Iraqi Police forces are developing and will begin to provide the enforcement of laws as the new government develops. The rule of law is vital to achieving peace and security. With Iraqi Security Forces providing security, the people can feel safe to live their lives, educate their children, go the mosque, and work to improve the economy.

Amidst our success, the Warlords suffered very painful losses. From Mobile Assault Platoon White, Weapons Company, SSgt Pummill, LCpl Russoli and LCpl Szwydek were killed in action. Easy Company lost Capt Swisher their company commander, Sgt Hodshire, Cpl Cockerham, HM3 Thompson, and LCpl Butler. We will miss them deeply and will continue to pray for their families that they may find peace and strength. The Warlords will continue the fight against insurgents while improving the daily lives of Iraqi citizens. By continuing to do so, we honor our fallen Marines.

After such sobering and tragic losses the news of newborn Warlords help us recover and find hope in troubling times. I&apos;m pleased to announce the additions to two families in Golf Company.

Captain Joel and Lisa Schmidt Alexander Golf
Corporal Michael and Nichole Donnelly Dylan Golf

More great news for the Donnelly family. Corporal Michael Donnelly (Co G) was selected for meritorious promotion to Sergeant Nov 2nd. He was competing against a very competitive field from several other battalions and independent commands. We are extremely proud of him and happy for his family.

The following Marines were promoted and I want to offer my congratulations to them.

Maj Brandon Conway Weapons Company 1 October
GySgt Keith Harris Golf Company 1 October
Capt Stephen Musick H&amp;S;Company, Supply 1 November
SSgt Michael Skinta H&amp;S;Company, Sniper Platoon 1 November
GySgt Mike Smith (frocked) H&amp;S;Company 1 November

In closing, I would like to express my continued THANKS for the great support our Men are getting from those of you back home. You are truly &quot;force multipliers&quot; as you pump-up the morale with care packages, letters and emails. Special thanks to our Key Volunteer Network, led by Jayme Alexander and her terrific team of coordinators. During these trying times as we deal with our casualties they have been superb. We are half way to the end of our deployment. We remain focused on the mission and each other and will not get distracted by approaching &quot;Homecomings&quot;. We have too much to accomplish. To be sure, we all cherish the day we are home with our loved ones.


I remain Semper Fidelis,

James J Minick 


2/2 Marines are one of our Operation Santa battalions - in addition to her Key Volunteer duties, Jayme Alexander is making sure that all 2/2 Marines have a happy holiday. If you&apos;d like to help, contact us at operationsanta@marinecorpsmoms.com .

&quot;And here they fly Old Glory proudly&quot; - report from Fallujah

Here&apos;s a must read from the American Courage Newsletter . It&apos;s written by a civilian employee who is in Fallujah, working with Marines.

 Hello all! I am now a resident of Fallujah. As I have found, this is a very different place from Victory, and a very different world.
The Marines run Fallujah. Marines are different. Their way of life is different. More disciplined. More regimented. More austere. Harder.

I&apos;m surrounded by dozens of them when I go to chow or to the Morale Center (the MWR). Especially at the MWR, it&apos;s mostly the youngest of the Marines in what must be the closest thing to a purely social gathering they&apos;ll experience here. Few NCOs and fewer officers, just them and their buds.

They&apos;re young men, mostly Privates, Lance Corporals and Corporals, between the ages of 18 and 22. They&apos;re slim and lean of build, yet muscular. Broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip, as Jimmy Dean would say. There are no chubby Marines here.

Almost to a man, they wear their hair high and tight: buzzed on the sides with just a close-cropped shock on top to give their Kevlar helmet a lightly padded resting place. A few shave their heads altogether but most wear the sidewalls.

Many have a white stripe on either side of their face, running between the eye and the ear, where their skin was shielded from the harsh Arabian sun by their sunglasses or dust goggles. All are clean shaven, though some don&apos;t look like they need it regularly. Some still haven&apos;t outgrown acne.

They&apos;re good, honest faces. When they look at you or speak to you, you sense that there is no nonsense about them; no guile in their manner. It&apos;s as if their life is too busy and their spare time too precious to fritter it away on anything but straightforwardness and candor. Their life here revolves around linear thinking and linear action, going straight from Point A to Point B. And their demeanor shows it.

Their behavior is more reserved than I&apos;ve come to expect from a gathering of the same age group from any other service. No braggadocio and no trash talking. It&apos;s not that they&apos;re deathly grim, they&apos;re just not as boisterous as a typical group of American 20-year-olds. They&apos;re aware that their next appointment with fate is only a few hours and a few hundred yards away. And the only thing that keeps them alive tomorrow could well be that pimple-faced Marine sitting next to them.

In this setting you truly can sense the depth of their camaraderie; the respect among those who&apos;ve shared a common, life-changing experience. They behave as if they were family, a brotherhood of baby-faced warriors.

The job of the Marines is different, which makes them different. They don&apos;t rely on all manner of 21st Century techno-wizardry, like the Army or Air Force. Sure, they have tanks and helicopters and night vision goggles and the like, but those do not form the core of the Marine&apos;s order of battle. To them, the perfect weapon is a gutsy Marine with a keen eye, a steady hand, and a rifle that shoots straight. These are serious people doing a deadly serious job. It&apos;s a difference they wear on their faces.

The Marines make this place different. Frivolous living takes away the edge; hard living makes hard men. They pay scant attention to creature comforts and don&apos;t &quot;waste&quot; precious assets on it. Why buy a billiard table for the Unit&apos;s rec room when you could spend the same dollars on another 20,000 rounds of 5.56 ammunition? Besides, anything necessary for living already was issued to them but the Corps. Officer and enlisted, their entire world packs away into just two duffle bags and a ruck sack.

Marines talk differently, too. It&apos;s a port, not a door, a deck not the floor and a head, not a toilet. Equipment or personal items aren&apos;t lost, they&apos;re adrift. It takes a bit of getting used to.

Most everything they do for recreation involves athletic competition (it enhances both fitness and Esprit de Corps). And the equipment list rarely is longer than a football and an open field or a volleyball and a net. It makes no difference that it&apos;s only a friendly game; they still play like their lives depended on it.

Here they fly the US flag. It always has been understood that Camp Victory was an Iraqi base, albeit with a large number of Americans residing on it. It would have been disrespectful to the &quot;landlords&quot; to fly an American flag there, so none were. The US flag was never flown on the installation where I lived in Honduras many moons ago, and for the same reason. There is no such concern for the host&apos;s sensibilities here. This was never a palatial compound. It was us -- the US -- who dislodged the terrorist vermin from this place and it is we who man this post. And here they fly Old Glory proudly.

Basically the entire camp is as safe as a typical police station. Camp Victory butts up against some outlying Baghdad neighborhoods so certain areas of the camp have locals living right outside the wall. And they sometimes toss &quot;surprises&quot; over that wall and into the compound.

Here at Camp Fallujah, on the other hand, the Marines have cleared back any semblance of vegetation or habitation for what seems like several hundred yards from the camp&apos;s outer wall. That cinderblock wall is pretty tall (I&apos;m guessing 11 or 12 feet) and this place is so flat that there are very few spots where you can stand on the ground and see anything beyond it. Where you &quot;can&quot; see past the wall, the most apropos image I can think of to describe it is Hiroshima after the bomb. The ground is barren and strewn with destroyed vehicles, both civilian and military. There is nothing there but desert and rusted hulks, a barren and desolate monochrome brown as far as you can see.

Marines man the numerous guard towers and scan the surrounding wasteland for anything approaching the camp. Anything that appears in that no man&apos;s land and looks to be headed toward the wall automatically is presumed to be hostile and reduced to just another piece of the lifeless landscape. It&apos;s a very stark image but it also is reassuring to know that none of the bad guys can get anywhere close to here without incurring the wrath of the bulldogs of the USMC. They guard their homes fiercely.

The PX here is the smallest I&apos;ve seen in Iraq. And come payday, the Marines descend on it like so many locusts. With that double-whammy, the shortages I&apos;ve seen elsewhere are even more widespread here. When we first got here, they were out of practically all the items I needed to set up housekeeping in my new swingin&apos; bachelor pad (aka &quot;bunker&quot;).

I wanted a reading lamp to replace the one I&apos;d abandoned when I left Camp Victory. The PX had the lamps but only 115 VAc light bulbs. The current here is 220VAc.

They were out of fly swatters. And brooms. And buckets. And mops, er swabs. And extension cords/power strips. But they did have an impressive selection of decorative Christmas lights.

When I moved in, my bunker... I mean my room... was filthy. There was dust a full quarter inch deep on the window sills. Not house dust but the brown stuff that passes for desert sand here. The walls and part of the ceiling were streaked with the same stuff. The room stank with the same earthen odor as a dust storm. Since this used to be a bath house, the obvious solution was just hose it down and swab it out. But the PX had no buckets. Or mops, er swabs. Or detergent (except liquid Dial hand soap).

It took us three days to find a mop and bucket that we could borrow from the Marines. Then it took my roommate and me a solid eight sweat-soaked hours to scrub the grime out of the room. We worked from top down, naturally, and by the time the floor had dried, there was dust settled on the window sills again.

Our site lead spends a lot of time trying to convince us it could be worse. If he&apos;s hoping to convince me, he&apos;s got quite a lot of ground yet to cover.

P.S.,
If you think the invasion of Iraq had nothing to do with the greater international war on terror, you need to come here and look around. This place was West Point for the Islamo-Fascist terrorist crowd. Saddam hosted training for all the major flavors of Muslim terrorism in this place, including Al Qa&apos;aida, the Taliban and the PLO. The dormitories and some of the military-style training facilities (obstacle courses, etc.) still are there. Some of the things I have seen here send chills down my spine because they are undeniable proof of the unholy terror that was grown here to be exported to the rest of the world. I think I understand the revulsion that the Allied liberators of the Nazi concentration camps at the end of WWII must have felt.

Eventually I will post pictures that I think are conclusive enough to sway all but the Kool-Aid drinking anti-war crowd that Saddam was growing an infectious disease here to be loosed on the Western world in general and the US in particular. One photo in particular shows a dormitory wall painted with an Iraqi flag and a Palestinian flag waving over an American eagle, beside which is written in Arabic, &quot;Death to America&quot;. That one shot pretty much says it all.If Chuckie Schumer or Cindy Sheehan or Teddy (hic!) Kennedy or any other of the anti-war moon bats were to come here, open their eyes and see what I&apos;ve seen, they&apos;d know better (thought I expect they&apos;d never admit it).

2/6 update

LtCol Scott Aiken, 2/6 Commander sends this update from the sandbox:


 I would like to reiterate that it is imperative for all friends and family members to maintain operational security. Please do not discuss any specific information over the phone or in letters, such as locations, troop movements, times, dates, etc. E-mails via the internet and chat rooms are non-secure sites that are easily compromised. Again, this is for the safety and welfare of all of the Marines, Sailors and Soldiers (both U.S. And Iraqi) of Task Force 2/6.

We have had several &quot;scrapes&quot; with the enemy this week. Our men and the Iraqi soldiers we are partnered with performed well; you should be proud!

The weather here is getting cooler but remains extremely dry. The country continues to observe the Islamic tradition of Ramadan, which will end in early November.

Thank you all for your support of 2/6. Your gifts of e-mails, letters, care packages, and words of inspiration and gratitude are crucial.

Have a happy halloween! 


2/6 is one of our Operation Santa battalions. If you&apos;d like to help by adopting a platoon or making a donation, e-mail operationsanta@marinecorpsmoms.com .

2/2 Marines - Commander&apos;s Update

Via Jarhead Dad, here&apos;s a battleground update from LtCol Minick, battalion commander for the Warlords of 2/2:

 Yesterday the government of Iraq declared a national holiday to further support the turnout for the Constitutional Referendum. Our Marines did not allow the insurgents to circumvent the Iraqis march towards democracy. As always, your Marines performed exceptionally. I am proud to be here as part of the Warlord family that helped this new country forge its path towards a new tomorrow.
Preparing for the elections was a tremendous task. The combined effort by the people of Iraq, the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI), and the Coalition Forces ensured the success of yesterday’s referendum. Our higher headquarters, the 2d Marine Expeditionary Force, planned extensively with the interim government. However, it was the IECI and interim government that determined the Marines would not be directly tasked with securing the individual polling sites. Instead, we were postured ready to respond to any incident within our area of operations (AO). The companies and the battalion staff worked diligently to prepare and organize our forces to accomplish this task. Their hard work executing disruption operations prior to the referendum and their continued active security patrols yesterday ensured a safe voting environment for the Iraqi people. Also, the 1-4-1 Iraqi Army and the newly created Karmah Police contributed to a peaceful referendum. Not only did they help secure the poll sites, but also they actively took part in their new democratic government by casting votes of their own. As you may know, our AO is predominately Sunni. During the January election, this segment of the Iraqi population stayed away from the polls. This was not the case yesterday. Your Marines and the Iraqi Security Forces have clearly gained the confidence of the citizens in Karmah and Nasser Wa Salaam. Regardless of the outcome, the choice was the Iraqis to make. The fate of their country is increasingly in their hands.

This historic election and promising future for the good people of Iraq did not come without a costly price. The Task Force suffered a tremendous loss. On the 6th of October our Warlords lost four of our bravest and best men. Cpl Cherava, LCpl Kenny, LCpl Frye, and PFC Cabino all from Golf Company, were going to the aid of their fellow Marines when an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacked them. Words cannot describe how much they meant to us, or the magnitude they will be missed. At this time, we can only pray for their families as they struggle with this tragic loss. Their death will not be in vain, and we will continue the mission that we started together, as they would have wished. We will bring freedom and peace to the people of Iraq, and we will honor their memory with our deeds.

The Marines continue to inspire me with their dedication and selfless service. I am fortunate to be surrounded by such men. Thank you all for your continued support of Task Force 2/2. We could not carry on with the mission without your letters, care packages, and words of inspiration and gratitude. Every day brings a new opportunity to preserve the freedom of a democratic Iraq. The Warlords are honored to have this opportunity, and I am humbled to lead them. Have a happy Halloween.

I remain Semper Fidelis,

James J Minick

America&apos;s military as first responder

Following natural disasters, the world looks to the United States to help out. After the tsunami last winter, our military spent weeks ferrying supplies, coordinating logistics, and being a friend to the people who have experienced devastation. The photo below shows the cargo bay of a C-17 en route to Pakistan from Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan. Our military presence in Afghanistan provided a head start on providing food, water, medicine, and blankets for Pakistanis affected by the earthquake.
 U.S. Air Force photo by Capt. James H. Cunningham 
From SPC Claude Flowers at Centcom , here&apos;s a description of current efforts in Pakistan:

 A United States Air Force C-17 delivered the first relief supplies here within 48 hours of the devastating earthquake that has left thousands dead and thousands more injured and displaced.
The aircraft and its crew from the 7th Airlift Squadron, McChord Air Force Base, Wash., delivered 12 pallets - weighing almost 90,000 pounds - of food, water, medicine and blankets from Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan.

With only a few hours notice, Airmen and soldiers at Bagram, successfully worked to palletize the humanitarian relief supplies and prepare them for the flight. Three aerial port specialists were also on the flight to coordinate and manage the cargo once it arrived at Islamabad.

 &quot;This was a total team effort,&quot; said Col. Mike Isherwood, 455th Air Expeditionary Wing Vice Commander. &quot;Our hearts go out to all those affected by the earthquake and we are thankful we were able to help out.&quot; 

Pakistan Army Brig. Gen. Imtiaz Sherazi, director of logistics, is coordinating the relief efforts as supplies arrive and ensuring rapid distribution of assistance to areas that need it most.

Said General Sherazi, &quot;These items are very valuable to us because there are lots of people in great distress.&quot; 

As relief efforts are ongoing worldwide, United States Central Command will continue to identify and provide additional capabilities for airborne reconnaissance, heavy lift ground equipment, medical support, shelters, rations and water to aid and assist the people of Pakistan.

The kids of Iraq
 Photo by Cpl. Ken Melton LCpl John Anderson, deployed with 3/25 Marines, with 4-year old Afooie. 

When my son was interviewed by the local paper last summer while home on leave, he was asked what he enjoyed most about being in Iraq. Without hesitation, he answered, &quot;the kids - they&apos;re just like kids anywhere&quot;. When the reporter asked for details, he mentioned setting up observation posts inside local homes and spending 24 hour or so with the family. During that time, they&apos;d play with the children and show the &quot;no better friend&quot; side of the Marine Corps to the adults.

Here&apos;s a story about 3/25 Marines in Hit who take much the same approach.

 While patrolling through the city of Hit, Marines with 1st Platoon, K Company, 3rd Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment decided to rest in a nearby house to escape the sweltering heat.
After asking permission to enter the house, the residents were nervous and unsure of their visitors&apos; intentions. The smallest member of the household, though, approached the Marines and began to question and eventually played with them.

The Marines, impressed by the child&apos;s courage answered his questions and responded playfully with him. After awhile, the 4-year-old child named Afooie left and later returned with his other playmates to introduce them to his new friends.

 &quot;It was a relief from our day-to-day actions just to play with them,&quot; said 23-year-old Lance Cpl. John W. Anderson, an assistant team leader with 3rd squad. &quot;It reminded us what we were over here for.&quot; 

An hour later, the Marines were once again back on their patrol, though the child and his parents asked them to stay awhile longer.

 &quot;They seemed sad that we had to leave, but we had a job to do,&quot; the Delmont, Penn., native said.

A few days later, his squad was in the same area so they decided to visit their friends again.

Upon approaching the house, they were instantly recognized by Afooie, who greeted them and then ran off to retrieve his other friends.

 &quot;Most of the Marines have younger family members back home and when they interact with these children it&apos;s like they&apos;re back home,&quot; the 2001 Franklin Regional High School graduate said. &quot;Not only that, but it also gets the citizens used to having military personnel in the area.&quot; 

Since then, they have seen a positive change in the adults&apos; attitudes in the area. Most admit they were scared to walk the streets because of the insurgents and now feel safer because the Multi-National Forces are in the area.

Some even provide the Marines information about unusual activity and invite them to stay in their homes when they are on patrol.

 &quot;People are upset that the insurgents are killing civilians in their attempt to hurt us,&quot; said Painesville, Ohio, native, Sgt. Peter J. Rivera, a squad leader with 3rd Platoon. &quot;People understand that we are here to help and it makes these guys feel good that they are making a difference.&quot; 

The squad, along with the Iraqi Security Force, visits Afooie and his friends when they are patrolling in the area. When on these patrols, they often carry toys, hygiene items and candy for their young friends.

 &quot;By doing little things like this, they are helping the country by befriending the younger generation who in years to come will view the military as friends,&quot; said Rivera, a 33-year-old father of four children and 1990 Harvey High School graduate. &quot;When they get older they will help us help their country.&quot;

1/2 prepares for future deployment

LtCol &quot;Drew&quot; Smith sends this update for families and friends of his 1/2 Marines:

 Greetings to the families and friends of Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, Second Marines. At the time of the last update, the BLT was embarked aboard amphibious shipping and was fully engaged in the execution of the Expeditionary Strike Group Exercise (ESGEX). I am pleased to report that the exercise went extremely well with each company displaying very sound integration with our US Navy counterparts and demonstrating excellence in their core capabilities as each responded to simulated real-world contingencies. It is worth noting that the completion of the ESGEX represents a significant step in the BLT&apos;s overall pre-deployment training schedule. We now have our sights set on the Certification Exercise, or CERTEX; another combined “at-sea” and ground training evolution that will begin in mid-September and will carry through to the first week of October. It is during this exercise that the BLT will be formally evaluated in its ability to execute special operations and conventional missions as the Ground Combat Element (GCE) of 22 MEU. The CERTEX has all the makings of being a very demanding and rewarding training evolution. The BLT has worked very hard up to this point and in a wide variety of areas to increase its tactical proficiency and enhance its overall ability to successfully accomplish assigned missions. I have complete confidence that the superb team of Marines and Sailors that comprise BLT 1/2 will aggressively meet and exceed mission objectives. I look forward to sharing the many stories of mission success with you in mid October.
My hope is that the Labor Day Holiday offered a time for our Marines, Sailors and families to relax and enjoy a few days away from the training schedule. It is worth noting that the BLT, as the Air Contingency Battalion (ACB), had increased its alert posture briefly over the Labor Day Weekend in anticipation of supporting aid and recovery operations in New Orleans, LA. In the end, a fellow infantry battalion from here in Camp Lejeune was directed to deploy to New Orleans area, thus allowing the BLT and 22 MEU to continue its training schedule and prepare for the up and coming deployment. The BLT remains the ACB; however, it along with the other elements of 22 MEU will not deploy in support of the disaster relief operations in and around New Orleans.

I want to add my personal &quot;thanks&quot; to all for the safe conduct of the holiday period. As you might suspect, longer holiday weekends allow for personnel to travel longer distances to see family and friends than what can be executed on regular weekends. As the Commanding Officer, I take great reward in seeing my Marines and Sailors enjoying well-deserved time off with family and friends. I can understand that I am also greatly relieved when my commanders report to me that they have recovered all their personnel safely after any liberty period, and particularly after a long holiday weekend. It is during the latter periods that personnel will often attempt to drive longer distances, at times with increased speed, in order to maximize the time with friends and loved ones. I have also found that some of our younger warriors tend to press the envelope in recreational activities. Speed, fatigue and mixing driving and recreational activities with alcohol continue to be the primary factors in injury and death to Marines and Sailors. Before my Marines and Sailors depart for the weekend, they are exposed to several different operational risk management (ORM) initiatives, ranging from safety briefs to vehicle safety inspections, and review of travel plans should they be traveling in their personal automobile. Leaders within the BLT are pressing home the message of safety in all that we do. I humbly ask that moms and dads, brothers, sisters and friends help us reinforce to our service members the importance of safe and responsible conduct while on liberty. The strength of this BLT rests in the health and readiness, faithful service and professional contributions of each of its members. The contributions to that end by our families and friends located in hometowns are invaluable. Please keep up the great work.

The first and second week of September will find the BLT engaged in a variety of activities in preparation for the CERTEX and the impending deployment. The list of requirements and events is long and varied and ranges from a detailed maintenance inspection, enhanced rifle marksmanship training, medical and dental readiness, to instruction on ship-board fire fighting and thorough administrative review of individual&apos;s service records including updating of wills, powers of attorney and record of emergency data. We will be leaning forward in completing these very important requirements so that our Marines and Sailors can return from a successful CERTEX in early October, clean and ready their weapons and equipment for the deployment, and then ready themselves for a well-deserved pre-deployment leave period.

With regard to the pre-deployment leave period, I envision the BLT being authorized to take leave from the 12th to the 31st of October. At this writing, I know of no circumstances, or contingencies that would prevent leave from occurring during the aforementioned period. I will add that there is always the possibility of developing real-world requirements impacting the leave period, so I would ask that you maintain good communication with your service member to receive any updates. For now, &quot;it looks good&quot; for the 12-31 October. Specific guidance will be provided to the Marines and Sailors on when they will be authorized to depart on the 12th and when they will be expected to be physically back and accounted for in the BLT area on the 31st.

Finally, I want to extend my most sincere thanks to two groups; the ladies that make up the BLT 1/2 Key Volunteer Network and our families. The first group plays an integral role in the overall readiness of this organization. This group of over thirty ladies - spouses of our Marines and Sailors - serve as a conduit of information and referrals for assistance for both our married and single personnel. The second group, our families deserve the utmost appreciation for supporting their respective Marine or Sailor while they serve our great nation. &quot;Thanks for all you do.&quot;

Until next time, &quot;best regards to all.&quot; 


1/2 Battalion is comprised of three rifle companies, a weapons company, and a headquarters company. They arereinforced by a variety of forces from throughout the 2nd MARDIV, including tanks, assault amphibian vehicles, combat engineers, etc. Collectively, the reinforced battalion is referred to as a Battalion Landing Team.

New Orleans Marines ride out the hurricane

When Hurricane Katrina hit, the base in New Orleans was evacuated and most Marines headed for higher - and dryer - ground, Staff Sgt. Matthew J. Davis and Sgt. Lorenzo L. Edwards were the only Marines among 25 troops who volunteered to remain behind at the Naval Air Station, watching the storm from a supply bay.

 &quot;I have been through typhoons in Okinawa, Japan, but this was worse than anything I ever saw there,&quot; said Davis, 3/23 electronics maintenance chief.

 &quot;I volunteered because I knew my family was out of harm&apos;s way and I could be more useful here,&quot; said Edwards, a mechanic. &quot;Growing up in Alabama, I have been through many hurricanes, so I knew what to expect.&quot; 


As soon as the winds died down, they went to work clearing the Coast Guard landing zones of debris and fallen trees so that search and rescue operations could begin. Next, they loaded seven ton trucks with essentials - food, water, fuel and other supplies - for those in need. The troops ran multiple convoys each day and were, at the time, the only supply force on the west side of the river. In their spare time, they welcomed Marines from the 24th MEU, setting them up with work space and billets.

 &quot;We helped in any way we could to get (the MEU) set up,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;We gave them information on what was happening on and off base to provide them with better situational awareness.&quot; 

 &quot;I take pride in not only helping as a Marine, but as a resident of this community,&quot; Davis said.

2/7 Update from Fallujah

Lt Col JA L&apos;Etoile included this reflection in his latest letter to the families of his 2/7 Marines:

 Our sacrifices are not without gain. Every day the citizens of Fallujah are one step closer to self determination. The city is vibrant with reconstruction and the terrorists are finding our area of operations tougher and tougher to operate in. We have been successful in taking a number of the enemy off the streets and we have uncovered a considerable amount of weapons, explosives and other contraband. Each one of these events prevents violent acts of terrorism. Additionally, our partners in the Iraqi Army continue to make great strides.
We are no longer the new Marines and Sailors on the block here in Fallujah. The 2nd Bn, 2nd Marines arrived recently and have taken their position on our flank. It&apos;s hard to believe that most of us have been here 55 days already. Regardless, there is much work left to be done. As the political and military events of Iraq play out you can rest assured that your loved ones are in the best company possible, the company of their fellow Marines and Sailors. Together we will accomplish what our Nation asks, and return to our loved ones.

Semper Fidelis

2/7 update from Fallujah
 The families of 2/7 Marines showed their support as 2/7 Marines deployed from 29 Palms last month. Here&apos;s the most recent update from LtCol L&apos;Etoile .
 The last of the 3rd Bn, 4th Marines has left and will be returning to 29 Palms any day. We now own our little chunk of Iraq and we are working hard to make it a better place. Our priorities right now are to learn the city, its people, and to gain a better understanding of the unique problems that we face. Fallujah and its surrounds are a complicated operational environment. At any given time our Marines are the cop on the street, ambassadors of America, combat troops, and general problem solvers for the Iraqi people. They are doing a great job. 
We have already established very good working, and in some cases personal, relationships with our partners in the Iraqi Army. The Marines understand how important the development of the Iraqi Army is to the success of our mission. For this reason, the majority of the patrolling and post standing that we do is in conjunction with the Iraqi soldiers. It is very encouraging to see our young Marines picking up key Arabic Phrases and the young Iraqi soldiers expressing themselves in English. In most cases the most productive thing I can do toward building the Marine and Iraqi Army partnership is to put our young men together with the Iraqis and then get out of the way.

The rebuilding of the city continues at an encouraging pace. Everywhere you go there are piles of bricks and sand and hundreds of builders putting Fallujah back together. We have a long way to go before the wounds of terrorism and war are healed over, but our Nation&apos;s investment in Iraq is present everywhere you look, to include in the smiles of most of the Fallujahns.

In my mind we have completed the first phase of our tour in Iraq, namely our deployment and settling to our battlespace. We have found our stride and we are getting better and better and finding our enemy and his caches of weapons. We have had some great early successes working with the Iraqi Army, and we are gaining the respect of the Fallujans one patrol and one Marine at a time. I am very proud of all our Marines and Sailors.

We miss all of you and appreciate the support from the folks back home. You remain in our thoughts and prayers.

2/7 War Dawgs arrive in Fallujah

2/7 has arrived in Iraq - here&apos;s the first update from LtCol L&apos;Etoile:

 Friends and families of the 2nd Bn, 7th Marines,
We have arrived safe and sound and are currently conducting a relief in place with the 3rd Bn, 4th Marines in and around Fallujah. Soon we will be arrayed throughout our area of operations conducting counter insurgency operations and developing the Iraqi Security Forces. 3/4 is doing a great job showing us the ropes and setting us up for success. Lt Col Kennedy and the Marines of 3/4 have performed magnificently and should be proud of what they have accomplished in this troubled city. Much work remains to be done, but the foundations for success have been laid and 2/7 is up to the challenge.

The movement to Iraq could not have gone smoother. The operations and logistics Marines of the Bn (S-3 and S-4) flawlessly planned and executed the movement of nearly 1000 Marines and our gear halfway around the world and delivered us to our Forward Operating Base here at Camp Mercury without a hitch. Of course it was the SNCOs of the battalion, as it always is, who ensured we arrived with all of our gear, organized, and ready to operate. I could not be prouder of our Senior Enlisted leaders.

The Marines are in exceptionally high spirits and I have never seen a more cohesive and energetic team. Our small unit leaders have prepared our Marines well, the Marines are good and they know it! Certainly there are challenges ahead, but none that we cannot handle.

If you have not heard from your Marine please understand. A relief in place of one battalion by another is a very busy time. Additionally, two battalions are currently swamping any phone and internet services available. Soon your loved ones will have time to catch their breath and write a letter, send an e-mail, or place a phone call. Until then, know that you are all in our hearts and that we look forward to your letters and e-mails.

Semper Fidelis
Lt Col JA L&apos;Etoile

Greetings from 26th MEU

Here&apos;s the message that Col. Tom Qualls sent to the family and friends of his Marines:

 Friends and family of the 26th MEU,
All&apos;s well here out on the edge-the edge of the sword. Busy, but doin&apos; well. The Marines/Sailors of the 26th MEU (SOC) are presently employed in eight different countries throughout the Central Command Area of Responsibility. We trust ya&apos;ll are enjoying the festivities of the 4th of July as we defend the principles of the 4th from far away.
To give you a vague glimpse of what we are up to: you&apos;ve got Marines/Sailors providing counter-terrorist training to foreign military forces in a nearby nation that will enable them to react to terrorist incidents better on their own; you&apos;ve got Marines/Sailors conducting security reinforcements in another nation; in our biggest operational thrust to date, you&apos;ve got Marines/Sailors performing recon/intelligence/surveillance ops deep in another country; here at sea we have Marines and machines who are working to defend critical economic areas and points of interest; and rounding out the many countries we are operating in, we have numerous logistical Marines scattered ashore at sites keeping the 2,134 Marines/Sailors of the MEU supplied with beans, bullets and band aids.

While just a few of us will have the chance to celebrate, most will not. We are pretty busy operating, planning, and controlling today&apos;s, tomorrow&apos;s and next month&apos;s events. We have many opportunities to have an impact in our remaining months here. Rest assured though, each of us is appreciative of the support you are providing while we are supporting our nation, our &quot;One Nation Under God, with Liberty and Justice for all.&quot;

Today and tonight, think of us as the children laugh and play, and as the fireworks explode high above in a starlit sky. We will be thinking of you too knowing you are celebrating the very freedoms we are defending on this special day. You are helping us make a difference.

See ya soon. Happy Independence Day!

Semper Fidelis,
Colonel Tom Qualls

3/25 passes the halfway point and reminds us that &quot;You can&apos;t stop the clock&quot;

H&amp;S;Company sends this report:

 Hello again to all the friends and families of 3\25. The past two months have continued to be demanding for each Marine and the Company as a whole. Fortunately the pace only makes the time seem to move faster as they have little time to sit idle and think about home. They don&apos;t seem to mind the pace though. The oft-heard mantra of &quot;You can&apos;t stop the clock&quot; is getting louder. Sprits went up this month as we officially crested the halfway point of the in-country deployment.
The weather is pretty warm now with temperatures consistently above 100 degrees. A dip below 90 degrees would probably trigger hypothermia. It&apos;s dust and wind season here as well. Although all we notice is the view from the top of the dam changes everyday.

It&apos;s been amazing to watch the company adapt to new challenges each day. The intense multi discipline training the Marines accomplished in California prepared them well for the multitude of demands unique to this conflict. Most work within their specialties each day, but when the need arises they&apos;ve proven their skills serving with mobile patrols, quick reaction forces, observation posts, and unfortunately corpsmen. They know now, that together, they can accomplish anything.

The future of Iraq is upon us now as we move to integrate with the newly developing Iraqi Army. Marines in Hit were already working with the old ING (Iraqi National Guard) - since dissolved, but they are about to receive a company that will be based with them. The importance of working along side the [Iraqi] soldiers is not lost on the Marines. These will be [Iraqi] soldiers that assume our duties sometime in the future. The future of Iraq is ultimately in their hands.

Operations continue on constant roll, as most of you are probably aware of from watching the news. What is typically hard to grasp from the media is the breadth of success we see during the operations. Again the training has paid off as the Marines negotiate rooting out the insurgents while protecting the innocent people of Iraq. The daily take of weapons caches and detainees is constant while the professionalism of the Marines has won the respect of countless civilians. The task at hand is typically difficult and stressful yet the Marines confidence and resolve is unwavering.

There is no doubt that the pride that keeps the Company moving is bolstered by the support of our friends and families back home. The continuous e-mail contact, letters and care packages keep the Marines connected with a familiar outside world. They are constantly reminded of who they are, where they came from and why they are here.
I am once again at a loss to describe just how proud I am of your sons, husbands and fathers. They are truly an inspiration to all.

4th of July at Al Asad
 Members of the Al Asad joint service color guard post the colors during the Independence Day observance here, July 4. Photo and story details by: Cpl. C. Alex Herron 
Here&apos;s a glimpse of Independence Day at Al Asad in Iraq where Marines gathered to celebrate in one of the world&apos;s newest democracies. Cpl. Alex Herron was there - here&apos;s what he observed:

 Following its adoption in July 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read to the public in various American cities. Whenever it was heard, patriots erupted in cheer and celebration.
In 1777, a year after John Hancock, the President of the 2nd Continental Congress, signed the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphians remembered the 4th of July with ringing bells, firing guns, lighting candles, and setting off fireworks.

When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, July 4 became a holiday in only certain places around the country. In Boston, it replaced the date of the Boston Massacre, March 5, as its major patriotic holiday. Speeches, military events, parades and fireworks marked the day. In 1941, Congress declared July 4 a federal holiday.

The second president, John Adams, would have approved. &quot;I believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival,&quot; he wrote his wife, Abigail. &quot;It ought to be celebrated by pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other...&quot; 

For Marines serving in Iraq there may not be pomp or parades, but the holiday was celebrated during an Independence Day observance here.

 &quot;It is important to celebrate and not forget the importance of the Fourth of July,&quot; said Cmdr. Ron Brown, command chaplain for the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing here. Following the sentiments of a fellow chaplain, Brown said, &quot;Millions of people have served the armed forces in our country, but billions of people around the world have reaped the benefits of those service members.&quot; 

The observance was highlighted by guest speaker, Col. John T. Rahm, the chief of staff for the forward deployed 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, who spoke on the importance of preserving freedom for everyone in the world.

Rahm, who grew up near Valley Forge, Penn., and spent his childhood visiting Carpenters Hall and the Liberty Bell, began with a brief history of how Thomas Jefferson and the other committee members put together their draft of the Declaration. Rahm further explained how Jefferson and John Adams had an argument and eventually decided Jefferson would write the rough draft of the historic document.

After the brief history and some interesting trivia, Rahm got to his main point. He highlighted for those gathered the difference between the rough draft written by Jefferson and the final product we know today.

&quot; In Thomas Jefferson’s original draft of the Declaration of Independence he wrote, ‘all men are created equal and independent and from that equal creation they derive in rights inherent and inalienables, among which are the preservation of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,’&quot; Rahm said. &quot;When the Continental Congress made their changes they took out ‘the preservation of…’ and just made it simply &apos;among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&apos;&quot; 

 &quot;Well I agree with Jefferson his words were better,&quot; Rahm said. &quot;We have preserved life and liberty. We have the right to be here in Iraq, Nicaragua, Grenada, Vietnam and Afghanistan.&quot; 

Serving in Iraq during this prestigious holiday is an honor for the service members here.

 &quot;I feel like I am fulfilling Thomas Jefferson’s words,&quot; the Valley Forge, area native said. &quot;We have the right to preserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; 

 &quot;When we first celebrated our Independence we were in a struggle to maintain our own freedoms,&quot; Brown said. &quot;And now we are doing the same. We are helping the Iraqi people gain and maintain the freedoms we have enjoyed for our entire lives.&quot; 

The Marines, sailors, soldiers and airmen deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on the Fourth of July are fighting a similar battle to the one fought more than 200 years ago. Although not fighting for their own freedom, service members here are fighting for the ideals Jefferson had intended in 1776; to preserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all.

26 MEU - why training is critical in the WOT

Here&apos;s an update to friends and especially family members of the 26th MEU from Col. Tom Qualls, Commanding Officer:

 The big ship pulled into port today. It&apos;s good to be back in Bahrain again. Believe it or not, we have Marines in 8 different countries as of today! This week we deployed another major training effort ashore into a foreign country.
 Training is critical in the War on Terrorism in enhancing other nations&apos; ability to fight terrorism and to deal with contingencies on their own, without US assistance. This latest ashore event is focused on that segment. Our entry into other nations give us the opportunity to show goodwill and to demonstrate that our nation, our Marines/Sailors, and our people are trustworthy and cordial as well as fully capable to assist them raising their response capability. 

Next week we will launch another operational thrust, this the largest of our many. First, before we do that, we have more detailed planning to accomplish while in port; and, we need to gather up at least 2 other planning teams that were away for the past week.

So there will be work to be done in port, but we will have a small amount of down time too. The need for balance will once again be very real---balance between down time and the need for professional attention to the combat preparations that are ahead of us.

Hey, we are at the mid-point in the deployment! Keep the cards, emails, and care packages coming...and remember your Marines are going to need your continued support all the way to the finish line....which is still expected to be on time. Speaking of mail: Yes, mail has been delayed---but that&apos;s to be expected; the good news is that 18,000 pounds of mail is expected to be on-loaded today. That should be exciting!

Hope everyone is enjoying their Summer! See ya&apos; in the Fall!

Semper Fidelis,
Colonel Tom Qualls

The Three Rules of War

Letters home from our military heroes in Iraq and Afghanistan describe the reality of combat from those who experience it with stunning clarity. Col. Brett Wyrick, Commander of the 154th Medical Group, Hawaii Air National Guard, is currely deployed as a surgeon in Balad with the 332nd Expeditionary Medical Group. He recently wrote a letter home to his father, describing the valiant efforts of a top-notch group of medical professionals to save the life of a young soldier. Read the letter in full here. I thought his closing thoughts were a wonderful reminder of the price paid by heroes throughout the centuries so that we can enjoy a carefree holiday weekend. And, unfortunately, some will enjoy it without putting overmuch thought into the men and women who have made it possible.

Col Wyrick&apos;s letter:

 The first rule of war is that young men and women die. The second rule of war is that surgeons cannot change the first rule. I think the third rule of war should be that those who have given their all for our freedom are never forgotten, and they are always honored.
I wish there was not a war, and I wish our young people did not have to fight and die. But I cannot wish away evil men like Bin Laden and al-Zarqawi. These men are not wayward children who have gone astray; they are not great men who are simply misunderstood.

These are cold-blooded killers and they will kill you, me, and everyone we love and hold dear if we do not kill them first. You cannot reason with these people, you cannot negotiate with these people, and this war will not be over until they are dead. That is the ugly, awful, and brutal truth.

I wish the situation was different, but it is not. Americans have two choices. They can run from the threat, deny it exists, candy-coat it, debate it, and hope it goes away. And then, Americans will be fair game around the world and slaughtered by the thousands for the sheep they have become.

Our second choice is to crush these evil men where they live and for us to have the political will and courage to finish what we came over here to do.

The last thing we need here in Iraq is an exit strategy or some damn timetable for withdrawal. Thank God there was no timetable for withdrawal after the Battle of the Bulge or Iwo Jima. Thank God there was no exit strategy at Valley Forge. Freedom is not easy, and it comes with a terrible price - I saw the bill here yesterday.

The third rule of war should be that we never forget the sacrifices made by our young men and women, and we always honor them. We honor them by finishing what they came to accomplish. We remember them by never quitting and having the backbone and the guts to never bend to the yoke of oppression.

We honor them and remember them by having the courage to live free.
 


Thank you, soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who protect and defend us so that we can live free. May we never forget the sacrifice of this brave soldier and the hundreds of thousand of other troops who have bled and died in the name of freedom.

26th MEU is on their way

From Col. Tom Qualls, CO of the 26th MEU:

 Many thanks for the Father&apos;s day gifts that have flowed into us in the past several days/weeks. This Father&apos;s Day finds many of your father&apos;s, sons, brothers, nephews, and even future fathers hard at work in the conduct of yet another intensive operational pulse-this one into yet another country that will bring new adventure and challenges to the Marine/Sailor team.

This foray will be a training thrust and will prove to be exciting and full of adventure, and quite a bit of hard work in some quite austere conditions. Your Marines/Sailors, as always, are fully ready for this challenge.

Perhaps once this exercise is over we will be able to reveal where it is located, and more details as to what we are doing. In the meantime, thanks for bearing with me in this journey which many times takes both you and us into the unknown.

We appreciate your continued support. Rest assured your Marines aboard the Kearsarge are ready for our huge responsibility as the Theater Strategic Reserve. We are ready too for even more operational employment, in a multitude of locations across the Central Command Area of Responsibility.

We had a great, motivating visit by our Commandant of the Marine Corps the other day. While here he had a chance to visit Marines on all three ships, and to speak and answer questions on the current and future state of our Corps. He thanked us Marines for what we are doing, while at the same time thanked you--the families--for all that you do to support the cause. He also made time to snap photos with your Marines; perhaps you&apos;ve already seen many of those images. A good day.

Happy Father&apos;s Day to all the dad&apos;s and grand dads at home. And, again thanks to all for making our Father&apos;s Day here a special one. The pillow cases are real winners. Photos of your Marines and their cases will be posted in the days ahead.

Semper Fidelis,
Colonel Tom Qualls

3/3 Marines are coming home, leaving the Kunar Province &quot;one step closer to freedom&quot;


Captain Sweeney from India company recaps the last seven months:

 The Kunar province has undergone many changes in the 7 months India Company has been on the ground here. In Nagalam, 1stLt Bellman and GySgt Vannelli have turned a small Special Forces advanced camp into a full-blown Forward Operating Base capable of accommodating a reinforced rifle platoon and a company of Afghan Security Force soldiers. They have built several buildings from the ground up improving the operational capability and the quality of life on board the camp. If you can remember early on, phone calls and emails from the Marines of 2d platoon were non-existent. Camp Blessing now has full commercial and military Internet capability, phones, washers and dryers, an outstanding gym facility, chow hall and many other improvements. Quite honestly, living at Camp Blessing has become a rather pleasant experience compared to what it used to be like back in November and December. The Marines of 1st and 2d Platoons who have been residents there should be commended for their hard work aboard the camp. They accomplished all of this without slowing down their operational tempo &quot;outside the wire.&quot; The Pech District, where Camp Blessing is located, was once compared to the &quot;Wild West,&quot; but because of the Marines dedication to the mission, the security in the region has greatly increased. The schools are full, new mosques, medical clinics and district administration buildings are in place and the area is one step closer to freedom.

Throughout the province the Marines and Sailors have touched thousands of Afghan citizens lives. We have provided humanitarian assistance in the form of food, blankets, tools, medical supplies, and many other assistance items. All of the Marines have worked closely with the Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army training and conducting joint operations. Their efforts have improved the individual and unit skills of the two forces, making them much more effective and ensuring the security of the people in the province well into the future. Their experiences here will be remembered for years to come, they have truly made history. The Marines will have some great stories to tell of their exploits in Afghanistan so in a few short weeks, sit back and enjoy.
 


Here&apos;s a significant event that happened in April but I don&apos;t recall seeing it in print before. It&apos;s a sign that the times, they are a&apos;changing and that the future looks bright for the people of Afghanistan.

 A former insurgent commander swore allegiance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan April 14 in Asadabad, agreeing to turn in his weapons and cease hostilities against Afghan and Coalition forces. As Coalition forces have been hunting near the Afghan-Pakistani border for insurgent leaders, Najmuddin turned himself in to Company I, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, abandoning his run as one of the more elusive insurgent leaders.
The Marines were informed by a message received the morning of April 10 explaining where the commander was located and his intent. The company leadership quickly moved to the designated location and, crossing over a bridge into the compound, finally came face-to-face with the man they were able to recognize only from an outdated photograph. He has been allowed to participate in the Allegiance Program, a program currently offered to Taliban and Hezb-E Islami Gulbuddin fighters who wish to stop fighting and start participating in the rebuilding of Afghanistan.

 &quot;We&apos;ve been working on this guy for a long time,&quot; said 1st Lt. Justin Bellman, India Co. Executive Officer. &quot;It was just a matter of time before either we captured him, killed him or he turned himself in. He made the right decision and we&apos; re going to hope that he becomes a positive force in his community.&quot;

A ceremony which was attended by nearly 300 civic and religious leaders from across the Kunar province was the first step in the process of repatriation for Najmuddin who explained his reasons for turning himself over to the Marines through an interpreter. &quot;I am tired of running,&quot; said the former insurgent. &quot;I realized that my community was suffering because of [our] attacks on the Coalition and I did not want that any more.&quot; 

His participation in the Allegiance Program comes on the heels of extensive operations around the areas Najmuddin was known to frequent in the Pech Valley. Aggressively pursuing the detention of insurgent leadership in the area afforded Marines the success that had eluded other units.

 &quot;This individual orchestrated several attacks against Coalition forces before we got here and began to conduct attacks against us in Nagalam from the moment we arrived. It did not take us long to let him know that we were not going to sit back and take that,&quot; said Lt. Col. Norm Cooling, commander of 3rd Bn., 3rd Marines. &quot;Instead we took the fight to his backyard, to the difficult, cold and mountainous terrain of the Korangal Valley.&quot; The Marines of India Company, once tasked with eliminating the threat Najmuddin posed to stability in the area, applied constant pressure on him for two and a half months.

 &quot;In that time, he didn&apos;t have time to conduct attacks against our installations,&quot; said Cooling. &quot;He was too busy trying to survive and he finally got tired of it.&quot; While he said the constant presence of well-trained Marines was the ultimate reason he turned himself in, it was also the humanitarian outreach and rehabilitation projects in his area that Marines participated in that convinced the former insurgent leader to come forth.

Bellman, who spoke with Najmuddin, said he expressed happiness with many of the good things he saw the Marines doing in the Pech Valley and that he knew his area was improving because of the Afghan and Coalition forces.

The governor of Kunar, Asadollah Wafa, said the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan hopes the program will put an end to local insurgencies and further drive a wedge between Afghans and the foreign-national terrorists who have been operating in Afghanistan. By accepting former insurgent &quot;middlemen&quot; like Najmuddin, he hopes that the money and support that keeps the insurgency alive in eastern Afghanistan will dry up.

The Allegiance Program is an effort to bring many formerly prominent Afghans back into the fold of the new government, Wafa said. As long as an individual has committed no crimes against humanity, he may get a second chance at citizenship.

&quot;Be proud of them...they do great things for the right reasons&quot;

The HMM-162 (Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron-162) has landed and the situation is well in hand. LtCol Diehl updates the friends and families of this Aviation Combat Element:



 It&apos;s been a little over two months since we departed Eastern North Carolina for Operations in the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Operations (AO) and, as most of you probably know, the preponderance of the ACE is now in Kuwait.

Over the past couple of weeks the Rotary Wing Marines of the ACE have been operating from the Udairi Training Area while our Fixed Wing and Intermediate Maintenance Level Marines continue to support operations from aboard the USS Kearsarge....it&apos;s all part of distributed operations...more on that later.

While at the Udairi Range we continue to train and enhance our desert operational proficiency. We&apos;ve been able to take advantage of some excellent live fire ranges here with both Rotary Wing from the land, and Fixed Wing from the sea.

Additionally, the living conditions at both locations are not too bad either. Life on the boat has been made more comfortable because our &quot;feet-wet&quot; Marines and equipment can stretch out a bit due to their squadron mates and ground mates being &quot;feet-dry&quot;.....more space...shorter lines...better living. Those of us on the beach can&apos;t complain either.

We&apos;re living in tents but there&apos;s air-conditioning to ward off the daily 110-degree temperatures and the dining facility stocks Baskin Robbins ice cream, which the Marines tell me is only being consumed to regulate their core body temperatures. There&apos;s also a coffee shop, a fast-food restaurant, and even a PX...small, but it offers some of the things the Marines&amp;Sailors miss from home...so life at Udairi is not too bad either.

As the CENTCOM Theatre Reserve, the 26th MEU remains on-call for any mission within the AO. That means we will continue to conduct sea-based operations from the USS Kearsarge for the foreseeable future. The ACE has conducted operations in Iraq over the past week and will likely continue to do so in the weeks ahead. However, as the Theatre Reserve we remain ready to depart our current location on a moments notice to answer the call for assistance anywhere from Afghanistan to the Horn of Africa.

The MEU and ACE are very flexible organizations that are designed to conduct operations from one location, or we can task organize and conduct missions from separate locations....&quot;distributed operations&quot;. It is likely some of your Marines and Sailors will have the opportunity to go forward with elements of the MEU to conduct distributed operations as part of a military to military engagement program our government has with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Others will remain aboard USS Kearsarge to either stand ready as the Theatre Reserve, or continue to conduct operations within Iraq.

Your Marines&amp;Sailors will have the opportunity to work from various locations both &quot;feet-wet&quot; and &quot;feet-dry&quot;. We all will participate in bringing the awesome capabilities of the combined Marine Expeditionary Unit and Expeditionary Strike Group to bear within the CENTCOM AO. Your Marines and Sailors stand ready for the challenges they will face shortly. They are trained, equipped, and continue to function as a tightly organized team...each member more concerned with the well-being and success of the Marine or Sailor on his left or right...then for themselves.

Be proud of them...they do great things for the right reasons. As always, take care of one another&amp;know you are always in our hearts and minds.

Semper Fi,
LtCol Kurt &quot;BIG&quot; Diehl

&quot;We pray for the soldiers every night.&quot;

Michael Yon is a writer currently travelling in the Kurdish area of Dohuk, Iraq. During a visit to the village of Yezdinar, Yon asked the Headman of the village a simple question:

 An Iraqi. A Kurd. A Yezidi. A village Headman. Whatever the label, more than forty years after his birth, this man came home. Only now, after the latest war, does Mr. Qatou finally have confidence in the peace, after more than a half century of life lived under orders or under sentence.
This seemed like the moment to ask the question, &quot;What do you think of the United States?&quot; 

 &quot;We cry when America loses one soldier. We pray for the soldiers every night.&quot; 

Many Kurds had expressed the same sentiment. One had said poetically: &quot;For every drop of American blood, we shed one thousand Kurdish tears.&quot; 

 &quot;What do you think about the United Kingdom?&quot; I asked.

 &quot;Also very good.&quot; 

His answer for some of the other countries, those that abandoned his people to get back to their beer and wine, was merely a quick frown followed by silence.

The Better Beer Prayer

One of the first things that many Marines look forward to upon returning from deployment is celebrating their homecoming with a few cold beers. And, LtCmdr Phillip Lee who serves as Chaplain for the 8th Communication Battalion, currently deployed, understands that tending to the needs of his Marines sometimes covers subjects never addressed in divinity school . . . and that spirit-filled has more than one meaning:

 I have been around Marines long enough to know Memorial Day was a challenge for many of you. A challenge because you were not able to share a beer with your buddies during a barbecue unofficially marking the beginning of summer. I have also heard many of you have discovered the &quot;near-beer&quot; (nonalcoholic beverages with beer-like flavor) available here doesn&apos;t quite measure up to. After PT in the hot sun or at the end of a hard work day, having a beer to relax probably sounds pretty good to many of you. I know some of you may lay awake at night dreaming about having a &quot;cold one.&quot; Beer commercials on TV would be sheer torture to a few of you in your current mental state having been deprived of what you might Out of concern for your morale and well being as we enter into the hotter summer months, I wanted you to know I am praying for your emotional stamina and endurance. To represent my prayers for you, I have decided to reprint a prayer drafted about eight years ago at the request of a master sergeant in Yuma, Ariz. (another hot place).
I was on a short deployment with Marine Aircraft Group 41. I arrived on station a day before the main body as the advance party. The master sergeant in the group sounded off after I entered the room where they were celebrating their success of having everything ready. He said, &quot;Chaplain, you know what we need is a better beer prayer.&quot; 

He was half joking and probably trying to see how I would react. They do that sometimes, as many of you already know. We laughed and I replied, &quot;That&apos;s a new request for me, master sergeant. Let me think about it and I will see what I can do.&quot; To be honest, my reply was about as serious as his initial request. In the next few days, I couldn&apos;t get his request out of my mind. So one night I took up my pen and wrote the following words:
 Dear God, Maker of the heavens and the earth:
We know you are the creator of all good things. For that reason we come now before you to ask for a better beer. We request it have a taste like unto the sweet nectars of the Garden of Eden. May the blend of its flavor pour gently over our tongues and satisfy not only the thirst of our mouths, but the longings of our souls.
Make this beer so good all who drink it will no longer drink the present beers which often lead people to bring injury to children, other drivers or themselves. Make it a beer that multiplies wisdom, instead of killing brain cells. Lord, you know we human beings really cannot afford to sacrifice many brain cells anyway.

Finally, Lord we ask this beer would be so good its consumption would never cause us to jeopardize or sacrifice our relationship with others or you. May the camaraderie generated by this beer make the celebrations and special occasions of our lives even more special by helping us to fully appreciate one of the most sacred dimensions of life-fellowship with our friends, loved ones and you.

Hear our prayer, oh Lord. Improve our lives with a better beer such as we have described and if you can think of any further improvements, by all means please act on our behalf.

By Your Leave, Sir
Written for U. S. Marines
Semper Fi 

Since the first printing of this prayer I have kept my eyes open to see if such a beer has come into existence. I haven&apos;t seen it yet, but I am still hopeful. If nothing else has come from the master sergeant&apos;s request, may it be you find yourself thinking more carefully about the choices you make the next time you decide to celebrate.

The reprinting of this prayer is dedicated to all the master sergeants of 8th Communication Battalion because it was a master sergeant who first requested such spiritual support. (Ephesians 5:15-20) 


Amen.

Memorial Day at Al Asad
 Photo by Cpl. C. Alex Herron 
Marines with the 6th ESB, currently deployed in the Al Anbar province of Iraq, took time on Memorial Day to honor one of their own - First Sgt. Michael S. Barnhill. He was killed on Saturday, May 28 by an IED explosion. Here are memories of 1st Sgt. Barnhill from his CO and the Marines he led, as reported by Cpl Herron:

Maj. Sean J. Riddell, 6th ESB, Alpha Company CO:
 &quot;Barnhill hated leaving the wire. But the only thing he hated worse was knowing his Marines were out there, and there was nothing he could do if something happened. World War II veterans define courage as being afraid, but going anyway. By that definition, Barnhill was a very courageous man. He hated leaving the wire, but he did it for the Marines. He was old enough to know he wouldn&apos;t live forever, but young enough to know he wanted to do a lot more with his life.&quot; 

Sgt. Justin Babbit:
 &quot;He helped out his junior Marines even when he didn&apos;t have to. He was buoyant and loud. His personality was one of the defining personalities of our company. I had never met a bigger, tougher man who showed his love for his junior Marines.&quot; 

Cpl. James Peterson
 &quot;My first meeting with [First Sgt. Barnhill] was at a company formation before the unit was to deploy in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. When he stood in front of me to ask me why my dog tag had not been placed in my left boot like he had instructed I responded that I was new and had not heard the order. Then he proceeded to explain why that was no excuse. His [Peterson&apos;s] noncommissioned officers should have passed the word. That is what he expected of them, to look after their junior Marines just like he did.&quot; 

Lance Cpl. Jared Tjaden:
 &quot;He always found a way to make you laugh. He always made sure his Marines were taken care of.&quot; 

1st Sgt. Barnhill was married to Joanna and leaves a legacy of three children, Michael, Michelle and Ashlee. He would have retired from the USMC in December. He will never be forgotten by the Marines with whom he served and the world is forever diminished by his death.

HARD Fighting Marines

For those who are curious about the caliber of men who lead their sons into battle, here&apos;s LtCol Jurney&apos;s philosophy of leadership for his 1/6 Marines:

 My personal leadership philosophy can be captured in one phrase &quot;Lead by Example.&quot; When in charge, take charge. Lead from the front and by example. All values and ethical behavior for leading Marines stem from this basic position. When maintaining the standard in both our words and our deeds we consistently establish clear standards of what is expected. Time gets wasted when a leader sends mixed signals. Our actions must support our words. To lead by example is to tell our Marines what the standards are; why the standards are important and how the standards will accomplish the mission and save lives on the battlefield. Personal example is the strongest and most persuasive tool in our leadership kit bag. I expect every member of this command to embrace this simple philosophy, and &quot;walk their talk&quot; to garner the loyalty and respect from those with which we have the honor to serve. 

 Tenets of 1/6 &quot;HARD&quot;: 

 Marine leaders in 1/6 should always be doing one of two things;
leading their Marines in combat or preparing their Marines for combat. Nothing is more fundamental to war fighting excellence than a solid base of character. We must have trust and confidence in one another’s actions and commitments:
 H ONESTY If you say you are going to do something, do it.
 A CTION If you see something is wrong, fix it.
 R ESPECT If you want to be treated well, treat others well.
 D UTY If you put the mission and the welfare of those with which you serve first… then our team will be second to none. 


 Summary: 

 Marines strive for excellence in everything we do. Our history records it, our appearance reflects it, our confidence and swagger state it. The essence of being a Marine is teamwork. That is what has won our battles and written our history. Therefore, we must work together to set the example and instill the spirit of teamwork in everything we do - our future success depends on it.

Mean Moms Make Mighty Marines

Chaplain Ryan, ministering to the spiritual needs of Marines in Fallujah wrote this tribute for his mother - and all mothers who spent Mother&apos;s Day apart from their son.

 There is a day in the month of May when people throughout the United States take time to thank their Mother for all the love shown to them throughout their lives. There have been many years when I have sent the obligatory card to my Mom and not really thought much about all she has done for me throughout my life. For some reason, this Mother&apos;s Day seems different than others.
Maybe it is because being away from home for a long time has a way of making a person realize what is truly important in life, and so I think more about how special my Mother is to me. Maybe it is because my Mother has been very sick lately and I cannot help but think about what life would be like without her. Or maybe it is because I realize all the overtime that my wife has to put in as a Mother while I am away, and I appreciate all of her hard work.

My Mother is one of the greatest respected Kindergarten teachers in Nashville, TN. She has taught Kindergarten at the same school for over 30 years. She is an incredible woman, and an even better Mother. However, I think you need a little insight into what my home life was like. My Mother was the meanest Mother in the whole world! While other kids ate candy for breakfast, I had to have cereal, eggs, and toast. When others had a Pepsi and a Twinkie for lunch, I had to eat sandwiches. And you can guess my Mother fixed me a dinner that was different from other kids, too. Mom insisted on knowing where I was at all times. You’d think I was a convict in a prison. She had to know who my friends were, and what I was doing with them. She insisted that if I said I would be gone for an hour, I would be gone for an hour or less.

I was ashamed to admit it, but she had the nerve to break the Child Labor Laws by making me work. I had to clean my room, wash out the bathtub, take out the trash, vacuum the floor, iron my clothes, and occasionally do the dishes. I think she would lie awake at night thinking of more things for me to do. One time she even told me that the reason she had a son was so that I could do work around the house. She always insisted on my telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

By the time I was a teenager she could read my mind. Then, life was really tough! Mom wouldn&apos;t let my friends just honk the horn when they drove up. They had to come up to the door so she could meet them. While everyone else could date when they were 12 or 13, I had to wait until I was 16.

Because of my Mother, I missed out on lots of things other kids experienced. I have never been caught shoplifting, vandalizing other&apos;s property, or ever arrested for any crime. It was all her fault. I never got drunk, did drugs, stayed out all night, or a million other things the other kids did. Sundays were reserved for church, and we never missed once. I knew better than to ask to spend the night with a friend on Saturdays.

Now that I&apos;ve left home I&apos;m a God-fearing, educated, honest adult. I&apos;m doing the best I can to be a mean parent just like my Mom was. I want to say thanks to all the &quot;mean&quot; Mothers out there. You helped to make us into the men and women we are today. We miss you.

May God bless all the work you do and have done to raise your children.

Update from 1/6 Marines at Camp Baharia

LtCol Jurney sends greetings from Camp Baharia.

 As expected our Marines and Sailors have picked up the ball and have made significant strides in our area of operations. In just a few weeks we have conducted operations which involved finding, capturing or killing insurgent elements.
Everyday we continue to work hand in hand with the Iraqi Security Forces to degrade the enemies&apos; ability to instill fear and intimidation among the people of Fallujah. This integrated concept has paid big dividends by way of successful offensive operations and winning the trust and confidence of the people of Iraq through our civil affairs projects. 


 
 On a daily basis I move around our area of operations and see our Marines and Sailors hard at work conducting countless missions. On any given day - I observe our Marines putting blackboards up in a
school that we are rebuilding; to finding unexploded ordnance or booby-trapped explosive devices; to engaging hard core insurgents in a one on one firefight . . . it&apos;s the textbook example of what we call a &quot;three block war.&quot; Our Marines and Sailors are constantly on the move and they are routinely having to make life and death decisions in a matter of seconds. They are truly amazing young men and I couldn&apos;t be prouder of what they are accomplishing out here.
As I mentioned earlier, we are working hand in hand with the Iraqi Security Forces who are eager to restore peace and prosperity throughout Iraq. The establishment and training of Iraqi Security Forces is a major part of our mission. As part of that effort we have just graduated a number of young Iraqi&apos;s from our first Iraqi NCO Training Course, known as our Combat Leaders Course. Additionally we put together our own mini Iraqi boot camp that held its first graduation a few weeks ago. As mentioned above, the operational and training integration of our forces has been key to our success. 


 
 Our Public Affairs NCO has done a tremendous job on getting the stories out to the local papers and on the Marine Corps Website. When you get a chance log-on to www.usmc.mil and read about your Marines and Sailors and how well they are performing in this very complex and dangerous environment. They are truly making a difference and are helping Iraqis take charge of their country.

Operation MATADOR report from the front

From LtCol Mundy in Al Qaim:

 Friends and families, I think it was Mark Twain who once said, &quot;Never put off till tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.&quot; Thankfully Mr. Twain is not running this Task Force, chasing the enemy, or keeping you updated of all that&apos;s going on. From the news reports of last week, many of you are aware of what happened during Operation MATADOR and now know why you did not receive that Mother&apos;s Day call from your son or husband--they were out showing the world why there is no better friend and no worse enemy than a United States Marine. As their Commanding Officer, I wanted to personally share with you why I&apos;m so intensely proud of YOUR Marines and Sailors of Task Force 3/2.
Operation MATADOR was a great success. It was my privilege to lead the men of Task Force 3/2 into enemy territory to conduct combat operations against anti-coalition forces situated along, and north of, the Euphrates River. During the weeklong operation, I saw our Marines and Sailors conduct themselves with the height of honor, depth of courage, and breadth of commitment indicative of the world&apos;s finest warriors. I couldn&apos;t be prouder of these men and all they accomplished. I know you must feel the same.

Let me explain why this operation was necessary:

The war on the terrorists came late to Al Qa&apos;im. This area is isolated by distance and cultural idiosyncrasies from central Iraq . For centuries, this has been a corrupt trade route area on the Euphrates. For decades, not even Saddam Hussein truly controlled the crime, corruption, and disloyalties. This abnormal, different area became the natural safe haven for some foreign fighters. They transit the area and use it as a staging ground for insurgency and terrorist actions in other areas of the country. We didn&apos;t have a good ability to cross to the north side of the Euphrates and stay for longer than a raid. In the last six to eight months, the foreign fighter presence and activity grew in the area north of the river. Task Force 3/2 is situated in the midst of this volatile area, and believe me, none of your sons, brothers, husbands and/or fathers shrink from the challenges we find because of it! There is a dangerous enemy here, but your Marines and Sailors know their jobs, and they do them well, so we can handle the threats.

Our RCT headquarters planned offensive operations under the name MATADOR to clear the area of insurgents and to prove to the foreign fighters that they had no safe haven north of the river. Your men proved just that! We were joined in the fight by several units: Bravo Company, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) Battalion and Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25 th Marines. While we have always been superior in individual fights in the area, we increased the strength of the Task Force to clear through the strongholds in the north and maintain security in the south.

Our two rifle companies, Kilo Company 3/2 and Lima Company 3/25, reinforced by one Warpig mobile platoon fought bravely with entrenched insurgents in the towns of Ubaydi and Ramana. Their tenacity to take the fight to the enemy resulted in a significant number of enemy kills and captures, thereby hampering enemy ability to move at will in this region.

Bravo Company, 2D LAR and Alpha Company, 4th AAV provided protection on our flanks, much need flexibility in the field of battle, as well as the ability to quickly move large numbers of our men across enemy territory. The men of India provided a blocking position in support of the operation, and also continued their fight around Camp Gannon , while the Warpigs of Weapons Company also manned the key blocking position as well as provided effective fire support during the entire operation.

Needless to say, there were many moments of fierce fighting. Many Marines demonstrated heroism and accomplished extraordinary feats. I don&apos;t need to provide details of firefights-trust me when I say your men performed as I expect them to perform when they carry the title of United States Marine. They were awesome! As we continue our mission in this region, we humbly ask for your prayers and thank you for the faithful support you&apos;ve given this Task Force. We could not do what we do without all of you.

Our thoughts are also with the friends and families of the 9 Marines who died protecting their brothers in arms. I held a memorial service in their honor Sunday evening, 15 May in the orange light of a setting sun. These are the names of our fallen comrades:


 SSgt Anthony L. Goodwin, Regimental Combat Team-2, attached to Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines

 SSgt Kendall H. Ivy II, Regimental Combat Team-2, attached to Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines

 Cpl Dustin A. Derga, Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines

 LCpl Lawrence R. Phillippon, Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines

 LCpl Wesley G. Davids, Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines

 LCpl Nicholas B. Erdy, Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines

 LCpl Jonathan W. Grant, Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines

 LCpl Jordan L. Grez, 4th Combat Engineer Battalion, attached to Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines

 PFC Christopher R. Dixon, Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 25th Marines


There really is no greater love than he who lays his life down for his friends. They lived as warriors, died heroes, and will forever be honored. May God bless their memories and comfort their families. We also had wounded Marines who will require, in some cases, lengthy recovery times. Keep them and their families in your prayers as well, as we wish for a full recovery and return to 3/2.

I&apos;ve said this once before and it bears repeating: Mail and care packages from home continue to be a weekly highlight for our men. Anything you send from home reminds us of your love and support and really boosts morale. The generosity of all who&apos;ve given does not go unnoticed.

Honoring Mom

LtCmdr Lee, Chaplain for 8th Comm, wrote this message for the Marines under his pastoral care.

 I have often heard it said, &quot;A woman&apos;s work is never done.&quot; This statement is especially true for women who have children. Most mothers get little rest because they invest countless hours in supervising the well-being of their children. Observing this deepest of passions, &quot;a mother&apos;s love&quot;. I have discovered that such love focuses on at least three primary concerns. A mother doesn&apos;t seem to rest until she knows her children are satisfied, situated, and safe.
These primary concerns begin to appear in a mother&apos;s care for a newborn. Mom makes sure that the baby is satisfied with plenty to eat and regular diaper changes. This is not to imply that Dad cannot contribute to these needs, but Mom will make sure these essential needs are met so that the baby isn&apos;t crying all the time. With the infant satisfied, Mom works to get the little one situated. This may involve cradling the child close to her body or laying it in a comfortable place, wrapped in a warm blanket.

As the newborn&apos;s sleeping patterns change and it grows older, Mom seeks to satisfy the child by providing toys, friends to play with, and eventually a good school to attend for educational purposes. Mom&apos;s concern for a child becoming situated may explain why the first day of school or leaving for college is such a big deal to her. I am positive it has something to do with why mothers push to make sure everything goes well at weddings and then cry through much of the ceremony. They simply love their children and long to see them situated well in all categories of life.

Having their children satisfied and situated is not yet enough to convince mothers to rest a bit. They are going to labor at guaranteeing a child&apos;s safety before they lean back at all. I once visited a habitat for the largest bears in North America, the Kodiak Brown Bears. As we walked through the bears&apos; territory, the guide told us, &quot; The last thing you want to do is get within 100 yards of a female bear with a cub. &quot; Any hint of threat to that cub would spark an intense reaction from the &quot;mama bear&quot; that would have devastating results.

Little compares to the fury of a mother&apos;s protection; this is among the most intense instincts. I have seen this kind of behavior in a few Moms as they protected their young and in most cases they were not going to relax a bit until they sensed their child was safe. This concern for safety is what prompts many Moms to practice a tireless prayer effort, building a perimeter of spiritual protection around their child so that the devil can do no harm. This concern is also the reason why Moms encourage us to have a right relationship with God. Mom is just trying to protect us from any harm.

Realizing these factors are so important to a mother, honor your mother today by calling her and letting her know that you are being satisfied with access to the best chow the Marine Corps can offer and clean clothes on a regular basis. Tell her that the Marine Corps has situated you with lots of equipment, plenty of new friends and a learning environment that exceeds some of the best classrooms in the world. Then tell her you are as safe as possible in this environment, surrounded by the best war fighters in the world, coupled with the never-ending watch care of God. She will rest a bit better tonight and her motherly duties will be less taxing having received these assurances from you.

After you hang up the phone, remember to thank God for the blessing of a Mom who did her best to keep you satisfied, situated and safe. If you can&apos;t talk to your Mom today because she has already finished her living on this earth, then honor her memory by telling someone about the great ways she showed her love for you: fixing your favorite meal, sending a card, hearing about your hurts. Per chance you haven&apos;t had a Mom that bothered herself with these primary concerns, learn to observe them in others and make sure your children receive such love.

Duplicating such love in others is the ultimate honor to a mother (Exodus 20:12).

Happy Mother&apos;s Day! We love you, MOM!
 


Thanks. We love you too.

Happy Mother&apos;s Day to deployed 8th Communication Battalion Moms:
SSgt Sabrina B.
Sgt Christina C.
Sgt Sara M.

33 KIAs, 400 Purple Hearts

If you&apos;re not reading Juggernuts, you&apos;re missing out on a unique view of the world in general and occasionally the military in specific. Sometimes, Cris posts something that takes my breath away . . . and this picture, taken by his father (retired USMC Colonel) is one of those. Visit his site to read the accompanying e-mail from his dad (snippet below):
 
 I was an invited guest for the memorial dedication honoring the KIA&apos;s of 3dBn, 1st Marines. The CO, LtCol W. Buhl, a very impressive officer. This shot shows the formation of the 33 KIA&apos;s, with helmet, rifle, boots&amp;name tags.
There was a final roll call, where the name of each of the 33 was called out by the Sergeant Major, and answered with a single toll of a bell. A piper in formal kilts played &quot;Taps&quot; and then a firing squad gave a 21 round salute.

In addition to 33 KIA, the Bn awarded some 400 Purple Hearts.

Iron in the blood of the Betio Bastards

My son called me this morning - it&apos;s always nice to hear from him, even at 5:30 a.m. He was watching news reports from the Syrian border and remarked, &quot;It&apos;s great to see that Husaybah is finally getting the attention it deserves.&quot; He speaks from experience, having recently returned from seven months at Camp Gannon. While 1/7 Bravo company had great success in keeping insurgency controlled while it was there, it was clearly time to clean house, USMC style. Marines excel at cleaning house and this battle is no exception.

General Conway answered questions at yesterday&apos;s press briefing - here is an excerpt:

 Let me give you some geographical context, if I can. Of course, Husaybah butts up against the Syrian border. Just southeast of there is the town of al Qaim. We&apos;ve had a battalion out there for a long time now. Recently, I think it&apos;s fair to say that the commanders have evaluated that the center of resistance in the Al Anbar has moved further west since the fall of Fallujah, and now is in what we would call the Ramadi-Hit corridor, extending westward, as opposed to Ramadi-Fallujah.
About 72 hours ago, U.S. forces, the 2nd Regimental Combat Team, effected a river crossing at a place called Ukedi (ph), and they established a blocking position at a little townlet called Rommana, and put forces across the river to flush what had been reported as groupings of insurgents there. They were decisively engaged; a fairly significant battle followed. Use of close air support and combined arms have been employed. And at this point, the fight continues. There are reports that these people are in uniforms, in some cases are wearing protective vests, and there&apos;s some suspicion that their training exceeds that of what we have seen with other engagements further east.

So, at this point, the fight continues.

Question: At this -- right now it&apos;s a U.S. operation. From what we understand, there aren&apos;t Iraqis there. Does that pose a problem as far as a U.S. face being on this battle along the border, that Iraqis have been very concerned about -- (off mike)? 

GEN. CONWAY: No, your assessment is correct based on my knowledge, Bret, and my observation of the task organization. I think as you know, we do have Iraqi forces based at Habbaniya that are working both the Fallujah and the Ramadi area. At this point, those operational forces have simply not extended their reach far enough west to join the U.S. forces there.

There are Iraqis operating in border forts along the borders. But in that interim area, they&apos;re simply not there yet.

And I want to offer that the fight&apos;s not finished. We saw where the Iraqis provided tremendous value to us in Fallujah. And if the fight continues, if it does involve fighting in built-up areas, that&apos;s not to say you won&apos;t see Iraqi forces involved.

Question: Can I follow up on that? Can you say whether or not you&apos;ve seen any evidence of some of these foreign fighters, as you&apos;ve described them, crossing back over the border? And are the Syrians in any way involved in this or in any way cooperating? 

GEN. CONWAY: I don&apos;t think I used the term foreign fighters. I don&apos;t think we know that yet. Certainly it&apos;s in proximity to the border. There is a major crossing site there, Husaybah, and again, there&apos;s smugglers&apos; routes both north and south of that location. So it&apos;s not unrealistic to expect that there could be foreign fighters engaged.

At this point, we simply don&apos;t know if the there is movement across the border associated with this, because the preponderance of our forces are engaged in this fight.

Question: Has there been any contact with the Syrians or any sort of effort to get them to help out, any -- 

GEN. CONWAY: From an operational perspective, I can only say that there is low-level contact that goes on, on a continuing basis. The captains and the field grade officers of that battalion have a fairly routine dialogue with the Syrians. I cannot speak to whether or not it transcends that.

Question: Assuming that this operation is successful, what do you expect the effect will be? You said that the center of the insurgency has effectively moved west. If you are able to succeed in this mission&apos;s objectives, what do you think the result will be? Will you have broken the back of the insurgency? Will -- 


GEN. CONWAY: No, I think it&apos;s way too early to say that. I think, as we have experienced in every fight up to this point, where we find the insurgents, we will attack them, to capture or kill if they resist.

If you look at what happened -- what has happened in the region up to this point, we have had a fairly significant Special Operations operation south of al Qaim, where we captured or killed 54. We have had two engagements in Husaybah, one the attack on Camp Gannon where they attempted to breach the perimeter with a large explosive device, the fire truck. We&apos;ve had a Zarqawi sighting, and now we have this fairly significant gathering of insurgents.

So where we find them, we will fight them, to take them --
 


 Bill Roggio and Chester are doing a fantastic job of blogging the battle. Here&apos;s an excerpt from Chester&apos;s methodical accounting of on-ground operations - visit his site to view the referenced map:

 Numbers on the map correspond to the listed event. There are in chronological order as best as can be determined.
1. Sunday, early morning: The bridge crossing(s) that began the operation were supposedly slower in progress than planned. Did this give a tip-off to the enemy? Mortar fire hit the bridging sites from Ubaydi and on the south side of the Euphrates at another site.

2. Sunday morning: Insurgents were spotted driving to rural houses in the north of the area of operations in Ribat, retrieving weapons stockpiles, then driving back to the cities.

3. One squad of Lima Co, 3/25, spent the better part of Sunday clearing a particular house in Ubaydi. The enemy had hidden in the basement and fired armor-piercing bullets through the floor at the Marines. Most of the day was spent destroying them, by this one squad, reinforced with heavy machine guns, a tank, and F-18 airstrikes. 



The list goes on and on, but this point is fascinating to me:

 10. Tuesday night? Marines engaged a vehicle that did not stop at a checkpoint SE of Ubaydi. Two civilians were killed, but the survivors asked the Marines to please attack the city , stating that the terrorists were forcing the men to fight. 

The Marines are doing what they do best - fight. It&apos;s hard on the families back home who are alternating between refreshing the CNN website and channel surfing to catch the latest news about their Marine&apos;s location. But the Marines who command the troops also care about the families. 3/2 Commanding Officer LtCol Mundy recently sent this message to the families of his Marines:

 President Theodore Roosevelt once wisely noted, &quot;Thank God for the iron in the blood of our fathers.&quot; I can say with full confidence, were it not for the iron in the blood of your husbands, sons, fathers, and brothers, our effectiveness here would be significantly diminished. Vigilance and attention to detail continue to win the day and foil the many traps the enemy attempts to place in our path. Mines and IEDs are discovered and destroyed before they cause harm to our men. Furthermore, as the result of some successful raids and the pressure put upon the enemy because of our presence, terrorists continue to be captured or killed. I am glad to say that our enemy now realizes why we&apos;re called &quot;The Betio Bastards!&quot; 
Since the attack on Camp Gannon a few weeks ago, things remain as they once were: still dangerous, but the strong advantage remains with the Marines. India Company continues to be challenged at Camp Gannon, but strikes back with precision and effectiveness. Lima Company continues to expertly conduct their security missions around Al Asad. Kilo Company was detached from 3/2 for a short period to battle alongside another battalion in Haditha, and executed their attack fantastically. Weapons and H&amp;S;Companies had to cover the vast areas around Al Qaim, and did so with professionalism, keeping the enemy in this area at bay. I&apos;m proud to say that all the Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers attached to Task Force 3/2 are working as a cohesive unit, overcoming any obstacles in their path, and are making significant progress in our area of operations. That being said, it&apos;s not hard to be cautiously optimistic!

The dangerous work of stopping the enemy must continue until the mission is complete, and at times we&apos;re conducting very important operations. That means it may be necessary from time to time to minimize our regular contact with you at home and I trust you can understand why. Unfortunately, our current mission means that mothers might not get a well-deserved Mother&apos;s Day call from your grateful sons. Please know that they are thinking of you and thankful for you. I&apos;ll also take this opportunity to thank you mothers for raising such fine men. May God bless each of you and fill your Mother&apos;s Day with joy. I know you must be proud of your sons. 


Before we hung up this morning, I asked my son if he thought the U.S. troops would ever be able to clean out the insurgents and foreign fighters. His assessment was that while it was unlikely, we would eventually achieve success in training the Iraqis to complete the mission. That&apos;s what it&apos;s always been about, but it&apos;s good to hear it again.

A nation under God

 

The National Day of Prayer was observed at Al Asad today as the Marines, soldiers, and sailors paused to exercise their right to freedom of both religion and speech. Here&apos;s a report form Cpl. Rocco DeFilippis (who also took the above picture).

 Chaplains, religious program specialists and chaplains&apos; assistants from the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (Forward) and the 326th Area Support Group organized the breakfast and allotted times throughout the day for service members to partake in specific prayers for family, government, military and the people of Iraq, among others.
Prior to the meal, those in attendance enjoyed musical selections from the 2nd MAW Band and a praise team. Army Sgt. Daniel Estinfort&apos;s saxophone soothed the crowd with hymns as they ate.

After the meal, Lt. Cmdr. Terry Eddinger, Marine Aircraft Group 26 chaplain, lead the gathering in prayer for our nations leaders.

Following the prayer and a brief introduction, the wing commanding general gave an inspiring speech.

The guest of honor at the prayer breakfast, Brig. Gen. Robert E. Milstead Jr., commanding general of the 2nd MAW (Fwd), quoted from &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and spoke of the importance of prayer and God&apos;s grace.

&quot; We are not only blessed as individuals, but as a nation, &quot; Milstead said. &quot; Our country is truly blessed with freedom and prosperity unparalleled across the nations. &quot;

&quot; We join together this morning, people of different faiths, but serving one God ,&quot; Milstead punctuated. &quot; As servicemen and women we are called to not only stand for our nation but our faith. &quot;

Milstead said the theme of this year&apos;s National Day of Prayer, &apos;God Shed His Grace on Thee,&apos; highlights the importance of God&apos;s grace in our daily lives.

During a difficult time for the people of Iraq and America, Milstead said the importance of prayer and faith should not be overlooked.

&quot; From the earliest days of our founding, we have been a nation under God, &quot; he said. &quot; Today we ask God to shed His grace on us and the people of Iraq, and just as He promised, we will receive it. &quot;

Milstead&apos;s words echoed those of President Abraham Lincoln, who said, &quot; it is the duty of nations as well as men, to owe their dependence upon the overruling power of God. &quot;

After Milstead&apos;s speech, and prayers for military personnel and family, Capt. Christian Pappas concluded the ceremony by playing Amazing Grace on the bagpipes.
 


Amen.

Safety Letter to Marine Parents

LtCol S.D. Aiken, 2/6 Marines Commanding Officer recently sent this reminder to the parents of his Marines.

 Dear Parents,
As your son&apos;s Battalion Commander, I sent a letter dated August 1, 2004 in which I provided you with some information and requested your assistance. I would like to provide you an update.

As Spring arrives, the Battalion will receive all of our deployed Marines and Sailors back from Afghanistan and Iraq. Thus far, every Marine and Sailor has performed exceptionally well in these series of antiterrorism missions; their efforts have been vital in the prosecution of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Upon completion of these current deployments, the Battalion will deploy next Autumn to Iraq for seven months. Therefore, the Summer will be busy with predeployment preparations and training, culminating in a three-week exercise in California. We have scheduled a leave period for August, so folks can start making vacation plans. You can rest assured that our predeployment preparations and training will be realistic and thorough. Additionally, your son is in the process of receiving the best equipment that money can buy. The Battalion will be well prepared when we deploy.

During my last letter, I asked your assistance during periods of liberty and annual leave. Specifically, I asked that:



 After periods of liberty please urge your son, if he is traveling by car, to depart early enough so he can safely make his required 6:00 PM formation or check-in time.

 Encourage him to drive at posted speed limits and, most importantly, to wear seat belts.


To date, our safety record has been good; our Marines and Sailors have been conducting themselves in a professional, mature manner. With Springtime around the corner, the Battalion will be shifting the focus of its safety efforts to include the safe conduct of outdoor activities. I would like to thank you for your past assistance and ask for your continued parental efforts in keeping our Marines and Sailors safe.

3/3 India Company accomplishing their mission
 
Captain James Sweeney, 3/3 India company reports from the Kunar Province of Afghanistan:

 The deployment will soon be over for the Marines and Sailors of India Company 3/3. Even though there are only a few short months before we are back home, we still have a mission to accomplish here in OEF. The Marines are as focused as ever and continue their extraordinary efforts to accomplish that mission. The change in the security situation here in the Kunar province has been tremendous. Many of the projects planned by the Army&apos;s Provincial Reconstruction Team have been able to commence and be completed unimpeded by the activity of the Anti-Government Forces. It seems that there is a new school, clinic, district house, bridge or well opening up every week. Your Marines hard work, spending days on end living and working among the communities has really paid off. The relationships and trust that has been forged between the Marines and the Afghan communities is tremendous. After all, it is that trust that has proven to be our most effective weapon against the people who want to see the reconstruction effort fail. 
Our cooperation and training with the Afghanistan National Army (ANA) and National Police (ANP) has come leaps and bounds from where we were in November. Your Marines are playing a huge role in shaping these two forces that will be tasked with defending Afghanistan&apos;s future. Everything we do now involves participation from the ANA and ANP in a joint effort to stop the terrorism against the communities.
Because of this cooperation and constant presence in the areas most frequented by the Anti-Government Forces, many of the terrorists have given up the fight, no longer wishing to go up against the coalition and Afghan forces. We are working hand in hand with the Government of the Kunar Province to continue these efforts and take a new step towards stability as we approach the summer months.

The base here in Asad Abad has now started up a weekly flea market where the local vendors can come and sell goods. The Marines can find many high quality crafts made by the local workers at low, low prices. We try to allow the Marines the opportunity to purchase small souvenirs of their deployment when we can. Of course, our mission comes first and there is not exactly an ATM on every corner. But, hopefully, the Marines will be able to bring back some small trinkets as reminders of their heroic efforts here in Afghanistan

Welcome home, 1/3 Marines
 
After months in Iraq, the Marines of 1/3 are coming home to Hawaii, via Okinawa. Here&apos;s a tribute from 1stSgt John Armstead, H&amp;S;Company:
 As the Company First Sergeant, I want you to know how proud I am to have served with such fine Warriors. In my opinion they all are heroes for their actions in Fallujah, but the true HEROES are you all at home. We know you spent many sleepless nights wondering what was going on; you took on both duties as mother and father. You handled all the financial responsibilities for the home, and you had to endure all the unfortunate memorial services by yourselves. Your contribution is truly remarkable and inspiring. We could not have done what we did without you.
We went to a country with a determined enemy, who was willing to sacrifice his life just to kill one Marine or Sailor. What they didn&apos;t realize was the determination, the dedication and the Esprit de Corps a Marine and Sailor possess. On D-Day the enemy found out quickly that the Lava Dogs were an elite fighting force ready to conquer terrorism. Your loved ones made history by enabling a country the right and the freedom to vote.

For most in the company this was their first time in combat, and just like a new recruit standing on the yellow foot prints for the very first time at either MCRD San Diego or MCRD Parris Island, he looks young and unsure of what he is about to embark upon. For me, I noticed those same things with my Marines and Sailors like I did with my recruits. They looked so young and unsure of what they were about to conquer. Now, when we return I&apos;m sure you will see a difference in how your Marine or Sailor carries himself. He has aged some, he has a certain confidence about himself, and he knows exactly what it takes to be a Warrior.

Getting it right

A few weeks ago, we ran a story about the Salem-Keizer school district decision to alter a photo of an active-duty infantry Marine in order to remove the weapon he carried. This generated a national response and the principal and superintendent received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls. They backed down.

In contrast, Aaron Cooke, a teacher at Lebanon Union High School, recently invited USMC recruiters into the school to speak to his Military History class. They brought their weapons into the classroom, escorted by Lebanon Police Officers, and provided an educational view of military life. Kudos to this teacher. This morning, LCpl Shane Conrad, recently returned from Iraq, also visited the school at the request of his cousin Barbie McGehee who is a LUHS junior. I&apos;ll post details about Shane&apos;s question&amp;answer session with the students soon . . . but I couldn&apos;t resist posting this picture of my handsome son and beautiful niece tonight. If you&apos;re wondering why his right arm is wrapped in plastic . . . he got his first (and hopefully last) tattoo a few hours ago. Pictures soon.

Pope John Paul II remembered in Fallujah
 Photo by LCpl Evan M. Eagan 
Chaplain John Hannigan leads more than 40 Marines and Sailors in prayer at Camp Fallujah, Iraq, Friday during a memorial service held for Pope John Paul II.

Here are a few snippets from LCpl Evan Eagan&apos;s description:

 Those who gathered shared in some of the pope&apos;s favorite prayers, songs and readings from the Holy Scripture. A slide show highlighting his life was scheduled, although due to an electrical problem, it was not played.

Chaplain (Lt. Cmdr.) John Hannigan, II MEF Headquarters Group, II Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward) presided over the 45-minute service.

&quot; The pope wasn&apos;t into ornate, flowery types of things ,&quot; said Hannigan. &quot; We wanted to do something simple in keeping with the pope, who was a simple, down-to-earth man. He stood for what God wanted him to stand for: truth, justice and peace .&quot;

For those attending the service it served as a way to pay their final respects to the pope who passed away April 2, at the age of 84.

&quot; I didn&apos;t get a chance to see the funeral on television so I came here today, &quot; said LCpl Joe McGinty, information operations, Regimental Combat Team 8, 2nd Marine Division. &quot; He was the epitome of the perfect catholic and leader, and he helped a lot of people and countries ,&quot; added the Augusta, Ga., native.

For LCpl Lawrence Hurtado, heavy equipment operator, II MHG, the pope was an inspiration. &quot; He did a lot of good things that people could strive for ,&quot; said Hurtado, a Pueblo, Colo., native. &quot; He set a lot of goals and he accomplished them .&quot;

Two Causes: to never forget our brothers and to tend to their families

LtCol Mark A. Smith, CO for 2/24 Marines reports that all Mad Ghosts are back on U.S. soil. I&apos;ve heard from several very thankful parents this week and look forward to sharing their homecoming photos with you soon.

 Greetings and well wishes. It is my profound pleasure to report to you today from sunny Southern California! Additionally, I can report to you that 100% of the Mayhem Battalion is back from Iraq. Now, while I know this is not news to any of you, I did not want to send an update until I could report 100%, and 13 of our Marines were designated as pallet riders and did not arrive back until Monday. These were the Marines who accompanied our unit gear back on Air Force Cargo Planes.
I know the magnificent and sharp families of 2/24 well enough to know that at this point you are saying, &quot;well, if you had 100% of the Battalion back on Monday, it is now Wednesday, so what happen to the update on Tuesday?&quot; The answer: yesterday was our Battalion Memorial Service and that dominated our attention, and rightfully so. I will come back to the Memorial in a few minutes, but right now, as is my practice, I would like to bring you up to speed on the current status of YOUR Mad Ghosts.

The last 10 days or so in Iraq were spent aboard Camp Striker, on the grounds of Baghdad International Airport. YOUR Marines during this time were essentially guests of the US Army, and we could not have asked for better hosts. The Marines were afforded, for the first time in the deployment, a virtual vacation. They had access to some phenomenal chow 4 times a day, much rest, as much physical training as they desired, and the opportunity to see every movie that has been captured on film for the last 20 years. I could not have been happier for them for this time that was allotted to them, and as is usually the case with the Mad Ghosts, they pressed on, took full advantage of the situation and maintained their sturdy professionalism the entire time.

Since returning to Camp Pendleton in successive waves, the Marines have been executing the tasks required to demobilize the Battalion. Things here have gone extremely well and both the work that had been done by the advance party as well as the outstanding support we have received from the 1st Marine Division have been nothing short of outstanding. So, I can report to you that your Battalion is healthy, happy and EAGER to return to you. Flight times have been published and I know final coordinating measures for the Homecoming celebrations are underway! The PWST staffs will be publishing all required information shortly, if they have not already done so. I know for each Homecoming there are some &quot;concerns&quot; over varying matters. Ladies, what I can honestly tell you is that every decision that is made is being made for the best benefit for the most people, and with &quot;what is best for the Marine and his family&quot; being the standard against which all decisions are based. That being said, I would ask for your understanding in the enormity of the tasks, logistically and administratively, that are part and parcel of events like homecomings, and to think about the million or so moving parts behind the scenes that must be executed to make these things happen. Throughout this entire process I would like to think that a nugget of wisdom or &quot;line to live by&quot; to put on my wall would be from some historically famous General or great Warrior, but in reality, the line of knowledge that has dominated my life lately actually comes from the famous comedian Bill Cosby: &quot;I do not know the key to success. I just know the key to failure is to try to please everyone.&quot; No intention here of slighting anyone, but just hoping to assist in the management of expectations and hoping that all can understand how issues sometimes of simple mathematics, i.e., a finite amount of space of arena floor versus a large number of people who want to be on the floor. Such realities require decisions. These decisions will not please everyone, but are made with the best available information and with the aforementioned standard as the measurement device.

Now, for yesterday. At 1430 hours we commenced a Memorial Service in tribute of our fallen heroes. I can truly only describe it as a beautiful and heart touching event. There was much sadness in the auditorium, but there was more love. Love of our brothers who gave all. Love of our brothers who have left behind family and friends. Family and friends who are now OUR family and friends, and will be for life. There was a dedication of two causes: one - to never forget our brothers, and two - to tend to their families. For the first is the Warrior bond, and the second is our charge. We can not and we must not forget that our brothers have left behind broken hearts and shattered dreams. We honor them by tending to those hearts and helping to build new dreams. The fallen and our wounded MUST become integral parts of our lives now. We must care for them, we must assist them, we must ensure they are part of this magnificent family from now until every last one of us has breathed our very last collective breath. Anything less is unacceptable, and anything less would be less than the Mayhem standard. This Battalion and its families have never failed in combat, and I know as sure as our fallen were with us yesterday from their post in Heaven, this magnificent Battalion and its families will not fail in a lifetime of peaceful and tender service to our wounded and the families of our fallen!

Following the memorial service, we had some VIPs who made some presentations and received gifts from the Battalion. Chief among these was Peggy Kane, a 71 year old lady from Fountain Valley, CA, who has no connection with the War save one: SHE IS AN AMERICAN PATRIOT! She had been one of our biggest supporters and sent countless cards, care packages, letters and posters (very motivational ones such as autographed posters of the Arizona Cardinals Cheerleaders, a Mad Ghost favorite). She is representative of so many Americans who have shown support is more than verbal, it is action. It was a thrill to recognize her in front of the Battalion, and she, through her words and actions, demonstrated for the Marines the beginning of what they have not quite grasped yet: that their exploits are both known and deeply appreciated by many, many Americans who they know not. For that, I am eternally grateful to Peggy Kane, and all the citizens like her.

Oh yeah, another huge thing Peggy did, she brought one of the greatest examples of athletic gentleman this country has ever known: Rod Carew, Hall of Fame baseball player for the Minnesota Twins and California Angels. Mr. Carew is the quintissential example of a gentleman, a very private man, and one who honored YOUR Marines by attending our memorial service and then personally autographing baseballs and taking pictures with our Purple Heart recipients. If all athletes were like Rod Carew, there would be no resistance to them being called heroes!

Ladies, in closing, I should thank so many. The families and their support, the unknown Amercians who sent us so much, the Generals and Colonels and staffs who supported us and helped us win our fight, my XO, S-3 and entire staff who were tireless and relentless in their duties, my Company Commanders who led the fight against evil, the attachments from Trucks, Engineers, HET, CAG, EOD, Comm Company, K9s and their handlers, our Navy brothers who tended to our wounds and our spiritual needs, all who made an absolute all-star line-up. I could thank the Marines of 2/24 proper, the greatest Battalion. I could attempt to thank all these, but the reality is my inadequacy and my words would fall woefully short. All I can say to even try to express my gratitude is this: I have as my wife one of the most beautiful women on the planet, and two daughters that when I look at them I see two angels in training, and I am as excited as I can be to see them. But, with that said, and I know my wife and daughters will forgive me for this, these days passing right now are some of the saddest of my life. I know with certainty that never again will I be surrounded by such men accomplishing such feats. Never again will I experience both the realm and intensity of emotion that I have for the past year. Never again will I be so honored and humbled all at the same time. No, the only thing I know for sure is soon, and I suspect very soon, I will find myself beginning that Warrior&apos;s road to slowly fading away and longing and wondering in my mind&apos;s eye: &quot;where has the Mayhem AO gone...and where, where are my Mad Ghosts?&quot; For no man was ever as honored as I to have shared time and space with these unbelievable men, these unbelievable Mad Ghosts, these MARINES!

Wishing you the most joyous of homecomings and long, healthy, prosperous and God Blessed lives.

2/6 Golf Company tribute

They&apos;re home, but their work in Iraq is worthy of praise. Here are some good words from Golf Company CO, Captain Wardman:
 At this time, I’d like say a couple of words about YOUR Marines. They have done an incredibly difficult job with poise and tact. I will tell you this; there were a lot of ‘nay-sayers’ out there that did not think that ‘an ordinary company of grunts’ could perform this mission. I will agree with that, because your Marines and this company are not ordinary. They established themselves as a force to be reckoned with as soon as we set foot in country. People around here quickly understood that we were not ‘ordinary grunts’ and that we meant business. Your Marines controlled everything here: access control, policy enforcement, physical security, and crisis management, which included casualty treatment. Your Marines were always the first out the door, the first on scene and the first to establish order and security in the midst of chaos. In short, when everyone else ran away, your Marines were running in.
In an environment where the actions of a single Marine could affect international relations, your Marines performed flawlessly. The decision-making ability of every Marine, from PFC to Sgt, was tempered by good judgment and conviction. When Marines stood their ground on an issue, they were right every single time. For six months, whether it was dealing with an irate foreign ambassador or near misses with rockets and mortars, your Marines were flawless in their duties. Your Marines did those things everyday, without complaint and with complete diligence. They did things that impressed and astounded people. Not a day went by that I did not receive some sort of praise for the way a Marine stood his post, did not back down while being challenged by senior officers, and/or conducted themselves professionally even when their challenger did not.

Every single day, people in other branches of the United States Military told Marines how much safer they slept at night just knowing that Marines were out on the line. Your Marines did this. Immediately, local residents were frantic to know what they had done wrong to deserve Marines in their sector. In an area known to be a &quot;hot spot&quot;, your Marines established themselves as hard but fair and completely professional.

We started to notice a trend in our area. It was always quiet when we went out on patrol. Other units weren’t always as lucky. I think that the populace knew the difference between Golf Company Marines and the Army units that also operated in that sector. There is no higher form of respect than that of your enemies. Your Marines earned their respect and held them in check. I am proud of them. All of them. They did a job that was not glamorous and, at times, flat out boring. They did this job with absolute professionalism and unwavering devotion to duty. I cannot say enough about them.

On a more somber note, the Company sustained a loss during this deployment. Corporal Joe Ayala had a stroke while he was here. He had a previously undiagnosed blood vessel deformity in his brain. The blood vessels ruptured and he was medevaced from Baghdad back to Bethesda. Initial reports were not promising and many doctors did not expect him to make it, but Joe proved them all wrong. He is currently amazing the doctors with his will and drive to get better. Despite the doctor’s prognosis that he would never walk again, he can now walk with a walker and has recently started walking with a cane. Doctors said that he would probably never talk again, but Joe can speak slowly and is getting better everyday. Our hearts and prayers go out for him and we want him back because he is a fine Heavy Machine Gunner! All words of comfort can be directed to his father, Joe Sr., at: joe_r_ayala@raytheon.com His father, a retired Marine, would be extremely grateful for any prayers or words of encouragement! 

Welcome home and thanks for a job well done.

Small Craft Company honors LCpl Parrello

Last January, a hero from 2nd MARDIV&apos;s Small Craft Company was laid to rest. LCpl Brian Parrello was killed in action on January 1st in the Al Anbar province. His brothers held a memorial service for him on the shores of Lake Habbaniyah . His funeral service at home was equally fitting to a hero&apos;s memory. An attending Marine sent his brothers in Iraq this description:
 To the Marines of Small Craft Co,
Brian Parrello was laid to rest today at 10:30 EST in a very solemn and dignified ceremony in his home town.

The funeral mass took place at his church. It&apos;s a small church in West Milford on elevated ground with a cemetery on the hill behind it. I for one find it comforting that he&apos;ll be in his home town, near his church, where his family can visit him. Several hundred people were in attendance and the church couldn’t hold that many people. Many stood out in the rain or waited for the mass to end in an adjoining building.

The weather was to say the least, crappy. It was cold and wet and the ground was covered with snow and ice and mud on the hill where Brian&apos;s grave site was located. Only a Marine would appreciate the hump, uphill in the rain and the cold through snow and mud to bring Brian to his final resting place near the top of the hill. Most of the attendees walked more than a quarter mile in that nasty weather to make it to the graveside. They did so with no complaints.

The Marines of the I&amp;I staff and the Marine Reserve Unit 2/25 at Picatinny Arsenal did a fantastic job from beginning to end. Major Paulus and his staff had everything covered down to the finest detail. Brian&apos;s family was escorted every step of the way that I could see. The graveside ceremony went off without a hitch and was conducted with precision and grace. The Parrellos were surrounded by friends and family as they laid Brian to rest.

The entire hill was silent as the Marine pallbearers carried his flag draped coffin to the grave. It was no easy task as the ground was slippery and uneven, but they covered the ground silently and without incident. They made it look easy. They placed his coffin over the grave and stood at attention on either side as the graveside ceremony took place.

The rifle detail stood in the distance, looking sharp and executed the 21 gun salute. While almost everyone else had umbrellas or stood under the tent, they stood out in the pouring rain leaning into the icy hill. Anyone who’s stood at parade rest for a prolonged period of time can appreciate how hard it can be, especially when you’re leaning into the hill and in the cold and rain. Their feet had to be numb after just a few minutes of standing there. But the Marines of the rifle detail stood there, unflinching. Some things never leave you and as a Grunt I swear I could hear the M-16 rusting as they stood there in that unrelenting rain. At the designated time they executed the salute with perfect precision.

The pallbearers folded the flag as a bugler played taps.

The graveside ceremony concluded with 16 pipers and drummers from two bands playing the Marines Hymn in a slow solemn tempo.

I never knew Brian, and I regret that. I find similarities in that we&apos;re both from north Jersey, we both joined the Corps right out of high school and we both fought for our Corps and Country. As I said to Brian&apos;s brother, while we&apos;re all saddened by his loss, we can all take solace in the fact that he died a hero, doing something he loved and believed in, and in the company of great men. Marines, and other servicemen and women have been making the supreme sacrifice since the birth of our nation so that we may live free. Brian has reminded us once again that freedom isn&apos;t free and that Brave men and women are the reason we are the greatest nation in the world. He&apos;s our inspiration and we&apos;re all better people because of him.

I offer all of you my sincere condolences for your loss, and my sincere admiration for carrying the torch.

Semper Fi Marines! 

And his name lives on in Iraq. The name of the base camp is now known as FOB Parrello.

Another request from the front - no more books!

Last month, we printed a request from Sgt Morgan asking for donations of books for his Marines. You came through and your generosity is overwhelming - Sgt Morgan is now spending his limited free time building bookshelves and cataloging donations. They have enough and do not need more - if you still have books or DVDs to send, consider Books for Soldiers . It&apos;s highly recommended. Here&apos;s Sgt Morgan&apos;s e-mail thanking you for your support:

 I first want to thank every one of you, your friends, family, and fellow supports that have supported us here at the Prison. The library I have set up with your support is doing very well, and we have so many books, my free time goes to sorting them, building book shelves, and writing you wonderful people. Which is one of the reasons why I am emailing you all today. I try to pride myself in answering everyone of your emails and letters, but there is one that has slipped through the cracks. Before I had the chance to write down his Address someone cut it out of the box and burned it for security reasons. I am trying to reach a man by the name of Jim Bromely. He was a SSgt for 10 years in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s and was one of my very first donors. His letter is the only one sitting on my rack gaining dust because I don&apos;t have an address for him. If any of you know him I would appreciate his address so I can mail his letter.
Furthermore, I am so pleased to be a Marine, especially in these hard times. I have seen nothing but the Honor, Courage, and Commitment we so tightly hold on to from these Marines stationed here. I just want you all to know that the Marine Corps. is making me very proud and I hope they are doing the same for all of you. There isn&apos;t another organization in the world I would rather be apart of. I have been in the Marine Corps. for almost 6 years and this being my first combat tour has made me understand what all the hype is about the Marine Corps. When in reality it&apos;s not at all hype, it is the real thing. We play hard, work hard, train like we fight, and kick A$$ when were told. Semper Fi and God bless you all for your personal dedication to the corps.

Sgt Morgan
USMC

THE MARINES HAVE LANDED AND THE SITUATION IS WELL AT HAND! 


Update: Jim Bromley and Sgt. Morgan are in touch.

3/2 Marines ride the thunder

LtCol Mundy, 3/2 Commanding Officer sends an update from the Syrian border:

 I hope this update finds all of you well, and having enjoyed a happy Easter. April is here, which means we&apos;re ticking off the months until we return home! Your Marines and Sailors are continuing to do a fantastic job in the Al Qaim region, including Al Asad and Camp Gannon .
The battalion task force has been conducting many operations over the past month. Kilo and Weapons companies succeeded in capturing several important enemy leaders in the area, and have continued to discover mines and IEDs that threaten our movement. The threat of enemy mortar fire continues, but we are getting quicker at firing back at him to destroy his weapons and crews. The work of H&amp;S;Company in supporting the task force in all camps, and running convoys back and forth to Camp Gannon is crucial to our success. The Security Platoon from H&amp;S;has also been as busy as any platoon in the battalion.

In Camp Gannon , India company has also pushed out into the city near their base and conducted operations that captured and killed enemy personnel that have been harassing them. The security and protection of Camp Gannon is very good, so even though they are fired at by the enemy, most times that is nothing but an inconvenience to the men.

Lima Company is doing a fantastic job around Al Asad, conducting security missions very similar to the rest of the battalion out west. They have done patrols, vehicle check points, and are certainly doing a critical mission. The Battalion Commander and Sergeant Major they are currently attached to have talked to me and SgtMaj Mennig, and they rave over the professionalism of your Marines and Sailors. Lt. Wingate&apos;s 3d Platoon, Lima , is continuing a fabulous job as the Regimental Combat Team-2 Quick Reaction Force, involved in quickly springing onto insurgents when they are detected in the area. They were mentioned specifically in an article on www.usmc.mil , the Marine Corps Website. Lima Marines and Sailors are getting their mail, but again I encourage you to use this LAAD Battalion (the unit they are currently attached to) address to make sure it goes straight to them.

Rank and Name
Lima Company 2d LAAD Det-A
Unit 78087
FPO AE 09502-8087

As you can tell, everyone in the Task Force is involved in sharing the dangers here, and everyone is a vital member of the team. I can&apos;t accomplish my mission without the hard work of all your husbands, sons, fathers, and brothers. I am exceptionally proud of the job they are doing here, and you should be as well.

We have continued to get large deliveries of mail, and we appreciate it very much. I think we&apos;ve had great success across the board with keeping in touch via the Segovia internet and phones, but it is always special to receive the hand written cards and letters, and the boxes with treats from home are a great morale booster and make many days here seem like Christmas again! I would also like to thank the numerous churches and support groups who have “adopted” men in 3/2 for letters and care packages, and others who just send packages in support of the entire Task Force. The encouragement we get from knowing we have the support of our families, but also so many of the American people, is tremendous.

There continue to be stories written and posted about your men in 3/2. Most appear on the Marine Corps website, at www.usmc.mil . But, about ten days ago, we had a CNN crew that did several live interviews from Camp Gannon , and two stories about 3/2 Marines and Sailors in western Iraq . We&apos;re also getting a Chicago Tribune reporter coming to visit us soon, so keep watching the news to see information about your warriors in action.

Unfortunately, since the last time I wrote to you, we&apos;ve also suffered a few casualties, and while everyone here understands the nature of combat means we will have them, that knowledge doesn&apos;t make it any easier when we lose comrades or see them hurt. We held a great memorial service on 22 March in honor of our first Marine KIA, LCpl Kevin Smith, Security Platoon, H&amp;S;Company. He is a hero, and we&apos;ll miss him.

Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.

More from 3/3 . . . &quot;missions still to accomplish and a war to win&quot;

Kilo Company Marines sends holiday greetings, thanks to correspondents Capt Mallicoat and 1stSgt Santiago:

 Greetings once again and Happy Easter from Afghanistan. The weather has begun to ease with the onset of spring and we have begun getting outside the base more often despite the odd blizzard every few days. Our operational tempo has increased as the snow has retreated, but the run-off has produced another obstacle -- flooding in lower areas. Nonetheless, aerial assets have become more reliable and we have taken advantage of this increased support. In the last months, we have conducted or taken part in at least 1 battalion-level, 2 company-level and 9 platoon-level operations resulting in multiple caches discovered, medical care given to over 700 Afghans, and humanitarian assistance supplies given out to dozens of villages in 3 provinces throughout Afghanistan.
First, congratulations are in order for Corporal William and Mrs. Dove Mitchell in the birth of their daughter Lauren born on 19 March 25, 2005. Lauren measured a petite 19 inches and weighed 7 lbs, 2 oz. Both mother and daughter are doing well and are looking forward to Daddy&apos;s return. Congratulations to both happy parents on this newest little blessing.

The last two months have seen quite a few promotions to the next rank here in-country. Those Marines promoted in February were: Corporals David R. Myers, Michael J. Pruitt, Troy M. Arndt, and Jason O. Valencia; and Lance Corporal Michael A. Madalena. Those Marines promoted in March were: First Lieutenant Steven J. Boada; Corporal Ajuna A. Montano; and Lance Corporals Arden M. Wright, Chase A. Snyder, Stephen C. Richardson, Joshua P. Ott, Colin C. Nelson, Daniel L. Moss, Christopher L. Monsegue, James Meeks, Daniel J. Mariakis, Edward L. Holloway, Kristopher L. Giuranna, Emmanuel Diaz and Orlando Carrasquillo Jr. Congratulations to these Marines in their achievements in attaining the next rank.

Kilo Company also had 3 Marines reenlist in March. These Marines are: Sergeant Robert R. Campbell, Corporal Jon K. Burns and Corporal Michael J. Rowland. Sergeant Campbell will be changing assignment to Marine Forces Pacific on Camp Smith, Hawaii; both Corporals Burns and Rowland will be transferring to Weapons and Field Training Battalion aboard MCRD Parris Island. Congratulations, good luck and Godspeed to these Marines as they embark on another chapter of their careers.

Kilo also recently recognized a few Marines for receiving the Good Conduct Medal, which is awarded to Marines who serve 3 years without any incidents resulting in company non-judicial punishment or higher. These Marines are: Staff Sergeants Jose M. Giron (third award) and Robert A. Meyer (fourth award); Sergeant Thomas J. Hood (second award); and Lance Corporals Robert D Berve and Joseph E. Brinker (first awards).

Our family and friends have been very good to us throughout the deployment by sending much-needed supplies, from baby-wipes to bibles, from candy and pens for the Afghan children to cards and letters for the Marines themselves. In fact, our supporters have been so good to us that we no longer need any boxes to be sent to us for 2 reasons: 1) we will never use all the supplies we have and so intend to turn a lot over to our relieving unit, and 2) we will soon reach a point where we will be back home before boxes arrive.

These last months serving with your Marines and Sailors have made me proud to be called their commander and I feel a sadness in knowing I will soon give up that position. This deployment has changed a lot of us including myself, but we hold our freedoms more precious for it. For some of us, this will mark a time of transition as we become reacquainted with each other and, in some cases, prepare to move on to our next assignments. That light at the end of the tunnel is getting steadily brighter, but it is still a little ways away. Until we stand in that light, we in Kilo know that we have missions still to accomplish and a war to win. Until next time, take care and God bless each of you.

3/3 update from Afghanistan

Captain Sweeney updates us on his India Company Marines:

 As India Company nears the halfway mark in our deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, we have taken the time to take a step back and evaluate our impact on the country of Afghanistan thus far. Since arriving here in November, there have been some noticeable changes in the security of the Konar province. Your Marines and Sailors have been conducting a wide range of operations--capturing known terrorists and anti-government forces, recovering many weapons caches, clearing the roads so international workers can continue to build the infrastructure, and providing support to the local populace in the form of medicine, clothes, tools, and food. I need not say that they have been extremely busy and have all been doing an outstanding job. Our months ahead will prove to be just as productive as we continue to press the attack into the spring and summer months. 
February has served as our coldest month thus far. Of course, a little snow is not going to stop your Marines from continuing their mission; however, it is quite a change from the warm tropical breezes of Hawaii. The weather has had an impact on some operations, but we continue to adapt to our environment. Not allowing rain to pace us, India Company has moved throughout our area of operations and recovered several caches. Along with the caches, 2d and 1st platoon detained several individuals with ties to terrorist groups. Those individuals will no longer hinder the progress this country has made. We saw snow for the first time in Asadabad on the 17th of February. With conditions worsening in the later days of the month, 3d platoon set off for an eight-day field operation that followed a very wet four-day operation the week prior.
Also this month, the company conducted a relief-in-place between our 2d and 1st platoons at Camp Blessing. 2d platoon now calls Camp Eggers, Asadabad home after a very successful three months at Camp Blessing. 2d platoon&apos;s outstanding performance in the Nangalam area has caused the most dramatic changes in the province. In an area well known for supporting anti-government activity, the coalition has now gained the support of the local populace. 1st platoon will continue right where 2d left off, and I&apos;m sure they will do great things too. If you have a Marine or Sailor in 1st platoon, don&apos;t be surprised if the frequency of your loved ones calls lessen and their e-mails stop altogether. Camp Blessing has very limited commercial communication capabilities. For those of you with 2d platoon Marines, they should now have the opportunity to get behind a computer on a regular basis and catch up with all that is going on at home. Although there are a few more amenities in Asadabad, the Marines of 2d platoon are sure to miss the smaller, quieter, and more remote spoils of Nangalam.

I must mention again the support we have been receiving from home is incredible! Just yesterday the company received over 200 bags of mail. A lot of it has been stuck in Bagram for the past couple of weeks because of the weather. Please KEEP UP THE SUPPORT! As the company commander, I cannot stress enough the impact on the Marines’ morale when they receive a package or letter from a loved one. Many of the packages have come from support groups and India company alumni from all over the country. To those of you that have taken the time out of your busy days, I cannot thank you enough. As the Marines say, you truly are Great Americans! I only hope the Marines of India Company continue to make you proud as we continue the mission here in Afghanistan.

From the Soldiers, Sailors and Marines of India Company 3/3, Aloha.

Operation Iraqi Freedom II: Oregon Marines

Proud Marine cousin Amy Fascholtz-Ames sent this update from Major Anthony Randall who serves with HMLA 367. She reports that cousin Tony graduated from Bonanza High School (Bonanza, OR) and OIT (Klamath Falls). Grandparents Louis and Maren Randall own and operate the Circle 5 Ranch in Langell Valley. Several other family members still reside in the Bonanza and Klamath areas. The family is very proud of their Marine!

 As the Aircraft Maintenance Officer for Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron (HMLA) 367, it has been my intention to write on this subject for almost six months now. As our time in Iraq draws to a close I guess its time to put the idea on paper. In our squadron of approximately 345 Marines and Sailors, 260 of which work directly for me, there are 17 proud serving Oregonians. Its not my intent with this to be self-serving in any way. I will always have my own personal memories of the time that we spent in Iraq and that is all I will ever want. This is written is to bring to your attention, the quality of young men and women that the state of Oregon has produced and what some of them have accomplished.
Our deployment to Iraq started back in August when we departed from our home base, at Camp Pendleton, California. For the past seven months we have been living and conducting flight operations out of Al Taqaddum Airfield in central Iraq. Al Taqaddum is located in the lower, western corner of the Sunni Triangle between Ar Ramadi and Al Fallujah.

During our time here, both the Battle of Fallujah and the Iraqi national elections were conducted. To say the least, our time here has not been without excitement. For the majority of us that time has been hours and hours of pure boredom broken up by moments of sheer terror. Some of us are lucky enough to be pilots or aircrew on the AH-1Ws and UH-1Ns that the squadron flies. We have seen the Euphrates River Valley and the green fields that run along it. We have flown to places like An Najaf and Baghdad. We were the lucky ones.

The majority will spend the whole of their seven plus months within the confines of Al Taqaddum Airfield. This entails a six-minute walk each way from the living area to the hangar where they turn wrenches, bend metal, chase trons, repair weapons or load ordnance on helicopters. Most have seen the map on the wall showing the Euphrates River one mile to the north and Habbaniyah Lake one mile to the south and west, but as neither of these are visible, they have no concept of what lies beyond the main camp.

For most of the Marines in this squadron, Iraq is a pile of sand and dirt with a runway down the middle and some hangars and tents. Its sort of like being at camp for seven months. There is a very small exchange that is adequate for most living items, a chow hall, whose quality rises and falls like a sine wave, a tent with a bunch of donated books (thank you American public) and a gym with a strange assortment of both commercial and homemade weights and machines. Overall, pretty good for a deployed Marine base.

The biggest difference between this and a bad summer camp is that here, the tents have standing water inside every time it rains, the dust storms restrict visibility to less than 100 yards, and rockets and mortars occasionally fall on the base. During the build-up to the Fallujah battle the number of rocket and mortar rounds that impacted the base rose until we were getting hit every day. I believe that on the worst day there were 21 impacts and they all came within the space of about two minutes. Nothing worse than being in a chow hall with 100 other people who are trying to crawl under the table; unless its walking out in the open on the parking ramp with no cover anywhere.

Once the Fallujah battle was over that number fell significantly until we only received incoming about once every two weeks. We experienced a small buildup again leading up to the elections, but since then, our little piece of the theatre seems to have calmed down a bit. I hope it continues to stabilize.

Do I think that the Marines in this unit have had it hard? No. They all signed up for this and I think will all be better for it. As a pilot, I have been in direct support of those Marines whose pictures you have seen on the magazine covers and I know very well that they have had a much harder time then we ever did. Its like life; theres always someone who has it easier and always someone who has it harder.

The Marines in this unit spent their time keeping aircraft in the air in order to support the Marines in the thick of the battle on the ground. At the peak of the Fallujah battle most of them were working 14-hour days at a minimum. They had total focus and dedication for the task at hand. This squadron has flown over 1000 hours per month for the past six months. To put that in perspective, most HMLA squadrons fly in the neighborhood of 650 hours per month during peacetime operations.

These young Americans, and a couple who arent, have persevered in an austere environment month after month and of the complaints I have received, none have been about the job that we must do here. Some are of the opinion that the military is a place for those who had some sort of problem trying to go to college or get a real job, but I would tell you that is the thought process of a generation that was raised with a military of the draft.

An all-volunteer force is a wondrous thing. The people who are here want to be here. They are a cross section of the rest of you. They just happen to wear their countrys uniform to work every day. They are no different than the young men and women with whom I attended college, with the exception of the rules and regulations that they are required to live under. They have come to a war zone and performed admirably.

I am proud to be a Marine and I am proud to serve with each and every individual in this unit. But I am extremely proud to be one of the Marines that claim Oregon as their home. Some of these Marines, maybe all of them, will return to Oregon one day and continue to contribute as they have done here. If those contributions are equal to the level of performance I have witnessed here, Oregons future is bright indeed. Be proud of these young people and if you happen to have the good fortune to run into one of them on the street in the next couple of months, please welcome them home.

MGen Natonski wins the hearts and minds of a few 1/7 Marines

As 1/7 Marines waited through the last few hours in Kuwait prior to boarding planes for home, a few Bravo Company Marines were picked to load the plane. General Natonski walked over to them and asked them how they were so lucky to be selected as the work party. He then told them, &quot;You&apos;ll ride 1st class on the way home. My officers can sit in coach&quot; .
 
Here is one of them - LCpl Aaron Henehen on the right. My son, LCpl Shane Conrad is on the left. He wasn&apos;t part of the work party but spent some time visiting the Marines riding up front. I think they would have cheerfully ridden in the baggage compartment just to get back to the U.S.

Here is CG Natonski&apos;s latest message:

 During the next few weeks, elements of the Division will be redeploying back to home station. The past year has challenged us in many ways and in each endeavor the Marines, Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen of the Division have risen to the occasion. I cannot express my pride in the accomplishments of every member of the 1st Marine Division. In cities such as Al Qaim, Husaybah, Hit, Hadithah, Ramadi, Nukhayb, Ramadi, Habbiniyah, Fallujah, Karmah, Mahmudiyah, and Iskandariyah, we have faced a determined enemy and on every occasion the courage and spirit of the men and women of the Blue Diamond have carried the day. The capture of Fallujah and the Iraqi elections that followed in January can be viewed as turning points for the future of Iraq. In recent months we have seen hope and freedom begin to take root and we are optimistic that democracy will take hold. This is due in no small part to the hard work and perseverance of the members of the Division.
On many occasions I have used the phrase One team, one fight to describe our efforts in Iraq. The Blue Diamond was at times composed of Marines from all four Marine Divisions, the Armys Strike Brigade of the 2d Infantry Division, the Blackjack Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, 2-2 Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division, Army Psychological Operations and Civil Affairs units, Special Operations Forces, and the 24th and 31st MEUs. We would not have enjoyed the success we had without the support and efforts of these distinguished units.

Our success has come with a price. We will forever remember our fallen comrades who have given their lives in our mission. Our thoughts and prayers go to their loved ones.

I want to extend my thanks to the many volunteers who maintained the Divisions Family Readiness network. Your sacrifice and hard work throughout the deployment was critical to ensuring that our Marines and Sailors were able to focus on the tasks at hand. Your mission was vital and you executed it with professionalism and compassion.

We all eagerly anticipate our reunion. Every member of the Division will be afforded the opportunity to take leave in order to rest and adjust to life at home again. I ask your assistance in ensuring that everyone returns safely back to their home station after their leave period. We deserve to celebrate our accomplishments and our return home to families and friends, but we need to do it in a safe and smart manner.

May God bless the 1st Marine Division and its families and friends.

Finishing Strong

 The Green Side is updated - RCT 1 is coming home.

In one of his last second-tour letters home, LtCol Bellon describes the difference brought through the efforts of his Marines.

 As I have said before, Fallujah is now thought of as a &quot;safe zone&quot; by the citizens. The atmosphere of fear and intimidation is now lifted. People move about during the day without fear. The curfew remains at night and frankly, that is just fine with the people. Iraqis outside the city talk of how safe they feel when they come to Fallujah. Talk about a truly incredible turnaround.
Last night we went up to the roof of the building where we stay and looked out over the city. Many lights are back on and more come on each night. It was quiet as could be. Perhaps the best description I can offer is &quot;peaceful.&quot; There is no doubt that the muj will continue bring episodes of violence and terror to Fallujah. It is inevitable but they cannot undo the hope that is growing inside the people that things are getting better.

While the men have been working inside the city, other Marines have been relentlessly chasing and attriting the enemy outside the city. We have had more success capturing high value targets in the last week than perhaps during any other during my 22 months here. Once again, the Marines continue to exceed expectation. Instead of coasting in and playing it safe, they are pouring on the coal and finishing strong. The result has been a number of indicators of insurgent leadership seeking to open a dialogue with the Iraqi Government. Again, not to put too rosy a picture on it but it really is encouraging to the guys who have been here grinding away. The bad news for the enemy is that fresh legs are here and it is about to get worse for them.
 

 Read the rest.

&quot;We made a difference&quot;

My son will soon be home. Seven months ago, he left for his second deployment to Iraq and has spent those seven months in one of the most remote locations, at the end of the mail and supply lines. His phone call yesterday (3:00 a.m., sitting on the back porch in my pajamas to get the best cell phone reception) brought some very good news. He said that after having been isolated for seven months, seeing what has happened to mainstream Iraq is incredibly encouraging. Democracy is taking hold. There is positive optimism. And, that makes it worth the sacrifice. At 21, Shane has spent almost 6% of his life in Iraq, helping to bring freedom and democracy to people who wish to live in peace. And he can see that he and the thousands of other Marines, soldiers, sailors, airmen, and others who have given their sweat, tears, blood - and in some cases their lives - have made a difference. They&apos;re coming home, but they are leaving a legacy of freedom behind.

12 heartbreaks, 12 cuts to the soul

Another hero falls - and we all mourn with his family. I have the address if anyone would like to send condolences. Here is LtCol Mark A. Smith&apos;s tribute to Lance Corporal Andrew W. Nowacki:

 It is with profound grief that I report to you the death of Lance Corporal Andrew W. Nowacki, Truck Platoon, H&amp;S;Company, 2nd Bn, 24th Marines, United States Marine Corps. LCpl Nowacki was killed when an improvised explosive device detonated on his motorized patrol while he was operating as a machine gunner in the turret of an up-armored security high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle. LCpl Nowacki was immediately secured by his platoon mates and air-medevaced to the Combat Surgical Hospital in Baghdad where he was pronounced dead.
LCpl Nowacki was a crushing loss for this Battalion. A crushing loss for the fact that he had joined the ranks of our fallen heroes, and for the impact he had on his fellow Marines. As I attended the memorial service, I was overwhelmed by the words spoken by his closest friends and fellow Marines during the teammate remembrances portion of the ceremony. All of them spoke of his unbelievable spirit. They spoke of his ability to never be down, no matter what the circumstances. They spoke of his always smiling, always laughing and always being the one that everyone else leaned on when the going was rough or uncomfortable. They simply made it clear that he was the rock upon which so many drew their strength. Such men are the leaders around which other men find steadiness and courage in dark times.

Now, one of the unfortunate parts of being the Battalion Commander of over 1,100 of the World&apos;s finest warriors, is that you just do not get the chance to know all of them in personal ways. You know all of them by face and name, and usually some glowing characteristic about them, but to understand them all at a deep level is just not an option. LCpl Nowacki was just such a Marine for me. However, on the day he achieved authorized entrance at his new post in Heaven, something happened that I shall never forget, so long as air fills my lungs, a song fills my heart, and thoughts of thanks fill my head for having been so lucky and honored to have shared the earth with such MEN as LCpl Nowacki.

To understand what it was that happened on his last day of earthly existence, I have to paint a bit of background, so bear with me. Now, Marines by nature are a cocky bunch; that is one of the things that makes them run to the sound of gunfire when everyone else is running away from it. And, part of being cocky is being &quot;macho&quot; in your bearing. In my numerous travels about the AO, I am always asking the Marines why they never wave at each other. I mean, when we pass one of our many checkpoints, where the Marines on duty are doing deadly work, living hard and suffering great discomfort, I fail to understand why their fellow Marines fail to give them a quick wave or a thumbs up. But, you should see them. As the sentry at a checkpoint waves a patrol of vehicles through, the ritual of &quot;I am badder than you are&quot; begins. Each Marine stares the other one down through any number of brand names of ballistic goggles and covered in pounds of armor and high tech killing gear. As they come abreast of each other, the tolerant scorns are exchanged and no words spoken. It is as if each one is trying to communicate to the other via telepathy the same message: &quot;you wussy, you don&apos;t have it half as bad as I do.&quot; Now, when they actually are around each other and not on some combat duty, well, then it is high fives and hugs and banter and jokes! But, on duty, the ritual seems rigid, inflexible and a violation of some unwritten code if it is broken.

So, back to the day when a piece of my heart was broken and part of my soul was crushed forever, Feb 26. The day that will always be remembered and honored in the Smith household as the day LCpl Nowacki departed gate 3 at FOB St. Michael, and later that day met St. Michael face to glorious face. On this day, we were scheduled to take the leadership of the unit that will replace us on a tour of the Mayhem AO. Now, we have our procedures down to a science, but as can be expected, when joining units unfamiliar to our ways, some confusion reigns. The confusion on this day led to some delays in our departure and a shifting of the &quot;timeline.&quot; Any time the &quot;timeline&quot; shifts, Mayhem 6 becomes a not so nice person to be around. So, our vehicles were staged, our Warriors armored, locked and loaded and waiting for departure. This of course meant, the ritual of the &quot;game face&quot; was underway. I was standing next to my vehicle monitoring the radios and waiting for the final elements to fall in place when a second motorized patrol began to make movement passed our staged vehicles. By the combination of armored HMMWVs and 7 Ton trucks, I knew instantly it was &quot;Heavy Roller&quot; (the tireless Marines of Truck Platoon and Marines from H&amp;S;who move about the AO daily in support of hundreds of tasks supporting the Battalion, and who does so with their own skilled and self-provided security that has engaged many a Muj with the skill and precision of any of my infantry elements). And, at the head of the column was a Marine standing behind his machine gun in the turret, with the largest smile on his face you had ever seen, and waving. Waving at every one of our vehicles that he passed at 5 mph as they followed their ground guide to the dismount point. I watched this and knew this was a Marine with a special heart! He was dispensing with the ritual. He had no need for pretention, no need for &quot;badness.&quot; He was a Marine &quot;comfortable in his own skin,&quot; as it were, and among those he loved. Something struck me as I was watching this Marine wave: he was living every day as if it might be his last, and he did not want to leave any unfinished business. You see, when we think of waving, we assume it is to say hello. But in this case, he was also waving goodbye, for the Marine who struck me on this day was Lance Corporal Andrew W. Nowacki. And hours later he would be dead...but no doubt, born again to new life.

In eulogizing their beloved brother, LCpl Nowacki&apos;s platoon mates reiterated the theme that he was ALWAYS the one that every one else clung to when they were at their worst, because he was always at his best. He was always joking, always laughing, always smiling. He was described as &quot;the most unprofessional professional Marine&quot; they had ever known. Far from being oxymoronic, to all Marines, that is the description of the Warrior upon whom so many have leaned on since the Corps was established. All Marines and Veteran Marines reading this will instantly know what I am talking about and will remember a Marine from their platoon who had the same quality and spirit of life as LCpl Nowacki.

As this week has gone on, as all weeks do, and I thought about how I would speak about LCpl Nowacki&apos;s death, I received news both here and from home of several children&apos;s births. That is always a cause for celebration. But what I really was thinking was: I wonder; I wonder how many of these parents who have just received the greatest gift God has to offer will teach them? Will they teach them of the deeds of men like LCpl Nowacki? Will they teach them that life is precious, and freedom it&apos;s greatest gift and deepest desire of mankind? Will they teach them to be prepared to either repel the evil doer or support those who do? I wonder? For I know one thing, 12 times every year, from here on out to my final rest, my wife, my daughters and I will stop on the 12 dates that some of the finest men the planet has ever known breathed their last, and we will say &quot;thank you.&quot;

We will say thank you by name. We will say thank you by name and we will light a candle. We will say thank you by name, we will light a candle and we will pray for our fallen heroes and their familes. Then, we will reflect on our lives. Our grand and wonderful lives lived free, and we will remember. We will remember that no matter how distasteful, no matter how much the mind does not want to believe it and no matter how much the body rejects it, freedom has a very great cost! And that that cost is borne by young Warriors from generation to generation. We will remember, and we will say thank you again!

So, in closing, my heart has 12 breaks and my soul 12 cuts, and time will not heal them. God willing I will return home and I WILL be the same man I was for my wife and my daughters, as I believe we all will be. No, scratch that, we will be better men for the lessons we learned from those 12 breaks and those 12 cuts. And, on the day of my death, should the Lord be willing and I make it home, I know exactly what I am going to do when I see Lance Corporal Andrew W. Nowacki. When I see him...I am going to wave! I am going to wave at him and then I am going to salute him.

LCpl Nowacki: you waved that final fateful day, and I truly believe you were saying both hello and goodbye. So tonight, and in this letter, on behalf of all the Mad Ghosts, upon whom you had such an impact and have left such a hole: goodbye sweet Warrior! May the light of Jesus surround you, may the touch of his hand heal you and may you never know another tear, for ours flow freely for loss of you!

May God Bless and be with the Nowacki Family in this time. The Mad Ghosts are here for you.

May God Bless and Keep the Magnificent Families of 2/24.

Mark

 &quot;For those who, in a dark and terrifying hour, saw what needed to be done- and did it.&quot; - Lynne Jonell, Bravemole
 


Tim Carroll sent along this note describing how LCpl Nowacki was honored upon his final arrival home:

 LCPL Nowacki served his country two fold, United States Marine and a Police Officer for Grand River, Ohio a suburb of Cleveland.
Accordingly, when he arrived home last Friday night (3/4) some 50 - 150 Police and Military vehicles escorted him to the funeral home where at the funeral home waiting in chilling night air were about 100 people who came to pay their respects.

 On Monday, as is custom in Police Funerals, Officers from all over the area, the US and Canada came to honor him. 

God Speed Officer Nowacki and Thank you.

One step closer to home

My son called at 3:00 this morning - he&apos;s one step closer to coming home. No more helicopter rides, so another worry crossed off my list. After 7 months on the Syrian border, living in very spartan conditions, the variety of options available on the interim base is overwhelming. There is fast food after months of MREs. A PX where he&apos;s gone shopping for the first time in months. There are women who are not wearing burkas. And, when he comes home, we&apos;ll continue the culture shock in Las Vegas. I am driving down to 29 Palms next week and will be there when the bus comes in. Right now, I&apos;m overwhelmed with emotion - after seven months of anxiety, homecoming is almost here.

Request from the front - send books!

 UPDATE - April 6, 2005 - Sgt. Morgan thanks you all for your generosity and requests no more books. He&apos;s running out of room and spending his free time building bookshelves and cataloging donations. If you still have books to send, consider Books for Soldiers . It&apos;s a wonderful organization and the troops are very appreciative. Here&apos;s the original post: 
Here&apos;s a worthy request from Sgt Morgan who is looking out for the morale of his Marines. If you have a few extra books or magazines lying around, put them in an envelope, send them to Iraq, and make a few Marines happy. And while you&apos;re at it, put in a few extra care package items - they&apos;ll appreciate it.

 I am trying to set up a Marine Corps library for the Marines on this base. This place is out in the middle of nowhere and is at the end of the supply chain in Iraq. If the Marines here need anything they have to take a 30 to 45 min convoy for books and stuff. The less traveling we have to do the better. If there is any donations you like to send in way of books or any reading material, the Marines and on this base would greatly appreciate it.
If there are any other companies that you know of that might want to donate reading materials please share this address. 

Sgt Morgan follows up with this suggestion:

 I feel it&apos;s important to have books on motivation and Marine Corps history for young Marines to read. They get inspired knowing that in the past there have been men and women that have done the same things they are doing in the present. 

My son also suggests any kind of magazine . . . but Marines will especially enjoy those dealing with bodybuilding, truck and car, and other men&apos;s magazines (no porn - it&apos;s against regs - but they do enjoy Maxim). I also send hometown newspapers, news magazines, business and investment news. There&apos;s not much opportunity to spend their paychecks while deployed, so entrepreneurial magazines go over well.

Paperbacks - check out the new books table at Costco and load &apos;em up. They&apos;ll feel the love from home . . . especially if the box contains a few treats (non-melting candy, snacks, and a card or letter from you).

Five Outstanding Marines

2nd LAR Apache Company is filled with outstanding Marines. Here are four of them from 3rd Platoon, plus an essential addition to any combat unit - a Navy corpsman, as related by 1stLt Joshua M. Phares.

 Lance Corporal Phillips LCpl Phillips is from VA where his family currently resides presently. LCpl Phillips is the platoon mechanic and in my eyes just short of a god. Some how he has managed to keep all of our vehicles running and combat effective in the harshest environment. LCpl Phillips is another one of my Marines that can speak two languages, English being his primary language and country being his second primary language as he would say. Justin is well liked and highly respected in the platoon and has earned the respect of his NCOs and leaders above him. If it were not for LCpl Phillips the very nice house we live in, relative to Iraqi standards, would still be with out lights. He has only been shocked a handful of times and it is said to be healthy for him. I am not sure who said it but it makes him feel better each time he gets shocked, I think. Justin is expecting a baby girl at the end of March and is very excited to see her when he gets home. LCpl Phillips&apos; goals after the Marine Corps are to live at home and have his wife take care of him, a plan still in the works; he has not run it by his wife yet. LCpl Phillips is a one in a million Marine and has been a pleasure to work with the entire time. Justin wanted to say hello to his family back home in Virginia and he will be home in time for striper fishing.
 Private First Class Griffith 
PFC Griffith is the squad automatic machine gunner for 1 and is an asset to have on the vehicle. PFC Griffith is from IL where his family currently resides. He is also expecting a baby girl shortly after he returns home from deployment and is very excited about seeing his new daughter. PFC Griffith is a very versatile Marine. He has the ability to kick in the door and keep his cool under pressure one minute and turn around and tell you a joke the next minute. He is the source of many people laughing much of the time and can always be counted on to keep peoples spirits up. PFC Griffith has performed outstanding the entire tour and is excited to get home and see the Cubbys play ball in the spring. PFC Griffith has been an outstanding diplomat from the US always handing out candy to the kids while on patrols only making fun of them half of the time. PFC Griffith has undeniably gained the confidence of every Marine in the platoon to watch their 6 and the respect of all his leaders, even though he is usually making fun of the Platoon Commander. PFC Griffith is still undecided about his future in the Marine Corps. There is no question in any of his peers or leaders minds though that he would be an asset for this organization to hold on to. PFC Griffith has outstanding leadership skills and will succeed in what ever he does in the future. His Platoon Commander is confident in that, again even though Griffith makes fun of him.

 Lance Corporal McGing 
LCpl McGing hails from OH and is the gunner for 2. This is a vital role being that 2 is the point vehicle for most of the company operations and all of the platoon operations putting him up front. He is the first person to see much of what lies ahead and the first person to be able to detect any threats that the convoy may encounter. LCpl McGing can give early warning to his platoon and follow on forces about possible enemy threats and obstacles. LCpl McGing has handled this responsibility well and continues to impress his vehicle commander, Sgt Shaw. The noteworthy accomplishment of LCpl McGing is that he is originally a 0311, infantryman. He had the pleasure of being put in a drivers billet the last time he came over here in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 1 and remained a crewman because of his success. He has performed outstanding throughout his transition from infantryman to driver and from driver to gunner. LCpl McGing has proven himself in all aspects of being a Marine, both in Garrison and in Combat, time and time again and has earned the trust and respect of both his peers and leaders appointed over him. He would like to say hello to his family back home and to his son. He does not like to brag about it but he has also successfully read the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings for the 8th time since arriving in country, a feat for not just any man.

 Lance Corporal Fairchild 
LCpl Fairchild is from RI and is the squad automatic machine gunner for the crew of 2. LCpl Fairchild takes his job very seriously and is always professional and trustworthy. As a scout LCpl Fairchild provides security to the flanks and rear of the vehicle. He also conducts dismounted patrols and vehicle and house searches. LCpl Fairchild is a very valuable part of the platoons operations as the translator. LCpl Fairchild went to a month long school prior to deployment in country that focused on the Arabic language and prepared him to intermingle with the local population. A very important part of security and stabilization operations. Among the previously named qualities of LCpl Fairchild, he is also the duty expert on just about everything from ancient history to politics. Much of the time he leaves his crew with confused looks on their face, kind of like when you try teaching your dog a new trick. He has a few good conspiracy theories, brought on by the horrific punk music he listens to, or at least that is what his vehicle commander and platoon commander think. LCpl Fairchild is thinking about making the Marine Corps his career choice and would definitely do well. LCpl Fairchild has proven himself under fire and in many stressful situations. Matt would like to say hello to his beloved girlfriend, his also loved Mom and Dad, and the rest of his family back in Rhode Island. He would also like to say hello to the other 10 people that live in Rhode Island as well. He will see you soon.

 Corporal Basso 
Cpl Basso is from NJ where a majority of his family still resides in the immediate area. Cpl Basso is the lead scout for Bravo section (one half of the platoon) and is directly responsible for 8 scouts. Cpl Basso rides on the Platoon Sergeants vehicle. This is the 2nd time he has deployed with SSgt Keisler so things run pretty smoothly, meaning he knows when to argue and when to shut up. SSgt Keisler, Cpl Bassos vehicle commander has known him since he was a PFC in the Battalion and has been with him as he progressed up the ranks. SSgt Keisler continues to push him past his limits encouraging him to excel and preparing him for the next rank of Sergeant. Cpl Basso has all the confidence from his leaders that he will have success at this rank as well. SSgt Keisler has many stories on Cpl Basso, most of them he keeps to himself as leverage. He could not think of any that he could write in this with out damaging any chances of Cpl Basso having a political career in the future. Cpl Basso is a very resourceful Marine who can be tasked with acquiring almost anything that the platoon needs. Cpl Basso is looked up to by all the junior Marines for his wisdom and experience as well as respected by his peers and seniors for his ability to accomplish the mission. His future plans are still open, wavering between reenlisting or in his words sitting back after he gets out and chilling for awhile and then getting a job at a casino. SSgt Keisler personally hopes he decides to reenlist and continue to give his knowledge to Marines of the future. He would like to say hello to all his friends and family back home and to keep on sending him packages.

 HN Cannon 
HM Cannon is from CO and is the platoons corpsmen. He is referred to simply as DOC among other things that the very loving Marines in the platoon call him. It is not easy being one of the few Navy personnel in the company and the only Navy personnel in the platoon but there is no doubt of his ability and is trusted by every Marine in his platoon that he will take care of them if injured. Doc Cannon rides on the Platoon Sergeants vehicle and as everyone knows is not an easy task due to having to go on many re-supply runs. Coincidently, Doc finds someone that needs medical attention many of those times. Doc Cannon is very energetic, motivated, and always ready to pull the trigger if need be. Doc has progressed a long way since first joining the platoon. In his Platoons eyes, Doc is the best junior corpsman in the entire company and at times of conflict rises to the occasion, a trust that has come through treating the injured under fire on several different occasions. His ability to treat patients in a timely manner gives them more of a chance for a healthy recovery and he has not let anyone down so far. Doc seems to have a sixth sense, appearing many times with his medical bag ready to go without even being briefed. Doc plays a big part in winning the hearts of the local population giving children candy and treating everything from eye infections to broken bones. Doc was promoted from HA to HN while being over here and is currently studying for his Fleet Marine Force pin, a very good accomplishment for corpsmen who work directly with the Marine Corps. Doc says that he misses hanging out with friends from home and he is looking forward to seeing friends and family upon his arrival back in the states and it will not be much longer. Doc Cannons future goals are to go back to college and finish school when he gets out.

Mad Ghost Families: THEY GAVE, AND THEY GIVE!

In which LtCol Smith pays tribute to his wife (grab a tissue - you&apos;ll need it) and the amazing families of the 2/24 Marines:

 I trust this update reaches you while you are in OUTSTANDING spirits, full of motivation and singing the Marine&apos;s Hymn as you go about your daily duties! If not, let&apos;s work on that, for all three are now standard requirements for the families that comprise the Mad Ghost Mayhem Battalion.
This week I have decided to forego any details of the adventures of the Mad Ghosts. I can assure you that this week MANY ENORMOUS enemy weapons caches were uncovered and safely detonated, MANY of our most high value targets have been watching their Lieutenants and Operations Officers find themselves in the custody of the Mad Ghosts, and the Iraqi citizens of our zone ever increase their cooperation with us in rooting out the evil insurgents, terrorists and criminals that have repressed them and brutalized them for decades. Yes, we march ever closer to total victory and a safer world for all through the establishment of democracy and freedom in a zone of the world that has not known it, and blamed us!

No, this week I am going to discuss the exploits of another very special group of Mad Ghosts; the Mad Ghost families of 2/24. For in the last 6 months, I have come to witness, through selfless acts, through phenomenal patriotism, through unbelievable support and through unbridled dignity the most Amazing collection of human beings one could ever hope to be associated with: the Mad Ghost families of 2/24. I have seen more beauty, more love, more compassion, more support, more inter-connectedness and more of Heaven than any poor gun toter from Indiana should ever be allowed to see while in earthly existence! Now, it would be virtually impossible for me to detail for you ALL of the amazing things I have been witness to of the Mad Ghost Families of 2/24, and even if I had the time and space, my words and descriptions of the accounts would be insufficient to do justice to those acts, so if you will bear with me and allow me to beg your indulgence, I will focus on a few. Those few are representative of so many, of the collective you might say, and without a doubt the Mad Ghost families of 2/24 proved the social philosophy theory of THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS. For together you have cried, together you have laughed, together you have loved, together you have missed and been longed for, and together you have helped and supported the families of my fallen heroes! For all these, but in particular for the caring of our wounded families who have buried their beloved and bade them God&apos;s grace, well, for that you have one unrefined LtCol in the USMCR at your every behest, your every beck and call.

I have always tried to deflect attention away from me in these updates, for it is the Commander who reaps both the credit and blame of a unit. But, in 2/24, ALL credit for the unbelievable success of your Mad Ghosts, rests with the Mad Ghosts themselves, their amazing Company Commanders and my tireless Staff. Me, I have been but the luckiest SOB on the planet just to observe it all in action. However, I am going to have to take a little bit of the spotlight myself tonight, sort of. See, for as lacking as I am, one thing I executed perfectly, one judgement that I cannot be questioned on is the choice of a spouse. My wife Sheila, has a strength and beauty that exceeds her physical beauty, which is something in itself to behold. Now, this lady who accepted my hand in marriage, after my active duty time in the USMC, has struggled with me through the times that have left lesser marriages in the dirt. All the way, she taught me and mentored me that the marriage is first and foremost about the committment, and exemplified that in her many days of stress over my chosen occupations. Her answer was always one of support. She has seen more than her fair share of separations, and through them all, she stands at the end of it with a smile on her face, an embrace in her arms and heart, and a home and family both in far better shape then when I left them. She has taught me so much, and doesn&apos;t even know it. For that, I am to blame. But this time, and in front of all the Mad Ghost families of 2/24, I am going to thank her properly and give her her due. You see, all she has done for me could fill a Dr. Phil book on loving, but nothing more than what she did for me a little over a month ago. Unbeknownst to me, my wife had suffered a herniated disc in her back. The pain so excrutiating, she could rarely sit. She was forced to either stand or lie. Her answer to this dilema was to continue to tend to our daughters, our house and all the duties that you all know too well that accompany managing a family solo.

And, when the pain was almost too much, and at our Doctor&apos;s begging, she had surgery. Surgery that would lay her out for a couple of weeks, with many more weeks of extremely limited duty. She executed all the planning required to ensure our girls had rides to their Catholic school, that homework would still be done, that they could get to gymnastics, that there would be lunches for them and meals at home and every other stinking detail of raising kids that makes planning combat operations appear as child&apos;s play. She does all this so she can have the surgery and know her duties as a mother have been accounted for. Then she has the surgery. And she begins her recuperation. All of this I am made aware of AFTER THE IRAQI ELECTIONS.

Now, for my personality, or lack thereof depending on your perspective, I wanted to rage with anger, but when you hear &quot;I just did not want you to worry, because you had such important things going on,&quot; well, the selflessness of the act overwhelms you and there is but one emotion: humility. Humility and bewilderment as to what it is that you have ever done to deserve such a woman. That bewilderment will last a lifetime. So, to my wife, and let me say for all the 2/24 Marines who have who have wives like mine, I RESPECT YOUR STRENGTH, I ADMIRE YOUR COURAGE, I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT, AND I LOVE YOU!

Oh, and one other thing my wife did, was to bear me two angels. Two angels straight from Heaven. How else do you explain an 8 year old and a 6 year old who donated hundreds of toys to Toys for Tots, and who got the only Christmas present they wanted: a framed picture of LCpl Daniel Wyatt, (killed in action in Iraq with 2/24) and a letter from Mr. Wyatt. That is what adorned their tree last Christmas; but I believe as a result, Daniel protected them and the Lord adorned their hearts. So, to Nichole and Brittani, and all the Mad Ghost children just like them, let me say on behalf of all Mad Ghost daddies: I AM PROUD OF YOU, YOU ARE PATRIOTS AND I LOVE YOU!

Next: Joannie Watson, my niece. 21 years old and full of life as a 21 year old should be. Currently in Rome. What does she do with her time? Party? No. Shop for fine Italian clothes? No. Seek the best Italian restaurants? No. She climbs the concrete stairs that in the Catholic tradition are believed to have been the steps Christ climbed to be condemned by Pilate. She climbs those stairs to pray for me and the Mad Ghosts. She climbs stairs and prays for us, at 21. Oh, by the way, she climbs them on her knees! Unbelievable. Unbelievable, and again, humbling. To Joannie and the amazing and faithful Watson family, from all the Mad Ghosts, Thank You and May God Bless You.

Sharon Semrow, Key Volunteer Coordinator for Fox Company. Sharon Semrow, or call sign: the Semrow, mother of 6! Gives so freely of her self in service of others as a Key Volunteer, that the VFW submits her for an award, and she wins! National Key Volunteer of the Year. Sharon is representative of all of our Key Volunteers and their selflessness in the face of adversity. Who in their right mind could expect a mother of 6 to be a key volunteer coordinator? Nobody! Nobody that is except the spirit that drives the soul of Sharon Semrow and those like her. Unbelievable. Unbelievable and humbling. To Sharon, and all the volunteers that are the Key Volunteer Network, Thank You and May God Bless You.

Regina Simon, wife of Chad Simon. Chad is a SSgt with Golf Company who was critically wounded in an IED that took the lives of three of our magnificent Marines in October. Regina, who maintains a bedside vigil with her husband in a VA hospital in Minnesota, and who has children who are still being raised. She takes the time to send me an email offering her prayers for me and the Marines and families of 2/24. Unbelievable. Unbelievable and humbling. And, although my heart wants to break for her so bad, it does not. It does not because she is an absolute pillar of strength and hope. So strong indeed, she keeps YOUR heart from breaking. There is no such thing as doing too much for Chad and Regina, as she is a light for all the world of faith, hope and love. To Regina, the prayers of an entire battalion of Marines are with you, Chad and your family, and I believe a legion of Angels surrounds you and admires you for what you are and for what you have shown us all. To Regina, Chad and all our wounded and families of our wounded, May God be with You.

Cpl Prenning&apos;s mother and father. Cpl Prenning KIA of 2/24. They send me emails congratulating us on our successes, wishing us well and praying for us. The selflessness stymies the mind. They would have every right to close out the world, and especially the Marine Corps; but in their selflessness, in their LOVE, they reach out and they bring peace to us with their words, and their strength. Unbelievable. Unbelievable and humbling. That the Lord be always by your side, that is our wish for you.

Cpl Hammond&apos;s parents. Cpl Hammond KIA of 2/24. They send their son&apos;s platoon commander the story of going to Camp Pendleton and of meeting with President Bush. They talk of how the President knew much about their son, to include calling him &quot;Nate.&quot; The talk of the President crying with them, and of his genuine pain for their loss. They talk of the pride of receiving a personal Presidential Bronze coin, and of the burden of the President. What about their burden? No mention of it. Just talk of their pride in their heroic son, and of well wishes for his mates that are 2/24. Unbelievable. Unbelievable and humbling.

The Warns family. Family of Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Warns KIA of 2/24. The family who produced a video so moving, so incredible, so deeply touching that to this day I have been unable to complete a viewing of it in its entirety due to my need to control my sobbing. Now, please, no attempt at anything but sincerity here, but the Bobby Warns video should receive an academy award for its power, its majesty, its tribute to Bobby. I have NEVER seen anything as painful, yet as beautiful as that video. If you think about it, kind of the absolute analogy of this War. Right and beautiful in its cause, unbelievably painful in its violence and loss. The Warns, all of them, routinely email me with prayers and well wishes. Unbelievable. Unbelievable and humbling.

Now, these are but some of the amazing events the last 7 months of my life&apos;s history have touched me with. Many is the day I have asked myself what is wrong with me? I used to be basically emotionless, and now can cry at the drop of a hat. I mean, I should have season tickets to the Oprah show. But, as we close our time on our deployment, it hit me. It is that I have been touched by the hand of God over the last 7 months, touched daily and touched deeply. And as is always the case with God, he has used the people in our lives to do it. He has done it with the Mad Ghosts of 2/24 and the Mad Ghost families of 2/24. He has done it through all of you! Why do I say it is God? Well, pretty simple, because if you look at the snapshots I have described above, they all have one unmistakeable characteristic in common. SELFLESSNESS! The absence of self. They are a continuum of acts for which those acting received nothing. THEY GAVE. THEY GAVE, AND THEY GIVE! The absolute antithesis of what our &quot;modern&quot; culture tells us we should be. And the amazing thing, when the self is gone, the end result is not the reaching of personal goals, but the touching of interpersonal souls! Now, no matter what or who your god is, that has to be the ultimate goal, else this is all for not. And, I for one, will not believe that.

So in closing I have attached two items. One are the poems that Sheena wrote for the funeral of her brother, and our hero LCpl Wichlacz. Now, get your tissues ready for it is painful reading. But more than painful, it is beautiful. It is the tribute of love and honor between and brother and a sister, that CANNOT and WILL NOT be broken by death. And I dare say, Sheena could write these words for she let go of self. She gave all for her brother, and you will be, like I was, touched and forever a better person for her selflessness expressed in her words. God Bless and Keep You Sheena, you are amazing.

Then, after you have gathered yourself and feeling the sting of death, open the second attachment. For it will be living proof that in losing of self, peace and healing DO follow the suffering. For the picture is the fiancee of PFC Vroman, KIA 2/24. The picture needs no words. God Bless PFC Vroman&apos;s fiancee, whose name I will not use, for right now, and in her selflessnes, I believe she would prefer to be called: PFC Vroman&apos;s fiancee.

After you view those, and reflect upon this update, you will know why I live every stinking day of this deployment in utter disbelief that I could be granted such a glimpse of heaven. If I never achieve it for real, it will be for my own failures, but if I ever do get there, it will be much like my life is now and will be full of people like the amazing Mad Ghosts and Mad Ghost families of 2/24.

Yeah, as I ponder our last couple of weeks fighting the Muj and bringing freedom to Iraq, I find the words of that famous philospher Rod Stewart most appropriately describe my life this last 6 months: &quot;some guys have all the luck.&quot;

May God Bless and Keep the Magnificent Families of 2/24.

Here&apos;s the dedication to LCpl Wichlacz:

 A DEDICATION TO TRAVIS ... MY BIG BROTHER ... MY MARINE!
The Strength Of My Soldier

You Are The Strongest ... Of Those I&apos;ve Met And Known.
You&apos;ve Progressed So Much, And I&apos;m Proud - Of The Way You&apos; Grown.
You&apos;ve Succeeded - In All You&apos;ve Done, And It&apos;s Clear To Me Now ... That You Are The Chosen One.

My Angel - My Strength, And The Tears In My Eyes.
I Know Deep Down In My Heart ... You&apos;ve Never Left My Side.
Through The Smiles I Smile, And The Tears I Cry - I Known That God Is Not One To Lie And Though This May Seem - Like A Goodbye - I Want You To Know ... That It&apos;s Really Hello.

As Your Little Sister ... I Refuse To Let Go. And As The Tears - Drip Down My Face, I Realize You&apos;ve Been Taken - To A Better Place. Your Presence Is Felt, Though You Are Not Here. Behind The Beat Of My Heart ... You&apos;ll Always Be Near. R.I.P. Big Brother ... My Marine!

I Know You&apos;re In Heaven ... Watching Down Today,
And I Know ... That Is What You Would Want - So, I Wouldn&apos;t Have It Any Other Way ...
I&apos;ve Watched You Struggle, I&apos;ve Watched You Fight
And Even Surpass ... All The Obstacles That God Has Set In Your Path.
But, Through The Hard Times ... I Never Left Your Side.
I Was There When You Smiled, And Always When You Cried
I Was Even There - When You Needed To Confide.
And When People Said You Couldn&apos;t - Or Even That You Wouldn&apos;t ...
I Gave You My Faith And Believed In You.
I Gave You The Courage - To Carry Through.
In The End ... You Made Me Proud All On Your Own.
You Succeeded - And Reached The Top - All Alone.
And Though I Will Miss - All The Conversations On The Phone ...
I Will Reminisce Without Hesitation - About The Way You Have Grown,
And The Love You Have Shown.
See ... When In Heard The News
When I Saw The Marines Staring Back At Me, Through The Screen Door ...
It Felt It - A Pain, Like None Other I&apos;ve Experienced Ever Before.
I Couldn&apos;t Believe My Eyes. My Ears.
It Was Like I Was Drowning - In My Very Own Stream Of Tears,
And As The Hours Pass ... I Just Pray For You To Reappear,
But You Don&apos;t - And I Know You Won&apos;t.
So Now, After My Own 20 Years, I Realize I Need To Face
One Of My Biggest Fears ... Your Absence.
And At Times I May Cry - Or Question Why,
But I Will Never Be Ashamed, Afraid - Or Even Too Shy To Admit ---
That You Are My Life, My Joy - My Pride! And, I Will Love You Forever
Until My Own Life Turns Dry, But I Need Your Help Now.
And, Since This Is How We Are Destined To Be ...
I Know You Are Up There - Watching Over Me.
I Need Your Help, Your Strength - And Guidance ...
To Not Give Up. Let Me Feel Your Touch, And Help Me To Survive
Through The Presence ... Of Your Spirit, And Your Love.
And Please ... Hear My Last Words - As You Watch From Above.
I Would Give You The World, My Life. I Would Give You My Soul,
If I Thought For A Second - That It Would Bring You Home.
But Since It Won&apos;t ... I Gave You My Words
And If Give You This Poem. Travis, My Big Brother - My Marine
I Want You To Know ... That You Are - My Inspiration, My Motivation.
And, As Appreciation I Give To You ... The Rest Of My Life.
This Is ... My Dedication.

3/2 Marines arrive in Al Qaim

LtCol. T. S. Mundy, CO for 3/2 Marines, sends this report from Al Qaim, Iraq:

 I am writing this update to you on the last day of February, as Task Force 3/2 is currently settling into our new home in Al Qaim, and areas around Al Asad, and learning about the environment from the battalion we are replacing. I just watched the last Marines and Sailors arrive out here in Al Qaim, and two days ago the men of India Company moved into their base at Camp Gannon. The battalion task force has now gotten completely moved to the areas in Iraq where well work for our tour here.
I referred to Task Force 3/2 now, because the unit is much larger with the addition of some great Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers, that give us additional capabilities of armored firepower, engineering, truck and armored transportation, explosives detection and handling, and intelligence. This is a great team, and I additionally have responsibility for the numerous other units that are here in Al Qaim to support us, including helicopters, an advanced medical capabilities team, civilian contractors, combat service support Marines, and even military working dogs. We are well prepared and well supported to do our mission here in Iraq.

We are working closely with Task Force 1/7, and their Marines and Sailors are bending over backwards to conduct a thorough turnover with our men, so that we learn all the lessons they have gained in their time in Iraq. Their battalion task force has done an exceptional job here, and I am very pleased to be getting the instruction we need from true professionals from such a fine unit. They are teaching your men how to recognize and avoid improvised explosive devices and mines, and how to fight against the enemy we face here. That doesnt guarantee we wont suffer some casualties, but it certainly better prepares us for the dangers.

Lima Company, 3/2 has started doing their mission in several sites around Al Asad, and I am comfortable with the arrangements for their important work over our deployment here. They will be well taken care of by the battalion they are joining for their security mission at Al Asad, and I will also keep tabs on them and keep you updated on their progress. 


And with 3/2 on the ground, the First Team is ready to come home! It&apos;s been a long seven months and I can&apos;t wait to see our Marines come off that bus next month. Oohrah!!

1stLt Z Philpott from 2nd LAR Apache Company sent this anecdote:
 The other night on guard post one of our Marines calls the Marine in charge of the guards. Corporal, Ive got something bright in the air that is glowing out here. 
 What is it? asks the Corporal.

 I dont know. It is glowing white to the Northeast. The vigilant Marines reports.

 Ill be right up. 

After careful inspection and deliberation, the Corporal has to inform the young Marine. Thatsthe moon, bud.

2/10 Marines return home
 Photo and text by Pfc. Christopher J. Ohmen USN Corpsman Raymond W. Culver, serving with 2/10 Lima Company greets his wife Briana after returning from a seven-month deployment.
 2/10 Marines are home after a seven-month deployment to Iraq.
 The Marines did a great job, said 1st Lt. Steven C. Allshouse, Headquarters Battery commander.

While deployed, they completed numerous security operations to include providing security for firm bases around Iraq, patrols inside and outside of the firm bases, and convoy security for third country nationals.

According to Allshouse, some of the units were under constant small arms fire while doing their job. One incident with insurgents turned into a four-hour firefight, but the Marines handled the situation effectively.

Some Marines from the battalion were put in charge of security for one of the voting polls during the democratic election. Others were used as security for workers at one of the polling sites.

In addition to providing security, the battalion spent time helping the surrounding communities. The Marines participated in several construction projects restoring running water, plumbing and electricity to several villages near Camp Taqaddum. The Marines also distributed clothing and school supplies improving relations with the local populous.

 The local contractors and villagers were hired to improve the housing in the villages, said Gunnery Sgt. Patrick T. Patton, information and operation chief with the battalion.

The battalions mission required extra personnel from Combat Service Support Battalion 1, 1st Force Service Support Group and several Army units. Many of these Marines joined the unit right before the battalion deployed. Within a few weeks of the deployment, the new Marines got to know the rest of the battalion and many new friendships were born, according to Allshouse.

The Marines of the battalion now receive a well-deserved block of leave to spend with their families and loved ones. After helping and protecting communities in a foreign country for seven months, these Marines now get to relax with the ones they protected at home.

Midweek update from the Mayhem Marines

Here&apos;s another update from LtCol Mark Smith - if I weren&apos;t already a fan, his comments about the Oregon National Guard would have tipped that balance.

 A mid-week &quot;update&quot; of sorts. As we continue to press the attack against our evil and cowardly enemy, and since chopping from the 2 BCT to the 5 BCT, we continue to receive enormous support and forces in the Mayhem AO. Some of those forces are from a National Guard Battalion, a company of which is from Oregon and depicted in the below article, who was chopped to the Mayhem Battalion a couple of weeks ago. Now, these Warriors have been OUTSTANDING. I say that for two reasons:
 I have seen much press bashing the National Guard. I can tell you this. Since chopping to the US Army Command, we have had significant contact with National Guard Units, particularly support units. They have gone out of their way to support the Mad Ghosts. They have always crashed through the walls of bureaucracy and provided maintenance and logistics support with a sense of urgency, based out of respect for the fight the Mad Ghosts are in. As Warriors, A and C 2-162, of which A or &quot;Angel&quot; Company is depicted below, have been dedicated, professional, and tactically proficient Warriors. THEY HAVE BEEN AN ABSOLUTE WELCOME ADDITION TO THE MAYHEM BATTALION, AND FOR ME, I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THEIR SERVICE TO THEIR NATION, THEIR PATRIOTISM, AND THEIR DEDICATION TO THE NEVER ENDING CAUSE OF FREEDOM.
 Second reason, they have fought side by side with YOUR Mad Ghosts. And, anyone that does that, well, HE is my brother...for life! May God Bless and Keep the Magnificent Families of 2/24, now inclusive of the families of A &quot;Angel&quot; and C &quot;Cajun&quot; Companies of the 2-162. Oregon just became part of the &quot;Mayhem from the Heartland&quot;...all the way from the Left Coast!

Oregon National Guard working with 2/24 Marines
 Photo by Major Arnold V. Strong Capt. Eric Riley calls for covering fire.

Major Arnold V. Strong, Public Affairs Officer for the Oregon National Guard, has been a lot of help to the Oregon Marine Corps Moms with past projects. Here&apos;s a story he recently released about the Oregon National Guard in Iraq, currently attached to the Mad Ghosts:

 Six Roadside bombs. Three days. No casualties. An enemy on the run is a good enemy. A sure sign that the insurgency is on the run and the coalition is continuing its progress. Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 162nd Infantry, of the Oregon National Guard is currently attached to the 2nd Battalion, 24th Marines, a Marine Corps Reserve unit that can relate to the citizen-soldiers of Oregon in more ways than as foot soldiers.
Since the day these soldiers have arrived in the sector, they have been in contact with a hidden enemy. In the past three days, six of the company&apos;s vehicles have been struck by Improvised Explosive Devices. In a testament to the strength of the equipment they are fielded with and the training they have borne by experience, none of the soldiers have been injured in the attacks. All but one of the vehicles, after a brief term in the maintenance shop, has been returned to the line.

Led by Capt. Eric Riley, 35, of Roseburg, Ore., and Sgt. Maj. Randall Mefford, 42, of Medford, Ore., Alpha Company is a unique element of the Volunteer battalion. True volunteers, the great majority of this unit are not native to the battalion but volunteered as augmentees from the 1st Battalion, 186th Infantry out of Southern Oregon and 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry out of the Portland area. Many of these soldiers have already served on Active Duty since September 11th, 2001, either as peacekeepers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the Multinational Force and Observers mission of 2002 or as ground infantry in Operations Iraqi Freedom I in 2003. When the chance to again serve in combat alongside their fellow Oregon Guardsmen came, hundreds of Oregon citizen soldiers volunteered to join the fight. This company is a shining example of that Volunteer spirit.

For most of the soldiers in this unit, the change in pace from Baghdad is refreshing and an opportunity to close this deployment on the high point of targeting the enemy and destroying the resistance of the insurgency in the last few weeks they serve as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom II.

&quot;At least it doesn&apos;t smell like burning garbage and raw sewage out here,&quot; said Lieutenant Michael &quot;Corey&quot; Jones, 27, of Grant&apos;s Pass, Ore., of the change from urban sprawl to rural farmland on the first day the unit served here in the Babel province, south of Baghdad. By the end of the third night here, his assessment was far more direct. &quot;Forget the IEDs. It is just a sign of how desperate these guys are. I want to go house to house, tell these people that we are here to find the bad guys and I want to get these guys that are killing our trucks and trying to kill us,&quot; he said to a dark room full of battle hardened noncommissioned officers. &quot;This is where it&apos;s at,&quot; he told his squad leaders. &quot;This is the best place to be for all of us right now. It is the last chance we have to get the bad guys, tell these people that we mean business and that we are not going to tolerate their nonsense,&quot; he concluded.

The company has been doing just that. In taking the fight to the enemy, they are moving, platoon by platoon, building by building, room by room, mounted in HMMWVs or dismounted on foot through thick marsh-filled farm lands, across this rural landscape; establishing their presence and informing the local farmers and village merchants of their purpose: to stop the insurgency that is exploiting the people of Iraq, to confiscate the means to destroy coalition forces and to capture or destroy the terrorists. It is a purpose that these soldiers take very seriously. Eight of their brothers in arms have made their final journey home since this battalion arrived in Iraq last year and with six roadside bombs detonated in the past three days, many of these war weary troops want to destroy the enemy with extreme prejudice, move themselves and their equipment North for the final withdrawal from Iraq and get home to their families, friends and communities in the next month.

&quot;It is clear that we have the enemy on the run,&quot; said Capt. Riley. &quot;I just returned from the (Marine) battalion command and they want all of us to know that, as dangerous as it has been in the past days, this is a sign of the desperation of these insurgents that their only method of attack is with these IEDs,&quot; he said in describing a meeting with the staff and commander of the 2-24 Marines. &quot;Beside all of that, you need to remind your men of the great work they are doing. This is the best way we could possibly close out this deployment, and your men are doing a fantastic job,&quot; he concluded.

The little things seem to make this trip more tolerable, if not enjoyable. Last night, the platoon sergeant of 1st Platoon, Sgt. 1st First Class Shannon Compton, 38, of Roseburg, Ore., brought a special gift from the 2-24th Marine Battalion Commander. On a resupply mission to the battalion&apos;s headquarters, Sgt. Compton picked up crates of potatoes, green peppers and onions, boxes of frozen hot dogs, buns and cases of condiments for an old fashioned hot dog roast. In the courtyard of the bombed out former police station that has become home to these citizen-soldiers and Marine reservists, Sgt. Compton and his noncommissioned officers made a feast to write home about. &quot;This is awesome,&quot; said Specialist Baldwin, 25, of Salem, Ore., &quot;This is the first hot meal we&apos;ve had in about a week. And it was good,&quot; he paused. &quot;Awesome.&quot;

1/7 Update - &quot;We accomplished our mission&quot;

Here is the latest update from Lt.Col. Woodbridge - homecoming is so close!

 First off, let me apologize for not sending an update to this message for a while. As our deployment to Iraq comes to an end we have been any less busy, and most of the month of January was a blur of activity preparing for and conducting the Iraqi elections.
I&apos;m sure you have all seen what a success the elections here have been, and you should all be very proud of the work our nation and your marines and sailors did to make this a reality. These were the first free, democratic elections in Iraq in over 30 years, and this historic event marks the beginning of Iraq&apos;s future as a free country. The entire battalion taskforce performed flawlessly in supporting this event. We accomplished our mission and provided a secure environment for the citizens of Al Qa&apos;im to exercise their right to choose to participate in the future of their country.

Now, the question I know is on everyone&apos;s mind: when will we be home? Let me tell you, it feels great to be able to say: &quot;the battalion will be home next month.&quot; We will, but until I have the exact days and times, I&apos;m not going to get anyone&apos;s hopes up. As soon as we know who is flying home on specific flights, we will let you know.

As close as our return is, everyone must keep in mind that the deployment is not over until we walk off the buses at 29 Palms. Between now and then we will continue to operate in this extremely hazardous place. Over the next few weeks we will very busy as we both engage the enemy and prepare to turn the area over to the battalion relieving us. Your support and prayers are even more vital now as we make a hard sprint into the finish line. Your Marines and sailors have the courage and endurance to push through to the end, so please be as strong as they are, and before you know it, we will be with you.

God bless you and Semper Fidelis,
LtCol Woodbridge

&quot;Little by little, success comes&quot;

Col. Tucker, Commanding Officer for RCT-7, has been busy for the last few months - this update tells why:

 It has been 4 months since I have written. Much has passed in those months: a time of great victories, an election, the emergence of a competent, professional Iraqi Army and Police units who stand to their tasks, and a tipping point in this battle against terror and evil.
I believe that my last letter was dated 18 October 2004. On 21 Octoberunder cover of one of those dirt-fog nights unique to Iraq; with drivers barely able to see the edges of their hoods---the RCT Command Element moved from Al Asad to Camp Baharia, a protected FOB about 5 kilometers east of Fallujah.

TF 1/8 joined us two days later; BLT 1/3 a few days after that. We added 2d Recon Bn to the mix, assumed an area of operations south of Fallujah, and between 25 October and 6 November conducted a series of operations in the vicinity of Fallujah designed to force the enemy to show his hand.

Meanwhile, back in Al Asad, the Command Element of 31 st MEU assumed command of operations in our old AO. TF 1/7 remained in place vic Al Qaim. TF 1/23 remained in place vic Hit-Haditha. And 3d LAR, for a time, remained in place in Korean Village near Ar Rutbah. As plans developed, the 3d LAR HQs, one LAR Company, and B Co 1/23 would eventually move east and join RCT-1.

On 5 November, TF 2-2, a U.S. Army Mechanized Bn joined RCT-7. At 1900 on 8 November, the RCT crossed the line of departure north of Fallujah, By 2200 all three battalions were through the breach and fighting in the city. There followed 30 days of intense infantry combat fought in houses, tunnels, spider holes, and underground complexes against an enemy who routinely feigned surrender, feigned injury, used women and children as shields, booby trapped his dead and fought to the death from fortified and mutually supporting positions. The actions and courage of your Marines and Sailors were aptly captured in the media and I have neither the time nor adequate words to describe their actions here. History will record their deeds with an honor due their forefathers.

We pulled out of Fallujah on 8 December, and assumed an area of operations around the city. BLT 1/3 remained in the city with RCT-1. TF 1/8 and 2d Recon Bn joined the RCT in the outlying area of operations. In January 2005 TF 3/8 replaced TF 1/8. And on Feb 5 th 2005 the RCT returned to Al Asad, leaving Fallujah and environs as the safest place in the Sunni Triangle. We relieved 31 st MEU on 8 Feb, and once again assumed control of our old area of operations. As I write both 3d LAR and B Co 1/23 have returned to us and the RCT team is whole again.

Al Asad is crowded. We are beginning the RIP with RCT-2 and 2d MarDiv; their advance parties and lead elements are flowing into theater and into our AO. 29 Palms units will start flowing home soon, with CSSB-7 leading the way towards the end of this month, and then your husbands, fathers, uncles, and sons begin flowing in a steady stream of homecomings that will happily consume the month of March. Still work to be done here. But we are anxious to come home. 


 

 Okjust one picture today. And there is a story to go with it.
Election day. RCT-7 is assisting the Iraqi Security Forces and IECI at two polling sites located within 10 kilometers of the city of Fallujah. Much work and preparation has gone into this day---a strong effort to ensure that those Iraqis who chose to vote can vote in safety. Polls open at 0700. At 0915 I am at the easternmost polling site in my AO. And not a single voter has come to the polls. At 0930, a man, two women, and two children walk up to the security gate, into the polling station, and then depart. As they are leaving the man walks up to the Iraqi Army Colonel standing with me and tells us that there is a group of people gathered in the nearest city who want to come vote, but want to be reassured it is safe. He informs us he is going to go tell them it is safe. 20 minutes later, 1500 Iraqi men and women come over the hill and take their place in line. For the next 7 hours, the scene in this photograph remained unchanged as 5000 people from the surrounding community walked over the hill and into history. Over 7000 voted in the city of Fallujah itself. 12,000 in an area that 3 months before was the hells acre of terrorists and vicious criminals. It is now the safest area in the Sunni Triangle. And it will remain so.

Twice in the course of this day the enemy fired mortars at the polling station. In both cases the mortars flew harmlessly overhead and impacted as duds in the field beyond. The women prayed, the men held their children close. But they all calmly held their places in line, and they cheered when we located and killed both mortarmen.

Women cried as they walked out after voting. Both women and men walked up to and hugged the Marines as they walked out of our perimeter. TF 3/8 was holding that perimeter, and had been in Iraq for less then 2 weeks.

But the Marines from my Detachment have been here for a year. Cocky, confident young men. Men of 19 and 20 and 21 who have fought their way through 4 major battles, traveled over 30,000 miles on some of the most dangerous roads in Iraq, 10 of whom have been wounded and returned; young men who have handed candy to children, painted schools, pulled children out of the line of fire, played soccer with their Iraqi peers, and helped farmers pull tractors out of the mud. And they watched. And waved. And returned the hugs. They stood there with an air of accomplishment and satisfaction that cannot be described in words. About 1300, as the line showed no sign of diminishing, one of the Corporals walked over to me and said Sir, we knew they would come. And we did. Those of us here knew they would come. You dont often get a chance to see a nation show its courage. On 30 Jan 2005, the people of Iraq reminded us of the virtue of self-determination. We continue to win. Little by little, success comes until it tips inexorably towards victory. And it has tipped. There is much to do still. But it will be said---of those who have fought this last year for the future of Iraq and the destruction of the terror that threatens our nation---it can and will be said that they ventured into hell, and did not return with empty hands.

Share your courage. We will be home soon.

THIS WAS A VERY GOOD WEEK!!!

More from the awesome warriors of 2/24:

 Greetings. I hope beyond hope that this letter finds you in high spirits, good health, and planning feverishly for that day when you will be reunited with your beloved Marine or Sailor, your Mad Ghost. It truly is rapidly approaching! Advance elements of the unit that will be replacing us are on deck and learning the Mayhem AO. And, I just completed a two hour orientation brief from my staff on redeployment planning. All of this is relayed to you so that you may know it is a horizon event, and you are rapidly approaching the spot where the sun meets the sea!
Now, that said, the fight continues, and it continues in earnest. This was a good week. THIS WAS A VERY GOOD WEEK!!! We completed the third of three Bn Operations that were dubbed Red Mayhem I, II and III. These Operations combined the assets and forces of the Red Team, our HHQ, the 5th Brigade Combat Team, and your Magnificent Mayhem Mad Ghosts in company succession, I for Fox, II for Golf and III for Echo. As always, our magnificent Mobile Strike Teams provided lethality and maneuver, the Personal Security Detachment provided for mobile Command and Control and movement of Mayhem 6, the Motor T and Truck Platoons provided mobility and critical support, the Comm Section provided the communications assets for Command and Control, the HET Marines provided the interrogation set and skill, remaining elements of H&amp;S;provided stalwart FOB defense, our Navy brethren provided medical care and religious services and our Staff Section Marines surged from their standard 18-20 hour day duties to augment the combat forces and power of the Mayhem, and our magnificent military working dogs, Tino and Dingo, were forward in the fight, where they most like to be. Yes, THIS WAS A VERY GOOD WEEK!!! 



 In each and every one of these operations, the insurgency learned, yet again, we go where we want, we go where they think we can&apos;t or WON&apos;T, and we find them; we find their caches and we bring help, assistance and hope to those whom they have terrorized. During Red Mayhem III, some of the caches we found had been buried with all of the skill of a puppy first learning how to bury a bone. The Marines and Soldiers from the 1-7 CAV, as well as our Iraqi Army counterparts found them with relative ease and very early on in the operation. And, by the way, on this operation we assigned our Iraqi Army counterparts, for the first time, their own search sector. Marines from the Civil Action Platoon from Co E acted from overwatch only. And, if I might, the Iraqi Army performed magnificently! They found several caches of insurgent/terrorist weaponry, and they moved and acted like professional soldiers from start to finish. Yes, they are inching ever closer to the day that THEY WILL operate without US Forces, and will crush those who oppose law and order.
There is no doubt the tables have turned against the insurgents in our zone! The atmospherics we get from the people are SIGNIFICANTLY different than when we first arrived. They talk of fighting back against the insurgents. They talk openly of their respect for us and their gratitude at our assistance. They are far less afraid to be seen talking and cooperating with us. They are growing. GROWING IN FREEDOM in what will be a long process, but one whose outcome is inevitable. There is a wind of change in this part of the world. And it blows strong and hot. And it blows with a discontent for evil, for repression, for tyranny, for brutality. It blows with it a desire for peace, for righteousness, for dignity, for tolerance and for FREEDOM. I tell you, you can taste it in the air.

Now, our enemy will not cease. He continues his daily war of IEDs and cowardly tactics. The Mad Ghosts continue to hunt him relentlessly. For example, this week, the Marines of Mobile Strike Team 2 were executing one of the unique techniques that have been adopted by the ever evolving Mad Ghosts, but will remain ambiguous for security reasons, when they seized a boat on a canal. In the boat were IED making materials and the two Iraqis in the boat tested positive for explosives, and were immediately detained. One of the sharp Marines noticed wire, which they traced to a daisy-chained IED consisting of 11 explosive rounds! The IED was safely disposed of by the professional US Navy EOD team currently assigned to the Mayhem Battalion. This was but just one of the many HUGE successes accomplished this week by your Mad Ghosts.

Let me tell you another one. The Marines of Co E, who have to have set a record for miles logged in foot patrols, and whose phsyical condition is currently second to no one, were on one of their daily and continuous patrols through Mahmudiyah. While on this patrol, they were approached by a local who told them of a shooting a couple of blocks away. The local explained that armed men pulled up in a couple of cars, sprayed another car with machine gun fire, kidnapped the male driver, left the female driver for dead, and then placed a bomb in the trunk. Now, immediately, the Marines of Co E knew this was a standard tactic of our enemy who knows no limit to his cowardice. They approached the scene cautiously and established a safe cordon around the vehicle. From the cordon, the squad&apos;s US Navy Corpsman, through long range observation, saw what he believed to be bubbles forming in the blood underneath the nose of the supposed dead female. &quot;Doc&quot; made the decision that she was still alive. With that information, the Doc and the Squad Leader moved forward, extricated the female, and were approximately 30 meters away when the car detonated in a huge fireball of death and destruction. This entire episode was captured by one of the Marines on video and is as dramatic as any Hollywood scene you have ever viewed. Now, we can debate the smartness of their actions all we want, but what I ultimately know is this: this Marine and Sailor COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DISREGARDED THEIR OWN SAFETY TO SAVE THE LIFE OF AN INNOCENT IRAQI WHO HAD BEEN GUNNED DOWN IN COLD BLOOD, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON A BUSY STREET! Now unfortunately, the women later died at the Mahmudiyah Hospital. But know this, the Iraqi crowd that had gathered to witness this whole event, well, they cheered. No, check that, they celebrated in the Arab way of near hysteria for the heroic actions of the Doc and the Marine. They saw once again what AMERICANS are all about. And, I have no doubt, once again, they have learned. They have learned for future actions. They have learned evil and terror can be fought. They have learned that there is a heavy price, BUT GOOD ALWAYS TRIUMPHS OVER EVIL!!!!! (Now this video should be released soon, and if it does not make the major media outlets, well, then something is wrong! But if it does not, we will show it to you all upon our return.) It is heroism in action, and just another day at the office for the Mad Ghosts of 2/24.

One more story and then I shall take my leave of you for another week so that you may turn to your important tasks and duties. This story revolves around a pin: it is called the Fleet Marine Force Pin. It is a decoration that may be worn by US Navy Corpsman who have earned it. It says that they are Fleet Corpsman. It says that they have completed the required screening, training and evaluation to wear this pin. It is a US Navy design with a United States Marine Corps Eagle Globe and Anchor emblazened in the center of it. And...it is coveted. For all that is difficult to attain is cherished most. One of the things that has to be accomplished to achieve the pin, just one of many, is for the Sailor to pass the USMC physical fitness test. Today, one did. But, you ask, what is so special about that? Well, part of the USMC Physical Fitness Test is a 3 mile run. And, in the Mayhem AO, we embrace the warrior spirit, we do not challenge it. So, EVERY TIME you leave a hardened structure, whether it is to go to the porta-pottie or to run 3 miles inside the wire around the FOB, you do it with your helmet on, your flak jacket and SAPI plates on (approximately 30 lbs) and with your weapon and ammunition. So, this is how the good Doc ran his 3 miles. In full up gear, or as we like to say &quot;full battle rattle!&quot; And, he accomplished it in 27 minutes. Phenomenal time with that much gear on.

Only accomplished through sheer determination and will to succeed. But, for you hard to impress types, let me add a couple more facts. The Doc that did this....oh yeah, he is 55 years old! You heard me, 55 years old. He is a brain surgeon in Chicago! He joined the Navy at 52 to give back to his country following the impacts felt around the world on September 11, 2001. He has a fantastic wife and two lovely children. He to this day refuses to tell me how much money he is losing by being here, but my simple Hoosier mind knows it is at least 6 figures, if not 7. He is as hard as woodpecker lips and as gentle as a fall breeze. He is the man we should ALL aspire to be. He has taken sacrifice and dedication and compassion and EXAMPLE to a new level. And you know what; in the middle of the blood and the mud and the hate and the terror and the fear and the violence, I have never once seen him that he did not have a smile on his face! His enthusiasm is contagious. He is an amazing human being. And although my junior in rank, he is a shining example of manhood and the Warrior Code, and we are all just lucky as lucky gets to have him among us!!!

YES, IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD WEEK!!!

Semper superbus...nunca plenus

Major Holton from 2/24 Golf Company sends along this update from the sandbox:

 This past week saw the return of 3rd Platoon to the company, after a period of about a month where they belonged to the army. They have continued to thrive in conducting the separate and critical mission of securing the Main Supply Route that runs through our area of operations. Without a doubt, they have experienced the roughest continuous living conditions of anyone in the battalion. To give you an idea of how others view them/us, when the army unit they worked with drove up for the first time to their positions, they asked, Where do you stay at? When the Marines replied, We stay out here, the soldiers shook their heads and said Were not staying out there. But our guys do it, and they do it because a conscious decision has been made that this approach is the best way to accomplish the mission. Luckily, the company is blessed with a group of men who understand that mission accomplishment is not just important when the task is easy. 

 The past 10 days has been one of the most professionally rewarding periods of my life. The elections were a great accomplishment that every one of our Marines and sailors can be proud of for the rest of their lives. What occurred on that day, from the great turnout of voters, to the low effectiveness of violence by the insurgents, was a testament to all of the hard work that has been put into this area for the months leading up to them. We had the opportunity to help bring about a process that we take for granted in our country, but which I think meant a lot to the people of this country. Though in the big scheme of things, the elections were only one step, they were a huge step. If this country is ever going to be truly free, this step had to happen. And the fact that it did, almost flawlessly after all of the warnings and doom and gloom predictions, made it that much more impressive. After the elections, your Marines rolled right back into normal operations and has continued to push. Just yesterday, we conducted an operation that netted our companys best one-day output of detained insurgents since we arrived here. We continue to execute in everything we are given. I feel confident that there is no tactical mission that can be given to us that we wouldnt knock out of the park. Why do I feel that way? Because history and experience are the best gauges for predicting the future, and my history and experience with Golf Company is that we have succeeded in every tactical mission we have ever been given (now if we could stop losing gear, I may be able to remain as company commander until we get back to Wisconsin!). It really is neat to see the type of things that our guys do automatically now, and then to see the sum of all of the parts in operation. When we are in the middle of tactical operations, everyone knows what they are supposed to do, accepts their role, and then does it to the very best of their ability. It sounds so simple, but just those three actions, consistently applied, has been our secret of success. And it doesnt just happen by chance. You should know that the Marines leading this company -- the platoon commanders, platoon sergeants, squad leaders, and all of the noncommissioned officers continue to lead in the best way possibleby example. If there is one thing that I am proudest of within the company is that we dont have Marines that lead by fear, directive, or rank alone.
We have people who get it that important component of leading is by doing and letting those around observe what the expectation is.

I feel as though I have to thank you once again for the great job your loved ones are doing over here. One of the other things that I am proud of in this company is how close the Marines and sailors are to one another. Yes, we all have ranks and our guys know well how to operate within the rank structure. But more important than having great Lance Corporals, Corporals, Sergeants, Captains, and Majors is just having great Marines and great men. And that is what we have in Golf Company. These guys offer no pretense to be that which they are not. They just go out every day and get the mission done. The mission is repetitious and challenging in the enormous consistency it requires to attain success. Every day when a squad walks or drives out of the base for an operation, the challenges it might face on that day range from looking for and/or discovering an improvised explosive device, dealing with angry people who have complaints about water, gas, or lack of a job, or getting sniped at randomly from some location. Sometimes, the challenges they face are finding a small boy who has been beaten up and left in an abandoned house, dealing with a man who has been detained for insurgent activity who then has a heart attack, or having the mother of a detained man faint and slump to the ground as her son was led away. In all cases, your Marines and sailors have had to transition from one mindset to another very different one in a matter of seconds, and then to make decisions and act when literally lives are in the balance. They have proven themselves quite adept at the type of flexibility this demands.

We continue to pray for our wounded Marines. Staff Sergeant Simon, Sergeant Ganem, Sergeant Cornell, Lance Corporal Skaar, and Lance Corporal Kruchten are on our mind all of the time and we are grateful to get the updates on their progress. We look forward to the reunion with them and are proud to have had the wonderful opportunity to serve with them. We also keep in our mind the sacrifices that were made by Corporal Warns, Lance Corporal Ramey, Lance Corporal ODonnell, and Lance Corporal Cantafio made for all of us. I am in awe of such men and consider myself extremely lucky to have the opportunity to serve in the company of heroes.

The next few weeks will test us in ways that we wouldnt have envisioned five months ago. Not only will we be fighting an active (but dwindling) insurgency, we will also be fighting complacency and our desire to be home NOW. The tasks and missions that were brand new three months ago are commonplace to us now. We have the benefit of being able to apply experience to almost any task now; however, we also have the danger of what is routine causing us not to address each task with the amount of detail that is due in combat operations. Our time will come and we know it will seem like a blink of the eye before we are reunited with all of you at Madison Airport. Until then, help us to keep the kind of singular focus that has helped the company to be as successful as it has. If you havent been stern with your Marine/Sailor to date, now is the time to do it. If you havent lectured your son/brother/husband/friend, now is the time to do it. Focus is all we really need to ensure that we can finish in the way that we a started, and is the strongest variable in the equation that equals all of our Marines and Sailors stepping off the plane and into your arms. Have a great week, thanks again for what you do to support us individually and as a company, and I will send out another update next week.

Best regards,

Adam Y. Holton
Major, United States Marine Corps Reserve

MSSG-31 reports from Iraq

LtCol James A. Vohr sends this note to the families of MSSG 31 - another group looking forward to returning home.

 Wanted to bring you up to date on what we have been doing lately here at the MSSG. I dont know if you might have seen the article on the Marine Corps Official Website highlighting the end of operations in Iraq for the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (31st MEU). MSSG 31 is a member of this organization, so this message applies to us and we have completed operations as well. Our focus now has shifted to the multitude of tasks it takes to get a unit ready for redeployment.
Ive said it before and I will repeat it now. You would not believe how these Marines and Sailors have matured. We held a crew-served weapons shoot the other day to check weapons functioning and to re-familiarize all Marines with the skills required to operate the .50 caliber machine gun and the M240G. The non-commissioned officers manned each weapon and we cycled the junior Marines through to fire. To the man (and woman), they knew what they were doing and handled the weapons with proficiency. These are all Marines whose primary military occupational specialty is something other than infantry, and yet they know how to handle weapons. Even our Corpsmen were involved and they are as competent as the Marines.

Speaking of the Corpsmen, I am extremely proud of the entire Health Services Platoon. Throughout the deployment, their motto has appeared to be, how can I help. They have been involved in everything from convoy support to providing medical care to insurgent detainees. Our medical officer led a trauma team at BRAVO Surgical Company during the fight for Fallujah, and I am sure made a life or death difference for many wounded Marines. Since the 31st MEU and the MSSG were at different locations, our dental officer served as the 31st MEU surgeon, and employed her Arab language skills to support the civil affairs efforts in the 31st MEUs operating area. To top it all off all of the Corpsmen have all qualified for their FMF pins, a difficult challenge requiring them to master many skills normally associated with Marines and pass a proficiency exam. It is unheard of to have a 100% qualification rate.

Ill keep you posted on our progress. There is still a lot of work to be done, but I am confident the Marines and Sailors of MSSG 31 will do it well. We are all looking forward to seeing the green Island of Okinawa, Japan!

Until next time and as always, Im proud and you should be proud of the Marines and Sailors of MSSG 31. It is an honor to serve with them

Thanks for all your support

Sincerely,

J. Alex Vohr

Seeing Stars and Earning Stripes

On Saturday, a few NR folks visited Walter Reed. Here&apos;s Jim Robbin&apos;s most memorable observation :

 One of the wounded Marines was in ICU, and was still feeling the effects of the anesthesia, having just come from surgery. A Lieutenant General stopped by to see how he was.
 &quot;How are you doing, Lance Corporal?&quot; he said.

 &quot;Lance Corporal my a**,&quot; the semi-conscious Marine said, &quot;I have enough time in to be a Corporal by now.&quot; The 3-star nodded, went off and made a phone call. Within the hour the young Marine had his corporal&apos;s stripes.

A Valentine for Military Spouses

A Valentines Message from the 3/8 Commanding Officer to the families at home:

 Id like to take this opportunity this Valentines Day to say thank you for all that you do.
Being a military spouse is not easy,
Especially on the most challenging deployment
But the mission we have to accomplish is important
And critical to the success and future of Iraq.

The sacrifices you make on behalf of your Marine or Sailor are great and put a strain on the strongest of relationships.

So on this Valentines Day, I would like to say thank you for keeping the fire in the home lit, bread on the table and for the loving support you give each day.

Thank you again for your patience, understanding and devotion.

Best Wishes and Happy Valentines Day! 
S.M. Neary 


For Cassandra and Carrie, Mrs. Blackfive and Mrs. Greyhawk , for Diana and Amy, Mary Helen, Sarah , and all the other Marine (and other military) wives out there - Happy Valentines Day!

&quot; . . . oh my God have these guys delivered&quot;

Captain Griffin from 2nd LAR summed up the recent Iraqi elections with one word - historic. His entire post, including some well-earned praise for the hardworking Marines under his command, is in the extended entry and will give you new respect for the Marines who fight and never quit.

Here&apos;s his closing that you can pass along to anyone who asks, &quot;why are we still in Iraq&quot;.

 And finally let me share with you two of most meaningful events of the day (election day). Two &quot;feel good&quot; stories about why we are here away from our families for seven months at a time, serving in a dangerous land:
1. An older gentlemen, apparently well educated, made it a point to get the attention of every Marine, Solider and Sailor along the VCP, motion him to come over, shake his hand and say &quot;Thank you. This is the first time in my life my vote actually means something. I hope you never leave.&quot; 

2. My translator approached me about mid-morning and I could tell he was ancy about something. He asked &quot;Sir, can I go vote now.&quot; I told him &quot;Hell yes, Jimmy. Go vote.&quot; He replied &quot;Thank you, sir. It is my right now. Thank you.&quot; 

While the second was obviously more personal to me because I have come to respect Jimmy for all he has done for this company and in turn his country, I believe today was historic. And we were glad to just do our part. It has made so much of this deployment worthwhile and hopefully we honored all the Marines, Soldiers and Sailors who have paid all in this mission by accomplishing what we have done today. To think that just two months ago we were attacking the city with lethal, overwhelming firepower and now a democratic election rose from the ashes of the city defies reality. This is the power of America. This is the power of the human race who can be brutally suppressed by a regime for 30 years and terrorized in their homes by selfish cowards. The resiliency and the survivalist mentality of the Iraqi people makes it easy to believe that we are in the right fight. 


There&apos;s more. Read it all.

 31 January 2005
I am not sure how the elections will be portrayed on the news today but I know you were watching. I can only hope it is reported accurately.

I know I can sum it up in one word - historic.

Over the past two months we had established a rotation plan to send Marines back to Camp Baharia once every eight days to shower, rest, call home and use the internet. It was my call on 20 January to stop that rotation so we can maintain as many Marines in the field and in the fight in preparation for the elections. Please do not blame your Marines for not calling or writing, it is not their fault, it is mine. We will reinitiate the rotation again on 2 February so I expect everyone should hear from their Marines again by the middle of the month. But during that time, know that once again, your Marines were heroes.

Since the fall of the insurgency base in Fallujah, Apache prepared for two events:

1) the reoccupation of the citizens of Fallujah and

2) the watershed event - the national elections; the latter being the larger of the two.

All of our actions were directed at achieving success in both endeavors but Election Day was the largest cloud laying on the horizon - 30 January.

What would that day bring? What would it ultimately mean and what was in store for my Marines?

We surged in our operations, both offensive and defensive, in the past ten days making our positions stronger, developing better force protection plans, conducting aggressive patrols to keep the enemy off balance, extending our security zone and doing a lot of what the Marines enjoyed the most - kicking in doors in the middle of the night, capturing bad guys and delivering them to justice. While AMZ and UBL are still loose, we have been rolling up bad guys at the cyclical rate. We have taken down so many insurgent fighters, IED makers and emplacers, financiers, harborers of terrorists, rocket and mortar men, leadership at all levels relative to our area, that the enemy ceased to fight in our zone on election day. We have earned tremendous accolades from the regiment for disrupting and taking down insurgent cells and groups. While these missions are the more desirable, &quot;sexy&quot; missions that my platoons are just so masterful at accomplishing, this is a team fight. The company motto is &quot;Everyone fights. No one quits.&quot; It has clearly come to signify who we are. All the Marines in the company participate in the offensive operations but that is not our only mission. Before I get back to the elections, let me tell you about what else we have been doing and able to accomplish.

Our weapons platoon has been primarily responsible for running our vehicle control point. With out getting to in depth, this is a mission where they have to control upwards of 3700 personnel a day and over 500 vehicles. Control being the operative word here. Every morning around 0530, they have to get out in the dark and sort through this traffic jam of personnel and vehicles, ensuring that all the vehicles are sorted, prioritized, screened, searched, directed and controlled. In US terms, probably not that big a deal. But remember we are in a country where we do not speak the same language, our enemy does not wear a uniform but dresses like a civilian, he has no appreciation for innocent life, he uses the civilian crowds as a means to get close to us. Where every citizen wants to get back in the city to recover the remains of the their homes and get their lives started again, desperate people who have suffered greatly who merely want to get to a distribution center, or make a solatia claim, or get to a propane or kerosene distribution area because they need the fuel to cook for their family, boil water or just try to stay warm through the night. We don&apos;t have stop lights and we don&apos;t have a lot of technology here nor a local media that can publish directions for our VCP. No - the Marines of weapons platoon had to make this happen on the ground alone. Utterly amazing.

While there are other control points around the city, ours initially received the least attention from higher because we were out in the hinterland. So after the Marines from weapons got through the day, at night they would refine their positions by filling sandbags, running new wire or repair the wire that was destroyed during the day, refine their own procedures, plus continue to support the other platoons, and maintain security on their platoon position and run patrols. It has been the stuff legends are made of. The VCP is now almost 700m long and while we did receive some engineering support from other brethren at 2d Combat Engineer Battalion, the lion&apos;s share rested on the shoulders, backs and brains of the Marines of weapons platoon. While every Marine in that platoon would rather be dropping mortar rounds in a fire for effect mission or calling out &quot;TOW on the wire&quot; as their anti-tank guided missile system fires a missile down range, or my engineers laying demo, adding &quot;P&quot; for plenty into the demolition equation, these guys bring a &quot;can do&quot; attitude to the battlefield, that they can handle any task, accomplish any mission and still look you in the eye as if you haven&apos;t even tested them. It is inspiring. Our maintenance section continues to be the bedrock for which the company stands firm. Separated from their maintenance tent and storage containers back at Camp Baharia, dealing with a supply line that sometimes extends back to the states, this company has maintained 100% readiness over the past four months. It has been a Herculean effort. I remember when I first came to LAR I was cautioned by former LAR friends about mechanics. They said &quot;Griff - don&apos;t &quot;wig&quot; out when they [mechanics] don&apos;t wear and do grunt-like things in the field. They are not grunts. Give them a little wiggle room because they will keep your vehicles running.&quot; It seemed like sound advice at the time and I set out to follow it. But I can say today, they were wrong. My mechanics are as hard and as capable as any infantryman in this company. I would dare another grunt to come to my company and pick out who the mechanics were on a patrol, raid, cordon and search, VCP, etc. These guys are my heroes. They bring a trouble shooting mentality to the team that we will figure out any challenge or puzzle regardless what the book solution may say. That is a tremendous force multiplier.

The Marines of headquarters platoon are the unsung heroes of this company. Because they are so diverse in responsibilities and personalities, I will leave it to the compassionate, caring wit of my XO to talk about them individually. But the headquarters Marines are the arms that surround and support this company, sweeping up and plugging the gaps everywhere. They are diverse in capabilities and in occupational specialties in the platoon but generally only one deep.

So while these Marines deliver chow, fix our gear, drive everyone everywhere, support each platoon, serve as corporals of the guard, maintain two sites (peninsula and Camp Baharia), ensure our communication gear works, keep care of our administrative needs, order, receive and deliver parts, deliver fuel, maintain our armory; they also conduct patrols, search houses and fields, participate in the nightly raids and provide security for the HQ CP. Of particular note, standing guard at the headquarters CP warrants more description. They do not have the convenience of maintaining a schedule for the guard force because whenever something goes wrong for the company, headquarters Marines have to be involved. Thus, their guard assignment come often at unknown times for unknown durations because they know their relief may be out doing their primary responsibility and will only be able to relieve them when that task is accomplished. These guys are professionals and it is an honor to serve among them.

The latest stars to rise from this company are the Marines we now refer to as call sign &quot;Lion.&quot; One of our key missions is to defend critical infrastructure - in this case a dam that sits on the Euphrates River. Initially I had been given an Iraqi platoon with a Marine captain and Marine SNCO to help advise the platoon. These advisory billets are referred to as ASTs. They did a good job for us but didn&apos;t bring that Apache passion to the team. This is not to belittle the efforts of my fellow Marines - not in the least bit. I admire their efforts and their role is a key piece in the strategic success of the overall mission here in Iraq. But there came a time in December when the Iraqi platoon was to be replaced and I would not get any ASTs. So I chose two Apache Marines that I thought would be up to the task to replace a captain and a staff sergeant - I chose a sergeant and a lance corporal (Sergeant Jackson and Lance Corporal Ellison). I was unsure of what level of success they would achieve. I never doubted they would accomplish the mission but not having the benefit of training that the ASTs had received, not having received any Arabic language classes, not having the benefit of years of experience and troop handling that a captain and a staff sergeant bring to the table - how much would they accomplish being in charge of Iraqi soldiers in which some of the Iraqis out rank them.

Not to be clich, or slang, or conversational but - oh my God have these guys delivered. These two Marines accomplished more with less than anyone I have ever seen. The expression &quot;no rest for the weary&quot; pales in description to what these Marines have endured and accomplished. These guys have not only &quot;advised&quot; the platoon, they have constructed a well positioned defense, run regular security patrols and IED sweeps, conduct convoys, teach the Iraqis classes, ensure the place is squared away, run the guard, deal with senior officers and officials from the US and Iraqis who come to visit the platoon on the dam and so much more.

This platoon went from being a positive neutral in the mission accomplishment equation to positive success. These guys are out there - alone and unafraid. On top of that, the platoons of Iraqis get switched out about every two weeks, generally unannounced and these Marines start from ground zero over and over again. And yet, every time I go down to see them or they come up to the CP, they are smiling and positive about their mission. They have become such a positive influence on this command that I added three more Marines to the team and the addition has been exponentially more successful. I was a former enlisted Marine who was once a lance corporal, a corporal and then a sergeant. I am almost embarrassed to admit that seeing what these five guys who have earned the same rank as I did have been able to accomplish. Compared to these guys and what they have been able to do, I should never have qualified to leave recruit training.

Even as I write this, reread it and edit it, in order to try to describe to you the power and influence that every man in this company has achieved on the success of the mission and this nation, it seems almost fictional. I hope that when you read it you understand that is told with passionate truth because every Marine in this company legitimately deserves to be recognized as a hero but none of the writing is embellished to illustrate a point. It is ground truth. It overwhelms me daily that so many good men were put on one team at one time and I was the fortunate lottery winner.

As I mentioned earlier, this company has been receiving tremendous accolades from the regiment. I would like to share just two that I have received recently. The first comes from the regimental intelligence officer, Lt Col Bellon, copied from an email (edited for brevity and clarity):
 &quot;You are booming out there on the frontier. In short, you are doing things that other units said were unsupportable. It has convinced me that LAR guys are just more mentally agile and aggressive when finding a way to take it to the enemy. We will see how tonight goes [29 Jan, the night prior to the election] but if we don&apos;t get any IDF [indirect fire], I will be assessing that it is largely do to the successful operation[s] that you [Apache] ran. . . Keep it going.&quot; 
Tonight at the regimental operations and intelligence meeting, the regimental commander, Colonel Shupp, stated the following (paraphrased again for brevity and clarity):
 &quot;I need to recognize you and your Marines in a public forum. Since Apache has taken over the peninsula, your company has been undermanned the entire time covering a battalion zone. You and your Marines run the busiest VCP and you built it from the ground up. You have single handedly taken down the insurgency that was active on the peninsula. You and your Marines are solely responsible for preventing any indirect fire from attacking the city today from the peninsula area. The operation you and your Marines pulled off the other day was to attack a battalion size objective with less than a company and round up 90 military age males. In total fifteen bad guys, seven of which will be going away for a long, long time. Your company has been doing a tremendous job out there. Bravo Zulu.&quot; 

And finally let me share with you two of most meaningful events of the day (election day). Two &quot;feel good&quot; stories about why we are here away from our families for seven months at a time, serving in a dangerous land:

1. An older gentlemen, apparently well educated, made it a point to get the attention of every Marine, Solider and Sailor along the VCP, motion him to come over, shake his hand and say &quot;Thank you. This is the first time in my life my vote actually means something. I hope you never leave.&quot; 

2. My translator approached me about mid-morning and I could tell he was ancy about something. He asked &quot;Sir, can I go vote now.&quot; I told him &quot;Hell yes, Jimmy. Go vote.&quot; He replied &quot;Thank you, sir. It is my right now. Thank you.&quot; 

While the second was obviously more personal to me because I have come to respect Jimmy for all he has done for this company and in turn his country, I believe today was historic. And we were glad to just do our part. It has made so much of this deployment worthwhile and hopefully we honored all the Marines, Soldiers and Sailors who have paid all in this mission by accomplishing what we have done today. To think that just two months ago we were attacking the city with lethal, overwhelming firepower and now a democratic election rose from the ashes of the city defies reality. This is the power of America. This is the power of the human race who can be brutally suppressed by a regime for 30 years and terrorized in their homes by selfish cowards. The resiliency and the survivalist mentality of the Iraqi people makes it easy to believe that we are in the right fight.

I hope CNN&apos;s 30 second sound bites were able to capture this.

Until next time. . .

Pray for peace and God Bless America.

Apache 6 - out

More from the Mad Ghosts

LtCol Mark Smith, 2/24 Battalion Commander, sent this update from Mamudiyah last week - it&apos;s great reading, as always:

 As usual, I am sincere in hoping that this week&apos;s update finds you in good health, high spirits and full of that good ole&apos; Marine Corps motivation. Many has been the occassion, too many, that I have dreaded typing on this computer on a Thursday night, knowing that I would be communicating to you the tragic loss of life of our Marines. Those occasions are branded into my memory, and will haunt me many a day and night. I will finish this update by coming back to that very point. But, on this particular occassion, it has been all I could do not to send the update early. I have eagerly anticipated typing this week&apos;s update and communicating with you the momentous events of this past Sunday. So, please bear with me, for this is a story worthy of being told, and then passed from generation to generation of Mad Ghost families; for they should share a pride that both binds them and guides them for decades to come; decades to be spent in peace and FREEDOM.
To truly understand the significance of what occurred in the Mayhem AO on 30 Jan 2005, I have to give a brief history lesson, covering facts that I was not at liberty to divulge prior to the election. In November of 2004, the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) had made the decision that the S Baghdad District, better known to you as the Mayhem AO, would not have elections. The IIG&apos;s reasoning was sound and their logic clear: it had no Iraqi Police, a fledgling Iraqi Army/National Guard and a violence level that was beyond acceptable. However, and not that it would have mattered one iota, 2/24 was not advised of this decision. All 2/24 knew was that we had a mission: conduct security and stability operations in zone to ensure the conditions were set for the establishment of Iraqi civil administration. Now, please remember back to an earlier email where I introduced you to the Assistant Division Commander of the Fighting 1st Marine Division, BGen Dunford, and his remark that professional Marines do not &quot;discuss exit strategies,&quot; they &quot;achieve an end state.&quot; Well, our stated end state was simple: ensure the conditions are set to conduct elections in S Baghdad on 30 Jan 05! 


There&apos;s more, click the link to keep reading:

 For months, we executed our strategy to achieve that end state. We went into the &quot;zip code offense.&quot; We seized the former and destroyed police station with Co F in Yusufiyah, an absolute stronghold of the Wahabists and Salafist terrorist networks along the Euphrates River. We sezied a former Iraqi Government building with Co G in Lutafiyah, an absolute stronghold of FRE, Ba&apos;ath Party and opportunistic criminals. We took control of Mahmudiyah and Rasheed with Co E and their relentless foot patrolling effort. And, we had the monumental task of securing a 22 mile or so stretch of interstate closed to civilian traffic, and a high visibiIty/target rich environment for the enemy. In doing this, we deliberately chose challenge over simplicity, hardship over comfort, and taking the fight to the enemy over being defensive. It has been phenomenally challenging: from every aspect of Battalion Operations, admin/intelligence/operations/logistics/communications/engineering/civil military operations/ information operations, etc, etc, etc. Just the sustainment challenge alone required the absolute OWNING of main supply routes (MSR). This was done by YOUR Marines living some of the most brutal conditions you can imagine. No, no Hollywood version of brutal, I mean real brutality. No showers, MREs day on stay on, and living under a bridge. Yes, under a bridge. The Marines of Co G who accomplished this mission DESERVE your respect for not only their sheer physical toughness, but for engaging the enemy relentlessly and devastating his ranks to a level that their MSR is now open to civilian traffic! The next challenge was to own one of the alternate supply routes, which was harassed daily by the insurgents, and challenged our sustainment effort. Well, it was time for the Iraqi National Guard to step up. At this time, I was reading much press in the US about the absolute failure of the ING. I did not believe it then, and I KNOW for a fact I don&apos;t believe it now. Our magnificent engineers from Va, supported by our outstanding Marines from Truck Co, PA, set about to move the materials required, and in less that 5 days total time: built 2 bridges and 3 Iraqi checkpoints, all under the watchful eyes and lethal skills/firepower of our Mobile Strike Teams from Weapons Company. Since that time, the ING have captured some of our most high value targets, and now routinely conduct offensive raids against insurgent forces. They are not US Marines, nobody is but US Marines, but they are a viable security force, operating efficiently, and OWNING the streets of the towns in our zone, along side, and more and more, independent of their Marine counterparts. The efforts of Captain Guillermo Rosales, and his unbelievable Marines from 3rd Plt, Co G, who have served as our combined action platoon (CAP), living, mentoring and training the ING have been phenomenal. A book should be written about them and how to conduct CAP.
Simultaneous with these efforts was the counter-insurgency fight! This was where the heavy lifting of the letter companies, E, F and G, supported by the Mobile Strike Teams, Artillery, Mortars and Combat Operations Center would earn their keep and truly see if they have what it takes to be Marines. The Companies set out in earnest, following seizures, on relentless and round the clock patrolling efforts. They learned every resident of every house and every owner of every store and every nook of every cranny. They learned the ebb and flow of the town. They knew when something was right, and when something was wrong. They knew who had legitimate business and who had insurgent business. And, as I expressed last week, they always carried the Flag of the US. They carried it in their spirit. To the legitimate and the oppressed, which was usually one and the same, they brought all the best our country has to offer: compassion, concern, genuine caring and an attempt to solve problems and make life better. To those who had insurgent business, they brought violence. Often times this violence ended in enemy casualties, most times in incarceration.

While the Companies were doing this, the enemy did not sit idly waiting. He set his lethal IEDs, he fired his rockets and mortars, and on some occassions he attacked. On 12 Nov, he tried an attack on Fox Company, that to date, I can find no evidence of a similar attack anywhere in country similar to what he attempted on that day. But what he learned, was futility. Futility and the AWESOME lethality of the combined arms team of a Marine Rifle Company, fully supported by arty, air, mortars and a competent COC can bring. He has never again attempted that suicidal feat, though we stand ready for it, should he try. When he would fire his mortars and rockets, we would fire back. The Marines gained phenomenal skill in counter fire drills and would routinely be firing back en masse in less than minutes, making the occupation of an insurgent mortarman a VERY dangerous profession. They studied his IEDs hard and learned his techniques, and adapted their movement methods to outsmart him.

We had casualties, you all know that. We suffered the sting of death of our own. But, YOUR Marines pressed on, and they pressed harder. They continued their relentless fight, and slowly but surely, the tide was turning. The mortars and rockets were less and less. More IEDs were being found and rendered safe than being detonated. And, hundreds, many hundreds insurgents were raided in the night and whisked off to Abu Ghraib. This was done because as the Companies were unleashed in their zone the intelligence picture was developed. See, the Marines would gather the information, and the amazing Marines of the Human Exploitation Team and the Intelligence Section developed the picture. They learned the cells, identified the networks, put names with faces. In this counter-insurgency our goal is simple: give me two things, their name and where they sleep. If you are an insurgent and we know your name, and we know where you sleep, well, &quot;it is game on for us, game over for you!&quot;

Now, in our saga, we are approaching Christmas time, and we, as a Task Force, are switching from the Command of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit under Col Ron &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; Johnson, to the USA 2nd Brigade Combat Team under Col &quot;Fightin&apos; Mike&quot; Formica. With the 2 BCT came added forces and a set of toys that allowed us to take relentless to a new level: sleepless pursuit of the enemy. For we were still seeking our end state. Then, like a slap in the face, we were hit with the news: no elections in our zone. People living in our zone would have to transit to Baghdad to vote. AGAIN, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE TIME THIS DECISION WAS MADE, IT MADE SENSE! We had no issue with the decision for its merit, only disappointment that we had achieved so much and felt as if we were facing failure. For Marines, this is the worst fear of all: FAILURE. But, just like every good story with a happy ending, this one was full of heroes. One of them was Col Mike Formica. Col Formica went to bat for the Mad Ghosts, and for his Troopers that had 13 months in country, were on an extension to assist us in zone, and had fought in Najaf, Mosul and Fallujah. He went to bat and made the argument that the Mayhem Battalion had achieved the conditions necessary for elections by reducing violence, and could make this happen. Next in the heroes, MGen Chiarelli, CG 1st Cav Div, who took the ball to the next level.

Beyond that, I do not know the heroes, for they are far above my pay grade, but they said yes. They said yes on the caveat that the 2 BCT and 2/24 would have to do the hard work. We would have to establish and secure the sites that would allow for the workers to conduct an election.

Now, for the sake of brevity I will tell you this. Identication of, keeping secret until 48 hours out, seizing and establishing force protection of polling sites is not an easy task. It was days of meticulous planning, changes to the plan, changes to the changes, and then flexibility. But, here is what happened: 8 sites, 2 per urban center in the Mayhem AO were seized and secured. Force protection barriers and procedures were emplaced.

Our Iraqi Army counterparts assumed the inner cordons and hundreds of Iraqi Election Workers and Officials were moved into the sites. Our Election Set was complete at 0700 30 Jan 2005!

What happened? Well, most of you have heard stories in the media and the internet. I will focus on our zone. What happened was a miracle! You can attempt to diminish it any way you choose, if you choose to do so. But for those of us that witnessed it, it was a miracle! Thousands of Iraqi citizens WALKED to the polls to vote! The walked to the polls, they waited in lines for hours, and they voted. They had been threatened with death if they did so, and they voted! They voted for the first time in their lives as FREE men and women. They voted among falling mortars. In Yusufiyah, 20 separate mortar attacks were attempted. Fox would identify the origin, and counter-fire. The enemy was highly ineffective because one, he knew Fox would shoot back, and two, he has been so shot up and decimated he is using his junior varsity, which with these guys the varsity is suspect at best. In Lutafiyah, they tried to mortar and then escape, which is what these cowards do. Too bad for this mortar crew their route of egress was cut by a Mobile Strike Team. Well, suffice it to say, one of them will never be a mortarman or anything else ever again, and two were apprehended, and all of their weaponry and mortar tubes seized! They tried to mortar in Al Rasheed as well, and were attempting to use a four man observation team to direct the accuracy of their rounds. Seems bad luck was all-around this day for the insurgents as one of our Sniper teams put an immediate and permanent halt to that activity.

But, for all the precision and tactical efficiency of your Marines on this day, the miracle was the Iraqi people. With all the threatened violence, and most importantly all the REAL violence that was going on around them, they VOTED! They never broke and ran. They never hesitated. They stayed, and they VOTED. Why? Because, they had tasted the power of FREEDOM. They have had enough of the tyranny, the repression, the brutality, the sheer suffocation of other men telling them their destiny and the inner thoughts of their own minds and their own souls. And, as powerful as those emotions, those passions are; it requires strength to break the chains. Their strength on that day was YOUR Marines! But more than that, and please forgive me, on that day their strength was THEIR Marines!!! Now THEIR Marines and YOUR Marines are the same. YOUR Marines are the Marines that have lived in THEIR towns, have endured THEIR hardship and have striven hard, and given their lives for THEIR children. THEY recognized it. THEY appreciated it. THEY honored it. They did all of these things by standing side by side with YOUR Marines and offering the only resistance to the insurgency they have, THEIR FREEDOM! On this day they showed the world what they learned from YOUR Marines; that &quot;it is better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees.&quot; And one simple question should come of their actions: where did they learn this courage? From a cave hiding Osama Bin Nothing? From a hate spewing and slithering snake Abu Masab Zarpunkery? From Sadam Hussein? No, they learned it from YOUR Marines! And, if you were to ask them, they learned it from THEIR Marines, THEIR neighbor Marines, THEIR caring Marines, THEIR freedom Marines, THEIR brother Marines! Just don&apos;t know how else you explain a midget pushing his 70 year old father two miles under mortar fire so his father could know freedom and the power of the ballot before he dies!

Now Ladies, I do not know what will happen in this region of the world over the next decade. I suspect much violence. I know for us, our fight is not over, and has only intensified as we try to strangle the life out of an insurgency that will never quit and must be vanquished. It will remain for us mortally dangerous work until the day we depart. But, I know this: on 30 Jan 2005 a flame was lit that cannot be extinguished! A flame of liberty that is going to continue to burn until repressed and oppressed people are free of tyranny and terror. It will take a while and it will be bloody. But, such was the beginning of our Nation, and has been our history as we continue to seek the perfection of the human condition to the best ability mankind has to offer!

In closing, let me offer one last anecdote of our weekend. Hundreds of the Iraqi election officials were aboard our FOB, St. Michael, as we achieved election set. We closed our chow hall and turned it into a lounge for them. Something occurred in that lounge that you all MUST know about. The Iraqis, as is their custom, set about drinking sodas, smoking cigarettes and talking in the loud and demonstrative tones they are accustomed to. Except for one spot. There was one spot in our chow hall where they would not smoke, they would not drink, they would not talk. There was one spot where all they would do is stand in silent reverence. That spot...our memorial table with the pictures of our heroic fallen. No, at this spot, they showed nothing but respect and honor! This was not something they were told to do, it was something that came natural to them.

I have asked myself many times why that is, and I have come to this undeniable conclusion: for they were bound with those Marines who gave their last full measure of devotion on the battlefields of Iraq not by religion, not by race, not by color, not by creed, not by custom, not by culture, not by anything one can think of save one thing: they were bound with those Marines as FREE MEN AND WOMEN. And, you see, FREE MEN AND WOMEN can disagree, but cannot hate! In this simple truth is the cause of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In this simple truth, we press on. In this simple truth, Cpl Brian Prenning, Cpl Robert Warns, Cpl Nathaniel Hammond, Cpl Peter Giannopolous, LCpl Branden Ramey, LCpl Daniel Wyatt, LCpl Richard Warner, LCpl Shane O&apos;Donnell, PFC Ryan Cantafio, and PFC Brent Vroman gave their lives. That in bringing freedom to the world, hate will vanquish, and YOU, the ones the loved so dear, will live on free: free of fear, free of opression, free of tyranny and God Almighty in Heaven willing, free of War!

To my 10 Heroes: mission accomplished. Be proud in your brothers, for they honored you. Be proud in your people, they supported you. Be proud of the Iraqis, they learned and they drew courage from you. May you rest with the Angels...eternally free of all pain and sorrow!

God Bless and Keep the Magnificent Families of 2nd Bn, 24th Marines, keepers of the flame of FREEDOM.

LtCol Mark A. Smith,

First Update from 3/8 Marines

LtCol Neary sends this update from Fallujah:

 Dear Family and Friends of Task Force 3D Battalion, 8th Marines,
This is my first letter to you in the first month of our deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Mail has started a steady flow and many of you should be in contact with your loved ones by phone or email. Please guard the information that your loved ones pass along to you. During a casual conversation, they may accidentally transmit sensitive information to you. They should not discuss information regarding our operations here. Please remind them if they do. I know they are excited to tell you about their work here, but please help me with this. I also ask you not to post names and information about our activities on any private Internet web sites. I know that these sites exist for good reasons, however, the enemy here can also access these sites and if they get any sensitive information from them, they will use it to attack us. Again, I am asking for your help on this.

Your Marines and Sailors have been very active in our sector and there are many things happening each day to keep this incredible organization going and keep the enemy on the run. We have been working and training the Iraqi Security Forces and National Guard. Many of these soldiers put their lives and their familys lives on the line to work with us. The work is constant 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The days are full and pass quickly for most of us. We work hard to improve our living conditions and overall security. Except while on patrol every Marine and Sailor has a hard roof over his head, and gets two good hot meals a day. They have access to showers and communications back at their main operating bases at least once a week.

On 30 January, your Marines and Sailors performed magnificently during the first Iraqi election to elect their Transitional National Assembly. The engineers helped modify the two polling sites while our truck platoon moved supplies, barriers, etc., weapons company was providing security on all the major roads, Co I, K, and L provided security at and around the sites while our snipers well they watch over everything from afar. Of course we cant do this without H&amp;S;Company involved in all aspects from medical, maintenance to communications and the chaplains prayers. You would have all been proud. My staff is sharp group of men and I am truly blessed for their dedication to the mission and each other.

Sergeant Major James and I travel our battle space everyday to ensure everyone is doing well. Right now, daily temperatures hover around 60-70 degrees during the day and drop to 40 degrees at night. As we know in a month the temperature will start to climb. I can tell you first hand that your Marines and Sailors are doing a magnificent job performing in conditions like this. They are alert and professional. So far we have been fortunate to have no Marines or Sailors killed in action. I attribute this to our high level of training, intelligent decision-making, aggressive action and some very good luck. Prayer is also helping.

As time permits, I will write again soon. I hope this update has provided you with an insight into the Battalions accomplishments and progress. To the spouses, if you decide to move during the deployment please let your Key Volunteer or GySgt Smith know so we can keep you updated. Thank you to all the Key Volunteers for your professional work. Thank you to all the spouses and families for the support you are providing to this fine outfit. I am humbled to be their leader.

May God Bless You and Task Force 3/8,
Semper Fi!
Stephen M. Neary
Lieutenant Colonel
Commanding Officer, Task Force 3/8

Visit from the Colonel
 
Col. Rick Bartch paid a visit to Cpl. David Arensdorf, CSSB-1, CSSC-122, MT, 1st FSSG a few days ago and caught him wearing his work clothes. Col. Bartch delivered a supply of treats to Cpl Arensdorf and his team - overflow from care packages mailed from troop supporters back home. Proud Marine Mom, Sandy Arensdorf reports that when Col. Bartch commented on the pictures adorning the barracks walls, the Marines cleaned house. If only that worked as well back home.

11th MEU is coming home, wave by wave
 Photo by Cpl. Matthew S. Richards Army General George Casey, commander of all coalition forces in Iraq, visited 11th MEU Marines and sailors here and congratulated them on their role in the success of Najaf, Iraq, Feb. 3. Stating that the battle of Najaf was a tactical success that turned into the first strategic win for the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Interim Government, he also congratulated them on a successful elections that was made possible by the peace they helped create in the city.
The first wave of 11th MEU is home and families have been reunited. Here&apos;s a report from those still in the sandbox:

 It has been a whirlwind of a week. The first main body of MEU Marines and Sailors arrived back at Camp Pendleton today, and no doubt it was a joyous day for those troops and their families and friends.
Earlier this week, Gen. Casey, the top commander of all troops in Iraq, visited MEU Marines and sailors at FOB Duke and congratulated them on their role in the success of Najaf. Stating that the battle of Najaf was a tactical success that turned into the first strategic win for the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Interim Government, he also congratulated them on a successful elections that was made possible by the peace they helped create in the city.

Within the next upcoming weeks and days, the rest of us in Iraq will finish up preparations and packing before heading to Kuwait to catch our plane home. There is still quite a bit to do, but Marines and sailors eager to go home can make miracles happen. We can&apos;t wait to see you all again. Also, just as warning, on Feb. 9 our e-mail will shut down and we will not be able to update the webpage anymore. Take that as a positive sign that we&apos;ll be home soon!

In closing, North County Times reporter Darrin Mortenson and photographer Hayne Palmour are still with us. Just in case you might have missed on, listed below are the stories that they have produced so far.

24th MEU Chaplain&apos;s Call

If you could write your life, what words would you choose? How would you develop your own character and plan your personal plot? Lt. Cmdr. Louis Rosa, 24th MEU Chaplain, contemplates the magnum opus still in production by the Marines who will soon end the chapter on this deployment and move on to the next.

 Deployments are like a novel. Each novel is divided into parts. The pre-deployment work ups and planning is the introduction, the body of the book is the deployment and the conclusion is the return and reunion. Many books have an epilogue, the final scene of a story that comments on or summarizes the main action. Regarding our deployment, this is yet to be written.
Like any good book, the reader should walk away from it having experienced different emotions. A great book is designed to make us grow, expand our horizons and challenge us. Deployments are definitely designed to do that. Our reunion with our loved ones is the &apos;epilogue&apos; of this deployment. How we choose to summarize what has taken place in our life the past few months are pages yet to be written-by us.

How we have changed in the area of our home life, work and emotions will take some creative writing because it comes from the true creativity that only deployments can inspire. Like a focused author it takes effort to do this effectively.

If someone read your novel how will they know how you changed? Which new skills and interests have you acquired? How has your appearance altered from a few months ago? How have new routines changed the family structure? Most importantly, how has this deployment shifted priorities in your life? Books and deployments focus on an aspect of what is important to the author and to the reader. If you were writing an account of this deployment what would be the evidence of what&apos;s really become important in your life? How will the epilogue, the summary, of your novel indicate a shift in perception of what the future will be like now that your loved one is home?

How you choose to write the epilogue of this deployment will determine how great of a bestseller it will be. So whether yours is a romance, an action thriller, a mystery or a how to book on how to survive a deployment the ending is the cinch to it&apos;s success. Remember, every great book leaves room for a sequel. Here&apos;s wishing you a bestseller success!

After-election report from MSSG-31

LtCol J. Alex Vohr reports from Iraq:



 
I hope this letter finds you well. It has been a busy month for MSSG 31 with all of the events leading up to and culminating in the historic Iraqi election yesterday. Every Marine and Sailor played a large role in the setting the stage to allow for election success by either working to support the I MEF efforts to provide a secure environment or by helping put together polling sites that were a secure place for Iraqi citizens to vote. It was pretty incredible to see and nothing less than the result of a tremendous amount of hard work on the part of many people.

I am truly in awe of the Marines and Sailors of MSSG 31. When I assumed command in June 2004, I was struck by how many junior personnel we had in the unit. Most were Privates First Class and Lance Corporals. In the time we have been here they have all become experienced professionals. The exposure to operations in a combat environment has transformed them all in a positive way. During the elections we were responsible for the movements of significant amounts of barrier materials and building the force protection barrier plan for a large polling site. The Marines of the motor transport detachment and landing support moved all of this material without a hitch. The engineers worked an entire day and throughout the night to build the site, adjusted it all during the following day, and then stepped up to the task of being active members of the security force during the actual elections. The female Marines and Sailors of the MSSG served as searchers for female voters, demonstrating tremendous courage at the point of greatest danger. Every other Marine and Sailor of the MSSG contributed to the efforts to include an entire platoon acting as provisional infantry to bolster security through the crucial time period. In short, they were and are unbelievable!

The Executive Officer, Sergeant Major and I often comment on how good they are and how what they are learning now will make the difference as they mature and assume leadership roles in the Marine Corps or in a civilian role if they choose to go that way. With Marines and Sailors like these, the future of the nation is well in hand.

It will not be long before MSSG 31 heads towards home port. Until then, we will keep doing what we are doing and I will keep you posted.

Until next time and as always, Im proud and you should be proud of the Marines and Sailors of MSSG 31. It is an honor to serve with them.

Thanks for all your support

The All Star Team heads for home

CSSB-7 is coming home to 29 Palms! Here is the last update from LtCol Doolin,
Commanding Officer:

 Dear CSSB-7 Friends and Families;
I am happy to report that this will be the final letter for this deployment! As I mentioned in a recent letter, the majority of CSSB-7 personnel will return stateside *****, with twenty-five percent arriving ******. That will bring a close to Operation Iraqi Freedom II-II and your loved ones assignment to CSSB-7.

When we first arrived in Iraq last August I set some clear and challenging goals for this battalion. First, I wanted us to quickly come together as a team, as we came from around the Marine Corps and around the world to build this battalion. I used the analogy of an All Star Team where we have ties to great units, places, family and friends, but for these 6 months, we would build something special that we could be proud of and remember for years to come. Second, we would set high standards and maintain them throughout the deployment so we could show the younger Marines what it is to be in a truly great unit. Third, I said that we would become the Best Combat Logistics Battalion in the U.S. Marine Corps. Lastly, and most importantly, by achieving these lofty goals, we stood the best chance of succeeding in our mission and bringing everyone home alive.

As of the date of this writing, we have met and exceeded these early goals. You will not be surprised to know that your Marines and Sailors excelled at every turn and are deserving of the title hero, although none of them will want to be referred as such. While the challenge was significant, and the enemy cunning and persistent, we have shown the tenacity and wherewithal that Marines and Sailors have shown for over 200 years. We did not come away unscathed, as this is war, and war has high risk and costs. We continue to pray for all our brothers and sisters from all services who were wounded or killed in combat, and we pray for continued strength for their loved ones who have sacrificed dearly. We particularly remember our brothers from Charlie Company, 6th Engineer Support Battalion from Peoria Illinios who suffered greatly in a suicide vehicle attack on December 22, 2004. Your courage and sacrifice is not forgotten.

We thank each of you and the thousands of Americans who have supported us throughout this deployment. The cards, care packages, letters from schoolchildren, prayers, and well wishes were phenomenal and gave us immeasurable strength. A heartfelt Thank You also goes out to the Key Volunteer Network who gave so much of their time and care to the families of this battalion. You are Awesome!

It has been an honor and a privilege to command this wonderful battalion of Americas finest. I look forward to returning to Twentynine Palms, California to rejoin my family and friends, and begin to prepare CSSB-7 for the next time we are called upon to serve in combat.

May you have a wonderful reunion with your loved ones, and may God continue to bless you in the months ahead.

Thank you for your untiring support.

Sincerely,
Drew T. Doolin 

 
It looks foggy but it&apos;s a sandstorm. We&apos;re again recruiting volunteers to sew sand scarves - strips of t-shirt material that wrap around the lower face to protect against the invasive sand. And if your Marine needs them, let us know. We have a small supply that we&apos;d like to get over there. As always, these are done on strictly volunteer basis so there is no charge for the scarf.

The price paid for freedom

 

Last week, when television networks broke the story of a helicopter crash with Marines on board, each family of a Marine in Iraq held their breath, mentally evaluating where their child or husband or sibling was located, what the odds were that they might be on that chopper, trying not to think of what might be on the other side of a knock at their door. For 31 families of Marines on that helicopter, that terrible calculus was proved. Their loved one will not be coming home.
