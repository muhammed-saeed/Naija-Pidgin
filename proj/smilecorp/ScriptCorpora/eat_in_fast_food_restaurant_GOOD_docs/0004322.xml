 Some McDonald’s to sell $1 drinks for summer 

March 17th, 2010, 4:18 pm· ·posted by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 
This McDonald&apos;s 32 oz. beverage sells for $1.89 in Orange.
 
Looks like some McDonald’s in the United States will start selling $1 beverages after Memorial Day.

Earlier today, the Wall Street Journal reported that the world’s largest burger chain would push $1 drinks for the summer— repeating a discount program that did well in 2009.

Last year, some Southern California restaurants served $1 sodas and teas, including several in Orange County. For a large soda, that would result in a savings of about 89 cents. (prices vary by market)

McDonald’s spokeswoman Danya Proud said about 90 percent of domestic restaurants“did in fact take advantage”of last year’s $1 promo.

Mum’s the word, for now, about what locations will serve the $1 drinks. But, likely those who saw success will repeat the promotion, Proud indicated.

 The program did“contribute to bottom line growth”last summer and local operators who want to try it again have approval to repeat the discount, Proud said. Last year, consumers could buy  a 32-ounce soft drink or sweet tea for $1.  ( SoCal restaurant locations/contact info )

The $1 beverage program comes as McDonald’s gears up for adding frappes and smoothies to menus. The two flavors –Strawberry Banana and Wild Berry—will land in Southern California McDonald’s by the summer.  (Note:  Some frappes are already in local stores.)
