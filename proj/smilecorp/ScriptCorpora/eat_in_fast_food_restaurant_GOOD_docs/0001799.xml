Eating Out in St Petersburg
 Edit This 
A Jam filled Blini from Tepemok

Zoey
 Having a good meal in St. Petersburg has never been a problem because there are wide varieties of places to dine in the city.
If you are the busy type who is always on the move (tourists, students, workers), the best bet would be a Fast food restaurant. This is where Carrols, Mc Donalds and a host of other establishments come in.
Chopsticks Lovers could always find a place to practice this art as there are many Chinese restaurants in the city. Try the &quot;Chopsticks&quot; restaurant and a host of others.
The Japanese are not left as a small part of the mighty Japan has moved to St. Petersburg. For delicious and exotic Japanese cuisine check out Sakura , Segun , Kyoto and Fujiyama . Sure, you will not be disappointed.
 Russian and European cuisine is also available in many of the restaurants in the city. Try the 1001 nights restaurant. Davidov is a good place to dine out if you have opted for spicy Russian cuisine. Demyanova Ukha is also a classy place for those who love seafoods. There are a host of other restaurants in this category.
Those who love it the Italian way can always find a solace in the many Pizza restaurants in the city. I recommend Pizza Hut for those who love it big and tasty. La Strada is a wonderful place for hot, tasty pizza. You can also dine at Patio Pizza and a host of others.
