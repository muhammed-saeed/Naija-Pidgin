There are many people who are free during the summer or would like to make some extra money to help pay bills, pay off debt or save more for vacation, retirement or whatever they want. Students and teachers are very likely to be looking for employment during the summer too.

You can easily make some extra money this summer by picking up a part time, full time or freelance job through the summer. Here are some great ideas on how to make some extra bucks:

 Mowing grass and/or landscape work Freelance writing with local newspapers/magazines/online publishers Freelance work Get a summer job with Kings Dominion Photography Babysitting Tutoring Have a yard sale (potentially weekly if you do not sell everything after one yard sale) Cashier job at local retailers who ramp up for summer time and holidays Host a party and earn money and/or free items (candles, jewelry, makeup, bags, household products) Sell and host parties for direct selling companies like Avon , Mary Kay , Premier Designs Jewelry , Lia Sophia , Creative Memories Scrapbooking , Pampered Chef , Thirty-One, Passion Parties and Scentsy Odd jobs for neighbors or community, like painting, handyman services , tree trimming, walking dogs, watering gardens or lawns, house sitting or pet sitting Become a caddy for a golf course Perform household chores and cleaning for others like elderly or disabled people Deliver newspapers Wash and detail cars Become a lifeguard at a local pool or YMCA Sell items in Times-Dispatch or Richmond.com classifieds Work part-time at a daycare center watching children Get a part-time job at a restaurant as a waiter/waitress Get a part-time job at the mall or a fast food restaurant Referee for soccer games or other children’s sports Teach music lessons, reading, computer skills or anything else you are familiar with Start a fit club to help students or others to stay active during the summer, walking, biking, swimming and other exercises and charge an hourly rate like a personal trainer or fitness instructor Work at a summer camp where you can do various jobs from teaching and interacting with kids to helping serve lunches or helping children participate in activities If you’re already a teacher , teach one summer class to make some extra money Pick up a custodian/janitorial position at an office 

Learn something new by taking classes, an online course , getting a certification or some kind of training to advance your skills and knowledge to potentially get a raise or open you up to more opportunities. This one won’t pay off immediately, but getting extra training or professional development could pay for itself with a boost in your salary.

There is a ton of free information available online and in video segments on YouTube . Also, there are lots of online courses available now that do not cost as much as traditional classes.
