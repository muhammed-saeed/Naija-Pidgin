Jan 3 2006 | Canada | Market Update 
 Highlight: U.S. fresh strawberry exports to Canada are increasing. During 
 2005, sales to the northern neighbor are expected to exceed 
 70,000 metric tons for the first time, reaching a value of more 
 than $150 million. In the Canadian import market for frozen 
 strawberries, competition from processed product from Mexico, 
 China, and Chile is increasing rapidly.

Jan 3 2006 | Russian Federation | New Spirits Law 
 Amended 
 Highlight: Russia significantly amended its new spirits law, reducing 
 substantially the law&apos;s potential to disrupt the import of 
 spirits, wine, and beer. The new law expected to be signed over 
 the New Year&apos;s weekend holiday, still changes the procedures for 
 importation of these products and exporters should remain in 
 contact with importers on the law&apos;s impact.

Jan 3 2006 | Taiwan | Taiwan to Enact New Quarantine 
 Controls on Two Fruit Pests 
 Highlight: ATO Taipei alert on new quarantine restrictions placed on fresh 
 fruit imports from several important non-US suppliers of fresh 
 fruit to Taiwan, including Australia, Japan and Korea. While the 
 potential for market closure exists should quarantine pests be 
 detected, ATO Taipei believes that affected countries already 
 have pre-export programs in place that should, under normal 
 circumstances, effectively prevent quarantine pest detections in 
 exported fruit.

Dec 30 2005 | Australia | Annual 
 Highlight: Australian apple production in 2006 is forecast to decline to 
 280 TMT following historically high production in 2005. Pear 
 production in 2006 is forecast at 145 TMT. Establishing market 
 access for U.S. apples to Australia is a high priority for USDA. 
 GOA import policy for U.S. apples will be based on conditions 
 for New Zealand apples. The comment period for the import risk 
 analysis report (IRA) for New Zealand apples closes on March 30, 
 2006.

Dec 30 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of | Ya Pears 
 Highlight: As Chinas #2 fruit produce, Ya Pears and its exports have 
 become a matter of national pride for exporters and government 
 officials. The U.S.s current production of Asian pears is 
 sufficiently supplying current U.S. market demand for Asian 
 pears, including Ya pears. China currently exports less than 15% 
 of the countrys fresh pear production to the world. The average 
 American citizen eats only 3 pounds of fresh pears a year 
 compared to 19 pounds of fresh apples.

Dec 30 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of | January to 
 October 
 Highlight: This report presents China Customs agricultural, fishery, and 
 forestry trade data recorded from January to October 2005. This 
 month carpenters wood and frozen fish have elevated to the 
 top-twenty five commodities exported to and imported from the 
 U.S. while soybeans remain the #1 import for China from the 
 world and U.S. To date, China has imported $5.8 billion worth of 
 agricultural, fishery, and forestry commodities from the U.S.

Dec 30 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of | Cold 
 Storage in South China: Keeping US Chilled Exports Competitive 
 in the 
 Highlight: Although China represents a potentially vast market for US 
 agricultural exports, lack of a cold storage infrastructure 
 severely limits market penetration of temperature sensitive 
 products. Chinas cold chain capacity is only 20 to 30 percent 
 of current demand and spoilage losses range form 16 to 33 
 percent. The resultant price increase and decline in quality 
 erodes long-term product acceptance and the competitive 
 advantage of US products. Chinas cold chain is improving though 
 domestic and foreign investment that will help US agricultural 
 exporters tap into a lucrative and growing market. CH5617

Dec 30 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of | Food and 
 Culture: Holiday Foods and Opportunities for US Exporters in a 
 Tr 
 Highlight: China observes a wide variety of traditional and modern 
 holidays. Filled with rich cultural meaning and a long history, 
 traditional Chinese festivals compose an important part of 
 Chinese culture. The importance of food in these festivals and 
 the shear number of celebrants may provide new inroads for US 
 agricultural exports especially as more and more consumers turn 
 to convenience, innovation, and dining out during festivals. CH5618

Dec 30 2005 | Germany | Annual 
 Highlight: U.S. wine sales to Germany in terms of value increased slightly 
 by 0.6 percent to $77 million in 2005, although the total volume 
 decreased nearly ten percent to 430,000 hectoliters (hl). In 
 2004, American exporters shipped 480,000 hl of wine to Germany. 
 Almost two thirds were in bulk. In 2005, the German wine crop 
 was 10 percent smaller than last year&apos;s harvest. The smaller 
 crop and lower wine stocks are reportedly pushing wine prices up 
 at the producer level. German per capita consumption reached 
 record highs in 2004 (20.1 liters) although it appears to be 
 leveling off in 2005

Dec 30 2005 | Germany | Semi-Annual 
 Highlight: FAS/Berlin raises the estimate for German commercial apple 
 production in MY 2005/06 (harvest 2005) from 915,000 to 960,000 
 MT, while the non-commercial production is reduced from 500,000 
 to 450,000 MT. The production estimate for pears is left 
 unchanged.

Dec 30 2005 | India | GOI Publishes Draft PFA Rules 
 Amendment Regarding Labeling of Packaged Food 
 Highlight: This report summarizes a proposed amendment, regarding the 
 labeling of packaged food, to the&quot;Prevention of Food 
 Adulteration Rules&quot;(PFA). Among other changes, the proposed 
 amendment would require, for the first time, nutritional 
 information to be present on packaged foods&apos; labeling. This 
 amendment, dated November 25, 2005, has not been notified to the 
 WTO.

Dec 30 2005 | Italy | Citrus Annual 2005 
 Highlight: Italian citrus production for 2005/06 is expected to be slightly 
 up from last year. Orange production is forecasted up 10% from 
 2004/05, while other products are stable. The quality of the 
 fruit is generally good. Italian citrus growers are targeting 
 the U.S. market for their specialty products such as Sicilian 
 blood oranges and Calabria organic tangerines.

Dec 30 2005 | Italy | Fresh Deciduous Fruit - 
 Semiannual 
 Highlight: Italian fresh fruit end-of-campaign data largely confirms our 
 previous estimates. The 2005 campaign was favorable for pears, 
 apples and table grapes, both in terms of volume produced and in 
 quality of fruit. High apple production in Italy was further 
 complemented by lower production in Poland, and farmers are 
 generally optimistic. The table grape sector is facing 
 increasing difficulties because of decreasing exports. IT5041

Dec 30 2005 | Russian Federation | Russia&apos;s Food 
 Imports Reach Record Highs 
 Highlight: Exporters to Russia can realize substantial business due to 
 several ongoing trends. Russia is poised to purchase almost $15 
 billion in food and agricultural products from abroad in 2005, 
 over $1 billion from the United States. Retail sales grew an 
 impressive 12 percent in 2004 and reached $198.3 billion. 
 Forty-four percent of products sold through retail are imported 
 products. Retail outlets have started to expand aggressively 
 into the regions new potential markets for quality, imported 
 goods and prospective venues for marketing programs. The HRI 
 sector grew at a fast pace as well. According to experts, 90 
 percent of food prepared in restaurants and cafes in Western 
 Russia is imported. The local food processing industry has 
 become one of the most dynamic sectors of the Russian economy, 
 with an average increase of 15-20 percent per year. Processors 
 are willing to meet international quality standards and focus on 
 quality ingredients. Exporters should expect to support sales 
 with a marketing effort that provides coaching and counseling to 
 their importer. Effective relationship building is a key 
 ingredient to success. RS5318

Dec 30 2005 | Russian Federation | Russian importers 
 seeking new citrus suppliers 
 Highlight: In 2004, Russia imported 46,000 tons of grapefruit. In 2005, 
 that mark will be equaled or surpassed according to ATO 
 estimates. Most of Russia&apos;s busiest months for fruit imports are 
 in the Fall. Russia is the third global export market for 
 grapefruit after Japan and Canada. Among the leading suppliers 
 of grapefruit to Russia are Turkey, Israel, South Africa and 
 Argentina. The grapefruit market in Russia offers opportunities 
 for new exporters to enter the market as the demand for higher 
 quality products is growing. ATO has received many inquiries 
 this season for interest in Florida, Texas, and California 
 citrus. Other suppliers present on the Russian market can only 
 provide enough volumes to satisfy 50 percent of importers needs. 
 Lack of marketing and brand awareness in the fruit industry will 
 benefit exporters to Russia who are willing to start 
 advertisement activities in Russian stores and grocery markets. RS5319

Dec 30 2005 | Russian Federation | Transportation and 
 Logistics Update: Greater Port of St. Petersburg 
 Highlight: The Greater Port of St. Petersburg is the primary portal for 
 U.S. agricultural and food products entering the Russian 
 Federation, which consists mostly of containerized consumer 
 ready products. Increasing quantities of U.S. poultry, pork, 
 fish, and fresh fruit cross the threshold into Russia via St. 
 Petersburg. Cargo can be delayed due to customs, sanitary, and 
 phytosanitary regulations, but the Port also is in need of 
 modernization. One of Russia&apos;s wealthiest businessmen now holds 
 a majority share of port and such investments are planned.

Dec 30 2005 | South Africa, Republic of | Monthly 
 Update 
 Highlight: The estimate of the 2004 South African corn crop was revised 
 from 12.4 to 11.7 million tons after disappointing deliveries. A 
 substantial cutback in area planted is expected for the 2005 
 planting season as a result of both market and weather factors. 
 This has already alleviated the oversupply perception and 
 bolstered domestic prices. The crop is still very dependent on 
 weather conditions over the next few months but could reach 
 about 7.3 million tons. Exports continue unabated and imports 
 are expected to resume soon. SF5044

Dec 27 2005 | Brazil | Annual Report 
 Highlight: The MY 2006/07 Brazilian orange crop is projected at 447 MBx, up 
 41 MBx compared to MY 2005/06 (406 MBx), assuming that normal 
 weather conditions prevail during 2006. Orange prices should 
 remain firm as a consequence of the relative tight supply and 
 demand balance. The Sao Paulo and western Minas Gerais 
 commercial areas should produce 360 MBx, up 40 MBx from MY 
 2005/06. Total FCOJ 65 Brix equivalent production for MY 2005/06 
 is estimated at 1.285 mmt, down 197,000 metric tons from 
 previous MY, due to lower availability of fruits for processing. 
 FCOJ exports for MY 2005/06 are estimated at 1.335 mmt BR5026 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 
 
Dec 27 2005 | Burma, Union of | Beans and Pulses 
 Monthly Trade Report - November 
 Highlight: Burma exported 35,959 metric tons of beans and pulses in 
 November 2005, down by 20 percent from the same period in 2004. 
 India accounted for 89 percent of total exports, followed by 
 China (5 percent). BM5029

Dec 27 2005 | Canada | Production and Trade Update 
 Highlight: Canadian honey production in 2005 slipped to 33,918 metric tons, 
 1% below the year earlier level due to lower production in 
 Alberta and in British Columbia. Low prices for honey are 
 adversely affecting the market. Some beekeeping groups are 
 exploring Canadian anti-dumping law provisions over concerns 
 about imports of low-priced Chinese honey.

Dec 27 2005 | New Zealand | Annual 
 Highlight: New Zealand&apos;s apple harvest for 2006 is forecast to decline 3 
 percent to 488,000 tons. This will reduce apple exports by 6 
 percent to 300,000 tons. Pear production in 2006 is forecast to 
 increase 55 percent to 10,600 tons, increasing exports 27 
 percent to 6,500 tons. Pipfruit New Zealand is scheduled to 
 introduce an &apos;export market panel&apos; that will administer a new 
 voluntary quality standard. Biosecurity Australia issued a draft 
 import risk analysis report for the importation of New Zealand 
 apples into Australia. The New Zealand apple industry has 
 reacted negatively to the report, arguing that the IRA is 
 inconsistent with WTO findings in a similar case between the 
 United States and Japan. NZ6001

Dec 27 2005 | Spain | Semi-Annual 
 Highlight: We have revised our Marketing Year (MY) 2005 Spanish deciduous 
 fruit supply and demand tables in light of new production and 
 trade data. Due to a larger-than-anticipated deciduous fruit 
 harvest, we have increased our estimate of Spanish MY 2005 apple 
 exports to 100,000 metric tons (MT) (90,000 in our previous 
 report) up from 87,706 MT in MY 2004, and pear exports to 
 132,000 MT (120,000 MT in our previous report), up from 113,779 
 MT in MY 2004. The new Spanish apple and pear export estimates 
 reflect new production information indicating a very good 
 production performance during the worst drought in 60 years 
 year. (LR24SH2).

 Dec 27 2005 | Argentina | Report 
 Highlight: The Argentine market of food ingredients of natural origin 
 accounts for $120 million, of which imports are approximately 10 
 percent. Imported food ingredients are usually those which are 
 not manufactured locally. There is a significant market for some 
 U.S. food ingredients among local producers of ingredients, who 
 use them to manufacture high-value, tailor-made food products.

Dec 27 2005 | Brazil | Post-Planting Update 
 Highlight: With the soybean crop essentially planted and rust seemingly 
 under control, industry eyes are focused on the weather, the 
 main factor with potential to block a record harvest in Brazil. 
 Profit margins, however, are expected to be low as a result of 
 the strong Brazilian Real, which is making inputs more costly 
 and exports less lucrative. Post&apos;s forecast remains at 61 MMT on 
 21.9 million hectares, representing an area reduction of 4% over 
 2004/05. BR5633 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Dec 27 2005 | Spain | Semi-Annual 
 Highlight: We have revised our Marketing Year (MY) 2005 Spanish deciduous 
 fruit supply and demand tables in light of new production and 
 trade data. Due to a larger-than-anticipated deciduous fruit 
 harvest, we have increased our estimate of Spanish MY 2005 apple 
 exports to 100,000 metric tons (MT) (90,000 in our previous 
 report) up from 87,706 MT in MY 2004, and pear exports to 
 132,000 MT (120,000 MT in our previous report), up from 113,779 
 MT in MY 2004. The new Spanish apple and pear export estimates 
 reflect new production information indicating a very good 
 production performance during the worst drought in 60 years 
 year. (LR24SH2).

 Dec 15 2005 | Canada | Annual 
 Highlight: Softwood lumber production is forecast to increase in 2006 as a 
 result of the increase in allowable annual cut in several timber 
 supply areas in British Columbia, due to the Mountain Pine 
 Beetle infestation. Exports of softwood lumber are forecast to 
 increase slightly as production increases and demand remains 
 strong. The pace of housing starts in Canada is expected to 
 decline slightly in 2006, but the demand for softwood products, 
 furniture, millwork products, kitchen cabinets, structural wood 
 products and many other wood products is still expected to be 
 strong. Increased third country competition, especially from 
 China, is forcing major changes and consolidations in the 
 Canadian forestry and furniture industries. CA5065

 Highlight: The 2005 Japanese&quot;unshu mikan&quot;tangerine crop is estimated to 
 be 1.11 million MT, up 4.7% from the previous season. Mild 
 spring weather helped produce good tangerine crops, although 
 over-supply of early-crop tangerines led to lower market prices. 
 The amount of 2005/06 grapefruit shipments from Florida to Japan 
 is estimated at 6 to 7 million cartons, which is significantly 
 below average for the second consecutive year. Japanese traders 
 will hold back major sales promotions of Florida product until 
 the new year when sufficient fruit becomes available. South 
 Africa experienced record shipments of grapefruit to Japan in 
 the summer of 2005, creating a huge inventory in the nation&apos;s 
 cold storage warehouses. Japanese traders expect higher demand 
 for U.S. oranges in the early spring after domestic tangerines 
 clear the market. The weakening Japanese yen is a serious 
 concern for Japanese citrus importers. JA5075

Dec 15 2005 | Poland | EU accession impact on 
 agricultural production and trade 
 Highlight: To date, accession has proven to be a mixed bag for Polish 
 farmers. Poland was not flooded with EU products, as many feared 
 prior to accession. In reality, some sectors thrived, other 
 appeared untouched and a few suffered from increased 
 competition. Sugar producers gained the most. The livestock, 
 meat and dairy sectors experienced a significant increase in 
 exports to other EU countries due to the elimination of tariffs 
 and modernization of these sectors with the use of EU pre- and 
 post-accession structural funds. Grain producers faced a severe 
 drop in prices, not due to accession but as a result of good 
 crops in 2004 and 2005. Their losses, however, were partly 
 offset by CAP market intervention mechanisms. The oilseeds and 
 fruit processing sectors remained relatively untouched. 
 Strawberry producers, however, faced stiff competition from 
 lower priced imports from China as a result of lower import 
 tariffs brought by accession.

 presented a paper setting out proposals for the EU budget from 
 2007 to 2013. Reaction from other Member States as well as the 
 EU institutions has been negative as the paper calls for cuts to 
 CAP expenditure of EUR 2 bn and EUR 8 bn for rural development 
 (over the six year life of the next EU budget). Over the next 
 few days it will become clearer whether there will be sufficient 
 political consensus to quickly negotiate the EU budget package

Dec 9 2005 | EU-25 | EU agrees sugar reform 
 Highlight: The European Agriculture Council has agreed a set of reforms to 
 the EU sugar sector that will see an eventual 36% price cut, 
 with beet growers compensated with direct income payments. In 
 addition, there will be a form of quota buyback scheme, funded 
 by those processors staying in the sugar sector paying a levy, 
 which will fund payments to those processors leaving the sector. 
 The net result of the sugar reform is that by 2011, EU sugar 
 production will be reduced by between one quarter to one third 
 from a roughly 20 MMT today (white sugar) to perhaps 13 to 15 
 MMT. The EU will cease to be a major exporter on world sugar 
 markets and may even become a net sugar importer. The reforms 
 are expected to leave the EU sugar price at roughly double world 
 market prices compared to currently being over triple world 
 prices. E35225

 Highlight: The total size of the tree nut and edible seed market in Korea 
 is estimated at $87.8 million for 2005, an increase of 15 
 percent from the previous year. Imports of edible seeds, such as 
 sunflower seeds, and tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, 
 pistachios, pecans and macadamia nuts, have increased steadily. 
 The growing Korean market for healthy foods and the well-being 
 trend has contributed to this increase, especially for nuts. The 
 growth in per capita incomes and the proliferation of new 
 products by a rapidly expanding bakery and confectionery 
 industry have also contributed to this growth. Nuts and edible 
 seeds are increasingly being used for snacks and in food 
 products such as cookies, cakes, ice cream and chocolates. KS5065

Dec 5 2005 | South Africa, Republic of | Monthly 
 Update 
 Highlight: In spite of a late start to the rainfall season, the planting of 
 corn has started in the eastern production areas. As a result of 
 overproduction and low prices, Grain SA still recommends that 
 farmers do not plant at all this season. Prices have recovered 
 and producers may be tempted to plant again. The 2004 corn crop 
 is unofficially estimated at 11.7 million tons and the new, 2005 
 crop could reach about 7 million tons. This will alleviate the 
 oversupply. SF5041

Dec 1 2005 | Austria | Austrian Sugar Beet Farmers and 
 Sugar Industry Fear EU Sugar Reform
 Highlight: A recent study by the Federal Institute of Agricultural 
 Economics concluded that implementation of the EU sugar reform 
 will result in a 12.2% to 20% income loss for Austrian sugar 
 beet farmers with some farms going out of business. The Austrian 
 sugar refining industry will also be hit hard by reform with the 
 country&apos;s sole sugar refiner, AGRANA, thinking that it will be 
 forced to close one of its three factories in Austria. AU5028 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 

Dec 1 2005 | Bosnia and Herzegovina | Crop Update
 Highlight: According to the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Entities 
 Agricultural Ministries unofficial estimates, the winter wheat 
 area is approximately 72,000 hectares, down 10% from the 
 previous season. The reason for this was adverse summer weather 
 that lowered vegetable production, and therefore limited 
 farmers financial capabilities to sow wheat. The Ag Ministries 
 reported total corn production at 1,140,891 MT harvested from 
 208,000 ha. The changing summer weather conditions and heavy 
 rain in September did not reduce corn yield; however, the 
 weather conditions affected corn quality, which is lower than 
 usual. Total winter barley area is estimated at 14,200 ha (4,200 
 ha in the Federation and 10,000 in the RS). BK5012 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Dec 1 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of | Annual
 Highlight: Chinas citrus production is forecast to drop by 4 percent from 
 14.9 MMT in MY 2004 to 14.5 MMT in MY 2005 due to cold 
 temperatures and typhoons in major production areas. Acreage 
 continues to expand and fruit quality continues to improve. 
 Domestic consumption grows slowly and consumer preferences are 
 shifting to higher quality and the perception of safer food. 
 While Chinas citrus exports to neighboring countries are 
 expanding, imports of oranges are declining.

 are forecast at 160,000 MT, of which approximately 130,000 MT 
 will be exported to the United States. The year-round opening of 
 the U.S. market, which became effective January 31st, 2005, will 
 allow Mexican Hass avocados to be shipped to 47 of the 50 U.S. 
 states. Even though producers and shippers were not granted 
 year-round access to the U.S. market during MY 2004/05, as they 
 had expected, exports still reached a record 112,000 MT last 
 year. MX5107 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Dec 1 2005 | Poland | Polish Reaction to EU Sugar 
 Reforms
 Highlight: Polish farmers can live with the EU reforms targeted at sugar 
 beet producers, mainly because of the increase in the phase out 
 periods for prices and production quotas. But, farmers are 
 extremely concerned that the reforms targeted at the processing 
 industry will cause sugar plants, many of which are 
 foreign-owned in Poland, to close down thus reducing demand for 
 sugar beets. A drastic decline in beet processing capacity could 
 render Poland a net sugar importer, although it otherwise would 
 be fully capable of meeting its domestic sugar requirements. PL5037

Dec 1 2005 | Turkey | Annual
 Highlight: Turkey&apos;s domestic seed production is not sufficient to meet 
 local demand despite the industry&apos;s privatization in the 1980&apos;s 
 and continued support from the government. Turkey imported 
 approximately 27 TMT of seeds worth approximately USD 69 million 
 in 2004 and 25 TMT of seeds worth USD 72 million during the 
 first nine months in 2005. The European Union remains the major 
 supplier to Turkey. Turkey applies zero duty on imports of 
 almost all seeds. TU5045

 Market
 Highlight: Greece is an import-dependent country with total CY 2004 
 agricultural imports from the U.S. of $128 million. The 
 fastest-growing component of Greece&apos;s agricultural imports from 
 the U.S. are consumer ready products, amounting to $64 million 
 in 2004 compared to $27.2 million in 2000, with tree nuts 
 leading the category. This report prepared by the FAS/Athens 
 Office for U.S. exporters provides information on Greece&apos;s 
 economic situation, market structure, exporter tips and best 
 prospects for high-value food and agricultural products. GR5028

Nov 29 2005 | Hungary | Crop Update
 Highlight: According to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), 
 more than 80 % of the corn production area has been harvested. 
 The average yield of the harvested areas is 7.7 MT/ha. The total 
 harvested crop is 7 million MT. Dry, mild, still weather helped 
 the drying down of the crop. Soil cultivation and winter crop 
 seeding (such as rapeseed, autumn barley, and winter wheat) were 
 delayed by the moist soil and the prolonged corn and sunflower 
 harvest. Winter wheat seeding was also late with more than 1 
 million ha being completed by mid-November. The Government of 
 Hungary expects a ten percent increase in seeded area in the 
 next few days. The total production area for winter wheat may 
 reach the previous year level, but seeding was completed later 
 than optimum, and unfavorable winter weather may damage the weak 
 green crop. Hungary still copes with a domestic and regional 
 shortage of grain store capacity. HU5016

 claimed it will ensure a long-term competitive future for the EU 
 sugar sector. As would be expected, industry has been more 
 cautious in its praise, focusing its attention on the positives 
 of the late compromises in the deal.

Nov 29 2005 | Vietnam | Report
 Highlight: : Although the traditional retail sector still dominates the 
 retail food sector, Vietnam&apos;s retail industry continues its 
 steady transition away from the traditional trade to modern 
 trade including modern mini-marts, supermarkets, hypermarkets 
 and superstores. Modern trade has grown tremendously in the last 
 six years and continues to show strong potential for further 
 development. Some big foreign retail chains have closely studied 
 this market sector for their future investment. Local importers 
 will continue to play a major role in introduction, 
 distribution, and promotion of imported food products in 
 Vietnam. Best prospects for U.S. food products are apples, 
 grapes, grocery snack foods (potato chips), dairy products, 
 frozen potato and packaged foods i.e. canned food, sauces. 
 Further growth and sophistication of the retail sector will 
 create additional opportunities for U.S food exporters. VM5076 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

 of fresh oranges for 2005/06 is estimated at 571 TMT, as above 
 average seasonal conditions following years of drought led to a 
 sharp increase in production. Orange juice imports in 2005/06 
 are estimated at 40,000, up sharply on a surge in imports from 
 Brazil which now accounts for 95 percent of Australias import 
 supply. In October 2005, Australia announced an import protocol 
 with China which covers all major commercial varieties of citrus 
 fruit, including oranges, mandarins, lemons and grapefruit. AS5042

 Highlight: Colombian imports of coffee are expected to increase to 400,000 
 60 kg bags in 2004/05 as less low quality local coffee is 
 available for local consumption. Colombias coffee production 
 reached 11.9 million (60 Kg bags) at the end of marketing year 
 2004/05 and is expected to be 11.55 million (60 kg bags) during 
 year 2005/06. Exports reached 11.03 and will likely remain at 
 that level. With the U.S. as an active ICO member, Colombia 
 expects other countries such as Canada, Russia and China to 
 become members. In the free trade agreement currently being 
 negotiated between the U.S. and Colombia, the Colombian industry 
 is seeking recognition of Colombian coffee as a distinctive 
 regional denomination and is requesting immediate duty reduction

Nov 23 2005 | Nigeria | Annual 
 Highlight: The GON signed the Common ECOWAS Tariffs (CET) agreement 
 requiring it to fully phase out all bans and reduce Nigeria&apos;s 
 existing 20 different tariff categories into five, by 2007. 
 Nigeria&apos;s HVP imports are expected to increase if the agreement 
 is carried out. Meanwhile, the spate of GON bans on a number of 
 HVP items, has apparently led to significant drops in Nigeria&apos;s 
 HVP imports. Industry projection of imported HVP by end of 
 CY2005 is $290 million, about eight percent drop compared to 
 $315 in CY2004. Although the GON threat to enforce HVP import 
 ban at the supermarkets are deterring the sector&apos;s growth, 
 smaller retail outlets in the more predominant convenience and 
 traditional sector have continued to increase in number. Nigeria 
 will continue to depend on imported HVP for sometime due to its 
 weak domestic food processing sector and rising demand for 
 processed foods. NI5023 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Nov 21 2005 | Greece | Annual 
 Highlight: In 2004 and 2005, U.S. genetics accounted for almost 70% of the 
 total planted seed for all crops. Opportunities continue to 
 exist for increased imports of seed of corn, durum wheat, 
 alfalfa and other forage plants, tomato and some grass seed 
 blends. Crop restructuring under the new CAP reform and new 
 opportunities for biofuel crops are likely to affect seed trade 
 and the demand for imports. Imports of corn seed and cottonseed 
 continue to be down from the 2002 level due to testing by the 
 government of Greece for the adventitious presence of biotech in 
 conventional seeds. While this testing threatens seed imports, 
 because of low tolerance levels, to date no shipments have been 
 denied entry. GR5030 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

 Nov 17 2005 | Chile | Annual 
 Highlight: In Chile there are no food warehouse outlets or 
 wholesale clubs. Most of the products sold through 
 US-style mass merchandisers are sold in the larger 
 supermarkets and hypermarkets in Chile. Exporters of 
 specialty food items with lower volumes usually go 
 through importers, while the large supermarket groups 
 (D&amp;S and Cencosud) have the infrastructure to import 
 directly, but generally only do so in limited 
 quantities. The supermarket industry is constantly 
 looking for new products to satisfy upscale consumer 
 demand. According to interviews with supermarkets and 
 suppliers, among the best prospects are snack foods, 
 including high energy nutritional snacks for sports, 
 frozen prepared dinner entrees and frozen bread 
 products, dairy products, fresh and frozen, such as 
 yogurt and specialty drinks, processed meats, dietetic 
 snacks and candies, baked goods and mixes, sweets, gums

Nov 17 2005 | Thailand | Non-Alcoholic Beverage Report 
 Highlight: The non-alcoholic beverage beverage market in Thailand has 
 significant growth potential because of present low per capita 
 consumption. Additionally, due to an expansion in the number of&quot;off- sale&quot;outlets such as convenience stores and hypermarkets, 
 non-alcoholic beverages are available to a larger portion of the 
 population. It is a competitive market where many companies use 
 agressive advertising to gain market share. The two fastest 
 growing sectors are Green Tea and milk. Growth in these areas is 
 driven partially by the augmented health consciousness of Thai 
 consumers.

 value even though they decreased by 4% in volume. Vietnam&apos;s 
 2005/06 coffee crop is expected to drop by 15% to 740 tmt due to 
 unfavorable weather in key coffee growing areas causing low 
 coffee yield. Coffee prices for both domestic and export markets

 production is expected to remain relatively unchanged at about 
 0.18 million MT, Oranges at 1.13 million MT, while grapefruit is 
 expected at 0.25 million MT, a 6% decrease from 2004 because of 
 a drought in several production regions.

Nov 9 2005 | Japan | Semi-Annual Report 
 Highlight: Post expects Japans beef consumption to fall by 8% in 2004 due 
 largely to Japans import ban on U.S. beef, which has resulted 
 in very tight supplies, high prices, and depletion of stocks. 
 Assuming Japan lifts its ban on U.S. beef by early summer, total 
 imports are expected to fall by 17% to 685,000 MT. Imports from 
 the U.S. are expected down by about half from last year, while 
 imports from Australia and New Zealand are expected rise 
 substantially. The U.S. beef ban is expected to strengthen 2004 
 pork consumption, which is projected up by 3%. Imports of U.S. 
 Pork are expected to increase by about 2% to 357,000 MT in 2004. JA4032

Nov 9 2005 | Japan | Annual Report 
 Highlight: Japans beef supply situation expected to remain tight in 2005, 
 assuming the ban on U.S. beef continues. Imports from Australia 
 and New Zealand are expected to increase in 2005, but the supply 
 shortfall will remain. Domestic production is anticipated to 
 rise by 1% due to strong demand and increased numbers of animals 
 at slaughter age. Pork consumption expected to remain strong in 
 2005 at 2.473 million MT, supported by the absence of U.S. beef, 
 and ongoing bans on poultry from China and Thailand. Pork 
 imports are expected to ease however due to high stocks. Imports 
 from the United States are forecast to increase slightly due to 
 solid demand for chilled pork in the food service industry. JA4073

Nov 9 2005 | Japan | Semiannual Report 
 Highlight: Assuming the ban on U.S. beef remains, Japan&apos;s beef supply 
 deficit and high market prices are expected to continue in 2005, 
 with consumption and imports dropping slightly. Beef consumption 
 plunged by nearly 15% in 2004 while imports were about 25% 
 lower, reflecting the year-long ban on U.S. beef. Australia&apos;s 
 import share climbed to 90% as Japanese companies expanded their 
 grain-fed operations in Australia during the year. Japan&apos;s pork 
 market is expected to ease slightly in 2005 following record 
 consumption and import levels in 2004, largely due to the ban on 
 U.S. beef, and bans on broiler meat from China and Thailand. 
 Japan&apos;s imports of U.S. pork in 2005 are expected to remain 
 relatively unchanged from the record level (393,000 MT) in 2004.

Nov 9 2005 | Japan | Annual Report 
 Highlight: The continued lack of U.S. and Canadian beef will extend the 
 supply deficit in Japan&apos;s beef market into 2006. Despite efforts 
 made by Australia to boost their supplies of grain fed beef, 
 acute shortage of specific cuts remains -especially those needed 
 for beef bowls and yakiniku. The beef SG will remain a major 
 trade concern in 2006. After an expanding market with high pork 
 consumption and import levels, the situation is forecast to cool 
 in 2005 - 2006 with less chances of triggering the pork 
 safeguard in JFY 2006. JA5053

 Update 
 Highlight: South Africa&apos;s 2005/06-summer rainfall season arrived late this 
 year, but planting has started. The big question is how much 
 land will be planted. Grain SA still recommends not planting at 
 all but farmers are likely to disregard this advice. If the area 
 planted on commercial farms is cut back to 2.4 million hectares 
 the crop could still reach 7.5 million tons. The current, FAS 
 2004, crop on commercial farms is officially estimated at 12.2 
 million tons and unofficially at 11.4 million tons. Even if the 
 official estimate is decreased, the oversupply situation will 
 persist. SF5038

Nov 8 2005 | Taiwan | 2005 
 Highlight: Globalization is a distinguishing characteristic of Taiwan&apos;s 
 food retail market. Foreign operators, including Carrefour, 
 Wellcome, Auchan, Costco, and Geant continue to dominate 
 Taiwan&apos;s food retail market. Fierce competition among these 
 retail stores continues. Mergers and strategic alliances will 
 continue to take place over the next few years. Liberalization 
 of the Taiwan market resulting from Taiwan&apos;s accession to the 
 WTO in 2002 has provided opportunities for food product imports. 
 Many food retail chains are expanding direct or indirect imports 
 of new-to-market items. It is advisable for U.S. suppliers to 
 contact these retail chains directly. TW5045

 Communities&apos; proposed remedy, consisting of a new MFN (most 
 favored nations) tariff rate on bananas of 187 per metric ton, 
 and a 775,000 mt tariff quota on imports of bananas of ACP

 Highlight: Turkey is expecting normal produciton of citrus in MY 2005. 
 Production and consumption are increasing parallel to the 
 increased demand both from a growing population and tourism 
 sector. Compared to MY 2004, Turkey is projected to export 
 higher quantities of grapefruits but lower quantities of lemons 
 and tangerines. Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Saudi Arabia are 
 major importers of Turkish citrus crops. The citrus processing 
 sector is not significant in Turkey.

Oct 31 2005 | Korea, Republic of | Annual 
 Highlight: In 2004, Korea was the fifth largest market for U.S. fishery 
 products. In 2005, imports are expected to increase another 10 
 percent to $2.5 billion. Although imports from the U.S. 
 decreased about 6 percent from 2003, they are expected to 
 rebound by 10 percent in 2005 to $140 million. Korea has a trade 
 deficit in seafood and this trend is only expected to increase 
 in the future. Korea remains an important market for U.S. 
 seafood suppliers, given Koreas high per capita consumption. KS5057

 MMT for FY2004/05. Carry-over stock level at the end of the 
 September increased to 1.4 MMT reflecting the increase in CPO 
 output for September. Stronger overseas demand at the beginning 
 of the month influenced the average local CPO price to increase 
 to RM1,458 (US$386)/MT in October, 2005. Preliminary official PO 
 exports rose from 1.17 MMT in August to 1.2 MMT in September. MY5045

 Highlight: Total citrus production is forecast at the same level as last 
 year but fresh orange exports are forecast to increase because 
 of anticipated better quality this year. The anticipated 
 increase of late orange varieties export will have to be taken 
 with caution since the weather during the winter and early 
 spring can still affect production significantly. After the 
 closing of the sole concentrate producer, FRUMAT, Morocco became 
 a net importer of juice and concentrate and is likely to remain

 Supplements 
 Highlight: The food supplement market in France in 2004 is valued at 
 approximately 759 million Euros ($942 million), a 16 percent 
 increase, compared to 2003. Although this is an increasingly 
 active sector in France, it is modest compared to the total 
 European market ($19 billion), and the world market ($56 
 billion). The best prospects are for plant extracts, vitamins, 
 herbal teas, dietetic meal substitutes, fat blockets, laxative 
 food supplements and many innovative products offering high 
 quality and attractive packaging. In 2002, the European Union (EU) 
 issued a Directive to EU Member States to harmonize regulation 
 of food supplements. To date, France is still in the process of 
 transcribing this directive, which should be finalized by the 
 end of this year. FR5073 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 
 
Oct 27 2005 | Mexico | Annual 
 Highlight: Mexico&apos;s imports of solid wood products are expected to increase 
 slightly in MY 2006. The major factors contributing to this 
 growth are: a positive outlook of the Mexican economy in CY 2006 
 with higher demand from the construction and furniture sectors, 
 as well as the shortcomings in domestic production. The strong 
 economy and tight domestic supplies will guarantee Mexico&apos;s 
 continued reliance on solid wood imports to meet domestic demand 
 in MY 2006. The main challenge for U.S. wood exporters, however, 
 will be to remain competitive with third countries in the

Oct 25 2005 | France | French Canned Sweet Corn 
 Affected by Competition with Thai Products 
 Highlight: France is the world&apos;s second largest producer of sweet corn 
 after the United States. French canned sweet corn production 
 accounts for more than half of the EU-25 production (Hungary 
 ranks second.) Approximately 70 percent of French canned sweet 
 corn production is exported, mainly to European markets. French 
 canned products face stiff price competition with Thai products 
 which are sold at low prices in Europe at discount supermarkets. 
 The European organization of sweet corn processors, including 
 French processors, is considering an anti-dumping complaint 
 against Thai practices to the European Commission, as France has 
 lost market share in the UK and Russian markets to Thai 
 products. France is a mature market for canned sweet corn. As a 
 result of the French supermarket practice to avoid any food 
 products labeled as derived from biotech, U.S. sweet corn is 
 disappearing from the French market. FR5071 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 
 
Oct 25 2005 | Hong Kong | Exporter Guide

 consecutive years of growth. Expectations for an erosion in 
 consumer purchasing power as well as higher fuel costs hinder 
 prospects for continued growth in 2006. Nonetheless, Indonesia 
 will remain an important market for U.S. milk solids, with

Oct 25 2005 | Japan | Annual 
 Highlight: Fresh strawberries, with a market value of approximately $2 
 billion, have the highest valued sales of all fresh fruit in 
 Japan, according to Tokyo traders. However, Japan&apos;s strawberry 
 production volume has been on a declining trend due largely to 
 labor shortages in some regions. The United States is the leader 
 in Japan&apos;s imported fresh strawberry market, supplying 
 approximately 4,000 metric tons annually. This accounts for 
 approximately 96 percent of Japan&apos;s imports. China supplies a 
 large volume of frozen strawberries to Japan, accounting for 64 
 percent of the nation&apos;s frozen strawberry sales. U.S. frozen 
 strawberries have a good reputation for their high quality in

 Highlight: Domestic milk production is seen to increase this year due 
 mainly to the continued infusion of imported and local dairy 
 animals by the National Dairy Authority through its Herd 
 Build-up Program. Imports of dairy products are expected to 
 continue to rise as domestic production only supplies about one 
 percent of the growing Philippine dairy requirements. Main 
 country suppliers include New Zealand (42 percent), Australia 
 (26 percent), United States (10 percent) and Thailand (7 
 percent). Exports of processed dairy products, particularly of

 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
 regarding sturgeon species. This resolution was passed in 
 response to CITES concerns about the rapidly declining world 
 sturgeon population, especially in the Caspian Basin, and 
 reflects an attempt by the Russian government to re-establish a 
 monopoly over sturgeon fishing and caviar sales. Exporters of 
 sturgeon products and caviar to Russia should be aware that 
 these regulations create an import license regime for caviar 
 that may add an additional step or process to Russia&apos;s import 
 procedures. RS5073 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Oct 21 2005 | Argentina | Annual 
 Highlight: Argentine milk production and dairy exports in 2006 are forecast 
 at a record high. Good prices at the farm and processing level, 
 as result of a firm domestic and foreign demand, will result in 
 good profitability. The structural changes in the world dairy 
 market are encouraging local processors to be very optimistic 
 about their future. Production is expected to expand 4-5 percent 
 annually in the next few years and will more than offset a 
 higher domestic demand. Growing exports will focus on whole dry 
 milk and cheese. AR5032

 Highlight: China&apos;s dairy industry for 2006 is forecast to continue 
 expanding, but the pace of growth will slow due to higher 
 production costs and slowed dairy product consumption. Cow milk 
 production for 2006 is forecast to increase 20 percent to 33.8 
 MMT, while non-fat dry production is forecast to decrease 8 
 percent to 55,000 MT. A new policy effective on October 15 
 requiring only pure raw milk be used for pasteurized milk may 
 result in reduced imports of milk powder. China&apos;s whey imports 
 are forecast to continue increasing in 2006 due to strong 
 domestic demand and limited domestic production. The U.S. will 
 remain the largest whey supplier to China. CH5075

 Highlight: Post forecasts Ghana&apos;s cocoa production in MY 2005/06 is 565,000 
 MT, up from 545,000 MT in MY 2004/05. In 2003/04, Ghana cocoa 
 exports reached a record high of 720,000 MT, the highest ever 
 achieved in the sector. The domestic processors are operating 
 below capacity due to the narrow margin between farm gate prices 
 and world market prices. GH5003 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 
 
Oct 18 2005 | Hungary | Annual 
 Highlight: Hungary is a middle-income country with a developed and 
 export-oriented food-processing sector. Hungarys GDP growth 
 rose from about 3 percent in 2003 to roughly 4 percent in 2004. 
 Hungarys accession to the EU in May 2004 began a new chapter 
 for the countrys food trade. Import tariffs for major U.S. 
 products exported to Hungary decreased, and the administrative 
 process for distributing products became simpler. The Hungarian 
 food distribution system has changed drastically in the past six 
 years with hypermarkets and shopping centers developing quickly. 
 Hungarian consumers are becoming more quality conscious, and 
 market segmentation is creating new opportunities for high 
 quality U.S. foods and beverages. Tourism is a leading industry, 
 and hotels and restaurants are demanding higher quality foods. HU5013

Oct 17 2005 | Argentina | Semi-Annual 
 Highlight: The Argentine fresh deciduous fruit crop for Calendar Year (CY) 
 2005 is estimated at 1.94 million metric tons (MT), 33 percent 
 higher with respect to CY 2004, due to improved agricultural 
 practices. Exports of fresh apples and pears are expected to 
 increase by 20 percent, due to greater supply. The strength of 
 the dollar against the Argentine peso is expected to continue to 
 discourage imports. Domestic consumption of fresh pears and 
 apples is estimated to increase to levels close to those of CY 
 2003. Concentrated apple juice (CAJ) production and exports are 
 expected to surpass CY 2004 levels, as more fruit will be 
 available for this sector this year. AR5025

Oct 17 2005 | Korea, Republic of | Update of Trade and 
 Production 
 Highlight: In MY 2004/05, the United States maintained its position as the 
 major supplier of grass and forage seeds in the Korean market 
 with a market share of 58 percent (on a quantity basis). U.S. 
 market share was down 6 percent from the previous year. Dairy 
 herd contraction suggests less pasture requirements and a 
 potential weakening in future import demand for grass and forage 
 seeds. Nevertheless, U.S. rye seed exports to Korea are expected 
 remain robust on the basis of government support for green 
 manure crops authorized through 2010. KS5050 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Oct 17 2005 | Russian Federation | Annual Report - 
 Russia Fruit Imports Soar 
 Highlight: As Russian consumers preferences change towards a healthier 
 lifestyle, as GDP quickly rises, and without a significant 
 increase in domestic production, fruit imports will continue to 
 grow. According to GTIs World Trade Atlas, in 2002, Russia 
 imported 2.4 million tons, in 2003 3.2 million tons, in 2004 
 3.74 million tons of fruit, growing more than 15 percent each 
 year. Fruit trade value in 2004 reached a record $1.6 billion, 
 40 percent more than in 2003. Russia is the world&apos;s largest 
 importer of fresh fruit among the emerging markets, and is 
 ranked sixth globally in fruit imports behind only the 
 wealthiest nations, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, 
 Japan, and Canada. Lack of marketing and brand awareness in the 
 fruit industry will benefit exporters to Russia who are willing 
 to start advertisement activities in Russian stores and grocery 
 markets. While U.S. exports to Russia of fresh fruit are quite 
 small, at current growth rates, with aggressive marketing, it 
 may become a top-ten market in 2006. U.S. fresh fruit companies 
 and trade associations are exhibiting at World Food Moscow in 
 September 2005. www.eng.usda.ru RS5307 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 
 
Oct 14 2005 | Bulgaria | Supermarkets Expansion in 
 Bulgaria 
 Highlight: Economic growth and change of consumer demand in Bulgaria have 
 allured big supermarkets chains. They are replacing traditional 
 food retail outlets and dramatically transformed existing food 
 supply chains. Supermarkets have triggered an upstream 
 transformation of the marketing system and have become major 
 buyers of local and import products. Retailers are adding upward 
 pressure to improve product quality and food safety in the 
 domestic market. BU5014 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 
 
Oct 14 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of | Chongqing: 
 An Underdeveloped Market in China&apos;s Interior 
 Highlight: Sitting on the Yangtze River deep in China&apos;s interior, Chongqing 
 remains a largely undeveloped market for imported foods. 
 Processed and high value products dominate among food imports, 
 with the exception of soybeans, which are now imported directly 
 to feed a nascent soy crushing industry. The vast majority of 
 food imports arrive indirectly via coastal cities, from whence 
 they are shipped primarily to Chongqing&apos;s growing population of 
 5-star hotels. US producers considering Chongqing as a potential 
 market should be careful to account for fragmented logistics and 
 distribution, as well as the needs of high-end international 
 hotels, into account. CH5818 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Oct 14 2005 | Italy | Annual 
 Highlight: The downward trend in Italian strawberry production has been 
 confirmed in 2005 and will likely continue in 2006, due mainly 
 to the reduction in planted area. As in past years, imports in 
 2004 (mainly from Spain) were larger than exports. This 
 situation is expected to continue in the near future.

 Highlight: With per capita income of over $4,700, a middle and upper class 
 making up 61 percent of the population, and 5-6 percent GDP 
 growth for 2005-2006, Malaysia shows good potential for growth 
 as a market for consumer high value products. According to US 
 Bureau of the Census Trade Data, exports of consumer-oriented 
 products to Malaysia increased from $74 million in 1999 to $205 
 million in 2004. The Malaysian food and beverage market is 
 becoming increasingly sophisticated and tariffs are low for most 
 imported products. New retail outlets, which are good venues for 
 imported products, are continuing to open, thereby providing 
 better access to consumers. Best product prospects include fresh 
 fruits and vegetables, pet foods, halal poultry meat, nuts, 
 frozen potatoes and wine. MY5041 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

 international demand. MX5092 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version 

 Oct 13 2005 | EU-25 | Reaction in the EU to advances 
 made in Doha WTO Talks 
 Highlight: At the beginning of the week, both the EU and US presented new 
 proposals for the Doha WTO Talks, to liberalize agricultural 
 tariffs, domestic support and export subsidies. Both the French 
 Minister of Agriculture (supported by a further 12 Member 
 States) and COPA, the EU farms union organization, are keen to 
 see the EU scale back ambition, i.e. limit EU concessions. 
 Agriculture Commissioner Fisher-Boel has been quick to dismiss 
 the criticisms of the Commissions approach but could find her 
 room for maneuver limited in coming months by key Member States 
 such as France. NGO Oxfam have warned of the dangers to the Doha 
 Round if even the Commission&apos;s limited proposals are overturned 
 by internal EU opposition. E35189

 volume was a record high of 730,000 MT, which fetched $7.2 
 billion from cocoa export sales, the highest ever achieved in 
 the sector. The domestic processors are operating below capacity 
 due to the narrow margin between farm gate prices and world 
 market prices. GH5003

 trade deficit with the United States. The main product exported 
 by the United States to France is corn for sowing. The French 
 planting seed industry, which favors biotechnology, has been 
 affected in the past few years by the destruction of many 
 biotech test plots by opponents to biotechnology, and the EU 
 Commission delay of the regulation process to set thresholds for 
 the adventitious biotech presence in planting seeds. In 
 addition, French planting seed farmers need to adapt to the

 Highlight: The MY05/06 sugar output forecast has been revised downward 
 slightly to 10.5 MMT (raw value) from Posts previous forecast 
 of 10.9 MMT as a result of drought damage to the cane in some 
 minor producing provinces. Despite the growth for food 
 processing and beverage sectors in recent years, growth in sugar 
 consumption in MY04/05 has been flat and is forecast to grow 
 slowly in MY05/06. Starch-based sweeteners are cheaper to 
 produce than sugar; therefore, they remain more 
 price-competitive than sugar. Industry sources estimate that 
 starch sweeteners output in 2005 will be equivalent to 1.8 MMT 
 of sugar usage in the food processing and beverage sectors. Post

Oct 7 2005 | Pakistan | Semi Annual Report 
 Highlight: The MY05/06 sugar output forecast has been revised downward 
 slightly to 10.5 MMT (raw value) from Posts previous forecast 
 of 10.9 MMT as a result of drought damage to the cane in some 
 minor producing provinces. Despite the growth for food 
 processing and beverage sectors in recent years, growth in sugar 
 consumption in MY04/05 has been flat and is forecast to grow 
 slowly in MY05/06. Starch-based sweeteners are cheaper to 
 produce than sugar; therefore, they remain more 
 price-competitive than sugar. Industry sources estimate that 
 starch sweeteners output in 2005 will be equivalent to 1.8 MMT 
 of sugar usage in the food processing and beverage sectors. Post 
 s MY05/06 import forecast is unchanged from Aprils forecast of 
 1.3 MMT. PK5016

Oct 6 2005 | France | Annual 
 Highlight: France is a major consumer of seafood products and a net 
 importer of many seafood products. In 2004, the best export 
 opportunities for U.S. seafood were Alaska pollack fillets, 
 surimi base, salmon, lobster, and scallops. In 2004, salmon 
 remained French consumers&apos; preferred fish. U.S. salmon exports 
 to France in 2004 were favored by the U.S. dollar/euro exchange 
 rate and a French media campaign against farm-raised European 
 salmon. The U.S. market share of groundfish fillet products 
 increased from 7 percent to 9 percent in 2004 and the potential 
 for continued growth remains positive. The United States was 
 France&apos;s largest supplier of live lobster in 2004 ahead of 
 Canadian lobster. The United States has become a major supplier 
 of scallops to France and this trend continues in 2005. France 
 is the largest market for surimi in Europe and the United States 
 is France&apos;s leading supplier of surimi base. FR5065 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

 Reference Prices of Edible Oils 
 Highlight: Effective September 30, 2005, the Government of India (GOI) 
 revised edible oil tariff values upwards marginally to reflect 
 international prices. Trade sources say that although this 
 revision, within two weeks from the previous change, is unlikely 
 to affect domestic edible oil prices, frequent changes in tariff 
 values are likely to result in unhealthy speculation in the 
 domestic edible oil market.

Oct 6 2005 | Indonesia | Annual 
 Highlight: U.S. high-value agricultural exports to Indonesia reached a 
 record $145 million in 2004 and are on pace to surmount that 
 record in 2005, with the value reaching $103 million in the 
 first 7 months of 2005. Prospects for further economic growth 
 plus the rapid expansion of the modern supermarket sector and 
 the food service industry are expected to continue to boost 
 demand for imported products. Vast opportunities exist for U.S. 
 food exporters in Indonesia, but potential entrants must 
 establish personal contacts and be aware of import regulations. 
 U.S. dairy products are becoming an increasingly important 
 export. Other major high-value exports include fresh fruit,

 the fresh vegetable market and a 43 percent market share in 
 fresh fruit; . However, the U.S. has a 99 percent market share 
 in oranges and an 85 percent market share in fresh cherries. The 
 well-being or healthy food trend is growing as incomes increase 
 and consumers demand larger quantities and greater varieties of 
 fresh produce. Eating out has also become a major trend and fast 
 food and family style restaurants are increasingly preparing 
 dishes with a variety of fresh vegetables. Korea is 
 self-sufficient in almost all produce; however, local production 
 declines slightly every year and imports are likely to continue 
 growing.

 Highlight: Renewed economic growth through 2003/2004 provided new growth 
 opportunities for U.S. exports of food and beverages. WTO trade 
 liberalization and consumer demand for novelty and variety have, 
 however, created a highly competitive environment for U.S. 
 exporters. This puts a strong emphasis on innovative product 
 development, superior marketing skills, and a trend towards high 
 value niche product markets. Continued development of 
 large-scale retail outlets and up-market food service, typified 
 by the new Taipei 101 complex, will favor high added value and 
 specialty products.

Sep 29 2005 | Korea, Republic of | Annual 
 Highlight: In 2004, Korea was the fifth largest market for U.S. 
 agricultural products. Total imports of agricultural products 
 were $14.7 billion and for 2005, are estimated to reach $15.5 
 billion. Korea imports about 60-70 percent of its agricultural 
 needs. The overall performance of the domestic economy is 
 slowing under the weakening pace of export growth and the rising 
 value of the Koran won; however, Korea is the world&apos;s 11th 
 largest economy, the 9th largest exporter and the 13th largest 
 importing country. The demand for products, such as frozen 
 vegetables, sauce preparations, and confectionery items is 
 growing as the domestic processing industry lacks the ability to 
 supply these items. Increasing affluence and greater demand from 
 consumers for high quality, low cost, healthy and convenient 
 foods equates to good opportunities for U.S. suppliers. KS5049 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Sep 29 2005 | Romania | September Update 
 Highlight: Unrelenting rains since April 2005 have drowned out a 
 substantial share of Romanias grain and oilseed production, 
 significantly shrinking the export surplus of the country. 
 Ministry of Agricultures early assessment of quality was that 
 70 percent of the total wheat production is of milling grade, 
 although industry representatives report that the excessive 
 moisture developed high sprouting in over 60 percent of the 
 wheat crop, which makes it fall outside the local milling grade 
 range. We see therefore opportunities for some 100-150 thousand 
 MT of US hard red winter wheat later in the season, albeit 
 currently, the domestic price doesn&apos;t allow any imports (the 
 cheapest alternative is Russian/Ukrainian wheat at $165 
 delivered, incl. 25 percent import duty). EU can export 
 duty-free wheat to Romania within the 125,000 MT TRQ and it is 
 expected that Hungary, a traditional source already, will use a 
 good portion of the quota. RO5007

Sep 29 2005 | Ukraine | Annual 
 Highlight: In March 2005, Ukraine eliminated tax privileges associated with 
 the Free Economic Zones resulting in a precipitous increase in 
 real import duties for poultry. This created a significant 
 obstacle for U.S. producers and jeopardized plans for further 
 expansion of legal exports for 2005 and 2006. The market 
 situation for U.S. suppliers is compounded because import duties 
 for chicken parts are significantly higher than for whole 
 chickens. Supported by considerable financial injections and 
 high domestic poultry prices, Ukrainian poultry producers will 
 continue to increase output in 2006. However, the domestic 
 industry will be unable to satisfy domestic demand and imports 
 (both legal and illegal) will persist. UP5015 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Sep 28 2005 | Taiwan | Annual 
 Highlight: MY2004 was yet again a difficult year for US suppliers. While 
 continuing to comprise a plurality of Taiwan apple imports and 
 to consistently earn the highest marks for taste and quality 
 from domestic consumers, codling moth detections shut US 
 suppliers out of the market for four crucial months (Dec &apos;04 - 
 April &apos;05). However, the fact that the US retained a 42% market 
 share (49K mt) despite the 4 month hiatus, speaks well for 
 continuing US competitiveness and prospects in the market. Given 
 reasonable prices and access to market sales through the season, 
 US apples should regain their&quot;normal&quot;post-WTO market share of 
 50%+. Expanding market share through 60% is possible given 
 thoughtful and well-organized US industry efforts to cultivate 
 and maintain relationships with the Taiwan trade. TW5034 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

 sanitary status, the opening of new markets, and strong foreign 
 demand for beef are creating more opportunities for the local 
 industry which is very optimistic about its future. Production 
 for 2006 is expected to remain stagnant. AR5027

 imports remain unchanged. However, stocks were revised upward to 
 2.4 MMT as the government has not indicated the strategy that it 
 would follow concerning sugar stocks. Domestic consumption was

 MMT in 2004/05 is within reach. Carry-over stock level at the 
 end of the August increased to 1.3 MMT reflecting the increase 
 in CPO output for August. Stronger overseas demend influenced 
 the average local CPO price to increase to RM1,379 (US$366)/MT 
 in September, 2005. Preliminary official PO exports rose from 
 1.1 MMT in July to 1.2 MMT in August.  MY5038 | View the Acrobat version | Download the MS Word version

Sep 22 2005 | Austria | Annual 
 Highlight: In 2004, the Austrian economy grew faster than the Eurozone 
 average and Germany with annual economic growth reaching 2.4%. 
 Current low interest rates and income and corporate tax cuts 
 support private spending growth. The food sector grew by 19.5 % 
 from 2000 to 2005 to total 11.6 billion Euro ($ 14.2 billion). 
 History, consumer acceptance, and governmental support have 
 transformed Austria&apos;s organic foods sector from a niche market 
 to a market segment of considerable importance. The trend 
 towards convenience food and ready-to-eat meals will continue. 
 Seafood, dried fruits, nuts, organics, wine, and gourmet foods 
 offer the best U.S. export opportunities.

Sep 22 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of | Annual 
 Report 
 Highlight: During July 2005, China announced that 52 U.S. facilities are 
 approved to export bovine semen and embryos, though the December 
 2003 import suspension remains on U.S. beef, live cattle and 
 other beef products. USDA is coordinating an October visit to 
 the U.S. by a Chinese expert team to further study the BSE 
 situation and beef safety. China&apos;s beef production in 2006 is 
 forecast to increase 6.4 percent to 7.6 MMT, and pork production 
 will increase 4 percent to 50.9 MMT. Effective on July 1, 2005, 
 China will no longer issue import quarantine permits for 
 processing meats, and export plants in all other countries, 
 except the U.S., must be audited and registered. However, meat 
 from approved plants in these other countries will now directly 
 compete with U.S. products in China&apos;s retail meat market. The 
 pre-inspection in Hong Kong for transshipped meat to China will 
 also lead to a higher volume of direct shipments to China.

 estimate for the German 2005 winter rapeseed crop at 5.0 
 million MT compared to the previous estimate of 4.6 million 
 MT, and last years result of 5.2 million MT. This above 
 average crop is due to little winterkill, combined with 
 favorable growing conditions in late spring and summer. As a 
 result, yields are estimated to remain above average in the 
 second year in a row, albeit 8 percent below the record 
 yields of 2004. The increase in area amounts to 4.4 percent. GM5033  |  View

 are searching for alternatives while Korean cattle and swine 
 producers are enjoying firm prices. Hanwoo beef producers 
 reacted by increasing cattle inventories. Strong pork prices 
 combined with constraints to expansion of swine inventories 
 are expected to lead to continued robust imports of pork in 
 2006. Government policy toward beef and pork production is 
 increasingly emphasizing quality, safety and providing 
 information to consumers. KS5045  |  View

 the largest supplier of apples to the Mexican market in 
 2005/06. MY 2005/06 pear production is forecast at 30,000 
 MT. U.S. pear imports are expected to increase as domestic 
 production stagnates and consumer demand remains strong.

 years as increased output from national rehabilitation 
 efforts and new coffee production areas begin to be 
 realized. Without any significant increases in domestic 
 coffee production, imports of coffee beans are likely to 
 remain high as coffee consumption continues to rise. Vietnam 
 supplied over 94 percent of all coffee bean imports in 2004. 
 Exports of coffee, particularly instant soluble coffee, will 
 continue to climb.

 large quantities of deciduous fruits, but exports only a 
 small amount. This is primarily because Turkey does not 
 produce the varieties international markets demand. Turkey 
 does not support exports, but imposes a 60.3 percent duty on

 pears, but is increasingly reliant on imports for year round 
 supply. Year-on-year imports of apples and pears increased 
 by 6 percent and 13 percent respectively in MY2004. The U.S. 
 is the fourth largest supplier of apples to the UK market, 
 with red and organic fruit popular with traders and 
 consumers alike. However, the UK market remains very 
 competitive, with domestic production competing against EU 
 crops and southern hemisphere fruit early in the marketing 
 season. UK5021  |  View

   Highlight: Venezuela remains a significant importer of 
 agricultural products, with total imports reaching $2.1 
 billion in 2004. The United States is still the largest 
 supplier, with product sales totaling $386 million in 2004. 
 Due to the currency devaluation in recent years and some 
 internal governmental policies, Venezuela has shifted from 
 being a rapidly growing purchaser of high-value food 
 products to focusing more on imports of basic grains and 
 items for further processing.   VE5017  |  View

Sep 2 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of  |  Annual 
 Report   
   Highlight: During July 2005, China announced that 52 
 U.S. facilities are approved to export bovine semen and 
 embryos, though the December 2003 import suspension remains 
 on U.S. beef, live cattle and other beef products. USDA is 
 coordinating an October visit to the U.S. by a Chinese 
 expert team to further study the BSE situation and beef 
 safety. China&apos;s beef production in 2006 is forecast to 
 increase 6 percent to 7 MMT, and pork production will 
 increase 4 percent to 50 MMT. Effective on July 1, 2005, 
 China will not longer issue import quarantine permits for 
 processing meats, and export plants in all other countries, 
 except the U.S., must be audited and registered. However, 
 meat from approved plants in these other countries will now 
 directly compete with U.S. products in China&apos;s retail meat 
 market. The pre-inspection in Hong Kong for transshipped 
 meat to China will also lead to a higher volume of direct 
 shipments to China. CH5063  |  View

Sep 2 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of  |  Annual 
 Report   
   Highlight: China&apos;s broiler slaughter during 2006 is 
 forecast at 7.7 billion birds, a 3 percent increase from the 
 estimated 7.5 billion birds in 2005, due to a recovery in 
 domestic demand following the 2004 avian influenza 
 outbreaks. Though the U.S. is still the top supplier of 
 imported poultry products, Brazil and Argentina reduced the 
 U.S. market share from 96% in 2003 to only 46% in 2005. A 
 pre-inspection requirement for transshipped products and the 
 cancellation of processing permits continues to shift 
 poultry trade away from Hong Kong and toward Mainland 
 Chinese ports. China&apos;s broiler meat exports in 2006 are 
 forecast at 360,000 MT, a 20-percent increase from the 
 estimated 300,000 MT in 2005. Expanding cooked poultry 
 exports will continue to be China&apos;s export priority due to 
 the challenges it faces shipping fresh and frozen product. CH5064  |  View

   Highlight: In 2005, the industry has largely recovered 
 with the lower feed prices and freight charges. The 
 de-pegging of the Malaysian ringgit (to the U.S. dollar) in 
 July will also assist in reducing the cost of raw material 
 imports. In 2006, growth is likely to slow somewhat in line 
 with a slower pace of economic growth and rising production 
 costs. However, if Malaysia is successful in opening new 
 overseas markets for chilled/frozen or processed product, 
 the domestic broiler industry would be able to respond.

   Highlight: Austria is one of the leading opponents of 
 agricultural biotechnology within the European Union. 
 Austria has fully implemented EU regulations on 
 biotechnology. However, no single biotech crop is approved 
 by Austria, and three national ordinances still effectively 
 prevent the planting of EU-approved biotech crops. In 
 addition, five of the nine Federal States have passed 
 biotechnology precautionary bills to protect their organic 
 and small-scale agricultural sector. The Austrian Government 
 is working on coexistence guidelines for biotech, 
 conventional, and organic crop production. Responding to 
 consumers anti-biotech attitudes and NGOs anti-biotech 
 lobbying, the Austrian retail sector agreed to refrain from 
 stocking or selling biotech foods. Presently only biotech 
 feed (soybean meal) can be found in the Austrian market. AU5012  |  View

Aug 30 2005 | Canada  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Canada was the third largest producer of 
 biotechnology crops in 2004. Roughly 77% of the Canada&apos;s 
 canola crop was herbicide tolerant. The acreage sown to 
 genetically modified corn and soybeans continues to increase 
 in Ontario and Quebec. The development and approval of 
 biotech crops comes from the efforts of many companies, 
 universities and governments. The regulatory system for 
 approval of biotech crops in Canada is science-based. It can 
 take upwards 10 plus years from the development phase to the 
 approval of a biotech crop in Canada. There have been 
 arguments put forward to modify the regulatory system to 
 include market acceptance, but the Government of Canada 
 continues to maintain its regulatory system will be based on 
 science. The ongoing investment of money and resources into 
 the development of new biotech crops in Canada clearly 
 indicates that the biotech industry is strong and will 
 continue to flourish. CA5044  |  View

Aug 30 2005 | El Salvador  |  Annual   
   Highlight: At this time the only law that specifically

 to carry a phytosanitary certificate with an additional 
 declaration from the country of origin stating that the 
 seeds do not contain Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). 
 The Environment Law, effective 5/98, provides guidance on 
 assessing the environmental impact of GMOs. There is no 
 regulatory process in place for approving products of 
 agricultural biotechnology for import or sale, although El 
 Salvador ratified the Cartagena Protocol in 12/03. Through a 
 project financed by the Global Environment Fund (GEF), the 
 Government of El Salvador (GOES) has developed a proposal 
 for a Special Ruling for the Safe Use of GMO&apos;s that is 
 currently under public review before being presented to the 
 National Assembly for approval and ratification.

 agricultural biotechnology, most importantly regulations 
 covering traceability and labeling. In France, a majority of 
 imported products that are labeled&quot;biotech&quot;is soybeans and 
 soybean meal from the United States, Brazil and Argentina. 
 There are almost no food products labeled as derived from 
 biotech available on the market. This is partly due to 
 general hostility and pressure against agricultural 
 biotechnology driven by anti-biotech activists, supermarket 
 chains, and consumer organizations. Pro-biotech voices are 
 timid, and come mainly from the planting seeds industry, the 
 crop protection industry, and public research centers. FR5051  |  View

Aug 30 2005 | Germany  |  Annual   
   Highlight: The research, production and consumption of 
 plants and plant products resulting from genetic 
 modification of crops are controversial issues in Germany. 
 However, Germany is one of the few countries in the EU where 
 a limited number of hectares (300 ha) are planted to GMO 
 corn. The regulatory framework for GMOs is predominantly set 
 by EU regulations and directives, which in their current 
 form are generally supported by the majority of German 
 politicians. The recently finalized first and major portion 
 of the German genetech law addresses co-existence and 
 liability. The industry and trade regard these national 
 rules as a hinderance to the development and use of green 
 biotechnology. Possible federal elections in September 2005 
 provide the opportunity that a new coalition government 
 might ease the overly strict liability and co-existence 
 rules into a more practical form. GM5027  |  View

Aug 30 2005 | Mexico  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Mexico has no significant trade barriers to 
 biotech crops or foods derived from biotechnology. However, 
 as the center-of-origin for corn and because of the historic 
 and cultural significance of corn in Mexico, the 
 biotechnology debate in Mexico has centered around 
 biodiversity and corn as a national patrimony which must be 
 safeguarded against transgenic introgression. Nevertheless, 
 as a ratifier of the Cartagena Protocol on Biodiversity (CPB) 
 and a member of NAFTA, Mexico has steered a unique course in 
 successfully balancing the competing demands of biodiversity 
 and trade. Due to the passage of a framework biosafety bill 
 in February 2005, which put Mexico in line with its CPB 
 obligations, the Government of Mexico (GOM) must now put 
 into place implementing regulations - a process which will 
 help unify and shore up the current fragmented nature of its 
 biotech regulations.   MX5061  |  View

   Highlight: Pakistan at present is not producing any 
 biotech crops. Biosafety guidelines and rules were enacted 
 in April 2005 and the preparation of a national policy and 
 action plan is in process. Eight strains of locally 
 developed in-vitro GM cotton are being developed that may be 
 commercially released in 2-3 years. GM soybeans and soybean 
 oil is imported to Pakistan and Imported GM corn seed and BT 
 cottonseed may find a market in Pakistan in light of the 
 recently passed biosafety guidelines. Pakistan has signed 
 the Biosafety Protocol but it is not yet ratified. There are 
 no biotechnology related trade barriers between U.S. and 
 Pakistan and trade should continue without any hindrances 
 for the foreseeable future.   PK5009  |  View

   Highlight: Although the EC accepted MON 810 corn for 
 planting, in a move designed to protect Poland&apos;s reputation 
 as a&quot;natural&quot;agricultural producer, the Government of 
 Poland introduced a two-year moratorium on planting 
 Genetically Modified (GM) products in Poland. Poland&apos;s 
 restrictions on all non-pharmaceutical GM products are a 
 major non-tariff trade barrier. Legislation specifying the 
 requirements for coexistence of GM cultivations with 
 conventional and organic crops was rejected by Parliament in

 Local subsidiaries of seed companies have committed to GOR 
 regulators, to meet or in some cases exceed Romanias 
 regulatory requirements, in order to maintain their position 
 on the Romanian market. Given the pressure from the EU, and 
 Romanias weakened bargaining position, this compliance may

 a year of suspension of all activities in the field of 
 biotechnology regulation, in May 2005 Russia re-established 
 the Interagency Commission for Genetic Engineering. Two 
 fundamental technical regulations on biotech plants and 
 foodstuff are in the process of development to be made 
 federal laws in 2006. At present Russia does not produce 
 biotechnology crops. Registration of imported biotech crops 
 for food has restarted, but registration for feeds is still

 biotechnology is based on Andean Community regulations and 
 other international treaties. Recently, the President of 
 Venezuela stated that no biotech plantings would be allowed. 
 This statement may lead to changes in the existing legal 
 framework. The Venezuelan legislation does not clearly 
 prohibit plantings of biotech crops. In addition, the Seed 
 Law emphasizes the need for conducting analysis before 
 introducing and marketing biotech products. In reality, the 
 regulatory system is imprecise. VE5014  |  View

 Report   
   Highlight: Bosnia and Herzegovinas (BiH) anti-biotech 
 position is growing day by day, and now some imported U.S. 
 food products are being tested for biotech content and 
 rejected. BiH lacks detailed regulations for the import and 
 marketing of biotech foods, and since November 2004 the 
 import of biotech products has been forbidden. Knowledge 
 about biotechnology is poor even among scientists and 
 agricultural officials. Agriculturists and non-government 
 organizations that promote organic agriculture oppose 
 biotech applications and encourage producers, consumers and 
 regulators to reject biotech products. In 2004, the media 
 and consumer groups criticized BiH authorities for not 
 better controlling imported foods for biotech content and 
 for approving the import of biotech commodities from the 
 U.S. under the food aid program. BK5006  |  View

Aug 18 2005 | Canada  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Canada was the third largest producer of 
 biotechnology crops in 2004. Roughly 77% of the Canada&apos;s 
 canola crop was herbicide tolerant. The acreage sown to 
 genetically modified corn and soybeans continues to increase 
 in Ontario and Quebec. The development and approval of 
 biotech crops comes from the efforts of many companies, 
 universities and governments. The regulatory system for 
 approval of biotech crops in Canada is science-based. It can 
 take upwards 10 plus years from the development phase to the 
 approval of a biotech crop in Canada. There have been 
 arguments put forward to modify the regulatory system to 
 include market acceptance, but the Government of Canada 
 continues to maintain its regulatory system will be based on 
 science. The ongoing investment of money and resources into 
 the development of new biotech crops in Canada clearly 
 indicates that the biotech industry is strong and will 
 continue to flourish. CA5044  |  View

   Highlight: The Czech Republic, as a member of the EU, 
 follows the EUs legislative framework for biotechnology. 
 Act 78/2004 replaced the first Act on GMO 153/2000. The 
 Ministry of Environment is the competent authority for 
 handling biotech product notifications, and the Ministry of 
 Agriculture is responsible for notifications of biotech food 
 and feed. The Czech Republic ratified the Cartagena Protocol 
 on Biosafety in October 2001. This year about 300 hectares 
 of Bt corn (MON 810) is being grown in the Czech Republic 
 for the first time. The Czech Republics coexistence rules 
 require isolation distances and notifications to the 
 Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment. 
 When voting on biotech approvals at various levels in the EU, 
 the Czech Republic takes a case-by-case approach and bases 
 its decision on scientific evidence. EZ5010  |  View

   Highlight: Hungarys biotechnology policy for feed corn 
 production, corn seed production, and soybean product 
 (soybean meal) imports negatively impacts U.S. exports to 
 Hungary. Field corn and seed corn production (about one 
 fifth of the EUs corn crop) is dominated by American 
 varieties. Four corn varieties passed the evaluation process 
 and are waiting approval, two others are still under field 
 trials. In January 2005, the GOH imposed a moratorium on the 
 varieties of the MON 810 corn event. Legal and technical 
 debates about the moratorium and coexistence regulation (in 
 preparation) may hamper the commercialization of 
 biotechnology crop varieties in Hungary over the next few 
 years. HU5008  |  View

 largest importers of US agricultural biotechnology products 
 from the U.S., has approved 61 biotech events for food, 38 
 for feed and 50 for planting. Japan does not produce any 
 biotech products commercially but does have several products 
 under development. Japan ratified the Biosafety Protocol in 
 November 2003 and has implemented mandatory biotech labeling 
 on certain foods containing biotech derived ingredients. In 
 general, biotech products are not well received by the

   Highlight: The MY 2005/06 cotton harvest is forecast at 
 1.89 Million Metric Tons (MMT) - a significant decrease from 
 the previous year production of 2.48 MMT. Progressive 
 textile mills are focusing on producing better-quality

   Highlight: Report Highlights: More favorable weather 
 conditions are expected to bring a substantial production 
 increase for almonds this year. Hazelnut output, on the 
 contrary, is anticipated lower than last year, due to tree 
 alternation. Production of pistachios is expected much 
 higher than two years ago. Very high prices of both shelled 
 almonds and hazelnuts are slightly reducing imports from 
 California and Turkey, respectively. California almonds both 
 shelled and now also in-shell, are still the major share of 
 domestic supplies. The new Common Agricultural Policy for 
 the tree nut sector is granting generous subsidies to 
 growers, paid by both the EU and the national government.   IT5028  |  View

Aug 3 2005 | Serbia and Montenegro  |  Update   
   Highlight: The new wheat crop in Serbia is projected to 
 be 1.5 million MT, 45 percent lower than last year. 
 Reduction is mostly due to late planting of seeds, adverse 
 weather conditions and heavy rains that hampered wheat 
 harvest. Together with the wheat stocks from last year&apos;s 
 crop of 500,000 MT, production should be sufficient for 
 domestic needs. Serbia, however, would probably have to 
 import around 100,000 MT of high quality wheat to improve 
 the low baking quality of the stocks. In mid-July, the 
 government reversed its year-old policy of no intervention 
 in wheat production crop and announced several measures to 
 help registered wheat farmers via production and storage 
 subsidies. SR5007  |  View

Aug 2 2005 | Australia  |  Agricultural Biotechnology 
 Annual Report   
   Highlight: The United States has substantial interest in 
 Australias policies and regulatory framework regarding 
 agricultural biotechnology and products derived thereof. 
 Unprocessed (whole) biotech corn and soybeans have not 
 received regulatory approval in Australia and, thus, cannot 
 be imported without further processing. Foods with biotech 
 content must receive prior approval and be labeled if 
 biotech content is more than 0.1%. This requirement can 
 restrict sales of U.S. intermediate and processed products. 
 Australias policies and views on this technology influence 
 other countries in the region, and elsewhere, which may 
 follow Australias lead in developing a regulatory system of 
 their own.

 in international standards and regulations, such as CODEX, 
 OIE, and the SPS Agreement. Although rules are written in 
 consistency with WTO regulations, weak institutions, lack of 
 resources, and inefficiency provides for import processes to 
 be long and cumbersome. Many regulations allow for 
 interpretation and discretionary decisions by authorities 
 that are usually political appointees and lack technical

 U.S. Companies Getting Ready   
   Highlight: Monsanto and Pioneer, the two U.S. companies 
 conducting open-field testing of biotech crops in France in 
 2005, have taken measures to protect their fields. As a 
 result of the April threat by anti biotech activists to 
 destroy such plots, both companies met with the chief 
 advisors for the French Ministries of Justice, Interior and 
 Agriculture, and claim they received strong and clear 
 support. In addition, local secret services, prefets, and

Aug 2 2005 | Hong Kong  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Hong Kong currently has no regulatory 
 legislation related to agricultural biotechnology and does 
 not produce or grow biotech corps in field trials. Biotech 
 foods are not distinguished from conventional foods and are 
 subject to the same food regulations. Hong Kong is in the 
 process of drafting legal framework to implement the 
 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. However, it has not set any 
 timetable for its ratification for full implementation of 
 the new legislation to comply with the Protocol. The 
 foreseeable impact is that U.S. exports to Hong Kong in the 
 future if containing LMOs may be obligated to meet all 
 documentation requirements. In 2004, U.S. exported $1.09 
 billion of agricultural and food products to Hong Kong and 
 $6.87 million of which may have contained LMOs. HK5018  |  View

 Biotechnology Report   
   Highlight: Despite Government support for biotechnology 
 amounting to over $ 700 million in 2005, it is still 
 difficult to find any products labeled as&quot;GM Food&quot;on 
 Korean shelves. Korea is expected to ratify the Cartagena 
 Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) before March 2006. After 
 implementation of the CPB, sales and imports of 
 biotechnology crops that have not completed environmental 
 risk assessments will not be allowed. In contrast to the 3 
 percent adventitious presence level maintained for regular 
 food, Korea maintains a zero-tolerance policy for 
 inadvertent presence of GM content in organic processed 
 products.

 genetic modification continues to be a sensitive subject 
 that evokes strong emotional responses. Genetically modified 
 plants and animals are not commercially grown in New Zealand 
 at present. However, a number of contained research trials 
 involving genetically modified organisms are occurring and 
 food products with GM content are legally offered for sale 
 and consumption, following prior approval. New Zealand 
 continues to play an important role internationally in

 conditions. To meet rising consumer demand, more imports 
 will be necessary. The removal of a taxation anomaly on 
 soybean meal by giving it zero rated sales tax status may 
 increase commercial imports of soybeans in the country. Ghee 
 remains popular and demand for palm oil should remain 
 strong. U.S. concession programs, not used for a few years, 
 are increasing import of U.S. soybeans and related products 
 into the country. PK5010  |  View

 appear to center on issues related to food safety and based 
 on the concept of substantial equivalence. Singapore is 
 prepared to allow imported genetically modified products 
 provided they are in compliance with international safety 
 standards established by organizations like Codex and 
 provided they are approved by the national regulatory 
 authorities in their countries of origin.

Aug 2 2005 | South Africa, Republic of  |  Voluntary   
   Highlight: Imports of fish and seafood products from the 
 United States have increased for the past two years due to 
 the appreciation in the value of the rand and decreased 
 local catches. Domestic demand for seafood has risen, and 
 many consumers are looking to seafood as a healthy source of 
 protein. In FY2004 South Africa saw a $3 million increase in 
 imports from the US from $1.7 million in 2003 to $4.5 
 million in 2004. Categories which have shown the most growth 
 from 2003 to 2004 are: other seafood (0307) from $20,922 to 
 $870,533; prepared or preserved fish from $761,980 to $1.6 
 million; frozen fish from $633,833 to $1.3 million; and fish 
 fillets from $39,780 to $551,403. Canned salmon imports have 
 shown consistent growth for the past five years, and this 
 increase is expected to continue. The Unites States enjoys a

   Highlight: Taiwan has a fairly rational regulatory 
 environment for products derived from biotechnology. The 
 Department of Health (DOH) is the lead agency in granting 
 approval to biotech products intended for food use while the 
 Council of Agriculture (COA) regulates events intended for 
 agricultural use as well as environmental release. Taiwan is 
 still in the process of developing its regulatory system for 
 biotech products. The largest threat to biotech exports is 
 the slow approval process for new-to-market biotech

Aug 2 2005 | Thailand  |  Agricultural Biotechnology   
   Highlight: Despite its world-class research capacities 
 on biotechnology, Thailand is still very far from adopting 
 agricultural biotechnology for commercial cultivation. There 
 is no clear-cut policy on the future of agricultural 
 biotechnology research and development, and field trials on 
 transgenic plants are banned. This lack of development is 
 mainly because of an absence of policy leadership by 
 politicians, nods to threats by anti-GMO non-government 
 organizations (NGOs), the fear of losing food export 
 markets, and the fear of foreigners monopolizing benefits 
 from GMO seed sales and property right claims.

   Highlight: Pakistan&apos;s production of oilseed, meal and 
 oil are all expected to decrease due to late crop sowing, 
 constraints in acquiring quality hybrid seed and bad weather 
 conditions. To meet rising consumer demand, more imports 
 will be necessary. The removal of a taxation anomaly on 
 soybean meal by giving it zero rated sales tax status may 
 increase commercial imports of soybeans in the country. Ghee 
 remains popular and demand for palm oil should remain 
 strong. U.S. concession programs, not used for a few years, 
 are increasing import of U.S. soybeans and related products 
 into the country. PK5010  |  View

Aug 1 2005 | South Africa, Republic of  |  Monthly 
 Update   
   Highlight: South Africa&apos;s current corn crop planted in 
 2004 is now estimated at 12.4 million tons, the biggest crop 
 in years. This is mainly due to a remarkable increase in 
 yields over the past few seasons. The record yields led to 
 serious oversupply and a price collapse. The lower prices 
 again stimulated exports, which are now expected to reach 
 2.3 million tons this season. Even exports at this level 
 will not affect the oversupply and farmers will have to cut 
 back the area to be planted later this year. The area 
 planted to wheat also decreased this year, which means that 
 the high level of imports will continue. The import tariff 
 on wheat was recently set at 2%. SF5027  |  View

 exercise and a Regulatory Impact Assessment on its proposed 
 nutrition labeling scheme, the government modified their 
 proposal and recently announced several changes. Phase I of 
 the revised proposal begins with a 2-year grace period after 
 actual enactment of the legislation. U.S. products carrying 
 nutrient-related claims will need to provide Hong Kong 
 nutrition labeling on prepackaged food products. Phase II 
 will start two years after the implementation of phase one 
 and will require that all prepackaged food products meet 
 mandatory labeling on prescribed nutrients. All U.S. 
 products will need to modify labeling information in order 
 to meet Hong Kong&apos;s new requirements before they can sell to 
 Hong Kong. HK5020  |  View

 Jul 29 2005 | Malaysia  |  Update 
 (July)   
   Highlight: Malaysia&apos;s 
 crude palm oil (CPO) production dropped 7.1 percent to 1.2 
 MMT in June 2005 due to the trees undergoing biological 
 stress. Post revised CPO production to 15.2 MMT in 2004/05 
 and 15.5 MMT in 2005/06 to reflect a better-than-expected 
 improvement in yields. Carry-over stock level at the end of 
 the June eased to 1.2 MMT reflecting the drop in CPO output 
 for the month but is expected to rise in the Jul-Sep 
 quarter. The average local CPO price hovered above the 
 US$368 level until the upward revaluation of the Malaysian 
 ringgit on Jul 21 when prices in ringgit terms fell a few 
 notches. In the longer term, the revaluation will have 
 lesser impact on local prices since supply and overseas 
 demand for PO are more important factors.  MY5033  |  View

 Jul 28 2005 | France  |  Update   
   Highlight: In 2004, 
 French walnut production increased to 26,290 MT, following 
 the short crop of 2003 due to severe drought. Although there 
 is no estimate yet available for 2005 harvest, France is 
 facing another year of severe drought conditions, which is 
 likely to have a negative impact on production. Partial 
 trade data for MY 2004/05 indicate an increase in French 
 exports of in-shell walnuts (principally to Germany) and a 
 decline in French imports of shelled walnuts (mainly from 
 Moldova, where French walnuts are exported to be shelled). 
 U.S. exports to France of in-shell walnuts declined 
 significantly in MY 04/05, as a result of the increased 
 domestic production. FR5052  |  View

Jul 28 2005 | Spain  |  Biotechnology Coexistence 
 Update   
   Highlight: After 
 eight years of incident-free biotechnology self-regulation 
 (coexistence), Spanish farmers will now experience 
 Government-regulated coexistence. This politically necessary 
 approach will not improve the spotless record of&quot;security&quot;in biotechnology seed use, nor dissuade its cultivation in 
 corn borer infected regions of Spain. It will mean 
 unnecessary expense for everyone from the national and 
 autonomous regional governments to the farmers planting 
 biotechnology seeds, and will not likely placate any of the 
 activists regardless of their&quot;activist&quot;positions. (CM4SH8) SP5023  |  View

   Highlight: China&apos;s 
 Frozen French Fry (FFF) consumption is forecast to increase 
 20 percent annually in next few years driven by Quick 
 Service Restaurants (QSRs) rapid growth. China&apos;s domestic 
 FFF production is forecast to increase to 50,000 tons in

 production lines are expected to put into production in late 
 2005. FFF imports are forecast to increase 20 percent to 
 84,500 tons in MY05/06 driven by strong demand. The United 
 States is the largest FFF exporter to China, however, its 
 share is shrinking because of Canada&apos;s rapid expansion.

 Brief   
   Highlight: Imports of

 nevertheless, this trend did not continue in 2004. However, 
 lower EU external tariffs applied to U.S. products upon 
 Poland&apos;s 2004 EU accession should further stimulate imports 
 in the future. Projections indicate that wine consumption in 
 Poland will increase 10-15 percent within the next few 
 years. Competition in the wine industry is growing, with an 
 estimate of over 10,000 different brands on the market. The

   Highlight: China&apos;s 
 Frozen French Fry (FFF) consumption is forecast to increase 
 20 percent annually in next few years driven by Quick 
 Service Restaurants (QSRs) rapid growth. China&apos;s domestic 
 FFF production is forecast to increase to 50,000 tons in 
 MY05/06 from 35,000 tons in MY04/05 because two big 
 production lines are expected to put into production in late 
 2005. FFF imports are forecast to increase 20 percent to 
 84,500 tons in MY05/06 driven by strong demand. The United 
 States is the largest FFF exporter to China, however, its 
 share is shrinking because of Canada&apos;s rapid expansion.

 Jul 22 2005 | EU-25  |  EU 
 proposes radical sugar reform   
   Highlight: The 
 European Commission has published proposals to radically 
 alter the shape the EU&apos;s sugar regime. The proposals center 
 on a radical new quota buyback scheme, which would likely 
 see the end of EU sugar production in southern Europe, 
 eventually reducing sugar production in the EU by at least 
 one third. There are also price cuts of 40%, with beet 
 growers partially compensated through increased direct 
 payments. The Commission will likely face considerable 
 political opposition to the proposals. The Commission would 
 like to get the reforms formally approved by November, 
 though this target may be a little ambitious. E35143  |  View

Jul 20 2005 | EU-25  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Beef 
 production in the EU is decreasing in 2005. This results 
 from increases in the beef herd in the NMS that do not 
 offset EU-wide decreases in dairy herds, which result from 
 increased milk production per cow. While domestic 
 consumption is stable after recovering from the BSE scares, 
 the decrease in beef production leads to increased beef 
 imports, mainly from Brazil, and a decrease in exports. This 
 trend is forecast to continue in 2006. Pig slaughter and 
 pork production in the EU is reaching a low in 2005, mainly 
 in the EU-15 as most NMS are increasing production after 
 accession. This lower production results in a decrease in 
 domestic consumption as a consequence of high pork prices, 
 while pork exports to Japan and Russia are expected to 
 remain stable. As swine inventories are increasing again 
 across the EU, pork production is forecast to increase in 
 2006. This will presumably lead to an increase in 
 consumption and slightly higher exports.  E35141  |  View

Jul 20 2005 | EU-25  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Broiler 
 production in the EU is increasing in 2005, albeit at a 
 lower pace than domestic consumption. Consumption is 
 increasing more rapidly in the NMS than in the EU-15. With 
 stable export levels, this leaves room for increased 
 imports, which are mainly imported from South-America. 
 Imports from Thailand are hampered by the Avian Influenza 
 outbreak, although imports of cooked poultry meat are 
 increasing. The same trend is forecast to continue in 2006. 
 The European market for turkey meat is roughly behaving in 
 the same way, although turkey production is faltering in 
 2005 as a result of restructuring in some of the NMS. 
 However, turkey production, imports and consumption are all 
 forecast to increase again in 2006.  E35142  |  View

Jul 14 2005 | South Africa, Republic of  |  Annual 
 Report   
   Highlight: The 
 continued growth in GDP for over ten years has increased 
 South Africa&apos;s attraction as an investment and marketing 
 platform for the rest of Africa. In 2004, the U.S. exported 
 $192 million of agricultural, fish, and forestry products to 
 South Africa, a high since 1999 due in part to the 
 appreciation of the value of the rand versus the dollar. 
 2003 and 2004 wheat exports to South Africa were especially 
 high due to poor wheat crops in competing countries, a 
 newfound preference for U.S. hard red winter wheat, and a 
 favorable exchange rate. Intermediate agricultural products 
 such as planting seeds are important imports for South 
 Africa, and animal fats have shown consistent and 
 substantial growth over the past five years. A variety of 
 high-value products such as almonds, pistachios, canned 
 salmon, whiskey, and frozen food preparations have shown 
 consistent growth over the last five years and present 
 important opportunities for U.S. Exporters. SF5026  |  View

 stage for uninfected orchards, and chlorine dip surface 
 disinfection of fruit. The export inspection to confirm the 
 absence of fireblight on the fruit will remain in the 
 proposed revision, and in addition the export inspection 
 will now confirm the maturity of the fruit as well. MAFF 
 will also remove the import ban on fresh apples from

 years, especially in the bakery and snack food areas. 
 Foreign investment is greatest in the soft drink (including 
 water) and beer industries. Coca-Cola Co. invested in a 
 fruit juice production facility. Bulk commodities such as 
 wheat and sugar hold the major value of imports used in this 
 sector. There is demand for imported beverage bases 
 (especially, fruit juice concentrate, pre-mixes&amp;syrup), 
 ice cream pre-mixes, spices, flavors, and 
 nutrients/additives. Post will assist interested U.S. food

 Jul 6 2005 | Malaysia  |  Annual   
   Highlight: 2004 was a

 U.S. temperate hardwood lumber rose 55% and retained the 
 position as the top supplier. Imports of U.S. softwood 
 lumber also rose 17.5% although Finland overtook the U.S. as 
 the Number 1 supplier. The 2005 outlook for U.S. wood is 
 bright as the Malaysian furniture and flooring industries 
 set to further expand in the overseas market. The Malaysian 
 timber industry performed very well in 2004. Exports of logs 
 and lumber rose 1.2% and 2% respectively. Overall export 
 earnings from timber products chalked up an impressive 21% 
 growth. The 2005 outlook is optimistic with the industry 
 expecting a 10% growth in export earnings in 2005. On June 
 28 2005, Malaysia imposed a ban on exports of rubberwood to 
 assure supplies to the domestic furniture industry. 
 Previously, small amount of rubberwood were exported under 
 quota.

   Highlight: In 2005 
 area planted to sugar beets in Italy is expected to be 
 240,000 hectares, an increase of 30 percent over 2004 due 
 mainly to a shift from corn in the Po valley. Italy, 
 however, remains a deficit country for sugar, importing 
 significant quantities from northern Europe. The recent 
 Commission proposal for changes in support to the sugar 
 sector is seen by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and 
 producers as jeopardizing the survival of the Italian 
 refinery industry, as well as some of the sugar beet sector.

Jul 5 2005 | Japan  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Japan 
 produced 29,100 metric tons of fresh asparagus in 2004, in a 
 total growing area of 6,480 hectares. Domestic asparagus 
 supplied approximately 60 percent of the nation&apos;s total 
 demand and imports supplied the rest. According to industry 
 sources, cold spring weather delayed the 2005 Hokkaido 
 asparagus harvest, which took place in May and June. Japan 
 imported 1,162 metric tons of fresh U.S. asparagus in the 
 first four months of this year, down approximately 26 
 percent from last year. A decline in U.S. asparagus imports 
 was due to California&apos;s continuous rainfall this spring, 
 which resulted in higher export prices. China is currently a 
 minor player in Japan&apos;s fresh asparagus market, but its 
 exports to Japan are quickly expanding. JA5039  |  View

 dropped to 1.3 MMT reflecting an increase in PO exports 
 during the month of May. The average local CPO price dropped 
 from US$371/MT in May to US$370/MT in June as the strong 
 growth in CPO output during the first 5 months of CY2005 
 brought pressure on PO prices. PO exports also weakened in

 expanding faster than GDP as newly prosperous urban
 residents continue to spend disposable income on eating
 out. Young white-collar workers are developing a taste for

 growing sector. The high-end market is spreading beyond
 the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
 Distribution has become more efficient and professional in
 major cities, but remains problematic elsewhere. Education
 and training in the use of new products is needed all
 along the value chain. Competition from other nations and

 crop than was forecasted. About 50 percent of the 2004
 quota of 37,682 tons was allocated. The 2005 quota of
 37,933 tons was allocated in full, reflecting farmers&apos;
 optimism for better weather and improved crops. Meanwhile,
 imports of raw tobacco doubled in 2004, yet the production
 of cigarettes rose only by 6 percent.

 Update   
   Highlight: South
 Africa&apos;s 2004 corn crop now being harvested is estimated
 at 12.2 million tons, 25% bigger than the 2003 crop. This
 harvest, coupled with last year&apos;s carry over stocks,
 greatly increases the over supply. This abundance leads to
 low producer prices and farmers are unsure what to do when
 the new planting season starts in September. Wheat farmers
 have already decided to cut back the area planted to wheat
 this year. SF5022  |  View

 cotton exports into the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and

 marketing year (MY) 2005/06 (August/July), even though the
 local production will fall short of last year&apos;s output.
 The upside potential for U.S. exports will likely be
 eroded by a number of converging factors, which when
 combined, will substantively reduce cotton demand in the
 Iberian market. (LR30SH6).  SP5015  |  View

 upward revision in producing states other than Sao Paulo.
 The Sao Paulo and western Minas Gerais commercial areas
 should produce 320 MBx, unchanged from our previous
 report. Total FCOJ production for MY 2005/06 is forecast
 at 1.244 mmt, 65 Brix, down 14 percent relative to
 previous MY. FCOJ exports for MY 2005/06 are projected at
 1.254 mmt, 65 Brix, down 8 percent compared to MY 2004/05.

Jun 24 2005 | Greece  |  Voluntary   
   Highlight: Acreage
 planted to sugar beets in Greece has been about 45,000 HA
 on average over the past decade. This is on flat,
 irrigated land with potential for other crops once the EU
 sugar reform decoupling program commences. Candidates for
 these sugar-free fields are wheat or corn, or even
 sunflower assuming that this land is not locked into a
 conservation reserve. Greece is arid and rugged in most of
 its terrain, but the land now in sugar beets is by no
 means marginal. The GOGs other problem with sugar
 reform lies in finding alternative employment for
 processing plant workers. GR5019  |  View

 to reduce stocks. However, in subsequent years, we expect
 exports to tend lower as the processing industry adjusts
 to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and
 changes in market access resulting from trade agreements.

   Highlight: The record 
 harvest of 15 million MT of rapeseed in MY 2004/05 was a 
 boost for biodiesel production in the EU. For MY 2005/06 
 harvests are expected to be high but not as high as last 
 year. Soybean utilization is expected to remain stable. 
 Because of low crush margins, high crush prices compared to 
 South America and a bad market for the oil, importers are 
 turning to direct meal imports. Palm oil imports are 
 expected to increase sharply over the coming years. A low 
 price caused by tax exemptions on raw palm oil for Malaysian 
 companies in the EU makes palm oil very competitive on the 
 European market.

Jun 21 2005 | Philippines  |  Annual   
   Highlight: The 
 devastation brought about by mudslides in December 2004 has 
 forced the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural 
 Resources (DENR) to impose stricter logging and forest 
 products transport regulations. The disaster also resulted 
 in a review of existing forestry laws by the GRP. Pending 
 results of the review, tighter guidelines are expected to 
 govern local timber cutting and wood use. Because of this, 
 solid wood production is expected to contract through 2006, 
 providing positive prospects for increased U.S. wood 
 exports, in particular, for use by the local furniture and 
 interiors sectors.  RP5024  |  View

   Highlight: The CY 
 2005 crop is of lesser quality than the previous three crops 
 as a result of an excess of rain just before harvest. The 
 Argentine wine industry continues to grow locally and 
 internationally. Locally, more people are adopting the habit 
 of tasting and storing wines. Internationally, the Argentine 
 wineries and their wines are more and more known in the 
 world. Exports have increased every year. The typical 
 Argentine Malbec variety achieved export sales for US$48 
 million in CY (Calendar Year) 2004. Imports have been 
 negligible due to the high cost of imported product and the 
 inroads made by quality Argentine wines in domestic 
 consumption. AR5019  |  View

Jun 16 2005 | China, Peoples Republic of  |  Annual   
   Highlight: China&apos;s 
 export oriented asparagus industry remains strong and 
 presents a competitive threat to the U.S. despite weather 
 related production declines in 2005 that forced procurement 
 prices higher. During 2005, China is forecast to produce 
 400,000 metric tons of asparagus and export $100 million of 
 fresh and jarred/canned asparagus. Short-term effects of the 
 production decline are likely to result in less asparagus on 
 the domestic market and possibly some decreases in 
 individually, quick, frozen (IQF) asparagus exports. 
 Mid-term production increases are forecast as grower 
 management improves and plants age and begin producing more 
 commercially. Chinas asparagus consumption is forecast to 
 grow while future exports to the world remain flat, but 
 increase to the U.S. CH5045  |  View

 long-term trends for French tomato production are expected 
 to continue, with production for the fresh market on the 
 rise to almost 632,000 MT, and production for processing on 
 the decline, to approximately 200,000 MT. The decline in 
 supply of French raw material for processing has been 
 accelerated by the purchase of the leading French tomato 
 processing plant by the Chinese company Chalkis. Another 
 impact of such Chinese industrial investment in France is 
 growing imports of tomato paste from China. FR5043  |  View

 with sales of $216.6 million representing an increase of 33 
 percent over the previous year. Growing competition from 
 other foreign suppliers has created new challenges for U.S. 
 exporters. However, good sales opportunities exist due to 
 Philippine consumer familiarity with American brands and

 Biotechnology Report   
   Highlight: Since 
 1998, the EU has approved three biotech events in the face 
 of considerable member state (MS) resistance. About 30 
 events are in the pipeline still waiting approval. 
 Currently, marketing bans on EU-approved biotech events are 
 in effect in 6 MSs. On April 18, 2005 the Commission 
 introduced emergency inspection measures to identify the 
 presence of Bt10 corn in U.S. exports of corn gluten feed 
 and brewers grains to the EU. The debate on agricultural 
 biotechnology in the EU is highly politicized. Many of the 
 contentious issues now confronting the EU are not related to 
 human health and environmental safety. Over the last 6 years 
 the EU has implemented a comprehensive regulatory system to 
 guarantee that biotech products are fully evaluated to 
 ensure their safety. The EU and MSs remain deadlocked on the 
 search for seed labeling legislation to cover the 
 adventitious presence of biotech seed and coexistence 
 measures for biotech, conventional, and organic agriculture. E35091  |  View

 2000 to 2004, Croatias seafood imports increased 
 from $33 million to $71 million, a 114 percent 
 increase with the trend expected to continue. 
 Moreover, Croatia imports between $1 to 2 million of 
 seafood from the United States annually. Demand for 
 seafood is increasing, as Croatia becomes a more 
 popular tourist destination--making it an excellent 
 market for U.S. seafood exports.

   Highlight: A 
 larger and good quality wine production is expected 
 in 2005, with another expansion in exports. Wine 
 producers expect to increase foreign and domestic 
 sales as a result of a larger and good quality 
 production. An increased number of table grapes will 
 be used in wine production again in MY2005, as 
 wineries intend to increase total wine production to 
 reverse diminishing stocks. Industry sources have 
 indicated that once the new areas come into 
 production, wineries will have to invest in new 
 processing and storage facilities to absorb the 
 annual additional output. CI5011  |  View

 2005 | Australia  |  Annual   
   Highlight: Australian wine grape production is forecast at 
 1,829 TMT in 2005/06, up slightly from 2004/05. Dry 
 conditions and a decline in plantings will likely 
 constrain production somewhat. Wine production is 
 forecast at 12.8 million hectoliters (MHL) in 
 2005/06, also up slightly. Wine exports in 2005/06 
 are forecast at 7.6 MHL, up 14 percent. Changing 
 lifestyles and relatively strong economic growth 
 over the past decade have boosted domestic wine 
 consumption. Imports are small but growing. A 
 relatively strong Australian dollar has pressured 
 returns from wine exports.  AS5018  |  View

   Highlight: According 
 to a recently commissioned study, South Africa, although a 
 small supplier of agricultural commodities, can still be 
 seen as competitive within the global food market, 
 especially in fresh fruit and wines. However, S. Africa&apos;s 
 competitiveness is relatively low in other agricultural 
 products like sugar, maize, poultry, red meat and pork. Some 
 of the country&apos;s major fruit and wine competitors are 
 identified as United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, 
 Argentina, and China. Total annual agricultural supply is 
 expected to remain fairly stable because of limited 
 productive resources. The full study by Promar is available

 May 17, 2005 Canada Agricultural Situation Impending
 Election May Affect Canada&apos;s Ability to Comply With WTO Rulings CA5036 Voluntary Report - public distribution Ottawa
 Bill C-40, legislation designed to reform aspects of Canada&apos;s
 grain handling and distribution system, was introduced by the
 Government of Canada to fulfill the requirements of the WTO
 Dispute Settlement Body and bring Canada into compliance with
 its WTO obligations. The bill has been passed by the House of
 Commons and is now waiting to be passed by the Senate.
 Unfortunately for this piece of legislation, as well as many
 others, the longevity of Parliament is uncertain. If the
 government is defeated on a May 19th budget vote, all pending
 pieces of legislation will effectively die, including Bill -C40.
 This will make it virtually impossible for Canada to meet an
 agreed August 1, 2005 deadline for compliance with the WTO
 Appellate Body ruling. Since Bill C-40 was passed by the House
 with the full support of all Members of Parliament present, it
 is very likely that the bill will be reintroduced in the new
 session of Parliament, which would begin sitting in early fall.

 to the devastating hurricanes in the fall of 2004, Florida&apos;s
 grapefruit shipments to Japan were approximately 85,000 metric
 tons in the 2004/05 season, merely 40% of the level of the
 previous season. Floridas short crop created a strong demand
 for California, Arizona and Texas fruit and also extended to
 Israel Sweeties. In Japan, Florida grapefruit was trading at
 higher prices in Japan&apos;s both wholesale and retail markets. A
 short supply of grapefruit created higher demand for U.S.
 oranges in the Japanese market, resulting in a 12% increase in
 imports in the first five months of the season. Sales of U.S.
 Minneola, Cara Cara and Moro oranges were also strong, however
 higher prices for U.S. lemons slowed Japanese imports this
 season. [ Download

April 22, 2005 EU-25 Trade Policy Monitoring Least
 Favored Nation: Impact of EU Trade Agreements on US Agriculture E35076 Voluntary Report - public distribution Brussels USEU From
 a sample of the EU&apos;s free trade agreements, it would appear that
 they do not cover&quot;substantially all trade,&quot;especially when looking at the agricultural sector individually.
 While trade may have increased overall, the percentage of fully
 liberalized agricultural products is considerably less than
 those products that continue to incur some restriction to trade.
 The apparent impact of these agreements on the competitiveness
 of US exports is substantial. With the continuation of
 preferences being given to third countries the US stands to lose
 a considerable share in EU and third country markets. Combined
 with the expansion of the EU, liberalized trade between the EU
 and third countries will continue to grow and have an adverse
 effect on US producers. [ Download

 public distribution Seoul ATO Many local economists predict
 that Korean economic growth will slow further in 2005 as a

 March 1, 2005 Russian Federation Exporter Guide $11.3
 Billion Food and Agriculture Import Market RS4322 Required
 Report - public distribution Moscow ATO Russia&apos;s food and
 agriculture imports grew 14 percent last year, led by
 consumer-oriented products that grew 19 percent in 2003. The
 retail sector is in a building frenzy, with supermarket chains
 cloning themselves. Exporters wishing to introduce their
 products can find willing buyers, but promotion and commitment
 are needed. European competition is strong and entrenched.
 France will spend $1 million on wine promotions alone. Consumer
 surveys and importers suggest that Russia wants more U.S.
 products as quality and product diversity become more important.
 U.S. exporters are encouraged to discuss with State Departments
 of Agriculture, U.S. State and Regional Trade Groups, and the
 Foreign Agricultural Service, the promotional support available.

 pesticide use was perceived as more harmful than biotech food.
 On average, women rated biotech food as more harmful to health
 than compared to men. Respondents over 60 years of age rated
 biotech food as more harmful than compared to younger
 respondents. There was an interesting trend among respondents in
 regards to their education levels. As education levels

 In 2005, South Africa&apos;s total fresh deciduous fruit production
 is expected to reach 1.384 million MT, a slight decrease (1.3%)
 from last year because of a severe drought that affected some
 producing regions in the Western Cape in December 2004. Total
 exports are expected to decrease by 8.1% because of lower
 quality products for export. An increase of 9.9% is expected for
 processing, with table grapes encompassing the bulk of the
 fruit. Some table grapes farmers indicated that they would not
 export to the U.S. this season because of high shipping costs
 caused by a strong Rand. Sources indicate that there is also
 lots of inefficiency within the supply systems that cause
 pressure on the profit margins, not necessarily at the farm
 levels.

 unfailingly invoke consumer concerns and food scares (BSE
 and dioxin) to justify the EU&apos;s onerous regulatory
 system for biotech products. NGOs repeatedly assert that
 consumers distrust the safety of biotech food products
 and will not buy them. The EU views its all encompassing
 labeling and traceability regulations as critical to
 assuaging consumer concerns. Or so it seemed. But then
 in a change of heart, the Commission relented and
 exempted from labeling a number of products produced
 from genetically modified microorganisms, including
 vitamins. With sales estimated at nearly US$ 6 billion,
 Europe&apos;s vitamin and mineral supplement manufacturers
 were thus spared the fate of slapping a GM label on a

 2005 Agricultural Budget E35005 Voluntary Report
 - public distribution Brussels USEU The 2005 budget
 for the EU&apos;s Common Agricultural policy has been
 adopted. EUR 49.7 bn has been allocated, representing an
 increase of EUR 2.9 bn since 2004. This increase is
 mainly due to the impact of the 2003 CAP Reforms and
 2004 enlargement, adding roughly EUR 1.3 bn and EUR 1.4
 bn respectively to the budget. However, the total of EUR
 49.7 bn is EUR 777m less than the Commission&apos;s forecast
 needs, the cut being driven by Member State Finance
 Ministers. Over the coming months, budget shortfalls may
 need to be addressed for direct aid payments, tomatoes
 and possibly cereals.

 public distribution Warsaw Poland implemented a
 mixed CAP system upon its May 1, 2004 EU accession. A

 eligible agricultural sector financial support in 2004
 totaled $4.65 billion Euros (US$6.27 billion) of which
 57 percent is from EU funds and 43 percent from the

 combination of many new financial supports and fast
 rising market prices are stimulating Poland&apos;s

 January 4, 2005 Australia Product Brief Functional
 Food Sector AS4038 Required Report - public
 distribution Canberra The Australian retail food
 sector is the most promising sector for functional
 foods, with convenience stores and gas marts being
 important retail segments. These sectors attract the
 lifestyle consumer, who is more likely to experiment
 with new products and new ingredients. An increase in
 consumer demand and interest in functional foods during
 the 1990s has resulted in positive growth rates for the
 Australian functional food market over the period. The
 expected continuation of these trends should lead to
 continued growth in the Australian functional foods
 market over the short to medium term. Examples of
 functional foods and ingredients currently available in
 Australia include phytosterols, probiotics and fortified
 products containing increased levels of calcium,
 vitamins, folates and special performance drinks,
