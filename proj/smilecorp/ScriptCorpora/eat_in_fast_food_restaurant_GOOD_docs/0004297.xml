Tests Show Most Store Honey Isn&apos;t Honey

Ultra-filtering Removes Pollen, Hides Honey Origins
by Andrew Schneider | Nov 07, 2011


 


More than three-fourths of the honey sold in U.S. grocery stores isn&apos;t exactly what the bees produce, according to testing done exclusively for Food Safety News.

The results show that the pollen frequently has been filtered out of products labeled &quot;honey.&quot;
The removal of these microscopic particles from deep within a flower would make the nectar flunk the quality standards set by most of the world&apos;s food safety agencies.

The food safety divisions of the World Health Organization, the European Commission and dozens of others also have ruled that without pollen there is no way to determine whether the honey came from legitimate and safe sources.

In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration says that any product that&apos;s been ultra-filtered and no longer contains pollen isn&apos;t honey. However, the FDA isn&apos;t checking honey sold here to see if it contains pollen.

Ultra filtering is a high-tech procedure where honey is heated, sometimes watered down and then forced at high pressure through extremely small filters to remove pollen, which is the only foolproof sign identifying the source of the honey. It is a spin-off of a technique refined by the Chinese, who have illegally dumped tons of their honey - some containing illegal antibiotics - on the U.S. market for years.

Food Safety News decided to test honey sold in various outlets after its earlier investigation found U.S. groceries flooded with Indian honey banned in Europe as unsafe because of contamination with antibiotics, heavy metal and a total lack of pollen which prevented tracking its origin.

Food Safety News purchased more than 60 jars, jugs and plastic bears of honey in 10 states and the District of Columbia.

The contents were analyzed for pollen by Vaughn Bryant, a professor at Texas A&amp;M;University and one of the nation&apos;s premier melissopalynologists, or investigators of pollen in honey.

Bryant, who is director of the Palynology Research Laboratory, found that among the containers of honey provided by Food Safety News:

76 percent of samples bought at groceries had all the pollen removed, These were stores like TOP Food, Safeway, Giant Eagle, QFC, Kroger, Metro Market, Harris Teeter, A&amp;P;, Stop&amp;Shop and King Soopers.

100 percent of the honey sampled from drugstores like Walgreens, Rite-Aid and CVS Pharmacy had no pollen.

77 percent of the honey sampled from big box stores like Costco, Sam&apos;s Club, Walmart, Target and H-E-B had the pollen filtered out.

100 percent of the honey packaged in the small individual service portions from Smucker, McDonald&apos;s and KFC had the pollen removed.

Bryant found that every one of the samples Food Safety News bought at farmers markets, co-ops and &quot;natural&quot; stores like PCC and Trader Joe&apos;s had the full, anticipated, amount of pollen.

And if you have to buy at major grocery chains, the analysis found that your odds are somewhat better of getting honey that wasn&apos;t ultra-filtered if you buy brands labeled as organic. Out of seven samples tested, five (71 percent) were heavy with pollen. All of the organic honey was produced in Brazil, according to the labels.

The National Honey Board, a federal research and promotion organization under USDA oversight, says the bulk of foreign honey (at least 60 percent or more) is sold to the food industry for use in baked goods, beverages, sauces and processed foods. Food Safety News did not examine these products for this story.

Some U.S. honey packers didn&apos;t want to talk about how they process their merchandise.

One who did was Bob Olney, of Honey Tree Inc., in Michigan, who sells its Winnie the Pooh honey in Walmart stores. Bryant&apos;s analysis of the contents of the container made in Winnie&apos;s image found that the pollen had been removed.

Olney says that his honey came from suppliers in Montana, North Dakota and Alberta. &quot;It was filtered in processing because North American shoppers want their honey crystal clear,&quot; he said.

The packers of Silverbow Honey added: &quot;The grocery stores want processed honey as it lasts longer on the shelves.&quot;

However, most beekeepers say traditional filtering used by most will catch bee parts, wax, debris from the hives and other visible contaminants but will leave the pollen in place.

Ernie Groeb, the president and CEO of Groeb Farms Inc., which calls itself &quot;the world&apos;s largest packer of honey,&quot; says he makes no specific requirement to the pollen content of the 85 million pounds of honey his company buys.

Groeb sells retail under the Miller&apos;s brand and says he buys 100 percent pure honey, but does not &quot;specify nor do we require that the pollen be left in or be removed.&quot;

He says that there are many different filtering methods used by beekeepers and honey packers.

&quot;We buy basically what&apos;s considered raw honey. We trust good suppliers. That&apos;s what we rely on,&quot; said Groeb, whose headquarters is in Onstead, Mich.

 Why Remove the Pollen? 

Removal of all pollen from honey &quot;makes no sense&quot; and is completely contrary to marketing the highest quality product possible, Mark Jensen, president of the American Honey Producers Association, told Food Safety News.


&quot;I don&apos;t know of any U.S. producer that would want to do that. Elimination of all pollen can only be achieved by ultra-filtering and this filtration process does nothing but cost money and diminish the quality of the honey,&quot; Jensen said.

&quot;In my judgment, it is pretty safe to assume that any ultra-filtered honey on store shelves is Chinese honey and it&apos;s even safer to assume that it entered the country uninspected and in violation of federal law,&quot; he added.

Richard Adee, whose 80,000 hives in multiple states produce 7 million pounds of honey each year, told Food Safety News that &quot;honey has been valued by millions for centuries for its flavor and nutritional value and that is precisely what is completely removed by the ultra-filtration process.&quot;

&quot;There is only one reason to ultra-filter honey and there&apos;s nothing good about it,&quot; he says.

&quot;It&apos;s no secret to anyone in the business that the only reason all the pollen is filtered out is to hide where it initially came from and the fact is that in almost all cases, that is China,&quot; Adee added.

The Sioux Honey Association, who says it&apos;s America&apos;s largest supplier, declined repeated requests for comments on ultra-filtration, what Sue Bee does with its foreign honey and whether it&apos;s ultra-filtered when they buy it. The co-op markets retail under Sue Bee, Clover Maid, Aunt Sue, Natural Pure and many store brands.

Eric Wenger, director of quality services for Golden Heritage Foods, the nation&apos;s third largest packer, said his company takes every precaution not to buy laundered Chinese honey.

&quot;We are well aware of the tricks being used by some brokers to sell honey that originated in China and laundering it in a second country by filtering out the pollen and other adulterants,&quot; said Wenger, whose firm markets 55 million pounds of honey annually under its Busy Bee brand, store brands, club stores and food service.

&quot;The brokers know that if there&apos;s an absence of all pollen in the raw honey we won&apos;t buy it, we won&apos;t touch it, because without pollen we have no way to verify its origin.&quot;

He said his company uses &quot;extreme care&quot; including pollen analysis when purchasing foreign honey, especially from countries like India, Vietnam and others that have or have had &quot;business arrangements&quot; with Chinese honey producers.

Golden Heritage, Wenger said, then carefully removes all pollen from the raw honey when it&apos;s processed to extend shelf life, but says, &quot;as we see it, that is not ultra-filtration.

&quot;There is a significant difference between filtration, which is a standard industry practice intended to create a shelf-stable honey, and ultra-filtration, which is a deceptive, illegal, unethical practice.&quot;

Some of the foreign and state standards that are being instituted can be read to mean different things, Wenger said &quot;but the confusion can be eliminated and we can all be held to the same appropriate standards for quality if FDA finally establishes the standards we&apos;ve all wanted for so long.&quot;

Groeb says he has urged FDA to take action as he also &quot;totally supports a standard of Identity for honey. It will help everyone have common ground as to what pure honey truly is!&quot;

 What&apos;s Wrong With Chinese Honey? 

Chinese honey has long had a poor reputation in the U.S., where - in 2001 - the Federal Trade Commission imposed stiff import tariffs or taxes to stop the Chinese from flooding the marketplace with dirt-cheap, heavily subsidized honey, which was forcing American beekeepers out of business.

To avoid the dumping tariffs, the Chinese quickly began transshipping honey to several other countries, then laundering it by switching the color of the shipping drums, the documents and labels to indicate a bogus but tariff-free country of origin for the honey.

Most U.S. honey buyers knew about the Chinese actions because of the sudden availability of lower cost honey, and little was said.

The FDA -- either because of lack of interest or resources -- devoted little effort to inspecting imported honey. Nevertheless, the agency had occasionally either been told of, or had stumbled upon, Chinese honey contaminated with chloramphenicol and other illegal animal antibiotics which are dangerous, even fatal, to a very small percentage of the population.

Mostly, the adulteration went undetected. Sometimes FDA caught it.

In one instance 10 years ago, contaminated Chinese honey was shipped to Canada and then on to a warehouse in Houston where it was sold to jelly maker J.M. Smuckers and the national baker Sara Lee.

By the time the FDA said it realized the Chinese honey was tainted, Smuckers had sold 12,040 cases of individually packed honey to Ritz-Carlton Hotels and Sara Lee said it may have been used in a half-million loaves of bread that were on store shelves.

Eventually, some honey packers became worried about what they were pumping into the plastic bears and jars they were selling. They began using in-house or private labs to test for honey diluted with inexpensive high fructose corn syrup or 13 other illegal sweeteners or for the presence of illegal antibiotics. But even the most sophisticated of these tests would not pinpoint the geographic source of the honey.

Food scientists and honey specialists say pollen is the only foolproof fingerprint to a honey&apos;s source.

Federal investigators working on criminal indictments and a very few conscientious packers were willing to pay stiff fees to have the pollen in their honey analyzed for country of origin. That complex, multi-step analysis is done by fewer than five commercial laboratories in the world.

But, Customs and Justice Department investigators told Food Safety News that whenever U.S. food safety or criminal experts verify a method to identify potentially illegal honey - such as analyzing the pollen - the laundering operators find a way to thwart it, such as ultra-filtration.

The U.S. imported 208 million pounds of honey over the past 18 months. Almost 60 percent came from Asian countries - traditional laundering points for Chinese honey. This included 45 million pounds from India alone.

And websites still openly offer brokers who will illegally transship honey and scores of other tariff-protected goods from China to the U.S.

 FDA&apos;s Lack of Action 

The Food and Drug Administration weighed into the filtration issue years ago.

&quot;The FDA has sent a letter to industry stating that the FDA does not consider &apos;ultra-filtered&apos; honey to be honey,&quot; agency press officer Tamara Ward told Food Safety News.

She went on to explain: &quot;We have not halted any importation of honey because we have yet to detect &apos;ultra-filtered&apos; honey. If we do detect &apos;ultra-filtered&apos; honey we will refuse entry.&quot;

Many in the honey industry and some in FDA&apos;s import office say they doubt that FDA checks more than 5 percent of all foreign honey shipments.

For three months, the FDA promised Food Safety News to make its &quot;honey expert&quot; available to explain what that statement meant. It never happened. Further, the federal food safety authorities refused offers to examine Bryant&apos;s analysis and explain what it plans to do about the selling of honey it says is adulterated because of the removal of pollen, a key ingredient.

Major food safety standard-setting organizations such as the United Nations&apos; Codex Alimentarius, the European Union and the European Food Safety Authority say the intentional removal of pollen is dangerous because it eliminates the ability of consumers and law enforcement to determine the actual origin of the honey.

&quot;The removal of pollen will make the determination of botanical and geographic origin of honey impossible and circumvents the ability to trace and identify the actual source of the honey,&quot; says the European Union Directive on Honey.

The Codex commission&apos;s Standard for Honey, which sets principles for the international trade in food, has ruled that &quot;No pollen or constituent particular to honey may be removed except where this is unavoidable in the removal of foreign matter. . .&quot; It even suggested what size mesh to use (not smaller than 0.2mm or 200 micron) to filter out unwanted debris -- bits of wax and wood from the frames, and parts of bees -- but retain 95 percent of all the pollen.

Food Safety News asked Bryant to analyze foreign honey packaged in Italy, Hungary, Greece, Tasmania and New Zealand to try to get a feeling for whether the Codex standards for pollen were being heeded overseas. The samples from every country but Greece were loaded with various types and amounts of pollen. Honey from Greece had none.

 You&apos;ll Never Know 

In many cases, consumers would have an easier time deciphering state secrets than pinning down where the honey they&apos;re buying in groceries actually came from.

The majority of the honey that Bryant&apos;s analysis found to have no pollen was packaged as store brands by outside companies but carried a label unique to the food chain. For example, Giant Eagle has a ValuTime label on some of its honey. In Target it&apos;s called Market Pantry, Naturally Preferred and others. Walmart uses Great Value and Safeway just says Safeway. Wegmans also uses its own name.

Who actually bottled these store brands is often a mystery.

A noteworthy exception is Golden Heritage of Hillsboro, Kan. The company either puts its name or decipherable initials on the back of store brands it fills.

&quot;We&apos;re never bashful about discussing the products we put out&quot; said Wenger, the company&apos;s quality director. &quot;We want people to know who to contact if they have questions.&quot;

The big grocery chains were no help in identifying the sources of the honey they package in their store brands.

For example, when Food Safety News was hunting the source of nine samples that came back as ultra-filtered from QFC, Fred Myer and King Sooper, the various customer service numbers all led to representatives of Kroger, which owns them all. The replies were identical: &quot;We can&apos;t release that information. It is proprietary.&quot;


One of the customer service representatives said the contact address on two of the honeys being questioned was in Sioux City, Iowa, which is where Sioux Bee&apos;s corporate office is located.

Jessica Carlson, a public relations person for Target, waved the proprietary banner and also refused to say whether it was Target management or the honey suppliers that wanted the source of the honey kept from the public.

Similar non-answers came from representatives of Safeway, Walmart and Giant Eagle.

The drugstores weren&apos;t any more open with the sources of their house brands of honey. A Rite Aid representative said &quot;if it&apos;s not marked made in China, than it&apos;s made in the United States.&quot; She didn&apos;t know who made it but said &quot;I&apos;ll ask someone.&quot;

Rite Aid, Walgreen and CVS have yet to supply the information.

Only two smaller Pacific Northwest grocery chains - Haggen and Metropolitan Market - both selling honey without pollen, weren&apos;t bashful about the source of their honey. Haggen said right off that its brand comes from Golden Heritage. Metropolitan Market said its honey - Western Family - is packed by Bee Maid Honey, a co-op of beekeepers from the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.

 Pollen? Who Cares? 

Why should consumers care if their honey has had its pollen removed?

&quot;Raw honey is thought to have many medicinal properties,&quot; says Kathy Egan, dietitian at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. &quot;Stomach ailments, anemia and allergies are just a few of the conditions that may be improved by consumption of unprocessed honey.&quot;

But beyond pollen&apos;s reported enzymes, antioxidants and well documented anti-allergenic benefits, a growing population of natural food advocates just don&apos;t want their honey messed with.

There is enormous variety among honeys. They range in color from glass-clear to a dark mahogany and in consistency from watery to chunky to a crystallized solid. It&apos;s the plants and flowers where the bees forage for nectar that will determine the significant difference in the taste, aroma and color of what the bees produce. It is the processing that controls the texture.

Food historians say that in the 1950s the typical grocery might have offered three or four different brands of honey. Today, a fair-sized store will offer 40 to 50 different types, flavors and sources of honey out of the estimated 300 different honeys made in the U.S.. And with the attractiveness of natural food and the locavore movement, honey&apos;s popularity is burgeoning. Unfortunately, with it comes the potential for fraud.

Concocting a sweet-tasting syrup out of cane, corn or beet sugar, rice syrup or any of more than a dozen sweetening agents is a great deal easier, quicker and far less expensive than dealing with the natural brew of bees.

However, even the most dedicated beekeeper can unknowingly put incorrect information on a honey jar&apos;s label.

Bryant has examined nearly 2,000 samples of honey sent in by beekeepers, honey importers, and ag officials checking commercial brands off store shelves. Types include premium honey such as &quot;buckwheat, tupelo, sage, orange blossom, and sourwood&quot; produced in Florida, North Carolina, California, New York and Virginia and &quot;fireweed&quot; from Alaska.

&quot;Almost all were incorrectly labeled based on their pollen and nectar contents,&quot; he said.

Out of the 60 plus samples that Bryant tested for Food Safety News, the absolute most flavorful said &quot;blackberry&quot; on the label. When Bryant concluded his examination of the pollen in this sample he found clover and wildflowers clearly outnumbering a smattering of grains of blackberry pollen.

For the most part we are not talking about intentional fraud here. Contrary to their most fervent wishes, beekeepers can&apos;t control where their bees actually forage any more than they can keep the tides from changing. They offer their best guess on the predominant foliage within flying distance of the hives.

&quot;I think we need a truth in labeling law in the U.S. as they have in other countries,&quot; Bryant added.

 FDA Ignores Pleas 

No one can say for sure why the FDA has ignored repeated pleas from Congress, beekeepers and the honey industry to develop a U.S. standard for identification for honey.

Nancy Gentry owns the small Cross Creek Honey Company in Interlachen, Fla., and she isn&apos;t worried about the quality of the honey she sells.

&quot;I harvest my own honey. We put the frames in an extractor, spin it out, strain it, and it goes into a jar. It&apos;s honey the way bees intended,&quot; Gentry said.

But the negative stories on the discovery of tainted and bogus honey raised her fears for the public&apos;s perception of honey.


She spent months of studying what the rest of the world was doing to protect consumers from tainted honey and questioning beekeepers and industry on what was needed here. Gentry became the leading force in crafting language for Florida to develop the nation&apos;s first standard for identification for honey.

In July 2009, Florida adopted the standard and placed its Division of Food Safety in the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in charge of enforcing it. It&apos;s since been followed by California, Wisconsin and North Carolina and is somewhere in the state legislative or regulatory maze in Georgia, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, New York, Texas, Kansas, Oregon, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and others.

John Ambrose&apos;s battle for a national definition goes back 36 years. He said the issue is of great importance to North Carolina because it has more beekeepers than any other state in the country.

He and others tried to convince FDA that a single national standard for honey to help prevent adulterated honey from being sold was needed. The agency promised him it would be on the books within two years.

&quot;But that never happened,&quot; said Ambrose, a professor and entomologist at North Carolina State University and apiculturist, or bee expert. North Carolina followed Florida&apos;s lead and passed its own identification standards last year.

Ambrose, who was co-chair of the team that drafted the state beekeeper association&apos;s honey standards says the language is very simple, &quot;Our standard says that nothing can be added or removed from the honey. So in other words, if somebody removes the pollen, or adds moisture or corn syrup or table sugar, that&apos;s adulteration,&quot; Ambrose told Food Safety News.

But still, he says he&apos;s asked all the time how to ensure that you&apos;re buying quality honey. &quot;The fact is, unless you&apos;re buying from a beekeeper, you&apos;re at risk,&quot; was his uncomfortably blunt reply.

Eric Silva, counsel for the American Honey Producers Association said the standard is a simple but essential tool in ensuring the quality and safety of honey consumed by millions of Americans each year.

&quot;Without it, the FDA and their trade enforcement counterparts are severely limited in their ability to combat the flow of illicit and potentially dangerous honey into this country,&quot; Silva told Food Safety News.

It&apos;s not just beekeepers, consumers and the industry that FDA officials either ignore or slough off with comments that they&apos;re too busy.

New York Sen. Charles Schumer is one of more than 20 U.S. senators and members of Congress of both parties who have asked the FDA repeatedly to create a federal &quot;pure honey&quot; standard, similar to what the rest of the world has established.

They get the same answer that Ambrose got in 1975: &quot;Any day now.&quot;

Argument over pig lineage leads to Portland chef brawl

 

 KGW.com-Michael Rollins 

PORTLAND, Ore. -- The lineage of a pig prompted a chef and a national cooking contest organizer to come to blows outside a Portland strip club early Monday morning.

Police reports uggest alcohol, and salty opinions of the quality of chefs inside and outside Oregon, were also part of an emotional recipe for the brawl.

 

Seven Portland police officers responded to the 2 a.m. fight outside the Magic Gardens, 417 N.W. 4th Avenue.

This &apos;only in Portland&apos; story started with a prestigious culinary competition called the Cochon 555 earlier in the evening.

Five winemakers were paired with five chefs, who each prepared a whole pig. A limited number of tickets were sold to the event. They cost from $125 to $175. Included was a butchering exhibition by a San Francisco chef.

According to the competition website, Cochon 555 aims to &quot;promote heritage pigs and breed diversity in local and national communities.&quot;

The Portland Cochon 555 event was at the Governor Hotel. The website said &quot;The after party will be held at Davis Street Tavern and will feature a handful of surprises.&quot;

What happened probably wasn&apos;t what Cochon organizers had in mind.

Witnesses said Eric R. Bechard, a rising star chef at the Thistle restaurant in McMinnville came into Old Town&apos;s Davis Street Tavern about 9:30 p.m. He appeared intoxicated.

Bechard got into an argument with a patron, then assaulted him, tavern owner Blake Smith told police. Smith said he personally knew Berchard and his behavior that night &quot;astonished him.&quot;

Carolina Uriba of Atlanta, Ga., a co-owner of the Cochon contest, told police she saw Bechard come into the tavern and get into an argument with one of the winemakers from the competition. He reportedly head-butted the winemaker.

She left with friends, including boyfriend and Cochon 555 co-founder Brady Lowe, also of Atlanta, Ga. They were hungry, she said, and headed down the street to the Magic Gardens club.

Bechard appeared at that club and started complaining about the use of a pig from Iowa. He told Uribe he was a local chef and a restaurant owner representing Oregon chefs. Why hadn&apos;t the competition used local pigs to support the local economy, he asked?

The police report said that Bechard told an officer &quot;people need to support Oregon farmers and local business.&quot;

Uribe said at one point, Bechard hit her in the chest, causing her to take several step back. Lowe then stepped between them.

According to several accounts, Lowe &quot;talked (smack) about Portland&quot; and Bechard said &quot;food doesn&apos;t come from San Francisco. Food comes from Portland.&quot; In quick order, the punches were flying. Both men went to the ground.

The very local police showed up to break up the fight.

Lowe was hit with pepper spray and Bechard by a Taser. Both were booked on assorted misdemeanor accusations involving disorderly conduct and interfering with police. All the charges have since been dropped.
Cochon 555 issued a statement which characterized the incident as an unprovoked attack on Lowe, who suffered a head injury and broken ankle.

News of the brawl made its way up through the Portland blogosphere, with reporting by Willamette Week, then appropiately enough, by a top notch food writer for the Oregonian.

KFC Extends the &quot;Double Down&quot;

 

 ABC News 

KFC says Americans are gobbling down so many Double Down sandwiches that the fast-food chain will offer the bunless, meaty sandwich longer than it had planned.

Originally the sandwich bacon and cheese surrounded by chicken filets was to have been available through Sunday.

But KFC said Wednesday that the sandwich will be available now for as long as customer demand remains high.

The Double Down came onto the market on April 12 and was supposed to have lasted about six weeks. But it tapped into Americans&apos; fascination with quirky food and became a viral-marketing sensation. People posted videos of themselves eating the sandwich on sites like YouTube, and celebrities like Stephen Colbert gobbled it up.

 

KFC said it has been one of its most successful sandwich launches ever. Later this month, KFC expects to sell its 10 millionth Double Down. They cost about $5.

Some have questioned the sandwiches&apos; nutritional value. The original version has 540 calories and 32 grams of fat, and 1,380 milligrams of salt. A grilled version cuts calories to 460 and fat to 23 grams, but sodium rises to 1,430 milligrams. By comparison, the Big Mac from McDonald&apos;s has 540 calories, 29 grams of fat and 1,040 milligrams of sodium.

The American Heart Association says people should aim to eat less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day.

KFC&apos;s corporate parent is Yum Brands Inc.

Cat Casserole

 

 www.timesonline.co.uk 


A top Italian food writer has been suspended indefinitely from the countrys version of the television programme Ready Steady Cook for recommending stewed cat to viewers as a succulent dish.

RAI, the public broadcasting network, said that it had dropped Beppe Bigazzi, 77, for offering the recipe on La Prova del Cuoco, which is broadcast at midday on the main channel. Its switchboard was inundated with complaints from viewers and animal rights groups. Bigazzi said that casserole of cat was a famous dish in his home region of Valdarno, Tuscany.

Ive eaten it myself and its a lot better than many other animals, he told viewers. Better than chicken, rabbit or pigeon. He said that for optimum flavour the meat should be soaked in spring water for three days before being stewed.

Elisa Isoardi, the programmes presenter who has a cat called Othello tried to steer Bigazzi off the subject. Reports said that during the commercial break she and the shows producers tried to persuade him to apologise to viewers but he refused.

Carla Rocchi, the head of ENPA, the Italian society for the protection of animals, said that killing cats was illegal. Francesca Martini, the Deputy Health Minister, said it was absolutely unheard of for a public service broadcaster to tell people how delicious cats are to eat. She called for the producers to be investigated for criminal offences involving incitement to mistreat animals.

Bigazzi, a consumer affairs journalist and author of Cooking with Common Sense, has been one of the stars of La Prova del Cuoco for the past ten years. He is noted for his exuberant style and previously caused uproar by boiling lobsters live on the show. Yesterday he said that he had only been joking about the recipe, and he had been misunderstood.

He added: Mind you, I wasnt joking all that much. In the 1930s and 1940s, when I was a boy, people certainly did eat cat

in the countryside around Arezzo. Food historians said that Italians in cities such as Vicenza devised cat recipes in times of economic hardship. Inhabitants of Vicenza are still nicknamed magnagati (cat eaters), and in some butchers shops rabbits are sold with their heads to assure buyers that they are not cats.

 here t

In his 1529 treatise on cookery, Ruperto de Nola recommended spit-roasting cat basted with garlic and olive oil. He wrote: Take the garlic with oil mixed with good broth so that it is coarse, and pour it over the cat and you can eat it for it is a good dish

The Spanish expression pasar gato por liebre derives from the practice of hunters trying to sell skinned cats as hares. When butchered, the animals are supposed to look almost identical

In 2007 Australians at a cooking contest in Alice Springs sought to curb the feral cat population by using them in a dish. One judge found the cat casserole so tough that she had to spit it out

Last month legal experts in China responded to pressure from the countrys middle class and proposed a ban on eating cat and dog meat. Both are traditional Chinese dishes but if the law is passed people caught eating cats could face 15 days in prison

Organic food no healthier

 


 London Evening Standard 
Sophie Goodchild

Organic produce is no better for health than conventional food, the Government&apos;s Food Standards Agency announced today.

Their report, after a 12-month study based on 50 years of research, says the benefits of chemical-free vegetables, fruit and meat have been overstated.

The findings could be a major blow to the 2billion-a-year organic food industry which has been hit by the recession.

Consumer group Which? said shoppers may now think twice about buying more expensive organic food.

The findings are based on the first comprehensive review into the nutrient value of organic food compared with food grown through conventional farming methods.

The FSA commissioned the study from the London School of Hygiene&amp;Tropical Medicine. More than 100 types of food were studied including rice, chicken, milk and eggs.

The review, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , found small but not important differences between the nutrient content of organic and conventional types of food.

Public health nutritionist Dr Alan Dangour, who led the review, said: This is the first time all this evidence has been brought together under one single study. Organic food is no worse than conventional but there is certainly no reason for suggesting organic food has a superior nutritional content.

A small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically and conventionally produced crops and livestock, but these are unlikely to be of any public health relevance.

There is no good evidence that consumption of organic food is beneficial to health in relation to nutrient content.

Organic campaigners today criticised the report as out of date and said it had failed to take into account the harmful impact of pesticides a major reason for some people going organic. Soil Association policy director Lord Melchett said: We don&apos;t think this report is going to change people&apos;s views.

The fact is people buy organic for many reasons including the fact it is more environmentally friendly. And if you actually look at the data, it&apos;s a lot more positive than the authors say. There have been a lot of significant studies since this report was completed but they haven&apos;t been included.

Sue Davies, of consumer group Which?, said: Our research shows that people buy organic for a number of reasons one of these being the perception that it&apos;s nutritionally better than conventional food. This research may make some people think twice before buying organic produce but this is only part of the picture as other people buy it for reasons such as pesticide or animal welfare concerns.

The FSA said it was neither for or against&apos; organic food and rejected calls to advise consumers against buying organic.

The watchdog said it had commissioned the study in response to criticism that it had not done enough to investigate claims over the nutritional benefits of organic food.

Gill Fine, FSA director of consumer choice and dietary health, said accurate information was absolutely essential so people can make informed choices about what they eat.

She said: This study does not mean people should not eat organic food. What it shows is that there is little, if any, nutritional difference between organic and conventionally produced food and that there is no evidence of additional health benefits from eating organic food.

Bacon Vodka

 

 Yes, Bacon Vodka. 
Bakon Vodka is a superior quality potato vodka with a savory bacon flavor. Its clean, crisp, and delicious. This is the only vodka youll ever want to use to make a Bloody Mary, and it&apos;s a complementary element of both sweet and savory drinks.

Bakon Vodka is also a great Bar-B-Q companion. Use it in a marinade or sip it chilled with a steak. Check out our recipes section for more ideas.


The Meat and Potatoes Premium quality, no joke.
We start with superior quality Idaho potatoes instead of the random mixed grains that make up most vodkas. Our vodka is column-distilled using a single heating process that doesnt bruise the alcohol like the multiple heating cycles needed to make a typical pot-still vodka.

No tinge or burn on the tongue, no obnoxious smoky or chemical flavors, just a clean refreshing potato vodka with delicious savory bacon flavor.

 Pure. Refreshing. Bacon.

Crave Man

 

 David Kessler Knew That Some Foods Are Hard to Resist; Now He Knows Why 

By Lyndsey Layton
 Washington Post Staff Writer 

He went in the middle of the night, long after the last employee had locked up the Chili&apos;s Grill and Bar. He&apos;d steer his car around the back, check to make sure no one was around and then quietly approach the dumpster.

If anyone noticed the man foraging through the trash, they would have assumed he was a vagrant. Except he was wearing black dress slacks and padded gardening gloves. &quot;I&apos;m surprised he didn&apos;t wear a tie,&quot; his wife said dryly.

The high-octane career path of David A. Kessler , the Harvard-trained doctor, lawyer, medical school dean and former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration had come to this: nocturnal dumpster diving. Sometimes, he would just reach in. Other times, he would climb in.

It took many of these forays until Kessler emerged with his prize: ingredient labels affixed to empty cardboard boxes that spelled out the fats, salt and sugar used to make the Southwestern Eggrolls, Boneless Shanghai Wings and other dishes served by the nation&apos;s second-largest restaurant chain.

Kessler was on a mission to understand a problem that has vexed him since childhood: why he can&apos;t resist certain foods.

His resulting theory, described in his new book, &quot;The End of Overeating,&quot; is startling. Foods high in fat, salt and sugar alter the brain&apos;s chemistry in ways that compel people to overeat. &quot;Much of the scientific research around overeating has been physiology -- what&apos;s going on in our body,&quot; he said. &quot;The real question is what&apos;s going on in our brain.&quot;

The ingredient labels gave Kessler information the restaurant chain declined to provide when he asked for it. At the FDA, Kessler pushed through nutritional labels on foods sold through retail outlets but stopped short of requiring the same for restaurants. Yet if suppliers ship across state lines, as suppliers for Chili&apos;s do, the ingredients must be printed on the box. That is what led Kessler, one of the nation&apos;s leading public health figures, to hang around dumpsters across California.

The labels showed the foods were bathed in salt, fat and sugars, beyond what a diner might expect by reading the menu, Kessler said. The ingredient list for Southwestern Eggrolls mentioned salt eight different times; sugars showed up five times. The &quot;egg rolls,&quot; which are deep-fried in fat, contain chicken that has been chopped up like meatloaf to give it a &quot;melt in the mouth&quot; quality that also makes it faster to eat. By the time a diner has finished this appetizer, she has consumed 910 calories, 57 grams of fat and 1,960 milligrams of sodium.

Instead of satisfying hunger, the salt-fat-sugar combination will stimulate that diner&apos;s brain to crave more, Kessler said. For many, the come-on offered by Lay&apos;s Potato Chips -- &quot;Betcha can&apos;t eat just one&quot; -- is scientifically accurate. And the food industry manipulates this neurological response, designing foods to induce people to eat more than they should or even want, Kessler found.

His theory, born out in a growing body of scientific research, has implications not just for the increasing number of Americans struggling with obesity but for health providers and policymakers.

&quot;The challenge is how do we explain to America what&apos;s going on -- how do we break through and help people understand how their brains have been captured?&quot; he said.

Kessler is best remembered for his investigation of the tobacco industry and attempts to place it under federal regulation while he was FDA commissioner from 1990 to 1997. Although he was appointed by George H.W. Bush, Kessler became popular among Democrats for his tough regulatory stance. He got the nickname &quot;Eliot Knessler&quot; after he authorized the U.S. attorney&apos;s office in Minnesota to seize a large quantity of Citrus Hill Fresh Choice orange juice in 1991 because it was labeled &quot;fresh&quot; when it was, in fact, partially processed. After he was elected in 1992, President Bill Clinton asked Kessler to continue to run the FDA.

Kessler&apos;s aggressive approach toward the tobacco industry led to billion-dollar settlements between Big Tobacco and 46 states and laid the groundwork for legislation now pending in Congress that would place tobacco under FDA regulation.

Kessler, 57, sees parallels between the tobacco and food industries. Both are manipulating consumer behavior to sell products that can harm health, he said.

Whether government ought to exercise tougher controls over the food industry is going to be the next great debate, especially since much of the advertising is aimed at children, Kessler said.

&quot;The food the industry is selling is much more powerful than we realized,&quot; he said. &quot;I used to think I ate to feel full. Now I know, we have the science that shows, we&apos;re eating to stimulate ourselves. And so the question is what are we going to do about it?&quot;

The idea for the book came seven years ago as Kessler was channel-surfing and came across an overweight woman named Sarah on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot; While Sarah was successful in nearly every aspect of her life, she tearfully told Winfrey, she could not control her eating.

Kessler was mesmerized by Sarah -- she was describing his own private struggle. &quot;I needed to not only figure out Sarah -- I needed to figure out myself,&quot; he said. &quot;Little did I know it would lead me into real fundamental issues of what makes us human and how our brains are wired.&quot;

At 5-foot-11, Kessler&apos;s weight has swung from 160 pounds to 230 pounds and back, many times over. He owns pants in sizes ranging from 34 to 42.

&quot;I was a fat kid,&quot; he said. &quot;I grew up in the world of Entenmann&apos;s cakes. I was pretty much of a science nerd. If you looked in my refrigerator in college, it was Entenmann&apos;s.&quot;

Every few years, Kessler would go on a diet and apply the kind of discipline that enabled him to earn a law degree from the University of Chicago while attending Harvard Medical School. &quot;I&apos;d lose weight and over time gain it back,&quot; said Kessler, who also completed a medical residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore at the same time he worked as a staffer to Sen. Orrin Hatch. &quot;I couldn&apos;t control it.&quot;

The man who took on Big Tobacco was helpless when confronted with a plate of chocolate chip cookies. He couldn&apos;t focus on anything else until he had eaten them all.

&quot;My weight was yo-yoing all the time,&quot; said Kessler, who estimates that 70 million Americans struggle with conditioned hyper-eating. &quot;And I never understood why.&quot;

He embarked on a mission to figure it out while serving as dean of the medical school at Yale University and later the University of California at San Francisco. UCSF fired Kessler from his position as dean in December after he alleged financial malfeasance at the institution. The university maintains there were no financial misdeeds; Kessler says he was forced out because he blew the whistle. He remains on the faculty at the medical school and lives in San Francisco with his wife, Paulette, a lawyer. They have two grown children, both of whom live in Washington.

Paulette says that she was not taken aback when her husband of 34 years would disappear in the middle of the night on his dumpster tour. &quot;Nothing surprises me anymore,&quot; she said. &quot;When he wants to find something out, there&apos;s really no stopping him.&quot;

Through interviews with scientists, psychologists and food industry insiders, and his own scientific studies and hours spent surreptitiously watching other diners at food courts and restaurants around the country, Kessler said, he finally began to understand why he couldn&apos;t control his eating.

&quot;Highly palatable&quot; foods -- those containing fat, sugar and salt -- stimulate the brain to release dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with the pleasure center, he found. In time, the brain gets wired so that dopamine pathways light up at the mere suggestion of the food, such as driving past a fast-food restaurant, and the urge to eat the food grows insistent. Once the food is eaten, the brain releases opioids, which bring emotional relief. Together, dopamine and opioids create a pathway that can activate every time a person is reminded about the particular food. This happens regardless of whether the person is hungry.

Not everyone is vulnerable to &quot;conditioned overeating&quot; -- Kessler estimates that about 15 percent of the population is not affected and says more research is needed to understand what makes them immune.

But for those like Kessler, the key to stopping the cycle is to rewire the brain&apos;s response to food -- not easy in a culture where unhealthy food and snacks are cheap and plentiful, portions are huge and consumers are bombarded by advertising that links these foods to fun and good times, he said.

Deprivation only heightens the way the brain values the food, which is why dieting doesn&apos;t work, he said.

What&apos;s needed is a perceptual shift, Kessler said. &quot;We did this with cigarettes,&quot; he said. &quot;It used to be sexy and glamorous but now people look at it and say, &apos;That&apos;s not my friend, that&apos;s not something I want.&apos; We need to make a cognitive shift as a country and change the way we look at food. Instead of viewing that huge plate of nachos and fries as a guilty pleasure, we have to . . . look at it and say, &apos;That&apos;s not going to make me feel good. In fact, that&apos;s disgusting.&apos; &quot;

Kessler said he&apos;s made that shift in his own life, eating small portions of foods that contain fat, salt and sugar, part of a &quot;food rehab&quot; plan he suggests in the book. He has certain rules -- no french fries, ever -- that help him navigate through vulnerable moments.

He has embraced spinning -- the first time he has regularly exercised. &quot;I hated physical activity, all of my life, mostly because I was fat and it was hard to do,&quot; he said. &quot;But I just wanted to do something. I picked spinning because you can&apos;t fall off the bike.&quot; He worked with a private trainer for weeks just to be ready to take a class. &quot;I was embarrassed to go into the class,&quot; he said.

Now Kessler tries to spin every day and belongs to multiple health clubs so that he has more options for class times.

He avoids the cues that focus his brain on &quot;highly palatable&quot; foods, going so far as to chart a different route through San Francisco International Airport so that he doesn&apos;t walk past the fried dumpling stand.

Kessler&apos;s weight is relatively stable at 162 pounds. But there&apos;s something else that&apos;s changed. As he has come to better understand himself, the food cravings and the resulting anguish he felt have subsided.

&quot;So I&apos;m at peace,&quot; he said. &quot;After 30 years, I&apos;m at peace.&quot;

Unwanted garden snails cooked by gardener

 

A gardener who found her garden had been invaded by snails has devised recipes for cooking and eating them.

 By Richard Savill 

Oriole Parker-Rhodes, 59, a grandmother, has begun making meals out of the snails she has found in her garden and has set up an internet blog with her recipes and tips, and information on keeping and breeding them.


&quot;Last summer it was really wet and warm, ideal for snails,&quot; she said. &quot;I was treading on them and they were also eating our home-grown potatoes.&quot;

Her visitors to her home in Anglesey were mainly the garden snail, Helix Aspersa , which came to Britain with the Romans, who liked to eat them.

Miss Parker-Rhodes said she had eaten weeds including sorrel and nettles for years, because they were nutritious, they had flavour, they were &quot;free&quot;, and she enjoyed picking them.

Eating snails was also &quot;part of living with nature&quot;, she said, adding that in the present economic climate people could benefit from following her example.

&quot;I was brought up to be interested in nature,&quot; said Miss Parker-Rhodes, whose mother was a birdwatcher, and her father a mycologist. Her companion is an entomologist studying insects.

She has developed her own cooking preparation methods, which involve giving the snails a home for about a week in an enclosed space, such as a bucket covered by a pair of tights.

She gives them food and water, including lettuce, onion, stale bread and bran, a process designed to clear out any grit in their guts.

The snails are then purged, which means they have no water or food for 48 hours, so their guts empty.

To kill the gastropods, they must be right inside their shells, she says, and then plunged into boiling water for five minutes.

Mrs Parker-Rhodes, who was recently interviewed by John Sargeant on the BBC programme, the One Show, said she takes them out of their shells, washes them and boils them again in stock for about an hour until the snails become tender.

She said restaurants usually serve six per plate as an hors d&apos;oevre but her meals consist of 12 with salad, garlic, parsley or butter sauce and bread.
She said: &quot;They are perfectly good meat. They are very high in protein and low in fat; in some ways, they are better than beef.&quot;

SNAILS IN WILD HERBS
Using a good book, collect seasonal weeds. Wash and chop finely, then
Blanch for 5 mins the wild herbs you can lay your hands on.
I used the following:

Water parsnip
Wild sorrel
Water cress
Nettle tips
A little ribwort plantain.
Sieve , pressing out the water.
Finely chopped ramsons
(if in season, otherwise use onion or garlic with the blanched herbs)
Add all these to melted butter.
Put a snail in each hollow of a snail plate and add as much paste as possible.
Bake for 20 mins.
Serve with cubes of bread and salad.

Study Finds High-Fructose Corn Syrup Contains Mercury

 
Never mind those horribly misleading ads on TV about High Fructose Corn Syrup being &quot;OK in moderation&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;??? High Fructose Corn Syrup, made from farmed corn, most of which is genetically modified to keep costs down, is further modified via a switch in the molecules, also to keep down costs. The result is a sweet preservative found in just about all processed foods, and if the molestation of nature doesn&apos;t scare you, you should ask yourself if they cheaped the sweet in this product, what else did they cheap out on and should I put that *&amp;^% in my body?

To see in more detail how the industrial food complex conspires to put HFCS and other wonderful things like beef fed on the same modified corn, antibiotics and the fat of other cows, read Pollan&apos;s &quot;The Omnivores Dilemma&quot; .

Still not worried about your yogurt, soda, ice cream, breakfast bar, lunchmeat or soup? Read the following article by the Washington Post:
------------------------------



Wednesday, January 28, 2009; 12:00 AM

MONDAY, Jan. 26 (HealthDay News) -- Almost half of tested samples of commercial high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) contained mercury, which was also found in nearly a third of 55 popular brand-name food and beverage products where HFCS is the first- or second-highest labeled ingredient, according to two new U.S. studies.

HFCS has replaced sugar as the sweetener in many beverages and foods such as breads, cereals, breakfast bars, lunch meats, yogurts, soups and condiments. On average, Americans consume about 12 teaspoons per day of HFCS, but teens and other high consumers can take in 80 percent more HFCS than average.

&quot;Mercury is toxic in all its forms. Given how much high-fructose corn syrup is consumed by children, it could be a significant additional source of mercury never before considered. We are calling for immediate changes by industry and the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] to help stop this avoidable mercury contamination of the food supply,&quot; the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy&apos;s Dr. David Wallinga, a co-author of both studies, said in a prepared statement.

In the first study, published in current issue of Environmental Health, researchers found detectable levels of mercury in nine of 20 samples of commercial HFCS.

And in the second study, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP), a non-profit watchdog group, found that nearly one in three of 55 brand-name foods contained mercury. The chemical was found most commonly in HFCS-containing dairy products, dressings and condiments.

But an organization representing the refiners is disputing the results published in Environmental Health.

&quot;This study appears to be based on outdated information of dubious significance,&quot; said Audrae Erickson, president of the Corn Refiners Association, in a statement. &quot;Our industry has used mercury-free versions of the two re-agents mentioned in the study, hydrochloric acid and caustic soda, for several years. These mercury-free re-agents perform important functions, including adjusting pH balances.&quot;

However, the IATP told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that four plants in Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio and West Virginia still use &quot;mercury-cell&quot; technology that can lead to contamination.

IATP&apos;s Ben Lilliston also told HealthDay that the Environmental Health findings were based on information gathered by the FDA in 2005.

And the group&apos;s own study, while not peer-reviewed, was based on products &quot;bought off the shelf in the autumn of 2008,&quot; Lilliston added.

The use of mercury-contaminated caustic soda in the production of HFCS is common. The contamination occurs when mercury cells are used to produce caustic soda.

&quot;The bad news is that nobody knows whether or not their soda or snack food contains HFCS made from ingredients like caustic soda contaminated with mercury. The good news is that mercury-free HFCS ingredients exist. Food companies just need a good push to only use those ingredients,&quot; Wallinga said in his prepared statement.

For Unrefined Healthfulness: Whole Grains

 

 NY Times-By JANE E. BRODY 
Published: March 4, 2003

Carbohydrates have been taking a beating lately, blamed for the growing obesity epidemic, a raised risk of heart disease and diabetes, among others. To be sure, the carbs that predominate in the American diet -- sugars and refined starches -- deserve much of this unsavory reputation.

Consumed to excess as they are now, refined starches act like sugars. Each is widely considered a major culprit in making people overweight, and being excessively overweight adversely affects blood lipids and blood sugar, fostering heart disease and diabetes.

But there is another far more wholesome kind of carbohydrate -- whole grains, which make up only 5 percent of Americans&apos; carbohydrate consumption.

Whole grains contain health-enhancing bran (the outer layer) and germ (the internal embryo) naturally found in all grains. When grains are refined to make white flour and white rice, for example, the bran and germ and all their healthful nutrients, antioxidants and other disease-fighting plant chemicals are systematically removed.

In January, researchers summarized the numerous health advantages of substituting whole grains for most of the refined starches now dominating Western-style diets at a conference exploring the health benefits of traditional Mediterranean-style foods. Oldways Preservation&amp;Exchange Trust of Boston and the Harvard School of Public Health sponsored the conference.

The surgeon general&apos;s goal is for all Americans to consume at least three servings a day of whole grains, but the nation&apos;s daily average is now only about half a serving. Only 13 percent of Americans include at least one serving of whole grains in their daily diets.

The Food and Drug Administration allows food manufacturers to claim health benefits for their products with at least 51 percent whole grains by weight and less than 3 grams of fat per serving. It states, &apos;&apos;Diets rich in whole-grain foods and other plant foods low in total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol may help reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers.&apos;&apos;

 Whole grains contain no cholesterol, are low in fat and high in dietary fiber and vitamins and are also a good source of minerals. Though whole grains are concentrated packets of starch, they contain about 10 percent to 15 percent protein. But it is the indigestible fiber and phytochemicals in whole grains that render them stars in disease prevention. 

A Role in Weight Control

 Refined grains are almost pure starch, long chains of molecules of glucose, the blood sugar. Like sugar, most foods made from refined grains are rapidly digested and absorbed into the bloodstream, causing an abrupt rise in blood glucose and prompting the pancreas to spew out insulin to move the excess glucose out of the blood and into cells for energy and storage.

The sudden influx of glucose can cause an overproduction of insulin that results in enough of a drop in blood glucose to cause hunger to return in an hour or two, prompting people to eat between meals -- often snacks of sugars and refined starches.

But when a food contains all or mostly whole grains, digestion and absorption are slowed by the fibrous bran and by the protein and fat in the germ, increasing satiety and delaying the return of hunger. People who eat more whole grains tend to weigh less than those who consume fewer. 

For example, in a study of 3,627 men and women followed for seven years, those who ate the most whole grains -- more than nine times a week -- weighed five to eight pounds less, on average, than those who consumed the least (no more than twice a week) of these foodstuffs, Dr. Simin Liu of Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston reported.

Highlighting the Benefits

People who eat whole grains are healthier and live longer. In a continuing study of nearly 34,000 Iowa women, initially aged 55 to 69, Dr. David Jacobs at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health and colleagues found that those who ate at least one serving of whole-grain foods a day, primarily as bread and breakfast cereal, had a significantly lower rate of death from all causes when compared with women who ate almost no whole grains.

Several large prospective studies have highlighted the contributions whole grains can make to health and longevity.

For example, among the Iowa women, whole grain intake is directly related to a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, the leading killer of women and men in the United States.

Likewise, a Finnish study of 21,930 male smokers and an American study of 43,757 male health professionals found a reduced risk of heart attacks among those who ate the most whole-grain bread and cereal.

Although soluble fiber in whole grains is known to lower artery-damaging cholesterol, other components of whole grains contribute to cardiovascular protection, including antioxidants, phytic acid, lectins, phenolic compounds, amylase inhibitors and saponins. Dr. Joanne L. Slavin, a professor of food and nutrition at the University of Minnesota, says the protection probably comes from a combination of compounds in whole grains.

Dozens of studies have shown that cancer risks are reduced by eating whole grains. As Dr. Slavin noted in The Journal of the American Dietetic Association: &apos;&apos;Whole grains are rich sources of a wide range of phytochemicals with anticarcinogenic properties. Some of these phytochemicals block DNA damage and suppress cancer cell growth.&apos;&apos;

The fiber in whole grains increases fecal bulk and speeds the transit of stool, decreasing the opportunity for mutagens to damage cells and cause cancer of the digestive tract. In addition, Dr. Slavin noted, hormonally active lignans in whole grains &apos;&apos;may protect against hormonally mediated diseases, such as cancers of the breast and prostate.&apos;&apos;

Whole grains can also help to counter the current epidemic of Type 2 diabetes. Whole grains have a low glycemic index: their consumption results in only small rises in blood sugar and insulin release.

In large studies of men and women, higher intakes of cereal fiber (from the whole grains) have been linked to a reduced risk of diabetes.

In the Nurses&apos; Health Study of nearly 90,000 women and the Health Professionals&apos; Study of nearly 44,000 men, those who consumed the most cereal fiber had about a 30 percent lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, independent of body weight.

More Whole Grains

Dr. Slavin noted that only about 5 percent of the grain foods in the American diet are in the form of whole grains, primarily whole wheat and oats. But whole grain is the main ingredient in about 18 percent of ready-to-eat cereals, suggesting that Americans can easily increase their whole grain intake by eating right at breakfast and steering clear of sugary, highly refined cereals that line supermarket shelves.

Among the cereals that qualify for the whole grain claim are Wheaties, Cheerios, Wheat Chex, Whole Grain Total, Oatmeal Crisp with raisins or apples, Shredded Wheat, Grape Nuts and Grape Nuts Flakes, Raisin Bran, Life, oatmeal (not instant), Malt-O-Meal and Low-Fat Granola by Kellogg&apos;s and Quaker.

Some sweetened cereals also qualify, including Frosted Mini Wheats and Oatmeal Squares.

But cereal is just one source of whole grains, food writers and chefs at the Oldways conference noted.
 

Possibilities include whole grain breads (check the label: whole wheat should be the first ingredient), brown rice, barley, bulgur (cracked wheat), whole wheat pasta, buckwheat groats (eaten unroasted as porridge or roasted as kasha), wild rice, whole-kernel corn and, to the delight of snackers, low-fat popcorn.

In addition, many whole grains less commonly eaten in America are worth discovering. These include grano, farro, millet, spelt, sorghum and amaranth (the golden grain of the Aztecs). Although rarely available locally, exotic grains can be ordered by mail.

Giraffe is kosher, rabbis rule in Israel

 

 Tim Butcher 



According to a report in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, vets were asked to treat an adult, female giraffe at Israel&apos;s largest zoo, the Safari Park in Ramat Gan.

The team, led by Professor Zohar Amar, took a routine sample of milk and found that it clotted in the way required by Jewish law for kosher certification.

They submitted more milk for verification by the rabbinical authorities and the paper reported that a ruling was made that giraffe meat and milk are acceptable for observant Jews.

The giraffe belongs to the family of grazing animals that have cloven hooves and chew the cud, thereby making them consistent with kosher rules, but the milk test was the final confirmation.

&quot;Indeed, the giraffe is kosher for eating,&quot; Rabbi Shlomo Mahfoud, who accompanied the researchers in their work, said.

&quot;The giraffe has all the signs of a ritually pure animal, and the milk that forms curds strengthened that.&quot;

But Dr Yigal Horowitz, the zoo&apos;s chief vet, said this did not mean there would suddenly be a surge in demand of giraffe food products in Israel.

&quot;This does not mean that tomorrow we are going to drink giraffe milk or eat soup made from giraffe necks,&quot; he said.

&quot;After all, this is an animal in danger of extinction.&quot;

All-you-can-eat seats becoming popular at venues

 


KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.

And some more.

And more.

The Associated Press reports a growing trend is in all-you-can-eat seating at sports venues -- for one flat rate. Alcohol and desserts usually are sold separately.

Nearly half of the 30 major league baseball teams -- including the Texas Rangers -- have added all-inclusive seats.

Most cover only the basics: like hot dogs, popcorn and soda.

The NBA&apos;s San Antonio Spurs sell all-you-can-eat tickets.

The NFL&apos;s Houston Texans last year opened the 500-seat Director&apos;s Club, offering unlimited food and drinks. Memberships for the 2009 season cost $1,250.

Jeanne Goldberg is a professor of nutrition science at the Friedman School of Nutrition at Tufts.

Goldberg says -- just what the world doesn&apos;t need is another way to get as much food as you want whenever you want it.

Pigs&apos; feet: the new superfood

 

 telegraph.co.uk 

 As Britain&apos;s spending on cosmetic surgery soars, Fiona MacDonald Smith suggests it&apos;s time that we chopped and changed our diet instead 

The latest anti-ageing food? Pigs&apos; trotters. That&apos;s right, you heard it here first. In New York, the most talked-about new opening of the past couple of months has been a Japanese restaurant called Hakata Tonton, where 33 out of the 39 dishes contain pigs&apos; feet.

The reason for this, according to its owner, Himi Okajima, is that they are rich in collagen, the protein responsible for skin and muscle tone, more recognisable to beauty addicts in the form of face creams and fillers.

&quot;Collagen helps your body retain moisture,&quot; says Okajima, who has introduced a chain of restaurants specialising in collagen cuisine in Japan. &quot;Your hair and skin will look better, but it&apos;s not just for looking beautiful now. If you begin eating collagen in your thirties, you will look younger in your forties.&quot;

Maybe this sounds a little improbable (&quot;It&apos;s news to me,&quot; sniffs Lisa Miles of the British Nutrition Foundation. &quot;I&apos;ve certainly never heard of eating collagen&quot;) but Okajima believes he is on to something. Figures published last month show that British spending on cosmetic surgery is the highest in Europe, hitting nearly 500 million in 2006, four times more than in 2001.

Isn&apos;t there a cheaper solution? Couldn&apos;t eating the right foods, in the right way, be a simpler, and ultimately more long-term way to stay looking and feeling younger? &quot;You are what you eat,&quot; says nutritional therapist Ian Marber, aka The Food Doctor.

&quot;You can&apos;t turn the clock back but you can slow things down. Every cell replicates from RNA and DNA. In order to keep the DNA in good condition, you want to protect cells from harmful free radicals. And for this you need to eat fruit and vegetables, which contain vital anti-oxidants like vitamins A, C, E and zinc.

&quot;It doesn&apos;t have to be expensive,&quot; he adds. &quot;I know people go on about so-called &apos;superfoods&apos; which have a greater concentration of anti-oxidants, but two apples a day will give you plenty of vitamins and fibre. You just need to ensure a varied diet.&quot;

&quot;The key is to remember we&apos;re omnivorous,&quot; agrees nutritionist Christian Lee, who is the national trainer for the Dr Nicholas Perricone cosmetics and nutrition empire. &quot;Have you ever noticed how women age more rapidly than men?

That&apos;s because they don&apos;t eat enough protein. The days you don&apos;t eat protein are the days you age. The body can&apos;t store protein, but it needs it for cellular production and function.

&quot;At each meal you should be able to hold up three fingers and say &apos;I&apos;ve got a good source of protein (lean fish or poultry, nuts, seeds or tofu); an essential fatty acid (Omega 3 or 6, so that&apos;s coldwater oily fish, flaxseeds, linseeds) and a low glycaemic carbohydrate (fruit, vegetables, and wholegrains like quinoa, buckwheat and oatmeal)&apos;. If you can say that, you&apos;re on the right road.&quot;

Perricone, a dermatologist, became America&apos;s most famous anti-ageing specialist with his &quot;Three-Day Nutritional Face Lift&quot;, which extolled the virtues of eating wild Alaskan salmon twice a day, claiming its essential fatty acids would banish puffiness and tighten the skin. Uma Thurman, Heidi Klum and J-Lo are all fans.

In his new book Ageless Face, Ageless Mind, which has yet to reach the UK, Dr Perricone&apos;s team assert that up to 40 per cent of wrinkles are caused by dietary sugar.

&quot;When you eat high glycaemic carbohydrates like bread, cakes and pasta, they turn into sugar in the blood so fast that the pancreas can&apos;t respond with enough insulin and the blood becomes saturated with sugar,&quot; argues Christian Lee. &quot;The sugar needs to go somewhere so it attaches itself to the cell membranes.

When it does this to collagen molecules in the skin, it causes the collagen to become stiff and immobile and that&apos;s the birth of the wrinkle. The bad news is that it doesn&apos;t end there - the sugar then pumps out free radicals, causing a double whammy of damage.

The good news is you can prevent it - either by cutting out sugar or by taking a supplement of alpha lipoic acid, which is 400 times stronger than vitamin C and E combined.&quot;

So ditch the sugar, but don&apos;t forget the pigs&apos; trotters.

Europe&apos;s truffle harvests drying up

 

 Farmers blame drought on global warming 

 Feb 22, 2008 12:51 PM
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
AUPS, France Philippe Daniel opens a slim briefcase so buyers can glimpse his wares, then snaps it shut with a wary glance over his shoulder.

Daniel is not dealing in contraband but in truffles tubers prized for their heady fragrance and rich, earthy flavor. One of the world&apos;s most sought-after gastronomical treasures, truffles fetch astronomical prices, and sellers like Daniel are always alert for spying competitors.

Daniel used to deal in big quantities. But for the past five years, drought has been parching the Var region of southeast France as well as truffle-producing regions in Italy and Spain and today he can fit his entire weekly harvest in a single plastic bag.

He&apos;s not the only one.

Organizers at the market in the Var village of Aups, where Daniel plies his wares, have had to suspend the weekly wholesale auction, where middlemen used to bid tens of thousands of dollars for mounds of truffles. The reason: these days there simply aren&apos;t enough of the fragrant fungi.

Now, foodies and tourists buying truffles by the piece have replaced the bulk-buying middlemen, and most transactions at the once-bustling market are measured in grams. At the Aups market, the black truffle&apos;s price has more than doubled over the past five years, to about $560 a pound.

Farmers say production is down by 50-75 percent this winter season and they blame global warming, warning that if thermometers keep rising as many scientists predict they could France&apos;s black truffle will one day be just a memory.

This is not the first time weather has caused a dramatic downturn in French truffle production. A severe drought in the early &apos;60s more than halved the harvest, bringing it down to about 50 tons. But the trufficulteurs, as truffle farmers are known, contend this current dry spell is longer and more acute.

&quot;Climate change has got the seasons out of whack, it&apos;s hotter than it used to be and it rains lots less,&quot; said Jean Montesano, 76, a trufficulteur for more than half a century. &quot;I want my grandson to take over, but if things continue like this, who knows if there will be anything left.&apos;&apos;
 
Production in France has been in slow decline for 100 years from 1,000 tons a year to just 50 tons, according to the Agriculture Ministry under the march of urban sprawl into the fungus&apos; forest habitat and the migration of farming folk to cities.

Truffles grow underground, in the root systems of host trees. Shriveled, black-skinned and egg-shaped, they are hard to distinguish from clods of dirt.

Specially trained dogs sniff and dig them out, and are rewarded with doggy treats. Pigs bigger, hungrier and harder to manage have largely fallen out of favor.

Families jealously guard the whereabouts of the richest corners of the forest. Wealthier producers electric-fence their plantations to discourage wild boars and poachers.

Chefs have for centuries used truffles to dress up all sorts of dishes, from creamy sauces to mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs. The 18th and 19th century French epicurean Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin famously called the truffle the &quot;diamond of the kitchen,&quot; and hailed it as an aphrodisiac that &quot;makes women more tender and men more amiable.&apos;&apos;

Legend has it that Napoleon went on a diet of truffle-stuffed turkey and champagne in a desperate attempt to conceive a male heir. A son, Napoleon FranEcois-Joseph Charles, was born March 20, 1811.

Truffles need just the right amount of rain at just the right time to thrive: Too little desiccates them; too much drowns them.

With annual rainfall in the Var down from around 40 inches in 1996 to under half that last year, Aups&apos; once-abundant wild truffles have all but disappeared. Only one of the market&apos;s sellers, Jean Paul, still strikes out into the hardy oak forests that surround the village to hunt wild truffles. The few he finds are puny, he said.

The drought has also hit production elsewhere in France and in Europe&apos;s other main truffle producing regions, in Spain and Italy. Croatia and Belgium also produce truffles in smaller quantities, as do North Carolina and Oregon.

Last year, the harvest of Italy&apos;s prized white truffle was down as much as 75 percent from 2006, according to Andrea Rosin, the head of truffle export company Tartufingros. Spain&apos;s 2007 black truffle harvest was down more than half from five years earlier, said Daniel Oliach, of a growers&apos; association in the northeastern region of Catalonia.

In Italy, white truffle prices were up about 60 percent in 2007 from the previous year, and one white truffle, a giant weighing about 3 pounds, 4 ounces, fetched a record $330,000 at auction.

Stanley Ho, the East Asian gambling king, placed the winning bid for the truffle which had been dug up in Tuscany, in central Italy.

Hong Kong&apos;s South China Morning Post reported it was eaten days later, prepared by two high-caliber chefs for a 200-guest banquet. Ho reportedly missed the feast because of poor health.

Nowadays, say the trufficulteurs, only truffles cultivated in irrigated plantations have much of a chance of surviving the sunbaked summers.

&quot;Anyone who doesn&apos;t irrigate will not have a single truffle, not a single one,&quot; said veteran Montesano, whose face is as deeply etched as the wind-blown hills around Aups. Montesano waters his 25-acre plantation of French oaks, the black truffle&apos;s preferred host, with groundwater pumped from deep-lying aquifers.

Climate scientists say it is too early to link the drought to global warming, but point to computer models that suggest the entire Mediterranean basin is getting warmer and dryer.

The Met Office, Britain&apos;s weather agency, says that by 2030, Mediterranean rainfall is expected to be down by one-quarter, and annual average air temperatures are likely to be up in Europe by as much as 6 degrees Centigrade by 2080.

Changing climate could mean changing truffle terrain. Already, producers in the southern hemisphere and in China are making inroads.

France imported 33 tons of fresh or frozen truffles from China in 2007, overtaking French production for the first time. At under $20 a pound, the Chinese variety is far cheaper than European truffles, but Aups trufficulteur Lucien Barbaroux, 60, says he&apos;s sure his customers can tell the difference in quality.

&quot;Our clients here are now connoisseurs and they&apos;re not about to be duped,&quot; he said. &quot;They know how to recognize the real stuff.&apos;&apos;

Australia and New Zealand, which introduced truffles from Europe about 20 years ago, now produce a half ton of the fungus annually mostly for domestic consumption, said Ian Hill, the New Zealand-based author of &quot;Taming the Truffle&quot; and other books on fungi.

&quot;If Europe&apos;s catastrophic decline continues, it could well be that the Southern Hemisphere will overtake production in the north,&quot; Hill said in a telephone interview.

In Defense of Food

 

 {This is an excellent book, 5 Paw rating} 

 NPR-Morning Edition
January 1, 2008 

&quot;Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.&quot;

That&apos;s the advice journalist and author Michael Pollan offers in his new book, In Defense of Food.

&quot;That&apos;s it. That is the short answer to the supposedly incredibly complicated and confusing question of what we humans should eat in order to be maximally healthy,&quot; Pollan tells Steve Inskeep.

An extended interview with the author can be heard via this link 

 &apos;Eat Food&apos; 

The implication of Pollan&apos;s advice, however, is that what we&apos;re eating now isn&apos;t food.

&quot;Very often, it isn&apos;t,&quot; he says. &quot;We are eating a lot of edible food-like substances, which is to say highly processed things that might be called yogurt, might be called cereals, whatever, but in fact are very intricate products of food science that are really imitations of foods.&quot;

Pollan acknowledges that distinguishing between food and &quot;food products&quot; takes work. His tip: &quot;Don&apos;t eat anything that your great-grandmother wouldn&apos;t recognize as food.&quot;

Take, for example, the portable tubes of yogurt known as Go-Gurt, Pollan says. &quot;Imagine your grandmother or your great-grandmother picking up this tube, holding it up to the light, trying to figure out how to administer it to her body if indeed it is something that goes in your body and then imagine her reading the ingredients,&quot; he says. &quot;Yogurt is a very simple food. It&apos;s milk inoculated with a bacterial culture. But Go-Gurt has dozens of ingredients.&quot;

 &apos;Not Too Much&apos; 

A large part of the conversation about food like debating low-fat and low-carb diets serves as a way of avoiding the idea that maybe we&apos;re just eating too much, Pollan says. He says his advice about how to limit consumption is based less on science, which he says &quot;has failed us when it comes to food, by and large,&quot; and more on culture.

&quot;Cultures have various devices to help people moderate their appetite,&quot; he says. &quot;Once upon a time, there was scarcity. We don&apos;t have that anymore; we have abundance. But if you go around the world, you find very interesting tricks and devices.&quot;

One is small portion sizes, Pollan says. &quot;The French manage to eat extravagantly rich food, but they don&apos;t get fat, and the reason is that they eat it on small plates, they don&apos;t have seconds, they don&apos;t snack.&quot;

In Okinawa, Japan, a cultural principle called &quot;Hara Hachi Bu&quot; instructs people to eat until they are just 80 percent full, Pollan says. &quot;You do know when you are full, and the idea of stopping eating before you reach that moment if you do that, you will actually reduce your caloric intake quite a bit,&quot; he says.

 &apos;Mostly Plants&apos; 

Finally, eating plants is very important, Pollan says. &quot;There is incontrovertible but boring evidence that eating your fruits and vegetables is probably the best thing you can do for preventing cancer, for weight control, for diabetes, for all the different, all the Western diseases that now afflict us,&quot; he says.

But can you follow Pollan&apos;s advice and avoid processed foods without spending a ton of time and money?

&quot;You&apos;re going to have to spend either more time or more money, and perhaps a little bit of both,&quot; Pollan says. &quot;And I think that&apos;s just the reality. It&apos;s really a question of priorities, and we have, in effect, devalued food. And what I&apos;m arguing is to move it a little closer to the center of our lives, and that we are going to have to put more into it, but that it will be very rewarding if we do.

&quot;And if we don&apos;t, by the way, we are going to suffer from this you know, we hear this phrase so many times this epidemic of chronic disease. But the fact is, we are at a fork in the road. We&apos;re either going to get used to chronic disease, and be in the age of Lipitor and dialysis centers on every corner in the city, or we&apos;re going to change the way we eat. I mean, it&apos;s really that simple. Most of the things that are killing us these days whether it&apos;s heart disease, diabetes, obesity, many, many cancers are directly attributed to the way we&apos;re eating.&quot;


 Excerpt: &apos;In Defense of Food: An Eater&apos;s Manifesto&apos; 

by Michael Pollan

 Food Science&apos;s Golden Age 


In the years following the 1977 Dietary Goals and the 1982 National Academy of Sciences report on diet and cancer, the food industry, armed with its regulatory absolution, set about reengineering thousands of popular food products to contain more of the nutrients that science and government had deemed the good ones and fewer of the bad. A golden age for food science dawned. Hyphens sprouted like dandelions in the supermarket aisles: low-fat, no-cholesterol, high-fiber. Ingredients labels on formerly two- or three-ingredient foods such as mayonnaise and bread and yogurt ballooned with lengthy lists of new additives what in a more benighted age would have been called adulterants. The Year of Eating Oat Bran also known as 1988 served as a kind of coming-out party for the food scientists, who succeeded in getting the material into nearly every processed food sold in America. Oat bran&apos;s moment on the dietary stage didn&apos;t last long, but the pattern now was set, and every few years since then, a new oat bran has taken its star turn under the marketing lights. (Here come omega-3s!)

You would not think that common food animals could themselves be rejiggered to fit nutritionist fashion, but in fact some of them could be, and were, in response to the 1977 and 1982 dietary guidelines as animal scientists figured out how to breed leaner pigs and select for leaner beef. With widespread lipophobia taking hold of the human population, countless cattle lost their marbling and lean pork was repositioned as &quot;the new white meat&quot; tasteless and tough as running shoes, perhaps, but now even a pork chop could compete with chicken as a way for eaters to &quot;reduce saturated fat intake.&quot; In the years since then, egg producers figured out a clever way to redeem even the disreputable egg: By feeding flaxseed to hens, they could elevate levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the yolks.

Aiming to do the same thing for pork and beef fat, the animal scientists are now at work genetically engineering omega-3 fatty acids into pigs and persuading cattle to lunch on flaxseed in the hope of introducing the blessed fish fat where it had never gone before: into hot dogs and hamburgers.

But these whole foods are the exceptions. The typical whole food has much more trouble competing under the rules of nutritionism, if only because something like a banana or an avocado can&apos;t quite as readily change its nutritional stripes. (Though rest assured the genetic engineers are hard at work on the problem.) To date, at least, they can&apos;t put oat bran in a banana or omega-3s in a peach. So depending on the reigning nutritional orthodoxy, the avocado might either be a high-fat food to be assiduously avoided (Old Think) or a food high in monounsaturated fat to be embraced (New Think). The fate and supermarket sales of each whole food rises and falls with every change in the nutritional weather while the processed foods simply get reformulated and differently supplemented. That&apos;s why when the Atkins diet storm hit the food industry in 2003, bread and pasta got a quick redesign (dialing back the carbs; boosting the proteins) while poor unreconstructed potatoes and carrots were left out in the carbohydrate cold. (The low-carb indignities visited on bread and pasta, two formerly &quot;traditional foods that everyone knows,&quot; would never have been possible had the imitation rule not been tossed out in 1973. Who would ever buy imitation spaghetti? But of course that is precisely what low-carb pasta is.)

A handful of lucky whole foods have recently gotten the &quot;good nutrient&quot; marketing treatment: The antioxidants in the pomegranate (a fruit formerly more trouble to eat than it was worth) now protect against cancer and erectile dysfunction, apparently, and the omega-3 fatty acids in the (formerly just fattening) walnut ward off heart disease. A whole subcategory of nutritional science funded by industry and, according to one recent analysis,* remarkably reliable in its ability to find a health benefit in whatever food it has been commissioned to study has sprung up to give a nutritionist sheen (and FDA-approved health claim) to all sorts of foods, including some not ordinarily thought of as healthy. The Mars Corporation recently endowed a chair in chocolate science at the University of California at Davis, where research on the antioxidant properties of cacao is making breakthroughs, so it shouldn&apos;t be long before we see chocolate bars bearing FDA-approved health claims. (When we do, nutritionism will surely have entered its baroque phase.) Fortunately for everyone playing this game, scientists can find an antioxidant in just about any plant-based food they choose to study.

Yet as a general rule it&apos;s a whole lot easier to slap a health claim on a box of sugary cereal than on a raw potato or a carrot, with the perverse result that the most healthful foods in the supermarket sit there quietly in the produce section, silent as stroke victims, while a few aisles over in Cereal the Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms are screaming their newfound &quot;whole-grain goodness&quot; to the rafters. Watch out for those health claims.

NMSU sets Guinness chili record

 

By ASSOCIATED PRESS
February 16, 2007

 LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) - Paul Bosland recalls taking a bite of a chili pepper and feeling like he was breathing fire.

He gulped down a soda, thinking, &quot;That chili has got to be some kind of record.&quot;

The Guinness Book of Records agreed, confirming recently that Bosland, a regents professor at New Mexico State University, had discovered the world&apos;s hottest chili pepper, Bhut Jolokia, a naturally occurring hybrid native to the Assam region of northeastern India.

The name translates as ghost chili, Bosland said.

&quot;We&apos;re not sure why they call it that, but I think it&apos;s because the chili is so hot, you give up the ghost when you eat it,&quot; he said.

Bhut Jolokia comes in at 1,001,304 Scoville heat units, a measure of hotness for a chili. It&apos;s nearly twice as hot as Red Savina, the variety it replaces as the hottest. 

By comparison, a New Mexico green chili contains about 1,500 Scoville units; an average jalapeno measures at about 10,000.

The Bhut Jolokia variety has potential as a food additive in the packaged food industry, Bosland said. It could be pickled while green, dehydrated and used as seasoning. Because the heat is so concentrated, food manufacturers would save money because they&apos;d use less.

&quot;This isn&apos;t something you&apos;d pickle whole and eat, but it could replace dehydrated jalapeno as an additive,&quot; Bosland said.

A member of NMSU&apos;s Chile Pepper Institute who was visiting India sent Bhut Jolokia seeds to NMSU for testing in 2001. The plant doesn&apos;t produce fruit easily, so it took a couple of years to get enough for field testing, Bosland said.

He then grew Bhut Jolokia, Red Savina and habanero peppers under controlled settings and found that Bhut Jolokia had significantly higher Scoville ratings. Those findings were confirmed by two independent laboratories.

Bhut Jolokia seeds are available through the Chile Pepper Institute.

Mexican seeks world chili eating record

 


By IOAN GRILLO
 Associated Press Writer 

MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For most people, even the smallest bite of a raw chili pepper means a flushed face and a rush for a gulp of water. But Manuel Quiroz can guzzle down dozens of Mexico&apos;s spiciest chilies, rub them on his skin and even squeeze their juice into his eyes without so much as blinking.

The 54-year-old Mexico City taxi driver said Saturday that he has made thousands of dollars with his talent and wants to become the world champion chili eater. But first he needs to find an organization that can crown him with that title.

&quot;Chilies don&apos;t sting me. They don&apos;t affect me. It&apos;s just like eating fruit,&quot; Quiroz said at a market in the Mexican capital. Shoppers stared in amazement as he crunched on a habanero, the hottest chili pepper in a country that likes its food spicy.

Quiroz said he discovered his talent when he was 7 and grew up betting people that he could eat more chilies than they could. He never lost.

&quot;I&apos;m the best. No one can rival me,&quot; he said.

His biggest windfall came when he entered a competition organized by a local television station and took home the $2,000 purse.

Quiroz said he plans to try to get his abilities recognized by Guinness World Records. To his knowledge, no one in the world can swallow more chilies.

&quot;Chilies are the pride of Mexico,&quot; Quiroz said. &quot;The world chili-eating champion has got to be here.&quot;

Quiroz said he has never been examined by a doctor to find out if there is a medical explanation for his extraordinary endurance to the spice.

&quot;Why would I go and see a doctor?&quot; he said. &quot;There is nothing wrong with me. Eating chilies makes me feel great.&quot;

Coffee taste test stirs hot debate

 


 By David Colker, Times Staff Writer 
February 3, 2007

In the coffee smackdown, it was yuppie Starbucks versus Ronald McDonald.

And the clown won.

Consumer Reports magazine said Friday that its tasters found McDonald&apos;s coffee to be &quot;decent and moderately strong,&quot; with &quot;no flaws,&quot; and that the Starbucks brew &quot;was strong, but burnt and bitter enough to make your eyes water instead of open.&quot;

The March issue of the influential magazine advises, &quot;Try McDonald&apos;s, which was cheapest and best.&quot; But does Seattle-based Starbucks have grounds for protest? After all, the survey was conducted by just two tasters who tried the coffees on-site.

&quot;We assemble panels of at least six testers to taste the coffee under tightly controlled conditions,&quot; said coffee consultant Willem Boot, who trains tasters for the Coffee Quality Institute in Long Beach. &quot;Doing only two samples in this case is crazy.&quot;

Consumer Reports co-taster Erin Gudeux, a magazine staff member, defended the test as a guide for consumers. &quot;They&apos;ve got the pocketbook and they&apos;ve got the choice,&quot; she said. Other fast-food coffees fared worse, including those from Burger King (&quot;tasted more like hot water&quot;) and Dunkin&apos; Donuts (&quot;inoffensive&quot;).

The test is likely to be taken seriously by the chains. Starbucks said in a statement, &quot;Choosing a brand of coffee is a personal decision, as taste is subjective.&quot;

But Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald&apos;s Corp. was obviously lovin&apos; it. &quot;It was great news,&quot; company spokeswoman Danya Proud said. The chain, with 13,700 restaurants in the U.S., changed its coffee blend last year.

Proud said the company was developing new coffee products. What&apos;s next, a half-caf latte with a Happy Meal?

How water bottlers tap into all sorts of sources

 


 David Lazarus 


In early 2004, Coca-Cola launched its Dasani brand of bottled water in Britain. Dasani had already established itself as one of the most popular bottled waters in the United States.

Within weeks, however, Coke had a disaster in the making. The British press discovered that Dasani was nothing more than processed tap water and ran a series of indignant stories suggesting that consumers were being hoodwinked by the U.S. beverage giant.

Shortly afterward, a cancer-causing chemical -- bromate -- was discovered in Dasani bottles produced in Britain. The water was quickly withdrawn from store shelves and plans were canceled to market Dasani elsewhere in Europe, which to this day remains a Dasani-free zone.

&quot;In the USA, it is the bottled-water market&apos;s second-most-popular drink,&quot; London&apos;s Independent newspaper observed. &quot;Which goes to show we may have a special relationship with America, but there&apos;s a lot of clear blue water between us.&quot;

Ray Crockett, a spokesman for Coke, shrugged off the criticism. &quot;There&apos;s no accounting for the British press,&quot; he said.

Be that as it may, most Americans are probably unaware that Dasani, like many bottled waters sold in the United States, doesn&apos;t originate from pristine mountain springs; it starts in the same pipes that run into people&apos;s kitchens.

Dasani undergoes a filtering process and, according to Coke, is &quot;enhanced with minerals for a pure, fresh taste.&quot; But, in the end, it&apos;s still tap water.

&quot;The consumer doesn&apos;t seem to care about source,&quot; said Gary Hemphill, managing director of New York&apos;s Beverage Marketing Corp., the leading compiler of statistics about the beverage industry. &quot;As long as it tastes good.&quot;

As I reported in Wednesday&apos;s column, Americans spent an estimated $11 billion last year drinking 8.3 billion gallons of bottled water.

That means the average American consumed almost 28 gallons of Dasani, Aquafina, Evian or hundreds of other brands -- more than any other commercial beverage except soda. More than milk. More than coffee. More than beer.

Beverage Marketing Corp. estimates that the typical half-liter container of bottled water sells for about a dollar. That equates with a price of roughly $7.50 per gallon (although it&apos;s cheaper when bought by the case or in the five-gallon jugs found in many offices). Some of the more expensive brands can cost as much as $11 per gallon.

A gallon of regular unleaded gas was selling nationwide Thursday for an average $2.20, according to AAA.

&quot;It&apos;s ridiculous,&quot; said Richard Wilk, a professor of anthropology at Indiana University who has studied the bottled-water industry. &quot;Why do people spend so much to drink water from glaciers or from Iceland? What&apos;s the difference?&quot;

Consumers typically say bottled water tastes better than tap water. But a series of well-publicized taste tests have repeatedly shown that tap water in municipalities nationwide compares favorably with most bottled waters.

Consumers also say they have health concerns about tap water. But, again, studies have repeatedly shown that tap water in most U.S. cities is as healthy as the bottled variety.

In San Francisco, city officials collected nearly 34,000 samples from the water supply in 2005 and ran more than 100,000 water-quality tests. &quot;All compliance monitoring results met or exceeded federal and state drinking water regulations,&quot; the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission reported.

That same year, the commission held a blind taste test near the Ferry Building. The 300 participants were offered samples of two popular bottled-water brands (Crystal Geyser and Aquafina) and local tap water.

Half said they preferred the tap water. Twenty-five percent picked bottled water. And 25 percent said they couldn&apos;t tell the difference.

&quot;I&apos;d put our water up against bottled water any day,&quot; said Susan Leal, general manager of the commission.

The bottled-water industry downplays comparisons with far cheaper tap water, saying the boom in sales reflects consumers choosing bottled water over soda and other drinks, not as an alternative to what comes out of the faucet.

&quot;Consumers are choosing bottled water in lieu of other packaged beverages,&quot; said Stephen Kay, spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association, the leading industry trade group. &quot;They&apos;re looking for more water in their diet.&quot;

This sentiment was echoed by Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for Nestle Waters North America, which sells bottled water under the Perrier, Arrowhead and Poland Spring brands, among others.

&quot;People want to avoid drinks that have calories, that have caffeine,&quot; she said. &quot;This is the role that bottled water is playing in society today.&quot;

But John Sicher, the editor and publisher of an influential industry publication called Beverage Digest, said the trend away from soda is only part of the story.

&quot;Consumers are drinking less tap water than they did 10 years ago,&quot; he observed. &quot;One reason is the ubiquity of bottled water.&quot;

Not all bottled waters are the same. While many containers depict flowing rivers or mountain vistas, you have to read the label carefully to know whether the contents come from a spring or a faucet.

Under guidelines set by the Food and Drug Administration, spring water is water that flows naturally to the surface from an underground source. Mineral water also comes from an underground source but contains at least 250 parts per million dissolved solids such as minerals and trace elements.

If the label doesn&apos;t specify spring water or mineral water, it isn&apos;t.

The leading bottled water brand in the United States is PepsiCo&apos;s Aquafina, followed by Coke&apos;s Dasani. Each does more than $1 billion in annual sales, according to Beverage Marketing Corp.

Both Aquafina and Dasani, as well as many other bottled-water brands sold in stores and supermarkets, are what the FDA calls purified water. Purified water comes from the same municipal pipes that everyone else&apos;s water comes from.

The difference is that purified water undergoes any of a variety of filtration treatments to remove chlorine and most dissolved solids.

&quot;It&apos;s municipal-source water that&apos;s been purified,&quot; explained Hemphill at Beverage Marketing Corp.

In other words, tap water.

&quot;I guess that&apos;s how you could identify it.&quot;

The irony is that, while the packaging of purified water frequently evokes natural settings and often features the word &quot;pure,&quot; it is distinct from ordinary tap water precisely because it has been run through sophisticated machinery.

It is, in other words, anything but natural. Industry representatives generally make no pretense of claiming that purified water is better for consumers than most tap water.

&quot;We like to think that the reason people buy our bottled water is because it tastes great,&quot; said Coke&apos;s Crockett.

Ultimately, it&apos;s still water -- tasteless, odorless, colorless. But the beverage industry spent about $60 million in 2005 to convince people that they should drink their water from plastic bottles.

&quot;There are subtle taste differences among the brands,&quot; insisted Kay at the International Bottled Water Association. &quot;It depends on the consumer&apos;s palate.&quot;

On Sunday: Drinking Fiji.

The Fat Badger

 

 Giles Coren-www.timesonline.co.uk 

 If I am not offered tap water before mineral water, restaurants will be penalised 

It is two years to the week since this column went zero tolerance on organic meat and sustainable fish introducing the unique meat/fish category into its elaborate points-scoring system and in that time menus have improved remarkably, at least at the middle and top ends of the market. So now Im going after mineral water.
I touched on this the other week, in my review of Acorn, the eco-friendly restaurant in Kings Cross, but now I am going to do more than touch it. I am going to grasp it, embrace it, hold it like Ill never let it go.

Mineral water is a preposterous vanity. It is flown and shipped around the world, from France and Norway at best, from Japan and Fiji at worst. It is bottled in glass that is mostly thrown away and is stupidly heavy to freight, or in plastic which never, ever, decomposes and just goes to landfill or ends up in one of the plastic patches the size of Texas currently gyring in our oceans.

Food snobs and restaurant critics make a big song and dance about mineral waters they like and dont like. New Yorks Ritz-Carlton even caters to the whim of abstemious punters with a dedicated water list and sommelier.

The vanity of it! While half the world dies of thirst or puts up with water you wouldnt piss in, or already have, we have invested years and years, and vast amounts of money, into an ingenious system which cleanses water of all the nasties that most other humans and animals have always had to put up with, and delivers it, dirt-cheap, to our homes and workplaces in pipes, which we can access at a tap.

And yet last year we bought three billion litres of bottled water.
3,000,000,000 litres! I have no idea how much that is. But it seems a lot.
Especially when we were fooled into buying it because of labels that said pure as an alpine stream, bottled at the foot of a Mexican volcano or cleansed for three million years beneath a Siberian glacier. What morons we are.

We spent 2 billion on the stuff. And then we grumble about water metering and annual domestic bills of a couple of hundred quid for water that is just as good, and whose consumption by us is unlimited. Those two billion pounds could go some way to mending the odd leak, dont you think? Towards digging the odd reservoir?

From the restaurants point of view it is just a clipping system. Its more free money. The mark-ups are bigger even than they are on wine. Youll pay four to five pounds in most posh London restaurants for stuff no different, no different at all, from what you brushed your teeth in that morning (not leaving the tap on while doing so, I hope). The result is billions of unnecessary food miles, non-biodegradable waste, millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases, more urban pollution, hell in a handcart.

From now on, if a restaurant does not offer me tap water, politely, unsarcastically, and before they offer mineral water, then they will be penalised. The only bottled water I will tolerate will henceforth be Belu sourced and bottled in Shropshire, sold in glass or fully degradable plastic made from a corn derivative which can be composted back to soil in 12 weeks, and all of whose profits go to fund drinking-water projects in India and Africa and river-cleaning projects in Britain.

Alligator soup raises eyebrows in China

 


 By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer 

SHANGHAI, China - Even in anything-edible-goes-in-the-pot China, the Huifu Fine-food Restaurant is drawing attention with special menu offerings that include alligator kebabs and soup complete with the endangered species&apos; head and tail.

 

The restaurant, in the scenic city of Huangshan in eastern Anhui province, has been doing a roaring business since it started serving alligator dishes last month, staff said Friday.

&quot;Yes, we do serve alligator here, but the amount is limited every day so you&apos;d better book it at least two or three days ahead,&quot; said a staffer at the restaurant, who like many media-shy Chinese refused to give his name.

He said the most recommended dishes were alligator steak and soup. &quot;Both of them keep the natural taste of the alligator meat,&quot; he said.

The species of alligator served at Huifu the &quot;alligator sinensis&quot; is a critically endangered species in its natural habitat, with only about 150 thought to be living in the wild in Anhui and neighboring Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces along the Yangtze river.

The restaurant obtained a special license from the Forestry Ministry for serving meat from reptiles raised at a breeding center, said a manager at the restaurant, who gave only her surname, Lin. She said four restaurants in Anhui were serving alligator.

Despite the establishment of protection zones and laws against poaching, the population in the wild is falling by 4 percent to 6 percent a year, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

The number of farmed alligators has soared to more than 10,000 because the animals breed prolifically in captivity, unlike another rare Chinese species, the giant panda.

Although breeding centers are struggling to prevent inbreeding among the captive species, the number hatched each year exceeds 1,500.

The Chinese penchant for exotic dishes includes all sorts of creatures, including snakes and other reptiles &quot;anything that flies, walks or swims,&quot; according to one traditional saying.

While some reports questioned the wisdom of stimulating demand for an endangered species and potentially encouraging poaching, supporters say sales of alligator meat and skins can help support efforts to save the species.

The alligators slaughtered for food are only those in the third generation of captive breeding those most likely to be affected by inbreeding, said Wu Xiaobing, an expert on Chinese alligators at the Wuhu-based College of Life Science, Anhui Normal University.

&quot;In my opinion, there&apos;s no problem with this,&quot; Wu said.

Ranch dressing recognized at Inventors Hall of Fame

 

Akron, Ohio (AP) -- The National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio has inducted more than 300 men and women and honor their inventiveness.

But it also has a separate display about interesting things and how they came about, such as marbles and fishing lures.

This month, Hidden Valley dressing will receive recognition. It is owned by the Clorox Company.

The donated recipe dates back to the 1950s at the Hidden Valley Guest Ranch in California and resulted from mixing dry seasoning with buttermilk and mayonnaise.

It will be placed in the museums archives with the 1955 recipe for Campbells green bean casserole.

Hummus Place

 

Kind readers, I have found a nice restaurant that I will now reccomend to the cognescenti among you. The joint in question is named &quot;Hummus Place&quot;. Not the most glamorous name but not misleading either and you know that TiP does value clairity.

I only ate there once but this was sufficient to base a review upon. The place is down a flight of stairs so it may easily be overlooked. Beware, the shop above it has a video of a foot massage running continuously so avert your eyes as you draw near.

The place seats maybe 35 but had five (5) wait staff and all came to our table throughout the experience, chaos reigned, the good kind.
Face it snobs, one goes out to eat for the convenience or for the experience. Hummus Place has both AND proper houmous.
 (Pronunciation advice, use the long, throat clearing, gutteral &quot;CH&quot; followed by, OOH then, &quot;MOOSE&quot; If this proves elusive, keep silent and do not attempt the lame &quot;Who miss&quot; as it will mark you as a pathetic undeserving noob.) 

The menu is severly limited, maybe 4 entrees. I think a plate of was $5.95. The Houmous was warm and creamy, the first I&apos;ve found in NYC. The Falafel and the lemonade were excellet as well. The Baclava was a disapointment, avoid it. The Turkish coffe was bracing and BONAFIDE. Let the coffee settle before you try it or you will regret it.

In conclusion, Authentic, tasty and cheap, Five paws! 

Hummus Place
305 Amsterdam Avenue
(Between 74th&amp;75th Streets)
(212) 799-3335

or you might try the ones at;

99 Macdougal Street
or
109 St. Marks Place

but I cannot vouch for them, yet.

10% of tuna at sushi bars unfit to eat

 

 BY GARY WISBY Environment Reporter 

Pregnant, or planning to be? Don&apos;t eat tuna when you go out for sushi.

That was the urging of researchers who on Wednesday released a study that found dangerous mercury levels at 10 top Chicago-area sushi restaurants.

Seventy percent of samples exceeded the mercury threshold at which Illinois advises women of childbearing age -- and young children -- not to have more than one serving a month.

&quot;Toxic Tuna,&quot; a report by Environment Illinois and California-based GotMercury.org, said 10 percent of the tuna sushi samples they tested shouldn&apos;t be eaten by anyone -- man, woman or child -- because they had more mercury than the FDA&apos;s &quot;actionable level.&quot; That&apos;s the level that would prompt the feds to seize the contaminated fish.

The report names seven restaurants in the city and one each in Lombard, Schaumburg and Wheeling. But Environment Illinois&apos; Max Muller said the intention wasn&apos;t to point fingers at specific sushi spots, but at tuna sushi in general.

Muller and Eli Saddler of GotMercury.org said sushi restaurants should post warnings about their fare, either voluntarily or by legislative mandate.

Consumer Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, went even further in July, recommending that pregnant women avoid eating all tuna.


 &apos;Billions in costs to society&apos; 


Mercury causes decreased IQs and mental retardation in fetuses and young children, said Dr. Peter Orris of the University of Illinois at Chicago&apos;s School of Public Health. If sources of mercury pollution -- including coal-fired power plants and mercury-laden products that are disposed of improperly -- aren&apos;t curbed, &quot;personal tragedies and yearly billions in costs to society will continue to mount,&quot; he said.

Colleen McShane, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association, still reeling from the City Council ban on foie gras, said, &quot;This is another cry for . . . overregulating restaurants.&quot;

Many restaurants already post advisories against pregnant women eating uncooked foods, she said. If customers want further warnings, &quot;restaurants will absolutely respond,&quot; McShane added. &quot;The customer sure isn&apos;t complaining.&quot;

Hot Dogs May Cause Genetic Mutations

 

By Charles Q. Choi
 Special to LiveScience 

Everyone knows hot dogs aren&apos;t exactly healthy for you, but in a new study chemists find they may contain DNA-mutating compounds that might boost one&apos;s risk for cancer.

Scientists note there is an up to 240-fold variation in levels of these chemicals across different brands.

&quot;One could try and find out what the difference in manufacturing techniques are between the brands, and if it&apos;s decided these things are a hazard, one could change the manufacturing methods,&quot; researcher Sidney Mirvish, a chemist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, told LiveScience.

Extracts from hot dogs bought from the supermarket, when mixed with nitrites, resulted in what appeared to be these DNA-mutating compounds. When added to Salmonella bacteria, hot dog extracts treated with nitrites doubled to quadrupled their normal DNA mutation levels. Triggering DNA mutations in the gut might boost the risk for colon cancer, the researchers explained.

&quot;I won&apos;t say you shouldn&apos;t eat hot dogs,&quot; Mirvish said. Future research will feed hot dog meat to mice to see if they develop colon cancer or precancerous conditions, he explained.

James Hodges, president of the American Meat Institute Foundation in Washington, noted this study is &quot;a preliminary report that the author concedes requires further investigation. The carcinogenic risk to humans of the compounds studied has not been determined.&quot;

The possible hazard presented here is not just limited to hot dogs. Salted dried fish and seasonings such as soy sauce may contain similar levels of these chemicals, Mirvish said.

Mirvish and his colleagues reported their findings in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

The Revenge of Burger King

 


Jay Cridlin-Tampa Bay Times

There is something about the number four that gives it a special place in our culture.

Four-wheel drive. The four-minute mile. The Fantastic Four.

Now, thanks to the power of the number four, we&apos;re seeing a breakthrough in fast-food development that&apos;s at once fascinating, terrifying and 100 percent by-gum American.

The four-patty cheeseburger.

 

It&apos;s called the BK Quad Stacker, and it lumbered onto menus this month at Burger King.

The Stacker&apos;s formula is simple: bacon, cheese, creamy sauce and burger patties. No veggies.

Four patties. Four slices of cheese. Eight slices of bacon. Try to wrap your mind, if not your mouth, around that. (It also has about 1,000 calories, which is actually only a few more than a double Whopper with cheese.)

Until now, the permanent four-patty burger was only a dream for fast-food restaurants.

It should be noted that aside from the sauce and unholy size, the sandwich is identical to a regular bacon cheeseburger. Like a bloated movie sequel that no one really asked for - Rocky IV, perhaps - the Stacker doesn&apos;t improve upon Burger King&apos;s traditional formula. It just gives us ... more.

Our Quad Stacker was 2 1/2 inches thick, nearly the width of a Post-It note, packed so tightly in yellow caulk-like cheese that we couldn&apos;t count the bacon slices. Plain and simple, its sheer size made it physically difficult to devour. What, we wondered, was the point of unleashing such a monstrosity on the masses?

Burger King has been experimenting with new products to reach new consumers, like the limited-time Cheesy Tots and Shake &apos;Em Up Spicy Fries.

You could argue that this isn&apos;t a good thing, that the fourth patty was a line of demarcation man was not meant to cross. But this is America, home of the 40-ounce Slurpee.

Yes, the four-patty burger was inevitable. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse would surely be proud.

Protester sour over milk fight with Waffle House

 


JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. -AP- Bart Hoard&apos;s desire for a little milk has spilled over into a five-year dispute with a Waffle House restaurant.

Hoard describes himself as a loyal, two-decade-long Waffle House customer who was driven to demonstrate with a handmade sign this week over an escalating conflict that began when he says he simply asked for some milk to put in his coffee.

 

As Hoard tells it, he was told that if he wanted milk he would have to pay for a full glass. He responded by going to a nearby market, buying a carton of milk and coming back to needle Waffle House franchise executive Andy Mount with the well-known tag line: &apos;&apos;Got milk? I do.&apos;&apos;

Hoard said the conflict escalated more than two years ago when he was accused of smoking marijuana outside a restaurant and was banned from Waffle Houses. Hoard denies he was smoking the drug.

Mount didn&apos;t respond to requests for comment left on his pager and at three local restaurants operated by his franchise.

Dunkin&apos; Donuts Ad Actor Michael Vale Dies

The passing of an era.
 

NEW YORK (AP) - Michael Vale , the actor best known for his portrayal of a sleepy-eyed Dunkin&apos; Donuts baker who said &quot;Time to make the doughnuts,&quot; has died. He was 83.

Vale died Saturday in New York City of complications from diabetes, according to son-in law Rick Reil.
Vale&apos;s long-running character, &quot;Fred the Baker,&quot; for the doughnut maker&apos;s ad campaign lasted 15 years until he retired in 1997.

Canton, Mass.-based Dunkin&apos; Donuts said in a statement that Vale&apos;s character &quot;became a beloved American icon that permeated our culture and touched millions with his sense of humor and humble nature.&quot;

Vale was born in Brooklyn and studied acting at the Dramatic Workshop in New York City with classmates Tony Curtis, Ben Gazzara and Rod Steiger.
A veteran of the Broadway stage, film and television, Vale appeared in more than 1,300 TV commercials.

Space food a la carte

 

BBC News

A leading French chef has been asked to help create space food for astronauts on long-term voyages in space.

Alain Ducasse already has several Michelin stars, but now he is determined to conquer diners further afield.

France may be suffering from a period of gloomy introspection, but when it comes to food, there is no false modesty: this nation still believes it is the best in the world.

 

And now, perhaps, beyond. Mr Ducasse&apos;s food academy has been asked by the European Space Agency (Esa) to help create a menu for Europe&apos;s astronauts that will not just nourish their bodies, but also their spirits - helping men and women on long-term missions, for example to Mars, to survive for 1,000 days in space.

Man cannot live on bread alone, says the space agency, so a bit of sun-dried tomato and soya rice pudding wouldn&apos;t go amiss.

The food researchers are focusing on eight or nine main ingredients, including onions, potatoes, rice, lettuce and spinach, which could be grown aboard a spacecraft, saving on storage space for the journey.

The chefs working on the project say the idea is to create a meal that reminds the astronauts of home - while remaining a menu that could be described as out of this world.

Legendary moonshiner dead at 101

 

CLEVERTOWN, Ky., Dec. 6 (UPI) -- Maggie Bailey, a Kentucky bootlegger who spent years selling moonshine without a conviction, has died at the age of 101.

Bailey first got involved in illegal alcohol sales at the age of 17 and continued until she was 95, winning the nickname &quot;Queen of the Mountain Bootleggers,&quot; the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. She was so loved in Harlan County that juries simply would not bring in a guilty verdict.

&quot;Everybody knew her and she had helped everybody,&quot; Helen Halcomb, wife of Bailey&apos;s nephew, told the newspaper. &quot;Why do you bite the hand that feeds you, as the old saying goes.&quot;

U.S. District Judge Karl Forester said that he was Bailey&apos;s lawyer for some years.

&quot;She was an expert on the Fourth Amendment,&quot; he said. &quot;She knew the laws of search and seizure as well as any person I&apos;ve known.&quot;

Friends remember Bailey as someone who helped families with food in times of need and put several young people through college. She herself lived modestly, conducting her business in uniforms that said &quot;National Distillery&quot; that were handed down from a sister who worked there.

Bailey was a widow and is survived by nieces and nephews.

Down the Hatch, Then What?

 

Set Aside the Question of Why Competitive Eaters Do What They Do. Some Want to Know How
By Ben Harder
 The Washington Post 


Ian Hickman, a recent University of Kentucky graduate, quit his job as a clothing store manager and relocated to Sterling last month so he could be closer to the action. Hickman, 22, plans to compete for cash and fame by bolting Buffalo wings, hot dogs, watermelon and other manner of victuals.

&quot;I just want to eat food, and impress my friends, and win money,&quot; said the six-foot-tall 165-pounder. In the first three months of competition, he figures he has won a little over $1,000. Some medical specialists believe there is something in it for them, too. They say they can learn fundamental facts about gastrointestinal physiology from people who can, as Hickman once did, eat nine pounds of watermelon in 15 minutes.

 

&quot;I would love to study them,&quot; said gastroenterologist George Triadafilopoulos, a professor of medicine at Stanford University. He said studying competitive eating would help researchers &quot;understand the mechanisms [of swallowing and satiety] and treat people in whom the mechanisms are not working.&quot;

Which is not to say they recommend anybody do it. Speed-eating has plenty of unpleasant side effects, among them vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea and painful gas, experts say. Not to mention choking, stomach rupture and esophageal inflammation. Frequent vomiting can splash teeth with stomach acid, eroding enamel. Swallowed bones can injure intestines; inhaled food can get trapped in airways. Then there is the issue of regularly eating far too many calories to maintain a healthy weight.

&quot;These competitions go against everything that we&apos;ve learned&quot; about healthy eating, said Bonnie Taub-Dix, a dietitian based in Woodmere, N.Y., and a spokesman for the American Dietetic Association.
