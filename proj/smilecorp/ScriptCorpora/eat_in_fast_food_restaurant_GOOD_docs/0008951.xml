 Old-timer&apos;s coffee brewing blues 
 By CHUCK AVERY 
 Hagerstown Resident 

 Last week my wife and I went to the gym for our workout, then to a fast food restaurant for lunch. It was raining, so after we were seated in a booth, I was using my napkin to wipe my eyes, a Kleenex to blow my nose and generally cleaning up. After removing my glasses, I began telling Michelle a funny story that I&apos;d heard at the gym that morning.

I elaborated on the story, laughing as I talked. When I took the napkin away and put the glasses back on, I realized that Michelle had gone to the restroom to wash up. I had been talking to no one. I looked around to see several other diners staring at me, as if to say, &quot;Poor old guy. Must be senile.&quot;

There are indications they may be right.

For example, recently my wife bought one of those fancy automatic coffee makers, the ones that make one cup at a time. They require that the owner also buy his coffee in little containers that are a lot more expensive than buying the same amount of coffee by the pound.

I didn&apos;t use it at first, preferring to drop a tea bag into a cup of water and stick it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.

(Just to illustrate that all things are relative, for years following the introduction of the tea bag, the British would not use them. They preferred loose tea brewed in pots. They claimed tea bags were too troublesome, too expensive and too American.)

In the past I resisted automatic car windows, female news anchors, basketball shot clocks, microwave ovens, cell phones, etc. -- lots of things that I later grew fond of. So, following my usual period of reluctance to change, I asked my wife to show me how to program the gadget so I could have a cup of coffee.

She explained that after turning it on, I had to watch the blinking lights. When this particular one went on -- and here she pointed -- it was time to insert a cartridge and pull down this lever. This would start another light blinking. Then I should put my cup under the spout and push the lighted button to start the coffee brewing.

She got everything set up and after several preliminary lights, she inserted the coffee cartridge and asked if I&apos;d like to push the final button. I did so nervously. After a few seconds of gurgling and wet sounding, obscene noises from deep in its bowels, the machine produced a thin stream of coffee. The spout filled my cup with exactly the right amount, made some wet, slurping noises and shut itself off.

The coffee was surprisingly good.

The next day I turned the machine on, checked all the preliminary lights, inserted the cartridge, placed my cup under the spout and pulled the lever. I counted down from 10 and hit the &quot;lift-off&quot; button. When the machine responded with the proper noises, I went to the refrigerator to get the cream.

When I came back, there was coffee all over the counter.

&quot;Michelle!&quot; I yelled. &quot;I hate this damned machine! It&apos;s spilling coffee all over the kitchen.&quot; She came in, took one look and said, &quot;It&apos;s spilling because your cup is upside down.&quot;

I quietly grabbed a towel and began cleaning up.

Automation is ruining American culture.
