 Hanoi–Vietnam 
 
Hanoi is the capital of Vietnam and is Vietnam’s second largest city. Hanoi city is located on the right bank of the Red River. Hanoi is located at 1,760 km (1,090 mi) north of Ho Chi Minh City. Basically if you are unfamiliar with Hanoi, there are the old quarter, French quarter and the new area, where the old quarters are filled with rolls of shop-houses and you can see overhead wires hanging all over the place, the French quarter is much cleaner and organize are with historical French buildings, while the new area is where you can find modern shopping malls and modern facilities etc.

 

If you are in Hanoi, you will probably want to do these things:

 Watch the interesting water puppet show Take a stroll at the night market in the old quarter (which is only there on Friday, Saturday and Sunday night starts at around 7pm), if you are buying anything there, or anywhere in Hanoi, always try to bargain and slash the offered price to half if not more. The prices most of the vendors offered there can be cut throat. Visit the Chu Dong Xuan which has pretty much the same thing as what are offered in the night market Also visit the ever famous Ho Chi Minh Museum as well as mausoleum. If you go to the mausoleum, pls remember this, your hands should not be in your pocket or you will get warning from the guards there, and no shorts or slippers there too. Actually you can do all the above within a day if you plan everything carefully, but if you are not a planner, then just pay about USD30 to USD35 for a day trip with an English speaking tour guide, and you will get to visit all the places above. Btw, you may also note that it is not compulsory to pay tips to the guide there, although if you have the mean too, then go ahead, you can brighten up their day, but if you are budget backpacker, don’t feel shy, you do not have the obligation to pay tips. 

 

While in Hanoi, if you have finish all the above activities and still have at least 2 days to spare, you should arrange for a tour to Ha Long Bay, which is about 180KM from Hanoi and will takes about 3.5 hours drive (one way). Usually the 2 days 1 night trip, which lets you stay on board a cruise will costs you around USD115 to a few hundreds dollars depending on the package offered. Btw, Ha Long Bay is one of the 7 new wonders of nature in the world. And you will be marveled by it, it is being called“rock wonder in the sky”for a good reason. It is definitely a not to be missed destination.

For food, there are lots of small cafe all over Hanoi, you have pure Vietnamese food to fusion and totally foreign. And for those adventurous, you can try out the food vendors by the street with mini chair and table but definitely not for the weak stomach. And the food you must absolutely try while you are there is the Pho (a noodle soup served with thin rice vermicelli noodles with a rich, clear broth made from a long boiling of meat and spices–it can be beef or chicken), and the Vietnamese spring rolls. Of course there are lots of other authentic Vietnamese food, but these 2 are the ever famous with the travelers.

 

And finally, the street is filled with motorbikes, my tour guide told me there is approximately 6 millions motorbikes in Hanoi alone, based on the estimation of each Hanoian with 1 motorbike each. And the streets are usually without traffic light, thus crossing the street can be a heart stopping game. But the good thing is, if you walk slowly based on your own good judgement, you should be able to cross the street in one piece as most of the motorists (be in motorbikes, cars, bicycle or trishaw etc) will do their best to avoid you, but it is better safe and sorry, so you should really be extremely carefully when crossing the street.

 How to pair wines with Chinese food 
 
 PARIS, May 27 — Unlike Western meals, which are served in prescribed order and arrive in multiple courses, the challenge of pairing wines with Asian meals is that food comes all at once, they mix seafoods with beef and chicken, and they run the gamut from sweet and sour to kicky, spicy heat.  But in advance of Vinexpo, a major wine trade fair set…
