 VERO BEACH —
A drive-thru customer at a fast food restaurant Monday offered something green to pay for his meal, but it wasn&apos;t cash, according to the Indian River County Sheriff&apos;s Office.

A McDonald&apos;s cashier called 911 at 12:22 a.m. Monday after Shawn Alexander Pannullo, 27, of the 4800 block of Second Street, Vero Beach, wanted to trade some marijuana for food, according to the arrest affidavit.

The cashier from the McDonald&apos;s, located in the 5000 block of 20th Street, provided a description of Pannullo&apos;s vehicle. A deputy spotted the car and found marijuana inside, the affidavit said.

Pannullo was charged with possession of cannabis and posted $500 bail Monday.

The report didn&apos;t indicate what Pannullo ordered at McDonald&apos;s or if he paid for the meal through other means.

ookamookana, there is a difference between right and wrong! Too bad your mama didn&apos;t know how to teach you the difference. Maybe this stupid dude could have t-boned you in his car and killed you!! The cashier did the right thing to get him off the road.

Its no big deal a little weed never hurt anyone excerpt to get in trouble with the law. I talked to him and he said it went down a little differently than reported. He is a good guy and a good friend.

Yes alot of people in this town smoke weed but it isn&apos;t legal. Smoke in private and maybe you will not get in trouble. Personal I think if you made it legal everyone wouldn&apos;t make such a big deal about it. BUT you have to admit trying to pay for food with weed was pretty stupid!! Also pretty funny too!! What a world we live in!!

Idiot, aka, tdot, can&apos;t wait to read your 15 minutes.
I don&apos;t care if someone snitches when your brother takes you out. They can have the merit badge.

This is an example of the barter system.

Instead of money, to pay for his purchase, he offered something else of value. Capitalism at its best.
