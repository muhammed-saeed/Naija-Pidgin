The McDonaldization of Society
   
   
     
 The McDonaldization of society is the process by which widespread areas of society are influenced by the principles of the fast food restaurant. McDonald&apos;s was the first successful fast food chain in the United States. Today, McDonald&apos;s is synonymous with Americana. People around the world have adapted the franchise concept to businesses and institutions. A new type of jargon is even used to describe things that have &quot;McDonald&quot; characteristics: drive-in medical clinics are known as McDoctors, USA Today is called McPaper, minimum wage employment is referred to as a McJob. As Ritzer (1996) puts it, &quot;McDonald&apos;s has strived to continually extend its reach within American society and beyond&quot; (p. 5). McDonaldization is based on the following four concepts: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control.
The cartoon of the computer pushing the struggling guy into the spotlight is an example of the efficiency and control aspects of McDonaldization. The article that the cartoon refers to describes an Internet credit reporting agency that can download personal information about consumers. Granted, this information is public record, but it is available through such a wide range of sources (credit bureaus, courts, state motor vehicle departments, etc.) that the average person would not have access to it.

 trol. Students are controlled because they have to attend classes at set times and meet the requirements of those classes. Students also have to meet the requirements of the degree programs they are pursuing. These controls are necessary as mentioned above for the purpose of efficiency and predictability. If these controls were not present, the college experience might not result in the desired end for the student: a diploma that will lead to a meaningful career.
4. One of the areas where nonhuman technology has replaced human labor is in the college library. Self-service is the name of the game.
